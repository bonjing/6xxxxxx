,sheronperera,2011-05-28T06:48Z,Thank You trialNerror......is this season 5 or season 4 ? and what happened to last week episode? :) 
[T],trialNerror,2011-05-28T08:18Z,"Depends on which source you refer to.
Some TV ep guides say this is the last episode of season 4.  (tvrage, epguides)
Other guides say it's the second episode of season 5.  (tv.com)
Another guide says it's the 5th of season 5.  (thetvdb)
One episode guide even says it's season 3! (tvguide)
It's whatever you want it to be!
There was no last weeks episode.  GA has been doing a new show every other week for a while now.
The next episode isn't until the 10th.
Zak's Paranormal Challenge show premieres June 17th."

,shastar,2011-05-28T20:16Z,im not sure if Loretta Lynn's Plantation House is next in 14 days...
[T],trialNerror,2011-05-28T21:55Z,"Thanks shastar.  
Don't forget the 2 specials at the very beginning of season 4:
Ghost Adventures S04E0A - Best Evidence So Far
Ghost Adventures S04E0B - Scariest Moments

That's how I have them listed in my own folder, A & B + 1 - 26, but I've received comments on the Maysville, KY episode saying it is the first one of season 5.  

Loretta Lynn's Plantation *should* be airing on June 10th, at least that's what all the guides are claiming.  I really don't know what to label it, though.  S05E01 or S05E03.  No matter what I post it as, someone will always be kind enough to comment a correction.  (;"
,Nickyboy7,2011-05-29T12:20Z,"I don't know what's going on either in regards to what episode/season we are in.

But thanks as always,"
