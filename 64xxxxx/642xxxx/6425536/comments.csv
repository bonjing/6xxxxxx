,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T23:52Z,this works 100% try both cracks if one of them doesnt work and try to patch it with the 1.1 patcher dont crack it after you patch it thanks a lot SS64084
,Noodley,2011-05-27T01:37Z,Does this work with the Black_Box version?
,Furious1964,2011-05-27T07:36Z,"All I did was put the original paul.dll file back, ran the 1.1 patch and then replaced the Skidrow paul.dll file in the bin folder and the game works. No need to replace the gameĂ¨s .exe file as it not necessary."
,Pookypsy,2011-05-27T15:31Z,"game is starting after 1.1 patch with the paul.dll from the after patcher folder, but enemys and npcs are disappearing and aiming doesnt work anymore. well at least for me... game freezes after next cutscene. anyone the same problems?"
,RhymesMatter,2011-05-29T16:49Z,Perfect ! Absolutely works! i had the used the the EFIGS patcher and was using the SKIDROW crack.But simply by replacing the cracked files with the ones from this torrent(particularly the ones that say after patcher) the update run instantly and the game worked like a charm!Thanks to uploader for this torrrent
,Zerotic,2011-05-30T11:43Z,"It is asking me to enter a serial code, what do I do?
I thought this was free?"
,SS64084,2011-05-30T20:11Z,Free and DRM free are two dif things.
,AMoveFan,2011-05-31T05:49Z,"when I try to patch it, it just tells me it can't open the launcher then the patching closes, I have a little leg but not much but its still anoying ."

,da_blob,2011-06-05T04:24Z,"SS64084's supposed instructions WILL NOT update the Black_Box version to 1.2

Installed game version is Invalid or Incomplete no matter what you try."
,montanamb,2011-06-06T06:42Z,"To install the patch 1.2, you have to delete installed dlc's located at CookedPC (alchemy_suit,swordsman_suit,roche_jacket,troll,arena,magical_suit and merchant.dzip or .dlc). You might want to back these up, but patch installs all of them anyway."
,montanamb,2011-06-06T14:13Z,"@txe
Man, I have Black Box version and I installed the patch. You don't have to do anything except deleting dlc's if your game is patched to 1.1. No need of any crack. If your game is not patched to 1.1, you can't install 1.2 btw."
,Horseband,2011-06-11T21:54Z,"The patch 1.2 works just fine with Blackbox. Having any cracks or DLC or anything like that installed will screw it up and not let the patch go. 

==100% working guide to installing 1.2 with Blackbox==

1. COMPLETELY UNISTALL your game. backup your save files (MY documents/The witcher 2).
2. Reinstall the game. Do not apply any cracks or anything.
3. Install Patch 1.1
4. Install Patch 1.2

That's it. No crack should be needed at any point.  If you have troubles installing 1.1 then just copy the after patcher paul.dll /witcher.exe from this torrent and replace the ones you have, but you shouldn't have to do that."
,badangrylad,2011-07-10T20:45Z,"there are so many 1.1 patches on the official site. i have skidrow craked blak box repacked iso 6.33 gb.
i reinstalled  removed dzips from cooked pc.but none of the 1.1 patches worked.
main question is which 1.1 patch is applicable to skidrow-blak box ? international/ efigs. exe (germany etc) / atari / polish ? which ?
 i already tried international/ efigs.exe and atari it keeps giving "" invalid version or incomplete install error """
,badangrylad,2011-07-10T20:50Z,"half the places it is written ""run patcher from skidrow folder""... i have no skidrow folder and no patcher. just creaked exe and paull . dll

and i tried re install and removing dzips from cooked pc and efigs.exe it still gives error"
,rubixos,2011-10-16T16:56Z,"It Doenst Work for me ether. i deleted all DLC, reinstaled the game and nothing. Still game version is Invalid or Incomplete ."
