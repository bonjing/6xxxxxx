 LOL's proper is invalid. There was a clear split between the two episodes
 both of which had seperate episode titles. See /SAMPLE/ for an MPG source
 of how it aired with a "More Desperate Housewives Next" tag between the two.

 Similarly this is how Brothers and Sisters S05E17 and S05E18 a few weeks back
 which LOL pred as 2 episodes.

            Think you have what it takes to be a part of
