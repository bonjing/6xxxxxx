,Bak4mHell,2011-05-28T11:12Z,"@drlouies:- Wa'alaikumas'salaam. Sorry bro but fallout new vegas will not be coming on NTSC-J because it refers to Nukes, remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki terror nuke strikes? (biggest terrorist strikes on earth ever) so it is not allowed in Japan. And i have not checked the language. It should be English + Japanese. Allah Hafiz.

@Cipherpunkblue :- Sorry to inform you but this will not be coming to PAL, it is Japanese exclusive title. No plans on PAL yet.

,ShinoBoy,2011-05-28T19:11Z,"Anyone know if this will work on NTSC (US) consoles? And is there any option for English (subtitles), or is it only Japanese?"
,primo205,2011-05-30T14:26Z,"Bak4mHell, 
Thanks a lot!!!"
,capnwinkeh,2011-06-01T09:09Z,Why in the fuck would anyone actually WANT to own a domestic NTSC-J console in the first place?  That's the equivalent of cutting off your own gaming dick. 
,Bak4mHell,2011-06-02T10:12Z,"SEEEDDDD after you have finished downloading. Dont just leech and stop sharing...

@capnwinkeh:- If you know that there are some bloody region systems that keeps dividing us?.... They dont just divide people, they also divide things we use. So in Asia and East regions, they have something called NTSC-J. And in Europe and West Asia they have something called PAL. and in USA & Americas they have something called NTSC.

You will not find NTSC-J in Europe and America. But you will not find PAL & NTSC in Japan and Asia Pacific etc.... that is why.... So its not gamers who are cutting off their genitals, its the governments and their stupid systems who are cutting..... hope you got that little explanation ;-)"
,Bak4mHell,2011-08-10T13:13Z,"If everyone were stuck at 83% - someone should have commented, i would have started uploading long back. Here seeding again...... have fun and seed too.............."
