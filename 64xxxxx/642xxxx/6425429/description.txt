From the Infowars web site ::

Following a rally at the state capitol in Austin yesterday, Alex talks about the TSA and the federal government effort to preempt legislation in Texas. 

Alex welcomes back to the show former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives from Georgia, Bob Barr, who was the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Barr will talk about his Atlanta Journal Constitution article detailing how the government and the House Armed Services Committee plan to expand the war on terror, not roll it back following the purported assassination of Osama bin Laden.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
