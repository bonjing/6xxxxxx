I didn't know,never used FL Video Player so i really didn't know...but there's nothing you or me can do,so we will wait for another patch or something to come out :D

,Jooonnneee,2011-06-08T21:37Z,restart needed before running the program after cracking?
,cena1991,2011-06-09T08:44Z,"@Jooonnneee

I don't believe you need to restart,for me it worked fine without restart after patching"
,mjproject,2011-06-10T18:10Z,nexus bug not fixed :(
,snthss,2011-06-12T00:27Z,"getting an error message in the end of installation. telling me to login as admin, which is the case already. But the installation progress continues and i can start it afterwards, though half of the samples are missing. They are there in the library, but not on my harddisc. Tried clearing the registry etc but without success.. any help appreciated."
,snthss,2011-06-12T01:20Z,"Hum... Fl Studio 9 still works perfectly (the public beta 9.9.2 from assign worked aswell). Just 10 seems to not work, also tried another version here from the bay. No idea why."
,beeper1995,2011-06-15T09:51Z,I love ASSIGN! This ROCKS! I will be seeding for a week
,beeper1995,2011-06-15T09:52Z,"@snthss right click and press ""Run as Administrator"" That should solve your problem."

,delbass,2011-09-12T21:00Z,"I experienced dramatic computer slowdown with this release and many BSODs while using the software.

Reverted back to 9.0, copied the new plugins and effects from 10 and all is good :-)

Maybe malware hidden in there, I cant be sure, but Avast, SuperAntiSpyware and Malware Bytes didnt find anything"

,cena1991,2011-09-16T19:17Z,"@delbass

Personally, I didn't encounter that problems,especially not BSOD...but now i'm on version ""FL Studio 10.0.8""...and if you want me to upload the FL Studio AiR Edition 10.0.8...i will"
,Millenotti,2011-10-08T16:08Z,"Help me pls! I want to learn to use it and I found a tutorial on YT. But the guy in the video selected ""reFX Nexus"" at Piano roll, but I don't have this. I thought there's with Nexus but where the hell is that?

I don't understand it, I really want to learn to use it so I hope someone can help me."
,cena1991,2011-10-11T13:30Z,"@Milenotti

Well it will take some time to fully understand it (about 6 month - 1 year)...just play with FL and you will come across some things you don't know right now...

Visit www.warbeats.com for lot of tutorials and other stuff,i learned much from there...

Nexus is a plug-in which you have to buy or, since we're all here on piratebay, you can download it
Nexus is a great plug-in for all types of music,so it's considered one of the best plugins overall...

Hope it helps :D
Peace"
,Kris10438,2011-10-16T08:48Z,How do you crack? I might sound stupid but I've never done it before :/
,patte2134,2011-10-19T16:24Z,is it just me or is the nexus bug still there? it's sounds like a freaking war from time to time... this sucks :(

,cena1991,2011-11-26T17:24Z,"I might upload the new FL Studio 10.0.9 ASSiGN Edition,but i'll rather wait for the Signature Bundle from AiR...i believe it's coming soon"

,KM49,2012-06-02T17:11Z,"Works great!

Install Instructions:
1) Install the ""flstudio_10.0.2"" and on the last screen UNCHECK the checkbox that says ""Run FL Studio""
2) Double click ""flstudio_10.0.2_crack"" and just keep clicking next or watever.
3)Don't worry about the other file that came with it. Your done now. Open up FL Studio ten from your desktop or start menu.

Awsome torrent, Thanks!"
,mcena91,2012-06-04T14:08Z,"Hello People this is my new account...this account wont accept password for some strange reason...anyway...for the song in the installer i dont have any idea what is the name of the song...the guys from ASSiGN made the installer...im overwhelmed with the feedback from you guys,and i'm glad that FL Studio works on your PC...i have a FL STUDIO 10.0.8 XXL SIGNATURE BUNDLE from AiR and i will upload it here in a few days...this XXL SIGNATURE BUNDLE has everything...and i mean everything...all presets for sakura,poizone etc"
,Zanto1997,2012-06-06T19:29Z,"Great download : ) But when the sound go to the higher tones, it seems like it's cracking a little bit on me D: But i don't know if it is my Headset or the program."
