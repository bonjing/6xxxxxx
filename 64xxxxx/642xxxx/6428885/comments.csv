CODYBOSS1969 thank you for an excellent quality movie, it is your masterpiece really when considering this movie is well over 2 hours long. Good on you mate. In the opening scene, look  for the interaction between Keenan Wynn and a nuisance fly, Wynn's facial expression, trying to blow a fly off his face, a classic, they don't make movies like this anymore."

Keenan Winn is the auctioneer and sheriff of Flagstaff, and does not evan show up till after 1 hr and 45 minutes into the movie. One should be sure of his facts before posting."
