Each time you run the application, it asks you if you want to connect to your 'account'. This allows to get extra services, like traffic, but it's not mandatory. This is normal."

Funguje vynikajuco na Galaxy Ace. Hned po nainstalovani si pytalo aktualizaciu, cize uz to nie je 11.0.1 ale nieco novsie. Mapy si stiahnes okamzite, aktualne a len tie co potrebujes - vzdy mas v telefone len potrebne mapy."

,n_stile,2011-12-05T22:20Z,"Install: Just email yourself and put the .apk file as an attachment.

Open email on phone and select to install.

In the settings you can change so that it doesn't ask to register every time you open it."

,GreenGoatHerder,2012-03-22T15:11Z,"Thank you so much for such a tremendous kindness.
I am a newbie so pls excuse any dumb issues. I downloaded and installed successfully. 
1. Should I try and activate, if so any keys etc.
2. I did create an account without activating. Is this OK.
3. I downloaded a map of France and want to download another one. How do I do so.

I would pls request an answer
Thanks"
,GreenGoatHerder,2012-03-22T16:45Z,"So I figured it out. The Apps have a map downloader.

On another note for installation I downloaded 'AppInstaller'. I copied the .apk file to the SDcard.
AppInstaller has a file browser. I browsed for the file and pressed install.

Works perfectly.

On another note, I also use Wifi File Explorer Pro. I am sure u guys know how to find it. Allows transfer of files from PC to Android device. No app required on PC. Its browser based and works perfectly.

Thanks for the great stuff here."
,cb1000r,2012-06-06T22:29Z,"Hi Asperge. Is it possible/safe to create an account in Sygic for weather, traffic, etc? Thank you for a great program. Respect."
