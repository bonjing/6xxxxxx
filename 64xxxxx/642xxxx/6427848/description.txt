Unblunder was designed to protect against accidental data loss.

Have you ever sent something to the Trash and emptied it only to realize moments later... OOOPS? We all have and it can happen to anyone.

Unblunder to the rescue!

Unblunder uses Mac OS X's UNIX underpinnings to hang on to files after the Trash has been emptied. When started, it runs quietly in the background and stays out of your way.

Essentially, Unblunder offers Mac OS X a much needed "Recently Deleted" feature, giving you plenty of time to recover files before they're gone forever. Note: for optimal file recovery and peace of mind, Unblunder needs to be running before an accident happens (i.e. trashing the wrong file).

By default, trashed files over 250 MB in size linger for 5 minutes and smaller files are kept for a day. Of course, you can tweak all these settings to match your work style at anytime.

You no longer need to bother with expensive, complicated file recovery software. Unblunder is much faster and more importantly, helps instantly recover your files exactly as they were when deleted -- not how they were an hour ago or a week ago.

Unblunder gives you an extra cushion of assurance when working on your Mac.
