Different 6.1 iconsï»¿
With the leak of the 6.1 icons came many themes rocking them. Although a nice icon set I wanted to take a different approach. Working with 6.1 icons, but not the ones that everyone was using, Redox was built with the means to show off the yummyness of the icon set. With never before seen icons that have been tweaked and built from the available leaked icons Redox is sure to look spectacular on your BlackBerry. Having a nice clear view of your wallpaper is not all you get. You will also get a nice big clock in the middle top of the screen with a weather slot and it sure does look good! Grab Redox today to bring something beautiful to your BlackBerry!
