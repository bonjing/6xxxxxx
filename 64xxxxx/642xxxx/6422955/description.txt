Cultural historian David Heathcote uses old travel guide books to explore modern-day Britain.

Part 2. The Classic Motorist's Way.
David Heathcote uses two of the earliest Shell Guides to explore modern-day Britain. The 1930s Shell Guide to Dorset was compiled by Paul Nash, a leading contemporary war artist, while the Guide to Cornwall was edited by the young, ambitious John Betjeman. As he travels, Heathcote explores themes of development which the Guides raise. Betjeman declared that traffic had spoilt everything by the 1960s, but Heathcote discovers a more optimistic view of the changes in Cornwall.
