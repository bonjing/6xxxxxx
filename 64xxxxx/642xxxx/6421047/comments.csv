Also doesnt work for everyone since by not having all countries available for IP generating, users are not available to hide their IPs with fake ones but geographically close, so websites such as google and facebook and stuff like that will detect logins from long-distanced places by the fake IP, and may end up giving trouble for the users with login blockage such as me when I tried google mail, using masked IP.."
