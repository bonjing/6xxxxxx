Check it out yourself, I dare you.  It's simultaneously hilarious and unsettling; hilarious for obvious reasons, and unsettling because this means some people out there see this as ""fair game"" for, well... you know.  Holy tits, it is funny though.  Oh, and thanks though, webchella.  Not clowning you or your torrent quality in any way... in fact, I thank you."

,hahalolfailmupp,2011-05-30T17:09Z,"Fast DL yesterday, great except the russian installer :) Not to hard to install though (next, next) , Windows simplicity even applies in Russian installers.
"
,Jesuskipz,2011-05-30T17:13Z,how do u install?
,Jesuskipz,2011-05-30T17:13Z,how do uz installz thiz?
,Jesuskipz,2011-05-30T17:16Z,"DOESN'T WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
file can't open as archive"
,Jesuskipz,2011-05-30T17:17Z,"It appears u need to know Russian to install this xD
hopefully I did it right :/"
,Espana25,2011-05-30T18:11Z,Yeah we all know the installer is in Russian but that doesn't mean at all that one needs to know Russian in order to get this installed on our PC's we all should have this common sense and experience of Windows usage which actually makes it quite simple to get it installed i did it even had choice folder and drives when i installed works like a charm for me good work except for getting it stucked at 95.5 for 3 days...;)
,ressy,2011-05-30T21:19Z,"Just wanted to say, in the geekiest way possible, thank you.
Downloaded in about 40 mins, ran through the Russian installer (just had to hit the question marks with an arrow next to it about 5 times), and was playing."
,Cerebral222,2011-05-31T10:01Z,"Not bad in the graphics department, looks better than I thought it would, nice upload Cheers webchella."
,_AKUMA_,2011-06-01T02:33Z,"Nothing personal against the uploader, but these russian repacks of games are typically made for only russians, making them hell for anyone who doesn't understand russian."
,_AKUMA_,2011-06-01T02:43Z,"well I was gonna post links to get these 2 games directly for people but shitty modern Pirate Bay isn't allowing them to go up, even though someone posted a link to a site with an ultra slow download link.>_"

,toenail88,2011-09-11T01:59Z,"i see hurka79 shows his life of intelligence and education, we'll leave him to his thriving command of communication skills.

btw fyi, the active mods are in TKM17\Mod\ActiveMod and can be modded with photoshop or similar, its all in jp2 format (lossless)

also ALT-R reloads the textures in each cell or room to see your changes."
,hurka79,2011-09-16T19:10Z,I don't asking you.this is my comment not your buisness shut up please
,Asreyser,2011-10-01T22:26Z,"Hurka79-- if you don't know how to speak English, stop communicating with it. Thanks : )"
,lechampion,2011-10-21T02:30Z,"No need to understand Russian language to install it.  

To install, just click on the square: ????????> until the instalation start."
,lechampion,2011-10-21T04:22Z,"After the installation, nothing appear, don't worry, it's normal. Just go at the start menu, read the list of programs and choice the title ""TKM17"" and click on the ""The Club 17"" icon to play.

,samewoody,2011-10-23T03:42Z,"one question,,, after clicking on the ?'s with the errow it stoped in one box i think its because i dont have enough free disc space...am i right? do i need more than 3 gigs of free memory to install??"
,samewoody,2011-10-24T04:28Z,i got it now but it wont get past the opening window... do i extract everything in one folder?
,12Kings,2011-10-24T17:27Z,"Probably got the same problem as samewoody: After I double click the icon it starts the launcher... Launcher doesn't show anything else, but the name and password + 2 buttons and when I press the right one the game starts, but shortly afterwards Windows gives an error and shortly afterwards it gives another one that says Error executing ""TK17 Engine.exe"""
,yaface,2011-11-21T15:50Z,"I completed the download fine, but it wont open. I am able to open up the .exe file but comes up with an error which looks like I am supposed to enter a disc or something... even if I click on the default folder that it gives me it comes up with an error in russian. please help"
,beeftv,2011-11-27T19:52Z,Don't rar split it you moron.
,beeftv,2011-11-27T21:47Z,"Worked fine for me (on windows XP).

Installer is in russian.

I don't understand a word of russian, but still it was easy enough to install. If you have ever installed any programs, it's just intuitive what buttons to press.
"
,beeftv,2011-11-27T22:16Z,"However, it's the worst software I have ever seen.

Absolutely horrible.

It's slow as hell, even on my computer that is very fast, and runs any new 3d game without problems.

The userinterface and controlls are retarded.

Absolutely useless software."
,Skwatch,2011-12-22T15:37Z,"The game installed just fine. It is exactly what it says it is. But I am having technical issues with the game itself. I tried the forums on the publisher's site, but no luck. Can anybody tell me why it won't export the videos I create? Or why I can't get the modeling to work right?"
,kaskaro,2012-01-14T07:30Z,Seed everyone... thnx
,LymphN0de,2012-01-19T06:24Z,"After I renamed all the rars I was able to extract lol. Said the name was too long? Anyways nothing too big, installing it now."
