RenÃ© Laloux - La PlanÃ¨te Sauvage AKA The Fantastic Planet [+Extras] (1973)


RenÃ© Lalouxâ€™s mesmerising psychedelic sci-fi animated feature won the Grand Prix at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival and is a landmark of European animation. Based on Stefan Wulâ€™s novel Oms en sÃ©rie [Oms by the dozen], Lalouxâ€™s breathtaking vision was released in France as La PlanÃ¨te sauvage [The Savage Planet]; in the USA as Fantastic Planet; and immediately drew comparisons to Swiftâ€™s Gulliverâ€™s Travels and Planet of the Apes (both the 1968 film and Bouleâ€™s 1963 novel). Today, the film can be seen to prefigure much of the work of Hayao Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli (Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away) due to its palpable political and social concerns, cultivated imagination, and memorable animation techniques.

Fantastic Planet tells the story of â€œOmsâ€, human-like creatures, kept as domesticated pets by an alien race of blue giants called â€œDraagsâ€. The story takes place on the Draagsâ€™ planet Ygam, where we follow our narrator, an Om called Terr, from infancy to adulthood. He manages to escape enslavement from a Draag learning device used to educate the savage Oms â€” and begins to organise an Om revolt. The imagination invested in the surreal creatures, music and sound design, and eerie landscapes, is immense and unforgettable.

Widely regarded as an allegorical statement on the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, Fantastic Planet was five years in the making at Pragueâ€™s Jiri Trnka Studios. The direction of RenÃ© Laloux, the incredible art of Roland Topor, and Alain Goraguerâ€™s brilliantly complementary score (much sampled by the hip-hop community) all combine to make Fantastic Planet a mind-searing experience. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to release Fantastic Planet on DVD in the UK for the first time.
