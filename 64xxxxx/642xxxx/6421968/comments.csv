That is the license key (for 4) I've used right out of the lobby client same as in the .txt file. When you copy/paste make sure you dont accidently select any spaces that might be found in the .txt only highlight the serial."

,theblacklisted,2011-05-27T06:46Z,what's wrong with that ? i really want to play online !
,ryuth,2011-05-27T13:59Z,"Uhm I've never seen that error or cant find anything about it there is a ""Game version incorrect"" error if you try to join a game of a different version, tbh online play is not that great. You can connect to someone hosting if you know their ip, I wouldnt mind doing an online game, the quickest ways to get ahold of me are facebook, and irc."
