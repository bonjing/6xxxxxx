I had the same problem (with both vlc and kmplayer). No solution other than just watching it in one go.
Anyway thanks for the movie. "

I am having the same problem when trying with VLC. When playing with The KMPlayer and using the jump/seek function, then the picture is messed up for a few seconds. I consider this file partly corrupt. But if you play it from start to end without interruption, the movie can be watched."
,gaaraisgod,2011-05-29T23:36Z,I have that same movie stopping problem with seeking. But it stays stuck for a couple of seconds. After that it starts playing from the chosen point.
