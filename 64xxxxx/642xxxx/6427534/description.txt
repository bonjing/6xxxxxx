Reviewby Matt Collar (AMG):
Pat Metheny by himself with an acoustic guitar - for longtime fans it might not get any better. Always interested in blending jazz with folk and pop, the guitarist does just that, focusing heavily on the folk end of things on One Quiet Night. Featuring a nice afterglow interpretation of Norah Jones\' hit \"Don\'t Know Why\" and an unexpected reinterpretation of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\" which turns the Gerry & the Pacemakers classic into a poignant lament, the album also showcases Metheny as a melodic pop composer. \"Song for the Boys\" sounds surprisingly like an instrumental take on early-\'80s British pop Ã  la the Smiths, while \"Last Train Home\" brilliantly mixes Metheny\'s knack for taking simple chord progressions and beautifully tweaking them with odd harmonies. Perhaps a bit light for some straight-ahead jazz fans, listeners interested in thoughtful, folky, jazz-inflected ballads will find this rapturous.
