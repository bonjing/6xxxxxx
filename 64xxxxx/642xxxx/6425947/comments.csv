Hopefully the stress on that will decrease as others start seeding it tomorrow."
,NvUAjax,2011-06-03T09:58Z,"Please help!

Afther 90% of downloading, with a speed of 700kb/s, i download with 1kb/s can anybody help me?"
,undaunt,2011-06-04T03:45Z,"Sorry about that NvUAjax, I moved across state and had no internet for a few days, and I was the only one seeding.

I'm seeding again, and a few other people should hit 100% very shortly to help spread the torrent faster."
,reidabob,2011-08-15T10:35Z,"700 kb/s!? That's outrageous! I'm lucky to get 100 kb/s! Man, where do you live, I want to move there."
,ErrantVenture09,2011-08-24T04:44Z,@reidabob I get about 5.6 mb/s at the best of times. Gotta love that big-city fiber connection ^___^
,eXoflow,2011-11-29T16:23Z,Thanks a lot! Will download season 1 and seed!
