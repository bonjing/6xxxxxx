,Novanity1,2011-05-25T18:34Z,This is my biggest upload yet. Let's seed the shit outta this people!
,lstudio2,2011-05-25T21:01Z,How about keeping it for downloadin?
,Novanity1,2011-05-25T21:21Z,....?
,lstudio2,2011-05-25T22:47Z,"I don't see any seeders/downloaders.
Please do the same againg as beginning, but keep on seding it. It make do some while, thanks."
,Novanity1,2011-05-25T23:46Z,"I just uploaded it today, TPB doesn't update the seeders very quickly. I'm seeding off of two different computers right now and uTorrent is telling me there are 7 seeders and 54 peers so far. Pretty good start I guess."
,lobyhuy,2011-05-26T19:09Z,Transmission 1.54(OSX) must not be up to latest standards or something (it's the latest I can use on a PPC). A lot of TPB torrents (incl this one) don't work at all - I get a 4xx error message returned from the tracker. Other sites' torrents always work fine...
,lstudio2,2011-05-26T20:50Z,"It works like a dream (in Intel), thanks again!"
,PI22,2011-07-26T01:45Z,"I think I could kiss you if you were a woman and give you a friendly hug if you were a man.
Fantastic, I was hoping I could have my hands on this beautiful tool for a long time. Y'all got yourself another regular seeder!
Thanks again, looking forward to use it tomorra."
,Tigersjappa,2011-08-02T20:05Z,"On OS X Lion the ""Go Back"" and ""Continue"" buttons is grayed out in the installation. Anyone know how to get pass that?"
,drewny75,2011-08-12T05:37Z,"@Tigersjappa

I had the same problem but got around it by manually installing the packages, right click, ""show contents"" etc.  Then I reopened the installer and the continue button was appearing.  Not sure why  or how this fixed the problem but but it did.  Hope this helps."
,Novanity1,2011-09-08T03:13Z,Sorry guys I haven't tested this on OS X Lion. I use Pro Tools 8 which isn't compatible with Lion so you're on your own with that :/
,jlird808,2012-02-07T17:44Z,"Man I bet you'd have more seeders in you'd spelled ""Altiverb"" right lol. I found this in a round about way and got lucky...most ppl wont look that hard."
,jlird808,2012-02-27T16:00Z,Quick question....will the IR library work for the PC version?
