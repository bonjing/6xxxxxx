Taken from http://deadmau5.com:

â€˜Raise Your Weaponâ€™ was without a doubt one of the highlights from deadmau5â€²s recent album â€™4Ã—4=12â€². The track has now been revisualised by Stimming, Noisia and Madeon.

The Stimming remix strips the track back to a minimal-tech affair, highlighting the vocals and adding a sprinkling of live instruments; the Noisia mix delves deep into the bassbins with its gnarly dubstep; whilst the Madeon mix translates the track into a glitchy Gallic electro number.



This album was purchases from iTunes and reencoded to mp3 at with the same audio properties.

Enjoy the weaponry.
