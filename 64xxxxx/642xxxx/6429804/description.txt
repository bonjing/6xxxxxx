Ladies and gentlemen, Iâ€™m delighted to announce the release of the long-awaited 2011 Fat Loss Bible update! Hereâ€™s a taste of what the new book contains:
Six extra chapters! The old FLB contained 16 chapters â€“ the new version contains 22 chapters plus an appendix!
Extra information in every chapter! Starting with Chapter 1, which describes even more research blasting the â€œmetabolic advantageâ€ myth to smithereens, right through to the final new chapters about protein, fat, ketogenic diets and intermittent fasting, the book contains a wealth of new information that will leave you stunned. Iâ€™m not exaggerating in the slightest when I state that reading FLB will give you a fat loss knowledge base that totally blows away the so-called wisdom of most fat loss â€œexpertsâ€.
An extra chapter in the eternally popular Section 1 of the book, debunking three more weight loss myths!
