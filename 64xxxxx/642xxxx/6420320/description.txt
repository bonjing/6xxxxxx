Changes:

- Changed Brightness and Contrast
- Changed the Hue and Saturation
- Created Shadow and Highlighting, improved the night scenes dramatically   where everything that was lost by the original cam was brought back into   the video (water scenes at night were really hard to see before, not   anymore, noticed a lot of complaints here and elsewhere about the night   scenes)
- Increased Levels, to reduce the blur, tried sharpening but it came out 
  pixelated so i left it as it was not to ruin the viewability
- Stripped the audio out 4410Khz Wave, ran it thru a my music editing program
  to improve audio quality, recombined with the original at 320kbps/48000.

To the Haters/Leechers/Hit and Runners:

- Its free
- I worked hard on this, so much i was actually working on the first one that showed where dudes way in the back seat and can't sit still with the camera and doesnt know what zoom is. I had that one almost completely stabalized and rendered when the TS one popped up. That version took me almost 8 hours to tear apart with After Effects and piece by piece resize, center, rotate to make that one at least watchable. Props to TS for a nice release, was getting worried cuz Hop and Rango had bad flickers and was worried about their gear failing them. This was pretty good for a release, this kick in the bum helps it a lot.
- Shut up and go eat a sandwich you fat waste of my time.
