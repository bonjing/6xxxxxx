check Heraklers rip of Indiana Jones, he did the whole quadrilogy around 700mb in this same format.. I already downloaded it and it's good.

@SRKhan, give those first three some time they just came out this year dude.. But Arthur would be a good one."
,xD1337x,2011-05-30T05:37Z,"Why you don't make the sound 5.1 baffles me. You have the best resolution, and size for the video, and adding in 2 channel sound is a disgrace to your releases.
Until you release 5.1, you won't be as big of a releaser as you could be. HDScene puts out 5.1 and they're very popular, even though your video quality is superior. 
If people are going to download a 700MB movie, they're not going to mind another 75-150MB or whatever it takes."
,pocoha55,2011-06-03T04:11Z,Great Quality
,MyFootHurts,2011-06-21T22:12Z,"@xD1337x
That's just your opinion. If you want a rip with 5.1 sound, go get one. Those of us who prefer 2 channel will stay here.

ps. the reason yify aren't as popular as some, I think, is that there are still so many retards out there downloading xvid."
,softcorelightmetalman,2012-06-03T01:50Z,"i love english subtitles.

YOUR UPLOADS ARE THE BEST.

THANK YOU YIFY"
