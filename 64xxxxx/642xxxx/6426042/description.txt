Storyline:
Little DJ has suspicions about the house across the street and the cranky old man who lives there.
When the old man has a heart attack and is carried away by an ambulance, DJ thinks the danger is over.
Unfortunately, as he, his friend Chowder, and a candy-selling prep-school girl named Jenny discover, the house itself has plans--plans that
include eating all the kids who'll be trick-or-treating that Halloween night!
