,rockstar172,2011-05-26T02:57Z,Thanks boss..  was waiting for you to post this. =)
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T06:34Z,"@rohitpal: That's NOT what you have said, moron.
You bitched about fucked up resolution of 352p.

Do NOT invent further stupidities and embarrass yourself. 
You can go away, right?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T18:54Z,"@shailesh417: But it does make me better man.

BTW - do FORGET your anti-psychotic drugs.  You forget things ALREADY (as seen) and defending morons like yourself cannot make you - better. Only in cuckoo's land where you are now."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T16:53Z,"You still don't get it by now...

""rohitpal at 2011-05-25 14:24 CET: 
 Thanks but f'd up video resolution for 350MB ver.""

350 MB version is 352p.

I have learned that some nations can't tell word Sorry.
Instead of telling that, for second time you rather try to ""divert"" what you have been said.

Don't be more mad for calling morons as morons."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T20:15Z,Wow! Small man makes big noise. For nothing. 
,varun120,2012-03-05T09:15Z,"Who are twentyforty haters? Really (-19)?
This guy is the best uploader on tpb. I ditch Yify's uploads, if twentyforty has uploaded the same. 
Fuck you all haters.
