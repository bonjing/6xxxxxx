This early effort by altoist Greg Osby (who doubles on soprano) matches him with pianist Michele Rosewoman, guitarist Kevin McNeal, bassist Lonnie Plaxico, and either Terri Lyne Carrington or Paul Samuels on drums. Two songs add Fusako Yoshikda on koto. The performances (mostly Osby originals) are complex, somewhat abrasive, and in the M-Base genre, swinging in their own funky fashion and following a different logic than bebop. Osby plays quite well, and the music grows in interest with each listen.
