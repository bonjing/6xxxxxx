I recommend it just as highly as I do this book. It's shorter and more concise than Zen and the Psychology of Transformation and is more focused on the nature of God and metaphysics, whereas Zen and the Psychology of Transformation is more focused on the human psychological condition. However, both books are about all 3 of the mentioned topics as how they relate to each other."
