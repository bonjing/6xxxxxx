This book is a truly masterful piece of literature and is a must read for anybody interested in Zen or the study of human consciousness. Most Zen masters refuse to discuss the discipline or explain it. Hubert Benoit takes the opposite, and for the intellectually-inclined seeker, the more accessible path, and discusses Zen in exhaustive detail in terms of psychology and philosophy
Benoit writes at an extremely high level of abstraction (something quite alien to traditional Zen, which deals mainly in parables) and practically every word he writes rings with utter truth and fidelity to the workings of consciousness. He is clearly a man who has absorbed the Zen teachings and then examined the workings of his own mind with unfailing rigor and perceptiveness; he has taken those findings and translated them into language with a care and accuracy that nobody else, to my knowledge, has ever matched. The results are utterly profound. I urge you to take a look at this book for yourself. It is a unique and amazing work which gives solid practical meaning to Zen philosophy, and to the mysteries of the mind.
