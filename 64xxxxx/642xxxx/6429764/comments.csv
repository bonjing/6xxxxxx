,Selfrot,2011-06-12T23:10Z,"Could use some seeds.
Avg.; of 0.3kb/s download. I my self is running a dedicated server, websites, forums, etc -- on my connection and I still have enough to seed, why aren't you guys who've actually downloaded the Torrent - seeding? It doesn't take shit to seed 10kb/s."
,Selfrot,2011-06-13T21:42Z,"Avg download is still kinda low minding that the file size is; 9.65GB. 20DB and still getting only 67.9674KB/s. 

If 20 poeple were to seed 20KB/s which doesn't take much at all, we would get 400KB/s download.

So those of you who don't give a fuck about anyone but yourselves -> Delete the Torrent file from your downloader. And for those of you who can actually put yourself in my situation where there's no seeders and I have to write this stupid message just to prove my point -> seed.

Remember when you were stuck on 90% download and there were more leechers than seeders? It makes you mad, it makes you go crazy and wanna kill all the leechers in the world, well, put a stop to it and always contribute 2.0 Ratio. In time we can make a difference.

Think about it."
,Selfrot,2011-06-13T21:44Z,"I'll get back with a review and I will seed 2.0ratio if the Torrent is any good. If it is; thank you ""bobnjeff"" for sharing it!"
,Selfrot,2011-06-14T19:02Z,"Download rating; 1/10
Movie rating; 7/10
Audio; 7/10 (Good for being Hi Def)
Video; 15/10 (Extremly good for being an old movie)

Thanks to Bob for sharing. Definitely worth the wait."
