A brilliant collaboration from Ray Manzarek, co-founder and keyboardist of The Doors, and Roy Rogers, world renowned slide guitar master and Grammy winning producer. Translucent Blues is a hard driving, blues, rock and jazz inflected effort; a fresh, contemporary recording bristling with soul, intensity and creative energy. The album features songs with multi-layered arrangements, solid driving grooves and stylistic depth. They are energetic and strong - with music and lyric collaborations from Manzarek and Rogers, and lyric contributions from the likes of Warren Zevon and Jim Carroll.
