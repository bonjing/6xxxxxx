I will try to dl and will seed as long as I can. I am performing hard drive partition recovery and will have to change drives when / if I get the other one fixed. 
But I will download this and seed at least two days and maybe for several weeks if possible.
Thanks for the upload.
If anyone uses, comment on any problems. I may change and try this on a spare hard drive."
