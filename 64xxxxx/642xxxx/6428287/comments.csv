[T],ADHDerby,2011-05-29T00:33Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ rayquest9: You can have both PowerDVD 10 and 11 installed on one system. If you're satisfied with PowerDVD 11 you can always uninstall PowerDVD 10."

@ Night_89: Skin Pack for PowerDVD 11 build 1719 - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6434000

@ LittleCowGD: The only things I know that could fix it are updating your video and audio card drivers :S

@ BadGamer007: You can edit the dll's with a resource hacker (I'm using Restorator 2007)
I've removed the Feature Icons and the New DVD Release section from the resume page by editing XML\PRELOADSKIN.XML
You can change the backgrounds by replacing IMAGE\INITIAL\PDVD_1280X1024.PNG, PDVD_1280X800.PNG and INITIALPDVD_1280X720.PNG

@ rayquest9: I personally prefer PowerDVD 11, but it has some nasty bugs on some systems.
Just try if it works correctly and if you like it, you can always uninstall PowerDVD 10 later."
,rayquest9,2011-05-30T23:04Z,"resource hacker (I'm using Restorator 2007)

[T],ADHDerby,2011-06-06T14:30Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ Moamma: Try re-installing PowerDVD with admin rights, the same applies for the batch files (right click and select ""Run as Administrator"")"
,Dixon_Butz,2011-06-11T13:32Z,Audio settings still don't stick. Back to 10.

,WiR3D-kNiGhT,2011-06-14T16:34Z,"Brilliant thanks,
Any ideas how to access the codecs for use in KMPlayer or MPC-HC ?"
,WiR3D-kNiGhT,2011-06-14T17:04Z,"EDIT: 
C:\Program Files (x86)\CyberLink\PowerDVD11\Common

Thats where all the codecs are, and if you manually search you can add and use the video codec without any problems. hoever the audio codec seems to have significantly reduced functionality.

Just note i added(Video):
 * - CLCvd.ax
 * - CLLine21.ax
 * - CLTzan.ax

and tried Claud.ax for audio"

,handelaar,2011-06-19T16:47Z,"ADHDerby,
Works great but only when I close the programm Kaspersky reports me every time: 

riskware: Invader started proces (PID: 1196): C:\WINDOWS\System32\svchost.exe 
do you know why I get this message everytime?"
,s.lanso,2011-06-26T06:18Z,Thanks needed one to play Blue-rays. And this was the recommended.
,snoopy9,2011-07-04T16:09Z,"Beautiful, thank you.   I just watched a 3d bluray disc with this, using my nvidia 3d vision kit. Worked like a charm."
,jaiskorpio,2011-07-10T21:42Z,"When I install it, it has 0 region changes left. I'm Region B and need to change it. The tweak for resetting doesn't work, even when I install and run PDVD11 as Admin and the tweat as Admin. What am I doing wrong? I'm in UK and need Region B please!"
,jaiskorpio,2011-07-13T21:46Z,Still unable to change BD region code. I've tried running as admin and the tweak will not work. PreActivated for Yanks only! Tried disabling startup apps and every combination with the reset BD region code tweak. At my wits end with this one.
[T],ADHDerby,2011-07-17T16:34Z,"Sorry for the late reply,.. I was on vacation in Switzerland. :)

@ handelaar: It's a false positive, add PowerDVD to the Exception List and the message should be gone.  

@ jaiskorpio: They changed the BD region storage location (registry and data files)
I've updated the Blu-Ray Region Reset batch file: http://www.XXXload.com/file/59572983/Blu-Ray_Region_Reset.bat (replace XXX with wup)
Run the batch file and then reinstall PowerDVD"

and then uninstalled and installed this version and I had 5 resets however after choosing A and then closing and starting up I had 4 and then I wanted to try if reset worked so I ran the reset bat and now I have 0 resets???"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-08-27T10:55Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ VistaHell: Make sure that you installed the latest video and audio card drivers

@ b10lee: I'll look into it

@ ObserverJLin: This release (= newer version)

@ SoWErA: First run the region reset batch file and then reinstall PowerDVD, you'll need to repeat this to get 5 resets"

You seem like a nice chap. I'm looking for new friends that got ADHD. Hopefully your Swedish too :)

,nazim12,2011-10-17T22:46Z,"@ADHDerby : Its work fantastic , i have compared it with KMP the only difference is KMP is very fast and its has a wide variety of settings but PD is  very simple , just only one or two clicks thats it, but believe me i have searched PD for 100 times but unable to find this thing which you have said in Read Me ..Sets the cursor hide time in Full Screen to 1 sec (default = 3)...but HOW??? and one more thing which bother me when we click on full screen but the BORDERS of PD took long time to HIDE about 4 to 5 sec and how can we set it to half sec i want whenever i hit the full screen it should open without PD Menu Bars ."
,SoccerIgbo,2011-11-04T01:00Z,Works as advertised. however it makes my DVD look very grainy and a bit worse than playing them on vlc or mpc
