,sudamander,2011-06-26T18:11Z,Is this an H2O version? Cracked version?
,sudamander,2011-06-27T10:22Z,"OK... it's an H2O version. Installs v3.02 fine, but doesn't seem to update to v3.11. Any feedback on this?"
,warrennocos,2011-08-18T03:29Z,Is this a crack? installer? patch? or whatever? I'm just curious about it's size. It's too small compared to the 5.1 version which is 3gB+. Did anybody try this? How is it and is it working? Thanks. Reply ASAP that I may decide to download this or not.
