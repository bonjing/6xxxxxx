Release Title No Strings Attached 2011 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Ivan Reitman
Tagline Occasionally in the 15 years since summer camp, Adam and Emma cross paths. When he
discovers that an ex-girlfriend is living with his dad, he gets drunk, calls every woman in his
cell phone contact list, and ends up passed out naked in her living room. By this time, she's a
medical resident in L.A. and he's a gopher on a "Glee"-like TV series, hoping to be a writer.
She guards her emotions (calling her father's funeral "a thing"), so after a quick shag in the
moments she has before leaving for the hospital, she asks if he wants a no-strings-attached,
sex-only relationship, without romance or complications. A prescription for fun or for disaster?
