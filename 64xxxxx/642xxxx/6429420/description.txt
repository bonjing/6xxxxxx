This is the Official pWnOS 1.0 download from Heorot.net. pWnOS is a linux virtual machine intentionally configured with exploitable services to provide you with a path to r00t. :) Currently, the virtual machine NIC is configured in bridged networking, so it will obtain a normal IP address on the network you are connected to. You can easily change this to NAT or Host Only if you desire. A quick ping sweep will show the IP address of the virtual machine.


Enjoy and seed.
