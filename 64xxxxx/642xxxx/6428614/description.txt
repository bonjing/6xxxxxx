British TV icon Gerry Anderson is the mastermind behind this adventure series. The World Aquanaut Security 
Patrol (WASP) and Stingray are underwater peacekeepers in the year 2065. Capt. Troy Tempest heads the crew 
of this high-tech sub that includes co-pilot George Lee Sheridan and the alluring mermaid Marina -- and, 
above the sea, Cmdr. Sam Shore and his daughter Atlanta -- all of whom are battling the villainous Titan.
