Inventive, playful and utterly engrossing, Celebration Florida has much to revel in. **** 
CD Description
"Celebration, Florida" is The Felice Brothers' fourth LP. Recorded in the gymnasium and theatre of Beacon, NY's old high school, the band explore a multitude of sounds and instrumentation throughout the expansive album. It's inspired, imaginative, heady, menacing, passionate, and rollicking. Most importantly, it's as steadfastly authentic as ever, expanding upon the dark, woozy undercurrent of ramshackle barroom blues, vaudevillian atmospherics, and surreal storytelling of their previous albums
