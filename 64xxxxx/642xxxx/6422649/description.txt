A great show for little kids, about 2-5 - very peaceful and pleasant. Based on the Maurice Sendak books. I downloaded a few of these about 2 years ago, and ripped the rest from library DVDs and VHS tapes. Decent quality - the preschoolers definitely won\'t mind!

Based on the terrific Little Bear books illustrated by Maurice Sendak and written by Else Holmelund Minarik, this charming animated series is about the warm cocoon childhood should be. It traces the spirited adventures of curious, imaginative and inventive Little Bear and his friends. As Little Bear explores the world, curiosity and imagination lead to exploration, experience and independence.
