,{HMP},2011-07-07T00:50Z,"THIS TORRENT IS A WIND UP.

DOWNLOADS PERFECT ( TILL YOU GET TO 97.7%

THEN THE DOWNLOAD SPEED DROPS TO 1.1KBPS (JUST LIKE THE LAST TIME I DOWNLOADED THIS)

I LOST MY DISC SO HAD TO DOWNLOAD AGAIN !!

WHEN YOU GET TO 97.7% AND THE DOWNLOAD SPEED DROPS TO 1.1KBPS, YOU THEN HAVE TO RESTART YOUR TORRENT CLIENT AND IN MOST CASES YOU HAVE TO RESTART YOUR BROADBAND ROUTER.

WHEN THE TORRENT CLIENT RESTARTS AND THE ROUTER RESTARTS IT THEN DOWNLOADS PERFECTLY ( TILL YOU GET TO 99.9%)

THEN...... RESTART BOTH THE TORRENT CLIENT AND ROUTER AND CONTINUE WITH DOWNLOAD

AFTER ABOUT 20 MINS AT 99.9% THE TORRENT GOES "" BACKWARDS "" AND ROLLS  BACK TO 97.7%

BASICLY....... IF YA GOING NO PLACE FOR A WHILE JUST PUT UP WITH IT AND AVENTUALY YOU WILL GET YOUR TORRENT (DOWNLOAD)

WHATS STRANGE ABOUT THIS TORRENT IS...... ALLTHOUGH THE DOWNLOAD SPEED DROPS TO 1.1KBPS THE UPLOAD SPEED OF THIS TORRENT (ON MY COMPUTER WAS 1.5MB)

I WAS UPLOADING WAY MORE THAN I WAS DOWNLOADING {{ LIKE IT HAD BEEN SET THAT WAY }}

USUALY AS A RULE..... MUSIC FROM "" THE CUT UP BOYS "" IS LIKE DOWNLOADING A VIDEO FILE FROM THE OLD TIMER "" aXXo ""

BASICLY..... PERFECT QUALITY !!!


SO WHAT HAPPENED GUYS ????

ALSO,,,,, WHY NOT JUST SIMPLY RIP BOTH CDS THEN UPLOAD ??  

FAIR ENOUGH..... HAVE SPLIT FILES AND THEN INCLUDE THE "" JOINED "" MP3 TRACKS ???


ALL IM GONNA SAY IS....... DOWNLOAD IF YOU GOT PLENTY OF SPARE TIME ON YA HANDS !!!


PS, I'VE NEVER ONCE COMMENTED ON SOMEBODY ELSES TORRENT "" TILL NOW ""

IM SORRY BUT IT WOUND ME UP SO MUCH I HAD TO COMMENT. 

I WAS CURSING THE TORRENT (AND YOU)


SOMETIMES FILES BECOME CORRUPT AS WE ALL KNOW. 

I JUST WANTED TO LET OTHERS KNOW TO SAVE THEM THE TIME "" AND EFFORT "" DOWNLOADING "" A POSSIBLE TORRENT ""
