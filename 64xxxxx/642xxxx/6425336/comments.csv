And the torrent also contains a couple of zipfiles of a program which is called ""invoiceman"" along with a keygen with a trojan (according to norton).  Total waste of of time and bandwith. As far as I know Tekla 17 licenceserver is not cracked yet. The uploader should check his stuff a bit better!"
