
VÃ¶lva plays a vintage style of stoner/doom mixed with some deep psyschedelic elements. Heavy, downtuned Sabbathian riffs, occasionally with sludgy vocals in the likes of Eyehategod/ Weedeater. The lengthy last track (18 minutes) really smoked my brain with instrumentals reminicient of the hypnotic driven OM vibe. Aside from the great influences, VÃ¶lva crafted a really honest & true sound. So go ahead & check out what Iceland has to offer with this piece of gloomy doom, you won't be disappointed..
