,Murdster,2011-05-28T00:45Z,Can't thank you enough. You're the soundtrack king.
,Danny91,2011-05-30T13:53Z,Now if only someone could get a good torrent of the movie itself up...sigh
,OrpheusDude,2011-05-31T23:03Z,"In my 50-some years, I have never been so excited about seeing a new film.  This album will have to tide me over until the film opens in Europe.  Many, many thanks!"
,thumpybass,2011-06-18T23:48Z,@Danny91 This is a film that needs to be seen in a theater. I would gladly pay to watch this again.
,tony419,2011-06-19T12:41Z,Now this is how excited about seeing this movie. It aint out in my country or on the net but i'm already downloading the OST! Amazing! Thanks!
,josquin,2011-07-04T13:06Z,"Thanks for this great music.  I agree this film must be seen in a cinema, and I'm planning to see it for the second time soon."
,AS9292,2011-07-07T04:02Z,"Don't understand why people keep insisting that this needs to be seen in a theater. The quality of most movie theater projections sucks, frankly. This is a film that needs to be seen on Blu Ray!"
