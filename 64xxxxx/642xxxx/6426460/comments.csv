,click4dylan,2011-05-29T05:43Z,"obviously, i've packed it myself. not sure why others are STILL downloading my old torrent like crazy when all they'll get is problem ingame that cause connection issues. ive written all over that torrent to tell people to update to the latest patch but pretty much nobody has other than the few people i talk to ingame"
,dsafjaly69,2011-05-29T18:11Z,Multiplayer only???
,jellisunc,2011-06-02T00:43Z,no input file specified ?
,click4dylan,2011-06-03T16:17Z,"yeah i've removed the button for single player because everyone that downloads the game only plays single player. if you insist on playing single player you can still go into the console and type map m1_austria01

Also, you can still play the missions in cooperative with players on multiplayer servers"
,Dick12,2011-10-11T01:11Z,"Why the hell would you remove the singleplayer button if most people want to play single player? Also, I can't even get to the console by pressing tilde, I just press random keys, and it eventually pops up, but I can't ever get it back. It doesn't make any sense to me why you would remove the single player button, why not just tell people to play multiplayer as well?"
