This is my latest torrent of James Bond 007: Nightfire, the follow up to my previous torrent. This release includes the v5.3 patch from www.NORULEZ.net pre-installed to ensure that you do not experience any connection issues, crashes, or lag while playing online. You can also download tons of new mods and maps, and get newer updates from the website as well. Please use this torrent rather than my old one or install the latest patch from www.norulez.net if you have the game already or are using another torrent. THANKS FOR DOWNLOADING AND HELP US GET MORE PLAYERS! The in-game developer console is enabled automatically in this release as well.

INSTALL DIRECTIONS: 

1: Unzip (preferably to) C:\Program Files\EA Games or to C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games

2: Go to www.NORULEZ.net or www.NORULEZ.tk to check if there is a newer patch available. Don't use the official 1.1 patch from EA because it causes multiplayer to not work. Only use community-developed patches because they have been developed over the course of the game's lifetime to fix problems that EA/Gearbox completely ignored. 

3: Create a shortcut to Bond.exe on your desktop, or simply run Bond.exe

4 (Optional): Visit www.nfbsp.com to get new multiplayer maps.
