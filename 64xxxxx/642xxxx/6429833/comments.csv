,rumadb_9632,2011-05-28T22:54Z,"@ a$$h0le of vampirat:
We are from a collectors community and we know little bit about encoding. We've researched a lot on this man's work and finally graded him.
If you can't show respect, atleast don't spread dart on the art ..."

Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."

@abj642: Hi my friend. I haven't watched that movie, but as I've heard, is good, better than IMdB implies...

,rumadb_9632,2011-05-29T01:33Z,"@abj642: Seems you've embarrassed yourself much more than me by jumping on a running train and now everybody is doubting on you. You may be the good one but don't have common sense of not interfering to others discussions. Advise is free - I know, but keep it with you. Otherwise you'll go mad copy-pasting the history to prove your innocence."

Red Riding Trilogy [2009]-480p-BRrip-x264-*******
been done by somebody in 877mb torrent
some ppl dont like other ppl's links been shared on here.. 
so u better try ""SEARCH"""
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-29T04:36Z,"It's a DARK movie (or if you prefer, darkly ethereal)--meaning Catherine Hardwick shot it that way.  Quality of both 352p and 720p versions are comparable--very little practical difference with VLC on a 17"" CRT.  Details show up surprisingly well, though.  Deserves better IMDB rating."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T07:03Z,"@vampirat: It was pretty late last night when I have read morons's response and I was thinking how crazies ARE well aware how much of them is out there, representing themselves as ""We are collectors community"". Puplone, who is a good guy, mistakingly haven't read what moron has been saying. Later, divisive force of ""We, the collectors"" caused confusion and somehow good guys appear as bad ones. Fact is that you, abj642 and puplone are on the same side. 
""We, the collectors"" is mentally ill person who pressed ""minus"" eight times already, and these guys should be left alone to vent themselves out. You can prove nothing to insane persons.

And - abj642 IS my friend, one of three people who make This possible and one of only 11 people who helped me when I wasn't be able to help myself.


@abj642: Sorry my friend. But, you've seen that before. Accept my apologies for any dark thoughts this caused."
,abj642,2011-05-29T08:34Z,"@20-40
dont worry my friend....
nothing to apologize here.... yes we have seen it before many times...

you and me know that some persons' comments are never going to change what you are me  think or do"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T08:41Z,"@puplone: Nope, you are not the object and there is no real fight. Sane people shouldn't mess with crazies.

However - picking of the side is a good thing, right? Playing middleman of sort very often make one closer to Nay-sayers.

Letting people know of which stuff one is made of...

 It doesn't have to be ""my side""- but it does separate the wheat from the chaff."
,banukaknight,2011-05-29T08:43Z,"@vampirat
totally get the point.
no worries

@GOD.
i believe in Buddhism"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T09:07Z,"@azrielle: In this specific case, 352p could be a really bad choice for people with LCD or big displays.
As stated above, [ipod.5.5.itouch.nokia.N97] tag in 352p's name should be taken seriously. Not to bother you with technical details, but almost ALL H264 ""trademarks"" must be switched OFF because of compatibility, what compromise quality too much to be nice looking on LCD or big displays. "
,banukaknight,2011-05-29T09:07Z,"@GOD. & anybody els who's concerned.
