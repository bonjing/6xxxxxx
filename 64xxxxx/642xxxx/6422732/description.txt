    "Moner Manush" is an Indo-Bangladesh joint venture based on Sunil Gangopadhyayâ€™s novel on Lalan Fakir where Prosenjit Chatterjee will play the lead. Bangladeshi producer Habibur Rehman Khan has joined hands with Kolkata producer Goutam Kundu to make this film. â€œKhanâ€™s Ashirbad Chalchitra had also produced Ritwik Ghatakâ€™s Titas Ekti Nadir Naam and Gautam's Padma Nadir Majhi. Besides improving bilateral ties, joint ventures increase a filmâ€™s market. It also means having to take an almost equal number of cast and crew from both countries.
