Crazybump is a neat tool that creates Normal Maps, Displacement Maps as well as Bump Maps from ordinary textures. It is incredibly helpful for making realistic materials with tons of detail, especially when you're designing stuff for games or mods, where keeping geometry detail as low as possible is always an issue.

Just download the 30 day trial, install it, copy the cb_crack.exe file to the installation directory and use that file to start Crazybump instead of the CrazyBump.exe. Every time you start it, it will automatically reset your evaluation period to the full 30 days.
