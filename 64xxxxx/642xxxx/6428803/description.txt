Times are tough at the Sisters of Mercy hospital. Cutbacks have hit every department. And the first to go are subsidies for student nurses. But the nurses come up with an ingenious solution. At night they become Night Nurses. Check into Intensive, as Toni Enlish discovers that these days the beds have to be filled--and patients have to be satisfied. And with Asia Carerra as your therapist, you know you'll be having more than your tonsils pulled. The doctor will see you now. The Night Nurses will see you tonight.
