"The One that Got Away"

Jay wants nothing more than to have a quiet 
birthday out fishing on the lake, but the 
family take that as him wanting a big 
celebration, and in their frantic scramble to 
put everything together, Claire and Mitchell 
wind up trapped in the yard of their 
childhood home; Phil runs into his old 
college nemesis while at the mall with Gloria 
and Lily; Cameron gets himself into some hot 
water at the bakery, and the kids frantically 
do some creative editing on grandpa's 
birthday video, all of which leaves Jay with 
a headache.

Enjoy :)
