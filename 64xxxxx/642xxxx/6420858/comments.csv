[T],DBaum23,2011-05-25T12:05Z,Your right.  The encoder mislabeled them and I did not catch it when I posted it here.  The real Part 1 will be uploaded soon.  TPB still has editing disabled so I can not change the description or the title.

Twelve-year-old Shanda Sharer was brutally murdered in 1992 and four teenage girls were convicted of the horrific crime. In the heart-pounding conclusion, and for the first time on national television, Shandaâ€™s mother, Jacque, and sister, Paije, confront Hope Rippey, one of her killers. Will she at long last acknowledge the pain and suffering sheâ€™s caused? Can Jacque and Paije find forgiveness? What ownership will Hope admit to from that night? Donâ€™t miss this emotional confrontation. And, could this tragedy have been prevented?"
