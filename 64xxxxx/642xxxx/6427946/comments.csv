,The.Real.Zer0,2011-07-10T02:05Z,"I downloaded and mounted all images, installed, now when i have any disk in the tray and click play it tells me i have the wrong disk in the drive....what did i do wrong?  I invested 4 dvd's into this and a bunch of my time so someone please respond fast, I'm trying to download a different no disk patch to see if i did something wrong"
,Asachina,2011-07-10T20:18Z,"Personnally, I replaced the Sims.exe file that I downloaded in this torrent, and replaced the file that was inside C:\Program Files\Maxis\The Sims, after the installation and it worked. 
I have a laptop with Intel Centrino and I used UltraIso to virtually mount the whole thing, you don't even need to waste 4 dvds.
My only problem was that the game is in English/Spanish and not in French and that I downloaded this out of boredom."
,punkbutt,2011-07-23T19:55Z,"Well I tried running the game as it installed, said I needed to insert the correct CD and restart.  So I re-mount the image to PowerISO, and it still tells me this.  So I replace the Sims.exe file in the Maxis folder with the .exe file that was originally downloaded in this torrent.  It tells me that there was an expansion pack installed after Makin' Magic, and that I should insert the Makin' Magic disc so that the computer can verify the installation or something.  So I go to the website listed above, download yet another .exe file, replace it, and the same thing happens.  Am I missing something?  Or do all Sims Complete Collection torrents just suck balls?"
,Asachina,2011-09-06T20:12Z,"It still works, I don't have any problem with these files.
If I remember well, first, download all the files.
Download UltraIso to mount the iso files.
You just have to mount the disc 1 (will run the installation) and when you're done for the first disc, they'll ask for the 2nd disc, so mount the 2nd in UltraIso as well etc.
If they ask you anything, just mount the discs, seriously."
