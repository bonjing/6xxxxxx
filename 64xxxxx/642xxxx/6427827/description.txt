Release Title Blue Valentine 2010 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Derek Cianfrance
Tagline Dean Pereira and Cindy Heller Pereira are a young, working class married couple - Dean
currently working as a painter, and Cindy working as a nurse in a medical clinic - with a
young daughter named Frankie. Despite their relatively tender ages, they are both ravaged
by the life they've eked out together and by the experiences they've had leading into their
marriage. Dean, a high school drop out, comes from a broken home, where he never really
had a mother figure. He never saw himself getting married or having a family despite falling
in love at first sight with Cindy. He doesn't have any professional ambition beyond his current
work - which he enjoys since he feels he can knock off a beer at 8 o'clock in the morning
without it affecting his work - although Cindy believes he has so much more potential in life.
Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an
example of a harmonious married or family life...
