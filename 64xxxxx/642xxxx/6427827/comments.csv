,dallanlee,2011-11-18T22:37Z,Bad file. I've downloaded this twice now just in case it didn't download correctly the first time but both times it has this same problem: glitchy movement that lasts maybe 2 seconds but happens about every 30-40 seconds. I've seen a few other movie files do this same thing. My computer is plenty capable of playing HD files so I know that is not the case. (3.4 GHz Quadcore i7 w/ 16GB memory) Anyone else experiencing this same problem?
