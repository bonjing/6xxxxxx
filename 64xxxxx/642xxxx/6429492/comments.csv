,Ian_Iguana,2011-05-29T10:38Z,"Is this the same torrent of the invasion that the fxg team uploaded that you've downloaded & then uploaded yourself?Because if so then it's not a bad thing to do that, it seems to be the same filesize. It's only lame when you put the name FXG when it's not their rip. I could upload fxg's movies too..but I wouldnt get as many leechers."
