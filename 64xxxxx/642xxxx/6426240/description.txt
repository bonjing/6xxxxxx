Janie Jones - We're in Love with the World of Janie Jones!
- The Sex, the Scandals, the Singles collection.

I think this CD includes all Janie Jones releases, plus "House of the Ju Ju Queen" - demo by Joe Strummer.

Janie was by no means the best of singers, but that said some of these songs are surprisingly good. There's also the 1960's top 50 single "Wiches brew", worth checking.
