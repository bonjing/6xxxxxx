,gaaraisgod,2011-05-28T19:19Z,"""plz do copy the url link and paste it to ur browser navigation bar instead""

Even if you do that, you might still need to login to ImageShack (if the images don't show up)

Or use a referral blocker."
,aradiel,2011-05-29T06:48Z,"Yes, referral blocker works perfectly. Pasting into a new browser works too. It's only a problem if you paste into an open TPB browser.

A/V were solid, and I quite liked this movie. Simple fun popcorn movie."
,Phatfish,2011-05-29T11:26Z,"A - Good

V - Good

M - 7.1 on IMDB...really now?! Seriously guys... Just like the hangover films, incomprehensible how the rating can be so high. Couldn't even make it past 20min. Humor for Sad people who live boring lives.
Plainly, sad and boring."

,dennis_is_canadian,2011-06-01T17:21Z,The quality of the film is good but the movie is terribly boring. I watched up to where he got to the conference and turned it off. Waste of time.

,Zeagle,2011-07-31T05:10Z,What a piece of shit - thankyou uploader anyways.
,Johnboy3000,2011-08-01T00:22Z,Great upload and GREAT FILM!  There's a lot of comments saying this is a shit film.  It does start a bit slow but it gets really good.  If you liked The Wire you have to watch this to see Clay Davis doing an impression of Omar!
,sillykumquat,2011-08-02T01:06Z,Quite funny. That lady he fucked was quite the milf! A/V=10 M=7
,relpze,2011-08-29T21:27Z,"movie wasnt all that great...if it didnt have Ed Helms in it from hangover, it wouldve been a complete wreck.
worth a watch i guess.

,Phatfish,2011-09-10T22:57Z,"@parkchstrppp:

Literally rolling on the floor laughing!

Oh yeezzz... Epic Butthurt.

No really, your sad life and movies that embrace lives like it isn't funny at all, but your comment was."
