                         Online Critic Review:
     This is the coolest representation of Canadian culture in a music video that Iâ€™ve ever seen! The song is The Darkest One by The Tragically Hip (one of the best Canadian bands EVER!) featuring Ricky, Julian and Bubbles from the Trailer Park Boys TV show (one of the most popular Canadian TV shows ever).

      One interesting fact that most people outside Canada would miss is that the money they use to pay for the food is from old Canadian bills that we donâ€™t use anymore. Our $1 and $2 bills were replaced with the â€œloonieâ€ and â€œtwonieâ€ coins many years ago.

     Gord Downie of The Tragically Hip not only is a cool singer, but I think heâ€™d make a good actor as well. One bucket!! lolâ€¦great! Music and beer and good times with friendsâ€¦thatâ€™s what life is all about!Enjoy!!
