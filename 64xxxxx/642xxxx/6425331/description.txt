Business card software BusinessCards MX

This program will help to design and print a professional business
card . The interface of the program has been designed in such a way
that even a beginning user will not have problems with using the
program. The process of designing is based on inserting ready for use
elements accessible in the program such as figures, images and the
background, and freely shifting them on the prepared project. Another
advantage of the program is the possibility of saving data about a
company or people so that it can be used later while designing a
