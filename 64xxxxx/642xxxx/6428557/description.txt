Americaâ€™s Worst Driver is a competition show with a twist. In this series, our contestants actually want to be eliminated, because the longer they stick around, the closer they get to being named the worst driver in America!

Each week, 4 of the worst drivers from a particular city are nominated by friends or loved ones to compete in a series of driving challenges through the streets of their hometown. These challenges are designed to seek out the cityâ€™s worst driver.

Once the worst driver of the week is selected, we do America a favor and destroy their car!

At the end of the season, each of the worst drivers from around the country will meet in LA, where theyâ€™ll have a chance to win a new car. The most incompetent driver left standing is declared Americaâ€™s Worst Driver.
