RELEASENOTES

Although the first volume of this DEPECHE MODE cover album
received a highly successful echo from both indie and mainstream
worlds, this project would have definitely remained a one-off
had it not been for Alfa Matrix's bands insistently pressing
them to launch a second volume. And once the label got to hear
some of the first written versions, they were sold They were
too good to be left lying around. After touching base with
several other Alfa Matrix artists, in no time a second volume
was born, featuring the label's well-renowned classic bands, as
well as the work of newly-arrived label artists and others who
did not make it in time for the previous edition.

Two years further down the road and here is the second volume
covers of what has to be the best synthpop band in history.
Since 2008, a lot has happened in the DEPECHE MODE camp, tours,
a new album and the band celebrating the 30th anniversary of the
release of their first single. It's all in the spirit of being a
DEPECHE MODE fan, specifically reflected in the selection of the
covered songs...  Compiled by and for DEPECHE MODE fans, "Alfa
Matrix Re:covered - A Tribute to Depeche Mode Volume 2" will
offer you once more a very special insight into what makes
DEPECHE MODE songs so special. Enjoy these interpretations and
re-discover the beauty of all these classics re:covered by the
Alfa Matrix stable, offering a diverse sound panel going from
synthpop, over old-school electro to melancholic electro rock.
100% previously unreleased versions

your art.  Our intention isn't to spread for the
masses, but just to promote good music, so all we
can ask is an apologize for any misunderstanding
You People deserve all our respect and attention

Alternately to all the Xdcc & p2p lamerz that one
day will probably destroy us all, our releases are
not supposed to be spread around, but to be where
they are meant to stay Behind Doors & Locked Away

trough this years, many to enumerate, but we all
know "Who is Who", Props go to "WHO" deserves it
