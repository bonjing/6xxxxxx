[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T18:46Z,"@Fangular: It's easy, just do as I did: eat less. 

Imagine that you hear cries from children in Darfur or in Ethiopia who cannot sleep out of hunger (what is most horrific thing I have heard), because elephants like one from the picture has eaten food which could save lives of 3824 children.

It is well known statistic data: Obese people from West eat during their life as much as 3824 people who die out of the hunger, in hundredths, as we speak.


From my late teenage years I wear 36"" '501' without going up or down more than 2-3 pounds. "
