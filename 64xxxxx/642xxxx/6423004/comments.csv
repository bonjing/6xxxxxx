Each musician in their own right is great........"
[T],SgtRlee,2011-07-11T10:44Z,"I will always seed this torrent when i'm online, but i guess so many peers that downloaded this don't give a shit about seeding for others, maybe they will run into the same problem on a torrent that they want and then they will know how it feels when they can't download it because other peers did the same thing ~.~"
