The Traveling Wilburys were a supergroup created by George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan. Initially an informal grouping with Roy Orbison and Tom Petty, they got together at Bob Dylan's studio (Santa Monica, California) to record an additional track as a B-side for the single release of Harrison's "This is Love". The song they came up with was "Handle with Care". However, the record company immediately realized it was too good to be released as a single "filler".

They enjoyed working together so much that they decided to create an album together. Written by all its members, the album was recorded over a ten-day period because Dylan was due to go on tour. Released in October 1988 (under various pseudonyms as half-brothers, supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury, Sr.), the album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 was in 1989 ranked #70 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. The death of band member Roy Orbison (on December 6, 1988) prevented further full collaborations; however, the band continued without him.

"Wilburys" was a slang term coined by Harrison and Lynne during the recording of Cloud Nine as a reference to recorded "flubs" that could be eliminated during the mixing stage (i.e., "We'll bury 'em in the mix"). The term was used again when the entire group was together. Harrison suggested "The Trembling Wilburys" as the group's name; instead, Lynne suggested "Traveling", with which the group agreed.

After Orbison's death, there was undocumented speculation in the news media that Del Shannon might join the band, but his 1990 suicide precluded any possible involvement.

A second album titled Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3 was released in October 1990. However, the album met with less success. Some possible reasons for the skip from Vol. 1 to Vol. 3 include the fact that some consider Tom Petty's Full Moon Fever as Vol. 2 (Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, and Roy Orbison perform on the album), a nod to the many bootlegs titled "Volume 2" containing early studio mixes/alternative takes, to honor the death of Roy Orbison by not releasing the project started with Orbison, or as a simple joke. Harrison once claimed in an MTV interview that the band had written material for a Vol. 2, but the material was stolen before completion.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the two Traveling Wilburys albums had limited availability and were out of print in most areas. Harrison, as primary holder of the rights, did not reissue them before his death in 2001. In June 2007, the two albums were reissued as The Traveling Wilburys Collection, a box set including both albums on CD (with bonus tracks) and a DVD featuring a twenty-four minute band documentary and a collection of music videos.

The Traveling Wilburys Collection is a 2007 box set compilation album comprised of both albums by the Traveling Wilburys and a DVD with their videos and a documentary about the group. The set was released June 12, 2007 by Rhino, in association with Wilbury Records. The set recently debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart and Australian ARIA Albums Chart.

As of June 17, 2007, the group held the number one position on the UK Album Charts with the release of The Traveling Wilburys Collection. The group also hit number one on the Australian album charts, Amazon's pre-order and sales list, and Apple's iTunes.

The release surprised many when it debuted at #1 in the UK Album Charts and the Australian album charts. On the US Billboard 200 it reached #9. The collection sold 500,000 copies worldwide during the first three weeks and remained in the UK top 5 for seven weeks after its release.
