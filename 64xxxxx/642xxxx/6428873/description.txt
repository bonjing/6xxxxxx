This is very valuable tool for freelancers who would like to keep accurate time  of how long they actually worked on a project!

Time Sink watches how you use your Mac, recording the time spent in each window and program -- whether that be foreground or background time. You can view and export reports, exclude apps and windows, and group related tasks together into one pool, which is then tracked as a single object. Can be run as a normal application, or a menu-bar-only program.

What's New

Version 1.2:

New Features

* Wildcarded window titles (i.e. *somewindow*) can now be pooled
  across all applications. (Hat tip to Visnu P. for the suggestion.)

* Time Sink's CPU usage can be managed via a new slider in the 
  General section of its Preferences.

Bug Fixes and Improvements

* License files that end in .xml are now accepted when dropped on Time
  Sink's Dock icon.

* Time Sink no longer writes occasional spurious messages to the 
  Console.
