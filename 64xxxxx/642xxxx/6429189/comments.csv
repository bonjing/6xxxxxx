,kennyd1089,2011-05-28T21:09Z,ok so it just wont let me play it at all?? 
,9minutestorm,2011-05-29T00:25Z,"thanks for the movie and also on the info on how to set the speed on utorrent, i'll seed this puppy"
,Metsyse,2011-05-29T01:42Z,"Freemake Video Converter is an excellent program in these kinds of situations. it works flawlessly. just google it. can convert to avi, mkv, android, apple...w/e you want. spread the word peeps so maybe up loaders will use it to upload proper formats."
,HYK-043,2011-05-29T09:33Z,Thanks extremezone! 
,cundalinimadmax,2011-05-29T16:22Z,"Hey extremezone firstly thanks for all your great uploads. Never have any problems with any of your stuff.
I was wondering if its possible and you dont mind can you you please find a copy of the movie Derby Baby and throw it on tpb?
If you have some success with this it would be awesome. Thx"
,mdsingh,2011-05-29T18:44Z,@kennyd1089 You can download VLC player. It plays everything.
,happyd12,2011-05-29T22:02Z,"Thank you! can always count on the quality of your uploads!!!!

i will seed for 2 weeks after download.

Thank you very, very much!"
,Watatsumi,2011-05-29T23:19Z,"@kennyd1089

try upgrading the firmware on those players. Most decent players i know can be upgraded by downloading a firmware upgrade file from the manufacturer's support site and either burned to a rw disk or placed on an usb drive."
,Watatsumi,2011-05-29T23:39Z,"P.S.: thanks

small note: the sample file is screwed up. i have latest ffdshow (svn build3861) and mpc hc (svn build 3058) and couldn't play it. Also tried in VLC 1.1.9, same thing.

Maybe thats why kenny was complaining above

however, the main file plays correctly."
,markdbsilva,2011-05-30T11:54Z,Post real. nice quality. tnx :)

,RetroidPrime91,2011-06-02T23:10Z,anyone know if AC3 audio will play on the ps3 or 360?
,jlacrue,2011-06-02T23:52Z,"Good quality and downloaded in just about 10 min. I play it on my XBOX 360 just fine through my network the only bad part is that the audio is alright but a bit low so I have to turn up my T.V. to almost 3/4 all the way up to hear it. Still worth the time to download and watch.

V=10
A=7.5"
,jlacrue,2011-06-02T23:55Z,"V=10
A=7.5

Downloaded pretty fast and the video is very good, the only problem with the audio is that its pretty low volume so you have to turn up the TV to hear it but overall worh the time to download and watch."

,TheReverendKROM,2011-06-12T16:58Z,"This is a good movie, a take off from beauty and the beast, sort of an adult version. As far as the volume I could not comment because I convert all torrents to HD and when I do I add 9 dbs because I am hard of hearing A-10  V-10 Thanks extremezone"

,zZsaberbladeZz,2011-06-17T11:25Z,another great rip from extremezone but the movie it's self was not the greatest. Its a teenybop movie.
,KoalaKnight,2011-06-17T21:24Z,"Actually AlNighter, even though the release date is on a certain day, many stores will have them shipped early, sometimes by weeks for that release date, thus an employee can often get a copy early, not that I've EVER done that while working at a store... *whistles innocently*"
,fuamiki,2011-06-21T22:54Z,"A/10
