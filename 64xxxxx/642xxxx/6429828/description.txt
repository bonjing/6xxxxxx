
A young 17-year-old celestial spirit mage, Lucy
Heartfilia, runs away from home and travels to
the land of Fiore to join the magical Fairy Tail
Guild. Along the way, she meets Natsu Dragneel,
a teenage boy looking for his foster parent, a
dragon named Igneel, with his best friend, Happy
, a cat. Shortly after their meeting, Lucy is abducted
by Bora the Prominence, who was posing as
Salamander of Fairy Tail, to be sold as a slave.
Natsu rescues her and reveals that he is the real
Salamander of Fairy Tail and has the skills of a
Dragon Slayer [fire type], an ancient magic. He
offers her membership into the guild, which she
gladly accepts. They, along with Happy become
a team and perform various missions offered by
the Fairy Tail guild.
