,scruppy,2011-05-28T19:13Z,Is there a version of this that doesn't have majorly f'd up sound??
,scruppy,2011-05-28T22:49Z,"So I figured out what's wrong with the audio track. The audio for each scene somehow is switched up: scene 1 audio goes with scene 3 video, 2 audio with 5 video, 3 audio with 1 video, 4 audio with 2 video, and 5 audio with 4 video. I hope the orig dvd wasn't that screwed up..."
