Gamera.Vs.Zigra.1971.DivX-NvadR.avi

Gamera vs. Zigra, from 1971, was already the seventh film in the original Gamera series, and its slipshod construction (even by the standards of films featuring actors in rubber monster suits) suggests less in the way of a thought-out film than a product cranked out so as to fulfill a McDonald\\\'s Happy Meal toy contract. A spaceship resembling a bowl of Dippin\\\' Dots ice cream from the planet Zigra has invaded Earth and demands the human race surrender at once; so as to prove their technological superiority, the female representative on board (later revealed to be a hypnotized human) launches a massive earthquake against Tokyo, leaving the city in ruins. Credibility wanes, then, when the city is seen perfectly intact whenever it appears outside the Zigran viewfinder, or when the antagonistic woman proves utterly incapable of dispatching two children who managed to escape her presence after catching a glimpse inside the spaceship.

Best, then, to forget the human filler altogether and concentrate on the titular matchup. When Gamera destroys the spaceship, he frees a giant alien shark, complete with laser-beam nose and capable of bipedal locomotion. And so it goes. The film entire isn\\\'t nearly as much fun as it should be, but for those with a cheeky fondness for city-scale monster mashes, there are some fleeting pleasures.

Would that such could be said for the 1980 follow-up, Gamera: The Super Monster, which functions as something of a greatest-hits package for the series. Another malevolent alien raceâ€”obviously fans of the original Star Wars openingâ€”demands the total submission of humanity, unleashing the entirety of Gamera\\\'s former foes on the Earth, albeit one at a time, not unlike anonymous henchman. Footage from the preceding Gamera sequels has been recycled here in utterly shameless fashion, most of it having been whittled down via new nip-and-tuck edits that frequently destroy what little sense of continuity there was in the first place. As a result, the rules of physics appear to have taken a vacation, but not even in ways entertaining or surreal, merely half-assed; it isn\\\'t even made clear how some of this film\\\'s antagonists are finally defeated, unless we\\\'re to assume that they\\\'ve all simply become pushovers.

No film featuring a half-dozen skyscraper-sized monsters duking it out can possibly justify being this lethargic. Similarly yawn-inducing is the film\\\'s human plot concerning three \\\"space woman\\\" who transform into human disguises via a series of oft-repeating and utterly hilarious cheerleading moves. Props are due, however, for the daring finale, in which Gamera sacrifices himself in a surprisingly moving act that will likely prove a kick in the gutâ€”and a sterling moral exampleâ€”to any otherwise undemanding children in attendance. The filmmakers prove hilariously overconfident, however, in an earlier aside: Stomping around a miniature city, Gamera knocks over an easel advertisement, which, upon a zoom-in, is revealed to be a poster for the latest Godzilla movie. Suffice to say, inviting comparisons to the king of the monsters only serves to highlight the weaknesses rampant herein.
