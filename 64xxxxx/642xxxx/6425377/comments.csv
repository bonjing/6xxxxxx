,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T21:24Z,thanks so much hope they arent a virus x
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T21:25Z,but judging by the size they are oh well :(
,SS64084,2011-05-26T21:26Z,Please seed after download
,SS64084,2011-05-26T21:32Z,"Hi

The Size increase after you use the Patcher_EFIGS.exe i will upload the new one - but you wont need it, so copy and paste the 2 files and run Patcher_EFIGS.exe from Skidrow folder then the 1.1 update."
,trixantea,2011-05-26T21:53Z,this is no virus but i still can't install the 1.1 patch
,SS64084,2011-05-26T21:58Z,@trixantea did you run the Patcher_EFIGS.exe from Skidrow folder after you copied the files?
,jauas,2011-05-26T22:04Z,"@trix
I figured out what the problem was - make sure to remove the troll.dzip file if you have it in your CookedPC folder. (I'm not sure if it was troll.dzip or trolldlc.dzip something very similar)

The 1.1 update will automatically give you it anyways! "
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T22:12Z,my problem is the 1.1 patch worked but when i try to crack it now the game doesnt start it just exits automatically dont know what to do... Patcher_EFIGS.exe never worked for me though thought it would work on the original files if these are the real original ones dont think they are this small...
,SS64084,2011-05-26T22:32Z,"@Dark1lla - these file require the Patcher_EFIGS.exe, if you cant run it it wont work."
,Horseband,2011-05-26T22:35Z,"@Dark1lla

You can't use the old crack... That crack was meant for the original version of the game. 1.1 had the DRM taken out and you shouldn't even need to crack it to play."
,Horseband,2011-05-26T22:37Z,"@Dark1lla

Also. These files are virus free. You've been sitting here complaining all day and you could've redownloaded the game by now or at least downloaded this torrent.

Just download this torrent, replace the files in your folder, do the patch thing"
,SS64084,2011-05-26T22:38Z,one more thing dont Crack the game - they removed the DRM - try it now Dark1lla and let us know.

i have BlackBox repack the Patcher_EFIGS.exe is already included
i replaced the files with the original ones and deleted the troll dlc but i cant install the 1.1 patch (error creating tempory file)"
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T23:50Z,"@Horsebrand im not complaining at all im just stating that the files are small and i did download them and try them but they didnt work and downloading the full 14gb~ game because of 2 files isnt that worth it...

@SS64084 i downloaded the after patcher download that you uploaded , copied , pasted and patched the game and it worked xD thanks a lot SS64084 game is way smoother now and dlc works "
,SS64084,2011-05-27T00:03Z,"@Dark1lla, Plesure glad you got it sorted :)"
,anarhija99,2011-05-27T00:40Z,im usin witcher 2 black box and i use this dll and the exe file it says to me you need to activate the game it asking me for serial key any solution ??
,Marcvss,2011-05-27T01:47Z,"For me this torrent is working great...

First I removed the troll.dzip file in the CookedPC folder, then copied pasted the files from the after patch folder thats in this torrent to the bin folder, ran Patcher_EFIGS.exe after that and finally installed patch 1.1...

Thanx alot uploader!!!"
,montanamb,2011-05-27T07:24Z,"@holloow
How did you make it work, can you explain? As you can see, there's a lot of people with black box version, including me, and we can't install the patch.

After a few more tries, I will reinstall it though, because at the official site, they say you need to reinstall it."
,Furious1964,2011-05-27T07:39Z,"All I did was put the original paul.dll file back, ran the 1.1 patch and then replaced the Skidrow paul.dll file in the bin folder and the game works. No need to replace the game .exe file as it not necessary."
,svetkopetko5,2011-05-27T12:00Z,"it worked fine, i just have a question - this patch should remove the CD KEY as requirement, but when i try to register the game it tells me it's an Invalid CD Key..

how can i register the game so i can get additional DLC?"
,svetkopetko5,2011-05-27T12:01Z,"COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS:

Before patching delete any DLC you might have put in the cooked PC Folder like Troll.Dzip

1.First replace the cracked files with the original files

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377/The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EXE_-_SS

2. Run only Patcher_EFIGS from the skidrow crack. Dont copy paul.dll

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

3. Install the 1.1 patch from the official website named ""Patcher_1.1_International"""
,kct810,2011-06-02T21:20Z,"Every time I try to run the patcher it says ""failed to creat temporary files"". Help Please, I'm at a loss."
,JC-0589,2011-06-03T01:17Z,"Hello fellas... this question may sound dumb but I'm kinda lost.
After I followed steps kindly posted by svetkopetko5, I believe sucessfully patch to 1.1
After I went back to my saved game, I did found my last saved game but all my stuff saved on my inventory except the things I was wearing and the weapons... Is there any way I can get them back or am I screwed?  "
,oCoreCyan,2011-06-03T19:37Z,"I know this may be a stupid question but how do i install the 1.2 patch that came out today? 

Can someone post the instructions on how i do it?

Ive tried doing it this way but it didn't work it said that the game version was wrong. So someone please tell me how i install the 1.2 patch."

Cant upload to TPB for some reason."
,SS64084,2011-06-03T21:45Z,@oCoreCyan i just download the 1.2 patch from official site and installed it - but that was after patch 1.1 - you can try to do do everything in this Torrent and then 1.1 and the 1.2 patch - hope it help.
,SS64084,2011-06-03T21:50Z,"@oCoreCyan - try using the files in the After patcher Torrent after install - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425536/(After_Patcher_EFIGS.exe)_The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EX

do not replace files if you have 1.1 installed allready."
,SS64084,2011-06-03T22:05Z,"STEP BY STEP

Option 0 - Vanilla game no patches just crack
copy both files from after patcher folder (overwrite cracks)
Update to 1.1 then 1.2 (or straight to 1.2 (NOT TESTED))

play

Option 1 - vanilla game (Fresh install)
Install Game
run patcher from Skidrow folder
Update to 1.1 then 1.2 (or straight to 1.2 (NOT TESTED))
play

Option 2 - allready updated to 1.1
run patch 1.2
play. "
,svetkopetko5,2011-06-05T04:33Z,"patch 1.2 will only NOT work if you have installed any additional content, like items, skins, mutagens and other stuff. you would have to find them all and remove them before installing the patch. it's safe to add them back in later."
,Noodley,2011-06-06T10:38Z,"What about with the Blackbox version? I've tried taking the DLC out, using the 1.1 updated exe/paul.dll, trying to the old, nothing works."
,Noodley,2011-06-07T00:29Z,"Yeah, I was planning on doing that if I couldn't find an answer shortly."
,Nonpoint187,2011-06-08T09:41Z,"You have to remove all DLC

alchemy_suit
dlc_finishers
hairdresser
magical_suit
marchant
roche_jacket
swordsman_suit
troll

Add original paul.dll and exe then Run patcher_EFIGS then run the 1.2 patch. If you're like me and moved your witcher 2 folder place the patcher file directly in the witcher 2 dir then patch it."
