              Plot.................: A coming-of-age story that follows 12-year-old
 Andy Nichol (Chase Ellison), a bright student who, like most kids his age, will do
 anything to avoid conflict for fear of suffering overwhelming ridicule and punishment
 from his junior high school peers. Everyone's favorite teacher, Mr. Simon (Ed Harris),
 pairs Andy with the school's biggest outcast and social pariah, Stanley, aka "Big G"
 (Alexander Walters) on a critical term project. Sporting thick orange hair, a head
 too big for his body and ears too big for his head, "Big G" has been the object of
 ridicule since grade school. Before long, Andy will learn that there was truly a
 method behind Mr. Simon's madness as to why he teamed these two up. As the story
 unfolds, Mr. Simon finds himself the target of a malicious rumor after Principal
 Kelner (Amy Madigan) suspends a school bully for brutally beating up a female
 classmate who he thinks has "cooties." When Andy watches "Big G" fearlessly confront
 the school bully, a series of events are triggered, which change the lives of both
 young men - and their teacher - forever. Much to Andy's surprise "Big G" is
 brilliant, kind, tolerant and a decent human being, who has more dignity than anyone
 Andy has ever encountered.
