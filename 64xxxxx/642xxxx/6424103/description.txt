Zenwalk Gnome 7.0 is out!

We are proud to provide Zenwalk gnome 7.0 based on gnome 2.32.1.
It is the last step before going to gnome 3.0.

Zenwalk gnome keeps the same way like standard Zenwalk edition, a clean and clear desktop.
Hal support is removed. Networkmanager was prefered instead of wicd.
Rhythmbox has been also introtuced as default music player and cd grabber.
Viewnior is used like fast and quick viewer pictures and Simple-scan replaces xsane to scan documents.

Networkmanager-0.8.4
gedit-2.30.4
nautilus-2.32.2.1
rhythmbox-0.13.3
