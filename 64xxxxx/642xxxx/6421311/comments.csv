,SuSpence,2011-05-27T01:03Z,Is there any way to turn off the sub titles?
,djdcm0722,2011-05-28T20:58Z,"I never comment on movies but this one sucks. Great video but audio is definitely not 5.1, atleast not for English. Find a different version if you want to watch it with surround sound.

,Buadhach,2011-06-14T20:45Z,"@djdcm0722: If you don't like the audio, go out and buy it then. Quit complaining about a free movie that just came out just because you don't get HiDef audio out of a 3.3 GB download.

On that note, it sounds just fine on my 2.1 desktop speakers, I couldn't tell any difference between it and an actual DVD or BlueRay. Love the movie and it's a great download to watch on your computer! Thanks ExtraTorrentRG! :)

Oh and @SuSpence: To turn off subtitles (using VLC player) go to Video - Subtitles Track - Disable. That's what it is on a Mac anyway, should at least be pretty similar for the others. Cheers!"
,Soterius,2011-06-20T16:56Z,"AAAAAARGHHH!!! WHy won't anyone provide good ENGLISH subtitles for this movie?!?!?

Each and every sub I try is the same one, where it seems like the movie was first translated to another language and then translated BACK to English, so the subtitles basically say the same thing that the actor says, but in other words... Besides that, it often misses words like ""today was the day I gonna kick it's ass"" WAS motherfuckers, WAS gonna kick it's ass!

So did any of you guys find proper English subs yet? I downloaded the movie ages ago and am waiting and waiting until the day someone provides proper English subs. GODDAMNIT!!"
,steezfcb,2011-07-25T03:32Z,Can you switch it to English and how?
,pezed,2012-02-05T00:40Z,"Thank You. The audio is just fine.
