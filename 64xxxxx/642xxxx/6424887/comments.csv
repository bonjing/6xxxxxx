1. I can only get a Locked map (in my case Australia) to work in Mapsource 6.13.7. but not 6.16.3

2. SE Asia does not show Preview map.....it just shows yellow background with boxes.

Thanks in advance."
,C0nnie,2011-06-06T03:49Z,"1. What is it that doesn't work? I've just re-tried Australia and N.Zealand 2012.10 in unlocked mode in MapSource 6.16.3 with no problems. I think the maps are actually unlocked anyway. Run ""GARMIN Unlocker"" by whocares? in the map folder to unlock and you shouldn't have any problems. You do need a patched exe as per my instructions though.

2. You need to be zoomed in to 50miles or less because of the vast map area covered. Once you are at this magnification, move the map until you find your country before zooming in further.

Whenever I need parts of various maps on my satnav, I simply highlight the relavant boxes (.img) parts and export direct to .img on my Nuvi, so I don't really mess with MapSource too much."

,C0nnie,2011-07-11T01:14Z,"Once MapSource is installed and using the patched exe, just follow my instructions on where to extract the files and what to do.

In MapSource, open the map and highlight (drag box using mouse) around what parts (or all) of the map you need, then you can send it directly to your satnav (Nuvi) or  create an .img file to copy manually.

Just play around with the program, it's not too hard to figure out. Just remember to note the size of the parts of the maps that you're adding b4 making the file - it has to be less than your nuvi's internal memory or the space left on your SD card."

The Unauthenticated seems to have later version than Brazil,

Using tha patched mapsource and I have a nç«¯vi 2440."
