This is a collection of maps for use with Garmin's MapSource software.

Using this software (and others as listed in my 'Instructions.txt' file), you can create your own custom maps which can be saved or directly transferred in the standard 'gmapsupp.img' format to your Garmin device.

This gives you far more flexibilty than just porting a specific map region container file to your device, and can help with internal or micro SD memory constraints.
