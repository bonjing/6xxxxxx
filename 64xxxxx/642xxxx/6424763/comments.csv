What the hell are you watching? Video is dark and blurry, sound out of sync. Don't get me wrong, I know it's free and that, but don't rate it so high when it clearly doesn't deserve it.

I'd say 
A: 4 (you can hear it, but by halfway through the film it's 1 or 2 people behind the video in the conversation sync-wise.) 
V: 4 (it's blurry and dark and the contrast has been knocked up so in some parts it's just like blurry shadows on white.)

Wait for a better copy."
