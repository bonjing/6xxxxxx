Here is my 720p compilation - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425947/Glee_Seasons_1__amp__2_720p_Complete

Also, no there is not a track missing from Meet the Warblers. It also appeared on Volume 4, so it is included with Volume 4.

Lastly, while ""I've Slept With You"" plays fine on the computer, it seems to have trouble synching to my iPod. If that really matters to anyone, just try converting it on your own computer. Just thought I'd mention it!

Have fun."

,undaunt,2011-05-29T03:04Z,"Just kidding, I *did* upload the correct one. xD"
,heckrot,2011-06-03T00:55Z,"great collection, has many songs not on other glee collections.  i only checked season 1 so far and it is missing 4 songs that i have found elsewhere, they are ""hello, i love you,"" ""the boy is mine,"" ""dream a little dream,"" and ""tell me something good.""  I'll check season 2 in the future"
,undaunt,2011-06-04T03:44Z,"Hey heckrot, those songs actually are included. However, even though they were originally released as singles, during Season 2 they were re-released as a ""Love Songs"" EP. They're in there, with two other songs.

:D"

,jsuh72,2011-12-07T12:54Z,I was wondering if you can upload the music for season 3?
,JacanoForever,2011-12-08T21:48Z,"This torrent sucks, I have the complete soundtrack of Season 1 all 100 songs from S01 and it came up to 1.5 GiB, the fact this torrent has all audio from 1 and 2 the size SHOULD ATLEAST BE BIGGER. Prob the quality sucks."
