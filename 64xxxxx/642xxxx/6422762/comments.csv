,aer8,2011-05-28T08:50Z,"Good video quality and decent audio... However, a movie with lots of spanish dialogue with german subtitles is completely useless to me. Try english next time. "

,dshagen,2011-06-07T03:38Z,"ok, seriously, i get so aggravated when people ask if this is a DVD rip. 
YOU CANNOT FIND A DVD RIP IF THE MOVIE IS NOT OUT ON DVD. make sense?
glad to help out"
,packings,2011-06-12T08:25Z,"+1 dshagen... although he might of been speaking of an R5 rip... but if he is, then he can search for it, its not like it would be hard to find... an R5 of this popular of a movie would be everywhere with tons of peers"
,irishredhead27,2011-06-13T08:51Z,"A:7...V:8
I thinks it's pretty good quality.  The hardcoded german subs are annoying though....I don't like it when some one speaks in another language and I don't know what they're saying. (In life and while watching movies) Subtitles are my friend : )
But not these."
,irishredhead27,2011-06-13T09:51Z,"OK...I take back my rating....new rating=
A:6
V:5
For the sheer fact you cut off the credits and didn't show the VERY end. It's an opening for another movie installment, and you left it out....wtf???"
,irishredhead27,2011-06-17T11:30Z,"HOOOOOOOOLLLLLLYYYY SSCCCHHNNIIKKKEEESS!!!
I checked out other copies of this movie...and half of the screen is gone on almost all of them, and the audio is even worse. There's beeps throughout the movie,ugh,...people don't waste your time with the others.
 I'm sticking with this one, and I'm just gonna suck it up about the subtitles hehe...I suggest you do the same. Yes this is a woman admitting she's wrong, and you have the time and date to prove it : )"
