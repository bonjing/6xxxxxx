Season 1, Episode 2: My Name Is Jake: Part 2
Original Air Dateâ€”15 September 1998
Sometimes weird things happen to people. Ask Jake. He might tell you about the night he and his friends saw the strange light in the sky. He may even tell you what happened when they realized the "light" was only a plane... from another planet. Here's where Jake's story gets a little weird. It's where they're told that the human race is under attack, and given the chance to fight back. Now Jake, Rachel, Cassie, Tobias, and Marco have the power to morph into any animal they choose. And they must use that power to outsmart an evil greater than anything that world has ever seen.

Season 1, Episode 3: Underground
Original Air Dateâ€”18 September 1998
The Animorphs try out the disk, but nothing happens. Jake and Marco realize that someone very close to Jake is a Controller. The Controller turns out to be Jake's brother, Tom. Jake wants his brother back, and he'll do anything to do it. They tried morphing out into ferocious animals from the clinic that Cassie's mother works in. Jake acquires a tiger and Rachel acquires a lion. They use it to try and free all of the humans in the Yeerk Pool located under the school. Their attempt ended with no free humans, without Tom, Tobias was gone (probably captured by the Yeerks), and the disk was lost.
