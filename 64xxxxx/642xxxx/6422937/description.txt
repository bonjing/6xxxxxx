Deerhunter - Turn It Up Faggot (2005)(FLAC)









Turn It Up Faggot is the debut album from indie rock group Deerhunter. The album's title refers to a taunt that was shouted at the band during early live shows although the album is also referred to as self-titled. The album's notes dedicate the album to Justin Bosworth, the band's original bassist, who died in 2004.

Lead singer Bradford Cox produced the cover photography, typography and montage for the album. For the album artwork, Cox took a picture of Jared Swilley from the Black Lips, recognizable to some because of the tattoo on his arm. The music video for "Oceans" is available as a CD-ROM extra. Cox has often expressed aversion towards their debut in interviews, declaring: "I hate that album, I really do. I liked it when we did it, but we were a young band-- just really desperate to put something out-- and I don't think we were ready."
