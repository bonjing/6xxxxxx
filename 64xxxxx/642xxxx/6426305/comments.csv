,srawrats,2011-06-15T12:33Z,Use 'U Torrent' or 'Bit Torrent' Then when you click on download torrent just check the file you want. 
,ZombiBoi918,2011-06-15T18:38Z,i downloaded this torrent and cox turned off my internet. this has happened on other torrents also. any help on getting around this would be much appreciated.

 The video is cropped and a bit cut off on the bottom, it would be a 10 otherwise.

 You can see the top bits of subtitles popping up from time to time, probably missing a good inch from the bottom.

 Other than that it's a good copy, was amazed by the visuals quite a few times, this was the studios first animated film and it looked gorgeous."
,NoMoleste,2011-06-23T05:06Z,Bummed about the crop but overall it is one of the best quality screeners I have seen. Much thanks for your efforts!
,Receptionist,2011-06-23T08:06Z,@JzSizzle you need to get a different torrent client then. BitTorrent is free and works great. Under the downloading torrent in the tab 'files' you can select which files you wanna download.

If you don't know how to play a movie you have nothing to do here. 

And just so you know extremezone is one of the best."
,Exoaria,2011-09-08T20:00Z,"cvjosh, it's not anybody's fault but your own for being a degenerate retard that doesn't know how to operate VLC media player. extremezone, in case you didn't know, has a green skull next to his name which means that ALL of the torrents he uploads are to the mentioned quality.

go take your fucking stone age conclusion jumping to some anger management class before you make accusations and insults towards someone who's done everything correctly. not everything revolves around you and your demands because you can't figure out how to acquire a codec and therefore hold other people responsible.

get off this website, you shouldn't even be allowed outside a box."
