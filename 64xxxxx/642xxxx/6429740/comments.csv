Just to be clear, you said its fully working on Wii-Flow. so there is no need to patch anything or install anything. this works on Wii-flow. I tried different torrent iso that didnt work. so to be clear, can you please tell me it works fine. We dont need to install iso 250 / 499 or something like that or anything. Just please clarify thanks.

Regards
Keanu"
