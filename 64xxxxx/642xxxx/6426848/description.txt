This patch(by key of truth) is by far the best patch you will probably ever get for this game, everything is now in english (atleast, i think it is) it even has the original US names for the finishers and all those other crap, i think the reports are in english as well, but im not quite sure.... anyways, so far everything is in english, oh, and please seed, many thanks^^ comment if it doesnt work.... (tested and working on prometheus-4)
