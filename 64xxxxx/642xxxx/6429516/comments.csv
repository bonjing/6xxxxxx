As for your two twits, stop trying to register the systemcare program, Unhook your internet, enter serial provided. register, It will say that you will need to update this latter, and give you pro access for 365 day's before the next check >_< 

If that solution is not good enough, Pay 12 usd and buy a year of pro."

,hunkydorey,2011-06-10T18:18Z,"awesome, works just fine, turn off internet when entering serial"
,skulldragon,2011-06-17T07:25Z,"What ever..
Well, if you disconnect from the net, it may say it's PRO, but actually, since it couldn't/didn't write anything positive inside License.dat, program's modules won't work and it will reset back to FREE on next start, even if net cable is still unplugged!

Let's better try to share that License.dat file itself instead of that stupid SN, huh?"
