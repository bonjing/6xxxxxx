,undermaker,2011-05-25T13:28Z,we still need fix to crashes after start...
,chazmrokar,2011-05-25T13:40Z,"Crashes after start are caused by fact that you launching the game via ""dirt3.exe"" instead of ""play.exe"". Make shortcut of ""play.exe"" and launch that one. Worked for me."
,undermaker,2011-05-25T15:00Z,"i have skidrow-release and not contain ""play.exe""....i copying ""play.exe"" from other crack, but it delete ""paul.dll"", because it's ""harmfull"" and ask me original game-dvd.....so....we need new, working crack..."
,MaxxDamage,2011-05-25T16:18Z,what's the name of the song in the installer????? sounds like dubstep.. I WANT!

,MaxxDamage,2011-05-25T18:00Z,Thank u man! this made my day.. \m/ fav+
,heretic2,2011-05-25T18:51Z,"I tried the actual skidrow release and couldn't get the game to launch, just got the hour glass for a few seconds and nothing happened. Hoping I'll have better luck with this one"
,heretic2,2011-05-25T20:05Z,Don't know if it works yet but ya the install music is awesome lol.
,heretic2,2011-05-25T20:40Z,"Ok I just give up on this game for now. It will not launch. All crack files are installed, none were deleted during installation. But when I open the game I still get the hour glass for a few seconds and then nothing, doesn't even leave the desktop. I'm above minimum reqs for the game (which wouldn't cause this problem anyway, at least it shouldn't) I've reinstalled 2 versions of it, tried the standalone crack download, tried forcing dx9 on launch, it simply will not start. I'm sorry, I'll probably get flamed for this, but I think its the crack. This is the first game I've EVER had this problem with."
,Saash30,2011-05-25T20:51Z,"heretic2 any info, works or not ?"
,Rzr000pe,2011-05-25T21:24Z,"Game For Windows Live must be installed  from the soft, then game starts."
,undermaker,2011-05-25T21:31Z,"heretic2: do you have ""games for windows live"" installed ? without that game won't start....look at dvd folder ""GFWL"" and run ""gfwlivesetup.exe..."
,heretic2,2011-05-25T21:39Z,"Interesting bit. After installing dirt 3, dirt 2 developed the exact same problem. I've been playing that all week."
,heretic2,2011-05-25T21:44Z,Sorry for filling this with so many comments lol. I'm going to try installing the gfwl included with this torrent. Is it an update or something? b/c ive had gfwl for quite a while.
,heretic2,2011-05-25T22:55Z,"gfwl fully installed, still not launching. Thank you for trying to help but im really just tired of trying to make it work. Plenty of others on here with the same problem so until they find a solution or there's a crack update (which I'm sorry but I still say its the crack) I can wait."

Did everything possible, it won't start.
I have gtx 285, intel7, 3 gb ddr3, etc...

,undermaker,2011-05-26T22:39Z,Paradise12314: don't download this russian shit...contains malware....
,the5age,2011-05-26T23:52Z,"Clean and simple. Game is full, nothing ripped except other languages - English only. The installer works flawlessly, but it has hieroglyphs instead of letters (I speak Russian), but just hit >Next>Next> (middle button in bottom right corner) and you should be all right. Launch the game with ""dirt3.exe"" in the game directory - the game works flawlessly on W7 32bit - if it does not work, something is wrong with your OS/PC."
,skidmarc101,2011-05-27T03:21Z,"If your haveing problems


1.download new crack  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6419470/Dirt.3-SKIDROW

3. Copy Files from crack folder into dirt 3 directory

4. remember to reactivate resident sheild

5. Run game from Dirt3.exe   NOT Dirt3_game.exe



SKIDMARC"
,skidmarc101,2011-05-27T03:38Z,"Scrap that

,siddhantg28,2011-05-28T09:41Z,this rip is working...the cannot launch problem exist even with the skidrow and the retail versions..i think it has something to do with games for windows live..try uninstalling GFWL restart then reinstall GFWL and then again restart.!!! also try installing GFWL from the microsoft site!! might help!!!
,b1tch455,2011-05-28T10:41Z,"You're right, this DL does not have the Play.exe file.
I DL'ed it from here

Replaced dirt3.exe and added play.exe, made shortcut from play.exe, and vIoLa !!! Working
"
,overclocking,2011-05-29T09:00Z,"dirt3_game.exe wants access to the network. Should I allow it? 

Guys the game works fine. Just disable your antivirus before installing. Thats all and start the game from the Dirt 3 shortcut appearing on your desktop. Also make sure to create an OFFLINE account for 'Games For Windows LIVE' . Thank you to the team behind this great upload"
,vrocks94,2011-05-30T07:08Z,hey u people this is ur world's greatest gaming fan and i'll advise u to download this torrent instead of wasting ur time by downloading a 7.4 gb torrent from skidrow unless you want a language pack installer cuz this repack is of english only
