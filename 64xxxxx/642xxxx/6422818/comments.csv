Sadly there is a lot of propability that i soon go back to the source , to the foundations and will then upload only roots rock reggae stuff... there is many new trusted uploaderz uploading apps as i used to so i guess it is time to leave the place to the newbies - they are hungry of success on TPB and are doing - i must admit - i very good job ! 

Time to get on ! 

Thx again for those comments ."
