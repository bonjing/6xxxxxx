,aegbno,2011-05-30T20:50Z,"Might just be me, but I'm getting a Trojan warning with AVG."
,Uclid,2011-05-31T11:17Z,"Ignore the trogan warning.  It is a false positive.
This uploader wouldnt upload any trogans.
Its right to be cautious if you are newish though: so let some comments build up here before you download.
Basically if an uploader has a skull and crossbones after his name then they are OK.  Experience will help... :)"
,Robsond76,2011-06-07T20:54Z,"Good Torrent, just opened it and played the tutorial a bit, everything seems to be fine. I just downloaded Circle of 8 and see if i can install it together with this game."
,Robsond76,2011-06-07T21:22Z,"yep, installed circle of 8 with toee and it works good too. Great work Devestate2009, cheers.

Everyone else, don`t let this torrent die!"
,lightoferebus,2011-07-21T13:34Z,"I seeded it for 1 week, and then extract it to play it, only to discover TOEE.exe had a trojan in it!! aegbno was right after all!"
,fjhamming,2011-08-26T14:27Z,I had a trojan too. It seemed to be a keylogger and my wife's hotmail and gmail were hacked. Replacing the executable with a crack from game copy world seems to help.
,LuminousGarden,2012-03-10T01:43Z,"So is this Trojan a real threat? If this guy had his emails hacked, then I may be concerned. I want this game, but not at the cost of my privacy."
,jpsspirate,2012-05-14T00:47Z,"If you want the game, try buying it, fuckwits."
