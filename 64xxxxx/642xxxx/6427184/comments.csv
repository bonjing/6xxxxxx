,joej191,2011-05-27T20:38Z,+1 do you have a blog or a twitter so we can keep up ?
[V],IndexTrance,2011-05-27T22:36Z,"'joej191'

May i ask why you need an uploaders blog or twitter or why he even should have one? Isn't it just to bookmark his account on this site or any of the other torrentsites he uses? 

No offense to you but i just can't understand why anyone should blog or twitter about uploading stuff .. That's just beyond me .. Nut Hey, that's just me! . )"
