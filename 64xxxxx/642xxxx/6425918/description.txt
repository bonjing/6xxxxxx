Everything you know about World of Warcraft has changed forever. The entire 1-60 portion of the game has been redesigned from the ground up, the talent system has been reworked in new and exciting ways, 2 new races are now playable, and the level cap has been raised to 85.

That much new content can be daunting to take in. It doesn\'t matter if you are an experienced, hardcore player or a complete noob, everyone has to relearn the game again for Cataclysm. But that challenge doesn\'t have to be hard at all, in fact, it can be made fun and easy with Zygor\'s all new 1-85 leveling guides.

Our world reknowned leveling guides have been completely rewritten from scratch for Cataclysm. We\'ve even gone the extra mile and added a full guide for getting the Loremaster achievement at no additional cost. So this is it. You are just a click away from aquiring the only tool that can unlock the full World of Warcraft experience.
