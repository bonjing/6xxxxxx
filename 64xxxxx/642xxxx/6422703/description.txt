Synopsis

The first book ever to feature detailed directions for bongs, pipes, hookahs, and more, Build This Bong brings both the classics and entirely original showstoppers to the home workshop. Projects of all sorts from a standard gravity bong to a rubber ducky hookah and a state of the art vaporizer come to life with Popular Mechanics-inspired illustrations and simple instructions. No fancy materials necessary: handyman Randy Stratton shows how to construct everything from common household goods. Build This Bong's 40 inventive projects made from melons, coconuts, snow-globes, teapots, and more are sure to be a big, mind-blowing hit.
