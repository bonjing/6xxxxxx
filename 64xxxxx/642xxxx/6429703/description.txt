From Wiki:


Genesis are an English rock band that formed in 1967. The band currently comprises the longest-tenured members Phil Collins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks. Past members Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett also played major roles in the band in its early years. Genesis are among the top 30 highest-selling recording artists of all time with approximately 150 million albums sold worldwide.[1]

Genesis began as a 1960s pop rock band. During the 1970s, they evolved into a progressive rock band, incorporating complex song structures and elaborate instrumentation, while their concerts became theatrical experiences with innovative stage design, pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes and on-stage stories. This second phase was characterised by lengthy performances such as the 23 minute "Supper's Ready", the 1974 concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and the two acclaimed albums A Trick of the Tail and Wind and Wuthering. In the 1980s, the band produced accessible pop rock music and fewer progressive pieces. This change of direction gave them their first number one album in the United Kingdom, Duke, and their only number one single in the United States, "Invisible Touch".

Genesis has changed personnel several times. Stage fright forced founding member Anthony Phillips to leave the band in 1970. In 1975, Collins, then the band's drummer, replaced Peter Gabriel as lead singer after a lengthy search for a replacement. To facilitate Collins's move to lead vocals during concerts, Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson played drums for the band as they toured, with Collins joining in briefly during lengthy instrumental passages. In 1977, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band. After Phil Collins left the band in 1996, Genesis recruited Ray Wilson (formerly of Stiltskin). Wilson appeared on the 1997 album Calling All Stations, after which the band announced an indefinite hiatus. However, in 2007, Banks, Collins and Rutherford reunited for a 20-city tour of Europe and North America, which included a free concert at Rome's Circo Massimo in front of 500,000 fans. Genesis was among five bands inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010.






Turn It On Again - The Hits 1999


Turn It On Again: The Hits is a greatest hits collection by British progressive rock band Genesis. The album was first released as a single album on 26 October 1999 (see 1999 in music)[1] by Virgin Records in England and by Atlantic Records in the United States.

In 2007,(see 2007 in music) an expanded two-disc edition, subtitled The Tour Edition, was released to promote the Turn It on Again reunion tour. All of the tracks, except for "The Carpet Crawlers 1999," were remixed by Nick Davis. In addition, the album features more songs from every album in the band's catalogue (minus the live albums and From Genesis to Revelation). Besides 2CD version, the 2CD + 2DVD version was issued, which included The Video Show DVD and When in Rome DVD.

Although it mostly samples material from the Phil Collins era (1976â€“1992), the collection stretches back to "I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)" from 1973's Selling England by the Pound â€“ the only track from the Peter Gabriel years. However, as a bonus, a re-recording of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway's "The Carpet Crawlers" featuring Gabriel, Collins and Steve Hackettâ€”recorded in 1999 was included as well.

Upon its release, Turn It On Again: The Hits reached #4 on the UK Albums Chart and #65 on the Billboard 200 (US) albums chart, where it achieved gold record status.

In 2007, the compilation was re-released as a 2-CD set with bonus tracks for the new tour of the group. The project was again extremely successful, re-entering the charts at #14 and the following week climbing to #5. The 2-disc version was released in the US on 11 September replacing The Platinum Collection.

The seven letters of the Genesis logo on the cover are parts of the different album cover logos over the years. They are as follows:


â€¢	The "G" from ...And Then There Were Three...
â€¢	The first "E" from the second "E" on We Can't Dance (the first "E" on that album's cover was reversed)
â€¢	The "N" from Calling All Stations (with a different colour scheme; this was reverted on the 2007 re-issue)
â€¢	The second "E" from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway
â€¢	The first "S" from Duke
â€¢	The "I" from Genesis
â€¢	The second "S" from Invisible Touch
