,joaquimario,2011-05-29T08:39Z,"Please, see comments on episode 6 link and do not forget to help others by seeding. I'm also stucked  like you. "
,joaquimario,2011-05-29T08:42Z,Se comments on episode 6 link. And do not forget to help seeding too.
,aa221,2011-05-29T21:28Z,"Seed is gone again, my share count is 3.89 on this one and 21.11 on 06. You might want to add another tracker as I can only connect to openbittorrent.com  and according to this article->http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=94701
The thepriratebay.org tracker does exist. Stuck at 90.4%, sorry to bother you, thanks"
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-05-29T23:36Z,"Ok, I personally use uTorrent where you add trackers by right clicking the information screen where the trackers are located, click add tracker, the type the tracker in the appropriate box while always allowing a spaced line between trackers. Use this tracker, it has well over 500 seeders -------> http://luckybittorrent.com:2710/announce  Thanks for downloading from [Buzzsaw Tv] and remember to help feed the need and SEED!"
,aa221,2011-05-30T06:02Z,"Feedback, I put up uTorrent and ran it, get the same thing and this is what it reports for S01E07 for seeds;
seeds: 0 of 1 connected (550 in swarm)

Which is exactly what I see with Bitcomet and both hang at 98.5% on 07 and 5.4% on 08. So basicly I can see 1 seed that I (or 67 other peers) can connect to. They are all sitting at the same percentages at this moment.  It seems everytime I leave you a message it all starts working again for a time and then stops again.
Thanks for all your help and good work"
,joaquimario,2011-05-30T08:41Z,Hi aa221. I've just see your last post and I also am stucked at 98.5. But I guess when I return from work at night I will have the fully episode. 
,aa221,2011-05-30T17:59Z,"Still no joy, I can see 61 peers and connect to at least 42 of them. They all show 98.5% except for one at 99%. I'm on the forum under the same id if there is anything I can do. My share on E07 is 6.29, my share is over 39 on E06(100%), and on E08 my share is 2.57 and stuck at 5.4%. I think the luckybittorrent tracker is broken, for me it reads 550 seeds and 863 peers but only returns 3 peers on connection and no seeds. and it does about the same on all 3 of these torrents for me. I am not seeing any download completes on E07 or E08 while E06 is showing them, Bitcomet shows what the trackers report for this."
