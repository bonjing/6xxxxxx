,funpigj,2011-05-27T17:58Z,"Thank you thank you thank you.  I was hoping someone would up this, so glad it's you!!!"
,razorraj,2011-05-27T19:45Z,dude plz do all torrents in 480p instead of 352p......
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T20:11Z,"LOL. Which ones, silly? ""Dude""? ROFL


BTW, you probably meant ""encodes"" and not ""torrents"".

It is NOT something anybody except me could say, even suggest. For example, sane and civilized people would not. 

272p, 352p and 480p are - equal. IF you don't like it - click away. It is much simpler than ""suggest"" something nebulous."
,razorraj,2011-05-27T21:46Z,lol i no wats 252p n all...i meant the encodes...i said so cause the video frame ratio  of 480 is better than other P's.....
