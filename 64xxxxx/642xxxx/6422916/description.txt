Cultural historian David Heathcote uses old travel guide books to explore modern-day Britain.

Part 1. The Victorian Way.
David Heathcote uses a 1887 Baedeker Guide to explore modern-day Britain, discovering hidden treasures popular with Victorian tourists but rarely visited today. He discovers 'the most fashionable of Welsh watering places' before taking a trip to the salt mines and visiting Manchester, recommended by Baedeker as a hotbed of music, politics and radical thinking. The journey ends in York where modern day tourists follow in the footsteps of their Victorian counterparts.
