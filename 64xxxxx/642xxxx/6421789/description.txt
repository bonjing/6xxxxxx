A sleepy Indiana town awoke one chilly morning in the winter of 1992 to discover the lifeless body of 12-year-old Shanda Sharer in an open field. She had been stabbed, strangled, beaten and burned alive. Authorities quickly narrowed in on the killers â€” four teenage girls, three of whom had never met the victim until the night they kidnapped, tortured and lit her on fire. The story has captivated news headlines for 20 years, but for the first time on national television, Shandaâ€™s grief-stricken mother, Jacque, and sister, Paije, share their pain. Plus, donâ€™t miss the heart-wrenching confrontation Monday, when Jacque and Paije sit down with one of the four murderers since released from prison.
