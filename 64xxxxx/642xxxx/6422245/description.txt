REMEMBER!

1. All FASM releases were done by THE PEOPLE for THE PEOPLE, so if you think they
  are worthy share them anywhere you want, but if you like the movie, show your
  gratitude to the creators by going to cinema or buying Bluray/DVD!
_________________________________________________________________________________
2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
  nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
  from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
  movies at the significiant worse quality!! If you have any problemms with your
  video player check "Instruction for fixing your player problemms" folder.
_________________________________________________________________________________
3. Please COMMENT my work ONLY if you have actually seen it. If you LIKED this
  release - tell others about it. If you didnt, leave a comment saying  why, so
  I can learn from your opinions and provide you with something better in the
  future. Everything here has been done with the reason, so if you do not
  understand something dont assume its done bad. Of course we also make mistakes
  so any observation is welcome.
_________________________________________________________________________________
4. I have found that XBox360 can play stereo AAC directly and 5.1 through WINDOWS
  media center extender. For more info read this forum:
 
_________________________________________________________________________________
5. WDTV devices are causing so much problemms with AAC. I am not sure is this
  also the case with this release, so its better for me to give you stright link
  to the disscussion regarding this: http://wdtvhd.com/index.php?showtopic=23287
_________________________________________________________________________________
6. Movies can be directly streamed through WWW using Adobe Flash Player 9 or new.
_________________________________________________________________________________
7. FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer is h264 compression method optimized
  directly for lowbitrate HD contents. It is constantly being improved,  each
  revision brings quality to a new level. Its efficiency over standard x264
  encoding is explained by the same reason as XVID encodes are better than DIVX3
_________________________________________________________________________________
8. Any subtitles made for different releases, but taken from the same source
  (Bluray) should also work with this release. If you are looking for them visit
  http://subscene.com/
_________________________________________________________________________________
9. AAC sound must be decompressed and send through HDMI or SPDIF as PCM. Please
  also note that if you do have video card with HDMI that means you do have two
  different sound cards. Please make sure you do send the sound to the correct
  one. Its quite different from AC3/DTS where you send compressed sound directly
  from the source.
_________________________________________________________________________________
10. FASM 540p releases will concentrate almost totally on size to keep it as low
   as possible and STEREO sound to allow play these directly on most devices
   possible (even on newer cellphones.). Almost because the quality will be
   better than you expect it to be at this size...
_________________________________________________________________________________
11. FASM 720p releases will concentrate on the best balanced quality/size ratio,
   will introduce special cropped Fullscreen effect (no black bar), including
   true HD quality of the video and special stereo AAC LC sound to retain
   surround effects on small size. Such encodes should work directly on XBOX.
   If you want to know why it has been cropped check this out:

_________________________________________________________________________________
12. FASM 1080p releases will concentrate on quality, but the size will be low
   enough to fit below 4GiB limit and will contain AAC5.1 sound encoded to be
   almost transparent to source. The goal would be to create Rip with quality
   better than Bluray original itself (without guarranty that the size limit
   allows it).
