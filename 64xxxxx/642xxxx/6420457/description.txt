Sensitive film about school life

Story: 

Young Stanley (Partho) and his friends would have a great time at school but for a bunch of surly -- and greedy -- teachers who insist on sharing their tiffin. Life becomes even more difficult when the Hindi teacher (Amole Gupte) forces Stanley to get his own tiffin box -- something he never does -- or stop coming to school. Can young Stanley meet the challenge? More importantly, why doesn\'t he bring his dabba....
