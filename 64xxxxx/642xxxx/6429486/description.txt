Gamera Super Monster is truly shameless, a color film that somehow makes a sad excuse to insert footage from the black & white original on someones TV set, this despite having the tech to create color screens on their living room walls. None of this is the fault of longtime series director Noriaki Yuasa, but the heads of slowly crumbling studio Daei, the higher-ups going in with the belief this would save them from bankruptcy. It didnt.

Super Monster landed nine years after what appeared to be the final in a growing line of Daei kaiju epics, Gamera vs. Zigra. While not quite on the same shoestring budget, Zigra remains a sorely lacking affair, concerned more with being a giant promotion for Sea World than anything else.

The true Gamera fans are groaning though, knowing that nearly every single clip from the film is stock footage from of the previous Gamera outings, and the new footage is so cheaply done, its to the point of unwatchable. Fast forwarding past the sheer nonsense that is presented here as narrative, (filled with so many glaring plot holes, logic gaps, and absurdities to the point of ridiculousness), you can catch up on an entire franchise in a mere hour or so.
