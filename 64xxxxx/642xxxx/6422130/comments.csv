,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-26T03:12Z,"May I offer a suggestion for a TV series to include on a trial basis in your tv packs, when it comes back?  BBC's Lip Service, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1533010/  which supposedly has been picked up for a second season.  Can't quite bring myself to download 550 MB episodes, even for Laura Fraser, unfortunately."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T06:39Z,"@formerly_azrielle: I watched first two episodes and decided that, provocative as is, that series cannot fit in my schedule. Sorry."
,ahmedv,2011-05-26T07:12Z,Thanks - Live long and Prosper!
,tylr,2011-05-26T08:56Z,"@formerly_azrielle :
i dont think many others in tpb are as conserves as tf'y, 'Lip service' did sound cool!

@tf'y :
thanks for ur releases, as always.. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T09:47Z,"I still have right to choose. BTW, what defines ""conservative"" varies.
For instance, I would never ever upload gay movies, porn or violence toward animals.

Plenty of other uploaders are specialized for that. Not me.
I do like provocative shows - but that is (as many other things) things that each person should treat as - personal and not fed public who is not interested (0.4% of gay population should stop to force-feed the majority, each his own).

FYI, there are dozens of better shows, which I have no interest about - much better than Lip Service. By miles better..."

@anyone who has downloaded ""IT""

SRC rips.. usually comes with watermarks & piracy statements...
how bad is it on this one... or is it clean..
pls someone reply.
tnx"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-26T22:10Z,"RE: Lip Service.
I...have never seen it--just read about it researching what Laura Fraser (who played the female blacksmith in A Knight's Tale) was doing lately--and it looked interesting, if a bit provocative.  Just didn't want to waste 550 MB of download time--and disk space--for less than an hour's worth of viewing time (the ""standard"" 350 MB for non-20-40 TV shows is bad enough!)."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-26T22:11Z,"And, I trust 20-40's judgement on this, as with most."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-26T22:16Z,"@abciscrazy
You've been here long enough to KNOW that twentyforty doesn't encode SHIT--specifically, very few TSs/Screeners/Cams make the cut.  For that reason, even though I actually have downloaded it, I am not going to dignify your question with a direct answer."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T07:21Z,"@abciscrazy: Azrielle is right, and - I would NEVER lie about the source.. Download other ""R5"" or ""DVDrips"" of RedRiding and you'll see what I mean. However, video source DVD (shitty probably some wild copy for Iraqi market) and audio source is shitty line - it CANNOT be called R5 (as others did) because East European DVD is PAL 25 fps and NOT 29.97 fps as they are. Besides - it's 284 MB - keep that in mind - but I doubt you can, you've been rabid few times before."
