1) Did your computer came with pre-installed genuwine Windows?

2) What are you upgrading from and to?

3) Turn off internet security firewall

Thank you for responding ! Your work is always top notch ( But you know that !). I Have a PC that had a win 7 home edition. Over the course of time, I picked up one of our torrents for the Win 7 Pro and loaded in. Now of course, it keeps screaming for the genuine so I was looking for a way to do so. So that's where I am at now Boss. Any thoughts ? Thanks !!!!"

Your welcome. theLEAK previously uploaded this but took it down because theLEAK wanted to double check if it works. Result was that it works no matter how many times you've used it. 




@mark2sell

You could please clarify what you've said.

You've said that your computer came with a pre-installed genuine Windows 7 Home Edition. But instead you've installed Windows 7 Pro, which is a cracked version and a pop-up message keeps telling that the windows you're using is not genuine. Is that what you're trying to say?

theLEAK's suggestion would be is to back-up your files using a single or double-layer disc. Reboot (format) your computer. It will now restore its default Windows Home Edition. After it completes rebooting and installed the default application, download this torrent again and copy and paste the serial. This is probably the best solution however the decision is yours."

Thanks for the fine input. You have recapped my scenerio as it is. Your reccomendation is of no surprise to me. I can do as  you suggested but I wanted to avoid the whole process for obvious reasons.

Does this upgrade from Windows Vista 32bit to Windows 7, or from what to what? Thanks."
[T],theLEAK,2011-05-29T12:03Z,"@Makeswell


It is possible. According to http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/upgrading-windows-vista-home-premium-to-windows-7/5ab43965-9825-4748-b1f6-80aa2ff424be

There are two methods theLEAK would suggest. 

(1) Upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium first. After it's installed everything, download this again and upgrade to Windows 7 Pro or Ultimate.


(2) Get a cracked Windows 7 Home just the way papatony did. Activate it using loader 2.1 by daz and upgrade it


By the way please note that if method 1 works, your computer architecture (32-Bit) will not change to (64-Bit). 


Hope that works. "

To re-insert the product key, follow these steps:

**If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.**

This is the first time that theLEAK encountered this problem. 

Yes you could this product key to upgrade. However you cannot upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate though you could try to upgrade to Professional. Seeing as you have a netbook, Windows 7 Ultimate has lots of requirement. As for Professional it's possible though there's a small percentage of being successful.

After thorough research, it seems that your problem occurred through a failure of Windows Update


Here are some quick questions to answer.

1.	 Is your current Windows 7: (A) pirated or cracked or (b) Legit, pre-installed

2.	 If you said the letter A - pirated (cracked) version, how long have you used it?

3.	 What are your PCâ€™s specs?

Thanks for checking.  Windows is legit OEM version, x64 Home Premium on Intel i7 920, 12G

Windows update and everything else functions fine. Never a problem. 

Visual Studio 2010 is installed.  I saw something somewhere about uninstalling C++ then doing the install, but considering how MS has every tiny component as a separate item in the control panel, uninstalling C++ at this point would be almost impossible without screwing up all kinds of stuff.

As for changing the key, I found out that doesn't matter. Though in case anyone is wondering what to do to remove the stored Anytime Upgrade Product Key, you just need to delete the ProductKey value in the following registry location first:
	HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsAnytimeUpgrade\

**A = Yes but you need to download and install a full crack of Windows 7. Firstly, download this torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5819873 Next, burn it in a DVD-RW. Install it.

Aftwards, download this: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5206114/Windows.7.Loader.v1.7.7r-DAZ or http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5472998/ This will activate the serial and removed WAT

If you successfully install Windows 7 Home Premium, you can use any of these serial to upgrade to either Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate. 


2. do i HAVE TO make a backup?
A = Yes if you don't have Windows 7 already. If you do have a pre-installed Windows 7 then there's no need to back it up. Just open Anytime Upgrade and copy and paste the serial located in the .txt file. Of course these product keys will not work if you already have Windows 7 Ultimate as it is the highest version of Windows 7.


If you still have problems simply post a comment back.

however the download hangs on the ""starting upgrade"" part of the download ?

do you know why ? or a fix for it? i've tried multiple times yet with no change.

im currently using Windows 7 home premium 64 bit and hoping to upgrade to either premium or ultimate 

and it is the OEM install"

,glblist,2011-12-11T02:02Z,"I've tried restarting both BEFORE and AFTER selecting ""Upgrade"" and neither times does it start to Upgrade. Not sure what I'm doing wrong? Can anyone please provide a step-by-step guide?

I'm running Win 7 Starter on HP Mini."
,glblist,2011-12-11T02:29Z,"UPDATE!

It's installing Windows 7 Professional right now!

This is what I did:
1. Type in the keys (DO NOT COPY AND PASTE, IT WILL NOT WORK)
2. Let it verify the key (could take a while)
3. Once it verifies the key, accept the terms.
4. Some have said to NOT click Upgrade and just restart. But that hasn't worked for me. I clicked Upgrade and re-started RIGHT AWAY. Do not exit the Upgrade window. Just go to Start > Restart. 
5. Hopefully when your PC restarts, it says ""Upgrading Windows"" and you should have the your new OS on the bottom of the blue loading screen. (Mine used to say ""Windows 7 Home"" and now it says ""Windows 7 Professional""). 

Hope that helps! Good luck!"
