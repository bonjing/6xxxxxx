Video: Xvid 688x384 25.00fps 1227Kbps
Audio: Dolby AC3 48000Hz stereo 448Kbps

English Subtitles are included.

I have done my best to keep it closest to DVD quality. In fact, I have played both the DVD and this file and not found a shred of difference. I may, however, be not entirely correct. Do come up with any better suggestions you guys might have. I will try if I can do better. Do not forget to comment on A/V quality. Your satisfaction is my reward. Cheers.  "
