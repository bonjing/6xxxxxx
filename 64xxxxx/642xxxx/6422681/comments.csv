,ANZ85,2011-06-26T05:24Z,You need to go to EventViewer to see what's causing this.After that I can help you.

,ANZ85,2011-06-26T16:44Z,"Install first the update 9.1 and if does not work after that disable traffic or scan for double afcads(if you installed my other torrent,update 1.01 for LEBL,you must rename the file AF2_LEBL_12.bgl or delete it)."
