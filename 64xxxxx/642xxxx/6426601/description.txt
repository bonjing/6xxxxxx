House of Night -03 Chosen-P.C Cast-viny

Dark forces are at work at the House of Night and fledgling vampyre Zoey Redbirdâ€™s adventures at the school take a mysterious turn.  Those who appear to be friends are turning out to be enemies.  And oddly enough, sworn enemies are also turning into friends.  So begins the gripping third installment of this â€œhighly addictive seriesâ€ (Romantic Times), in which Zoeyâ€™s mettle will be tested like never before.  Her best friend, Stevie Rae, is undead and struggling to maintain a grip on her humanity. Zoey doesnâ€™t have a clue how to help her, but she does know that anything she and Stevie Rae discover must be kept secret from everyone else at the House of Night, where trust has become a rare commodity.  Speaking of rare: Zoey finds herself in the very unexpected and rare position of having three boyfriends. Mix a little bloodlust into the equation and the situation has the potential to spell social disaster.  Just when it seems things couldnâ€™t get any tougher, vampyres start turning up dead. Really dead. It looks like the People of Faith, and Zoeyâ€™s horrid step-father in particular, are tired of living side-by-side with vampyres.  But, as Zoey and her friends so often find out, how things appear rarely reflects the truthâ€¦
