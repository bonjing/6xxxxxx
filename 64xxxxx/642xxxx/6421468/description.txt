lyrics
 All Love Of Mine
With A Song And A Whine
You're Harsh And Divine
Like Truths And A Lie

But The Tale Ends Not Here
I Have Nothing To Fear
For My Love Is Hell Of Giving And Hold On

And The Bright Emptiness
In A Room Full Of It 
Is A Cruel Mistress
Woah Oh!

I Feel This Unrest
That Nest All Hollowness
For I Have Nowhere To Go In The Cold

And I Feel So Lonely
There's A Better Place Than This
:Emptiness

And I'm So Lonely
There's A Better Place Than This

Emptiness, Yeaheaeah!

Tune Mere Jaana
Kabhi Nahi Jaana
Ishq Mera, Dard Mera, Haaye..!

Tune Mere Jaana
Kabhi Nahi Jaana
Ishq Mera, Dard Mera

Aashiq Tera
Bheed Me Khoya Rehta Hai, Jaane Jahaan
Poochho To Itna Kehta Hai

That I Feel So Lonely
There's A Better Place Than This
:Emptiness

And I'm So Lonely
There's A Better Place Than This
:Emptiness, Yeaheah!
