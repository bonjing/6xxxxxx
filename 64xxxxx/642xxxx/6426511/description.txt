"Perhaps the ultimate anti war film " - Hollywood Reporter

A powerful and emotionally devastating record of the impact the 2008-2009 bombings of Gaza had on the civilian population.

Disturbing, powerful and emotionally devastating, Tears of Gaza is less a conventional documentary than a record â€“ presented with minimal gloss â€“ of the 2008 to 2009 bombing of Gaza by the Israeli military. Photographed by several Palestinian cameramen both during and after the offensive, this powerful film by director Vibeke LÃ¸kkeberg focuses on the impact of the attacks on the civilian population.
