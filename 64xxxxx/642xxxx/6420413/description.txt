Even though everything Philip Glass does nowadays sounds the same, this is my favorite soundtrack to listen to, at least while reading or studying.

This is my first torrent, so pre-emptive apologies if I\\\'ve fucked it up.  And I didn\\\'t assemble the underlying files. They\\\'re from another torrent, but because I never have any leechers I\\\'m re-introducing it on the Pirate Bay.
