Ophidian

Real Name: Conrad Hoyer

   2001. In this year Conrad joined Enzyme Records, started building his own      
   studio and started his studying Music Technology at the Utrecht School of Arts.
   He decided to drop the Trypticon-project and concentrate on producing as        
   Ophidian, focussing on slower hardcore, with more techno and electronic music  
   influences.
   Enzyme started a sub-label called Enzyme X on which more experimental hardcore  
   could be released, which came as a blessing because it provided exactly the 
   space that Conrad needed to define himself and his style.
   From this moment on progression was fast, and he released quite a number of   
   tracks including his first solo-album, Ophidian - Blackbox, in 2003.
   Now Conrad has finished his study and as Bachelor of Music Composition and 
   Production he faces a future in the music bussiness, as a producer mixing and 
   mastering, as DJ and live performer, but still mainly as artist exploring the 
   more experimental areas of hardcore, techno and electronic music.
   As of the summer of 2005, Ophidian runs his own label called Meta4.
