Well, theyâ€™re adorable, cute, and cuddly. These googly-eyed little balls of fur giggle, squeak, and sneeze as you poke and push them across the grid. Theyâ€™re also explosive when they get together in a group of three or more. And thereâ€™s only one way to make Chuzzels happy: pop â€˜em. Just slide, prod, and nudge the Chuzzles with a touch of the finger to match three or more (up and down, across, or both), and send fur flying and eyeballs bouncing. Once you start popping Chuzzles you might not be able to stop.
