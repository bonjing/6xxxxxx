,xD1337x,2011-05-30T05:35Z,"Why you don't make the sound 5.1 baffles me. You have the best resolution, and size for the video, and adding in 2 channel sound is a disgrace to your releases.
Until you release 5.1, you won't be as big of a releaser as you could be. HDScene puts out 5.1 and they're very popular, even though your video quality is superior. 
If people are going to download a 700MB movie, they're not going to mind another 75-150MB or whatever it takes."
