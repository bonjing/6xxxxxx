I started to download this YEARS ago from ""sharing the groove"" before that went west leaving me missing a number of the CDs (I only managed to snag 62 of them) . It is AWESOME to set it here in FLAC format - I will be seeding this baby for EVER. Thanks a million times."

TexxUK - I'm indebted to you, and will both dl, and seed, these files"
,TexxUK,2011-05-26T17:42Z,"None of the credit is due to me. I downloaded this from another site and I had difficuty seeding it there so I uploaded it here. I just added a few more tags.
I would have put it up here anyway, it's just too good a set not to be heard.

I guess it will only be real fans that will download nearly 14gb, I will seed it as much as I can."
,TexxUK,2011-05-30T16:42Z,Good to see a few seeders now. Keep it up folks!
