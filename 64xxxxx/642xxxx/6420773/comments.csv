[T],thetorrentlord,2011-05-25T19:00Z,I guess I'll have to but stock in Samsung and take a vacation in South Korea. Thanks for all the uploads.  Just curious as to how you keep all these files organized from the start of the season till the end? I always misplace at least one episode when I try to save a whole season. Any tips?
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-25T19:43Z,Always categorise and you will be fine.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-05-25T23:03Z,@GoodFilms: I might be able now that I have a couple of 2TB drives. Might make it possible to keep it all organized starting with this summers new shows. In the past it was scattered among 8 to 10 smaller drives. Thanks for the tip. Suggestions are always welcome.
