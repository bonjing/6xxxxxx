,ZaRiRTRO,2011-06-02T01:00Z,"Didnt fix anything for me.
Program still bugs."
,Vegasbob,2011-06-02T13:21Z,"Sorry am I reading the install inst correct? Unpack the original Brink-Skidrow upload of the game, RUN THIS UPDATE, THEN Install the game? Maybe this is the problem some people are having?"
,ZaRiRTRO,2011-06-02T16:57Z,Trust me i alrdy tested most ways it could posibly be done. Some of the updates needed to be aplied before you installed the game. The last couple of updates just needed to be run after install..
,didii,2011-06-02T23:25Z,"@Vegasbob: The install refers to the update, not the whole game :)

Thanx for the updates Skidrow!"
,didii,2011-06-02T23:27Z,"Ow, yeah and for those with an ATI Radeon graphics card: if the game doens't run well check for an update of your graphics card, one has released shortly, performance of Brink should increase."
,l0ran,2011-06-05T13:25Z,Do we need to install update 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 before installing the 5 ? 
,Henrys00,2011-06-07T18:36Z,"You don't need to have any of the previous updates installed, as this
update is featuring all previous updated content."

,odinknight,2011-06-08T10:21Z,any 1 got sound probs?
,Megazarth,2011-06-08T16:14Z,"Hey man nothing change.Could you upload a lag fix cause this game is laggy, not because my computer isn't achieve minimum specs."
,Monniker,2011-06-18T21:52Z,It works with the updates! Thanks.
,prov1ball,2011-06-24T09:12Z,"i think its better than the 1st update, but I'm still getting random crashes.  

I am also having sound issues, like a broken record.  Keeps repeating/hanging up."
