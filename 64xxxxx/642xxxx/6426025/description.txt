The swinging late end of the sixties at Oxford.  Filmed at the university and apparently with a fair amount of cooperation with the students (especially on the clothing styles), this story follows the trials and tribulations of a young Italian man who just doesn't quite fit the mold of Oxfordiana... or isn't allowed to fit.  Plenty of racism pointed in his direction, he cautiously develops a plan, whether it is trying to keep his position (by joining the crew team) or exacting a very convoluted revenge.

The atmosphere at Oxford seems relaxed, for the time, and only to a certain point.  Jane does doff the requisite amount of clothing. 

Directed by Ugo Liberatore.

A fairly good transfer at 2.35:1 for what seems to be a fly-by-night distributor. A small amount of throw-away extras.
