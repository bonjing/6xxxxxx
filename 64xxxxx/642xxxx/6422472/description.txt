plot

The Chicago Outfit was the most powerful organized crime syndicate of the 20th century, and Lou Marazano (Frank Vincent) was their deadliest hit man. Twenty years after his most notorious wave of hits, Lou is a relic, his legend obscured, his talents forgotten...his glory days over. When high-profile union representative Joe Barbone is arrested for tax fraud, the Outfit's top boss (Armand Assante) orders a string of key witnesses silenced before the government can uncover a vast conspiracy involving police officers, city officials, and mob affiliates. When Lou finds out about the job, he sees an opportunity to finance his retirement and leave Chicago with his girlfriend (Kathrine Narducci). But when relentless detectives (Danny Goldring & Stacy Keach) begin nipping at his heels, and the acting street boss, (Mike Starr) who is looking to make his promotion permanent, decides to revoke Lou's membership to the Outfit - Lou must prove he is worthy of being the Outfit's most deadly hit man - a title he held over twenty years ago.
