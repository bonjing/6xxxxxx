,thegunisgood,2011-05-26T09:10Z,installed game version is invalid or incomplete
,peter980,2011-05-26T09:45Z,"You need ""clean"" retail release.

Either remove GoG exe or skidrow crack and it will install properly.

It doesn't even require crack, since DRM is removed."
,cloakengaged,2011-05-26T11:40Z,then someone pls send us original paul.dll and witcher2.exe.
,DDDank,2011-05-26T12:41Z,"ye it works, just like peter said, clean installed no need for cracks anymore cause drm is removed.
it also comes the troll dlc with it"
,montanamb,2011-05-26T12:50Z,"Yep, we do appreciate if someone can upload the original .exe and .dll! I was just switched to gog crack yesterday and unfortunatly I didn't backed up the skidrow crack. Irony is that you cant make it to skidrow crack again, because it's patch style too, so you get the same ""Installed game version invalid or incomplete"" error. But CDProjekt removed the patches from their site anyway. That means something is wrong."
,thecheesemonkey,2011-05-26T13:00Z,"Confirmed as working. 

What I did :-

1. Install SKIDROW version of game

2. Run Patcher_EFIGS (Do NOT copy paul.dll over)

3. Run this Patch"
,IgotNoPatience,2011-05-26T13:02Z,"same thing, invalid or incomplete game version, original .exe and .dll would be nice =)"
,crazybaby,2011-05-26T13:14Z,"it didnt released yet!!! have fun with your backdoor or whatever it is.

Patch 1.1 Update
May 26, 2011, 11:16 a.m.

The good news is that the patch is ready. The bad news is that we have encountered some problems with the server infrastructure, making downloading DLCs impossible. We want to apologize to our fans for not meeting our target of delivering the patch last night. We will update you when we know more. "
,Dhatz,2011-05-26T13:23Z,are u stupid enough to not backup original files?
,cloakengaged,2011-05-26T13:40Z,@Dhatz send us your backups smart guy
,IgotNoPatience,2011-05-26T13:48Z,"@crazybaby:
It doesn't mean you can't download and install the patch manually..."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-26T15:17Z,"Witcher 2 Black Box version. same ""Game Version is Invalid or Incomplete"" on fresh install. Anybody got OG files from cloned OG disc?"
,rocco_sifredi,2011-05-26T15:21Z,excellent piece !! The game now works and I don't have to be worry about that paul.dll warning virus file. Thx a lot !
,semradjan,2011-05-26T17:16Z,"This is shit, dont work."
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T18:15Z,can anyone upload the original paul.dll and witcher2.exe pls i dont want to redownload the game i deleted the full game :/
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T18:56Z,crap now nothing is working guess i have to redownload the full game again sigh...
,AKERSEKOMIS,2011-05-26T19:30Z,"Works with skidrow version, although u have to do a clean install and apply update after efigs.exe.
The game runs great now but for some reason the trousers i had for Geralt dissapeared and he was rendered without legs lol! I had to buy new ones...."
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T20:23Z,AKERSEKOMIS can you upload the paul.dll and witcher2.exe from the original installation pls? i dont want to redownload the full game again :(
,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-26T20:51Z,"jus took 3 hrs to download 13+GB Skidrow version, pretty quick.
tried jus installing over my Blackbox version but EFIGS nor Patch would install. you do have to do a clean install of OG or Skidrow version for it to work."
,AKERSEKOMIS,2011-05-26T20:56Z,"@Dark1lla
U just need to reinstall the game dont download it again"
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T21:08Z,@AKERSEKOMIS the problem is i dont have the installation anymore xD
,Dark1lla,2011-05-26T21:09Z,just hoping someone could upload those 2 original files when you install the game maybe i can fix my game that way :( dont want to redownload it
,jauas,2011-05-26T21:12Z,"So I just uninstalled and reinstalled the Skidrow full 13gb version, applied the Patcher_EFIGS.exe, then tried to apply this - still giving me the same error.

Any ideas?"
,SS64084,2011-05-26T21:21Z,"Original Paul.dll and Witcher2.exe Uploaded by me - 1st torrent ever :)


http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377"
,SS64084,2011-05-26T21:32Z,"My upload seems small please note:

The Size increase after you use the Patcher_EFIGS.exe i will upload the new one - but you wont need it, so copy and paste the 2 files and run Patcher_EFIGS.exe from Skidrow folder then the 1.1 update."
,jauas,2011-05-26T22:03Z,"I figured out what the problem was - make sure to remove the troll.dzip file if you have it in your CookedPC folder. 

The 1.1 update will automatically give you it anyways!"
,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-26T22:19Z,"@Dark1lla,  the whole day u been on here askin for a upload of the files u coulda dloaded/installed it by now.
don't tell me it was just that troll DLC in the way all this time. if it is never woulda guessed."
,SS64084,2011-05-26T23:30Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425536

Paul.dll and Witcher2.exe after Patcher_EFIGS "
,soujiro14,2011-05-26T23:32Z,I'm just gonna wait for SKIDROW's version of this update.
,diehard222,2011-05-27T00:04Z,"Can u guys help me to clarify something

so i download the game run the skidrow patcher after this is just run the 1.1 update and that is that

i dont need to copy skidrow crack and paul.dll"
,Ultron,2011-05-27T00:13Z,"Pain in the ass for anyone who couldn't get skidrows EFIGS patch to work, which i never could. Even with a fresh install, and clean files, still get that incorrect version error. Get the same thing with this patch."
,Exerz,2011-05-27T01:39Z,"I appreciate your effort, but this torrent is unnecessary. 

For the latest patch just go here: http://www.en.thewitcher.com/patch/

Make sure you get the right patch, and remove the Troll Trouble DLC from your ""CookedPC"" folder (it is included in the patch, and old files may cause an error)."
,hhgstr,2011-05-27T05:07Z,does this patch make any real difference
,ZtorkX86,2011-05-27T06:29Z,Anyone that got this to work? In theory you wouldn't need a crack if you get the patch to work properly right? :)
,wwell988,2011-05-27T07:12Z,"What do you mean by ""Skidrow's version of this patch""? The game is DRM free now. Just torrent the retail version, patch it and play."
,montanamb,2011-05-27T13:11Z,"If anyone having the ""invalid or incomplete"" error, try this:

Before patching delete any DLC you might have in the CookedPC Folder like troll.dzip

1.Replace the cracked files with the original files:

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377/The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EXE_-_SS

2.Run Patcher_EFIGS from the skidrow crack. Dont copy paul.dll

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

3. Install the patch 1.1

I patched the game just like this without any problems.
Thanks to gani.slimshady for instructions."
,Exerz,2011-05-27T21:56Z,"If you have the SKIDROW release, you will not need to remove the game except or reinstall or anything. Just remove the Troll.dzip and then run the patch. Works like a charm. "
,razor0512,2011-05-29T19:35Z,Does this work in the Black Box version?
,Rovlad84,2011-05-30T04:21Z,"The game is DRM free as of patch 1.1 (yes, ANY version of it). You don't even have to download patches from http://en.thewitcher.com/patch/ or whatever. Just install the game, put ANYTHING in activation code field (like 12345 for example) and let it auto-update. Then just run it and play, there is NO NEED for cracks or any other files. You also get Troll Trouble installed automatically."
,ThePirateMachine,2011-05-30T07:00Z,"ok. so ive put back the original files and removed troll.zip, then when il run the patcher_efigs.exe, it still has the error. i accidentally pasted the skidrow patcher_efigs.exe into my directory. is that a bad thing? help? :D"
,Ultron,2011-05-30T08:46Z,"Yea, removing troll.dzip doesn't work for me either, not really surprised though. None of the patches have ever worked. The game runs fine though, I'm just one of those people that likes to have everything up to date, regardless."
,nikrusty,2011-05-31T20:52Z,"Perfect follow these instructions as stated by montanamb. Thanks montanamb
