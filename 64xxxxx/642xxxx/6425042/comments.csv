,The.Buzzsaw,2011-05-29T07:09Z,"Its seeding now, I was gone to take my leukemia treatment and my roommate shut the computer off thinking he's helping out with the electric bill. I told him to try paying some of it if he wanted to help out and to never touch this computer again. Where I try to put rare shows online that can't normally be found, I am the only seeder until those that will help seed get the file. Over 200 people have downloaded this file and not 1 is helping me seed right now. I have it seeding by itself until I get some backup on the seeding. I apologize for the inconvenience and whoever gave me the negative quality rating is a whiny bitch. At least I put it on here for everybody pal. All The.Buzzsaw files are excellent quality. I will NOT upload a shitty file period! If you want cam quality or that TS shit, you'll have to go somewhere else. We are straight DVD quality or better. That being said, show your appreciation for files that you like, help feed the need and SEED!"

,The.Buzzsaw,2011-05-30T00:25Z,"Your welcome guys. It feels good to know that I've brought a little bit of entertainment that was enjoyed immensely to so many people across the web. Where this site gets flooded with fake torrents, useless bullshit, and just plain ol' junk all day, you almost have to catch one of my uploads within minutes of it being posted or it'll pass you by and be on page 50 in recent torrents before you know it. I suggest clicking on my name The.Buzzsaw and browsing the selection. I recommend highly Bullet, Blood in blood out, and All the Trailer Park Boys."
