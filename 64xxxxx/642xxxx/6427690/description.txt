Sound Kapital is the heavily electronic third album by Handsome Furs (led by Wolf Parade co-frontman Dan Boeckner) following their 2009 release, Face Control. It includes "What About Us" and "Repatriated," both of which have been unveiled by the band, though to my knowledge an actual single has not been announced as of yet. The album is set for official release on June 28, 2011. It's terrific, so enjoy it and don't forget to seed!
