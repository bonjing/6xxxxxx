This is my own cut/edition of the original Black Swan movie removing all the o.t.t. sex, violence, drugs and horror so we could show it to our 12 year old ballet daughter. I think it is an inspiring film all ballerinas should watch, and with this version, now younger dancers and performers can enjoy it without the excessess. Enjoy it!
