Wiltonâ€™s Music Hall in East London is full of ghosts. The worldâ€™s oldest surviving â€œgrand music hallâ€, its 150-year-old floorboards and peeling walls played host to Victorian music stars, the anti-fascist warriors of Cable Street and, itâ€™s said, Britainâ€™s first cancan. Now, materialising out of a side door, is another phantom: pale, delicate face, pierced nose, jet-black hair, long flowing coat. Wiltonâ€™s is a special place for Marc Almond; it is where, last year, he chose to perform his first solo concert after the motorcycle accident that left him in a two-week coma in 2004.
