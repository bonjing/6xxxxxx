to make one file and playable on ps3, just use mkvmerge and upload both cd's be sure to fix the delay in each ac3 file i believe it was 6999ms in first and 28ms for second. Again mkvmerge to make one file just mux, but for ps3 there is a delay so do as i said above. Works perfectly when done right, hope this helps. To be a dick about something free that you simply just dont understand is beyond me. Thanks to the uploader!"
