The film stars Adrien Brody as Royce, a mercenary who reluctantly leads a group of elite warriors who come to realize they've been brought together on an alien planet... as prey. With the exception of a disgraced physician, they are all cold-blooded killers â€“ mercenaries, Yakuza, convicts, death squad members â€“ human "predators" that are now being systemically hunted and eliminated by a new breed of alien Predators.
