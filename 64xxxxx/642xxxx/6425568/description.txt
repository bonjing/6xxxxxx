Logos / Rough Trade EP is the second studio album from ambient experimental project Atlas Sound. It was released on October 19, 2009, in Europe by 4AD, and on October 20 in the US by Kranky Records, both of which released Atlas Sound's previous effort, Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See but Cannot Feel. The album features guest contributions from Noah Lennox (a.k.a. Panda Bear of Animal Collective) and Stereolab's Laetitia Sadier. Units ordered directly from Rough Trade came packaged with a bonus six-song EP of leftover material. The album reached #7 on the Billboard Heatseekers album chart. The cover art is an image of Bradford Cox, who suffers from Marfan syndrome, and is inspired by the photograph featured on the cover of Let the Blind Lead.... Rhapsody called it the 5th best album of 2009.
