When socialite Alexis realizes that she only seems to be attracted to working class men, she decides to seek help. Afraid that there's something wrong with her, Alexis heads to a medical clinic and bursts into the first doctor's office she can find, hoping to cure her ailment. What she doesn't know is that Dr. Mick is really a blue collar worker in disguise, and he plans on dipping his mop into her bucket before he goes back to washing the floors!
