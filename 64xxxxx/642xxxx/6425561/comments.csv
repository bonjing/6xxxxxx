,dcamp67,2011-05-29T07:37Z,Thanks man good quality a little out of time but otherwise good for the size. This dick dont know what he is on about :P
,retux,2011-05-30T11:38Z,"@DumbDude1994 : Actually you can find a lot of movies that people upload that are hi-def and ridiculously small in size.

For example, couple hours ago I downloaded these movies:
X-Men Origins: Wolverine - 401mb
The Dilemma - 333mb
Faster - 246mb
Domino - 367mb
The Hangover - 336mb

All downloaded from a member on here named Pruny. He has a bunch of videos and uploads that are small in size but still look great."

That Dick is too dumb to understand encoding. This is clean and good. Keep up the good work."
,frogshare,2011-06-16T18:42Z,"Finally someone who knows how to make a good rip. This is the most reasonable way to make a rip. Small size, but good quality, because of wise choice of frame size. All those '720p' rips of 500-700MB on TPB are mostly of shit quality, because it simply doesn't work to squeeze that resolution into such small filesize. And so those rips turn out to be nothing more than a crapload of artefacts at big framesize. And actually, 480p at same filesize looks way better. But those 720p braggers like YIFY don't have a clue about ripping. And so they spread their garbage on TPB and think it's good quality. But it's just rubbish. It's like those dudes who buy a computer based on the number of Ghz instead of the actual overall performance. Same principle goes for many leechers on TPB. Too many of them are too easily impressed by the sheer number of pixels. And so they download the '720p' artefacts garbage instead of the good stuff at 480p.

Therefore, I'm pleased to see someone who knows the correlation between framesize, filesize and quality.

Very good job, P4R4DOX. Hope to see more of your rips. Thanks!"
