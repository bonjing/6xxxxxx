An Arabian sailor named Sinbad is on a quest to find the magical legendary Book of Peace, 

a mysterious artifact that Eris, the Greek wicked goddess of chaos, 

has ultimately framed him for stealing! If he fails on this quest, 

his childhood friend Prince Proteus of Syracuse will take Sindbadâ€™s death penalty, 

while Eris gains a desired foothold of power in the world of mortals.
