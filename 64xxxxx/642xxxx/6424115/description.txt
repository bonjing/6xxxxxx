Strange Angels-02 Betrayals-viny

Sheâ€™s no angel . . .

Poor Dru Anderson. Her parents are long gone, her best friend is a werewolf, and sheâ€™s just learned that the blood flowing through her veins isnâ€™t entirely human. (So what else is new?)

Now Dru is stuck at a secret New England School for other teens like her, and thereâ€™s a big problemâ€” sheâ€™s the only girl in the place. A school full of cute boys wouldnâ€™t be so bad, but Druâ€™s killer instinct says that one of them wants her dead. And with all eyes on her, discovering a traitor within the Order could mean a lot more than social suicide. . .

Can Dru survive long enough to find out who has betrayed her trustâ€”and maybe even her heart?
