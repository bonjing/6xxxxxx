My internet line is really but really shity... so : 
When it is windy , electric (so internet included) go off for a few secs or so ...
When it is pissing down electric and (then) internet go off ofr a few secs or so and best of it :
When it is both raining and windy as electric go off we find ourself with no more water ina tap... as it is an electronic pump that carry the water to my small village around... 

This is why sometimes you might think (when i first upload the torrent... ?) ""wtf is he doing sharing/not sharing/sharing/...etc 
Now you know :D

This is what it takes to be a GanJAH farmer in a lost countryside village ... 

all of dat ....  lol ĂÂŁNJ0Y this SKype one & all !

JAH JAH blessed love !"
