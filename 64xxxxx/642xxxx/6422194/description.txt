SYNOPSIS
Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) drives the streets of Los Angeles as if she belonged. Regarding his team of people, in fact belong to him. He spends his days fine-tuning race cars, high performance: the make and model matter less than the injection system controlled by computer that makes them fly through the air. At night, Dom pilots his own car, pocketing $ 10,000 when someone has the courage to challenge him in a race. The races are street theater, battlefield and tribal meeting, fueled by adrenaline, sexual tension and speed out of control wild.
