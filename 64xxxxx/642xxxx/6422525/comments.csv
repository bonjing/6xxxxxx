[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-25T18:58Z,Thx as always MM82 - Keep it up :D
,ninki312,2011-05-25T19:05Z,seed please!
,ninki312,2011-05-25T19:12Z,pretty sure this is fake since its not supposed to be released until the 26th
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-25T20:04Z,"MM82 doesnt do fakes, strange though that its not being seeded???"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-25T20:05Z,"Also, it should be obvious that most of the people who scan and upload these comics, work at comic stores, hence they have access to most comics and receive them before they hit shelves. "
,dicktator,2011-05-25T21:24Z,Enjoy and seed the guy says. How about seeding a little yourself?
,NEL117,2011-05-26T09:07Z,MARAMING SALAMAT! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
,JebusKryst,2011-05-26T10:22Z,"this got released yesterday so its probably ok.
dont forget to buy if you like"
,BlackOneAZDH,2011-05-29T04:33Z,umm... yeah no. not issue 85
,BlackOneAZDH,2011-05-29T04:34Z,"wait never mind, i'm dumb....sorry. torrent is all good."
,pow.r.pop,2011-05-29T12:40Z,"6 issues now and the plot is getting stale.

They need to get back on the road or do something interesting.

I'm getting bored with this crap.

Nothing is happening !!!!!! "
,drunkjoker333,2011-05-30T16:50Z,"I love this  comic, I wonder when the next season of the show will come on"
,creep2maniac,2011-05-31T08:49Z,hoy mga cholokoys dawat nlang sa libre wanay daghang storya. hehehe! cheers mirrormaster82
,phattsao,2011-06-04T15:17Z,"Torrent is good, but comic is getting stupid.  Where's the suspense if they can just stand around with baseball bats and kill thousands of zombies?  Why do they ever even bother running?  This is like the 4th time that's happened in this series and it's getting a wee bit lame.  "
,somedude.1001,2011-06-04T16:51Z,yeah Ive been saying that for the last 2 years and have stopped following this comics... the quality went to shit once they had that TV series going. the author said he wouldnt let this happen but it did anyhow. very disappointing.
,AndroidLove,2011-06-04T18:22Z,"Being a (...ummm..now confused)... die hard Walking Dead fan, I was just going to say - what are you talking about? The series is even what got me here in the first place and read all 84 editions of the comic.... while this was downloading....
...and then I read this edition #85.....

Wow! this episode must have seriously been the lamest shortest edition yet! And I'm one of those guys who would defend it to the death seeing what a great comic it's been so far... but yeah this issue sucked donkey d**k! 

Hopefully it gets better and a lot more conflict kicks back in... else it's just going to turn into some zombie version of the Smurfs"
,Tripper4420,2011-06-21T05:02Z,"@AndroidLove

you must have a horrible connection if you were able to read 84 comics while downloading 39 mb of data.  It took me 15 seconds to download this...."
