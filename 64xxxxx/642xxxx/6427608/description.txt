This is the second collection of maps for use with Garmin's MapSource software.

(Part 1 is here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6424887/Garmin_City_Navigator_Maps_(MapSource))

Using this software (and others as listed in my 'Instructions.txt' file), you can create your own custom maps which can be saved or directly transferred in the standard 'gmapsupp.img' format to your Garmin device.

This gives you far more flexibilty than just porting a specific map region container file to your device, and can help with internal or micro SD memory constraints.

A lot of these maps are mainly slightly more detailed versions that you'll get with a 'continent' version. An example is Brazil which on it's own may have more road map detail than that included with the South America one. With the registry batch files included in each MapSource folder, you can pick and choose which to install - assuming you download them in the first place!

Enjoy.

P.S. If you know of locations to updated versions as of time of posting this torrent, please let me know.
