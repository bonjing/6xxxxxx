,morbus74,2011-05-28T18:50Z,Is the audio DTS or DD5.1? It says DTS but there is also (DD 5.1)..or is there both?
,Local-Man,2011-05-29T18:10Z,Quality?
,cpluszzz,2011-06-08T09:42Z,it's not retail.. its RC version.. they merged with bad english sub in it... guess gotta wait :( 
,USCP_Cp,2011-06-28T14:25Z,This is NO DTS 5.1! It is a 2.0 with echo or something like that encoded in a DTS 5.1 track!
