Well guyz this is original motion picture score form blade trinity,
These are not the songs which were used in movie..This is the complete backround music which was
composed by Ramin Djawadi(famous for the score of iron man 1 which was guitar based)

There is another official soundtrack released for this movie but it has only songs from
different composers..do dont get confused..if u want the backroud music of this movie 
then download this right now... 

I think this stuff was not released officially..
so,it took hours to find this stuff on the internet...enjoy the music...n keep sharing
