,themanuel08,2011-05-30T04:41Z,@babydollsuckerpunch yea the quality on the eng dubbed rip warrant that good this one is much better they are Japanese blu-ray rips http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6210311/H.O.T.D.%28Highschool_of_the_Dead%29-Vol_01-06_BD.Rip%28720p%29
,Darko2.0,2011-10-04T02:02Z,"why is it that the files don't have english as a choice for audio? This isn't dual audio, it's just subbed NOT dubbed."
,Darko2.0,2011-10-04T02:04Z,"My mistake only the OVA is japanese only, these ARE dubbed. my bad thanks for the upload"

,mrpool,2012-03-08T15:55Z,"i can't download !!! 

where is the Get Torrent File link ? :( 

and magnet link didn't worked for me :("
,aprosas,2012-03-22T15:52Z,"srry mrpool, TPB got rid of get torrent links because magnet link required less bandwidth; try using a different downloader like bit torrent 7.6, this should automatically pick up magnet links"
,Alphasibene,2012-04-01T17:58Z,"Is there a way to disable subtitles, seems a bit pointless having Subs with Dub"
,holehjebuz,2012-04-29T10:48Z,eh... ive been using the get torrent link for quite a while... how the hell do magnet links work? i have bittorrent 7.6 like aprosas suggested but.. uh... ugh... i dont know how
,holehjebuz,2012-04-29T11:06Z,yeah nevermind... i found out how to use magnet but it simply doesnt work... even with bit torrent 7.6 or utorrent 3.1... what a letdown TPB... dont fubar your own site...
