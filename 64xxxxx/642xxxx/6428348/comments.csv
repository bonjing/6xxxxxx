1:22:02. I've read there's a lot more cool scenes in the longer one. I haven't yet found a copy."
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-07-16T01:49Z,"My mistake... I checked and you're indeed correct that the file shows as 1:22:02. I guess I put the wrong number in before as I always go by the file not what anything else says the length is.

If you do find the uncut version, please post a link. Would like to get it. And thanks. :^)"
