Notes:

 - This is a reseed/mirror; not my encode. Another version is posted here ( http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4118973/Deranged.DvDrip.1974.KayzerZoze ) but this torrent has been dead for months.
 
 - Please make sure to seed as much as you download and do your part so that free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
