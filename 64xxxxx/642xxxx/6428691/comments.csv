,hello40204,2011-05-30T13:04Z,"okay. scenebalance, why do you bother to upload many movies if you can't seed them. this is not the first time , you do that, because you did the same with other moves i tried to upload and gave up. still o seeds even if they say there is 1 seeder . it seeds 0 and nothing is downloading 0.7%. at least seed or remove the movie if you cannot which i can understand ."
