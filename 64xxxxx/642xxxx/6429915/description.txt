AUDIO: ...... Thanx Matey 

NOTES:
Ok guys this one is REALLY late,but we've been busy with different things and what not...

Anyway for this we used PFD's release and the after end credit scene off our last release.

Now the video was nice,but very dark,dull,lacked colour.colours off and no english subs,just 

hardcoded german....Oh and its also cropped,so don't be fooled by those that say pfd's isn't  

For proof see our last release and look at the top...fair bit cropped Anyway ...somewhere in 

there with the right tweaking was/is a base for a good video....and we had to tweak this one 

loads to get that.

Changing brightness,contrast,rgb colours levels,sat,intes,sharpness....you name it Also we made 

our own srt file ....117 lines and then hardcoded them in yellow so it wasn't white over white 

with the subs.

Enjoy folks
