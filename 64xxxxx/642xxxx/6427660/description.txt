From the reviews:
â€œThe organization is clear and easy to follow with excellent illustrations. In addition to providing history lessons and details of discoveries throughout the ages â€¦ include several easy-to-do exercises such as assembling and using a cross-staff or making a telescope from common optics (e.g., discarded binocular parts). Several tables of interesting events including close conjunctions or brighter Messier objects offer an incentive for the reader to become an observer. â€¦ Summing Up: Recommended. General audiences.â€ (M. K. Hemenway, Choice, Vol. 48 (7), March, 2011)
Product Description
In 1609 Galileo first used his telescope to kick start the science of observational astronomy - an event that proved to be of enormous historic, scientific, and cultural importance. Galileo and 400 Years of Telescopic Astronomy will feature the life and achievements of Galileo, around which has pivoted the story of four centuries of telescopic astronomy. The book will detail how astronomy has progressed through four centuries and contain glimpses of future space research and astronomy goals. Uniquely, interwoven with the text will be a range of practical projects for backyard astronomers in which to participate, projects that serve to illustrate many of Galileo\'s scientific discoveries.
