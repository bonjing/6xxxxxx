|  Why we do an INT pre ?                                                    |
|  Suddenly after all those years, this kind of rlses are not accepted       |
|  anymore. The new scene rules sucks big time. Look at our last nukes.      |
|  Radio Express isn't a valid store anymore. It's true, Radio Express       |
|  isn't a normal shop, it's a radio service, delivering promo's. You got    |
|  to have a licence to have access, work for radio or be a registered       |
|  prof. DJ. What happened to the scene lately ? The scene used to be the    |
|  place to find all the latest promo's before they were in the stores.      |
|  Isn't that allowed anymore ? We are now in  2011, record companies won't  |
|  deliver promo cds anymore, it's all downloaded. And Radio Express is one  |
|  of those places. So how can we tag this rls ? As a -PROMO_WEB- ? That     |
|  option seems to be forgotten in the latest rules. We were never asked to  |
|  discuss about those new scene rules, and we didn't sign them either       |
|  (never asked). So we are left with one option, to release all our Radio   |
|  Express and Radio Ventures stuff as an -INT-. We are not happy about      |
|  this, makes us sad and frustrated, we used to do this for fun. But        |
|  where's the fun lately ?                                                  |
