Anna Strong 05 - Retribution - Jeanne C Stein-viny

With Belinda Burke, a powerful and deadly witch to track down, the last thing Anna needs is additional trouble with Williams. Warren Williams is the ex chief of police in San Diego, and a current leader in the local supernatural community. Their relationship has never been what Anna would consider good, but itâ€™s deteriorating to a point that could be dangerous to both of their undead lives. Williams has a score to settle and he has no trouble destroying anyone who gets in his way, but itâ€™s Anna who will ultimately put her life on the line and quite possibly save the supernatural population from a torturous and destructive future
