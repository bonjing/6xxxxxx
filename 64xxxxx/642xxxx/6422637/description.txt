***UPLOADERâ€™S NOTE*** - This is a rather low budget series of direct-to-video documentaries with cheap production values, making use of public domain old films and stock footage of re-enactors marching around. However, the information and graphics are accurate, and the interviewed professors and experts are quite good. If you want really shiny computer graphics, this isnâ€™t the collection for you, but if you want a straightforward and comprehensible explanation of some of the warâ€™s most important battles, this is a fine source. Iâ€™d also like to offer a shameless plug here for a torrent I created some time ago, which has a good deal more information on the war:

DVD DESCRIPTION

The American Civil War (1861-1865) is one of the greatest conflicts in the history of mankind, and the bloodiest and saddest war in American history. What began as a bitter dispute over union and States' Rights, ended as a struggle over the meaning of freedom in America. It saw the end of slavery. It inspired men who had never strayed far from their own front doors to become soldiers in great armies, and to fight in epic battles hundreds of miles from home. it was the first modern war and the costliest, yielding at least 600,000 casualties and unprecedented domestic suffering, both spiritually and physically. As a defining moment in United States history, our Civil War has no equal, which is why it remains such a fascinating subject even today.

The dramatic story of the Civil War unfolds as we relive the battles that helped save the nation, including Manassas, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Spotsylvania, Gettysburg and the final surrender at Appomattox.

Antietam

Antietam, the first major of the Civil War fought on Union soil, is considered the bloodiest single day of the war. This Union victory encouraged President Lincoln to make one of his best decisions, to issue the Emancipation Proclamation the following January.
