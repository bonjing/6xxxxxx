Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator 2.1.6 & 2.1.7 Beta 1

This is a set of tools and functions for managing licensing, deploying, and activating Office 2010. All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as this could conflict or damage Office 2010. The Channel Switcher, AutoKMS Uninstaller, AutoRearm Uninstaller, Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Office 2010 is not installed. For information about individual functions, read further below.

Readme:
Click The Readme Button in Office 2010 Toolkit program, and Copy Button to copy the tabbed section contents.

Requirements:
Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 (It is built into Vista/7 but XP users need to install this).
Office 2010 should be installed as most of the toolkit functions are obviously useless without Office 2010 installed.
