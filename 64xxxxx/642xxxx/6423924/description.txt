sArchiver 3.7.3 MacOSX

sArchiver is an archiving utility with great intuitive user friendly interface. Once it's placed on your dock you can decompress your downloads, mail attachments and all other archives you have directly by dropping them over the sArchiver's icon. If the archive is password protected, sArchiver automatically asks for the password before decompressing. After extraction it automatically opens the destination folder (can be toggled from the preferences) so you don't have to reach it manually.

The RAR compression format.
The RAR compression format is one of the best compression formats in the world.
Many archivers can compress in numberless formats but non of them can handle the RAR or they handle it incompletely.
sArchiver fully supports RAR compression and decompression.

Splitting archives.
sArchiver is also able to split archives to volumes with size of your choice.
Supported size formats are in Kilobytes, Megabytes and even Gigabytes!

Integrated archive convertor.
You can easily convert Rar, Zip, 7z, LHA, Arj archives to Rar, 7z, Zip.

sArchiver is able to create SFX (self extracting) archives.
Wouldn't it be great if you can archive your valuable data and transfer it somewhere else, without worrying about unarchivers?
sArchiver's SFX archives are extremely useful when transferring data from one computer to another or when exchanging data with person who may haven't installed the particular unarchiver.
sArchiver's SFX archive extracts itself without need of any applications or utilities.
You can also leave notes inside the archive for yourself or other person. It's useful if you want to leave a message or password hint for someone.
