Legends - Live At Montreux 1997


Release:2008

Genre: Jazz

Info:

Legends is one of the most musically accomplished super groups of all time. With Eric Clapton on guitar, Joe Sample of The Crusaders on keyboards, virtuoso saxophone player David Sanborn and super session players Steve Gadd on drums and Marcus Miller on bass, both of whom have done time in Claptonâ€™s band, the groupâ€™s pedigree is extraordinary. Marcus Miller put the Legends band together for a European tour in 1997. They never made an album and this concert at Montreux is the only record of their stunning collaboration. The music is an intoxicating blend of jazz, blues and rock, which gives each of the players a chance to shine but also emphasizes the wonderful chemistry they create as a group.
