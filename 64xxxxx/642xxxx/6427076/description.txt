SYNOPSIS                                                                     
                                                                             
A ruthless assassin has been hired to eliminate someone at the very top of 
the U.S. government. Constantly changing his identity and location, he is 
known only as the Jackal. Everything about this hit man, including his 
sinister timetable, is a secret.  
Aware of the Jackal's presence but uncertain of his purpose, the FBI's 
Deputy Director faces the biggest challenge of his career. In order to track 
down this coldblooded killer, he and a by-the-book Russian intelligence 
officer enlist the aid of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely 
allies enter a global race against the clock to stop the mysterious 
mercenary before he can complete his deadly assignment.
