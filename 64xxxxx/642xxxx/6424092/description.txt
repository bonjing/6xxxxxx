At the start of this mesmerizing new installment of the Immortals series, Ever is helping her friend Haven transition into life as an immortal.

Desperate to break free of this terrible curse before Damen or the twins can discover what sheâ€™s done, she turns to Jude and delves deeper and deeper into dark magick, ultimately risking everything she knows and lovesâ€”including Damen
