,ShepardM,2011-05-27T10:22Z,"just reinstall the game and will be automatically patched, when you requested the code, just press next or sent...amm one of the two was, i forgot and the game will be patched i use the skidrow version"
,montanamb,2011-05-27T11:09Z,"Yeah if anyone having the ""invalid or incomplete"" error, try this:

Before patching delete any DLC you might have put in the cooked PC Folder like Troll.Dzip

1.First replace the cracked files with the original files

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377/The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EXE_-_SS

2. Run only Patcher_EFIGS from the skidrow crack. Dont copy paul.dll

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

3. Install the 1.1 patch from the official website named ""Patcher_1.1_International""

I did this and patched the game.
Thanks to gani.slimshady for instructions

,svetkopetko5,2011-05-27T12:04Z,can you register the game after patching it?
,ShepardM,2011-05-27T12:45Z,@svetkopetko5 NO!

@montanamb

works perfect guys. thanks.. good work!"
,fungalinguistic,2011-05-27T18:29Z,"hey i followed your instructions to patch the game, and it worked successfully, but now my game wont even start. i recopied over the skidrow crack, but ive been waiting like more than ten minutes and nothing has happened"
,fungalinguistic,2011-05-27T18:32Z,"im also using the blackbox version, not sure if it matters"
,montanamb,2011-05-27T19:57Z,"@fungalinguistic:
Well, if you cracked the game after the patch, there's non need of this. Game has became DRM-free with this patch so you don't need a crack. Just launch the game after installing the patch. Also check out your options from the launcher. They are restoring to default after the patch. Hope you'll solve the problem soon. :)"
,welhung,2011-05-28T00:34Z,why don't you just upload this plug-n-play why all the drama over patches? Do it right!
,dylanjmartin,2011-05-28T06:01Z,it says it failed to creat temporary files
,unicron_tpb,2011-05-28T18:01Z,"If you already have cracked the game and downloaded a ""DLC pack 1"" torrent, you do not need this."
,Rovlad84,2011-05-30T04:22Z,"The game is DRM free as of patch 1.1 (yes, ANY version of it). You don't even have to download patches from http://en.thewitcher.com/patch/ or whatever. Just install the game, put ANYTHING in activation code field (like 12345 for example) and let it auto-update. Then just run it and play, there is NO NEED for cracks or any other files. You also get Troll Trouble installed automatically."
,forcepsdragonlord,2011-05-31T23:02Z,"Is this working with 'black box' version of torrent ??!

PLEASE someone answer?"
,smoketwojoints,2011-06-01T12:55Z,"Just a heads up to people planning on updating: they 'optimized' the game by butchering the graphics settings, it seems they have gimped the level of detail particularly on grass and foliage. I have downgraded to 1.0 and I suggest anyone who's PC can handle it do the same."
,montanamb,2011-06-02T19:02Z,"@forcepsdragonlord
Yes, it works. Just follow the instructions I wrote on previous comments."
,kct810,2011-06-02T20:46Z,"Every time I try to run the patcher it says ""failed to creat temporary files"". Help Please, I'm at a loss."
,Drugoh,2011-06-03T00:28Z,"I patched this using montanamb's instructions, I was hoping it would fix some of the frame issues I had, but when I try to start the game an error pops up stating ""please use launcher to activate game"", regardless if I open it with the launcher or in the ""bin"" folder. Cracked or not. Anyone know if I can uninstall this? Of course I do not have anything to register with, as I have pirated the game itself. I hate the thought of redownloading the game, due to the lack of seeders compared to leechers. It would take days. Please someone help."
,JC-0589,2011-06-03T01:18Z,"Hello fellas... this question may sound dumb but I'm kinda lost.
After I followed steps kindly posted by svetkopetko5, I believe sucessfully patch to 1.1
After I went back to my saved game, I did found my last saved game but all my stuff saved on my inventory except the things I was wearing and the weapons... Is there any way I can get them back or am I screwed?  "
,smoketwojoints,2011-06-03T23:01Z,Actually about 1.1 I don't know how much they changed the graphics settings after all. I haven't read any more about it but I didn't notice much of a difference after testing it a bit. I still can't upgrade to 1.2 though.
,montanamb,2011-06-05T11:34Z,"@kct810: Try opening the patch as administrator.

@Drugoh: As CDProjekt mentioned, the game is DRM-free now. So just use random numbers to activate the game.

@JC-0589: If you deleted any dlc's(like the dlc pack of skidrow), this problem can happen. It was happened to me, too. Try re-installing the dlc's again.

@smoketwojoints: Actually patch 1.1 didn't make a huge FPS gain for me, instead the game is much more laggy now. FPS is still the same, but it's laggy. Especially in forests. I didn't tried patch 1.2 yet but when I do, I'll write again. :)"
,montanamb,2011-06-06T14:18Z,"If anyone having problems with installing patch 1.2:
You have to delete installed dlc's located at CookedPC (alchemy_suit,swordsman_suit,roche_jacket,troll,arena,magical_suit and merchant.dzip or .dlc). Patch will install them again. And I really recommend you updating to 1.2. It really improves the performance."
,ikschopk0nt,2011-06-09T02:07Z,"I wont recommand installing update 1.2. Cause my game auto-shutdowns after fight with kayran, after update 1.2. Don't know if update 1.2 causing it but i think so.."
,kakashinaruto,2011-06-12T12:51Z,"@ 9em

Ignore my previous comment. All works fine and I've updated the 'Black Box' version to 1.2 - problem arose because both Patcher_EFIGS and Patcher_1.1_International open the launcher after completing their work, which screws things up when you execute the next patch in the 'sequence'. Thanks montanamb for your guide! 


How did u install the patch 1.2? I managed to apply the patch 1.1 but when I try to patch 1.2, I've received and error ""invalid or incomplete"".. I need help....."
,jacekkaminski,2011-06-15T01:57Z,"Like whit the 1.1. I download patch 1.2 from original site. Install it.And again go to bin>and the game run like a charm:) or you can go to bin>and then configurator ,then you can set the many options there.from patch 1.1 you can use the arrows as movement keys. "
,jacekkaminski,2011-06-15T02:02Z,"Aha, I got that skidrow version....Got no problems whit patching 1.1 and 1.2, great work.
Game is nice But i gonna play this night part I, I'm still not finished, "
