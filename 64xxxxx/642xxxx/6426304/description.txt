The Masterplan is a collection of Oasis B-sides from singles covering their first three albums. The featured tracks and the track listing were decided from an online poll of Oasis fans in 1998. Don't expect this to be better than or the same as (What's the story) Morning Glory or Definitely Maybe, but it can compete with them: many songs are underestimated and great and well worth listining to.
