,snowbirds,2011-05-25T23:06Z,"All you ass-kissers slamming 7thsense are wrong.

Extreme zone lied on imagine's release and said it was out of sync when it wasn't.

Then he released the same exact R5 (maybe he tweaked the audio, I can't tell from listening to both samples) and is calling it a DVDRIP.

Here is the thing about Exremezone.  He uploads TONS of great movies.  He is awesome in that regard.  But he is also a pathological liar.  He lies on his own torrents and he goes onto other people's torrents and lies about theirs.  The Pirate Bay even took away his green skull at one point because of this.  He got a little better and they gave it back.

The bottom line with Extremezone is that he uploads lots of stuff, but you can't trust what he says.  Plus he acts really uncool to other uploaders by trying to steal their downloaders away to his own torrents.  In short, the guy is a dick.

All of you people who constantly praise him are sucking up to the wrong guy.

Extremezone, thanks for all the uploads, but seriously, go see a therapist man.  You need help.  You could be a living legend here on TPB, but instead half the users think your a dick.

peace out yallz"

,aafz02,2011-05-26T00:41Z,"I looked at this and saw... ""A=10 V=10""  written several times.

This release is NOT a DVDRip! It is a cam, full of artefacts with washed out colours, terrible white balance and the picure looks like a badly compressed jpeg image.

,L3fT4D34D,2011-05-26T02:04Z,"@snowbirds dude, you have 0 fucking uploads, before you make any complaints, why don't you contribute a little? 

Extremezone is the best/most reliable up-loader on the site.. 

Don't you notice how once he uploads a DvDr.. hundreds of other copy's come out right after.. He's always the first to upload the best quality, then everyone rips his and re uploads it. 

so fuck yourself. "

,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-26T02:10Z,"@aafz02. Whatever they've got you on bud, cut the dose. I downloaded the cam back in Feb and this certainly ain't a cam. Thanks extreme."
,deathwithafi,2011-05-26T02:51Z,u forgot to mention how u steal IMAGiNE's releases. or do u just use whatever u find first on a scene release site?
,Joeycobra,2011-05-26T03:15Z,"thanks dude, fuck the haters, shits free shut up"
,snowbirds,2011-05-26T03:45Z,"@extremezone, I just took a screenshot of Imagine's release [which you say is OOS -which is false] and compared the exact same frame with your release.  Guess what?  They are EXACTLY the same.  It is not a ""out of sync/pixelated/cams/telesyncs"" as you say.  Again, you are lying.  I've watched you for years extremezone, and I've watched you lie over and over and over to the Pirate Bay community.  I appreciate all your uploads, and you do upload good stuff, but you lie constantly, and I don't like that.  Basically, I know longer trust you at all.  I still DL some of your stuff, but if I have a choice, I go elsewhere.  I know I'm not the only one like this...  It's sad, dude.

And yes, aafz02 is right that there are pixelated artifacts in the dark parts of this upload, so the video quality is NOT a 10 for a dvd rip.  Why?  Because this IS NOT a dvd rip, it's an R5 that extremezone probably copied from imagine, reuploaded as his own, and then went and posted a lie on imagine's torrent to steal his downloaders.  I don't care how many movies extremezone uploads, this is fucking uncool.  You wanna flame me for saying this?  Sit on my dick.

Again, extremezone, you have a problem.  You lie constantly.  This is an indication of a personality disorder.  You have a lot of people here on TPB who support you, but you know that they're only ass-kissers and not true friends. Your relationships with the people close to you must suck because of your compulsive lying.  Seriously, you need to see a therapist.  You don't have to go through life this way.  You can have a better life than this.

To all you ass-kissers who flame anyone who speaks the truth, sorry but it's hard to understand what you're saying with extremezone's dick in your mouths."
,snowbirds,2011-05-26T03:47Z,"""For a compulsive liar, lying becomes second nature.

Not only do compulsive liars bend the truth about issues large and small, they take comfort in it. Lying feels right to a compulsive liar. Telling the truth, on the other hand, is difficult and uncomfortable.

And like any behavior which provides comfort and an escape from discomfort (i.e., alcohol, drugs, sex), lying can become addictive and hard to stop. For the compulsive liar, lying feels safe and this fuels the desire to lie even more.

Making matters even more complicated, compulsive lying is often a symptom of a much larger personality disorder, which only makes the problem more difficult to resolve (see, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder).

Unfortunately, compulsive lying is hard for the person involved to see, but it hurts those who are around it. Compulsive lying, if not addressed, can easily ruin a relationship (for example, see why does he need to lie).

Compulsive lying can be dealt with through counseling or therapy. But, like any addictive behavior (and/or personality disorder), getting someone to admit they have a problem with lying is the difficult part. Sadly enough, getting someone to recognize that he or she has a problem usually requires hitting rock bottom first."" "

The audio is a bit tripping in some frequences. Sounds like line audio, but not dvd audio. Don't know what went wrong there. However, perfectly watchable. The sound is NOT BAD, but also not as you'd expect from a dvd rip.

Kudos anyway, extremezone. Thanks for your upload."
,mage1111,2011-05-26T04:39Z,"@snowbirds - Wow, you're really touchy on torrent stealing considering you've never uploaded one yourself. Maybe just appreciate what they're giving us for free?

This is a fucking DVDrip, I just watched it, just like I watched all other extremezone releases.. 

I don't take a fucking magnifying glass up to it to look for pixels.

you have no life, stop ripping on extremezone when you haven't given ANYTHING to the community.

stop your crying, no one gives a flying fuck if there's a pixel in dark spots... I watched it with no concern about pixels..

Video is DVD quality but audio is quite poor. Listening on headphones I had to switch to mono as the stereo sound was uneven through the two channels (right channel is a bit muffled) - this may not be noticeable if you're not using headphones. On the plus side, audio is in sync and video has no watermarking.

Overall very watchable but if you're a stickler for quality wait for a proper DVDRip or BRRip."

Okay, it features Liam Neeson on the cover but that's about all you can say
about this film. Interesting theme for a movie but they totally failed to
make it work. It has as much credibility as a first grade theater play,
absolutely none.
Some people must have paid an awful lot of money to push this to a 7.1 score on
IMDb.

Nonetheless, thanks for the upload so I could check for myself what a big

That sounds like a problem not with the uploader or MAX team by any means but rather a problem from your DVD converter;burner. What do you use to burn and convert them?

If this was a 700MiB rip I'd say video was good. But for a 1.24GiB file, video is below standard. There are definitely problems with the audio: in VLC and in WDTV Live, voices frequently warble, which is distracting.

Despite these flaws the rip is perfectly watchable. If you're looking for sharp picture with perfect audio, consider paying for a disc.
