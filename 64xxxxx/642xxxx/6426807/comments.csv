Stop crying you little kid, for the last time everyone uploads with mp4 nowadays. If you cant use your little mind to download divX you are seriousley stupid."

Seriousley, you cry becouse of torrents are mp4 and not avi ? whats the fucking difference? you go download divX and you can watch mp4 if your little mind cant figure that out."

,KK94,2011-05-27T17:50Z,Thanks a lot 
,viiperxtreme,2011-05-28T22:06Z,yeah sure you can download divx no problem but i dont wanna watch it on my pc i wanna stream it to my ps3 i cant do that with mp4 so come on man you upload raw in avi so why not smackdown? doesnt make sence
[V],scene4all,2011-05-29T01:42Z,Why stream it to ur ps3 when u can copy it to ur usb and play it from ur usb on ur ps3? and FYI mp4 does work on ps3 atleast via usb.
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-05-29T12:57Z,"I can understand the annoyance with this being MP4 and not AVI (Although its not the fault of the uploader, it's just down to the RUDOS release)

I download Monday Night Raw and Friday Night Smackdown each week, and burn them for my mate who doesn't have SKY. There are always problems burning an MP4 and AVI together, even with ConvertX to DVD. Also MP4 files always tend to burn rather choppy in my opinion. 

I can't be bothered going through the process of converting the MP4 to an AVI, so I usually wait for the KYR release, which is an AVI file. This week that release is rather late, so I'll just have to keep waiting.

Again, no slating of the uploader, because the quality of this release is always tip-top, but it's just not the one I need! If you dont mind MP4 then grab this one. If you want an AVI, just wait for the KYR release :)"
