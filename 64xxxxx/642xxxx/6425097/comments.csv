My wife is deaf and most local theatres don't have rear-captioning, so you've been her lifeline to cinema since I found you.  I can get the subtitles from another site and encode your UL via Handbrake, but...

Anyway, you do amazing work - subtitles or not."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-30T00:54Z,"re-encoding is not necessary and is a horrible thing to do.  simple add the subs using subler, a 2 min job.

subs were not included because I do not have them, its as simple as that."
,lakanooki,2011-05-31T00:42Z,...and that's why you rock.  Thanks for the advice!
,theoneed,2011-06-02T23:48Z,"Hey HR
Great job mate! ur torrents simply the best!
One question been in my mind for some time:
How do u do it man?
could u explain it to us especially adding the subtitles to the film and have them as an option to disable and enable them?
and the ability to add the HD tags and ratings?
would be great to tell us ur secret and the tools u use :)
Thanks a million!"

,shoein,2011-06-11T22:20Z,got tagged by my isp as well. do not download this one.
,Halemane,2012-01-06T11:03Z,"Does this movie have English subtitles? I just want to make sure before downloading it.

I know the description says it doesn't but if anybody has downloaded this, can you confirm it for me?

I just can't understand the American and British accents and I have to have English subtitles while watching an American or British film. Or I won't understand what the hell the characters are saying to each other."
