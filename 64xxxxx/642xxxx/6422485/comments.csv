,bighimey,2011-06-04T17:41Z,"I too eagerly await a 720p / 5.1 rip of the 106min/theatrical release.  I saw it twice at the cinema and downloaded the first 720p rip of the longer version.  I will buy it when it comes out but, until then, if someone can release a 720/1080 of the original theatrical edition I would be very thankful.  Thanks for the upload MitZep."
