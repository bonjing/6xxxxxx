Review (amazon.com)
This disc works well as an introduction to all of the artists contained thereon, but it works even better as a cohesive listening experience in itself. This is more \"sound architecture\" than \"music\", the sounds are non-linear, three-dimensional, sometimes taking you on a journey to parts unknown, sometimes leaving you stationary but building a complete environment around you. Very highly recommended.
