Mary Chapin Carpenter (born February 21, 1958) is an American folk and country music artist. Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts.
Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Come On Come On, which yielded seven charting country singles and was certified quadruple platinum in the U.S. for sales exceeding four million copies. She followed it with Stones in the Road (1994) and A Place in the World (1996), which both featured hit singles. In the 2000s, Carpenter's albums departed both thematically and musically from her early work, becoming less radio-friendly and more focused on societal and political issues. Her most acclaimed and most topical album to date, The Calling, was released in March 2007. She followed that with The Age of Miracles in April 2010.
Carpenter has won five Grammy Awards, and is the only artist to have won four consecutive Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, which she received from 1992 to 1995. As of 2005, she had sold more than 12 million records. Carpenter has performed on television shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and Austin City Limits, radio shows such as The Diane Rehm Show and tours frequently, returning to Washington almost every summer to perform at the popular outdoor venue Wolftrap.

The Age of Miracles is the tenth studio album released by American music artist Mary Chapin Carpenter. The album was released on April 27, 2010 on ZoÃ« Records and was produced by Carpenter and Matt Rollings. The album is Carpenter's third album released under the ZoÃ« record label, and is also her first studio album since The Calling in 2007. The album peaked at no.6 on the Billboard Magazine Top Country Albums chart and no.28 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
The Age of Miracles consists of twelve tracks of new material, all of which were written solely by Mary Chapin Carpenter. She commented that the album's title track reflects on Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, while the album's seventh track (Mrs. Hemingway) is about the first wife of author Ernest Hemingway. She also mentioned that the fifth track 4 June 1989 explains the Tiananmen Square Massacre and its remembrance by Chinese activist Chen Gueng.
