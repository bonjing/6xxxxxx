theLEAK, a discography is the total released works of an artist, including possibly any bootlegs that may be available.  A good idea is to look up the artist's website to see what's available."
[T],brycetheman1,2011-08-15T08:08Z,"Is this guy kidding? The greatest hits is closer to a ""Complete discography"" than this. But seriously dude, you're missing 7 albums and then all the little b-sides and singles they released for this to be classified as a complete discography. Hell you should even include the side projects, such as: Box Car Racer, +44, and even Angels and Airwaves."
