,FNX666,2011-07-24T06:24Z,"This works a treat, but double-click the bat files. I first tried Right-Click|Run As Administrator and then Right-Click|Open and neither worked.

Repeat: Double-click the bat files and it works a treat.

THANK YOU *GEVD*. I never expected to see this in a torrent. 

PS Any chance of the latest patch (currently 1.04.36)?"

,treices,2012-03-25T19:36Z,Make your own personal serial number? That's hogwash and doesn't work. The .bat file is even more hogwash since it collapses on itself the moment I double click it.
