So, little story.  I decided I wanted to not read, but listen to this book.  So I purchased it on a (unnamed website) thinking I could download it in MP3 format and listen to it on my car or PC..etc

Well I quickly found out that was bullshit impossible.  Mostly due to them saying "If we give it to you in MP3 you'll just pirate it away" and told me I could listen to it on fucking MACs, iPods, iPads, iPhones, a limited amount of smartphones, and bullshit that wont let me listen to the fucking things I BOUGHT in my car when I'm driving 4 hours a day.  And they said if I wanted to burn it, I could burn it ONCE using iTunes, which I say FUCK THAT!

So I just hit play using their bullshit software on my netbook, and had a headphone jack looped to the microphone and recorded it using Audacity.  So FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING PRICKS!  NOW IT'S IN MP3 FORMAT BECAUSE YOU'RE ASSHOLES!  Here's a free book, because some companies can fuck off.
