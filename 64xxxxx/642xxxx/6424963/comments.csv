,yourbay,2011-05-27T04:30Z,"Hi Malikjee..thanks for your great uploads..they are really amazing and I guess you are the Google of all hindi rare movie fans and can get all of them...
I have been looking for some movies since ages and here they are : 1) Parinati (Telefilm) 2) Libaas (Gulzar saab's, Shabana ji starrer) 3) Gaman 4) Gharonda 5) Punjabi Gul Baloch (1944, Rafi saab sang his first song for this movie) 6) Hum Log TV Serial 7)Bharat Ek Khoj (all episodes in one file) 8) Shriman Shrimati Hindi comedy serial all episodes.
9) Shankar Hussain (Kanwaljeet)

I know the list is long but am sure you only can fulfill this.. 

We can get Hindi dubs for hollywood movies but do we have any hindi dubs for bengali classics like Pather Panchali etc.Any thoughts..Thanks so much...
