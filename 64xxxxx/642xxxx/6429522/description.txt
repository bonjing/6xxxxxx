Ghost is the upcoming thirteenth studio album by Canadian musician Devin Townsend, and the final of four planned albums in The Devin Townsend Project series. It will be released on June 20, 2011. Townsend has stated that the album "is the mellowest (by far) and prettiest record I've done so far."

The song "Drench," a leftover slated to appear on a second volume of Ghost, was shared by Townsend on his official SoundCloud account. Later, Mackie Gear posted the leftover track "Fall" through the same channel.
