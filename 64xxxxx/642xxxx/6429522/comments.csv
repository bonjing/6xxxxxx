Anyway, over 20 days in advance, but looks like the real thing. Thanks!"

He recently put a lot of his stuff on ebay to finance the next Ziltoid-album, if that's not an incentive for you to buy his stuff I don't know what is.
Oh also, he is his own publisher so the money definitively goes to him.

So if you like the music from this genius, buy it. Because he's not that well-known to be wealthy. This guy lives for his music. Hail to Ziltoid!"
