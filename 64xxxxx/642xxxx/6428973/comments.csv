,Adamzz,2011-05-28T11:34Z,"Also, it works just fine."
,endemoniada,2011-05-28T17:52Z,Does this game require Java or another framework installed ?
,BaggerX,2011-05-28T19:44Z,"Doesn't seem to work.  Tutorials run fine, but campaign and instant action modes just hang at the loading screen.

They really need a demo for this game.  I want to get the version that comes with soundtrack, but I want to try it out first on my system."
