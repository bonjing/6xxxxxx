It still has some protection in place that make editing with DVD-Remake impossible.

AnyDVD LOG:

Video DVD (or CD) label: THE_DA_VINCI_CODE
Media is not CSS protected.
Media is region free.
Video Standard: PAL

Using local database!
Found & removed structural copy protection!
Found & removed bogus title set(s)!
RCE protection not found.
UDF filesystem patched!
Autorun not found on Video DVD.
Found & removed 8 potential bad sector protections!

Might be a good idea to remove all the protection before burning... other than that, its a good quality DVDR with a good bitrate :-)"

,d-animator,2012-04-17T15:05Z,"I was unable to use the subs included with this file without having english subs on for the english speaking parts as well, meaning I would have to turn on the subs every time a foreign language was spoken or have them on all the time which is incredibly annoying. Here's a link to subs for non-english parts only http://subscene.com/english/the-da-vinci-code/subtitle-116671.aspx which can be used easily enough if your watching on your pc i.e enabling them in vlc but if you're wanting to watch it in a dvd player then you can hardcode them into vob files very easily using ConvertXtoDVD. Hope this helps. Thanks for the upload btw, worthy of your skull."
