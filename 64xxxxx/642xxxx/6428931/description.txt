FFCoder 1.1.0.5 Portable


FFCoder is a .NET based audio/video converter, which is capable of transcoding audio and video files to various formats. It is a unified frontend for many freeware utilities such as FFmpeg, MPlayer and MEncoder.

Features:
Supports 16 encoders - ffmpeg, mencoder, ffmpeg2theora, x264, xvid_encraw, avs2avi, lame, faac, NeroAAC, OggEnc, FLAC, OptimFROG, Speex, MusePack and WavPack.
Batch processing.
Parallel processing (multiple files can be transcoded at same time).
Advanced configuration options for all codecs.
Supports 2-pass encoding with automated first pass.
Encode video using vfw codecs such as VP6, VP7 and FFDShow (by using avs2avi).
MeGUI presets can be imported for x264 and xvid encoding.
Support for video filters provided by the encoder (such as mencoder's filters)
Input files can be avisynth scripts or any format supported by ffmpeg.
For encoders such as x264_cli which support very few input formats, the video is decoded with ffmpeg and then piped to the encoder.
Tools: Dump audio/video stream to file, create images in JPEG/BMP/PNG/TIFF format, rebuild/cut/join video files, quant matrix editor, etc.

Changes since v0.99
WebM encoding via FFmpeg
Target size encoding mode. It is available for all video codecs that supports 2pass encoding.
Directory watch for fully automated encoding. In this mode the program will monitor a set of pre-defined folders for files matching a filename pattern. Files will be automatically picked-up and encoded with pre-defined settings. The encoding will be done in the background with low-priority so that the user can continue with other tasks.
x264: Options updated, Fixed issues with 2pass encoding, Menu for x264's in-built presets
Avisynth: New and improved avisynth options
Avisynth: New editor with syntax highlighting, code folding, GScript support
Avisynth: Options for testing and comparing avisynth scripts
Better support for subtitles, SRT files can be embedded into MKV files using MKVMerge
Progress window: Improved layout
Progress window: New option for minimizing FFCoder to the system tray. FFCoder will run in a low-priority mode so that the user can continue doing other tasks while the files are being converted. User will be notified when the jobs are complete.
Progress window: Progress % will be displayed while encoding audio from AVS input files (it was not displayed in previous version)
Progress window: More info will be displayed while encoding
Audio/Video filters: Presets, options for no-upscaling and fit-to-box
Audio/Video filters: Warnings will be displayed if the codec supports limited frame sizes or frame rates
Turn off visual styles for the FFCoder gui
Tested on 32-bit versions of XP, Vista and Win7

Changes since v 1.1.0.3
[New]
Jobs can be added while the encoding is going on, by dragging and dropping files on the progress window
New option for reporting errors. Right-click on the failed file and select 'Create Error Report'
DVD VOBs can be encoded using the "Add DVD" option in the 'File' menu. This option requires avisynth.
Added options to the tools menu for configuring FFDShow

[Changes]
Added H261, H263, H263p codecs to 3GP and 3G2 file formats
Added MJPEG codec to MOV file format
Added AMR codec to 3GP and 3G2 file formats

[Fixes]
FFmpeg: Encoding fails if the Aspect option is set in the video filters window
Mencoder: If input file has fractional fps then output fps must be explicitly set, otherwise the encoding will fail. The output fps will be set automatically in order to avoid this issue.
Track order was incorrectly detected in some VOB files causing the encoding to fail.
The temp folder was always deleted on application exit irrespective of whether the 'DeleteFiles' option was checked on the options window.
The NoUpscaling checkbox on the video filters windows was disabled for some presets, and displayed incorrect tooltip messages in some cases
The following presets were selecting the wrong audio/video codecs
