Plot
Gulloo (I. S. Johar) is a simpleton loved in this world only by his faithful dog, "Charlie", and by his doting mother. Gulloo has a passion for everything British, so he goes about sporting a checked suit and bow-tie and will not accept any favour unless he says "thank you". Gulloo lives in his own mental paradise, until one day his dog "Charlie" meets a charming, velvet-haired beauty of an English lady-dog Jackie. And from then on, things take a dramatic turn in the simple life of Gulloo. Jackie is life and joy of a wealthy Rai Bahadurs daughter called Bambie (Geeta Balli). Jackie wont eat, nor drink, nor smile, nor play unless she has Charlie for company. Bambie is aghast when she learns this fact, for she has seen both. Charlie and his master, Gulloo, and detests the sight of both. Eventually she gives in and Jackie and Gulloo shift to Bambies house.
