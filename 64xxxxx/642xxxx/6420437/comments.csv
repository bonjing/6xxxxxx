Was ep 22 the final ep in the season?? so if anyone here wants to confirm that yes im a moron and that there is no ep 23 coming out it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks. 

... oh yeah, THANK YOU VTV!! between VTV and eztv ive DLed both seasons, in exceptional quality. THANKS AGAIN! XO"
,evilarhan,2011-06-30T00:58Z,"@Kikee_31: No, there's only 22 episodes in this season. Most shows follow the 22 episode format. You can usually check the episode details on most shows on wikipedia.

Cheers!"
