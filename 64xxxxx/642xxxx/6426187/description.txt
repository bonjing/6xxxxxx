last year i suffered a filesystem crash which deprived me, among others, of the version of this movie corresponding to 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4841402/Sansho_The_Bailiff_aka_SanshA_A__dayA_A_
i've tried to re-download it since, but no luck!
i know there are at least two other pals trying to download the latter torrent, but it seems there is no real seeder.
i guess the version i'm uploading is the same (compared the files size), but i haven't been able to merge the two versions into the polifem2009 torrent (sigh...).

enjoy and forgive my poor seeding bandwidth!

btw: other things i lost and am trying to re-download:
1-- the eel (corresponding to  
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5368367/Unagi_aka_The_Eel)

2-- arashi ga oka (corresponding to  
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5176375/Arashi_ga_oka_aka_Wuthering_Heights)

can anybody help?
