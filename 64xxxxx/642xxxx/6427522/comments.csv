,STEC0,2011-05-31T14:37Z,It's not 1080p :(
,Beatrice5,2011-05-31T15:34Z,@STEC0 See the aspect ratio 2.40 That means the the TRUE HD is 1080x800 not 1080. Why would you want to encode the black bars top and bottom.
,JoJoV,2011-06-02T23:52Z,"The resolution is 1920x800. The aspect ratio is 2.40:1, so this is a fullHD movie (1080P). NLUPPER002 keep up the good work! It's great to have a dutch uploader who brings us this great movies, with exellent quality!

Oftwel, ga zo door NLUPPER! Hoop nog veel van je te mogen downloaden (en seeden natuurlijk). Geweldig werk."
