A decade has passed since John Connor (Nick Stahl) helped prevent price Jui-Final and thus save mankind from mass destruction. Now, at 25, Connor lives "off game": no home, no credit cards, mobile phone and no job. There is no evidence of their existence. There is no way he can be traced by Skynet, the highly developed network of machines that once tried to kill him and wage war to the world. Until, out of the shadows of the future, the TX (Kristanna Loken), a killing machine, the cyborg murderer Skynet's most sophisticated to date. Sent back through time by his predecessor to complete unfinished work, this machine is as relentless as beautiful. Now the only hope of survival for Connor's Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger-Zeneggen). Together they must triumph over the technologically superior TX and forestall the threat of the Final Judgement in sight ... or face the apocalypse and the fall of civilization as we know it.
