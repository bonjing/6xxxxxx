After a long and heartbreaking journey to Dimitriâ€™s birthplace in Siberia, Rose Hathaway has finally returned to St. Vladimirâ€™sâ€”and to her best friend, Lissa Dragomir. It's graduation, and the girls canâ€™t wait for their real lives outside of the Academyâ€™s cold iron gates to finally begin. But even with the intrigue and excitement of court life looming, Roseâ€™s heart still aches for Dimitri. He's out there, somewhere.

She failed to kill him when she had the chance, and now her worst fears are about to come true. Dimitri has tasted her blood, and she knows in her heart that he is hunting her. And if Rose won't join him, he won't rest until he's silenced her...forever.

But Rose can't forget what she learned on her journeyâ€”whispers of a magic too impossible and terrifying to comprehend. A magic inextricably tied to Lissa that could hold the answer to all of Rose's prayers, but not without devastating consequences. Now Rose will have to decide whatâ€”and whoâ€”matters most to her. In the end, is true love really worth the price?
