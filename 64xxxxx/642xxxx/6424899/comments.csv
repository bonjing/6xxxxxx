To get Tenshi, Iku, Suika, Reisen, Remilia, Sakuya, Yuyuko, Youmu, Yukari, Komachi, and Aya you first need SWR installed on it's own. Open up configex123 in your th123 directory and look for a line saying th105path. Change the path you see to your SWR directory and then execute th123.exe. Go to Vs Com to confirm that the rest of the cast have indeed been unlocked.

This only unlocks the CHARACTERS, the decks and other unlocks will not carry over, but you don't need to do anything to get the characters themselves, just reference SWR properly.

However, by placing both games in the same folder, upon first running th123, cards from SWR will be imported. If you have already begun playing, you can delete your score123.dat file, which will erase all cards you have unlocked in th123.
