[V],extremezone,2011-05-25T07:11Z,thanks SAFCukO09 but it's r5 line mislabeled dvdrip-check sample first as always
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-25T07:24Z,"Before anyone states this is an r5 not a dvdrip ...Wrong 

This is a retail russian dvdrip that comes with english studio audio.A retail russian dvdrip is different to an r5 ......A dvdrip with english studio audio is a dvdrip"
[T],artpepper,2011-05-25T08:33Z,"Checked out the sample and the audio is in sync and sounds like studio audio not line. Video is DVD quality, so, thumbs-up and thanks @SAFCuk009..."
,g0dsize,2011-05-25T08:34Z,"No, an R5 rip with english studio audio is still just an R5 rip with english studio audio.  These are from two different sources, therefore not a DVDRIP.

An R1 rip with the english DVD audio would be a DVDRIP.

Thanks anyway, I'll wait for the real thing -- one that's properly labelled and in sync."
,heavydiamond,2011-05-25T09:23Z,"i say potatoes u say ,ha ha it's just a film as long as it's in sync ,doesnt hiss ,background noise ,its fine untill R1 rip ,R5 is a rip in this case with studio audio sourced n added after "
,7thSense,2011-05-25T14:35Z,"extremezone quit with the envy just because they got the dvdrip out first, you're always a bitter follower"
[V],SAFCukO09,2011-05-25T16:53Z,Its not an R5 ...an R5 is not a real russian dvdrip this is a true russian dvdrip withe the english studio audio making it dvdrip
