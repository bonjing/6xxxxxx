Is this torrent bullshit?... And if not is the action scenes all loud and shit while the verbal parts are quiet as fuck just like most early BRrips?? Lots of these movies need to be mixed right so we all dont bolow our speakers or go deaf....

I agree that really pisses me off to no end to have to adjust the volume all the time....not only on blue ray but everywhere...even on tv....speach is quiet then an action sequence comes up and we get our fukkin ears blown off.....Hollywood is slacking on the production aspect."

I agree..im tired of adjusting my sound all the time."
,redox1,2011-06-21T12:15Z,"This is an excellent movie. I don't understand why it had such bad reviews. It twists the standard hollywood cliches around more than anything I've seen in a long time. That probably uspets the simpletons who only understand and expected one of the 3 standard plots that constitute your average hollywood movie.

If you have a brain, ignore the moronic criticiism and enjoy."
