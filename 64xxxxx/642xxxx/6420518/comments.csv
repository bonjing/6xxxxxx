,funky_ace,2011-06-09T17:22Z,"If this is the Hindi version then movie sux cause it has been heavily censored to the age level of 5yrs while Shin Chan belongs to above 14 category at least. Watching such a thing is pain in the ass cause most of the jokes have been censored such that they sound kiddy now. Even Shin Chan flirting with adult girls has been removed. No nudity, no flirting and no adult stuff, this movie is a disaster. Most adult scenes have been removed so most of the time you would think why did his mother got angry on him.
Moral of the story: Screw you censor board. Why did you have to put restriction on such stuff you can't handle. If you are that much of great editor then why don't you put Family Guy on Hungama?"
