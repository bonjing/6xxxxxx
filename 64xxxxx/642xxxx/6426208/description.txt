Description
Master instrumentalist, producer and songwriter Gurf Morlix has been a major thread in the fabric of American roots music for over 20 years. But, before he became a recognized name on the scene for his work with such folks as Lucinda, Ray Wylie Hubbard, Slaid Cleaves, Buddy and Julie Miller, and Mary Gauthier, Gurf hung, played and performed with the Austin-based songwriter Blaze Foley. On February 1, 2011, Gurf is releasing a 15 song collection of Blaze's songs, called Blaze Foley's 113th Wet Dream. The cd will be released in conjunction with the documentary, Blaze Foley: Duct Tape Messiah, which has been 12 years in the making. Following the release, Gurf will be touring throughout North America together with the documentary screenings. Gurf, a native of Buffalo, NY, struck out for warmer climes as soon as he could and one of the first folks he met when he arrived in Austin in was Blaze Foley. In 1976, Blaze came to one of Gurf's shows, introduced himself, and invited Gurf to his first Austin gig. They hit it off and for the next few years, the two iconoclasts were runnin' buddies. A few years ago, Gurf wrote: Blaze Foley soulful, passionate singer songwriter. Champion of the downtrodden. Friend of the working Girl. Truth seeker. Atmospheric disturbance. Tender caring person with a big ol' bag of deep-rooted troubles stuffed down into one of his pockets. Blaze could cut right through the bull***t, or he could be the cause of it. The funniest person I ever met, and also the most tragic . Blaze, a colorful, but flawed character, was murdered in 1989 at the age of 39. Recording an album of Blaze's music is something Gurf's been wanting to do for more than 20 years. Now is the time. Gurf knows that Blaze's honest, heartfelt words will resonate with today's audience. Blaze is finally having the career he wanted.
