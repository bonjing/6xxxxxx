 After returning from a holiday to Dubai, Peter takes his family on an alpine 
 adventure to Courcheval in France. Back in the UK, he test-drives a new Ferrari 
 supercar and decides to treat himself to a belated birthday present. He also 
 attends a television awards ceremony, at which he is nominated for Satellite 
 TV Personality of the Year, and pays a visit to his friend Kerry Katona's house
