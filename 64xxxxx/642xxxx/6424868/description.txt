This is most definitely one of the best philosophy introduction/documentary series ever made. I'm sorry professors, but this is too beneficial to not share with the world. This documentary series is often used in further and higher education in the humanities department. It is good for anyone, but especially for philosophy students. Please spread this knowledge/wisdom to everyone in the world. My only self-interest in all of this is to see a better world. - Anonymous
