,aazablue,2011-06-10T22:40Z,"Hello,

I tried this dl, but when i render, i get the red x with the watermark on it.  do you know why thats so?

thanks"
,BozzaBow,2011-06-14T18:14Z,"aazablue - You have installed it as a demo, you will need to reinstall, and make sure, when putting the reg key in that you press the right button, which says install pro GUI version. Kreasj - Ill have a go soon, i am very busy atm, but i will try and get round to it soon :)"
,heyashuhi,2011-06-17T17:24Z,there is a watermark.
,Ilias89,2011-06-19T00:26Z,There is a watermark and I installed it correctly twice.
,xhermie,2011-06-20T15:20Z,"I've downloaded this before, and I've pressed the right button that says ""Install Pro GUI Version"", but I still get watermark"
,TonyMia,2011-07-28T17:16Z,I too installed this right multiple times and still get a big red X has anyone found a way to fix this... how about you support the torrents you put up instead of just saying were doing it wrong and disappearing
,rikardpah,2011-09-07T10:39Z,"yeah...same here, red cross and done everything alright... think they have banned this serial, but Im using little snitch, dont get it..."
,chronolgc,2011-09-07T15:03Z,"Same problem for me. Would really love to find a solution for Twixtor in AE/Premiere CS 5.5! If anyone has any idea, please let us know."

,3rd.1,2011-10-06T18:19Z,"Hi guys,

I see no button with ""Install Pro GUI Version""

HereÂ´s whar i get: imageshack.us/photo/my-images/401/screencapture7.png/

AND after i type in the username + serial the only button i have the possibility to click is the ""install demo or floating liscence version""

Did i miss smth?

Thx :)"
,3rd.1,2011-10-06T18:20Z,"-> i also tried the hint of adeloon, but didnÂ´t work for me ;("
,3rd.1,2011-10-06T18:25Z,I got it! I had to install it via the content file! Thx BazzaBow
,1ricca,2011-10-18T03:06Z,"awesome dude, thanks! Any chance you can get v5 or later for FCP? been dying for it and all I can get is 4.5.x"
,ermetekos,2011-12-20T15:17Z,Use AE CS5 not CS5.5 and it will work!!!
,muzza111111,2012-01-28T10:34Z,"Hey, i have the same problem as 3rd.1. How exactly do you install via the content file?? Please help!!!"
,bobby2579,2012-02-29T05:37Z,"Hey once you install it, how do you use it on After effects, because im using the CS5 suite and twixtor does not appear at the effects tab :/"
,bobby2579,2012-02-29T06:03Z,shit lol I finally got it thanks a lot man!
,atvrider647,2012-03-14T21:29Z,"So did anyone ever get it?

I'm using CS5 and I want to know what the current trick is."
,hpspec,2012-05-03T23:23Z,"Use Adeloon's trick. Uninstall Twixtor and then reinstall if all else fails. Confirmed working May 3 2012. Thanks to poster, thanks to the fucking genius Aldeloon!"
,clktr,2012-06-14T22:35Z,"I did the same that Sir. Adeloon said, the SERIAL FIRST then type 'The Blad' WITHOUT 'e' and IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!"
