I've had this problem with other games and then downloaded the latest PhysX drivers and that updated the DLL files for the game to run. Also, make sure the codecs on your PC are not clashing, I use K-lite mega pack, but alot of people tick everything on install which can cause clashes because 2 different programs are trying to render the same thing at the same time. To find out if that's the problem, just un-install your codec pack then run the game. Hope this helps."
