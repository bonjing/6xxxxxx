Due to time restrictions, the Japanese broadcast of SASUKE 26 cut many of the Americans and digested many Japanese competitors. Also, the G4 broadcast showed the Americans and Japanese separate. To make the most of the broadcasts, I compiled all of the footage I could find from this one tournament and put it together IN ORDER of where they ran on that day. 

The footage follows the SASUKEpedia guideline:

The broadcast is just under 3 hours and is pretty large (5.45 GB) so please seed this when you are done. It is mostly in HD except for the American runs which are lower quality.

Thank you and I hope you like it!
