,nor50,2011-05-27T17:37Z,"I have downloaded some of your torrents, but all of them must have been bootlegs. I would like if you stated if it's bootlegs or official torrents you're posting!"
[V],jeroep,2011-05-27T19:22Z,"@nor50:85% of my torrents are bootlegs, about 15% are official releases"
[V],jeroep,2011-05-27T19:48Z,"@nor50: you can check on this site: http://www.elvisoncd.com/
if its bootleg or official!"
,nor50,2011-05-27T19:55Z,"OK, then why not state if it's NOT bootleg...? I ""hate"" bootlegs (poor sound)"
