Translation: ""I seriously need to get laid, guys."""
[T],rjordan21,2011-05-30T19:49Z,"There is a very slight improvement in low frequency extension with this version..... and that's listening to $15K USD worth of equipment and speakers that go down to 32khz.  In a car, through a computer, etc. you'd be hard pressed to hear a difference at all.

Kudos for the effort but the end result is negligible. "
