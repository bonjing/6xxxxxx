Lady Gaga
"Monster (Audiophile Uncensored Edit)"


WHAT IS IT?


CLUELESS AND TL;DR VERSION:
This is probably the most true-sounding (best) version of "Monster" you will ever find.

BASIC VERSION:
Utilizing both the censored and uncensored versions of the song as well as careful sound editing, this version of "Monster" corrects the sonic failures of the retail uncensored version of the track.

INTERMEDIATE VERSION:
It's apparent the retail uncensored version of "Monster" was put together on top of the already mixed and mastered censored version. So the uncensored version is essentially the censored version, but three parts of the track are replaced: the audio of and around the two instances of "fucked" as well as the insertion of an intentional click noise. These replacement parts are all phase inverted in the retail version.

In this edit, the censored version of the song was also used as a base. Smaller sections of the aforementioned replacement parts taken from the uncensored version (with the exception of the part with an intentional click noise), phase inverted to their intended state, were then placed into the censored version of the song to create an uncensored version of the song without the intentional click noise and the phase inversion of the retail version.
