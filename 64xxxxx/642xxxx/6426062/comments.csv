,usa3004,2011-07-09T00:18Z,may i ask what ISO is? like whats the difference between ISO and rar? didnt you already put up the seasons?
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-07-31T02:01Z,"The .iso is the actual rip from the DVD, the previous uploads are mp4 videos. I combined the vids myself from seasons 4-8, seasons 1-3 were from a friend. The only difference between the ones up now, and the one's I am uploading, are that it doesn't include bonus features, PSA's, chapter selection, etc. Although the quality is better on the .iso's. So that is why I am uploading them. You need a blank dvd in order to watch these."
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-07-31T02:02Z,"You only need a blank dvd for the .iso format, the other ones, you can watch straight from your pc"
,TrueMagnum,2011-08-01T03:12Z,"So the iso's will have the bonus features, PSA's, chapter selection, etc. correct?"
,usa3004,2011-08-05T01:22Z,Ohh. Thank you for clearing that up for me..but what I do is put the movies i download onto a 320GB portable hardrive and watch them on my ps3..i have seasins 1-5 dvdrip and id much appreciate if you could do that to? If you want..its your time.
,Ferrariaftrdark,2011-08-31T22:24Z,"Yes, the .iso format will have all the extras you would have when you actually were using the real dvd. Because this is a dvd rip."
