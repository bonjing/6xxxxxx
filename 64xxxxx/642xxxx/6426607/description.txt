pro Fit is a Macintosh (Mac OS) application for
data/function analysis, plotting, and curve fitting. It is
used by scientists and engineers to analyze their
measurements and the mathematical models they use to
describe them.

Scientists or students can define any mathematical function
and use it to model their data, finding by linear or
nonlinear curve fitting the function parameters that best
describe their observations. Moreover, they can use a
number of tools for the mathematical and statistical
analysis of functions and data sets, and they can produce
esthetically pleasing graphical representations for their
scientific reports.
