"My primary objective in this DVD was to communicate to riders that there is a definite technology to riding. The bike wasnâ€™t designed by opinions or good advice and riding is the same, there are technical points that need to be understood. Thatâ€™s the message and focus of this film. Once a rider gets the idea there is a technology then and only then can he conquer his fears and uncertainties on cornering and at that point improvement is virtually unlimited".
