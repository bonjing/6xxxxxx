City of Fallen Angels (Mortal Instruments 4) - Cassandra Clare-viny

City of Fallen Angels takes place two months after the events of City of Glass. In it, a mysterious someoneâ€™s killing the Shadowhunters who used to be in Valentineâ€™s Circle and displaying their bodies around New York City in a manner designed to provoke hostility between Downworlders and Shadowhunters, leaving tensions running high in the city and disrupting Claryâ€™s plan to lead as normal a life as she can â€” training to be a Shadowhunter, and pursuing her relationship with Jace. As Jace and Clary delve into the issue of the murdered Shadowhunters, they discover a mystery that has deeply personal consequences for them â€” consequences that may strengthen their relationship, or rip it apart forever.

Meanwhile, internecine warfare among vampires is tearing the Downworld community apart, and only Simon â€” the Daylighter who everyone wants on their side â€” can decide the outcome; too bad he wants nothing to do with Downworld politics. Love, blood, betrayal and revenge: the stakes are higher than ever in City of Fallen Angels
