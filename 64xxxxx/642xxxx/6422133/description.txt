                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Documentary using surveillance footage obtained as part of a sting conducted  
 by Illinois' Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to reveal the
 inner workings of a drug den. The film provides an insight into operations    
 under dealer Darrell `Duck' Davis, who took over Rockford's narcotics trade in
 2001, and recruited men from the South Side of Chicago to help him sell an    
 average of a kilo of hard drugs each week 
                                    
                                 Enjoy!
