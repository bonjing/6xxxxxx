,LanOnly,2012-05-04T10:00Z,"I know this is pretty stupid to ask but in what order do I install by? Everything in the root folders first? And then the patches or vice versa? When I start the game, after the vides, the game automatically closes. I ran it in compatibility mode as well as running it as admin."
