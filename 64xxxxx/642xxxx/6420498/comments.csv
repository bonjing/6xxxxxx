,Bgdwtf,2011-05-25T11:44Z,"This torrent shows 607 seeders, but real seeders are just 4 now? 

WHY he shows wrong fckng seeders?"
,whokilledbambi,2011-05-25T14:04Z,"@Bgdwtf:
They only shows seeders from TPB. The rest most likely are from other sites that are linking to this torrent. 
BY now it should be more seeder from here though..."

thanks TvTeam but it's r5 LINE audio , from sample out of sync , better wait for a real dvdrip "
,swimtwo,2011-05-25T21:13Z,total bullshit from extremezone - whoever the fuck he is - sample is perfect.
,ceebeenor,2011-05-25T21:23Z,This torrent is a leechers paradise..
,snowbirds,2011-05-25T22:58Z,"Extremezone is lying (again).  There is no out of sync issues with the sample.  The reason he's lying is:
a) He is a notorious liar, and has had his green skull taken away by Piratesbay for it.

b) he has uploaded the same basic copy as this one and he wants everyone to DL his torrent."

looking for a tv show from hbo too big to fail can someone help"
,Kooblukhan,2011-05-26T01:17Z,"tvteam you rock.  i dont usually gush over uppers but you always up my shows first, and you always give an honest and forthcoming description.

remember when everyone hated on axxo for giving low quality rips with poor compression when a one gig file could get you hdlite?

well now extremezone does the same thing except is also a spammy lying troll.  i mean he used to list EVERY SINGLE MOVIE hed upped in the description of his stuff.  If completely screwing the search engine on tpb just to get enough downloaders to be known doesnt make him a jackass, i dont know what does."
,lagia8a8,2011-05-26T01:26Z,"love you man ima stay seeding for 2 days for ya i know i can only

,bi_polar,2011-05-27T05:21Z,"I hate all of you morons who say shit like ""this is a leechers paradise"" or ""fucking leechers""

You realize by downloading the torrent, you become one of those leechers right? 

Everyone is a leecher until the file is on their system, ""leecher"" is just another term for ""people downloading the torrent""

For all of you that are new to the torrent game, do yourself a favor and don't post comments unless you know what you're talking about."

,theone25,2011-05-27T21:08Z,Just checked the sample.. audio is NOT out of sync. Downloading.
,StanlyManly,2011-05-28T09:27Z,"This movie was actually surprisingly good.  There are a few plotholes, but nothing major.  I was very pleased with the audio and video.  The quality is that of all the other movies I've downloaded here.  I had absolutely no problems with the video or audio, and it all was very much in sync.  The audio was perhaps a tad on the low side, but no big deal since I just turned it up a little.  It also worked flawlessly on my PS3.


Thank you, TvTeam for the great upload.
