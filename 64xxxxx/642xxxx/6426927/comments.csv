,rippervanwinkle,2011-06-28T13:07Z,"This HDTV rip is OK but be aware that the broadcast is the identical video stream found on the retail DVD, only upscaled.  There is also excessive denoising, perhaps by the broadcaster or the ripper, maybe even both.  If you want the best quality then the retail DVD is still better than this HDTV broadcast/rip.  There is another HDTV rip, 1080, but again the broadcast video is simply the DVD stream upscaled and is no better than the retail DVD.  

Here are a couple of uncompressed screenshots to illustrate the point:

You'll also notice a minor difference in aspect ratio.

The audio:  This movie was shot with a mono soundtrack and released to theatre with AC3 mono soundtrack.  The DVD has a mono soundtrack.  Somehow the broadcaster or ripper has conjured up a multichannel AAC soundtrack.

This HDTV rip will suit people who like heavily denoised video and it does seem to be popular and is kind of a Gopo release signature.  It's also very much better than the various xvid/divx rips out there.  But if you want to watch this movie in the best possible image and audio quality then buy the retail DVD or download it http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4039002/1984_%28Nineteen_Eighty-Four%29_DVD9%29"
