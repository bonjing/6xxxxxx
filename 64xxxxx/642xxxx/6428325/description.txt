On October 14 1988, actor Mike Farrell hosted "UFO Cover-Up?: Live!" a two-hour prime-time syndicated television special that was broadcast in the United States (and elsewhere). William Moore and Jamie Shandera appeared (among many other guests) and discussed the acquisition of the Majestic 12 documents, and introduced their sources "Falcon" and "Condor", allegedly high-level government intelligence officials. Interviewed in shadow and with masked voices, Falcon and Condor disclosed information about the U.S. governmentâ€™s involvement in UFOâ€™s and alien interaction, UFO crashes and occupant retrievals, and alien biology. This broadcast also included the first known mention of Area 51 on television.
