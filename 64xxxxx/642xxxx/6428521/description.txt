1 | The Poisoned Chalice | Neil Jordan | April 3, 2011 |

After the death of Pope Innocent VIII, Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, with the help of his sons, bribes and cajoles other cardinals to vote for him in the conclave to elect the new pontiff. He succeeds, and assumes the papal throne as Alexander VI. Two other ambitious cardinals, Orsini and Della Rovere, immediately begin plotting against him. When Orsini hosts a dinner for the pope and the cardinals, Rodrigo's son Cesare catches a servant, Micheletto, in the kitchen preparing to poison the Borgias' wine. Offering the assassin better pay if he works for his family, Cesare has Orsini poisoned instead.

2 | The Assassin | Neil Jordan | April 3, 2011 |

Cesare enlists Micheletto to spy on Cardinal della Rovere, who seeks to find a legal way to depose Rodrigo as pope. He is advised by scholar Johannes Burchard that a pope who engages in "public and notorious lechery" could be deposed. Rodrigo begins an affair with Giulia Farnese, provoking the outrage of his former mistress, Vanozza, and threatening to provide della Rovere with just the evidence he needs. On Micheletto's information, the pope corners Burchard and demands his support in expanding the College of Cardinals to shore up his position. Cesare sets Micheletto to work preventing della Rovere and a witness from presenting evidence against the pope.

3 | The Moor | Simon Cellan-Jones | April 10, 2011 |

Cem, brother and potential threat to the new Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, arrives at Rome. The Sultan is paying the Holy See handsomely to keep Cem there as a "guest", but he will pay a lot more if Cem somehow dies. Cesare declines his brothers request of using Michelotto. The Pope tries to decide who is to marry his daughter. Cem is murdered, and the grateful Sultan's gold is used as Lucrezia's dowry.

4 | Lucrezia's Wedding | Simon Cellan-Jones | April 17, 2011 |

Rodrigo betrothes his daughter Lucrezia to Giovanni Sforza. In order not to bring a perception of disrepute to his daughter's lineage, he forbids the girl's mother from attending the wedding, much to the chagrin of both Lucrezia and Cesare. Cardinal Della Rovere courts Neapolitan and French authorities, promising to support France's claim on Naples if he gets their aid in deposing Pope Alexander VI. The wedding proceeds as planned, without Vannozza. After the ceremony, however, Cesare brings her to the reception, to the shock of many of the guests. It quickly causes the marriage to go sour. The following night, Lucrezia is brought to Giovanni's home.

5 | The Borgias in Love | John Maybury | April 24, 2011 |

Lucrezia is very unhappy with her brutish husband, and the pope is tormented by nightmares about her. After Florence, Della Rovere tries to secure safe passage for French troops from the Sforza Duke of Milan. Cesare follows to Florence, offering the Medici an inquisition against the preacher Savonarola, in exchange for denying free passage to the French. Lucrezia flirts with a handsome young servant and entices him to sabotage her husband's saddle so that he will have a riding accident, which he does. The Borgias are soliciting suitable brides for Juan. Cesare kills Ursula Bonadeo's husband.

6 | The French King | John Maybury | May 1, 2011 |

Lucrezia nurses her wounded husband, and takes the servant as her lover. The King of Naples offers a daughter of his as a bride for Juan Borgia. Juan goes to Naples to sound out a possible marriage with his under-age brother Joffre instead. Della Rovere, now in France, tries to win the favor of the French king. Cesare takes Ursula as a mistress, but she is overwhelmed by scruples and flees to a nunnery. Joffre Borgia marries Sancia of Naples, who is having an affair with Juan.

7 | Death, on a Pale Horse | Jeremy Podeswa | May 8, 2011 |

The aged King Ferdinand of Naples dies and is succeeded by his son Alfonso. King Charles VIII of France, with Cardinal Della Rovere in his train, invades Italy and is given free passage by the Sforza Duke of Milan. Victory seems inevitable as the French sack the city of Lucca. In fear of a similar fate, Florence capitulates to the French king's harsh terms. Rodrigo sends Giulia Farnese to Giovanni Sforza to confirm his loyalty in arms. Once there, she discovers the House of Sforza will do nothing should the invasion continue into Rome. Giulia also realizes that Lucrezia is pregnant, albeit not by her husband, and advises they both flee in secret.

8 | The Art of War | Jeremy Podeswa | May 15, 2011 |

Giulia and Lucrezia escape Pesaro on horseback at dawn. The pope musters his forces to meet the French challenge. While Giovanni Sforza is torturing the page, the two ladies ride into the French army and are taken into the king's custody. Lucrezia charms the king, and when a battle is about to commence, she engineers an truce between him and her brother Juan, the general of the Papal forces. As the French approach Rome, the cardinals flee to safety.

9 | Nessuno (Nobody) | Jeremy Podeswa | May 22, 2011 |

The French army marches into a deserted Rome. Cardinal Della Rovere expects a convening of the College of Cardinals to depose the pope, but the pope strikes a deal with King Charles of France to recognize him as ruler of Naples. Charles is crowned King of France and Naples in a pompous affair in Rome. Meanwhile, Cesare and Micheletto travel to Pesaro and kidnap Giovanni Sforza in a scheme to have his marriage with Lucrezia annulled. They frame Sforza for being unable to consummate the marriage, by obliging him to prove his potency in front of the college of cardinals. Sforza is unable to endure such ridicule and declares that he is impotent; the marriage is annulled in an humiliating ordeal for Sforza. The French army reaches Naples, where they find the city ravaged by the plague and full of corpses. Lucrezia gives birth to a baby boy, after which she is joined by the rest of the Borgias.
