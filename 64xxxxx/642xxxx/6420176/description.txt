                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Members of the public hope to sell their prized possessions to arts dealers, and are
 forced to gamble their offers in an effort to make sure they receive the best value.
 The first would-be sellers bring with them a collection of Christmas cards from Lady
 Diana, an original 1960s Dalek, a cigar once owned by Winston Churchill and a Francis
 Bacon portrait that was nearly destroyed by the artist.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
