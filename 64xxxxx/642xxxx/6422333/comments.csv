Tested and working.

""The audio has been changed to AC3 instead of AAC ...please check before downloading...if any complaints please let me know here on tpb...thanks :) ""


Please check the screens and sample before downloading..

If you like the download/encode/upload (not the movie) and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you"
