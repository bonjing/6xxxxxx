[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T15:02Z,"@hkoraddi: Beta versions can be good, I still use 2.2.1 beta and not release version. It depends on build, it's crucial. So, visit Forum there every few days, download and try all 3.0 builds, as they appear. When you got good one - stop and use it. Betas have some things non-functional or crappy, but it might be that in things one don't need  work perfectly well, and die only in areas not wanted/used/needed by specific user, environment or task(s). Shortly, try, maybe dozen betas out."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T15:21Z,@hkoraddi: Just have been thinking - is there any new feature older WebUI does not have? Have you tried Firefox extension'

,gavin12,2011-05-26T17:43Z,"@20-40
Wondered if requests are ok at the moment and if so would it be possible for you to encode http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101775/ in the highest iPad compatible resolution?
Thanks for Modern Family as well"
[T],frapper101,2011-05-26T18:21Z,Thanks for looney tunes..:)
,japz007,2011-05-26T18:36Z,please do the big bang theory season 4..... thanks
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T18:39Z,"@gavin12: I can't find DVD anywhere, so, only plain re-encode for iPod is possible according to your preferred 360p. Be aware that quality would be well below current encodes, especially BluRay or HDTV rips. Also, I would see if source is old full-screen 4:3 or wide-screen 16:9 what determines encoding parameters - iPod have 16:10 display aspect ratio and doesn't ""like"" old TV aspect-ratio (4:3). I usually add black bars on left and right - but it doesn't look good on computers. 
So, read this and let me know. Do you need it for iPod exclusively?"
,snair1591,2011-05-26T18:39Z,thank you so much for doing happy endings again..love this show..:)
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T18:43Z,"@japz007: It was my regular show since episode one. All episodes are encoded and uploaded, so as ALL gag-reels (bloopers), specials and un-aired episodes."
,jamydoug,2011-05-26T18:50Z,"@twentyforty : sir wit all due respect if i may ask, can u do Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975).. it was out in Blu Ray last week!!

can u pls do in ur usual 720p super quality???
thanks in advance!!"
,myrabbitisdead,2011-05-26T19:03Z,thank you for Game of Thrones!!
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T19:30Z,"@jamydoug: Barry Lyndon Blu-ray disk was released in January - 2010!
Since then gazillion 720p rips have been done - by HDBrise, SINNERS and CineFile encoded 1080p more than year  ago."
,Cavemann,2011-05-26T19:37Z,Thanks for CM.
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T19:41Z,"@@gavin12: I found 640x360 XviD DVDrip and can send you a link for direct download (MU). It's not excellent rip - but re-encoding can just make it worse. Your iPod can play XviD too.

If you want that one, my e-mail is up here, drop me a note there and I would reply by sending you that link."
,sadhu19,2011-05-26T20:01Z,"thanks for south park .

,conspiracy.rules,2011-05-27T07:18Z,"@jamydoug, it hasnt come out yet!!!  

Barry Lyndon
1975 (2011) - Warner Bros. (Warner)
Released on Blu-ray Disc on May 31st, 2011"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T08:07Z,"@jamydoug: I have rip from 01-02-2010, 01:06 AM - that is EXACT time-stamp of the file. Not just me. However - what is root of confusion for both you and  conspiracy.rules:

Warner Bross have released Stanley Kubrick: Limited Edition Collection on Blu-ray (same marketing strategy as for A Clockwork Orange 40th Anniversary Edition) when HollyBolly tries to get as much money possible by simply re-naming, re-packing and re-branding existing releases.

To wash out any further misunderstandings I would encode Barry L. next week."
,ahmedv,2011-05-27T09:13Z,Thanks for South Park and MFamily
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T09:29Z,"@@jamydoug: I did encoding test - and I cannot make it 1.37 GB (my limit), to fit as 720p without seriously compromising the quality. It is OVER 3 h long movie, 16/9 (NOT theatrical aspect ratio 2.35/1) and it could be great 480p - but as 720p I cannot do it. Sinners made 720p as 8 GB for that reason."
,jamydoug,2011-05-27T14:49Z,"@twentyforty : thats ok sir, 480p is good.. i dont know much abt encoding but is it possible to use 1000+ bitrate in 480p rip???

thanks for accepting anyway!!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-27T16:33Z,"@@@jamydoug: First, people should realize that 480p has approx. by one third bigger frame-size picture than almost all XviDs (unless 720p is used for XviD but with file-size from 3 to 4.4 GB).

480p is smaller in frame size than 720p and definitely smaller by file-size - but - nice looking compromise when small file size is needed, especially welcomed alternative when source has 16/9 (1.77/1) and not narrow wide theatrical 2.35/1 aspect ratio usual for movies, when production doesn't target both TV and cinema theaters.

In answer to your question: Yes, with any frame-size bitrate can go as high as 264 goes - but standardized categorization (limits) must be obeyed to match wanted internal H264 ""profile"" (sort of category, not to be confused with encoding-programs target profiles).

For example, Barry Lyndon is 3h05 long - it is like TWO movies, right? Movie is shot in 16/9 aspect (god-knows why back then) and to be good as I want them to be - as 480p must be 1 GB and as 720p little over 2 (what is out of the question). There are few x264 encoders who willingly go too low, and every few movies ""smack the shit"". I compare my encodes with others, privately, and in some cases, as in ""Unstoppable"" ALL small-sized encodes excluding mine - totally fell apart in scene when train enters the curve before entering the town (people who  watched movie know what scene is that).

Point being - my encodes are more of constant quality - 100 share same quality, when others, searching for some holy grail - make 5 good then 1 ugly encode or similar. I don't.

And - I don't do one encode every four days or in a week - in ""normal"" times I do 100-130 encodes per WEEK."
