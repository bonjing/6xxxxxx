,80spreferred,2011-05-31T05:16Z,"80zforever, thank you for sharing!  I have received some very cool music from you.  I'm only familiar with 5-10% of what you have posted.  By the time I found you about 2 months ago some of the old posts nolonger have seeds.  I have about 30 posts that are dead-Let me know if I should post the list or email them.  If you or someone else would be kind enough to reshare/reseed.  I would be grateful.  If not, I'll be thankful for what I have :) Thanks"
