This is a big archive of almost every available European scenery that exists for Flight Simulator 2004. Payware airports are also included, and it's all already added into the scenery.cfg file, so that you don't have to manual add it every time. Right now it has 1053 areas. I am sure there are some airports that I could have missed, of maybe they just don't exist at all, but most are.
