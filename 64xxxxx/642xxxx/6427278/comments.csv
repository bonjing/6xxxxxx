,The4given1,2011-09-26T11:41Z,"@AD222
Mate are you stupid? If you look at the downloaded files at 98% you will notice that you have both discs with the programme on, the only parts that don't download are the keygen and updates, but with google you can get them easy :)"
,AD222,2011-10-06T05:38Z,"@The4given1 I Google it and found one but now I'm getting this error when I open Stylus ""Missing element on Part 1: Default/< Please Select a Directory/ Sound Check...what do I do now and My Omnisphere core Library is corrupted. -__- "

If anyone knows a keygen that does work? or can contact me about the challenge code?
