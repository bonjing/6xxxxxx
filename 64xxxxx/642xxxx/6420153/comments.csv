,drtofuu,2011-09-06T03:54Z,"THANK YOU for uploading this movie in what seems to be such a great quality, still downloading. However, such a crappy BD cover image? OK, it's  only 283kb, yeah, but if i am spending 2 gigs in my hard drive for a movie, i can probably spare a couple megs in a better, bigger image for the case cover. Just a suggestion. Thanks!, "
