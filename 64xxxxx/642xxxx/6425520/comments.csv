,Roylewaa,2011-07-24T19:36Z,"Is because it's 6 channel audio, you need to adjust your dvd/player settings"
,QuantumDriven,2011-08-10T13:11Z,I can't believe I never heard of this motherfucker. It's a scandal the way movies get buried just because they refuse to pay the fucking Jews $150 million in advertising.

,Gabriel43,2012-02-11T04:38Z,you guys are seriously going to defend someone who is blatantly racist? nice to know what the world has come to.
,jimblah,2012-02-13T06:10Z,I hate religion... Is that racist?  In this film religion is an issue.  Archeology clearly indicates mankind originated on the African continent and migrated.
,john86roe,2012-03-30T03:55Z,"@QuantumDriven Don't know what planet you live on but back when it was in the cinemas it was advertise a lot here....  Try opening your eyes, Oh wait you can't i see your eyes must be always closed... Dishing the Jews wow how old are we???"
,sidehatz,2012-04-29T03:35Z,"@Ubida being jewish isnt a race, its a religion, hence no ones being a ""rascist"""
,mikeywiz,2012-06-17T18:16Z,"I think it's pretty sad to see people hate others based on race or religion ...even sadder to see some religions that teach hatred.

I have no problem with people being different.

In fact I think the female ape is hot !"
,mikeywiz,2012-06-17T18:20Z,"If I can get her number ... do you think she and I will have any issues over differences inn religion ?

Could we make it work ?

Or would we just monkey around a bit ?"
