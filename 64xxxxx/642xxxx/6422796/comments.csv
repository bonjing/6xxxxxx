It works, just read....pffffffffffff"
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-05-27T17:46Z,"I have compared (benchmarked) with Eset Smart Security 4 v4.2.71.2. Eset Smart Security 5 has the fastest scan engine and is lightest AV I have ever seen. 

To the hardworking ESET team: Hail To The King of Antiviruses!"
,ShadowMastr,2011-06-07T05:35Z,"If it's a beta, they will stop supporting/updating it when it goes into general release, so locking the trial so it doesn't run out doesn't really seem prudent??"
,josearevalo,2011-06-08T00:00Z,thank you guys. it is great 
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-08T10:43Z,"Even with the definition files that come pre-installed with this AV it is a powerful 
STANDALONE AV THAT DOESN'T NEED UPDATION. 

Of course it has heuristic scan engine that can detect unknown viruses.
