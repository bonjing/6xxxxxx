I'M WONDERING IF IT IS A VIRUS/TROGAN/MALWARE...OR MY SYSTEM JUST CAN'T MAMAGE SUCH A FILE OR WHAT..."
[T],DBaum23,2011-05-30T22:50Z,"What player are you trying to open it with?  If you have an older PC,  it probably can't handle 1280x720 resolution videos.  Make sure you opening it with Media Player Classic or VLC player.  Don't use the default windows media player.  There is no virus in the video file."
