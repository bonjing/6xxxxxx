""This is the way the world ends. Not with a bang but a whimper."" - T.S. Elliot ""The Hollow Men""

I'm currently reviewing some more anime for you guys! ATM Full Metal Panic is looking promising, but the VAs are kinda lame :P

Please leave a little note at the end of your comics along the lines of ""Eechi +1"" or ""Gore -1"" etc, that'll help me know what my audience likes! :D"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-05-26T18:17Z,Comments* Stupid auto-correct :P
,4theFam,2011-05-27T01:34Z,Thanks for the eps of this. I it is an old show but you think there is any way you could do Lupin III?
,grEnkenoB,2011-05-27T05:34Z,"Well done sir, well done indeed.

Ecchi: +/-1
Violence: +1
Gore: +1
Extreme Violence: +1
Disturbing Violence: +2

F'd up violence is the way to go for me, i.e. claymore, gantz, corpse princess, higurashi.

Elfen Lied was a little weak on the violence but still great. Gantz took a little bit to get into but it got absolutely awesome later on when what's his face found his balls, ending sucked though. I would really like to find a show that is appallingly violent by my standards, that would be great. Not just gory and extreme but truly disturbing.
Thanks!"
,bamsen82,2011-05-27T07:48Z,there are a ova when do you think itÂ´s come out on eng dub.. :D

,XX-_Mazeba_-XX,2011-05-28T00:40Z,"@grEnkenoB, Omg, i forgot about gantz.. 

If you, hipo, could get gantz eng. dubbed, that'd be amazing.."
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-05-28T03:26Z,"@bamsen82; I can't say. Sorry :/

@grEnkenoB; Thanks for the info about what you like ^-^

@XX-_Mazeba_-XX; I've found Gantz, but it's only SD. I'm gonna try to find somehting in 720p, it looks interesting :P"
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-05-28T03:39Z,"Found a 720p Gantz source, investigating."
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-05-28T07:04Z,Gantz S01E01 is up in 480p Dual Audio ;)
,norwayspeedoman,2011-06-16T06:49Z,Is this uncensored?
[T],hipolipolopigus,2011-06-20T14:08Z,@norwayspeedoman; Naturally ;)
,norwayspeedoman,2011-07-04T02:49Z,Thank you man. Seeded 
,zValkyrie,2011-12-07T05:52Z,I really like the fact that the episodes are all separated just in case someone would like to get a specific episode but I suggest you make a torrent where there is all 12 episodes in one :O would make things alot easier for people who want it all in one shot.
,DSJeffers,2012-02-11T05:54Z,Sweet thanks! I only needed 4 eps because a mass DL i got had the last 4 corrupt so thanks for the single eps!
