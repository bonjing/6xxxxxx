Anthony Zimmer is a consummate con artist who is in the spotlight all the world's policeman. Nobody knows their appearance. However, in the race that pits those who want to hunt, there's someone who plays with edge. Akerman is a policeman rather peculiar: he knows that Zimmer would risk his life to see again Chiara. One day, she cited the offender inaccessible, but only receives a message from you. In order to confuse their pursuers, Zimmer asks Chiara to address a stranger to make everyone believe he is the person they are looking for. Chiara catches the eye of FranÃ§ois, an ordinary man who, fascinated by the girl, eventually plunged into a nightmare. Between manipulation and false pretenses, all end up realizing that, beyond appearances, no more than pieces of a chess game awaits the arrival of the master.
