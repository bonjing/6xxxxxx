 My daughter thanks you profusely for Water For Elephants, and has a request, Blue Valentine, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1120985/, which she says is ""supposed to be hauntingly well acted""."""

Wondering if you could get a hold of Adams Curtis' documentaries, there is a torrent of it up but the encodes are much bigger than they deserve to be:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5119790/Adam_Curtis_Collection_%28Century_of_the_Self__The_Trap__etc.%29

Apparently they're an incredible expose of what's really going on in the world of power. Unfortunately, unable to download such big files of mediocre quality."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T13:48Z,"@Yajoo: Google video has big collection, Youtube and few www based video archives too.

Video quality is the same (as ones in torrent) - as you've said ""mediocre quality"" or much much worse.
Point being, I can make videos smaller (file-sizes) but - I CANNOT make them better (these from torrent).

Aside from that - it is HUGE task, both encoding and later upload and after that seeding - a task for admirers of Curtis's work, not me, I am intrigued enough for watching it - but such task is definitely too big for small capacities I have for accepting it. For what is worth, I am sorry."
