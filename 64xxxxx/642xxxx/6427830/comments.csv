,laurenlee653,2011-05-28T03:34Z,"When I go to play it it goes through all loading screens and then I get a ""disc authorization failure"". I applied all cracks. Is anyone else having this problem? :( All versions of the game have been patched."
,psynwinny,2011-05-28T06:13Z,you did put the crack in the sims 3 instillation folder didnt you and not the generations folder
,psynwinny,2011-05-28T11:41Z,right the prob is that you have to delete all saved games in documents ea games the sims before playing the game or it wont load
,psynwinny,2011-05-28T12:00Z,also i would probably back them up just in case
