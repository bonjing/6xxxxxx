Release Description

Fraps is a universal Windows application that can be used with games using DirectX or OpenGL graphic technology. In its current form Fraps performs many tasks and can best be described as: Benchmarking Software â€“ Show how many Frames Per Second (FPS) you are getting in a corner of your screen. Screen Capture Software â€“ Take a screenshot with the press of a key! Thereâ€™s no need to paste into a paint program every time you want a new shot. Your screen captures are automatically named and timestamped. Realtime Video Capture Software â€“ Have you ever wanted to record video while playing your favourite game? Fraps can capture audio and video up to 2560Ã—1600 with custom frame rates from 10 to 120 frames per second! NVIDIA have recently included stereoscopic 3D support directly into their drivers. If you play your DirectX9 (D3D9) game with 3D Vision enabled you can use Fraps to record the game in full 3D too!
