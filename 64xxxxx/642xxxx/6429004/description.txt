These are all the free DLC for Fable 3 pc straight out of the xlive folder.


included here is-
dye pack
5star dog potion
female and male highlander outfits
free weapons
yule hat
hair pack
highlander tattoo set
red setter dog potion

I'm still figuring out where to put these files to get them to work for the skidrow version.
I was going to wait to put this up after I figured out how to get them to work but I was hoping someone may be able to help to get the game to recognize these.

All I did for these files was to open a game for windows account and it let me download the files even though I don't have fable 3.I was sick of looking for these and I still hope skidrow releases the paid DLC soon.

so here they are and let me know i you can get them working,I'm going to keep trying and I will update how to do it if I figure it out
