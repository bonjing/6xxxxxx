I'm still having problems getting my skidrow version to recognize these files so let me know if you can get them to work"
,darb82,2011-05-28T16:53Z,"I restarted a game and got to the point where the built in dlc(hunters lodge with boxer potion and aurion suit)and it still hasen't shown up.

I took these files out of the game for windows file the path is

owner/appdata/local/mircosoft/xlive/DLC 
I just changed the file name in the the dlc folder from 4d53090a to fable 3 dlc-and thats whats in this torrent
All I did was open a account and then in gfwl I selected these free dlc and it let me download them even though I don't have the official game in the account..
I was kinda hoping I could of just put a dlc folder in the data folder like fallout but of course its gotta be a bitch"
,toto621,2011-05-29T02:14Z,"Fable 3 is built to unlock DLC content only for online accounts.

This is the retarded way...I bought this game on Steam and got a Bonus DLC with it. To use it, I was forced to create an account, register the game and then redeem the code.

I tried to play with an offline account, no DLC, nothing. The second I switched to online account, all was unlocked.

I don't know if there is a way to unlock DLCs for offline accounts with GFWL but on Xbox360 it's possible with fable 2. I just fear this time, MS make it impossible, like they did with the guild chest in fable 2 (unable ot open it or empty with offline accounts)."

this worked for me"
,XiONDiGiTaL,2011-06-01T12:21Z,"follow the instructions of the torrent the user posted right above me, they work for this torrent too"
,ravenlingat,2011-06-04T09:17Z,@xiondigital how did you get traitors keep to work?
,darb82,2011-07-15T05:15Z,"If you want to use this dlc without needing the legit gfwl account download this
http://timeslip.users.sourceforge.net/current/fable3-xlive.7z

follow the readme txt and use this torrent for the files"
,Jamm611,2011-08-21T16:01Z,"Click the Link on the above post, The xlive.dll does work, I tested it, It works fine, not all the dlc is showing up in the game however, but i have to give Timeslip compliments on finding this work around, you need to un-install g4wl then install the xlive.dll from timeslips site, create a .ini file and download the free dlc into the proper place and it works..if you cant figure it out, then you should bust up your keyboard, shell out 50 bucks for the game and keep playing the xbox...hope this helps Mates :)...it does work follow the readme careful!!"
,Jamm611,2011-08-21T16:06Z,"by the way only the free dlc showed up in-game.
i got the highlander outfit to work, all the free dog breeds, new weapons.

the dyes and hair did not show up in my testing, but most of the free dlc di1d work!!"
,Jamm611,2011-08-21T16:12Z,the xlive.dll works with the SKIDROW release!!!
,Jamm611,2011-08-22T11:07Z,"ok, i did some more testing today, i got traitors keep to work with most of the free dlc, you must use the xlive.dll and the fakexlive.ini.

when you copy the dlc to the game dir, only copy the contents folder, nothing else!!!

also make sure all the packages are listed in the package_collection_info.xmb or they wont show up, open it with notepad to edit.

the dlc is gifted during the story progression, you should get most of it by the time you leave the Dweller camp, the Traitors keep is tied to the butler Hobson in the Castle Treasury, and will not show up until after the main story is completed!!
Start a new Game!!!
hope this helps mates :)"
,darb82,2011-08-28T07:09Z,"@Jamm611

See my comment on ""DLC traitors keep"" torrent for instruction on how to unlock both Understone and Traitors keep with modding and xlive.dll."
