If I were performing a play titled The Americans, Iâ€™d want Jim White to write the score for it as well. It just makes sense to have one of the great songwriting documentarians of the weird, wonderful, holy and sacrilegious aspects of the American South on board to document something with as broad a title as The Americans: Part 1: The Lay of the Land. The play, based on the collected works of Sam Shepherd, was performed at the Juliard Drama School in February of 2010 and White, along with Dan Nettles, composed a set of 16 songs to go along with the play. Jim White presents: Sounds of the Americans isnâ€™t the proper follow-up to his 2007 album Transnormal Skiperoo, but it does echo the more whimsical, darkly weird and fantastic storytelling aspects of Whiteâ€™s oeuvre.

The album is bookended by covers, but of different varieties. It opens with Whiteâ€™s take on Daniel Johnstonâ€™s â€œSpeeding Motorcycle,â€ a jangly, uptempo version that explodes in a joyous and rambunctious tone. The songâ€™s metaphor of heart as motorcycle is appropriate for some of the themes of love that bubble up in various forms across the record. Two spoken-word pieces titled, appropriately, â€œLetter 1â€ and â€œLetter 2? find a teenage girlâ€™s diary entries as they lament over how to approach someone. â€œRamblerâ€ pontificates about the excellent nature of the titular car and how it was the best one ever â€œmade in the U.S.A.,â€ as it gets passed down from a father to son in a scene that recalls Richard Thompsonâ€™s â€œVincent Black Lightning 1952.â€ Love even surfaces in a series of pieces where newspaper articles recall odd events like the man who claims, as the victim of a rear-end collision, that his heterosexuality has been switched off in â€œBut I Love Herâ€ or the accidental vengeful murder in the middle of a church in â€œHunters Groove.â€

There are moments of more pure Americana culture as well. â€œSimulacrumâ€ sounds like a technological chant of devotion to consumerism; â€œSuckerz Promisesâ€ takes the same embrace of the American Dream and mocks it as a mugâ€™s game; and a forward-thinking evangelist in â€œEsoteric Text Found in a Religious Garbage Canâ€ uses Biblical text to proffer that good and loving Christians take to the heavens to find and minister to their unconverted alien brethren. All of these are mixed in a hodgepodge of blues, r&b, rock, country and musique concrete that take the â€˜melting potâ€™ metaphor to its natural conclusion as the backdrop to the diverse and devoted voices of the narrators.

The last track, and the other â€˜cover,â€™ is a re-working of Whiteâ€™s â€œBluebird,â€ originally from 2004's Drill a Hole in that Substrate.. In a conversation with White years ago, around the time of the release of ..Substrate, he expressed a desire to have others sing his own music â€“ to play on the tracks himself, but have others voice the words he wrote. What starts as a nearly music-less opening driven only by the female singerâ€™s voice slowly becomes an amazing channeling of the originalâ€™s haunting examination of desperation into a much more hopeful and daring piece. As a conclusion, it loops back on the opening sentiments of love and brings about Whiteâ€™s own wishes from years ago and finds them actualized. As a documentation of â€œthe Americans,â€ it couldnâ€™t get much more perfect than that.
