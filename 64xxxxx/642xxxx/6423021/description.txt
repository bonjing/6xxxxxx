Although all of these OS' were previously leaked, it's pretty awesome that AVEA just unleashed them all at once for everyone who either may not have had a chance to grab them yet or prefers to stick to official OS releases from a carrier. OS 6.0.0.570 is now available for the BlackBerryBold 9780. If you're not on AVEA just remember to delete the  vendor.xml file before installing and you'll be good to go.
