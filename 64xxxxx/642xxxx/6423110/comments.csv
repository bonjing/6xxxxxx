,lestatvvvvvv,2011-05-26T09:30Z,"Well kelefman , you need to seed your uploads , if you dont seed it we will never get a complete download and then you get no more seeders and eventually your torrent will die off due to lack of seeders.
so please seed"
,kelefman,2011-05-26T12:50Z,"thnx lestatvvvvvv, I have followed the uploading thread, I believe correctly-and I thought I was seeding as I have left my system up and running since posting, any tips on what I may be doing stupidly newbie wrong-kelef"

Not complete, without a season finale...
You suck...

,Orbnotacus,2011-06-01T00:07Z,"Ughh... disregard my previous comment... FOX needs to get their shit together... On THIER website it said 2hr House season finale playing the 30th... and of coarse, now it doesn't... my bad... "
,Dashsway,2011-06-08T19:35Z,I believe i speak for the....what 75 of us leachers when i say somebody need to start seeding this. If i get the whole thing ill take it up myself for a month. But some one needs to seed it. 
,tomleedsutd,2011-08-18T23:34Z,any chance of someone people seeding please
,mesmis,2011-10-05T23:45Z,Thankyou so much
,alianos,2011-10-07T19:20Z,"There are 70 leechers with the grand total 0% of the torrent.

So I take it the torrent is dead, save yourself the trouble and move on to the next one!"
