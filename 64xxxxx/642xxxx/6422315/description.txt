Despite Oasis' big claim to be a much better band than The Beatles, as well as proclaiming to be the best band in the world, they have made some excellent, tasty music that's hard not to love. (What's The Story) Morning Glory? is a non-stop train of tasty, ear-pleasing rock candy, with that, add in a little bit of swaggering attitude, and you have Oasis' niche. Probably their best album.
