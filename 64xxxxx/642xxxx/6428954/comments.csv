Did you forget me ? You told me that you'll re-do the Jurassic Park Fullscreen collector's edition trilogy -rip 'em in good quality,as the last ones were bad in quality . I have waited for long , at least give a reply saying whether you'll be able to re-do and upload them or not. That would help, otherwise I keep hoping in vain that you would keep your request.  I originally posted the request in your previous Righteous kill torrent-

Thanks again in advance."
