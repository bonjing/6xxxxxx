Installation instructions;

1. Your 'phone MUST be rooted. There is no other option.

2. Install the APK as you would any other application, but do
   NOT press the HOME key. If you accidentally pressed the HOME
   key or need to press it to get to other sections of your
   'phone, respond to the "use which launcher" prompt by
   clicking your original launcher - not SPB3D.

3. Use a terminal emulator or Root Explorer to...
   a. copy the included LIBMOBILESHELL.SO file
      to the directory /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib
      #cp libmobileshell.so /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib
   b. change the permissions on the file to 755
      #chmod 755 /data/data/com.spb.shell3d/lib/libmobileshell.so

   If you're using Root Explorer, permissions need to be set to;
     Owner:  Read/Write/Execute
     Group:  Read/Execute
     Others: Read/Execute

4. Press the HOME key. When prompted, select SPB Shell 3D.

5. Once you're happy with wanting to keep SPB Shell 3D as your
   launcher, tick the "set as default" the next time you press
   the HOME key, then select SPB Shell 3D.
