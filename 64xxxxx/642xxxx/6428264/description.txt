The program was made around late 2008 by Stuntman9472, he used to play ROBLOX but quit after getting hacked. The program hasn\'t had any new version since 7.0 to my knowledge, and he has no intention of updating it or going back to ROBLOX, though I don\'t know for sure. Just my guess.

From what he said originally on the forums when he made it, it was created in Visual Basic. I don\'t know what year, but from memory I think 2003.

To use the Friend Request Sender, (which is its only purpose for me currently) go to Tools in the upper right, and then obviously \"Friend Request Spammer\". Type in the ID number from someone\'s profile
 
http://www.roblox.com/User.aspx?ID=1

>ID=1

>1

Then do the same for the next one, and the difference in between them you\'ll send one at a time. This does in no way just send a friend request to everyone at once. That would be insane, though possible. 

If you have questions and comments, if it doesn\'t work, comment.
