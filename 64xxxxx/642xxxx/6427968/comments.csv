,aradiel,2011-05-29T06:41Z,"Respect the film maker by downloading shit for free?

Unless a screener gets out, this is as good as it's going to get. If you want a DVD rip you need to wait until it's released.

None of the files are archives, so no passwords. Trolls, morons, spambots?"

,TheReverendKROM,2011-06-20T17:37Z,sqwelssh- Once the torrent is down loaded it automatically seeds. I believe that most download software seeds while you are downloading. Your up speed is how much or how fast you are seeding. Anyway that is how it is with Utorrent downloader.
,TheReverendKROM,2011-06-20T17:41Z,"Just took the kid to the movies last night to see this he loved it, I personally thought the first one as better, but that goes without saying. I did not download this because I just can't sit through a cam movie I prefer to wait for the DVD rip. But thanks to frog100 for your participation."

,Andreetjuh77,2011-08-13T18:25Z,"THIS IS A BAD DOWNLOAD!

I only download movies if I've seen them on TV or in the cinema's. Kung Fu Panda 2 is not different from this cause I hate pirating. 

However, Half the movie is not filmed. I watched it in the cinema's in my native language, because well, the English one wasn't showing. I decided to download it in the English one and saw half the movie is off-screen. You'll miss half the movie watching this. 

NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING!!!!"
,Andreetjuh77,2011-08-13T18:30Z,"I'm sorry that I'm not English. With off-screen I mean only part of the screen has been filmed. So what you see is only part of the movie screen. Like literally half of the screen. You'll miss out on a lot of things if you watch this. 

BAD QUALITY FILMING. I say buy the DVD or watch the movie in the cinema's while it's still out there."
