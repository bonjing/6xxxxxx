Regards from me. +1."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-28T19:11Z,@puplone: Better wait next week. You should know that School of Rock was never released om BluRay and only DVD rip and encoding to max. 480p is possible.

thanks again for doing it in a double bash!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-28T23:50Z,"@pluto999: Default for MP4box - 500 msec. I never delay nor preload audio track, because players which use Haali ignores that, in contrary, internal splitter of MPC and of VLC accept delay values. Therefore, I don't change nothing in interleave and corrections (if needed) are done either in audio-editor program or by DelayAudio in Avisynth."
