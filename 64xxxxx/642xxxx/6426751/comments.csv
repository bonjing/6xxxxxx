,FackundoMexican,2011-10-25T18:27Z,same shit keygen doesnt work!
,ThePirateQueen,2012-02-11T22:35Z,"This worked fine for me.  In the keygen program you can just make up any name, and for the phone number I used a real area code but put all 999-9999's thereafter.  Then I clicked generate for my activation key.  While registering the program it will ask you for the same info (name and phone number), for which you will enter the same info as in the keygen.  Presto, that's it!  Hope that helps."
