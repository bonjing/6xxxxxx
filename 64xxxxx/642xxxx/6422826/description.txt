iNtrinsic from BlackBerry ThemePark is a must have for any BlackBerry user with an affinity for iphone style themes.  Unlike the traditional iphone or iBerry themes, iNtrinsic is a dark theme.  A complete set of sleek and majestic dark iphone icons that will have you staring at your screen all day long.  The home screen of iNtrinsic allows you to have 5 or 20 icons on it by hitting SPACEBAR to show the extra icons and ESCAPE to hide them.  iNtrinsic is equipped with RAK(Rapid Access Keyboard) as well, to give you maximum functionality on top of a beautiful screen.
