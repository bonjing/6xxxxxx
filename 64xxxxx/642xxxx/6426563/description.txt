MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that
you own into free and patents-unencumbered format that can
be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format converter,
otherwise called 'transcoder'. It converts the video clips
from proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of
MKV files, preserving most information but not changing it
in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio
tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.
There are many players that can play MKV files nearly on
all platforms, and there are tools to convert MKV files to
many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs.

Additionally MakeMKV can instantly stream decrypted video
without intermediate conversion to wide range of players,
so you may watch Blu-ray and DVD discs with your favorite
player on your favorite OS or on your favorite device.
