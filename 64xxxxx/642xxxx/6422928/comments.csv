,GeeBangkok,2011-05-27T16:41Z,"Thanks for the upload. 
I just wondered if I am the only one to notice sync issues?
The audio seems way off throughout the entire episode which made it frustrating to watch.
I'm not a noob who has no idea, I've been downloading for years and tried the file on MPC and WMP with the same result.
Has anyone else found the same issue with this episode?
I'm not complaining, I really appreciate you taking the time to upload this.
Thank you for your efforts!"

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-05-31T08:52Z,Its not a bike for phil harris-its for lost fishermen in general-theres an epitaph on the rear mudguard to phil & they (nubby or the uvver bloke) did a tank seperate (which wasnt filmed or aired on occ-just a few shots on DC phil harris ep) for phil that went into his memorial crab pot & was launched into the bearing sea.Why are these now called series two when its series 7 or 8?
