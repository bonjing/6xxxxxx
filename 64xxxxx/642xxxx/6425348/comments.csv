[T],Torrent4nu,2011-05-27T15:03Z,"Beste NLUPPER,

zou je de films:

The Fast and the Furious (2001)
2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)
Fast & Furious (2009) 

Voor mij kunnen uploaden zou ik erg tof vinden.
Nog bedankt voor deze film.

,Vegasbob,2011-05-28T07:09Z,Please don't post this garbage in the DVDR area. This does NOT qualify as a DVD rip. I don't care what kind of Hi Def video recorder you used TS is TS. Which means it was recorded by a cam pointed at a movie screen. Moron

Thanks"
,PageEsquire,2011-05-29T20:37Z,This is pointed at Vegasbob. There is a difference between a cam and a TS. A cam is shot from the middle of the theater and a TS is shot from the back of the projector bulb in the booth. This will make a high def copy of the movie if done right. And you must be a moron to think there would be a real dvdr of this. It is still in the theater you dunce!
,skydogg3,2011-05-30T02:53Z,"I think what vegasbob was trying to get across, is it is not a DVD rip. A high def Camera or my old Betamax, regardless where and how it is filmed how shouldn't be put into a section called ""MOVIES DVDR"" when there is no DVD involved. All these TS movies, i feel, should go into ""MOVIES"" or better yet, give them there own category."
,chuck62,2011-05-30T03:59Z,DVD section shit for brains
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-05-30T15:44Z,"Bedankt, kwaliteit voor TS niet slecht. En @ Torrent4nu: Check mijn uploads, daar staan deze bij in HD!"
,syntexNL,2011-05-30T21:54Z,"kijk het is leuk en aardig dat je van een andere site een nl sub er onder zet.

Maar waarom verspil je die kleine moeite aan deze kut kwaliteit? "
,mitru6,2011-05-31T02:32Z,"Please use proper section, you posted this unwatchable crap in DVDR section. By the way, PageEsquire you can sometimes download actual dvdr's while the movie is still in theatres, they are called director's copy or something like that, although they are rare, they do exist."
,L3fT4D34D,2011-06-03T03:47Z,"WHY DO YOU POST HORRIBLE QUALITY MOVIES IN THE HIGH QUALITY SECTION..

fuck"
,jarnovergote,2011-06-03T11:34Z,Ik vind het stom dat mensen klagen over kwaliteit komaan je weet toch dat het TS is wat had je verwacht Dvd-kwaliteit? :S
,elvair,2011-06-05T08:04Z,someone KILL that FUCK NLUPPER002 - who is uploading SHIT QUALITY movies into INCORRECT CATEGORIES
,derocom,2011-06-06T00:47Z,"Heads up....If it is NOT a DVD rip, then please put the movie into another category. TS or not.Thanks for all the uploads, but please learn to read. "

,frjoop,2011-06-09T13:28Z,"This is pointed at PageEsquire. We are not here for a lecture/debate on the differences between cam and TS. We are here looking for torrents suitable for downloading and believe having chosen the correct subcategories, that the options within are what the category suggests in the first place. It has now been many weeks since NLUPPER002 starting posting/uploading random shite all over the place despite many requests to stop doing so. Now here's a suggestion for your good self, why not take your moronic/duncical comments to a forum on TS/cam debates and refrain from abusing users with genuine grievances about an uploaders inability to post in the correct category. prick!"
,MorphzreaZ,2011-06-09T14:17Z,"it says TS (SCREENER),so read before u whine.. ty for upload"

TO NLUPPER002: i will hit your mommy in the head with a big,blue dildo for giving birth to you if i see her! :P"
,Epizen,2011-06-12T21:08Z,"Hey fagnuts, DVD section AND you said there were images in this post, I see none. Retard."
,Biscuit101,2011-06-13T18:44Z,Not a DVDR.
,The_Reasoner,2011-06-14T21:33Z,"Guys, it's not called the ""DVDrip"" section. It's called ""DVDR"". That means the files are the correct size and format to be burned to a DVD-R that will play on most DVD players. 

DVDrip and DVD-R do not mean the same thing!"
,princ06,2011-06-16T00:56Z,"  ""  NLUPPER002 VIP "".. is a renown ... name .. Just dont .. ruin dis ..wid ...weird ..shitty..UP^.."
,Aurasan,2011-06-16T01:54Z,Garbage. Thanks.
,ruleoffire,2011-06-18T18:13Z,"Page esquire, Your right TS can be good, and i appreciate people like NLUPPER002 and their efforts. But it would kinda be nice to have a section dedicated to just Rips. I am often just browsing, and would rather browse through non-ts. But you right, people should bitch and moan. IT CLEARLY says ts. If you dont know what that means, educate yourself before you share your opinion here.

Comments on ts versions should be reserved to A?/V?. I cant believe people are still flooding them with this crap."
,darthbane980,2011-06-20T23:25Z,"Does somebody knows how much time it will take for a DVDrip to be released ?
Thanks"
,kolin668,2011-06-22T17:33Z,"WTF why are people always copying someone else his torrent and only change the name or rang of maps in the torrent and by the way NLUPPER002 it's realy bad for your reputation to copy a cam file and tell us that it's not a cam 
NOOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,kolin668,2011-06-22T17:38Z,"WAAROM KOPIEERD IEDEREEN EEN FKKING CAM EN DOET ALSOF HET ZIJN/HAAR TORRENT IS ECHT EEN ZOOTJE NOOBS ZEG ECHT GA EEN LEVEN ZOEKEN OFZO STELLETJE NIETSNUTTEN TYFUSLAAIERS EN PISVLEKKEN.

hopelijk is dat duidelijk genoeg!"
,panzersiddhartha,2011-06-30T00:25Z,"ONCE AGAIN IN SIMPLE WORDS FOR THE RETARDS:

DVDR MEANS DVD RECORDABLE, NOT RIP.
TS MEANS CAM WITH GOOD SOUND.
THIS IS A TS-TO-DVD RELEASE. 
SUICIDE IS COOL AND THE RIGHT THING FOR YOU.

Use wikipedia or google or whatever before you start yelling because what you downloaded matched what it said it would be. The NL-guys film stuff, adds on line-in-sound, makes it in DVD recordable format, puts it here, writes it clearly, gets tons of leechers and many then complain because they did not read the info. FUCK YOU complainers. I seldom download TeleSyncs or normal Cam, but if I do, I don't bitch about it."
,exxazz,2011-07-01T20:33Z,"@NLUPPPER002:
Please stop uploading non-dvd's to the category Movies DVDR. This category is purely for ripped DVD's. 
Instead use the Category Handheld regardless of the intended use. 
The categories are for how the film was captured and not for how anyone intended to watch the movie, regardless of the good intention. 

Thanks!"
,Fireskrit,2011-07-05T15:22Z,"God, to the people defending these TS uploaders; go fuck yourself. This is the DVDR section of TPB for a reason, people have the right to complain when what is uploaded (and especially several times with NLUPPER002) does not match the criteria they have searched for. Pull your heads out of your asses and stop defending retards like NLUPPER that have gained a VIP badge and can't even understand where to upload.
End of rant."
