I'm using VLC, which normally plays everything.  Here is the error:

VLC can't recognize the input's format:
The format of 'file:///N:/Movies/American.Graffiti.1973.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE/American.Graffiti.1973.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE.sub' cannot be detected. Have a look at the log for details."
