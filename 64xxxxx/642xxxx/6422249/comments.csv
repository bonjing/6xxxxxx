Video quality seems lower for a file this size.
There are many noticeable visual glitches throughout.
A few scenes are totally absent, the video will jump ahead about a second, the guy is talking on one side of the screen, then suddenly appears on the other side having apparently finished talking.

You can still watch it and get the gist of what's going on no problem, but the visual artifacts can be distracting.
