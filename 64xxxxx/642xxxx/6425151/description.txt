plot

The film is narrated by the adult Mattie Ross (Elizabeth Marvel), who explains that her father was murdered by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), when she was 14. Chaney made off with her father's horse and his two California gold pieces. While collecting her father's body, the 14-year old Mattie (Hailee Steinfeld) inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal to track down Chaney. The Sheriff gives three recommendations, but she chooses to hire Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) because he is described as having "true grit" which is what Mattie wants. He repeatedly rebuffs her attempts to talk with him. The next day, she attempts to hire Cogburn offering him $50 after reminding him of the government's payments. He doesn't believe she has it and refuses.
