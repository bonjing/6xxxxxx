CD Description
The record is an extension of their previous work, influenced in part by an association with the heavy doom and art-metal movement centered around Los Angeles label Southern Lord. This "unlikely" musical friendship between Sykes and influential underground bands SunnO)) and Boris was immortalized on the 2006 album `Altar', culminating in a headlining performance at the ATP festival. 
'Marble Son' is the sound of a band evolving -- urgently expanding to mirror the chaos of modern culture while not forgetting the beauty of the past--the result is more relevant than ever... and what a wonderful sound it is.
