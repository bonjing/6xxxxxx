They are only good to laugh at, once I watched one in which the hero was dressed like the Zorro and at the end, all his pals were also dressed like Zorros, when couples kissed the kiss was not shown but a flower instead, every few minutes, for no reason at all, they broke into stupid songs and dances, they perhaps donÂ´t realize HOW BACKWARD they are, it was quite funny... Classic? HAHAHAHA, 
yes, indeed... Perhaps classic comedy...."
