RELEASENOTES

French duo KRYSTAL SYSTEM took the underground music scene by
storm with their exploding debut album and the following groovy
floor-breaker extension EP "Underground: VooDoo Night Sessions".
Bonnie (female vox, guitars) and Seven's (male vox, synths and
bass) sonic alchemy received a resonating echo from music
journalists and DJs worldwide who had only enthusiastic and
positive words about their eclectic combination of musical
genres ranging from dark elektro and cold wave to industrial
rock and metal.

Two years later, the Paris-based combo are busy preparing their
new frontal assault with the new CD, "Nuclear". An album of
extreme musical strength, atomizing everything in its way in the
quest for the ultimate light, for that burning unreachable point
at the end of the infinite horizon. Thirteen powerful new
tracks, each standing alone by itself and bringing its very own
contribution to the album's sound depth and concept theme.

Revolting metal guitar riffs, raging industrial beats, fast
catchy synth sequences and Bonnie's provocative juvenile
filtered female vocals (both in English and in French) backed by
Seven's harsher voice make the eclectic universe of KRYSTAL
SYSTEM who here deliver one of the best albums ever released by
Belgium's prestigious Alfa Matrix label. "Nuclear" is an album
full to the brim with dynamics, grooves, anger and melodies
which breathes and transpires a forceful creativity and an
astounding song-writing maturity the whole collection of songs
benefits from top-notch production work from the prestigious
Parisian "Studios d'Or" and is crowned by the sharp mastering
work of Swift in London.

Fresh, brilliant, dark, upbeat and heavy, "Nuclear" is a
splendid album performed with no compromise but in all
simplicity at the crossroads of industrial metal and electro
rock.

The limited box edition of the album comes with poster and a
thirteen-track bonus CD featuring several exclusive remixes and
unreleased tracks, plus collaborations with artists such as
AMGOD, IMPLANT, PUNISH YOURSELF, TREPONEM PAL and the famous
Japanese DJ TAIKI, DJ ETHAN FAWKES and DJs DRILL/EDRIVE69.
