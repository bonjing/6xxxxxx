Miami-born and New York-bred, Sarabeth Tucek has come some way along the road of indie dues-paying, having sung back-ups on Smogâ€™s album Supper and appeared in notorious rock-doc DiG!. And it looked like she could cross over into a relative state of superstardom when she released her eponymous debut album in 2007, especially when a certain Bob Dylan popped up to express his admiration of the singer. Said Ethan Johns-produced set also found a fan in Laura Marling, who subsequently recruited the Brit Award nominee to work on her acclaimed I Speak Because I Can. However, things started to go awry, Tucekâ€™s life taking a turn for the worse.
For her second album Tucek elucidates these tribulations, chiefly those connected to her fatherâ€™s death, and explores related themes throughout the collection. It features moments of true beguilement, and referencing the greats â€“ a bit of Feist here, Throwing Muses there, along with touches of Karen Dalton, Cat Power and Linda Perhacs â€“ together with a musical menu of Neil Young, The Velvet Underground and even a dash of Big Star, helps to make Get Well Soon a marvel. It proves that through the hard times comes sweetness of a kind, a resolving of the personal Hell that is the loss of a parent. Despite its sombre influences, though, this is an earthy and oddly life-enhancing listen.

Opening with the delicate The Wound and the Bow, second track Wooden sets up the album properly as it bursts into life from gentle beginnings â€“ come its end, itâ€™s exuded a pre-concept-addled Pink Floyd rock-out warmth. State I Am In broods Breeders-like into classic Sister Lovers territory, while The Fireman is especially pleasing, Tucek recounting with touching detail a dream she had about her father: "The fireman saved many a home / But the fireman could not save his own." The closing title-track allows her to put some distance between so much grief â€“ the dislocation, pleading and real lifeâ€™s butting in â€“ and where she is today. It wraps up what must have been a dreadful couple of years, and bookends this collection perfectly.

There are around 20,000 records like this released every year by female troubadours. But thereâ€™s something just very right, and really quite splendid, about Get Well Soon. It could well prove to be a timeless little wonder.
