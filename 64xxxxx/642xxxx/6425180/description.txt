A couple of married guys are always looking at other women, treating their own wives like trash.
Their wives are fed up with their behavior, and grant them a 'hall pass': a week off their marriage
allowing them to do anything. But the guys take their time and their week is almost up. What they
don't realize is that at the same time their wives make connections of their own.
