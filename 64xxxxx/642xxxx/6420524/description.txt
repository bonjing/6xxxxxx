Brandon was an out-of-control drug addict, until his live intervention on the Dr. Phil stage led him down the path to sobriety. Now clean for five years, Brandon and his mother, Debbie, pay it forward with their company, Vital Intervention Professionals, by helping other families confront their loved ones about their destructive addictions. This time, three siblings reach out to Brandon and Debbie for help, desperate to save their three drug-addicted brothers: Sean, 28, Jordan, 24, and Logan, 23.
