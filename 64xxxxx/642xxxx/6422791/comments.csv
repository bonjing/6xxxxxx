,mdwalkman,2011-05-30T16:21Z,A big thanks. I've been really hoping someone would post this!!
,sam_smooth,2011-06-02T23:14Z,does anyone know where to find this as an audiobook?
,rellimmot,2011-06-15T13:32Z,"Was missing about 50 pages (came up as blank) on my particular download of it. Could be a shitty seeder out there, IDK.

Too bad I found out 40 pages into reading the book, gave up and just bought it from B&N."
,auscanadien,2012-01-14T02:17Z,"for whatever reason the second half of each chapter would be blank on my kindle. I opened the PDF on my computer and it was all there, so it did download correctly. I ended up opening it on my computer and saving as a text instead of a PDF and the text format worked fine on my kindle (with text I lost pictures).

 So far a great book thanks for the upload."
