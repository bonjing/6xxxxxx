                    This three-part documentary series follows the  
                    work of the Brahminy Group, run by Allan  
                    Brahminy, as it attempts to rehabilitate seven  
                    profoundly troubled young Aussie kids.   
                                                             
                     Following the assault, Allan Brahminy has no  
                     choice but to call in the police and stand down  
                     Roscoe. Bronte is desperate to talk to Allan but  
                     his attention is on Tim who has won his legal  
                     battle to return home. Derryan is caught  
                     stealing but there's a breakthrough with him.  
                     Not so with Zach who is refusing to open up  
                     completely to staff. The episode ends on a knife  
                     edge at a campsite as Bronte disappears into the  
                     night with a stranger
