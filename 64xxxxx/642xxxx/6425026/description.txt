Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTE: Today was odd in that they played no music or commercials between segments.  Almost like there was no producer there.  All I did was delete the silence (zero) so you all could hear the raw feed as it went over the air.  I even left in the "dead air" they send prior to their broadcast going out.  Hope you enjoy it.
