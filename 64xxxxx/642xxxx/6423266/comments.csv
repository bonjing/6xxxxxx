The Last Days of the Big Lie â€“ Second Draft

The Last Days of the Big Lie is a documentary which debunks the disgusting liars glorified as victims and heroes in the Steven Spielberg produced, Academy Award winning  Holocaust â€œdocumentaryâ€ hoax The Last Days.

The Last Days of the Big Lie uses Spielbergâ€™s hoax documentary as a jumping off point to expose his â€œUSC Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundationâ€ and the greater Holocaust myth.
