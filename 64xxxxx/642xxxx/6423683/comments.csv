,doser69,2011-05-26T06:38Z,"Another episode that made no sense.

Without a doubt, the 5 worst episodes of South Park ever made, all following one after the other...

I hope they sort it out.

I don't want to see South Park becoming as terrible as The Simpsons."
,patrickb04,2011-05-26T07:44Z,dude south park is genius. watch them all again and think about it. or go watch family guy for some cheap laughs. 
,patrickb04,2011-05-26T07:47Z,"dude south park is genius.
 watch them all again and think about it
 or if you want cheap laughs go watch family guy"
,PartyNerd,2011-05-26T08:53Z,You can always trust eztv for anything on the air! Thanks again!
,drcat123,2011-05-26T09:07Z,dude if you are looking for sense in it then let me tell you . You need to go read a book because south park is the cream of the crop went it comes to laughing . Only a few bad eps ever after the first season. First season was pure crap but it made it possible to have better eps . Worst ep ever was grasion trying to get his dad to do him . Watched it once then never again
,HankSedan,2011-05-26T09:25Z,"doser, SP has had some bad episodes this season but this one was OK.  It wasn't random.  It was referring (and somewhat racistly)  to college sports making $$$ off of athletes pretending to be students (communications majors) and also, possibly, to the Dutch Santa who kept midget African slaves, and who Dutch kids used to dress up as in blackface during Christmas (no joke)."
,Maddolis,2011-05-26T09:30Z,"I haven't watched this episode yet but doser69 knows what he's on about. I didn't mind s15e04 but the first three (and all but two of season 14) were pretty weak. It's taken a few seasons but I've gradually lost hope and am beginning to wish 15's the end.
The one where Garrison wants his dad to f* him (the brown note episode) is hilarious, at least three times as good as anything in the last 2 seasons."
,ridestowe,2011-05-26T09:46Z,"doser, what show have you been watching all these years? it sure wasnt southpark or else you'd realize these new ones are just like the last couple seasons' episodes"
,un13,2011-05-26T10:59Z,"I agree with doser69, i liked the 4th episode a little bit more then the others. I will give this a chance like I always give south park but i have my doubts on this one too.."
,pk147,2011-05-26T12:14Z,"come on guys south park is south park comment on the quality of the torrent no1 really cares if you like it or not..

thank you eztv"
,BazzinMan,2011-05-26T13:23Z,"why the h*ll did they take a dutch song from a dutch tradition, translated it into german and then use it in this episode. I'm dutch, but this was just wrong. 

nice episode though, liked the previous one better."
,RanY2jith,2011-05-26T15:38Z,"Doser69 is a faggot, the first 3 episodes were okay, the 4th and 5th are way better you assmaggot.

,pcsinfo,2011-05-26T16:49Z,"Another broken torrent, off to ishunt for a working tracker..."
,bzerk22,2011-05-26T17:31Z,"Is this torrent broken?

I can't seem to get any reaction from it, nor can i download the other s15e05 episodes here on TPB.

Any help would be appreciated. :)"
,gambler85,2011-05-26T17:35Z,Season 15 is gay!!! hate it
,Jahorse,2011-05-26T18:35Z,"Torrent worked fine for me. I think doser, un, and gambler must have below average penis sizes! It's ok guys, not all girls care..."
,Thalmen,2011-05-26T18:46Z,"didnt like the first eps in this season either, but last season was in my opinion one of the best. loved the kentucky eps"
,ljbew,2011-05-26T19:25Z,"WHO GIVES A FUCK WHAT EPISODE YOU LIKE..
D/L it & go to the next.  "
,herbigesmoke,2011-05-26T20:15Z,thanks again eztv team :)
,Yalper,2011-05-26T20:46Z,the best south park episode so far of this season ++
,BazzinMan,2011-05-26T20:48Z,"@hanksedan, get your facts straight. his name is sinterklaas and he has ""zwarte pieten"" (black peters) as helpers, they are NO midgets. they're helpfull and are known to be in good shape. also it is NOT during christmas, we also celebrate christmas, but sinterklaas evening is on the 5th of december, while his actual birthday is on the 6th. also the song in this ep is german! like wth..."
,kbowk2,2011-05-27T01:24Z,I watch every new south park episode and I think they are definately not as clever as they were from season 8 - 11.  Accept for dead celebrities none of the latest seasons have any episodes that I would call my favs.  My fav would definately be lil detectives from season 8 and season 11 as my fav season.  
,_Bagua,2011-05-27T01:33Z,Thanks great torrent! There's only one thing within the episode that is not correct.. Wunterschlaus or something like that isnt Dutch at all.. What they're saying isnt dutch either.. I can no that cause im dutch.
,kbowk2,2011-05-27T01:40Z,"I forogt about the shake weight and celebrity chief episode that was gold too.  PK147, obviously ppl care about if they like or dislike the new SP otherwise you wouldn't have ppl writing heaps of comments about it.  It's called a discussion.  And most ppl will know that eztv quality (including this episode) is......
A: 10
V: 10
Speedy download.  Was finished by the time I went for a smoke and came back.


Also, I used to be unable to download any eztv torrents, they always were broken for me while everyone else didnt have issues.  I have no idea how it fixed itself.  Maybe updating utorrent or something.  "
,DaNtsu,2011-05-27T18:05Z,"No one gives a shit about what you think of these episodes, sorry. 
Although this one is weird.

Thanks for the upload, is what i wanted to say.

,Marcuz1988,2011-05-27T19:07Z,hope this one is good like ep 4 that one was hilarious . this is legit eztv :)
,Marcuz1988,2011-05-27T20:13Z,worst ep of this 10 year
,Kaasbaas,2011-05-27T22:50Z,"Great to see a SP episode with so many Sinterklaas (aka ""wç«¯nter slash"") references. Too bad that the song sung by the parents of Clyde is actually in German. I don't think many people get the joke of that, as I people often ask me if I'm German when I speak or type Dutch on the internet. 

But that's kind of the joke."
,Kaasbaas,2011-05-27T22:51Z,"Excuse me on that, German speaking folks. It's mostly German, some stuff said is just made up."
,buchuphalia,2011-05-29T01:38Z,That episode was fucking AWESOME!  I lol'd so damn hard
,Sn0okk,2011-05-29T21:20Z,is this the episode about slash?
,DiCE1904,2011-05-31T06:32Z,"i thought it was funny as shit!

thanks again eztv! keep it SCUM"
,ltamake,2011-05-31T17:02Z,"This comment section is not for your personal critiques on the episode.

Thanks for the upload. :)"
,buchuphalia,2011-06-01T12:02Z,"Good upload.

Anyhow, poutine is fries, gravy and **cheese curds**!  I guess its just another part of the joke of constantly mis-representing Canadian stuff."
,Cheyenne-tgy,2011-11-14T20:20Z,thanks mate.
