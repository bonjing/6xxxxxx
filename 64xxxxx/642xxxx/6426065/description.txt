  Mac Roman, and Windows ANSI, and European.

FontXChange is designed to understand many different font formats and can convert fonts into many different formats. This makes FontXChange useful to:

* Convert PostScript Type 1 fonts (Macintosh or Windows format) into a 
  single modern OpenType font file that works on both Macintosh & 
  Windows. End the headaches of the outdated two-file system of screen
  font and printer font combinations. Just one font file that works.

* Recreate missing screen fonts using a PostScript font file in any format.

* Convert TrueType fonts to PostScript fonts. No more printing problems 
  and incompatibilities associated with TrueType fonts and high-end 
  output devices.

* Convert Windows fonts to Macintosh and vice-versa. Easily share fonts 
  across different computers, even different operating systems.
