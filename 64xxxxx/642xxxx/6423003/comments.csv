,deep92,2011-06-30T15:06Z,"I don't have the newest song, you can buy it for barely any money @ http://ephixa.com/album/zelda-step"
,deep92,2011-07-04T18:32Z,"When the 6th song is out I'll put song 4 to 6 up as well. If it's the 6th song is available, please throw me an E-mail @ crowding@gmail.com and I'll make sure to put it up straight away.

Please do support Ephixa by buying his music, it's good and most definitely worth buying it (I bought it as well)"
