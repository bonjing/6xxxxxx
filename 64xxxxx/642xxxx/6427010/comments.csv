,lettymc,2011-05-28T01:39Z,"Thanks for the effort.
For some reason you expect this movie to be good; why make a Red Riding Hood film if you don;t have something special planned. Bad acting, bad movie."

Thanks heaps , i can always count on you extremezone."
,Manderz,2011-06-14T19:55Z,"x3panda, it is because you need to download the AC3 codec. It'll fix it automatically."
,Manderz,2011-06-14T19:57Z,"@x3panda: 

You need the AC3 codec to hear sound on BRRips. "
,Manderz,2011-06-14T23:25Z,"Sorry about the double comments above. I can't figure out how to delete them. I just got through downloading the movie and I always skim through it immediately after to ensure that it works properly. So I wanted to go ahead and let everyone know that this DL is flawless!

Audio is perfectly in sync. And the video quality is beautiful.

,charyuop,2011-08-18T20:02Z,"It seem there is not a 6 ch copy with subtitles. I'll have to download this copy too and mix them up...lovely job with the bandwidth cap going on ;)
Let's kill the CAP!"
,Malasky,2011-09-04T21:01Z,"Thanks again Extreme. Superb audio and video quality, as always. 
@x3panda, most people use VLC to watch their movies. Try downloading that. (It's free anyway, so what's to lose?). I use Potplayer. It has all audio and video codecs built in, so no need to download extra codec packs. And it plays everything I've ever thrown at it. Nowt wrong with VLC. Just personal preference."
