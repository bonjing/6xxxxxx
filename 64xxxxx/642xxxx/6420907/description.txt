                             The Complete Series


The Event (typographically stylized THE EVÆŽNT) was an American television series containing elements of science fiction, action/adventure and political allegory.

Near the end of World War II, a craft of undetermined origin crashed in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska. It carried passengers who appeared outwardly human, but were eventually determined to be of extra-terrestrial origin. Their DNA is slightly less than one percent different from humans, and they age at a much slower rate. Ninety-seven of the survivors were captured by the U.S. government and held in a secret facility nearby, Mount Inostranka, run by intelligence agencies, since they have refused to disclose much about their origin. The remaining survivors, also known as the Sleepers, who only sustained minor injuries, were able to escape the crash scene and currently live among the population.

President Elias Martinez learns of the facility's existence shortly after his inauguration and decides, after meeting the leader of the detainees, to release them and disclose their existence to the world over the objections of the intelligence agencies. His plans are put on hold when an assassination attempt on him is foiled by means beyond human technology. The CIA realizes there are other aliens and secretly plans to find and detain them. Unknown to the agency, the agent chosen to head the effort is himself an alien. The aliens are divided internally on how to respond to this.

Caught in the middle of these events is Sean Walker, whose plans to propose to his girlfriend Leila on a Caribbean cruise are cut short when she mysteriously disappears from the ship. His investigation eventually leads him to uncover the assassination plot.
