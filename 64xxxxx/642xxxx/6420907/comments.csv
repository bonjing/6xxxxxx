,darklordvyper,2011-10-17T07:37Z,Don't bother downloading this. It's not HD. The video quality is terrible.
[V],manOtor,2011-10-17T23:21Z,"^^ Sure it is not HD.
The torrent is in ""TV-Shows"", not in ""High-Res TV Shows"".
Besides, the description says it all:
The codec is XviD/MP3 and the resolution is 624x352.

With the scene-rips the ""HDTV"" in the title of the AVI-files (and my torrents) means that the source it was ripped from was HDTV.

On quality :
From what I can tell -I just downloaded it and started seeding- 21 out of 22 episodes are of a standard 352p quality, which is fine by me. However the pilot, while technically 352p, is of a much lower quality (same resolution, poorer clarity). Perhaps because it appears to be your own rip and at the start you inserted a promo clip of yours that lowered the overall bitrate. This is a possible reason.

Great pack but I will get the pilot from elsewhere, no offence :)"
