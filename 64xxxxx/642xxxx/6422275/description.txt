A-PDF Content Splitter Service 1.7.0

A-PDF Content Splitter is a utility that lets you split Acrobat files into smaller pdf files based on location and text information within the files. It can be used to split composite PDF documents (such as invoices, reports or payroll) into separate files by keywords such as invoice number, account number or employee name. A command line version is included also.

Why A-PDF Content Splitter
Unique Split Function
The program provides an unique function that splits files based on content. It is extremely easy to split a PDF file into individual sections based on keywords.

It is ideal for large invoicing, reporting and payroll systems, where a single output file may contain many thousands of individual records that need to be extracted and distributed. Text within the document can be used to dynamically name output files and extracted to a delimited file for data storage.

Visual Rule Editor
A-PDF Content Splitter provides a power split rule editor to allow you define how the file will be split and how the split output files are uniquely named. You even can define and save multiple rules to apply to different files.
