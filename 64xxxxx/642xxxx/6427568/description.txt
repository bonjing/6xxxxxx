The Cave Singers is an American band from Seattle, Washington. Rising from the ashes of Pretty Girls Make Graves after its disbandment in 2007, former PGMG-member Derek Fudesco teamed up with Pete Quirk (of Hint Hint) and Marty Lund (of Cobra High) and began playing in the Seattle area. Soon after the band's conception, The Cave Singers signed with Matador Records on June 11, 2007. The band spent time recording in Vancouver with music engineer Colin Stewart, who quickly produced the band's first full-length LP

On August 18th 2009, The Cave Singers released their second album 'Welcome Joy', featuring guest appearances from Amber and Ashley Webber from Lightning Dust. 
Matador Records gave away a free download of one of the new tracks, 'Beach House' to fans.
