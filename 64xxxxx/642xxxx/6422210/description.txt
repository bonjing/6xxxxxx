Notes ....: IMDB lists it as an italian spoken movie but while directed and written 
            by italians, most of the main cast are american movie stars. Those movies 
            were released in Italy with the americans dubbed to Italian and in the US 
            with the italian actors dubbed to english. But still the official 
            languuage is english. The Blu-Ray doesn't even have an optional italian 
            audio like you'd usually get with releases that are dubbed.
