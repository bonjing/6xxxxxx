,MonJoh,2011-08-11T08:43Z,"I've just downloaded DVD 1 but can't seem to unrar it. Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 look empty (but are more than 1Go in size). And ""an error occurs"" when unraring pt 1. Any ideas? Suicide? Download again?"
,Soju123,2012-02-21T04:52Z,Has anyone lately downloaded a good copy of this torrent?  I DLed it and I received the same RAR error as Monjoh.
,Mutton,2012-06-13T06:58Z,"If you're having problems with un-RARing the file, I suspect that you're using something other than WinRAR. For some reason, 7-zip and others sometimes have problems handling split RARs. When that happens to me, using WinRAR instead has worked every time."
