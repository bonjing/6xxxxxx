The protagonists are three bounty hunters in search of a treasure that none of the three rogues can be reached without the help of the other two. Thus, the three men collaborating in appearance, but it's clear that ultimately will try to eliminate each other.
Leone and Eastwood are reunited for the third and last time in this classic film which shows, among other virtues, the expertise of a director and his struggle to overcome himself (...) An unforgettable western
