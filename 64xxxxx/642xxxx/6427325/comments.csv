[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-29T20:39Z,"If the game crashes try this one out -

I found a solution to this problem and it is relatively simple, sort out the mods you have for Sims 3. Some mods can really mess up the game, and with this expansion pack, it decides to crash due to those mods. The mods will most likely be updated at some point later after the game releases but until then you must remove those mods. If you have many mods, you could always sort them out to figure out which is the mod (or mods) that is causing the crashes. I really hope this helps you and anyone else with the exact same problem."

Those of you with sim interaction problems, etc, remove ALL of your custom content before installing the game. Keep it removed until you load the game to the main menu once, then quit the game, update your mods if they need it, and add your CC back to your game, then run the game again. It should work then."
,mjyumping2,2011-05-30T04:13Z,"@channidanni

yeah you are right. the cracks, installer are in the .iso file. To open .iso files you should get Daemon tools because .iso serves as a virtual DVD so you need virtual disc mounting software here: http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite
Mount the .iso file with that program. and look for the Virtual drive on your Explorer."
,channidanni,2011-05-30T04:41Z,@ mjyumping2  - I've already got a program to mount the .iso to a virtual drive which is how i got the regular sims and the other 3 expansion packs. what I'm saying is once I mount the .iso file to the drive do i need ANY OTHER files from any where else (and if so how can I get them) or can I just install the game like normal ??? Thanks.
,Wolverineeee,2011-05-30T05:16Z,Works fine on my macbook pro.  By know you should know how to crack but this one is a little different.  You have to go to the Base game folder instead of the Generations folder.  Copy and Paste and everything works.  I don't know if it's just this copy or the game itself but the files that are usually in the expansion pack folders are not there.  So don't be worried.  It can still be played.
,mjyumping2,2011-05-30T05:24Z,"@channidanni
Install the game normally. You dont need any other files from anywhere else. All the cracks are in the .iso. 
Note: Overwrite the cracks on The Sims 3 Base game folder, not on the generations folder. "" I know it is different but it is true."""
,channidanni,2011-05-30T05:52Z,"@mjyumping2

 LOL ok I've got all that. What I'm saying is I've had the same question for like a day and no one can answer me. I understand that I have to have a mounting program. I've got that. And I know where I have to put the cracks once I find them. BUT what I am asking is HOW do I extract the cracks from the .iso once I mount them to the virtual drive . Once I know how to get them from the .iso file I can take it from there."

,tede1982,2011-05-30T10:00Z,To all complaining of shitty crack + crashes. I guarantee in 99% of cases its because you aren't following the instructions and/or you are trying to run mods (especially core mods) which aren't designed for Generations! Remove all custom content and mods first - if it works - great! Then keep adding the custom content back until it crashes again.

Anyway,I have sorted the problem with the insert disk problem,but now I have a new one.  When I go to pick traits for my new sim it only has one.   

It might be that EA had a patch out and then withdrew it as there was some bugs,even with people not having generations they were able to install the patch that had all the extra stuff that came with the expansion pack(Like body hair ect.)  This might be why I am having these problems,only time will tell."

That way you should get the option to replace the files with the new ones.

Hope this helps."

The game installed, but half of my UI was missing and I couldn't control my Sim anymore. I had the loading screen and new objects, but I couldn't make my Sim do anything, and I couldn't use about half of the interface. After deleting Generations, my Sims no longer starts. I had to use Time Machine to restore my entire game, and now the family I had been using for the past 3 months is gone forever because that's the only way to make my game work. :( I'm sooo sad.

,Syd12345,2011-05-30T23:20Z,"I got a few glitches while playing this..

Ok so I am playing a legacy. I met a guy. Let's say this was Thornton Wolff. I talk to him for a while until we are good aquantices. While I am still talking to him, I save and get off. Then I get back on. Instead of the same friendship level that Thornton and I had before, it's just completely red (in the bubble) in the upper right corner. I look into my relationships and there is NO ONE IN THERE. (Before I saved, I had about 3 aquantices including Thornton and my boss) But my boss is still there.

Also another glitch. When I first started the legacy; my sim had a wish to join the Music career. I accepted it. Then I saved and got off. I didn't fulfill it yet. But then I came back on, and it had disappeared from my promised wishes. Then a wish popped up that said that she wants to join the Military career.

I have no idea what is up. Do you think that this is glitched somehow? Do you think it has something to do with my mods/CC?"

,dverarde,2011-05-31T17:08Z,"ok, I struggled with this after the first sims 3. here is what you have to do... start at the most recent release you have (IE World Adventures or whatever) uninstall that one... then reinstall it but don't crack it, because after you are done, you install generations... the major trick here is not to install the EA updater... it's garbage. A major suggestion for game installers as well, download a virtual CD/DVD drive like Daemon Tools lite or whatever you can find. Lastly, when it says put the crack in the bin folder for that game, it means go into the EA folder/Sims3/(Whichever is the latest release is). So if you install generations then something that was released before it, then you are still going to crack Generations because it was the last one released. Trust me, it will start and everything is useable... Hope that helps. email me if you have any other questions: dverarde@yahoo.com"

All my installed .Sims3packs were there, except for my Mods. I had about 300 or so CC.. that sucks. I don't know how to recover it though. I don't know if it was deleted or overwritten. :/

But anyways. After I reinstalled both games, and updated them, I cracked it. I started it through the launcher. And this is what I got: ""It looks like you have installed an unofficial game modification that does not match your current version of The Sims 3. We recommend that you either ninstall these game modifications or get updated versions of them - otherwise you may experience crashes or significant bugs. Do you want to quit?"" (There's a quit or continue button; i'm going to press continue and see what happens)

,dianalov3,2011-06-01T22:03Z,"@Boikotoi
I had all the other pirated Sims installed & I used the launcher. However, when I started the game again today, it prompted me for yet another new update. I did not accept that one, not worth the risk. :)"
,arata75,2011-06-01T23:11Z,"Okay, this didn't work correctly for me. Here's what happened.

The first time I tried to install, it said that it needed to update the base game, and I let it. However, a few minutes later it gave me a message telling me that the update FAILED and that the install could not continue. So I closed the installer.

The second time I tried to install, it did not give me any message about updating the base game. It just installed as usual. 

I copied the crack to the base game folder like everyone says. I found it a bit odd, since every other expansion pack's crack is put into the expansion pack's sub-directory. But I did it anyway.

So I start the game and it loads, but it looks like it has messed up my game. Very buggy. First of all, the loading screen is distorted. It doesn't show the artwork or animation for the expansion pack, just a black screen and the loading bar.

So then I uninstall and then reinstall the Generations expansion pack to see if that will fix the problem. It doesn't; the loading screen is still messed up. But I continue anyway into the game.

Then when I go into Create-a-Sim, there are two new traits whose icons are showing but there are no descriptions. So I have no idea what these traits are or if they even work properly.

At that point I shut down the game and here I am. Not sure what to do at this point. Since I had to write over the base game's crack, I'm not sure if uninstalling this version of Generations will return my game back to normal. I'm pretty sure I'll have to go back and uninstall everything and reinstall them again.

I know some people are saying that this version is working perfectly, but I would stay away from it. The problem seems to stem from the fact that the base game failed to update correctly when installing Generations. Plus, the fact that the crack is for the base game and not the expansion itself complicates the issue, making the whole thing messier if it doesn't install correctly.

tl;dr - My advice would be to wait for another cracked version of this game which cracks the expansion itself and not the base game. Saves a whole lot of trouble."
,Crystal9930,2011-06-02T02:54Z,"First and foremost for all who have expansion packs and are updating their games. You must make sure you have the original files from the crack in order to update or else you will get an error. Second, you replace the .exe in the base game folder.

I could pause, but not direct my sims to do anything or check their motives. Upon going into Edit Town, sometimes (but not always), I can actually fully access it, but other times it just does a zoom-out of the town and stays there without showing the interface. After deciding to start a new town, I moved in a few sims using edit town. It just stayed at ""Processing"", still loading, not frozen, but not doing anything either. If I move sims in using the active household deal, they sometimes work fine and I can play with them, but occasionally when going into the game it'll just stick at neighborhood view, not show an interface or loading screen, and not go anywhere. My game is not protected by DEP because I had CTD issues before, and I've removed all of my custom content and still encounter the problem. I'd also like to add that when I have NRass's Overwatch running, it tells me that every single sim in Sunset Valley has a script error, and resetsim * does not fix the problem. Help! Please! D: It's amazing what I go through to play this game..."

,jannickv,2011-06-02T22:33Z,"Hi Chris!

I'm A Mac user and i gave this torrent a go, works great for me! To Thank you i wrote a small manual how to crack it on Mac

First you have to locate your the sims program folder. In this folder you'll see your original ""The Sims 3"" program and a link to the generations program. To crack the program you have to go inside the ORIGINAL program.

Right mouseclick on the ORIGINAL The Sims 3.
> Show package contents.
> Open contents folder.
> Open Resources.
> Open transgaming.
> Open c_drive.
> Open Program Files.
> Open Electronic Arts.
> Open The Sims 3.
> Open Game.
> Open Bin.

Paste the cracked files here. then close the window and click the shortcut to the generations pack :D you can game now. Have fun!"

What you need to do is put both crack files included with this into the Bin folder of Sims 3 Generations.

After that, place only the TS3W file into the Bin folder of the Sims 3 base game.

It will give you a message saying you have mods and just click continue. Took me many hours to figure out.

,kakatriibumees123,2011-06-04T21:01Z,"The game installed nicely but there are tons of bugs. For example, my sims wake up at random times and I have to put them to sleep about 10 times before the energy bar fills up. And they don't just get out of the bed, they like teleport. That's just pretty annoying, but there are some things that make the game almoust unplayable. For example, my sims just don't go to work anymore. They go to the lot but don't enter the building or anything. Same thing with elevators. No more lounges for me, I guess. And I almost forgot the car bug - they go to a lot with they're own car, but the car doesn't appear in a parking space or in the inventory, it just stays on the road. Since the car is not ""parked"" the sims don't understand that they have arrived on the lot. Anybody else having these problems?"

Windows users!

1. Download the game and make sure you have The Sims 3 installed. If u don't have The Sims 3 this will not work.
2. When the game is downloaded, open the iso file with Daemon tools. Then u just install it. If you cant install the game with daemon tools then do this. Open the game with Daemon tools then go to My Computer then open either E: or F: or D: and the game should be there, then click on setup and install the game.
3. Now when the game wants a serial key go to My computer then open E: F: or D:(where the sims 3 Generations disc is located) then open the crack folder and open the sims 3 keygen thing and generate a key.
4. When you have installed the game you need to crack it. Go to My computer then F: E: or D:(where sims 3 generations disc is located) then open the crackfolder and copy the one file that ends with .exe and paste it into C:/program(program files)/EA Games/The sims 3 Generations/Bin. Put the crack in there and if it asks you to overwrite the file then click YES!.
5. Now it is all done. All you need to do is to open the game with the launcher in the sims 3 generations installation folder which is C:/program(program files)/EA games/The sims 3 Generations/Bin. Open the file called launcher(it is called something like that) and play the game.

Hope it works!!! :)
I havent downloaded it yet but i know from the previous game i downloaded from Reloaded (The sims 3 Ambitions) and the instructions were like this. 

If the game doesn't work try to put it together with the sims 3 game in C: not in the other ones like D: or E: or the other ones. :D"

,bloedeter,2011-06-13T21:08Z,"Works perfectly. Didnt download it at first because I was afraid it didn't work becuz of all the negative reply's, but it does work! Also, you don't have to unrar anything cuz theres only an iso file. For all the people using torrents for the first time, and I'm surprised there are still so many, you need deamon tools or something like that to make it work. Theres a crack folder included with a keygen, so all you have to do is when you've mounted it, just rightclick on the drive in my computer and choose explore. Then you will easily find the keygen and crack. Looking at all the comments, it looks like its not compatible with all mods, but I don't really use mods so I didn't have any problem with it at all. I have all expansion packs now. Kthxbb"
,kriscee,2011-06-13T22:03Z,"OK FOR EVERYONE WHOS HAVING THAT ERROR PROMBLEM it looks like you have installed an unofficial game modification that does not match with your current version of the sims 3."" then it tells me to either uninstall the it or get updates
 I CONTACTED EA AND THEY SAID DOWNLOAD THIS TO FIX THE PROMBLEM The patch will ask you where you want the patch to be applied and you'll need to point it to the base game Sims 3 app file, if you choose any expansion pack instead of base game then it might get you in trouble while patching as per the new patching system only base game needs to be patched and further patches for expansions will be skipped and this will also resolve your issue of ""Base Game is incompatible with the expansion pack"" error which was occuring before with the old patching system.

,Kellyvl,2011-06-14T19:29Z,"@ MAC USERS

This Works Great on Mac!! :-) I've got no errors at all! :D

I Used this installation comment on an other page;

I'm A Mac user and i gave this torrent a go, works great for me! To Thank you i wrote a small manual how to crack it on Mac

First you have to locate your the sims program folder. In this folder you'll see your original ""The Sims 3"" program and a link to the generations program. To crack the program you have to go inside the ORIGINAL program.

Right mouseclick on the ORIGINAL The Sims 3.
> Show package contents.
> Open contents folder.
> Open Resources.
> Open transgaming.
> Open c_drive.
> Open Program Files.
> Open Electronic Arts.
> Open The Sims 3.
> Open Game.
> Open Bin.

Paste the cracked files here. then close the window and click the shortcut to the generations pack :D you can game now. Have fun!"
,amebamalek,2011-06-14T21:35Z,"Kellyvl, did you update your game before or after applying the crack? Or not at all?

nofear2161, I read somewhere it was the patch. Someone suggested reinstalling everything, applying only the generations crack at the end, but NOT updating the game when it requests you to do it. I haven't tried it though, since despite the warning my game works fine. I figure new patches will come out eventually. *shrug*"
,amebamalek,2011-06-14T22:31Z,"I'm such a masoquist.

Uninstalled everything, installed everything again: sims 3, world adventures, ambitions, late night, generations. Added the generations crack at the end. Opened game and clicked NO when asked to update, twice. Works fine now, no warnings whatsoever.

nofear2161, give it a try and let me know!"

Install Sims3 original. Den launch the gamelauncher and update the game to 1.22.9 (as of 17june)
Den go install whatever expansion u want. Update if they request too.

Finally, go to gamecopyworld.com and download the respective no-dvd patch (for this case, v1.22.9). And just paste the content into the game\bin folder. Rmb to save the originals so that u can update in the future!
*Note: as of v1.22.9, u only need to crack the TS3W.exe and TSLHost.dll in the main sims 3 folder. Oh ya and rmb to dismount ur sims3 from DaemonTools

ENJOY FELLAS!"

[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-06-23T19:18Z,"Now people , read these instructions , if they dont help , then you should buy the game.

1. mount it using PowerISO ( Or any other similar program ) then copy the crack to:
D:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin

not on D:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Generations\Game\Bin so that it wont require for a CD to be played...

2. Here are some key's if some people can't find the Keygen
W5BK-YKVK-48WW-848W-ZRLD
HXZR-L748-G4H6-BG4H-ARLD
EQHZ-3U2K-NK65-3NK6-9RLD

3. Be sure that you DONT have ANY MODS or similar stuff added in main SIMS 3 , this expansion might not work then. Delete all mods etc.. and then go install Generations.

4. You need first to download the MAIN SIMS 3 GAME , like this one - https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5022393/The_Sims_3_-_Razor1911_Final_MAXSPEED
Then you can install all other expansions like generations , ambitions , medieval , etc....

5. Getting it to work with MAC OSX IMPORTANT !!

MAC OSX.

Install the expansion first, then go to Applications > The Sims 3 > Right Click The Sims 3.app and choose 'Show Package Contents' > Contents > Resources > Transgaming > C_Drive > Program Files > Electronic Arts > The Sims 3 > Game > Bin > Replace TS3W.exe and TSLHost.dll with the files from the Crack folder, located on the .iso

Important Note:
- You HAVE to copy the crack folder off the mounted disk to be able to use the files.

i would try running ts3 then and there. but no.
it was not cracked. so yeah. i just reinstalled ts3 generations. at this point i t never autoupdated. since i had patched ts3 to 1.22.9
after installing ts3 gen. i cracked it using the crack included here. then launched the game using sim launcher. that's when the app froze. so i figured out. i will launch this using the TS304.exe found on ts3 gen install directory. yes. life is shit without crack"

,anakayy,2011-08-04T21:13Z,"Hey not to sound like an idiot, but where can I find the most recent patches for this? Just dl'd this a few days ago, and it works for the most part but it always crashes after I've been playing for a while. As far as I can tell it's not related to any in-game actions or specific objects, and I haven't added any mods so it's not a conflict there, either. I'm pretty sure it just needs patched. Anyone else have this problem/ can you tell me how to fix it?"
,anakayy,2011-08-04T21:14Z,"And on that note, if you can't help me that's fine because I intend to buy the legit version of this in a couple of weeks. Just wanted to try it out first to make sure it's worth the money. (:"
,Sidderson49,2011-08-05T01:05Z,Everyone asking why they can't install when it says  you need Sims3  WELL DUH this is an EXPANSION pack just like it says.  To load it you need to buy or down load he the Sims 3 regular game.  The message you got was pretty self explanitory.  DOH!!  lol
,Sidderson49,2011-08-05T01:08Z,Anakkay first off you can get the patches from their website.  Secondly you don't want to install patches because the crack was for the current version you have.  IF you install the patches you'll find the second you load the game it'll stop working.  So unless you find a crack for the version of the patch don't so it.  Or first find out the version of the patch THEN go to www.meagagames.com and look for a crack of that version of the patch.  If there isn't one don't install it.
,anakayy,2011-08-05T20:44Z,"@Sidderson49- Do you know what's with the crashing then, or how I can fix it? "
,longlivepirates,2011-08-06T22:43Z,come on. please seed. take forever to download....
,JonMcGuirk,2011-08-07T10:27Z,"Anakkay - the very latest patch is 1.24, and you can find it here:  
http://www.simprograms.com/the-sims/the-sims-3/the-sims-3-patches/patches-the-sims-3/

If you don't have any mods or custom content, then the crashing might be game or computer related. Make SURE that your graphics card is updated to the latest, and if you have an Nvidia card, try playing with VSync on AND off (some people have issues with it) and see if the crashing stops with one setting or the other.  And yeah, if you update your patch (which you really always should), make sure you have a crack for that patch version.

Crashing problems with a mod-free/custom content-free game are usually an issue of a patch, bad install, or computer update (some people have success just with defragging alone)."

,pyre852,2011-08-12T04:08Z,"All right, so I've downloaded the original game and all the expansion packs from various torrents on TPB and they all work fine, except this one. I installed it, ran the keygen and everything perfectly fine. Then when I went to copy the crack into the bin dir, the two original copies of the two files I was copying in weren't present in the folder, so there was nothing to overwrite. I pasted the crack in anyway, cause I thought, what the hell, shouldn't make any difference right?

Only when I go to run the game, once I get to the select-a-neighbourhood/family screen it tells me it wasn't able to verify my game or something like that and closes me out. I figure this has something to do with the fact that the original files weren't there and weren't actually replaced by the cracked file. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the expansion but that didn't work either.

So what's the deal? Am I just copying the crack to the wrong spot? I don't think I am, since I copied it to the same spot (Game>Bin) as the other expansions and this isn't my first rodeo; I've pirated many games before without any problem. I also noticed that this game folder doesn't have nearly as many folders, executables and other various icons as the other expansions did. Was my download/install just corrupted? I was going to try uninstalling, deleting and redownloading it next but I'll hold off and see if anyone has any other suggestions."

Granted you have to know how to add a package to the game (everything is there on Nrass, and I only point to them because he has great mods.).  Works on any sims combinations of games and packs.  Best is you can still use the launcher to install free or pirated content, or pay for content, and it updates! (Though if a serious player go to ""Mod the sims"" and get the updater program, better than EA.)

You just don't launch the game from the launcher only the above direct shortcut."

The problem is that, when you copy the crack, you're not supposed to copy it (idk why) to the last expansion you installed, you're supposed to copy it to the main game (Sims 3). And, if you look closely, the crack icon isn't the expansion icon, it's the Sims 3 icon.

make sure you put the crack in the SIMS 3 FOLDER.  Not the SIMS 3 GENERATIONS FOLDER.  They are two different folders in your Electronic Arts folder in your C-DRIVE.  So make sure you're putting the crack in the sims 3 folder and not the generations folder."

ive got a problem - ive downloaded it since now 3 months and it worked fine - well now since 3 weeks it starts to do some things bizarre.... like suddenly all of the neighbours start to stay all in one play because one has died and the all look at him - and the sims do to get older any more... so that means even if i changed the option aging on and off it still did not work. to solve this problem i just deleted this neighborhood and then my screen turned blue and said like softwarebrakedown - and now i cant play for more than five min without a brakedown.... has anybody a clue what could be wrong?

I've done everything perfectly, according to the instructions: Install every expansion in the right order, patch every one of them just right after installation.
Then I dragged TS3W and TSLHost.dll to the Bin folder in the Basic game folder (the plain TS3).

AND IT SAYS IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE AN UNORIGINAL COPY OF THE GAME. Well spotted by the way. 

That's the second time I've installed all the packs, and I have no soul to do this anymore. Unless someone will kindly respond to me, what the fudge is wrong with this shit?

,holyheart,2011-10-24T11:23Z,"To people who have problems playing this game.

To patching problems, you need to manual patch the game, look up the sims 3 patch notes to find all the patches for all games, then google up a crack and the manual patch for your system, i recommend googling Modthesims patch table.

For macintosh users, make sure theres an ISO file inside, this helps with in installation and allows you to use it.

RELOADED expansions usually contain iso's and stuff, All expansions work with MAC and PC.

This should help, system requirements arent really that important.

And youre done, you can install custom stuff with the reloaded files as well.

Comment if you have probs."

,BobbyManning,2011-11-08T14:19Z,"I made an account to say this is my second time downloading this game (I broke my laptop so I needed to redownload it for a desktop) and my download speed does not go under 786 kB/s, and doesn't go over 925 kB/s. In other words, for the size of the iso. (1267 pieces) very fast.

Now to help people confused with downloading this onto The Sims 3 Base Game.

*STEP ONE*: 
Download with uTorrent/BitTorret.

*STEP TWO*: 
Use DAEMON TOOLS LITE ( http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite ) and mount the only iso. file in the torrent ( rld-s3gn.iso )

*STEP THREE*:
If the iso. does not automatically load then go to computer, then ""Devices with removal storage"" it should be called ""Sims3EP04."" Double click it and the setup should start.

*STEP FOUR*:
When a serial number is requested, you go back to computer and ""Devices with removal storage"" and right-click ""Sims3EP04"", then click ""open"" or ""explore"" then find the Crack folder. Within this Crack folder you will find the keygen. Generate serial code, and enter it into the setup of The Sims 3 Generations. If first code does not work just generate again.

*STEP FIVE*:
Wait for download to finish. When download is complete, if you have already downloaded another expansion pack for The Sims 3 Base Game with a crack, you can just continue on and play. If you you can find the crack in the ""Sims3EP04"" Crack folder, right click the icon that looks like the ""Sims3EP04"" icon (The one you right clicked to find the crack folder, hence, the thing you right click in computer and ""Devices with removal storage"") and copy it. Go back to computer and double-click the (C:) File in the ""Hardware Disk Drive"", go into ""Program Files"" then ""Electronic Arts"" and go into The Sims 3 folder NOT The Sims 3 Generations folder. Go into the folder and open the folder named ""Game"" and then ""Bin"". Paste the crack file in there. When it asks if you want to copy and replace or keep both files, click copy and replace.

*STEP SIX*:
Go open The Sims 3 launcher, whichever you please and it should show at the bottom that you have installed The Sims 3 Generations.

Hope that was detailed enough, or not too overly detailed.. :D"

,aeristilheartly,2012-05-22T21:53Z,"ALRIGHT listen up here people who are having problems, this is what you do!!!!

Make sure you have DAEMON TOOLS!
This is what you mount to, you can download Daemon Tools Lite for FREE at the download website.


Unrar/unzip everything and mount into your daemon tools when instructed.
Some DO NOT NEED DAEMON TOOLS!  In this case, just open the SETUP application and run it.


Install in THIS order.


!!!!!!!DO NOT CRACK ANYTHING!!!!!!!!

THIS IS KEY! 

If you crack ANYTHING during your installs you will make it so NONE of them work and you might even have problems REMOVING them as they won't even UNINSTALL correctly


UPDATE WHEN ASKED
it won't hurt and you cannot move on unless you allow the update in EACH install!
