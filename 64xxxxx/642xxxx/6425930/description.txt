Blue Murder is a docudrama based on the real life story surrounding Roger Rogerson (Richard Roxburgh), one of his associates Neddy Smith (Tony Martin), and an honest cop, Michael Drury (Steve Baston). This two part series was produced in 1995, but could not be seen in NSW because Neddy Smith was still awaiting trial. This is a brutal and disturbing story - the characters portrayed are sadistic and cold-blooded murderers. 

The screenplay and acting are very good and draw you into a world that you really don't want to be a part of. We follow the activities of the corrupt police as they exchange money and favours for protection from prosecutions. They basically have unlimited power, and the result is as you would expect, corruption. Smith flourishes under this protection, basically operating outside the law without any fear of reprisals. The story builds towards a climax where they cross paths with an honest police officer, Drury. Drury gets in their way, and so they decide to kill him. This was the trigger that led to their downfall and the attempted clean-up of the NSW police force. If this was a movie, there would be moments when you would think that they had gone too far in their portrayal of the brutality. When you remember that most of this is based on reality, it leaves you with a feeling of cold dread.
