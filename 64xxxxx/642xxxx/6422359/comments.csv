I have therefore uploaded this movie on TPB. (dctorrent guys will be crying hereafter). They are the ones who share only for a price. Shame on you, guys. I will seed whenever I can. Please download this file, make your own torrents and help spread Indian movies on/viaTPB. Cheers. "
,LucasOnSong,2011-05-25T17:23Z,I have encoded this movie painstakingly. But there is always room for improvement. After downloading please comment on A/V quality. I will look forward to your response.
,LucasOnSong,2011-05-25T17:35Z,"Video: Xvid 528x384 29.97fps 1105Kbps
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128Kbps

I have tried to get it rendered flawlessly. But there is always room for improvement. Please comment on A/V quality. Cheers."

,Amirphp,2011-06-11T13:24Z,seed it..am stuck on 97%
,LucasOnSong,2011-06-16T12:41Z,"Hi, Amirphp. Hope you've completed downloading. Do let me know if you're still stuck. Seeding, though, seems ok, now. If possible, make your own torrent so that more people like you can share. Cheers."
,Amirphp,2011-06-16T15:59Z,"sorry bro i have removed that download...after requesting many times...i think u will busy and no one will seed.
Please seed again if u can...i am again starting.
Thanks."
,LucasOnSong,2011-06-17T06:54Z,"Ok, Amirphp. I have been seeding and I implore you to download it as soon as you can and not remove it this time. I can not seed all the time. So, complete your download this time. Also, if you are interested in the movie Shutter Island you can find it here on TPB or just google Shutter Island LucasOnSong. It is a superb thriller with English subtitles. You will find many seeders for that movie.

Wish you luck with Kala Bazar. Just don't give up and keep me posted. Cheers.
