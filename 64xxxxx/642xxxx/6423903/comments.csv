,nemosrings,2012-05-13T01:05Z,"Thanks seeders! :)
Easy, just click the Generate button, double-click the serial to copy it and paste into DR's reg. with name Keymaker. "
,nemosrings,2012-05-13T01:07Z,"BTW Disk Drill is also vg. So if DR does not get back what you want, try an alternative."
,nemosrings,2012-05-13T06:36Z,"At least Disk Drill can recover files from your user account on the system drive, Data Rescue cannot. So much for having a user account work space on the system drive. I rarely use it but ... on this rare occasion and now ..."
,freelancer1011,2012-06-08T16:13Z,"What an absolute legend. Man i can't tell you how grateful i am. I have had this harddrive sitting here for about 7 months. Tried downloading programs none worked - forget trying to buy software that may or maynot work.
Great big shout out.
Cheers brother."
