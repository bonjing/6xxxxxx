,69mort69,2011-05-25T17:08Z,"So I got it all installed, but when I try to run it, it says Terraria has stopped working, and then makes me close the program... any idea why?
Btw, very fast download."
,lipslide,2011-05-25T17:27Z,It's a virus..(trojan horse)
,miguelsz3,2011-05-25T17:30Z,Have you installed Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 and Micro$oft.NET Framework 4? It should work properly if there installed; Otherwise I dont know...... Sorry.
,dzuwno,2011-05-25T17:32Z,It is true with this Virus :D Jesus i dont know how to thank you! :D Now MP works without any problems!!!1
,Dreamsnake,2011-05-25T19:49Z,"Hamachi: terraria xx    (small letters)

,miguelsz3,2011-05-25T20:07Z," The hell?..... 
1.) Read the description, I just told you that you would get a false positive.

2.) Multiplayer doesnt require anything special you can connect to Official Servers from the Terraria Forums.  

3.) Hamachi is not required for Cracked Version but if you prefer Hamachi then go ahead."
,Mr.Flarnet,2011-05-25T22:20Z,"Is Multiplayer working? And if it does, how do I create and join one?"
,Mr.Flarnet,2011-05-25T22:51Z,"My download isn't starting....... 

Is it possible to play online together with different versions?"
,mikeyone77,2011-05-26T01:13Z,"works perfect, I did get a false positive but i just turned off my active guard for my anti virus instelled the game removed all the installing files and no longer get the detection. thanks alot!"
,m4st4w1ll,2011-05-26T03:14Z,Installed Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 and worked perfect.  It's legit.
,izz1496,2011-05-26T04:11Z,Wtf? It gives you 1 file and its a CRACKED-THETA File? What the heck do you use to open those? I thought it was just going to be a .exe program. What to do?
,izz1496,2011-05-26T04:20Z,"Yeah theres no installer bro, just a cracked theta file that needs to be opened with something"
,miguelsz3,2011-05-26T04:38Z,"FOR THE LAST TIME, MULTIPLAYER WORKS... all you need is the IP address of a server to play. Goto ""terrariaonline"" to get the list of servers you can join.

@izz1496
....... Download Winrar or 7zip and then extract the file."
,miguelsz3,2011-05-26T05:17Z,"@izz1496 
Ahem......
Once you extract ""Terraria.v1.0.2.cracked-THETA"" you have to go to the extracted folder and extract ""T-terra3"" and within that folder will be Terraria.Exe run it and it will open the Installer..... Im sure you'll know what to do after that =-="
,Happyworm360,2011-05-26T10:40Z,"You should probably put a readme or NFO file with instructions inside. Some people are new to torrents, and have no idea what they are doing.

I did what you said, but winrar comes up with this error message when I try to open terraria.exe: !   Cannot execute ""C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\Rar$EX41.075\Terraria.exe""
. Help?"
,ThePirateMachine,2011-05-26T11:00Z,"is terraria vista friendly? works fine for my xp desktop but when i open using my visya, it says ""terraria has stopped running"". any help?"
,miguelsz3,2011-05-26T14:12Z,"@ThePirateMachine 
Yes it's vista friendly.... as to how I know, it's becuase im running Vista 32-bit Basic. Im pretty sure in order to fix your issue you should download and install Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 and/or Microsoft.NET Framework 4

@Happyworm
.... Well I could be a number of things.... but I'll go with some simple solutions.... 

1.) Right-Click the file and choose ""extract to"" and it will extract it into the same folder.

2.) If that didn't help Right-Click the rar file and at the bottom there will be a security tab that says ""this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer"" and click unblock.

3.)If that didnt help try extracting it with 7zip..

4.) Final solution and your on your own (sorry) check if you have any malware on your computer as that might be an issue"

,ryuzaky7,2011-05-28T10:34Z,how to connect to a server? cuz is not working in what servers i can enter? plz someone give me an ip from a server i can enter plz!!!!!
,miguelsz3,2011-05-28T11:11Z,"Well there are plenty of servers out there problem is some of them dont work worth a damn.... I know I've tried. 

Go here it requires a bit of trial and error though

P.S.
This server seemed to work for me try it
24.201.195.189 "
,death544,2011-05-28T17:20Z,"Well I'm a bit hesitant saying one person is all it takes to say there's a virus, also, maybe you should put more info like the update features, etc. Just to make it seem more safe."
,death544,2011-05-28T17:36Z,"Cant play. Encounters a problem, i havent pirated in a while, any help?"
,miguelsz3,2011-05-28T20:06Z,".....Well, gotta tell me your problem first?

P.S.
Nice tip I'll use that for later then, eh?"
,No-Vacancy,2011-05-28T22:00Z,"My Terraria keeps crashing when I try to connect to a server. 
Am I making a mistake or something ?"
,miguelsz3,2011-05-28T23:53Z," Well, there seem's to be a bug which causes the game to crash whenever joining Multiplayer. Though there's not much you can do.... Of course I hear you can try to host your own server for you and a few friends, that might fix the issue....

 Oh and I did a bit of research and it appears that the crash mostly effects user's who have their Windows Display Language set on a Non-English language specifically French."
,AtlasSys,2011-05-29T13:19Z,"im having problems with running the .exe, its just chrases. i have windows 7 ultimate 32.bit Know any help?"
,miguelsz3,2011-05-29T15:53Z,"@AtlasSys
As far as I know in order to fix the crash on start up you have to install Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0."
,ncc46537,2011-05-30T01:45Z,"Legit release, virus is a false-positive, which IS due to the installer, game works fine.
I run with no anti-virus software other than Windows Security Essentials, and I have never had a virus from anything I've downloaded from TPB.
To fix crash issues, restart computer after downloading these, and it should work. Otherwise it is a hardware conflict, and is your problem.
