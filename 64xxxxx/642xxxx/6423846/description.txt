This single-disc selection from Yazoo is interesting because it bypasses some of Charley Patton's best-known sides like "Down the Dirt Road Blues" and "High Sheriff Blues" in favor of presenting a more versatile Patton capable of handling gospel and even pop fare (check out the take here of "Some Summer Day" to hear a relatively softer and gentler Charley Patton). Since Patton's rhythms and overall approach can be repetitive at times, a single disc like Primeval Blues, Rags and Gospel Songs that mixes things up a bit makes a perfect introduction for casual listeners, but Patton's recorded work is both the Big Bang and the epicenter of country-blues, so going a little deeper and springing for one of the several fine box sets available is well worth the time and expense. 

Charley Patton (vocals, guitar); Willie Brown (guitar); Bertha Lee (vocals); Henry "Son" Sims (fiddle).
