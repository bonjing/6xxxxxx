I am looking forward for this download. and by looking at your current active torrents, (C)hallenge (O)f (R)everse (E)ngineering is working well for you guys. however, I would like to give you a challenge of my own. there is a torrent of a VERY famous software called Pro Tools (9 being the latest version) which people are eagerly waiting for it to be cracked, on the PC version... here is the link... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6277391
