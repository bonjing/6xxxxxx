The C2C Live shows with Ian Punnett are missing in the Demonoid torrents.
I downloaded every MP3 I could find on the C2C website and left the original filenames.
The files are not tampered by any player software.
(Windows Media Player likes to write into the files!)
Also I used the show descriptions from C2C's website for my own HTML's."

awakening the people.
