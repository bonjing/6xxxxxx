,SeedlessGrape,2012-01-20T05:57Z,"If you want to read this on an iPhone i'll explain.  

1)  In iTunes click on preferences and check ""show books""
2)  Then drag the pdf file into iTunes on the left hand side where it says ""books"" underneath podcasts.
3)  When your iPhone is connected make sure sync books is checked.
4)  Download iBooks by Apple for free in the app store on your phone

Enjoy :)"
