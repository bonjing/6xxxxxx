Rance Allen Group - The Live Experience - DivX


This live album from singing tour de force Rance Allen and his brothers Tom and Steve Allen epitomizes the power and grandeur of gospel music. While closely allied with soul and R&B, each tune on THE LIVE EXPERIENCE is ultimately centered on a Christian theme. Recorded at the Greater Grace Temple in Detroit, this album features fellow gospel crooners Kirk Franklin, LaShun Pace, and Fred Hammond. Moreover, a smoking-hot horn section (performing arrangements by Lloyd Barry) accompanies the funky rhythm section.

On THE LIVE EXPERIENCE, the Allen brothers sing a mixture of new and classic material. The group's R&B hit "I Belong to You" is particularly inspired. This track includes smooth vocal harmonies, jazzy chords, and sudden punctuations from the brass section. "Something About the Name Jesus" is a newer tune that focuses on the ascendancy of Christ. On this piece, Franklin preaches over the mellow doo-wop stylings of the brothers Allen. This concert recording offers 13 electrifying tracks for fans of R&B-flavored gospel. It also proves that Rance Allen and company still have what it takes to really charm audiences.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.

RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)

This is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.
