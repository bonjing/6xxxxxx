Quote:

Forget about the proposed ban by the Thai Culture Ministry, forget about the "Reya Fever", forget about the argument that increasing the TV program rating of this lakorn from PG-13 to PG-18 will do nothing even if you give this lakorn a rating of PG-50, kids will still watch it because Thais don't take TV program rating seriously. I'm talking about the lakorn "Dok Som See Tong (Golden Orange Blossom)" Starring Chompoo Araya Hagate as the overly ambitious, overly sexual social climber Reya. It's getting a lot of buzz for its risque love scenes, inappropriate behavior by the main character Reya who is sleeping her way to the top and being everyone's "mia noi (mistress)".
