,TheFesta,2011-06-16T10:31Z, Can i just point out to pirate bayers that i just downloaded a 4.6gb wii iso- compressed to under 650mb and it all work'd fine! Wouldnt this kind of compression make it easier for all involved up'lding & dwn'lding on torrent sites : )
,bainzy,2011-06-17T21:58Z,@TheFesta: how did you manage to compress the file to that small a size? what did you use?
[T],Tiimb0,2011-06-23T14:57Z,"@TheFesta @Bainzy He means the wbfs file the WBFS file is many times much smaller than all the ISO's but the uploaders upload the ISO so it's easier to burn them to a disc ;)

@Chris-Aksel Thanks gonna try this one ;)"
