,Al3xXx666,2011-09-04T23:56Z,"Is This 28 Days Later + 28 Weeks Later, Or Just 28 Days Later?
And How's The Quality? TY."
,agmobb,2011-09-15T11:11Z,"The quality is not very good but that is because of the way it was originally shot. That being said, it is as good as it could be. This is not both films, just the first one. Much thanks to the uploader!"
,robdog04,2011-11-11T03:09Z,"@ agmobb

what smack u on, this was not how it was originally shot. I have it on dvd, and is alot better quality than this. Expected alot more for 9 Gb. No offence intended to GoodFilms."
,KKafka,2012-01-25T22:22Z,"I downloaded the much smaller (750 MB) version by YIFY, and it doesn't look very good. But the source material is supposed to be the problem. As the reviewer at blu-ray com said, ""The bulk of the film was shot on a Canon DV camcorder... there is a lot of edge enhancement and grain, the picture appears extremely soft and blurred, and there is very little detail.""
Apparently, the 9 G Version can't do better than that, except for the final part, shot in 35mm."
