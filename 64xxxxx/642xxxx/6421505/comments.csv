I hope you liked these games. Sorry for russian installer, but we have to provide russian installer for our community."
,indonesalman,2011-06-22T15:35Z,i don't know how to install this.. please help
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-23T12:09Z,"Oh my god. There is only one .exe file. ONLY ONE.
Run it."
,Powermad8,2011-08-20T20:06Z,"Thanks man, works great."
,VigossXP,2011-08-25T23:35Z,"I can't play it keeps closing every time I run it. any fixes? I've tried running it in compatibility mode and those administrator but the same thing happens, does it have anything to do with my resolution or something?"
,VigossXP,2011-09-03T11:12Z,"Actually just got a fix, right click my computer from the start button and hit properties then advanced system settings go to the advanced tab and then the click settings on the performance one go to data execution prevention tab then finally add half life's exe just the hl.exe one not the other exe's, hope this helps other people."
,gman96734,2011-09-20T05:22Z,"Having some trouble. Whenever I tried to play, it would close it self. Tried Vigoss's fix, and now I get 
""Fatal Error: Error reading application id. Please write it to steam_appid.txt or use the launcher!"""
,gman96734,2011-09-20T05:29Z,"Wait... nvm, fixed it by running the ""RUN HL1"" Or whatever in a compatibility mode."
,Ertsu1,2011-09-30T13:29Z,Guys remember not to run it with the shortcut that comes in your desktop. You have to use the .exe that is in your halflife1 folder. Not the uninstall ofcourse.
,stanito3,2011-11-12T09:25Z,nice downloading with 1.0MB/s thanks man :)
,renatobr,2012-03-28T09:21Z,"Works in english perfect, the Half Life, Blueshift and Opossing Force works perfect, but Half Life Decay no works in Singleplayer or Multplayer :("
,DanielNistrean,2012-04-16T05:12Z,"1. I don't see more than 1024x768 resolution!
2. I don't see any server!
3. It's run only in compatibility mode and turn me off of game for any ""wrong"" click or alt+tab !!!"
