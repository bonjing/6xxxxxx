try the usual: remove old codecs and replace with the newest klite or similar versions, download newest vlc player, upgrade video and audio drivers and then see if it plays. attempt a little selfhelp and research before asking simple questions and you will be watching movies a lot sooner than waiting for a shmuck like me to help you. good luck"

Maybe it's just that Phillips doesn't make the best standalone divx player.  But it doesn't kill me to sit at the computer to watch the ending of the movie."
