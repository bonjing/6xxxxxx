,grEnkenoB,2011-05-28T10:40Z,"I'm neutral on this one, if you want to put it up go for it, but since I have already downloaded the entire series (in one package) it really doesn't affect me. If it is a choice between this and something else I'd obviously pick something else.

btw, I have never uploaded anything before but I have a great deal of complete tv shows, around 70 I think, mostly anime and mostly hd. i.e. I have all of shippuden (again mostly hd) and . I am considering putting some of my collection on display. The thing is that virtually all of these have been obtained through various torrents whether whole or pieces so that means others should be able to get them the same way. Do you think it would be worthwhile to put some up? I honestly am a little concerned with the legal aspect as I don't want to draw undue attention but I don't know enough on the subject.

On that subject, would anyone/everyone please go to demandprogress.org or somewhere like it to protest the PROTECT IP act, it's COICA re-imagined, but worse. Thanks!"

@grEnkenoB; If it's they're complete collaborations, then go for it! If you need any episodes of anything in HD, let me know ;) Just stay outta my domain (FMAB/HSOD) :P Bugger copyright on TV shows IMO :D"
,grEnkenoB,2011-06-04T08:42Z,"ok, I'm still undecided but I wouldn't post anything that already has a good torrent available so no worries"
,groundnuty12,2011-08-17T20:00Z,"hey friend, you have any more Gantz in that quality? Is it dvd rip or censored version that was arriend jn Japan?"
,Trigger3lite,2012-02-15T00:20Z,"Hipolipolopigus, can you please seed. I really wanna watch this anime again."
