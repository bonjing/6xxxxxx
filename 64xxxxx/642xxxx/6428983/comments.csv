,CHICOCHOY,2011-05-30T21:31Z,STILL STUCK AT 99.4 %
[V],Nepotu,2011-05-31T00:27Z,"@CHICOCHOY & Bembis: I'll try to explain once again. I've upload first a torrent who has stucked at 99.4% and nothing, who is not that torrent. A day after I've re-upload a new torrent (this one) who is good. Try to delete your old torrent and download this one! And tell it also to motherfucker dumb kicha4u that here are 103 seeders and no need ""motherfucker"" me to seed. Sorry guyz! Is my fault to create this confusion, but I'll try to make up. If it don't work please write to me."
