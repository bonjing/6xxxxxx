_Operation Mind Control: The CIA\\\'s Plot Against America_, published in 1978, by Walter Bowart is a highly disturbing account of the use of mind control technology by a secret government (the cryptocracy) against the American people to further their own aims. Walter Bowart (1939 - 2007) was a journalist and a prominent figure in the counter-cultural movement that grew during the 1960s. He was influential in promoting mind freedom through his Freedom of Thought Foundation. Previous reviewers have alleged that when this book came out it was first suppressed by the CIA because they did not want their dabblings in mind control to be made available to the public. Perhaps this explains why the book is so rare today and remains an underground classic. This book makes reference to such other individuals as L. Fletcher Prouty, John Marks, and Alan Sheflin who also investigated the role of mind control technologies and their use by the CIA. The book includes an Foreword by Richard Condon author of the mind control classic novel _The Manchurian Candidate_ in which he explains the rise of America\\\'s secret police and their use of mind control against the American people. The book includes vast details outlining various schemes for mind control including the use of hypnosis and drugs (especially the hallucinogenic drug LSD-25) by the CIA and the use of behavior modification and the creation of mind control assassins.
