,gakirin,2011-05-30T16:58Z,"Thanks for uploading Estariae, but from what I can tell seems we're all stuck at ~94%  If anybody's got the full file and doesn't mind seeding for a bit there's only like 300 MB left, and then the swarm'll have it.  : )  Thanks!"
,raghna,2011-05-31T15:29Z,"Sorry guys... don't know why but the game wont start. Get just a short black screen, a short change of screen resolution and then crashback to desktop... somebody knows the problem?"
,Estariae,2011-06-01T04:03Z,"You're welcome everyone, and sorry about the slow/intermittent seeding. I rue the day I was duped by my ISP for such shoddy bandwidth. Nevertheless I'll seed till I die. 

@raghna
All I can suggest is that you try and reinstall. I've installed this twice without a hitch, it's a shame it's giving you such trouble."
,raghna,2011-06-01T09:48Z,":) never mind, it's totally worth it:) well, I'll try again!"
,acorn2oaks,2011-06-02T13:50Z,"Working well on Macbook Pro 2.4 Ghz Intel Core Duo 2 running 10.6.7
Thanks again Estariae"
,sugoi48,2011-06-19T01:59Z,"I can't seem to extract the file. The download was fine, and I got The Unarchiver, but it claims it can't unarchive the file. This app has great reviews, so what am I doing wrong?"
,Estariae,2011-06-25T04:20Z,@sugoi48 get UnRarX. Freeware and works great!
,undulat1,2011-07-16T22:56Z,"Anybody knows how I can transfer saved games from old, non-working installation (folder 'Ubisoft -> MystIV' in Applications) to this working version (Thanks!) that is only one App bundle in the Application folder? I can't find the folder where saved games are saved."
,pssyluvr,2011-07-17T00:01Z,"I have a MacBook and I followed the instructions and got it loaded, but when I try to open and play it I get this, ""Unable to copy file /Applications/Games/Myst IV Revelation.app/Contents/Resources/Preferences/user.reg to /Users/myname/Library/Application Support/Myst IV Revelation/user.reg"". 
Is it because my MacBook is not capable of running this or am I doing something wrong? Thanks. "
,djanguish,2011-08-06T23:18Z,"i get an error in lion saying automated runner got an error ""bundleWithpath:"" doesn't' understand the > message. any ideas ? "
,greenwink,2011-10-17T19:54Z,For undulat1:  The saved games are Mac/users/whatuseryou'rusing/library/application support/Myst IV Revelation/saved games.
,greenwink,2011-10-17T20:05Z,"For those who have played this download, does anyone have problems with the game crashing on different spots on Spire?  I've tried my own game, plus someones saved game they sent me (to use to zip feature as they had gotten past the stairs).  I'm hoping this download will work better."
,zauriel80,2012-05-31T05:46Z,"This doesn't appear to work with Lion. I get the same message djanguish received -- **Automator Runner got an error: ""bundleWithPath:"" doesn't understand the  message.**

Too bad. I was really looking forward to replaying this. :P"
,zauriel80,2012-05-31T05:50Z,"Er .. that's supposed to say ""bundleWithPath:"" doesn't understand the --event AppScalM-- message"
