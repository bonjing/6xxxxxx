Happy Trails is the second album of the American band Quicksilver Messenger Service.

Happy Trails consists mainly of a performance cover of Bo Diddley's - aka Ellas McDaniel - "Who Do You Love?" spread out over 25 minutes. The live portions of the album were recorded at the Fillmore East and at the Fillmore West.

The second half of the album consists of an almost continuous suite. Beginning with another Bo Diddley song ("Mona"), guitarist Gary Duncan's "Maiden of the Cancer Moon" follows and the album closes with "Calvary", which manifested itself during a studio acid trip. As a coda, the band sing the theme tune from Roy Rogers' western television show, which lends its title to the album.

The record was released by Capitol records in stereo.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 189 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.[1] The song "Mona" was ranked number 88 on the list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Songs also of Rolling Stone.[2]
