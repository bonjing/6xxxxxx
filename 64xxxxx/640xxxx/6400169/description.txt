     With seven quality studio albums, a Best-Of CD and DVD, seven mixed
     compilations and multiple hit singles, AndrÎ˜ Tanneberger, a.k.a. ATB
     has a remarkable and consistently successful recording career as a
     musician and DJ.
     One of elf in his approach to his productions and song writing.
     On his new album, Ã´Distant EarthÃ¶, ATB impresses with fantastic new
     songs that not only cross the line between pop and dance music, but
     will literally transcend that distinction. For this record he has
     worked with a number of artists, amongst them the brilliant Rea
     Garvey Ã» lead vocalist of no other band than the chart-topping
     Reamonn.
     Along with the album, containing loads of potential hit singles,
     comes a second, much calmer disc Ã» underlining the artistic
     complexity of ATB.
