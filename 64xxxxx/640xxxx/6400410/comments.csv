,Furious1964,2011-05-17T19:48Z,"@murkydepths: I'm with you, man. Lionhead shit on PC Gamers when they decided NOT to make the Fable 2 PC version. Same thing happened with The Lord of the Rings trilogy with no Two Towers version for PC.

Fucking console loving game companies. Gaming was start ON PCs in the good old days of text based games."
,Ltodemax,2011-05-17T20:00Z,"@Furious

They announced that Fable 3 has had a completely recoded controls system, many new graphic features, free DLC, new weapons. I don't think they shit on PC gamers. They just concentrate more on consoles... you don't seem to realise that game companies need to make money too. Because the PC has a lot of pirates, they concentrate on the console because it allows them to make money. They have kids to feed and bills to pay."
,darkfanis,2011-05-17T20:12Z,"@Furious1964 
yeah your right m8 but as @Ltodemax says they release the games on the consoles to make more money as assasins creed brotherhood and fable III and more other games..Let's hope next Fable game generation will come for out for pc too and not only for xbox ps3.."
,Onelast,2011-05-17T20:18Z,"Thank you for this download. 
I will be buying this game with next weeks paycheck. 
But my need to play this game has forced me to pirate it temporarily.
Remember Buy it if you like it!"
,Rikyu91,2011-05-17T20:52Z,availability is 0.697 is it because so many leechers or what.

,murkydepths,2011-05-17T22:04Z,people pirate console games too so that's not a good excuse to exclude PC gamers. microsoft wanted an XBox exclusive because software is the only advantage it has over PC or PS3 and Lionhead were happy to sell out their loyal PC customers just like Rockstar did
,Piratezx,2011-05-17T22:11Z,Anyone test it yet?
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-17T22:26Z,"If you never ever heard of ali213.net and netshow then you must be new. They are as trusted as CORE is (a well known 0day scene group).

Remember the reason why CORE released a repack for their first release of POWERDVD 11 (their keygen had real virus).

And about viruses and fake alerts: Most patch engines that are used for crack/keygen creation, special packers that are used by the cracking groups etc. etc. are reported as viruses/trojans/whatever, when scanned. This is expected for two reasons: 1. The real viruses use similar packers/technics 2. Fighting piracy is the second reason.

Conclusion: Buy the game and forget about cracks. Or take the risk to use a crack either from the scene either from a p2p/web group. 

Supporting companies that release good games/software, is a way of thanks.

Suggestion: Get MAME and MAME roms/chds and start playing..."

,Asghan,2011-05-17T23:09Z,"Here's a question for everyone that says pirates are mainly PC problem, think about what would happen if all companies stopped releasing pc games, does any logicaly thinking person belive pirates would just stop, of course they would all just start pirating console games, and console piracy would go up 100%. 
Thats why next time you say piracy kills PC gaming think about this."

,BlacShade,2011-05-18T05:44Z,"









I normally have no problems with anything AiTB puts out, however this one kinda makes me uneasy. When I first started dl'ing this it had some weird file called netshow.exe... so I just chose not to dl that particular file. It downloaded anyway. I deleted it. It seems to have done nothing but was still suspicious. At this point I looked into the iso itself and found that file built in. At that point I decided screw it and deleted the whole damn thing and am now dl'ing stun's version. This one just seems too weird and it has also cost AiTB a bit of my trust now. Maybe I am just being paranoid, but it still doesnt seem right."

I'd reccommend to skip this and get skidrows"
,solidesnake,2011-05-18T08:52Z,can anyone confirme that its working with the skidrow crack or you must download the game again from skidrow release

,Xiphos,2011-05-18T14:45Z,"I downloaded, installed and tried to use SKIDROW's update and crack.
@everybody: does not work, it's missing .dll files and even if you download those .dll files, it does not work because of some xlive error.
Don't download, download SKIDROW instead"
,wowme,2011-05-18T17:03Z,"I just want to confirm that this game works with the skidrow crack, which can be downloaded from AiTB again, that was posted above in link. 

I did what kapet said and now i am in game, no problems, so if you have probles you do something wrong, cause i repeat this works. Also i'd say that this download is much faster than the other too. 

Don't run the game directly btw, only by the launcher. I got an error message saying so, but others may not get it. "

,Knightwing15,2011-05-18T18:42Z,"Ok, normally never have a problem with any torrents, but getting a lot of flak on this one.

Basically, torrent installs fine. Didn't try and play it. Installed update, and didn't authorise it then either. Got paul.dll to my folder after some hassle with AVG. However, getting wrong disc inserted/no disc inserted depending on whether I have the iso mounted or not. Tried every executable in the F3 folder. Solutions?"
,154752,2011-05-18T19:14Z,"The crack from SKIDROW actually works with this release.
I've had the same problems as many of you.
The solution is: 
- either downloading the latest update for GfWL 
- or NOT RUNNING anything from the UPDATE folder from skidrow crack 
- or both of the above :)
and applying paul.dll (from SKIDROW directory) to the game main directory.
Next thing you need to do is launching the game by running FableLauncher.exe which is also in the main directory.
Than you need to create a profile for GfWL which should be created as a local profile."
