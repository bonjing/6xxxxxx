,Preagle,2011-06-04T00:33Z,Where do you get that 5.1 audio?
,blammer,2011-06-04T14:29Z,"Thanks BlueZ. De video quality is perfect. But how did you get the audio? it sounds like a stereo stream upscaled to 5.1 with some kind of DSP. Dont get me wrong i really appreciate your hard work, but i'm one of the few enjoying sound more then picture. Thanks again!"
