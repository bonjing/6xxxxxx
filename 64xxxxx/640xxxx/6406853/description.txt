Virgil's Aeneid is one of my favorite books of all time, and Elizabeth Vandiver does a great job in delivering its main themes and episodes.

An absolutely beautiful and enriching course - this is a must for all TTC fans.

I couldn't find an active torrent for it, so I made this one for you. This is my first try at creating a torrent, and I really hope you guys enjoy it. Have fun and please seed!
