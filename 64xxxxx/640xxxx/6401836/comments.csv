,lordshadows,2011-05-30T19:52Z,"No problem with the file size as that is getting pretty common on here, however I have seen uploads and I have also downloaded lots of hi-res full length 3D movies here as small as 6 gigs that were bluray quality. Usally they are MP4 or more common MKV's."
,MajiNPic,2011-06-01T17:31Z,Those 6 GB Movies are 3D side-by-side BD-rip with half resolution and very low bitrates.
