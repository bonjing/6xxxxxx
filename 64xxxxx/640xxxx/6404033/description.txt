Christina Aguilera 1999





Christina Aguilera's debut LP.


A leader in the parade of Mickey Mouse Club veterans who stormed pop at the turn of the millennium, Christina Aguilera was the sexy, brassy diva of the bunch - the Rolling Stones to Britney Spearsâ€™ Beatles, as it were. Initially, it was difficult to see Christina outside of the prism of Britney, whose 1999 success launched the new millennium's teen pop boom, but Christinaâ€™s big hits of 1999 - â€œGenie in a Bottle,â€ â€œWhat a Girl Wants,â€ â€œCome on Overâ€ - more than held their own with â€œBaby One More Time,â€ while revealing a vocalist with considerably more power and range than her erstwhile rival. Soon, Aguilera distanced herself from the rest of the teen pop pack beginning with her carnal sophomore set, Stripped, a heavy R&B album from 2002 that found its greatest success with the ballad â€œBeautiful.â€ Christina may have overemphasized her sexual side with singles like â€œDirrtty,â€ but by the time of 2006â€™s Back to Basics, it was clear that Aguilera was the most musically ambitious, and reliable, pop diva of the boom.
