[V],globeplus,2011-05-20T08:19Z,"Thank you for your comments and nice useful applications are needed to the general computer use once in a while , you can play games or watch movies or listen music that here and there for specific things the applications are useful to help to have your computer more organised and facilitate any necessary task on the moment , unfornatly for one side files without too much size it is what i can work for the moment but for other side i get the time to analise more carefully the best way to turn more pratical ueful applications that everyday can be necessary , even for myself i am getting happy with this work , not because my apps wasnĂÂ´t ok but putting them more easy to use and pratical is turning them more accessable to use , the number of possible users maybe not that much and still many work sometimes depending on the application but independtly of this particular aspects i get the sense of duty done getting this useful applications more pratical and with that the spirit that everyone is winning something when getting any of this files , it is basically a matter of more positive work in what it is possible to do and not the obcecated philosophy of the possible number of users besides the fact that at least a minimum number of helpers of the file make sense to give the opportunity to more users that can probably want the files have them too , i am still saying without any doubt that no matter what my applications files are really recommendable because they are worked with care thinking in the best pratical way to use the worked applications .

Cheers and happy general computer use to all of you . "
