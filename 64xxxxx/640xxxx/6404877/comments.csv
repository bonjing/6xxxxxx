1.If you do not have games for windows live google it and download it. Then run fablelauncher.

2. It will ask you to create a profile. You have to create an offline one or it will ask for the cd-key. To create the offline one, just scroll down and you'll see in blue text create offline or temporary or something like that.

3. Do that and play the game."

â€œFable 3 / Fable III Main Executable Has Stopped Workingâ€ / Runtime Error / Crashes to Desktop (CTD / C2D) / Fail (Failure) to Launch / Black Screen
When running the EXE, you may encounter this error message randomly in regards to Fable3.exe causing an APPCRASH. It may be related to XLIVE.DLL or your save files being in the wrong location. Of course, it could be related to the Windows Live ID Sign-in or some other problems. This also happens after obtaining the guild seal sometimes or even several other things. Try the following:

â€“ Download and Install Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5 choosing between the 64bit and 32bit versions depending on your Windows operating system
â€“ Try to register your xlive.dll by going to Start -> Run â€” cmd â€” then type in REGSVR32 /u C:\path\to\the\xlive.dll
â€“ Run the Fable 3 exe in Windows XP compatibility Service Pack 3 (SP3) mode, Launcher, as well as Steam and any other related file
â€“ Close any program that could possibly interfere with the game or its components (i.e. a firewall)
â€“ Go to the Control Panel and choose uninstall/reinstall and choose REPAIR
â€“ Reinstall / Repair Games For Windows Live / GWL
â€“ Reboot your computer
â€“ Reinstall Microsoft Games for Windows and Windows Live Essentials (GFWL / GWL / WLE). You can repair Microsoft Life Essentials via the Control Panel instead, but try reinstalling completely if that does not work.
â€“ Try logging into the Games for Windows Marketplace before launching / opening Fable 3
â€“ After reinstalling GFWL, copy the xlive.dll from C:\Windows\System32 and paste it in \Steam\steamapps\common\fable 3\ to fix the xlive.dll error. Try registering it if necessary with the CMD from above.



-or-

someone with a working game upload a save game file just past the guild seal problem to fix it it should work someone upload the save game file please?"

4. Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game
5. Copy the poul.dll files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation.

[ NOW WHAT I DIDEN KNOW]

6. Install the gfwlivesetup.exe from the G4W folder on the DVD
7. Now LIVE start up. Creat a new account.
scroll down and klik the link ""create local profile"" (Create a offline account)

-to people experiencing crash-
â€œFable 3 / Fable III Main Executable Has Stopped Workingâ€ / Runtime Error / Crashes to Desktop (CTD / C2D) / Fail (Failure) to Launch / Black Screen
When running the EXE, you may encounter this error message randomly in regards to Fable3.exe causing an APPCRASH. It may be related to XLIVE.DLL or your save files being in the wrong location. Of course, it could be related to the Windows Live ID Sign-in or some other problems. This also happens after obtaining the guild seal sometimes or even several other things. Try the following:

â€“ Download and Install Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5 choosing between the 64bit and 32bit versions depending on your Windows operating system
â€“ Try to register your xlive.dll by going to Start -> Run â€” cmd â€” then type in REGSVR32 /u C:\path\to\the\xlive.dll
â€“ Run the Fable 3 exe in Windows XP compatibility Service Pack 3 (SP3) mode, Launcher, as well as Steam and any other related file
â€“ Close any program that could possibly interfere with the game or its components (i.e. a firewall)
â€“ Go to the Control Panel and choose uninstall/reinstall and choose REPAIR
â€“ Reinstall / Repair Games For Windows Live / GWL
â€“ Reboot your computer
â€“ Reinstall Microsoft Games for Windows and Windows Live Essentials (GFWL / GWL / WLE). You can repair Microsoft Life Essentials via the Control Panel instead, but try reinstalling completely if that does not work.
â€“ Try logging into the Games for Windows Marketplace before launching / opening Fable 3
â€“ After reinstalling GFWL, copy the xlive.dll from C:\Windows\System32 and paste it in \Steam\steamapps\common\fable 3\ to fix the xlive.dll error. Try registering it if necessary with the CMD from above."

,Blackruby,2012-02-06T05:12Z,"Everytime I run either the ~unpack~ or the installer eventually it comes up saying ""kaOs has stopped working"". It gets to the part where it is saying ""deleting blah blah"" no matter which way I run it, this error pops up."
,denmarki,2012-03-30T15:01Z,working perfect thanks! :D
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2012-04-15T15:22Z,"Use the Installer Kaos included instead of mounting or extracting yourself. All the audio files have been compressed and will not work correctly unless you use their installer.
1-Run Install.exe (takes about 30 mins)
2-Make sure your DirectX is up to date and Games for Windows LIVE! is installed
3-PLAY
THANKS FOR THE RIP KAOS!!!"
,KumoZetsumei,2012-04-16T21:37Z,"for anybody having the same problem as me where fable launcher opens a process for 3 seconds and then it disappears dont expect any help from anyone here. ive already looked through all comments and all anybody does to this problem is ignore it and answer someone else. if  game wont open go somewhere else because obviously nobody here gives a shit. was really looking forward to playing this but since nobody can answer the simple question, ""when i open fable launcher nothing happens. how do i fix this?', there is no point to it even being on my pc. and before anybody says try being literate with your own pc i am a trained tech that built my pc from scratch and know dam well how it works."
