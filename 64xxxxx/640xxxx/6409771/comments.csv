,jonmobrien,2011-09-26T10:37Z,"Hi, I am a mkv3d noob. This being a 15GB single file, do I just put it onto a 16GB USB stick or portable Hard Drive, stick it into my 3D TV, play it and select SBS? If so, does the USB stick need to be a minimum standard? Cheap USB sticks can only read/write very slowly, what MB/s does this need to be?"
,jonmobrien,2011-10-14T06:49Z,"Wanted to say thanks for this seed - it is brilliant! I converted the DTS audio to AC3 so I could play it directly on my 3D TV (LG, can't handle DTS). I also kept the original and played it on my WD Media Player (which can handle DTS). This is a brilliant upload, thanks Joey!"
