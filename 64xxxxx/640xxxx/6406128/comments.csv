,bitbotter,2011-05-19T17:01Z,The quality is appaling.
,keith23uk,2011-05-19T17:44Z,The quality really isnt that bad at all! Stop moaning. Play it on vlc and looks fine. I appreciate the person who recorded this and shared it!
,krist420,2011-05-19T18:37Z,"whats up with tvteam, sceneline ect, why have they stopped uploading the good tv shows!?"
,bitbotter,2011-05-19T21:28Z,"Because of course, a file that only works with VLC is good quality."
,Okkenbom2,2011-05-19T23:57Z,"Quality is totally acceptable. Just watched this on my big screen tv (through PS3), and although I'm no expert the quality was just fine!"
,huldu,2011-05-20T01:43Z,"This is the episode 7. Not sure why people are complaining about quality, look at the size for crying out loud. It's the same as any ""official"" group release. The quality is the same or close, probably something off as it has not passed as a group release tho. They are really picky..."
,bitbotter,2011-05-20T12:37Z,"The thing is that the quality seems to depend on the player a lot, which means the encoding somehow is bad, and that some players handle these incorrect encodings well and others don't.

So full marks for effort, but ryogasama (or whoever encoded it) should get better encoding software."
