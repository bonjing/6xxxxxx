Semi-surreal and slow-moving, but involving.
 14 February 2000 | by Mr Ghostface London, England

 
I saw Glass Babies when I was about 14 and have never seen it since (it wasn\'t even listed on IMDb). What I do remember is that there are several very strong female roles in this film; the two leads Davey and Furness and the ill-fated doctor played by the fabulous Rowena Wallace.

Furness agrees to be a surrogate for Davey, but she decides she wants to keep the child. Then it seems a man called Brendan Keller, Furness\' partner, is manipulating them and many other people in his business schemes, resulting in a vaguely surreal confrontation in their country house.

It\'s not the fastest paced film, but it is interesting and as I said, the women are all very good. There\'s a nice theme and the ending is quite satisfying, if downbeat.
