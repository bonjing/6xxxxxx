,Tribellion,2011-07-27T04:17Z,"siccas21188 is right. The rar file is corrupt. Downloaded twice, got the same thing both times."
,The_Ninth_Grandmaster0096,2011-09-28T09:40Z,Tried with 7zip. Damn thing can't extract as archive. The hell?
,joetjoep,2012-02-04T19:55Z,issn't it so that you need WINrar? and NOT 7zip? just a gues. but the only other uploade from this game includes unl.uni a/b/c/d...etc. I can't figure out how to open thè´¸se.
