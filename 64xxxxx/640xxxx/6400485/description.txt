School improvement has become a dominant feature of educational reform in many countries. The pressure upon schools to improve performance has resulted in a wide range of school improvement programmes and initiatives which can provide both inspiration and advice to everyone involved in school improvement. This book draws together the most effective school improvement projects from around the world within a comprehensive overview by including detailed comparative analysis of a wide variety of school improvement initiatives. Drawing on examples from the UK, the USA, Canada, South Africa and Australia the book gives both an international snapshot and a coherent synthesis of initiatives that have given tangible results.
