Debut album from new Anglo-Italian oi!/punk band, featuring Antonella (original Klasse Kriminale, Straw Dogs, Battle Zone, Concrete Gods, Superyob and loads more) with backing musicians from the Straw Dogs/Superyob.

Strange-sounding (in a good way!) record that although rooted firmly in punk rock, also features loads of high-pitched, jazz and soul-styled vocals, psychedelic guitar flourishes and call-backs to 60s mod and pop stuff - very original and very good. I'd certainly rate this as the best punk album of 2011 so far. Ought to appeal to fans of off-the-wall rock music too. Enjoy.
