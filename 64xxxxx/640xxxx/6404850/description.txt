 Some might think this book proves that the Complete Idiot's series is running out of subjects to simplify, but it is more likely evidence that psychic phenomena have finally found acceptance in the mainstream. The perfect bridge between the mundane and the paranormal, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being Psychic introduces readers to forms of extrasensory perception (ESP)--such as clairvoyance, telepathy, and precognition--and discusses ways to improve personal psychic abilities. Arranged much like a classroom text, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being Psychic offers plenty of history on psychic phenomena and information on how established scientific fields view and study the subject. Sidebars handle jargon and technical information with easy-to-understand definitions and examples. You don't have to be a complete idiot to read this book, but even if you are, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Being Psychic will take the mystery out of ESP.
