Heil Fuhrer! "
,14-88,2011-05-18T18:12Z,It's compressed.
,wullie7362,2011-05-18T19:19Z,If your daft enough to copy these files to your directory then you deserve whatever viruses are lurking within. :D
,opiatius,2011-05-18T21:55Z,"did you really put a swastika in the info for this torrent? fucking ignorant pigs these days, i bet your a fucking american anyways you worthless piece of shit

fuck off with your virus torrent"
,14-88,2011-05-18T22:23Z,"Lol, no virus's I purchased the DLC and its simple to install. If you think it's too small that's because it's compressed by WinRAR into a .rar file. I thought I would make life easier for you's by compressing it so you only have to download 216MB rather than the 400-something that it is. There is no virus, scan it if you like here's a good tool

And I don't care if you support white power or not, the file is here for everbody to share. You're all welcome!"
,johnniebrasco,2011-05-18T22:56Z,its actually quite funny...Do you think Hitler would allow internet for the public? Or P2P? I don't trust nazis
,Tycholarfero,2011-05-18T23:14Z,"AHAHAHAHAHA!

I do not believe that this is malicious just because it has a swastika on it.

Also, you fuckers thinking that just because he has a swastika on his signature, that he is a Nazi. You make me laugh. You guys really do. The Swastika originated in India, from Buddhism, so he could be using the symbol in a Buddhist way. Hitler just made the Swastika look bad."
,Tycholarfero,2011-05-18T23:15Z,"Also, you are all a bunch of Jews, so you can suck it."
,hootieman,2011-05-18T23:16Z,FAIL I clicked on download and it says input not valid
,sbseed,2011-05-19T05:31Z,"link is fu-bar... as well as the idiot who made the nazi swastica.

grade A fail."
,elbunnyboy,2011-06-09T02:30Z,"the swastika may have not started as a nazi symbol, but the eagle carrying a swastika sure as hell is"
,a_fellow_pirate,2011-06-12T02:17Z,"An Eagle carrying a swastika... and you guys are really freaking out about this? Ha ha i downloaded a torrent for portal (PC Game if you don't know what it is) and the installer was in all Russian had Satan in a towel, a swastika, and 666 throughout the background and you guys are freaking out about an Eagle carrying a swastika... i think it is very artistic and took a long time to make so GOOD JOB 14-88!"
,kipenz,2011-07-09T00:56Z,"Great torrent, and thanks. Pity about the ""OMG EH iZ OF NAZI"" tards in the comments though, but oh well.

Heil."
,hitiuga,2012-02-06T21:06Z,"So im fucking confused, i bought the game and ive had and played it no problems(it's the legit copy after all)

I don't have a fucking new vegas or bathesda folder. It just runs off of steam. Is there some way i can still get it?"
,P-roy,2012-03-20T19:50Z,"i think you people are forgetting that the swastika is a ancient Jewish symbol anyway, and even before that a Buddhist one................ "
