downloading of digital files.

torrents finish.
Secure and Safe - With a seedbox, you donâ€™t even need to use a

FTPS - Use Encrypted FTP for transferring your files from server to
your PC at ultra-st speed.
Use Private Trackers - You can register @ Private Trackers and seed like Hell!
and lots of other features like web proxy and unrar of files !
