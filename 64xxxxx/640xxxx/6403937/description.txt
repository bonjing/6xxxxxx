APPLICATION INFO :
==================

Ashampoo Burning Studio is an optical disc authoring program for Microsoft Windows, developed by Ashampoo. It is one of the most-used alternatives to Nero Burning ROM on Windows, but not as popular as the latter.
 
Its main advantages are that it is simple, lightweight, and very easy to use.

 However, that is also one of its weaknesses: it does not contain many extras that power users might find useful.
 
It is capable of creating compilations of CDs, Optical Disc Images, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs.
 
It also allows the creation of DVD movies from video files.
 
As a way to promote their brand and software, Ashampoo has released Ashampoo Burning Studio 6 as free software.
 
Ashampoo Burning Studio 2010 Advanced is a stripped down free version of Ashampoo Burning Studio 9.24 which is available through third party websites.




enjoy ...
