,SuperWurm,2011-05-19T21:03Z,"offcuz I wanna see nazi's die! who doesnt
But when the goddamn fuck does somebody post Atlas Shrugged!!!!!!??????????????
I wanna pay to watch this movie, but in my green-left socialist-pretend-to-be-liberal country this movie is banned or it looks like it's banned. It's nowhere to be found.
Come on, it's the best novel ever. Post the goddamn cam. I'm gonna buy the DVD nomather what."

,rtghrtyzx,2011-05-19T22:51Z,Rampage whas nice or the man who womit in the IKEA bollhavet cant forever be wrong but this ordeal.
,scoopnohlee,2011-05-20T00:12Z,The first two movies from this franchise were just awful.  I can't see this being any better.  If u need to watch a decent Uwe Boll film watch Tunnel Rats 1968
,friend55,2011-05-20T00:37Z,More anti-German propaganda.........boring.
,dakindulike,2011-05-20T07:50Z,Extremezone is the only one that gives 100% all the time!!!!!!!!

,Laranth,2011-05-20T08:34Z,"THANKS YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ABOUT TIME SOMEONE GOT HOLD OF THIS, LOL"
,sparks1337,2011-05-20T18:13Z,with this movie i conclude that Uve Boll is the richest person on the planet...because only an idiot with that much money could continue to make such shitty movies so often...and i bet he had to pay the actors shitloads of money so they would willingly destroy any chance in having a respectable acting career.
,DarthExile,2011-05-20T23:19Z, this is as good as it gets for a low budget movie so everyone stfu  itss a pretty cool movie i enjoyed it   its not even the only thing bad is the trumpet low budget background music trumpets other than that its a fun nazi vampire movie worth the download get high and have fun watching its not some sci fy series low budget waste pile of shit that for sure so its not that bad guys come on  
,rtghrtyzx,2011-05-21T01:15Z,"Or some hidden nazi treasure or some kind of money laundry business. The man , the myth or where does his money comes from?"
,xxx---Mem---xxx,2011-05-21T07:34Z,"Excellent Quality

Horrible Movie"
,petarst87,2011-05-21T14:22Z," bloodrayne had such potential , I loved the game, but the movies suck so bad."
,ofogoding,2011-05-21T19:24Z,"Plot keywords at IMDB.com.. : ""Nazi"" ""Lesbian Kiss""... Bloodrayne 3, you've got my attention.

Uwe Boll, go fuck yourself."
,rtghrtyzx,2011-05-22T19:41Z,Rampage whas nice.
,Gelious,2011-05-23T00:07Z,"Wow. This movies takes the meaning of words ""bad movie"" to a whole new level. Say what you will about first movie (I like it by the way) but it is a miracle compared to this. What the hell they were thinking while filming this? And how did they get Michael Pare? Was he low on money?
Well.. at last they made a lesbian scene. Sort of.
Thanks  extremezone!"
,kragger_lidd,2011-05-23T00:41Z,"i work nights but fell asleep at 7pm watching this shit, avoid this film like you would aids."
,JOStheFOX,2011-05-23T10:15Z,"worst movie ever

,deathshadowx10,2011-05-23T17:38Z,Blame Uwe Bohl.... he killed Blood Rayne... its because of him that it became a novelty... and he's unstoppable... he has a metric fuck ton of money so he can fund his own films... leaving us to just sit here and curse his name in disgust and futility...

overstuuupifying and annoying"
,kaya.md,2011-05-24T21:50Z,"i fast forwarded the movie and it was still boring. 

and i feel like 'brain-raped', like this annoying feeling whenever i am confronted with this movie or its name. even if i look back at this cover, i feel the extreme urge to print out the movie cover and burn it whilst laughing sadistically."
,mammon78,2011-05-30T12:48Z,"So far I've found one Uwe Boll film that's worth watching more than once for a laugh, that was Postal. The rest of his films aren't what you'd call art works, this included.   Postal just captured the preposterous violence of Postal 2 The Game so well.  Maybe he's working on the theory if he makes enough films, there's got to be at least one good one."
,bebsebap,2011-05-30T22:29Z,"Why does this clown UWE FUCKINGS BOLL make movies?? some ideas:
1. He is pure evil and probably an alien.
2. He have some problems with stupidity and dumbness.
3. Braindamage, perhaps braindead (after all his movies i realy think so)
4. alien alien alien...... 
5. he is pschotic and believe he is the best at what he does. 

I hate you Uwe Boll! please dont ruin & destroy potentially good movies. DONT EVER THINK ABOUT IT
"
,Vegasbob,2011-06-01T02:56Z,I just have one qustion....IS this the unrated directors cut? 75mins seems pretty short for even a normal movie nowdays so I want to know before I download this shitfest if it's got all the good lesbo scenes they left on the cutting room floor to get an R rating in theaters. Errr...did this ever even make it to a theater? LOL
,Vegasbob,2011-06-01T03:02Z,Nevermind. Just checked it on Amazon . com and a few other places. The directors unedited cut is 79Mins. So hopefully someone will come up with that one so we get an extra 4 mins of tits and lesbian sex. :)
,MegatonSE,2011-06-01T22:15Z,This must been the best movie ever made. The acting was top notch. The script was also very good. Don't understand the complaniers and haters. You dont nothing about movies you STUPID FUCKING ARSEHOLES!
,Gelious,2011-06-05T21:42Z,"MegatonSE, LOL. You made my day))))"
,nedzweet,2011-06-17T05:15Z,This movie is so bad in parts that it's funny.
,Dauti03,2011-06-27T04:16Z,"thanks extreme 

the movie is suck.."
,wanda_5,2011-06-27T11:57Z,"Rayne should have bright red hair, just like in the game. This sucks. Also, where the hell are her armblades? FU Uwe."
