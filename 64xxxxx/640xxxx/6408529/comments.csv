,DarthExile,2011-05-20T13:44Z,so the logical thing would be to make the avi wrestling torrent and upload these first then upload the worthless pile of shit that is mp 4 hello logic no one wants to watch wrestling on pc or waste a dvd to watch one episode of smackdown this is why mp 4 is worthless for wrestling torrents please upload avi first thing in the morning it takes 30 40 mins to download and you can watch it instantly on 360 so why have all the wrestling torrents have been uploaded in mp4 wtf common logic hello mc flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
