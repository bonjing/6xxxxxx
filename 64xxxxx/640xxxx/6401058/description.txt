Rosemary Radeva won her first ever match against Emma Haize. She didn't just beat her, she rubbed it in her face. She humiliated poor Emma without mercy in RD 4. The Pixie verbally berated Emma for her poor wrestling skills and claimed how great she was to beat Emma in her very first match. Rosemary's confidence is high and is looking forward to kicking Gia's ass and repeating a very humiliating RD 4 on Gia. 

Gia is back on the mat for singles competition. She has been wrestling in this years Tag Team League. For those who don't know, The Tag Team League can be an accelerated learning curve for the new girls. Just one Tag Team Match gives the mat experience of about 5 single matches. Gia thinks it kinda cute that this tiny girl thinks she can beat her, and by cute I mean fucking hilarious. 

This is going to turn into a great rivalry for the ages. Both girls got submissions on the other, both girls got locked into holds unable to escape. Girls got fingered, girls got head locked, face sat, body scissored, head scissored, full nelson'd and generally beat up and abused. However there can only be one winner, and the winner gets rewarded- she gets to fuck and humiliate the loser, lets watch!
