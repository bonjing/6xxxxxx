,RadleyGH,2011-05-27T10:43Z,This doesn't work. The files don't overwrite anything in the art folder. Has this been tested?

Should work actually, the files there look like the ones in this torrent. 

But i have to redownload the texture pack because I cut/paste instead of copy/paste :("

Yes, I tested and tried this myself and it works.
I downloaded the other link first but was disappointed to find that it was Russian, I couldn't find any other torrent for this game so I downloaded the demo and riped the Textures file from there and put it in the one I had and it worked."
