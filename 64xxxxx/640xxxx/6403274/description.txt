Christine - Stephen King-viny

The story takes place in 1978 in Rockbridge, California.  Seventeen-year-old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) has purchased a 1958 Plymouth Fury from a strange man by the name of Mr. LeBay (Roberts Blossom).  Arnie becomes more and more obsessed with the car he calls Christine to the point that his very personality changes dramatically and even his friends Dennis (John Stockwell) and Leigh (Alexandra Paul) are unable to get through to him.  When Arnie's enemies begin to interfere, they are quickly "taken care of" by Christine.
