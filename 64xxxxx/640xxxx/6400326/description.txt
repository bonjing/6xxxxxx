Editorial Reviews

- Read the book, took the online course and test, PASSED.

- This ITIL exam prep book and course are an invaluable study aid for passing the ITIL Foundation exam. Highly recommended.

- I've been an IS project manager for over 10 years. I've studied ITIL materials in preparation, but took no courses or workshops. I studied this book and its accompanying course for 10 days immediately preceding my exam. Read the book about 3 times.

- I took the ITIL Foundation exam and got 98% of the questions correct. I think that the study tips in the book and course helped me get about 15-20 questions right that I might have otherwise missed. (your mileage may vary).

- The book and course made me confident in sitting the exam, and is the best such book that I've come across.

- Worth it especially since you have access to the online learning component as well.

- Good focus on ITIL's processes (things important to ITIL Foundation and passing the test that your experience in IT may not help you)

- Highly recommended, I passed in one go!
