[V],globeplus,2011-05-18T08:34Z," Install-on-the-run with an automatic reg and with the tools of the latest version : ACID and AxDATA , what it is positive is that the user get all the essencial work of the Alcohol 120 with this version and still get the new tools and like this , all the borrings to have this application correctly installed disappear and when the installation is finished is ready to be used .

enjoy ... "
[V],globeplus,2011-05-18T08:49Z,"With the automatic reg never was so easy to have the alcohol 120 looking great and functional on the computer hard drive in less than a minute .

See all of you ."
,DJkid90,2011-05-18T08:54Z,"thanksssssssssssssssssss


your new website pls"
[V],globeplus,2011-05-18T10:23Z,"To DJkid90 : i need time now to organise my life back , i got lot of trouble with my house change and i get rescued almost by miracle , my work in all of this years was thinked in a base of respect to the possible users and the trick of the work very simple : just do your files more pratical as possible like if they was for yourself , imagine how you liked to use the conteud of the files (games,movies or applications) and then give your best shot to create the best file possible under the circunstances you get the originals of the files or wherever , this philosophy my friendly user is correct because in anyway you are fouling the possible users or you will be fouling yourself , it is true that on games sometimes because the specificitys ocasionally some decisions on the file presentation must be maded but no matter what all the game it is available in the more pratical way as possible . so still ok too , no one it is rich as that to buy all this games,movies and applications that are nice and pratical to use , i think only millionaires maybe can have a shot but spending lot of money , the file sharing community is a great service that makes the internet entertainment more appreciated and with that the users more happy , for the moment turning back to the starting question i need time to put my life with normality again and i am checking for opportunitys in a few things but i canĂÂ´t deny just between you and me and all the possible readers of this comment that i have a secret very interesting project that i intend to put in pratic when i get the correct conditions , so for the moment i am like this but the future is in the hand gods !!!

Thank you for your sympathic comment and keep your nice file sharing community spirit because it is healthy to the body and the mind ..."

This works on all windows 7, Vista, 2K and XP

run regedit
Go to the following key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Alcohol Soft\Alcohol 120%\Options

open the Language key and change from 2070 to 1033

Close and restart Alcohol 120 = you can now read it all in english!
Cheers and hope this holds back the insanity :)"
,kiwi_xboxer,2011-06-06T23:39Z,Of course you must install this first before my registry fix
[T],jerry7_57,2011-06-07T03:09Z,"Thanks globeplus, it installed easy and works great, also would like to thank kiwi_xboxer for the language fix. "
,kiwi_xboxer,2011-06-08T00:23Z,Hey Jerry 7! - Glad to be of assistance :) I am sure it worked for you ;}
,pbzone,2011-08-03T19:36Z,"My first install failed. What is the , ? (I also get ...is not a valid Win32 application). Do I paste these two files into the Alcohol 120 folder with the other two files ACID & AxDTA?"
,pbzone,2011-08-03T19:38Z,"My first install failed. What is the ""alc.reg""*, ""regedt32.exe""*?"
,Damien74,2011-09-21T10:14Z,Since installation is in german perhaps you should include in the instructions that you have to click the big image of Alcohol box to install the real program ^^
,Damien74,2011-09-21T10:38Z,"It works just fine.
But the instructions are no good.
To install its best to start ""Alcohol120.exe"" instead of ""STARTER.exe"" and just go forward til done. Then double click ""alc.reg"" to register.
To change language after install follow kiwi_xboxers instructions."
,Damien74,2011-10-05T00:15Z,"Somthing in this made my putor crash. Had to revert to previous back-up of Windows.
