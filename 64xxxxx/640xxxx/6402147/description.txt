Application info :
==================

Alcohol 120% is an optical disc authoring program and disk image emulator created by Alcohol Soft.
Alcohol 120% can also mount disc images, with support for their proprietary Media Descriptor Image (.mds/.mdf) disc image format. It is capable of converting image files to the ISO format. Alcohol Soft has cited it will not be developing an image editor for Alcohol 120%.
The latest versions of Alcohol 120% contain the A.C.I.D. wizard. A.C.I.D., or "Alcohol Cloaking Initiative for DRM" (based originally on the Y.A.S.U. application), operates as an "SCSI-drive protector" which hides emulated drives from SecuROM 7 and SafeDisc 4.
