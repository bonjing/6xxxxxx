I've heard from pollsters that 30% of the American ppl actually believe what Fox says and also believe in the Flintstones (=humans and dinosaurs coexisted).

If this is true, and they manage to put a leader in the White house who's unable to separate fairytales from facts and politics from religion, then the rest of the world is in trouble."

O'Reilly's book is not Obama bashing he just gives you things to think about (which is something Obama worshippers seem loathe to do).. He does not condone irrational hatred for anyone, especially our leaders. I disagree with our current President, but I do not hate him. FoxNews is far more balanced than the other networks. It's just that liberals cannot stand a conservative perspective on anything. You certainly do not hear both sides on MSNBC, CNN, or the Network news."
