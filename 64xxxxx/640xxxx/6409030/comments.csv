,japz007,2011-05-20T18:35Z,"hey 2040, please do the big bang theory season 4 in one torrent.... thanks"
,rumadb_9632,2011-05-20T19:12Z,"Please don't mind but the moviepack often loses seeds. Nobody has that much patience to seed a huge torrent. Please upload separately (I can see the pack has titles which are already available separately, I'm talking about the rest) and keep your awesome rips alive. I'm already suffering with your earlier movie packs as there are no seed.
Good work and greetings ..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-20T19:14Z,"I don't know can you guys read.

""REQUESTS CANNOT BE TAKEN ANYMORE.""

Anything. In any form and shape.
No requests, no asking, no ""Please, can you upload what I need."". Nada. Zero. Nichts. Zilch. None. Nothing.

@the_shroud: My friend, do that after 21st, after all this is gone from server."

Hey, are you online? ... That was such a quick response.
Well, I'm not sucking this post now. I know your rules (that atleast 5 one) and I respect all of your rules as they all are justified. Thanx."

,sadhu19,2011-05-20T20:02Z,sorry i overlooked the above statement.
,sadhu19,2011-05-20T20:14Z,"and this has happened multiple times as We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public by saying polishing words. 
so peace i would say"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-20T20:47Z,"@rumadb_9632: OK. I have, in the past, very often released so called ""Server.Cleanup"" packs, when I wanted to save/release things I painfully encoded and upped, day by day, one by one.

Better that - than let them be ""erased"" - some even without 'seeing the light of the day'...

I do sympathize with people  on slow connections - it is my 'raison d'etre' (French phrase meaning ""reason for existence."").

However, your claim have simple solution: Become regular. I seed long enough for anyone - but
1. people on slow lines must be here and start download on day of upping
2. people must be reasonable and learn simple math - ""How much I can really download"" in let say 48h, non-stop.

People who miss something - must accept the reality. As in life, if something has been gone, by own deeds and merits, it belongs in the - past.

People shouldn't be acting like children left alone in candy store and stuff in mouth more than can swallow, take or put in the pockets."
,tylr,2011-05-20T21:22Z,"a 15+ Gb file in less than 24Hrs?? it sure is BIG.. i can jus tell that tHANKz

I am dipshit.[Bhaiyaa mujhe maf kar de]

IF SOMEBODY WANTS RESEED OF 20-40 MOVIES (MOST OF'EM till 17-05-2011)
COME to suprbay (TPB forum) and ask for a reseed...I'll do my best.

Hope you do well and carry on to your future with whatever destinies await you and I hope they are pleasant."
,sadhu19,2011-05-21T00:00Z,"@ downTYU,
don't embarrass yourself.
one has to face consequences for his actions.
you threw stones in gutter shit will come back to you......
not against you but the mentality how people change and turn their back towards someone who has been helping you . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . 
no dipshit anymore!!!!!! but remember you abused me & not many people know what you meant . . . . .( yahan pe tera kaam ho gaya hai ab yahan pe aane ka koi fayada nahi )"

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T08:33Z,"@DownTYU: Nothing pleasant, nothing nice, no fortune and no ""long life and prosperity"" cannot be even part of destiny of someone who fight brain cancer for 15 years. Nothing.

But, your ""carry on to your future with whatever destinies await you and I hope they are pleasant."" dysfunctional as is, bear some truth.

People should accept that every single moment of their future is endlessly complex conglomerate of - consequences, deeds and things they done in the past. We make our future. Primitive minds, in attempt to simplify things, make reality, future and a past acceptable - invent god, gods, destiny, karma and all other rubbish just to explain what seems as unexplainable - but in fact, is so simple that they miss to see it.

Bad things cannot be - undone.

And - I don't go anywhere - yet. I am here and I would continue, maybe not as before, regarding the numbers, but I would continue on best way I could. And that usually surpasses my real abilities."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-21T11:11Z,Thank you for Kamikaze Girls.  It sounds really enjoyable to my admittedly quirky likes.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-21T11:18Z,...and Leon!  Saw this once--'twas quite good.
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T12:22Z,"Nullified ""YOU HAVE TILL TOMORROW ONLY!!!"" - I have paid another 30 days. Someone would eat bread and water next month, but - be it.

@azrielle: Leon is one of my favoreds. I was ""sure"" (as usual) back than, that Natalie Portman would receive an Oscar and join to Tatum and Jodie in exquisite company of young recipients of golden statuesque."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-21T12:43Z,"My ex's mother, who was raised during the Depression in little rural town in Idaho, told me about ""one nail stew""--You'd start a pot of water to boil in the morning with a nail dropped in the bottom (for Iron!), and whatever you dug up, or kind neighbors brought over, or squirrels or rabbits, etc., was thrown into it as it continued to boil throughout the day.  At the end, usually, you had a pretty healthful stew, different flavor each day, but that was what they had to eat."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T12:55Z,LOL
