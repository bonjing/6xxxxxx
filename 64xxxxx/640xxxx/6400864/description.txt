BOOK INFO:

Billions of dollars are spent annually for the replacement of corroded structures, machinery, and components. Premature failure of bridges or structures due to corrosion can also result in human injury, loss of life, and collateral damage.

Written by an authority in corrosion science, Fundamentals of Corrosion: Mechanisms, Causes, and Preventative Measures comprehensively describes the causes of corrosionâ€”and the means to limit or prevent it. Engineers, designers, architects, and all those involved with the selection of construction materials will relish a reference that provides such a thorough yet basic illustration of the causes, prevention, and control of corrosion.
