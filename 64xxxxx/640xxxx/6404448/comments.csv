no logs, no cues???"
[H],politux,2011-05-22T13:03Z,"The Smiths only recorded four main albums.  The rest are compilations of older songs.  

As far as log/cue files I don't include them. "

Satiate the need

Yes, 4 main albums - you are correct Sir!

Log - verifies rip for us [EAC secure - all tracks accurately ripped]

Cue [noncompliant] - allows for CD disc image to be reconstituted"
