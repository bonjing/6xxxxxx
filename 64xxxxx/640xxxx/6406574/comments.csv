Use peerblock and you won't get letters from your IP."
,Philonetic,2011-05-27T10:27Z,"@fatalangel79
I've used peerblock without fail for years, and have still received 2 infringement notices.  One recently for Game of Thrones.  PeerBlock is not 100%, but it helps ALOT.  Especially if you add to and customize your lists -- http://www.iblocklist.com/"
,gaffya,2011-05-27T20:43Z,who the fck gives a shit if you got a letter from your isp?????????How the fuck can they do anything at all to you for d/l.a file you found on the internet??????????they cant.moron.....you think they are going to spend the money it would take to prosicute you and prove that you willfully broke the law?How can they prove it??? 
,gaffya,2011-05-27T20:49Z,who cares if you got a letter from your isp?????????how can they prove you broke the law?????????????HOW?????????????they cant idiot. gee I was just d/l something I found on the internet......I didnt know I was doing anything wrong........why do some people love to cry about stupid shit?????
,liquidsound1,2011-05-28T01:28Z,"@gaffya - you poor simple fool. 
What have we here, another 12 year old keyboard warrior shooting off at the mouth?
Just because you claim you didn't know it was illegal doesn't mean you haven't broken the law.
If only we could all go through life with your blinkers on. Fool.
+1 for protecting yourself - peer guardian etc."
,fromgtown,2011-05-30T01:07Z,its only illegal to upload as you dont know what its is you are downloading. after you find out what it is and keep it and share it....bang youve violated the law. get external hard drive to save your stuff. and only share and dl trusted material
,fromgtown,2011-05-30T01:09Z,oh and all the hide software wont hide you if you share any torrents. MPAA downloads all these torrents and gets the isp address from the list of peers in their torrent client. you cant hide
,setotitan,2011-05-30T20:17Z,"While I appreciate the effort froggie, the quality on this is utter shit! I thought it was a throwback style at the beginning at the movie but the quality never improved. Just sucked, unwatchable for me."
,flextm71,2011-05-31T02:00Z,"@gaffya
google the expendables lawsuit, that will set you straight. alot of people worldwide are in deep shit over downloading and sharing that movie. so yeah, it can happen!"
,droy333,2011-06-01T05:38Z,Letter from ISP? Its a telesync. Its like claiming copyright for sharing a home movie with the tv on in the background. Ignore the idiots.
,droy333,2011-06-01T05:40Z,"On another note, what gives your ISP the right to snoop on your data? AND for 3rd parties other than your ISP to get information that you downloaded the torrent they would have to download the torrent themselves then seed it. Douchebags."
,Dankanator,2011-06-11T23:02Z,"haha you called that guy a 12 year old keyboard warrior after he made the most intelligent comment on here. Do you really think that your going to get convicted for downloading a torrent? your stupid you get in trouble for uploading them you duck, hundreds of thousands of people bootleg movies, the people that make them would go bankrupt a quarter of the way through trying to prosecute them all, but i guess if stealing software and media is the most daring action youll ever make in your life it could seem a little extreme"
,Najwa666,2011-06-15T15:46Z,not watchable...
,candycanegl,2011-06-18T22:34Z,"OMG shut the hell up arguing on piratebay comment boards. Comment on the film quality or go get a life.
