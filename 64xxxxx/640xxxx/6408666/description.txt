As it has become easier for more and more people to go online, Internet crime has also increased. Some users view the World Wide Web as an opportunity for crime against millions of unsuspecting victims. Crimes directly related to the Internet, such as stealing personal information or engaging in fraudulent schemes, have grown rapidly. Criminals also use the Internet as a way to commit other types of crimeâ€”as a clearinghouse for stolen goods, as a hunting ground for pedophiles, and even as a corner from which to sell illegal drugs. Some believe that more oversight is needed to protect Internet users, while others see the Internet as a place that should exist without restrictions. Explore these issues and others pertaining to online crime in The Internet and Crime.
