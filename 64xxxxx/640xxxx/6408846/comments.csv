,tyrel99,2011-08-04T06:51Z,its asking for a serial number? what do i do?
,majikmann,2011-08-05T00:19Z,should I wait until I have my mac to download this? or can I get it now and just save it on my windows computer? thanks
,LoveDank,2011-08-11T11:07Z,"this needs more effects, because its essentially just the trial copy without the annoying pop up that asks you to log in.... If DeGun uploaded some effects, maybe some samples (fuck skins, no one gives a crap about them), then itd be sweet. Windows VDJ has a couple more default effects such as an advanced filter that is always fun and easy to use, however this lacks it. By the way the picture that you used in the DL info is bogus, there aren't that many effects at all for me."
,LoveDank,2011-08-11T11:08Z,i believe it only came with 5 or 6 for me..
,majikmann,2011-08-22T02:35Z,Can someone tell me how to download this for a mac? can I download it to my windows laptop then just put it on a usb key and transfer to the mac?
,majikmann,2011-08-29T01:04Z,anyone???
,.joeeee,2011-10-05T08:33Z,yes you can transfer to mac by usb. why cant you
,allhtk,2011-10-10T05:49Z,"Not working for me. I can install it, but then, when I go to start the program, it just quits out before displaying anything.....I tried deleting the folder it told me to, and I tried it with the network off....it just doesn't work."
,nattylocs,2011-10-13T04:13Z,Blessed love!Rasta lives!
,silentcopy,2011-10-13T21:53Z,This program is working! Running on OSX Lion.
,majikmann,2011-12-19T12:06Z,"Where are the instructions? Do I need to open the program first? Sorry, newbie here and want to get it right the first time (you know... measure 20 times, cut once..) =)"
,majikmann,2011-12-23T04:36Z,Anyone???
,crashdiet69,2012-02-28T07:43Z,"amazing how so many of you can't figure this out.  Install is SIMPLE. Double click the .dmg, it mounts and then you drag it to your applications folder.  Plug in the serial and it's already cracked.  No need for Little Snitch.  OBW and DeGun THANK YOU for upping such a killer product & keep up the good work!"
,steveindie,2012-04-14T07:42Z,i downloaded this. program is fully operational and opens but when i plug my pioneer ddj-ergos into my macbook and open vdj7pro my decks won't play even though i have linked them in settings. anyone know why??
