[V],scene4all,2011-05-21T08:36Z,"Yeah i already uploaded TNA Impact, just to let you know that its isn't TNA Impact anymore, Its iMPACT Wresting."
,DarthExile,2011-05-21T14:25Z,"im sorry but scene4all you have to be one of the stupidest people on earth 4 real now when everyone types in tna impact nothing comes up on the pirate bay so just leave it as tna impact wrestling so when you type tna your uplaods show  

hello use common logic all of your wrestling uploads are in CONTAINER]: mp4 meaning you can only watch this on your pc if you want to watch on your hdtv you have to burn a dvd can you please use common logic and please dont upload tna impact as impact cuz wwe made that video game called impact and claimed tna names was tna impact and not impact so thats the only reason for the name change when you type in tna your new upload dont show great job "
