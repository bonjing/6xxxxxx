,AnOkAlias,2012-03-01T03:12Z,"@Rinzler, AWESOME!!! Thanks a heluva lot... this show kicks ASS!!! I'll seed this to at LEAST a 2:1 ratio. 

@MoviesR101, The 2nd season hasn't even finished airing... there's still 3 episodes to go, with the season finale scheduled to air March 18th.

That said... it'll likely be at least a couple months before it's released on DVD and Blu-Ray. Check this out...
