BOOK INFO:

This book contains the written versions of lectures delivered since 1997 in the well-known weekly seminar on Applied Mathematics at the CollÃƒÂ¨ge de France in Paris, directed by Jacques-Louis Lions. It is the 14th and last of the series, due to the recent and untimely death of Professor Lions. 

The texts in this volume deal mostly with various aspects of the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. They present both theoretical and applied results in many fields of growing importance such as Calculus of variations and optimal control, optimization, system theory and control, operations research, fluids and continuum mechanics, nonlinear dynamics, meteorology and climate, homogenization and material science, numerical analysis and scientific computations 

The book is of interest to everyone from postgraduate, who wishes to follow the most recent progress in these fields.
