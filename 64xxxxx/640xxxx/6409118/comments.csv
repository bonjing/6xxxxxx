,wing man,2011-06-20T21:57Z,"thank you for uploading sub's!

Will seed alot"
,zmonstr,2011-08-25T02:27Z,"DUDE! I have been downloading for over a week and still only have 52 percent. I have downloaded other movies within a couple hours since then. I wonder why its taking so FREAKIN long. I do appreciate your efforts but seriously, only 4 seeders are showing up when there are many more than that.....??????"
,Xeginy,2011-10-11T17:31Z,"damn. damn damn damn. I started downloading this on 9/17, and I'm only at 47%. Now I don't have the fastest internet connection, I know, but could everyone downloading this please stop restricting your upload limit? You're screwing the rest of us over. My download speed consistently stays between 4 - 8 kB/s, though sometimes it will go as high as 12 or 15 (!!).

So....slow....

Though I do appreciate someone taking the time to put this on here in the first place, I really do. It's just so goddamn slow..."
,Xeginy,2011-11-27T22:41Z,"It certainly took long enough to download, but it's finally done.
