I've been looking round to see some kind of comedy and instead of watching that 70s show reruns I've decided to give this one a try. Man it's paid off. I'm not going to brag about the story just give you a general idea. The show is about a son - dad relationship that never was and is supposed to be made up for. The guys are trying to get a long and all of the episodes show us how hilarious at times can it be. The Generatrion gap is the obvious one to bring out the differences and comedy but a lot of situational humor is served which I would say is in pair with MASH or even a one that is better, especially since it's really contemporary and up-to-date and touches upon real-life dilemmas. Every episode leaves you with something to think about and this is the quality which I love in a show. Not many sitcoms have this. This one does and in abundance. Furthermore, it makes you laugh. I really haven't thought a sitcom could've done it to me ever since "Married with children" has been taken off.

Give it a try, it's really worthwhile.
