They saved the best for last. This is the last installment in the Cyborg Cop saga.
This film is directed by Yossi Wein who did the Cinematography for Cyborg Cop (1993) and Cyborg Cop 2(1994). It stars two great actors Bryan Genesse (The Bold And The Beautiful TV series, Cold Harvest and Project Shadowchaser II) and Frank 
Zagarino (CY Warrior, Shadowchaser). The chemistry between them is what I like about this film. Bryan has a great sense of humor and there are a lot of wisecracks by him in this film. The plot and script is solid. The villain in this film is exceptional as well as his personal robotic assassin.

Plot
----
When healthy college students involved in a research project begin to disappear, glamorous TV news reporter Evelyn Reed (Jennifer Miller) goes in to investigate. With the help of an inside informant, she uncovers the shadowy side of the corporate giant Delta Tech - the creation of indestructible high-tech warriors. To shut Delta Tech down, Evelyn steals the computer's power supply and begins to run for her life. Two "for hire" federal marshals, Max and Saint (Frank Zagarino, Bryan Genesse) are sent in to recover the woman and the chip. Only after it's too late do they realize the true evil involved. To save Evelyn, and ultimately the world, the marshals must withstand the attack of these indestructible warriors amidst explosions and raining car metal in this ultimate showdown...
