BOOK INFO:

The most informative dictionary of economics available, the Routledge Dictionary of Economics avoids the tendency to indulge in long-winded definitions of the major concepts and provides students with a lucid, comprehensive and accurate guide to the discipline. Employing the key feature of further reading with many of the terms, the book uses the subject classification system defined by the American Economic Review and The Economic Journal.
