[T],MrDowntown,2011-07-07T03:52Z,"@ronburganchor: Im actually waiting till the final issue of War of the GL's to come out on July 13 (it was delayed by DC) and then I will upload the entire thing.

Here is where I got Rage of the Red Lanterns and most anything else you'd want thats recent and before Blackest Night:

According to DC, New Guardians #1 isnt released until September 28, 2011. Unless Im mistaken on what you're requesting."
