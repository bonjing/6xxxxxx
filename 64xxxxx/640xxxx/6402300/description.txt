    Glamorous Yvonne De Carlo stars as Hester, a woman of wealth, and a      
    woman of scorn...and the timid, be forewarned. With a maniacal hatred    
    of her heirs, Hester has a thirst for revenge! Electrocution,            
    strangulation, poisoning, and a crushed skull are just a few of her      
    bloody tricks. Her beautiful niece is going nuts...and she's next on     
    the list!
