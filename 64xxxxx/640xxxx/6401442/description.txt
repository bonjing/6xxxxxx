BOOK INFO:

Whether the question is one of basic cell survival, or whether it is being used to correlate cell number to some other factor such as matrix synthesis, an estimate of cell viability is universally required. In Mammalian Cell Viability: Methods and Protocols, experts in the field describe methods from the most basic which can be performed in any laboratory, to some which require specific pieces of equipment. Initially focusing on methods for monolayer and suspension cells, later chapters describe methods for determining viability within tissue sections and 3 dimensional culture systems. Finally, methods requiring highly specialized equipment are described in order to explain what is possible. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biology series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and vital tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Practical and adaptable, Mammalian Cell Viability: Methods and Protocols serves as a self-contained laboratory manual useful to both experienced researchers and those new to this incredibly important and influential field.
