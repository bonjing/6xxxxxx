Open Worms.exe and extract to desired location.
If you installed steam in a different location than C:\Program Files\Steam, edit the config.ini file to point to your correct steam app dir.

Launch the game with Install & Play Worms.exe.


Make sure you install Worms.exe to the same harddrive your steam.exe is on for instant gameplay.

The loader will move worms game files to your steam dir, copy SmartSteam to your steam dir and open it,
Then when you're done playing worms, it will automatically move all the files back to the temp installation dir.

If it's installed to a different harddrive, it will have to "fake move" (copy and delete) all files each time,
Which will mean a long time before you can play worms.
