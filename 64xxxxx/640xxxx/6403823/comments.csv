[T],joskewarez,2011-05-18T18:46Z,Intel or AMD?
,mnfesq,2011-05-18T18:58Z,"Intel or AMD?  Both - this is a VMWare image, not an operating system.  My questions is this:  Does QE/CI work yet in VMWare?"
,brianxxx,2011-05-19T03:13Z,"Not necessarily true. A lot of these MAC VMs do NOT work well with AMD processors.

Most of the guys that make these only do so under INTEL and never mention or try to get them to work under AMD which does require a different set of tweaks and adjustments.

Been there dozens of times."
,brianxxx,2011-05-20T02:38Z,If you check out the YouTube link you can see that currently this does NOT work for AMD processors but they guy is working on a fix for it and should be available soon. Seems he might also be making a separate video too.
,mannan_31,2011-05-21T10:37Z,"Works Perfect.. Really fast and.
I am running it on Core i5 and with 2GB ram for VM.
I have tried many other VMs for 10.6.6 but they are all sluggish, but this is not sluggish at all.
works out of the box. thanks uploader."
,khalidk7,2011-05-23T05:43Z,"SoulUploader -

Hey I tried downloading this twice and every time I unzip this with 7zip, I get an ""Unsupported compression method"" error.
What's wrong with this archive?  Did it get corrupted?  I really need this and would like to download a working, non-corrupted copy.

Thanks in advance dude,"
,khalidk7,2011-05-23T05:57Z,Dismiss my previous comment please!  it works fine SoulUploader!  I had to upgrade my 7zip to the latest version and then it worked fine.
,press2010,2011-05-25T14:56Z,"Thanks for posting. Currently I have limited disk space. Default is 40GB for Mac OS ""hard drive."" Can I change that and get away with a 10 GB ""hard drive"" just to see if I can test and see if I can get it to work? TIA."
[T],SoulUploader,2011-05-31T00:42Z,"@joskewarez 
It's designed for both, and works with both. However there has had to be an AMD fix added in, if you follow the video link in the torrent, you should find the fix as well.

@brianxxx 
AMD fix is ready, hit up the YouTube channel

@press2010
There is no need to resize the hard drive if you're limiting yourself to 10gb, it's dynamic so it expands with what you put into it, it's not pre-allocated"
,enjourni,2011-06-04T18:02Z,"Looks cool, except how do you bypass the VMware check for Mac OS? It tells you that Mac OS is not supported, then forces you to quit."
,Givinity,2011-06-06T19:24Z,"What is the root password?

...and how do i change it?"
,Givinity,2011-06-06T19:57Z,"enjourni: what they are trying to say is: Mac OS X is not supported on VMWare Player (aka vmware free edition);BUY vmware workstation or better and try again.

so you need to download a recent VMWare Workstation (or better)"
,doc_adeel,2011-06-10T19:57Z,Can you please tell me the root password.Ive struggled a lot but i cant make it to work when i try to access root.
,Skidogg,2011-06-17T00:22Z,VM works better than anyone ive tried so far but once Im in and try to download and the dmg file is mounted i go to open and an error appears stating the file closed unexpectedly. Please tell me this is just a setting and that i can indeed download files.
,Albion87,2011-06-18T07:58Z,"SoulUploader, I can't thank you enough for this!

I've been testing various versions of Hackintosh for over a year now, trying to find one that works properly, especially the audio. 

The reason the audio is important is my sister is blind, and desperately wants to get herself a Mac; we're a little reluctant, as we don't know how well VoiceOver would work for her. 

Every other VMWare machine I've tried has had problems with the audio stuttering -- this one actually works properly!! 

So, now she can try out VoiceOver and her braille display and get a better idea of how well it will work out before we go ahead and take the plunge on a real Mac. 

Thanks again. "
,tackfurlo,2011-06-22T17:57Z,"Every time I try to load this I get an error telling me the guest is not MacOS Server (as if I didn't already know that...) and then immediately closing.  Won't even boot once.

So, I tried changing the Guest OS type to ""Other 64-bit"" and then I get an error saying ""The guest has disabled the processor.""

So...it's either not MacOS >>>SERVER"
[T],SoulUploader,2011-06-26T13:19Z,Root password = none set. Go to Account settings and set one to be able to run Sudo commands.
,weezykid,2011-08-08T01:26Z,Tack - I am experiencing the same thing..
,qwerdy,2011-08-11T15:01Z,"Anyone sucessfully installed XCODE on this?

I get a ""internal error"" message when launching it."
,vangnol,2012-03-09T21:50Z,"seed please!!
i'm also seeding"
,vangnol,2012-03-10T02:01Z,"wow I just finished downloading.
So excited"
,binyo66,2012-06-18T13:15Z,Anyone has an image for virtual box?
