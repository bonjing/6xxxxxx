,volcanogodless,2011-05-19T23:47Z,scan says there's a trojan in patch.exe....
,Pzer0cool,2011-05-20T00:04Z,"AVG says harmful program detected, ""HackTool.MRV"" found in patch.exe."
,lt200420,2011-05-20T00:32Z,"To those claiming virus... It is OBVIOUSLY a false postive. Avast, Kaspersky, and MSE (which is what I use and everyone should use) all test clean...

Everyone else that knows whats up... Enjoy! :)"
,Shadow Master,2011-05-20T03:28Z,"It seems like it's a rule that someone must come along and say ""OMG VIRUS"". But anyway, this may not have a virus, but unfortunately I'm still getting the ads, just like on .32."
,TRMxKNW,2011-05-20T09:59Z,"Despite everyone claiming it as a virus, I wouldn't even want to touch this one. This exact version (download) is being spread among other users and is being replicated. The original is no where to be found, so I wouldn't trust any of these new ones. 

The first thing people say is, its a virus! Then you get these morons spamming saying learn to torrent, its a false positive. But really, are you 100% sure its not really a virus? Don't go with the flow, investigate this stuff. 

A hacktool isn't a modified version as a false positive, so have fun with this torrent if you decide to download it, especially from someone with that username, with no background or being trusted."
,Shadow Master,2011-05-21T09:24Z,"The burden of proof is really on people to prove that it IS a virus, if they say it is. Obviously many torrents will show up as viruses even though they aren't. That's just a fact, it's not people being careless and just mindlessly believing it's not. If you know something is a virus, then you will have real proof, not a random anti-virus software claiming it is. If you have no proof, then it can't be a very good virus, because viruses tend to, you know, cause harm to your computer in some way. I have downloaded many of these builds, and almost every time I have seen people crying that it is a virus. Well, if any of them were, you may as well download them anyway, because I did, and the only thing that ever happened to my computer was that I ended up with the pro version of Trillian. Oh, and NOD32 did not pick up any of these as a virus."
,MCF3778,2011-05-21T22:01Z,yes its a false positive patchs and keygens are trojans but they only do harm on the file that is designed to work on.. and its not a harmful trojan its a patcher trojan... only problem is the adds still pop up...  looks more like this needs a host or redirect block and not a patch since its pro and still talks to the add server...
,selvax,2011-05-22T00:57Z,"For all of you who are still seeing those ads: use the patcher provided in this torrent, and replace the talk.dll with the cracked file from this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6382438/Trillian.5.Pro.for.Windows.v5.0.0.32.FINAL.REPACK.READNFO-TE"
,Tsarli,2011-05-22T04:17Z,"You forgot to mention: run as administrator.

And nope, no virus detected."
,Shadow Master,2011-05-22T06:46Z,"Oh, and I forgot to mention why I came back here. It doesn't look like I've been getting any ads these past two days, so this may be working after all. I definitely did get ads that first day though."
,Kirnath,2011-05-28T03:46Z,"---START PATCHING---

[SEARCH & REPLACE PATCH]
Loading File:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Trillian\trillian.exe
Can't find pattern!Trying next one...
Nothing patched!
...done!

---PATCHING DONE---"
,Kirnath,2011-05-28T03:48Z,"forgot to mention Yes i put it in the right directory. Yes, I ran as admin...
and 
Yes I still get ""nothing patched""  & I still get ads.  I've had this running for a few days now."
,LightTheRebellion,2011-06-08T00:45Z,"Downloading, installing, and running this patch took me all of five minutes to do. It's sad that some people are having so much trouble. :( A clearer explanation than the txt file can't be given.

Also, no virus."
,freedomdwarf,2011-10-07T12:31Z,"For the sake of a few small ads in a chat window, why even risk this sort of torrent?
Trillian is *FREE* from the official developers - nothing is restricted any more.
Latest build is v5.1 build 11 so this one (or the patch) may not even work for FaceBook, G+ or Skype as they have changed the connection."
