,rex96,2011-05-21T22:07Z,Upscaled DVD-rip !!! When will this madness end? Twice the size for no apparent improvement in picture quality in most cases and a total waste of time and bandwidth usually.
,PrideAndNoPrejudice,2012-04-11T18:43Z,"Uploader, sorry, but common sense dictates that I have to echo rex96's comments.  Why on earth would anyone upscale a DVD rip?  

For those that don't understand the principle, it is as pointless as taking an mp3 audio file at 128kbps and increasing the bit rate to 320kbps, or taking a small jpg picture and making it bigger - it achieves no improvement at all and only increases the file size.

The point is that you cannot improve upon the quality of the original source - and this should not be described as high resolution.  It is a DVD rip - end of story.

Until a genuine blu-ray rip is available, doenloaders would be better advised to find a smaller DVD rip that is not so unnecessarily bloated by pointless upscaling."
