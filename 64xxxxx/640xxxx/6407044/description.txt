Nsauditor Network Security Auditor 2 - Advanced All-In-One Network Tools Suite! Nsauditor is a complete networking utilities package that includes more than 45 network tools and utilities for network auditing, scanning, network connections monitoring and more. Nsauditor Network Security Auditor combines in one product Network Security and Vulnerability Scanning, Network Monitoring and Network Inventory, it allows monitoring network computers for possible vulnerabilities, checking enterprise network for all potential methods that a hacker might use to attack it and create a report of potential problems that were found. Nsauditor helps network administrators to identify security holes and flaws in their networked systems. The program also includes firewall system, real-time network monitoring, packet filtering and analyzing. Nsauditor significantly reduces the total cost of network management in enterprise environments by enabling IT personnel and systems administrators gather a wide range of information from all the computers in the network without installing server-side applications on these computers and create a report of potential problems that were found. A network monitor provides some insight into services running locally, with options to dig down into each connection and analyze the remote system, terminate connections, block unwanted network connections with incrusted firewall system and view data on the associated process.

Nsauditor Key Features
Auditor
Network Auditor is a tool to discover the network services and to check them for discovering well known security vulnerabilities. This tool creates an audit report in HTML and XML formats.

Network Monitor
Network Monitor shows detailed listings of all TCP and UDP endpoints, including the owning process name and details, remote address and state of TCP connections, as well as the host dns name, country , network class, appropriate service name and service description.

NetBIOS Auditor
NetBios Auditor is a tool to discover NetBios names. NetBios names are the names of the Services and Machines. NetBIOS Scanner is a powerful and fast tool for exploring networks , scanning a network within a given range of IP addresses and for listing computers which offer NetBIOS resource sharing service as well as their name tables and NetBIOS connections. After the NetBios audit process is over you will get general information about the remote computer including IP Address, Machine , Workgroup, Sharing, Ethernet Address, Adapter Producer. Also you will get information about workstation users, groups, machines. For each selected option ( Users, Users Log, Machines, Groups ) the appropriate fields will be shown. The workstation info will be available too. For each selected option ( NB Names, Services, Programs, Info, Hotfixes, Run, URLs) the appropriate fields will be shown. You will also get the information about Account Policies ( including Policy and Security Setting ) and Shared Resources. The information about Shared Resources depends on the selected option ( Shares, Hidden Shares, Connection , Browser Helper Objects ).

Sun RPC Auditor
Audit Sun RPC uses ONCRPC (Sun RPC) protocols to access the port mapper daemon/service that typically runs on port 111 of UNIX or Linux machines. This tool includes a port mapper to dump where a list of all running registered daemons are shown.

MS RPC Auditor
Audit MS RPC, is a Microsoft implementation of DCE RPC. The auditor dump is a list of named pipes that are used by Windows RPC services as endpoints. The interface identifier associated with each named pipe represents the service typically accessed when a given named pipe is used.

Port Scanner
Port Scanner is a fast TCP / UDP scanner, a tool that detects if certain TCP / UDP ports are open and accepts connections. TCP scanners are usually used to check if the remote computer runs services (e.g. Telnet or FTP). The main function of the port scanner consists in sending messages to the user-defined port list .The type of received response indicates whether the ports are opened. Port Scanner has the following scan modes: connect scan, SYN stealth, FIN stealth, Ping sweep, UDP scan, NULL scan, XMAS tree, IP protocol scan, ACK scan.

Web Proxy Scanner
CGI probes are sent against web servers. This tool provides an ability to turn them off and if the user is running an audit from a proxy server, he/she can configure the scanner to run CGI probes through that proxy.

Adware Scanner
Adware Scanner searches the registry and gives you a quick look at the Adware, malware and spyware installed on your computer or in the range of network computers.

Remote System OS detector
Nsauditor does OS detection and automatically creates OS fingerprints which are not included in database.

LM / NTLM Spider
LM / NTLM Spider is a password audit and recovery tool. Passwords are sources of security vulnerabilities
in different machines. This tool allows to identify and access password vulnerabilities.

DNS Lookup
DNS lookup converts IP addresses to hostnames and vice versa and obtains aliases. DNS lookup performs advanced DNS queries, such as MX or CNAME. The full query list contains A, NS, MD, MF, CNAME, SOA, MB, MG, MR, NULL, WKS, PTR, HINFO, MINFO,MX,TXT,AXFR,MAILB,MAILA,*. DNS Lookup supports checking if the host is in a Real-time Black list for spammers "RBL ".

Email Validate
The Email Validate Tool is a client utility for checking the validity of an email account.

Enumerate Computers
Enumerate computers is a tool to enumerate computers in a domain. Depending on enumeration parameters the tool can enumerate all computers , SQL servers , primary and backup domain controllers, etc.

Ping
Ping is a tool that provides an opportunity to verify that the specified IP address exists. This tool is used to ensure that a host you are trying to reach is accessible. Ping also can be used with the reachable host to see how long it takes to get the response back. Also you can get information about the operating system of remote host .

Trace Route
Trace Route is a tool that traces the route (the specific gateway computers at each hop) from a client machine to the remote host by reporting all router IP addresses between them. It also calculates and displays the duration that each hop takes. Trace Route is a handy tool for both understanding where problems exist in the Internet network and for getting a detailed sense of the Internet itself.

Finger
Finger is a tool for discovering user information by using well known finger service. Using Finger tool makes possible to get "Abuse Address" of remote host. For example to get the abuse address of prontomail.com you should type prontomail.com@abuse.net in the finger input section. As a result you will receive abuse@mailcentro.com (for prontomail.com) in the finger response section.

Whois
This tool will lookup information on a domain, IP address, or a name. You can select a specific WhoIs Server, or you can use the 'Default' option for the default server.

Traffic Emulator
Network Traffic Emulator generates IP / ICMP / TCP / UDP / HTTP traffic to stress test servers, routers and firewalls under heavy network load. It is a very simple and fast program which can simulate client activity.
