The Decemberists - Live At Bull Moose (2011)(EP)(FLAC)








It isnâ€™t every day that the band with the countryâ€™s number one bestselling album stops by to play an instore at your local record shop, but today, thatâ€™s exactly what we got here in Southern Maine. The Decemberists took a day off between Boston and Montreal to visit Bull Moose Music in Scarborough, Maine (which recently expanded with a new books section), to play a set of about 45 minutes for a few hundreds fans â€“ a recording of which was made and will supposedly be released in the near future.
