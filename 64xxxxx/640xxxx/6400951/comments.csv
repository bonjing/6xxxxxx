The minecraft.exe is made by AnjoCaido which allows you to change nick. I had no problems with this version yet"
,BudKing95,2011-05-23T04:28Z,does hamachi work on it for multiplayer?
,KilianaNightwolf,2011-05-23T21:04Z,"The readme file says to copy the folder into ""%appdata%"".  Where is this, or do I have to create it myself?"

Yes it works but I have experienced lag when the world is set with monsters (in Peaceful mode it is pretty much laggless). For more info about Minecraft's multiplayer search in youtube;

@KilianaNightwolf 

Go to my computer and simply type in the address bar %appdata% and press enter. You will be directed into the right folder. There you copy the .minecraft folder"
,KilianaNightwolf,2011-05-28T04:33Z,"I have no folder named %appdata%, but it worked just fine when I started it from the folder it downloaded to.  Now I just need to figure out how to go around building stuff."

,martinocco,2011-06-03T14:58Z,it works from the folder where i downloaded it but i had to run it as an administrator.
,Fre0n,2011-06-06T14:38Z,"A newer version is available here

,koopatroopa_15,2011-07-02T16:54Z,"For those of  you running windows 7 do the following.

1. Open Control Panel
2. Double click Folder Options
3. Select the second tab "" View ""
4. 5 checkboxes down there is "" Hidden Files and Folders """
,koopatroopa_15,2011-07-02T16:58Z,"
5. Click the circle that says "" Show hidden files, folders, and drives.
6. Click Apply at the lower right corner of that window.
7. The directory you should be putting the .minecraft directory in is 
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming

note that the Admin directory could be named something else depending on what you named your user when you installed windows 7. 

When you are done you should have this directory:
C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft

If you are not running win7 then this does not apply to you. Hope this helps (^_^)"
