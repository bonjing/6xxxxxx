,OEM,2011-05-21T12:56Z,This is indeed fully region-free (Region Code: 0xFFFFFFFF).
,Charbis,2011-05-22T03:04Z,"Wow, region free?, that would be legendary. Going to try it, will report back.
"

,shikibane,2011-06-29T07:19Z,This is region free but for some reason i get the dirty disk error im wondering if it has anything to do with it being a new game.
