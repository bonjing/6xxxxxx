,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-18T11:26Z,"@trtcmt, no this is not password protected. You are doing somethinh wrong. Do you know how to download from a torrent? Dow you know how to unpack rar files?

Either way I would suggest buying the game if you like and avoid all the trouble."
,LordMerkadis,2011-05-18T15:41Z,"Or if ur brain is too small to handle it, lol."

,Bladeboy05,2011-05-18T16:40Z,@rob66699 I've been looking forward to this for months now. Thanks skidrow for uping this on the first day of release! I just wish the seeders and people that have it fully downloaded would seed faster or just seed period.
,Knightwing15,2011-05-18T18:43Z,"Ok, normally never have a problem with any torrents, but getting a lot of flak on this one.

Basically, torrent installs fine. Didn't try and play it. Installed update, and didn't authorise it then either. Got paul.dll to my folder after some hassle with AVG. However, getting wrong disc inserted/no disc inserted depending on whether I have the iso mounted or not. Tried every executable in the F3 folder. Solutions?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-05-18T19:41Z,"lmao @sandro_80, poor guy, FYI insulting TPB staff and someone for uploading stuff for a shithead like you can lead you lifetime ban-hammer.... hmmz interesting :) 

@P2P4L1f3 nice respond could made it any better :)"
,Knightwing15,2011-05-18T21:53Z,"@Stun

Hey dude, I don't suppose you've got any info on how to fix this wrong/no disc issue that's surfaced? Believe me, I've installed it all correctly. In fact, I've done it three times!"
,Knightwing15,2011-05-18T21:59Z,"@Stun

Any luck finding a solution to the no/wrong disc problem?"
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-05-18T22:49Z,@Knightwing15 turn of you Av when moving/placing crack or patching it
,miquisite,2011-05-18T23:59Z,"All torrents are really slow from sweden :(
1.3 kb/s on every torrent"
,GreenChaos,2011-05-19T14:12Z,"Just wanted to say thanks for the upload Stun, had no problems on win7 64bit, hope the skid rowdies do a DLC pack release for this game, its a crime what they want for it all!"
,Zeddy1234,2011-05-19T19:04Z,I am also getting asked for a password when opening the rars of this torrent in Winrar.  The comment box in winrar even says that in order to get the password to visit a url link it provides where you have to take an online quiz and then enter your mobile phone number before it'll allow you to see the password.
,Bladeboy05,2011-05-19T19:10Z,"Yeah this isn't working for me , every time I try to install from the update folder I get a Error Message "" failed installing update title. All help is appreciated :)"
,marcelo18,2011-05-20T08:43Z,I am also getting asked for a password when opening the rars of this torrent in Winrar
,The-Cookie-Monster,2011-05-21T20:23Z,"If you allready downloaded this Torrent the password is: tw2aok99998

If you haven't downloaded this torrent yet i suggest you download the official skidrow torrent.
"
,Pr0dr0m,2011-05-22T17:30Z,"@P2P4L1f3 You are an idiot. The rar is indeed protected. If I was trying to prevent people from pirating it, I wouldn't hve givven an alternate healthier torrent. ffs... Read the the-cookie-monster's comment, check the +18/-26 quality of the torrent and be silent."
,dmbtorrents,2011-05-23T11:11Z,"I really don't get why people are saying it requires a password, because it doesn't. Maybe some fake anti-piracy crap?

And please, cut the seeding request crap. I, for one, am constantly seeding this release, I have a ratio of 37. The reason that speeds are slow for some might be due some hit & runners.

@Stun -- thanks for this release -- you rock!"
,dmbtorrents,2011-05-23T11:20Z,"Oh, and for the ""pics or it didn't happen"" comments:

,Devikn,2011-05-26T14:17Z,"Hello. First of all, Thanks Stun for this great upload.

Second, I didnt find ANY problem extracting the files, its just a matter of right clicking and Extracting, something that even a 6 years old kid could do. 

And finally, I'm having an issue which is:

I've followed correctly all directions, mounted an image, installed the game, used the 1111.1111 password thing and everything went perfectly well, no errors on installation.

After that, I immediatelly updated the game with the setup file from UPDATE folder, and copied the paul.dll file to the game folder with my antivirus off. Replaced it on the old file and had all the directions done with.

G4W is already installed in my computer from previous games so I didn't have to install it, but the moment i 2x click ANY .exe file related with the game, either Launcher or not, nothing would happen, like the file is dead. I already tried starting it from the Setup Launcher where it says ""Play"" and it doesn't works either.

I'm using a Win7 32bits and I even tried repairing the game files from setup but it didn't work either.

Anyone can help me with this issue?

Also, i'm seeding. Thanks in advance"
,Devikn,2011-05-26T14:35Z,"Right guys, also to add up on my last comment:

I have my antivirus turned OFF, and when I try to execute the game from Fable3.exe I get the following error message:

""The ordinal 5372 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll.""

I have no idea what it might mean, but I guess it may be a file missing"
,AKERSEKOMIS,2011-05-27T18:22Z,"@Devikn
I have the exact same problem but it doesnt seem to be a solution for this. Will have to wait for another release."
,AnderCart,2011-05-28T11:37Z,does this work for enyone?
