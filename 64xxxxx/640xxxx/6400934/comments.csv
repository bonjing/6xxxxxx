[H],HeroMaster,2011-05-17T20:28Z,"@Stun I am talking about Skidrow not you stun, they are giving pictures of the game, they have only time for that dude."
,antarsan,2011-05-17T21:28Z,"Really? They wasted their time on their crack 'cause someone was too stupid to play, and you're talking trash about skidrow? You should be talking trash about the morons who nuked the release... CRACK 100% FINE"
,shauwy,2011-05-17T21:55Z,"first: ""paul.dll"" excite my antivirus but i'm sure it's a false positif
second:the game launch but the screen LEGO and the menu it's very very slow
(i have i7 gtx480 6go ram)
idea why the game it's so slow?
graphic driver and directx it's the last update..."

[V],djDEVASTATE2009,2011-05-18T13:24Z,why all the fuss the game is shit anyway lol
,Lerianis2,2011-05-18T15:44Z,"The fuss is because the crack is non-working on Windows 64-bit systems. It might work on 32-bit systems, I don't have one to try it on (shock, right....... when every system sold today is 64-bit only!)."
,hootieman,2011-05-19T02:54Z,"Would this fix my problem? I installed everything correctly, got it cracked, started it up, was normal til I get to a scene where there's a moon, and water right at the beginning, and freezes does jack shit"
,Crane74,2011-05-19T15:59Z,î same thing with me î
,xchris5442x,2011-05-22T02:08Z,AVG shows Paul.dll as a Virus. When trying to run the game on Windows 7 64Bit says insert original game disc. Have to wait for crack update
,Pashas223,2011-05-28T20:47Z,"How do I mount or burn it? I just have the NFO file, and you can't opperate on it (only open as a text file) D:"
,lcalzone,2011-06-13T22:12Z,i only get pictures why?
,TrashO2,2011-07-03T11:55Z,"This is joke? This ""crack"" is a perfect piece of shit: cannot end some chapters, fps is very low etc. Unplayable game."
,TrashO2,2011-07-03T11:58Z,"So FUCK OFF SKIDROW, dont send jpg, just fix yours work."
