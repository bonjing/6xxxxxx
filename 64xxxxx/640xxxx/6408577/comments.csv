so true !"
,ust2,2011-05-27T21:21Z," Skipped through a few minutes of it, seems kind of interesting. 

 It's done something like one of those Ghost Hunter type show, except something will actually happen lol.

,ebud,2011-05-29T07:40Z,"Ok, here's my review of the movie : piece-o-shit,
hated it. Pretty similar to 'The BlairWitch shitmovie'.

Wasn't worth 1HÂ˝ of my time! fuck it!"
,ust2,2011-05-30T03:59Z," lol I don't know what people are complaining about. 

 Just finished watching it and it was actually pretty good, especially for a low budget/independant film.

 Hell of a lot better than any of the hollywood ""horror"" i've had to sit through the past few years."
,umim,2011-05-31T07:56Z,It is most stupid movie for last 5 years! Second place: Battle Los Angeles.
,brunomsilva82,2011-05-31T11:50Z,thnks mate

My opinion:

Video: 6/10 (Poor quality)

Subtitle folder should be contain of two files (*.idx and *.sub).
There is no (*.sub) file, so subtitle doesn't work...

Thank you for sharing but expected better quality"

,macca8100,2011-08-22T16:51Z,"@ Persian-boy.
I cant believe these people who complain. You get all this for free and you still must find something to nag about. 
If thats the way you feel dont download it.
YOU do all the hard work yourself and get something better up............. Whats that............
Didnt think so.....  Wise up will u. people do the best they can and me myself am gratefull for anything THEY decide to share with us. If it wasn't for these kind people who rip these for us you wouldnt be watching anything so if youve got nothing good to say just dont bother.

Thanks for all your hard work getting these films to us guys, some of us really do appreciate it.."

,michaelrwatson,2012-04-26T08:04Z,"WARNING: this is yet another low budget ""found footage"" movie. The low budget doesn't bother me, but if i never see another found footage flick it will be too soon."
,OverlordAlexndr,2012-05-18T13:26Z,Decent horror(compared to the crap you get today). Great quality. thanks TvTeam.
