Kudos

PS I have been collecting documentaries going as far back to the days of grammaphones, 8 tracks,VHS & now digital HD. I have thousands I wish I have been converting many of them to DVD from VHS but don't know of how to do others. But I have been looking for a great perspective the French educators gave on WWII of a worn out VHS series I have called, "" THE WAR YEARS"" which the history channel put on for only a short period back in 1996 when it first came on. Have looked everywhere trying to find a DVD format. It was made by a French Canadian Company.

Anyway, Thank You"

I use DVD- recorder to capture VHS, in my opinion the only way to get a good quality copy of the program. More old military history documentaries from my VHS- stock to follow soon..  "
