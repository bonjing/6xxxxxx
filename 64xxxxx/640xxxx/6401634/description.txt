This Emmy-award winning film gives a concise and analytical account of the first Nuremberg Trial and its twelve successors. It explores the trials against the background of the emerging Cold War and the shifting allegiances of former wartime allies and enemies in the immediate post-war period. Original black and white photography shot on location in New York, Washington, London and Nuremberg is combined with unseen archive images and the private photographs of prosecutors and defenders to create a memorable account of the trial of the century.
