INSTRUCTIONS
1.Unrar
2.Run "Onimusha Warlords 1 Click.exe"
3.The only thing that is ALWAYS in Chinese is the main menu when you start the game. There are 3 selections. The upper one means New Game (after you have made your first save you will see another menu below the New Game Menu which will mean Load Game), the middle one Options and the lowest one Quit Game.
By default the game's audio is set to Japanese and the subtitles are set to chinese, to change that into English you need to start the middle(Options) menu, where you need to press left once on the first two options to change the subtitles and audio to English.After that you need to go to the bottom left which means "Ok" and then you can start your game with everything in English EXCEPT the main menu.The first CG can NOT be skipped, after that use the Backspace to skip any in-game movies if yoou wish.The in-game Menu is English and it can be accessed via the "/" button on your keyboard (normally located right next to the right Shift button), there you can find the controls in English (if you have done right all of the above). 
4.Enjoy.

Warning this is a PORTABLE version of the game.
All portable versions brought to you by us most probably

Onimusha: Warlords, released in Japan as Onimusha (????), is the first action-adventure video game of the Onimusha series, released first for the PlayStation 2 in 2001. Later it went through many changes and was released as Genma Onimusha (?? ????) for the Xbox in 2002. The game was also ported to PC Windows as Onimusha: Warlords, although this version was only released in Asia and Russia.

Story

The game features samurai Samanosuke Akechi (modeled after actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, also credited as the game's "guest creator"), determined to save Princess Yuki of the Saito clan and defeat the warlord Oda Nobunaga, resurrected after signing a pact with yokai demons. The game also features Kaede, a female ninja who provides Samanosuke with help. They both travel throughout all of Inabayama Castle, where they find special weapons and solve various puzzles as they search for clues of Princess Yuki's whereabouts.

Gameplay

Gameplay in the game is similar to that of Capcom's Resident Evil series, but with an emphasis on close-range combat.

The player begins the game with a standard katana sword, and can also obtain long range weapons with limited supply. However, as the player progresses, Samanosuke can gain three elemental weapons: Raizan, Enyuu and Shippuu, each with an elemental magic attack. As enemies are defeated, they release different coloured souls that are absorbed by using the demon gauntlet on Samanosuke's wrist: red souls act as a sort of "currency" which can be used for upgrading weaponry, yellow souls recover health, while blue souls recover magic power which is used to perform each weapon's elemental abilities.

Some sections are played with Samanosuke's assistant, Kaede, who has her own array of weapons and abilities, but is unable to absorb souls.
