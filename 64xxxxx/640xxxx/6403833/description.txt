Hey guys, I know a lot of you don't have access to Mac or whatever to build custom firmwares, or aren't up to date on jailbreak knowledge etc. on iDevices, so I took the time to make every 4.3.2 custom firmware possible so you can just download it straight finished instead of making it yourself :)

Just need to select the folder with the title that matches your needs (see bottom for determining iPhone 3GS firmware required), for example an iPod 4 user just needs to download the iPod 4 folder, as files needed for all devices are put in each folder anyway. Make sure to download the .html shortcut within the folder, because if you haven't been directed to this torrent from a video tutorial, you need to watch the video tutorial to see how this works.

iPhone 3GS users: You can determine which bootrom version you need by checking your device serial number. If the 4th and 5th digits equal a number less than 40, you require the old bootrom firmware.

Thanks for downloading, I hope this was useful, and please please please remember to seed ! :)
