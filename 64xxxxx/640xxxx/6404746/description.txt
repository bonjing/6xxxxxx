 http://arenabg.com or http://0.arenabg.com are two incarnations of the same website arenabg.com
arenabg.com is just for Bulgaria
0.arenabg.com is for all other nations. 
when you try to log into arenabg.com from anywhere but Bulgaria you get redirected to 0.arenabg.com
if you are in canada you get the message \"Access denied! Your national law may provide civil or criminal sanctions even for infringements of copyright law for non-commercial purposes\".
the same is true if you are in the usa, uk, germany, poland, etc.

for a while i was told and believed you could only get in via bulgarian proxies.  Yes it does work but there are no automated bg proxies and very few overused manual proxies.

what i found out recently was that you can log in from hungary, macedonia, columbia, nigeria(i think) kyrigstan, khasakstan and a whole lot of \"east to central\" euro nations plus an 
assortemnt of other non-g10 like or non-neo-lierabeske nation states.  


2 good websites for manual proxy servers.  if one doesn\'t work try the next.

nntime.com

www.xroxy.com

if you can\'t figure out how to use manual proxy servers, then search for public proxy servers and you will find some sites.  be warned - you must click buttons IF page doesn\'t load
properly, like enable java or whatever.  

search srtings like \"fresh COUNTRY NAME proxies\" / ie fresh hungarian proxies or \"lastest COUNRTY NAME proxy servers\" wil get tons of good sites.

if u r like me, then u only use proxies to d/l stuff from (ILLEGALLY BLOCKED WEBSITES: AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED) arenabg.com /0.arenabg.com or to annoy SPIES like google and others.
