Release Title: BBC - Movin'on Up - Pop Hits from 1991 - [MP4-AAC](oan)

Encode date: UTC 2011-05-14

Storyline:


BBC archive compilation exploring 1991's fellow travellers from the British indie guitar
and dance scenes that accompanied Primal Scream's breakthough Screamadelica album, which
went on to win the inaugaural 1992 Mercury Prize.

In the interim between Madchester and Britpop, a new British indie pop flourished that
included dance-influenced guitar bands, indie-influenced dance outfits and the gear
changing hits of both the grunge spearhead that was Nirvana and those American alternative
rockers REM.

Alongside Primal Scream's Movin' On Up are performances from The Late Show, Top of the Pops
and other shows by the likes of Ride, Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Pop Will Eat Itself, KLF,
Massive Attack, Nirvana and REM, alongside many other intriguing moments from what was
once called the 'shoegazing' era..
