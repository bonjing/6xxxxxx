,hawk333,2011-09-22T14:40Z,"@BRAZILINDIA, No Uploads = ""suck"" second of all it does have subtitles in a file called.. oh i dunno... SUBS.rar... derp. If the subs aren't in your language it's called google, noones gonna put subs for 50 languages in their torrents just to please every one, don't be lazy and get them yourself it takes what... 2 minutes, surprised some people even have the energy to click the download button. /endrant."
