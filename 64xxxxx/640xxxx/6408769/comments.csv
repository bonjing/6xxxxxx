A/6 
V/8.5 
Good picture quality but the audio is from a CAM, itâs tinny and echoic and thereâs also some minor sync issues as well. Not a bad copy for an R5 but the audio does let this copy down... 
Many Thanx to TvTeam and LKRG for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
