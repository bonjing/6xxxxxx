Description:

Sylvester Stallone did indeed get his first movie acting role in a porn movie,
called "Party at Kitty and Stud's". This movie came out in 1970, when Sly was
24 years old, living in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, and working a variety
of menial jobs (including cinema usher) while trying to break into the movies.
At that time (and still to a lesser extent) New York City was the hub of US
porn film making. Stallone is the leading man in this X film, and he later acknowledged in a Playboy interview that he was paid $200 for his role. Unlike
his later films, Stallone seems to have had no part in directing or producing
"Party at Kitty and Stud's".
