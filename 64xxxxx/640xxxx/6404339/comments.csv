Very good film!

My first ever 3D movie experience at home -I liked it very much.

Though the film got mixed reactions/reviews.

This film is about John Milton (Nicolas Cage) who has broken out of Hell to kill Jonah King (Billy Burke), a cult leader who tricked Milton's daughter into joining his followers in the wake of Milton's death, only to kill her and her husband and steal their baby daughter - Milton's granddaughter - to be sacrificed in a Satanist ritual.

,corxbeans,2012-02-10T23:46Z,I put this on my harddrive to watch on my panasonic 3d tv and when i start it the audio is cutting in and out its like lil pops word after word then i try skipping a few chapters then freezes. Is it not really compatiable for the tv or there something wrong with the audio rip or what like i really thought this would work and its supposed too be good in 3d. Anyone got any suggestions?
