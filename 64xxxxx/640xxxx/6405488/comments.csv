,dude8888,2011-05-20T19:26Z,"Hi RajMahal
Video is great
But this is the first one of yours that I am having sound trouble
Majority of sound is coming from right side only
(tried various PC players & on the TV)

BTW: your rips are some of the best out there"
,ratfarts,2011-05-21T01:34Z,"I'm having the same issue as dude888 these past couple of days RajMahal.  I tend to favor downloading your releases over the others because of how high the quality is in relation to the overall size of the file.  However I downloaded your release of Barney's Version yesterday and the sound is definitely affected in some way.  Perhaps it has something to do with the recent transition to AC-3.  The exact symptoms I am getting is that while there is still sound out of the left channel, it is subdued and lower in volume compared to the right channel.  Also, it only seems to be background noise from the left channel.  When the actors speak the dialog only comes out of the right channel.

I hope this helps and I hope you are able to resolve the issue.  Your downloads are usually excellent.  Keep up the good work."
,tazzmania1990,2011-05-22T10:03Z,something wrong with the sound...  =\   video is good though! and so is the movie. thanks.
[V],RajMahal,2011-05-22T11:39Z,"@ all having problems with audio.

Please change the audio settings in vlc from stereo to reverse stereo.
If that doesn't work then try using Mono and let me know if you notice any difference."
,fillinthisspace,2011-05-23T14:02Z,"Assuming the audio has the same problem as your encode of Barney's Version, reversing stereo settings probably won't help (I don't use VLC).

Your AC3 encoder is for some reason getting the channel assignments wrong. It seems to be encoding the centre channel as the right channel (hence the majority of vocals only coming from the right speaker) and the front right channel as the centre channel."
,fillinthisspace,2011-05-23T14:16Z,"For those who use MPC-HC or ffdshow to decode the audio, both have an option for custom audio channel mapping, so you could re-map the centre channel back to the centre and the right to the right while watching this movie. If you're really keen you could re-encode the audio using ffdshow to correct the audio channel mapping on the way through.

If you're using VLC there's no custom channel mapping for you (I just checked and couldn't find any) but you do have the option to mono the audio."

,Quality2Screen,2011-09-25T02:13Z,"very nice definition, poor audio though. 

wal0000 fuck you man!"
,stalker277,2012-01-08T02:43Z,"If you use ffdshow, just swap the center with the right channel in the mixer.

Someone must've had a lousy endocding day..."
,aussietracker,2012-01-14T02:18Z,"all good, works for me"
