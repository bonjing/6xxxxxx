,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-18T18:38Z,This needs fw 3.60. It will not play with cfw 3.55 on JB PS3.
[V],.BONE.,2011-05-18T19:29Z,yes fw 3.60
,Marques777,2011-05-18T19:43Z,so how do i make it work with 3.55kmeaw?
,dnite74,2011-05-18T20:03Z,Please upload Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-18T20:24Z,"@Marques777. You can't. This game only works on legit PS3s with OFW 3.60 and up. Maybe someone will manage to patch it, who knows."
,Darkvelvet,2011-05-19T04:58Z,Please someone make this work for Kmeaw Firmware 3.55.  Thanks!
,AlwaysWasted,2011-05-19T08:45Z,First the ppl who clicked - quality on this should go fuck themselves second this game and 3.60+ have been causing some ps3s to overheat so there is a chance that when they patch that it will work like with brink
,pratik23,2011-05-19T12:21Z,thanx....working on my ps3....just open multiman new version and click on this game and it wil say to ptach the param.sfo..click on yes.ur dne....thanx
,gpstorrentz,2011-05-19T13:35Z,"@pratik23 

Is this for real :D would be great man, i will try this..."
,pratik23,2011-05-19T19:43Z,yes this shit works man
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-19T19:53Z,"Just tried it. You get Error 80010017 'An error occurred during the start operation'. As all the forums will tell you, this does not work yet on cfw3.55. Patching the param.sfo in Multiman DOES NOT WORK.
@pratik23, fuck off and troll somewhere else asshole."
,black_shadow_1981,2011-05-19T20:10Z,"im playing this on my flashed 360, haveing 3 discs is gay tho, i miss my ps2 but it got the yellow light of death i had it fixed (not by sony) then in 4 weeks it died again :(

anyways the game is good, i was thinking about getting a ps3 with jail brake but dont know alot about it can someone fill me in?"
,black_shadow_1981,2011-05-19T20:11Z,i typed ps2 but i ment ps3!
,BrikHaus,2011-05-20T03:54Z,"@Rapier_Wit
Patching the param.sfo is only half of what you need to do. You also need to build or download an EBOOT.bin. Then Patch the game. 

Don't be such a fucking douche bag because you have no idea what you are doing."
,GTOnizuka,2011-05-20T07:55Z,So this works on CFW 3.55 with EBOOT.bin fix????
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-20T10:08Z,"@BrikHaus. 
My comment was aimed at pratik23 and his just fix the param.sfo file bullshit. I know you need an EBOOT.bin fix. I've got a PS3 full of games and have a clue. And 'douche bag'? My wife insults me better than that."
,Rapier_Wit,2011-05-20T11:55Z,EBOOT & param.sfo cfw3.55 fix is now out. Search the forums for details. I would put a link but got banned before for doing this so it's up to you to search it.

-copy with multiman to internal hd on ps3
-run the pkg file patch from the links provided above
- run the game in multiman with select + X

enjoy ;)"
,josevaldo,2011-05-20T22:14Z,"I am certain that this game has a fix and it can work on kmeaw 3.55, i just dont know if this torrent has the actual game working, can someone that downloaded it confirm if it works using the fixes? "

i have heard that all ps3 games are region free like i can play US versions on PAL ps3 please someone confirms if it is true.

Can i Play this game on my PAL ps3 

Thanks"
,AlwaysWasted,2011-05-21T04:53Z,@josevaldo europe version just came out today
,darkalex1,2011-05-21T04:56Z,"Common people seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
10hrs of download and only 15% download...my d/u ratio is 1.562"
,GTOnizuka,2011-05-21T06:51Z,"Works great with the fix!! follow the link above!
Those of you who are still not sure of how...

If your copy is Europe version then just copy it to the internal hdd then load it up with Multiman using select + X then it will ask you about param.sfo changing to 3.55. Click 'ok'.
once you are back on ps3 XMB, install the package then select + X the LA noire straight from the PS3 XMB screen and you are on the way!"
,darkalex1,2011-05-21T11:07Z,"@GTOnizuka

Are you facing any overheat issue? Since you said its working then could you explain how?
Do I just let multiman to change the PARAM.sfo? I cant really understand how to change PARAM.sfo to Bles? do I just rename it?

Thanks mate"
,AlwaysWasted,2011-05-21T11:09Z,@Resistance2010 yes
,AlwaysWasted,2011-05-21T13:42Z,@darkalex1 google PS3SFOEdit use it and edit the PARAM.sfo its easy
,geuheo28,2011-05-21T14:20Z,this is not the game -> fake torrent! (don't download it)
,GTOnizuka,2011-05-21T21:22Z,"@darkalex1 - I haven't noticed any overheating issue as some people were complaining in forums..this overheating problem only occurs when you have OFW 3.60 or over and playing LA Noire on it. 

As to param.sfo....if your copy is a europe version, the game will already start with bles so when you load it with Multiman, just push select + X buttons at the same time then it will pop up with a message saying someting like ' param.sfo needs to be 3.55...' just push 'ok' then this will have changed the param.sfo automatically. You can do this manually by grabbing a copy of sfo editor and doing so on pc. Whichever you do it, they all work fine. Once you have that changed, on PS3 xmb, install the fix package - you can find  this by searching on google or the piratebay. Then you are on your way to play LA Noire on CFW 3.55! "
,StaylinShite,2011-05-21T22:50Z,"Thanks, works perfect with 3.55 Kmeaw and MM 2.00 after patch and PARAM.sfo edit. Sweet."
