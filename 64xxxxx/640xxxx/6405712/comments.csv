Has a good activation or crack or something ever been found?"

Obviously vuca89 has a little problem with English and does not deserve your ridicule, after all you have been banging on about this for ever and a day. Are you so concerned that your uploads may be bettered by others? Why are you so threatened that you immediately condemn any Microsoft office 2010 upload as not possibly being as good as yours? Nobody has cracked MS office 2010 apart from using activators (not permanent) or lying to Microsoft over the phone for activation, not even you ""genius."" So what I think vuca89 was trying to say was ""shut the fuck up"" and I second his/her motion. "
