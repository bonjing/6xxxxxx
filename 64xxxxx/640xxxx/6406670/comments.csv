,Karlston,2011-05-20T07:38Z,"@wtfgamer... up near the top it says ""Language.....: English"""
,chris1010,2011-05-20T18:01Z,if POSTMORTEM does not keep up with patches and updates they should not release anything anyway...either they take up stuff and release it or not... but cherrypicking and doin just half of the work is for boys and not for men...
,Atkecar,2011-05-20T19:55Z,NOT WORKING..!!!!
,TorrentChick,2011-05-20T20:17Z,"Could not get it to work, says it is missing "" binkw32.dll "" When I downloaded the dll it still would not work. I am reinstalling it now. Also when it installs it names the folder River of Time :P"
,v3n0m0us,2011-05-21T01:20Z,"There are two possible things going on :

1- The release just doesn't work. 
2- No matter where you choose for the setup to install the game you will get a River of Time folder with contents of the expansion pack. Should you copy that entire folder over your original River of Time folder ( where the previous game is installed ) you will overwrite few files ( main exe and few others ) and like that the game will start ( both versions cracked ). 

Now here is the thing, i don't see the separate campaign but i heard that it will be available somewhere during the game or at the end of the original campaign. Since i don't have save games i can't check it out and it's a long game for me to start over only to get to a dead end. 

If someone can confirm that indeed this expansion adds a chapter after the original campaign then you can use the solution i mentioned above to play it. "
,Karlston,2011-05-22T01:48Z,"OK... I think I have this worked out. Firstly, the install defaults to the ""Drakensang The River of Time"" folder, my River of Time had been installed in the ""Drakensang - The River of Time"" folder. Notice the ""-"" in there?

After launching RoT and restoring the latest RoT save it says the quest A Guard in Trouble has been updated, and I believe that's where the addon is added. More info here...

,Karlston,2011-05-22T01:54Z,"Oh... one thing I forgot, during install, after browsing to select the correct install folder, it sometimes returns ""Drakensang - The River of Time/Drakensang - The River of Time/"" as the install folder. If that happens, before clicking Next,  edit it so the path ends in just a single ""Drakensang - The River of Time/"""
,v3n0m0us,2011-05-23T16:57Z,"@Karlston 

Ha i definitely failed to see that even after you select the folder yourself he still adds the additional one at the end. 

Anyways, it works like that folks. "
,robert1815,2011-06-12T18:39Z,"I have trouble with this one... The ""paul.dll"" file is detected as menace by my antivirus. Plus I can't pass the part where they ask for the cd key."
,Kamianbu,2011-06-17T05:51Z,"@robert1815

Yeah, that's nothing new or surprising. Just add that file as an exception to your virus scanner and such. That paul.dll is the file which has serial key in it that allows the game to... ""not"" pop up the Hand over the serial key window.

The file is safe, just a false alarm by your virus scanner."
,5t0rmy,2011-09-19T23:03Z,unable to start game as it states wrong disc is inserted
,5t0rmy,2011-09-21T16:17Z,"Ah, got it to work, thanks!"
,nilgrib,2011-10-22T13:57Z,"HI, I signed up only to comment. The game says ""This software needs to be activated before use. Please enter activation code"" Now what do I do? PLEASE HELP!!!!! I'll die if I can't play this............"
,nilgrib,2011-10-22T14:03Z,"Is there a serial? Or is there a crack that works? The file paul.dll is in the installation folder by default installation, yet the activation window pops up. what do I do.....?"
,nilgrib,2011-10-23T15:46Z,"ah ok, i got it. i chose the 'drakensang - river of time' folder by browsing, and removed the extra 'drakensang river of time' from the selection. installed, replaced the original paul.dll with the paul.dll in the postmortem folder and everything works like a charm. Hey good work guys :)  "
,cifla,2012-02-16T18:50Z,"can someone upload savegame of river of time(finished game) pls i dont want to play it trough again just to play this.

,Pyromanther,2012-04-24T21:29Z,"This really a virus?
