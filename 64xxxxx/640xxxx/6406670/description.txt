     "Phileasson's Secret" continues the popular Drakensang

     franchise with an epic new chapter. Phileasson is one of

     the most important characters in the world of "The Dark

     Eye" and his story is very popular among pen & paper

     fans, fitting perfectly within the Drakensang series.



     Ending some weeks before the events of 'River of Time',

     the "Phileasson Campaign" enjoys a similar setting and

     atmosphere, creating a great opportunity for expanding

     the adventures of the famous Thorwaler Phileasson.
