this is a remux man, the VC-1 video was never touched. a clockwork orange always had this unusual aspect ratio."

After I open the file, it just sits at 00:00 with a black screen."

In MPC HC go View>Options>Internal Filters  and then, in the right-hand column, check the box that says ""VC1 (DXVA)"" next to it.  Apply, and you're good to go!  Hope I helped some people out.  Anyways, enjoy the movie!"
