,Adrila,2011-06-15T07:21Z,"I can't play .mkv formats in my DivX player... I've been searching for hours on torrents with .avi files of season 2 but there are like none on the entire internet it seems. Dx
Do you know how I can convert .mkv fild to .avi files? Or a player that is compatible with .mkv files? When I downloaded DivX I swear it said it could play .mkv files. it lied. :C
Please reply asap! >."
,Son_of_X51,2011-06-16T20:44Z,"Adrila,

VLC can play .mkv files (and just about any other format).  Just search for vlc and it should be the first result.

Good luck!"
,IndustrialMilk,2011-07-10T02:34Z,"Luckily my Tv plays .mkv, but my ps3 doesnt :("
,emptypiro,2011-07-12T09:59Z,"You could also use the GOM player provided by GOMTV.net

it plays practically practically every file type there is, if there's one it doesn't use i haven't found it yet"
,Alexnader78,2011-08-02T21:09Z,Awseome stuff !! thanks a lot.
,billymartin2,2011-08-20T04:26Z,cheers dude
,Turiluca,2011-09-04T22:13Z,"Use VLC to play .mkv files, its free and awesome"
,BtoTrick,2011-09-06T20:42Z,Has anybody noticed how much more fun cartoons are to watch on drugs nowadays? Coincidence?  
,Valedict,2011-10-16T18:41Z,"@BtoTrick 

Market research."
,MOSHP1T,2011-12-10T03:24Z,Anyone trying to convert to avi or mpeg just search for Total Video Converter. 
,ninjakaze,2011-12-14T03:08Z,@IndustrialMilk get a program for your comp called PS3mediaserver it allows you not only to access your computers video and music over wireless network it will encode all files to be playable on your ps3 :D does take a bit of setup tho
,danielsrb,2011-12-23T02:50Z,@Adrila VLC player is the one that I use. MKV files give me no sweat :)
,Zeo7,2012-02-17T19:21Z,"thanks! will seed to 1.0 :D

season 3??????????"
,Zeo7,2012-02-17T19:24Z,"does anyone know wy my ps3 won't play all eps but only a few?

(works fine for pc btw..)"
,SickofReality,2012-03-25T10:03Z,"Okay, if you want them just for computer view, I would highly recommend VLC Player. But if you want them for DVD Player, then I would highly recommend AVS Video Converter(with crack of course) just seach for it here on thepiratebay and MAKE SURE YOU PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS WHEN INSTALLING(I can't stress that enough!!)

Thank you for the awesome torrent!"
,_Rozen_,2012-03-29T00:27Z,"@Adrila 

Use GOMplayer, it basically plays ALL files. Extremely helpful"
,CandiedHaggis,2012-04-02T02:51Z,"Everyone always rushes to say ""Use VLC!"". While VLC is a great media player, some older computers will just not play .mkv files smoothly. Mine has that problem. I can play .avi at high bitrate, and nearly anything else except .mkv's are all pixellated and choppy. I've used VLC, WMP, Media Player Classic, Nero MP, and every other one available. Updated codecs installed and uninstalled codec packs, nothing works. Just a slow CPU. 
This is a great cartoon, though. I think I'll convert these to .avi format and reupload for those of us with Matroska issues."
,loosenoose,2012-04-03T11:18Z,"I use a program called Bigasoft MKV Converter to convert all my MKVs to AVIs (so I can watch them on my PS3). It's so ridiculously easy to use. This is usually a program that you have to pay for but thanks to Pirate Bay, I found the program WITH a crack for it, all in one torrent! Fuck yeah piracy! Lol"
,magictoytle,2012-04-11T23:21Z,"The first five seconds or so run smoothly with each episode but then the episode ends. Is this some kind of bug or am I just doing something wrong and being stupid? 
I use VLC and I've never had this kind of problem."
,lolrofl345,2012-04-29T09:46Z,i think you can convert mka. files with a program called total video converter but im not quite sure :/
,ticks619,2012-05-08T19:43Z,seeders please
,kugasvin,2012-06-07T16:28Z,Thanks! Great show!
