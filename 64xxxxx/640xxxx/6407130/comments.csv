,xpmule,2011-12-29T22:55Z,"Good stuff but season 7 is mixed up and random..
ep 1 to 4 seem to be dvdrip's and then 5-8 seem to be tv rips then 9 seems to be a dvdrip and then 10 to 12 seem to be back to tv rips..
Also a couple of the files in season 7 are avi/xvid
and a few are avc/mkv but 720p (tv rip)

So whats the deal then ?
It says in the torrent info DVD vol.1-7
So ???

And no offence but hardcoded subs are pretty lame.
Luckily it was easy to remove them all

Also i havn't checked andything up to season 7
im assuming that season 1-6 are dvd rips (as stated)
If not ? i'll be back to warn everyone else ;)"
,xpmule,2011-12-31T14:31Z,"thanks again for sharing and i added a torrent

I have no idea why it would seem that way to you. They are all ripped from the same VOL1 dvds (actually last two episodes from season one are on VOL2).

It is exactly what it says - DVDrip volumes 1 through 7 (+ rest of the episodes - which are not DVDrips as they are not on the VOL7 DVDs + DVDrip of the movie).
There are SIX episodes from season 6 and FIVE episodes from season 7 on VOLUME 7 DVDs. The rest are HDTV (720p) rips and two SDTV rips - only versions available at the time of creating this torrent.

I agree - hardcoded subs are pretty lame. That's why I don't do them. If they were hardcoded you wouldn't be able to remove them. At least not easily.


I wanted to put all this in the info but Edit torrent function is not working..."
,xpmule,2012-01-12T17:01Z,"Well nice to see a reply and hey buddy good job on the encoding i think the results are great.
You went with quality in mind i can tell awesome !

And i didn't know about the split seasons on the volumes.. that would make things make sense then, as in why VCDVault did half and aAF did half but its weird because of the episode numbering, its like they skip a few etc

And yeah the hard coded subs are NOT removable, my earlier long speel doesn't make as much sense now that I'm reading it, i just meant to say its better (in my opinion) to have subs in separate files, i never use them but i really don't want to seem ungrateful though

I used MKVToolnix to strip out the subs but i ran into problems with ""S02E16 - Broodwich"" and had to do a lot of messing around to remove the subs on that one, also it was the only one with 48khz audio.

Anyway, i'd recommend this to everyone !

Video Container = MKV (Matroska)

Seasons 1 - 4 are (4:3) aspect ratio
Video = AVC 1700kps*avg 640x480 at 29.970
Audio = MP3 112kbps CBR 44.1khz 2 channels

Seasons 5 - 7 are (16:9) aspect ratio
Video = AVC 1700kps*avg 720x406 at 29.970
Audio = MP3 112kbps CBR 44.1khz 2 channels"
