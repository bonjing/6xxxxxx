- last two studio albums (2006 + 2008) -

One Shot are playing finest jazz rock in "first half of the Seventies" tradition, mostly influenced by bands like Mahavishnu Orchestra or Return To Forever. The steady rhythms and repetitive bass patterns evoke some flavour of Zeuhl relationships.

If you like Mahavishnu Orchestra or e-guitar driven, straight ahead jazz rock, this is for you!
