,kaz050,2011-05-18T02:27Z,thank you works great no problems 
,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-05-18T02:59Z,"I just used this patch/crack, during install made sure that I had the proper directory. Install seemingly went smooth, but every time I try to launch the game it gives an error message 'You can't run the game directly from fable3.exe. Please use FableLauncher.exe'. And obviously I'm using fablelauncher.exe. Am I just fucking stupid or do more people have this problem?"
,dmfyrespray,2011-05-18T08:29Z,yes i have same problem :(
,IceC0ldxXx,2011-05-18T12:37Z,"The crack works like a charm, you have to allow it in your anti-virus. why? i read on a virus definition site that it behaves like a virus and mixes with codes WITHIN the game map ONLY, which is needed to actually play the game without cd or cd-key

1. Install the game - enter cd key 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
2.Install the patch
3. Put the crack in */program files/microsoft games/fable 3

"

,waraewra,2011-05-18T13:00Z,"""Wrong Disc Inserted""

PATCH/CRACK DOES NOT WORK."
,IceC0ldxXx,2011-05-18T13:19Z,"xlive.dll is a file from ""Games for windows"". download the games for windows program and it's solved."
,IceC0ldxXx,2011-05-18T13:23Z,xlive.dll problem. google Games for windows and download the games for windows program
,nugry7,2011-05-18T18:28Z,when i open the game i have to register on games for windows live. after i do that i have to get the register key any way to get that exept byuing it ???
,Knightwing15,2011-05-18T19:18Z,"Ok, normally never have a problem with any torrents, but getting a lot of flak on this one.

Basically, torrent installs fine. Didn't try and play it. Installed update, and didn't authorise it then either. Got paul.dll to my folder after some hassle with AVG. However, getting wrong disc inserted/no disc inserted depending on whether I have the iso mounted or not. Tried every executable in the F3 folder. Solutions?"
,erikn95,2011-05-18T22:08Z,How can I make an OFFLINE games for windows live profile?
