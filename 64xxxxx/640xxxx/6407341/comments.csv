,dougcjohn,2011-05-27T15:37Z,"ISO File link is slow & paused at 82% done pending Seeders get back online. Versions for Windows Link files are also going slow or paused too.  Concerning DMG; downloaded a different DMG OSx and it runs but continues to prompt to be burned to DVD. I'm not strong in MAC OS, is there a utility to convert a DMG to a ISO or to burn a DMG to DVD as a bootable Install DVD. "
,Mimergt,2011-05-29T17:49Z,79.8% Pleas Seed the full file... I really need It
,milkytech,2011-05-30T18:55Z,"@dougcjohn

if you are already using a Mac OS, then just do what it says and burn it to a Dual Layer DVD using the Disc Utility.   You cannot install the OS from a mounted dmg file.  either burn to disc or create a bootable thumb drive

Don't know why it still shows 0 seeders.  I have uploaded 8.8 GB of data and the file is only 6.2 GB"

,arainc,2011-06-05T08:28Z,"This does not work for all macbooks.  This appears to be a DVD that came with a macbook vs a retail copy that will work with any mac machine, such as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5068890/Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard_%28Final_Retail%29 .  It's best to get the retail version, then just download the 10.6.6 and 10.6.7 combo update directly from apple website, if you need them."
,krakkajax,2011-06-25T05:40Z,"@arainc and all other noobs...
This is ripped from a gray restore dvd for a macbook pro. Some of us can't use a 10.6.0 DVD to do an install because our machines are new, and 10.6.0 and 10.6.3 Retail DVD's do not contain the newest drivers that this one does. Fuckin newbies!
Thanks Milkytech!!! restored to a USB drive and installed on a MBP Feb 2011 model. Works great. Keep up the good up's ;-P"

,ac1d_burn,2011-11-23T11:33Z,"thank you SO much. I lost the install discs to my 2010 MBP, and it came with a newer version of snow leopard, so the retail downloads of 10.6 and 10.6.3 weren't working for me. thank you for this never version of SL, much appreciated!"
