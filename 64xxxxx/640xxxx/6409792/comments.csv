,squall14716,2011-06-14T08:09Z,"""Seasons 1-4 complete + all the Webisodes and Revenge of the Nerds. Season 1, 2 & 3 are DVDRip and season 4 HDTV.""

The few season 2 episodes I've checked are NOT DVDRips. At the very least episodes 19, 21, and 22 aren't. Season 3 episode 1 isn't as well. I was downloading this to replace my TV rips with DVD rips, so that makes those two seasons of this torrent unfit for that purpose. The few episodes of season 1 I've checked seems fine, and obviously season 4 isn't on DVD yet.

While I appreciate the torrent and all and don't want to seem ungrateful, it'd be nice if you didn't spread disinformation about what is in it. :("
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-30T02:42Z,I've just checked and it seems that a few episodes are HDTV rips rather than DVD rips as I have said. The episodes are fine but not what I had stated. This was not done deliberately and when season 5 has finished they will all be replaced with DVD rips. I was going to delete this torrent and re-upload it but as the episodes are fine I'll leave it and wait for season 5 to finish.

Some episodes (only about 2) have minor audio glitches but not worth searching for another torrent.  
S02E20 and S02E21 are flip flopped so play them in reverse order.  Thanks to the uploader."
,crimsonvipor,2011-10-28T15:35Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Swap the title names as soon as you download the episodes. I was really confused throughout the whole episode.
