Chuck is an action-comedy television program from the United States created by Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak. The series is about an "average computer-whiz-next-door" who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working in the CIA; the message embeds the only remaining copy of the world's greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.

Produced by College Hill Pictures, Fake Empire, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8/7c. Season 5 will air on Friday nights at 8/7c. The show was aired in India and the rest of south Asia on Animax.

Chuck was renewed and began in January 2010 for a third season following a campaign mounted by fans to have the network renew the show. A major sponsorship deal between NBC and the Subway restaurant chain was also announced to help cover costs of the third season. A fourth season was picked up by NBC and began airing on NBC's fall 2010 schedule. The season finale entitled "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger" was aired on Monday, May 16, 2011. NBC officially renewed it for a fifth and final season on May 13, 2011. NBC has confirmed a fall 2011 return on Friday nights at 8/7c.
