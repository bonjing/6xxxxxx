SEE: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2534111

WHAT WAS ISSUE: 

"Consider the following scenario:
You try to install Windows 7 by starting the computer from installation media that is integrated with Windows 7 Service Pack 1.
During the initial installation, you set the Time and Currency Format setting to a locale other than English, Finnish, German, or
 Swedish. Or, the locale was selected for you before you purchased your computer.
A computer name that contains non-ASCII characters is entered in the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) Wizard.
In this scenario, you receive an error message that resembles the following:
Computer name cannot contain only numbers, may not be identical with the user name and cannot contain spaces. Retype the name of the 
computer.
Note See the "More information" section for a list of accepted characters.

A computer name that contains non-ASCII characters may be entered during the OOBE Wizard in one of the following situations:
You manually enter a computer name that contains a non-ASCII character.
You manually enter a user name that contains a non-ASCII character.
Note The default computer name is automatically generated based on the user name. Therefore, if the user name contains a non-ASCII 
character, the default computer name will also contain a non-ASCII character.
Your language setting is Russian, Croatian, Ukrainian, or Thai.
Note The default computer name is automatically generated by appending â€œ-PCâ€ to the user name. In Russian, Croatian, Ukrainian, or 
Thai, the translation of â€œ-PCâ€ contains non-ASCII characters. Therefore, the default computer name will also contain non-ASCII characters."

SOO MICROSOFT INTEGRATED NEW HOTFIX TO THE WINDOWS 7 DVD AND RELEASED IN 12.05.2011. SOO I MADE THIS DVD FROM THAT RELEASE.

FOR DETAILED INFOTMATION: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2534111


I HAVE INTEGRATED MSDaRT TOOLSET TO WINDOWS 7 DVD.ITS VERY USEFUL TOOLS KIT.

What is MSDART?



Did you lost your files due to virus infections? Or was it the sudden loss of power that wiped out all your documents? John may have
 inadvertently 
reformatted the hard drive and your computer would not boot anymore.

Disasters come in unexpected times and if you lost your computer data due to the aforementioned causes, you will need a utility that 
is called MSDART,
 Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset. Recover data instantly with this utility from Microsoft.

Deleted files and reformatted drives are usually recoverable if no further additional damage follows. And MSDART may be able to recover 
them.

MSDART lets you fix a corrupted, unbootable Windows XP or Windows Vista installation. It contains several tools designed specifically for 
diagnostics 
and recovery.

Versions of MSDART
MSDART has two versions available. MS-DART version 5 is specifically designed for use with Microsoft Windows XP and MSDART Version 6 is 
for Microsoft 
Windows Vista.




How does MSDART Work?

In order to use MSDART, it has to be booted from a CDROM drive. During the boot up process and before MSDART completely loads it scans any
 installed
 hard disk and checks if it can find an installed Windows XP or Windows Vista and if it finds one, it will ask you if you want to attach 
to the installed
 operating system. Attaching to an operating system will let you access its Windows Registry and other system files as if you booted from 
it. If you do not 
attach to an operating system, MSDART will boot itself and treat the installed disk drive as if it does not have any installed operating 
system.

MSDART Tools and Utilities
Registry Editor - program for accessing the system registry. It lets modify system and application program settings and configurations.

Locksmith - unlocks the user and administration password. If you forgot your password for logging into Windows, this utility will let you 
reset and change 
the password.

Crash Analyzer - this is a debugging tool meant to be used by highly trained technical personnel.

File Restore - restores deleted files and programs.

Disk Commander - a tool for managing the different files

Disk Wipe - this is a privacy tool designed to completely delete the contents of a disk drive. When you delete or format a drive, data and 
information may 
still exists on the hard which may be accessed and recovered by computer forensic tools. Using Disk Wipe will completely delete the disk
 drive making any 
data recovery impossible.

Computer Management - this program includes the system administration tools like the Event Viewer, Shared Folder, Local Users and Groups,
 Performance Logs 
and Alerts and Device Manager, Disk Defragmenter, Disk Management, and many more.

Explorer - this utility is similer to Windows explorer.

Solution Wizard - walks thru different problem scenarios and suggest solution on how to fix it.

TCP/IP Config - provides the necessary tools to configure the Local Area Network adapter.

Hotfix Uninstall - sometimes hotfixes or security patches causes side-effects and prevent the system from functioning properly. This 
utility allows you to
 uninstall any hotfix that may be causing any problem.

Search - lets you do full searches for any file or directory.

Clean Room Data Recovery - With more companies specializing in data recovery services, one particular aspect that has importance is what 
type of facility 
are you sending your hard drives into for that special data recovery. There are facilities that don't treat hard drives with the most care
 when they are 
trying to recover your data, however they bill you like they do. There are also recovery methods and facilities that take extraordinary
 precautions with 
your hard drive and data. These facilities employ clean room data recovery methods.

Data Recovery When The Hard Drive Initialization Fails - The computer hard drive is a primary data storage device, which is used for 
permanent and reliable
 data storage. Hard drive stores digital information on moving hard drive platters. But in some situations, your BIOS (Basic Input/Output
 System) can not 
recognize your hard drive and thus the system does not boot up.

Data Recovery after Damage to Hard Drive Head Alignment System - Several computer hard drives contain read/write heads and servo head 
mounted for 
concurrent movement by the actuator arm in response to the servo signal from server head. In such drives the positions of read/write heads
 are separately
 adjustable with respect to servo head.

Frequently Asked Questions


Q: Will I be able to download new Updates when they come out?
A: Yes.

Q: Can I mount this with DAEMON Tools and install it that way?
A: No. I'd recommend either burning this to a DVD (or to a USB Device bigger than 6GB) and doing a 
Clean Install. Just make sure you've backed up all your data.

Q: Will this work with BootCamp (Macintosh)?
A: It has been reported that it does, but not personally tested by myself.

Q: Why does my PC take a long time at "Windows is Finalising settings"?
A: This is because all the extra programs like .NET are installed now, so it wlil take a few mintues, 
definately not hours. Some systems have been known to hang at this point, however this is not a 
major problem and will not damage your Windows Installation.

Q: Can this be used as an upgrade from Windows Vista (or XP)?
A: It should be able to, but if you are running XP/Vista 32-Bit you can only install Windows 7 32-Bit. 
A clean install is suggested anyways and if nessecary if you are running 32-Bit and wanting to install
64-Bit, and vice versa (64-Bit XP/Vista cant install Windows 7 32-Bit I don't think).

Q: Can I install IE9 RC?
A: Yes, you can but it is too buggy by now and you will be in trouble because it cannot be uninstalled if you do not like it! 



IMPORTANT: PLEASE FIRST INSTALL ON VIRTUAL MACHINE FOR TESTING PURPOSE AND BE SURE THAT SYSTEM WORKS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM !

THE LANGUAGE THAT SELECTED IN THE FIRST WINDOWS MUST BE SAME WITH THE WINDOWS 7 EDITION LANGUAGE !!!
