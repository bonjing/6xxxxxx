...................................NFO:.................................................Hood 2 Hood, The Blockumentary is an action packed film that takes you on a tour through America's
highest crime rated neighborhoods. Rich Kid Entertainment contacted all the underground hood
connections from hoods across the country from California to New York, to the South and Midwest.
Their connections opened the doors to their hoods and allowed them to capture the day-to-day
actions of life in a crime-infested neighborhoods. Film crews have never had access to footage like
this, that includes everything from several pounds of marijuana and kilos of cocaine, fully
automatic assault rifles, beatdowns, and thousands in cash earned in drug sales.

They traveled to over 29 different cities and neighborhoods that included the actual neighborhoods
of today's top rap artists such as EMINEM (8 MILE), JAY-Z (MARCY PROJECTS), SUGE KNIGHT (ROSE
CRANS ST), JUVENILE (MAGNOLIA PROJECTS), NAS (QUEENS BRIDGE PROJECTS) and many more. This film
contains exclusive interviews with real gang members, drug dealers, pimps and killers. Viewers be
prepared to witness controversial and violent never seen before footage. Hood 2 Hood, The
Blockumentary is reality T.V at its best!!!!!!
