This is the backup of www.13-thirtyseven.com 's old cracked minecraft server.  (we have a new one now.)
This is a map that had 9737 different names of people log into this server.  So it's the perfect map to wonder around on single-player for hours looking at thousand's of people's hours of work.  Or you can start a server, duplicating mine.  all my server mods are even included in the pack!
if you do host a server, post it here to get more players:  http://www.13-thirtyseven.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=5

So this is a great map for building inspiration, or marveling for hours.  I fell down on keeping stuff pretty near the end, so there are most likly some pretty ugly structures near spawn now, but it shouldn't be too bad.

The map is around 450 MB uncompressed.






CONTENTS OF README:

for singleplayer:

just copy the "world" folder into your singleplayer saves.  stored here:
%appdata%/.minecraft/saves

for multiplayer:

this server ran bukkit.
I have included all the mods i had installed.
to get bukkit: 
http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/craftbukkit-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
download that, put it in the folder where this file is, and run.
If you want all the old players to keep their inventories, i have included everyone's inventories in a 7z file.  Just un-7z it into a folder named "players"
I have also included everyone's login password, but to protect people's lives, it is in a password-protected 7z-file.  If you REALLY want to clone the old server, you can ask for it here:
