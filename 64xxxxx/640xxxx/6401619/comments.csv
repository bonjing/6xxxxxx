,DaramoeX,2011-05-19T12:26Z,"Great torrents, thanks!  But, Fearless was released in 2008 and Speak Now was released in 2010.  Thanks for the UL!"
[T],rjordan21,2011-05-19T14:40Z,"^^^ sorry! my mistake.... 

The folders are incorrectly labeled within the torrent as well. It should be:

Taylor Swift 2006
Fearless      2008
Speak Now  2010"
,the_big_a,2011-05-30T22:36Z,"download took FOREVER and it doesn't play the songs. it's a blank space. that's cool, thanks."
[T],rjordan21,2011-06-03T16:37Z,"^^^ To date this torrent has been downloaded +/- 250 times and at one point at over 500 kbs/sec.  It remains to be well seeded. There is nothing wrong with the files.

It must be on your end.  Check your download speed.... what media player are you using? "
,kILLkoa,2011-06-07T22:12Z,"@ the_big_a..

You ungrateful moron. First of all, it's free so don't even bitch. Second of all, it's FLAC. You just can't try and open it with iTunes or whatever program you mindlessly use because it came with your ipod, or whathave you...

to add some constructive content to this flame, google FLAC to .WAV converter you idiot.
