Plot:
An emotionally unstable college freshman (Leighton Meester) grows obsessed 
with her unsuspecting roommate (Minka Kelly) in Danish director Christian E. 
Christiansen's English-language debut. Trouble begins after a frat party, 
when Kelly's Sara character comes back to her dorm room smashed, pausing to 
meet her roommate, Rebecca (Meester), for the first time just before she rushes 
out of the room to puke. Both being artistic types, Rebecca gloms onto Sara's 
artistic yearnings and they both bond over couture culture, yet Rebecca's 
antisocial behavior always seems to stand in the way of them being best buds. 
Soon it becomes apparent that Rebecca's territorial side is something to be 
freaked out by, as Sara's ex-boyfriend, her pervy teacher, and anyone else that 
do the young artist harm will attest.
