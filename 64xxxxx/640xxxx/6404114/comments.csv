,cronocr,2011-06-16T19:17Z,"thx, works great on pc, but crack fails on Mac, the file could be corrupted. I tried the patch this way:

1. went to Applications > Unity
2. left clicked on the Unity app, and selected Show Package Contents
3. opened Contents > MacOS, there I found the Unity executable, that has an prompt icon
4. replaced the file with the crack (that doesn't have the icon)
5. failed to run...

i guess the crack doesn't have the prompt icon because it is corrupted, and it doesn't run."

,Mobius96,2011-07-22T07:41Z,"I'm running Windows Vista Ultimate32bit.
Copied all the files into the C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor and I followed the instructions that were provided. The CRACK doesn't work!

I click on the exe file that included with the crack, it ask me to register. I click on manual, read license. I get the following error message: "" The file does not contain valid license and cannot be used."" I've been fucking around with this for the last a few hours !!!!  WTF I'm doing wrong? This is s really pissing me off!!!

PLEASE HELP!"

- Install Unity
- Go to the Applications->Unity
- Locate Unity.app (show extensions otherwise it will just appear as ""Unity"")
- Right click and select ""Show Package Contents""
- Go to Contents->MacOS and you should find a file called ""Unity""
- Replace that with the crack file and you should be good to go."
