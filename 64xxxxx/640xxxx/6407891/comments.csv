,Sivos,2011-05-23T02:33Z,"For a second I thought this was the actual update then I saw it was only 1MB and was like ""This is bullshit"" then I realized it says crack in the title, lol.  I just downloaded the actual update, this works fine with it, thanks for the upload.

,Philonetic,2011-06-10T10:19Z,"Comodo, NOD32, and Avast say Virus"
,Philonetic,2011-06-11T16:13Z,"Besides that, the crack that comes with update 6 works fine.

Here's a tip people.  NEVER download from anonymous uploaders."

Thanks a lot bro, your link works great! :)"
,Kaikelx,2011-06-21T21:58Z,"@Sivos: Any idea where I can get steam_api.dll from? Because the update won't install without it apparently, and when I ran the application located outside the Skidrow folder, it said it needed some random temp folder to continue (at 97% complete, which was aggravating)"
,Kaikelx,2011-06-21T22:02Z,"To clarify, it says it needs this: Rar$DI69.530\sr-fnvu6.r30 which is apparently supposed to be located in my temp folder. Also, I found the steam_api.dll thing (yay google), now trying to figure out where to put it...."
,Kaikelx,2011-06-21T22:07Z,"Gah, turns out I already had steam_api.dll in the New Vegas folder, which is odd because the application is saying it doesn't exist, and it's recommending that I reinstall New Vegas. Hah, like that would actually work (especially since I have logged quite a bit of time into it)"
,brennan10101,2011-07-07T04:41Z,love how this didnt work also as soon as i used the crack my computer came up with a message missing files and now my new vegas dosent even start up and my computer is bombarded with viruses :/
