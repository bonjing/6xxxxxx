1)image quality is a bit dark (oh well, it's a CAM)

The beginning audio offset is about 4000 milliseconds and drifts slowly, in the middle of the movie it is almost zero but not for long and then the audio starts drifting again"

[V],Horrorspoke,2011-05-21T11:33Z,"@Ace1982

It's not purposely out of sync. The Russian version has different setting compared to the English version, hence the audio from the English version is very difficult to sync-in to the video. It takes a lot of work to go through and continually adjust the audio to keep it in sync.

Plus, it's an early release, and it's free. I'm sure if you are desperate to watch it then this is the one to watch at the moment (or the BIDA version) But if you're a hardcore fan, I'm sure you'd be happy to wait for an R5 or watch at the cinema!?!
