When I try to launch game from Fable 3 folder I get this, ""The ordinal 5372 could not be located in the dynamic link library xlive.dll"" I installed the GFW, but still no dice. "

Basically, torrent installs fine. Didn't try and play it. Installed update, and didn't authorise it then either. Got paul.dll to my folder after some hassle with AVG. However, getting wrong disc inserted/no disc inserted depending on whether I have the iso mounted or not. Tried every executable in the F3 folder. Solutions?"

That happens because AVG detects a false positive, even though you have turned it of, the resident shield process still runs in the background.
Open up AVG and click tools, then advanced settings,
then look for resident sheild on the left and click excluded items.

OTHERWISE

Yes, older games like Borderlands and Call Of Duty 4 have online capabilities with the pirated versions because the security on those games weren't nearly as efficient as on some of the games today. If you want to play online so badly then buy the fucking game. You all should feel lucky that groups of people like Mafia and SKIDROW are nice enough to distribute this shit for free. They work their asses off and all you fuck wads do is scream it doesn't work or it has a virus. I haven't even finished downloading this torrent yet and I bet there's a fucking readme in the .iso I have never had as much trouble as some of you people out there. Because usually the fix is as basic as turning off the internet, or referring back to the torrent location and reading some comments. I'm done ranting.

And im aware i posted this on the other one. People need to read this and wake the fuck up."

The game is easy to install and update no problem, but when i play the game for 10 mins i get to the part where you have to pick up the guild seal, and then the screen flashes white (as it's supposed to), then a loading screen comes up and it crashes...
I have no idea what to do about it, please explain."
