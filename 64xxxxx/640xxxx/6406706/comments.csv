Before you try doing this, reinstall any existing Microsoft Office 2010

You mean ... uninstall  ? and use a office clean/remove tool no ? 

This one is pre cracked : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5624753/Microsoft_OFFICE_2010__Pro_Plus_PRECRACKED"

This method uses a batch file rather than using a trial serial number."

Chess you almost killed me with that one.
Chess don't take things so seriously. Leak is probably some 15 yr old kid taking a break for video game play.  chess000master: everybody who's NOT a web dummy knows you are the best.

As for all other, let them waste their bandwidth for all experienced users know there is NO permanent offline activator."
