What is MenuPop?

Simply put, MenuPop gives you access to the menu on any screen and on any window using a popup menu activated via hotkey.

MenuPop is not a hack and does not use or rely on any system hacks, nor does it modify your system's core functionality. It relies on standard Apple programming interfaces. Rest knowing that it has been programmed with stability, future-proofing and performance as a requirement.

Mac OS X is an amazing operating system in and of itself. Though if youâ€™ve used more than one screen on Mac OS X you may have noticed how impractical it is to have the menubar on only one monitor.

While keyboard shortcuts can help alleviate the issue, they are not the most satisfactory solution to users who are used to selecting items with the mouse/touchpad rather than the keyboard.

The other issue would be that to go out of your way to select a menu item on another screen takes you away from your point of focus (the working window). MenuPop simply gives you the menu right there on your working window when and where you need it.

MenuPop works very well with most programs. Issues may arise in applications that do not properly supply menu information.
