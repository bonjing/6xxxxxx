"See You Next Fall"

The whole family is gathering at Jay's before 
heading out to Alex's graduation ceremony 
from middle school, but while at the house, 
Jay is preoccupied hiding a botox mishap from 
everyone, Cameron is upset about Mitchell's 
habit of laughing at his expense, and Phil 
tries to sympathize with, yet also antagonize 
Claire on her impending breakdown over the 
kids growing up too fast. All of this, plus a 
faulty gate, could mean their missing Alex's 
big moment.

Enjoy :)
