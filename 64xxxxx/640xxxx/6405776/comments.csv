,AKABUR,2012-06-12T14:24Z,"Alright, it looks like a nice simple program, but it would only convent 60% of the file because it is asking me to pay for the full version...  And I don't see any cracks or serial codes... Am I the only one with this problem? "
,zaprat,2012-06-17T19:52Z,"No good, this is a trial that only converts 60% of each file, 

Does anybody know where we can find a program that works for free?"
