Recently though you started to encode them differently, with some freakishly high frame rate (60fps, even though your info still says 29.97). As a result people are having trouble playing the files (in comments for previous releases) and even though the file size is the same, the picture quality is way lower than before because of abnormally high frame rate. 
Fix for suture releases, please!"
