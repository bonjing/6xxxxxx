,pemoma,2011-05-23T21:45Z,"RC tells you it's reagion.
Region C, from what I know, is something like 'Asia, Russia and China'.
So they have to take the sound from another source, that's what 'LINE' means:
""Idioma do Audio: InglĂŞs (LINE HQ.CM8 Thanks)"""

,apurr,2011-06-01T22:51Z,"i signed up to comment on this torrent, ive downloaded this twice now and each time windows explorer will crashes when i open up the folder,there must be corrupt files in this torrent.
Do Not Download."
,apurr,2011-06-01T23:09Z,"wow my post got deleted, ha. anyways i downloaded this twice and each time windows explorer crashes, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,apurr,2011-06-02T23:28Z,"@ oorenotsoo
hey, well im not sure what other info could help, simply put after i got it i opened the folder and windows explorer would crash, dl'ed the second time to a different folder and same thing,perhaps someone is seeding a corrupted file? "
,wck,2011-06-03T11:24Z,"thanks for this. Will come back after I've watched it.
@apurr maybe you're computer just can't handle it?
If there were a corrupt file in this, everyone would be getting it, not just you. That's how these things work. One person can't just slip in a dirty file with the same size and name and fuck everything up. It's either something wrong with your comp or some software you have running. Maybe it's not downloading properly or your antivirus/firewall is crap."
,wck,2011-06-03T15:36Z,"great quality. Great use of lighting and some neat effects. The story kinda drifts around though and sometimes just gets ridiculous.
I can' believe someone actually made a movie based on the myth that you only use 20% of your brain when you really use 100% already. Apart from that though, it's not bad.

video & audio: 10/10
movie: 7/10"
,salruoth,2011-06-04T04:45Z,"The movie is based on a book, something a surprising number of people failed to grasp despite it being displayed throughout the actual movie (at least in the theatrical release, which I went to see). 

Suspending your disbelief for the period of the movie, it is an entertaining ride. However, I will say the book is much better and there are many details the movie 'glosses' over for the sake of keeping the movie at a reasonable time. The book explains things in greater detail, too. You'll have to take certain details missing in stride, though. For example, Eddie doesn't start out with a girlfriend. And the initial bit of the story, like his relationship with his ex-wife, are much different a dynamic. "
,somedude.1001,2011-06-04T17:06Z,"iirc, that bullshit myth is 10%. I moved from knowing its existence to knowing the bullshitness in short order tho, and it was like 15 years ago.

how there can be so many people still believe in and repopularizing that shit today is beyond me."
,j15tnn,2011-06-07T11:22Z,Hi new to this I'm having the same problem as @spurr windows keeps closing? any idea's
,XSCounter,2011-06-07T12:24Z,"Very good quality, thanks a lot! Has someone found proper english subtitles for this yet?"
,maxpayne1991,2011-06-07T20:32Z,"i have one simple question can anyone help me

Why 720p movies are 1280 x 536 or 1280 x 528 e.t.c.
why are they are not 1280 x 720... 
(There are some 720p movies here in 1280 x 720 resolution)"
,Blatator,2011-06-09T02:03Z,"@maxpayne1991
It depends on the aspect ratio of the movie. 1280x720 is 16/9, but many movies are shot in a ""wider"" ratio, hence the black borders on top & bottom of your TV screen.
You can have a look here for further information : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_%28image%29"

,CakeMonster,2011-06-27T19:51Z,"@maxpayne1991 

1280*720, 1600*900 and 1920*1080 are Wide screen formats, other types are not

Not everything in the whole world is made specifically for wide screen"
,DarkVOX,2011-07-05T18:25Z,"@wck, It's actually true that we only use about 20% of our brains abilities.  Most people are unable to use anymore than that."
,Darkseid_BR,2011-07-09T03:57Z,Seed!!!  Seed!! ~70kbps! Pffff....
,dezontk101,2011-07-10T05:10Z,"@DarkVOX, incorrect. Whilst we only use 5-20% of our brains power for actual tasks, the remaining is covered by our brains ""System Idle Process"" lolz.. the part that controls the heart.. limbs.. eyes.. hearing.. smell.... :D"
,tupz,2011-08-06T17:59Z,"wow. superb 720p rip. quite astonished this is only 720 too. looks more like 1080p, imo. anyway, good flick too. thx!"
