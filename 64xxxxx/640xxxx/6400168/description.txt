===============================================================
Included orginal notes:
- 192kbps mp3
Convert mp3 first to wav then put the files un2 a disc 
that way "no pauses" between the tracks.
This has nothing to do with lossless or lossy. 
It still remains mp3. 
It's only for the pauses between the tracks.
===============================================================

Couldn't put it in the mp3 section that's 
why I have put it in the flac section !!!

Keep on looking for new funky stuff !!! :)
