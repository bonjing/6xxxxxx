,setotitan,2011-05-20T23:02Z,"When you finish please seed, we all wanna see it as bad as you do. Not even breaking 50k on my DL :("
,setotitan,2011-05-20T23:35Z,Anyone else having problems viewing the sample? VLC says it's broken.
,iveseenitall,2011-05-21T05:30Z,"The sample is broken. I only get about 3 seconds out of it, but the quality looks perfect."
,Dulasync,2011-05-21T05:54Z,"I've downloaded that ""Limitless 2011 720p RC BDRip XviD LiNE AC3-MEM"", and the audio is fucked.
Don't know if this one is good? Any feedback?"
,Glenn_K9,2011-05-21T07:57Z,"OK, so second time trying this.  Really slow download though.  Will advise on sync if I get through the download process."

people who give it 10/10 never saw a 720 stereo sound rip!"

this is nowhere near 720p and the sound is awfull joint stereo."
,L0rd_Zim,2011-05-26T10:55Z,"Thanks Bro...

Hve you got a copy of the Hangover Part 2 Yet??"
,axom,2011-05-28T05:39Z,Beautiful. Thanks !!
,Charlie117,2011-06-02T08:29Z,"Are there any subtitles for this?
Every single one of them is either out of sync, or the text has nothing to do with the audio."
,Captn.7,2011-06-04T05:26Z,"V=10
A=9
M=10
This is one hell of a BluRay rip... Exceeds quality set by 6Gb rips in just 2.7Gb. Definitely the best there is.
Plays well on windows media player, VLC and all others. Don't understand why people r having issues playing. Definitely no issues at all."
,Willimaco09,2011-06-21T23:31Z,"A=9
V=10 (for file size)
Everything is in sync, no problems playing or burning.
Thanks for the up!"
