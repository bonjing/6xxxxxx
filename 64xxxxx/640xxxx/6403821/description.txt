Ok, this torrent is all about getting Mac OS X Lion running in VMware... I'm not going to pretend it's perfect, but it works. Just run the .exe for self-extraction, then follow the instructions of the "OS Installation Tutorial" link. I know links are a hassle, but it's just a video guide to show you what to do, and explain everything.
If you have any problems don't hesitate to contact me. Please remember to seed, I can't do it all by myself :P
