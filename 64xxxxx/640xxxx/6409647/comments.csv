,Flaser,2011-06-02T18:49Z,Are you sure you have donwloaded the whole file?
,mokakeyk,2011-07-19T15:21Z,"Thanks Flaser, downloaded it for an elapsed time of 19days, 34min and 49s pretty fucking ugly slow connection i have huh?, I became bald waiting for it. "
,mokakeyk,2011-07-19T15:29Z,"by the way guys when you extract the whole thing in your hard drive, dont paste it in any subfolder just in the hard drive with no folders enclosing it, i've encountered problems just by extracting them saying ""the name is too fucking long please rename 433 files and copy them again blah blah blah"" and for fucks sake, i have to repeat copying them, but eventually i got it done at last. thank you again Flaser, damn i have to get a new hd again."
,Flaser,2011-07-20T15:56Z,"Why would you extract it in the first place?
There are dozens of programs out there, that can read the images (jpg, png, etc.) straight out of the zip files.

Heck! Even XnView can do it, not to mention proper comic readers like CDisplay or Comic Rack."
