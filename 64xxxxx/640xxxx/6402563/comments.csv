+1

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T16:18Z,"@himansu_007: No, this is it - 30% higher bit-rate than usual for  480p (720 kbps instead 530-560)."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-18T17:32Z,"@twentyforty

Don't take it in a bad way...But scOrp did a 720p rip of this film at 550 MB...From the sample the quality was nice.
While your rip is 480p in 500 MB...
50 MB extra and 720p...

So I would request you to lower the size of 480p files. [Nothing against you ,you're a class 1 ripper] :D"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T18:07Z,"@DownTYU:

Really nice.

 Look - why do you think I can't? 

Be careful how do you wrap shit - do not use transparent foil for that.

I take things as I want - and do not come here  anymore. I would keep sending you in the hole."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T18:57Z,"@ALL:
Show respect.
It's like coming into someones home, day after day, getting a free lunch.
One day, you have turned to your host and mumbled: ""My mum cooks better. I know million places when I can get better food"".

Turning your back - on your way out and in one, even more important sense - that's what it is."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-18T20:50Z,"@DownTYU
e.g. you want smaller encode?  Make it yourself, otherwise stfu and be grateful for what is.  Or bitch to scOrp about not making a 480p encode to suit you."
