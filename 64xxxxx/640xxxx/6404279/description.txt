Awesome artist I met at college. She writes her own songs and plays the guitar, piano and more. I love her voice. She reminds me of Ingrid Michaelson in style. I have permission from the artist to try to spread her music like wildfire by all means. Expect a bonux album with extra songs soon! Enjoy!
