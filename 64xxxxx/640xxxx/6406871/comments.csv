Thanks"
,jamesmaker,2011-05-22T07:33Z,"Which way is better. I want to choose the one that I can for example if anything happen go to default version that was install in my device without problem.

Sometimes when I go to the Garmin website, it shows me and that there is update available. I want to see if I install this can I install the updates or not?

Can I buy an SD card and install it there so that I do not touch the original img file. 

I have Garmin 256w so do you think if I install it does it make a lot of differences."

,tickturd,2011-07-15T06:05Z,"Worked for me on a roadside find c330. Changed the name to gmapsupp.img, copied it and the other files to a 2gb card except D3060020A.JCV which I didn't have room for and apparently didn't need. Did have to specify which map to use in the maps info section. 

For those having trouble getting a SDHC card to work, I read you need to update your firmware from the Garmin site.  

Thanks a bunch!"
