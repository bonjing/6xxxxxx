Plot:
Families never turn out according to plan, and in 'The Other Woman,' 
Emilia (Natalie Portman) finds herself the shunned stepmother. After 
winning Jack (Scott Cohen) away from his wife Carolyn (Lisa Kudrow,) 
she finds herself immersed in the cross-currents of a new hybrid family. 
But shadowing Emilia's every attempt to connect with her stubborn, 
precocious stepson William (Charlie Tahan) is the unbearable loss of a 
baby she and Jack had hoped would cement their new marriage.
