Anyway, it came out on DVD today (5/17/2011) in the USA.

I apologize for any confusion this may have caused."

,Bakura2,2011-05-19T02:53Z,"@Miss_Shumacher
and anyone who reads it:

This movie is and has been seeded. The idea of torrenting is once the original seed has been seeded to others, then the weight of uploading to everyone has been taken off the originator's shoulders and distributed to those who have received the file, then they continue to upload and distribute. ""BUT"", when the majority of downloaders just leech and don't pass it on then, others don't get the file or good download speeds. I am currently uploading 24/7, plus I have other torrents to seed. So I appreciate any help seeding....at the least upload as much as you download. This pyramid affects us all."
,Bakura2,2011-05-22T09:54Z,"Please check the sample before downloading..

If you like the download (encode) of the file (not the movie/story) and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you "
,davarm,2011-05-23T09:23Z,problem downloading from the start!
,Bakura2,2011-05-23T19:10Z,"@davarm
Sorry you had download problems, BUT there  is nothing I can do about that. Your download speed and ability can be affected by your type of connection and the seeders you are getting  the file from. Last time I checked, there were over 100 people seeding this file.
Check your torrenting program's user guide, it should explain how downloading and speeds work."
