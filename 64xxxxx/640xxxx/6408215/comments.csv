,lattari,2012-03-26T13:29Z,Thank you once again. You are a global TV-god :) I just realised VLC automatically plays subtitles from a different folder as long as the folder is titled 'subtitles' and the sub-files are labeled the same as the video-file. I thought it only does that if the video and sub are in the same folder.
