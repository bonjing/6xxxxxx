Wrong, sceneline/scenebalance's releases are always first. You not being able to use your brain to unpack .rar archives does not change it."

Not trying to argue or start anything, but i personally don't like RAR's i know how unzip them thats easy as hell. But everytime i dl a RAR i get a virus because im a moron lol. 

Not sure what they couldn't just upload the .avi instead of uploading the RAR's.

And yes i know that your comment wasn't directed to me."

They don't upload unpacked releases because that's how they get them from the scene. The splitted .rar archives, being a somewhat voice from the past days when people used floppy drives or had crappy internet connection without ability to resume a download, is just the way it's written in the rules. Yes, scene has the rules. Without hard-coded rules we would eat shit-quality garbage in all kinds of different codecs and containers, whichever ripper decided to use today. You got to agree that you do like that most of releases don't look like clown's outfit and don't have varying audio/video quality over the course of a season. That's because of the rules."
