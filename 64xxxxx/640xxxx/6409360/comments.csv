,BehelitOutlaw,2011-05-22T07:37Z,English DTS make some crackeling sound from time to time

The problem is on your side, some programs may kill the cpu in the background. Use MPC and give higher priority in task manager, you probably have lower RAM then 2 GB or your graphic/sound cards can't deal with 1080p + DTS..
I've watched it with DTS and there was no crackling at all.
Next time you find an error give the time(s) where exactly you found your notorious cracklings so the other users can check then agree or disagree with your statement."
