On her album On My Way to You, released in February 2006, Gustafsson interpreted Michel Legrandâ€™s world famous melodies from films with great jazz feeling. Gustafsson â€“ directed by producer Landgren â€“ proves to be the ideal voice for these songs.

I am honoured that Rigmor has chosen to do some of my songs. She knocks me out!
