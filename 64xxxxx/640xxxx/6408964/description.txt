- Did Obama's Mideast Speech Signal U.S. Shift on Israel-Palestine? Democracy Now! Roundtable

In a major speech on the U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East and on the Arab Spring, President Obama said a Palestinian state must be based on the 1967 borders, the first time a U.S. president has explicitly taken this position. The Israeli government immediately rejected Obama's comments, calling the 1967 borders "indefensible." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in the United States today and will meet Obama at the White House. We host a roundtable with author Norman Finkelstein, Palestinian human rights lawyer Noura Erakat and Jeremy Ben-Ami, head of the lobby group J Street.


- U.N. Gaza Inquiry Panelist Desmond Travers Challenges Goldstone's Recantation of Key Finding

Israel, with backing of the United States, seized on Goldstone's comments and called for the United Nations to withdraw the report. Goldstone came under criticism from his co-panelists who co-authored the original report. We speak to one of those panelists, Col. Desmond Traver, a retired Irish soldier and peace-keeper.
