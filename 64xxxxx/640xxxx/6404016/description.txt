One of the most successful Scandinavian female jazz singers, voted Female Artist of the Year in 2004 by European jazz critics. This disc features a highly varied collection of all-original tunes. The way Gustafsson constructs her songs suggests an enjoyment of jazz but a more concentrated assimilation of, say Joni Mitchell's storytelling structures of the early to mid-1970s as well as the well-turned vocalisms of Roberta Flack and Maria Muldaur.
