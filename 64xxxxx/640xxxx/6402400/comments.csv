,Bridget_bri,2011-05-18T14:52Z,Tks again err0001!
,chuckufarley,2011-05-18T18:56Z,"I think err0001 is the only person who cares about Canadian original programming (except us).

Thanks again for taking up the slack left by the anti-Canadian scene cappers."
[V],err0001,2011-05-18T19:57Z,"Let's not be too hard on the scene. Canada only has about 10% of the population of the U.S. so it isn't surprising that there are less cappers.

And even in Canada, most of the popular shows are American.

If the scene didn't cover 95+% of the Canadian episodes, my caps a few times a week wouldn't come close to covering all of the Canadian shows."
,TechnoMax,2011-05-18T21:44Z,"thanks a lot for this, such a good show :)"
,Eugenet42,2011-05-18T23:01Z,Thanks!
,cindy25,2011-05-21T03:46Z,"the scene does a much better job with UK and OZ.

but they are usually ok with CTV and CBC, but you are the only one to do Showcase.

thanks again."
