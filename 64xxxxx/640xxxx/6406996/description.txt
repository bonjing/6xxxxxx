Plot
Lamington Road on Bombay's Western Railway is the nearest railway station that takes one to Kamathipura, notorious for it's red-light, in particular, and a crime-prone area in general. It is in this area, on a stormy rainy day, that wealthy Aman Kapoor's car breaks down. His efforts to call for help via his cell phone are in vain, and he takes shelter in a nearby building. This is where he comes in contact with a prostitute named Chameli - and this is where his nightmare involving pimps, eunuchs, prostitutes, and corrupt police officers - will begin - and will seem to have no ending whatsoever.
