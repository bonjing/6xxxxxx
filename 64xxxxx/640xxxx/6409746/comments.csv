Dear John..

Your sharing of this treasures is highly appreciated!

Again I am looking for another movie: Voices [1979] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080103/ 

The story is really sweet and innocent. If you don't get touched by this movie some way it would really surprise me. Add to this some of the most memorable and beautiful songs found in a movie, hands down. 'On A Stage', 'The Children's Song', 'Rosemarie's Theme' and 'I Will Always Wait For You' are songs that will stick with me forever. Too bad the soundtrack is not yet available on CD.



Maybe you come across this some how...?

with best regards,
Rudi
