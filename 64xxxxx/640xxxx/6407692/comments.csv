,shinjukublack,2011-05-20T19:24Z,"I'm not sure why the ""fix"" isn't just a couple files we can manually copy into the Trillian directory. And this new patch was released *very* quickly after Trillian started auto-updating to Build 33.

Even though arulkarthik is a reputable uploader, I think I'm going to pass on this as well."
,anomalz,2011-05-23T05:41Z,"Patch works great, same as build 32 patch, Put in Program Files/Trillian directory and Run as Admin."
,Kirnath,2011-05-28T03:32Z,"patch isn't working, I put in trillian directory, ran it both as admin and not as an admin, and it said  nothing patched!  I even logged into trillian after it was done and i get those crappy ads in the window still.

,Neamow,2011-05-31T10:04Z,"of course it's working, you just need to edit the folder permissions to allow programs to write or edit files"
,megavat1,2011-06-11T21:30Z,"nice, it works"
,Pyaaku,2011-06-22T11:51Z,"Thanks...
working..."
,moriem,2011-06-29T06:35Z,Works and is clean. (AVG pop'ed up with hack tool no infections though)
,TinyTana,2011-07-07T06:51Z,"Hm, I'm not sure it works for the 34 build. I installed it, patched it, it auto-updated to 34 and said I wasn't supreme overlord. So I patched it again and it says I'm supreme overlord and just when I thought it was good, there was an ad in my chat window for Trillian Pro."
