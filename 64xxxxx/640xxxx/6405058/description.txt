I took broadcast versions of the entire season 8 and converted them to H.264 MP4 files for each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were converted using Handbrake using an Apple TV preset. The video dimensions are a bit lower than on DVD rips. These episodes have video dimensions of 590 x 325 but still look great on my 50 inch HDTV. They can be played on a recent iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

NCIS is an American police procedural drama television series revolving around a fictional team of special agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which conducts criminal investigations involving the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

The eighth season of NCIS premiered on September 21, 2010 in the same time slot as the previous season and the second season of NCIS: Los Angeles premiered afterwards.[1] The season story arc involved Ziva's largely unseen boyfriend, Ray, and the CIA continuing to meddle in NCIS's day-to-day workings. Notable events included the terrorism and internal affairs threat during the Enemies two-parter, and the arrival of another Major Case Response Team from Rota, Spain, the team that Tony was offered to be lead of in the beginning of season 4. The season ended on a five part story arc involving the Port-to-Port killer that menaced both teams. The finale aired on May 17, 2011. Goodbye to Mike Franks. I will miss you.
