BBC Mountain with Griff Rhys Jones 1of5 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2007

Griff Rhys Jones explores the great mountain ranges of Britain, from Scotland southwards to the Pennines and Wales.

Part 1. Northern Scotland.
Griff Rhys Jones begins his exploration of Britain's mountains in the breathtaking wilderness of the northwest highlands of Scotland. The area was once home to half the population of Scotland, but Griff finds a vast, empty landscape closer to the Arctic Circle than to his native London. He meets a crofter who wants to encourage people back to the land and an artist who enjoys the emptiness. On the Isle of Skye, Griff explores a mountain range that is privately owned, but up for sale.
