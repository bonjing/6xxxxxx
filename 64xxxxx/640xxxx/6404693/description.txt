Ratcatcher is a 1999 film written and directed by Lynne Ramsay. 
It is her debut feature film and was screened in the Un Certain 
Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.


The film won its director numerous awards including the Carl 
Foreman Award for Newcomer in British Film at the BAFTA Awards, 
the Sutherland Trophy at the London Film Festival and the Silver 
Hugo for Best Director at the Chicago International Film Festival.


â€œUtilizing beautiful, elusive imagery, candid performances, and 
unexpected humor, Ratcatcher deftly contrasts urban decay with a 
rich interior landscape of hope and perseverance, resulting in a 
work at once raw and deeply poeticâ€.


Ratcatcher never received a wide cinematic release. It was 
released on DVD by the Criterion Collection.


The Storyline


Ratcatcher is set in Glasgow, 1973. The city, despite its Victorian grandeur, 
has some schemes with the poorest housing conditions in western Europe, such 
as no running hot water, no bathing facilities and no indoor toilet. The city 
is mid-way through a major re-development program, demolishing these schemes 
and re-housing the tenants in new modern estates. The problems in these schemes 
are somewhat compounded by the binmen going on strike, creating an additional 
health hazard and a breeding ground for rats. The main character, James, is a 
12-year old boy, growing up in one of these schemes, which is gradually 
emptying, as the re-housed tenants move out. James, with the rest of his 
family, patiently waits to be re-housed. The film opens with James possibly 
contributing to the death of his pal, Ryan, by failing to raise the alarm 
when Ryan fails to surface after the two boys have a tussle in the local 
canal. James leaves the scene, unsure, and apparently unseen. This event 
comes back to haunt him at critical points in the film. The film follows 
the sensitive James as he tries to come to terms with his guilt, make 
sense of the insensitive aspects of his environment, from his heavy-drinking 
father to the local peer culture, and as, one by one, his hopes of a brighter 
future appear to be dashed.
