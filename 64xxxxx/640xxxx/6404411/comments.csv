,ABRB2011,2011-05-28T01:20Z,Did u guys bother to copy the crack files from the SKIDROW folder over to ur install directory? U have to do that with each content release.
,Craxxet,2011-06-02T13:32Z,"ATTENTION: Everyone having trouble with this please check this list! This solution worked for me and may work for some of you! I suppose you want Fallout: New Vegas + all available DLC so just follow this!!

1. Install F:NV from this link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5896532/Fallout.New.Vegas-SKIDROW-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso 

Remember to copy crack from SKIDROW folder to INSTALL folder

2. Install F:NV HH from this link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6404371/Fallout_New_Vegas_Honest_Hearts_DLC-SKIDROW

Remember to install Honest Hearts BEFORE Dead Money AND use the fix from this site!!

3. Install Dead Money from this link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6200435/Fallout_New_Vegas_update_5_and_Dead_Money_DLC_-_Skidrow

AND remember to copy crack from dead money folder to install folder!

Now you're done! Enjoy playing Fallout: New Vegas! 

ALL CRED GOES TO SKIDROW FOR BEING AN AMAZING TORRENTER :)"
,fatshinobi,2011-06-05T05:30Z,Download fallout mod manager and launch the game from there. Works for me everytime but when I try with the real launcher it locks up.
,darkdodge,2011-07-29T15:50Z,You dont need this...after you install Honest Hearts just copy crack from your latest update folder to main New Vegas folder...launcher and everything will work ok...
