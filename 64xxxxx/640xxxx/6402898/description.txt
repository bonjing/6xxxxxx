Orlando, FL, pop-punk quartet There for Tomorrow formed in 2003, when the bandmembers were still in their early- to mid-teen years. Directly inspired by Jimmy Eat World, blink-182, Third Eye Blind, and the Hives, childhood friends Maika Maile (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, and programming), Christian Climer (lead guitar and vocals), Jay Enriquez (bass and vocals), and Chris Kamrada (drums and samples) soon began playing local radio station showcase concerts, which led to stints on the southeastern leg of the Vans Warped Tour in 2006 and 2007. A 2007 self-released EP, Pages, attracted the attention of the indie Hopeless Records, which led to the band remixing and re-recording the songs with producer James Paul Wisner (Underoath, Paramore) for the bands self-titled 2008 EP, featuring the first single No More Room to Breathe. The song Pages also appeared on the 2008 edition of the Vans Warped Tour compilation double CD on Side One Dummy Records.
