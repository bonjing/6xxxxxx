,melinator95,2011-07-12T22:50Z,"@ dubz2

If you can download K'ed soft, surely you can download Leopard OS."
,melinator95,2011-07-12T22:50Z,To upgrade your 10.4 machine ofcourse
,wannapod,2011-08-03T15:33Z,"Has anyone gotten this working on Lion? I upgraded to lion and the old version stopped working. Installed this, used key maker and still does not work. No errors just not able to mount NTFS. Running Intel Mac Pro with Lion. Can go into prefs disable and enable check but that's it. No ntfs partitions populated and all the checkmarks on the right are grayed out. I can see the partition in Disk Utility and the partition works under an XP virtual machine."
,Dannieloco,2011-08-03T17:52Z,it works perfectly on my OSX lion.. even the mounting thing
,dogmaster88,2011-08-21T12:17Z,"When installing with Serial Number and Product Key generated from Keygen, keeps getting Incorrect License Key error, have tried regenerating  and still getting the same error on both MacBook and Mac Air...sigh....is someone having the same problem?"
,ShangaiMoon,2011-08-21T14:27Z,"Amazing! Works perfectly on the newly version of Lion OSX. Never had this program before though. Thanks uploader, great job!"
,aky_m,2011-09-08T09:24Z,"the trial compressed file was corrupt (as my unrarx have said) so i downloaded it from

http://dl.paragon-software.com/demo/ntfsmac_trial.dmg"
,upload69,2011-09-08T15:22Z,"TY for the upload.

I'm new to macs and how files work on the platform. Can anyone here explain which of these files I'm supposed to open and use?"
,zubran,2011-10-05T11:21Z,"First I would like to tell you that I do not appreciate your upload, it took me 40 minutes to figure out to find a program the really works, you could've just put everything in one zip and everyone would be happy.

HERE'S HOW TO OPEN IT
1) download a program called ""The Unarchiver"" it freely available online or in mac store
2) unzip both ""cr-qbt01.zip"" and ""cr-qbt02.zip""
3) go to cr-qbt02 folder and copy ""ntfsmac_trial.part2.rar"" and put it in ""cr-qbt01"" folder
4) rename ""ntfsmac_trial.part1.rar"" to ""ntfsmac_trial.r00""
5) rename ""ntfsmac_trial.part3.rar"" to ""ntfsmac_trial.r01""
6) double click then ""The Unarchiver"" should understand it and extract them to one folder
7) now you have ""ntfsmac_trial.dmg"", enjoy!

I know that I maybe doing it the wrong way, but I've just booted my first hackintosh and not being able to write to my windows NTFS partitions is one of the first surprises, among the lack of merging folders even on the latest Lion!"
,zubran,2011-10-05T11:24Z,"yup I had a typo in:
5) rename ""ntfsmac_trial.part3.rar"" to ""ntfsmac_trial.r01""
obviously its ""ntfsmac_trial.part2.rar"" to ""ntfsmac_trial.r01"""

,mraeryceos,2011-12-16T10:08Z,Core10k.exe fails crc check!  What file is it checking?  What CRC should it have?
,alibaba888,2011-12-29T04:13Z,"Thanks Dude, this thing works like a charm. I am running Lion 10.7.2. Everything works fine, now I can plugin all my external HDDs. Thanks a zillion!"
,linuxows,2012-01-08T20:53Z,Thank you uploader & zubran for the comments on how to open it. Worked!
,zencoder,2012-01-09T06:39Z,"""Product Key or Serial Number is Incorrect""

The included keygen is for multiple products, you will get this error message if you select the wrong one.

The design of they keygen is rather ""busy"" and its easy to overlook this setting.  

"
,covenant69,2012-01-25T11:55Z,"Wow, it's uploads like this that give pirates a bad name. Multiple archives inside multiple archives...

And once I *finally* get it all extracted, the keygen won't even fscking run. Double click on the app after extracting, and it just says ""Core Keygen Quit Unexpectedly""...

what a piece of crap torrent. Wasted an hour of my time."
,tbrew,2012-02-07T06:14Z,"how did you waste an hour on this? it took about all of a minute... Works Well, have to change to your product within the keygen"
,yagoax,2012-03-05T02:29Z,Is there any advantage over TuxeraNTFS?
,mlisfun,2012-03-17T09:54Z,"thx MAFIAA, work smoothly in lion 10.7.3"
,vjule,2012-05-24T00:08Z,"For keygen to work, please select NTFS v9  in keygen Application drop menu. Cheers!"
