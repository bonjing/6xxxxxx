NTFS for Mac OS X beats down the barriers between Windows and
Mac OS X. Effectively solves the communication problems
between the Mac system and NTFS, providing full read and write
access to Windows NTFS partitions under Mac OS X. Excellent
solution for end users, SOHO and Enterprise, supports all NTFS
versions from Windows NT 3.1 to Windows Vista (NTFS versions
1.2, 3.0 and 3.1) and mounts the NTFS volumes as native ones.

NTFS for Mac OS X allows you to:

Natively read and write your data to any Windows NTFS
partition.

Easily transfer data between Windows and Mac computers using
external or thumb drives with NTFS partitions.

Access NTFS partitions without having any complex translation
applications or file services like AFP or Samba protocols.
