BOOK INFO:

Mexico is one of the few Third World nations that has successfully withdrawn the military from political control, with one of the longer reigns of civilian government in Latin America. But little research has been completed on the study of the Mexican military. Camp provides in this work fresh empirical data for testing claims concerning civilian-military relations, and succeeds in his comprehensive analysis despite the military's intense desire to remain unexamined.
