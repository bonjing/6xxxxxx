,freddy213809,2011-05-20T01:53Z,Ah so are 3 day weeks the norm now? I am not familiar with Howards new contract agreement.
,chaser469,2011-05-20T04:48Z,Howard will do a 3 day week every other week from here on out.
,freddy213809,2011-05-20T20:49Z,Thanks!

The loser here, unfortunately, is the listener. Howard should have made a little sacrifice for the benefit of his fans. Many of which have had to make a huge sacrifice due to the terrible state of the economy. I'm a huge Stern fan but this does upset and annoy me."

Some sacrifice you're making downloading Howard's show for free."
,bromhexine,2011-05-23T00:50Z,I'd pay for it if it was available in europe. Is there a legitimate pay site to download from?
