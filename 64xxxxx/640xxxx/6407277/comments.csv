,quentin_crisp,2011-05-22T15:27Z,"Installs only worked for me after changing the execute permissions for each of the 3 files copied from the Cracks folder. Run Terminal and type 'sudo chmod a+x ', enter your admin password when prompted.

e.g.  sudo chmod a+x /Applications/Google\ SketchUp\ 8/SketchUp.app/Contents/MacOS/SketchUp

Also I had to run Sketchup a couple of times and do some stuff in it before it would generate the hidden trial preference that needs to be locked.
All working good now though - thanks!"

,venegasra21,2011-07-23T06:08Z,I wasn't able to get it working.  I followed your directions step by step.  The 3 files that need to be replaced aren't being executed.  They just show as a blank document and do not start up in the terminal.  Any suggestions?

,estraulino,2011-08-27T14:46Z,"@quentin_crisp

I followed you instructions and I finally got Style Builder and LayOut working properly as far as I know, but SketchUp still seems incomplete. Got the boolean tools working, but SketchUp still cant export or import all the files it should.

What else did you do inside or outside SU to make it work properly?

And, is it safe to update LayOut and StyleBuilder?

Thanks anyway!"
,kiwi33,2011-10-21T14:53Z,"Thanks for this.
I'd also like to know if anyone has had any luck doing the automatic update on Layout and StyleBuilder?"
,imperial9,2011-11-26T10:24Z,"Thanks for the torrent!

I have installed everything as instructed. SketchUp works fine but my LayOut and Style_Builder doesn't work =(

Please help! Need it urgently! Thanks! =)"
,b4nd1t,2011-12-10T21:51Z,Hey BeeStripe! I've installed all three of the SketchUp programs as described and ran the directions that quentin_crisp described but these hidden files don't seem to be appearing anywhere. Is it safe to connect back to the internet until these show up and them lock them? All the programs appear to currently be fully functional!!! Thanks
