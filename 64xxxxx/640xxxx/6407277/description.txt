Hey Folks,  

Being that I have not been able to find a working torrent anywhere for a mac version of SketchUp Pro 8, I thought I'd upload what has worked for me, via trawling the web for a solution. 


Included in the torrent is: 

- SketchUp Pro 8.0 (downloaded May 2011)
- Cracks for Sketchup, LayOut & Style_builder
- Instructions

Difficulty - moderate - you will need to lock some hidden files and replace some others.

If you are an early Leecher, please be patient, my upload speed is dismal and intermittent, but I promise to keep it seeded with your help! 


Please also leave feedback if it works (or doesn't) for you.
