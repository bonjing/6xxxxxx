,boris72,2011-05-20T06:30Z,C'mon I'm upping at 300kb/s and I live in Australia where our downloads & uploads are capped each month. By upping to other people even at this speed I'm seriously limiting the amount I can download this month but that's what torrents are for!! Sharing and caring... especially for you Americans who as far as I'm aware have no quota per month so there should be no reason to limit your bandwidth.
,USA890789,2011-05-20T07:16Z,"this torrent is a piece of shit, i spent 3 hours downloading it, and then i go to play and it keeps on freezing on multiple formats (ps3, laptop with windows media player, media player classic, and vlc player)"
,Benishdamenish,2011-05-20T07:23Z,"Here here boris72, I'm upping at just over 620kb/s and I am CANADIAN. We have some of the most expensive internet service rates, yet broad caps... Americans have caps too broad to be considered a disability towards limiting seeding. Americans.. :P"
,Jimijojo,2011-05-20T08:25Z,"Americans :P they get all the best stuff...oh wait I AM american, hurray!!!"
,gigascoilha,2011-05-20T09:13Z,Damn Americans. They ruined America. :P
,thorofdenmark,2011-05-20T10:27Z,"5.6 Mb/s upload. 
The wiking way!"
,severed1314,2011-05-20T10:33Z,"Chill the fuck out and wait for some seeds. Do you really need to see it right this second. 

Thanks for the up"
,akifostylo,2011-05-20T11:08Z,Dunno what your problem is.. i got it from the netherlands with 1mb/s
,gipper82,2011-05-20T14:36Z,thanks so much
,MastahRiz,2011-05-20T14:48Z,"I have been a seeder for years. Despite notices from various ISPs, service handicaps, usage limits and penalties I still seed, although reading poorly written ignorant comments like 'omg pl3ase SEED IM OnlY gEtThing this much speed"" make me not really give a crap to do it anymore. If you have time to bitch about only downloading at x kB/s then you also have time to say thank you, even if we are limiting the up speed.

You're welcome. For now."
,phatmikey,2011-05-20T16:53Z,Does anyone know where I can get S07E26? Apparently it was on right after this one.

As always with this uploader! Many Thanks!

Steady 1.1mb/s in Scotland =D"
,JungleBrother,2011-05-23T04:38Z,"Thanks VTV, Thank you very much. Down in 4 mins. I would have had to wait about 2 years to see this on tv in the UK. To those whining about upload speeds. If internet users demand upload bandwidth (by using it) the ISPs will increase it, like they have done with download bandwidth. It's as simple as that. Stop blaming everyone else, unlimit your upload speed and complain to your ISP about your crap speeds you get."
,Yeeeheee,2011-05-23T13:53Z,"""The USA has the best internet"".
