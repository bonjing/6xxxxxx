Audio was out of sync for me watching it on media player.  So I slowed down the Audio -6 m/s and it seemed to sync it up."

,Sharak23,2011-05-24T08:04Z,"the video quality was nice, the audio was horrible. It was like trying to listen to the echo of the film from another room. Also, it was out of sync the whole film. "
,Sambo113,2011-05-25T13:55Z,"Audio doesnt sync with the video! Wtf!

Sound is so so sooo important when it comes to any film, You could essentially have a poorly filmed or grainy picture and Great sound could make up for it.  

Dont download"

,steelcitysy,2011-06-22T18:04Z,"the sound on this copy is good, but very out of sync. otherwise would be a very good upload, i dont know how to resync or id hav a go myself an re upload it"
,piratethisboo,2011-06-23T06:42Z,"guys very easy to fix Audio out of synch:
1. run the movie in VLC 
2. on a mac just press ""G"" (windows k) like 5 times or so till it says 350ms then it's in Synch.

FYI - In General Mac ""f"" & ""G"" Windows ""J"" and ""K"" for moving audio track back or forward 50ms per tap

your welkomen :-) share the love"

,pikkoloh_,2011-07-13T20:12Z,"funny how many people here complain about:
audio out of sync.
Download a VLC player and press ""f"" or ""g"" to adjust."

,MaGicbush,2011-07-25T09:10Z,"@ devlicious : I won't download the movie made by animal abusers...
It wassnt just in the movie, the abuse of the animals is real life! 

Oh no, the end of the world :P. Abuse is bad, but I do find it funny how people try to humanize them."
,caosuomo,2011-08-01T19:35Z,"I see lots of comments about the audio sync and people responding with ""use f and g to sync with VLC"", which is good advice in general, but *will not work* with this film.  The issue here is that the audio delay is actually changing relative to the movie as the film plays (for me the delay ranged from 300ms to -50ms), not to mention the cave-like sound quality to begin with.  So I'd recommend trying another version even for VLC users..."
