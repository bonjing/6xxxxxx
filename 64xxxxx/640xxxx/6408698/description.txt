Release Notes

Video:Vodi Slonam DVD5 thanks
Audio:Own

Okay been awhile since we did a r5 so might as well do dumbo drop 2011 the dvd5 was real nice just a bit dark and dull so added a rgb slight sharpen resize,usual
video filters all in all came out looking very nice.

On to audio the audio is of our cam cleaned up quite a bit very audible only time i heard a cough was during the sex scene .

Now main reason for READ NFO:This is cam audio and it was missing about maybe 2 seconds in 2 spots so you will notice audio oos for about 2 ms in 2 spots of the movie

one is at the 1:40 mark and one is somehwere around the beginning not sure of the time but you wont miss out on much as they were not vocal parts.

Also chopped of the ending credits not really worth me muxing the dvd5 audio just for the cast rolling down the screen as always 2 samples are included d/l and 
enjoy or feel free to be a critic and wait for line or brrip.
