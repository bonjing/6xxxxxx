[T],thetorrentlord,2011-05-18T19:41Z,I will soon run out of ink thanking you for all the hard work and great posts.
,xtyrasage,2011-05-24T09:32Z,Please seed! Yesterday I was getting 100+ kb/s today I'm getting between 10 and 60. :/  I'll seed for a long time when I get this done!
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-25T21:25Z,whole seasons have been uploaded in less than 3gb and ur one episode here is more than 1gb. RIDICULOUS. learn how to encode economically.
,xtyrasage,2011-05-29T03:47Z,"The quality is good but it took a really long time, probably because the file is HUGE. And what's up with all the extra files; SRT, SMIL? Over 1 GB per episode is just ridiculous. Luckily I have hard drive storage to spare but many people don't. I would recommend a different (smaller) torrent, because this one is kind of a mess. The subtitles are annoying too. "
,xtyrasage,2011-05-29T03:48Z,Oh and this can only be played in VLC. I had to download it because none of the 10 other programs on my computer would play the audio. 
,Keegen,2011-06-01T06:14Z,"@xtyrasage: be happy someone gives you the fourth season of Gossip Girl in HD for free! the .smi are korean subtitles and the .srt are the english subtitles. about the filesize, 720p + 42min (something around there) = at least 1GB. Be happy someone gives you entire seasons of good series in hd for free!"
,theawen,2011-08-07T18:18Z,Pleace seed :D
,DismantleRepair,2011-08-30T09:37Z,"Thank you for uploading these, I don't know what these other commenters are complaining about, 1.1 GB per file is standard size for 720p releases."
