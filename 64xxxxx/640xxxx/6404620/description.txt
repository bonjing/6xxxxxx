This is Borderlands 1.0.1 + DLC, full game, MacOS native version, [k]ed.

On first run, you will be presented with a serial number request, don't worry, uncheck "Always show this dialog" and hit the "Play" button.

The [k] applied to this version include several functionalities not found in previous [k]:
- no serial nor activation needed (present in previous [k])
- DLCs activated (new)
- Engine.u patched (new). This allows e.g. console access (see http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/PC_Tweaks section "Show/Hide console windowâ€œ), all you need is to edit your WillowInput.ini!)
- debugger allowed (new) (i.e. no ptrace trick). Useless for playing, so ignore this if you don't know what it means.

Please report in a comment if you have issues or none.
