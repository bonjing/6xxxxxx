BOOK INFO:

A collection of essays exploring the issues of national identity in modern Europe, Nations, States and Borders focuses on the 'age of state-building' period c.1830-c.1870. During this time, social and economic changes brought questions of national and regional identity to the top of the political agenda. This volume looks at the implications of these questions on a comparative basis, by analysing changing perceptions of national identity in the 'border zones' between Germany, Austria and Italy.
