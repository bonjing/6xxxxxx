,hazel13,2011-05-26T09:52Z,"Thank you for this, by the way where is track 11 titled I can't make you love me/Nick of time?"
[V],trfkad,2011-05-26T15:43Z,it's the first time I hear of this track 11. I don't see it on amazon; could be a bonus track?
,aninternalaffair,2011-05-30T19:42Z,This is great but is it just me or are tracks one and two sounding heavily distorted?
,Jysta,2011-05-30T21:45Z,cheers!
,Mr.Durden,2011-06-08T20:25Z,I can't make you love me was just something Justin did on Jimmy Fallon he siad it was a one time thing
,rmill3r,2011-06-09T21:14Z,"@edium: no it's not. Check out http://www.npr.org/2011/06/09/136855313/first-listen-bon-iver-bon-iver and read the article. It's just self-titled

@aninternalaffair: yeah, it does. But if you stream it on NPR (link above), it sounds grainy on there too. I think it's the actual recording, and not this torrent."
