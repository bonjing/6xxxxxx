Bon Iver's Bon Iver is Justin Vernon returning to former haunts with a new spirit. The reprises are there â€“ solitude, quietude, hope and desperation compressed â€“ but always a rhythm arises, a pulse vivified by gratitude and grace notes. The winter, the legend, has faded to just that, and this is the new momentary present. The icicles have dropped, rising up again as grass.
