,majtophat,2011-10-10T02:22Z,"Thank you! missed this season because of school, now I can catch up!"
,creek75,2011-12-25T13:42Z,"manOtor, why oh why did you not removed the KABLAM crap. Minus one vote.

KABLAM shit all over the episode. KABLAM, just in case you read this - you are a tool! You did not create this program, you didn't even rip it yourself - you stole! Okay, that sounds odd on the bay, but putting your own intros on each episode shows you are a lonely wanker.

Don't download unless you want to sit through ages of KABLAM's masturbatory crap. There are cleaner rips out there."
,creek75,2011-12-25T13:44Z,".. oh, and they are not HD. They are HD encoded to SD.

I wish I could give it another minus for quality."
,creek75,2011-12-25T13:57Z,"btw. mp3 is shit for video, it has no sync information so the audio will be out of sync after a few minutes or if you try to jump to a random point in the video. MP2 has sync information for MP2L3 (MP3) but on its own does not. XVID has no sync information for MP3 so guess what happens!?!?"
,wdptje,2012-01-11T15:15Z,"heey creek75, do you know the sound delay i have to set for this torrents, in VLC? would help alot, thx "
,lward53,2012-01-19T11:45Z,"Hey creek75, Did you know you bitch alot ^.^

Especially for something your getting for free, Thanks ManOtor, I like many others don't have enough money, or don't want to spend money on this, But are getting it free.

If your gonna bitch about something creek75 make sure you do to the creators of NCIS, when you get off your ass and buy the real thing."
,moksh82,2012-04-19T11:58Z,"Thanks mate for the upload. Big NCIS fan.

Will seed as long as i can 24hrs a day. I am always logged on."
