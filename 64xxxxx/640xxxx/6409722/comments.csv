Thank you for sharing this, I was looking since long time for the movie!

If you could fined ""Kinski Paganini"" (1989) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098052/ 

That would be great since I can't find any decent copy. 

The movie is special: Kinski believed that he lived through the same experiences as the legendary ""devil violinist"" Niccolo Paganini, who set whole Europe of the 19th century into frenzy and through whose personality Kinski offers us an incredibly profound and honest insight into his own life; a life of extremities. 

with best regards,
Rudi
