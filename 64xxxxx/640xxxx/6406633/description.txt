Release notes..

Autograss is your one-click grass solution for V-Ray
Select your object, click Autograss, and you're done. You've got
photorealistic grass that renders in V-Ray for 3ds Max.

Advanced multi-threaded memory management
Autograss uses Happy Digital's advanced memory management system.
That means Autograss uses only a fixed amount of RAM no matter how
much grass is in the scene, whether it's a one-acre lawn or an entire
golf course. No crashes, no nonsense. And it's fully multi-threaded,
so all your cores are driven to their full potential.

Realistic grass presets
Autograss includes eleven preset grass types covering the most commonly
used grasses. You don't need to model any grass. The scientists at
Happy Digital studied radiometrically calibrated photographs to ensure
the grass presets have true-to-life shape and color when used with
V-Ray's physical cameras and sun / sky system, from sunrise to sunset.
In addition to these presets, Autograss provides you with mapping and
variation to produce special effects like worn-out trails and
lawnmower paths.

Easy. Fast. Realistic.
Finally you can have it all. Thank you XFORCE
