,Amasu,2011-05-25T01:41Z,"@ uid0
Thank you for replying to my question, I have been asking it for roughly 3 days now. Also, since you verified it does work, is it safe to use (i.e will getting achievements in a game Ido not own be bad, or will it not allow it?).

As for your question on the languages, I'll see what happens if and when I install it and whether or not someone verifies if it is safe. I don't wanna gamble my steam account with $100+ of games."
,Amasu,2011-05-26T00:54Z,"Still looking for an answer as to whether or not this is safe to use with a legal steam copy.

I installed the DLC to a new folder on my desktop, then copied everything over to my fallout NV data directory as is. Didn't use the provided launcher OR update... then again,. I have a legal steam copy, and update/launcher may have already been fine. I did all this and it seems to work fine, I got all the info of the Honest Hearts DLC in english, though I have not played through it yet."

,egervari,2011-06-04T02:10Z,"Anyone else having the same problem? The FalloutNV.exe is dependent on libraries that are clearly not on my system. Obviously steam or whatever included new redistributions, but they were not included with the skidrow update... hence why it doesn't work. 

I bet when people are complaining about crash to desktops... they also probably don't have those libraries. Perhaps if they are on XP and not windows 7, it doesn't report the error like it does for me? Who knows. It's probably related.

For those that have it working, what .net framework or C++ redistributable do you have installed?"
