Now I could pick a few books that I really wanted, without having to dowload almost 19 Gigs.

Thanks for sharing!"

anyway, wondering if there will be a part 2 for this? :)"
,youmenow,2012-02-22T03:40Z,youre better off mastering 1 or 2 books rather than thinking about 40 000 like this. nice to have on hand though.
