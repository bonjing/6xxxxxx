So you wanna be a programmer ? Want to understand the inner working of a computer ... Learn how the little box does all those wonders that it does ... How a small chip does magic ... How a simple logic with 0's and 1's runs the whole world now ... Do you've the guts to sweat yourself out ... This collection is for you ...

Choose a programming language ... preferably C, then learn a OO language ... C++ ... learn a managed languge ... C# ... learn functional programming ... F#, Lisp, Scheme ... Don't forget to learn assembly language ... Then thoroughly go through data structures and algorithms ... Get good acquitance with discrete mathematics and graphs theory ... You'll be unbeatable with the basics ... everything else will flow into your path ...
