,clunk11,2011-05-19T20:07Z,@liquidmonkey  . Its a genuine Blue RAy rip. Most rippers place the file in a format than can be seen by most dvd players or at least can be converted . look at the U/l list... I think that should tell you it is genuine . cheers

,headtoy,2011-05-20T20:50Z,why would anyone bother to upload this crap? The sound isn't just out of sync. Sounds like a mix of 30 different movies...
,jocamero,2011-05-20T21:02Z,Video quality is nice but the sound is horribly out of sync.
,g37371,2011-05-20T21:04Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD 
,az0n,2011-05-20T21:05Z,Complete and utter waste of space.
,aznknight82,2011-05-20T21:09Z,"I can imagine a lot of seeders jumping ship after watching just a few minutes into the movie.  It is very much out of sync.

By 3 minutes & 40 seconds into the movie, it's already about 12 seconds out of sync.  The end-credit music finishes about 4 minutes and 20 seconds before the end of the movie.  It's just that bad.

Download with caution.  I'm going to go download the one by FLAWL3SS, linked above."
,Glenn_K9,2011-05-21T07:52Z,5-21/  this is really way out of sync.  its actually worse then those old chines dubbed movies.  video is really blue ray but the sound is so off its hard to watch.  if I had the tools to syn this I would since the video is so good.  I couldn't get through the movie.  
,Glenn_K9,2011-05-21T08:44Z,"This is the fixed one and it works.

,violon,2011-05-29T16:43Z,"Hey guys, to fix the out of synch prob: 
1. Go to: http://www.free-codecs.com/avi_frame_rate_changer_download.htm and download the program.
2. Extract the program and run it.
3. Open the video file.
4. Adjust the frame rate to 25 fps.
5. Save
That's it!"

,-Cortex-,2011-06-02T12:47Z,"@violon 
You can use open-source software instead
Open the AVI in MkvToolnix, change format specific option on the video track to 25 FPS, then start it muxing :)"
,te4t0n,2011-06-04T13:05Z,"I changed the audio sync in vlc with no luck..

I then tried the changing the fps to 25 and it Worked!

I;m watching it now. so far: A:8/9 amnd V:8"
,narkfestmojo,2011-06-12T10:16Z,"Audio is terrible.
Even as I was watching the intro I thought the audio sounded tinny and wrong and then teh epic sync problems.
Anyway it seems like froggie100 has uploaded quite a large number of copies, practice makes perfect.
