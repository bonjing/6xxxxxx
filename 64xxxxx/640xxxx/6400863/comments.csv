,Ltodemax,2011-05-17T19:18Z,"sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet.

Awesome.

Don't forget to buy this game if you like it guys, or we won't get any more fable games on the PC!"

I think I'll wait until one of the cracking groups releases something."
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-17T19:47Z,"I don't know if this will be a good game. The first Fable for PC was not that good. I hope that this will be better. But either way, I'll probably buy The Witcher 2. After all I cannot play both games, plus I'm saving my money for Duke Nukem Forever."
,Zcool31,2011-05-17T19:47Z,Why won't all the comments load?
,technocat14,2011-05-17T19:53Z,Thanks!! :3
,likot,2011-05-17T20:18Z,"If this looks suspicious to you, check
http://thepiratebay.org/user/AiTB/
Don't think I trust those ali213-chinesse-or-whatever crackers though, VT scan looks not good."
,zeDaBdan,2011-05-17T20:48Z,"This seems like the real deal, and I doubt that a VIP member would fuck us over like that..
And the links MasterFasterVDOWN posted seemed okay aswell.. Well, there's only one way to find out ;)"
,ayrton2388,2011-05-17T20:48Z,"NONE of the best antiviruses, like BitDefender, Kaspersky, Symantec etc detects any threat."
[V],extremezone,2011-05-17T20:58Z,"and you will get lots of bugs using this crack , so better wait for scene release"
,GhostFaceEmoKillerryitent,2011-05-17T21:14Z,I got the CRACK but game is still coming...Fkng Slowly.i hope this crack will work fine.My respect AiTB ;)

And what bugs are u talking bout, xtremezone?"
,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-05-17T22:26Z,"NOOBS ! if you want to scan an object, START USING """" Malwarebytes - Anti Malware """"!!
it's fucking free and better than the shitty scanners the top-market-security programs provide with. don't scan with norton, nod32, avast, avg, fsecure, panda... or any of the other known anti-viruses... they do NOT provide with advanced scanning.. they are made to prevent direct threat and defend your network.
Antiviruses like nod32 or norton does not advance in scanning. that's why there are more advanced programs on the net to take care of that, to aviod false-alerts!

you fools using your antivirus to scan for threat..... don't you think the damage is done if you already got the file containing the so called ""virus"" ?... i'm just saying... you shuld try Malwarebytes."

,XHaloX,2011-05-17T23:34Z,"@zingo_punkbuzter

fuck you, a failure attempt to advertise the shitty virus scanner you use.

eat shit as you dont know what you are talking about, those free shit can get your pc fucked with malwares and viruses.

i have been using norton for over than 10 years and never had a single virus nor malware. 

what a dumb fuck."
,soolavann,2011-05-17T23:36Z,"i have stam preload . copied it into steam /steamapps/common .

where di i enter the serial"
,EP91GlanzaV,2011-05-18T00:01Z,"I just used this patch/crack, during install made sure that I had the proper directory. Install seemingly went smooth, but every time I try to launch the game it gives an error message 'You can't run the game directly from fable3.exe. Please use FableLauncher.exe'. And obviously I'm using fablelauncher.exe. Am I just fucking stupid or do more people have this problem?"
,zurukai,2011-05-18T00:02Z,"Not having any luck getting this to work, game's downloaded, installed, and when I run the crack and choose the folder where the game's installed, it lets me finish and etc, but the game still asks for a serial key to be authenticated before it can continue."
,zurukai,2011-05-18T00:04Z,"Also have the same issue as EP91 above my last post, neither fable.exe or fablelauncher.exe work, and I get my error trying to run the only other exe there, f3secu."
,docmurder,2011-05-18T00:14Z,I'm getting the same error as EP91... dled the clonedvd version of the game... has *anyone* gotten this to work yet?
,Niwlitz,2011-05-18T01:36Z,"I'm getting this error too, is there ANYONE, who knows how to fix this problem? I'd really appreciate the effort!"

,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-05-18T03:04Z,"at: XHaloX   i bet you'll have about 2000 undetected infections on your pc then :) that's what i had, and i used the same shit as you do until i found out that Malwarebytes found and deleted all the fkt up files Norton could not find :) besides, it's free to use but some features won't work unless you buy it. AND, Malwarebytes is specefied on searching, Nortons is not."
,zingo_punkbuzter,2011-05-18T05:39Z,"IF YOU SEE A MESSAGE ""use the fableLauncher.exe"" - 
Try open F3Secu.exe , it's in the game folder. i used it... works fine for me.
make an offline account! if you don't know how too... serach on YouTube!"
,Bidjou,2011-05-18T10:49Z,"Am I the only one that is missing something to understand that would be sitting right in front of my nose,Wen I click on F3secu.exe it starts the activation process of Fable 3 and it's still impossible to launch the game"

,caniko2,2011-05-23T22:58Z,"I can't replace the paul.dll, it says I havent got any permission.

I am the admin... WTF?"
,xiIix,2011-05-29T06:32Z,"I've been building custom computers and repairing them for over 15 years and Norton as well as most other antivirus software sucks big fat moose cock. It is absolutely useless. I literally can't even count how many PC's come to me that have Norton installed and they had a ton of viri anyway. Antivirus software is literally a 50/50 chance of catching something. Most viruses are out for a while before they get put into the definitions, and heuristics? Give me a BREAK! Fucking useless and more often than not detect legitimate software more than malicious software. It's a piece of shit. If you think you're without malicious software, and therefor don't do routine manual cleanings, you are infested. Period. End of story. I would bet my fucking mothers eyeballs. I can't even count how many bets I've won with friends about this. 

""My PC is totally clean, no problems, norton keeps me safe"". Then I run some malewarebytes and a bunch of other free shit available, and it detects all kinds of shit like root kits, trojans, malware, viruses, spyware. And I'm talking THOUSANDS of legitimately malicious, red alert shit here, not just some ad cookie shit. People are stupid. They believe they're safe so they download whatever they want because they think their mighty norton will catch everything. Most of the time, Norton can't even fucking remove what it finds!!! 

Smart people, like me and Zingo, don't just download anything and everything. We use intelligent discretion, experience and common sense, along with routine, manual cleanings using tons of free software that is available all over the net. We have clean PC's, while stupid fucks like this halo fag are blissfully ignorant as their credit card numbers are being stolen by some asshole script kiddy in Africa.

Enjoy your Norton. Moron."
