,UnattendedsNL,2011-11-06T16:25Z,"Ja, alleen verouderd."
,rodrigo8,2012-04-15T09:10Z,"- NONE OF THESE APPLICATIONS ARE IN ENGLISH OR BRAZILIAN

- DUTCH OR POLISH IS NOT KNOW, NO MATTER

- YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD THE MS LINGUAGE PACK IN YOUR LANGUAGE AND INSTALL IT. GET THIS LINK http://www.mydigitallife.info/office-2010-language-packs-free-official-direct-download-links/

-FILE ""AUTOKMS.EXE"" IS A FALSE ALARM OF YOUR ANTIVIRUS

-THE APPLICATION IS NOT ACTIVATED, THE ACTIVATOR IS IN. ISO

WORKS FINE!"
