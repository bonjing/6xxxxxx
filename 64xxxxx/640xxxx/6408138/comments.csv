,san5895,2011-05-31T21:34Z,"If there's a problem, uninstall your game, reinstall it, reinstall .NET Framework. Try not to update directx too much though.
NOTE: Once youve put your name in, and started playing online, YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT W\O LOSING YOUR ONLINE PROGRESS!!"

I have installed the skidrow version btw but cannot get past the part where you need to paste stuff in the installation folder because I cannot find it. Thank you.

,san5895,2011-11-13T20:57Z,"Anyone having problems, delete 'BOOTSTRAP' folder from installation directory. More than that and updating all those drivers, you can't really do much. Better buy MW3 now that it's out, rather than run around with dozens of problems with a crack."
,Sushidude11,2011-11-25T07:05Z,"Bagelfarmer
You have to go to the thing where you can pick a lobby out of a list of lobbies. The menu where people name the lobbies.
To get the cracked lobbies to show up you have to refresh the list then a bunch of lobbies will show up.
Pick one :)"
