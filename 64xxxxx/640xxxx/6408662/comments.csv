Every BRrip uploaded so far has the same effect while watching with ps3!"
,Slaxwarez,2011-05-22T11:03Z,@blusniffer because most bluray film these days are Cinavia protected and at the moment there is no way to remove the Cinavia protected content :(
,blusniffer,2011-05-24T08:28Z,"Slaxwares the only torrents i download are BDrips and after 100+ all played on ps3 this is only the second time!
The cinavia is in the disc copyrighted audia and the ps3 can detect it and has been present since 2009. Every bdrip of battle LA has it because they'll be using parts of the same rips."
