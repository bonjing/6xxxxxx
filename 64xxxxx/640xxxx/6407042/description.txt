Longworth gets a nightmarish call from Daniel that Carlos has been found dead. Longworth is speechless and horrified at the site of his face-down dead body, but not as horrified as the real Carlos who is alive and pissed off. Thanks to his daughter's internet shopping addiction, he was the victim of identity fraud by the murder victim. Longworth tracks the victim to the fake-Carlos' girlfriend who is a social anthropology doctoral student who has many research subjects who are emotionally attached to her. Longworth tracks down each of her subjects in his quest to find the real killer.
