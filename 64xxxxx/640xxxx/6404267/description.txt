Beckman is the founder of the Fully Informed Juries Association and claims that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the income tax amendment, was never properly ratified. Red talks with Alex about a recent CBS 60 Minutes hit piece attacking constitutionalists and characterizing the patriot movement as domestic terrorism. Christopher Busby, a British scientist researching the negative health effects of low-dose ionizing radiation, makes an appearance to talk about the critical situation at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. Alex also covers the latest breaking news and takes your calls.
