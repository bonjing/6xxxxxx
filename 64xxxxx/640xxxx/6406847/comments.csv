,F.B.I,2011-05-19T20:23Z,Guys just one this in the read me i put the Captain sim folder goes on you desktop! IT DOESNT it goes in your MAIN FSX DIRECTORY!!!!
,mickyfinny,2011-05-19T20:39Z,It helps if you seed F.B.I.
,Juppie902,2011-05-19T20:56Z,"@F.B.I Thanks alot man !!!
now i see how sharing can help the whole community as well as team-work like this ;)
I liked that you extracted it all instead of just adding jumps ;D"
,F.B.I,2011-05-19T21:04Z,"GUYS I HAVE 100MG BROADBAND, BUT FOR SOME REASON ITS ONLY SEEDING @10K.BS"
,Juppie902,2011-05-19T21:44Z,"Okay now checked this, it doesnt works at all.
files extract, the weapon panel shows up, but i cannot lock on, cant use weapons, and cant see the HUD panel captain sim gave (so u can center plane with target)
so far it is like a RIP, i think it needs some fixing to be done like addin it to fsx.cfg"
,SniperBliss,2011-05-20T00:43Z,"Forget Weapons, we want iFly 737..."
,F.B.I,2011-05-20T10:04Z,if someone can get me the .exe for ifly fsx ill do the rest!!
,SniperBliss,2011-05-20T12:13Z,"http://net1.100megabyte.com/iFly-737NG-FSX.exe , That's the wrapper!"
,Jimstalk,2011-05-20T12:39Z,"please tell me how can i install it...I placed all the files found in the zip into my FSX main directory (except from Captain_sim which is in my desktop).then i tried to install the weapon in several airplanes like my VRS F/A 18 or Huey but then i get this error:Unable to copy files into c:/Program files/Microsoft Games/etc.......

,Obama_bin_Laden,2011-05-20T12:50Z,"WHEN will you dumbasses LEARN..you CANNOT just extract and install a Captain Sim product...it needs to be installed to place registry entries, etc. You have to crack the WRAPPER...go back to Dora the Explorer, maybe you'll learn something..."
,aarque,2011-05-20T13:33Z,"Ah, good times, good times. Who said TPB was dead for us? Wish I could offer more than a casual observation, but, doesn't the tableaux above seem almost EXACTLY like a year ago? You got the seeders, as usual, everybody working diligently together, like good kids on the playground; you got the cracker - not DCrack/Mr.Hands this time - and you got the heckler, complete with offensive name, who was that guy...I can't believe Jim actually got him banned...catshift (catfished?) or something...

Jokes aside Jim, I got my stuff all up and running and have started writing airport .bgls for a producer, yes I'd love to share but you know I can't. Anyway -- we can help you start making your own, if you're still interested. I would suggest you pick a local aerodrome and we can walk through customizing it. If you want, hit me up and we can get to it."
,Jimstalk,2011-05-20T13:46Z,Thought you were killed in pakistan...
,Jimstalk,2011-05-20T13:55Z,"Im still interested dude and i cant w8 for a little teamviewer presentation.there are lots of little airports here in greece which can be edited.Ive sent you an email some time ago but you didnt reply so i thought you were busy with your project thatswhy i didnt want to interupt..As i said im still interested in learning how to edit so please email me so that we can arrange a meeting via my teamspeak server or teamviewer

P.S. The upper comment goes to ossama bin landen ..."
,F.B.I,2011-05-20T15:49Z,Jim mate the cpatain sim folder needs to go in your main fsx directory!!! sorry!! i typed the read me wrong!!

,F.B.I,2011-05-20T15:51Z,"@Obama_bin_Laden wtf, mate we are just trying to crack it, when will dumbasses like you read the information box!!! quote "" I HAVNT TESTED IT SO NO FLAMMING"".

,Juppie902,2011-05-20T16:45Z,"@aarque
Don't forget the badass kid in the playground that can find stuff in the sand !
I found this exe in the first place, I seeded to the whole open community of P2P Sharing. Do what you can to open/crack it.
Thanks FBI for everything, and good luck if u chose to work on the wrapper. But i would still reccomend reverse engineer it the old style, just check the EXE if its protected."
,belltaco,2011-05-20T19:38Z,"Hey FBI, don't waste your expensive cracker time for Ifly 737X, that aircraft is already out and full cracked, check our favourite fs warez sites except TPB, but remember, google is not your friend"

,VaticanCity,2011-05-20T23:08Z,"The Links can't be given out. Their hosted by servers we all know but the links are tracked and protected by servers.So the moral of the story is if the links were given out than they would be showing in Google and than be tracked and closed, for copyright blah blah blah.But also they are tracked and the up loader will know who placed these links online and would be booted from their sites for good."

,SniperBliss,2011-05-21T04:57Z,What's on WickedFriends?
,F.B.I,2011-05-21T10:58Z,Guys ill have the i737 fsx uploaded later today around 6pm gmt....
,aarque,2011-05-21T12:34Z,"We have a server that has all the sick ass warez the people writing them haven't even heard about yet. These warez are so super sick that the stewardess will bring you REAL coffee while you are flying - some super sick quantum interference warezed algorithm. The details are all posted on the site but we have trackers and web spiders that crawl the web and if one of them discovers I have revealed even one more vowel about our websites' existence they will instantly flash burn my hard drive as well as my recent memory.

Anyway, this website is super sick cool and you all would love it and you all are invited except for the fact that I am not allowed to reveal its identity or location. So, if you can figure it out from the clues I have already provided, COME ON BY! Just don't download anything and FOR GODS SAKE, don't upload anything and if you do, use Cryllic in Pig Latin translated to Sanskrit to fool the text filters. The spyder-bots will still figure it out and bust you for....um...violating whatever TF (WTF) it is that makes our site so much ultra cooler than the millions of other sites that simply IGNORE copyright laws and share, like, sosimuladores. Those guys are geeks and they can't even chain two sentences together and they don't have the iFly like we do and you know we do because I am saying we do. If I upload anything that even looks like iFly, if I send it to my friend and have him upload it, if I load it onto a flash drive and torrent it from an internet cafe to an anonymous FTP masker - guys I am telling you that people use the IP blocker here all the time but OUR SPYDERS ARE EVEN MORE BADASS THAN THE RIAA ONES - they will ban me, tar and feather me, say bad things about my mother and come here and reveal my true identity. Guys I can't risk it but I love y'all just the same."
,mickyfinny,2011-05-21T19:06Z,"iFly Jets  The 737NG for FSX,will be on here soon guys.Trust me hehehe."
,Andy89898,2011-05-21T19:28Z,I really want these weapons so I downloaded it put it all in my FSX Folder fired up FSX. Chose the CS F/A-18 and everything works but there is no HUD. And How the hell do I fire weapons? I armed it all then pressed SHIFT+D or does this still need to be cracked idk. Help Thanks :D
,Juppie902,2011-05-22T12:16Z,"@Andy yes it does, please read all comments next time.
as someone said, Captain Sim requires alot more rather than extracting the files off the EXE. extracting it that way makes it work as a RIP without registry entries and most chances not working. Im trying to contact DCrack to crack this :\"
,Andy89898,2011-05-22T15:51Z,"Ok thanks for the response Juppie please comment if a cracker does crack this, I check every few hours :)"
,Obama_bin_Laden,2011-05-27T23:42Z,"Cracking wrappers is illegal, and as your Commander-in-Chief I order you to cease and desist immediately, or I will order Seal Team 6 to ventilate your craniums. Back to some Olde English with my dope bitch."
,tbo100,2011-06-18T22:31Z,"NO CRACK YET!!! WOW



you guys can crack games like Portal 2, FSX, and ARMA 2 but you cant crack a little addon made by someone from an unknown company????



Try to contact SKIDROW aka extremezone for a crack!"
,Juppie902,2011-06-20T14:01Z,"@tbo100
its from CAPTAIN SIM (http://captainsim.com)
as it says in my original torrent (the one that is not cracked/extracted)
give email or msn or whatever if u want us to contact SKIDROW. I would contact either skidrow or razor or DCrack or whoever, IF but only IFFFFFFFFFF i had their email or whatever. you cant contact someone without knowing a way to communicate with the person."
,tbo100,2011-06-21T23:08Z,"got it cracked now but i cant shoot anything yet

searched CS fourms but alot of people are having this problem"

,LarsLaur,2011-07-23T01:20Z,"Asking Razor or anyone else to crack it is in the forget it book already.
Even if you contacted them, they would just ignore you.
The reason they didn't crack this or HAWX 2 is popularity, expect them to only deal with mainstream.

Now if CaptainSim got popular... They would be targetted."
,Anarguros,2012-05-28T19:02Z,Any news? F.B.I? Anyone?
