,jamesmaker,2011-05-22T07:30Z,"which way is better. I want to choose the one that I can for example if anything happen go to default version that was install in my device without problem.

Sometimes when I go to the garmin website, it show me and that there is update available. I want o see if I install this can I install the updates or not?

Can I buy a sd card and install it there so that I do not touch the original img file. 

I have garmin 256w so do you think if I install it does it make a lot of differences."
