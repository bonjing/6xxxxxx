,cudchew,2011-05-17T15:59Z,Thanks mate
,SOBB3029,2011-05-17T23:10Z,"My pleasure.

I did a search on here & EZTV to see if anyone recorded / shared it. As no-one did, I decided to.
(I was going to keep it to myself - I only recorded it for my wife to watch)"
,evaku,2011-05-18T04:30Z,Thanks a lot. I've been looking for a real torrent of this like crazy =)
,SOBB3029,2011-05-18T18:02Z,"Yes, I'll continue. (Someone has to)

My wife prefers to watch them commercial free..."
,thefly42,2011-05-22T15:13Z,Thanks very much for this. But I must say that I found the quality wanting. Could you look at doing a better job for the second episode?
,MrDouglas,2011-05-24T23:05Z,"Quality is perfectly fine, big thx for uploading, will keep seeding :)

Think if you want to watch it in super-high quality there's streaming episodes on the show's homepage but I wouldn't go there; they spoiled who were first eliminated so I'm not gonna go look there again! Much better to download and look from here :)"
,xisato,2011-06-06T04:53Z,tks a lot! I'm a big fan of this tvshow! 
,octogirl_21,2011-09-25T21:27Z,Maybe you can help me as I am new to this seeding and such. I upload a lot and seed most items for about 3 or 4 days as I thought that the more seeding I do...the slower my computer is. Is this the case?
