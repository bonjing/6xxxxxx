The Cleaner 2012
The Cleaner is a system of programs designed to keep your computer and data safe from Trojans / Worms / Keyloggers / Spyware and all manner of malware. By actively monitoring files and processes on your computer it can detect a virus in action and catch it before it has a chance to do any damage to your valuable data. If you cruise the internet or send and receive e-mail, you can't afford to be without The Cleaner! Never again worry about e-mails you open, or programs you run - The Cleaner detection system will take care of business so you don't have to!
How The Cleaner Protects Your System ... The Cleaner searches your hard drive and cleans it of all known Trojans. Using a unique patent-pending technology, The Cleaner compares each file against a list of all known Trojans. You can scan your entire system or just one file. The program also allows you to periodically update your Trojan database file to keep it current with the latest research.

The Cleaner Pro includes background scanning of all activity in memory; a faster, redesigned scan engine (about 100 files per second); a newer, tougher, Trojan fingerprinting process; scanning inside compressed archives; and a completely redesigned Interface (GUI). Objective tests have shown that The Cleaner blows the competition away, both in speed of scans and in number of Trojans found.
