It's a Revolution! Fable III is the next blockbuster installment in the

II, and Albion has matured into an industrial revolution. However, the
fate of the kingdom is at peril. Lead a revolution to take control of
Albion, fight alongside your people, and experience love and loss while
defending the kingdom against a looming threat. Your choices as ruler
will lead to consequences felt across the entire land. Who will you

the greatest ruler to ever live?
