skidrow please remove that virus and upload again fresh crackfix patch 
thank u "
,bearclaw01234,2011-06-05T00:03Z,"@spicy18, ye are obviously a noob at downloads cuz if ye scan the file with AVG or any of the others then it will come up with a trojan generic which is just a program that is made to hack the game so it will work without a disk but the anti-virus program only sees it as a virus.  generic trojans, virus, ect are not harmful as i have seen & i have downloaded many a game."

,bearclaw01234,2011-06-06T10:54Z,"unfortunately this copy stinks also cuz like the others, it freezes & then shuts down when ye 1st get the Guild Seal in The Catacombs at the very start of the game!  so it looks like the best solution is to either beg to get the game fixed & re-uploaded or just buying the game."
