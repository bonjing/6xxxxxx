All Together Dead - Charlaine Harris-viny


The seventh installment of Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire saga (after 2006's Definitely Dead) marks a decidedly dramatic turn in the series that features lovable telepathic Louisiana barmaid Sookie Stackhouse. What started out as a relatively lighthearted amalgam of romance, paranormal fantasy, and mystery has gradually evolved into a complex and wildly compelling literary juggernaut comparable to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake novels.



In All Together Dead, Sookie is trying to put past failed relationships behind her and has a new man in her life: the handsome and mysterious shapeshifter Quinn. But in the wake of the devastation from Hurricane Katrina, and with the entire Louisiana supernatural community still reeling, Sookie is summoned by Sophie-Anne Leclerq (the Queen of Louisiana) to accompany her to a historic regional vampire summit. However, the conference -- where entire power bases could be gained or lost -- is filled with friction and ill will; and when delegates are found brutally murdered, Sookie finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy-ridden power play where the unlikeliest of suspects could be a cold-blooded killer



Considering this series' ever-increasing cast of memorable characters (a half-wit bloodsucker named Bubba who happens to be an undead Elvis Presley, quirky telepath Barry the Bellboy, et al.) and a fast-paced, witty, and intricate story line that would rival any daytime soap, it's no surprise that HBO is in the process of developing a show (True Blood) based on Harris's Southern Vampire novels. Fans of authors like the aforementioned Hamilton, Kim Harrison, and Patricia Briggs who have yet to discover Sookie Stackhouse should do so as soon as possible -- before Bubba leaves the building.
