Description: The first concert of the best prog-metal band Dream Theater in Russia!
It was held in Moscow on 10 June 2009 at SRC, "Russia." Incidentally, it was only the second concert in the new round. For years, looking forward to the show was terrific, the band performed on stage for about 2 hours and proved to everyone that they are also very long waited for this event, admired the very warm reception and promised to return again! )
Though it was announced special guests, no one in the evening than in the theater scene was not that, perhaps, even more happy fans!
