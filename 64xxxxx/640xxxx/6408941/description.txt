The ultimate sci-fi FPS is back! Get ready to step into a whole new level. 6 years have passed since the events depicted in the first episode. Humanity is now thrown into a bloody civil war between the central government of the Orbitals and the self-appointed Human-Alien Alliance. Kal Wardin left active service in N.O.V.A. years ago and now lives among the colonists of the desert planet Scorpius. But war never spares even the most peaceful places... With its immersive universe, coupled with varied gameplay including single player and multiplayer modes, this game is arguably the new benchmark of the sci-fi FPS genre.
