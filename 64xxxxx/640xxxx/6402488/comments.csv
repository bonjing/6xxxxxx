,mister15,2011-05-18T18:35Z,"It should be obligatory for uploaders of movies to include the IMDb link. Just put ""Silent Rage"" into the IMDb link and see what pops up...many times you have to scroll and search for minutes and see if you find it...if it's the new or old version, which year...and more. If the uploader took the time to actually upload it, put in text with hyperlinks to his own work...he also has the extra 30 seconds to include the IMDb link...and make us all VERY HAPPY!!!! Thanks for the upload, scenebalance!!! :-))))"
