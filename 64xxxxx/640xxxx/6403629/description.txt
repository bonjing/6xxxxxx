BOOK INFO:

The traditional role of the form or class tutor has developed into that of an academic or personal tutor; that is, an adult who works with students to guide, support and help them manage their learning. Academic or personal tutoring as a practice of learning benefits many students in secondary schools and colleges. It is increasingly adopted and specifically customised by a range of institutions who believe it will establish good habits of learning now and in the future.

Whose Learning? explores the concept of academic and personal tutoring and brings together established theoretical arguments; current activities in schools and classrooms; and observations gleaned from the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ own research. It recognises the important role of the personal tutor in working individually with his or her students, and illuminates the processes, educational relationships and learning interactions underpinning this role.

The book addresses three fundamental strands of the learning process and their complex inter-relationships:

Knowing what to learn
Knowing how to learn
Knowing yourself as a learner
Offering examples of good practice in supporting student learning Whose Learning? is essential reading for student, beginning and more experienced teachers in schools and colleges who want to reflect on and improve their own practices.
