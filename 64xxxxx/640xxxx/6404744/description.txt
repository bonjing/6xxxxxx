Just three seconds. The time it takes to make a decision. That's all that lies between settling for 'Whatever' ... or insisting on 'Whatever it takes.' 3 Seconds shows how to unleash the inner resources that can move you to a whole new level of success. It comes down to six predictable impulses that most of us automatically accept without a second thought. You can replace them with new impulses that lead toward impact and significance. For instance, it takes Three Seconds to ... Disown Your Helplessness: The First Impulse: 'There's nothing I can do about it.' 

The Second Impulse: 'I can't do everything, but I can do something.' Quit Stewing and Start Doing: The First Impulse: 'Someday I'm going to do that.' The Second Impulse: 'I'm diving in ... starting today.' Fuel Your Passion: The First Impulse: 'I'll do what happens to come my way.' The Second Impulse: 'I'll do what I'm designed to do.' Inhale ... exhale ... the difference of your lifetime can begin in the space of a single breath. The decision is yours. Start today.
