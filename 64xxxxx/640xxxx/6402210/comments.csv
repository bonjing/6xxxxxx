,haydn70ac,2011-05-18T12:04Z,"Why don't you give links to Screens?   
Vote -1 .... I did :)"
,doggfrogg,2011-05-19T04:20Z,"Some people like split screens. As far as screens go this is tpb not a ratio based tracker. If I feel like posting screens I will, and if I dont I wont. You can vote -100 for all I care.
