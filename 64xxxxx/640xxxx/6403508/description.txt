BOOK INFO:

Often overlooked by the public, the central interests of museums are collections and their conservation and use. It is this relationship with collections which separates museums from other educational and heritage institutions.

Care of Collections brings together the most important articles and extracts examining aspects of collections management and care, in particular preventative conservation. The contributors cover a wide range of issues from the ethical questions that surround exhibits to the more practical considerations of creating microenvironments and designing disaster plans. The book is divided into sections covering conservation practice, the monitoring and control of light, relative humidity and atmospheric pollution, storage and access to collections and biological infestation and disaster planning.
