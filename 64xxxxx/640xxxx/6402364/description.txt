"Over the years a unique community of artists have shared a recording studio
with U2. From folk to punk, from country to blues and soul, these extraordinary
collaborations have spanned musical genres... but until now they've never been
collected together. 'U2:DUALS' is a specially commissioned collection capturing
U2 in collaboration with other artists over three decades. Following in the
tradition of 'Artificial Horizon', 'Medium, Rare and Remastered' and other
releases special to U2.com, 'U2:DUALS' is a limited edition release which will
not be on sale in shops or online. A collectors-edition release, it's part of
the 2010/2011 U2.com subscription package."
