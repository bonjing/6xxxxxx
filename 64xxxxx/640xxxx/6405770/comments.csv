open the ISO with UltraISO or something similiar and delete ei.cfg from the sources folder.
You can now install any version  x86 or x64!

,mdemons12,2011-05-28T03:34Z,"Hello, will this work on a brand new PC with no current operating system? Is it easy to crack, no one else had any problem. I was thinking if this did not work I would just go for a Windows 7 Pro OEM."
,El-Faggio,2011-06-08T23:35Z,"Incredible patch, thanks a heap for this! The disk couldn't run for some reason (even booting from it wouldn't work, some shit about some compatibility shit), so I tried the patch and it works 100%. I'll just use my other install disk to install the x64 OS then I'll reuse the patch. Good job :D"
,ninjaman123,2011-06-09T04:36Z,You are the best!!! I already had Windows 7 Ultimate but my key was invalid your activator is perfect!! I made an account just to comment on your ninja skills!!
,SanctusSecurity,2011-06-14T23:05Z,"Some people apparently had some issues with the included ISO file. If there is a major problem, please leave another comment and I will fix it. Thank you!"
,northo22,2011-06-27T23:15Z,"Yeah dude, I'm having the same problem, it's saying I don't have the compatible windows or something.
I have Windows 7 32bit. Anyway to fix?"
,northo22,2011-06-28T09:33Z,"Oh wait nevermind.
Just had to run the installation through bootup.
Hope installation goes well for me :)
Thanks alot."
,buddytal911,2011-06-29T01:41Z,i already have windows 7... not genuine... if i install this will it upgrade or just reinstall everything?
,northo22,2011-06-30T13:35Z,"Okay, after searching through the net I found a possible solution.

If anyone is experiancing problems installing this on a 32-bit system, you have to do a clean install to get to 64-bit. 32bit cannot run on 64bit if that makes sense. Make sure you backup your stuff or move them somewhere safe, then clean install. This is only for 32-bit to 64bit.

One other thing, you MUST run this during bootup, not when your on your desktop. So burn the files onto a disc then run it during bootup. "
,lynvspudge,2011-11-10T11:26Z,hellow can i install this on mac by burning this torrent to DVD?
,glider4,2012-02-06T15:46Z,Works Perfectly thx for the upload ******
