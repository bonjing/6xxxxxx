,futyu,2011-05-20T00:13Z,you need to add some values to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CD Projekt RED\The Witcher 2\Downloads in your register as far as I know

,elessarGObonzo,2011-05-20T04:20Z,was this a new game you started? jus pasted CookedPC folder with files in The Witcher 2 folder and got no armors in inventory in my Chapter 1 game.
,Furious1964,2011-05-20T07:09Z,What 2 armors? All I got was a combat jacket and a pair of pants!
,Shibou,2011-05-20T07:16Z,"Question about install???
So we download the Torrent, when we extract it there is a folder called CookedPC with 3 .dlc files in it.
Next do we open our Witcher 2 installation file and find CookedPC.  Then move the 3 .dlc files from CookedPC from extract into the CookedPC folder in the installation folder?"
,yelloo,2011-05-20T09:55Z,Thanks Stun.
[T],swebarb,2011-05-20T10:46Z,Someone say where the fuck u get the armors ? i still cant get it working..
,ais_bn,2011-05-20T12:28Z,"@ swebarb
>> Someone say where the fuck u get the armors ? i still cant get it working.. 

You should get the .dzip files instead of the .dlc ones provided by skidrow. I got all the dlc working by downloading these .dzip files from a link posted at rlslog (as crazybaby said just above).

Actually, I can confirm the mage trousers and the roche jacket, since I'm still fumbling around the Prologue and did not yet reach the inn to get the Troll quest...."
,KanwulfNL,2011-05-20T16:42Z,the .dzip files working (: also troll quest is working.. doing it now
