Emilio Estevez and Craig Sheffer light up the screen in this exciting drama about the delicate balance of teenage friendship. That Was Then... This Is Now tells the story of two boys raised as brothers who take on the challenges of growing up and the challenges of the street with equal determination. They're an inseparable, unstoppable team that' about to face the first barrier they can't knock down... the pressure of manhood.
