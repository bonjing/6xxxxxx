is this still the same audio source as before??"
,slappyMchappy,2011-05-22T18:46Z,"Notice ""Line"" in the title description?  Then, yes, it is the same crappy audio."
,Decker74,2011-05-24T00:08Z,"I think it's a valid question. In the previous versions, the first 10 minutes or so was clearly Cam audio, and bad one at that.  If it's line all the way through, then it would be worth checking out."
,cabostyle,2011-05-26T14:12Z,"lol this R5 copy is released 4 quite sum time,why is there still no proper quality audio released big Question Mark how ppl get proper video quality but without the sound but thnx 4 sharing video:)"
,esspeez,2011-05-28T23:32Z,"Decker, are you saying that the other versions have cam audio but then switch to Line approx 10 mins in?

If so, that sounds ok to me. "
,slappyMchappy,2011-05-31T17:51Z,"I'm actually going to back-track on what I said.  The sound for this copy seems slightly better than the others.  It is still not great...I would give it a 6/10 with the others being 4/10.

If using VLC Player, set the Audio Equalizer to the ""Party"" preset and play with that slightly and you will get decent audio.  Sound is very important in this film and after doing what I suggest above, I found it very watchable."
,esspeez,2011-06-09T00:04Z,Can anyone clarify what dekker74 said that the first 10 mins are cam but then LiNE after that or am I just misunderstanding it?
