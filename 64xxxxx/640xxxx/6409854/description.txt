Made as a complement to the previous "She Discography" torrent, made someone else: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5420690/She_Discography

This torrent adds a few missing tracks, a few really hard to find tracks, new music release in the meantime, and last but not least, accurate lossless rips of Coloris and Orion CDs.
