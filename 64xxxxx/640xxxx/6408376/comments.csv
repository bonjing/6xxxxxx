Just curious...."
[V],trfkad,2011-05-20T13:54Z,"I'm uploading an entire cd collection, don't care if a single album is already here or not... "
[V],Welshguy,2011-05-20T19:10Z,"Thanks for this! Awesome album and in response to why someone would upload something again. Old torrents may lack seeders and speed so uploading it again gives people the chance to get it quicker. 

And of course this version is in Flac and anyone who knows a little about music knows this is a lossless format and leaps over MP3 even at 320 Kbps and sounds first class played in a car.

Many thanks trfkad your uploads are appreciated! "
[T],rjordan21,2011-05-20T20:22Z,"@Welshguy:

There are 8 other FLAC versions, looks like all but 1 seeded. One has an average download rate of over 500kp/s.  There's something to be said about, ""diluting the seedbank""  That's why I asked.....

@trfkad:

Uploading your entire music collection is a very altruistic act.  I wasn't trying to be rude, I was just curious.  I look forward to seeing what's next."
