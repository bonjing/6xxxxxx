Recorded at Bill Graham's Winterland Ballroom in 1977, this early show from .38 Special shows the band at its rawest, before they adopted a slick, FM-friendly sound after 1982.

This show mostly features material from the band's debut A&M release, including "Fly Away," "Tell Everybody," "Just Wanna Rock & Roll," and "Gypsy Belle." The material is not as catchy or memorable as the material that came starting four years later, but they do have the distinct sound that .38 Special has always been known for. The highlight with this show, and the King Biscuit Flower Hour show from June 1977 is the band's hyper-charged remake of Chuck Berry's "Around and Around."
