                           Cyborg Cop 2 RE-UPLOADED
                           ************************


The sequel to the 1993 film Cyborg Cop. This is David Bradleys last Cyborg Cop film
as well as the last Cyborg Cop film directed by Sam Firstenberg. Overall a highly entertaining film, better than the original and a must have for any die-hard action fan.
 


Plot:
-----
A fancy, loner cop loses his partner to a crazed terrorist during a hostage rescue. He settles for the terrorist going to Death Row in jail. What Jack doesn't know is that the terrorist will be taken and turned into a cyborg for the "Anti-Terrorist Group". When the Cyborg "Spartacus" wakes up accidentally, he kills the scientists and their guests, then goes to set things up for a Cyborg Empire. Only Jack and a few friends know how to stop him.
