I have to pose the question, Born What Way? A dude?


Click here to see the shocking pictures of proof! http://www.ladygagaisaman.com/


So... Is Lady GaGa A man? Well one thing's for sure, whether she is or she isn't, she sure needs to explain that bulge she keeps between her legs. Some of the photo's you're going to see are shocking, and they are not photoshopped or doctored in any way. If you can explain that bulge as anything other then her have ""man parts"" then you should surely be her publicist. Me Personally.. I think Lady GaGa Is A MAN!!! And whether she is or she isn't it's clear that Hollywood and the paparazzi can't get enough of this celebrity, many people contact me telling me how great of a joke site this, or how they love my funny site. This is not a joke site or a funny site, this is a coming of age tale about Lady GaGa this biggest ""queen"" in pop music. Maybe we could get Robert Pattinson or Channing Tatum to take the lead ""male role"" to play Lady GaGa in an epic biography? Now don't get me wrong, we think the fact that Lady GaGa Is A Man, or might be a man doesn't change the fact that he/she is a great artist. Hell - we just want to give any man who can sing like that his due praise!
