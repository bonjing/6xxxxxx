Dead in the Family - Charlaine Harris-viny

Sookie Stackhouse somehow survived the Faery War, but life never seems to get easy for Bon Temps' telepathic (but tip-poor) barmaid. In the tenth instalment of Charlaine Harris's resilient Southern Vampire series, Sookie and heartthrob Eric Northman come under intense regal scrutiny, but there are dangers even closer at hand: The doors to Faery slammed shut before some Fae were able to return and they're holding Sookie very personally responsible. (Hand-selling tip: HBO's True Blood is based on this series. The third season of this Emmy and Golden Globe Award-winning drama begins next month.)
