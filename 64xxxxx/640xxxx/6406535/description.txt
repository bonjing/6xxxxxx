"Navras," composed by Don Davis and Juno Reactor, is the title of the end credits music from the soundtrack to the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, The Matrix Revolutions. The lyrics of this song are taken from the Upanishads, with the chorus line:

asato ma sad gamaya
tamaso ma jyotir gamaya
mrutyor ma amritam gamaya

From ignorance lead me to truth
From darkness lead me to light
From death lead me to immortality

Njoy and seed,
