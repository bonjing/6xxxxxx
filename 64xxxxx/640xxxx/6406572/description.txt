2046 [2004] Directed by Wong Kar-wai

This is a re-encode.  The source had huge black spaces on the top and bottom (letterboxing?)  I loaded it up in Handbrake, auto-cropped and encoded and this is the result.  I am not sure if the listed resolution is correct.  Considering the smaller file size, I believe this is actually a smaller resolution that has been stretched/enlarged in the encode process due to the anamorphic setting.  The discrepancy between the runtime listed on IMDB and the runtime of this file is due to the process of converting the 24fps FILM to a 25 fps digital format by speeding up the entire film by 1 frame per second.
