,SlapMyAss,2011-11-23T06:14Z,"I have the Audio and the Cursor working, NO video, black screen only!?
I have checked the DX9, everything OK and working, OK with the PC's min system requirements as well.
I have spent the better part of a day trying to get this working (I can hear it start up), point and click does nothing, taping ENTER changes something but I don't know what as I cant see the screen.
I'm running this on my old office Dell Optiplex GX260, with a Dell E771p monitor,  Intel(R) 82845G/GL/GE/PE/GV Graphics Controller, all drivers and software up to date.

Anyone have some ideas for me to try to get this working?"

,Banzay27,2011-12-20T00:05Z,"Good torrent, bad game.
Never scared me and the most horrifying thing about it is picking up the dead birds - it makes a repulsive sound, more disgusting than horrifying, which serves to make the point.
But then, you're not me, if you're newer to violent graphics or simply softer, this may rub off 'better' on you. For me, I found that the lack of actual gore was appaling. Soldier of Fortune 2 came out I don't know how long before this, years I think, and there we could carve up enemies' skulls with our knife. For no reason other than the sake of the gore itself. It was through and through a military shooter and no other genre, and yet, there you have it. No reason the combat in this game was so dry. You're most relegated to melee and the way it works is a tad too uncanny. And despite the executions, which are supposed to make it feel brutal and sensational, there's no blood! Not when you hit enemies with a fireaxe or sledgehammer, nor when you ram their faces into the ground, for chrissakes. Makes me thing something's wrong, but I did have graphics maximized, nothing off.

The plot is no better. Nothing about it is disturbing. It's either predictable or random to a nonsensical point, both of which you get to experience in the very first level, said events that set the whole plot for the entire game.

The music is easily overlooked, the sounds are average, no more than passable. The gameplay is watered down to fighting generic enemies as you progress your way through a level always with objectives that never involve fighting said enemies, which you almost never catch off guard and most of the time are ambushing you. I suppose this is meant to induce panic scares, but the only difficulty about the enemies is how badly blocking works, resulting in you getting hit - for seemingly no reason, we can't hold down the block key.
So you fight and perform this silly little forensic game that is never a challenge and only a chore at most, that most often forces you to a dialog after you find evidence that plants you in a small area that and doesn't let you continue walking, and walking is what you'll do most of the time, as slowly running quickly empties a stamina bar that fills up twice as slowly. Doesn't apply to the enemies though, no, they'll usually be running nonstop.
Fighting, forensic gathering mini-game for the sake of mostly dull plot progress, scouring for a specific weapon to overcome a certain obstacle - a sledgehammer won't do for a particularly weak wooden door, you'll always need a fireaxe.

No, if you're undecided about this, it'll probably just be a waste of your time, unless, like I said, you're new or uncomfortable/soft regarding FPS/melee combat and violent graphics or events.
The most fun I had was punching out enemies, since our character goes (in good voice acting): ""Take this, you f-*PUNCH*!""
Easy or frustrating as the fights are (they're never more than that), that execution becomes particularly enjoyable."
