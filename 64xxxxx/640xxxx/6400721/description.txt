RELEASE  NOTES

NOTE: This is the full version of Spartan'10

SpartanModel is an "Electronic Model Kit". Making
use of computer technology, SpartanModel replaces
the "plastic models" used by past generations of
organic chemistry students, and extends the utility
of molecular models in chemistry education.

Spartan Student Edition is a serious molecular
modeling package for teaching, and learning,
chemistry. Combining Spartan's easy-to-use graphical
interface with a targeted set of computational
engines, the Student Edition provides fundamental
molecular modeling utilities supporting the Organic
Chemistry curriculum.

Spartan Essential Edition includes a full range of
molecular mechanics and quantum chemical methods, up
through and including Hartree-Fock Ab Initio
methods, behind the cutting-edge Spartan GUI,
putting powerful calculations at your fingertips.
This version of Spartan is most commonly used in
academic computer labs.

Spartan'10 is the most sophisticated version
offered. The latest Spartan'10 release offers offers
all features and methods included in the Spartan
Essential Edition, and in collaboration with Q-Chem,
provides a full range of post-Hartree-Fock methods
including Density Functional, Moller Plesset,
Theremochemistry recipes (including the new T1
procedure), and an assortment of Advanced Correlated
approaches. Spartan'10 is the dominant version used
in academic, government, and commercial research.
