,ROKKERO,2011-06-13T20:26Z,yeah i cant find a way to make it work but thank you!
,xaleeeeeel,2011-06-14T07:01Z,"i have 3.55 and cant run this game
dont wanna update to 3.60 cuz its only for this game i think"
,ROKKERO,2011-06-14T18:04Z,"for all those asking about 3.60 CFW... THERE IS NO 3.60 CFW!! IF YOU UPDATE YOUR PS3 TO 3.56 YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY ANY OF THESE GAMES!
CFW IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR PS3 FIRMWARE 3.55 AND BELOW! AND SOME GAMES ARE NOT PLAYABLE THIS IS ONE OF THEM. IM HOPING SOMEONE CAN FIND A FIX FOR ""ACLICE MADNESS RETURNS"" BUT NOTHING YET! THANK YOU UPLOADER!!   YOU FUKKIN ROKK!!! "
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T12:16Z,"Ditto what rokkero said, games like this that require 3.60+ firmware that you find here or anywhere else on the net are pointless to dl since you can't play them as there is no 3.60 cfw and will be years if ever before there is."
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T12:20Z,Other than that sometimes you get lucky and find an eboot patch but that's hit and miss. I'm sure in the next few months sony and publishers will encrypt the eboot with private keys as well.
,ONEMANDBANDIT,2011-06-29T11:35Z,NAH DIDN'T WORK FOR ME =[ TRIED EBOOT BUT STILL NOTHING.
,SiaMAnd,2011-08-25T14:35Z,"hey you know there is a way to let it work on 3.55 but it's hard to deal with it!!
JUST FOR PROFFESIONALS!!!ONLY"
,tentory,2011-12-12T06:17Z,alguien tiene el fix de este juego o no existe aun?
