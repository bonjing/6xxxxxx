Released in 1960, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus is one of the coolest albums I've ever been fortunate to listen to. Mingus is a god on his instrument and a master composer. You have one copy of this on the Bay and I question its quality, so submitted for your approval, in glorious FLAC, Charles Mingus Presents Charles Mingus.

Track Listing:
1. Folk Forms No. 1 (13:08)
2. Original Faubus Fables (9:19)
3. What Love (15:23)
4. All The Things You Could Be By Now If Sigmund Freud's Wife Was Your Mother (8:33)

(P.S. I don't care which album you thought was better or what you think of Mingus. Got a problem with the torrent? Go ahead and comment. Otherwise, piss off.)
