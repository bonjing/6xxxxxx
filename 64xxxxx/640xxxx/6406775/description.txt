Late 1950's: nine intimate glimpses of pivotal moments in the life of a child ,and a chronicle of the changing world around him. Without warning, history crosses the threshold of the fragile, small world in which he is growing up and developing. War is underway across the sea, in Algeria. His father becomes a soldier, and the open fields of adventure give way to barracks walls. The child senses that he holds his life in his hands... Before him lies the realm of the imagination, and behind him, that inalienable treasure, his memories.
