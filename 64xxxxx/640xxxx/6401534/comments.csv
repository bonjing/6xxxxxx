how do I message you other than posting comments. TPB doesn't have a Messaging feature.

Anyway, here's what I want - I only discovered that perhaps the world's most popular figure Bill Gates, has authored some amazing books. But I can't find them anywhere.

How to be a Billionaire: Proven Strategies from the Titans of Wealth
The Road Ahead
Bill Gates (Biography (a & E))
Gates: How Microsoft's Mogul Reinvented an Industry and Made Himself The Richest Man in America
Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire
and of course,
Business @ the Speed of Thought.

Lastly, just this year, his buddy Paul Allen, released a book - Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft. ISBN is 1591843820.
Even I can't find this book on TPB, or KickAssTorrents either.

Mantesh, please make these books available, to all of us.
