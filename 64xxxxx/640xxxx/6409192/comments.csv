As an educator and finantic history buff especially on WW II since I have 3 cousins, 2 Uncles & a Father who all fought in WWII on various fronts is making me consider digging into my collection of military movies & documentaries I have both taped & collected since 1967.
From Victory @ Sea, Crusdae in the Pacific to the Hidstory's Channels Scorched Earth & the 4 part series of the western front & their other one on the eastern front.
I don't know how to convert them all to the proper uploaded format it should be in so it's high time to start looking for a tutorial since all this Torrent business is new to me. I probably have in the neighborhood of 10,000 history of war doc's all on DVD & VHS that I will start lewarning to make my own contribution to humanity as you have done here fine fellow.
Wihout further adoo many Kudos's indeee for making all this learning mtl. available as an immensely valuable educational tool, especially today with the USA now having been converted from a Democracy to an inverted totalitarian state where the same NAZI powers who used the same democratic processes of electioneering to destroy itself; the German Wiemar Republic in 1933.The History Channels, ""The NAZI's a Warning from History"" is a perfect example of a mirror image of everything you see today in the US. Simply look at the Patriot Act & how it came to be on 911 the False Flag Black Box op by Mossad & Bush/Cheney Clan. Right out of the page Hitler implemented on the German people when he used Polish Jews from Concentration Camp @ Bergen Belsen putting them in Polish mil. uniforms at a border outpost used as supposed attack on German soil giving Hitler supposed justification for invasion starting WWII.

Where was Putin? Enough said. Anyway-Many Thanks Pal. XXXOOOXXXOOO"
