What we have here is as many documentaries, films, audiobooks, and E-book (battle maps, weapons encyclopedias, etc) of the WWII Battle of Stalingrad as I could find from multiple sources â€“ Thanks to the OPs. This should turn anyone into quite the expert. Think of it as one-stop shopping. The quality on some of this is a bit mixed, but I have included video notes and screenshots of all titles. Contained herein are:
