JOMF's music provides a contemporary reading of the sound or rural America, an electrified and occasionally free-jazzed take on the more languid end of the delta blues scale. Even the occasional bits of electronica are subsumed by the unhurried and decidedly organic agenda, becoming part of a widescreen aural siesta that is quite unconcerned with its destination. This album requires patience and time from the listener, but when those are afforded it provides a fascinating perspective of those elements in modern music that are often overlooked due to a short attention span. The fruits of this altered perspective are also quite perverse, as their remarkable version of "Amazing Grace" convinces without sounding the least bit lethargic or dogmatic.
