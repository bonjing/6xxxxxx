[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Your Highness

Right been working on this for days and we finally got some audio so we could get this
released :)
As it stands there are two russian videos for this film with different runtimes.....but both 
are bad qualilty and cropped alot due to camera movement,aswell as other issues.
For our release kinopark gave us the source files and we went to town on it lol.Firstly the video had so
much camera movement it was unreal so what we did was split the file into 17 pieces and then rotated and crop
each part differently,then used the perspective filter to pull anymore borders in and to resize.
Now due to different cropping etc.....and keep the same res,it meant the AR does come and go ,but no where near as
bad as the first fast five we did.
There is still some borders here and there that appear but only slightly and not for long .....but didn't want you to 
lose any picture.
Also we really clean the video up and made it look loads better ....changing the contrast,brightness,sharpness,colours
you name it.
You only have to look at the russian xvids screenies and you'll see the difference ;-)

Audio ....we were kindly given some cam audio ( thanks )....and in all fairness its pretty decent cam audio.
Scrolled through whilst syncing and you can hear the vocals ok,odd few coughs i heard aswell,but overall not bad audio.

Also we've posted more screenies than normal as there taken from the start til the end of the film so you can see the slight
change in AR.

Enjoy folks :)
