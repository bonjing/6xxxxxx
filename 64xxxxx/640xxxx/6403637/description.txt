Besides that, the browser, playlist, autoplay and search features have been 
improved, the audio engine is more flexible (allowing you to mix multiple 
asio/directsound/wasapi devices) and controller support has been improved too
(besides midi, HID and OSC are now also supported)

Featured skin: Tintin's T5v3 2011-04-30

Custom djDecks Skin - Tintin T5v3This skin is created by djDecks user Tintin 
and offers different styles for each dj. There's a mixer view to use the 
internal mixer, a video view to mix videos and a vinyl view for using 
vinyl control.

The skin can be downloaded for free on the djDecks forum. 
(INCLUDED in TORRENT)
	


Features

djDecks Deck Up to 4 full-featured decks are available for mixing, offering 
detailed waveforms, pitch ranges from 4% up to 100%, automatic bpm detection,
looping, cue points and effects.

The colored waveforms aid you in seeing what's coming up, and the accurate 
cue points and beat-aligned loops will make your mixes easier. 
Pitch corrections are made inaudible by changing only the tempo but not the 
pitch, and even changing the position of a playing song sounds seamless 
because it's beat-aligned.

djDecks Equalizer djDecks can be used with an external mixer, sending each 
deck to a different output, or you can use the internal mixer which includes 
a three-band equalizer with adjustable frequencies, pre-listening options, 
and a limiter to ensure that your mix sounds clean all the time.

Also included are various effects such as an advanced echo, a flanger, 
bitcrusher, filter and gapper, but you can also use industry-standard VST 
plugins to add a unique touch. (2 VST effects can be loaded on each deck, 
and a VST effect can also be applied to the master output)

djDecks Playlist and Browser The browser allows you to browse your songs 
by reading their tags. 
You can fully customize the columns that are shown, quickly search any 
track in your library, create playlists and even create rule-based smart 
playlists. It can also show your album-art next to the songs.

Vinyl Control record djDecks is compatible with many midi controllers out 
of the box such as the Vestax VCI-100, Denon HC-4500, Hercules DJ Console, 
Numark Mixdeck, Pioneer CDJ-2000 and many others, but you can also create 
or customize your own mapping for your controller.
MIDI, HID and OSC standards are supported to create your mappings.

If you want to have the feeling of mixing with vinyl, yet have the advantages 
of digital files, then you'll definitely want 2 check out djDecks Vinyl Control.
Using special vinyls that contain a special code, your music will follow the 
exact speed and location of the needle on the control record.
djDecks is compatible with most vinyls available such as Final Scratch, Serato 
Scratch Live, Traktor Scratch, Virtual DJ and MsPinky.
It's also possible to mix regular vinyl or other inputs such as mics with djDecks,
and also use beat detection and effects. You can even record a piece and start 
scratching it using vinyl control instantly.

djDecks Deck djDecks also supports recording your mix, or broadcasting it to a 
Shoutcast or Icecast server.

A recent addition to djDecks with the new DX release is the ability to play 
Video and Karaoke files.

The video mix can be shown on an external output, and various effects can be 
applied and transitions selected.

Another strength of djDecks is the way in which it can be fully customized. 
You can create very advanced controller mappings, but also completely change 
the way djDecks looks by installing or creating custom skins, and add new 
functionality by creating your own scripts.


Do you like djDecks, and is the time-limit annoying you? Then head over to 
the registration page and order djDecks now. 
It costs EUR 80.00 (about US$ 115) for which you can use it as long as you like.
