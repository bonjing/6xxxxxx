,wierd-old-guy,2011-06-12T21:28Z,"Thanks: excellent.


Realistically this is a full version jump. Has anyone (who actually knows what their talking about) investigated all the features that are put into a full version jump? What's really new in this one?"
,wierd-old-guy,2011-06-12T21:32Z,It SEEMS that the newest feature is size limitations for 64bit have increased to close to a Tb. It appears that in v4. they have taken full advantage of 64bit compression features; but there may be more here than meets the eye.

,Snurre__,2011-12-03T01:55Z,"Personally I think ""Peazip"" is the best file manager / file archiver plus in works equally well for Microsoft Windows as GNU/Linux.
