                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The trainees enter the final stages of their course at the Defence School of Transport
 in Leconfield, East Yorkshire, and learn how to use the vehicles in combat situations.
 Jeremy Kyle also takes the wheel of a Jackal, the pitbull of the fleet, and finds out
 what it takes to make the grade as a driver in the armed forces.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
