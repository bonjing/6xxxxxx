,phat_71,2012-01-05T06:53Z,"SWEET. This size is perfect, and the fact that it's the subbed is even better. Mind you I'm not a snob who thinks that anything dubbed is crap automatically, it all depends on the anime. Example, Bleach dub is awesome because the voices fit the characters better than the Jap ones. BUT Naruto is the opposite, and the dub is seriously annoying, SUBS all the way with Naruto.

In short, THANKS! I'll be sure to comment on quality once I've got it DLed, but MKV tend to be good in general so I doubt there should be any problems!"
,phat_71,2012-01-05T10:04Z,"As expected, audio and video quality are extremely good for the file size. I wouldn't say it's going to look good on a 50 inch flatscreen, but then again if you can buy a 50 inch flatscreen just go buy the damn DVD's :P. 

Also, download rate is very respectable for the low number of seeds, I'm getting a steady flow around 500kbps, and given the small size I should have the whole thing in a couple hours.

Thanks a million, you ROCK. There are a lot of uploaders who could definitely learn something from you :D"
,phat_71,2012-01-08T09:47Z,"Yet another note I'll need to make. Up to episode 53, they are all in fullscreen. I checked random episodes after this, and starting with episode 54 it switches over to widescreen format. I normally watch things on my TV rather than sitting in front of my PC monitor, and the subtitles at that point become quite small. 

For anyone who has some difficulty reading small print from a distance or any other similar issue, it's going to be a serious pain. I've got better than 20/20, and even for me it becomes chaotic and hard to follow when there are 2 full lines of text on the screen."
