,Slammer94,2011-07-05T06:50Z,"Thank you Donutfreak :) that really means a lot, especially since I'm just barely starting to upload stuff. Glad to know it's really benefiting someone!"

,emcee214,2011-08-12T01:07Z,"how come every series is just a little?
it doest even go to 10 mb per series...theres no way a full book series can be save on 1 or 2mb pdf...hahahaha...this is so fake...xD...laters"
,Slammer94,2011-08-14T06:13Z,"...text doesn't take up that much space. I don't think I have a single pdf book anywhere near 10 MB in size. Maybe you're just used to ones with lots of formatting or filled with DRM or something. This whole torrent is barely 10 MB anyway, it probably wouldn't hurt you to download it and see for yourself before posting that it's fake. These are completely legit. And thanks to everyone else for the feedback :)"

,Slammer94,2011-11-08T05:25Z,"Thanks for backing me up, ketchikan420. Glad you're enjoying them as much as I do! "
