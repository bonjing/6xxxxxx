About

This is the loader application that's used by millions of people worldwide, well known for passing Microsoft's WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created. The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.


Features

    Can be run as a standalone application
    Works well with all system languages
    Custom OEM information can be installed
    Argument support for silent installs
    Can be used for pre-activation
    Application integrity checking
    Custom error handling
    Support for hidden partitions and complex setups
    Can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager
    Works with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption applications
    Add your own certificates and serials externally
    Offers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1
    Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)

Application integrity checking?

Hover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.

Note: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.


Virus scanner results

All virus scanner detection's are a false-positive. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.
