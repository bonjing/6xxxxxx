,Axxo978,2011-10-01T01:57Z,"Sorry but I have to call you out on this one TvTeam, you're rips are nothing near Blu-Ray quality , as a film maker and video editor I have to say that it's maybe a DVDrip at it's best but nothing less or more. Please don't name a torrent carrying Blu-Ray quality if it's not Blu-Ray. That's just tricking people into downloading you're stuff. Please return back when you actually have Blu-Ray rips. Kthnxbai - Axxo"
