http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6407341/Mac_OS_X_Install_DVD_10.6.7.dmg"
,bert16,2011-05-21T03:57Z,"Pardon my ignorance but 7.95Gb won't fit on a DVD. Do you have to use multiple DVD's to get thing thing to install? Also, any way to install thing thing on a Windows machine?"
,zer0K,2011-05-23T06:53Z,"@bert16  I seriously can't believe how dumb you are you should be searching this site.

Do you not read anything before downloading??
""Burn image with Nero or something shittier to DL DVD"" 

DL DVD know what it means?  Dual layer DVD 8.5GB DVD or you may even be able to create a bootable USB do you know what that means?"
,milkytech,2011-05-24T22:17Z,"this isn't the first retarded comment I've seen from bert16.  

Sorry about the speeds, but I am the only one with the full file and my bandwidth is limited to around 30 kB/s upload and I can only allow that much at night.  in a couple of days when several people have the full file and are seeding, it will start to go much quicker.

be patient and SEED!"
,brianxxx,2011-05-26T01:31Z,Nice up! Keep seeding people. This thing is dripping slowly!
,dougcjohn,2011-05-27T15:29Z,"I'm at 82%, and waiting for Seeders for over a day. Please Seed! "
,MujaG,2011-05-29T13:05Z,"Thats impossible,9 days and ZERO seeders??
daaaaamn"
,milkytech,2011-05-30T18:58Z,not sure what's up.  I have uploaded more than 12 GB of data.  file is only 8 GB.
,coughas,2011-05-31T03:59Z,"damn- stuck on 95%.  very grateful for this torrent and happy to seed once i get it but cant seem to get past 95%....

thanks though"
,MujaG,2011-05-31T11:10Z,"Huuh,downloaded 7.89 ----uploaded 19.9 GB and STILL no seeders??"
,arainc,2011-06-05T08:26Z,"This does not work for all macbooks.  This appears to be a DVD that came with a macbook vs a retail copy that will work with any mac machine, such as http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5068890/Mac_OS_X_10.6_Snow_Leopard_%28Final_Retail%29"
,smachamo51,2011-06-23T06:43Z,can this be used on a Windows computer with the hard drive whipped clean???
,kaikebr,2011-07-17T03:23Z,great! seed please!
,YanZZah,2011-07-27T05:17Z,didn't work on my machine. seems like i've to download the Retail version.
,pLague609,2011-08-28T23:26Z,"I know this is a stupid question but bear with me im very new to macs, basically never used them till now, so i have a power mac g5 and i dont know if its intel based, can i still boot from flash drive since i cant burn a dmg file on windows?? "
,armada107,2011-09-03T22:58Z,STATUS workin or not???????

,mqiasi,2011-10-26T19:17Z,pls any seeders stuck at 69%
,sandeept,2011-12-04T11:48Z,Does this work for a Tony Mac Hackintosh ?? Please quick help
,sandeept,2011-12-07T04:58Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD
DO NOT DOWNLOAD
DO NOT DOWNLOAD
DO NOT DOWNLOAD

THIS IS NOT WORKING FOR A HACKINTOSH(THE TONY MAC METHOD). THIS IS JUST THE IMAGE OF BOOTCAMP NOT THE COMPLETE OS...."
,Tykimykk,2011-12-07T11:48Z,So all i need to do is mount the iso file and i can download right ? can it download on NTFS hard drive ?
,KCEL90125,2011-12-11T20:00Z,"IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ!

This is a disk image of a MacBook Pro system restore DVD. It will ONLY work on 2010/11 MacBook Pros. It WON'T work on PCs, virtual machines or other Mac systems.

Hackintoshers need a RETAIL version of Mac OS or try Googling ""iATKOS"".

This image can be burned to a DUAL-LAYER DVD using Nero (PC) or Disk Utility (Mac). Mac users can use Disk Utility to RESTORE the image to a USB flash drive which will boot quicker than a DVD (format the flash drive as GUID/HFS+ unjournaled).

Disregard any negative comments as this DVD image DOES work on those systems it was designed to work on.

Many thanks MILKYTECH, this is invaluable for MBP owners without restore media :)"
,eufrosina,2012-01-06T18:03Z,pleeeaseee seeeeed! I'm getting this in one week...
,cariocap,2012-01-12T23:42Z,"Work perfect with my MBP Late 2011.
Don't forget to run the Software update to update it to 10.6.8."
,2040tech,2012-03-11T05:22Z,Thanks I needed this is the November MacBook Pro that cam with Lion. I needed Rosetta badly and this worked perfectly!!!
,Mr.Buddha,2012-04-23T07:37Z,"Holy fuck!!! I have been trying to install Snow Leopard on a clients Macbook Pro for over 1 week now and finally this ISO made all the difference!!! I tried at least 10 different version of snow leopard before finally realizing that I had to install this specific version for this macbook pro early 2011. Since I only had a PC to work from I used Transmac to burn it onto the disk. I was originally trying to use a thumb drive to install but kept getting kernal panic errors... I also had no luck with the DMG version of this torrent, that one could not locate the drivers. This was my final option and I am glad it worked on a Dual Layer DVD. Again thanks so much for this upload!!!"
,Cubytus32,2012-05-25T07:46Z,"This hasn't worked on any unibody MacBook Pro I tried it on. The uploader would be very nice to tell which exact hardware version used this image. 

I was told about a ""universal"" 10.6.8 or 10.6.7 that would go on mid-2011 MacBook Pros. 

Heck, I just can't get used to Lion's weird ergonomics."
,saeen,2012-06-10T18:57Z,I actually got it working under vmware with boot darwin.iso.
