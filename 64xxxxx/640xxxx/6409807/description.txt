                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Evan Williams and Alex Nott travel to Ciudad Juarez on the Mexican border, 
 where they experience the daily life of crime journalist Luz Sosa. They hear
 claims that investigations into the country's drug cartels have had dire
 consequences for reporters, learning that many of her colleagues have already
 been murdered, and that she has also received death threats
