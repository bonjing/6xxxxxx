- Infernal Machina (2008) -

...another Carmina Burana dive into the abyss of tectonic torture and a foretaste of the upcoming Magma masterpiece. As a massive suite with blending parts, this is really nothing more than one colossal slab of molten, phosphorescent and distressing prog of the zeuhl variety, slowly evolving from early sizzles into a firestorm of unprecedented proportions, marshaled by Top's Rottweiler bass, a growling menace that snarls, barks and ultimately bites hard and bloody...
...I am not necessarily a zeuhl fanatic (more of an admirer) but I can understand the shock that this will cause when eared by the believers. I just follow the bass patterns and go to heaven (a darker version though)...
