Release Title: Passion Play [2010] 720p BRRiP H.264 AAC - ExtraTorrentRG


Nate (Mickey Rourke), a small-time jazz musician, is clearly a hard-luck case. Stumbling into a circus pitched amidst the vast expanses of the southwest desert, Nate finds himself drawn to the exotic beauty of Lily (Megan Fox), the Bird Woman. Lily is cold and dismissive. But it dawns on her that this gentle giant may well be her way out of this life. Nate is protective and understanding, and to him her beauty makes her unique. As their bond deepens, Nate finds that his dreams are about to be thwarted by Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), a heartless businessman with deep pockets and an eye for the bizarre.
