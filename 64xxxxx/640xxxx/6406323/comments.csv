,SLiP2010,2011-07-14T16:51Z,step 5. WTH are you talking about?
,djroosta,2011-07-31T14:09Z,"@SLiP2010 - Step 5 > Is for the patcher. I meant explorer, but there are different words for it. once you are in the patcher it will ask you to open a file, click open & below it says File Type - Select .Exe (The filetype dropdown box went weird, and i cba fixing it, lol) once you have .exe selected browse over to the directory you installed the software in, and select SuperAntiSpyware.exe, in the root folder of Super antispyware."
