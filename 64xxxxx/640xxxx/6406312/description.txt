After the passing of his parents in an accident, 
Dehradun-based Kunal continues to study in a     
prestigious school, but is asked to leave and    
live with his paternal uncle, Deshraj; his aunt, 
Rajrani, and a cousin brother. Upon arrival, he  
is given a lukewarm response, and enrolled in the
village school where not only he but all children
are beaten and abused by teachers, especially    
Shantaram.When authorities find that Deshraj has 
embezzled Rs.80 Lakhs, he decides to cash the    
investments left behind by Kunal's parents, but  
finds that he can only do so after Kunal's death.
