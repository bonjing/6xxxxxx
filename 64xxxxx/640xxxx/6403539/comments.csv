,fire711,2011-05-18T16:38Z,is this working?
,gorgi991,2011-05-18T16:42Z,yes please seed put all the files to fallout new vegas/data folder then start fallout launcher press data files and choose honesthearts.esm
,Grizzlykiller,2011-05-18T16:51Z,"This looks like the real deal But i dont know yet
will post later on to say if its real."
,jarv-x,2011-05-18T16:53Z,"The method supposedly does (worked with Dead Money for me), but I can't download it."
,dekiai,2011-05-18T17:00Z,"file size looks about right.. and so do the files =)

upload is kinda suspicous tho, only 1 torrent."
,Unknown16,2011-05-18T17:00Z,"I want to have sexual intercourse with you. Anyway, fire711, the torrent is nice and sound. The contents are only the honest hearts add on plus the esm and bsm file. So it's really unlikely this is fake. Thank you gorgi!"
,Grizzlykiller,2011-05-18T17:03Z,Does this DLC need a update?
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T17:17Z,"my ETA is about 2 hours, will report if it's real or fake then"
,Areym,2011-05-18T17:19Z,It won't start up for some reason. I put it on the Data folder and check it off in Data files but it won't start up in game.
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T17:21Z,@Grizzlykiller There is an update coming soon but it's not out yet and isn't required for this DLC as far as I've read on the official Bethesda forums
,mindkiller1,2011-05-18T17:28Z,looks like its the real deal am downloading now and is missing honest hearts nam file but it might still be dling so i'll post if is good or not when completed 
,paavinpalli,2011-05-18T17:35Z,any1 got it to work?

,mrspades,2011-05-18T17:39Z,"I copied the files into the data folder, shows up on my ""data files"" on the launcher but not in the DLC tab on the main menu, ran around for half an hour and nothings happened."
,Areym,2011-05-18T17:45Z,"@Grizzkiller, thats where i got mine, i put it in the data folder, checked it in Data files and it still wont work. Is there any other step to it?"
,gorgi991,2011-05-18T17:45Z,i have uploaded 300mb from 405mb in 1 hour all of you you will have it :)
,Telmar3,2011-05-18T17:50Z,"@Grizzlykiller that link doesn't work either. I downloaded that one first and it didn't work, so I'm trying this one."
,Grizzlykiller,2011-05-18T18:08Z,"Its starting to look like we need a new update :(

the fallout 3 dlc's needed updates for every dlc so i dont see how this one is different.

looks like we'll have to wait for update 6 :("
,arkarin,2011-05-18T18:13Z,so can somebody please confirm that it works..?
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T18:18Z,"I googled and found this

,amancebado,2011-05-18T18:54Z,Works fine. Thank you.
,ow63nf,2011-05-18T18:59Z,"Works great! I have a legitimate copy of New Vegas and ""Fallout New Vegas update 5 and Dead Money DLC"" by Skidrow."
,inanu,2011-05-18T19:10Z,I love you! THANK YOU!!!! If it works i will seed for a few weeks :)
,evirus,2011-05-18T19:10Z,The .esm isn't correct. it even references sounds from oblivion!
,evirus,2011-05-18T19:16Z,"i loaded the esm file in GECK it isn't remotly similar to dead money, the list of assests it references is extremly short by comparison, and it references stuff that isn't present in new vegas, like the oblivion spell system."
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T19:26Z,"IT WORKS! Like everyone is saying, you need update 6 and then it works. Yay!"
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T19:27Z,Wait! There's a problem with it??? I haven't actually started playing through it yet...
,Netarangi,2011-05-18T21:34Z,"""ow63nf"".. That's not legitimate then lol.."
,xplor3r,2011-05-18T21:49Z,"Fallout.New.Vegas.Honest.Hearts.DLC.SKIDROW


is 1,84 GB exactly , type on google these words

,opiatius,2011-05-18T22:07Z,"SKIDROW RELEASED HH and the filesize is 1.8gb pretty sure this is a fake piece of shit, gorgi991 i hope you die in a fire fkin fgt"
,azisco,2011-05-18T22:32Z,"I like how everyone automatically assumes that this is fake because Skidrow's is larger. Read the older comments and you'll see people vouching for it (keep in mind that the Skidrow release probably comes with all of the FO:NV updates, which are required for HH to work. This one doesn't, so you have to find them elsewhere.)

I'm DLing Update 6 and then I'll DL this, I might not get around to playing it today, but I'll confirm whether it works soon."
,azisco,2011-05-18T22:45Z,"All right, it seems to be working fine. To anyone who doesn't know: this DLC requires Fallout New Vegas Update 6 to work, which can be found on most torrent sites (although not on TPB, strangely)."
,Kurogawa,2011-05-18T22:59Z,Completely safe.*Thumbs up*
,kombox,2011-05-18T23:02Z,accualy guys dont hate on this guy bcause on xbox the size for honest hearts is 254.28MB flat this is more but its not less so i dunno im pretty sure its good
,gorgi991,2011-05-18T23:05Z,This Dlc need Update 6 to play ;)
,PPierce34,2011-05-18T23:06Z,"I haven't really had time to play this but I just made time so I could silence the doubters.

I just played through a little bit of HH and this is 100% legit. YOU DO NEED UPDATE 6. Once you have updated, put these files in your data folder and checked HH in the launcher. IT WORKS! Goodbye. "

,klemmari,2011-05-19T01:03Z,Fake. The files are from Oblivion. Get the skidrow release instead.
,lolwutroflninja,2011-05-19T01:16Z,attention my fellow pirates! this torrent IS NOT fake! i've been playing it for the last four hours and I promise you guys it's real.  
,PPierce34,2011-05-19T01:55Z,"Just noticed something while playing... no music. Even with music turned up all the way under audio settings. Dunno if it's just me or a problem with this release. I turn it off anyway and listen to music with iTunes while I play, but I just noticed this."
,Grizzlykiller,2011-05-19T02:14Z,"This is great thanks man :)

it does require the new update like all the dlc's but i actually does also fix the nvse and im running it at Beta 10 now.

Fast download as well thanks Mate"
,yuwuxie,2011-05-19T02:31Z,"Confirmed to be working ! I have put the downloaded files into the data folder of my new vegas install directory. Then start the game, select Data Files in the start up menu, check HonestHearts.esm. Once I load a previous saved game, a new radio broadcast is received and you can start the DLC as a new quest. (My game is updated until update 6)"
,azisco,2011-05-21T20:26Z,I just beat the whole thing it worked flawlessly. I feel bad for the idiots downloading the 2 gig SKIDROW release when this + Update 6 comes in a little under 1 gig.
,two250,2011-06-01T19:36Z,Works perfect! Found this after I was amazed at skidrows 1.8gb when 405mb is the actual size of the dlc from Bethseda. Skidrow's update 6 is around 477mb so I have no clue why their HH release is a massive 1.8gb's...
,a_fellow_pirate,2011-06-12T02:19Z,Ha Ha! opiatius sounds like a fag.
,kml265,2011-06-23T04:34Z,so i put all the file into my data folder but when i load the loose files the radio broadcast does not show up. can anyone help?
,Pyromaniac99,2011-06-23T11:53Z,Hey people i got a question! I've got a legal version of both Fallout: New Vegas and Dead Money DLC. Is there a problem using this DLC with other legal versions? I got some other games in my Steam account so i want to be sure.
,Anethma,2011-10-19T11:18Z,"@Pyromaniac99
Nope, it all works fine.
Just like FO3, if you disable GFWL you can use all the DLC for that as well.
They are just Data packages you can enable (like a mod).
Normally I'd say pay for the DLC if you like it but... I paid for the game, why should I pay 1/4 the price of the game for a few extra hours of gameplay >.>"
