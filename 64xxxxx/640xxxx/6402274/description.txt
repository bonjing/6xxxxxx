Anyone who thinks that Morrissey only made music worth listening to while he was with the Smiths should spend some time getting acquainted with Vauxhall and I. Released in 1994, this album shows the Mozzer channeling the spirit of his glory days; in its finest moments, Vauxhall and I matches the sheer emotional power of albums like the Queen Is Dead and songs like This Charming Man. The whole thing positively gushes with the things that made Morrissey so great in the first place - the lyrics are pure twisted poetry, full of razor-sharp wit and lovelorn angst, while the music is nothing short of gloriously offbeat pop.
