,MickiSel,2011-05-28T22:56Z,"Update: So I went into the package contents, found the cider file, which launched Terminal, which gave me a bunch of errors, telling me why the game wouldn't work. If thapheon1 wants to see the errors so he can fix it, tell me"
,BKLDBHKDS,2011-05-29T02:41Z,"Update: It only took about 3 days to download after all of that. Kind of a crappy ratio with 36 seeders, 173 leechers. I'm currently seeding at about 30kb/s, so I'll try to leave my computer open when I remember. As for the torrent itself, it starts off VERY SHITTY. Lower ALL the things on the graphics as far as they can go. Every time you open it, it will be slightly playable for a couple of minutes, but it does get better. Remember to turn all your graphics down!
My specs, in case you were wondering:

2.53 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
4GB RAM 1067 MHz DDR3 "
,BKLDBHKDS,2011-05-29T02:45Z,"EDIT: If anybody is having a problem with their game slowing down then speeding up constantly, this is the solution:
1. First off, restart your computer. If this doesn't work, carry on.
2. Download smcFanControl. It's completely free. It's a program that lets you control the speed of your cooling fans and tells you the internal temperature of the Mac. I'm not going to post a download link because you can really get it anywhere as long as your use a search engine.
3. Set the RPM of the fans as high as they can go.
4. Wait for your computer to cool down. You don't have to wait long, maybe a minute or two.
5. Play your game! It should run a lot better than before.

I'm not sure this is a permanent solution, it just worked for me.
Cheers."

Firstly it will lag like hell and you have to play with that.Just exit the game and play couple of times.
Then change the setting to auto configure and turn off shadows and you will probably get error or freeze just restart the game you will get more FPS than before.If not change the other settings.
I have completed 10 missions and FPS is better than in windows.
