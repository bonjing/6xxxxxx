         A man captures evidence of powerful poltergeists who          
         threaten to steal the souls of his family; a woman makes      
         contact with a dozen entities and has the stunning photos     
         to show for it; strange lights on the bedroom ceiling,        
         the sounds of doors slamming, and an invisible entity         
         charging up the stairs force a man to flee his home;          
         a couple captures staggering paranormal pictures of a         
         phantom and even the ghost of a cat; and two friends have     
         the spookiest Halloween ever when they see the ghost of       
          a Civil War soldier.
