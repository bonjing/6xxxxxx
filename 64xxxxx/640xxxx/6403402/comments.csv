1.First of all Disable ur Anti-virus and UAC..

2.Extract your setup using win rar...

3.Make sure you have 20 GB free HDD in your pc....

4.Run the setup,Dont worry if it is freeze time in 0.0% give him some time to start the procedure.

5.when it reaches at 70.0% its give the same error dont press okei first copy all the files to another folder which have been extracted during installation.

6.After copying the files Press ok.

7.Now extract All 3 bin files with FREEARC In the same folder That you copied Last time.

1.DOWNLOAD FREE ARC 

2.MAKE A NEW FOLDER NAME IT WHATEVER
