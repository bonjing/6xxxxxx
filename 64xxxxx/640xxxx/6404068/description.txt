 What do you get when you put together a Swedish jazz chanteuse singing American tunes in English with a Viennese string quartet? Pure magic! Everything about this release works beautifully. The musicianship is phenomenal, the arrangements are superb, and the recording is outstanding.   (PhilGloss)
