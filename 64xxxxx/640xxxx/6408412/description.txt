Notes: This outing, originally released on vinyl in 1981, was a forerunner in the do-it-yourself indie movement. The polished backing (including full band) and high-quality studio recording certainly don't sound "low budget," though, and guest artists feature some of the finest players on the Kansas City scene. Beth's original songs include the award-winning "Dance to Your Blues," the haunting "(Have You Seen) Phillipa," and the rocking "Lose Your Money." Her version of the classic "Whiter Shade of Pale," with its spidery acoustic guitar motif, is spectacular. As one listener said, "I never really understood this song before I heard Beth do it."

Beth has been making solid independent recordings for a lot of years now, and this is where it started.
