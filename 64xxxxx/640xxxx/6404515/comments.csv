[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-19T01:28Z,"I watched it start to finish.  Didn't notice any obvious problems in the audio track.  Just skimmed both tracks, seems fine to me.  I wouldn't post junk."
,hauntnut,2011-05-19T08:13Z,"Much appreciated. I've always enjoyed your uploads, just wanted to be sure. Some of the other uploads have been mislabeled. Thanks again!"
,moshster,2011-05-19T09:44Z,What does the RC tag mean?  New one to me.
,nittany,2011-05-19T10:18Z,"The RC in the movie name = Region C  The other RC movie I got was ""The Mechanic"" and the quality was horrible, also there were shots of the boom mic and all kinds of unedited scenes.  I would stay away from any kind of RC release as I think it means it's not the final version of the movie.  Maybe someone can clear this up.

Check out the comments for the RC version of ""The Mechanic"", link below and someone posted screen shots of some of the unedited scenes:

Blu-ray Discs use a much simpler region-code system than DVD with only 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C.

* Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea.
* Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.
* Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia.

[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-19T15:25Z,Some RC releases are poor quality this is true.  This release however is not poor quality.
,Vishnu1976,2011-05-19T18:23Z," HolyRoses doesn't mess around with poor quality torrents. I have been downloading from hr long enough to know his rips are by far the best quality for their size. and definately worth waiting for. not to mention hr goes to the trouble of adding dolby digital.

 Thank you very much HR ....FIST POUND"

Actually i think its the other way around. I'm guessing that the 5.1 is already on it and he adds a stereo to it himself"
