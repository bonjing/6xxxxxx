you have to run setup as an administrator also turn off your antivirus before extracting game for an archive so no files get removed. it appears that the game did not install properly."
,Demoslav,2011-05-23T01:17Z,"shroo

i ve done everything like u said. disabled AV, firewall. i ve even tryied to unpack the rar in safe mode. sometimes i get an CRC error next time not. but in the end i managed to unpack them without error (but i had to do this file by file) (i did it using 7-zip).

after that i ran the setup.bat as admin.  (in normal and also safe mode)  the extraction finishes different evrytime. somehow it skips extraction for example while extracting data4.tptb it ends the extraction at 40% (no error message). after the extraction the game dir has different sizes, from 1,5 GB to 3,5GB.

any ideas?"
[V],Shroo,2011-05-23T02:05Z,"@Demoslav 

The issue with this that the download itself is corrupt thats why it wont extract. Try doing hash recheck on your torrent client. 

The other issue might be is that, you dont have enough free memory to unpack the files try shutting down all the programs that run in the background."

well first you never went into detail about your issue.

for most that get the black screen when clicking launch: hit the esc button for the game to load.
make sure your

is up to date even if you have 64bit windows.
