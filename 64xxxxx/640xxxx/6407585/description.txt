
In Season three the battle to decide the fate of the universe begins! On the distant Planet Namek, the seven magic Dragon Balls have been brought together and the dragon Porunga summoned. Now, Goku and the Z-fighters are all that stand between the evil Frieza and his wish for immortality! Having survived their encounters with FriezaÃ¢Â€â„¢s dreaded minions, Goku and his friends are now left to contend with the ruthless tyrant himself. Despite their recent victories, however, the Z-fighters are ill prepared to face the terrifying reality of FriezaÃ¢Â€â„¢s power. To defeat this seemingly invincible foe and restore peace to the universe, there is but one hopeâ€”a Super Saiyan must emerge!
