,joej191,2011-05-20T19:02Z,"When playing the game its best to use Wifi, and for more apps and etc just download Applanet.Net"
[T],xxThugxx,2011-05-20T19:12Z,"ANYONE THAT USES APPLANET IS AN IDIOT AND DESERVE EVERYTHING THEY GET. INFACT YOU MIGHT AS WELL PUBLISH ALL YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, AND I KNOW LOADS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD $200 - 300 DOLLAR PHONE BILLS BECAUSE OF MALICIOUS APPLICATIONS SENDING PREMIUM RATE SMS'S ALL BECAUSE OF APPLANET BE WARNED. NONE OF THE APPS ARE CRACKED EITHER, AND WITH THE MARKET PURCHASE CHECK NOW, IM RENDERS 99% OF THE CRAP ON THERE USELESS!"

Did you install the Fast & Furious PowerVR or SnapDragon?
I'm guessing you installed the PowerVR one as I got that error when I installed PowerVR.
Okay, uninstall that and install the SnapDragon one and then you won't get that message and you'll be able to download the files and play the game, worked for me.
As simple as that.
Hope I helped :)"
