Download these packs. Then unpack & then Mount each ISO ok. Open Rosetta stone & select add. then it'll look for any packs that are mounted & ask if you would like to Install. You will need a Disk Mounter. here Download this & Install Via Info file & Bogs done!

,Cornwell,2012-04-03T10:14Z,"Might be good to point out that you need to download Rosetta Stone (not a language pack like this). It is in this program that you add the language pack when it's mounted.

This is the main program you need to install first.
