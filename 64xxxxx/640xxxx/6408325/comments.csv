Cue the fundies with their outrage, and 'wassal whatever-the-hell his name is' frothing about the koran.

Stupid monkeys."

,hijaz79,2011-05-21T11:49Z,"I can see that the uploads made by moman73 are making some people very very very mad.

By my latest count the total titles uploaded by moman73 exceeded 2400 titles. Almost all of  these titles were written by western (non-muslim) authors. Many of them are/were prominent scholars/scientists/historians.

I wonder whom rubicon7 is calling ""stupid monkeys?"""
,rubicon7,2011-05-22T08:07Z,"@hijaz79: I was referring to all ""believers"", christian, muslim, or otherwise, who place said belief above rational thought. The kind of folks who bomb abortion clinics and kill homosexuals because that's what Jeebus wants them to do, or who strap explosives to their chest before walking into a cafe', in a bid to get into paradise.

Although, to be honest, I've long since seen *any* belief in an 'almighty' as a character flaw.  It seems - at best - to be a crutch for those who are too weak-willed to deal with life on their own, while at worst it is a tool used by some to control others.

But I'm just a silly, balding monkey myself, shaking my tiny fist against the insanity of my race."
,shunyobay,2012-05-17T14:18Z,"@rubicon7. I, graying monkey, shake my fist with you. Some interesting stuff from the up-loader, but it is so interesting how folks can not turn the critical eye and attacks they aim at others upon themselves. It's truly amazing. "
