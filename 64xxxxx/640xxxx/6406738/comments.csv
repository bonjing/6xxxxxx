,micmac33,2011-05-19T20:09Z,"Hi @twentyforty, thanks for your great uploads.
I've been looking for this one, without any hardcoded subs whatsoever. Already downloaded 3 copies without any luck.
Could you tell me, is this the one?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-19T20:11Z,Yes.
,rajmxxx,2011-05-19T20:36Z,Thanks 20-40. The same can you do for Batman Begins - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-19T21:44Z,"@rajmxxx: No, I cannot."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-19T21:49Z,"@spiritualiste: Currently only RC (Release Candidate) is out. If this is not same shit when Russian guys give video and English guys mix some nasty Mic as audio as for Mechanic 2011 RC - I would. Otherwise, I think is better to wait for official disk."
,spiritualiste,2011-05-19T21:55Z,"@Twentyforty
...of course i meant the official BR Disk...thanks...

You are a kind-hearted person I have ever got in touch with; master. TPB should make a new member category for you only. You are beyond comparison & I'm not doing that mistake.

I know the trick to hit multiple +1 and I'm gonna do it for this, ha ha ... Thank you soooooo much."
