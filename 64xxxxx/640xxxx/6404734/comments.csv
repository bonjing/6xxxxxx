[V],manOtor,2011-05-19T04:05Z,I should probably mention that this is tested only for windows - I simply don't know whether it works also for mac.
,GiantBlackPenis,2011-05-28T05:34Z,Thanks it worked
,inmortalone,2011-06-02T01:04Z,"This is a Great donwload thank you for many more years THE BEST!

,robcob6,2011-06-02T01:45Z,"came up with a virus

i duno if its meant to, but i wouldnt trust it"
[V],manOtor,2011-06-05T05:49Z,"Just to be clear:
There is no Virus here!

I admit I should have included the following in the description, so that you can check for yourself.
Here are links to scans with Jottis Malwarescanner and novirusthanks.org:
see the results for yourself and decide whether there is a virus or not.

Note that even if it says ""infected"" it shows under ""results"": Crack.EC, Riskware.Keygen.Adobe!IK, CRCK_KEYGEN.

Jottis Malewarescanner shows with Quickheal and Sophos a Trojan:
That is what is called a ""false positive"".
If you don't know what that is and still think it's too risky, JUST DON'T DOWNLOAD!"

,surykendra,2011-06-16T17:02Z,"there's one thing I don't get :s !
under what type of file do I have to save the transformed ""hosts"" ? how can I make it replace the original file ?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with this kind of stuff ... "
,sethberg,2011-06-23T19:49Z,"So I have the host file the way it should be, and a serial from the keygen, and the serial works.  Then it asks me to enter my adobe membership info, and as soon as I click submit, it makes me connect to the internet, then I connect to the internet and try again, and it fails.  Am I doing it wrong?"
,NLkevin,2011-06-27T10:30Z,"@ surykendra
run notepad as administrator then open the hosts file, you will be allowed to save it then.

Thank you for good torrent"
,NLkevin,2011-06-27T10:30Z,"@surykendra

Also, don't use adobe id, Skip the step, you don't need it"
,meangene67,2011-06-28T04:56Z,KeyGen Doesnt Work
,bizysamoan,2011-06-29T07:34Z,damm wanted this BUT @ robco was RIGHT it has a fucking trojan alright my anti-virus TREND MICRO pickd it up str8 away.....DAMMMM
,silentlyoutraged,2011-07-03T11:52Z,"I'm having the same problem as sethberg.  Everything goes fine until I get to the screen asking for Adobe ID.  There's no option to skip it, and creating one doesn't work.  Any ideas?"
,ksemanr,2011-07-04T10:24Z,I am having the Adobe ID problem as well
,thedjentleman,2011-07-07T11:34Z,"i enter the serial and i make up an adobe id but for some reason it says it cannot ""subscribe"" me and then it makes me quit and restart. The keygen says patch, am i supposed to use this? any reply would be helpful. thanks!"
,Brad1974,2011-07-07T13:18Z,"I did everything as described, and the program worked like a charm - for six months. Now I'm getting a warning about an invalid key roughly every two days during startup. I have plenty of spare keys, but after a week this constant re-entering is getting on my nerves.

The hosts file is exactly the same as described in the HowTo. Any ideas how to solve this? Reinstall?"
,l4r3f4c3,2011-07-09T00:31Z,"bullshit just like all the other ones.  none of it works.  

and for the guy who said skip the ID part?  You cant!!!!   Bullshit, all bullshit, these peeps are just gonna install backdoors on your system and scrape your personal data to sell to their russian and chinese mafia buddies..   "
,Nethro,2011-07-09T18:36Z,"Detected / deleted a virus. Nice try, internets."
,LucidMind,2011-07-12T01:19Z,"It doesn't let me skip the adobe id part, and after I put the serial in, which I have many times I always get this message 'We are unable to start your subscription for Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Extended Subscription Edition' Any help please? Thanks xx "
,Quicksilver59,2011-07-13T20:31Z,"Hey folks!
Don't you know, all Antivirus application detect the craked  keys as trojan viruses? This is the same ""problem"" with all craked progrms. Exit from your Antivirus before install the PhotoShop, or enable the file seems ""trojan"" as reliable or trustful file.
If you don't believe in the publisher, buy your PhotoShop software legally!
Why don't you try to learn more about cracked applications???"
,jessez,2011-07-14T22:23Z,i can't get pass enter your Adobe ID. Why is it every CS5 torrent creater thinks you only need directions up until Adobe ID and even morons think you can skip this. I disabled net replace the hosts file exactly. This is the only current torrent i have on my whole computer that doesn't work.Need a crack or real directions or just tell us your full of shit.
,SeasonOfMists,2011-07-15T16:32Z,"This thing doesn't work worth shit anymore. You can't even input the serial without being connected to the internet. Either take this down, or post one that works."
,sjwbos,2011-07-17T01:18Z,"For all you peeps having trouble with the adobe ID shit, the answer is very simple. Just enter any (thought up) username and put @adobe.com at the end and... Poof! Continue! If you do this you can also enter the serial at the start of the installation.
Glad to have been of help! Cya all!"
,Foxxel,2011-07-17T08:20Z,"You n00bs having this Trojan pickup.
It's a False Positive. All keygens are False Positive.
If you don't want to have the risk then go buy the program.
If you do, download the keygen, ignore all the warnings, do what you need to do. Delete the keygen and then do a scan. It will come up with nothing."
,killawatts13,2011-07-21T03:31Z,HAS VIRUS. was immediately removed from my computer.
,rawood,2011-07-21T21:07Z,I also have a problem entering an adobe ID.  Can anyone verify that they can get around this?  The @adobe email hint by sjwbos doesn't work for me.
,guitargraham,2011-07-29T21:16Z,absolutely does not work. You cannot install without internet connection to check your adobe ID which has to be a real email address. The @adobe.com does not work. Sort this or take it off. Waste of time.
,guitargraham,2011-07-29T21:18Z,PS only newbies get frightened of a positive scan from a keygen.

,goldfishzz,2011-08-01T02:08Z,i down loaded the torrent but when i open it the only thing in there is the how to ...please help
,tith,2011-08-02T10:53Z,"when i try to open the keygen an error message pops up that says ""windows cannot access the specific device, path or file. you may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."" ive tried it on multiple versions of windows and tried running it as and administrator but it still came up, does anyone know how to fix this? please respond "
,Zenden2RS,2011-08-02T12:11Z,To all you kids saying it's a virus. Go back and play Neopets. TPB isn't for you. Neither is using a keygen of any sort.
,linniixox,2011-08-03T02:43Z,Thanks for uploading. Worked perfectly!
[V],manOtor,2011-08-05T03:50Z,"Maybe here is a solution:
Follow the instructions up to the entering the serial part.
Don't enter serial, instead install as trial.
Put the serial in when you later start the program for the first time.

There is no virus in here and the only error I can think of sits between chair and computer ;)...

Cheers"
,Redmagedon,2011-08-06T21:24Z,There isn't a virus!
,Lyxbyxa2,2011-08-09T02:12Z,"Thanks for the attempt to make it userfriendly but the hosts file can't be edited on Windows 7 even if you are an administrator, unless you first start notepad to run it in administrator mode, then open hosts.txt. It's hidden so you need to type in the name manually (how is a n00b supposed to know that do you think?). I work as a support technician and even I didn't know this.
Makes me wonder; why aren't there any crackers that are ""uncool"" (?) enough to make a turnkey release that works right out of the box, without lots of masturbation stuff such as serials, unrar, readmes, keygens, file editing and quirky instructions... I would actually be willing to pay for something like that.
I installed this for my girlfriend and had I known how much time it would take me to install I would not have attempted it. Tip: Crackers without anything to do; make a hosts.txt patching tool to include with your next release."

,Dudeman0001,2011-09-15T22:19Z,"There's no virus, keygen's often come up as virus on your computer because your virus protection doesn't know wtf they are. If a user has a skull next to their name it means they're a trusted user."
,Dudeman0001,2011-09-15T23:49Z,"Also, right after I enter my serial, it asks for my adobe ID (which I have to be online for) then I get an error prompt saying they were ""unable to start my subscription"". I already had it installed though, does that make a difference? Because before CS5.1 I just used the keygen every time I started up photoshop (like an actual key)"

,Bornaspi,2012-02-14T05:28Z,"IMPORTANT HELP:

If you are getting a subscription error, search the web for a new serial. This keygenerator likes to generate subscription version serial numbers. Once you find a retail edition serial, it'll unlock just fine (assuming that you have blocked activation properly)."
