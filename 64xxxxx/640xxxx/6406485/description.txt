For My Lovely Pirate Bay Leechers! And Respected Torrent Distributors.


   If you are starting with a brand new windows installation I
   highly recommend starting with Windows Loader v2, then nod32
   smart security, then the nod32 updater, then the PC Tools
   Firewall Plus 7. The firewall is excellent for preventing
   programs from checking serials online and that, just open it
   and go to applications, while you're installing something new
   it will show up at the bottom and you can deny it access to
   internet forever. These programs if installed as the
   instructions say shouldn't need this extra measure but I always
   do it just in case (it's a major pain in the ass to have a
   program blocked until you reformat). I have tested all these
   programs myself, they all work, 2 or 3 of the keygens appear as
   viruses but as most people know that is common, I scanned after
   installing everything and no virus at all or unwanted extra
   processes etc. Also I left it unrared so that people can grab
   only what they need if necessary, however it's probably not a
   bad idea to grab the whole thing and have it backed up on a DVD
   like I did (you never know when it could come in handy). Also
   a few of these programs do not have the full install available
   because it is constantly being updated or whatever reason, so
   only the provided web installer is included. Enjoy!



   P.S. I will not be answering questions about how to install or
   howto's or any of that, SO PISS OFF! Dont spam the damn comments. 
   You will have to read the instructions provided lazy cunts, 
   Also try asking in SuprBay support forums @
