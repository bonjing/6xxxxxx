"The Change in the Game"

The unidentifiable and gruesome 
remains of a male bowler are found 
lodged in the automatic pinsetter of 
a bowling lane. Brennan's father, Max 
Keenan (guest star O'Neal), is a 
member of the victim's bowling team, 
but currently sidelined with an 
injury. With no clear lead in the 
case, Booth and Brennan go undercover 
and join the very competitive bowling 
team in hopes of finding clues about 
the victim. Upon meeting the victim's 
teammates, including an arrogant 12-
year-old bowling prodigy, it becomes 
apparent there could be many suspects 
in the case. Meanwhile, a very 
pregnant Angela anticipates her labor 
at any moment, but continues to work 
diligently via webcam to identify the 
murder weapon from the hospital.

Enjoy :)
