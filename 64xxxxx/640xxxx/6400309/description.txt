This is the classic Close Combat 3: Cross of Iron + one of the best mods of all time Grossdeutschland v2.0, in my opinion the best mod and version of Close Combat.

This mod modifies "Cross of Iron" to allow you to fight the campaign on the Eastern Front as a single unit, the infamous Grossdeutschland. Lead your Battle Group starting as a Regiment in the Barbarossa invasion of 1941, to the bitter end (as a Panzer Korps) in East Prussia. Designed specically for play against the computer, several changes were made to make the AI a more challenging opponent. It should be noted, these changes do not involve modifying the effectiveness of weapons or thickness of armor - All values are set to the greatest accuracy possible for both sides. The Soviets, however, have overwhelming numerical superiority and can easily replace losses while you need to be much more careful about ensuring most (if not all) of your troops survive each battle
