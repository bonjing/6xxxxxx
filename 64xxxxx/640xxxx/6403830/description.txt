Okay, created the untethered 4.3.2 firmwares :) Make sure you read the following to ensure you're successful.

1. iPhone 3GS users determine if they're old/new bootrom by the 4th and 5th digits of the serial number. If those digits are less than 40, you're old bootrom.
2. Hacktivated means your activation doesn't go through iTunes. Use this if you need an unlock.
3. 06.15.00 Baseband firmwares for the 3GS update your baseband to 06.15.00 and you can then use the package "ultrasn0w" from Cydia to unlock your device.
4. If you're officially unlocked or don't need an unlock, use the unhacktivated firmwares.

~~MUST DO~~

BEFORE YOU RESTORE, USE IREB. RUN THROUGH IREB ONCE, UNTIL YOU'RE IN PWNED DFU MODE, THEN RESTORE BY PRESSING SHIFT + RESTORE (ALT + RESTORE FOR MAC)

That's all you need to know :) Any issues, hit me up :)
