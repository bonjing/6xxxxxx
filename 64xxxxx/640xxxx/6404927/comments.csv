,wullie7362,2011-05-19T05:12Z,Why have you got your torrent passworded sceneline?
,denoid,2011-05-19T05:13Z,"pw protected from sceneline??? some how I doubt that... 
In any case, I'll comment again once the download is finished"
,denoid,2011-05-19T05:17Z,"Not PW protected... real deal!
Tks sceneline"
,roebuckguy,2011-05-19T05:34Z,It is probably password protected because you haven't downloaded any RAR software. I have winRAR and have dowbloaded from sceneline many times and never had a problem.
,starscater,2011-05-19T07:21Z,I can confirm this is real.  No password protect.  You have to use 7-zip (or similar program) and open the archive.
,wullie7362,2011-05-21T07:02Z,Thanks sceneline...I wish i never saw that asshole dxfwmad's comment and just downloaded to check for myself.
