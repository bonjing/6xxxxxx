,iMikeMvz,2011-06-05T00:25Z,@mjsa96 I mean how to dload from a webseed ?
,mjsa96,2011-06-06T18:03Z,"@iMikeMvz
The webseed is in the torrent, most torrent clients should support webseeding (i.e. Transmission, utorrent).
If you go to this link you can access the files directly:
http://mjsa.co/downloads/music/Dead%20By%20April%20-%202011%20-%20Within%20My%20Heart%20(Single)/

To upload a webseed:
1. Upload what you want via FTP, SSH, etc.
2. In uTorrent go to File > New Torrent; enter the webseed URL in the box."
