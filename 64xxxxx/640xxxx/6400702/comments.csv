,guitarblues14,2011-05-17T20:44Z,"Thanks for HIMYM & Nurse Jackie, would you please consider uploading Supernatural S 6 1-6 if you can ? Thanks (:"
,dark_defender,2011-05-17T21:16Z,"Hi twentyforty,

If possible would you be able to do 
Pan's Labyrinth
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/

Couldn't find a Brrip in decent size. If limit allows i would like 1080p or else 720p please.

@guitarblues14: If you can wait i would be uploading supernatural season 6 complete once whole season is aired, encoded by 20-40 of course."
,Cavemann,2011-05-17T21:19Z,Thanks again
,believenu,2011-05-17T21:23Z,thank you. seeding is sharing.
,DMVIN,2011-05-17T21:23Z,"thanks
I rem u mentioned u may be doing castle entire season. Is this still on?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T21:25Z,"@guitarblues14: As I have said many times (when older episodes were requested) - I have hard drive crash back in March and only some random stuff ""survived"". I thought - because of my repeating - that anybody have acknowledged what that means. Sorry."
,guitarblues14,2011-05-17T21:43Z,"@ dark_defender : That would be great, thanks a lot mate (:

@ 20-40 : I had read about your HD crash a while ago but it completely slipped out of my mind. Sorry for the inconvenience."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T21:56Z,"@dark_defender: Maybe 720p, but I doubt very much, it is 1h58 and 16/9 aspect - and I have HDDVD only, which can be noisy and I cannot achieve decent compression. Maybe is better to sacrifice 2 GB for that movie someplace else,  not only because of mentioned reservations, but because of usually low interest (here) for Spanish-fantasy movies."
,dark_defender,2011-05-17T22:25Z,@20-40: Not a problem sir. Thanks anyway. 
,jmac85,2011-05-18T05:57Z,"Thanks, sir, for this pack. I cannot, for the life of me, find Transformers Prime S01E14... did you skip it?"
