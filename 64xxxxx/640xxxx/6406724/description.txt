OTHER INFOS THANKS TO \" AKNCLK \" for the comment on TPB previous artisteer upload:

                 If it does not save or work properly do this : 

Delete all Artisteer entrys in the registry then delete all folders & files in system.
Create new user with administrator rights.
Logon to new user account then install Artisteer 3 (instructions to install important!).
Then switch to original user account and open program.
Reactivate program with serial&activation key.
Now Artisteer 3 works properly in your user account.
Delete new user account if you want. Its not necessary.

##### ANOTHER - unverified - TRAICK TO SAVE PROJECTS : 
------------------------------------------------------

Thanks to \" Bout2Bus \" for comments on previous artisteer upload : 

OK. So youve downloaded and activated your chosen version of Artisteer.
BUT, guess what? IT WONT SAVE YOUR PROJECTS!!!
Youre not alone, trust me.

How to get around this:

When you open Artisteer you are faced with that dreaded default layout.
Dont even bother working on it!
Instead choose \'Open\' and browse to C:\\Program Files\\Artisteer 3\\Library\\Data\\Samples (XP example)
Open one of these and get creative!
Save project by simply clicking the \'Save\' icon. And it WILL BE SAVED! Reopen it and you\'ll see!
