[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T18:19Z,"@Night_89: I answered you two days ago, regarding Cov.Aff. and regarding other season collections: there is no need - every episode is (was) upped and was seeded 2+2 days out of  seven. If somebody missed something - too bad. I would up what I have during the summer - maybe."

[V],DownTYU,2011-05-18T20:57Z,"Continuing the conversation from
Passion.Play.2011.BluRay.480p.H264

First, In 2004 I had a 15"" CRT monitor and used to watch movies in VCD; In 2006 I had a 17"" monitor and used to watch avi files, In 2010 I had a 24"" LCD and started looking for HD files,

NOW I have a 40"" LED monitor and I only watch 720p HD or higher...That's how you go..
Anything but HD sucks like hell in my monitor...Your 480p files are blurry in 2560x1440 resolution.

How do you think I should take things?
Blindly download everything.???

I seeded Jackie Brown 480p 5 times over, That Micheal Douglas film(I don't remember the name) I seeded 2 times and again seeded because some people were stuck in downloading.
I always give back what I take.

Haven't I said ""Thanks"" everytime I downloaded something from you?
Haven't I helped people to get subtitles which you didn't upload?

What else should I do ???

If you ask I'll never download any of your stuff nor I will ever visit your TPB profile."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-18T22:39Z,"@DownTYU
You download encodes for free (other than your monthly broadband internet fee--which covers ALL monthly internet activities); I download for free, other than my ~$50/month broadband fee; 20-40 uploads for his normal internet fee, plus seedbox fees, plus fees to obtain some blue-ray files...basically without remuneration from you or I or anyone else.  If you were BUYING his encodes, you could ethically justify your reasoning, perhaps.  But you are not."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T23:13Z,"I give everything I have. For that reason only, I demand - not ask - for respect.

People do not realize how getting something for nothing limits their behavior. They can bitch about things they pay for - but if by their own choice took something for free - they can forget about ""inherited"" rights.

I refuse to accept shameful, respect-less, negligent, stupid and maniacal
behavior of people who came and would come here.

I have something, they make decision to get it from me - get faster than anywhere else, free of charge, and as it doesn't suffice - if that doesn't 
fit their ""minds"" or feed their own demons, or needs, or some superficial ""idea"" what is their need - they would come back, again and again, just to make even with 
the world or myself - for practically no reason at all. 

At least, not having a true reason I can accept, and more often, even to comprehend.
..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T23:14Z,"...
To make something very clear: I give everything - literary.
Not my spare time, not my free time - but - all of it.
For best or for worse - I never ever have made nor intend to make any cent 
out of all encoding and ""torrenting"" - as my time,
I give - every cent into, even if that mean that I would be hungry.

Some people are angry about 5 seconds of ""Encoded by: 20-40"" tag in video.
Let me clear on that once again:
I started with tagging when my encodes started to appear on Hulu, Vimeo and 
few other commercial sites. When my tagging started, their commercialization 
stopped. Few people even commended my encodes as ""my customers are very pleased 
with quality. I sell your encodes to iPod owners. I guess you don't mind.""
Guessed wrong. I tagged my encodes to stop that too. 
..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T23:15Z,"...
In Summer of 2010, at the end of June, my old computer ditched out, reluctantly, 
slowly died at the end. Just handful of people noticed my virtual absence. 
Only two dozens asked can they help.
Only ten helped.
Out of several thousands. 

Count all peers you see downloading one of my encodes... Add them together... 
Day by day, week by week, month by month, years... 
I have people right here who download from me from 2007, but when I needed help, 
I haven't even asked.
I knew that I should expect nothing and I know that any men have his own burden.

So, do not wonder why some people are treated differently.
I have my own ""metrics"" to distinguish between the wheat and the tares.
I am and I was good at it."
,believenu,2011-05-19T03:22Z," to DownTYU. 
As someone who has a old computer and old monitor.. I d/l from twenty forty to watch mostly fot me and some for my children. I am unable to purchase for any cost anything newer so I am thankful to twenty and others like him for what he does... enabling me to see shows and view movies I would not be able to otherwise..
 As someone new only 3 years online with the same secondhand computer I am at a loss to understand why someone who obviously has the funds available(40"" LED monitor) and probally the computer to go with it does not just go and buy what you want instead of bitching about the size and quality of what you are getting for nothing except a request to seed to others. 
It is great that you share back with others I do the same from my 75 gb pentium 1, 256mb ram and I seed at least 3/4 gb for every 300-500 mb I get from twentyforty. 
I got to be honest I have no idea about 720 vs 480-mp4 to whatever, I am trying to learn and share  myself. but I know that It works for me . I am trying to absorb the large and detailed information  that twenty provides to us and if I have any questions I ask politly and am usually answered.
I and so many others those of us who do not have the space, the speed,the equipment that someone who has a 40"" LED monitor find  that whatever magic he does and does so well is fine clear and everything we need . "
,sadhu19,2011-05-19T07:04Z,"@ downTYU aka dipshit,
let me ask you a question who the f***k do you think you are??
it's like lord dipshit has ordered from now on all movie uploads should be 720p and between 500-550 MB bcoz lord dipshit now owns a 40"" LED tv and 480p movie gets kinda blurry!!!! funny huh.

what do you think every man on tbp works to please you or 20-40 uploads hoping that lord dipshit might get pleased. .. . 

nobody is here to please you eggroll and you are practically nobody and nobody gives a fu**k that you own a LED tv. 

and if i remember correctly you did the same bitching about 720p MiNiKiNgS and YIFY's drive angry upload and both were 720p version.

and if a eggroll can afford a 40"" LED TV it goes beyond my rational reasoning why is he looking for 500 Mb torrents . .. . that sounds like funny . ask your mom to give you additional 30$ so that you can get higher bandwidth and download from proper blue ray versions without compression and nobody will ask you to seed there.

now dipshit will read this but will not comment or he might gather his balls and ask me 'who the fuck you are?' than remember dipshit i asked the same question."
,t.trikiti,2011-05-19T15:04Z,"@DownTYU 
If you can afford a  40"" LED monitor....why do you spend your precious ""HD time"" downloading from @Twentyforty if you are going to cry about because it's blurry. 
Leave the great TwentyForty alone and go somewhere else. 
I have a 13"" laptop monitor and slow connection. I'm more then thankful for 20/40 encode. He literally saves me hours of download time every day!"
,jmac85,2011-05-19T18:54Z,"@DownTYU: I have watched many of 20-40's encodes on a 50"" plasma HDTV at 1920x1080. Sure it's less than superb quality on a 1080p display, but it's still extremely watchable.
Simple fact: if you don't like 480p, go download the releases from Orenji, CTU, or Dimension. You'll get 720p and about 5-8 times filesize. If you *have* to watch on your huge PC monitor, then that's the price you'll pay."
