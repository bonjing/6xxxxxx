Soundprank - Captivated / Solid Ground by Anjunadeep


Having held the distinction of being the only artist with three contributions to the number 1 iTunes Dance Album 'Anjunadeep:03', Canadian producer Soundprank continues his rapid ascendancy with the release of 'Captivated' and 'Solid Ground'.*

A notable stand-out from James Grant's 'Anjunadeep:03' mix, Soundprank's 'Captivated' is a futuristic progressive groover that owes much to its majestic, subtle piano breakdown. Somehow being both optimistic and melancholic, the track's musical quality shines through and makes for a modern, but timeless progressive epic.*

The second track, 'Solid Ground' is an equally rewarding workout. Building on an infectious synth pattern and a trademark Soundprank groove, 'Solid Ground' is again centred around a sublime, musically rich piano refrain - this time backed by a subtle almost breakbeat-driven rhythm that is vaguely reminiscent of Robert Babicz's 'Dark Flower'.
