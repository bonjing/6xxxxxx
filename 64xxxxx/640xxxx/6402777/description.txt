HB brought you the internal a few days ago. Though the retail is 
out since the 26th of april, seems nobody bother to buy it or 
release it. Ofcourse you favorite hardcore group won't let a 
release like this go away. From midtown:

''On Saturday the 23rd of April 2011, the Ahoy venue in Rotterdam 
was transformed yet again into the infamous annual hardcore 
platform that is Nightmare. Against a backdrop of impressive 
decoration and musically supported by the whoÃ†s who of the 
hardcore industry, thousands of hardcore heads were collectively 
undergoing over nine hours of early rave and present hardcore 
insanity. As the unwritten Nightmare law constitutes, two 
Nightmare headliners received the assignment to compile and mix 
the traditional Nightmare compilation.

Ã´Producing an anthem for a Nightmare event pays offÃ¶, Weapon X 
must have thought. And if a Nightmare anthem is thÃŸt good, itÃ†s 
bound to happen you also get asked to compile the official 
Nightmare compilation. With his production Hell Awaits, 
Weapon X finds himself in an illustrious group of Nightmare anthem
providers. With his unique choice of hardcore battle weapons, 
Weapon X selected 22 present hardcore masterpieces for disc one 
by a.o. Evil Activities & Endymion, D-Passion, Nosferatu, 
Ruffneck, Angerfist and Ophidian, next to his own creations.

If you say early rave, you say Forze DJ Team. As the Forze DJ 
Team single handedly invented the early rave genre with their 
outstanding resume of releases, this notorious team of 
Rotterdam DJÃ†s had the honor to close off the early rave stage 
during Nightmare. Forze DJ Team member DJ Lars was up to the 
task to capture the essence of early rave onto disc number two. 
Tunes such as Gangster Shit, 909 Trauma, Party Rico, Fuck You 
Man, Alkaline 3DH, Young Birds, Dumcore and many more represent 
an ultimate early rave collection, all blended in a furious 
22-track DJ mix.''

Nothing more to add, enjoy!
