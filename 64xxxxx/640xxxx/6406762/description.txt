1878 in New Mexico: John Tunstall picks up young gun men from the road to have them work on his ranch, but also to teach them reading and to civilize them. However he's a thorn in the side of the rich rancher Murphy, as hes a competitor in selling cattle. One day he's shot by Murphys men. Judge Wilson can't do anything, since Sheriff Brady is one of Murphys men. But attorney Alex persuades him to make Tunstalls young friends deputies and give them warrants for the arrest of the murderers. Instead of arresting them, William Bonney just shoots them down. Soon the young guns become famous and William gets the name "Billy the Kid" - but they're also chased by dozens of Murphys men and the army.
