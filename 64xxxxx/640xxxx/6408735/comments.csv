,hack3rs_unite,2011-05-20T21:34Z,"Hey Mbb15, I got all the steps except the first one
""Change the PARAM.sfo of LA Noire to BLES00933""
What exactly do you mean by this?
Do you mean go into multiman find the PARAM.sfo file and rename it to this? or rename the entire game folder to BLES00933?
I appreciate the clarification."
,syl4rski,2011-05-20T21:39Z,"I have the same question as hack3rs_unite. What does that mean?

thx for the ul"
[V],Mbb15,2011-05-20T23:38Z,"Open the param.sfo with PARAM SFO EDITOR (search on google) and change the game name from blus.... to Bles...

also you need to copy this game to the internal hdd (my fault) and just start it normal with multiman.

hope it helps"

,darkalex1,2011-05-21T02:17Z,Thanks for the upload...I am still downloading the game so will comment again after using it....
,GTOnizuka,2011-05-21T06:50Z,"Works great! Thanks Mbb15!
Those of you who are still not sure of how...

If your copy is Europe version then just copy it to the internal hdd then load it up with Multiman using select + X then it will ask you about param.sfo changing to 3.55. Click 'ok'.
once you are back on ps3 XMB, install the package then select + X the LA noire straight from the PS3 XMB screen and you are on the way!"

,GTOnizuka,2011-06-04T00:06Z,"Yeah guys...it's definitely working. I have EUR version and this fix works without any scratch and looking at the comments on USA ver. it would work fine. Just carefully try all the possible methods if one won't work. That's what I do....EXPERIMENT! Search google and shit do get all the possible scenarios...after all, you are getting a free game so...why complaining so much..?

I initially edited the file with my notepad and already deleted rar archive with game, so i'm stuck, because my ps3 sees broken game files only and param.sfo cannot be edited properly anymore. Please, it's only about 1mb..."
