Now that he had helped Ringo attempt to resuscitate his recording career,
it was time for Paul to figure out the next move of his own. With the
(apparent) help of Denny Laine on some songs, he laid down several demos
for a projected new LP project that would reunite him with George Martin.
An August 1980 compilation of demos was prepared for George consisting of
old and new material for consideration for the upcoming LP project.

The running order of the tape was as follow:
- Seems Like Old limes
- Ballroom Dancing
- Take It Away
- Turkey And Peacock (perhaps an early version of Peacocks)
- It\\\'s As Simple As That (Tremolo Cello)
- Robber Riff
- We All Stand Together
- Stiff Tracks (most likely \\\"Boil Crisis\\\" and \\\"Give Us A Chord, Roy\\\" which
were much like the tunes being released by Stiff Records at the time)
- Keep Under Cover
- Average Person
- The Unbelievable Experience
- Stop, You Don\\\'t Know Where She Came From
- Wanderlust
- Ebony And Ivory

While some of the songs (\\\"Ballroom Dancing\\\", \\\"Take It Away\\\") were particularly
strong, some of the tunes Paul submitted (\\\"The Unbelievable Experience\\\", \\\"Boil
Crisis\\\") were bad enough to force George to tell Paul to scrap them and write
more; this he did. In 1995, excerpts of several tracks were aired on various
episodes of \\\"Oobu Joobu\\\", and although they were in superb quality, all of
the airings were incomplete.
