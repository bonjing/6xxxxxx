Charles H. Sherman, John L. Butler, "Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound"
Springer | 2007-02-15 | ISBN: 0387329404 | 612 pages | PDF 

The subject of this book is the theory, development and design of electroacoustic transducers for underwater applications. It is more comprehensive than any existing book in this field. It includes the basics of the six major types of electroacoustic transducers and shows why piezoelectric ceramic transducers are the most suitable for underwater sound. It presents the basic acoustic concepts and models needed in transducer and transducer array development, and discusses most currently used transducer designs. It analyzes nonlinear effects and describes methods of transducer evaluation and measurement. The extensive Appendix and numerous diagrams provide an up to date source for use by students and practicing engineers and scientists.
