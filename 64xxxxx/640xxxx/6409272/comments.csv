,vividh,2011-07-11T08:48Z,"These all concepts seem fascinating and these products seem too good to be true. 
I am a very skeptical person. so I doubt if they ever work or not. I have not tried any of them but sure they seem fascinating. Are they really effective?
I mean the concept told in ""Photoreading"" is superb. If anyone can learn to read so fast it could revolutionize the reading but it has not. 
Does anyone has any practical experience in this area. 
Has anybody tried Photoreading or this Genuis code course? Please tell me if they had some noticeable change in them? "
,vividh,2011-07-11T08:49Z,@ some-young-guy. I didn't know that in good will hunting he photoreads. This is an interesting fact.
