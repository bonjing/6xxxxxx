This special report was compiled for 1-year, between May 2010 and May 2011 and is the same content found at http://www.asap-care.org . This "inconvenient truth" is 95-pages and provides clear and convincing evidence that all health care workers must become certified in palliative care. Hundreds of millions of people--at any given time--are being denied the basic human right of treatment with palliative care. During the past 3+ decades, billions of dollars have been expended to study this needless and persistent global problem. This special report clearly reveals the problem and also provides a practical and SIMPLE solution. 

Warning! Don't be victimized by this senseless situation! Read this report and save yourself or a loved one from being slowly tortured to death at the hands of ignorant and greedy health care workers. Millions of people ("patients") are needless dying prolonged and insufferable deaths each year because of this situation. Take action!
