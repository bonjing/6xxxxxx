         Two versions of the American dream now stand     
         in sharp contrast. One views the money you       
         earned as yours and best allocated by you; the   
         other believes that an elite in Washington       
         knows best how to allocate your wealth. One      
         champions the traditional American dream,        
         which has played out millions of times through   
         generations of Americans, of improving one's     
         lot in life and even daring to dream and build   
         big. The other holds that there is no end to     
         the "good" the government can do by taking and   
         spending other peoples' money in an              
         ever-burgeoning list of programs. The            
         documentary film I Want Your Money exposes the   
         high cost in lost freedom and in lost            
         opportunity to support a Leviathan-like          
         bureaucratic state.
