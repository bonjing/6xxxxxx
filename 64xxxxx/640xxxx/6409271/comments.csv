Audio seems synced however every so often you will get a awful screeching sound for like 15-30 seconds...so far happened twice

Thanks for the UP BiDA/razvanripper"

please"
,sharaz_ali,2011-05-21T14:27Z,"took me 8 minutes to download, video 5 audio 5. THANKS FOR THIS. seeding now...."
,sharaz_ali,2011-05-21T19:24Z,"THIS DOES NOT HAVE THE POST CREDITS, BUT ITS OKAY. THANKS UPLOADER. In the post-credits scene of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Blackbeard's voodoo doll of Captain Jack Sparrow washes ashore in front of Angelica. She picks it up, and smiles as she realizes she can have her revenge. So there will be a Pirates of the Caribbean 5 in most likely the year (2013)."
,sharaz_ali,2011-05-21T20:36Z,when played through vlc media player no awful screeching sound. play it with other players and you get the awful screeching sound.
,Navirio,2011-05-22T02:42Z,2 the people complaining about froggie. he upped it originally and raz took that and synced so they both worked hard and deserve credit. dont shit talk either of them.
,adamant19,2011-05-23T02:26Z,"Thank you... Ill seed this until its not in-demand...
A=6/7(depends on your speaker)
V=8
Good TS copy... Soo Watchable..."
,zzappp,2011-05-23T17:12Z,"guys, if youre having trouble with audio being out of sync, downlaod VLC player. you can find it, just google it. it has a audio resync. all you do is type in the ammount of secconds that you want it to lag/be ahead. this will fix the audio."
