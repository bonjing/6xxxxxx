A bizarre movie about scientific experimentation to improve on humankind taken to an extreme absurdity. Rogue scientists in a cabin are at the end of their rope, having created a failed species of strange forest-humans that can only constantly play in the woods naked, infecting others with their failures. They continue their experiments on themselves, attempting to fuse trees with humans by shoving wooden spikes into their bodies using a variety of odd methods, including a complicated, mechanical, wooden iron-maiden. In the meantime, soldiers are trying to track down and kill the forest creatures now led by a strange psychic who fights violent battles for them. Amidst all these highly strange happenings, we get some musings and discussions on human mutation, progress and transformation with a nonsensical mix of mysticism and science, footage of science improving on siamese twins by cutting them apart, and other strange odds and ends.
