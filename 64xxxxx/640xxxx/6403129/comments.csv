,brionh,2011-05-30T02:07Z,Ok never mind -> just deleted the .PAR to make it the .mkv extension and works fine.  Thank you again ULer!! you rock!
,useitright,2011-05-30T18:32Z,Sounds like a lot of crap to go through when you could just get the damn avi file.
,funkEfresh,2011-09-25T09:00Z,"There's no PAR file, and there's nothing to extract.  Couldn't be easier.  And I'll take an MKV over an AVI."
,jfhjr,2011-12-30T07:09Z,Have to agree couldn't be easier to watch these on a PC. Using VLC Media Player here which plays any audio/video I've EVER come across so far. THANKS for this full season quality release!
