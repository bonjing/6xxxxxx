Musically, there is a great distance between the "live" Smithers, rocking over the sweet guitar, stomping his feet and bellowing out lyrics and notes, and the produced, rich, full sounds on albums such as these. This is the one I play most on the radio, especially the "deeper" cuts in the middle of the album and, of course, "Small Revelations" itself; the others I listen to alone after a long day, immersing myself in the raw voice and stomp of the foot. Most folks like one or the other best, but I don't think one can choose -- it's almost as if he were two great musicians, not just one. So I recommend all of Smithers' work, from the oldest songs now covered by the likes of Bonnie Raitt to the newest sound on the other end of the "live" spectrum, like "Small revelations" -- but buy this one first if 1) you need an introduction to his work (and then get a live session album, too), or 2) if you need an album to introduce your friends to Smithers. Then find them copies of "I Feel the same," "It ain't easy," and "Real Fine Love," the best Smithers' songs anywhere, both live and produced
