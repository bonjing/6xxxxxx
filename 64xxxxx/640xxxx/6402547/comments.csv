No taste in films .. And who are you to judge that? Don't everybody have different taste in movies? I love this movie even if it's a bit exaggerative with the lines sometimes .. This is a well-deserved movie to watch! You ain't gonna be dissapointed .. : ) "
,prank8687,2011-05-18T14:57Z,plz do transporter trio......
,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-18T15:45Z,"i've already seen this shallow excuse of a film. people who keep requesting such hollywood bullshit are not intelligent enough to appreciate quality films, like yify's previous upload - in the name of the father. those who like shit have shitty taste in films - as simple as that.

Die and rot in hell"
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-18T15:58Z,"@fearloathingandparanoia

I like this film I also like In the name of the father, I also like La Dolce Vita, I even enjoy Battleship Portemkin, I love Fanny and Alexander I love Saw I appreciate Ghost Rider I visit pornhub every day.

But you won't have to think about all that...You can just criticize everyone...Douchebag"

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-05-18T18:28Z,@downTyu - a person who cannot distinguish between good apples and bad apples is a fucking moron. the fact that you seem proud to be one shows how hopelessly stupid you are.

dude y r u fighting over this movie...this movie is just superb and u r not the one who should decide over what is good or bad...if u really appreciate artistic form of cinema than u'll also love this because of its new cinematography techniques...every movie has its different form and we should be happy with this fact that uploaders like yify have provide us the every form of cinema for free......don't fight over this friend just enjoy movies for free:)"
,nbuzz98,2011-05-20T08:09Z,"@fearloathingandparanoia..........dude,why don't you just shut up! if you don't like the movie, no one's forcing you to download it!! you are just waisting our time.........."
