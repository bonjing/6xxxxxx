The loss of Swedish pianist EsbjÃ¶rn Svensson in a diving accident in 2008 confronted his two long-time partners, bassist Dan Berglund and drummer Magnus Ostrom, with a dilemma as well as a personal loss, since neither had played outside EST in 15 years. Ostrom (like Berglund, on his Tonbruket venture last year) avoids EST mimicry, but seeks links between the trio\'s evolution and his own prog-rock and synth-texture roots. The influence of the Pat Metheny Group on EST surfaces in some of the pulsing grooves and swelling vocal chants â€“ Metheny and Berglund even make a guest appearance on the poignant Ballad for E. Otherwise, Ostrom and his new group explore pumping-heartbeat electronics that power simple, ringing melodies, quirky themes reminiscent of Zappa or early Soft Machine, plus wistful pop song or hymnal melodies, and a good deal of jazz-rock drive under whirling wah-wah guitar solos from the excellent Andreas Hourdakis. The improv is limited, and it\'s clearly a new partnership feeling its way, but this is a more convincing start than Berglund\'s Tonbruket.     (John Fordham)
