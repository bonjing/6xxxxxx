,DuckXXXL,2011-05-19T20:21Z,"Downloaded rapidly, transfered it for use with  MapSource with Gmaptool and yes, MapSource showed the map properly. However, I can't zoom out to more than 50km; I shows total blanc. I can't see why this happens."

,go2pub,2011-05-24T15:21Z,"Works perfectly on my nuvi 250w just extract, make a new folder called garmin on a 2gb SD card and copy the gmapsupp.img file into it. Pop the SD card into the nuvi and away you go, to problems."
,DJAbi7,2011-05-26T00:33Z,"Ik weet niet of het werkt, maar het verschijnt op mijn scherm dat de kaart effectief actief is. Ik zie geen verschil met die van 2008...

I don't know if it works, but it appears on my screen and it's actif. I don't see a diffrence between this and 2008...

,dvgjkes12,2011-06-06T17:55Z,"This doesn't work: the maps load in my device (Nuvi 255), but I can't search for an address. The maps also seem very small: only 1.6GB, while previous maps were 2.2GB. Can someone please post a working version?"
,Merlix,2011-06-10T14:23Z,"Hi, doesn't work for me neither... unable to enter a new adress... I can only take some already entered with a previous version of CN..."

,EamonnOC,2011-06-16T22:32Z,"Could anyone post a link how i can install this on a Garmin StreetPilot c550? I dont have an SD card, is there any other way to do it?"
,subestrenos9,2011-06-23T03:52Z,"++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Installation:
- after unpacking the file rename it to ""gmapprom.img""
- place it into a folder named ""Garmin"" on a micro sd / sd card
The previous to steps are very important
- insert the card into your garmin nÃ¼vi 250 (the one I used)
- start the garmin => go to maps => maps info and select the new map (both maps, the old and new should be visible)

Thanks to the uploader. This works really. Also many thanks that you did an upload with only western & center Europe, as my Garmin only accepts SD cards with 2GB. Nevertheless it would be even more usefull next time if you include this detailed installation instruction to your uploads.
Thank you again.

Otherwise you will not be able to search for an address (see problems described from other users above). This way everything is like usual (searching for addresses) but the maps are fresh and new and show the new streets, etc.

,liger,2011-07-08T07:14Z,Follow these instructions if you need help : www.haklabs.com/2011/garmin-2012-map-update/
,grumpyg,2011-07-08T23:08Z,"Thanks very much dutchghost. Very good and very useful. Other guys MUST remember, to get to address search the SD card must be in and BOTH maps must be ticked in the Tools/ Maps setting. Otherwise my 255w doesnt even know what country it's in Lol"
,H8machine,2011-07-09T11:55Z,Is there any way to use only this map? Using this and old map at same time (in garmins memory) causing it doesnt recognize new roads and addresses. 
,myunclesmailman,2011-07-11T22:29Z,"I followed subestrenos9's v3 installation instructions to get the 2012 maps working on my Garmin 265WT, but did NOT succeed.

However, when I put the 2012 map on the internal memory (which is finally possible due to the small size, thank you!) and name it gmapprom.img AND put the old map on my SD-card and name it gmapsupp.img, it does work.

It does make you wonder which map you are actually looking at during the drive, since the 2012 map does not work on its own..."
,arkal,2011-07-13T04:54Z,"Sorry, but this map is NOT COMPLETE.  There is enough here to upgrade an existing euro map, but not enough to do city searches, etc. if you are replacing another map (like N. America).

A working map source is http://gpsunderground.com/forum/  Of course, if someone was to host one of THESE maps, it would work."
,skinny_gorilla,2011-07-14T02:44Z,"I'm using Garmin Nuvi 1300 and below you will find instructs that worked for me:

1. rename sd card - GARMIN (in capitals) 

2. open sd card and create new folder and rename it - garmin (lower case) 

3. unzip file and place  gmapsupp.img  into garmin folder you have just created. 

4. place sd card into sat nav and boot it up. 

5. go to tools then to settings and map and finally to info and make sure these new maps have the box checked and all other boxes, if any, unchecked 

6. If this doesn't work or when you switch on your sat nav the bar will not go to the end and just stops you do not have enough space internally on your sat nav and you will not be able to use these maps.

Good Luck and Big Thanks to dutchghost for saving me some euros!!!"
,sjirkie,2011-07-14T22:11Z,"Thank you very mutch, i hope it's working. I will post if it works."
,skuassimo,2011-07-17T12:20Z,"I'm able to install it, but i'm not able to look for a specific address. if i try to do that, it asks which state i'm in, and i'm not in the states, so there's nothing i can select. it's possible to navigate to a destination i've defined earlier or point on the map, but the details on the map are also somehow peculiar. it seems that it mostly displays unessential names such as lakes."
,tomber99,2011-08-25T01:35Z,"Have garmin 350 with North American Map. I loaded the 4 GB SD card with the unlocked European IMG file. Garmin recognized the European map, but without the American map checked you cannot enter anything. (Asks for State, does not recognize any letter for State.) With American map checked you can enter American addresses, but not European. 
Found the solution:
Actually you can test the map, but cannot really see much. Here is what you do.
On your Nuvi you can tap Tools (the wrench), Settings, Map and then tap the Map Info button at the bottom of that screen. It will list any map products it sees and the one(s) it is using will be checked. 

While in the US make sure that the Europe maps are unchecked.

When in Europe make sure the US maps are unchecked.

To test your Europe maps when you get the card, you can check both US and Europe maps (it won't hurt anything), then View Map. Zoom way back out so you can almost see all of the US and drag the map over (to the right, i.e. East) so you can see Europe then zoom back in so you can look at some of the details.

When you're done go back to the Map Info screen and uncheck the Europe maps or just remove the card."
