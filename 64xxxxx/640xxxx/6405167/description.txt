This torrent was created out of the relief of success after the frustration of defeat in the pursuit of installing Myst V EOA on my Macbook Pro running OSX 10.6.7. These instructions are tailored to installation on OSX 10.6.x and probably others though I have not personally tried. This is the only successful way installation I have ever had of the game (yes, even including editing .java files in Terminal to work around permissions. PLUS this is far, FAR easier.) P.S. PLEASE SEED!!!!! 
Note: I did not create any of the installers or patches. I have only compiled files for easiest way to install "Myst V EOA". However this ReadMe file is of my own creation. 

Step 1:
Open: "Myst V EOA.iso" to mount the disk image to your desktop

Step 2:
Open: "Myst_V_Installer_Patcher.dmg" to mount the disk image to your desktop

Step 3:
Initiate the patcher by double-clicking the "Myst V Installer Patcher" icon in the window that appears and wait until installation is complete. You can install Myst V EOA into whatever directory you choose during installation.

Step 4:
Open: "Myst.5.EOA.v1.0.NoDVD.Crack.dmg" to initiate the noDVD crack. Agree to the terms and conditions then double-click the "Black Moon" looking icon on the following window.

Step 5:
Enter your user password for your mac. Installer will launch, click "Continue", choose the drive that you installed "Myst V EOA" on and click "Continue", then click "Install". Installation of DVD crack will ensue.

Step 6: 
ENJOY!!!
Your "Myst V End of Ages" application bundle will be located wherever you opted to install it, and you are free to drag it wherever else you may need it. (Applications folder, Games folder, Desktop, USB driveâ€¦ wherever!!!)
