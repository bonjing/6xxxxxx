I spend around two days to sort out this issue with xlive.dll after installing the game. "

You need to do this:

1. Disconnect the Internet
2. Mount or burn image

4. Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game
5. Copy the poul.dll files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation.

[ NOW WHAT I DIDEN KNOW]

6. Install the gfwlivesetup.exe from the G4W folder on the DVD
7. Now LIVE start up. Creat a new account.
scroll down and klik the link ""create local profile"" (Create a offline account)
8. If you installed. updadede and pastede the dll right. the game will now start.

Pleas copy and past, if this works for you!!
And yes! My antivirus also show poul.dll but I accepted it!

-to people experiencing crash-
â€œFable 3 / Fable III Main Executable Has Stopped Workingâ€ / Runtime Error / Crashes to Desktop (CTD / C2D) / Fail (Failure) to Launch / Black Screen
When running the EXE, you may encounter this error message randomly in regards to Fable3.exe causing an APPCRASH. It may be related to XLIVE.DLL or your save files being in the wrong location. Of course, it could be related to the Windows Live ID Sign-in or some other problems. This also happens after obtaining the guild seal sometimes or even several other things. Try the following:

â€“ Download and Install Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5 choosing between the 64bit and 32bit versions depending on your Windows operating system
â€“ Try to register your xlive.dll by going to Start -> Run â€” cmd â€” then type in REGSVR32 /u C:\path\to\the\xlive.dll
â€“ Run the Fable 3 exe in Windows XP compatibility Service Pack 3 (SP3) mode, Launcher, as well as Steam and any other related file
â€“ Close any program that could possibly interfere with the game or its components (i.e. a firewall)
â€“ Go to the Control Panel and choose uninstall/reinstall and choose REPAIR
â€“ Reinstall / Repair Games For Windows Live / GWL
â€“ Reboot your computer
â€“ Reinstall Microsoft Games for Windows and Windows Live Essentials (GFWL / GWL / WLE). You can repair Microsoft Life Essentials via the Control Panel instead, but try reinstalling completely if that does not work.
â€“ Try logging into the Games for Windows Marketplace before launching / opening Fable 3
â€“ After reinstalling GFWL, copy the xlive.dll from C:\Windows\System32 and paste it in \Steam\steamapps\common\fable 3\ to fix the xlive.dll error. Try registering it if necessary with the CMD from above."
