this is Black Ops plus both of the map packs, first strike and escalation. Must have at least 8 gig thumb drive to transfer the game from pc to the 360, instructions and usb interface included. multiplayer works, but i haven't figured out how to get the map packs working online. both map packs both work offline though so you can play the zombie maps. the readme will explain how to log in and log out and what not.
