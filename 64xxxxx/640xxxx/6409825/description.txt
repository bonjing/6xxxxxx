Part 2. The Lakes.
Griff Rhys Jones explores the mountains of Britain. A few hundred years ago, the Lake District was highly unpopular, but today the picturesque area is visited by 12 million people every year. Griff discovers how, with a little help from William Wordsworth, The Lakes became a source of inspiration to other writers and artists, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The dramatic terrain also encouraged visitors to find spirtual fulfillment in nature, and was the birthplace of the Quaker movement.
