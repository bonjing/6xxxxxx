Storyline
The film shows the heroic defense of the Brest Fortress, which had taken upon the first strike of German 
fascist invaders on June 22 1941. Story describes the events of the first days of the defense. 
The film tells about three main resistance zones, headed by the regiment commander, Pyotr Mikhailovich Gavrilov, 
the commissar Efim Moiseevich Fomin and the head of the 9th frontier outpost, Andrey Mitrofanovich
Kizhevatov. Many years later veteran Alexander Akimov again and again recalls the memories of the time, when he, 
then a 15 year old Sasha Akimov was deeply in love with the beautiful Anya and suddenly found himself in the 
middle of the bloody events of war.
