Why would you post episodes 7,9, & 10 of Volume 1, for example, and not episodes 1-6 or 8?

Not being unappreciative just wondering how such a randomly incomplete up could occur.  Am I the only one with a fetish for the chronological around here?"

Because I don't own BBC Radio
I can't tell them what eps to buy
I can't tell them which ones to broadcast

I can tell you to go find a better version that is to your satisfaction 


As per usual I click your name ""balanced"" and see you have not posted 1 single torrent under that name."
