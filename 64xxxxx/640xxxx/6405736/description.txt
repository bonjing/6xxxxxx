The Twilight Zone - Audio Sci-Fi Drama - BBC7 
37 x 32 to 47 Minute Episodes - 128Kbps - Mp3 - Slimoo
 


The Twilight Zone Radio Dramas is a nationally syndicated radio adaptation of the classic television series The Twilight Zone.

Launched in October 2002. Many of the stories are based on Rod Serling's scripts from the original Twilight Zone series, and are slightly expanded and updated to reflect contemporary technology and trends (e.g., the mention of "cell phones" and "CD-ROMs" which, of course, weren't around when the television show aired in the 1960s). 




[b]There is an issue with naming these.

BBC7 decided to call the new set - Series 02.
BBC7 are the only station to call them series 02.
They never called the first lot - Series 01!.

I have decided to use the Wiki listings for the CD Volumes for naming.
15 Volumes with 10 Episodes each.[/b]
