BOOK INFO:

This collection of readily reproducible methods using the latest advances in NMR technology includes methods for high-level recombinant protein expression using sophisticated isotopic labeling strategies, TROSY methods for the study of structure and dynamics, and methods for the acquisition and interpretation of residual dipolar coupling data. There are also applications of dynamics measurements on multiple timescales, new developments in NMR data analysis, structure calculation protocols, and solid-state methods. The protocols follow the successful Methods in Molecular BiologyÃ¢â€žÂ¢ series format, each offering detailed laboratory instructions, an introduction outlining the principle behind the technique, lists of equipment and reagents, and tips on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls.
