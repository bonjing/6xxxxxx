Also please support Zatanna, Issue #13 hits stands today!"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-19T04:44Z,"Also: Small typo on my part, should be JLA: Zatanna's Search, obviously."
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-19T06:28Z,"1 Seeder (me) 58 Leechers... Come on guys, when you hit 100% leave it to seed fo awhile - Its only fair"
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-19T08:26Z,Thanks Seeders :D
[T],MrDowntown,2011-05-19T18:29Z,Yes and No. They do in JLA Zatanna's Search which is a collection of Zatanna's first appearances. I have not yet collected Zatanna's most recent appearances in Comics (other than her self-title). If anyone knows which issues of which series she has appeared in I can start tracking them down for a Zatanna Collection 2 :D
