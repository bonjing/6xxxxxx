,TheEmpathicEar,2011-05-20T00:21Z,"Woo! Nice job!

NOTE: The track listing for the special edition is slightly different from the standard. i.e. ""Bad Kids"" is 9 or 10. I just wanted to point this out, so poor Chris does not get a flood of ""What ups???""."

Stop buying your CDs at Wal-Mart, people."
