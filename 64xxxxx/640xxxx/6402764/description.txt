   Maria Saakyan's elegiac, semi-autobiographical slice-of-life drama  
   THE LIGHTHOUSE unfolds in the very early '90s, against the          
   backdrop of the Caucasus wars that plagued Georgia, Armenia, and    
   Azerbaijan. As the scope of this mass-scaled conflict extends       
   itself to one woman's small village, she is forced to drop          
   everything, move to Moscow, and start over from scratch -- thus     
   bidding farewell to her hometown and way of life, perhaps           
   indefinitely.
