,Savonarola,2011-05-20T18:50Z,"Editing is disabled at the moment, so I'll use this as a brief description.  This is Rosetta Stone Version 3 Latin.  Included are Levels 1, 2, and 3.  This is the actual V3 and not the older V2 that was mislabeled as V3 in the past.

This is only the language disks, you will need the actual Rosetta Stone application to read these .iso files.

Enjoy,

Savonarola"

,catgrrrl,2011-05-22T06:10Z,thanks heaps!
,Axeldor,2011-05-22T15:15Z,"Hello all!

First my thanks to Savanarola for this upload, as all interested know it was one of the rare cases of content not previously avaliable on the general network.
Second, I do not want to incite panic so could please someone confirm it first - during the installation of the first and third cds, the latest version of Norton Internet Security registered a threat called 'Bloodhound.Exploit.193' a heuristic virus of low level threat.

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2008-062316-3633-99&vid=39776 - link to Symantec site. 

I have absolutely if it is a part of the program that is deemed unsafe or possibly an intentional or unintentional infection of the torrent. Would appreciate a confirmation from a person with a technical knowledge greater then my own.

Thanks,

Axeldor"
,Savonarola,2011-05-22T16:43Z,"I'm not sure why that is occurring, I did find this though:

http://community.norton.com/t5/Norton-Internet-Security-Norton/Possible-False-Postives-Bloodhound-Exploit-52-and-Bloodhound/td-p/402782

If you type 'Bloodhound.Exploit.193' into Google the first thing that pops up is 'Bloodhound.Exploit.193 rosetta stone' so I assure you it is none of my doing but is something related to the Rosetta Stone software in general.  I suspect it to be a false positive.

I welcome anyone to look into this, the only files contained in this torrent are .iso files so it should be perfectly safe to investigate with MagicISO or something."
,yosoyusuario,2011-05-24T04:20Z,"Your Nick called my atention. Girolamo Savonarola was, if I am right, the hardest oponent of mighty people like Lorenzo de MĂŠdici and Pope Alejandro VI. About your torrent, if this is what I think it is, my respects to You. I promise to seed this torrent for a while. Thanks a lot, my friend. I hope this is virus free. I don't download but only from users with a skull, however, I'm gonna make an exception here. Once again, thanks.  "
,Savonarola,2011-05-24T05:19Z,"You are correct about the historic personage, Savonarola.  This is the only torrent I've ever uploaded so I apologize for not being more clear in the name and description, I didn't realize the editing was down.  "
,Gabriel2535,2011-05-25T00:34Z,"Savonarola, please, post also the audio companion."
,yosoyusuario,2011-05-25T05:56Z,"All right: this the complete 3 levels of this facitating language (latin). Thanks a lot Savonarola. Keep seeding good things and pretty soon You're gonna thounsands of followers (just like Girolamo, who gathered 15,000 people in one of his celebration of mass). For everyone interested in this upload, here are a few tips:
1. As i said, it's the 3 levels of latin language.
2. The torrent is absolutly clean, which means, it's virus free. If your antivirus tells it's got a virus, just ignore it, that's what is known as ""false possitive"". 
3. The torrents contain 3 disc images; You can burn it on cd's or mount it with alcohol, winmount or any other similar program.
4. If You have any problem on windows 7, try installing it by right-cliking on your mouse and choosing  execute as administrator.
5. The crack works fine.
6. You're gonna need the Rosetta stone 3.4.5 or 4.4.7 to run the image and install it. This versions are uploaded in this same page. but it would be good if Savonarola could upload it.
Anyway. Great job, Savonarola. You are my hero. I'm gonna keep an eye on You and your torrents    "
,Savonarola,2011-05-25T08:21Z,"Gabriel, sorry I no longer have access to the audio companion cds.  My computer's cd drive is very touchy (read: crappy) and I had issues with the audio companions.

Yosoyusuario, thanks a lot.  Also, very good point about needing a later release of Rosetta Stone V3, I had to update mine and I forgot to mention it."

,nillbugwtw,2011-06-09T01:28Z,"Been looking for this FOREVER, thanks!"
,WhitePhilosopher,2011-06-10T06:51Z,Can someone please include how to make everything work? I already downloaded the torrent and i have daemon tools lite. Can someone help here and explain in steps?
,Savonarola,2011-06-15T23:37Z,"Ok, what you need to do first is download the actual Rosetta Stone application.  This torrent is just the language disks.  Just do a search for Rosetta Stone and go for the newest version of it you can find.  Once you have that installed and cracked, just mount these .iso's and follow the installation instructions.  Nothing special needs to be done to make these work once you have a current version of Rosetta Stone installed."
,neohotch,2011-06-16T04:52Z,"Works fine, I'll seed it from now on, thanks for sharing this. Latin is the source for all romance languages and many English words."
