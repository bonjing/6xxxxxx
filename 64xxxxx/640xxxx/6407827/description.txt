This is the complete Fablehaven series by Brandon Mull in PDF format. All the books are completely readable, and I think all but the 4th book includes the artwork from inside the book (but I might be wrong; I haven't read these in a long time. Let us know in the comments if you have the time to find out). I didn't make any of these, I just brought them together from different sites around the web. 

The books are:
1- Fablehaven
2- Rise of the Evening Star
3- Grip of the Shadow Plague
4- Secrets of the Dragon Sanctuary
5- Keys to the Demon Prison

No RARs or other compression, just 5 great PDF books in a folder. Get a free copy of Adobe Acrobat to read these (Google should find it easily) or grab thethingy's torrent of the full version. Enjoy!
