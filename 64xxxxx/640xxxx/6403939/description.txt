Rigmor Gustafsson is a highly acclaimed Swedish jazz singer who achieved considerable success in the US with Close To You, full of perfect, jazzy interpretations of Dionne Warwick songs. Gustafsson has a lot going for her - a voice that ranges from pure vanilla crÃ¨me to frothy chocolate-mocha mousse, perfect intonation, a graceful way of stretching out over the ultra-hip accompaniment of pianist Jacky Terrasson's trio, and the nuanced attentions of producer Nils Landgren.
