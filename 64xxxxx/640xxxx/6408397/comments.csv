,muzmiz,2011-09-27T13:27Z,"Holy Fucking Shit Ballz!  This movie is so fucked up, I'm a grown ass man, and I still whinced like a little girl throughout many parts of this movie lol.  I can't believe I had never heard of it befor.  I wiki'd the movie an director after I watched it, an the director was actually arrested an charged with murder, obscenity, and making a snuff film.  He was aquitted of murder, but did time for the others.  Wow, wow, wow.  I don't even know how I feel about this movie myself lol, it was extremely graphic and offensive, but at the same time, ultra realistic and makes you question your own beliefs in civilized humanity lol."
[V],joshua13,2011-10-08T16:44Z, I guess film hits new heights of realism in special effects. The director had to proved the actors were still alive. He was charged also with animal cruelty for the real slaughter of the animals. I haven't seen it yet so I have no idea if that was any worse than what is  done to food animals every day or if he really did it with unnecessary cruelty. I am not a vegetarian but support humane slaughtering methods.
[V],joshua13,2011-10-08T16:47Z," btw this is the most banned horror film ever. 15 countries had bans later lifted, 4 more still in force and  intended as permanent. "
,nomad169,2011-12-22T20:44Z,What is the duration of this movie? is it 95 mins or 90?
,DeadRedRabbit,2011-12-24T13:34Z,"This film is legend! So cleverly made, but def not for the faint hearted!"
,da-ekko,2012-04-05T12:06Z,"lol faces of death is much worse (in the creepy way)
