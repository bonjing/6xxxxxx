The music on Batik is truly a heavenly experience of great composition - like no other, great playing, and the kind of communication among the musicians only heard in the likes of the Bill Evans trio of the early 1960's and of the great Miles Davis band of the same period. This music though, is truly original in concept and in sound, and yet strangely enough, no school of playing seems to have come from it. It stands alone. I highly reccommend the recording for all thoughtful listeners who desire music played with a sense of mystery, an unidentifiable unity of message and superb musicianship. It is truly a work of art in jazz and improvised music.
