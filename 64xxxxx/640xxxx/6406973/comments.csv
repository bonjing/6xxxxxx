PhotoshopÂ® CS5 Extended, IllustratorÂ® CS5, InDesignÂ® CS5.5, DreamweaverÂ® CS5.5, FlashÂ® Professional CS5.5, Flash CatalystÂ® CS5.5, FireworksÂ® CS5, AcrobatÂ® X Pro, Bridge CS5, Device Central CS5.5

And Master Collection includes:

PhotoshopÂ® CS5 Extended, IllustratorÂ® CS5, InDesignÂ® CS5.5, AcrobatÂ® X Pro, FlashÂ® CatalystÂ® CS5.5, Flash Professional CS5.5, Flash BuilderÂ® 4.5 Premium Edition, DreamweaverÂ® CS5.5, FireworksÂ® CS5, Contribute CS5, Adobe PremiereÂ® Pro CS5.5, After EffectsÂ® CS5.5, Adobe AuditionÂ® CS5.5, Adobe OnLocationâ„¢ CS5, EncoreÂ® CS5, Bridge CS5, Device Central CS5.5, Media Encoder CS5.5

The difference is big. 
You have inside instruction how to activate After effects, but not After effects itself.

Otherwise it is ok. It works :)"

Just a quick question. I tried installing it, got past the first registration key, but then it asks for a previous version key for the upgrade.

How do I get past this problem?"
,burnoutz,2011-07-02T01:23Z,"Thanks for the upload. Very much appreciated.

One thing. I only installed PS, ILL, InD and Acro Pro. All work great. However, English was not an available option to install in. So now I have those programs installed in Spanish (Acro Pro is in English though, yay!). Anyone know how I can get the other programs to be in English???

I've seen it done on the PC version, but can and how on a MAC.

Thanks in advance,
