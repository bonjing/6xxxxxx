Description: Here he writes about this bootleg directly himself teyper:
This is Dream TheaterÒ‘s first time in Curitiba. Amazing show.
Also this is my first time with the camera, so itÒ‘s a bit shaky at times. Still enjoyable to watch, I guess.
Quite good picture and sound.
The show is almost complete. A few bits missing to change batteries.
I hope you guys enjoy it.
