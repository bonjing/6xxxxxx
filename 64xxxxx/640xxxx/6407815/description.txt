History Channel: Secrets at Delphi

For close to a thousand years, Delphi ruled supreme as the religious heart of the ancient Greek Empire. Kings, generals, priests and common folk undertook the arduous journey to the mountains of central Greece to consult with the famous oracle of Delphi.

Based in an elegant complex of temples and monuments, the oracle was a shrine where messages from the god of Apollo were vocalized by a human intermediary. Wars might be won or lost, fortunes made or squandered, on a word from the oracle.

Uncover the layers of mystery shrouding the site of Delphi, the mythology, the ancient accounts and the stories of extraordinary happenings that took place at this spiritual centre.
