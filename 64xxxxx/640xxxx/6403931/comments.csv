Anyway, tomorrow i will watch it and reply back about the quality 
Thanks!!"
,bpbutti,2011-07-17T18:36Z,"i'm on episode 18 now and untill now i haven't had troubles, they are all in english, and quality of the image and the sound are really good"

Glad you're enjoying it."

MORE STUFF LIKE THIS"
,xsxbrownxsx,2011-08-24T09:47Z,"Great! Thanks for this. I'm watching it right now. I was just wondering if there was any way you could put this up in a .mp4 format, or something like that. The player I need to use in order to play these videos isn't the best. Anyway, really appreciate you putting this up here. Thanks again."

If you wanna convert them, use this. It's incredibly easier and it'd be much faster than downloading :]"
,Elhnaras,2011-09-24T19:28Z,"I downloaded it and it was all great!
But, at the end of episode 64 it looks like there are more episodes, I looked everywhere but couldn't find them, so are there any more episodes?"
,ManOfSkate,2011-10-27T10:09Z,This is the exact same quality as the 18GB one. So I'd recommend this one to anyone thinking they'll get better quality with the other one.
,Teddikilla,2011-11-06T17:07Z,"@ManOfSkate , yeah it is :]
And @Elhnaras,  No, they only made 64 episodes :\"
