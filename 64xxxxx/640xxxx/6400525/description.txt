Dead to the World - Charlaine Harris-viny

When cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse sees a naked man on the side of the road, she doesn\'t just drive on by. Turns out the poor thing hasn\'t a clue who he is, but Sookie does. It\'s Eric the vampire--but now he\'s a kinder, gentler Eric. And a scared Eric, because whoever took his memory now wants his life.
