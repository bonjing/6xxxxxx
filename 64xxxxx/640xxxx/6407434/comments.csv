,HamertimeMan,2011-05-25T04:48Z,"Hi, It works great, everythings fine, but I have a problem: When I look through all the files for the downloaded result and I can't find ""server.properties"" I am dying to play multiplayer any help would be very much appreciated!"
,92938,2011-05-25T22:44Z,Start the server.exe and it'l make some files in the folder it is in. Then you can edit the properties.
,92938,2011-05-25T22:50Z,"My comment isnt showing up, start server.exe it will make propertes edit it."
,regen2100,2011-05-25T23:12Z,"The server.properties file is only for multiplayer
once you go to 
http://www.minecraft.net/download.jsp
and download it there should be a MinecraftServer.exe. once you click on this it will create the server.properties file that you need to edit to use multiplayer"
,regen2100,2011-05-25T23:14Z,"Oh, and if your using a Mac/Linux based operating system, you have to download the appropriate version for your OS."
,regen2100,2011-05-25T23:14Z,for multiplayer btw.
,Aldojasp,2011-07-17T20:58Z,"When I download the server tool, and I start it, it asks me to log in. But I don't have an account (obviously). IS there anyone else with this problem?"
,regen2100,2011-08-30T00:05Z,"@Aldojasp make sure your downloading the server starting software and not the normal minecraft software that legit users use to connect

its towards the bottom of the page"
