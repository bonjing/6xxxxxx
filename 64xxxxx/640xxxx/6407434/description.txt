This is the standalone launcher for Mincraft Beta

This torrent works with:
Windows
Mac
Linux (not tested yet)

In addition while logging in, you can press "force update"

This forces Minecraft to update to the latest version.
WARNING: When updating, the updater overwrites any mods 
you have installed on Minecraft. 

This version also allows you to run Minecraft from any directory
It automatically creates necessary files in the 
appropriate folder.

I JUST MOVED IT HERE SO PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO 
DIGGING FOR IT LIKE I DID.

This launcher DOES NOT work with servers that have the "online-mode"
set to true.

If you want to host a LAN game, download the server starting software here,

open server.properties and make sure it looks like this:

#Minecraft server properties
#Sun May 08 16:23:50 PDT 2011
level-name=world
hellworld=false
spawn-monsters=true
online-mode=false
spawn-animals=true
max-players=20
server-ip=
pvp=true
level-seed=

allow-flight=false
white-list=false

Then click the .exe and you should be rolling!
