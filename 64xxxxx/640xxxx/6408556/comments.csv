I was first, but had a known there was the other version coming out I would have held off. I've done my own encode of the Russian video version, but there's little point in uploading it - I was too late :( 

Never mind!"

,watbol,2011-05-21T07:42Z,"Ditto... Shakey and Small letterboxed screen.
Not full screen at all. even in full screen mode, 
there's a black box around the movie.
Wait for a better copy.
Audio is a bit muffled too.
But Thanks for try'n...
