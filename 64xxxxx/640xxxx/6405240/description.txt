x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for encoding at High-Definition, It has a high compression which which is way superior to xvid. That means when compaired to other compression types you get more quality at equal bitrates.

02. What is a .mkv file


MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard AudioVideo container (AVI is a container, too!).
