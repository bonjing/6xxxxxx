This proceedings volume includes the full research papers presented at the First International Conference on Mobile Computing, Applications, and Services (MobiCASE) held in San Diego, California, on October 26-29, 2009. MobiCASE highlights state-of-the-art academic and industry research work in domain topics above the OSI transport layer with an emphasis on complete end-to-end systems and their components. Its vision is largely influenced by what we see in the consumer space today: high-end mobile phones, high-bandwidth wireless networks, novel consumer and enterprise mobile applications, scalable software infrastructures, and of course an increasingly larger user base that is moving towards an almost all-mobile lifestyle.
