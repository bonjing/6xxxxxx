BOOK INFO:

The Doppler Effect can be thought of as the change in frequency of a wave for an observer moving relative to the source of the wave. In radar, it is used to measure the velocity of detected objects. This highly practical resource provides thorough working knowledge of the micro-Doppler effect in radar, including its principles, applications and implementation with MATLAB codes. The book presents code for simulating radar backscattering from targets with various motions, generating micro-Doppler signatures, and analyzing the characteristics of targets. In this title, professionals will find detailed descriptions of the physics and mathematics of the Doppler and micro-Doppler effect. The book provides a wide range of clear examples, including an oscillating pendulum, a spinning and precession heavy top, rotating rotor blades of a helicopter, rotating wind-turbine blades, a person walking with swinging arms and legs, a flying bird, and movements of quadruped animals.
