GLADOS TOMTOM VOICE ( PORTAL 2 )



I Take NO CREDIT for the creation of this Tom tom App.


I have tested it on my OWN Tom Tom XL and it works. Remember in order to Access the ROOT folders on your GPS you MUST install the official Tom Tom HOME 2 Application for free from here:
Code: 
http://www.tomtom.com/services/service.php?id=16
after everything is easy as explained above just copy paste thats it. 


**************************************************
GlaDOS-like voice for TomTom GPS devices.

Installation:

Place the data90.chk, data90.vif and data90.bmp files into the "voices" folder on your TomTom device.
Select the voice from the preferences menu.


NOTE:

If you already have another voice installed using the same filenames, you will need to rename the new files changing the "90" to another, unused number. You will also need to open the .vif file and change the data90.chk on the second line to use the same number.

Enjoy!!!
