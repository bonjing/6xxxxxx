Summary
 	
When Master Lu (Jue Tit-Woh) and his son Lu Shanhou (Lee King-Chue) disrupt the Lion Dance of Master Zheng (Wilson Tong)'s students, it sets in motion a dangerous rivalry between the two schools. The mutually respected Master Wong Qiying (Ku Feng) is brought in to mediate a truce, but it only serves to delay another inevitable confrontation. Master Wong's son, Wong Fei Hung (Gordon Liu) is best friends with one of the top students of Master Zheng's school, Wang Yinlin (Robert Mak), and their exploits drag a martial arts master from the north (Johnny Wang) into being a key player in the struggle between the schools of Master Lu and Master Zheng.
