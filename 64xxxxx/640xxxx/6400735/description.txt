What is this?
	Simple! It is a utility that sorts your MP3's. This program scans the filename and ID tag of the MP3 to detect the Artist. 
It then creates folders for each artist and moves the MP3 into that directory.

How do I use it?
	Select the directory containing the MP3's by pressing the "Select Dir" button.
	Now press the "Process MP3's" button.
	The files to be processed are listed in the "Files to Process" window.
	Folders being created will list in the "Processed Directories" window.
	Once completed a dialog box will appear advertising the completion.
	The "Files to Process" window will only contain the MP3's that the application was not able to process.

Why were some of my MP3's not processed?
	Some MP3's do not contain the artist within the ID tag or filename. Simply rename your MP3 with "Arist - Song 
Title.mp3" or edit the ID tag using your favourite MP3 player. Winamp is my choice. (www.winamp.com)

Will this program damange my MP3's?
	Thats silly. Of course not! It scans only the filename and ID tag in Read Only. Does not write to the MP3 file.

What is an ID tag?
	An ID Tag is a 128 byte structure at the end of an MP3 file. It contains artist and track information so your filenames 
don't need to be as long or complicated.
