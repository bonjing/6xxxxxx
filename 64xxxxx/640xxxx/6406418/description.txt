PLOT:
We meet confident, studious John McGill just as he's about to start
secondary school, where he fully expects to continue his so-far
glittering academic career. But there are dark clouds on the horizon
His friendship with middle-class Julian shines a light on both his
poor background and the dysfunction of his home, where his father
is drunk, violent and ineffective, his mother is troubled and
repressed and his elder brother is always in trouble with the law
At school, there are one or two good teachers, but most are
uninterested and unhelpful in the face of the brutal and territorial
gang culture which has spread from local housing estates to the
schoolyard
