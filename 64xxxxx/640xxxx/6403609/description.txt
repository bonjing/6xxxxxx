BOOK INFO:

This fascinating book uses case studies to explore a number of high-profile and contemporary Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsocial problemsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that exist in British society, including:

Racism and institutional racism
Ethnic and religious community segregation
Social and institutional asylophobia
Islamophobia and the incitement of religious hatred
Homophobia, institutional homophobia and community safety
At the same time the book examines various legislative and strategic movements introduced to tackle these social problems, for example strategies to counter institutional prejudices (especially in policing), hate crime legislation, managed migration, community safety and community cohesion strategies. Throughout the book, McGhee contextualizes these strategies within the Government's wider project of attempting to revitalize British citizenship.
Intolerant Britain? is key reading for students on courses in sociology, social policy, politics, race and ethnicity studies, gender studies, media and cultural studies and criminology.
