BOOK INFO:

This book aims to contribute to current debates on republicanism by examining the relationship between republican theory and practice in a variety of contexts.

The claim that civic republicanism can better address contemporary political problems than either liberalism or communitarianism has recently achieved considerable prominence, and been much debated. 

This volume aims to confront normative theory with historical and comparative analysis in order to explore the claim that republican theory can address contemporary political problems in ways that are both valuable and significantly different in practice from liberalism. The authors offer contrasting perspectives on issues raised by the contemporary revival of republicanism and adopt a variety of methodological approaches to address the practical implications of republican thought within a coherent thematic framework.

The book will be of interest to researchers and students studying republicanism in politics.
