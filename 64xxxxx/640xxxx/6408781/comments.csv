,jrock84,2011-09-12T05:38Z,"@rjan88
I checked out the torrent you named.
1. Missing 95%? That's a little steep.
2. I said in the description that it's just a fix of an existing torrent.
3. This isn't .rar. You can choose the files you wanna download and you dont have to extract them at the end.
4. Lots of people said that torrent contains lots of empty folders and corrupt files. Someone even said that it has .rar's inside the main .rar. What a hassle.
Anyways, download this and you'll see it is exactly what it says it is, in the description. I spent some valuable time making sure of that."

Faces of Death is the first disc in the list, and it is there. I just verified that."

,Skinnypupt,2011-11-27T05:56Z,works fine for me. 
,tommy1987,2012-03-12T06:07Z,"jrock84- Thanks dude, this is great."
,AN0N_YM0US,2012-03-13T11:14Z,Nice. Appreciate the upload. I may upload the complete discography as well but the difference will be mine will all be 320KBPS. I just get my albums directly off iTunes then convert it to mp3 format.
,AN0N_YM0US,2012-03-13T11:16Z,"Also there are a couple albums that are missing. Basically same songs though, you know how they like to release a new album like Greatest Hits with old songs. It's called, For Smokers Only released in 2011."
