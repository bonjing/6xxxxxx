I've read so many comments online remarking, either in surprise or in disgust, at how the new Echochrome II soundtrack was recorded and released as one 75 minute long track, when the soundtrack to the first Echochrome game was split neatly into 13 tracks. I was pretty annoyed too, so I decided to cut it into individual tracks, each track representing an individual movement. 

The aim was to ensure each track sounded like a truly unique song, and I think I've achieved that. Really, I did this since there are some movements I like more than others, and I really wanted to be able to shuffle this album. 

I also created a lossless audio counterpart to this; if there's enough demand, I might seed them as well, but right now I will just seed the MP3's. 


Tools used: Audacity (digital audio editor); Mp3tag (audio file tag editor).
