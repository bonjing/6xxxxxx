
WIGAN PIER 50

CD1: DJ BEN 'T'

CD2: BONUS CD "DJ BEN 'T' LIVE & DIRECT WITH MC's TREBLE & REBEL"



I WAS ACTUALY DOING A 3 YEAR PRISON SENTANCE WHEN I CAME ACCROSS THIS CD. IT COST ME A 12.5G PACKET OF GOLDEN VIRGINIA AND A BOX OF SAFETY MATCHES PMSL !!!

THIS CD / ALBUM IS QUIET OLD NOW BUT IT'S "THE BEST" OR "ONE OF THE BEST" ALBUMS WIGAN PIER HAVE EVER MADE 

((I THINK SO ANYWAY :-) ))



ENJOY & SEED !!!
