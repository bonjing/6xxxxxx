Whatâ€™s new in BBEdit 9?

* Projects â€“ A Project is a vastly improved modern expression of
   BBEditâ€™s â€œFile Groupâ€ feature. Project windows include an editing 
   view: Click on a file in the Project list, and it immediately appears in the
   editing window. Projects may contain documents, folders, and 
   Collections â€” custom groupings of documents that can be anywhere on
   any local or remote computer.

* Completion â€“ BBEdit will figure out completions for your code or 
   text as youâ€™re editing, either after a delay in typing, or with a keystroke
   (your choice). Completion can be turned on and off on a per-language 
   basis. They can be derived from a variety of sources, including (but not 
   limited to) Clippings, language-specific completions, and even the 
   system dictionary. When working in HTML/XHTML and CSS 
   , completion suggests appropriate tag and attribute names, as
   well as providing easy completion of common CSS properties.

* Edit in Results Windows and Disk Browsers â€“ The text views in 
   browsing windows (disk browsers, search results, syntax-check 
   results, and similar) are now editable; rather than having to open a file
   into a new window from such a browser, you can just edit it right there
   in the windowâ€™s lower pane.

* Enhanced HTML/CSS support â€“ HTML5 syntax checking is built
    in, as well as syntax coloring improvements for other languages 
    embedded in  and  tags.

* Modeless Find/Replace Windows â€“ Multi-file search now has a 
    powerful window of its very own, and both the single- and multi-file
    search windows are modeless, meaning you can work in â€” and copy
    from â€” open text documents without having to close the search 
    window. The search windowsâ€™ interfaces have been greatly simplified, 
    without sacrificing any functionality. Also, BBEdit now preserves your 
    search-and-replace history even after you quit, and will remember it at 
    next launch.

* Character-level Find Differences â€“ Find Differences now uses the 
    system â€œdiffâ€ tool for generating the difference ranges displayed in the 
    application. The interface has also been improved, allowing you to see
    more granular differences, not just differences by line. Sub-line 
    differences are visible by twisting the triangle twiddle for each line
    difference result.

* Scratchpad â€“ The Scratchpadâ€™s purpose is to be a space where you can
    manipulate text by performing quick transforms, manual edits, or 
    batches of copy/paste. It is ideal for quickly beating text from one 
    source into submission before pasting it elsewhere. The Scratchpad  
    window automatically saves its content and state, eliminating those
    pesky â€œSave Untitled 237?â€ warnings when closing a window or 
    quitting BBEdit.

* Save/Copy as Styled Text â€“ Save as Styled Text saves your code as 
    an RTF file, with the same indentations and text coloring as you see in 
    your editor window. (The Copy variant copies the styled text to the 
    clipboard.) These features allow you to represent your documents easily
    in other applications, or even show them to other humans. Or mammals. 
    Or even invertebrates, I guess.

* Search Xcode Projects â€“ An entry in the Find windowâ€™s Source List 
   is now populated by Xcodeâ€™s Recent Projects menu. Selecting one or
   more Xcode projects will instruct the multi-file search to search each 
   text file in the selected Xcode project(s).

* Fix/ToDo Tracking â€“ Track your coding tasks easily: Ruby, C, Obj-C,
    C++, and header files will now show commented FIXME and TODO
    items in the function popup.
 
* Improved Autosave â€“ The application automatically saves its state 
   (open documents and windows) once per minute, so if something bad
    happens to your machine, thereâ€™s a pretty good chance that the next 
    time you start up, things will be as they were when the event occurred.

* Tab-key functionality â€“ The tab key can now be set to perform certain 
    actions (in addition to its existing important-but-mundane function of 
    indentation), including â€œgo to next placholder,â€ and â€œindent text 
    blocks.â€

* Preview in MS Windows browsers â€“ We now recognize application
    stubs created by VMWare Fusionâ€™s â€œUnityâ€ feature (available in 
    version 2.0 and later of VMware Fusion), so that you can preview
    HTML documents in Windows versions of Firefox, Opera, 
    Safari, and Internet Explorer while theyâ€™re running in a Windows
    virtual machine.

System Requirements:

* Mac OS X 10.5 or later (10.5.8, 10.6.7 or later recommended)
* Universal application (for both Intel and PowerPC-based Macs)
