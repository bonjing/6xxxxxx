,Joey3balls,2011-05-19T05:33Z,or download and take the 15 seconds to extract it
,roebuckguy,2011-05-19T05:36Z,"Why do people keep saying not to download because it is a RAR file? All you have to do is search for winRAR on this website, download the software, and and then you can download any RAR files and use them. "
,Chowi,2011-05-19T14:19Z,Works just fine. Just unrar the first file and you're good. Thanks for the up!
,Anonsen,2011-05-20T17:04Z,"a lot of times .rars are password protected. You have to go to a site to get the password and they ask you for personal information. It's a bug. With a file that is only 175 MiB, why bother raring it? "
