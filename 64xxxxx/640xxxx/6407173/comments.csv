TY VasiaZozulia!"
,cardu77,2011-05-23T15:59Z,"hey mmlatko, what he means is that only italian language pack is missing level 4 and 5.... because all others language pack with 5 levels are already released here..... such as english american, french, german, spanish and german....

so we must wait for someone that could upload italian level 4 and 5.... 

but even italian level 1,2 and 3 is enought for the most of people"

,HopelesslyAddicted,2011-07-06T05:59Z,"I'm also getting the 3221 error; the language levels need an update of Rosetta Stone.
I've tried doing this via the website (even though I know I shouldn't) and it ruined my RS, so I did a system restore. 
Everything's back to normal but I still have no idea what to do about this error without the dreaded thought of uninstalling and reinstalling (which I tried doing, that failed to uninstall properly anyway.)
Help will be appreciated. :)"
,cramsey,2011-07-06T20:55Z,I had the same 3221/update problem.  I downloaded and installed Rosetta Stone 3.4.7 and it is now working.

,ibr4him,2011-08-10T09:24Z,"firstly thanks, secondly would u upload audio companions for level 4 and 5?"
,QueenCeline,2011-08-10T13:08Z,"Well, I found how to mount them, but does anyone have the problem with only being able to do Lesson 1, and 2, and then are asked to activate the product? I had the same issue with Levels 1, 2, 3, but there was some way around it, but I am having the same problem with Levels 4, and 5, and I cannot figure out how to make it work. Any suggestions?"
