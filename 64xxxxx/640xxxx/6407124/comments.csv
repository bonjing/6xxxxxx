,ab2539,2011-09-05T06:08Z,What torrent client are you using?
,ngeta2k,2011-09-07T15:09Z,"""Invalid Torrent file"""
,ajax9527,2011-09-08T01:03Z,utorrent 2.2.1
,ajax9527,2011-09-08T01:05Z,I've also tried using bittorrent but that didn't work for me either.
,TwojaMatka,2011-10-25T21:09Z,"I'm using BitTorrent 7.2.1 and getting ""invalid torrent file"" too. Weak."
,Nerdmeister,2011-12-01T19:41Z,"I don't get an ""invalid torrent file"" error, I just need someone to start seeding the files."
,saucepan,2012-04-26T18:25Z,"Stuck at 79% for months, can anybody reseed this please? It may say 6 seeders in the description but trust me, there is none. Thanks a lot.

PS: uTorrent won't work for this torrent but Tixati will."
