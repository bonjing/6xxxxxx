,matt56037,2011-05-24T17:50Z,"I downloaded Home Premium (x86). OEM product key off computer's COA worked to activate; I thought OEM and RTM versions were different but I guess I was wrong? Either way, thanks for torrent. Nice clean untouched to get the bloatware off a new laptop. I'll seed Home Premium (x86) for a while."

,shhnedo,2012-04-12T23:54Z,This should have like over 9000 seeders. I personally used ultimate x86 from this torrent(just from another torrent tracker) and it's working without a hitch!
