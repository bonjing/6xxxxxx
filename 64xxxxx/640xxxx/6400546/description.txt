Definitely dead - Charlaine Harris-viny


This entry in Charlaine Harris\'s genre-blending Southern Vampire series -- an amalgam of mystery, dark fantasy, and paranormal romance -- is easily the most revealing and thematically pivotal volume to date. In the saga\'s sixth installment, Definitely Dead, telepathic Louisiana barmaid Sookie Stackhouse finds out jaw-dropping information about her first love, 130-something vampire Bill Compton, as well as equally astonishing insights into her own ancestry.



After her only cousin, Hadley, is murdered by one of the undead, Sookie travels to New Orleans to close out the young woman\'s apartment and collect her things. The unsavory job gets complicated quickly; Hadley was the \"honeybun\" of the bisexual vampire Queen of Louisiana, the seemingly ageless bloodsucker Sophie-Anne Leclerq. The queen has recently married another powerful sovereign in an attempt to forge a formidable alliance, and tensions in the supernatural community are running high. But when Sookie and her new love interest, a were-tiger named Quinn, are inexplicably kidnapped, the mind-reading waitress must unravel the mysterious circumstances of her cousin\'s murder before she ends up dead as well



Fans of comparable genre-fusing sagas (like Laurell K. Hamilton\'s Anita Blake sequence and Kim Harrison\'s Rachel Morgan adventures) who have not yet discovered Harris\'s Southern Vampire series (Dead as a Doornail, Dead to the World, et al.) will undoubtedly devour these novels starring the lovable waitress and amateur sleuth. Featuring innumerable vampires, shapeshifters, demons, and witches -- and lots of unadulterated eroticism! -- these fantasy-powered whodunits are to die for. Paul Goat Allen
