,steelllynx,2011-10-12T02:11Z,"You really don't want to put labels on discs, they are always off center and eventually ruin the drive."
,steelllynx,2011-10-12T05:18Z,"@Firewireo
You need to load the .dvd file with imgburn

Just install imgburn and then double-click the .dvd file."
,steelllynx,2011-10-12T06:36Z,1.91 isn't required.  I'm using 1.6 or 1.61 and it worked just fine.
