,a7x386,2011-06-16T14:52Z,"This is just my suggestion to those of you that want to play of Xbox Live or Dont want to mess up the game with a update.

Buy 2 xbox 360, they are so cheap these days you can do so. I have one flashed and the other isnt flashed. I use the Slim for xbox live. 

I bought my other xbox for $60 and flashed it for $20. Then you just buy the games you want to play online."

,Pro_Pirate_,2011-06-20T18:35Z,what dash version does this game require?? I am on 8955. 
,gijs111,2011-06-23T12:49Z,"Can anyone please confirm that the dash update will not force me to flash my xbox again?
I'm not taking any risk by applying the update until I am absolutely sure about this."
,aslan248,2011-06-23T13:53Z,Th dash update will prolly mean you have to flash your consol again.......plz seed seed seed seed
