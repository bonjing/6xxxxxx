BOOK INFO:

Protocols books specializing in measuring free radical and antioxidant biomarkers began to be published in 1998. Many of these methods are currently finding use in diagnostic medicine. Advanced Protocols for Oxidative Stress I covers the field of oxidative stress with state-of-the-art technology to utilize in research, contributed by an international panel of experts renowned for developing new procedures and methods. Included are sections on reactive oxygen and nitrogen species techniques, antioxidant technology and application, methods for analyzing gene expression, the exciting new area of oxidative stress and stem cell differentiation and specific biostatistical evaluation of biomarkers. This volume presents the current high-tech methodologies and provides a perspective on the diversity of applications in the ever-emerging field of free radical reactions and antioxidants. Due to the dynamic nature of this topic, this book will be the first of several volumes of Advanced Protocols in Oxidative Stress, all part of the highly successful Methods in Molecular Biologyâ„¢ series. As part of the series, the chapters include a brief introduction to the material, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible laboratory protocols, and tips on troubleshooting and ensuring replication of technology.

Cutting-edge and convenient, Advanced Protocols in Oxidative Stress I is an ideal desk reference for scientists wishing to further this research in this exciting, unique and vital field of study.
