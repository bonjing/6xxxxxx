It's not certain when Clarksdale-born Charles Thompson changed his name; he sometimes said that he did it in WW II to avoid the draft, but he was logged as Charles Thomas when he made unissued recordings for Sun in 1952.
In his teens, Davis learned guitar from JL Hooker, and performed in travelling minstrel shows, buck dancing and walking barefoot on broken glass. He spent the '50s oscillating between South and North, and worked with Hooker in Detroit for a while before settling in Chicago. Davis became a living landmark on Maxwell Street;
His '60s recordings didn't translate into wider performing opportunities, and when festival bookers finally woke up in the late'80s, his revived career was sadly abbreviated.
Like Hooker, his one-time neighbour and teacher, Davis played modal, one-chord blues, and even though he was a 'genius loci' of the famous Chicago flea market, his '60s solo recordings are essentially unmodified Delta Blues.
More than two decades on, Davis was still an energetic performer, whether alone or with intermittent assistance from harp and drums. His singing had become more extrovert and less brooding, and his acoustic guitar work, though always rhythmically secure, is something very turbulent.
This album is not at the level of Davis's earlier work, but its unpretentious enthusiasm is very winning.
