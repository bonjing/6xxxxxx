So if it's important for you to watch this cam with the audio synced up right, older versions of VLC media player will let you open as many video screens at the same time as you want (provided you have a decent video card and another monitor).. so you can see what I'm getting at.. turn the volume off of the movie you are gonna watch, and sync up the other movie a second off so it matches in the one you will listen to (not watch), minimize the one with the volume going and viola! Your movie is fixed, for this viewing only."
