BOOK INFO:

New, wicked humor from the author of the bestselling Bunny Suicides books 

On the heels of his runaway Bunny Suicides books, cartoonist Andy Riley turns his irreverent wit to another group of small creatures that lurk among us seemingly everywhere: children.

From the benign (every ant you meet must be named) to the truly cruel (Ronald McDonald is dead!), each hilarious cartoon has a tall tale to educate children and entertain wicked adults everywhere.
