,Shibou,2011-05-20T07:17Z,"Question about install???
So we download the Torrent, when we extract it there is a folder called CookedPC with 3 .dlc files in it.
Next do we open our Witcher 2 installation file and find CookedPC. Then move the 3 .dlc files from CookedPC from extract into the CookedPC folder in the installation folder? "
