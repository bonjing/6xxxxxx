BOOK INFO:

Omvedt (Nehru Memorial Museum) has written widely about the condition of dalits and women in India. As part of a larger project to identify and assemble the thought and writings of major intellectuals in India's anti-caste movement, she discusses the contributions of Buddhists in the past and present. In the course, she reveals much of the Buddhist history of India that even many Indians are not aware of. She writes for general English-speakers in India and elsewhere.
