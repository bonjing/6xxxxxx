I DL'd this file and got a notice that it was being monitored by some copyright infringement organization. I was reported to my ISP and they emailed me telling me to stop torrenting illegal copies. Got threatened to be taken off Comcast as my ISP. They also said that if it continued I could be reported to higher authorities. "
,mrBubblesboots,2011-12-27T00:44Z,"@dirtyMurd, thats why you dont pirate movies on a government computer that uses an internet connection the government pays for. derp"

Same has happened to me when i was a noob.
If you use an app such as tor you wont have this problem even if you are on a government owned ISP and secured government connection.
consider downloading tor browser."
