plot

Composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) is in a five-year relationship with actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), who stars in a CSI-like television show, Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime. One day, as Peter stands naked in their apartment (after dropping his towel from showering), Sarah announces that she is leaving him for someone else. Devastated, and unable to banish his grief through one-night stands, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii. The vacation, however, is ruined when he learns that Sarah and her new boyfriend, (lead singer of the English rock band, Infant Sorrow), Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) are also guests of the resort. Taking pity on him, hotel concierge Rachel (Mila Kunis) offers him an expensive suite for free in exchange for cleaning up the room himself.
