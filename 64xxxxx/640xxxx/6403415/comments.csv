The file in this torrent is a 7-zip archive. Open it with 7-zip on Windows. Inside the archive is an Adobe Air installer and a Flash file. Open the installer and it'll install Final Hours of Portal 2 like any other program."
,tehnores,2011-07-10T09:41Z,"Actually, scratch the last part. The .exe file won't install anything, it just runs the interactive ebook.

You will need the Adobe Air runtime installed though; it's in the support folder if you need it."

 I ignored that and nothing happened. Confirm is this safe or/and false alarm by antivirus?"
