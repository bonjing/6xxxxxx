This is ROM Manager 4.2.0.1.  The 3.X versions with their license keys will not work for a 4.X release.  This APK is of course the full release, but doesn't utilize an external key.  I'm not sure if you can update it since when I tried to, it said the package wasn't signed correctly.  I tried it twice and got the same message.  So, I'm not sure if this is a legit ROM or a cracked version.  Either way, it still works and is much better than the 3.X versions out there that you can't even update to a 4.X release without getting the freeware version.

NOTE:  I'll seed this for a few days on and off, but if someone is in the middle of a download, I won't stop seeding until they finish.  After that, I seriously hope someone started seeding.  If not, just post a comment on here and I'll help you out.
