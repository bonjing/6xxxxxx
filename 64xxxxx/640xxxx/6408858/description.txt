Kate Victoria "KT" Tunstall (born 23 June 1975)[1] is a Scottish singer-songwriter and guitarist. She broke into the public eye with a 2004 live solo performance of her song "Black Horse and the Cherry Tree" on Later... with Jools Holland. She has enjoyed commercial and critical success since, picking up three nominations before winning a BRIT Award, and a Grammy Award nomination.[2] She is also the recipient of an Ivor Novello Award.

She has released three studio albums internationally: Eye to the Telescope (2004), Drastic Fantastic (2007) and Tiger Suit (2010).

Weâ€™re very excited to announce that you can now get your mitts on brand new KT music!! The Scarlet Tulip EP is exclusively available to download now through KTâ€™s online store and also available to pre-order on CD or Vinyl, or, if you are seeing KT during her current North American solo tour, you can purchase a copy of the CD from the merch stand.

â€œThe Scarlet Tulip EP is a really special body of work for me.â€ says KT. â€œItâ€™s the first time since I was very young that Iâ€™ve set about recording just my voice with finger-picked guitar. 6 of the 7 songs came into being during the year I spent writing for â€˜Tiger Suitâ€™. (â€˜Hidden Heartâ€™ was a song written for Bruce Parryâ€™s â€˜Survivalâ€™ project, to try and gain land protection for indigenous people of the Amazon.) 
 
I felt a creative need to do something impulsive and autonomous, so this EP is partly to celebrate embarking on my first major solo tour, but also to get the songs out there into the ether as Iâ€™ve always felt there is something special about sending new songs off into the world as soon as they are done. Thereâ€™s something magical about it. 
 
It was recorded by my husband and drummer, Luke Bullen, in our solar-powered studio in the woods in the English countryside.â€
