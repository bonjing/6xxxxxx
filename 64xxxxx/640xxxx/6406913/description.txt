BBC Munro Mountain Man 810p HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2009

Little more than 100 years ago, Scottish mountains standing at more than 3,000 feet were virtually unknown. Today they are familiar terrain to many thousands of climbers, thanks to Victorian adventurer Hugh Munro's determination to list the high peaks which now define the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. This documentary, presented by Nicholas Crane, tells the story of the magnificent peaks that bear his name and the people who have been possessed by them.
