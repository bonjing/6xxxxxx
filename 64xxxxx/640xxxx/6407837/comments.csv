,A.Y.R.E.N,2011-08-24T23:07Z,"It works just fine!
Although, figuring out how to install and make it work was a bit confusing but I eventually got it to work.
I downloaded this to my old computer which was Windows 7 and everything worked well. No loading bugs, lags, it isn't slow and doesn't have any kinds of issues (no viruses either). By now I've completed the entire game (:
I recommend this download."

,gaming18,2011-12-06T16:53Z,"perfect 
download
extract any one file 
then install
and enjoy"
,fauxphony,2011-12-10T14:25Z,"Hello.  This is a weak a** tutorial however, it'll help.  

I downloaded this bug fix that i found in the comments section below (Thank you to Skamlik this is why comments are helpful):http://www.rockstarwatch.net/news/753/Bully-PC-Patch-1-200-released/

Then I Downloaded the file you've browsed.
I then used Winrar cause well, that's what i use.
Once the bully file was finished I:

-Went to the folder where the file was and opened it.

-Right clicked on the first rar (zipped/compressed) file and chose: EXTRACT HERE)

-The extraction happened in a matter of about three and a half minutes (my laptop is about two years old)

-After that I click on the .ISO (cd image) file that was extracted from the rar file i right clicked on.  

-I use daemon tools.  

-Using Daemon tools I just right -clicked the .ISO file and chose: Daemon tools pro > Mount to > and then chose the virtual drive i wanted.  In my case it's the F://

-I went to ""Computer"" and then double clicked on the f:// drive that said ""BULLY""

-I then clicked on the ""SETUP"" file

-I followed the basic setup guide lines and chose whatever basic options one chooses when they install programs like these.  

Now once the file was finished installing i did not open the read me file nor did i open the game.  I went to the folder where I downloaded the bug fix to and i opened up the bug fix and started that installation process.  

it got hung up on validating install for a bit so it kinda scared me a bit that it wasn't going to accept the file.  however, it did.  

I clicked 'finished' and ran the game. like a f*ckin BAWWWWWS!  

Thank you very much to the uploader.  I appreciate your time and effort.   "

,YmeNL,2012-01-31T16:47Z,Wich one must i unpack?
,hmg0207,2012-02-11T14:44Z,"A half decent game. Controls are a little daft, but they can be chanced.

The installation instructions by Fauxphony are spot on. I installed the patch immediately after main install.

The exact file you need to extract is ""pro-bullyse.rar"", the other, numbered files are parts of the one giant file.

Apart from the opening video, the game runs perfectly fine on average spec (what's average!?) Vista computer.

The ISO file is not needed to run the game, so you can delete that afterwards if you want. Don't get rid of the RARs though, they're needed to seed! ;)"
,necodevil,2012-02-17T17:23Z,Thank you very much!! nice upload
,bunny77,2012-02-19T14:34Z,"I Finished this game,2 times,it's very cool,and installing is simple:Extract Rar with Winrar...Mount with Demon Tools,Install where you want to,and play -_-"

,liamMCR,2012-04-26T21:18Z,"Hi I just downloaded this torrent and was wondering if it works on Mac computers because I extracted the zip file fine and it created a folder with 15 files including a folder called 'dx9'. I can't seem to find anything to run the game it's really frustrating!! I haven't played this game since 2006 when it came out i loved it! Agh, help please!"
,Skipp118,2012-05-18T13:43Z,so how do you actually launch the game after installation?

,TheMaksMW,2012-06-04T22:34Z,can sb give me a link to the packs 9 and 70? they're damaged and I don't want to download this torrent from the beginning.. thx
,ace18,2012-06-11T00:27Z,"Ok, when i run the setup as soon as i choose where the file is to download and hit install, it immediately says ""DirectX9 installation failed."" What do i do to fix this. It keeps me from installing the game so now i cant play?"
