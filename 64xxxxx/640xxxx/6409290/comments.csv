My mates son loves King-Fu Panda but as he is in a wheelchair he won't be able to play this game.

Why can't they add the use of normal contollers so everyone can play. They do on PS3 games. On PS3 you get the choice of playing this with move or Controller.

Sorry for ranting but I believe they should program for everyone.

Thanks consolasatope


I have tried it but not a fan of Kinnect so won't be playing this again. 

The guy (No name dropping on a Torrent site or he'll kill me LOL) that created the kinnect originally made it for the PS3 but Sony rejected it as it required more system than the PS3 has for it to work perfectly. 
So Due to the ideal system requirements being higher than the PS3 has to offer and the fact it is modified in under 2 weeks to make it to work on the 360 with even less system power, you are left with a system that either gives good graphics with poor control or good control with Wii quality graphics"
