,Arbans,2011-07-04T10:36Z,"Hello there EvolGamer, I am a great fan of your uploads. Can you please upload 'Johnny English' for iPods? No one has uploaded it in iPod format except a 1.3 GB copy, which obviously is too much.
Also, if you'll do it, can you respond if you'll do it or not, that way I know not to wait forever lol. Thanks so much
(sorry for copy pasting the same comment but you said to make requests on your most recent upload :) )"
