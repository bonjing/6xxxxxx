BOOK INFO:

Advanced Lighting Controls is edited by Craig DiLouie and written for engineers, architects, lighting designers, electrical contractors, distributors, and building owners and managers. Advanced lighting controls, indicated by research as the "next big thing," are now mandated by the ASHRAE/IES 91.1-1999 energy standard, the basis for all state energy codes in the U.S., and are becoming the norm rather than the exception in new construction. This book provides in-depth information about the major trends, technologies, codes, and design techniques shaping the use of today's lighting control systems, including dimming, automatic switching, and global as well as personal control.
