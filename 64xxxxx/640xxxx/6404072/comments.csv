,boss_aye,2011-05-21T09:38Z,why tha fuck is every1 uploading tha animation
,Bakura2,2011-05-21T10:24Z,"Because it was a new DVD release this week.
I have had hundreds of people download it, so it must be highly in demand.
Plus, I offer it in Spanish, too.

Why are you complaining, the movie version is available for download, but not from me.
I saw it and the quality is a camera recording in the theater.
If you want the DVD, wait until it's released in July.
And quit cursing, if you don't like it, go somewhere else.
Maybe when you grow up you will realize adults have choices in this world."

If you like the download (encode) of the file (not the movie/story) and my work please click on the ""+1"" next to quality and do comment on it ..

Please seed atleast 1:1 so other people could download as well..

Thank you "

You calling me a dumb fuck.... fuck you moron...
you're the one that can't look at the DVD cover above and see it's animated.
Besides... you should know the correct title for what you are looking for. Try Google or IMDB next time.
I have not deceived anyone in my description.... and YES some people like animation.

This is bullshit... a person tries to supply others with a free video and they bitch because they're freakin idiots and need their mommy to help them download.

....""duh I just saw it sad Thor and got excited and wet my pants thinking it's on DVD when it just came out in theaters""...

jonnoman8 , what are you 12 years old?

Anyone else reading this sick of idiots calling others dumb fucks on piratebay when they are the actual ignorant ones?
