                             The Complete Season 6
                            +EXTRAS from S01 to S05


Brilliant, but socially inept, forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperence Brennan works at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington DC. After consulting for him on a FBI case, she is approached by cocky yet charming ex-Army Ranger turned Special Agent, Seeley Booth to help the Bureau solve crimes by identifying human remains that are too far gone for standard FBI forensic investigations. Brennan's empirical, literal view of the world causes friction with Booths emotive, instinctive attitude creating a volatile relationship. However as their case load increases the symbiotic partnership produces results and with the support of Brennan's Squint Squad, more and more cases are closed successfully.

In Season 6 Bones and Booth are back to square one. When they are both called back to DC by Prosecutor Caroline Julian, Booth comes back with some news: that he has moved on and is in love now with the journalist Hannah Burley he got to know in the war zone he was assigned to. While Bones has to somehow adapt to this new situation, Angela and Hodgins are looking forward to having their Baby. Sweets and Daisy have their usual on and off game running and Dr. Saroyan struggles once more with being a parent to her teenage adopted daughter Michelle.

Fantastic show, which has been renewed for another season, but if you donâ€™t know season 1 to 5 yet, you should definitely get them â€“ itâ€™s worth the while!
