,jherrmann,2011-09-30T04:18Z,"OK, where do I start? Probably by saying ""don't download""!

I'm part way through the first episode and am looking to download another version of this series. The video is slightly jumpy and not particularly clear. Even worse, the first episodes starts with several minutes of advertisement for the poster's blog/site/whatever.

I haven't seen any other episodes and I don't want to."
,jherrmann,2011-09-30T23:44Z,"OK, had to post an addendum.

I had a look around and couldn't find a better version than this, other one really big one, so I tried the next few episodes.

The ones I've seen are fine. Decent quality, no ads, etc. What I'll do is download the first episode separately and use that in place of the first ep of this torrent."

[V],manOtor,2012-05-06T01:06Z,"Just to set it straight for anyone who reads through the comments:

All the comments about bad quality are referring to episode 1 (which admittedly is shitty - I didn't realize until it was too late).

If you have some brainz, like Mr. jherrmann obviously had (at last), you test at least one other episode, before you doom the whole torrent.
This torrent consists of the scene TV releases and the quality is good!

Here is a link for a better episode one:
