,Shauncold,2011-06-04T15:59Z,I haven't downloaded this game (which also means I haven't tried it on my JB'n PS3) but from my understanding and experience I can only play games that require 3.60 FW with a patch that you can download by looking it up on google. Games that I have got to work that are 3.60 FW are brink and L.A. Noire.
,alithegamer,2011-06-05T10:32Z,"thanx shauncold, can you pls upload the link to the patches it would be damn helpful to us,,,, thanx in advance"
,racedude62,2011-06-05T15:20Z,"for it to work on 3.55 jb etc. you have to change param.sfo from 3.60 to 3.55, this can be done on computer but in order to save all the hastle i recommend downloading multiman 1.15.02 as it will ask you if you would like to change the param.sfo before playing the game. you can download multiman anywhere just search it, i use multiman 1.15.02 i would only recommend that one as future versions don't work as well, just search it on google and download it. :D glad to help"

,geefung,2011-06-06T18:52Z,"I tried this with Gaia Manager ""change param.sfo from 3.60 to 3.55""
and I just get the black screen. Maybe I need multiman 1.15.02?  I
will try with this later. Any Patch .pkg file would be nice and less
hassle. But thanks a lot for game."

,Omis_oz,2011-06-10T05:05Z,"What sad mentalities some people have, to take the time to write up fanciful fictional solutions to run this game on a JB/CFW machine. 

When at this point in time, no patch technique for Dirt 3 on the PS3 exists."
