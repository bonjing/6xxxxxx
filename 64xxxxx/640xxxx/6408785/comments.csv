Nice clean & crisp video .
And the audio is great, AC-3 sounds a lot better thru my home cinema set then AAC.

,DogDead,2011-05-20T20:13Z,"Can You Tell us if it is Cinavia protected please mate?

Either way thanks for the upload"
[V],RajMahal,2011-05-20T21:21Z,"@ DogDead...
I have no idea what Cinavia is..I will probably look it up today and know something abt it as a lot of ppl who are downloading my torrents are going to use their ps3.
BTW i don't have a ps3..so have to check if there is a way to do it without the need of a ps3.."
,DogDead,2011-05-20T21:53Z,"@ RajMahal  Cinavia is an anti-piracy-pain in the arse that Sony has installed in PS3s via updates. Most Sony pictures movies have it and it stops playback of pirated Cinavia protected movies. I'm half way through this movie and so far so good.

Excellent Quality upload by the way mate   +1"
,DogDead,2011-05-20T22:46Z,No Cinavia! :)
,Vavires,2011-05-21T08:14Z,"The thing about the ps3 is. Many ppl as like me use it as a media console, i have 2 ps3's one for playing one for the purpose of media. I watch blu ray, dvd and downlaods there, the picture is better then a dvd player or the xbox cause of its smoothing and upscaling. So we thank you for your uploads without cinavia :) (wich made me angry yesterday afte r5 versions of battle for LA...)"
,joej191,2011-05-21T09:52Z,"+1 For no Cinavia

,away112,2011-05-21T22:58Z,"I dont have audio when people talking. Background sound is working, but if people talking then there is no audio, I have all codecs installed. I tried bs player and vlc player, all same.
Could someone knwos whats the problem?"
[V],RajMahal,2011-05-22T11:37Z,"@ away112 
Are the other movies working fine ?
If yes..then pls change the vlc audio settings to reverse stereo.
If no then make sure the default device is stereo not mono."
,DogDead,2011-05-22T11:57Z,@joej191 I use MKV2Vob mate
,spikemeat,2011-05-24T13:37Z,"@away112: Do you have a 5.1 setup? The audio on this release is mixed up. I have the center channel with dialog coming out of the rear right speaker and the surround music coming from the front left speaker. I'm on 7.1 home theater setup.

Getthe one from vision instead."
