V - 8 (Very nice given the size of the file.

M - 7 (Nice flick)"

It says t=something that they don't say at all, but it sounds related!
I was thinking maybe this versionR5, doesn't have some scenes in comparison to other versions!!?"
,kittleboy,2011-06-06T12:37Z,"The subtitle is 149 seconds leading ( use KMPlayer and the button with this symbol "" ] ""to adjust the subtitle.
I would suggest another subtitle:
http://subscene.com/english/Limitless/subtitle-439633.aspx
It's the same in leading, but apparently with more details."
