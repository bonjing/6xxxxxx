,illiria,2011-05-18T10:33Z,"@ majuaraan

Can't you read? Too hard? Then go to school. I DO NOT assume shit, YOU DO. I KNOW there are no viruses, but it doesn't change a shit if my anti-virus deletes crack anyway, does it? And adding dosens of cracks to ""exceptions"" list ain't too comfortable too, you know? Especially if you have to do that every time you reinstall Windows.

If SKIDROW just had their hands growing out of their shoulders instead of their arse, things would be so much simpler. Other teams can crack properly. SKIDROW can't. Then they shouldn't do it - simple.


@ xtremezone

Well, really now, why adding cracks to ""exceptions"" list so hard? Maybe because you have to add dozens of cracks (by their location on a hard drive) each time you reinstall Windows? Understand why ""so hard""?"
,MN121MN,2011-05-18T10:39Z,"Just one question : How come it's slow? I've downloaded a movie with 200 kb/s average, every time I download a game it's about 5-10 kb/s average"

,waraewra,2011-05-18T10:58Z,"How does this work for anyone?

Here's what I do:
1. Mount ISO with Daemon
2. Install, Use 1111-... serial.
3. Click Setup.exe in UPDATE
4. Copy & Paste paul.dll from SKIDROW into ""Microsoft Games/Fable III"" folder
5. Receive Error about CD being wrong (When ISO is mounted) or No Disc Inserted (When ISO isn't mounted) when I click on Launcher, and F3Secu. (It tells me to open Launcher when I just use Fable3.exe) 

Is it required to have a Games for Windows offline account up and running BEFORE opening the game? Or is there no working crack at the moment and the previous comments are bullshit.

Any help is GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!"

I have never seen anyone as dumb as you two are. Are you an idiot? I KNOW it's false positive, but with my anti-virus adding files to exceptions is very problematic. they should make cracks that will not be detected as false positives - or let some other team (RELOADED, for example) do that.

,Sarguun,2011-05-18T13:24Z,"Step One: Turn internet connection off
Step Two: Install the game with the 11111 serial, make sure it's a quick install
Step Three: Get the crack, run setup.exe.  DO NOT TRY TO VALIDATE SERIAL OR START GAME
Step Four: Copy paul.dll to C:\...Fable III
Step Five: Run from F3Secu - THE ONE WITH AN ICON, not ""F3Secu.exe""

Once Games for Windows pops up, if you sign it it will be 'Offline' and you won't have to validate the serial, just press the X at the middle-top-right section of the screen.  Games works for me, hopefully this helps someone else."

IMPORTANT: if you partitioned your drive to have your OS on a single partition, then if the file was a virus, it would try to migrate to the C:\ Drive and Norton would stop it.

,DarthUnderverse,2011-05-18T17:51Z,"Here's a step by step for those of you who've been having problems. I had them as well and this worked for me.

Make sure you have Games for Windows installed first. After you mount the image, open it and go to the G4W folder. Use the exe to install g4w.

Next back up  and open the DIRECTX folder and run DXSETUP.exe to update directx.

Now install the game. all 1's or x's both works. I used all x's.

Don't open the game after install

On the iso again, Run the exe in the UPDATE folder, then copy paul.dll from the SKIDROW folder over to your game folder. Replace the file when it asks you what to do.

When you run the game, select create new profile, then on the next page SCROLL DOWN and select create offline profile.

Enjoy your game.

If you still have problems I suggest either a new pc or suicide."

Use uTorrent and set bandwith settings to high? If you already have it, see below 

@Havick007

Have you tried going to setup guide and selecting run tests? worked for me once... or you can try setting your upload speed (on the setup guide) to 100mbit/s and that will allow you to have the maximum possible connections. Also see the bottom of this torrent descritption for more ways of increasing the dl speed"

I used Deamon tools Lite for the install.
Update the setup.exe on dvd Update folder.
Open crack folder   aka Skidrow on dvd. Take Paul.dll to where you installed the game. A Local ""offline"" windows live profile is good to have before start. Start game with the FableLauncher.exe "
,robisok,2011-05-18T22:49Z,"For anyone having a problem installing this i can assure it does work 100%, i have been playing it all day!! In simple English, follow the skidrow installation instructions, then if you have not done so(in the installation procedure) installed windows live(which is the small gfwlivesetup.exe in the G4W folder on your mounted fable 3 iso) then do so... ""THE GAME WILL NOT LOAD WITHOUT DOING SO"", then create an offline account by doing this.. When you start the game press the home key on the keyboard and GFWL will pop up , scroll down the white page that popped up and you'll find a selectable sentence [ create a local profile ] in blue click it and you'll find out the rest.. i am running windows 64bit and it works like a charm, just remember to install  ""GFWL""!!!"

Go to AVG->Tools->advanced->Resident Shield.

Make a Directory Exclusion for your Fable folder, and specifically exclude paul.dll in the option underneath that. 

D/C from the net, and play. Just click through the GfW stuff.

,DarthUnderverse,2011-05-19T02:24Z,"In my post earlier I gave a step by step, and I encountered all the problems I'm reading about. (Other than the avg, drop avg and go avast ppl...) Anyway, before you do ANYTHING uninstall gfw as well as fable3 if its still installed. Make sure you manually delete anything at all to do with Fable 3 that may be left behind. In other words make sure there is no Fable 3 folder at all.

Restart your pc.

Now, install g4w FIRST. Update it. Then, if you don't have it already, install microsoft silverlight. It works hand in hand with g4w, and may contain the missing 5--- file. Not sure, but I did get that error before I did this, and not afterward.

Now update your directx from the iso.

Now install the game, but don't try running it afterward. Now follow the usual steps, update and move the cracked content.

Use fablelauncher.exe to play game. The other exe's won't work.

Make sure you've uninstalled everything COMPLETELY and restarted before you do ANYTHING.

I'm using win7 ult on an ancient machine and the game plays just fine after doing all these steps. Just make sure you don't have any left over files floating around in the install directories you choose. 

(If you tried manually inserting the missing files you got from the original error, they will NOT be removed with the uninstall feature.)

If all this doesn't work for you, all I can suggest is go smoke a blunt and start experimenting. You should know your machine better than anyone else anyway."

1. Mount or burn image
2. Install using serial: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
3. Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game
4. Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation
5.Open upp your anti virus program and make it accept the ""paul.dll"" file (becouse if the anti virus blocks that dll you wont be able to start the game
6.OMG PLAY THE GAME!"

If you try access the advanced settings it will tell you that because of securom everything will be set to minimum quality and certain functions will be disabled.


This release works great besides the securom restriction. It launches and installs just fine. I played until the first zone as a test and it all works fine. The game is a bit heavy on the system but my old trusty Pentium D did not betray me! 

There is a securom issue definetely involved though. Perhaps it will be resolved in a soon to come kr@kfix who knows, it limits visuals but they are still enjoyable even at minimum.


The game is definetely worth it, I've bought it already and I haven't regretted it. It's truly worth it and it will show Lionhead that the PC is something they should count on.

tl;dr great game,a securom issue limiting graphics and some unspecified features."

You cant copy the paul.dll file becouse your anti virus program does not permit it . so what i did to fix it was to open upp my anti virus program and placed the (cd) in exeptions . that way the anti virus program allows everything that was on the cd . and WALLA . you can copy the Paul.dll now . good luck!"

@steveleven
Just cancel the official windows activation thing you get after installing the update. You need to (re)copy the paul.dll crack to the installed folder.  
If you copy the crack and then update, the update replaces the crack again with the original, so you need to put the crack back again. 
The reason it doesn't work without updating is that the crack is for the updated version."

,Sick_Jargon,2011-05-20T20:59Z,"Follow:

1) Once you've extracted the iso, MOUNT it. I use daemon tools.

(this will stop the disk insert errors)

2) Explore the disk through My Computer - Go to the G4W folder and install 'gfwlivesetup'.

(this will stop the xlive.dll error)

3) Install the game with the serial key:
11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
Then enter the UPDATE folder and run 'setup'.

4) Enter the SKIDROW folder and copy the paul.dll file across to your Fable III installation folder (in program files/microsoft games)

5) Now use the LAUNCHER to start the game.

6) Windows Live will pop up, go to create a new account, now SCROLL DOWN. You will see a link that allows you to create a local account. Click this and then provide your player name.

Should solve most the problems. If your anti-virus is being a pain, you might just have to uninstall and reinstall when your finished."

It goes into C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Lionhead Studios\Fable 3\Saved Games\(there should be another folder here)

So i had the same problem with the ""Please insert cd-rom"" jibber jabber.  What i did was:
1) do everything that the instructions tell you
2) before you copy the paul.dd, you have to put it under the exceptions list in your anti-virus
3) transfer it to the to game folder
4) THEN you go back to your anti-virus, go to exceptions, and put the new paul.dd that is in the game folder on there.  so you will have 2 paul.dd's in the exceptions... the skidrow one and the game folder one.
5) enjoy :)"

I've got good news and bad news mate.

The bad news is (act surprised) the glitch didn't fix even after a clean install, a new save and updated drivers.

the good news is I saw a tiny performance increase with the newer drivers but that's all.

We may have luck making walter run by running in front of him and trying to affect his path somehow. It seems like a pathing issue.

I wouldn't count on a patch or anything since there don't seem to be any other people facing this crap.

3: Install setup.exe from the UPDATE folder.
4: Cancel the Windows Live activation you get after the update install.
5: IMPORTANT: add paul.dll or the install folder to the expection list in ALL your virus scanners and Anti Malware programs. (both the dll and the folder works best.) Do the same for the paul.dll in the mounted or extracted DVD's SKIDROW folder.
6: Copy Paul.dll from the SKIDROW folder to the game's install folder. overwrite when asked. If you still get a ""authorisation"" error, log in as administrator.
7: Start Fable 3.
8: When prompted for a G4WL account, click through untill you get to make a profile. Scroll down and select ""Create Local Profile"".


If the game:

Shows an hourglass for 3 seconds, and then again 3 seconds but doesnt launch:

1: Uninstall everything to do with games for windows live

I switched to Comodo, and sure it calls it a virus to, but I have the option to flag it as safe to so it never bothers me again.

So the first problem I encountered was the xlive.dll crash. I fixed it simply by copying the xlive.dll from system32 and creating a copy of that into my Fable 3 main folder. That successfully stopped the crash, but instead I now have a different problem. When I start the game from the Launcher, it goes to a BLACK SCREEN and I can move my yellow fable 3 cursor around but otherwise thats it. I sat watching the screen for over 20 min hoping it was going to work but it never got past the black screen and the cursor. If anyone has any information on how to fix it, post back. PLEASE "

This is what i did.

Mountet game in PowerISO.
Install using serial random key.
Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game
Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation
( if u have some problems replacing dll file u have to turn of ur antyvirus and firewall protection, and exlude it from Auto-Protect and sonar.  In Norton AV go Setting -> Iteam to exlude from Auto Protecion and Sonar Konfiguration and add the paul.dll file )

And now comes the hard part.
When i pressed Luncher or Fable SEC game didnd start so i instaled ""Microsoft for Windows Marketplace "" than i lunched game from F3Secu and in game created an offline account.
MGFW will start up automaticly when u run the game --> Creat New Profile --> Continue ---> Scroll down and somewhere in the text u will find ""Creat Local Profile "" and DONE !

GOOD LUCK HAVE FUN .

well i mount fable iso to virtual cd or poweriso and setup is in english maybe is something with your windows system this depend which language you use in windows or you installed, sometimes programs start in language in which country you live, but mostly is language you use in time when you install new programs, lets say about me i had installed two lang my native and english and in time when i use my native language if i try to install new program the program will be installed in my lang if i use in that time english language, program will be installed in english version of course if  program ask in which lang version you want it then  this problem not exist."

I can't say they're all false, but extremezone is a well-known and trusted uploader, just follow his notes and you'll be fine

@joroth: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-delete-a-system-file-in-windows-vista/
I hope this helps you take control of that pesky file.

pkm09:  the file should be in the SKIDROW folder of the .iso file...  in order to read iso's you need something like Alcohol120% or PowerISO to 'emulate' a pretend DVD drive.  From there you can manipulate the files as though you were browsing an actual dvd, if the files are still not where they're supposed to be, redownload the torrent"

""Follow:

1) Once you've extracted the iso, MOUNT it. I use daemon tools.

(this will stop the disk insert errors)

2) Explore the disk through My Computer - Go to the G4W folder and install 'gfwlivesetup'.

3) Install the game with the serial key:
11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
Then enter the UPDATE folder and run 'setup'.

4) Enter the SKIDROW folder and copy the paul.dll file across to your Fable III installation folder (in program files/microsoft games)

5) Now use the LAUNCHER to start the game.

6) Windows Live will pop up, go to create a new account, now SCROLL DOWN. You will see a link that allows you to create a local account. Click this and then provide your player name.

Should solve most the problems. If your anti-virus is being a pain, you might just have to uninstall and reinstall when your finished. ""

p.s. i used quick install and if a problem appears saying u have to enter an activation code that simply means u havent placed paul.dll ( the only file in the skidrow folder ) in the game directory yet hoped this helped

1. Make sure to disable any sort of antivirus software, et cetera, as most of them will flag some of the files required for this rip to work.

2. Run the Fable III setup and enter 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 as the serial... wait for installation to finish, then click cancel when the window pops up for online activation. 

3. Run the executable file named 'setup' within the 'UPDATE' folder, located in the DVD(.iso) files... 

4. Copy the DLL file named 'paul' from the 'SKIDROW' folder, located in the DVD(.iso) files as well... (This is the file that your antivirus would usually have wiped from your computer as it is moved anywhere else besides the DVD directory) to the Fable III installation directory...

5. Run Fable III from the from the FableLauncher.exe located in the Fable III installation directory. (Do not use xlive.dll, as the game will just choose to not launch whatsoever, so make sure it is not in the Fable III install folder)

6. When prompted for a Windows Live Profile, select create new profile, a new box will appear with a scroll-bar on the right-hand side, scroll down through the texture until you locate in blue text, 'create local profile', choose a name for said local profile, submit... ENJOY THE GAME."

I couldn't see an option to turn off the anti-spyware, anti-virus or the entire thing altogether so i added the paul.dll as an exception in its firewall, which still didnt work. turns out it was a section of AVG called Resident Shield where i needed to make the exception to the .dll file both as i copied it FROM the skidrow folder and TO the install dir.

Hey, you gotta turn off your Nod32 or any antivirus you have, Paul.dll is a false positive and considered as virus by many anti virus softwares.

,ShadowLea,2011-05-28T00:00Z,"@AKERSEKOMIS
Dont blame Skidrow. Blame the companies. The protection is hidden in the .dll in newer games as opposed to the .exe. So they have to crack the .dll, as cracking the .exe wont do a thing. 

An added 'bonus' is that all virusscanner automatically see altered .dll's as virusses. It wont fool those of us who have been in this scene for a long time, but an awful lot of people believe the false positive.

What you need to do (realize not all virus programs will let you make exceptions for folders instead of files, and with paul.dll you can't add it to exceptions as the virus program goes 'NUH UH') is turn off your antivirus. THEN boot Fable III via the launcher then once the game starts, turn the antivirus back on, simple as that. Quit being ungrateful fucking wankers, if you want to bitch about slow speeds and 'THERE VIRUS IN THIS' (which there isn't as so many fucking people have now told you, its a false fucking positive and the only way to play heavily protected games like Fable III) then GO BUY THE FUCKING GAME since you have the fucking IQ of a SNAIL.

,Finitless,2011-05-28T07:57Z,"Alright here's how I solved the problem of the paul.dll being marked as a virus.

Okay first of all, if your allowed to have the paul.dll file without your antivirus deleting, like i was, then your good to go. If you can't even have the paul.dll then your gonna have to find a way around your antivirus.

So I was allowed to have the paul.dll, but not right click it, or use it in any way or else it would delete and the window would freeze, so what I did was take the folder containing the file, which should be ""SKIDROW"", and move it to the Fable III instal folder, which should be Microsoft Games. Once it's in that folder, rename the folder contain the paul.dll to ""Fable III"" so it will mix the files of the folders together. Make sure you delete the paul.dll from the installation folder (""Fable III"") first, or it MAY cause problems, I'm not sure, but that's what I did, and the game works fine.
This guide is only for the people having problems due to the ""paul.dll"" being a false positive."
,Baitloads,2011-05-28T08:29Z,"Alright so I've been able to proceed through all of the steps, however, after I install Fable 3 and all the components, I click setup.exe and afterward move paul.dll to the Fable 3 installation folder. 

At this point I have G4WL installed as well as DirectX and MSVCRT. When I go to doubleclick the fablelauncher.exe, instead of the game opening up, it gives me the pop-up that you receive after setup.exe (It asks for an online activation code.) 

My internet connection is offline and I have no antivirus running.

I've looked at every single comment on this and I've researched youtube videos as well and this is the only part I'm lost at. 
I KNOW people have this similar problem because I've seen them posting and so far no one has an answer.

enter 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 as the serial

2.When its done go to the UPDATE map on the disk and once again press setup

3. Open AVG Interface then Tools>Advanced settings then temporarily disable avg protection.

press the box and then apply then pick 15 minutes

4. Copy all the files in the skidrow map to game dictionary (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Fable III)

5. Go back to avg interface pick resident shield

Then manage extensions then add path and game directory

,Bills642,2011-05-28T11:19Z,I did everything correctly but when i run the game n sign into my games live account it asks for another cd key n when i put in 11111-11111 ect. it doesnt work please help!!!!
,trondemor,2011-05-28T11:30Z,anyone who has fixed the graphics detail problem? It says my game is not clearing securom check and hence must run on the lowest detail settings.. 
,trondemor,2011-05-28T11:31Z,Bills642 : You got to create a local account not an online one. You do so by creating a new account and somewhere in the text it says create a local account or something. 
,Dave_247,2011-05-28T11:48Z,When you start the game and you sign into GFWL and then it asks to activate just press Escape and you will then be signed in offline and the game will continue.
,foniks12,2011-05-28T11:57Z,"1. Download Fable3
2. Mount or burn image
3. Install using serial: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
4. Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game
5. Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation
6. Open fable 3 Click create a new account. When How to create an account comes Scroll down to Create a local profile"
,Baitloads,2011-05-28T17:07Z,"This is pretty ridiculous that no one has an answer to this problem. I've seen the comments and I know people are having the similar. It just doesn't make any sense, I do everything and right when I have to start the game up, BEFORE THE WINDOWS LIVE OFFLINE ACCOUNT, the same screen pops up asking for an online activation key. It's the same thing that comes up when you finish installing setup.exe...."
,Thiemok,2011-05-28T17:50Z,"Dude when I click Fable3Launcher, it does nothing!!!!
I aint getting to any screen, just nothing!!!

WHAT TO DO?!"
,Thingelstad90,2011-05-28T18:54Z,"@Baitloads:

Yup, I've got the same problem as you. Get a screen telling me to activate the product, before I can start it. It has nothing to do with Windows live, and you can't even start the game without activating. You also need a separate activation key, which isn't the 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 code..."
,gus000,2011-05-28T19:44Z,"OKAY I WAS HAVING ISSUES, BUT NOW FIXED:
INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Download Game For Windows Live (dont start it)
2) Download torrent
3) Make a folder on desktop
4) Extract it to there
5) Run the setup for fable 3
6) Once done installing, copy paul.dll to program files
7) Now run the setup in the UPDATE folder.
8) Once your done that do not click to activate or anything.
9) Run the game, and when asked to make an account for windows live scroll down
10) Look for (Create Local Profile)
11) Once you make a local profile, the game should work.
---
Do not use an existing Live profile, make a new one. Use local only. "
,Baitloads,2011-05-28T20:59Z,Basically we have the problem that is between 8 and 9 with the steps above. We can't actually get to the fable screen because of this pop-up.

,Finitless,2011-05-28T22:07Z,"FOR ANYONE GETTING AN ACTIVATION KEY PROBLEM

The 11111 code DOES work, it's a beta code allowing the game to be installed, but not used. After it is installed, you must move the crack ""paul.dll"" to the installation folder ""Microsoft Games"" -> ""Fable III"". If you are having problems with the paul.dll being a false positive (marked as a virus when it's not) then read my previous comment which MAY solve that problem."

,circusanimals,2011-05-28T22:57Z,"FOR ANYONE WITH ""WRONG DISC"" PROBLEM:


Microsoft has a built in antimalware program you're going to need to turn off because it keeps blocking 'paul.dll' without giving you any notice or warning. 

In XP it's called MsMpEng.exe 
- Go to Start, Run, and enter services.msc  
- find the Microsoft Antimalware Service  
- Stop the process (and change the startup to disabled if you want).

In Vista it's Windows Defender 
- open Windows Defender and click on Options 
- go to admin options and uncheck the Use Windows Defender box and save

this cleared everything up for me (i'm running XP). hope this helps."

,dark_illusions,2011-05-29T00:30Z,apparentally the lag in this game is part of the game torrent or real bought in the store verson i was lookn up info on it and ppl sayn it lags hardcore on the xbox even at points its not just the computer verson so apparentally the ppl that made this did a half ass job on debugging it or something in the programming ive noticed alota games lately that come out the testing and onto shelves that have been real buggy and laggy for the bought copy in stores im wondering if the game makers are slacking and just throwing anything out now days

Q:My antivirus shows the paul.dll as a virus so i can move the file to the fable 3 directory

A:This isn't true,the paul.dll isn't a virus so you can either put it as an exception or turn off your antivirus when you will copy the file.

Q:when i open the SKIDROW folder i find it empty.What should I do?

A:Your antivirus thought Paul.dll is a virus,so turn off your antivirus and open the .iso image again.

Q:When i double-click the icon the game crashes.

A:try to install the Games for windows live version 3.0.89.0 instead the one that comes with the download.

Q:when i open the game it asks for an online activation code:you gotta install the Thingy in the MSVCRT folder that is in the CD.

What I'm having problems with is just step 5! Ya, holy shit I know... Anyway, I've done everything under the sun in an attempt to just get the FUCKING FILE COPIED!

Paul.dll will not, no matter what I do, release permissions on my PC. I'll always get the error ""You need permission from everyone to make changes to this file"". 

I started with disabling the whole fucking security permissions, did not work :/ Removed every single virus protection, administration is pretty much disabled (went overboard).

I've tried the ""take ownership"" approach both with the registery hack and various forms of user exceptions.

It's crazy, most often than not I can just select run as administrator and It'll be fine, or allow exceptions just by prompt alone.

Can anyone help me? I've tried and tried with this, honestly. Good job to the person who made the crack, I've never been forced to take such measures to crack a game. Still I'm more interested in this problem than playing the game :D"

1. Download this torrent
2. Mount the image using daemon/alcohol/clonedrive
3. Install the game, use the serial  11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
4. Don't run the game or anything always press cancel
5. Go to the mounted cd (explore/open) go to the UPDATE folder, and run setup.exe in that folder.
6. Go to the SKIDROW folder
7. Now it might get tricky, create an exception on your antivirus for the paul.dll file, or turn the AV off
8. Copy paul.dll to your game folder (probably program files/microsoft games/fable 3
9. Run the game from the shortcut, it will ask you to create an account, select create, and then scroll down till you find the create local acount link, create one, go ahead and play.
10. If the game crashes when you run it, even at step 9, try going to the shortut properties, then compatibility, select run as admin and disable visual themes.
11. Still doesn't work? Wait for future patches or fixes, the game is really bugged, and you won't get it to work on some pc's. I myself can only run it in my laptop."

After you have the crack copied into the game directory , you need to go back into Microsoft Security Essentials and Exclude the paul.dll thats in the the game folder.

This is what i did

Mounted the image

installed the game using the 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 serial

waited the installation to be finished.

Go to Mounted image --> Skidrow --> copied paul.dll and pasted it on the fable 3 folder.

then i faced an error regarding about the xlive.dll so i went to the control panel --> uninstall a program --> uninstalled the Microsoft Windows Live

Then I downloaded this one --->  

http://download.cnet.com/Games-for-Windows-Live/3000-18541_4-10966787.html

Install it and when the installation process is done. DO NOT LAUNCH IT. Uncheck the ""launch windows live"" or something like that then click done.

You may now play the game by using the fable 3 launcher in the fable 3 folder.

Enjoy the games pirates! Aye"

I've done exactly as the instructions say, so I'm not sure what's happening. I did have the issue of the paul.dll file being detected as a virus, but I allowed it through Microsoft Security Essentials. When I tried to load the game through any of the .exe files, nothing would load. Then I saw fallengun04's post, and DL'd Games for Windows, and logged in with my Live account. But now it asks for a serial, and won't accept the one that was provided.

Anyone have any advice?"

Don't waste your time lowering your graphics settings to poor.  I just googled ""fable 3 graphics issues"" and found this on a forum.

If anyone else has this problem read below:

Catalyst Control Center was causing this.

Go to Gaming -> 3D settings -> SMOOTHVISION HD anti aliasing. mark ""use application settings""

Same goes for SMOOTHVISION HD anisotropic Filtering.

Last thing to do is to unmark ""AMD Optimized""

,ZZZnipeRRR,2011-06-06T23:42Z,"Lol, how come everyone's got a problem with this? 

THIS IS WHAT TO DO!

1.Install.
2.Use serial: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111
3.Copy the crack to the game folder.*
4.Start the game and make a ""Local game profile""
5.Enjoy. :)

*If you have a problem with the PAUL.DLL being reckoned as a virus, just put two exception in your AV: The folder which you are gonna extract the files to, and your game folder!

Easy as pie.
I completed the game after about 1 day and it's quite ok.

When i try opening the FableLauncher.exe it asks for an activation key, tried with the 1s and no go, tried with the Xs and fail. Got a problem with the Games for Windows Live, I install it but whenever i try running it from the Games for windows marketplace.exe it prompts saying that i dont have the software redirecting me to the windows dl page over and over again.

First of all i tried to install the game from autorun, as it supposed to be installed. Used serial, and so on. But the progress bar stuck on about 30%. just like kddonovan01's. 
-Then i just opened mounted image in explorer and ran setup.exe. This thing installed the game without any troubles. 
-Next i installed all the additional stuff (g4w, updates) 
-Then copied (and replaced in game dir) paul.dll from the mounted image/skidrow folder
-Ran the game flawlessly after setting up offline account in g4w. Game works, atleast on the first stage =)
hope this info will helpful for ppl who have problems with installation. seeding with my lame slow internetz"
,guling1,2011-06-09T13:47Z,"This is will make the game work!!!

1. Mount it

2. Install the game with serial code: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111

3.Copy and paste paul.dll from Skidrow folder into >program files>microsoft games>fable3

4. Turn off the internet and install G4W (Game For Windows)

5.Launch the game with FableLauncher or F3Secu

,lt_reaver,2011-06-13T15:14Z,"I am sure someone already stated this, but there are so many people saying ""Please insert original CD"" that Ill throw it out again.

The Paul.dll is seen as a virus by the anti-viruses, and probably your windows firewall.. dont know I keep mine turned off... and you HAVE to add it to the exceptions lists since the anti-viruses will auto delete it.  

I just went ahead and added the WHOLE fable3 folder to the exceptions since other dll's and files had also been tagged for quarantine.  If you are going to pirate, then get used to working around crap like this, and expect to have to do a little worthwhile click work to get something running since you are dodging the whole $50+ price-tag issue.

Its simple, go to google, type in xlive.dll, find a website that is offering it for download (probably will be 1st result), download it, extract it to desktop if u have to. Then, copy xlive.dll and paste it into C:\Windows\System32


And it should hopefullly work again. Also, just paste it into the fable file folder just in case"

Seeing as you insist on being a complete douchebag, let's go over your errors instead.
1. ""So the one you pointed out aren't the only errors."" should read ""So the one you pointed out isn't the only error.""
2. ""Do you not read what you have wrote"" should say ""written""
2. ""Spelling mistakes in shorthand is complete noobishness"" should read ""are complete noobishness""
3. ""because your a noob"" should read ""you're.
4. ""borrow a wired controller of a mate"" should be ""off"" not ""of"".

The way i created an offline account was with GTA IV and Gears of War. Both of those have a version of GFWL that allows it. There may be other older games that have it though. If you have either of those games i'd uninstall GFWL (if you can) and then install one of those games. It will then allow you to create an offline account. I know that's a HUGE roundabout way to do it and there's probably an easier way but that's how i had to do it twice. I've tried finding a way to do it with the most recent GFWL's but i can't. Anyway, hope this helps."
,EvilAsh34,2011-07-04T14:19Z,"@korilz

There's also another potentially easier way to run the game. When it ask's for the serial hit the Home/Dashboard button on your 360 controller or keyboard. That will then log you out and let you play in ""offline mode"". That's how the people who are using the free DLC's get the game to work without logging in. Again, hope this helps.

First I had the trouble people mentioned with CD not being found. This is a result of paul.dll being deleted by your antivirus. Getting the paul.dll file into the installation folder was troublesome. I solved this by adding two exceptions in the options on my antivirus (Added exceptions for paul.dll in both the location on the cd, and in the installation folder). 

Having solved the CD issue, the game wouldnt start. This was solved by installing the program ""Games for Microsoft"", then running the file in the G4W folder on the CD. I also ran the setup file in the DirectX folder, but I dont think it had to do with anything.

Having done so, the game finally started. When asked to register, scroll down and press the ""Make a local account"" link, type a name for yourself, and your good to go.

,Avanale,2011-07-08T07:15Z,I have never had so many problems with a game before.  No matter what i do it will not allow me to copy the Paul.dll file to the game directory. This is so fucked up.
,Xarlequin,2011-07-08T15:35Z,"Kifon: Yes I am using Nod32 4.0.something.
To make an exception to the rules you first have to toggle advanced mode. Go on 'setup' and press ""Toggle Advanced Mode"". Next go to ""Setup"" and ""Antivirus and Spyware"" now, and the list will look different. Under ""Real-Time file system protection"" press the button ""Edit Exclusion"". Press ""Add"" and enter the path. For me it looks like this ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Fable III\paul.dll""

Basically, you create an exception for the file paul.dll before it actually exists.

You will still have to turn the active protection off before copying paul.dll into the folder. But NOD will no longer delete the file once it is there.

I hope my post helped :)"

How I installed :
- Mounted the ISO
- Installed Windows Live Games
- Installed the game using serial 11111

- Created a LOCAL account

2. Install the patch in the UPDATE folder on the Image by running setup.exe.

3. Add two exceptions in the options on your antivirus before copying paul.dll to 

installation  folder (Add exceptions for paul.dll in both the location of it - 1. the 

""SKIDROW"" folder on the image, and 2. in the installation folder - C:\Program Files\Microsoft 

Games\Fable III\paul.dll). 

4. Copy paul.dll to the installation folder.

5. Add ""F3Secu.exe"" to the Data Execution Prevention Exception List.
Go to control panel > system and security > system > click on Advanced system Settings
> Click on Settings under the Performance Frame > Click on the Data Execution Prevention tab
> Click add > Locate F3Secu.exe in the root of the installation folder.

I  have installed 100's of torrented games, many of them being Skidrow's. 

My problem that I have detailed still persists, in an attempt to further diagnose the issue I opened the event log, to see if there was any log of the error.

,ManWithBigTittys,2011-07-29T23:43Z,"Ok People. this dose work, A giant waste of time.

First shut down your antivirus.

Im using ESET smart security 5.

Follow the instructions. If you have a 32inch tv monitor, before you launch the game find the 
PCVideoOptionsApplet and ajust the default for your monitor.

Now launch the game. play have fun.

Keep in mind the moment you turn back on your antivirus the Paul.dll will be removed.

The game will no longer function.

Tuning off your antivirus and replacing the .dll wont work, Windows has marked this game as broke.

Then the game give you a Please insert disk 3 message, I doubt there's even 3 disk in the game.

The only way around this is to uninstall the Game then reinstall it

around and around you go!!


SKIDROW! Microsoft rushed this crappy game

and your hack team rushed that crappy paul.dll.

To the other people commenting, if you know nothing about installing games like this. Then don't say it doesn't work, it is a waste, or insult the up-loader because of your inability to comprehend and install it. 

It took me about 30 minutes after download to have it up and running.  Just follow the instructions and maybe learn a bit more about things like this. "

Also, anyone who says that Daemon tools is REQUIRED to play these games, try MagicDisc (It's easier to use, starts automatically, AUTOMOUNTS, and is just as reliable).  If you have a problem with it, heed my wisdom: It may not be be the EMULATOR, but the COMPUTER, which is causing the problem."

,Huulivoide,2011-08-13T11:32Z,"To get this working
1. you have to go the G4W folder on the disk and install the app
in that folder, after installing and updating the game.
(If you dont want to use the market itself, you can open the installer
[but don't install, just let it be open]
and it will create a folder with random name in the root of C drive
you should find a xliveredist.exe [or something like that] in that folder,
thats the only thing you need to install. Now you can close the main installer)

2.When the game starts and ask for a live account, chose new
it will display a box with text on it. Scroll down and you find a
link in the text that lets you create A OFFLINE account, if you click
continue it only lets you register online live account. So click the
link embended into the text ^^^."
,mbaker14,2011-08-13T19:37Z,Ok so i tried this and get the activate blah blah blah at game launch so figured id uninstall and start over but when i tried to use the unistall client it freezes every time and the unstall program through windows so i deleted the local content and it says its still installed

I love SkidRow Torrentz, I have done recently couple of the games worked so well, worth download.

Ok here is some easy step for FABLE III by SkidRow

The way I did it worked for me 

Step by Step Easy Guide:

1. Download Game

2. Install Game ( Setup.exe )

3. In the same sr-fable3 directory you'll find  
G4W diectory ( folder ) open and install gfwlivesetup.exe

4. Now open directory called UPDATED, open this directory and now click setup.exe. make sure your internection offline ( i tried during internet connection it diesn't work ) so do it OFFLINE, if you want to save your installtion time, in other case you have to re-install and waste more 20mins.

5. Once you update, now activate your internet connection

6. Play Game, click game icon in installtion folder, now you'll be asked for live account

7. Click new and then create local profile ( means offline account ) enjoy
happy price grab the crown woohoo.."

Yes, older games like Borderlands and Call Of Duty 4 have online capabilities with the pirated versions because the security on those games weren't nearly as efficient as on some of the games today. If you want to play online so badly then buy the fucking game. You all should feel lucky that groups of people like Mafia and SKIDROW are nice enough to distribute this shit for free. They work their asses off and all you fuck wads do is scream it doesn't work or it has a virus. I haven't even finished downloading this torrent yet and I bet there's a fucking readme in the .iso I have never had as much trouble as some of you people out there.

,boomboomroom,2011-09-19T04:29Z,"well looks like the 20th time was the charm...rofl


1.  Mount iso file, and install game
2. open g4w and install 
3. run UPDATE setup
4. right click on ISO, choose ""open with"" WINRAR
5. locate the paull.dll and extract to desktop
6. copy/paste into Fable directory
7. Delete xlive.dll in fable folder
8. Open game, Choose Next on Windows Live
9. Create new Profile, Choose Local Profile

Thats it, should not receive any kind of errors. Just installed this on 2 different computers using this exact method"

HELP! when i doownloaded it, i did not get an ISO file!!!! it say it is an iso type file, but its not, can it be that im using Daemon tools lite, and not pro?!?!?!"
,qwepoiup,2011-09-22T02:46Z,"finally got it working! THANK YOU EVERYONE! also, i know it's been said but i'll say it a little more simply. to the people that are having problems with the 11111... key, you're probably trying to use the key on the windows live sign in thing. only use that key on the actual installation of the game itself. what you have to do is hit that little home button on the top left corner, hit create new account, agree to the crap or whatever, then scroll to the very bottom and hit the ""create offline profile"", after you create it you should be home free!"

,deathly131,2011-09-24T01:25Z,"I have it working. 

I used bit torrent to download. Poweriso to mount and install the game.

 Copy over the files from the skidrow folder into the installation file, click yes if it asks to replace another file of the same name.

Open up youre computer folder, right click on the disk icon and click explore. In the updates folder run the setup file.

After that is done, go back into the disk contents window

open up another window. Go to youre installation file.

Go to the game disk content window. Copy the files from the skidrow folder directly into the installation folder. It asked me to replace another file and i clicked yes. It may or maynot for you.

Run the game. It will ask you to create a new account or log in. Create a new account. When it shows the window of the account information. Scroll to the bottom. Click on create local profile. This way you will not have to use an activation code or buy an account. You will not be connected to the internet though.
"
,deathly131,2011-09-24T02:40Z,"Let me correct my previous post a bit.

After you install the game. Go into the cd by using the explore feature. GO to the folder that says G4w. It stands for games for windows. Youll need it to save the game. Install it."

7: Go to the folder ""SKIDROW""
8: Copy it into the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Fable III""
9: Go to the folder ""UPDATE""

,HHHrfds,2011-10-08T21:14Z,"Here it goes the installation steps so you can solve problems such as the online activation code and etcetera:
1-Download
2-Seed
3-Mount the image with Daemon tools, power iso or whatever program you use.
4-Install the game using the personalized or the quick intallation(it really doesn't matter, do what you feel like) the serial must be 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111.
5-Go to the mounted Dvd and copy the Paul.dll file that is inside the SKIDROW folder to your installation folder(the default is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Fable III) and be sure it substitutes the paul.dll inside there
6-In the Dvd you mounted there is a folder called UPDATE. open and open the Setup.exe.
7-Let it update the game, when it finishes you go to the Dvd mounted and open the folder G4W. open it and install the Games for Windows Live using the only program in there (if you wanna play some other games that need it and you aren't lazy, download the version 3.0.89.0 because it is the best).
8-Go to the Dvd and open the Folder MSVCRT. there should be a program called vcredist_x86.exe and you must install it.
9-Play the game
10-Have Fun :)

Tips and hints:
1-If the game asks for the Online installation code then you didn't installed the vcredist_x86.exe that is in the MSVCRT folder( see step 8)
2-If the game always stop running in the part of the game of the castle underneath or any else, the problem is ocasional and may happen to anybody, including those who bought the game, so chill out and install again

please support Extremezone and Skidrow."

When running the EXE, you may encounter this error message randomly in regards to Fable3.exe causing an APPCRASH. It may be related to XLIVE.DLL or your save files being in the wrong location. Of course, it could be related to the Windows Live ID Sign-in or some other problems. This also happens after obtaining the guild seal sometimes or even several other things. Try the following:

â€“ Download and Install Windows Live ID Sign-in Assistant 6.5 choosing between the 64bit and 32bit versions depending on your Windows operating system
â€“ Try to register your xlive.dll by going to Start -> Run â€” cmd â€” then type in REGSVR32 /u C:\path\to\the\xlive.dll
â€“ Run the Fable 3 exe in Windows XP compatibility Service Pack 3 (SP3) mode, Launcher, as well as Steam and any other related file
â€“ Close any program that could possibly interfere with the game or its components (i.e. a firewall)
â€“ Go to the Control Panel and choose uninstall/reinstall and choose REPAIR
â€“ Reinstall / Repair Games For Windows Live / GWL
â€“ Reboot your computer
â€“ Reinstall Microsoft Games for Windows and Windows Live Essentials (GFWL / GWL / WLE). You can repair Microsoft Life Essentials via the Control Panel instead, but try reinstalling completely if that does not work.
â€“ Try logging into the Games for Windows Marketplace before launching / opening Fable 3

 Thanks! I was trying for a while to start it using my existing account and it wasn't working, I was almost thinking the crack was somehow faulty (although I've never had a problem with a skidrow release) Until I read your post about a local profile. Thanks for your Input! and Thanks skidrow for another Great release!"

,snoozr,2011-12-21T18:24Z,"Guys if you have done everything by the instructions and still getting wrong/no cd inserted message then check your antivirus software. There is a good chance paul.dll has been quarantined.  You may have to do as I did in ESET and restore paul.dll to the correct folder then you create an exclusion for paul.dll.  You can do that in ESET in advance setup>antivirus/antispyware>exclusions.

Hope this helps those of you that are having issues."

,Johann-Weiss,2012-03-14T18:53Z,"@Diana..
My game didn't start too. Probably that's because ""Games for Windows Live"" wasn't installed automatically.
So I went to DVD-image, folder G4W and started manually:
gfwlivesetup.exe
This installed it.
All the attempts to connect to Inet I blocked by a firewall (or I could just disable the all connection, temporarily).
I run Games for Win Live and so could create the local profile. Then Fable 3 (FableLauncher.exe) runs OK.
Enjoy! Thanks to all people helping us to try this thing!"

,madad58,2012-03-20T05:50Z,"HOW TO FREAKING MAKE IT WORK!

All the answers are in the comments, it saddens me to see how hard it is for people to follow simple instructions

You need to do this:

1. Disconnect the Internet

2. Mount or burn image

3. Install using serial: 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111

4. Run setup.exe from the UPDATE folder on the DVD to update game

5. Copy the poul.dll files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation.

6. Install the gfwlivesetup.exe from the G4W folder on the DVD

7. Start the game. Click on  create a new account.
TO CREATE A LOCAL ACCOUNT: scroll down and click the link ""create local profile""

8. If you did everything right, everything SHOULD work.

Initial problem: After following the included instructions, the game would run for a second (no game screen, just a started process), then the process would end, and I couldn't play the game.
The fix: Change the compatibility of the Fable Launcher.exe to Windows XP Service Pack 3.
For those of you who would like full instructions, I followed this instruction set:
1. Disconnected internet 
2. Mounted the .iso
3. Installed Games for Windows Live in GFWL folder.
4. Ran setup, installed using serial included by SKIDROW.
5. Ran setup.exe from UPDATE folder.
5a. Just cancel when it asks to validate through online authentication.
6. Copied files from SKIDROW folder to game installation (overwrite paul.dll).
7. Change permission of FableLauncher.exe to Windows XP Service Pack 3.
8. Ran the game, Games for Windows Live popped up, created a personal account for offline use, and signed in using the account.
9. Reconnected internet and played the game.

Hope this helps someone who (like me) has grown tired of perusing forums for broken fixes.
And for all those who comment about Cease and Desist letters, you shouldn't be torrenting unless you understand the risks and properly protect yourself."

For those who have to try and get through the second code or the game not running when you click it, here is what you do:
1. Disconnect from the internet
2. Mount the disc
3. Install
4. Go to computer, right click and open the game files in a folder.
5. Click on G4W and install microsoft live
6. Run the update;when it asks for validation code, cancel.
7. Copy the files from SKIDROW folder to your directory. 
8 Modify the settings for the Fable III launcher as Windows XP Service Pack 3
9. Right click and run as administrator.
10. It will say that you need to make an account for windows live. Click make new account. You should be brought to a screen with a lot of words on it. Scroll down and click the blue link in the long article. 
11. You will new be brought through the intro.

,draecon99,2012-06-19T00:05Z,im not slow i promise but im very new to torrenting and while i can learn if given precise instructions ive never use a computer for anything other than playing a disk game or a movie really. theres a list of things to do in order to make this work(in like 50 places YAAAY :D ) but see im still computer stupid so after searching extensively( i probably am just dumb and missed it) i cant locate the directory or the ProgramFiles/MicrosoftGames/Fable3. yeah that thing so i can copy the crack over. i know i saw someone do it ages ago and its very easy i just need some help figuring it out. thanks -sincerely Forevernoobly :D
,draecon99,2012-06-19T00:49Z,figured it out the file wasnt showing up in the directory and had to be tracked down manually try looking for it within the computer for those who have had this same issue- ForeverNoobly
