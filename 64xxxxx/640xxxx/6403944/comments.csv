,sliv3rpl,2011-05-19T22:27Z,"so, i need run abgx360 or not, before i burn it?"
,Pass2347,2011-05-20T14:12Z,"Listen people, the game is 100% ok. The only thing that you have to do considering DVD 1, is to install the game on your HDD. Simply press Y from the dashboard and Install Game. I've played it for hours and it's ok. About the rest DVD's, I don't know because I haven't tried them yet."
,elyolker,2011-05-20T16:22Z,The first DVD from other releases worked fine as well. The first DVD is not the DVD people are interested in.
,cazzie12,2011-05-20T17:34Z,it takes my like 3 days to download is that just me in ney to the game downloading by the way and is there any way to speed it up becouse it takes like 30 minutes for 0.1 procent to go up i left it on 1 whole night and it was on 9 percent

,wishmasteruk,2011-05-21T13:19Z,"Just a quick question, will my save from the original RF disc one still work with these?? i'm guessing they will but just checking thanks"
,Yestoor,2011-05-21T13:57Z,do i need to use agbx on this game since i only play offline 
,wishmasteruk,2011-05-22T11:40Z,"tested with old saves and they work fine if anyone was wondering, you don't need to use agbx as all iso's are already Stealthed unless you just want a piece of mind."
,BradderZz,2011-05-22T13:35Z,"Very good game, Burn at 6x or 8x to stop it from freezing mid game, thanks for torrent :)"
,BradderZz,2011-05-22T13:37Z,"Great game works well, i found it freezed on disc 2 about 30mins in but burnt to disc again on a higher speed (6x) and worked much better, Thanks for the torrent :) "
,BradderZz,2011-05-22T13:42Z,"Great game works well, i found it freezed on disc 2 about 30mins in but burnt to disc again on a higher speed 6x and worked much better, Thanks for the torrent"
,Mackthesmack,2011-05-23T13:57Z,I don't get it to work. At the dashboard it doesn't recognize disc as a game but as a DVD and I dont get the option to install it on my harddrive. Wich flash version do I need?
,popcorn_90,2011-05-24T22:12Z,"Just burn the gameimages on dual layer dvds, then install it on your xbox360 harddrive. 
When you're going to play the game, insert the dvd but play from the hard drive instead :)


The game will now stop freezing :)  ! It works 100% for me. Before I did this it would freeze all the time and I burned with 4- and 6x speed.

Sry for bad english ;) "
,2812jp,2011-05-25T14:22Z,i know this might sound daft.But do i need to mod my disc drive firmware to use this game once ive put it on a disc.Just got my xbox and didnt want to open it up.its the old white xbox with the latest dashboard.any help would be great.thanks all 
,TheHFH,2011-05-25T23:26Z,"Guys before u update ur xbox 360 dash check http://www.ixtreme.net/ to see if it's safe or not, well bad luck for every one who did update i guys need to reflash ur 360s..."
,Joe_BB,2011-05-26T04:48Z,Only tried Disk 1 so far. Installed to Hard drive. Works well.  Thankyou
,homdawg,2011-05-29T08:06Z,"thanx...works great i am in disc 2 
disc 1 and 2 works great so far.."
,andreyvul,2011-06-14T08:20Z,"@2812jp: Wait for iXtreme LT+ 1.9.  And, yes, you do need to mod the drive firmware. Seeing as you have the latest dash, use of LT+ 1.1 is risky. Also, AP25 games won't work."
,anon1993,2011-06-17T13:11Z,"hey guys ! i am having trouble playing games on my 360 with lt+ firmware ...when i play a game it says ""Open Tray"" this problem occours only with new games like mortal kombat and marvel vs. capcom ... HELP...!!!"
,SteelerJ17,2011-06-21T17:29Z,@ anon1993 I'm having the same problem too. I think it's the new xbl dashboard 2.0.13146.0. People are saying if you flash your drive to ixtreme LT 1.9 that you will be able to play your games. 
,SamLovesJess,2011-07-08T22:17Z,"absolutely amazing, every disk works perfect. 10/10"

,Mr_Detzoe,2011-07-17T17:29Z,"First game download for me, can someone tell me from scratch what i need to do please, have standard xbox elite... Much appreciated !"
,DavOHammett,2011-07-17T18:45Z,"Your xbox got the las firmware released by C4eva?
Or it is original?"
,WaxMaNuts384,2011-07-27T06:44Z,"@ Mr_Detzoe: You need to go on craigslist and find a person to flash your DVD drive(requires them to open xbox up and void warranty), it is best if you open it up and find what manufacture you have for your drive as there are many(hitachi,samsung, etc) and ask the flasher if they can do that drive.
Next you want to go to a electronics store and get VERBATIM DVD+R DL(only disk to work with burning games).
Download IMGburn.
Download ABGX 360 GUI
Check to make sure game will work on xbox with ABGX
Open IMGburn and write image to disk(make sure you select .dvd file)
Put disk in your dvd dl drive(need a dvd dl burner for dl disk)
Sleep, eat, shit, or smoke a blunt. Come back and your game will be ready for your flashed xbox.
I bought a ssomewhat broken xbox off craigslist and found a guy to flash it for $20 on criagslist. 
I would NOT flash a new/main xbox you use for all your gaming/movies/netflix/hulu as your console will be banned if you are caught modding your xbox.

Hope this helps out, and good gaming to you."
