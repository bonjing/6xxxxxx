Ok last time I uploaded this I got banned because I accidently said this was in RAR format, which apparently is a very bad idea. So here it is again, with no compression at all. Just the files in a folder. Here\'s an edited version of the description I used for the last one (so now it\'s correct and hopefully wont get me banned)  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a CD-ROM version of the textbook \"Modern World History- Patterns of Interaction\" by McDougal Little (or published by him/them or something; it\'s on the covver haha). This is my first torrent (now a re-upload of my first). I got the files for this from a different non-torrent site, and decided to upload it here as a first attempt and learn what to do (and what not to do, as it turned out). 

I didn\'t expect much interest in this torrent, but after just two hours I had like 35 connections so I guess there is. My connection sucks, so until someone else gets all this and starts seeding, it\'ll be really slow and I may not always be available for seeding.  

Hopefully I set this up right, if not let me know in the comments and I\'ll try again. Although a PM on superbay (or is it suprbay?)  with the same username (Slammer94) would be much faster.

Enjoy my first (revised!) attempt :)

And please don\'t report or ban this or whatever, it\'s totally clean (McAfee has no problem with it, at least) and it\'s a pain to re-upload stuff. If there\'s a problem, just put it in the comments or PM me and I\'ll happily fix it as needed to the best of my ability. Thanks, and hopefully this will work out and I can begin to give back to the community I love so much!
