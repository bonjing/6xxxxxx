Black & White is a computer game developed by Lionhead Studios and published by Electronic Arts and Feral Interactive. It is a god game released in 2001, which included elements of artificial life, strategy, and fighting games.

The player acts as a god and takes control over villages across several islands. Black & White features a unique gameplay element, a creature that the player can raise and teach. The game was highly anticipated and overall well received.

It was followed by an expansion, Black & White: Creature Isle, and a sequel, Black & White 2.

A port for the Sega Dreamcast was in development but was canceled due to the end of the system's production line.
