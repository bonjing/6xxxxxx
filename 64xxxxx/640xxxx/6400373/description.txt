Plot:-

The plot spins around Veum's girlfriends sister. Her sister is a prostitute,
and through her discovered shady actions, drug dealing, pimping and other
criminal activity. But even the Swedish director Stephan Apelgren, do not get
the story to hang together well enough. Some action scenes have splash, but
most of this is strangely tame.
