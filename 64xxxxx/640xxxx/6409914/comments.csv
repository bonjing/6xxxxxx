[T],swebarb,2011-05-21T00:57Z,"Still doesnt work i dont get it, put items in cooked dir but still dont see them in my inventory or at the blacksmith merchant..

ffs :("
,premiado,2011-05-21T02:58Z,are the files in .dlc or .dzip format?
,shinnok789,2011-05-21T11:44Z,"It works. Just put the DLC files as is written in the nfo file and it works witout doing anything else. I received the items in my inventory (3 runes, an armour, a pair of trousers and a pair of gloves). For the Troll Trouble sidequest, first take the notice from the board near the inn that sais about registering and downloading the DLC, exit from the board and re-click the board, and a new note appears with the actual sidequest. Take it and that's that. As for the misterious Merchant i do not know for now. Hope this helps."
,lostlegends,2011-05-22T03:24Z,"Thanks, everything works. merchant was in dwarf city."
,Amphrax,2011-05-22T03:59Z,"yeah this one works, the other two torrents doesnt seem to work cuz of the .dlc files. thanks for shareing this"
,toto621,2011-05-22T11:18Z,"There are a few more DLC available on the net, here the full list list :
- Alchemy_suit (In this DLC Pack)
- Magical_suit (In this DLC Pack)
- Merchant (In this DLC Pack)
- Roche_jacket (In this DLC Pack)
- Swordsman_suit
- Troll_trouble (In this DLC Pack)
- Finisher_pack

I can't find working links for missing DLC and the only DLC not available on the net for the moment is ""finisher pack"" one, given with Amazon pre-order.

So, if someone can find the missing DLCs it could be great to post it here :)"
,Mantisa,2011-05-24T22:34Z,Works like a charm. Too bad you hadn't the rest of the DLCs.
,svetkopetko5,2011-05-26T12:38Z,"it's working fine, i'm just confused about the ""suits"" since i only got a blue armor, mage's trouser and herbalist's gloves. is that what you mean by ""suit""?"
