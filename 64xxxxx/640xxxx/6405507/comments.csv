[T],jmanwf,2011-08-16T09:11Z,It is a codec problem use vlc media player to decode audio etc.  I always test all my uploads before i post them to make sure they work
,EricaBleu,2011-12-11T18:53Z,"At first I didn't have audio, but only on the movie itself, the extras were fine. Then I used vlc as suggested and the audio works. However, all the other stuff is subtitled, but the film is not. I don't speak French well enough to watch it without subtitles. There's no way to fix that right?"
