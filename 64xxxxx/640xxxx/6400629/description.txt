The U.S. National Cancer Institute established the Cancer Outcomes Measurement Working Group in 2001 to evaluate measurements of the important and diverse impacts of cancer on individuals and populations. The findings and recommendations of the working group's 35 internationally recognized members provide alternative approaches for comprehensively measuring the burden of cancer and the effectiveness of preventive and therapeutic interventions.
