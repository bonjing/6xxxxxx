The Beatles - Strawberry Fields Forever EP [1967, Jugoton, former Yugoslavia]

128kbps, true center MONO
 

There are four track on this EP:


1 Strawberry Fields Forever
 
2 Penny Lane
 
3 And your bird can sing
 
4 I'm only sleeping 

To recreate this EP, as it was released in former Yugoslavia in 1967, the dual channel mono mixes from "The Beatles in MONO" were remixed into a single center channel at 128 kbps as a true mono with a slight compression. The results were beyond expectations even though the additional remixes were done with relatively modest software packages. When compared with real vinyl EP, there's virtually no difference in sound levels, frequency response and dynamics.
