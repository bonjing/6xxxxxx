BOOK INFO:

In the past decades, model reduction has become an ubiquitous tool in analysis and simulation of dynamical systems, control design, circuit simulation, structural dynamics, CFD, and many other disciplines dealing with complex physical models. The aim of this book is to survey some of the most successful model reduction methods in tutorial style articles and to present benchmark problems from several application areas for testing and comparing existing and new algorithms. As the discussed methods have often been developed in parallel in disconnected application areas, the intention of the mini-workshop in Oberwolfach and its proceedings is to make these ideas available to researchers and practitioners from all these different disciplines.
