thx mate, another perfect audio

Russian Dvd was very nice, still needed some sharpness brightness and chroma.
got really nice, looks like a BDRip, and i mean it like that.
The Perfect Studio Quality Line just fits perfect to the Video.
I synced the line like always â€œlipsyncâ€ to the dvd9. Was much work since the movie has a lot of spoken scenes.
Nothing is cut anywhere, full audio embedded in the cleaned russian 5.1 track.
its a damned retail-like Rip. -- watch sample

Like always my Audio fits on any direct DVD Encode!"
