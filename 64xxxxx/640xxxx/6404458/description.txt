An impossibly hard to find album that was deleted quite some time ago. This is almost certainly a pan-cultural album, citing both Eastern (Asia), and western influences...a focus on less tracks and stronger compositions is the template to which the stunning epic opener of "Heaven & Earth" with it's oriental gong's, flutes, guitar (acoustic), and quintessential Hong Kong melodrama evokes the film score from "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", and its instrumental brilliance is only matched by its ambition. The first vocal track "A Love Song" neatly encapsulates Jah wobbles strongest attributes...coaxing inspired vocals from collaborative vocalists (in this case female singer "Natacha Atlas"), who lends a tremendous singing performance in her native tongue. By the time the epically changing "Gone To Croatan"...a 15 minute orchestral worldbeat track with legendary bassist "Bill Laswell" performing, or the western percussionist flavoured "Hit Me" with the very subtlest elements of deft turntable scratching (with Turntable virtuoso "Rob Swift") bring things a to a extremely satisfying conclusions....you'll no doubt be in agreement, that this is unarguably Jah Wobbles greatest (solo) album.....truly captivating.
