Office 2010 Starter Edition Russian


language - Russian


Remarks

This is home-made build by me (imitare). I downloaded the files from the Microsoft website and created a ISO image
Starter contains Word & Excell
No activation required
Vista SP1 or higher required.
Make sure you don't have "Q:\" assigned as a driveletter. The installer uses "Q:\" to create a virtual drive.


Sincerely, Imitare.
