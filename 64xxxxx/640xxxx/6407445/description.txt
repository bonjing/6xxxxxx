In 11th-century Spain, the Christian kingdoms of Castile, Leon, and Aragon face
the constant threat of the warring Moors and their determination to spread the
Islamic culture throughout all of Europe. Into this arena of violence rides
Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, whose courage, wisdom, and spiritual strength earn him
the sobriquet El Cid, or "The Lord."...

Amongst the many other plus points are the exciting action scenes, in particular
the combat for Caloharra, which, although the viewer is never in any doubt that
Rodrigo will be victorious, is superbly performed and totally convincing. Also,
Miklos Rosza's impressive score ranks amongst his very best.

Notes
Music includes "Love Theme", music by Miklos Rozsa, words by Paul Francis Webster.
