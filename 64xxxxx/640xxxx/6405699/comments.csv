,xxTriGxx,2011-05-24T20:43Z,What are you supposed to do after getting the files. 
,alexisalex,2011-05-31T16:32Z,"Does this have the zombies maps included? If not where can I find them? Also do custom maps work with this torrent? Well anyways I'll seed for a while after downloading, remember people seed other people use the pirate bay too."
,theblanc,2011-06-02T01:10Z,"Can anyone get this torrent working? I have tried, and cannot get the patches to work.

What I have done:
D/L torrent
unpack rld-cod5.iso
tried to run patch, failed.

when i run the patch, i specified the install folder as the rld-cod5 folder i get from unpacking the .iso file. is there a different folder i should specify? can someone help me with this? I'm still seeding so please download and tell me how to get this running."
,BG_Pirate,2011-06-02T21:02Z,"Works perfect on a notebook with Win7.

@ theblanc There's no problem with the patches. The loaded very slow, but they installed fine.
You don't have to specify any folder, the patch should find it by itself."
,jjj701081,2011-06-12T02:34Z,"dude, it's asking me for a installation code when i an running steup.exe, cn you tell me what is the deal here. "
,BG_Pirate,2011-06-17T12:07Z,"@ jjj701081
Just type ""call of duty world at war serial"" in google and type some of the CD keys, when asked by the setup.

The uploader should have included this information in the torrent, but anyway...

It would be nice if more such torrents are uploaded, I mean with all the patches included. I don't like to play broken games."
