I've seen some torrents for the individual discs of L.A. Noire, but I thought "having to download them individually is just a pain in the butt, so let's put them in one torrent!". I also took the liberty of patching them all to SSv2 AND fixing the Video CRC errors with disc's 2 and 3. They're 100% green through abgx and 100% ready to burn.
