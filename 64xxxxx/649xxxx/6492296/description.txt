Here is another one of my messy archives of Buddhist materials in a variety of formats, although not EPUB or MOBI. I am uploading these with the hope that some downloaders will convert them to EPUB and MOBI for use on popular ebook readers.

This torrent includes texts on sex, science, daily devotion, ecology, American Buddhism, funerals, economics, prayers, and relics. There are also stories for young people. Many of these files come from Buddhanet.net, where you can find many more Buddhist resources (graphics, texts, audios).

Take what you want, share what you take, and please seed.
