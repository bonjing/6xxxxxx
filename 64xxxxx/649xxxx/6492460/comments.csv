,SgtSposh,2011-08-13T18:52Z,"I dont use ANY 64 bit operating system for the next 5 years 4 sure cause I dont believe it will bring any profit for users in the next years whatsoever. XP sp3 is used by widely over 50 percent worldwide and it surely is the most stable, updated and bugfixed microsoft product u will ever put ur hands on. Imho and as far as I saw it around my friends using a 64 bit OS brings NO (!) benefits cause only  a few new application and games using 64 bit and multi processor techs so far and the rest is just marketing bullshit to make u buy ms shit... so I only test everything on a plain 3-4 years old install of winxp and leave the fancy gfx processortime consuming capitalism shit to others who have the time to become headaches on this ;) ... /sgts"
