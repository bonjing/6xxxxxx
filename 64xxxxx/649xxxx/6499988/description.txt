"No light Behind" is the name of long awaited full length
album from this Dutch band (featuring ex-members of Bunkur
together with current members of Planet Aids and Funeral
Goat) that wraps seven tracks of depressive torturing
Doom/Dark Metal. With unique mix between traditional doom
riffing, stoner doom, elements of 70s proto-metal and some
blackish influences, Abysmal Darkening managed to create a
new form of audio sonic terrorrism. Transcendental, sharp,
suicidal, old school music and yes, it is recommended to
fans of Bethlehem, Deinonychus and even Celtic Frost and
Urfaust.
