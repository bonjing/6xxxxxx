,eastindiaco,2011-11-01T20:48Z,"Hey 'Anonymous' / Gui Gon Gin,

Great idea but you need to do these better...

a) register properly on The Pirate Bay or fill up your profile properly so you don't show as 'Anonymous'

b) I'm guessing you're shy of writing in English because you're not 'proficient'? Don't let that worry you. It's more important to list the contents of your torrent especially if you're gonna be u/l'ing like 15+ GB!!!

Not every one connects on a high-speed broadband so we don't like to be 'surprised' after d/l'ing for days, even months.

Otherwise, appreciate your intent and gesture.

Improve your 'GUI', drink 'GIN' and don't be 'GON' for long ;-)"
