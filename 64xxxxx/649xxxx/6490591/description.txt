Proper Notes.....: RCDiVX propered ViLD for LESS blended frames. I didn't know that it was even allowed to proper for LESS
		   technical flaws. That's like propering with a release that has LESS weather spam - not allowed. RCDiVX's
		   release suffers from the same blended frames as ViLD's. When are you silly PAL cappers going to figure it out?
		  
Release Notes....: As an added bonus, you won't have to listen to the annoying British narrator! Also, with the new rules, this
		   release is at the source's native 60fps and at a much higher bitrate thanks to CRF. Enjoy!
