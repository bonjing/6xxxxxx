,mre4you,2011-09-15T07:02Z,"@mirtle
I opened the ""inflow.inventory.premium.2.3.2.1-mpt"" file and clicked the heads. All that happened was the box on the lower left said ""OK"" am i missing a step here? There is not numbers or activation code to copy. Anyone else figured it out?"
,Truvbay,2011-09-24T05:19Z,"Click on the head, then it patches the dll. Works fine. Thanks for the up."
,luisfer26,2011-10-12T17:25Z,I clicked on the heads and got the OK! sign. But when I open the application it still says I'm using the Free Version. Is it possible that the patch doesn't work anymore?
,oO_mustafa98_Oo,2011-10-15T16:27Z,"YESS FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT!
ITS REALLY EASY JUST DON'T UPGRADE OR IT DOESNT WORK AND IF YOU'VE ALREADY UPGRADED YOU CAN JUST INSTALL AGAIN WITHOUT UPGRADING. THEN JUST CLICK THE PATCH KEY THING AND CLICK ON THE FACE CLOSE EVERYTHING AND RE OPEN INFLOW AND IT SHOULD SAY PREMIUM EDITION :)"
,corkey2669,2011-12-05T18:21Z,"must be the blonde in me but I did not update and hit the little head and got the ok. But when I re-started the program, it still says the free edition as well. I tried the crack with the program running and without as well. Can someone help me out. Thank you."
,lostone124,2012-04-07T21:46Z,"OK so i'm lost,

,lostone124,2012-04-08T23:29Z,"Lol don't worry, Nortons was deleting my files."
,magogmike,2012-04-22T23:38Z,"could someone please provide a step by step instruction protocol or something on how to install this software. I need it for my business to keep my customers organized and my supplier list in tact as well as orders. i attempted to install several times. not sure if i dont know what im doing but everytime when it gets to the end of installation i get an ""installation was not installled correctly message. Thank you follow people who steal ""sh!#"" rather than payin for it :)"
,gabalex65,2012-05-04T18:19Z,It Works fine! Guys Don`t forget to run the patch as administrator
,mcm4gm,2012-06-04T12:55Z,"Thanks this works great!

For everyone that hasn't been able to get it working, this is what you have to do:
Firstly if you open the ""inflow.inventory.premium.2.3.2.1-mpt"" folder.
You can right click the MPT file and press ""open with"" the in the pop up window press ""choose program"" and open with ""Notepad"". This will have brief instructions.

OK to make the program work you need to run the ""inFlow_DL_setup"" application. When it has finished installing and it launches the program it will say it is the free trial version. (If a pop up box asks to upgrade, click the ""DON'T INSTALL"" button.) 

Now close the program and go into the ""inflow.inventory.premium.2.3.2.1-mpt"" folder and right click the ""inflow.inventory.premium.2.3.2.1-mpt"" file (this is the patcher) now press ""open as administrator"" you need to do this to make the patch work! 

A little box opens up with 2 heads (demon monster heads?) click either one and a tiny little box will appear under the left head with the drive the software is located eg. c:/ 

You can close this patcher app now and re-open Inflow Inventory program and it will now say ""Premium Edition""

Hope this helped."
