40th anniversary edition of this seminal album released by Rhino as 2 CD set with superb artwork and complete mega booklet. The first CD contains the original album newly remastered, and though there is no indication that better quality tapes were used there's still a notable improvement from the 2001 expanded edition, at least some little sound glitches are no longer here. But the highlight is the second CD with an alternate mix of the whole album plus 10 bonus tracks between outtakes, demos and singles. This alternate mix dates from the original sessions, giving to the tracks a greater historical value; they contrast nicely with the original mix, the sound is punchier, with more vocal clarity and better bass definition. The bonus tracks are also excellent, although some were already in the previous edition. Despite the high quality of this release I think it is far from being considered as the definitive edition of this classic album; for this Rhino should have done a triple CD containing the hard to find mono mix ... maybe for the 50th anniversary edition?.
