Haunted History USA (2001-2002) Collection#2 (paranormal ghosts etc)


note some episodes are still missing.. but this is all I could find
the best I could do.

covers new york ghosts to tombstone many different USA towns & locations

Note, I could only find 5 part files of mp4 format of these episodes.. although reasonable quality the source is obviously studio tape not HD digital
given the year it was produced.


I converted all to xvid format 1000kps and mp3 audio

using VLC real time sharpener filter works well !!

its a big torrent probably the last big share I do this year.. so enjoy it

note if you get invalid torrent.. then your isp or demon timed out
try using the text file variant rather then .torrent as its quiet big torrent file


ENJOY and HELP TO SEED! i cant do it alone



PS. I HAVE TRIED TO UPLOAD HAUNTED HISTORY UK TO THIS SITE BUT IT WON'T TAKE IT. HAVE UPLOADED TO BT JUNKIE IF YOU WANT IT.
