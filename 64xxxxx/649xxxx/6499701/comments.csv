A/8
V/7
Great audio for a TS, no background noises or any other problems as such. The pictures pretty decent, there's the odd focus issue here and there, but most of the movie is fairly clean... Really Good copy for a early release CAM...
Many Thanx to SAFCukO09 and DTRG for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"

,dancingmystery,2011-06-29T01:33Z,"I seriously just went to the theatre to see this movie 2 days because I couldn't find it online, and now here it is!  /facepalm/ 
I'm going to wait for a rip since I've seen it but I will said it's highlarious and definitely worth the dl if you've been waiting to see it like I was..."
,deeemaych,2011-06-29T03:04Z,"wow thanks for the upload!!

but the most embarrassing thing happened last night.. i invited like 6 of my friends over to watch this movie on my tv since i finally got, i told em all the quality isnt what im used to, but that its all i could get so far and its watchable..

i put it on my USB stick, put in my PS3, hit play...... and the damn CINAVIA alert came up 30 secs into it... i shouldve tested it first before i invited everyone..

we all ended up watching Arthur instead.. but it wasnt nearly as good as it wouldve been if Bridesmaids worked...

does anyone know of a copy of Bridesmaids that not PS3/Cinavia protected??

thanks in advance!!"
,davey62,2011-06-29T04:36Z,"hey all you fucktards who ask for specific movies?  fuck you. go pay for something once in a while, dickwads.  "
,DiscGolfNutt,2011-06-29T07:20Z,Fucking useless if you want to watch it on the PS3. Another Cinavia protected movie. Really irritating that no one can add that to the movie description. Would take a whopping 2 seconds to add that so we don't waste our time downloading it in the first place.
,aj2thec,2011-06-29T11:54Z,"For a Cam:

,TipsyGipsy,2011-06-30T12:12Z,Best TS in a very long time! Enjoyed watching. Thanks SO much to SAFcukO09!
,ropadope,2011-07-01T21:02Z,Hey if you're stuck on Cinavia and ps3's shitty worries about protection. then get an xbox 360. i never have a problem playing any movie i dl.
,Nogrog,2011-07-02T00:23Z,Works well on Xbox360. PS3 is for Sony douches.
,derbipower,2011-07-02T06:28Z,"Wtf!
Don't call this a 8/8 vid..
This is a cam. Cam is allways bad, and will allways be.
This video is 3/7 at most.."

,f.kruger,2011-07-15T10:00Z,"thanks for the up SAF, 
ok for a cam rip A7 V6-7 might be better to wait for a better rip if you want a clearer pic but as it is a very good plot/gag movie don't matter too much."
,usa3004,2011-07-16T02:57Z,total douche bag. this video is protected. dont pload crap when its protected you jackass.
,ust2,2011-07-16T06:37Z,"@deeemaych

 Thx for the Cinivia warning.

 These movies are produced with the Cinivia audio mark in the background though, so sadly every copy will have it no matter the source..

 Pretty ingenious creation, too bad I hate it too much to admire lol."
,bazelos13,2011-07-18T21:28Z,Please dont upload movies with cams.They suck
,Aledd,2011-07-22T22:01Z,"@bazelos13 It's a Cam or you have to wait for like another month for a better copy... You Decide...

If you don't like Cam Copies don't DL them."
,Monster1512,2011-07-23T08:40Z,"Why is everyone sooking about this movie?
You guys are saying ""oh gross its cam yuk dont download""

First of all its a TS, it says so in the title, much better quality that some douchebag with a camera phone.

Secondly, its FREE, if your going to QQ about the quality like a typical internet tool, go actually pay to watch it in good quality.

Boneheads."
,Fixdeman,2011-07-23T17:04Z,"Great upload. thanks.
Subs anyone?"
,jvanwey,2011-07-24T01:44Z,how and why do you use ciniva on a cam. i though it was only on newer blu ray rips
,gtr1022,2011-07-24T22:12Z,"Thanks SAFCukO09.

Yeah, CAMS usually suck, but we watched this outside projected onto a 10' screen and laughed our asses off.

Well worth the quick DL."

you need to change your ps3 audio settings to multi output.. and then make the default output device the optical out.. cinavia DOES NOT track piracy through the optical port.. i have no idea why,"
,b1hb0y,2011-08-16T17:01Z,why do u guys keep insisting on playing movies on your ps3's have you heard of other things?
,KF7878,2011-08-21T08:19Z,"CINAVIA information:

This worked for me:

1. Extract audio from Cinavia movie. I used Magix movie edit pro. Broke the link between sound and video.ï»¿ Exported the sound as .wav.

2. Then i opened the file in Adobe Audition 3.0. Opened Effect-->Time and pitch-->Pitch shifter to adjust the ""pitch"" to -1 and ""cents"" to 0.

3. Saved the file as .wav

4. Opened the program ""Avidemux 2.5"" and opened the Cinavia protected .avi movie. Go toï»¿ Audio-->Main track-->Audio source. Then chose your edited .wav file.

5. Save as xx.avi"
