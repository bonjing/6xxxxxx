 Brian Luther Bowen delivers a straight forward approach to songwriting through vivid imagery inspired by the likes of Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Guy Clark, John Prine, and Robert Earl Keen. His no fear approach to songwriting allows him the luxury of not being constrained by genre. From boogey blues to love ballads, to honky tonk shit kicker, Brian Luther Bowen brings the listener straight to the point
