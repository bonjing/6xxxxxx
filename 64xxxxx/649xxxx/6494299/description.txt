Release Notes:



Gardens & Villa channel all the taut pop precisions of 90s Britpop of bands like
Blur (borrowed from the 60s anyhow), and send it through an 80s synth filter
both undeniably coastal and modern. It's Spoon's Kill The Moonlight lost in a
daydream, but with that same hungry energy. Gardens & Villa may simultaneously
pull from Gary Numan, The Kinks and odder prog within one composition. And like
a fine sweet tea, it's made just that right kind of sugary though even the most
upbeat tunes have an undercurrent of the bittersweet and the lost at heart.
