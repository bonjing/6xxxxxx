Convert most video formats into .mp4 for use with your favorite devices. 

See http://www.mp4converter.net/mp4-converter-win.html for a description, I'm not going to post all the info on here.

I know it says "Free Version" at the top of the window, but it's still the full version (not a trial).

This program was part of giveawayoftheday, I simply extracted the actual installer from their setup wrapper so that it can still be installed even after the giveaway has expired. Just unzip and run the setup. 

If a key or serial is required it can be found in the readme, along with any additional information you should need.
