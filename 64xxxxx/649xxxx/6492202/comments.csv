,Grensvegter,2011-08-01T13:43Z,"First of all>>> THANKS PIRATE BAY FOR ALL YOUR DOWNLOADS!!!!! Cheers georgefounarakis.
It took me a while to get this game going,(not use to this install). Just extract downloaded file with rar into a game directory and use ""BurnoutParadise.exe"". No mount or burn. Sounds easy enough, but I did'nt know if the game should be installed first. Easiest download yet!"
