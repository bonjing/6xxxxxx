The newly updated and expanded second edition of this acclaimed title covers 32-bit development for all Microsoft(r) Windows platforms, including Windows 2000, using the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). Aimed at developers who wish to capitalize on advances in the MFC for rapid, object-oriented programming, the book delves into MFC basics, progresses to the document/view architecture, then addresses advanced topics including ActiveX(r), OLE, and COM. Author Jeff Prosise once again sets the standard in describing the art of writing MFC-based Windows applications with his clear and comprehensive treatment of concepts and techniques. Readers will discover how to produce incredible functionality with little new code by appropriating MFC code from the class library. They'll also find sample programs and executables on the book's CD-ROM to further fuel their own projects.
