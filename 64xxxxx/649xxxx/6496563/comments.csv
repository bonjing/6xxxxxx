,DMNKLR,2011-08-31T10:12Z,"Just wanted to mention that Amityville 3: The Demon, doesn't work for crap.  You can't watch it decently in any player or streamed over lan/wlan, or thru the web on a server, etc.  It WILL play, but there's no fast forward/rewind, and you have to click on a specific spot for it to start playing.  When streaming from server/pc to another device, you can't do that cuz it freezes up any device trying to read it.  I've not found any way around these issues.  Please, if you can, PLEASE fix the video file and re-upload it, thank you, we'd all appreciate it a lot!"
