Summary:

George and Kathy Lutz are applied in an elegant old house with her three children. The new home is exactly what we have dreamed. But there is one detail, which no one informed them - this house has become the scene of brutal murder.
Eldest son of the Defeo family, former owners, shot in their beds their parents, two brothers and two sisters. He makes full confession to the police and explained that some voices have led him to make terrible crime.
Soon after the occupation of their new owners also began to hear voices. Most they affect the head of the family, George Lutz, who is so much madness that is a deadly threat to their relatives. And only the intervention of the local priest who, having failed to exorcise evil spirits from the house of Kathy advised to leave their homes, prevents the development of events in the worst way.
