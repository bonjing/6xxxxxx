So ill ask here :) What does a blue skull mean? I have a good idea what pink and green are, green being the most trusted correct? and pink is not so well trusted, right? So what does blue mean? Thank you to anyone who teaches me this :) Thanks for the up Hero :) Its always been clean dowloads from hero for me, you should be green if blue isnt higher then green :)"

,gallic10,2011-06-29T03:26Z,"Hero_No_1... Please make sure for you put down ""subtitle: NO or None or N/A"" on the information list at the bottom because I found out this have no subtitle at all while the information at above stated ""Texted Language(s):English"". It's pretty much for being wasted my time. Thank you."
