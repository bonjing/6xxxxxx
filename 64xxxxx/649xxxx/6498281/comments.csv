,sqlife,2011-06-27T09:08Z,"@darkfall666 An HBO TV series episode for free? Commercials cut? Nicely packaged into an .mkv and all you have to do is click download? WTF is EZTV doing?  

Fuck the haters, thank you EZTV."
,mr_foofer,2011-06-27T11:50Z,"EZTV is not the problem.  The asshats from Dimension are.

So do we download this or wait for the PROPER that has to be released after every fucking Dimension rip?"
,gmjh,2011-06-27T12:18Z,Thousands of seeds and peers (or rather leechers). Download speed of almost nothing. Same old story. Wish there was a torrent with a smaller swarm.
,ChaosRoses,2011-06-27T15:14Z,With as many people that are seeding it seems that all the leechers are slowing down the download speed of this Torrent. 
,saturnonostropicos,2011-06-27T17:29Z,wow. down speed below 10 kb/s... too many leechers I guess.
,2toast,2011-06-27T18:32Z,"I just finished watching this episode. It took bloody ages to download!

,Phov,2011-06-27T23:53Z,"Who has bandwidth limit anyways? Losers...
Thanks for the upload! Will seed."
,mr_foofer,2011-06-28T03:35Z,"Sure enough, DIMENSION FUCKED UP.

V:10/A:0

A 2GB HD download with only 2 channel sound.

Way to waste time and bandwidth assholes!  

No sense seeding this shit.  Just download the shitty SD version until a PROPER is made by a group with even the slightest bit of talent."
,Darkfall666,2011-06-28T10:46Z,"I totally have no issue with EZTV. EZTV is awesome. Like mr_foofer said, it's Dimension that has the issue.

That being said, I found the quality fine (I didn't check for only 2 channel audio), but the encoding is all wacked. The file is way too big for a 1 hour episode."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-06-28T16:03Z,"Thank you soooo much!
I love True Blood - if I wanted to watch it on my tv I'd have 2 wait 4 ages."
,zamszowy,2011-07-02T22:06Z,"It's hdtv, but audio is in stereo. Waste of time for me..."
,LanMax,2011-07-10T19:51Z,No problems. Thank you.
,LanMax,2011-07-10T19:52Z,"zamszowy. Wast of time? Well, go up your own then. Stop complaining. Go get HBO. Jack Ass"
,LanMax,2011-07-10T19:55Z,"File Size: As long as we all seed, download will be fast. Hard Drive size? Come on. 2TB drives cost like $50. Pleaaase.  EZTV - Thank you for up and your efforts. "
,firexninja,2012-05-05T01:35Z,thank you!
