The show consists of a panel of four performers who create characters, scenes and songs on the spot, in the style of short-form improvisation games, many taken from theatresports.

Topics for the games were based on either audience suggestions or predetermined prompts from the host, Drew Carey. Carey would set up a game and situation that the performers would improvise.

Carey declared arbitrary point values after each game, often citing a humorous reason for his decision. The points were purely decorative and served no practical purpose.

Carey would reiterate this at the beginning, and multiple times throughout, each episode by describing Whose Line as \\\"the show where everything\\\'s made up and the points don\\\'t matter.\\\"
