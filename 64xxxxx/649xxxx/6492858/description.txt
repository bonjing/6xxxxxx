In this important follow-up to her two CNBC documentaries covering similar territory, journalist Regan profiles cannabis growers, dispensary owners, and the founder of Oaksterdam University ("the first formal school for marijuana in the United States"), as well as cops, legalization opponents, and people who've lost big after making millions. Regan clearly exposes the inconsistencies between state and federal law and the illogical hurdles that make growing even legal medicinal marijuana incredibly risky. Some of her heroes include growers who are willing to be named, pay taxes, and actively embody a challenge to the "stoner" stereotypeâ€”essentially normal people looking to create a family-run business while also advocating for the openness and transparency that could make the industry benefit everyone involved. A particularly illuminating section describes the decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal, which had been suffering from widespread heroin addiction, overcrowded jails, and rising rates of HIV. Since the change in policy, deaths from overdoses dropped considerably, new HIV cases fell, and the number of people seeking treatment doubled. Overall, Regan's first book provides a measured cross-section of what's at stake.
