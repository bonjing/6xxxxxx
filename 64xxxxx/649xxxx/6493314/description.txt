Jo Lemaire is a Belgian artist, who in the late nineties decided to do a tour of the land singing Piaf songs. It was an amazing success, and an album followed. To those who don't know Piaf or find her a bit dated (which is a comment I've received at times) I would strongly recommend Jo's renditions as an introduction. To those who know of and appreciate Piaf I would say: try this on for size, I was moved!

Files are 320 KBPS MP3s ripped with EAC from the original album, tags added with MP3Tag. Sorry, no playlists, I don't use them, nor do I care for them. Here's hoping someone will enjoy this as much as I did.
