,abh1992,2011-06-25T17:12Z,anyone ever been on this server? is it good?
,rogantu,2011-06-25T17:54Z,"yeah it's good, but it is just 2 days old so it needs a ton of people.
this torrent will be put down any momemt because it is too slow with 1 seeder (it will take 100 days for 1 person to be able to play!)
try one of the other wotlk 3.5.5 downloads and join us.

molten has been out for 6 years and is 50% bugged and has hours upon hours of wait time.
this server has less than 10% bugs as far as I've seen after 20 hours+ of gaming.
the reason why this server is so good is because they didn't rush it, they took their time and developed and released it when it was finished."
