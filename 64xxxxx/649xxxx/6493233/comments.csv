,Chuckbattams,2011-07-10T03:06Z,"I'm new to vmware ... but decided it was time to learn a new program, I've downloaded the program, go to install, it gets to the end, and then I get an error box showing %1 installation and it says ""Setup failed to generate SSL keys necessary to run VMware Server.  Click OK to cancel this installation. ... Can someone tell me what I'm to do so I will not receive this in the future as I try to re install. .... Thanks for Your help, if Your able that is :)"
