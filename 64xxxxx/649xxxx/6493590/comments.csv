I am downloading this versus the 13GB torrent that is currently on top due to the fact that a user reported it as MP4 files with bad organization.

This appears well organized, hopefully it is appropriately tagged with ID3 as well, otherwise I will have to do that busywork to make it appropriately playable on my mobile. 

Regardless it is nice to see these in what appears to be a higher quality bitrate. I have them all in a sub 1GB archive and it is kind of difficult to listen to most of the time. Thanks again, namaste! :)"

I expected no less but honestly guys, if you're going to compile and release something like this please have the foresight to appropriately tag the files.

Half of them were tagged with genre of ""blues"" yet no album or track listing, I mean honestly. Put down the cannabis and save your fellow psychonauts some troubles next time :)"
