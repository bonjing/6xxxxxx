Just one question:

The last one was 1.25gb
1.25 GB (305 MB done)
14-06-2011 06:33:20 PM  by BitTorrent/7210
70CA52824D6D718DD13CF6E5026811159961EFEB
641 x 2.00 MB (have 153)

And new one is 973mb... i hope there is not much difference in quality.

also as i remember that you had mentioned uncut in the title, this is the same right ? just curious :)

TYVM"

,btfan13,2012-02-03T21:45Z,People can clearly read here that the photo you posted says DVD at the top of the pic ... meaning that it is indeed released to DVD.
