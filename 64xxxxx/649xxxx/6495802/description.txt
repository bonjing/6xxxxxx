Law is a particularly fruitful means by which to investigate the relationship between religion and state. It is the mechanism by which the Roman state and its European successors have regulated religion, in the twin actions of constraining religious institutions to particular social spaces and of releasing control over such spaces to those orders. This volume analyses the relationship from the late Republic to the final codification of Roman law in JustinianAes Constantinople.
