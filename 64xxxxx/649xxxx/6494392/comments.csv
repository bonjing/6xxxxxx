,hendo666,2011-09-12T18:17Z,"casco67 and this opinion comes from your extensive theological, philosophical and scientific training(your use of vulgarity showing quite clearly that the English language wasnt one of your 'majors' therefore no need to ask). Or is this based on the fact that it is regarded by the unintelligent, intelligent to support an atheistic viewpoint?Atheism is as much a religion as Christianity, and much more dogmatic. A little research should prove to you how laughable it is in comparison to creationsism, there is NO empirical evidence to support it, quite the opposite(leading to the constant need by Atheists to alter there theory)making it unscientific, infact it continues to be debunked on a daily basis, even within the broader Scientific community(outwith biologists who would never express anti evolution sentiment due to the threat it would impose on their livelyhood-see expelled no intelligence allowed for proof)the theory of evolution isnt even regarded as a theory. And this isnt a biased opinion, Ive been full circle, from Christianity to Laveyan Satanism onto Temple of Set philosophy that then lead onto deep study of Hermeticism, Chaos magick, Thelema and Kabbalism(along side Cabbalismand Quabbalism)only to end up right back at Christianity. All the travel did was strengthen my faith in the fact that scripture truely is inspired of God. "
