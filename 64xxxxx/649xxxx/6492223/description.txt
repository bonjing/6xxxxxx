While playing a game seven minutes in heaven at a party in 1985, 10-year-old Chuck Logen (Connor Price) refuses to have sex with a goth girl named Anisha (Sasha Pieterse). In retaliation, Anisha, who apparently practices witchcraft, places a curse on Chuck, so that every single woman he sleeps with will break up with him and marry the next man who asks her out.
