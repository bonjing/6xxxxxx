,waynetevez,2011-06-28T20:53Z,Will this work on a ps3?
,djkpa,2011-06-29T14:32Z,This is NOT the Extended Cut
,versteckt,2011-06-29T23:23Z,"Well I downloaded a version with 1h49m45s playing time and this version has 2h0m30s playing time. I guess this one is extended.

V 10 (can see the grain of the recording)
A 9 (bit soft)"
,versteckt,2011-06-29T23:32Z,"This one is 02:07:30
Others are 01:49:45

V9 (Bit of encoding blur)
A10 (loud and clear)
(ignore my previous post)"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-03T02:07Z,All you guys have problems with reading obviously because the title is Sucker Punch EXTENDED CUT. So everyone that can read doesnt need you people saying its extended or not when it is as clearly titled. Thanks ExtraTorrentRG.
,swampmatt,2011-07-03T03:39Z,"yeah, but is the extension worth it? Sometimes it can turn a good movie into a crappy movie - when they include all the garbage that should have been edited out."
,fallout11,2011-07-10T04:08Z,"Quality rip, V: 9, A:10."
,Yawako,2011-07-18T11:12Z,I downloaded another version but the grains is so unstable I hopes this one fixed it
,niichan,2011-07-22T18:15Z,"Wow, this extended cut actually makes more sense than the version I saw in the movie theatre. The ending has an entire scene with the high roller that is not featured in the 'original' film! :)"
,Acebomb,2011-07-27T00:42Z,"Hey guys im new to this and was wondering if there was a way i can take off the subtitles? 

A-10
V-10

Seeding!!"
,RedPlanetEarth,2011-09-18T20:27Z,Just wondering...how can this be the Extended Cut when it's only 2h 07m? iMDB shows 2h 27m for the Extended Cut and so does my personal retailers...and so does the back cover of the extended movie...
,RedPlanetEarth,2011-09-18T20:33Z,WOW was that a fail of intelligence or what? Please ignore my comment above and sorry for fillin the field.
