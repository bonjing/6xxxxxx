[V],Nepotu,2011-06-28T12:37Z,"You're welcome, Neetoo. Always I will respect a new seeder. The seeder have almost the same importance like the uploader. And always a new seeder is welcome even until now it was only a leecher especially when are only few seeders. The rare things have always a few seeders. I try to upload many more but without you I can't. Who lose? Only you, people."
