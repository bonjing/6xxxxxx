                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Jo Brand investigates the act of crying to find out why people do it and      
 whether it has always been common. She discusses the matter with Phill        
 Jupitus, Shappi Khorsandi and Richard E Grant, and learns more by interviewing
 historians, psychologists and biochemists. There is also a visit to an eye    
 hospital to ensure the comedienne's tear ducts are in working order, before   
 she joins crying drama students and spends time with Princess Diana's         
 psychotherapist Susie Orbach.                                                  
                                 Enjoy!
