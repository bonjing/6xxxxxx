- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -
SUICIDE SILENCE has dominated the metal world since arriving on the scene in 2005.
Almost immediately, the Riverside natives caught fire and became a five-piece
force of destruction, bludgeoning fans across the world with the strength of
their two full-length records. It's now 2011 and the band is gearing up for
its biggest campaign yet. SUICIDE SILENCE will soon be entering the studio with
heavyweight producer Steve Evetts (Dillinger Escape Plan, Every Time I Die,
Hatebreed) to create their most substantial piece of work to date. This summer,
the yet-to-be-titled record aims to redefine heavy and further the band's dominating
force within the extreme metal community.

OTHER INFO:
And now to real business. Today alone (so far) there have been 2 rips
(ourselves and hardlyhxc) released that do not contain
COVERS/ART/BOOKLETS because they are pre retail/advance/promos. This has made
the mp3 scene what it is today, supplying a rip before any other group can.
Even before the new rules were in effect we would supply pics of our discs,
you really think we are faking now?? Cmon. We have been releasing these ever
since we have formed as a group. The new rules do not take this into account,
you can clearly see from the proof pics the cd, case, a paper and my goddamned
dirty carpet. There needs to be a revision rules.
