34 "Night Falls" Rick Morales Amy Wolfram July 15, 2011 693-034 

CÃ©sar and Rex travel to a Mexican village in order to visit the town's abuela. 
But when the sun goes down, Rex's friend is supposedly killed by an E.V.O. It is 
later revealed that Rex's friend was the E.V.O and when the sun goes down he, 
and many other residents, unintentionally transform into wolf-like beasts. 
Things get worse when the mayor hires Hunter Cain (An E.V.O killer from a previous 
episode)and his crew to scare the residents away. Despite this, Cain attempts 
to kill all the residents instead. With the help of Cesar, Rex changes his 
friend's nanites so he can now control his transformation. Cain, now surrounded 
by the wolf E.V.Os, throws a smoke bomb and escapes along with his crew. 
The episode ends with Rex and Cesar both doing toasts. Rex's toast for family 
and Cesar's for a childish nickname Rex called himself when he was little.
