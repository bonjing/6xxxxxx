=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, 
and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s 
story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.
-----------------------------

For those who donâ€™t like anime, youâ€™ll be pleased to hear that this X-Men anime series 
(unlike the Wolverine anime) seems to be staying fairly true to the source material. 
Cyclops, Professor X, Beast, Storm and Wolverine all pretty much look like 
recognizable versions of themselves -- albeit â€œanimetedâ€ -- which, if you think about it, 
isnâ€™t too far from what a lot of American superhero cartoons are doing today 
(see: Wolverine and the X-Men).

[B]Synopsis
-=-=-=-=-=-
 
12  "Destiny - Bond"
----"Destiny - Kizuna" (Destiny-çµ†)  

The episode begins with the newly arrived professor X making a worlwide telepathic broadcast to tell humans, 
mutants and heroes alike to all stand together against the current global crisis, interestingly enough one of 
the heroes we see hearing this broadcast is Captain Britain, an old favourite of mine due to the Extraordinarily 
good run of the hero when Alan Moore and Alan Davies did one of their rare early days team ups to work on his strip 
in The Daredevils and then mighty world of marvel back in the 80's. As Prof X gathers himself to attack the threat 
Dr Sasaki tells him the boy is his own son who she had told him had died. As the X-Men attack Takeo's incredible 
reality warping ability turns  lightning to ice and reflects attacks back upon the attacker. 
The Professor tries to enter Takeo's mind to gain control of his runaway power but cyclops wants to attack the the boy 
while he is mindlocked with the professor, even at the risk of Xaviers life. Charles tries to calm Takeo's mind while 
Hisako recalls their childhood friendship and tries to remind him of it as well, will they succeed in breaking through 
to him and save the world?...
