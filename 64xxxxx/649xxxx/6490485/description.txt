X-Men: The Official Game is Activision's tie-in video game to the 2006 film X-Men: The Last Stand.
The game covers the events of the films X2: X-Men United and X-Men: The Last Stand, specifically
following the characters of Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler.
It also bridges the gap between the two films,explaining why Nightcrawler is not present for The Last Stand,
and also introduces new foes to the X-Men film canon, such as HYDRA.

Players control the actions of several X-Men related characters, most notably Wolverine,
Nightcrawler, and Iceman, as they uncover a plot to eradicate mutants. 
Sometimes, another X-Man will help the player's character battle.
