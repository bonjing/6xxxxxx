[b]Note:[/b]
I now have permission to up these releases with the cappers own tag
rather than having to re encode them and use mine so ty to TopTr00per 
for capping these episodes and for permission to up them as torrents. 
Visit TT's torrent list on demonoid for more cartoon's series he's 
capped ahead of US air dates including scooby doo and penguins iof madagascar.
I'm adding this to demonoid as an externally tracked torrent as I do not want to duplicate TT's
own torrent but I post my torrents on multiple sites and it would be a shame to exclude demonoid users 
from accessing it.
