Buke & Gass is an experimental indie rock duo from Brooklyn, NY, that made its
recording debut in 2009. Founded in 2008, the band is comprised of
multi-instrumentalists Aron Sanchez and Arone Dyer, the latter formerly a member
of the band Proton Proton. The band's name is derived from two experimental
instruments created by the bandmembers: the buke, played by Dyer, is something
of an electrified six-string ukulele while the gass, played by Sanchez, is
something of a cross between a guitar and bass (guitar-bass, g-ass, gass -- get
it?). Buke & Gass made their recording debut in 2009 with +/-, a self-released
seven-track mini-album.
