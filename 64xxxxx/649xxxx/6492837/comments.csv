,Finalreminder,2011-06-25T16:07Z,"Indeed, thanks for this mini-series"
,rickk1,2011-06-26T00:29Z,"could not play 1 and 3   2 was ok
fyi"
,rickk1,2011-06-26T00:42Z,"could not play 1 and 3  , 2 ok"
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T15:49Z,"They all play ok at my end. I suspect your PC is too slow.
They're all encoded with AVC High at Level 3.1 which should play on Atom Netbooks.
720p HD uses High at Level 4.1
CPU Usage is about half of what 720p needs.
To test I used VLC 1.1.7 and MPC-HC 1.5.1.2903 along with ffdshow rev3851 plus Haali 1.11.96.14
VLC gives the lowest CPU usage.
MPC-HC gives the smoothest playback.
Should also play under KMPlayer and GOM without a problem but I haven't tested these."
,rickk1,2011-06-26T19:17Z,"i tried VLC  and only 2 played and 2 was the only one I could convert the other 2 (1&3) could not convert. is MPC- HC a program?

thanks for info"
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T21:38Z,"As you haven't heard of MPC-HC I assume you might be a MAC user.

To play CABAC encoded x264 you need to use the ffmpeg-mt on a multi-threaded CPU.

If you are a MAC user try the Apple MPlayerX - it uses the ffmpeg-mt decoder. This is the multi-threaded version of libavcodec.

If you search for ""Apple MPlayerX"" on the Google site you'll find the player on Apples site.

If you're using a PC try searching ""MPC-HC"" on Googles site. If you want software playback then you'll also need ffdshow-tryouts and maybe the Haali splitter if you don't want to use the built-in splitter in MPC-HC.

You can also get all the stuff from x264.nl"
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T21:40Z,If you're using a single threaded CPU stick to using libavcodec - it's better suited for slower single threaded CPU's but it's not as good as ffmpeg-mt for CABAC encoded 264 video.
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T21:44Z,"Try googling ""MPC-HC"".
Also take a look here: x264.nl
Also lookup ffdshow-tryouts and Haali."
,rickk1,2011-06-27T00:27Z,"thanks for all the info.
I have PC .
What I do is download then convert with a program  and play on my DVD player.
I will try to download 1 and 3 again maybe something went wrong. I did it with #2 no problem but the other two I could not convert.(error)
