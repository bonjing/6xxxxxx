Quote:
Cole Gibson is haunted by vivid and terrifying nightmares that cripple his career and alienate his family. He soon discovers his dreams are merely doorways into a separate, hidden level of reality populated by beings beyond imagining. The menacing forces lurking in this realm crave one prize above all - Cole Gibson's soul.
