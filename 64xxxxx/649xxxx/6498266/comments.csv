,Starcaler,2011-07-11T16:05Z,"Your comment is pointless. You left no details, and nothing for anyone else to help you. Did you DC from the net when you installed and registered? Did you BLOCK it from the net WHILE you were DCd from the net? Hell maybe you did enter it wrong, or maybe you just plain fail. Idk... you dont give us anything to go on in your ""comment"" so we can try and help you"
,UnviolentPeacemaker,2011-07-21T01:36Z,"My need was to Password Protect 500GB USB Drives - portable.  Nice design, I guess, but I found it very confusing, EXTREMELY SLOW - 10 min a gigabyte or something, ERROR PRONE - it lost one of my folders - Gone - ERASED.  AND, being from the USB Secure folks, my guess is they'd have busted the license - ""trial expired"" ""uninstall.""  

STORAGECRYPT, here on PirateBay - AWESOME.  As fast as USB Secure, as simple, as easy...  STORAGECRYPT STORAGECRYPT...!!!

If I find problems, I'll let you know."
