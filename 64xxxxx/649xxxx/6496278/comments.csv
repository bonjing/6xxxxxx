wait for some more time to get this movie in good hindi audio.."
,zdude555,2011-07-12T21:44Z,Please learn to post samples so people can judge if the movie you upload has a good or crap quality. Apparently the hindi audio is cam & you have not mentioned it anywhere. That is very sneaky of you. REALLY BAD. -1
