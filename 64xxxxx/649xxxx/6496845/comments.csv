,SgtSposh,2011-06-27T00:19Z,"@Torx

I already said the KelSat works fine


@clemlenain

tell me why I should lie ? do I get archievments by spreading rumors or what ? It used to be  just NOW by downloading exactly this Trainer from EXACTLY this site and it was like this before because the mirrors they use are not that serious and I could mirror their files easely by myself without any serious checking upon me and restricting in changes made from op of the files in any way... "
,SgtSposh,2011-06-27T00:30Z,"dont wanna troll but to all ppl who use brewers rlses or  h4x0rÂ´s trainers.. pls keep in mind that the most of the top level coders working on a payroll so they decide wich supplier has the right to supply those  files... inside this chain u just will be fine dling those stuff even if u just dl, but outside on a 3rd level supply will be always a sidekick and always a scriptkiddie believe me"
,dantilus,2011-06-27T04:25Z,"All of the trainers ive downloaded have some type of crypt trojan on them ,,i dont know if thats a false reading because of the trainers code but im not taking any chances and delete them"
,dantilus,2011-06-27T04:30Z,this one also has a trojan in it . dont download it
,artylon2,2011-06-27T18:24Z,"Many trainers has false positives from some anti-virus applications. This doesn't equal that the trainer is infected.

An easy way to detect if the reading is a false positive is to google the name of the trojan/virus/keylogger. If it is called something like Gen.Trojan or Gen.Keylogger it is often a false positive.

I've personally downloaded trainers from GCW for as long as they've exisited and NEVER had a trojan or virus from their site. Since they check the uploads before publishing it on the site."
,brianxxx,2011-06-30T17:53Z,"A +1 trainer really? Why did they even waste the time?

And the trainers at GameCopyWorld are clean. Almost all trainers these days get flagged as virus, etc because of how they operate. Only fucktards with no knowledge think the false positives are viruses.

If in doubt, run it under Sandbox or VMWARE...remove..then scan for viruses. You will only find a virus if there was legit infection. 

Also, only download from trusted sites like GCW or TPB and only from VIPs here. And always test in virtual environments first."
