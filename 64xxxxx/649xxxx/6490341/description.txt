And came up with .. THE VERY BEST PUNK ROCK SONGS â€¦EVER   I know this is going to cause controversy , especially among the guys from the U.S.  Cause this is mainly the British groups from late 70â€™s to early eighties .Itâ€™s just my personal favourites . I made a front and back cover for it , find it in the folder. They are all ready to burn to cd .  Steevo-be-thy-name . Enjoy.
