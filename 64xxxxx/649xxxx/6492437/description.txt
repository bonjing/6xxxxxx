One of the best WW II games from SSI. In this game you even can choose to play as the Nazis. The gamefield consist of smaller hexagon-pieces (like Settlers of Catan :) ) on which you can move you infantry, ships, tank, missile installations, etc. Gameplay has been made easy because of use of the mouse.

Keep in mind that this game probably only works with DOSBox; an emulator for the DOS games.

didnÂ´t had the time to test this all time classic with dosbox atm so it would be nice if someone could approve if it works in the comments... ty/SgtS
