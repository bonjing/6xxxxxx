Whether you call it a harmonica, a mouth harp, or even by the antique term "mouth organ," one thing is for certain - few bluesmen could blow that thing like John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson. It was Williamson who revolutionized the way that harmonica was used in the blues, elevating the humble instrument to lead status and opening the door for a raft of followers, including Sonny Boy Williamson II, Little Walter, and Junior Wells, among many others.
Born in Jackson, Tennessee, Williamson taught himself the harmonica as a child, influenced by great players like Will Shade and Hammie Nixon from nearby Memphis. By the time that he had reached his teens, he was already a master of the instrument. Using the name "Sonny Boy" Williamson, he traveled during the depression, performing with artists like Robert Nighthawk and Sleepy John Estes.
By the time that Williamson arrived in Chicago in 1934, he was a seasoned performer, already stretching the boundaries of harmonica playing. His use of his hands and his imaginative fills fit well into the growing "urban" style of blues, increasing the level of expression the instrument could bring to a song. Williamson's call-and-response method of alternating vocals with instrumental verses has become a blues standard.
