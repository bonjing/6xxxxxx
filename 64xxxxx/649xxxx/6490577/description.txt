Moom allows you to easily move and zoom windows to predefined areas of the screen, or to make them full-screen, using either the mouse or the keyboard.

When used via the mouse, all you need to do is hover over the green resize button in any Mac OS X window. Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.

When used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.

System Requirements:

Intel Mac OS X.6.6 or later
