Not since The Elegance of the Hedgehog has a book arrived in America from Europe on such wings of critical praise and popularity. The Vanishing of Katharina Linden is an unforgettable debut - at once chilling and endearing, haunting and richly insightful - the story of one girlâ€™s big heart and even bigger imagination, and of a world full of mystery, good, and evil.

It isnâ€™t ten-year-old Piaâ€™s fault that her grandmother dies in a freak accident. But tell that to the citizens of Piaâ€™s little German hometown of Bad MÃ¼nstereifel, or to the classmates who shun her. The only one who still wants to be her friend is StinkStefan, the most unpopular child in school.

But then something else captures the communityâ€™s attention: the vanishing of Katharina Linden. Katharina was last seen on a float in a parade, dressed as Snow White. Then, like a character in a Grimmâ€™s fairy tale, she disappears. But, this being real life, she doesnâ€™t return.

Pia and Stefan suspect that Katharina has been spirited away by the supernatural. Their investigation is inspired by the instructive - and cautionary - local legends told to them by their elderly friend Herr Schiller, tales such as that of Unshockable Hans, visited by witches in the form of cats, or of the knight whose son is doomed to hunt forever.

Then another girl disappears, and Pia is plunged into a new and unnerving place, one far away from fairy tales - and perilously close to adulthood.
