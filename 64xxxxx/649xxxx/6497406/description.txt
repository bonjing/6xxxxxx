Beginnings - DVDs

Eric Hovind continues his father Kent\'s amazing ministry with this professional set of informative DVDs

It\'s time to start your journey through Beginnings, the curriculum that will educate, entertain, and prepare you for the most pressing topic of our dayâ€”creation versus evolution! Join Eric Hovind for six fascinating sessions:

Session 1: They\'re Both Religions
Is evolution science or religion? Nothing about evolution belongs in the category of science.

Session 2: How Old Is It?
Do we really know that the earth is ancient? The truth is that the evidence points strongly to a young earth.
    
Session 3: It Was Good
Did man really live to be hundreds of years old before the flood? What about dinosaurs and giant men? Why is there suffering? Creationism accounts for all of this.

Session 4: Dinosaurs With Man
Evidence for dinosaurs in modern history is abundant. Historical and Biblical records substantiate the theory that dinosaurs lived with man.

Session 5: Fact vs. Faith
Perspective determines everything. Facts are absolute, but interpretation changes with the individual.
    
Session 6: The Truth
Some things are self-evidently true. Atheistic Evolutionists have to deny logic itself in order to argue against such obvious truth.

Beginnings is a creation experience for small groups, churches, and individuals from all walks of life. Creation Speaker, Eric Hovind, explores the age-old questions of life, the evidence for a young earth, and how dinosaurs fit in with the Bible. The included guide provides an introduction to each lesson, creative challenges, great discussion questions, and practical ways to apply each lesson to everyday life!
