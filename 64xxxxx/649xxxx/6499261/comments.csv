[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-06-28T10:26Z,well other than private trax -what else do you suggest to stop the hit & runs & the amount of people not uppin at all?
,badbessie123,2011-06-28T19:38Z,"Im set to give max upload speed. i always give more than i get, however i do get your point I dont know what to do with hit and runs. Thanks for the up. WOOF,WOOF"

[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-06-29T13:50Z,Fully upped now anyway-yeh its a pain in the neck-the first torrent clients you couldnt do much with but utorrent is so good now that many simply stop uppin altogether & simply leave it like that.lookin at a seedbox to be honest.I like the speeds of private trax but dont like the regime that run em if ya know what i mean. Thanx for the alternate  D/L espurious :)
