THE COLOURISED VERSION OF THE 1933 CLASSIC -KING KONG.

THE FILM WAS CUT IN SEVERAL PLACES AS IT WAS DEEMED TOO SCARY,PLUS IN THE CURRENT 

CLIMATE THEY DIDNT WANT AMERICAN SAILORS TO DIE ON SCREEN -THAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED 

LADS FROM SIGNING UP TO JOIN THE WAR EFFORT IN EUROPE.THIS HAS MANY SCENES CUT 

BACK IN,INCLUDING THE SAILORS ON THE RAFT-THE EATING OF THE ISLAND INHABITANTS,THE 

CRUSHING OF INHABITANTS-PLUS THE WORST ONE -KONG TOUCHES WRAY & SMELLS HIS FINGERS-

WHICH IS NOTHIN NOW,BUT WAS SEEN AS RISQUE IN 1933

THIS IS NOT DIGITAL COLOURISATION,THIS WAS DONE IN 1972 THE HARD WAY-FRAME BY 

FRAME!MANY CLASSICS NEVER SAW THIS AT ALL,SOME SHERLOCK HOLMES FILMS,FEW 

MUSICALS.BUT MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS,SIT IN TIN CANS AWAITING ATTENTION......


PLEASE SEED SO OTHERS CAN FEED.DONT HIT & RUN YOU RUIN IT FOR EVERYONE.DOESNT 

HURT,COST OR AFFECT YOU TO SEED BACK AT ALL.CHEERS
