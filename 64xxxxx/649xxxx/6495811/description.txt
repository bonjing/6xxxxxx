Over the last decades the incidence of skin cancers is dramatically increasing world-wide. This is not only confined to the incidence of melanoma but includes also other skin cancers such as basal cell carcinomas. Based on the recent WHO classification of skin cancers, this lavishly illustrated reference book covers comprehensively the epidemiology, histology and pathology, as well as diagnostic signs and treatment options of skin cancers. Homogenously and reader-friendly structured, it links the diagnostic and genetic features of each disease in order to guide the reader to the most appropriate therapeutic strategies for the best possible treatment outcome. In order to demonstrate the world wide activities in the field, all chapters cover the variations of the individual experiences and expertise in different nations.
