|   A lonely teenager sits on a couch, watching the TV and zapping with his    |
|   remote. He's just gamed his fingers to death with his new Xbox. His        |
|   parents try to talk him out of his lazy habitual lifestyle. He does not    |
|   respond. They try again, but he ignores them no matter what, his eyes      |
|   blank and still staring straight at the electronical screen before him.    |
|   Eventually his parents just give up, leaving him to wallow in his own      |
|   self-absorbed terrible way of living.                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   This is the picture of youth Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree sketches in   |
|   the opening track of his latest release, Fear Of A Blank Planet. His       |
|   decidedly haunting lyrical poetics set the tone for what now already is    |
|   about to become one of the best albums of the year, not in the least       |
|   because of the strengths of this album, which lie where they have always   |
|   lain for this band: the invoking of atmosphere and a sense of              |
|   psychedelia, layered with thick bass lines, complex drum patterns and      |
|   melodic guitar riffs.                                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   The aforementioned riffs are definitely what make the atmosphere on this   |
|   album. Wilson chugs out riffs that are louder, darker, more atmospheric,   |
|   harder, just overall more evil than they usually are. Aided by some        |
|   cutting edge lyrics of angst and harsh social criticism interwoven in      |
|   the songs, the album's moods range from melancholy to raging to            |
|   clinically depressed. This is the first Porcupine Tree outing ever that    |
|   I have seen that has gone full throttle on the dark side of life like      |
|   this. The whole disc retains this atmosphere due to the lyrical content    |
|   of the album being themed around one thing: the sorry state of youth. It   |
|   is a miserable ride through destroyed teenage lives all the way            |
|   through.                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   And his riffs are not just atmospheric or moody. They can be plain         |
|   monstrous at times. If you have been impressed by Opeth or Dream Theater   |
|   riffs, just wait till you hear the musical orgasm that is Anesthetize.     |
|   Containing all the core elements of the PT sound in one seventeen minute   |
|   plus epic, it begins in a psychedelic mood more reminiscent of Pink        |
|   Floyd with too much mellotron-esque feel. It slowly moves on and on,       |
|   until it breaks into a middle part which shows a panorama of metal riffs   |
|   that would make Mikael Akerfeldt accuse Wilson of blatant plagiarism,      |
|   that's just how badass and evil this piece is. And it's not just Wilson    |
|   who shines on here. The band brought in Alex Lifeson (yes, the famous      |
|   Rush guitarist), who delivers a top-notch guitar solo in the song, and     |
|   additionally, Gavin Harrison's drumming is just jaw-dropping. It's         |
|   incredibly tight too; when at the eleven-minute-mark Wilson throws open    |
|   the guitar sound full throttle it sounds like all hell breaks loose, but   |
|   due to the drumming not a second of this outburst of violence can be       |
|   regarded as misplaced. To put it in one word: astounding.                  |
|                                                                              |
|   Next to Anesthetize and the title track, which show some of the heavy      |
|   sides of the band, Porcupine Tree know that they are not a complete all    |
|   -out metal band destined to kick your ass. They let down the tempo on      |
|   two tracks. While My Ashes is a decidedly dodgy ballad in the sense that   |
|   it tries to be Trains, but fails, Sentimental is a more than adequately    |
|   upgraded version of Lazarus. A great ballad that allows you a breather     |
|   in between two of the heaviest tracks of the band's impressive             |
|   catalogue. As Wilson croons out how he doesn't want to really go           |
|   anywhere and sees that he can't blame his parents for his mistakes, he     |
|   inadvertently conveys the message of hopelessness and emptiness that       |
|   besets the whole album.                                                    |
|                                                                              |
|   He follows that up with the plainly disturbing Way Out Of Here, which      |
|   begins with a soundscape from another guest (Robert Fripp of King          |
|   Crimson fame), but also turns out to have some lyrics that would make      |
|   Cobain's sense of angst hide in fear of being called a wuss. Especially    |
|   the verses are heartbreaking and flow along so nicely with the             |
|   atmosphere of fear and anxiety that once again weaves its threads all      |
|   through the song. It may be best illustrated by an example:                |
|                                                                              |
|   "I can't take the staring and the sympathy                                 |
|   And I don't like the questions:                                            |
|   "How do you feel?"                                                         |
|   "How's it going at school?"                                                |
|   "Do you wanna talk about it?"                                              |
|                                                                              |
|   The prime example of an alienated teenager right here folks, and without   |
|   a mention of self-harming activities. We don't need explicit imagery to    |
|   show us how just how messed up we actually are. Just an insight into a     |
|   troubled mind refusing to answer to the essential questions of life will   |
|   do, and excellently at that.                                               |
|                                                                              |
|   The album ends on a decent note with Sleep Together, which comprises the   |
|   end. It's not bad by any means, but here I have the feeling that it's      |
|   something I've already seen before, but the chorus more than makes up      |
|   for it; even if Porcupine Tree are not going to get a gold star for        |
|   originality they will at least obtain an award for sheer consistency and   |
|   class.                                                                     |
|                                                                              |
|   So if you are ready for a ride through the dark side of the adolescent     |
|   mind, spend your bucks on this baby, and sit back and enjoy. Steven        |
|   Wilson and companions have no doubt created the album of the year with a   |
|   deftly crafted, varied, yet continuously haunting at atmospheric disc      |
|   that will leave you begging for repeat plays for weeks after and           |
|   continually referencing when dealing with teenage angst. Just one last     |
|   warning: if you're not down with modern metal, this album just may be a    |
|   little too much to digest. Nevertheless the lyrical concept and the        |
|   atmospheres still ring true in a world which just exemplifies the stage    |
|   the band subtly sets. Ergo, I still believe this could be a timeless       |
|   album due to its relevancy, and I recommend you pick this up first thing   |
|   in the morning. [jorn van schaik, sputnikmusic]                            |
