,kendrypire,2011-06-24T20:15Z,"900 sedders"" 4500 leechers"" this take one life to download.. but quality look very clear."
,mythosaz,2011-06-25T04:41Z,"First, extremezone, thank you AGAIN for a fantastic release.  I look forward to and trust your excellent uploads.

That said, SERIOUSLY, nobody wants split-CD releases.  Whatever sort of scene code you're following is archaic.  Is someone afraid of getting nuked from some sort of top-movies site?  Is it 1999 again?

I'll fast-join the two parts and move on with my life, but it is getting old."
,RoadRash6669,2011-06-25T08:01Z,Will you be able to get Hoodwinked too and Cars2...?

However, I have been downloading for years and have never received any kind of notice from my ISP (Cox). After this download was complete, I got an email stating I was infringing on copyright laws, so just be careful TPB'ers. "

,girlie90,2012-03-19T06:11Z,"so i love this movie but i was a little disappointed. . . I also LOVE fear n loathing in las vegas n this movie has a couple references to it.  i was really sad when they were running through the canyon w the bats n no one said ""dont stop here were in bat country!"" like my fav part of fear n loathing. i cried a little. "
,vampiregod74,2012-05-23T16:41Z,"@ girlie90.... people just have to bitch about something. this movie is awesome and still you complain about something you got for free. If you wanna watch Fear and Loathing fucking download it instead of bitching that there aren't enough references to it in this kids movie. 
@matter0ni..... Get a real ISP and you wont get those emails. I have been doing this for years and never got a single email like that except when i had COX shitty ass cable ISP. 
ANYWAY>>>> a/10 v/10... GREAT MOVIE..."
