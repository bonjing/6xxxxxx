For those folks with SLOW(like xDSL) ISP online connection

if you have any qestions about the game it better be asked on official forum  at http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/categories/show/187.page (main page, and registration is MAYBE reqired(dont know))

for those who stuck with install process read nfo file(open with notepad etc.)



Brief description of update:

not much added since last revision update, some cars, some events, about 100 megabytes of game data(in camparsion with that "high resolution textures of tracks" with is near 1GB in size). I've uploaded last version of launcher and rewrite a nfo up a little.

About that "boosthack" or "speedhack":

first of all, it's not fair. Especially to those pepole who have spend REAL money in the game. second. Profiles are stored on two servers(europe and north usa) and users (who play the game) have only local copyes of theese profiles cant cheat, because server checks clients and if profile are cheated resend the safe copy, to get cheated u need BOTH server and client hanve modified profiles and on server side it impossibe to cheat.

as usual you can mail me at xb-0@yandex.ru or even get friends at facebook:


Stay tuned, and happy hunting! ]:)
