,csimmons22,2012-05-05T16:26Z,"GREAT TORRENT! Very good quality. BUT... Can anyone re-seed this? Just for a few minutes? I've been stuck at 99.2% for a week now. There are only 9 incomplete files out of 125. We have (as of this writing) 14 other folks who are anxiously waiting for the last few bits. If we can just the last few pieces, I'll keep my seed up for several weeks, making sure everyone who wants it can get it. Thanks!"
