This title organizes computational probability methods into a systematic treatment. The book examines two categories of problems. "Algorithms for Continuous Random Variables" covers data structures and algorithms, transformations of random variables, and products of independent random variables. "Algorithms for Discrete Random Variables" discusses data structures and algorithms, sums of independent random variables, and order statistics.
