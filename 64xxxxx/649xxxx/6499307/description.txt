The clichÃ© is to get successful, get money, get chicks, get drugs, and get arrested. Lose everything. Get a tattoo, get a facelift, get a new direction, get a book deal about recovery, and get Jesus. Be welcomed back as a role model.
Texas blues troubadour Hadden Sayers didnâ€™t follow the usual script. His tribulations werenâ€™t the result of personal demons. He didnâ€™t call on a team of slick advisors and publicists to resuscitate his career. He didnâ€™t look for reality shows, sex tapes, or reunion tours to make an easy buck. Hadden Sayers knew that sometimes an honest dollar is a hard dollar.
Blues power guitarist Hadden Sayers has bent more strings to earn a Hard Dollar than most and his music proves it. Tough to the point of indestructible, yet pliant and vulnerable when required, it is the story of a man who has hit lifeâ€™s roadblocks head on and emerged unbowed and unbroken. Best of all, like all great art that tells the truth, it could be everyoneâ€™s story. With his road-tested combo of Tony McClung (drums), Mark Frye (bass, Fender Rhodes) and Dave DeWitt (Hammond B-3, Wurlitzer and piano) sharp as mesquite cactus, Sayers has penned 13 numbers guaranteed to bring his career good luck.
