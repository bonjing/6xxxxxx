,mafaso,2011-09-04T05:50Z,"Where/How do we download the ENTIRE DVD just as if we bought it off the shelf. I want all the extras (commentary, out takes, language selection, bloopers, etc.) Basically a copy of the DVD as if I bought it off the shelf (which I can't where I am at). It always seems the only files posted on these torrent  sites are just the movie (and sometimes the subtitles). Any help? THX"
