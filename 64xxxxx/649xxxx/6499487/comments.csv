If you're at all interested in cooking, watch Masterchef Australia, instead."

,Bean-Bandit,2012-02-23T11:53Z,The Humming sound was really getting on my nerves. If these weren't episodes that you made then it's who ever you got it from that's a real idiot cause a entire season with this damn humming. But as you said you can't find any of these so.
