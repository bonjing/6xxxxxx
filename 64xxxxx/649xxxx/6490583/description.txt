Replacing his search for dignity with a search for true love, Canadian comedy favourite Spencer Rice (Kenny vs Spenny) returns to Showcase Television with Single White Spenny, a comedy of relationship errors.

Spenny struggles to find love, be loved, get love, rent love, buy love, steal love, melt love and sell love. From trying his hand at an open relationship to seeking motherly love that was lacking from his real Mom, Spenny navigates single life with an ineptitude all his own.
