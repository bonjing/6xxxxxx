I believe there are two kinds of cock rock. On one end, there is wild riffage
fit for jungle expeditions, skin-tight leather, and stadium seating. And then
there is the dive bar sort. ItÂ’s a grittier experience and usually involves
swashbuckling over the cheapest beer in the house, intimate howling from the
leading man, and a parade of crunchy (but still just as wild) shredding. Both
varieties provoke images of steamy men and sexy mic poses. When The Gay Blades
start off their full-length Ghosts with Â“O Shot,Â” a sassy and abrasive
guitar-centered piece, my latter version of c-rock is already starting up for a
retro surf rock-like whiplash. IÂ’m thinking itÂ’s going to be a night for the
ages ... if I can remember the next morning.

And then Ghosts takes it to a whole new level, a level TGB like to call Â“trash
pop.Â” Apparently, Â“trash pop is what happens two keenly observant wannabe
hipsters write songs the same pair couldnÂ’t possibly pull off live and make up
for their missing bass player with consistent TNT like performances and a
heaping spoonful of swagger.Â” There is more swagger and attitude on Ghosts than
most bands could handle, and this is what sets TGB apart from any other similar
effort. Some songs bring on a bluesy ballad (Â“Prologue For The Pure Of HeartÂ”),
some songs take on poppier rock with capturing melodies (Â“N.H.D.N.Â”), and some
could even fill out the score of RENT (Â“Dog Day AfternoonÂ”). TGBÂ’s in-your-face
rock is always cool, always impressively arranged, and always entertaining.

For only two dudes, Clark Westfield and Puppy Mills output a HUGE product. With
transitions, textures and elements to spare, these are not simple rock songs,
even though they do simply rock. A song on Ghosts can hang a left turn at any
moment, and none of these jumps are unfortunate. As spazzy as the album is on a
whole, I am never lost in the mix. I think this has to do with
guitarist/vocalist Westfield. He gives off an eager and emotional energy that
matches the mood of the moment. Â“Robots Fuck Your Shit UpÂ” begins
self-reflecting and worried. Background vocals kick in with some kosher bah bahs
towards the end, and Westfield reacts with a more confident croon-yell
syndicate. When the guitars are anxious, so is Westfield. When the song is
silly, so is Westfield. When the vibes are flirtatious, Westfield is unbuttoning
his shirt. And when Westfield wants a sing-along on Â“Why CanÂ’t I Grow A Beard,Â”
he fucking gets one. Ghosts is a hotbed of complexities, and this is from a band
that doesnÂ’t even have a real bass player.

A common problem I have with gritty pop bands: their work is either
over-produced, leaving out the good smut, or under-produced and the sound
equivalent to muddy water. Ghosts is a fit arrangement of both slick and raw
tones. The final straw of satisfaction comes with sharp song titles like my
personal favorite, Â“YouÂ’re A Garbage Barge, IÂ’m A Dream Boat.Â” There is an
underlying (and sometimes obvious) absurdity/quirkiness on Ghosts that is part
ridiculous and part brilliance. Besides being indie rock that actually rocks,
The Gay Blades keep it fun. And thatÂ’s something you can take beyond the dive
bar.
