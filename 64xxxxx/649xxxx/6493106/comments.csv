,DragonLady6977,2011-07-10T08:05Z,THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!! This is an awesome movie. I did see  a scene that my husband is in at 50:06-50:35 He is the tarot card reader with the candle on his table. Also the street performer with the gold face makeup is a friend of mine Ursaline Burgundy. He has won several state & national drag competitions.
