Notrium is a realtime single player survival game. You have crashed on a strange planet filled with aliens. You have crash-landed on planet Notrium. Your food supplies are running low, a pack of predatory aliens have got your scent. There are no more bullets for your pistol, your only weapon a handful of rocks. The night is coming, and you are desperately looking for wood to make a fire.

Notrium is a game of survival. To survive you must find edible food, build up your base, create weapons and bullets, and fight all sorts of enemies ranging from robots to alien queens. You find alien items on the planet surface which you can combine with others to make all sorts of useful gadgets and weapons. You have a vast randomly generated planet to explore, and there are multiple paths to victory.

Notrium can be completed in several different ways, and it has a high replay value.
