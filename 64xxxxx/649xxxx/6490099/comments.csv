,Kissen11,2012-01-06T14:50Z,"I hope anyone could help me with an issue.
I've downloaded and tried a lot of different Dirt 3 uploads and there's no problem installing and get them to work.
The problem is that they freezes every 4-5 seconds when I play. So I can't really play it.
I've tried all sorts of cracks and patches and it still don't work. Lower grafics and so on like someone mentioned. It can't be the computer cos I have an i7 2600K, GTX 580 and 8gb ram with all the latest drivers. For example, Battlefield 3 and all the other latest games runs flawless on highest grafics.
Any suggestions?
Thank's for the upload! "
