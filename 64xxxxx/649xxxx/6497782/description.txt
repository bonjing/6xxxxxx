Extremly odd and demanding music...

"The centerpiece of the album is the appropriately titled "Stagger On", an approximately 22 minute exercise of percussive instrumentation like you've never heard. Kotche combines both acoustic and electronic percussion, and on this piece, help from cellist Chris Tesluk. From a stark beginning, "Stagger On" works its way up to what seem like infinite layers of surprisingly melodic texture, only to be torn down again and rebuilt with amnesia in regards to the previous melody. The other three tracks, "Cheju", "Wading Pool", and "Mask", are relatively low key and at times, ethereal and meditative, but always delectably cerebral".
