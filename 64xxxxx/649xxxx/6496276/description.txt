AFL 2011 Round 09
Carlton Blues v Geelong Cats
Friday 20 May 2011, 7.40pm
Etihad Stadium
Official Attendance: 48,429


Round 9 kicked off at Etihad Stadium on Friday night with the match of the round between 1st and 4th on the ladder. Geelong, coming off a 3 point win last Friday night against reigning premiers Collingwood, faced another big game against reigning Browlow Medalist Chris Judd's Carlton who had the bye last week. Geelong's new coach Chris Scott has a perfect 7-0 start to his AFL coaching career and is up against Carlton's coach Brett Ratten, who is looking to win a finals game for a pass mark this year, and whose stocks would rise with a win against Geelong and would put the rest of the competition on notice. Could this game rival last weeks Cats v Magpies clash? Would that be too much to ask? Watch and find out.
