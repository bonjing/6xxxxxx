Great show!"
,azper,2011-06-27T01:29Z,"Hey, I like it! Little hard to keep up with the legal lingo at times, gotta rewind alot. Very cool and rewarding if you give it attention.
Have a feeling that these slick suit dudes are gonna be turning into pussies in the recent future.
Looks promising!"

,AndroidLove,2011-07-01T12:45Z,"Am really liking this show. If you liked Ari Gold from Entourage then you should definitely like this as it's like a lot of Ari Gold's in different forms. 
That said, they're all definitely not as good as Ari Gold's character/performance.
But for a first episode pilot, really grips you in.
Have watched so many pilots and even some series after watching two or three episodes patiently, it still doesn't hook you in.
This one does! Good stuff - thanks to the uploader!"
