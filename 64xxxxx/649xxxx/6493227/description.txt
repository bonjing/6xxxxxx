The Christians are a musical ensemble from Liverpool, England, who had several UK and
international chart hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s

The Christians was The Christians 1987 debut album and contained their first five UK hit
singles: [Forgotten Town], [Hooverville], [When the Fingers Point], [deal World] and [Born
Again]

The name of the band refers to the surname of the three brothers that were originally in the
line-up, and is also coincidentally guitarist Henry Priestman's middle name.

Garry Christian (born 27 February 1965, Liverpool) (lead vocals), Roger Christian (born 13
February 1950 - died 8 March 1998 from brain tumour) (vocals, instrumentalist), Russell
Christian (born 8 July 1956) (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), and Henry Priestman (born
Henry Christian Priestman, 21 July 1955, in Kingston upon Hull, brought up in Liverpool)
(keyboards, guitars, vocals) formed the band in 1985. Because of a reluctance to tour, Roger
left in 1987.

The band were one of a number of soul-influenced groups in the 1980s that had strong links
to UK punk rock, New Wave music and post-punk. The band's frontman and lead singer
Garry Christian became the groups unique selling point with his distinctive look and velvetsmooth
soulful tones.

In Rock: The Rough Guide, one critic, Charles Bottomley, described the band as â€œThe
Temptations in ripped jeans, producing gritty-centred songs in a sugary vocal shell

The original members of the Christians were: Garry Christian - lead vocals, Henry Priestman -
keyboards/ vocals, Russell Christian - saxophone/ vocals, Paul Barlow - drums, Mike Bulger -
guitar/ vocals, Roger Christian - keyboards/ vocals (deceased) and Tony Jones - bass
