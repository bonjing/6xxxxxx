Gypsies by Robert Charles Wilson

Karen White, her sister Laura and brother Tim were all born with a gift - the ability to open doorways between worlds. It\'s an ability she has long suppressed, partly due to the warnings (and accompanying beatings) given to her by her adoptive father as well as the memories of a haunting figure, The Grey Man, who seems associated with the siblings use of their powers.

But all this is many years behind her, as is any contact with her power-sharing brother and sister. Karen is now a middle-aged and soon to be divorced mother of teenage Michael.

When the Grey Man starts to appear in her son\'s life she restarts contact with her sister Laura and heads, along with her son, into the alternate world where Laura has been living. But this can never be a final escape as the Grey Man and the organisation that controls him are committed to tracking them down.

And when they are contacted by the long lost Tim, they are drawn closer to this mysterious organisation and the other world where it is located.
