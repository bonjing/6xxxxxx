You downloaded all,right?
Here is what i think...In one folder you got installer for software (SampleMoog) and in other folder there is a library for SampleMoog...did u used Daemon Tools or PowerISO for install?
If u not used it,i believe that's the solution to your problem :D"

Oh, and Sampletank and -Moog work for me! Thank you for them, too!"

Hey man...i don't have it right now,but I will try to get my hands on that,to upload it here...

I don't know if this torrent of Philharmonik (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4537502/Miroslav_Philharmonik_[VST_RTAS_DX]) works with MAC but try it :D 

Greets, Man :D"
