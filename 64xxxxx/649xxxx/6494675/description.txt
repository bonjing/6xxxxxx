Body Heat is perhaps the most classic tale from Hollywood in what is the genre
of "Femme fatale" thrillers (such as they are!).

Latin expression: Mala merx haec et cadilla est 
("This woman is a bad bargain and a schemer")


If a woman never stops scheming at every waking moment and never seems sincere
in any way other than faigning pretence, you are likely in the presence of a 
"witch like" personality type whom you should beware if you wish to remain sane
and decently loving in your life pursuits. Best to pick a gal whose Christianly
sense of real goodness is in such overt abundance that any signs of "wickedness"
in her spirit is only defensiveness aganst those who truly are evil instead 
to her own better spirit - which should indeed be protected completely instead!

Amen!


God bless the Irish especially from Germany, and their kin in Italy
especially too!
