 Keep On Running - Part Two Part two of two. Ruth has an interview to determine
 whether she will be fully reinstated as a doctor, but despite appearing confident,
 she buckles under the pressure when a stroke victim is brought into the ED.
 A hung-over Linda clashes with Tess over management styles, and a run-in with a
 grieving patient prompts her to reassess her attitude. Meanwhile, Jeff continues
 to mentor troubled teen Karl despite everyone considering him a lost cause.
 Starring Georgia Taylor.
