This book is intended for teachers of college and high school statistics courses.
The different chapters cover demonstrations, examples, and projects for a succession
of topics in statistics and probability. (We distinguish between demonstrations,
which involve active student participation, and examples, which are
conducted by the instructor.)

This book contains more material than could possibly be used in a single
course; we suggest you read through it all and then try out some of the ideas.
Pick and choose what works for you.

Part I of the book presents a large selection of activities for introductory
statistics courses. Part II gives some tips on what works and what doesnâ€™t, how
to set up effective demonstrations and examples, and how to inspire students
to participate in class and work effectively in homeworks, exams, and group
projects. A sample course plan is presented in Chapter 12 to illustrate how to
integrate these materials into a semester-long statistics course. Part III presents
demonstrations, examples, and projects for some more advanced courses on topics
including decision theory, Bayesian statistics, sampling, and mathematical
probability and statistics.
