By the time they recorded their second album, mere months after the release of their first album, Love had already started to evolve. The five-piece was now seven, having added a new drummer and a woodwind player, and moving the man known as â€œSnoopyâ€ over to keyboards. Even the cover of Da Capo reflected the transformation in its restaging of the first albumâ€™s photo.
Their sound had more jazz and classical effects, beginning with the harpsichord and sax all over the chaotic â€œStephanie Knows Whoâ€. Arthur Lee sings all the songs on the album, even on â€œOrange Skiesâ€, demonstrating Bryan MacLeanâ€™s propensity to write songs about ice cream. â€œ?Que Vida!â€ is wonderfully poetic, matching the Latin beat and an infectious finger-picked guitar. The mood is immediately destroyed by the marvelous â€œSeven And Seven Isâ€, released earlier as a single that amazingly charted. Its galloping beat manages to stay steady all the way through the atomic explosion at the end. The challenges continue on â€œThe Castleâ€, an extremely complicated yet mesmerizing composition. Slightly more straightforward is the should-have-been hit single â€œShe Comes In Colorsâ€, the title of which would in time be stolen by the Stones for â€œSheâ€™s A Rainbowâ€, while the main flute section would be stolen by Madonna for â€œBeautiful Strangerâ€.
While side one is a nearly perfect album side, the same cannot be said for side two. â€œRevelationâ€ is a nineteen-minute jam framed by a harpsichord solo, otherwise consisting mostly of harmonica blasts and Arthur yelling over a boogie beat. (Oh, and thereâ€™s a drum solo too.) It may have been groundbreaking to have a single song take up an album side; after all, Dylan and Zappa did it, but those were at least double albums, and it also helps if the song is, you know, good. â€œRevelationâ€ is not. Maybe one must be high to appreciate it?
Still, the quality of the six songs on side one makes Da Capo a worthy follow-up. (In fact, all of side one was included on Rhinoâ€™s excellent 1995 Love Story anthology, which would be essential had it also included all of the first album.) Today the album is only available as a download, but again, the 2002 Elektra Classic import CD has it in both mono and stereo, with excerpts from the recording sessions for â€œSeven And Seven Isâ€. Of course, that also means it includes â€œRevelationâ€ twice.
2002 reissue of 1967 classic features the original seven tracks in mono & stereo with 'Seven & Seven Is' (Tracking Session) added as a bonus.
