@7NEGR9 - It's an Iso file, so you have to 1st open it with Imgburn and then you can play it!

@ Kumijorma - This file is MPEG-4 AVC format, so it has to be converted to Dvd 1st before it can be burned to Dvd!

@ geca2 - Get a Life you Idiot! It Is REAL!!!!!"
,nixxie,2011-06-28T17:43Z,Of course it is fake. The movie is still in Theaters and this is a download site. I love how people get mad when they download a movie to watch instead of paying for it. Download and deal with crappy quality or go pay to see it.
