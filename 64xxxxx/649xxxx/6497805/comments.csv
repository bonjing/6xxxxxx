Very good for a cam."
,Teachem,2011-07-04T11:34Z,"BUMMER! There's NO AUDIO to the main movie after the intro. Sample has Audio, intro to the main file has audio for a couple of minutes, then there's none! It's not Codec related..., I've tried three players and the entire Codec pack. Torrent is bad for sure, you'll NOT get Audio. Got it?"
