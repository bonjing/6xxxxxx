,Divarlyth,2011-06-23T21:08Z,"Ontop of that it sets up fine after you go through the uploaders retarded packaging scheme, you double click the exe, the process starts and then immediately closes itself.
Don't download."
,motley666,2011-06-23T21:42Z,Usually you have to unzip or unrar only one and the job is done.
,Ex7pwn,2011-06-23T22:01Z,"works fine, idk what did these guys do, but you just have to unzip unl-sola thru unl-solg and unrar then next zip, then install with unl-sol2 and play with solar 2.exe. easy. nice upload, thanks!"

You are kidding right? Nobody is that dumb"
,pirate230,2011-06-23T23:12Z,"I can confirm this does work. However, it didnt work for me, until I installed 'Microsoft XNA framework' as noted in the torrent comments. This sorted the problem of the game crashing as soon as I double click sonar 2.exe - Read the torrent instructions first -.-
'Microsoft XNA Framework Redistributable 4.0'

,Eliteleader,2011-06-30T15:04Z,Pff winrar says its damaged :(... off to redownload I guess.
,Eliteleader,2011-06-30T15:09Z,"Nope, doesn't work. It's damaged every time I download it. You think my virusscan is messing it up or is someone uploading corrupted files?"
,thebeav111,2011-07-02T18:02Z,"stupid people are funny...   your hd is dying if you keep getting corrupt files, or you have a virus or something.  And all you have to do is highlight all files and hit extract here if yer smart and using winrar...  OMG YOU HAVE TO HOLD SHIFT UPLOADER IS HORRIBLE!  hahahahaha.

THANK YOU MAFIAA!"
,djroosta,2011-07-08T15:04Z,"Nice Clean torrent (And no corrupts)

Loved this game until i completed it with-in 30minutes, lol...

Now i stay a rock :P"
,EvolZed,2011-07-12T16:35Z,"@Divarlyth

Pretty much what he said. Didnt work for me. Annoying as hell trying to unzip. Dont download..."
,TonyTokes42O,2011-07-13T06:34Z,quality upload bro
,xPBThankex,2011-07-14T15:21Z,"wow u guys suck..You dont know how to CHOOSE all zips and extract all at once?

you must be women, sneaking out of the kitchen."
,Rocklord_1,2011-07-15T05:26Z,"Two other posters already have said this, but for those utter, utter newbs: Select all rar files and choose ""extract here"", and if necessary do so again with any new rars. This is common with releases in the audio-warez scene, at least!
...or go buy it and stop whinging."
,bladesdnm,2011-07-15T15:35Z,Solar.exe wont fire. after u figgure out how to install this fucking time waster the exe dosnt work. woopity do
,demolished,2011-07-16T23:00Z,doesn't work for me extracted the rars installed the game trough that smiley face looking exe and when i try to open the game is says solar 2 has encountered a problem and needs to close right away. have tried to reinstall the torrent but didnt help never had such problems with a game
,Joosterman,2011-07-22T22:58Z,"as much as i don't want to come accross as a noob, i found this very difficult to instal, and ultimately am not sure what to do with all the 5+ megabyte folders"
,zonova,2011-08-04T20:00Z,"Works great. Just select all those .zip things, and extract it. And then extract the new rar file, and run the little smiley face thing inside of it. That will extract the game. "
,Sivos,2011-08-09T21:05Z,"Wow, you people are just such big whiners.  It works fine, who the hell cares that you, for once in your life, have to do a little more work.  If you're going to complain, then just get the fuck off the internet and go cry to your mommy, she's the only one who cares."
,Sivos,2011-08-09T21:07Z,"You make it seem like he/she put 30 .rar there.  There is only seven, grow up."
,Sivos,2011-08-09T21:15Z,"FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T START IT AFTER EXTRACTING....

Read the description again, you HAVE to download and install those things to get it to work.  For me, I just had to install the XNA, maybe the same for you.  Anyway, it works perfectly fine, anyone who says otherwise can't read and probably did not graduate elementary school."
,anseio,2011-08-20T10:41Z,"Despite the very complicated extraction process, game works perfectly!"
,Atomsk1,2011-08-23T09:06Z,"wow, all that recursive compression nesting really was a great idea! you managed to squeeze a 31.9 MB file down to...32.01 MB. File took longer to extract than it did to download lol"
,nat13_3,2011-08-29T08:21Z,Heres the same torrent without the unzipping required. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6637127
,americanderp,2011-09-15T04:04Z,oh god the comments made my day
,astroholiday,2011-10-07T00:13Z,worked on windows 7. be sure to select all the rar files (a-g) and click extract. do it again for the second batch of rar files and the .exe together with a bunch of dll will appear. click on the executable file and the game will load. no virus whatsover. thanks for this wonderful game. :)
,Itchiga,2011-12-28T14:36Z,"Fuck rar ... Just unzip at once all ZIP files .. then extract rar files =,="" "
,GaminPirate,2011-12-28T17:39Z,why compress it like this the file sizes are minimal wtf is ur problem making it suck like this -_- rate --------------
,Mr-Mysterious,2012-01-15T07:53Z,"Worked perfectly for me (usually games never work for me lol as im quite noobeh)

Just ignore the comments and right cick highlight all the zip files and extract (using winzip) then right click and extract the zipfiles extracted. then just run the exe.


Good short game. Thanks Yogcast"
