I seem to have this problem whenever a torrent has lots of files in it."
,grawr,2011-08-27T06:10Z,"right click on the torrent name, and click re check, it will go to 0 percent and recheck what is there and dl the rest.
It could be your disk is badly fragmented or something, and i had it happen to, nothing to worry"
