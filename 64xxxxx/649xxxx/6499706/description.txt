Storyline: Boozy playboy Arthur Bach (Russell Brand) and his chauffeur, Bitterman (Luis Guzman), dress up in Batman and Robin suits for a formal dinner hosted by Arthur's mother, Vivienne (Geraldine James). The dinner is intended to announce Arthur as the new chairman of her corporation, Bach Worldwide. Upon driving to the dinner in a Batmobile, intoxicated and being chased by police, Arthur is arrested and released the next day.Vivienne and Susan (Jennifer Garner), her shrewd assistant, arrange a plan to have Susan marry Arthur to allow her to be in control of the company, leaving stable leadership. Arthur refuses, but is told that he will be completely cut off from the $950 million inheritance if he does not marry Susan. Arthur reluctantly agrees and asks Susan's father, Burt Johnson (Nick Nolte), for permission to marry his daughter. Burt agrees after putting Arthur to a table saw and warning him not to embarrass Susan. The next day, Arthur meets Naomi (Greta Gerwig), an illegal tour guide who Arthur takes an interest in to due to her rebellious nature. He arranges his wedding while sneaking around on dates with Naomi. Arthur's nanny, Lillian Hobson (Helen Mirren) â€“ who normally dislikes all of Arthur's choices in women â€“ gets to know and like Naomi. Arthur learns that Naomi would like to have her children's book about the Statue of Liberty published. Arthur attempts to find employment and other options so that he would be able to keep seeing Naomi and not need the $950 million, but to no avail.
