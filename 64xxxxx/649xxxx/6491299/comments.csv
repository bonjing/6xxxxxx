,pjsmoke,2011-06-26T12:57Z,"Any word on Battlestar Gallactica 720p?

Also, I'm crossing my fingers you re-do the 4400 720p eventually. However, I'd be happy with a high quality DVDrip encode if you've deleted your 720p original source.

Keep it up mate, I just wish it was possible to get speedy and huge internet plans in Australia."

,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-06-27T12:28Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6300339/Dexter_-_Season_1-2-3-4-5_Complete_480p_x264_-_BoB

,Night_89,2011-06-27T18:02Z,The BoB one is ripped from 720p but mkvGOD will upload it in 720p
,pjsmoke,2011-06-27T18:47Z,Bob encodes also have annoying watermarks/his shit text logo at the bottom of the screen. I avoid them despite the fact they are stil better than 350mb avis.

,xaximus,2012-02-25T21:16Z,"The video quality is fantastic for the video size, but a 10 it is most certainly not. It's quite muddy and indistinct. This is absolutely not a criticism, but I wanted to add some caution and a warning to those would who believe the other posts saying the video is a 10."
