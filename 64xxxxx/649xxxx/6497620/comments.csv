,rotrent,2011-07-11T10:27Z,I never would download this. I would buy it. This great band got 11 musicians. Don't get them unemployed!

I am so broke right now and want this SO BAD.  

I WILL buy it soon!

Thanks "

With Oteal on base too!!  You all should try to see them live.  I already have this on vinyl, so a free mp3 sounds right for me.  Thanks!!"
