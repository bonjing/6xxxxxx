There seem to be a lot of TTC-videos althought i havent found Transformational Leadership anywhere yet, and though the math tutor complete collection is pretty large, it seem to not cover every course on mathtutordvd, ok! I get that there always comes new courses like calculus 1: derivatives, someone seem to have asked for pre-algebra too, although myself am able to cope with my algebra, other people may have difficulties.

Well... I request. If you can find:
TTC - Transformational Leadership

and

Math Tutor DVD Calculus 1: Extra Practice with Derivatives

It would be most helpful for me.
Keep up the good work! And lets seed for every peoples that are hungry for knowledge..."

Sorry, can't find ""TTC - Transformational Leadership"" yet."
,raenkae,2011-06-26T01:24Z,"Oh. Maybe its too new.. It is among their courses. The full title is 
Transformational Leadership: How Leaders Change Teams, Companies, and Organizations 

Well. Time will tell if it arrives. Would need a leadership-course.
Thanks. All Math Tutor lectures are highly welcome for one in my situation."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-26T02:37Z,New TTC courses tend to show up on the familiar torrent sites sooner or later. :-)
,Brnchstr,2011-06-26T11:37Z,"Thank you so much for these great courses!
If I could make a request it would be TTC Video - Origin of Civilization Taught By Professor Scott MacEachern. http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=3130
God bless!"
