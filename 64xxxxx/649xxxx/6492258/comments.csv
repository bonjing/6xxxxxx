I am reposting these torrents from demonoid for those that want them.
I am not the one doing the recording and encoding.

If the episodes appear I will certainly help in bringing them to TPB but I can't promise anything."
,BoonesFerry,2011-06-25T17:38Z,@skepticink Thank you. When I last looked for Friday's episode on demonoid it was not there. Guess I need to exercise more patience...I see it there now too. Thank you for sharing the torrent here on piratebay.
