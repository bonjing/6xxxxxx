B-O-B is a "wildly successful"[1] series of sex education videos covering the practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a strap-on dildo (known as pegging). The first of the two videos, which was released in 1998, became the best selling video to date for Good Vibrations, a sex-toy business.[2] The video was also featured on The Daily Show. The videos promote the idea, as Eye Weekly puts it, that "fucking your boyfriend in the ass is fun".[3]

The videos star sexologist Carol Queen, who discusses pegging and also demonstrates the practice with her lover. The videos also contain footage of other couples engaging in the practice. The porn star Chloe appears in the second video; as she is best known as an anal queen, her use of a strap-on dildo is a "role reversal".
