For decades, scores of doctors, government officials, journalists, and others have extolled the benefits of psychiatric medicines for children. GENERATION RX presents â€œthe rest of the storyâ€ and unveils how this era of unprecedented change in Western culture really occurred â€” and what price has been paid by our society.

International award-winning filmmaker Kevin P. Miller (Let Truth Be The Bias, The Promised Land) â€œdelivers a jaw-dropping emotional ride,â€ and â€œweaves a terrifying tale of criminal conspiracy, the mass abandonment of medical ethics, and the routine betrayal of an entire generation.â€ By employing the expertise of internationally respected professionals from the fields of medicine, ethics, journalism, and academia, GENERATION RX investigates collusion between drug companies and their regulatory watchdogs at the FDA and focuses on the powerful stories of real families who followed the advice of their doctors â€” and faced devastating consequences for doing so.

Ultimately, Generation RX may help parents decide whether the perceived benefits of these medications outweigh the serious risks to children.

â€œGeneration Rx is a film that every parent should see,â€ says Jason Buchanan of ALL MOVIE GUIDE.
