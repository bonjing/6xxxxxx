,motley666,2011-06-27T02:42Z,"If they work fine, it was a good idea for a pack with these games, i own the main game, by the way."
,ka40,2011-06-28T17:19Z,"well, it works fine for me so i hope it will work fine for you guys too.
If you guys have any Questions just write a comment and ill hopefully find an answer to it in a moment."
,ka40,2011-07-07T03:31Z,"may i ask where the 10 seeders went?
i can't keep re-uploading...."
,ka40,2011-07-07T03:57Z,"shame, im going to delete this torrent if there aren't enough seeders (6-10) by the 15th of july.
hopefully the 125 people who downloaded this will get some compassion an start seeding."
,kevceltic,2011-07-16T14:31Z,"Looks like it is still here. Do you really think people are going to read your message after downloading this? Even better do you think they will read your plea then all of a sudden have a wave of ""compassion"" and start seeding it again?"
,laskipallo87,2011-07-16T19:23Z,"no need to be an ass keveltic, however, you're sadly very correct on the fact that no one wants to seed, keeping torrents alive never been a piratebay thing..."
,ka40,2011-07-16T23:59Z,"Right then, the torrent will just stay forever.
It's up to you guys if it'll stay alive."
,dufflebagboyssg,2011-08-03T17:34Z,I can't extract the zip
,ka40,2011-08-05T12:52Z,"try using 7zip if you are currently use winrar,
dufflebagboyssg."
,prince1376,2011-08-06T13:03Z,"hey after i download the game, when i go for extracting the folder it shows a error. the code is-error 0x80004005. is there any solution to this error ? if no then im going to delete the zips. pls let me know soon.. thnks."
,prince1376,2011-08-06T13:07Z,wht is a 7 zip?
,prince1376,2011-08-06T13:13Z,what is a 7 zip?
,ka40,2011-08-06T21:48Z,"7zip is a free compressing, or decompressing tool that works with zip, 7zip or rar formats, to name a few.
(note: decompressing = extracting)

about the error, i don't know but perhaps it is your extractor that wasn't installed (or working) correctly."
,motley666,2011-08-26T18:37Z,"ka40, you say 125 people downloaded this at some point, is there a way to know how many d'l a torrent when you are an uploader?"
,ka40,2011-08-30T20:29Z,"@motley

well, you won't know for certain but.
if you are uploading from day 1 and keep on uploading then when you want to know how many ppl downloaded it you can see with utorrent at the info section of a torrent."
,motley666,2011-08-31T18:38Z,I had uploaded many torrents here and i will again so could you be more specific when you say info?
,ka40,2011-08-31T20:43Z,"@motley

i did a bit of research with google as should you but heres what i found out till now.

you can use http://1337x.org/ to kinda see how many people downloaded it, i say kinda because this is not precise by 100%.

Hope this helps,
ka40"
,motley666,2011-09-01T01:59Z,"I didn't google it because an experienced user had told me that its not possible but then i saw your comment and i asked you. I checked out the site you give me but i will ask in the forums too, maybe the admins know something. Thank you."
,Eeeeeevil,2012-01-12T12:51Z,"Guys do you know how to fix the colour issues? I tried all the compatability options, but none of them seem to work."

,rkswapper,2012-01-15T21:24Z,"Here's how to fix the unzipping error. You need to download 7zip then open the destination folder with the .zip archives. Right click on the them > 7zip > extract to.....
