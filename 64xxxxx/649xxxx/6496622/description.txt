review:
This is a great movie. It reminds me a little bit of "Beloye Solntse Pustini" or in English "The White Sun of the Desert", same type of the 1920's action movie. I think this movie has some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in any film. This is a very easy going-enjoyable-smart action film. Mikhalkov did a great job.
