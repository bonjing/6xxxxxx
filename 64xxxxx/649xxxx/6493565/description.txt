NOTE: This may not be the most sophisticated information organizer software I have seem, but I think it gets the work down VERY well, is easy to use, and it's "notebook" layout reminding you that of working you are doing in like schoolwork.This little difference in the interface grabbed my attention, I wonder if anyone else shares that view.  Everything on the web can simply be dragged onto it's DOCK icon, of onto a notebook page, and then organized later when needed. Give it a try and see if you like it.

Version 3.0.10:

* Improved error recovery when looking up contact information in  
  AddressBook for contact stickers. 

* The best way to add contacts to a Notebook is by dragging them from 
  Address Book rather than by dragging v-cards into a Notebook (the  
  latter method is not guaranteed to  succeed, even though it might appear 
  to at first).

* Fixed a bug where table row heights would be too large if a numbering
  style was assigned to the table header row.

* Fixed a bug where using the stylus eraser to erase a scribble would
  sometimes fail.

* Fixed a bug where creation, change and due date sorting ignored time
  time associated with items.

* Fixed a bug where the inspector would sometimes fail to update when
  the pageâ€™s outline selection changed.

* Fixed a bug where the Link to Another Cell or Page contextual menu
  item was disabled for outline items with visible children.

* Fixed a bug with the creation and display of Cornell pages.

* Fixed a bug where if you deleted the content of cells in a native table  
  and  the cells contained numbers, the numbers would appear again the  
  next time you edited the table cells.

* Fixed a bug with voice recording timestamps.

* When you open a page in a new window, the alert that warns about
  losing the Notebookâ€™s undo history has an option to not see that alert
  again.

* Fixed a crasher with page- or Notebook-wide undos.

* Fixed a bug with text display after a change in fonts in the outline.

* Fixed a bug with outline layout after editing an item in the outline.

* Fixed a crasher related to triple-clicking in a sticky note.

* Fixed a bug where the Find panel didnâ€™t work in pages open in a
  separate window.

* Fixed a bug where links containing Japanese or other Unicode text,
  when dragged from Safari to NoteBook were not added to the
  NoteBook page as links.

* Fixed a problem where Mac voice annotations were recorded in a file
  format not playable on the iPad.

* Changes to support Lion.
