                       Streets Of Rage Trilogy [PC]
                       ============================
S.O.R. 1
********
his city was once a peaceful place to live. Yeah, that was a long while back, though. A Syndicate led by a black-hearted man named Mr. X has taken control of the city. Suddenly, the city went from peaceful to war zone, almost as fast as someone snapping his fingers. Gangs roamed the streets, attacking anyone that they see. Bikers terrorized the highways. The police were helpless. Mr. X's grip was tight, and he wasn't letting go anytime soon.

Something has to be done...

Looks like that's something's gotta be me. I'm Axel Stone. I'm a member of the police force here in this city, and I'm not about to sit and let this city go to hell. Me and my partners Blaze Fielding and Adam Hunter made a pact: we're taking Mr. X down no matter what. So now we're heading out to save this city, on the Streets of Rage.

Axel, Blaze, and Adam are three bad ass ex-cops who are taking it to the streets so they can make an attempt to clean the city up of all the smelly, good for nothing punks that are polluting the area. A madman named Mr. X is at the head of all this troublesome turmoil in the big city, and he is also the trio's main nemesis. But to get to Mr. X, the bold threesome must first make it through stages consisting of seemingly endless streets, towering elevators, a beach that never sleeps, and a few other not so welcoming places.

S.O.R. 2
********
In Streets of Rage three young vigilante police officers, Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding, and Adam Hunter, destroyed the evil Syndicate leader, Mr. X, and saved the city from turning into a ruined warzone. Axel, Blaze, and Adam eventually left the city, but agreed to reunite one year later to celebrate. In that year, Axel became a bodyguard, Blaze opened a dance school, and Adam rejoined the police force, and got an apartment with his kid brother in the city. The three celebrated late into the night, and decided to meet again in a year.

The next day, as Axel and Blaze prepared to leave the city, they received an urgent phone call from Adam's kid brother, Sammy Â«SkateÂ» Hunter. He had come home from school to find the apartment a wreck, and his brother missing. When Axel and Blaze arrived at the apartment, they found a photograph of Adam, chained up to a wall, with a man they knew all too well standing before him: the evil Mr. X.

Mr. X had somehow returned, and now his deadly grip on the city was far, far worse than before. Gangs attacked in broad daylight. Bikers terrorized the streets and highways, attacking anyone that dares drive on them. Muggings, lootings, and murders were taking place far more frequently, and some far worse than before. It seemed like Mr. X was in complete control.

Now, Axel, Blaze, Sammy, and Axel's good friend Max, a pro wrestler, must head out to stop Mr. X once again... hopefully for good...

S.O.R.3
*******
After being defeated twice, Syndicate crime boss Mr. X has started a research company called RoboCy Corporation to act as a cover for his illegal activities. The world's best roboticist, Dr. Dahm, has been brought in to help him create an army of realistic robots to replace important officials from the city. With the replacements in place, Mr. X plans to run the city using a remote control device. His criminal organization, The Syndicate, has strategically placed bombs around the city to distract the police while the city officials are dealt with.

Dr. Zan discovers what the research is really for and knows the Syndicate must be stopped. He contacts Blaze Fielding with the details of The Syndicate's plan. Blaze quickly contacts her old comrades Axel Stone and Adam Hunter for a task force to bring down The Syndicate once and for all. Axel quickly joins the task force, but Adam can't make it (due to his own assignments from within the police) and sends his young brother, Eddie "Skate" Hunter instead.

The gameplay features a large increase in pace from Streets of Rage 2. The heroes move and attack FASTER, but so do the enemies. Enemy attacks can also be avoided with new running and vertical-Dodge moves, though most player attacks deal less damage than in the predecessor. The level timer has been removed and was replaced with a 'power meter' (see below). The end-of-level 'time bonus' has been replaced with a 'Life bonus', determined by the amount of life a player has at the end of a level.

A significant change is that special moves no longer always drain the player's life bar, thanks to The Power meter. The power meter takes a few seconds to fill, and when empty, the player is weaker in attacking, and takes more damage when hit and when using special moves. When full however, the player attacks and defends at full strength, and use of a special move will not drain the player's life bar at all, though it will drain the power meter to empty again. However, although the power meter makes a large difference to the player's strength in Bare Knuckle 3, in Streets of Rage 3 the difference is barely noticeable. The change means special moves can be used much more often, extending a character's normal repertoire. Though this is balanced by the moves being weaker.

The semi-special (blitz) moves are also much weaker than in the previous game initially, but can be upgraded, with the 'power star' system. On gaining 40,000 points on a single life, the player receives a power star (maximum 3), enabling a more powerful blitz attack. Losing a life will cost the player a power star, making them difficult to preserve later in the game.

Traps in stages are brought back from the original game; enemies can once again be thrown into pits or off the side of an elevator. Trains and various electric/laser devices also make appearances. Other features to make a return from the first game in the series are co-operative attacks, and the inability to throw the heavy fire-breathers.
