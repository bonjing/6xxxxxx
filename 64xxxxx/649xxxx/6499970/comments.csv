[H],BigNoise,2011-06-28T21:17Z,@all above - use the magnet link instead - that works always
,paulrobin,2011-06-29T07:13Z,Magnet does not work either. This is a faulty upload
,LucyWoof,2011-06-30T05:29Z,"Working OK, used the magnet link."
,paulbx,2011-07-27T09:52Z,"If you are new to magnet links, at first when passed to ones torrent software they seem to do nothing and show no files. Just let it do its stuff & give it some time. It does work. "
