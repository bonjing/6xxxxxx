A 2002  REMAKE of Michael Mann's Manhunter which was the first adaptation of the best selling novel by Thomas Harris.

The only difference in THIS version is the scene which was left out in Manhunter,
which it the one where Leckter attacks Grahame.

Plot: Special Agent Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) goes to the home of retired FBI agent in Florida to seek his assistance in apprehending a serial killer dubbed the
"Tooth Fairy" by the police due to characteristic bite marks he leaves on his victims.
