,SuperInfinity,2011-08-13T17:17Z,This isn't HD at all. It's just something like 480 blown up to 720p. You can tell it straightaway. You CANNOT fit a HD movie into 500 megs. 
,SuperInfinity,2011-08-13T17:26Z,"Well, compared the two, and it is more detailed than the 368p one I have. But it's just so blurry when the action is moving that it's just not good enough for HD. Maybe it really is HD, but you need far more than 500 megs for good HD. 

One of the best things about HD is that when the characters are not in close-ups you can still see them really clearly. Here you can't, at least not if they're moving the slightly fraction. "
