Lost For Words

Jayne Furlong, a spirited 17 year old prostitute, always had dreams of escaping that life and becoming a child psychologist. However, her hopes were dashed when she disappeared from her usual patch in Auckland's Karangahape Road red light district in 1993. Police strongly suspect that Jayne was murdered, although her body has never been found. Psychics Kelvin Cruickshank and Deb Webber investigate her mysterious disappearance.
