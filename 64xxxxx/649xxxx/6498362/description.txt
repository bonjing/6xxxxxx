When you consider that Radiohead would become one of the most innovative bands of the '90s, their debut album Pablo Honey feels somewhat conventional: solid alternative/grunge music, clever lyrics and good hooks. That doesn't make it any less awesome, however. Massively backed by indie radio, the single Creep became a hit in the student community, and simultaneously established the band as serious musicians, with interesting points to make and hefty musical skills with which to drive them home.
Not the best Radiohead album, but the one I listened more.
