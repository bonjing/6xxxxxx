World Made by Hand is a dystopian novel by James Howard Kunstler published in 2008. Set in the fictional town of Union Grove, New York, the novel follows a cast of characters as they navigate a world stripped of its modern comforts, ravaged by terrorism, epidemics, and the economic upheaval of peak oil.[1]

Narrated by Robert Earle, a local carpenter who has lost his wife and son, the novel focuses on several contrasting groups meant to represent the directions society could go after a breakdown of modern social norms. In the beginning of the novel, the citizens of Union Grove are living on the tail end of a national catastrophe, with their community slowly falling apart from neglect and natural decay. One group is led by Wayne Karp, a rough leader of scrappers and thugs who salvage from around the county and live in a group of trailers known as Karpsville. As the story begins Brother Jobe comes to town, the leader of a religious group called the New Faith Church, who come from the south and settle into the old high school. Another faction is led by Steven Bulloch, a landed farmer with vision who sets his farm up like an English manor and becomes self-sufficient. Much of the rest of the nation seems to be falling apart, with nuclear blasts in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., cities devolving and a fractured United States. All of these forces struggle to respect life in a way that was taken for granted before events changed, and build pragmatically for a new future. Earle's experiences are the focus of this struggle.

Kunstler explores themes of local and sustainable living. In interviews, Kunstler describes his imaginary world as an "enlightened nineteenth century."
