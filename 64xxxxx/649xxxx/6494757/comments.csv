[V],meech,2011-06-25T17:50Z,"FYI...One thing I forgot to mention in the description: Fox aired Season 1 (&2) in a different order than intended, which brought some chronological errors/inconsistencies when viewing.  This torrent numbers the episodes in the correct, intended order for viewing...not in the order they were aired."
,pirateradiorocks,2011-07-10T00:08Z,Correct sequence?  You are the MAN!!
,TaZeRz,2012-01-21T01:27Z,Is there a widescreen release of these? why is it in 4:3?
,Nei1,2012-05-05T21:56Z,"I've been pretty active with the torrents for a few years, and I never got an email from Comcast about ""Copyright Infringement.""

Until this torrent.

At least I got its Share Ratio up to 5.7 before I stopped it.

Best luck,

@meech Thanks for all the high quality rips, are you still planning on upping stargate atlantis? If so, looking forward to it."
