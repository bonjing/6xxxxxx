,VinnyThunder,2011-06-23T22:58Z,Does anyone have the bonus track (the full-length version of Hour of Need) from the Japan release?
,FatElvisForever,2011-06-24T04:37Z,Thanks for the seed.   But my God is Chiris Squire serious?  They've literally replaced riffs with scales.

,canadianice,2011-06-24T16:53Z,"No Jon Anderson, 'nuff said"
,canadianice,2011-06-24T21:18Z,"no bonus track?, this is not the version out of Japan!"
,canadianice,2011-06-25T01:42Z,"Wow just gave this a listen----zzzzzz, just proves what age does to you-----retire boys---"
,dr.jig,2011-06-26T06:00Z,Love the album!!Sounds a lot like Drama!!!
,fred99u,2011-07-02T02:28Z,"before download:   canadianice is probably being rough on Yes

after download and listen:  canadianice is exactly right

i dont think age has anything to do with it, this album just sucks"
,KioskBerra,2011-07-04T21:10Z,"Unfortunately, this is NOT Yes!
This is FORMER Yes, without lead singer!
Jon is not Yes, but neither is Chris.
They need each other, to become Yes.
A sad, sad moment for all of us who followed
the laddies through the years. Heartbreaking.
