Robert John [Photographer]
Born in Birmingham, Alabama on November 10, 1961, John moved to California with his parents when he was three years old. In his youth, he had a racing career that ended after an injury to his back and the death of his father.
In 1982, John started as a professional photographer in the music industry by shooting W.A.S.P., London, LA Guns and Hollywood Rose. When the latter became Guns N' Roses, John worked with them and became their exclusive photographer when the band was signed to Geffen Records.
