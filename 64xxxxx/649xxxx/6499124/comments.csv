+1

May be YIFY and Kickasstorrents are in some sort of understanding---

http://thepiratebay.org/user/KickAssTorrents/

Lately both the Moghuls seem to have divided their workloads...

Enjoy the sweet taste of quality people...good times are here for us...

""Sharing is The Religion...TPB is the MECCA"""

,guru10101,2011-06-28T03:59Z,"YIFY

Thanks for all the great movies, your work is great.  I really like the quality.  What software do you use for encoding x264 and packaging in .mkv?

Thanks for everything you have done so far, Hope you keep up the great work."

Either way, great uploads man. :)"

,Johnny24071982,2011-07-24T10:27Z,"Yify I've noticed that since you went over to the MP4 codec the quality seems to have dropped and not what it used to be. I say, if people want to watch your Rips on their Ipods, then they must get a video converter to convert the files themselves. Your Rips are not what they used to be I'm afraid. But thanks anyway. "
,fofo141,2011-08-15T05:55Z,Thank you very much YIFY
,kalbloke,2011-09-01T14:55Z,"YIFY Thanks, thanks and thanks again!
