|   This album comes at a special time in the career of our beloved Yoof.      |
|   Here, they have had time. Time as noise rockers, alternative               |
|   trailblazers, and even time as charting artists. They've had quite a       |
|   time by now. Now they have their own studio to explore their sound in      |
|   and a rock era fading past. Here they've taken up their mantle as          |
|   fiercely independent and exploratory artists once more.                    |
|                                                                              |
|   A Thousand Leaves sounds like little else in the Sonic catalog due to      |
|   their willingness to leave rock territory behind and carve out a new       |
|   niche in their own land of open tunings and three guitar luster.           |
|                                                                              |
|   It begins with crunching, crackling feedback. Not like the Sonic Youth     |
|   of old. Here, there seems to be more body to the noise. It doesn't         |
|   accentuate the notes; it is the whole of the music. Kim's voice wanders    |
|   in. It really doesn't matter that she's referencing Lewis Carroll or       |
|   talking about sexism. Her voice is actually warm, slightly manipulated,    |
|   but reassuring in a way it never was before. Contre le Sexisme is a        |
|   declaration of Kim's presence on the album and the femininity that         |
|   pervades it.                                                               |
|                                                                              |
|   Sunday follows. While a great single, it doesn't rock out like earlier     |
|   Sonics. It seems more laconic, more willful, and revels in noise as        |
|   beauty, with not a hint of pop convention adorning it. The guitars here    |
|   crunch and growl with abandon, then plunge into a howl and scream solo     |
|   that fans have never heard before. Here there is texture, atmosphere,      |
|   even emotion that had been so absent during the rock era of the            |
|   nineties. This is beautiful.                                               |
|                                                                              |
|   What's that sound squeezing your head out of shape? It's the intro to      |
|   "Female Mechanic Now On Duty". Angry, politicized, and slightly            |
|   ridiculous, it nevertheless works. The guitar interplay is bliss, and      |
|   the second half's percussion is just sublime. Liquid guitar may not save   |
|   the lyrics or vocals, but really, that's not at all out of place for       |
|   Kim. And Steve Shelley's percussion makes up for it, I swear.              |
|                                                                              |
|   "Hoarfrost" is a highlight here, one of the best Lee songs. Cold, wintry   |
|   guitar plucking leads you into a snow-covered forest, and while the        |
|   spiders build their silver webs, you just gaze around at all the beauty    |
|   that threatens to swallow you.                                             |
|                                                                              |
|   Lee contributes another highlight, 'Karen Koltrane', precursor to Murray   |
|   Street's 'Karenology'. Though nearly grating in its aggressive             |
|   dissonance, the song is saved from being a particularly abrasive           |
|   curiosity by an utterly incredible instrumental. The multi-part, fluid     |
|   and intricate guitar interplay makes this a latter-day classic.            |
|                                                                              |
|   Aside from these highlights, some of the songs don't quite perform as      |
|   well. Thurston's vocals in Wildflower Soul are too fragile, and Kim gets   |
|   a bit obnoxious and overly silly from time to time. However, overall,      |
|   the album is consistently engaging and pleasing. This album finds beauty   |
|   in noise like early Sonic Youth, only here tempered by maturity and        |
|   wisdom. Though Kim's songs get to be a little too much, the thematic       |
|   unity of the album and wonderful guitar sounds that these rockers have     |
|   found again are worth a few bad moments. [altron2095, sputnikmusic]        |
