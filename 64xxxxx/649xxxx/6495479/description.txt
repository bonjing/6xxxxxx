The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This fourteenth alphabetical installment is: DC H-Dh (Minus Detective)


What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


Today's offering: DC from DC Holiday to Dhampire-Stillborn

 
Enjoy!

DC Reboot Covers - These are the covers for the new DC reboot, or at least possible covers. I'm sure they've looked at other possibilities, so who knows? Likely there will be multiple covers for some if not all the new number ones. Damn them for renumbering Action and even more Detective if they do. It was bad enough when they pulled Batman from Detective. I was appalled. I'm sure they'll end up going back to the old numbers as the did with Superman and as Marvel did with their top titles, but it's not the same. It's purely a cosmetic thing some say,  but damn it I was going to do a 1000 issue Detective torrent some day. It just won't be the same if it's two volumes, or v1, v2 and v1a (which is how I designate Superman's renumbering) Not to mention that Adventures of Superman continued the numbering from v1, so it was really a rename of S to AoS then back to S, with Sv2 in between. Will Detective continue the numbering as "The Dark KNight Detective" or some other silliness? Comics companies and numbering and volume numbers drive me batty, Marketing should not trump arithmetic.

Ok, take a deep breath, now breath slowly into the paper bag, it's just a comic book, they aren't doing it to get your goat personally. They apparently don't care about the torrents, those men in back outside are just goths. They don't even know you. You don't even have a goat anyway and they don't want your dog. What would they do with a goat, anyway? They already have animal man and he's quite enough for them.
