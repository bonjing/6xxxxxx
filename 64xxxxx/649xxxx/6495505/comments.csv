it seems as the text is not correctly scanned!"
,paulbx,2011-09-13T14:37Z,"The book is unfortunately turned into a pdf in an odd fashion. Photos & maps fill pages, but the text is tiny and crammed over on the left of the page -- but one can zoom in to read the still high resolution text. The bibliography and ToC are too far left and have lost their left most letters. 

Awkward but usable. So I still say thanks for this new book. "
