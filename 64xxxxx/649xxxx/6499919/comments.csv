,SoundBarber,2011-06-29T02:44Z,Thanks. I've had this problem too. I tried 4Videosoft MKV Video Converter which took a long time and still messed up the audio half way through Alice's interview.

I had the exact same problem at first.  Audio would stop right after he talked about puking up blood.  I know exactly what you're talking about!"

As far as transcolding - I prefer not to transcode something that's already been transcoded, because you will lose some fidelity in the process. Not to mention it takes a while."
