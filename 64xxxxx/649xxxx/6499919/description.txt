PS3 / PS3MS Users Rejoice.

I got fed up with this audio issue with MKV2VOB v2.4.9 3r1c.

Gotsent sucks, it makes the audio stereo and it sounds very subpar.

So, back when these problems started, I had enough and did not go to sleep until I figured it out.

I read up on audio headers then I separated (demuxed) the video (h264) and audio (ac3)
and began doing some forensic analysis on the ac3 audio.  Many programs got confused while trying to open this file, some reported it as stereo, some as 5.1 dolby digital.

I tried many things, including extracting all 6 audio channels and resampling the audio then muxing it back into an AC3 file and trick the header.

Then I figured it out.

What's happening is when FOV is recording and editing these episodes he's unintentionally leaving around 200 milliseconds (blank screen) from the previous show that was on BBC.
And guess what, that previous program was DD 5.1 in lieu of DD stereo.

So what you have is an audio file that starts out DD 5.1 and then switches to DD stereo, thus causing things to wrong.

I've successfully fixed Episode 4 & 5 from the Previoius Season.
