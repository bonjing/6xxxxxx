I meant to leave a note some time ago when you shared the Mary Onettes album and related your thoughts on how it had played out to the backdrop of your life at the time. It certainly resonated with me and I think about your words each time I listen to the album.
Thanks Dan - what you do means a lot to me. You're a true gent and scholar.
Mike"

,Dynoss,2011-06-29T07:12Z,"Hello 80zforever. I need to ask you something. I have two very good synth-pop songs from the 80's, but unfortunately, I am not able to recognize who these artists are. So I was thinking, if I can maybe post just a two short samples here, so you and the others could hear them and maybe recognize them? please..."
[V],80zforever,2011-07-01T19:02Z,"Hey Dynoss, send the sample songs by e-mail to me danieldking at gmail dot com and I will give it a listen! cheers"
