Metropolitan Anthony (Anthony Bloom) caught the imagination of countless people by his brioadcasts - although their content was uncomfortable and challenging they had huge audiences. He then started publishing books and among his early publications was Meditations on a Theme. This book takes the reader on a journey of intense spiritual endeavour. The Kingdom on God is something to be conquered. It is not something that can be given away to those who only wait for it to come. What we must aim at, in response to the love of God, declared and manifest in Christ, is to become true disciples by offering ourselves as a sacrifice to God. Anthony Bloom takes us on a path traced by centuries of Christian pilgrims, taking as landmarks for our meditations certain passages of the Gospel. At the close of this meditative journey , we are able to forget ourselves and enter into a vision that transcends us and at the same time leads us to contemplate trust, which alone can bring us to God.
