Complete Medievil 1 Soundtrack. The original soundtrack of this game was made using electronic synthesizers to simulate an entire orchestra and organ. The 2005 PlayStation Portable (PSP) game MediEvil: Resurrection used parts of the Medievil score along with original elements composed by the artists Bob and Barn and performed by a live orchestra and choir.[2] An album was made from this music and signed copies can be purchased from the artists' website.
