,Drenaje1,2011-06-26T00:02Z,what a waste of time...
,m2austin,2011-06-26T02:02Z,"Downloaded and ran the extraction app. Works perfect. Make sure that you update your .NET framework - the links can be found in this v.1.0.4 torrent description here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6460748/Terraria.v1.0.4.cracked-THETA"
,m2austin,2011-06-26T02:03Z,"Also, if you're looking for servers, most are now running v.1.0.5 and can be found here:

http://www.terrariaonline-servers.com/

Also note, you'll have to port forward BOTH ports 7777 AND 31337 on your router if you want to play online servers. Most v.1.0.4+ servers now use port 7777 so enter this after entering the server IP in multiplayer.

To learn how to port-forward Terraria, go here:

http://portforward.com/english/applications/port_forwarding/Terraria/Terrariaindex.htm

Lastly, some people use Hamachi if they can't port-forward. This isn't suggested if you CAN port-forward as it opens up your computer to outsiders. If the server IS using Hamachi - it's IP will start with a 5. If you need to use Hamachi - get it here:

http://hamachi.en.softonic.com/download"
,m2austin,2011-06-26T02:07Z,"Finally, to use Hamachi with Terraria - watch the first video here which is 6min by UKJaMiEUK ... It deals with both setting up and joining a server:

http://www.google.ca/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=How+to+Set+up+a+Terraria+Server+youtube

And that's pretty much it.  Enjoy!"

Whats the problem? Why's it a waste? Hrmm..

@m2austin 
My my what complicated instructions XD
Anywho you dont necessarily need to portforward to join servers (I managed to join a few servers before I made my own without ever having to portforward). Although you do need to knowt how if you want to Make a server though =/"

,smashbr0s,2011-06-30T13:51Z,"Hey, I was playing multiplayer on some server I found online for a good 5-10 hours and then I randomly get kicked and my internet d/c'ed (I'm using a mobile broadband). So I decided I had enough playing for one day and I'll continue tomorrow. So it's tomorrow now and I now whenever I try to join ANY server in general, I'm stuck at the Connecting to  screen. 

Any help would be appreciated!!!"
,miguelsz3,2011-06-30T15:52Z,"It seems to be a fairly common issue and apparently theres no real explanation as to why it happends. I can only give you 4 solutions that might help you.

1.) Use a new character

2.) Check if your pc needs needs some updates. (Drivers and the such)

3.) Do a system restore to when it worked properly.

4.)Make your own server??"

HELP ME PLEASE ! "
,miguelsz3,2011-07-01T21:19Z,Ok so you've installed both xna and .net?...... Have you updated both of em or at lease reinstalled them? If that didnt work restart your comupter. That should fix it tell me if it doesnt and I'll look into it a bit more.
,sdnl1j2,2011-07-01T23:53Z,you can also play online with gameranger (google it)

,miguelsz3,2011-07-02T14:16Z,"Alright gimme some more info on your error then. The only guess I got Is that the installer's within the Unleashed folder have somehow become corrupt. Ok follow these instructions. 

1.) Uninstall both .Net and XNA

2.) Restart your computer

3.) Download and install these make sure you install .Net first.

.Net

,Kimoshu,2011-07-02T16:16Z,"Thanks! I didn't know about the XNA install. I installed just the first .net framework, after I installed both at your last link it worked for me.

 It says you dont have Xna installed properly... Follow the links I posted."
,cpanda,2011-07-03T17:34Z,Hey I'm guessing this is a patch/update so my prior install of Terraria should be fine ... but should I update with 102-104 first?  Stupid question I know.
,miguelsz3,2011-07-03T18:26Z,"Its not a patch its extract and play. You could just as easily delete the contents of the Terraria folder and paste these inside and it'll still work fine. =/

And no you dont need previous versions for this one to work."
,cpanda,2011-07-03T20:34Z,Hey thanks very helpful.  I just thought the file size was a little small but I guess it doesn't have the .net and that other exe with it so thank you.

,pizzaparty101,2011-07-17T00:14Z,Ad-Aware certainly finds a coin mining app when this program is used. It places it in the 'C:/User//AppData/Roaming/' and even calls it Bitco or some such name. It is reintroduced every time the Tarraria.exe is run.

I find it funny that you mention bitmining in your comment but do not know what a bit coin is, and the word bitmining isn't mentioned by anyone else. Only someone who knows about bitcoins would know what that is....
SKETCHY, no dl for me"
,pizzaparty101,2011-07-17T23:22Z,"As this is the only version I downloaded I'm certain it's the offender. Regardless of the quality of AdAware, the Bitcoin program certainly appears directly after the Terraria.exe is used in the folder I designated. And it is true that no one used the term ""bitmining"" but you, the common phrased used to describe this sort of malware."
,miguelsz3,2011-07-18T01:48Z,"The reason I mentioned bitmining is cuase it was mentioned in another version so I thought maby you confused it with that one.
