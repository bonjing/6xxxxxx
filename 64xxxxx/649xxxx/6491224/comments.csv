You can ignore the Crack.zip, the only files you need are ""FinalCutProX.toast"", ""Compressor.toast"", ""FCPContent.dmg"" and ""ProAppsQTCCodecs.dmg"".


Follow these instructions exactly:

1) Log into the Mac App Store and download any free app, such as Twitter
2) Go into you Applications and locate the Twitter app, right click and select ""Show Package Contents""
3) In the ""Contents"" folder, copy ""_CodeSignature"" ""_MASReceipt"" and ""CodeResources""
4) Open the FinalCutProx.toast file
5) Drag the Final Cut app into your Applications folder
6) Right click the Final Cut app and select ""Show Package Contents""
7) Navigate into the ""Contents"" folder, delete ""_CodeSignature"" ""_MASReceipt"" and ""CodeResources"" and paste in the ones from the Twitter app
8) That's it! Final Cut is ready to use!

To install Compressor, simply repeat steps 4 through 8 with the Compressor.toast file

To install Bonus Content, open up the individual .dmg files and run the files contained within "
