Let me know which aspect ratio/dimensions you all prefer. I am interested to know. I have checked this cropped 16x9 encode and it looks great. Everything is larger on my small screen and the left and right side cropping does not seem to make me feel like I am missing anything."

instead of cropping why dont you try changing the resolution.... 2.35-> 1.77
yeah the people will look alittle tall but no one misses any detail in the movie... you will still have full screen in your device"
,k3nd00d,2011-06-29T07:26Z,Having bad a aspect ratio and stretching everything is not something I would ever do. If I download a video like that I delete it immediately. Bad aspect ratios drive me mad. ;-)
