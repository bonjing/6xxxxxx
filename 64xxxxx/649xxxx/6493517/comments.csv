,Cucamonga,2011-08-25T04:35Z,"acfreema, try VLC player or Media Player Classic from KL Codec Pack. Both work fine with MKV. By the way, MKV is more versatile container than others. Several audios and several subtitles in a single file."

Did you peform IVTC? Because if not this a complete waste of bandwidth...
Proper framerate should be 23.976..."
,reeldeel,2011-09-18T12:10Z,"Downloaded one episode to check it. The framerate is 25, so it's PAL (no need for IVTC). Resolution is 720x496 (original DVD is 768x576). This is a 4:3 episode.
Quality is not bad. 8/10."
,Cucamonga,2011-11-12T16:04Z,"It's 4:3 in seasons 1 to 4. From 5 to end, is widescreen."
,Handicapped_Ent,2012-05-06T08:11Z,"Absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much! Love MKV. Wasn't happy with the subs but they are removable. Just get mkvtoolnix. And as for syncing issues I use Media Player Classic and while an episode is paused hit O, go to Internal Filters, select Audio Switcher, and Check ""Audio Time Shift (ms)"" and set it to 120 ms. Works great for me.

Keep it up!"
,Handicapped_Ent,2012-05-09T10:24Z,"Now that I think about it... I hate you Cucamonga. The X-Files is my favorite series of all time and now that I have every episode available I'm gonna be able to finish it. And after I finish it I won't have anything new to fill my time. :(  I used to be into Lost until I finished the series, now I don't care for it. I can't allow this to be the case with The X-Files. I'll just watch until the last episode and not finish it. Yeah, that'll be like me trying to quit drinking... NGH."
