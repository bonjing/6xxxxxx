Computers are the place for children. This is the place where they can sharpen their agility as well as their abilities. They can learn and make new friends. Whatâ€™s more, the Internet provides information for homework assignments. So far, so good. But they also need to be protected from the computerâ€”for one thing, so that they donâ€™t lose their sense of time and forget to go out and play with their friends once in a while, and for another, because of the dangers lurking on the Web. Thatâ€™s why responsible parents everywhere install Child Control on every computer that their children use.New! Internet Remote Control: Starting with Child Control 2009 you can modify the most important settings or view session logs directly on the Internet. No matter where you are. No matter which browser you are using. This feature is part of the Online Functions.
