::  :     Auckland's metal onslaught In Dread Response need no            :  ::
::  :     introductions, every metal fan in the country already has the   :  ::
::  :     band's name on their lips ... Their 2008 Deadboy Universal      :  ::
::  :     Records debut album 'From The Oceanic Graves' propelled the     :  ::
::  :     and to the forefront of the New Zealand metal scene, became a   :  ::
::  :     label best-seller and secured many loyal fans both at home and  :  ::
::  :     internationally.                                                :  ::

::  :     Having toured Europe with other acts as well as headlining      :  ::
::  :     shows in New Zealand and Australia with previous line-ups,      :  ::
::  :     this year the band's current line-up is due to hit the          :  ::
::  :     international touring circuit in support of their forthcoming   :  ::
::  :     release, "Embers In The Spiritless Void", due out on the 16th   :  ::
::  :     May 2011.                                                       :  ::

::  :     This sophomore album has taken every sonic element from their   :  ::
::  :     previous releases and intensified them, making this In Dread    :  ::
::  :     Response's heaviest and most accomplished work yet. Each song   :  ::
::  :     is akin to a groundswell of ferocity with Corey Friedlander's   :  ::
::  :     ceaseless double-kick driven cannon fire being propelled        :  ::
::  :     forward by Steve Boag's bass onslaught and Sean                 :  ::
::  :     O'Kane-Connolly's unrestrained lyrical passion delivered in     :  ::
::  :     his harsh and searing vocals, supported on some songs by a 16-  :  ::
::  :     strong 'Dread Choir', who add even more intensity to the        :  ::
::  :     absolute pandemonium. All the while chief songwriter and lead   :  ::
::  :     guitarist, Trajan Schwencke, offsets the death metal brutality  :  ::
::  :     with a pleasantly overwhelming maelstrom of organised sound     :  ::
::  :     delivered through towering guitar solos and heartfelt riffs -   :  ::
::  :     courtesy of fellow axeman Ross McDougall - which clearly pays   :  ::
::  :     homage to the legacy of metal's godfathers, albeit with a more  :  ::
::  :     modern twist.                                                   :  ::

::  :     With an award for best New Zealand metal video already under    :  ::
::  :     their belts for the single "Cannons at Dawn", and having        :  ::
::  :     performed to a crowd of thousands in support of guitar legends  :  ::
::  :     Slash, Jennifer Batten, and power metal supergroup Hail!,       :  ::
::  :     featuring Ripper Owens and Scott Travis of the legendary Judas  :  ::
::  :     Priest, In Dread Response are now set to bring their            :  ::
::  :     relentless energy and live show to metal fans worldwide. So if  :  ::
::  :     you haven't started preparing for the impending "Dreadstorm"    :  ::
::  :     then you better start now as once it hits international shores  :  ::
::  :     there will be nothing left in its wake but "Embers In The       :  ::
