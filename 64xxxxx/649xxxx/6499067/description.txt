Although best-known as a singer/ dancer, Chris Brown has been testing out his rapping skills for quite some time. With the release of "Look at Me Now," the 21-year-old strips his latest single from "F.A.M.E." of singing altogether; instead, the track is filled with tight, quick-flowing punch lines and bruising verses by hip-hop veterans Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne. Although Busta's bullet-time contribution is worthy of a dropped jaw, Breezy is no novice on the microphone and also spits rapid rhymes with a few witty lyrics sprinkled in. The mesmerizing beat is juxtaposed with a simple yet alluring melody, and the combination is lethal as a whole. Whether as a result or in spite of recent headline-grabbing adversities, Brown has everyone looking at him now-and with this single, he'll be sure to keep their attention.
