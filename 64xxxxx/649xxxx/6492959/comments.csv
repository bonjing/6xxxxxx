Could it be a corrupt upload?"
,zerzevat3,2011-06-27T21:33Z,"It s a cam. Quality is good for a cam but not a TS.

a/v = 2/2"
,TheFonzOfTorrentz,2011-06-28T14:39Z,Its real so shut up you morons. You are a bunch of inexperienced people who are new to torrents. And if not i feel sorry for you. This is real.
,TheFonzOfTorrentz,2011-06-28T14:44Z,@zerzevat3 Are you aware TS is recorded by a camera so. You sound like a dumb shit.

They didn't say it was recorded by cam did they? "
,esspeez,2011-06-30T20:19Z,They were saying it's not a TS like it states in the title

,DrMemory666,2011-07-10T07:04Z,"I grow tired of Cam's labeled TS.  TS stands for TeleSynch, also called a film chain.  It's what a TV station uses to show a film on the air.  It's not a guy in the audience with a camera.  But everybody slaps ""TS"" on anything."
