[b]BIG Extreme Makeover Complete Season 1[/b]

Share intimate stories as clinically obese and overweight people seek to reinvent themselves and regain their former selves. With help from doctors, dieticians and fitness experts, this is not a reality competition, but a journey over months to take charge and slim down.

Six morbidly obese people are given a second chance at life. For 10 months, weight-loss expert and trainer Lee Campbell will be there 24/7, giving them no escape and no option to back out. This epic transformation will not only totally reshape these people's physical appearances but will also completely alter their inner perceptions, their relationships and, most importantly, their outlook on life.

Some of the episodes need multiple avi files because the youtube uploads were of different quality.[/b]
