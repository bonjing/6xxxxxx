Marc Bolan (born Mark Feld; 30 September 1947 â€“ 16 September 1977) was an English singer-songwriter, guitarist and poet. He is best known as a solo artist, and previously, for founding British rock band Tyrannosaurus Rex (later renamed T. Rex). His music, as well as his highly original sense of style and extraordinary stage presence, helped create the glam rock era which made him one of the most recognisable stars in British rock music.
