,shikibane,2011-07-10T09:42Z,@strangeflow2 i will be upload disk 2 within the next week or so i think its going to come out better to as iv'e figured more stuff out since i made this.
,shikibane,2011-07-12T21:55Z,I'm Putting alot more work into the second disk i expect it to be done soon guys. im designing the menus way way better and improving certain things i think the second disk will be the better one of the two.

,shikibane,2011-11-04T09:21Z,i had the second disk made but due to unfortunate events it got deleted off my hardrive before i could upload it i'll haveto remake it from scratch sadly. when it is made i assure you it will be at least 10 times better than disk 1 in terms of quality and menu desin i set the bar way higher for disk 2 hopefully i can remake it the sameway again i liked how it came out b4 it mysteriously got deleted. One more thing id like to add disk 2 will probably be on a dual layer dvd  everything looks better and is higher quality so i need more space.
