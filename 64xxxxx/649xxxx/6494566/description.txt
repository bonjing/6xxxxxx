 The serial killer is dubbed 'Stoneman' by   
 the media has just claimed his fifth victim 
 and the case is still of little interest to 
 the Bombay Police. But to suspended sub-    
 inspector Sanjay Shelar, this killer poses  
 an opportunity. Sanjay hopes to track this  
 killer down and thus, possibly find an entry
 back into the police force. With the secret 
 aid of his patronizing superior AIG Satam , 
 Sanjay takes up the arduous process of      
 tracking this killer down. But the official 
 police investigator of the case Inspector   
 Kedar Phadke clashes incessantly with Sanjay
 as both of them, separately, delve deeper   
 into the case. Sanjay on the other hand is  
 determined to find the stoneman. He takes   
 the help of his informer. His wife Manali is
 upset with him and thinks that he is having 
 an affair with another woman. Sanjay goes on
