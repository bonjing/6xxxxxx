,.KATAsTrOphE.,2011-06-28T18:00Z,Why 2 720p rips........do a 720p and one 1080p.....
[T],ILPruny,2011-06-29T10:29Z,"Quality excelent, MitZep do a great thing with these H264 releases, because 720p under 1gb in not highdef.
+1 mate"
,tony419,2011-06-30T01:21Z,"@ILPruny
720p under 1g is still amazing quality, especially when i watch a movie on a 40"" HDTV. I haven't seen any movie on H264, or 1080p. What is the difference? Kickass does an amazing job too."
[T],ILPruny,2011-07-01T18:06Z,"Kickass is great encoder, but 900kbps for 720p is not enough if you want hidetails.(just watch his encode Transformers)"
,Deadly_NZ,2011-07-12T11:59Z,And yet another so called movie file with a hidden payload.  Took me 2 hours just to get it deleted from my computer.  Crashed Explorer everytime I tried to open the dir it was in Crash City.
