If not the studio version, I'm trying to find a copy of that leak from a month ago, but the few people who've gotten it seem to be torrent illiterate or just keeping this gold to themselves. Any torrents I've found are either X&Y with the title changed to Mylo Xyloto or just some stupid .rar that only leads to the same stupid survey pages that get you nowhere, and even the rare website that offers something that is sadly another concert version.

If anyone has any idea of how to get ahold of someone with the album and get it to me, I will gladly post a torrent. Or they could do it themselves and save me the trouble. :D"

This is a concert version. To be honest, the Studio Version most probably won't leak since I remember reading online they've taking extra precautions. But seriously, you should wait and buy the Album. I find it immoral to not buy something you enjoy. :) "
