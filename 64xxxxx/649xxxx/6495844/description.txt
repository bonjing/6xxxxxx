Blitz Planner is a small, stable and fast time scheduler for 32 and 64bit Windows operating systems. You can select one of the 8 total possible actions, which will be triggered either after the given time had elapsed, or at the exactly specified time of day. Also you have the option to repeat the task until halted manually. The program supports both 24-hour and 12-hour time notations and can be minimized to the Tray Bar, thus occupying no space at the system\\\'s taskbar. No installation is 
necessary.
