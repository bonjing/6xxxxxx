Would you, by any chance, be able to tell us when the Release-Lounge H264 releases for Insidious, Rango and Rio will be uploaded?

Many thanks and keep up the great work!"
,spurs4ever,2011-06-25T14:43Z,And Arthur too (Release-Lounge H264 version)
[V],neon,2011-06-25T15:04Z,@spurs...theres a few Release-Lounge encoders and im not sure whats getting encoded by them right now....i think they will wait for the rango...rio...blurays to get released....always worth the wait though :)
