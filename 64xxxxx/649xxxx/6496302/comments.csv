,davidtcf,2011-09-09T05:09Z,"the video file and .srt file needs to be the same, then subtitle will appear."
,huykorea,2011-09-24T09:09Z,thank you verry much!
,Rix-kun,2011-10-20T10:12Z,is this uncensored?
,bbatmanx3,2011-10-27T12:06Z,"Thank you for the uploaded. I've downloaded it and watched it.
The duration/runtime of this movie is definitely 1hr and 53 minutes.
Also, this is CENSORED. I'm not sure if this was cut or uncut. But they never really showed the females private part directly."
,Spinfx,2012-01-09T11:30Z,"Thanks for the upload. The subtitles, however, leave much to be desired. Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful there's something, but the subtitles read pretty much like a direct literal translation. It's like reading Shakespeare translated by a middle schooler into your native language: you can understand the gist of it, but it's crude as hell and you're bound to miss out on a lot of the subtle stuff."
,Hankenstein,2012-03-16T23:35Z,"Yes, it is unfortunately censored using big blocks of pixels for anything explicit.  Darn.  I should have read all the comments first. "
