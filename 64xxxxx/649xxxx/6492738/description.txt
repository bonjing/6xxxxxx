Summary People v. Squirrel
 
Secret Squirrel is on the job, and needs to get a special spy gadget out. He keeps it where he keeps everything he needs, 
inside his trenchcoat. As he whips the coat open, the 

woman he was trying to help screams and collapses. Secret looks at her oddly, saying "Wait, I didn't even pull it out yet!" 
Back at the office, Phil enters his office to find it has been burgled, plundered, and purloined â€“ "Ha-ha... loins." 
He's missing a number of things only he can see, such as a 

baby grand piano and a fourteen foot golden Buddha. When they are not returned even after he covers his eyepatch, 
he sets up a color coded threat system and installs security 

cameras.

Birdman tries to talk to the paranoid Phil, but he accuses him of supporting the thief, and of not working hard. 
He tells Harvey he must get a big case by the end of the day, 

and Harvey tries, with limited success. Phil calls everyone in and bumps up the terror level to... BLACKWATCH PLAID!!!

Harvey speaks with Secret, who explains his case to him. Phil finds a video of Bear moving about at high speeds 
and calls everyone in, believing he knows who the culprit is, 

and shows everyone a sketch of Bear crossed with Osama bin Laden. He raises the threat level to the maximum: 
the cover of Rush's seminal album Moving Pictures.

In court, Harvey explains to everyone how Secret hides his spy equipment in his trenchcoat, although he has to 
endure Mentok saying "I'll say" to anything that could be 

considered a double entendre. Phil, however, has surveillance video that proves Secret actually was flashing 
the woman, and is guilty.

At the end, the gang tries to figure out how to get their privacy back. Peanut's video of Phil playing Little 
Bo Peep with a woman apparently fixes things.

Notes:

The episode title is a reference to the tartan of the Black Watch regiment. 
Most of the animation used in this episode was re-used from earlier episodes, mostly "Deadomutt 1" and "2", 
as well as a few clips from "Shaggy Busted" and "SPF". The only 

original scenes were of Phil trying to open his door and any live action footage. This was a trick older 
cartoons would sometimes use to cut animations costs, this episode 

being a clear parody of that.

Summary Inch High v. Firm
 
Inch High P.I. is fired because all of his photos are poor quality due to their perspective being from an 
inch off the ground. He goes to Harvey for representation, but 

something's come up, and he's ignored for much of the episode. 
Harvey has joined a new spa, and a voluptuous red-head named Gigi works there, making out with every other 
guy in the place. He asks her out, and she suddenly moves into his 

apartment, along with her friends Vince and Terry. Harvey's relationship with Gigi continues, but they 
never as much as kiss, while she's found in compromising positions with 

every other male in the office.

Inch High's case finally makes it to court. There, Mentok uses Reducto's shrink-ray to bring Inch High up 
to normal height. After having a carnie tell him (several times) that 

he's tall enough for a ride, Inch High proceeds to show a tape of Gigi writing in her diary that she 
loves Harvey. The two embrace, and Mentok declares that he has no idea what 

just happened, and randomly gives the verdict of not guilty. The episode ends with a wedding between 
Gigi, Harvey, Phil, Vince, Terry, Peanut, and the Bear. Plaintiff Inch 

High, Private Eye 

Representative- Harvey Birdman 
Defendant- Finkerton Detective Agency

12 The Devlin Made Me Do It Richard Ferguson-Hull April 24, 2004 625-011 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Bobby v. Devlin
 
A kid tries to imitate Ernie Devlin's deep ravine jump, and seriously injures himself. The family sues Devlin, 
and Harvey is called to defend him. Things don't look good after 

Birdman almost kills the kid trying to prove he can move. Freezoid's case doesn't help much either. 
After a discussion with Devlin, Harvey reveals that Devlin has pumped himself so full of pain killers from 
all his injuries that he had little to no common sense. He gives a 

plea of insanity, but Der Spuzmacher, a Tapir assassin that Devlin warned about earlier and Harvey disregarded 
as insane rambling, comes in and reveals that insanity pleas can 

only be used in a criminal case. Birdman loses, but Devlin and Bobby come to an agreement. Bobby can ride 
Devlin's bike whenever he wants... and his woman.

A side story that was removed left a few fragments. Avenger apparently lays an egg, and after a brief 
discussion between Harvey and Peanut about the whereabouts of the eagles 

genitals, the two are interrupted by Devlin's entrance. Later in court Harvey is seen nursing an Egg 
with an eagle hand puppet, and finally at the very end of the episode, it 

turns out the egg was the hidden lunch of Peter Potamus, who tried to take the egg back and is brutally 
attacked by Avenger. In an odd turn of events, the egg hatches to reveal 

a half bird half Jesse Jackson.

Notes:

The title of the episode is a reference to Flip Wilson's catch phrase "The Devil made me do it!"

13 High Speed Buggy Chase Richard Ferguson-Hull May 2, 2004 625-013 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary People v. Buggy
 
A television changes from one channel to another, all of them showing a breaking news story. 
It's a high speed chase, involving Speed Buggy, a living car. The chase ends as 

Speed Buggy attempts to climb the median "on foot." 
Back at the office, Avenger resigns. He goes off to find another job and joins up with Vulturo, 
whose avian colleague was recently stuffed. Meanwhile, Harvey goes through a 

series of assistants, including a European goldfinch, an emperor penguin and an emu. Finally, 
he settles on a parrot.

The Speed Buggy case comes up, and it's Birdman vs. Vulturo. The parrot, however, ends up working 
for Vulturo. Avenger returns to Birdman's side, opening a door and revealing 

that Mark and Debbie, Speed Buggy's friends who have been making out through most of the episode, 
have been sitting on Speed Buggy's remote control. Debbie's automotive double 

entendres have been causing Speed Buggy's erratic behavior. He is found not guilty.

---------------------------------------------------
Summary Ding-a-Ling v. Twiddles
 
After years of getting his powers from the sun, Harvey notices a mole that resembles Frida Kahlo on his face, 
and Peanut suggests he has it looked at. He goes to a doctor, who 

suggests he wear SPF-710 sunblock and keep in the shade. This is a problem since Harvey gets his 
energy from sunlight. He manages to get by without the sun by using "Tanning 

CrÃ¨me" (a foreign branding joke) he gets from Peanut. The energy rush causes Harvey to quickly 
become addicted to the stuff, needing it just to stay awake, and that's when 

Peanut starts charging exhorbitant prices for it. 
Harvey goes to trial, representing Ding-a-Ling Wolf; Ding-a-Ling wanted to make a web site for all his fans, 
but Harry Twiddles had already set up a porn site at the URL 

www.dingaling.biz. Harvey brings before the court a number of others whose names had been hijacked for porn sites, 
including: Hi-riser, Big Duke & Bigger Duke, Kwicky Koala, 

Schnooker, The Magic Rabbit, Fluid Man, Dirty Dawg, Mother Load, and Galtar... and his Golden Lance.

An intervention is staged for Harvey by all the others (who are indulging in addictive activities themselves, 
including smoking, gambling, and drinking). Harvey goes into 

counseling, and is soon back to normal. Afterwards, the mole is found by Peanut to just be gravy. 
The episode ends with a PSA by the cast of the show on skin cancer and 

coconuts stuck in hippo mouths.

Notes:

This was the first episode animated using Macromedia Flash. 
The naked woman on the website's homepage was a compilation of classical nude paintings. 
Harvey's counselor is Jesse Jackson, as he appeared in the episode "Very Personal Injury."

Summary Jetson Family v. Earth
 
In the far off year of 2002, the Jetsons live in their luxurious, futuristic house high above the Earth's surface. 
Their lives are suddenly turned upside down when the water 

level begins rising at an alarming rate. Global warming caused the ice caps to melt, and the Earth to become 
nothing but water. Suddenly, mutants begin breaking into the house, 

which is unable to get high enough to be out of the water's reach. 
Fortunately, they manage to make it to the distant past (2004), specifically to Harvey's office. 
Much to their dismay, they realize they have to walk to Harvey's desk from the 

entrance as there are no moving conveyer belts on the floor. The long journey takes them all night 
and they lose Astro to exhaustion (though he recovers) and Judy to a pack of 

dogs.

They tell Harvey that they want to sue everyone for screwing up the earth for them. The case goes to court, 
but George has a problem with the jury. X sets up the Jury Vac, a 

robotic jury that has the Apple startup sound when plugged in, and the trial is underway. Mentok clashes 
with boy genius Elroy, who has a device from the future that tells him 

past events before Mentok does them. Freezoid uses his powers of cold on the warm August day to show 
how global warming is preposterous. In the end, Jury Vac gives the 

verdict... on the O.J. Simpson trial.

Somehow, the Jetsons lose the case, and return to their own time using the Delorean from the Back to the 
Future movies, as rising water levels surround Harvey and the gang. 

Everyone has a hearty laugh.

 Plaintiff- George Jetson 
Representative- Harvey Birdman

------------------------------------------------------------
Summary People v. Ape
 
Grape Ape comes out to compete in the Laff-a-Lympics. He goes through his ribbon dancing routine flawlessly, 
but when he takes a bow, all manner of pills, including steroids, 

fall from his uniform. 
Harvey walks into his office to find a giant urine sample waiting for him. Phil comes in with the 
Laff-a-Lympics committee, who begin to steal things from Harvey's office, 

something they continue to do through the whole episode. Phil hopes to get the Laff-a-Lympics to 
come to their city. He has a big night planned with all of them and Gigi, his 

(and Harvey's... and everyone else's) shared wife. Gigi comes in, and she's pregnant. She claims 
Harvey is the father, though he doesn't recall their ever engaging in sexual 

congress and they've only recently met.

Harvey and Reducto have a nice chat about the whole situation, as well as the Grape Ape case that 
they're both working on. Reducto sees the giant primate, and shrinks him down 

to fun-size. Grape Ape then grabs a weight and pumps it until he grows back to his normal size, 
which sends Reducto off screaming about how he's met the unshrinkable.

The courtroom has been splattered with ads. Gigi interrupts the case to leech off Harvey, but 
upon his return he speaks with a few unnaturally muscular witnesses who all claim 

Grape Ape had nothing to do with steroids. Reducto's witness describes the side-effects of steroids use, 
including withered testicles, which Reducto seizes upon since Grape Ape 

should show reproductive organs the size of a nearby vendor's pushcart. An expert is about to reveal 
the test results when he is hit by a dart in the neck by Harvey's new 

paralegal, son of a shaman/member of the Laff-a-Lympics committee.

Eleven of the jury members vote "guilty", but the French member votes "not guilty". Mentok 
disregards this and convicts Grape Ape anyway. The doctor wakes up from the dart, and 

reveals that Grape Ape is the father of Gigi's baby. Also, the Laff-a-Lympics go to Dallas. 
Grape Ape and the others have to perform a court-ordered song about drugs as a 

sentence.

 Plaintiff- N/A 
Representative- Myron Reducto

17 Peanut Puberty Richard Ferguson-Hull June 6, 2004 625-017 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary People v. Doggie
 
During a board meeting of Sebben & Sebben, Peanut's light shield starts growing uncontrollably, 
much to his embarrassment. He is going through "superty", the period in which a 

young superhero acquires his superpowers, and resents Harvey's efforts to help him. 
Meanwhile, Augie Doggie comes to Harvey for help. They've put his father in a cage, claiming 
he bit someone. The case goes to trial, and Mentok claims Doggie Daddy is baring 

his teeth, and sentences him to undergo aggressiveness training. Phil trains him, treating him like 
a normal dog and completely humiliating and torturing him.

Harvey seeks advice from Apache Chief, Batman, and Reducto, but they don't help much. What finally 
does the trick is Peanut's conversation with Black Vulcan about his first 

time (fighting a villain). In the background you can see Race Bannon and Dr. Quest playing baseball 
and football. Meanwhile, Harvey is speaking with villains about helping 

Peanut with his first time, and finally gets one to comply: X. In return all he wants is the Crest 
on Birdman's helmet. Birdman agrees to the deal to help Peanut.

Phil brings Doggie Daddy into the office, having completely broken him. Now, he is nothing but a 
mindless dog (although in later episodes, he is back to normal). X comes to 

collect the Crest, and just as Harvey is about to give it to him, Peanut comes in with Metallo, 
his new villain friend. X asks if he can still have the Crest... and Harvey 

proceeds to blast the bejeezus out of him. Everyone has a hearty laugh.

 Plaintiff- N/A

18 Gone Efficien...t Richard Ferguson-Hull June 13, 2004 625-018 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Yakky Doodle Name Change
 
To generate more money Phil hires an efficiency expert named Dvd (formerly David; he took out the vowels 
to save time, which Phil regards as brllnt). A new regime of efficiency 

is sweeping Sebben & Sebben, and one of its major parts is to keep only the top three earners. 
Harvey has to keep up with the new policy to keep his job, and watches as Phil 

dismantles his office. 
Dvd fires Harvey's secretary Debbie, replacing her with a PDA the Supercalifragilisticexpiefficaceous. 
Harvey can't figure it out, but X, who's waiting outside to kill him, 

manages to work it fine. He's sent off to search for Yakky Doodle. Meanwhile, the efficiency changes 
are getting worse. Visitors to the men's room can only use one sheet of 

toilet paper, and Harvey's office has been sublet to a Greek restaurant, which Harvey must work at 
along with his legal duties.

X finally finds Yakky, who wants to change both his names. Reducto opposes the idea, though not even 
he knows why. The case goes to court, and the guy before Harvey takes an 

unbelievably long time. He has to wait to the next day to start the case. Peanut tells Harvey he 
needs to work at the restaurant, and that he should have plenty of time while 

he copies the form he forgot to bring with him.

At the restaurant, Harvey "accidentally" gives Dvd Ouzo instead of water, and Dvd gets completely bombed, 
shouting amongst a crowd of people "Who's got efficient nipples?!" In 

the meantime, and for no apparent reason, the court orders Yakky to undergo chemical castration, 
which he takes as his new name.

 Plaintiff- Yakky Doodle 
Representative- Harvey Birdman 
Defendant- N/A

19 Droopy Botox Richard Ferguson-Hull July 18, 2004 625-019 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Dog v. Surgeon
 
Droopy Dog is suing his plastic surgeon for malpractice after he received an overdose of botox that 
has left his face essentially frozen. Though the case seems open and shut, 

Harvey produces an indemnity waiver signed by Droopy and wins the case. The surgeon is overjoyed 
and gives Harvey a surgery coupon catalogue. Phil and everyone else around the 

office give Harvey their highest praises but the gratitude is lost on him and he still feels guilty 
at Droopy's unfair loss and remaining predicament, especially after he sees 

the dog crying and the image sticks with him. 
Harvey is promoted to vice president of Sebben & Sebben and is given numerous executive privileges; 
his coupons are doled out by Phil, whose recent LASIK has left him with a 

second eyepatch, blinding him. X is mistaken for the interior decorator Phil hired to spruce up 
Harvey's office and redoes it as a huge deathtrap. Harvey tries to solve his 

guilt by sending Droopy a fruit basket, which he cannot eat as his jaw is frozen. X breaks into 
Harvey's apartment and creates another danger area. Harvey receives his huge pay 

and sends it to Droopy, who can actually use it this time.

X sends Harvey an invoice for all his redecoration, demanding either one million dollars or his crest. 
He tries to pay with his new raise but then he remembers he's sent it all 

to Droopy. He decides against his crest and sends X the remaining coupons, which he takes as 
a message that Harvey thinks he's ugly. Desperate for approval, he sets out to use 

the coupons. The surgeon has another malpractice case for Harvey, but Harvey strongly declines him 
and decides to resign to keep his self-respect. Harvey heads to Phil's office 

to announce his decision and finds a huge surprise party Phil has thrown to celebrate all of their 
operations. X runs in seeking Harvey's opinion on his new surgery, which X 

doesn't know hasn't changed his face at all. Even Droopy is happy now that he has so much money. 
Harvey is repulsed by his co-workers' ideals of false beauty but no one cares. 


Plaintiff- Droopy Dog 
Representative- Myron Reducto 
Defendant- Plastic Surgeon 
Representative- Harvey Birdman

20 Guitar Control Richard Ferguson-Hull December 5, 2004 625-020 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary People v. McGraw
 
The episode begins with Quick Draw McGraw attempting to bring in the Dalton Gang (who were wanted 
for card cheating, cattle rustling, and running a crystal meth lab). After a 

short shoot out, Quick Draw pulls out his trade mark guitar, only to be arrested for carrying a 
concealed weapon. Meanwhile, Phil Ken Sebben announces that he is running for 

president and shows Harvey a check signed for $12,000,000,000 (signed by Yngwie Malmsteen) and 
The Guitar Lobby's support. Harvey is requested by Baba Looey to defend Quick 

Draw, which he accepts. In the middle of the first session of the trial, Mentok the Mindtaker 
remembers that he is to attend his nephew's birthday party and takes Harvey and 

Quick Draw with him. Afterwards, the trial proceeds with Hiram Mightor as judge 
(whom Myron Reducto suggests is being bribed by The Guitar Lobby). After a trial filled with the 

general topics involved with weapon rights, Hiram Mightor spits out a miniature version of 
Yngwie Malmsteen (who is seen later sitting with The Guitar Lobby). Meanwhile, Peanut 

and Baba Looey are seen browsing through Quick Draw's guitar collection and Peanut hits and kills 
Baba Looey with one. At the end Quick Draw is announced not guilty. There is a 

celebration for Harvey winning the case and Phil losing the election, at which Peanut fires off 
Quick Draw's pistol at random and watches as it ricochets around the office. 
Notes:

Quick Draw parodies Charlton Heston, who was president of the NRA from 2000-2003, by using his 
type voice in this episode and even saying many of Heston's lines from Planet of 

the Apes and Ben-Hur. 
This episode was played on its premier over and over again for the entire Adult Swim run for the night.
