1983 - No Make Up!
(Vinyl Rip)

No Make Up is Von Zamla's second and last studio album. A very rare item that never saw the light as a CD-release. Only a few vinyl-rips are spread over the web, mostly in bad quality at low bitrates. I found one in FLAC but wasn't satisfied with it since the pitch has been set to a ridiculous high level, also suffering from lost audio information due to some needle jumpings.
Fortunately i got hands on the original vinyl and so i had the chance to create another rip. The horror trip begun as i realized in what poor condition (bad pressing) this album actually was. It took me weeks for a fairly acceptable result.

For those who would like to know the very details:

Global restoration has been done very carefully and only soft settings have been used to preserve as much as possible of the original audio content. Intractable clicks, pops and other disturbing noises are removed manually by Algorithmix reNOVAtor (the most time-consuming steps). 

Hardware:
- turntable: Dual CS 701 (from 1975!) with Shure Ultra 400 pick-up
- amplifier: Accuphase E 206
- soundcard: Soundblaster X-fi Extreme Music

Software:
- audio editors: Steinberg WaveLab 6 / Magix Sequoia 7
- plugins: Algorithmix reNOVAtor / Algorithmix Plugins Bundle (Scratch Free, Noise Free) / Waves (X-Hum, LinMB, L316)

All tracks had been ripped in 24 bit / 96 kHz and after editing down-sampled to 16 bit / 44.1kHz using Magix Sequoia with POW2-Dither.
