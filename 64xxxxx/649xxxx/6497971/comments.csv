,Thatgooey,2011-06-27T06:40Z,You are a life saver jorrell! Can't thank you enough for uploading these every race. Make sure to give him an up!
,rlevis,2011-06-29T13:00Z,"jorrell0733, many thanks for your work.  Can I offer a suggestion for the future, and switch to using VLC to encode the video and select Deinterlace via Bob or Yadif 2x.  This will produce 1080p at 50 fps and the motion will be so much smoother.  The scrolling images showing the qualifying positions etc is almost unreadable at 25fps, and general viewing would be so much better since motor racing is all motion.  Thank you for considering this change.

Even if you limit to 720p it would still look much better at 50fps than it does currently.  Cheers."
