,JzSizzle,2011-06-26T16:25Z,"A movie is bad because it has a single actor or actress you dont like. Forget all the other actors and actresses, and the plot and everything else, that doesnt matter, the fact that Russel Brand means its incapable of being good? I dont think this, but this is th mindset of several of these people. 
IS the movie good or not? IF you didnt like someones acting just say, but dont act as if they are the movie itself."

,k9danglers,2011-07-26T23:38Z,"Seriously! Why mess with a classic. Especially when you put Russell 'Bland' in it. If any of you have had the misfortune to see his stand-up stuff, you'll realise he is devoid of any humor or jokes, and basically spends the whole time slagging off people. Small minded prick. Don't encourage him and don't download this piece of stinking shit. "
,k9danglers,2011-07-26T23:44Z,"To all those complaining about people hating Russell 'Bland', don't you think the lead actor (who basically has to carry a film, more so in this case) is just as important to the overall experience than say the sound quality.

Seriously, he is a very good arguement for euthanasia! Total waste of oxygen!

Glad there is somewhere I can vent this! lol"

Prolly worth watching as Mirrens in it. She be a fine actress... I wonder if bland had to give her a good plaiting to get her to be in it? Do i care? No.

Oy Hollywood, Brands a twat, we have hundreds of better comedians out there, pay someone else those millions of readys.
Mirrens ok in Sir Johns old role, but thats it, only ok. Garners as hollow as ever and as funny as a fart in a space suit.
Bland comedy.... download the original, far funnier. little Dudley Moore has more talent in his little toe than brands got in his whole body."
