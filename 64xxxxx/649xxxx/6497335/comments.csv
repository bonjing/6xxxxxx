,max_planck_no_1,2011-08-09T11:27Z,Is this really 1080 p? No comments from anyone?
,jtrivedi2002,2011-08-16T02:28Z,"This is not 1080. in the video information, the resolution says, 1920x796. 
where it supposed to be 1920x1080 for full HD. "
,Diegus83,2011-08-25T15:15Z,"It is FULL HD, the height is not 1080 pixels because the movie aspect ratio is 2.40:1 (cinema) not 16:9 (TV) so there is no point in encoding the black bars at the top and the bottom, thus saving bit rate and enhancing quality.
Please don't spread FUD and missinformation, try to get your facts straight before posting."

Mkvmerge & TSMuxer reveal that both the video & the DTS 5.1 (which WAS originally DTSMA) have parse errors the entire file length. 

*Matroska parse error /invalid  H264 NAL unit size*"
