This is a re-structure of the Salute your shorts torrent(s) that are available but have sound issues or NO AUDIO. There are still pauses, and skips randomly, but THEY DO NOT make the episodes un-watchable. So far every episode I have watched, played through , even the ones previously I could not get to play with sound NOW play with audio.
