would love to see some old nfl games"
[V],Nepotu,2011-06-28T17:31Z,"You're welcome. I can't upload everything that the people ask. Sorry, bro! I have some NFL games but I don't have enough space in my HDD and my upload bandwidth is very low. Also this site is full of leechers and very few seeders, that don't help me much. But I will try something for you in the future. Thank you for your understanding!"

[V],Nepotu,2011-06-29T23:26Z,@famicom: Also I've never seen these games. This is the reason why I was thinking that will be nice to find all the finals I can and upload it here. Sorry but I should go for one week. So I will not upload any torrent until then. Thanks!
