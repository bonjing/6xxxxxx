SUNRISE â€“ is one of the brightest phenomenons in the history of Omsk rock-scene. In the 90-s itâ€™s the most tour Omsk rock â€“group, one of the most professional & popular in the city, itâ€™s also in success out of the city limits.

It has got a huge quantity of prizes & reviews in musical magazines & periodical press. During 10 years group recorded some studio & concert albums, some clips, it gave countless lively concerts, even with such Â«monstersÂ» as NAZARETH.

Hard -rock was the basis of SUNRISE, which varied and turned out into art- rock.

May be it was connected with the periodical change of staff. The musicians changed, but the pivot of group, its leader-author, virtuoso guitar player & vocalist Max Bushin was always invariable. Thanks to his talent in 1994 group SUNRISE was given the name of Â«Folk bodyÂ».

Itâ€™s a phenomenon in Russia regarding Anglo-language rock â€“group.

It seemed all the ways were open. Producer Valentine Vyatkin, talented TV conductor,

rescued & supported this group in the most difficult moments of their lives, he organized concerts & tours , recordings & interviews. But unfortunately, this tale was with a tragically end. In the night from 1 to 2 July 2001 leader Max Bushin stepped in the window from the 5th floor. It was the bold point in groupâ€™s history.

In spite of all the phenomena SUNRISE didnâ€™t come out the world scene. May be, they were born not in the very time & place, but nothing can be returned. SUNRISE remained the legend of Russian underground forever...
