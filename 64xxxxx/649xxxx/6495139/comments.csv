,lovedragon27,2011-06-26T15:26Z,"after installing vn i started Launcher.exe
it asked 4 the language,
i selected English.
But vn the gameplay started still no sound was there.
Plz help me what to do dude...........????"
[V],gansuk,2011-06-26T22:02Z,"english is added from the game release this is a addon for all the other languages

if you downloaded FEAR.3.REPACK-KaOs
then you should already have english audio

but if u got there older version
FEAR.3-KaOs
then there was a small error about a missing dll codec you can download the fix that DangerDan43257 posted on the repack comments its got simple instructions to follow the same file is also on there site if u want to grab it from there aswell

hope this helps ya sort out audio"

,DangerDan43257,2011-06-27T14:11Z,"theres nothing wrong with the music, it just doesnt start straight away, theres only abit ambiance and shock noises really till u get past the first couple of bits."
,karkar99,2011-06-27T14:31Z,i mean the background music of the game doesn't show up of the game but yeah u can hear the ambiance and shock noises of the game... 
,karkar99,2011-06-27T14:47Z,"yep i play it again about 20 mins just no music background on the game but it has in main menu and cinematic.. u only hear is the bullet gunshot and ur foot step thats it.... no voice of d enemy, no environment sound, no background music...  im not complaining just reporting cuz maybe sum of u has a solution with it... if u have plzzz tell me just not 4 me it also help any1 with same problem as i am.. really appreciate if sumone found a solution.. to kaos and guys so boring a game w/out background music.. "
,DangerDan43257,2011-06-27T15:25Z," im guessing you have the old rip kaos did and not the REPACK. try this little fix 
http://www.sendspace.xxx/file/5jjowz
xxx = com
only other thing i can suggest is turning your antivirus off wile installing because one of there rebuild tools gets deleted as been susspicious somtimes, therefore the game wont rebuild correctly."
,karkar99,2011-06-27T21:28Z,wow it works...  dude just Big Thanks to you... but of course thnx also to kaos for releasing the game... Thank you!!!
