Jamiroquai is a British jazz funk and acid jazz band formed in 1992. Jamiroquai were initially
the most prominent component in the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement,
alongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, the Brand New Heavies,
Galliano, and Corduroy. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as
pop, rock and electronica. Jamiroquai have sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and
won a Grammy Award in 1997

The band name is a portmanteau of "jam session" and "iroquai", based on the Iroquois, a
Native American tribe. The original band was Jay Kay (vocals), Toby Smith (keyboard), Stuart
Zender (bass), Nick Van Gelder (drums), Wallis Buchanan (didgeridoo) and Alec Moran
(pipeau). These are the founding members of Jamiroquai and were involved in the writing and
production of the first album. The lineup of the band has changed several times, and the
longest serving and now core members of the band are lead singer and songwriter Jason
"Jay" Kay and drummer Derrick McKenzie (1994). Kay was the impetus behind the formation
of Jamiroquai, deciding to form the band after an unsuccessful audition to become the singer
of the Brand New Heavies. Despite his self-professed attempts to treat Jamiroquai as a band,
Kay has always been at the forefront of how the group is marketed, and has therefore always
had the lion's share of media attention, to the point where he is viewed as almost a solo artist
