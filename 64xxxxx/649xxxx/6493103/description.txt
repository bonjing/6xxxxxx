This is a very very personal PDF I had to write. 

As a Latino moderate-left wing Democrat I have been recently upset with such racist laws being passed by states. I have openly wrote a PDF documenting on such laws, my opinions, lies in history textbooks and the recent leak of documents by Lulz Security and Anonymous. 

I also talk about the recent revolutions in the Middle East and how those events relate to what's going on in the United States. This is a free-to-read document for everyone. This is licensed under Creative Commons and may be re-used on any website without the consent of the original author. 

If you would like to compliment or criticize me, please criticize me constructively and without any racial remarks. My e-mail account can be found at the end of my PDF document. Long-live free information to everyone.
