Personally, I'm an anarcho-capitalist.  I agree with you on revolution.  I think eventually all governments around the world should fall and everyone everywhere should be free to travel and work anywhere in the world without anyone's permission (other than the landowners where they are staying) and that governments cause discrimination.  Calling on governments to end discrimination is like calling upon them to end war.  Governments are the cause of all war and discrimination.  Free people don't discriminate, nationalists do.  People who praise their country or race, people who call on power to protect them from the freedoms of other peoples, are why we have discrimination.  I wish you good luck on all your future writings and all."
