Nothing special here; Just a simple rip of the old 2CD Raiders bootleg. This was the first set which contained the few short (but very important) unreleased cues, plus the missing half of "Well Of Souls" (previously on the limited OOP LP only). It is in full wav format.

This was kindly requested by a fellow Demonoid member. As soon as this mystery user completes the download, I'm leaving the seeding up to you maggots. I'm kidding, I love everybody in the whole world.


Enjoy and Seed!!
