INSTALLATION:
Extract with winrar or 7-zip (www.7-zip.org it is FREEEEEEEEE)
run the "dfbhd.exe"
play.....is as simple as that.

NOTE: on windows 7 and vista an error will most likely pop up asking for the cd/dvd still.
just press continue, or cancel a few times then the game will pop up and stop asking for cd/dvd
i have no idea how to fix or get rid of that, but the full game still works, just gotta deal with
the annoyance of pressing a button 5 times in a row when opening the game.

*********DELTA FORCE BLACK HAWK DOWN*********

a first-person shooter video-game set during the United Nations intervention in the Somali Civil War , with missions taking place primarily in the Jubba Valley and the Somali Capital, Mogadishu.

CHARACTERS:
The player begins the game as a soldier with Task Force Ranger, taking part in Operation Restore Hope; part of the United Nations-backed humanitarian effort to end the famine in Somalia which had killed 300,000 civilians. Following the third mission, the player assumes the role of a soldier assigned to 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, taking part in Operation Gothic Serpent, a military operation conducted during the Battle of Mogadishu on October 3, 1993. During the latter section of the game, the player controls members of the 3rd Ranger Battalion and 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta, commonly known as Delta Force.

GAMEPLAY:
The game is based on the 1992-93 UN peace missions in war-torn Somalia. The first few missions in the game are designed to make the player accustomed with the different types of weapons, their usage, enemy AI, terrain types and combat techniques. The majority of the missions involve convoy protection, providing security for food distributions, destroying weapon stockpiles, taking prisoners, etc.
The Windows and PlayStation 2 versions of the game have an expansion set called Team Sabre, which features two additional campaigns. One involves missions to shut down a drug cartel in Colombia, and the other involves missions against a paramilitary rebel group in Iran.

*********DELTA FORCE BLACK HAWK DOWN TEAM SABRE*********

expansion pack to Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Team Sabre adds more weapons. The Team Sabre expansion gives the player a new character to choose, the British elite commando unit SAS. Team Sabre adds a few more terrains which are mostly jungle and desert terrains. The expansion pack also gives the player two more campaigns which are in fictional based areas, fighting the renegade general Haatim Jaareah Kalb in the deserts of Iran and the elusive drug lord Antonio Paulo in the jungles of Colombia. The main difference from the original is the difficulty, with fewer saves and longer levels.

COLOMBIAN CAMPAIGN:
Following a Coast Guard discovery of a large shipment of drugs and guns headed for the United States, intel has revealed that a powerful drug lord, Antonio Paulo, is trying to increase his power in parts of Colombia. This drug lord controls entire regions in remote parts of the country and employs many well-armed guerrillas to fight for him in exchange for money and weapons to aid their anti-government cause. He is known for his heavy-handed actions, including the torture of captured Colombian and American soldiers.

IRANIAN CAMPAIGN:
Iran's fundamentalist government has given way to a less hardline administration, friendly to the West. A significant portion of the old guard, appalled with the new government's embracing of economic relationships with the "corrupt, morally evil" western powers, has taken up arms in a second revolution against the state. While government forces aided by NATO troops have managed to keep control of Tehran, fundamentalist rebels have seized control of the oil terminal on Kharg Island and production facilities to the north and Bandar Shahpur. Oil represents three-quarters of Iran's economy and a serious risk to the interests of western investors. NATO and the UN have both agreed that military intervention, led by the United States, is warranted. Delta Force has been tasked with being the spearhead of the coalition forces.
