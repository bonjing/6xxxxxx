Thank you by the way :)"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-12-11T00:33Z,"@piizda if you'd have read b4 posting a comment you'd know why. believe it or not, there are ppl out there that dont know how to extract or what it is. i list it here so they can at least know there is that step and can google it to figure it out. also most ppl dont know which exe files run a game and are scared by trial and error they might mess it up... lol.

i include INSTALLATION instructions to step ppl through the very few steps they have to do.

@EVERYONE ELSE, you're welcome."
