Notez:

Here is the latest full length Scooby Doo

original animated movie nice and early before

it comes out on DVD & BD on September 6!

For some reason Warner posted this streaming

via youtube in some new division of youtube

offering VOD. It had much more hefty protection

on the stream than the average youtube video.

Therefore the only way to get this done was

to screencap the film. The video quality

is quite exceptional for a screen cap if i do

say so myself. Audio is not the best ever, but its

definately not horrible. I simply reencoded the audio

& video to a more standard format, though please

note that without the hard work and effort of

my Scooby'riffic friend Shaggy this would never

even be here at all until it hits stores in 

september most likely! Sample included so u know

what the quality is like before grabbing the whole

film. Enjoy scooby fans!



P.S.

If anyone is somehow able to get their hands on the

source HD stream file that warnerVOD posted, please

get ahold of me and let me know. It would be greatly

appreciated!



P.P.S.

I know imdb lists this film as Attack Of the Phantosaur

but i think they are just not up to date, the dvd/BD

cover announced clearly say legend, as does the title

card in the film, so naturally thats the title i used.

Just wanted to point that out as the imdb link still lists

it as Attack as opposed to Legend!
