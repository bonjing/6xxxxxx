Ram is an album by Paul and Linda McCartney, released in 1971, the only album credited to the pair. It was McCartney's second solo album after The Beatles broke up.

After the release of the successful debut McCartney, Paul and Linda went on a lengthy holiday and spent much time on their farm on the Mull of Kintyre, Scotland. It was during this period that Paul, often with Linda's input, composed the songs that would feature on Ram. The couple flew to New York City in the fall of 1970 to record their new songs. Lacking a working band, they held auditions for musicians, bringing some in under the guise of a session to record a commercial jingle. Denny Seiwell was recruited for drums, David Spinozza and Hugh McCracken were tapped for guitar duties, and Marvin Stamm was featured on flugelhorn on "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Although it was a collaborative project, Linda's vocal duties were mostly limited to backing Paul, who sang most lead vocals. Linda sang co-lead vocals on "Long Haired Lady", however. The sessions also birthed future songs like "Dear Friend," released on the debut Wings album Wild Life later in 1971, as well as "Get on the Right Thing", "Big Barn Red" (opening lines of which can be heard on "Ram On (Reprise)"), and "Little Lamb Dragonfly", all of which would be finished for 1973's Red Rose Speedway.

By early 1971, the project was completed with the non-album "Another Day"/"Oh Woman, Oh Why" single â€” McCartney's first after The Beatles â€” which was released that February and became a worldwide Top 5 hit. In May, Ram was unveiled.

Despite the phase-out of monaural albums by the late 1960s, Ram was pressed in mono (MAS 3375) with unique mixes which differ from the common stereo album (SMAS 3375). These were only made available to radio stations and are among the most valuable and sought-after of Paul McCartney's solo records.
