Fairly decent picture but the audio is a bit echoic and tinny...

,DMiBY,2011-06-27T20:35Z,"Downloading now, seems a fast download. I will comment A/V when it has downloaded."
,DMiBY,2011-06-27T21:56Z,"For cam:

V 7 - Good for camera, after a minute camera balances out.
A 6 - The clarity is fine, at times is hard to understand.

I stopped watching after 8 minutes due to the A/V coming out of sync, not sure whether this is continuos throughout or it fixes, because I stopped.
