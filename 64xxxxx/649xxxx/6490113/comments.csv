,twilight_nexus,2011-06-23T17:54Z,This seems like a great idea !!!
,thruggie,2011-06-23T19:16Z,This is a wonderful idea ...however I do not want to participate in this torrent for as a bulls eye will be on your back for sure on this monster .Good luck and Godspeed.
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-23T20:00Z,"Great effort...
But you may have to seed it till all eternity if you want to keep it alive.

Good luck."
,pqlamz,2011-06-23T21:14Z,"truggie, am I actually running a serious risk uploading this non-anonymously?"
,pqlamz,2011-06-24T18:30Z,"And also guys, BE PATIENT AND PLEASE SEED! I can not stress this enough! This torrent has already had 77 downloads in 1 day and I can't upload quickly to all of you. I've uploaded about 20GB so far and it's frustrating when people quit out, wasting all of that upload. Once we get a few complete downloads going and some proper seeders this will go faster!"
,daanvantilburg1993,2011-07-04T15:10Z,nice I waited for a long time for this pack i will seed
,wombler11,2011-07-12T10:22Z,Hey Mr. Seeder come back. My seedbox is ready to go!!
,wombler11,2011-07-13T09:32Z,"Why does pqlamz put it up if he ain't gonna seed it? Another post and run... Good quality torrent, 30+ leechers waiting to go. Sigh, just need a feckin seed!!"
,pqlamz,2011-07-22T10:55Z,"GUYS! I'm sorry I haven't been seeding... I sort of live in a different country. I'll see if I can get it up and running again within the week, if not I have to wait until December. So..."
,smitty923,2011-08-24T03:20Z,"Any update on whether you will get a chance to seed anytime soon?
Thx"
,zaroba,2011-09-18T17:25Z,"nice collection.

probably be a lot faster to DL all the movies individually though"
,pqlamz,2011-10-12T11:51Z,"Okay, update guys. December 4th is the seeding date, so prepare. I may have small bouts of seeding before that, but only if I'm lucky. Sorry about the bad upload timing, but I'll be able to seed for 2 months after the 4th of December (which should put at least a few copies of this out there for you generous seeders, right?)"
,Eraz,2011-10-23T13:56Z,"Guys I am at 98.1% seeding like hell but I still could not finish my own download.
It is nice to hear that someone will upload after 4th of december for 2 months but if there is someone out there who can seed PLEASE DO SO!!
Like I sad I am seeding but cant get the last part which is 1.9% and I believe there are many people who are waiting at 98.1%."

,liberalul83,2011-11-10T10:47Z,"I'm stuck at 98.1% for two weeks now, this is an incomplete torrent :("
,bunion4,2011-11-12T17:55Z,"Ok people! We can resurrect this torrent! 

Here are some of the incomplete films! Go through the incomplete films and download one or two of them elsewhere (exact same file size and release group). If everyone does this we shall soon have a complete torrent.

For example, i just downloaded 
The Wrestler[2008]DvDrip - CANiBUS.avi and put it in the directory and now im at 98.2%. Every little helps.

"
,bunion4,2011-11-12T17:58Z,If you add a complete film to the torrent post here to let everyone know! We can do this!
,bunion4,2011-11-12T18:02Z,I know im stating the obvious here but you can use the incomplete files in the separate torrent you use to complete it then bring it back into the main torrent.
,bunion4,2011-11-12T19:47Z,"Added Manually: The Wrestler, Chinatown, the wild bunch and witness for the prosecution to boost %. Please help by doing this for a few films, find torrent for same file and copy over the incomplete file then bring it back."
,bunion4,2011-11-12T20:50Z,right im at 98.5 now... you guys all do a few films... PROFIT
,bunion4,2011-11-13T00:38Z,"Manually completed a few more films.. anyone plz do the same.. Dont wanna sound patronizing but all it takes is 1.Find identical torrent but for individual film. 2.Stop this film torrent. 2.Copy incomplete file from this torrent to the 0% complete one in the individual torrent directory, force recheck and complete last few %. Replace incomplete file in top 250 torrent directory with complete, and do a force recheck. Just did this for another few films.. If lots of us do this we dont have to wait till December 4th..."
,bunion4,2011-11-13T13:08Z,I must have added about 20 films manually now.. come on you bastards!
,liberalul83,2011-11-13T19:50Z,"I manage to put 28 of 33 missing files back, i will try to find the next 3 to make the torrent complete again, please share at least 2 weeks ! Thanks ! If you what in the future to use torrent, please share !"
,bunion4,2011-11-15T20:14Z,"Thanks fellow file restorers.. almost there now (99.7%), these are the incomplete files if anyone knows where to find matching copies!

,pqlamz,2011-12-05T09:10Z,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNND we're on the road again! Seeding now, already got 6 guys at 99.9%. Thanks a bunch to all of you who manually resurrected this torrent in the meantime, you guys are the greatest. I should have a solid seed for about 2 months now, which will be plenty of time to push out a few full copies of this and maybe pick up a few dedicated seeders along the way!"
,sparty1981,2011-12-26T08:21Z,Seed PLZ
,NinjaLP,2012-01-29T10:44Z,"PLEASE PLEASE keep this one alive! Seed it! I know there is 38 leechers right now, 10 of you better seed for at least 24 hours. "
,NinjaLP,2012-01-29T16:38Z,Please guys SEED! Once I am done (I am at 22.5 % :( ) i will seed for an additional 24 hours. The whole point of this place is not being just a leecher but a seeder. 
,filmlover364,2012-03-25T20:47Z,Can we get some seeds i have been on 96% for days downloading at 2KBPs uploading at 250. Will leave it in my seed list for at least a month when i have it (will seed to a ratio of 10:1)
