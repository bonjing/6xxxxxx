This is a collection of all 250 movies in the IMDb top 250 as of June 17th, 2011.

There is another text file called 250.txt that has an exact copy of the list at the time it was taken.

All movies are DVDrips to not only keep the size down (I may do a 1080p/720p version if it seems worth it), and also to keep people from complaining on not knowing how to play or having problems with .mkv files (.avi = simplicity).

If there are any unwanted subtitles playing in your movie, just select to have them not play in VLC. There are also a few non-English movies which have hardcoded English subs; if you don't want those you'll have to download your own copy of the movie. However, if there are any English movies with hardcoded subs, please let me know.

I also recommend using VLC for playing them, as it should be compatible with all of the subtitle setups.
