[Hustler.] Alexis Texas (This Aint Star Trek XXX #2: The Butterfly Effect)



Sulu and Chekov try beaming down to the planet without Scotty and end up back in time. Something about time space continuum, too close to a neutron star. Anyway, they end up back in the oval office at the moment Marilyn Monroe is giving the first Presidential hummer.
