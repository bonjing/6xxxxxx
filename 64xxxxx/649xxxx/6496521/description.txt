Anyone who is into the breaks scene will already be well aware of the Y4K Series, and it's continuing release's
of fine mixes. Hybrid are also renound in the genre, and although past release from Mike Truman and Chris
Healings have been known to be lush atmospherics', this Y4K mix is spot on, heads-down-here-we-go breaks.

As far as I am concerned there isn't a bad track on the whole album, well, maybe the last one,
as that is where the mix finishes. So, those who already know the Y4K series will buy this regardless,
those who are just finding the breaks sound should buy this to!
