,Bob__Dole,2011-11-16T08:55Z,"Bad quality (VERY old footage) and mistitled.  This is just kids on small motocross bikes goofing off, sometimes falling off.  NO CRASHES AT ALL!  Some short but nice little jump sequences (natural, no ramps) but nothing at all insane and not the ""world's most"" anything, except disappointing if you were expecting to see motorcycle crashes.

Also nothing on-road at all.  Watching a kid bang into another kid with poor camera, poor res, some even ancient black and white footage.

Thanks TvTeam for making it available, but it isn't worth anyone's time to d/l or watch.  Go to youtube and see a lot better stuff if what I described seems interesting or if you want crashes instead of bleh boring."
