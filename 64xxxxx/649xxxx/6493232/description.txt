Enterbrain has released a new material add-on for RPG Maker VX. It costs 20 dollars though. However, I'm here to save the day by bringing you the add-on completely free!

Info on this pack here: 
http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/product/material/samurai

This pack contains:
Animations: 11 files
Battlers: 168 files - 84 unique files (theres 2 of each battler in here, normal image, then a mirrored image)
Characters: 26 files
Faces: 13 files
System: 11 files
Then theres also a folder called Feel_Free_To_Modify which contains 145 files.

Total Size: 77mb

It also contains "launcher.exe". Using this tool you can quickly add all the new graphics to your project. Simply browse for your project folder and install the graphics you want. Its all in the readme. Everytime you go to use this tool, you must click the "READ ME FIRST" button. Kind of annoying. Or you can just manually add the graphics you desire.

If you would like a direct download to this instead of using the torrent, follow this link:
