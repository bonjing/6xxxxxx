SNES had quite a few awesome games.
Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past & then there's the Mortal Kombat series."

This is an add-on, which you would only need if you had the full program. In which case, you'd already know that it was 2D. Plus, SNES was the heyday of RPG's, so check your whining before you comment. To Drislen, thanks loads!"
