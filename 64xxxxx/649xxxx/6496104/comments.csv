Are you obsessed?

A normal person would go and download torrents he liked, would he not?

I dont like extremezone torrents, I think I can get better quality in a smaller filesize so i dont download his stuff. I dont hang around his page telling him what he is doing wrong, asking him to change to suit me. Is the problem that you can't find an encoder to suit your needs? Maybe 20-40 is mad so what? Are you a psychologist thats going to somehow change him and make him a ""better person""? People are the way they are your comments achieve nothing good. Grow up. And btw I have loads of 20-40 torrents that have been watched by loads of people and nobody said jack shit about the AR and if they did I would go elsewhere like a normal person.

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-26T20:25Z,"Thank you justregged and madtown. As you know, I have hard drive crash and was unable to fulfill old requests. And I have never ever said that I would leave TPB - quite contrary, I have explained that I would migrate on SU - not stop uploading on TPB and corrected many who have not understand my move correctly. I upload just SOME torrents here, as I want and when I find appropriate. These are my torrents and can do whatever I want. 

But, I would continue to tear apart sandboxes for lunatics (as one above demonstrates whenever their meds wear out, if any) - with great pleasure, in sea of my torrents even hundreds are nothing."

,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-29T01:27Z,"From http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/
Definition of: TROLLING

(2) Posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects on newsgroups and chat rooms to bait users into responding.

and from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)
""Do Not Feed The Trolls"" and its abbreviation ""DNFTT"" 
In Internet slang, a TROLL is someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community...with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.

Signalboy is a TROLL, and by inference, so are all the rest of StylishSalH's ""pets"".
DNFTT!!!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-29T07:50Z,"It's not about trolling, it's about common sense. Logic. Dignity. 

Let say that some guy from the street walk in your house during a barbecue you have with your neighbors and you left doors unlocked. Then, same punk put his pants down and take a dump (poop, shit) right in front of you and your friends.

What you gonna do?

a) Step over the shit and pretend it never happened. Shit doesn't smell nice - but you left it there - because it - never happened, right?

b) Hobo would leave eventually. It's not up to you - out there is free world, right? Anybody has god-given right to say or do anything he wants, right? When that hobo grab and ate all food you have prepared for friends and neighbors - he can say that - it tasted bad. You cannot object - it's free world and hobo is entitled to opinion.

c) You can call 911. And you get answer ""Shut the fuck  up. You have a house and hobo have nothing. He has the right!""

d) You call Police directly, explain what's going on and - get answer similar to ""a"", ""b"" or ""c"", and - be ridiculed.

You can left your home forever, because hobo said that he would come back - and you don't want hobo's shit in your living room again. So - it's better for you to leave, right?

Why? Because you are wrong, and every scenario of ones above is right. You are nothing and you have nothing.

They - are right. They own the world."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-29T10:47Z,"What you say is true, twentyforty, but having watched what has been happening on TPB on your torrents for the past year--and actively participated in the defense, I have noticed that nothing ever changes, except in the few instances where the bastards were ignored (actually the Greek word Kolopedo sums up my true feelings for them much better than bastard, but I digress).  

Even TPB staff often seem to be in collusion.  To half-ass quote Hero from Superbay ""Yes, it would take an insane amount of time to check every single new VIP upload to delete abusive comments.""  He either knows nothing of PERL's capabilities, or purposefully is ignoring them--let you be the judge on that one.  Considering that there are only small number of VIP uploaders that regularly are attacked, it doesn't take genius to write a script singling them out, which would flag posts with certain keywords or phrases--hell a novice like me could probably hack one together in a day or two!

At some point in life, you've got to consider that there are some battles that cannot be won (or aren't worth fighting), and bitterly move on.  Had to do that in 1992, and again in 1998, and yet again beginning of this year in my own personal life.  Thought that was what you had done migrating to SU.  Which is why I hadn't been actively monitoring your torrents here.  I will do so in the future however.  Didn't mean to rub a raw spot with my post about trolls.

I deleted dozens of torrents lately, not letting these idiots to play.
Hero Wrote:
 Don't you think that is a little ""too much""?

No I don't.  Of course, that may play into the trolls' hands, as those looking for small movie uploads will then be ""forced"" to turn to their pet Paki ""encoders""--what is it, a vanity thing with these queers?  They're not getting money for how many people download off their seedboxes are they?  Or maybe they are--maybe a different business model applies in India and Pakistan?

Sorry for the ramble.  Moving on now."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-29T13:09Z,"I am not FBI profiler and I wont go in minds of psychopaths and search for motives. I cannot find nothing else then etiquette they hold so proudly and no one (except few, you included) ever have done something to stop them.

I can tell, first hand, that any shit they have written never had any merit. Any merit at all. Why?
Because they are - nobody. In full sense of the word. It sounds ugly - but it is true. Nobody knows who they are, what they have been done, nobody knows from which place their opinion came form, their standards, nothing at all. ""Opinions are like asses."", right?

As end effect, to use ""shit on the carpet"" analogy from my previous comment:

1st) Normal people, would not come in your house anymore. Smell of the shit turns them down, imagine!

2) New neighbors would not come, because they have ""heard how you have stinking piece of shit in your living room""

3rd) In world of skewed reality, defending yourself and your work would push any borderline personalities in ""wrong"" direction, making their inner demons louder than voice of sanity, as in following example:

""On 6/29/11, robin keevil  wrote:

... you can ""see"" how he do not agree - but he agree, repeating verbatim what attacker have been repeating all along. ROFL.
And when I pointed that things - they jumped on all four. ""We are not crazy. You are.""

You have watched old ""I am legend"", right? Day would come when zombies would be considered as ""normal"" and leftover of normal humans as - abnormal, as enemies... On some forefronts, as here, that day is really palpable."

,believenu,2011-06-29T16:00Z,"I agree with both views regarding the trolls .. ignore and they will go elsewhere but they do leave a pile of excerement behind which stinks up the place and make the new neighbours not want to come over.. unfortunatly the ""city hall"" does nothing with the complaints unless they get a single one by one issue to deal with. moving helps but does not solve the stink problem. If you remove the offender as someone has said in forums I can just get a new name and start again. If we just state ""don't feed the troll"" and support, that is, help to clean up the excrement by informing ""cityhall"" perhaps ""city hall"" will change the rules and visit the homes of the people who have been stunk up and with a permanent change put in a policy of no tolerance of the dumping as they have for spam. 
The garbage that has been here is mild compared to the hate comments I have seen on some torrents some actually scare me that this would be allowed on the site for freedom. 
I don't think that there is a true solution.. but I have signed up as a forum member and will now add my views and hopefully some of you will join me in lobbying ""city hall"" for a permanent solution.

 ""Report COMMENT spammers"" thread for what?

 For doing nothing? Repeating straw-man arguments?

 Crazy people must be banned. If they come back - members would report them right here. Than crazies would be banned again. And again. In last few years I reported six-seven people only. It wasn't too much, right?

 Why? Because they are crazy. And I am VIP uploader here.
 Mod's DUTY is to keep site running, and - to serve site and site policy, keep it clean.
 Well, as I said before, only if new site policy is to accept crazies open-handed and drove VIP uploaders away - I am wrong. But, I am not. You are.
