Let it be known Comcast; If you had done nothing, only I would have downloaded this movie and watched it.
Now, at least 100 more people will download it and your network bandwidth is going to facilitate that.

You fucked with the wrong person. Your threats mean nothing. The DMCA means nothing. You cannot stop freedom.
