Ok everyone, listen up. You are now gonna get a huge treat:
Dark Tales, a 273 page scanlation that relieta and I worked hard on for the last few months. It is 35 short stories by Bernet, made over a period of over 20 years, never before collected in one album.

Relieta spend a LOT of time finding good versions in various languages and cleaning them up for this project, before he even started translating. The stories themselves are short, evil stories, following the themes of human depravity, despair, dark humor, and ultimate redemption.
This is not a nice book, it is an evil book, but it's a great read.

Oh, and in case you didnt figure that part out yet, this DO feature scenes that should not be read by minors, dont give it to your kids.
