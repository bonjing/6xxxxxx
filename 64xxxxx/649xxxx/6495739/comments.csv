sir, again a masterpiece work..you are god of 480p rips...

if you didn't mind i want to suggest one thing..please continue 480p rips as lots of people are doing 720p rips but no one is doing 480p as awesome as you do...

it's just a suggestion because the area we live have a limited bandwith and people over here appreciate your work for 480p

THANKS FOR ALL YOUR ENCODES"
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-28T00:54Z,"@critic
I've done Insidious again, and many small sized encodes of TLL are available bro :)

@swift
genuine copy hasn't released yet, will do then. thx man:D

@moonlord
I'n doing all new movie encodes in 480p, but I'm also glad to provide 720p in smallest possible size, all those 720p's are above 650MB.
I can save at least a 200 MB, lol"
