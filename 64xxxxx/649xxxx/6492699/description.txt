    Cathys mother killed her father and tried to kill her when she was       
    ten. Her younger brother, a priest, holds her responsible. Fifteen       
    years later Bob manipulates a clingy, drippy Cathy into falling in       
    love with him. He lures her back to the apartment building of her        
    youth for a so-called work party. There, he and his business partner     
    Monica and a few of their oddly pathetic friends hold Cathy hostage      
    for a few hours before forcing her off the side of the building roof.    
    She becomes one of them, a 'lurker'. The building is supposed to be      
    'hell' and everyone born there is evil and is brought back there to      
    die. Cathy becomes one of the lurkers who floats around town warning     
    other people who the baddies try to get back to the building - Bobs      
    new girlfriend and Cathys priest brother including.
