I have been sifting through the available versions of USB Safely Remove and this one is the most up to date and works as it should with a lifetime updates license.

Now for the security conscious... the extracted executable was scanned with Jotti and VirusTotal and each returned one positive result (in my opinion from the same antivirus vendor for each and almost definitely a heuristic result):

I also scanned the post install USBSafelyRemove.exe and returned one result:

I have since run full scans with Avast! and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and returned a clean scan. I believe the single returned results (1 out of 42 and 1 out of 39) are false positives.

I'm going to monitor with winpatrol for any hidden activity but believe it will be all good."

The correct link is:

file-2436972_exe and USB Safely Remove v 4.6.2.1140 by Moon-Dancer.exe are the same file. The hashes all match.
