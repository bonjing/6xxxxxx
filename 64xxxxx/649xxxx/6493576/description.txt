New in Version 10

NEW
- Program Acceleratorâ„¢
Over time, the many files that make up a program drift apart and become scattered across the hard drive. The new Program Accelerator realigns these program files, resulting in programs that launch faster and respond more quickly.
- CRUDD Removerâ„¢
The new CRUDD Remover detects and displays the redundant programs that can impact PC performance and stability, and then you decide which programs you want to keep or remove.

A new repair feature that fixes damaged or broken Internet connection problems caused by destructive software is now in ActiveCareÂ® and the PC Repair PowerToolâ„¢.
- Whole Homeâ„¢ Licensing
Previously, one System Mechanic license could be installed on up to 3 PCs. Because many people now have more than three computers, System Mechanic is now licensed under the Whole Homeâ„¢ Licensing program, which allows you to use one System Mechanic license on all of the PCs in your household.
