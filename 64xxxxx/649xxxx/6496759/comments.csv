,miketheratguy,2011-08-06T02:28Z,"Quality is excellent, especially for the file size. My previous copy of this film was an 800mb rip by KickASS. I loved the quality of that one- it beat the others I looked at- but I'm a stickler for smaller sizes. Picky, I know.

Point is, I downloaded this version and compared the two and I see little to no difference between the two on my 43 inch tv plasma, despite a 300 MB size difference.

After trying to find the right combination of quality and size, this one's the keeper. I feel sorry for those who flat-out ignore the smaller sizes because they don't realize how fantastic some people can make them look. Thank you!"

Do as said by Daiquirii.
The story is not important but the subtext  underlying in this film is."
