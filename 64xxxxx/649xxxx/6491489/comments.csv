,AusMakka,2011-10-07T10:02Z,Can anyone tell me if these are edited (language taken out) versions or unedited versions?
,josh0223,2011-11-22T18:46Z,"@AusMakka, 
These are TVRIPS (copies of the versions that aired on comedy central). It says HDTV in the description to identify that it is copied from an hd comedy central channel. Hope I could help"
