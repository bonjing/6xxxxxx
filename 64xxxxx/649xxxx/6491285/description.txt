fantastic beautifully surreal show that deserves a proper dvd release, but according to series creator thu tran, \"FP will be released on Ltd edition lazerdisc in year 6666; each copy will have a relic of my skeleton hidden in a totino pizza roll\". ;{

so until then, here\'s all of it!!

web episodes, season 1 & extras are compiled from various sources in flv, mp4, & avi with quality ranging from atrocious to good, but all completely watchable with your trusty vlc player or whatever.

season 2 in mkv h.264 aac 1280*720

note: beginning of ep 202 is messed up but luckily its just a recap of an earlier episode so just skip to 1:30 & should play fine from there

enjoy all u friends & lovers
