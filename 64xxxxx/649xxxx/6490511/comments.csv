,likeke90,2011-06-24T03:29Z,It would help if the information was presented in a more simplistic manner rather than technical jargon. 
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-06-24T07:25Z,"It help me and all pirates if you starts to say tanks for our work!

It is already simple, but this time the upload page was broken so the usual information didn't come in.

Next time I ignore if you don't say tnx, that's is a god jargon"
