Full strength label comp featuring tracks from
Shifting Peaks' first four releases by Emvee,
Hackman, Sekta, and Graphics plus exclusives
and remixes from Falty DL, Tessela and
Brackles Operating at the intersection of
tropical rhythms, road-ready Bass music and
razor-sharp electronics, this comp commendably
places the label alongside the likes of Night
Slugs or Blunted Robots. Our highlights have
to be Emvee's Grimy, siren-filled shaker
'Strength' Falty DL's inimitably swung and
exclusive 'Always' remix the lazer-etehced
Brackles Dub of Hackman's 'Always' and
Tessela's powerful shifter 'Yes You Can', but
bass fiends everywhere will surely have their
own.
