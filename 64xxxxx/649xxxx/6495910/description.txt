Ross wants Banner to revive a World War II-era military supersoldier, but tells Banner the goal of the experiment is to make human beings immune to gamma radiation. The experiment fails, transforming Banner into the Hulk (voiced by Lou Ferrigno), and injuring Betty. Whenever Banner becomes angry he transforms into the Hulk. He becomes a fugitive from the United States Army.
