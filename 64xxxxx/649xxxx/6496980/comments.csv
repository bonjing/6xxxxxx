,memyselfandi88,2011-07-09T18:02Z,"Sorry, but I don't know how to correct the error. Apparently some people have been able to download the file, as uTorrent shows that I've uploaded 3.10 GBs of files. 

I used an uploading tutorial, but I must still be doing something wrong. If anyone can recommend I good Torrent tutorial, I'd appreciate it. Thanks."
