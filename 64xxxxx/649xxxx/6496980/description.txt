This is the mp3 format audio book of Frank Herbert's God Emperor of Dune audio book. The book came with two CDs, with a total of 152 files. I kept the original bit rate of 128 kbps.

This is the good version, narrated by Simon Vance, Scott Brick, and Katherine Kellgren. It is far superior to the version narrated by Connor O'Brien.

I am uploading this torrent, because the other version that's already up has an error in the files. In that other torrent, tracks 7 and 10 are both actually track 7. Track 10 is missing from the download. 

I hope you will enjoy this audio book. The narrators really do a great job.
