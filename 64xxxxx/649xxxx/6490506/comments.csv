,eLBaRTokon,2011-06-25T02:40Z,"only thing that actually plays is the Jackass 3.5 extras , the jackass gumball the jackass 3D and the CKY extras
Thats like 2Gigs playable out of 12gig torrent
i skipped 2-3 files but nevertheless if u gonna do a collection of rare stuff ( i havent been able to find jackass 2.5 extras ANYWHERE) at least do it right.
RIP Ryan Dunn"

,IcedCoffeeMate,2011-06-27T09:20Z,"hey what the fuck! took me almost a day and a half to download the 4 CKY movies and they don't even fucking work! not to mention the fact that i went over my bandwidth limit for the month because i wanted to watch these so bad. thanks, dick! "
