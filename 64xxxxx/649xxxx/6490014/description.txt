XIII is the story of a manâ€™s quest to uncover the truth about his identity. Named for the Roman numeral tattooed on his neck, XIII is a former secret operative who cannot remember his past. Hunted by a dark anti-government organization, XIII searches for clues that will lead him to who he is, and to the secret he carries that makes him so valuableâ€”and so potentially dangerous. To gain information, the highly-trained XIII must take on missions from those he cannot trust, including the former President Sheridan, a possible traitor. Complicating matters, XIII is torn between two women: Sam, his friend and ally, and the enigmatic Jones, a Secret Service operative with whom XIII was once involved. Conspiracy, secrets and mistrust: XIIIâ€™s world is a dangerous place.
