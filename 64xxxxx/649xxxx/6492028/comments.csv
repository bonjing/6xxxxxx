,GrunnyRiku,2012-04-15T20:50Z,"For those of you who say it doesn't work, here are your solutions. If on Windows download VLC from videolan.org. If your are on Mac then you can download VLC or MPlayerX from the Mac App Store for free. MPlayerX works just about as well as VLC but has a Mac program feel to it"
