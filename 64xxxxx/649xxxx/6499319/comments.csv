,f.kruger,2011-06-28T11:54Z,thanks for the up.
,crazydementedman,2011-06-28T17:39Z,does this have the same korean subs or is it cropped or is it actually a real rip?
,sammemannen,2011-06-29T00:27Z,"Don't bother download this torrent, it's laggy as fuck!"
,crazydementedman,2011-06-29T01:46Z,What do you mean laggy?
,KhaosGT,2011-06-29T14:18Z,"Video Quality is better than the Korean Version thats out there, BUT It's very jerky.  There's a problem with the Frame rates where it is not smooth.  I believe thats what the last poster meant by ""laggy"".  I would recommend to wait for a better version of this movie.                                                                                                                                 P.S. I tried 3 different players including VLC"
,f.kruger,2011-06-29T17:29Z,V 8 A 8-9 Image quality good but frames jerk which you may find unwatchable
,fvilaca,2011-06-29T17:58Z,Very Good... Thanks for the good quality torrents as always ;)))
,Kobie714,2011-06-29T19:16Z,"Jerky and pretty much unwatchable for me, although the image quality is fairly decent, but also not perfect. Definitely not DVDRip quality. Also, it seems to be cropped, or I could be wrong and it might just be naturally skinny (720x400). Verdict: wait a bit longer."
