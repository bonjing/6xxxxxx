Title: The Open Mind
Genre: Heavy Psych Rock,Fuzzy
Country: UK

The band was formed in the mid 1960s by four musicians from Putney, South London. Initially named The Drag Set, they released a little-known single in February 1967, "Day and Night"/"Get Out of My Way".
Shortly thereafter, they changed their name to The Open Mind and in July 1969 released a self-titled LP which has since become a highly sought-after collectible. This band produced one of the finest UK psychedelic albums, which is excellent throughout and hardly contains a bad track. The music is characterised by some particularly strong psychedelic guitar work and good vocals.
It's impossible really to pull-out particular tracks as highlights - they're almost all equally good. Fortunately this album was re-released and this has made this classic piece of 60â€™s Freakbeat much more accessible to collectors of 60â€™s psychedelia.
The reissue includes their second rare 45 release, which unlike the first wasn't taken from the album and is superb. A blistering 45 with tasty psychedelic fuzz guitar work.
The band, however, is best known for its druggy August 1969 single, "Magic Potion", which did not appear on the album but included in this CD release.
