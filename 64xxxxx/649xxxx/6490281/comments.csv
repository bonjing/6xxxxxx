Google
remington steele 1982 torrent

First torrent stranded at sixty-something percent.
Second torrent completed, but it is defective and does not play.
Snoopy72 deleted both pages from here and AFAIK has done nothing to inform users about the mess, or to have the hash removed from trackers.

@vizzer: I only shout at people when I have wasted several days and more than 50GB upload.

Shit happens. A trusted skull should handle shit better."

Thanks to Agentbay for explaining what an uploader should do in the case of an upload failing.
