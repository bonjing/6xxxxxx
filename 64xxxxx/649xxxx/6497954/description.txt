Story Line


In this sly comedy, six of the world\'s worst gangsters managed to heist $2 million, but only one got away. Now after four years in the clink, five bumbling thieves from Montreal are forced to walk the famous Camino pilgrimage in Spain to prove they\'ve changed their ways and deserve their cut of the loot.
