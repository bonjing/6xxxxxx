In early 2010 versatile musician Mark Jansen
(EPICA) started a project together with
keyboardist Jack Driessen and guitarist Sander
Gommans (both ex-AFTER FOREVER) to produce some
heavy and technical death-metal combined with
Jack's trademark symphonic arrangements. After
writing some music together, Sander couldn't find
the time to go for it anymore. Mark then asked
guitarist Frank Schiphorst (SYMMETRY, MARCEL
COENEN & FRIENDS, CHRISTMAS METAL SYMPHONY), if he
was interested in filling the gap. And he was.
