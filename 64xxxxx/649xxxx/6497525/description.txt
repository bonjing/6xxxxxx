                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Homer Fiona Bruce and art expert Philip Mould investigate a supposedly lost painting
 by 19th-century American artist Winslow Homer that was found dumped near a rubbish
 tip. The piece is believed to be worth more than 150,000, but there is confusion
 as to who owns it and why it was found in such an unusual location.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
