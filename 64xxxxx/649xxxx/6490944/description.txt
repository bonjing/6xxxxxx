This is the untouched DVD-5 rip of the movie Beautiful Thing so it can either be watched on any computer or burned to a DVD for a DVD player with the highest quality possible. This is an exact rip and includes all menus and special features (but has no region code so it can be played by any DVD player). This is DVD-5 meaning it can be burned to a single-layer DVD (which is how it is originally).
