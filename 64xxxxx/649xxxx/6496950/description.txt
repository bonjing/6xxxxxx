ReleaseNotes:

The classic original Beatles studio albums have been re-mastered by a dedicated team of engineers at Abbey Road Studios in London over a four year period utilising state of the art recording technology alongside vintage studio equipment, carefully maintaining the authenticity and integrity of the original analogue recordings. The result of this painstaking process is the highest fidelity the Beatles catalogue has seen since its original release.

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
