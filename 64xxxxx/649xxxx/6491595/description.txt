Game information:

In the midst of the snowfields of Greenland lies Alpha Polaris, an
American oil research station. High above, the ion storm of the century is
gathering, bringing about a strange intermixing of reality and night
terrors. It is up to Rune Knudsen, a Norwegian biologist, to take on a
desperate struggle against fear and death, and to face the primordial force
lurking beyond the veiled sky

The heart of the game is its restrained horror setting. It allows us to
explore a wide range of human themes in a realistic way: paranoia
isolation, friendship, love and so on. To us, that is the core of a good
horror adventure
