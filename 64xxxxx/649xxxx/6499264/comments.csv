,qwertzo99,2011-06-28T15:31Z,"I think it's not good that Slobodan Milosevic died in a prison while being tried. Think about it. Proving him guilty would mean that Serbia was responsible for instigating nationalistic serbian movements in neighbouring countries and arming them, sending them army leaders (and paying them) in order to expand it's territory. This is what people of Bosnia and Croatia who have been put trough genocide, ethnic cleansing and destruction claimed all along. So his death is basically a ""saved by a bell"" for Serbia. Keep in mind that this book tries to portray Hague Tribunal as anti-Serbia yet in a suit against Serbia by Bosnia the court decided by a 7 to 6 vote that ""genocide did happen in Bosnia... but Serbia didn't have anything to do with it."" 6 of these judges protested the ruling saying that Serbia denied many document literally saying that they could ""do a national harm to Serbia"". The judges said that the court could then ask for document but review them in private but the judges didn't want it. 

So please, do not pray for the deaths of these animals but for trail that could lead to Serbia. Remember, arresting and sentencing these criminals doesn't correct the harm they did. Serbia still profits by the genocide and ethnic cleansing it CONDUCTED. Serbian lawsuit party even admitted in UK that Serbia was involved in aggression against Bosnia. "
