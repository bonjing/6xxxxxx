Hyperdesk is an exciting new product from The Skins Factory that allows you to 
transform the appearance of your regular Windows desktop, with an endless array 
of exciting new desktop themes, skins, wallpapers, widgets and other 
applications called Ã´hypersuitesÃ¶.

Using Microsoft's own skinning engine, Hyperdesk uses a Ã´nativeÃ¶ and stable way 
to theme Windows. Because the magic of Hyperdesk occurs entirely in memory, your 
system files are never touched or replaced. And just as it takes a single button 
to make the magic happen, a single click will return you to your default Windows 
desktop.

have been painstakingly, hand-crafted by the world's most talented commercial 
interface artists at The Skins Factory, with the same attention to detail &
