,Scriptr93,2011-06-24T17:04Z,"Have you realised the two mistakes you made?
No virus I personally run it with Avira(My Linux Lap).

1) Linux does not get viruses.
2) Linux cannot have Windows signed drivers.
3) Linux can't have Windows Applications unless emulated with Wine or PlayOnLinux, even then, look at No. 1, you waste your memory.
Well, that failed..."
[T],faren73,2011-06-24T18:41Z,"@scriptr93, First shut the hell up. Second he stated that he ""scanned"" the upload with the systems, not that he ran or used the drivers on Linux, you idiot. Of course you can scan with avira on linux, people do have antivirus on their linux systems so that they don't spread a virus to a windows system. Clearly this upload is for people running Windows Vista on an Acer Aspire Desktop M1610, specifically. You are the one who made the mistake! You shouldn't make comments that make you look like a complete fool"
