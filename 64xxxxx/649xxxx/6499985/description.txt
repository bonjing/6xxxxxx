Endless Desperation Prod. presents the new Kairi's album
"My Light, My Flesh". In search of their own unique style
the band releaased three demos. Kairi's music is the
superposition of deep Ambient sounds, heavy enveloping
riffs and despair of Funeral Doom metal. The bloom of
melancholic symphony, clear vocals weaving with powerful
growls and dark album's atmosphere reflect the soul's
journey in the labyrinths of mind. It's the way which
starts now.
