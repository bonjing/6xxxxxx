Â· One-click form filling! Sticky Password fills in tedious online forms quickly and accurately.

Protect yourself against identity theft and online threats:

Â· The database is encrypted with the strongest encryption algorithms available in the industry, including the military-grade AES algorithm.
Â· Youâ€™ll be protected from phishing scams, because Sticky Password wonâ€™t send your login and password to fake websites!
Â· Multiple levels of protection against key-loggers. Sticky Passwordâ€™s automatic login and form filling ensure that there is nothing for key loggers to record. And the Virtual Keyboard also ensures that not even someone peaking over your shoulder will know what youâ€™re typing.
