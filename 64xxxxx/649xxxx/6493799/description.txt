Storyline:


In his feature film debut, Larry The Cable Guy brings a truckload of one-liners to his role as big-city health inspector, happily going from greasy spoon diners to low-rent ethnic restaurants. But his easy-going life gets turned upside-down when he's teamed with a stiff, straight-laced rookie partner (Iris Bahr) and assigned the biggest case of his career: investigating food poisoning at the city's swankiest restaurants. While running up against a hardnosed boss (Tom Wilson) and the shady Mayor (Joe Pantoliano) and an unscrupulous restaurant owner (Joanna Cassidy), his bad manners and unorthodox methods cost him his job. Larry is forced to go undercover to bring the conspirators to justice and "Git-R-Done!"
