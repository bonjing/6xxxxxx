The quality of the videos are low because I ripped from a live stream channel. So don't start complaining you've been warned. Plus I don't live in the USA and don't have access to Nick's full length episodes.I can't even download it from Amazon. DAMN RESTRICTIONS! 


Slowly, but surely I'll be adding more episodes!


So always check back!


Enjoy with your kids .....or not! XD!

:D!
