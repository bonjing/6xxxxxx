[V],gansuk,2011-06-26T10:48Z,"@GlenUrbs26 download the ogg codec from codec central the old release works fine then.
and theres no multiplayer addon coz no multiplayer was removed.

@royhere yeah its fine this time round"
,Cyrez60659,2011-06-26T13:42Z,Lol KaOs is so full of fail. Why didn't you tell us that all we had to do was download the .ogg codec to make the old version work u fucking retards. This means I've deleted the old (seemingly broken) version for no fucking reason and now have to download the whole fucking thing again. You guys seriously suck. This whole thing could've been avoided.
,GlenUrbs26,2011-06-26T14:15Z,I already downloaded the ogg codec from codec central... but it doesn't fix the audio problem... Do I still need to do something to fix the problem ??

[V],gansuk,2011-06-26T20:18Z,like the simple instructions you added to it aswell.
,Farnum,2011-06-26T23:15Z,".ogg codec ""solution"" didn't work for me.
Hell, I may have to actually start buying games because the competent scene people are moving on and 10 yr old kids are trying on daddys big shoes which dont fit."
,DangerDan43257,2011-06-27T00:30Z,"maybe your antivirus is deleteing files it shouldnt be, most cracks/patches/tools get deleted by mistake as false possitives, only there first relese needs the fix anyway this one is fine. "

,seeloa81,2011-07-07T04:51Z,fuckinggggggg fake fake fake fake bc u wasted my time again
,DangerDan43257,2011-07-07T14:47Z,"fake? are you commenting on the right torrent? lol.
just because kaos defeats most of the competition on presentation & filesize (not so much speed lol) theres no reason to be jeleous and post negative comments to put off downloaders. gansuk is a trusted user and everybody knows they dont upload fakes. the comments were funny for awile now they just boring."
,aneeshlatheef,2011-07-12T06:57Z,"hey man i salute u you r the best ripper i have ever seen

i have a suggestion that plz upload the games a little earlier"
,SgameB,2011-07-12T09:19Z,"KaOs i am a fan of your torrents 
It would be very nice of you if you rip Shaun white skateboarding(only HD skateboarding game for pc)
Please reply if you are willing to do this"
,killahmonkey,2011-07-12T12:16Z,Does this have multiplayer and co-op?
,pradystar7,2011-07-12T12:20Z,"Gansuk please help me i had installed and finished the game ,i just reinstalled my windows now when i was installing fear 3 again during unpack i got some wierd error saying ""application failed to install"" at the time of .ogg to .wav conversion"
,McDowelstick,2011-07-15T11:55Z,"Anyone getting a weird crash (upon death) when playing this? Whenever my character gets killed, the entire screen becomes gory with blood and the game hangs instantly. This is happening to me in the Slums area of the game.

Apart from this bug, the game plays fine for me. As long as I don't die, that is.


"
,rodrot,2011-07-15T21:39Z,Works perfectly. Kaos crew kicks ass!
,foxwilliam3,2011-07-16T06:05Z,"WTF! I waited for the download, waited for the install. And nothing but junk! Why dosn't Pirate Bay weed out junk uploads?! It's bad enough ya have to sort through multiple copies of the same game to find one that works but to find out that it was a waste of time, not because the file is currupt, but because the file is nothing. Thanks KaOaSS!"
,jh-76,2011-07-19T16:48Z,works fine!no problem at all!thanks!!
,DangerDan43257,2011-07-19T17:20Z,yeah worked fine for me aswell @foxwilliam3 if you read the comments it works fine for almost everybody. i think it would be better if the Pirate Bay would weed out all the users who dont have a clue what there doing lol
,BrooklynBrawler,2011-08-09T22:59Z,"Works perfectly,Thank you!!"
