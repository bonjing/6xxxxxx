Here is a unique picture of European mineral exploration in Africa and the larger than life character William Chads. He followed his father into the army, served with distinction in the First World War, was wounded and awarded the Military Cross. After war service, Chads began exploring for gold in South America and continued with further adventures in Africa. This story provides a window into an interesting facet of European economic imperialism.
Diane Chads is author of William's Adventures in Africa .
