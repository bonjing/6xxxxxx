,ssiriuss,2011-07-15T00:57Z,"How could i get ride of those drivers ?
I donât need them at all, after i installed Windows, i have about 11 GB only on C / Windows / System 32 / DriverStore / FileRepository / In total it's about 17 GB.
Please, someone help me.
I tried with Win Integrator and RT 7 Lite, but i donât know how to proceed.
Thank you."
,FAKMAN,2011-07-15T21:49Z,thanks!!!!
,gizmodo666,2011-07-17T00:34Z,"Ok so i'll just answer myself as well as a lot of queries here. Yes, this does come preinstalled with IE9. Just installed it on three PCs from USB stick. Works like a charm. No need for key. Its preactivated with DAZ so once you run a complete virus scan after install, it'll identify C:/Windows/KMS.exe as trojan but dont worry cuz its a false positive. Just go ahead and remove it. Also detects your OEM and installs drivers accordingly, plus some bloatware which i had to remove manually. Themes too can just be deleted from C:\Windows\Resources\Themes. Updates fine with Windows Update. Also once changes are made to the boot image cannot be reverted so u cant remove the unnecessary drivers using RT7 Lite etc. You just have to live with that so make sure u have atleast 40gb free space in the partition where you want to install this. All in all, a good upload. Definitely worth the download."
,Ouzotime,2011-07-18T21:40Z,nice up m8 sounds like a good copy i will give a try liluser however your comment (in fact Kaspersky is one of the worst to use.)please dont say that you sound smarter then that i know eset is 1 of the top but Kaspersky is as good if not better as for Hedis62 posting the serial here is a good way to get it blacklisted...

But this will not install the update SP1 RC2 KB976932 and can not download manually from MS because it wants to verify genuine with GenuineCheck.exe.Any solution?"
