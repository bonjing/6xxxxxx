Also note that this rip has not been recoded, so it's the same quality as is available at www.nrk.no.

The sound quality is very good, but the video quality is sometimes a little bit pixelated when many things happens at once.
A: 8/10
V: 7/10

A proper release of the full concert will probably be released commercially by nrk. This video is only one hour long, including background material.

Hope you enjoy it. I think the production is fantastic. Certainly the best live metal recording I have heard .The choir even sounds better than on the records."
