The Shadows of the Damned release date is on June 21, 2011 and those who pre-order the game from select retailers will get a special soundtrack bonus!

If you already pre-ordered the game you will have the soundtrack goodie applied to your order, but you must have pre-ordered the game from the EA Store, Amazon or GameStop.

You wonâ€™t actually get a physical CD though, instead you will get a free download for the 12-track Shadows of the Damned soundtrack from Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill) and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn.

Shadows of the Damned is the interesting upcoming Action Adventure horror game from Suda 51 and Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami which features some of the outrageousness of No More Heroes 2 with a light and shadows-based gameplay shooting mechanic.
