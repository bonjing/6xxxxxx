,jrallah,2011-07-01T20:20Z,"@etlover- Thanks for the rip.  Audio and Visual are great.  

@ everyone else- This film is absolutely dog shit.

Terrible acting.  Terrible plot.  Truly disappointing unless it's your kinda thing.  If you're a lover of intelligent horror......look elsewhere."
,Decker74,2011-07-08T02:06Z,"Whatever jrallah. This was a good movie.
The use of visuals and camera tricks was amazing. It had some truly scary moments.  "
,drunkjoker333,2011-07-10T03:31Z,"idk the quality of this one, but it is a good movie, watched it awhile back, just hoping for a better copy, but those who think it's a stupid movie go watch barney or something and suck your thumb"
,ReapersD00M,2011-07-17T17:28Z,"Realy is a great movie, you cant judge a movie without looking at its genera, Evil Dead, army of darkness, drag me to hell, truly takes a cake among its peers.. not the cake though."

,phantomflock,2011-09-21T17:21Z,"@etlover

Hello. Is this the uncut version? I had a friend said they watched a different one, somewhat like a theater version... the scariest events in Insidious were removed, very shitty if you ask me."

,balrog814,2012-03-10T11:31Z,"This is the best horror ever. It goes to distance, no other horror ever went. After 1 month, I still think about it. Very scary, no gore. Whoever disses this, is stupid. Watched it twice, and everything is soo well thought out. I highly recommend. No long, boring introductory, cuts right to the chase. Spooky:))"
