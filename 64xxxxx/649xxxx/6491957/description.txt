There is no IMDb entry for this new, and mighty long at 2 hours 36 minutes, documentary.  Not even a director is listed.  The executive producer is Rob Johnstone. There is quite a bit of minutiae, and very little in the way of appearances by the man with the very long name that ends up being just three letters.

There are a bunch of snippets of what look like music videos I've never seen or heard anything about.  They look quite interesting. If anybody has access to them, do post them (and let me know!). The picture above is from "The Seven Deadly Finns".

Not an exhausting list, but what is covered, mainly, is:

Obscure records
801
Roxy Music (and why the two Bs had to split up)
Cluster (and Harmonia)
Bowie
The Winkies
John Cage

and the very beginnings of his production activities (with the Talking Heads and Devo)

Lots of talking heads. A well balanced look at his early, and for many, his most interesting, years. Still, another one of those Rock Docs with a disclaimer:

The film is not authorized or sanctioned by Brian Eno, or by any party representing him.
