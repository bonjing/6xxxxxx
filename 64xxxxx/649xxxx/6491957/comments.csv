Thanks a lot for the upload. The ""music videos"" seem to be made for the documentary as the video tracks mainly stem from films made after mid-70's. Most are from Koyasnisquatsi, others i've recognized are Tarkovsky's Zerkalo and Laughton's Night of the Hunter. They fit the music perfectly though, and the music itself, unlike most out there, is very suited for playback with a visual background.

Looking forward to finding more Eno and Eno-related stuff.

There was a fantastik BBC2 Arena doc on Eno last year, very highly recommended, called ""Another Green World"". It's here on TPB together with another good BBC doc.

I'm rather fond of the interview with Paul Morley called ""The Thing is..."" where he ends up setting up the parameters for the interview, a bit like a self inflicted ""Five Obstructions"". Just noticed a more recent print interview with Morley from the Guardian.  About to put on my thinking cap..."
