Roy and Karyn Beatty thought they had it made until Karyn suffered a brutal sexual assault she would never forget. In an effort to save their marriage and their sanity they moved to the rural California town of Drago. Like all small towns, Drago was quiet. Sometimes too quiet. The people were strange and at night .... the wolves howled.
     With a history of unexplained deaths and disappearances the seemingly safe town of Drago harboured an age old secret. And it was in their new home that Roy and Karyn would be forced to confront a horror that defied belief.
