PINK FLOYD THE FINAL CUT 

The Final Cut is the twelfth studio album by English progressive rock group Pink Floyd. It was released in March 1983 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom, and several weeks later by Columbia Records in the United States. A concept album, The Final Cut is the last of the band\'s releases to include founding member and longtime lyricist Roger Waters. It is the only Pink Floyd album on which Waters is credited for the writing and composition of every song. Most of the lyrics are sung by Waters; lead guitarist David Gilmour provides vocals on only one of the album\'s tracks.
