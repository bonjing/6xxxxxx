[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-25T10:51Z,"Well that's a good question bro !
video lan suggest to all users who still have bug
with catalyst 11.5 and 11.6 on vlc 1.1.10 final to 
up and switch to this new version.
However vlc 1.2.0 has been started since many months now.
I don't have myself any problem with vlc 1.2.0
on catalyst 11.6 as well as on latest nvidia 275.33 WHQL
Anyway vlc 1.1.11 has a bug fix to this topic
if you have too much problems with vlc 1.2.0,so yeah,feel free to test this new version
sorry i cannot tell you more about...
