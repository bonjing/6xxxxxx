Cell started in 2006 as a challenge to recreate and understand Industrial music. Along the way vocals were written, followed by instrumentals and eventually entire songs. In mid 2009 we were contacted by Matt Russel of Gain Structure studios and produced our first EP "Stop This" which is available on iamcell.com through various online sources. "Evolve" is EP 1 of 3 to be released in 2011. We are currently in the studio mixing EP 2 and 3.
