                         X-MEN PC SETUP
                         ==============  
Based on the Marvel comic book series, X-Men pits everyone's favorite team of superheroic mutants against the villainy of Magneto. From his base on Asteroid M, Magneto has developed a computer virus for use in infecting the X-Men's training facility, the Danger Room. This cleverly designed virus has turned the once holographic perils of the Danger Room into reality. Once again, the X-Men are called upon to save the day.

Wolverine, Cyclops, Gambit and Nightcrawler (with a little help from Rogue, Archangel, Iceman, Storm and Jean Grey) must fight through six levels and stop Magneto, who has enlisted help from such X-Men foes as Juggernaut, Sabretooth, Mojo, Deathbird, Apocolypse and Ahab.

Once in action, each X-Man has his own methods of getting the job done. Wolverine slices through anything and everything with his razor-sharp adamantium claws, Cyclops uses his powerful optic blasts, Gambit throws energy-charged cards and Nightcrawler teleports through walls (taking out enemies in the process). When needed, other X-Men are on call to lend a hand, each with special powers of his or her own.

Collectively, the six levels of play are called Combat Zones. Individually, they are: the Savage Land, the Shi'ar Empire, Excalibur's Lighthouse, Ahab's Future World, Mojo's Crunch and Asteroid M. Missions within these levels include a battle with a tribe of leopardmen while escaping giant bees, the hijacking of a space shuttle, escaping from a house of horrors and much more. Obstacles (such as flames and toxic ooze), puzzles (such as using keys to turn off devices) and enemies abound.
