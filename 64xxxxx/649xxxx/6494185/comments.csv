,uggenabben,2011-07-06T19:46Z,If you want to reduce the size you can change .ipa to .zip an remove the maps you do not need and change it back again. But I guess this is old news...
,thedesmodus,2011-07-29T18:22Z,On my jailbroken iPad 4.3.2 I am getting an unknown error(0xE8008001). I managed to get the .ipa from the .rar files and dragged it into iTunes. Then I try to sync and it fails. I remember that I used to have to install a Cydia app first to run jailbroken apps... Do I still have to do that?
,thedesmodus,2011-07-29T18:50Z,After a tiny bit of googling I found the answer to my own question: http://jaxov.com/2011/07/download-appsync-for-ios-4-0-plus-to-install-cracked-iphone-apps-on-ios-4-3-4/
,Scorpio70,2011-12-29T10:36Z,"Just select all the .zips and extract (WinRAR can do that). You'll get a bunch of files, which you extract with WinRAR simply by double-clicking the .r00 -file."
,Scorpio70,2011-12-29T10:38Z,"Correcting myself, you start with the .rar -file, not .r00"
