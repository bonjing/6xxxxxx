,artinusa,2011-08-21T02:18Z,why do people knowingly post these program..waste of time and bandwidth
,PietroPed,2011-08-23T21:50Z,thumbs down
,dredre27,2011-12-25T22:43Z,"Read me file says: ""Program alredy (sic) registered
Just install and use"". 

For me no watermarks. 

However the resulting flash refuses to load in firefox. But it loads fine in Internet Explorer.

Also, the app crashes after converting PDF to flash then clicking the 'View It' button. 

But manually opening the folder and then loading the flash with my browser is fine in IE but not ff. No watermark though. No clue why others see watermarks. Mine doesn't.

Oh. Am running this in win xp-32 bit inside of vmware client, inside of win7 64bit host.

Your milage may vary"
,goldstar32,2012-01-07T18:45Z,"Works for me, no watermark and works in all browsers."
,ZeroCoool,2012-01-16T15:50Z,"it does work for 1 time only when you do the setup and it runs automatically.

for each time you will have to uninstall then re-install or else you will get the bookmarks on the final publication :("
,gkg4,2012-04-07T07:39Z,"Its working fine.

All you need is to run the application with the Administrator Rights."
