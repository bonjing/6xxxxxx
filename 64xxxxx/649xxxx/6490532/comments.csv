,gredelina,2011-06-24T13:12Z,"I hate these x264 torrents, they dont work for me.. could someone upload a regular one?"
,marty2004,2011-06-24T14:30Z,"can confirm this is the real deal, thought this was a cinema only release in the usa, this is dvd quailty release, so happy i've got it on the day of release. 
To gredelina download a codec pack called k lite and t will play on wndows media player, not sure why but the sound is low on mkv, plays fine and at the right volume level on the samsung, so must be a setting in the codec somewhere, any way real file and it took about an hour to download."
,Intrawi,2011-06-24T18:12Z,sceneline releases always trusted
,coco1963,2011-06-24T22:20Z,Someone please convert this and upload as a 700MB AVI file. 3GB is way too large to download for slow connections! Thank you!
,samandmeow,2011-06-25T09:56Z,It's really big and really slow. Couldn't someone do what the poster above said?
,kaoslulu,2011-06-26T06:40Z,i would love this in SD if possible ..thanks in advance :)
,jjf3,2011-06-26T19:20Z,"This is the real deal it is in HD Quality so 10++++ for Audio and video. As for the documentary it's an amazing look at Conan's life on the road during his tour. This is a true documentary, and will show a deeper side of Coco. "
,BetterThanLife,2011-06-28T00:49Z,Watching Conan in 700MB quality compared to this? That is a sin. 
,flipperspit,2011-10-12T20:30Z,Great 720p torrent! Tastes good and good for ya too!
