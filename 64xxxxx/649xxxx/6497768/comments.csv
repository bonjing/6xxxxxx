I'll tell others to come to page 18 here, as this is where it's at.
Some other fool has did a 6.8 gig torrent of EVERY Dylan song, but that knocks out all of us little downloaders on dinky 2004 Dell PCs, lol.

BTW, 90% of Dylan's stuff is pure crap, so it stands to reason that there's probably 7 stinkers in this Top 70. I'll be back to say which ones smell like shit."
