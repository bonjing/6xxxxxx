Release Notes:
 
http://www.stringmetal.com/judgementday/

It is almost impossible to talk about stringed instruments in heavy music
without mentioning Apocalyptica. While the Finns may have pioneered cello metal,
their clumsy crossover attempts by way of including popular vocalists make one
yearn for ars gratia artis. Judgement Day is that art, even if they donâ€™t spell
their name the way James Cameron, Christian theologists, or the WWE would.

According to the extensive liner notes, there were initial conflicting visions
in every aspect of the album, from the songwriting to the cover painting. In
both cases, three minds were at work, collaborating as a trio for the first
time. Musically, it blossomed from an in-studio mixture of improvisations,
amidst compositions loosely hammered out in their practice space. As time
progressed, they relied more on â€œspontaneous inspirationâ€ and â€œabandoned
traditional song structures and rulesâ€. The three painters were charged by the
band to â€œcreate a piece of art with no predetermined visionâ€, and were
encouraged to continuously layer each otherâ€™s workâ€”to not perseverate over any
particular area.

The end result in both cases is beautiful, terrifying, humorous, and above all
else, balanced. Siblings Anton and Lewis Patzner got their start on the streets
of Berkeley, California some eight years ago, and wrote much of the music for
their first release, Dark Opus, to be played as such. Now with metal drummer Jon
Bush in the mix, they add a deeper metallic layer to Lewisâ€™ conservatory-trained
cello and Antonâ€™s Bright Eyes-tempered violin. The music they craft is bold as
it is delicate, demonstrating true innovation with genuine promise for the
future.

Different folks will have their own song preferences, but the album is strong. I
only suggest avoiding â€œImprovisationâ€ because, although the end product of their
work is excellent, listening to the process felt a bit less compelling. Be sure
to check out the hilarious video for â€œCobra Strikeâ€ to see how the world might
look if video game â€˜heroesâ€™ played violins instead of guitars. And according to
the date on the pseudo-authentic home video in the opening scene, itâ€™s from the
future. Now thatâ€™s progressive.
