,Cust0dian,2011-06-27T14:16Z,"To change your name: 
1. Go to the CSS folder, find ""rev.ini"" file
2. Open it with text editor and find string that contains following:

  PlayerName=

3. Replace whatever comes after ""="" (which will probably be ""unnamed"") with desired nickname.
4. Save the file and check out the game. "
