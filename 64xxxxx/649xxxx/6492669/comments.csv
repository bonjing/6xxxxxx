,Cerebral222,2011-06-25T10:27Z,"Didn't work for me, all I got was an error report: http://bayimg.com/DaIMDaADM  I'm using windows 7 32bit, core 2 Duo 2.66 , 4 gig of ram, Asus motherboard with 1333 bus speed, GeForce 210 Graphics card (1gig mem), I can't see a reason for this to fail twice other than faulty/currupt files due to over compression as it ends up about 2.5 gig unpacked, considering the file size, it was worth rolling the dice, oh well."

                   #2 : Have been ripped : Movies, Music and part of speech
                        (subtitles available).
                        About the speeches : we decided to include part of the
                        speech as it's strictly impossible to make a speech
                        addon. Our first trial was 39x5 mb, so we filled with
                        maximum of speech (till 55x5mb) for your pleasure.
                        Music addon planned.
                   #4 : Note to Alias : nothing downsampled sweety :

,vishu_ka,2011-06-25T13:43Z,"@xplor3r i know it popped up during uncompression but as i played the game there were all music and speech present!! i guess some worthless movies hv been removed which wont affect the story of game!! for people having high bandwidth they should go for 2gb torrent,,, this one is for low bndwdth's one!! also i already stated uncompressed size is 1.78 gb!!"
,xplor3r,2011-06-25T18:21Z,"@ vishu_ka

what' sthe point of playing the game without seeing all the movies ... and it has a lot of them  ... without them you won't get much of the story ..."
,vishu_ka,2011-06-26T07:38Z,"@xplor3r why dont u ask same question to ripper of this game.... bro this torrent is not for u, u should go for 2-3 gb one!! let people with small bandwidth dl it!! cheers!!"
,motley666,2011-06-26T14:32Z,Without movies this game don't show all potential.
