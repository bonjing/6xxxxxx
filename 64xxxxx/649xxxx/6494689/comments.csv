I remember him being called a naturalist years ago, which was a euphemism for a scientific lightweight if even that.  Let's be honest and call Darwin what he is, an over-hyped bird-watcher.  Whether the droves of evolutionists acknowledge it or not, observation alone does not equate with experimentation+observation+prediction, but little things like that don't matter to them so it's ok, as long as he's instrumental to them in pretending to lift their guilt of sin and future judgment from rejecting Christ, forgiveness, and immortality."
