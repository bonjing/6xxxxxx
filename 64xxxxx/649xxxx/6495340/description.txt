Ben Hur was made back when going to an epic movie was an international event. Great spectaculars were made with real people, mind-boggling sets and casts of thousands -- long before digital special effects made them all obsolete.

Epics were shown on gigantic screens in palatial movie houses, often with overtures and intermissions, and a really big movie was a cultural experience that everybody knew about. Thereâ€™s no better example of those bygone days than 1959â€™s Ben Hur, a biblical sword-and-sandal epic that has it all â€“ including a breathtaking, absolutely real chariot race.
The Plot
After a prologue of the birth of Christ, the movie begins in Judea, where we meet the handsome Roman Messala, a childhood friend of Judah Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) who is now determined to rule the conquered land of Judea with an iron hand. Ben Hur, a Jewish prince, is wealthy and influential, and Messala asks his help in persuading the locals against rebellion â€“ but he resists.

As the new Roman governor arrives to take power, Ben Hur and his sister are watching from their rooftop and accidently dislodge a tile. The governorâ€™s horse starts, he falls and is gravely injured. Ben Hur, his mother and sister are arrested and unjustly condemned, and Ben Hur swears vengeance against Messala.

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.


RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe That The Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed..

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...

May Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed Long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.

Ephesians 5:11
