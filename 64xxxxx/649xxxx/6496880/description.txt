Customer Review

"I received the book as a gift and was surprised at the amount of information in this book. As a die hard Buffy fan I thought I knew all the ins and outs of the show. BUT this book pointed out so many things I missed it made me feel like a new viewer, not someone who has seen each episode at least 10 times. I also liked the time line from the first slayer to today. It fills in alot of blanks for the Buffy fan. Awesome book, highly recommended." - DharmaQueen
