fapomatic/show/5330016
fapomatic/show/5330017

Just remember these don't mean much. You have to see it in motion."
,Pokler,2011-06-24T15:28Z,"If you have any of these videos already, please throw them in your download dir to help seed~

At the rate I am going with my ~170kb/s upload speed it will take about two weeks and that -may- involve having to break off seeding in about a week to continue at a later date due to a housing change.

I would rather have the whole thing finished before stopping with seeding."

,Scribble-Scrabble,2011-07-05T14:36Z,Please keep seeding. It's going very slow at the moment.
,Scribble-Scrabble,2011-07-11T21:57Z,No more seeders? I only need like 8% or so. Please someone seed!
,poolsert,2011-07-18T21:57Z,"The amount of seeders listed by TBP is deceptive, because it only takes into account the amount on THEIR tracker and that one is half dead most of the time.

There are currently 40+ seeders on this torrent and this amount will most likely be stable."

I wish there were something similar for Triangle Films.

Thank you Pokler !"
