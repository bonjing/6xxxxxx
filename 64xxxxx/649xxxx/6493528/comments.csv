Would you, by any chance, be able to tell us when the Release-Lounge H264 releases for Insidious, Rango and Rio will be uploaded?

Many thanks and keep up the great work!"

Please, please go back to mp4, you where the best before you changed to MKV/dxva, now sadly your torrents are not that great anymore, but thanx anyways ofc."
