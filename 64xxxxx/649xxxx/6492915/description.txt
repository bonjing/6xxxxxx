For generations, intelligent investors have built wealth by applying Benjamin Grahamâ€™s classic value investing principles. The approach is as powerful as ever, but the arrival of a new global investment terrainâ€“with its differing politico-economic systems, rising markets, and increasing collisionsâ€“is creating both historic challenges and opportunities for value investors. Now, Jeffrey Towson shows how to uncover unprecedented value opportunities in todayâ€™s colliding, chaotic, and wildly mispriced new global marketplace.
Drawing on extensive experience investing and deal-making on the ground around the world, Towson introduces a new value playbook for global investing. He shows how value investors, private equity firms, family offices, institutional investors, and others can use a value-added approach to confidently and comfortably extend their current investment strategies to global opportunities. The result is a practical investment playbook for a global age, identifying todayâ€™s best opportunities, and preparing you for massive market shifts that are just beginning to emerge.
