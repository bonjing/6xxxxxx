This is a pretty pissed off sludge band from the UK that
lies somewhere inbetween Grief, Iron Monkey and Negative
Reaction. You can expect pretty heavy 'scream the lungs
out' sludge throughout most of the music that is straight
up hateful, sludgy doom, and is a highly recommended
listening if you're a fan of this style.

Support the artists! Support the underground! \m/
