thank you very much for this amazing torrent :)

now just so you are aware of it (and i find it really quite unexpectedly funny!) the track ""Isla Grant - Mother (2001)\10-15 - Dark Deep Rolling Water.mp3"" sounds as if the chipmunks are singing it!
the music starts off ok-ish but then that really high & fast 'chipmunk singing' style begins...
the track shows 1:44 in length, 44 kHz, 192 kbps, 2.39 MB in size.
i have tried different media players and i even wrote a standard *proper* Audio CD (typically 80 minutes worth of audio) that's playable in any standalone CD player: same 'chipmunk singing' result LOL
the other 14 tracks in the ""Isla Grant - Mother (2001)"" folder all sound perfect so great job bonnie335 :)
i will definately get the remaining Isla Grant albums from your awesome torrent (and listen ti them) when bandwidth & time allows!

Ã¾akka Ã¾Ã©r :)"
