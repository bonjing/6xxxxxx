,CyberMouse_2011,2011-06-27T12:38Z,any confirmation this legit? the last one i did was a virus .exe files by itself are way too suspicous...
,IndigoAK,2011-06-29T23:31Z,"I scanned the installed folder with MSE and nothing came up.  It also didn't detect anything during the installation.

Game itself works."
,Apollokun,2011-07-07T08:11Z,"As soon as I hit .exe, Norton deleted it and categorized it as a Medium Threat Virus. Dunno what the hell it is, but doesn't seem legit to me."
,Spinfx,2011-11-12T17:36Z,"Fuck Norton, change your A/V unless you enjoy having it nuke random files for ""being suspicious"". You could exercise a little intelligence and check out the uploader's other torrents. Even if the guy only had this one single upload (which isn't the case here), run the file against a couple of other A/Vs which aren't retarded.

We're sick of morons repeating the same old tired ""omfg virus!!11"" bullshit everywhere. If basic computing is beyond you then stick to getting your software from Walmart."

Anyways, some people may get some OpenAL.dll error. To fix this:

Go to C:Program Files(x86)

Scroll down to Jamestown, click on the folder Redist.

Within the folder is a program called Oalinst. Click this, it is the OpenAL fixer. Bam! Play Jamestown and have fun."

Works just fine!"
