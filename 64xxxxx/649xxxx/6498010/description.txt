"She's Not There"

Sookie journeys away from Bon Temps; Eric 
and Bill try to win back the human public; 
Jason learns that no good deed goes 
unpunished; Tara find refuge in close 
quarters; Sam bonds with his own; Hoyt and 
Jessica debate the dinner menu; Jesus 
urges Lafayette to join a coven; Terry 
tries to alleviate Arlene's fears about 
the baby. 

18/Slower
Evolve... or die.

Enjoy :)
