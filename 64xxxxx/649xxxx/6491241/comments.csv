One question though, aren't there anymore 350MB versions, since 1.15gb is really too big for me.

Either way thanks for the up :)"
,Vvornth,2011-06-24T12:59Z,Thanks!
,kght22,2011-06-25T00:26Z,"the 350 is more popular currently so you should be able to see it lemon, this is for people who want a decent 720p copy of the show. much respect to those who make these available."
,ManLemon,2011-06-25T09:47Z,"@kght22: yeah, I noticed this was the 720 version but it seems the smaller one isn't on piratebay nor the eztv website, that's why I was asking here... "
