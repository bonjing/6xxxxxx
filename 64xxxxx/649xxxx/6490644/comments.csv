many in the Laodicean era (Rev 3.14-22) don't understand how that discipleship under the Lord is far more than the basics and assurance of salvation.  it is based on a total worldview that encompasses all spheres of thought and endeavor (Rom 12.1-2; 2 Cor 10.3-6; Matt 28.19-20), and rightly so because it is founded upon truth itself, literally personified by Jesus Christ (John 14.6; Prov 8).

we should also remember the importance of any issue can be recognized by how much resistance the servants of darkness and those who are captive marshall against it.  if one isn't experiencing antagonism to their Christian beliefs, it is because they're having little or no impact in the spiritual warfare that rages on.

thanks for sharing, blessings"
