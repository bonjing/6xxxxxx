,coco1963,2011-06-25T23:12Z,"You are awesome Marty! All your work is much appreciated! Especially for those of us living abroad that can't get it on tv or the website.

I have a question. I see you downloaded the Conan Can't Stop documentary. Would it be possible for you to convert it to the usual +/- 700Mb AVI type file like most dvd releases come in? I'm sure it would be greatly appreciated by many others with slow connections if you could upload this, as 3GB is way too large and we don't all need it in 720p HD.

Many thanks for all your hard work!"
