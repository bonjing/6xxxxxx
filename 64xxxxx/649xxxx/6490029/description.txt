|   Despite all the efforts of British duo Garry Cobain and Brian Dougans      |
|   (read: no less than thirty albums under twenty-five different aliases),    |
|   the electronica they envisioned as London's future sound over the past     |
|   twenty-one years never exactly transitioned into the city's present        |
|   sound. But it's been a fantastic run all the same, even if the duo has     |
|   been focusing more on their psychedelic, progressive material as of        |
|   late. With that said, the most impressive works in The Future Sound of     |
|   London's back catalogue are some of the duo's earliest studio albums.      |
|   The production of Lifeforms was well underway as Cobain and Dougans        |
|   released Tales of Ephindrina under the Amorphous Androgynous banner in     |
|   1993. Accordingly, whereas Tales of Ephindrina did a great job in          |
|   combining the techno of the duo's earliest writings and the ambience of    |
|   their later works, Lifeforms takes on a more complex, experimental         |
|   structure. In doing this, The Future Sound of London not only cemented     |
|   their status as one of the scene's top acts, but also crafted one of the   |
|   genre's top records.                                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   If Lifeforms was held back by anything at all, it would certainly be its   |
|   large volume of tracks. There are longer electronic albums from that       |
|   era, of course; case in point, The Orb's Adventures Beyond the             |
|   Ultraworld exceeds it by nearly twenty minutes. But with ninety-two        |
|   minutes of material spread over nineteen songs on two discs, Lifeforms     |
|   can make for quite the daunting listen nevertheless. That isn't to say     |
|   that it's tedious, just a bit dense on the first few listens.              |
|   Contributing to the album's arguably inaccessible aura is the              |
|   experimental direction taken by Cobain and Dougans. Album opener           |
|   "Cascade", for example, opens with a minute and a half of alien sounding   |
|   overtures and spacey samples, before transitioning into a melting pot of   |
|   said samples, a subtle, synthesized ambience, and light beats. And         |
|   though much of the double album is spent experimenting with a delicate     |
|   sound built on sweeping samples and shrouds of electric noise, it would    |
|   be a mistake to pigeonhole Lifeforms into having nineteen different        |
|   versions of "Cascade". One of the album's most impeccable aspects is its   |
|   subtle format; there's just so much going on in nearly every song that     |
|   you'll hear something new on each listen.                                  |
|                                                                              |
|   The album's antithesis, then, is its title track. A hit single in the      |
|   UK, "Lifeforms" abandons the soft, discreet textures so predominately      |
|   featured throughout the double album in favour of heavier ambient house    |
|   influences. The song is owns one of Lifeforms' heaviest rhythm sections,   |
|   making it one of the record's more in-your-face-type tracks, and           |
|   certainly the catchiest. Parts of "Among Myselves" also echo the title     |
|   track's dancier moments, but not without applying the oddities heard in    |
|   virtually every other track. And despite standing out as two of the few    |
|   truly danceable tracks on a primarily ambient album, both "Lifeforms"      |
|   and "Among Myselves" hardly sound out of place.                            |
|                                                                              |
|   But as notable as the likes of "Lifeforms", the driving "Flak" (which      |
|   incidentally features guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson fame), and    |
|   the almost frightening "Spineless Jelly" may be, the sheer scope of        |
|   Lifeforms prevents it from being anything other than brilliant. Falling    |
|   victim to the old quality vs. quantity debate, double albums tend to       |
|   taper off the longer they go on. With Lifeforms, however, The Future       |
|   Sound of London build off and improve on each subsequent track;            |
|   consequently, to pinpoint a highlight is virtually impossible as nearly    |
|   every song could make a case for such an honour. But such talk is moot     |
|   in the end as Lifeforms is just such a rewarding record to listen to.      |
|   It's dense. It's expansive. It's relaxing, engaging, intimate, strange,    |
|   perhaps pretentious at times, and an assortment of other positive          |
|   adjectives. But above all else, Lifeforms is a blast to listen to and      |
|   ranks up with the Boards of Canadas, the Shpongles, The Orbs as for as     |
|   90s electronic music is concerned. [Mike Stagno, sputnikmusic]             |
