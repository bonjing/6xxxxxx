,ManLemon,2011-07-11T19:19Z,Isn't there a DVDR or BRR out there? I can't seem to find this film in decent quality and I would love to see it. It's not been released on DVD yet in my country.. I don't even know if it's being released on DVD or BR at all.

The Blu-ray and DVD come out on the 9th of August in the US, so high quality rips should be out sometime soon."
