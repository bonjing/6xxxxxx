Dark Skies Sci-Fi (one of my favorites) Series based entirely on UFOlogy UFOs - from the makers of X-Files

apparently the show ending was rushed because it was canceled

another conspiracy is that the US gov didnt like the poor image it portrait-ed them in it and got the show axed

the reason it was canceled was poor ratings however it was one of the highest rated shows in Australia

Bandwidth maxed-out

will take ages to seed this out

ENJOY and HELP TO SEED!


covers majest-12, roswell, abductions and alike they did their research probably watch every UFO documentary on a p2p LOL

loved how they added Carl Sagan in it.. as a character not the real one :)
