Release Title: The Hangover II 2011 TS H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Todd Phillips
Tagline: Stu is getting married. Along with Doug, Phil, and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Teddy,
he regretfully invites Alan to Thailand for the wedding. After a quiet night on the beach
with a beer and toasting marshmallows by the camp fire, Stu, Alan and Phil wake up in a seedy
apartment in Bangkok. Doug is back at the resort, but Teddy is missing, there's a monkey with
a severed finger, Alan's head is shaved, Stu has a tattoo on his face, and they can't remember
any of it. The wolf-pack retrace their steps through strip clubs, tattoo parlors and
cocaine-dealing monkeys on the streets of Bangkok as they try and find Teddy before the wedding.
