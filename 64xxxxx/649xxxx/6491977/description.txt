	Chuck Missler - The Gospel of Mark (DivX)

Description

"Finishing Well" is the name of the game. Here was a rich, young ruler - a 1st century "yuppie" if you will - who, although getting off to a rather problematic beginning, finished well, indeed.

A rich young ruler questioned Christ about what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. Mark's Gospel includes a detail that Matthew and Luke failed to mention: " And Jesus looking upon him loved him..." This hints at the possibility that young John Mark himself may have been that rich young man.
