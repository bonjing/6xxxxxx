,Galandiel,2011-06-27T07:21Z,Wow download is going at a very decent speed! Thank you ;) 
,deadxgirl,2011-06-27T07:36Z,"NO RARS? All I saw was rars, at least have the decency to say that there is rars, or just say nothing.
And what is with that twilight but better? srsly, why?"
,Darkfall666,2011-06-27T08:19Z,"2.1Gb for a 58 minute TV Show? WTF is Dimension doing? This should be 1.5Gb or less, like everything else that's 720p an 1 hour."
,Voiceman1,2011-06-27T21:15Z,"Screw the haters (even though you do mention no RARs). You've still got the best ratio! 

Thanks! "
,mr_foofer,2011-06-28T03:37Z,"Sure enough, DIMENSION FUCKED UP.

V:10/A:0

A 2GB HD download with only 2 channel sound.

Way to waste time and bandwidth assholes!

No sense seeding this shit. Just download the shitty SD version until a PROPER is made by a group with even the slightest bit of talent. "
,Voiceman1,2011-06-28T05:52Z,"I don't know what was wrong with mr_foofer 
but what I got was freaking PERFECT! 
It even has the preview for the next episode at the end. 
V:10 A:10
I'm guessing he should be using VLC Media Player. 

Thank You Very Much tz! You Rock!"
