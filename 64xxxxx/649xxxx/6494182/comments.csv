,djrisk,2011-10-14T17:15Z,FYI - the keygen seems to work on latest release (8.8.1.5 as of this writing)
,EiNST3iN,2011-10-28T10:28Z,What the hell do you type in the 10 digit OrderID?! I tried all combinations I could think of and the stupid generator still says invalid code. WTF is up with that?
,W1ngNut13,2011-12-26T08:02Z,"Keygen works just fine, even on later versions. Haven't you guys ever heard of a false positive?"
,Mudbucket,2012-01-01T21:08Z,"Keygen does not work if a later version has been previously installed and allowed to expire.  Uninstall newer version, install this version, activation fails.  Says ""Error: Cannot decode Activation Key: Decode: cannot find pattern"".  Latest Avira finds no malware."
,zonzisa,2012-01-05T22:45Z,"Solution for error is :


1. Set system date to 1 May 2010 (from Run prompt ""CMD /K DATE"")

2. Install GoodSync.

3. Register with the use of the keygen. Choose online activation via browser.
Enter your username and think of a 10 digit OrderID.
Use keygen to generate a corresponding activation code
for the request code the application will show.

4. Reset system date to today's date.

Used new instructions to avoid the Error.
Updated to newest Version 9.0.3.7 for x86 with no problems!!"
[T],renman,2012-02-14T08:31Z,Downloaded this today 14/02/2012 followed install instructions. Works perfectly still. after installed I downloaded latest version 9077 and installed over this 8725 version. This again works perfectly. Just block network activity for this product in your firewall. Installed this on windows 7 64bit
