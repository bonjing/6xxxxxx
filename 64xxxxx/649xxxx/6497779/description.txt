Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is a 1994 film based on the 1976 novel Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice. The film was directed by Neil Jordan, and stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas,Stephen Rea and Kirsten Dunst

This is such an amazing film and one of my very favorites of all time! I was so anxious to see it when it came out in 1994. There was so much buzz surrounding this long awaited film adaption of Anne Riceâ€™s famed novel and also surrounded the cast; an A list of popular, talented, young stars entrenched in pop culture. Everything about this media text is so stylish, seductive and thoughtful. The characters are so well portrayed by an amazing cast; lead Cruise as Lestat was so outstandingly evil and captivating in the part. You couldnâ€™t youâ€™re your eyes off him. Brad Pitt, as Louis was so beautiful, yet so chronically depressed, and torched in this role. Many times in the film he had to reflect Louisâ€™s eternal despair with mere facial reactions. He pulled it off so well! Antonio Banderas who was just becoming popular at that point in time really captured the old world appeal of the greatly powerful and knowledgeable Armand. Stephen Rea who had just come off starring in another Neil Jordan masterpiece: The Crying Game, made his character Santiago so vindictive and heartless, as a member of the audience you just loved to hate him. And the surprise in a very young and wickedly talented Kirsten Dunst as Claudia who shared so many scenes with big, notable, experienced stars, and equaled their fine performances. The scene where Claudia finally realizes she will never grow up and mature to be a woman and explodes at Lestat and Louis (Cruise and Pitt) was amazing and one of the great many scenes of this film! The sets are incredible and masterfully designed along with a beautifully, haunting musical score. A wonderful film adaption of the epic novel with some wicked twists. One of the great horror films, certainly of the vampire subgenera of all time!

This is a classic piece of media to enjoy just as Halloween approaches. If you love the film, or have not seen it before you will love the extras included in this release. They really help to define the film through the revelations of the cast and crew and are a wonderful tribute to an amazing piece of work. Enjoy for Halloween! Please SEED! Cheers.

Pitt is Louis, lured by Lestat into the immorality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill.

MEMORABLE QUOTES:
Lestat: You are a vampire who never knew what life was until it ran out in a big gush over your lips
Louis: Where are we? 
Lestat: Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice, filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting, proper enough? 
Louis: We belong in hell. 
Lestat: And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that? 
Louis: But there was a hell, and no matter where we moved to, I was in it. 
Lestat: Evil is a point of view. God kills indiscriminately and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves. 
Armand: I know nothing of God, or the Devil. I have never seen a vision nor learned a secret that will damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years, I am the oldest living vampire in the world. 

FACTS: I remember clearly Anne Rice being very opposed to Tom Cruise playing Lestat, thinking that with his good guy reputation he couldnâ€™t handle portraying someone as beautifully, evil and tortured as Lestat. After she saw the film she took everything back! She loved him as Lestat and thought he totally captured his essence. There was so much anticipation of this film in 94. I remember Tom Cruise went on Oprah to promote it, and to his dismay she walked out of the film in the first ten minutes. Tom Cruise was shocked and had to do the whole show knowing she didnâ€™t watch it because she couldnâ€™t take the violence in the film. But in the long run, that appearance and this film changed his career. He was no longer labeled as the good guy, and was able to lend his talents to more varied, daring roles.
