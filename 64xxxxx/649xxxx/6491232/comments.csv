It means that they do not have the intellectual and spiritual depth to understand the beautiful lyrics in the movie. Intellectual paupers. Anyway, I have uploaded the movie split as two CD files. Each of them is a 699 MB AVI file. The specs are:

Video: Xvid 640x480 29.97fps 1259kbps
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 128kbps

No subtitles have been included as this is a movie for people who understand Urdu and specifically, Urdu Poetry. "
