,nirvy,2012-02-23T17:01Z,"Something is wrong with IMAX.Hubble.2010.Bluray.1080p.DTS.x264-yangxi111.mkv

It doesn't open in Windows Media Center with the latest Shark007 codecs. It opens in VLC, but not in the best player, Windows Media Center. Four of the other releases in this torrent I've tested open and work just fine, but not Hubble. I've yet to find a working 1080p IMAX Hubble x264 release that isn't the 3D version. Argh."
