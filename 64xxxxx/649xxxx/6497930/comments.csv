,Bmandred,2011-06-27T22:22Z,"since it seems to be compressed i guess thats its a ntsc that someone ""made a region 2 (pal) , often those releases dont work from a dvd on a chipped machine, it probably needs a loader and so on (like gecko)....."
,warrior1988,2011-06-28T00:20Z,It's NTSC but you ca use any usb loader to play it or use Priiloader to enable region free games. Or use regionfrii to change region code.
