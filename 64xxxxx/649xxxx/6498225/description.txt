"Thank you for for all this hard to find movies. I'm searching for this one: The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler (1971), in case that you have it."


Well bro, this is a pretty rough rip.  I found an old VHS scab on the net and cleaned it up as best I could.  I could not find a DvD rip on the net which is kinda odd.  If anyone knows of a better copy of this, please let me know. 
Decent 70's flick with Leslie Nielsen....Enjoy!
