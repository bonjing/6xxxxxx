Drum n Bass The Classic Breaks Vol 1 & 2 (WAV)



V1
As anyone into breakbeat knows the only way to roll with it is to have a good selection of classic and rare beats. Vol. 1 has them all. All the beats that have made jungle and drum 'n' bass what it is to day. From "Amen" to "Zulu", stopping of at "apache", "scotty" and "think" they are all here.

V2
Now is the time for the second chapter, Satori steppin' through again, giving you the beats that work. On Vol. 2 you will find a collection of beats that you won't hear on any other sample CD. Some of the beats are classic already, others so rare that even the most dedicated of train spotters will be stumped as to their origin. What ever style you are into the breaks are there for you, and as always the beats are presented in an easy to use format that will have you up and running in no time at all.
