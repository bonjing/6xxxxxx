From the Infowars web site ::

On this Friday edition of the Alex Jones Show, Alex confronts the efforts of the corporatist and bankster warmongers to take their destabilization campaign into Pakistan and crank up the conflict in Libya. Alex also talks about the effort by people around Gov. Rick Perry to absurdly characterize him as an Obama operative for criticizing him for his inaction on TSA sexual molestation. 

Alex also talks [hour 3] with regular Friday guest, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster. Chapman runs down the latest on the slowly disintegrating economy and other sundry topics. 

Though not billed on the web site, Max Keiser is a guest in the second part of hour 2, through the fist five minutes of hour 3.

Today's broadcast went 5 minutes into a 4th hour.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
