A conference that shines a laser light on the gross abuse (in some cases, verging on genocide) of non-Muslims by Muslims in all the Islamic lands. One could invite the Copts to speak, for example, and Hindus and Buddhists from Bangladesh, and Hindus and Christians from Pakistan, and Chinese non-Muslims from Malaysia and Indonesia, and Zoroastrians and Bahaii from Iran. David Littman could do a presentation on his new book, which looks at the Jews of the Maghreb from the early middle ages to the 20th century, and how they were treated; and Jews who remember what it was like to live under Muslim rule in Yemen, or Iraq, or Persia, or Syria, or Egypt (Bat Yeor could testify here) before they fled, could give their testimony. Tidiane Ndiaye could be invited to speak about his research on Arab Muslim imperialism, slavery and genocide against black Africans, Le Genocide Voile ...It would be most appropriate to have a French-speaking scholar at a conference held in Canada (Indeed, Bat Yeor too could give her presentations in French, as she is more at home in that than in English).

It could be very, very educational."
