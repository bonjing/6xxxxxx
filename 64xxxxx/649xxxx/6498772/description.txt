Obama Administration Boycots UN Racism Conference.  E-book.



Unfortunately for America, many of it's citizens
thought that Obama would bring hope and "change", but we can already see
that this is not his intention. It was merely a campaign slogan. An advertising
campaign slogan. Meaning, those who fell for it were SOLD on a lie, like some
little trinket you can purchase from an info-mercial at 3am that never works like
it was advertised.


The Obama administration refuses to attend a racism summit, because it
might actually point out REAL instances of racism, ethnic cleansing, genocide,
aparthied, and more.
