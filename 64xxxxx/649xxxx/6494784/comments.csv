,dumas1000,2011-06-26T06:02Z,This game is very old. Its split into two instillation cd-rom discs because the game was released before DVDs

Just copy the crack found in the crack folder on CD1 and paste it into the /gamedata/ directory 
on your hard-disk.  "
,qwori,2011-07-17T23:58Z,"hi,im having a problem. the setup runs fine, but stops at 47% and asks for disc two, and i cant find what to do. can you help me, please? :("
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-07-19T08:07Z,"You have to ""mount"" or ""insert"" the second CD in your DVD/CD drive.

If you have burned the game onto 2 CD's it is straightforward. 

If you use Daemon Tools, MagicDisc, PowerIso, or UltraIso, Just mount the disc images on the virtual drive which is created by this software.

Example: Download MagicDisc[Freeware],
when it is installed, look for a new drive letter.
Right-Click on the MagicDisc Icon located in the extreme bottom-right of the taskbar.

Go To the Virtual CD/DVD-ROM drive and mount the Starwars_Jedi_Knight_Jedi_Academy_1.nrg,
then run the setup and when it asks you for the second CD, mount Starwars_Jedi_Knight_Jedi_Academy_2.nrg.

After you finish copy over the crack from CD1 into the gamedata directory on your hard-drive.

If you think this is difficult, just buy 2 blank CD's
and burn the 2 NRG's separately using Nero. You should now have Disc 1 and Disc 2. Insert Disc 1 and run the setup, then when it asks you,
insert Disc 2. And remember to copy the crack from CD1 to the \gamedata directory on your hard-drive!

,qwori,2011-07-21T22:36Z,thank you so much. and i copy the crack after everythin g is installed? im going to try using nero cause i have 2 blank discs. thank you so much :D

,GreenGERMBUBBLE,2012-01-03T05:41Z,"To all who have trouble with the 2 disc, When it asks you to insert the 2 disc navigate through the menu and find disc 2 and choose the file game data. For example, if disc 2 was in drive Z the location you would have to choose would be Z/game data. Then it will proceed with the installation. Your welcome :)"
