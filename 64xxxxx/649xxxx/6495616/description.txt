            "Shocking Blue" was a Dutch rock band from The Hague that existed from 1967 to 1974. Their biggest hit, "Venus," went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970."Venus" is the only song in the history of the Billboard charts to hit number one three times (first time on February 7, 1970, second time on June 20, 1981 by "Stars On 45"; third time on September 6, 1986 by Bananarama).
             Christie was a British pop band formed at the end of the 1960s.In addition to Jeff Christie - vocalist, bassist and songwriter, they initially included guitarist Vic Elmes and drummer Mike Blakely who happened to be the younger brother of The Tremeloes' Alan Blakely.In 1969, Christie offered his composition "Yellow River" to The Tremeloes. They recorded it to release as a single, but when they changed their minds they allowed Christie to use the backing track themselves. The result was a UK number one hit in May 1970, and subsequently #23 in the U.S."San Bernadino", another highly commercial song, gave them another Top Ten hit, but after one further minor hit "Iron Horse", they faded from contention. The second and last album, "For All Mankind" was issued only on the Continent..
            "Mungo Jerry" is the name of a pop group whose greatest success was in the early 1970s, though they have continued throughout the years with an ever-changing line-up, always fronted by Ray Dorset. They are remembered above all for their classic hit "In the Summertime", the evergreen "Lady Rose" and the rock smash "Alright Alright Alright". Their name was inspired by the poem "Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer", from T.S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.
