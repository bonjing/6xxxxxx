700kbps! sounds great

i'm 24 so i was just a kid back then but this was the very first cassette tape I ever purchased. I still have it and I don't have a set up cassette player in the house. 

Foo Fighters are cool too. ytube the song Razor. It's a b-side, so not too popular / available but your eye's will probably get wet and you might have a lump in your throat. Good song, probably not really popular because of the subject. "
