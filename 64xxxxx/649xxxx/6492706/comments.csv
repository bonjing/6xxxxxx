,maki1999,2011-06-24T23:49Z,extremezone can you please upload Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 2 game WITH WORKING CRACK?????? thanks :))) i always download your torrents
,dumas1000,2011-06-25T00:26Z,"I had no idea this game was coming out for the PC at all, much less with Games for Windows-Live support. Wikipedia usually does a good job of listing all achievement-based PC games, but they completely missed this one. As a side note, if you have an Xbox Live membership, you can use that account while playing Games for Window-Live games. Even while playing cracked/pirated versions. You don't sign your profile in online. You play using your profile while offline, but all of the achievements you earn still count. I've done this a lot. It's not going to get your banned. Because if the game is cracked, then you cannot even go online. Microsoft isn't going to know whether you bought it legally or not if you are playing it offline. It is the same thing that people who own modded 360s do. Just don't break the street date and no one will really ever suspect anything."

Also it's nice to see that the game is at a small size. 

Thanks to all the seeders, managed to download this in 2hr 30 mins so very quick download. I will be seeding to this game for a long time. 

I am going to install this now, and as there's no crack, I am going to assume it's not needed. 

Thanks to extremezone + Skidrow. "

Anyone has any solution to this please?"
,mumihp,2011-06-25T22:02Z,"OK, it seems that that the game has installed, 1st installation didn't work, but second time it worked.

Also I don't understand why you need a serial, I installed this, and this game didn't even ask for one.

Anyway, this game is very good, and it's a very good download. "

People who are new to this sort of thing should also note that just because a cracked game is working for some people doesn't mean it is going to work for you, it depends on your hardware and software specs (what chip-set, CPU, etc. you have), also cracked games tend to have a habit of being unstable and may crash occasionally.
And if you like the game then buy it and show the manufacturer your support. "

For all of you having problems with Windows Live failing to start,  I had the same problem. Windows Live wouldn't even start and I kept getting some error. I had to uninstall everything (including the game itself) and also had to uninstall Windows Live ID Sign-In Assistant. Took me a while to find out that this was causing me the problem. After I uninstalled everything, I just ran the installer straight from the disk again and everything worked. Created an offline account and enjoyed the game. 

Thanks again for the upload!!!!!!!!!"

@sanja to play online you need a legit cd key. Cracked games rarely work online. 
Buy it, if you like it that much."

The game has a bug that will corrupt your save games upon exiting, making it impossible to save your game. Sega released a patch to fix this issue but its only available through the Games for Windows LIVE client. A key is required to get this patch and the one provided in the torrent does not work. I'm almost certain SEGA put this bug in the game on purpose to deter piracy.

It would be awesome if skidrow released a torrent of the patched version of this game."
