,Beanies,2011-08-26T23:43Z,"Works fine, do not be mislead by the comments, this does not need to be downloaded. Just run your FruitNinja.exe file and you'll be able to play.

No viruses, I scanned with ESET Smart Security 4 and MBAM, both came out with 0 threats.

Thank you for this great torrent."

,highgrav,2012-06-17T23:00Z,"Simple sound problem fix, downloaded the official trial version and copy pasted the working sound folder into the full version. 

Hopefully zipping and unzipping the files isn't what corrupted them in the first place because I uploaded them for you guys. Enjoy.

And if that doesn't work you can always do what I did originally."
