It\'s time to rejoice again. The amazing demo of the mighty
Highgate is given another release together with older
tracks, shiny new intermezzo and Live Ritual on one ring of
plastic. If somehow you managed to miss that band and their
hybrid of minimalist yet ultra-powerful doom, noise, sludge
and grim black metal, here is your chance to get addicted
to captivating and uplifting ugliness. If however you are
the surviving victim of their oppressive sound, you know
that it is yet another blessing. There is nothing even
remotely optimistic in the Kentucky deadliest\'s message Â–
only desolation, hatred and inhabited earth. And we
wouldn\'t want it to be any different.
