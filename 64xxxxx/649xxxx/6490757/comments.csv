The [Multi5] means that it's in five languages, so the answer to your question is no.

If you're real question was, ""Is there an English option?"" You can either download it and find out or you can look it up.

WiiTDB says that the five languages on the PAL version are: EN FR ES IT NL (English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch)

English isn't always included in the Multi5, however. The Multi5-PAL version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is in FR DE ES IT NL. French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch. The English got their own PAL version. (Presumably so that when the Multi5 got pirated, it wouldn't be as popular in the States)"

,rokas1997,2011-08-24T23:12Z,"yeah, WHY .ISO NOT .WBFS???"
,blombardo,2011-12-17T12:30Z,a lot of people still don't know how to convert from iso to wbfs; and only recently the cfg usb loader can read wbfs off of a standard format drive - give it time and more will use it...  (plus - if your wbfs files get corrupt - no file repair programs can fix it - but if its an iso you can uncorrupt them with any program) - learned that the hard way...  keep backups of all the torrent files so you can recheck if /when needed lol
