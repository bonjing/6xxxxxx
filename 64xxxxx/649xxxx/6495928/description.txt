Today, it seems everyoneâ€”from multinational corporations to your kidâ€™s second-grade teacherâ€”has a blog. They all have one, in part, because they have information they want to share with othersâ€”from customers and clients to neighbors and parents. But to actually build a good blogâ€”to create a blog people want to readâ€”takes thought, planning, and some effort. From picking the right TypePad plan and working with domains to managing posts and building a community, creating a successful blog involves making critical decisions at each step. In this book by blogger extraordinaire Scott McNulty, youâ€™ll learn how to:

Set up your account and work with blog-specific settings.
Customize your blog to fit your personal or business needs.
Manage your site with TypePadâ€™s Dashboard.
Monitor and make sense of traffic.
Work with pages andâ€”of courseâ€”publish your posts.
Deal with comments, manage trackbacks, and handle comment spam.
Find a stock themeâ€”or customize one yourself.
Work with images and photos.
