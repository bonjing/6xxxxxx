,edium,2011-06-24T01:02Z,"why dont you hack into some of the law firms who are sending threatinening letters to file sharers and leak their emails and internal docs?

show them that any law firm who doesnt respect filesharing will be also hacked.

soon no one will be willing to send these letters to file sharers in fear of having their internal docs leaks."

,calyx237,2011-06-24T03:54Z,"They make out like they intentionally went after AZDPS in order to look good, when in fact someone probably gave them a tip off that the site was vulnerable. or perhaps they even got lucky with a google dork or mass automated scan. I still respect them for fucking shit up though..."

TAHIR SQUARE EVERYWHERE!

You folks rock! I wish I knew how to do what you do. Arizona is ill with the crazy racist freaks. 

Remember: Neo didn't just target the local cops. He took down Agent Smith. Aim high.

MACHETE!

,herpderpderp123,2011-06-24T17:03Z,"I second the request to target Monsanto!
I think any sane, non-corrupt person will agree, that it's not desirable to have one single entity control an ever increasing share of global food production.
They abuse the corrupt and defective patent system to get total control over seeds, and thus over farmers and eventually food production.
Take them down, there are few if any who deserve it more!"

,ha4012,2011-06-24T21:20Z,I'd like to see the Ku Klux Klan and Blog del Narco (a blog that sympathizes with cartels and even openly has reports on deaths of Mexican police officers) get hacked. They deserve it.
,BoonesFerry,2011-06-24T23:00Z,****NOTE****  One of the files contained in this torrent tried accessing the interent. Thankfully I keep a close watch on everything on my system that tries accessing the internet. The file is 2009007981Ayon397.4lbs.exe
,ha4012,2011-06-25T00:35Z,"Again, even though Lulz probably doesn't read these comments, let's hear my requests!:

*KKK - Take those a-holes down and for good
*Blog del Narco - F*** the drug cartels. They're worse than Arizona. They kill innocent people and essentially are oppressors. 
*Monsanto - Everyone hates them. Take those a-holes down!
*JewWatch - An antisemitic hate site. If you put ""jew"" on google, that will be the second link. A petition tried to stop them, but it failed. TAKE THESE F***ERS DOWN FOR GOOD!
*Not really a hack, but put Rebecca Black's contact information! 

I would do the same thing as you are doing, but I'm don't know how to hack websites. "

While all this hacking is an insight into most things theres nothing that goes WOW,what about something like top military database with some the plane designs or the elusive alien tech that i think most of us would love to see first hand :)"

They are more than likely just a group of punk kids seeking attention (attention-whores).  I'm surprised this Arizona thing is still that big an issue to anyone outside of Arizona and the illegal immigrant population of the USA.  BTW, LulzSec disbanded today.:)"
,Siobhan.Oleary,2011-06-29T03:17Z,"Allow me to thank you, LulzSec for your great work. I hope your masters paid you well. After all, now they are tightening control on the internet and censorship and the scaremongered Average Joe is applauding them - all thanks to you.

Hope you will enjoy spending the money made from CIA's drug distribution and World Bank's thieving interest rates and hidden charges.

But remember: what goes around - comes around.

Sweet Dreams"
,sarsapil,2011-06-29T18:21Z,"Sorry, fellas, here I must disagree... They are only preventing people from flooding the US with unwanted immigration. Mexico and other countries have to clean up their act, the US doesn't have to solve the world's problems and then become chaos to please economic and other refugees. It's in fact AN INVASION and has to be dealt with that way. Besides most of those don't even want to become Americans, they even refuse to learn and speak English, the country's language. You're endangering the lives and privacy of people who are just doing their jobs. Shame on you."

,missingxtension,2011-07-19T07:04Z,"Oh please you are going to target arizona for this and leave the City of Irving out of it?
The City if Irving has deported more people that arpaio, and its only a small city compared to what arpio has.
They discriminate in any possible way, the new major of irving wants for the police to take license plate numbers of apartments where they are known to be majority mexican residents. Of course after that its unclear what they plan to do with that, but if they are gathering intel, it is because they are looking for targets."
,godfather,2011-07-27T13:48Z,"The police in Fayetteville, GA harass any non-white or poor person that comes to town. Three times in three months I was pulled over in winter and my vehicle was searched. Each time, they told me they were looking for marijuana and found none. Once, they had the k9 unit come and they even let the dog in my car. 

Minorities and poor people simply ARE NOT ALLOWED there."
