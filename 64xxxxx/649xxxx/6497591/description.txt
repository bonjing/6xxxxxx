Mantronix was an influential 1980s hip hop and electro funk music group founded by DJ
Kurtis Mantronik [Kurtis el Khaleel], and rapper MC Tee [Toure Embden]. Mantronix
underwent several genre [and line / up] changes during its 7-year existence [1984 / 1991],
from old school hip hop to electro funk to house music, but the group is primarily remembered
for its original, heavily synthesized blend of old school hip-hop and electro funk.
