Another of my bloat reductions  -  tt0083866

v2:  fixed extras

The original, un-retouched version of E.T., which many people seem to treasure over the retouched version, was only available as an 8 GB VIDEO_TS folder here:

=================================================
Death to Digital E. T.! Long live Puppet E. T.! 

This is the real thing: the movie Blockbuster, Netflix, and a hundred torrents didn\'t value you enough to let you see! This is the original 1982 version of E. T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. Government agents carry guns, Michael isn\'t allowed to dress as a terrorist, and best of all, NO DIGITAL E. T.! Blockbuster and Netflix were too stupid to carry it. Every torrent maker out there was too stupid to rip it. But this time, we got it right! Ripped straight from the 2-disc Collector\'s Edition, in its full uncompressed glory, here is the original E. T.! 

- by DVD Liberation	
=================================================

In this torrent you will find the movie in a 2.75 GB XviD AVI with the DTS and AC3 5.1 English audio tracks, two DVD extras, and English and Spanish subtitles.  The two audio tracks alone took almost 1 GB.  :-)

All of the \"unretouched\" touchstones are here:  The Feds carry shotguns, the \"terrorist\" dialog line is intact, ET running is just a light on a rail.

For those of you who prefer it, and for completeness, I will post a similar torrent with the Spanish and French audio tracks.  

If anyone has trouble with this AVI which has DTS as the primary audio track, I can re-post an AVI with just the AC3 5.1 track on request.
