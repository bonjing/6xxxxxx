It says I've been trying to download this for ten weeks and three days, which obviously is more than two and a half months. I'm only at seventeen and a half percent.

My computer is almost always on, and like I said, since this is in such terrible need of seeders, I will continuously seed it whenever my computer is on, which is usually always. I'm doing that currently with another file that took forever to get, one called ""Zillion - Let It Rock!"". Just please seed this long enough for me to get the rest of it so I can do that. It would be much appreciated."
