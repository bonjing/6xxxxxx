Fibichuv Ulis was a Czech band; they made only one album (unfortunately) and it was named: Bingo Bengho. Apparently they were under the influence of some sort of psychedelic rock and also well known Captain Beefheart. There is no way of getting this album from any shop and as far as I know, not many people own it so I decided to share it. It is my first torrent so if there is anything wrong with the file just contact me and i will try my best to fix it.
