,fearloathingandparanoia,2011-06-30T17:36Z,"download speed sucks! seed motherfuckers, seed!"
,ashenpirate,2011-08-27T20:16Z,"Download speed for me hovering around 235kB/s, thanks! I'll be sure to see when it's done for me."

,SpiderPg,2011-12-14T19:29Z,"Very low quality rips, audio is bad as well.

Some episodes have skipping and the aspect ratio can change a lot within a few seconds.

The episodes are also stamped with the rippers information in the top left corner.

Unfortunately it is the only torrent i could find with a decent number of seeds - as mentioned in the description there is a DVD rip set but at the time of writing this there's like 5 seeds and it would take forever to download."
