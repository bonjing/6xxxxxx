Brink Update 7 info:


A brand-new update is now available for the PC version of Brink, containing a huge stack of improvements and fixes. End game chat, a new Stopwatch results screen, VoIP sliders, a fix for invisible players, networking optimizations, and a massive amount of weapon tweaks are all among the things you'll be getting in this one, and we've assembled the complete changelog for your perusal below. All you need to do to get the update is sign into Steam.

For the dedicated server admins among you, there's a new server available, too, and it's freshly optimized to cut the filesize down to a third. If you haven't already, we recommend updating your server as soon as possible - as before, players with the new update will not be able to connect to servers running the old version of Brink.

With all that out of the way, here's the full changelog for this update:
