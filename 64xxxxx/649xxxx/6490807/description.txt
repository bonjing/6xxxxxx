After Pilot Talk 2, CR here again with Curren$yâ€™s â€œWeekend At Burniesâ€. The album drops June 28th 2011.
Description: New Orleans rapper and Hip-Hop connoisseur Curren$y thrives on making music on his own terms. With his â€œJet Lifeâ€ mantra about living life to the fullest, the savvy rhyme spitter (why do you think they call him â€œSpittaâ€?) is focused on a lyrical devotion to the truth and authenticity. Itâ€™s because of this ethos that the man born Shante Anthony Franklin has transcended any regional rap stereotypes to become a favorite of bloggers, critics, fans and everyone in between. Now aligned with Warner Bros., the plan is to let Spitta be himself, but have even more people get acquainted with the Jet (Just Enjoy This Sh*t) Life.
