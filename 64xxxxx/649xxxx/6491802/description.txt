                        Golden Axe Trilogy
                        ******************
Golden Axe 
----------
You family is dead and your entire village is in ruins. There's only one creature evil enough to slaughter and destroy an entire town of innocent civilians, the Death Adder. In Golden Axe, its up to you to exact revenge rid the world of one of the most vile and heinous beings to ever walk the planet. As either Gilius Thunderhead or Tyris Flare, you'll journey through a world full of dragons, undead skeletons, and brutal barbarians as you seek out Death Adder. Utilize your impressive axe skills or your mastery of magic to destroy any foe that dares to challenge you, and enlist the help of several animal friends that will make you an unstoppable force. Whether youre alone or with a friend, Death Adder must pay the consequences.

There are two modes of play in Golden Axe: Arcade mode and Battle mode. Arcade mode pits you against the minions of the evil Dark Adder in numerous levels. This mode is identical to the arcade game, you go through numerous levels vanquishing enemies of various types. You can use magic to aid you, or you can just beat the crap out of everyone such as Streets of Rage or Final Fight. This mode is a blast to play and is simple, mindless fun. Battle mode (rather unique for it's time), one-on-one fighting mode pitting you against one of Dark Adder's many minions.

The character designs were pretty cool for their time (hey, who can't love a game with an elf in it?), and they were all packed with details, and rather large in stature. Even the enemies in the game have tons of details, you'll be able to distinguish snouts on some of the enemies, as well as mouths. The in-game environments were beautiful, all of them featured a unique look and feel that set them apart from the rest, and they were all full of tiny details that added to the level.

The music fits the game's mythological theme perfectly, all of the songs have a heroic sound to them. The sound effects are, for the most part excellent.

Golden Axe features:
+Based on the arcade hit
+Two playable characters
+Use weapons and magic to defeat your enemies
+Recruit animal friends to help your cause
+One or two players

Golden Axe 2
------------
Dark Guld, the Lord of Darkness, has arisen from his slumber and begun his quest for world domination with the help of his evil followers. As heroes of the last great battle, it is once again up to the Amazon, Barbarian and Dwarf to defeat Dark Guld and recapture the Golden Axe. Only then will peace and harmony be restored to the land...

Golden Axe II is a side-scrolling action game that pits your warrior (a male, female, or dwarf) against several creatures set in a world of fantasy. Skeletons, club-wielding grunts, lizard-men, and magicians will all fall to your sword or axe as you progress through each level in your quest to defeat Dark Guld. The characters' moves are basic, consisting of slashes, charges and jump attacks, but a special move such as a double-sided sword or back-flip attack is available as well. As in the original, you can steal the dragon mounts of some of the enemies and use their attacks against them. One creature will tail-whip, one will kick with its hind legs, and another will breathe fire.

Each character also has an affinity towards magic, the strength of which depends on the number of magic books you pick up along the way. The dwarf draws upon the magic of the earth and can send boulders raining down from the sky, the Amazon has fire based magic and may summon a huge dragon or phoenix to scorch her enemies, and the barbarian can use the power of the wind to swirl away his opponents. Magic is best saved until the end of each level to wear down the powerful bosses and henchmen.

Several features could have been added to help set this title apart from Golden Axe. New twists like riding a dragon through the skies, playing as a monster, gaining levels, mastering finishing moves, or even using different weapons. One thing that has changed are the original game's elves and potions â€“ now they're cloaked magicians and books, respectively. It gives the game a whole new feel... All kidding aside, those looking for a significant departure from Golden Axe should pass on this sequel. It is the same hack-and-slash action with a slight change of scenery.

The graphics have been upgraded and although they are very similar, they are given a lot more detail. The sprites are more detailed and the three characters are given some new features. Gilius has a whiter beard, which shows signs of age while Ax and Tyrus both have headbands, which make them look more like barbarians. Enemies are impressive because of the sheer size of some of them. The Minotaur, for example, has this evil grin on his face.
The backgrounds are brilliant, looking much cooler this time around. The castle levels have skeletons lying on the ground, which is great. It looks like the remains of a battle or something. The backgrounds are a massive improvement because they have loads of detail, unlike in the first game.

The music is another improvement and is lot more dramatic. It still has a medieval/fantasy theme that obviously fits in with the game. Golden Axe II's score isn't as creative as its predecessor but can more than hold its own. The overall sound quality is superior, however, mainly because the music is very powerful and sounds so much clearer. Even when you first start the game up you hear this pounding drum beat followed by a dramatic tune that really gets you in the mood of the game.

Golden Axe II game features:
+The 3 characters from the original return
+More enemies and different beasts to ride
+Use a mix of might and magic to defeat the enemies in your path
+Action for one or two players

Golden Axe 3
------------
This Prince of Darkness has taken away the Golden Axe and put an evil curse over all the warriors. However, one of the heroes has their curse relieved and is sent to set things straight â€“ lift curse off others, defeat the villian and return with the Golden Axe.

You get four characters to choose from: Amazon, barbarian, panther man, and a big gladiator-type brute. All play more or less the same, with the difference being the amount of damage dished out. The gladiator is slow but deals the most powerful blows, panther man is quickest but is also the weakest of the bunch, etc. Your energy is now displayed by a long health bar, as opposed to the individual bars from the previous games

Golden Axe 3 features:
+Several levels but with different paths to take through them now
+2 new characters from previous installments, but Gilius Thunderhead is no longer  
 playable
+More interactive environments with destructible objects
+Action for one or two players
