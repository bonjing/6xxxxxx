Jake Humphrey presents coverage of the European Grand Prix at Valencia, 
the eighth race of the 2011 Formula One season. It is 12 years since a British driver 
won the European Grand Prix, a statistic that both Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button 
will be desperate to end as they chase world championship leader Sebastian Vettel. 
The McLaren duo both claimed podium places in Valencia last year, but it was Vettel 
who took the victory, finishing five seconds clear of Hamilton. Home hopes will be 
pinned on Ferrari star Fernando Alonso, who won this race in 2007, 
when it was held at Germany's Nurburgring.
