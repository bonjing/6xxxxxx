[Notes]

The bonus DVD with music videos, interviews, live songs, and more.

Source: As always, the best flags and specs for the best releases.  We never
hold back on quality.  48000hz 2ch AC3 DVD.

Ok, we only ripped this for the die-hard MM1 fans, including a group member
(you know who you are) <3.
This DVD doesn't vocalize the questions given during the interviews, so I
went through the painstaking process of including the questions in the nfo,
so you know what the group members and affiliates are responding to.
Again, I wouldn't have done this if I, like others, didn't love this group
and what they do.
So..enjoy!! ;)
