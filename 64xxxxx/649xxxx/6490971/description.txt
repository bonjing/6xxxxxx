PLOT:
Feature film for release Spring 2011 following four superbike riders
through their dramatic British Superbike Season. They are the new
GLADIATORS, battling at 200MPH, riding through torturous conditions
and risking life and limb at every race meeting. Only one can be
the true champion. The film follows the great British hope, Tommy Hill
a fearless racer who cheated death at 14 years old. It tracks
James Ellison, the northern heartthrob who came second in 2009
and HAS to win to save his career. Also Gary Mason, an ex privateer
now racing on a factory Kawasaki bike who has everything to prove
And finally black leather clad Josh 'Bad Boy' Brookes, the Australian
out to steal the crown from the British hopefuls. Film score by
David Vanian of the Damned, music by Phil Collen of Def Leppard
and Manraze. Directed by Mark Sloper
