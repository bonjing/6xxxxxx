Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl - Episode 1 ("The Young Boy's Life Changed That Day") English Dub

Not like my usual stuff, but it definitely appeals to the hopeless romantic side of me :D Yes, there is yuri (And transformation, technically...), but it's not your typical fapfapfap yuri. Definitely a good watch, plenty of laughs :) Rather intricate story with lots of context that gets explained more as the show progresses

Let me know how you feel, I'll get to uploading the rest (Up to Ep9) depending on your response!
