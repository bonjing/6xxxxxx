Ive searched for it everywhere and cant find it expect for a used copy on amazon...98 bucks, fuck that.

and dont bother with the 2009/10/11 version as they all suck like shit...the 2008 version in the only worthwhile version.

Thx in advance."

,zedmike,2011-09-11T04:08Z,"Good day TheThingy. i cant find a way to get in contact with you... as i would expect... and i also cant find a way to graciously do this so here: Huge project, doing a documentary on Pirating to submit to the  film festivals this season, hopefully. I have always been a huge fan of your uploads, adobe especially. We would humbly ask for few comments if you can.

PS- sorry for the spamming"

,jlajhoe,2011-12-18T19:21Z,"yo thethingy, im silent most of the time... but i cant stand just here reading all the comments and praises you received. its like a shame not to humbly thank you for all these deeds. you are seeding for free? you are beast! when i see thethingy, i dont need to scan my downloads, and most of the time i care less about errors... simply because i been following your updates and never even once i encounter errors... its like OMG THANKS. those training dvds specially by linda were my favorites... Thanks a lot..."
