At first I installed v6.2.5.0823.Multilanguage LAXiTY  and it worked perfect at the start. One day I forgot and I connected to internet while the app was running. Since then it changed to ""unregistered"" and fails to register even if I disconnect from internet.
I did an uninstall, cleaned the registry and file system. Restarted the PC (Win7-64) and tried to install while disconnected from internet, but NOWAY. 
Then I tried your cracked version of (6.2.3.0622 + Rus) and changed replaced with cracked dll but it somehow is still aware and wants to register. 
I mean when clicking on ""Register"" it tries to verify and then says that It failed to connect to internet...
:(

Thanks for uploading."
