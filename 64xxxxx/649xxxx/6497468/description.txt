Ahoy mateys.

The original booty had nasty malware hidden inside. It wasn't Lulzsec that put it there, it was already present on AT&T's files.

So here we have the 50 days of Lulz release but with the trojan files removed. Enjoy.

For those of you with salt in your veins and fire in your bellies, written below be a treasure map (magnet link) to the original Lulzsec files! Be warned, the map does lead to booby traps (trojans) for any of ye silly enough to use Windows to sail the seven proxseas.


The "Bootable USB" files are the scurvy dogs!
