,mehdidhem,2011-07-05T14:52Z,please somebody tell me how to seed 
,djroosta,2011-07-08T15:01Z,"@ The people who don't know how to seed.....

Search Google, I'm not going to do the washing up for you......

But if you are too lazy then read on....

After downloading the torrent, either using Vuze or another program, the download completes.

This goes into your completed section, where it will start seeding, if set to automatic, if not (I Use Vuze) go to your completed section click the download and press start...

It should now seed

:)"

,MiiST3R,2011-07-15T15:52Z,"Gooood Torrent, but when i go load a game save, the game freezes and shuts down. Help?"
,aliatad,2011-07-25T14:47Z,How is the sound issue sorted?
,petewills,2011-07-31T04:05Z,"Radio Stations don't work and freeze game every time you change vehicles.
Delete ONLY the radio station files and use 'User defined tracks' to play.
(WCTR is not included).
Maybe the massive compression screwed it up.
The GTA SA music extractor could only extract seven 3/4 min tracks which worked,
so there must be some problem with the audio streams."
,Najmulthecool97,2011-08-20T18:18Z,But the file is short. Maybe it would be corrupt. So tell me honest that it works fine... as u stated??
