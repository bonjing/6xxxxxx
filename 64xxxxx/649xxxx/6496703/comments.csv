You sd upload films fr masses & now you are asking fr regional releases wtf..The recent bolly releases really suck so i dnt think der is any need to upload them & lets face it the standard of indian films is pretty low..if you are really interested in bolly releases you can check out uploads by SaM..he uploads quality releases in small size.."

To really enjoy you rips I want to watch them with surround sound [i.e 5.1 AAC]. Could you pls add the audio file in small size also, when you upload, as optional file to download.
