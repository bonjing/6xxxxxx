I used the 17cd DG Chopin set as my base but took out some performances I didn't care for and put better ones in their place.

CD1 (I used the Artur Rubinstein concertos)
CD2 (unchanged)
CD3 (Ballades and Fantaisie by Perahia rest is the same)
CD4 (Etudes by Perahia rest is the same)
CD5 and CD6 (Mazurkas by Rubinstein. the posth. ones are by Ohlsson, and last 2 by Ashkenazy)
CD7 and CD8 (Nocturnes by Rubinstein, last 2 by Ohlsson)
CD9 (unchanged)
CD10 (unchanged)
CD11 (Op.45 Pollini, first 3 impromptus by Perahia, fantaisie-impromptu by Horowitz, rest is the same)
CD12 (Op.16 by Horowitz, other 3 rondos by Ohlsson, Scherzos are unchanged)
CD13 (Sonata 2 by Horowitz rest unchanged)
CD14 (tracks 1-3 and 5-8 by Ohlsson 4 is unchanged)
CD15 (first 14 Waltzes by Rubinstein rest by Ohlsson)
CD16 (unchanged)
CD17 (unchanged)

Used EAC and LAME 3.98.4 64 bit secure mode with --preset extreme -q 0 
For Ohlsson used Foobar2000 and LAME with same settings so you are getting the best VBR and quality on all MP3's!

Enjoy!
