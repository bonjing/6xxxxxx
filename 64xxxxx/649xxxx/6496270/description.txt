A high-fiber cookbook that is good for the heart and gives you practically the most variety of any cookbook on the market. 500 High-Fiber Recipes proves that upping fiber doesnâ€™t mean cutting flavor, or spending hours in the kitchen on complicated recipes.
Packed with everything from savory stews to sweet treats, readers get high-fiber versions of foods they thought they had to give up like breads, pasta dishes, and desserts. Itâ€™s easy to stay the high-fiber course when readers find chapters dedicated to every craving imaginable including international cuisines, from Cajun and Mexican to Italian and Asian.
