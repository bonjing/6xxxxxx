I downloaded this BBC Wild Series 12xDVD Box Set torrent off of Demonoid and then I encoded it to be a small fraction of it's original size for those of us who don't fool around with DVD's and rather a new TB every few months for archiving smaller, more economical sized files instead of big fat VIDEO_TS's &/or ISO's. The original of this was 50GB+, mine is 5.45GB, so about 1/10th of it's original size. Specs are as follows:

12 DVD's - 34 x 50 minutes = 27:42:40
400MB ea.
