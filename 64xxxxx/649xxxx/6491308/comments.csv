I love You!

The default *.drg files differ in size with yours. What is the meaning of this? I have the default from the installation replaced with yours."
,xprokiller,2011-07-07T19:37Z,"@htortilla
It just means some of the Doses have more complex sounds, or they take more time to listen to them."

Thanks for noticing my comment. I have it myself discovered. If I-Doser opens and files are in the Dose Files-folder for the program, then the size of the files do a little bit change.

There are so many files, you don't know were to begin.  Therfore you must go to the homepage of I-Doser to get a better understandig of the grouping."
,porkipig123,2011-10-03T20:30Z,Awesome! Thanks man.
,willmon18,2011-10-15T06:18Z,Cool finally I actually find a real one that actually has the premium version of I-Doser instead of the free version or the old premium version. Thanks.
,colazex,2011-10-16T01:55Z,"Hey man, I don't mean to sound rude or something but are these doses legit? 

I've seen some torrents with all doses but most of the doses were like almost indentical in sound with a few changes and stuff... I mean, you have to buy the doses soo I was wondering how did you actually GET the doses? I'm sure you didn't buy them (because HOG and GOH are 200 bucks!). Again sorry for asking, I'm just wondering because I don't want to have some placebo effect on fake doses..."
