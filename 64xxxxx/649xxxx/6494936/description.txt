              Magic The Gathering - Duels of The Planeswalkers [PC]
              =====================================================
Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers is a somewhat simplified adaptation of the Magic: the Gathering trading card game. As in the original card game, the player casts magic spells to summon various creatures, add enchantments to them, and cause various other effects, and attacks the other players to destroy them. The game is meant to be easy for new M.T.G. players to pick up, while not disappointing experienced players. Some of the game mechanics, such as tapping lands, is done automatically, and there's no deck construction - only unlocking cards and pre-built decks.

The game has two campaigns, for single-player and two-player co-operative play. In online play, in addition to classic two-player duels, the game supports two-player co-operative play and free-for-all play, up to 4 players. Online play also has ranked play modes and a leaderboard. The game also has various puzzle challenges to solve.
