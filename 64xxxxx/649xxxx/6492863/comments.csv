,Jackass Jimm,2011-06-25T23:59Z,"Do the Deluxe songs have artwork, proper tags, and in 320?

guess I'll download them"
,Jackass Jimm,2011-06-26T01:31Z,"the deluxe songs and the bonus songs don't seem to be too good in quality.  Worse than the ones I have, actually.  

Where did you get them from (source)?

Did you upconvert the songs to 320 or were they ripped at 320 from the start?

,Sugar_Skull,2011-06-26T06:28Z,@JAckassJimm If you have better quality tracks please share man.
,Jackass Jimm,2011-06-26T19:29Z,"I'm thinking of doing a torrent that has all of the songs in high quality.  At the moment, I have the 3 deluxe songs in high quality (got it from someone on the armpit forums).  They're just missing the artwork.

But my Middle Finger and Los Angeles tracks aren't that good.  

For some reason, you files seem to have low volume (when compared to my files), which I attribute to being songs from 128 or 192...but upconverted (which does nothing to the quality aside for making the file bigger).  

Thanks though.  Spread the Gold Cobra!  I'll try to upload something once I get all of the songs in good quality."
,Sugar_Skull,2011-06-26T21:43Z,Right on would appreciate it.
