,steve8852,2011-06-25T06:19Z,850x474?? Seriously. Why?
,ashsama2,2011-06-26T19:31Z,Not worth the bandwidth :)
,snowbirds,2011-06-26T22:53Z,"Sample looks great: A/V = 10/10.

Thanks TvTeam!"
[V],matimike,2011-06-27T03:48Z,a/v 10 thanks
,snowbirds,2011-06-27T07:52Z,"Okay, now that I'm watching the actual movie it's not anything like the sample.  

The sample was perfectly clear even in dark parts, but the movie download is very pixilated in dark parts...

Looks like the sample is from a different, higher-quality source than the full download... :("
,snowbirds,2011-06-27T07:53Z,"SO, my revised rating is:  A/V = 10/8"
,snowbirds,2011-06-27T07:59Z,"SO, it looks like TvTeam was putting a sample that isn't from the same source as the full-length movie they're uploading.  My guess is the sample is from some HD trailer or something.....

This is the same kind of lying bullshit that Extremezone is well known for....   I just don't understand this.  Will someone please explain to me what these people have to gain by lying to the pirate community?  I don't get it..."
,pinzmoo,2011-06-27T11:43Z,"@snowbirds movies free man.

thx for the up TvTeam"
,ericv1984,2011-06-27T22:29Z,"@snowbird, who cares? Like Pinzmoosaid, the movies free. Don't criticize a free movie, just give A/V quality ratings."
,snowbirds,2011-06-28T03:18Z,"No, it's not free.  I pay for my internet connection.  I pay for my bandwidth.  My time is valuable.  When someone wastes my time because they lie to me, I don't like it.

I'm not criticizing the movie.  I'm criticizing the fact that the uploaders appear to be using a false sample to misrepresent their torrent.

To all of you who seem to think that speaking up about a lie is a worse thing to do than lying to thousands of people.... what the hell happened to you guys???  Seriously.  Have you grown that accustomed to being lied to that you just don't care anymore?  Dudes, ""therapy"".  Check it out.  It might help you recover your testicles and spine.

Meanwhile, for the rest of us, there are actual rules for torrent sites.  One of the basic rules is you don't lie to people about your uploads.  Go figure."
,gumelini,2011-06-28T16:14Z,"@ snowbirds

I agree with you 100%, but what can you do..."
,deafdarkman,2011-06-29T15:35Z,"English subtitle please, I search everywhere and nothing, anybody know where to get it "
,hempy96,2011-07-05T18:23Z,"True that. It is free. It's not like he lied and you ended up with a virus.
It takes a special kind of spoiled to complain about the quality of a gift, whether lied about or not.
If you don't like it, then stop stealing it... um, excuse me, pirating it."
,Jenzo123,2011-07-06T03:46Z,"Good point, hempy96, The point of this site it to rate the quality... not give an hateful opinion."
,adam273,2011-07-07T22:29Z,What is VODRIP?
,Phuk0ff,2011-07-08T22:46Z,@adam273 Video On Demand rip

,jh3141,2011-07-20T10:01Z,"@snowbirds - neither TvTeam nor extremezone are the sources of the files they upload.  They just copy scene releases, seed them and put them up here so they're easier to get hold of.  In this case, the releaser is 'SiC'."
