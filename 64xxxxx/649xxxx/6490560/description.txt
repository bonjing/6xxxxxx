Release Notes:

VICTORY is a band with a very long history and this is the newest album
that has been delayed since 2009. The band was formed in 1984 in
Hanover Germany and has been through many lineup changes. This is the
first studio album with their current lead vocalist. Unfortunately, I
cannot remember if I have ever heard him before, so I canÂ’t tell if
Jioti Parcharidis (the new singer) is better or not than Charlie Huhn.
VICTORY has a traditional Metal sound that harkens back to glory days
of the 80Â’s. The band was very popular in Germany and has toured the
world extensively. In total, the band has released 10 albums. ItÂ’s been
a while since I reviewed such a well established band. I have been
getting a lot of unsigned independent bandÂ’s CDs lately. The sound is
rich and filled with classic Metal guitars and choruses. They sound a
bit like ACCEPT and have some early SCORPIONS influences as well.

For some reason the band decided to record the song, Â“IÂ’m So ExcitedÂ”
by the POINTER SISTERS. Yeah, thatÂ’s right. I have no idea why either.
Hearing a Heavy Metal version of that famous song is simply hilarious.
The bad German accented English by a man in his late 50Â’s singing those
lyrics are just priceless. The funniest part of the song is how
seriously they play it. This isnÂ’t done as a joke. ItÂ’s also the best
song on the album, at least to me it is. The dual guitar solo in the
song seals the deal. This simply has to be heard, but alas, it does not
reach the epic status that is Lemmy Kilmister and Wendy O WIlliams
singing Tammy WynetteÂ’s Â“Stand By Your ManÂ”. If you play the first
song, Â“RestlessÂ” you will think you turned on an ACCEPT album. Only the
vocals differentiate it from them. ThatÂ’s a great band to sound like if
you have to sound like someone. At first I thought it was Â“Restless And
WildÂ” but it is not. This is a band that has been around a long time
and sounds like they are having fun. You could certainly do worse than
to buy this CD.

Another thing that is very obvious is just how stunningly good the
guitar solos are. Nothing jumps out at me besides sounding like ACCEPT
than the guitar solos do. Some are pretty epic and last for minutes.
The overall guitar sound packs a punch and the production is well done.
The whole album is a professionally done affair as one would expect
with a band thatÂ’s been around as long as VICTORY has. The band just
keeps on going. Nothing has been able to stop them. They did disband
for a while in 1994 before coming back two years later with two new
members. In 2003 they recorded an album with all but one original
member. As I said, the band refuses to go away, and after listening to
Â“DonÂ’t Talk ScienceÂ”, that is a good thing. Â“Love Kills LoveÂ” is a
great song and should get some airplay. VICTORY is no stranger to radio
play. In the States where I live, true Metal never gets airplay, and if
they do, itÂ’s a very old band and they only play one or two hit songs
that are decades old. Germany is a Heavy Metal haven and thank God for
that!

If you love the old school Metal from Germany and like some sweet
sounding guitars, you will like this new album. Again, I canÂ’t vouch
for the new singer being better or worse than their first vocalist, but
he does a fine job and the guitar solos are just begging you to come
listen to them. This is a very good record.
