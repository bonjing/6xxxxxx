Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Godspeed" is an intense, dramatic thriller set in the lingering light of the
Alaskan midnight sun. Charlie Shepard is a modern day faith healer, a man who
claims that if you let go and believe, then his power to heal is very real
indeed. Living a hand-to-mouth, blue collar existence with his wife Rebecca and
young son, Charlie ekes out a meager living from his "healing" sessions. With
his marriage failing, and an old drinking habit coming back to haunt him, his
family is brutally murdered by unknown assailants for seemingly no reason
whatsoever. Six months later, Charlie has abandoned his former life and the
house his family lived in, moving through the days' slow existence more like a
ghost than a man. But then a young, mysterious girl named Sarah appears in town,
and seeks out Charlie. She will become the link to his family's killings and to
the murderers themselves, ultimately leading to tragic, violent consequences for
all. "Godspeed" is a film that explores faith, grief, and the dark, violent
nature that may very well exist in all of us -- where man is still truly lost
and at the mercy of the Last Frontier of the great Alaskan landscape.
