Storyline:
Las Vegas showroom magician Cris Johnson has a secret which torments him: he can see a few minutes into the future.
Sick of the examinations he underwent as a child and the interest of the government and medical establishment in his power,
he lies low under an assumed name in Vegas, performing cheap tricks and living off small-time gambling "winnings."
But when a terrorist group threatens to detonate a nuclear device in Los Angeles, government agent Callie Ferris must use all
her wiles to capture Cris and convince him to help her stop the cataclysm.
