I usually get my mvgroup torrents from eztv but for some unknow reason, lately, the host name is unresolved and times out. ugh!"
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-25T23:00Z,"hi basilbrush.

ive uploaded Human Planet in higher quality, so your HDTV rips are now redundant :)"
,rickk1,2011-06-26T00:41Z,"could not play 1 and 3, 2 ok"
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T15:54Z,"eztv have had DNS problems (25/26 June 2011).
I cross posted this episode (part 3) to eztv but it didn't appear. They're always having trouble.

If you want to get the torrents faster it's easier to sign up at MVGroup. The torrents are free just like Piratebay. The MVGroup tracker is only open to MVGroup torrents though not like opentorrents and publicbt which are open to anyone."
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T15:57Z,Although the MVGroup tracker is only open to MVGroup torrents the tracker isn't required if you enable DHT in your BitTorrent client. The client will find other downloaders without the need of the tracker. The MVGroup torrents are public - the private flag is not set in the torrents.
,BasilBrush,2011-06-26T21:42Z,This episode is now cross posted to eztv which means you'll see a few more seeders.
