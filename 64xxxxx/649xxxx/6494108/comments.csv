,deth1981,2011-07-05T23:53Z,I got a notice from my ISP about this torrent. Copyright infringement. Better stay clear of these movies cause somehow they are tracing ip's.
,chrissyzieth,2011-07-12T03:36Z,"Excellent!!!  Thank you very much.  Sometimes I don't take the time to comment so I'd just like to say thanks, for all your great movies.  I'm still very new to downloading and I've had my share of fakes during the learning process however I've come to trust your work.  So, again, thanks... "
,lordo36,2011-07-22T17:29Z,"@deth1981, I take it your running Peer Blocker? if not why not. Downloading now will get back with V/A scores once watched. "
,lordo36,2011-07-23T15:48Z,"Watched this last night HDMI out to a LG 32"" LCD.

V10 A10, can't fault the rip."
,livluvlaf,2011-07-24T20:16Z,How do you run peer blocker? i keep getting copyright infringement e-mails too???
,livluvlaf,2011-07-24T20:21Z,how do you run or where do you get peer blocker?
,aDruid,2011-07-25T00:46Z,"Google = ""Peer Blocker""
If you need more help than this you just need to give up."

,BrentacoN,2011-08-07T14:34Z,"Anyone who maybe having trouble with peer block just make sure you tick the box ( run on start up) itll stay updated and never fail.

Tip: u can disable (block HTTP:) that wont effect your privacy with peer to peer (torrents and such) and your web searching wont be blocked.

Thanks TvTeam great work on all your stuff!"

,Transdulle,2011-08-27T22:12Z,"Super Movie, loved the end. Text book roman vs britons."
,QuantumDriven,2011-08-28T22:58Z,"Something is wrong.
This doesn't automatically dump to my BitTorrent downloader as usual.

I guess the stinking Jews have put a block on this uploader's torrents.

Fuck the stinking Jews! "
