Brian Bonz is only 24, but in those years, heâ€™s seen the entire country and many
parts of the world. Still, no matter where he travels, home is truly where the
heart is for this Brooklyn native, which is why he has created a musical
scrapbook of his life entitled The Triborough Odyssey. But make no mistake â€“
although each song on the album was inspired by specific events and places that
bind New Yorkers, all of the emotions on the record are universal. Like Bonzâ€™s
debut album, From Sumi to Japan, The Triborough Odyssey is a refreshing
compilation of experimental sounds with even more luscious arrangements.
However, it was the likes of the Notorious B.I.G. and Nas who had the biggest
influence on Bonzâ€™s goal for the new album. â€œItâ€™s sort of inspiring when you
hear rappers drop the names of neighborhoods or sing about different places and
you know what theyâ€™re talking about,â€ he says. â€œI wanted to apply that
upbringing, that surrounding, and write-what-you-know-about aspect to this
record.â€

Although the album pays homage to New York, Bonz and his band, The Major Crimes,
actually flew out to Chicago to record with John McEntire (Tortoise, The Sea and
Cake) at his legendary Soma Electronic Music Studios. Accustomed to recording in
his hometown and fine-tuning the sound in friendsâ€™ basements, working with
McEntire proved to be nothing short of enlightening. â€œIt was a great experience
to work with John and be put up to the challenge of recording with someone you
donâ€™t have any back story with, and who has a history of records you enjoy,â€
Bonz explains. â€œListening to and hearing stuff back in that control room and
being in the same studio that Wilco recorded some of their records, you sort of
sit there and say, â€˜Oh, this is why weâ€™re working with this guy â€“ because he
makes Stereolab sound like Stereolab.â€™â€

Lyrically, Bonz was inspired by the 2003 Blackout, 9/11, Manhattan real estate
and more, but each track also touches upon his ever-changing relationships. â€œThe
Honey Bee,â€ the albumâ€™s dreamy, doo-wop-inspired first single, is something that
Bonz doesnâ€™t usually dabble with â€“ a love song. â€œIâ€™m not really into writing
about girls or taking that personal aspect of my life and applying it to a song,
but itâ€™s about dating someone that didnâ€™t grow up in New York and moved here,â€
he reveals. â€œI feel like itâ€™s always interesting to get asked questions from
people that are just discovering the city and re-situating their lives.â€

Another unique offering on the record is the acoustic â€œMy Corduroy Eye,â€ which
is about Bonzâ€™s friend who dealt with sex addiction, and is sung entirely in
Spanish. â€œA Harlem Hand, A Harlem Heartâ€ is one of the most noticeable gems on
the album, rooted in smooth jazz and focused on â€œthe projects and the people who
live there, and how thatâ€™s slowly being stripped away because of real estate.â€

But the true benchmark of the new record is Bonzâ€™s most personal song,
â€œTriborough,â€ which features an extended instrumental introduction before
allowing the cerebral singerâ€™s vocals to come in. â€œItâ€™s about any relationship
you have, whether it be something involving love, friendship or a family member,
and what happens when you get so comfortable with the dynamic that you let your
guard down,â€ he muses.

Those wondering about the Dot Hongs can rest assured â€“ the name has been buried,
but nearly all of the players remain the same. â€œIt was just a joke that turned
into a laughing kind of thing when we would bring it up to people that didnâ€™t
even know what we sounded like, so we changed our name to Brian Bonz and The
Major Crimes, which is inspired by the HBO show The Wire,â€ he explains. â€œIâ€™m a
Wire freak, but Iâ€™m not going to get deep into the meaning behind â€˜Major
Crimes.â€™ People can Wikipedia that.â€

In the last two years, Bonz has grown tremendously, and like many of the best
writers do, heâ€™s channeling all of his (still-mounting) life experiences into
his music â€“ only this time around, heâ€™s doing it New York style. â€œYou write
about what you know and what you learned from some of the people that you may
have trusted when things are good or bad,â€ he says. â€œFrom that point on, I think
itâ€™s important to retrace whatever the issue is and make sure you take a step
back and get a good perspective about it all.â€ Case closed.
