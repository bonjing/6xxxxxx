Chemicals often have a negative Image among the general public. But there is no material world or indeed human beings without chemicals. The material world is operated by chemicals. The title â€˜Chemicals for Life and Livingâ€™ implies that the material world is staged and played by chemicals. The book consists of five parts and an appendix. Part 1 â€“ Essentials for life; Part 2 â€“ Enhancing health; Part 3 â€“ For the fun of life; Part 4 â€“ Chemistry of the universe and earth, and Part 5 - Some negative effects of chemicals. The appendix gives a brief summary of what chemistry is all about, including a short chapter of chemical principles. No quantitative calculations are included in this book so that it is appealing for everyone â€“ not just chemists.
