RockXP allows you to retrieve your XP product key that you used when you installed Windows XP, as well as keys for other Microsoft products. This can come very handy if you need to reinstall but have misplaced or lost the CD cover with the serial sticker. In addition, the program also lets you save the product activation to a file, recover usernames and passwords contained in the Windows Secure Storage, as well as MSN logins, Internet connection parameters and more. 

--- NOTE: Due to the nature of this software, some anti-virus program may warn you when you install this program. RockXP is not a virus, but other people could use it to get your Windows keys, thus the alert. ---
