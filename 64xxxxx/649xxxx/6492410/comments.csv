It's a shame there isn't a complete definitive collection of pony music yet, although this is as close as it gets for now!

Lack of a few original songs:
-Pinkie's singing telegram
-Gummy dance music
-Pinkie's parasprite polka
-Flutter- all these wonders

most of these songs have their remix counterparts but no original.  theres a complete lack of pinkies polka.

It would have been much more organized if you set ALL of the artists to MLP, and the name of the album set to whatever folder it was in.  "

-Pinkie pie's share and care song (original)"
