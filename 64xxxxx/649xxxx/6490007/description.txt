Plot Synopsis:
A blue-eyed ninja, Hijiri, is a fierce and cold-blooded assassin. She encounters a thief after the scroll of esoteric immortality from the treasure house of a Christian daimyo, Rokusha, and she gets into a sword fight with him. In the close battle, she is wounded, but is rescued by a Christian named Seitaro, and they begin falling for each other. But her happy days donâ€™t last. Openly critical of Christianity, â€œa bad foreign religionâ€, the Dainichi Shinkyo weaves dark intrigues to kill Hijiri and Christians.
