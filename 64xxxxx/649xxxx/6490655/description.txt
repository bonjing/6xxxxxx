An understanding of the reality in which we live can only be accomplished with a thorough understanding of God's Word. Every discipline of science is coming "full circle" back to what the Bible has said all along. This collection of studies includes:


Beyond Time and Space - The startling discovery of modern science is that our physical universe is actually finite.

Beyond Coincidence - The slightest change in any one of many variables prevents life.

Beyond Perception - The implication of quantum mechanics is frightening to secular scientists.

Beyond Newton - The interaction of the heavenly bodies cannot be explained by gravity.
