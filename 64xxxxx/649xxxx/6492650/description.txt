Story:
Set on the backdrop of a hill station of Coorg, the wealthy businessman Raj Uthappa (prakashraj) simply dotes on his daughter Kanasu (amoolya). So much that he gets possessive about her and extremely protective. The time comes when Kanasu grows up and goes to New Delhi for her studies. The story takes a turn when Amoolya reveals about her love affair with Joginder (achyuth), a sardar. Raj is totally shocked and he doesn't take it that easily though his wife (sithara) is positive about it. What happens from there forms the rest of the story
