This book arises out of papers delivered at the World Congress of the International Society of Business, Economics and Ethics (ISBEE) held in Cape Town in 2008. There are two sections. First, a number of key papers provide an insight into global business, wealth creation and welfare issues with particular reference to the African continent - appropriate for a Congress that was based in South Africa and drew wide participation from African scholars. Second, it provides the output from a global research project on "Fairness in International Trade" which ran over the two years prior to the Congress. This project drew together the work of scholars in five regions across the globe and is the first time that such a global perspective has been attempted.
