,kriaud,2011-06-27T13:19Z,"Is this really the real deal? Somehow, the fact that you got it off some blog, doesn't assure me of that"

,tc68,2011-06-27T17:36Z,"I'm sure those who think it's fake probably do not really download it.I've finished the download and browsed it.It's a real one,not fake. It can be played on multiple media players (VLC/Pot player/Media play classic/windows media player...). It's related to previous episode.   

Before saying it's fake, you should really try it. Otherwise, you have no right to say it's fake. "
,sergioo66,2011-06-27T17:39Z,"@shasha2333
I based my decision on the fact that the person that uploaded this has never uploaded anything until today AND that they say they got it from some random ass blog.

So forgive my hesitation to download from some random member who isn't trusted... but what would you know, you probably don't think before you download or really before you do anything."
,nesperi,2011-06-27T17:45Z,Real

It's not overly bad quality, but you can tell it's definitely not HD. Thank you so much for this! Though waiting for the third episode is going to kill me in the long run. "
,Svenjaa,2011-06-27T22:04Z,This episode is so much better than the first of Season 4!
,DestielForever,2011-06-28T01:01Z,"The reason being why I didn't upload anything yet, is because I deleted my old Account ""TrueBlood-Aholic"" and haven't gotten the chance to upload all my older torrents. thank you very much ""sergioo66""

:)
AND! the link to the blog is VERY reliable fuckyeahtruebloodhbo.tumblr.com I follow them on tumblr."
,.Leto.,2011-06-28T01:37Z,"not a fake but I tried with every player I had and it's unwatchable, picture really is too jerky. wait for a better release, the real one."
,alfzone,2011-06-28T06:03Z,"so, why upload it .mov instead of .avi? just saying, not complaining "
,DestielForever,2011-06-29T09:29Z,@alfzone I did upload it as an avi too.
