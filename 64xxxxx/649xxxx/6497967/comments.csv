,wilco1000,2011-07-16T03:25Z,"OK have used it for a while now & it works great the best email client since OE. The keygen works well but shows up as a false positive but is not infected. You have to set the HTML yourself which is not hard just open an email & on the right hand side is an icon which you click & then click box ""Show Rules"" then from the drom down select"" Allow All"". Still can not see where I can make it permanent for all."
