"Under Dead Television Skies," the groundbreaking miniseries published in 1997, was Jason Alexander's first work for Sirius Entertainment, and relates the final adventure of its heroine, Corinne. Each issue features a cover by Dark One, the creator of ANIMAL MYSTIC.

Past and future collide for Corinne in "Under Dead Television Skies!" Bounty hunters and automated death squads track the beautiful mercenary through the dark, cyberpunk world of the future. Their onslaught triggers violent memory backlashes for Corinne, and she relives the unspeakable evils she committed years before. Who is the mysterious man hunting her, and what role does he play in her creation?
