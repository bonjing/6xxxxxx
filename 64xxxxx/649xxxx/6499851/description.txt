IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Bridesmaids

Ok here we go with a pretty decent TS release of this much wanted flick .....
Firstly the video.....the base of it was good but needed tweaking and sharpening.However there
was several mins at the start where there was borders and top and bottom and also above the borders there
was a faint line...but otherwise decent a cam.
What we did was made a script with all the settings we needed and loaded it into vdub and cut the video at 21075 and
cropped the borders and line and resize to match the rest of the video....yes AR is off for this part,but only way to 
append it unless you wanted the borders.
Then we had to reload the script cut the part we already did and remove the crop command.
Now audio...pretty decent line but syncing was a pita as we found there was missing video when syncing,which makes it harder lol.
Anyway.....10 seconds missing at 12:18  8 seconds missing at the join where we cut the bars frame 21075 ..... and another 11 seconds at 1:33:39.
At one point you'll heard the audio and theres no one moving their mouths...thats where the video should have been and then it kicks back in ....only last
a few secs that part.

Anyway enjoy folks :)
