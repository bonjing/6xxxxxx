This is a re-structure of the Salute your shorts torrent(s) that are available but have sound issues or NO AUDIO. There are still pauses, and skips randomly, but THEY DO NOT make the episodes un-watchable. So far every episode I have watched, played through , even the ones previously I could not get to play with sound NOW play with audio.

* episode missing of pinsky-sponge gazzette, original person who created DVD mis-assigned episode of Michael comes to camp

* capture the flag episode has slight lags in certain parts, but still watachable, re-sync'd on the fly. Where as before watching this episode in previous form audio would be out of sync from the video.



Tested on Xbox 360,Straight burn from ISO.
