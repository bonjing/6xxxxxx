I mis-spoke upon watching the 2nd season thru, there is about 3 episodes that either, play for a bit then audio becomes out of sync with video, or the episode is completely lagged, or it bounces in and out of sync. The show takes place in such a way that it is still watchable anyhow

Capture the flag: out of sync a few minutes in

Dina and the rock start- mostly out of sync."
