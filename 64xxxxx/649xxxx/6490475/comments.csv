,Devellish,2011-06-24T13:25Z,Had to turn my pc off. If someone can tell me how to put this on a Synology correctly I can seed 24/7. I've looked into it and I can't find a way to do it.

Also, there is a mouse pointer in the middle of the screen for an extended amount of time. Both of those make this video nigh on impossible to watch. I highly recommend not wasting your time, and getting the other version available on TPB."
