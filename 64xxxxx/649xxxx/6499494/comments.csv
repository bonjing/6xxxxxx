If you're at all interested in cooking, watch Masterchef Australia, instead."

,kockunge,2011-07-06T13:49Z,"...its not like you pay for it. shows about a little bit of cooking (about as much as you see in top chef, wich isnt alot. Masterclass-shows in M.chef Aussi is the thing! ) and alot of screwing up infront of a camera..!! if you like people making fools out of them self, watch this or Idol or think u can dance....funny for some."
