So you believe in and have faith in Jesus(PBUH) just like Muslim do(Jesus was the messenger of ALLAH). Then will you tell me whether Jesus had Beard or not?? I think he does had then How come shaving is reasonable and Beard is unreasonable??

And marrying four women is allowed in Islam only and if only one can treat them equally. If one cant, He cant has more than one wife at a time.

And will you kindly explain your logic behind 'what ever you think as reasonable'??"
