I'm only missing one studio recording... Brown Sugar with Eric Clapton on slide guitar. 

From Wikipedia: An alternate version was recorded on 18 December 1970, at Olympic Studios in London, after (or during) a birthday party for Richards. It features appearances by Al Kooper on piano, and Eric Clapton on slide guitar. The alternate version is widely available on bootleg recordings. Richards considered releasing this version on Sticky Fingers, mostly for its more spontaneous atmosphere, but decided on the original
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Sugar_%28song%29

It was released as a 7"" vinyl single with Cocksucker Blues on the A side and Brown Sugar on the B side in the early 1970s. I have it on the MER record label. 

Once again... many thanks! 

Cheers,
Mr. Stoned

Neither torrent had Hot Rocks, which is the awesome-est hits album. But, I must thank you for putting all these albums together. It's a great collection for Stones fans like myself. Thanks. "
,_kewlCat,2011-11-29T16:42Z,"THANK YOU!!! Beautiful. Random checks with a spectrum analyzer indicate these are true flac files = highest quality. To get top aural quality from flac, use Foobar not mainstream sheit players. I love winamp for mp3, but it's been bad with flac recently; quality suffers.
