AC/DC is a hard rock band, formed in Sydney, Australia in 1973 by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young. The group is considered to be a pioneer of hard rock and heavy metal music along with Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, but the members refer to their music as "rock 'n roll." More than three decades into a career that shows no signs of slowing down or letting up, AC/DC, like electricity itself, provides the world with an essential source of power and energy. Since forming in 1973, AC/DC's high voltage rock 'n' roll has flowed out into the world via consistently sold-out concert tours and global sales totaling more than 150 million albums and counting.

This is the ultimate critical review of a legendary band, from the early days when AC/DC rose from playing obscure clubs to conquering the world. For many fans, Bon Scott was a legendary frontman without equal, and his powerful voice was the key to a host of classic hits from Whole Lotta Rosie to Let There Be Rock. After his trgic death, the virtually unknown Brian Johnson stepped into the breach, and AC/DC came storming back with the classic album Back In Black.


Part 2 : The Brian Johnson Era 

The year was 1980, and AC/DC had just lost the legendary frontman Bon Scott. He had been the epitome of the hard rockin' sound the band made their own, and this would have been the end of the line for most. However, Brian Johnson was recruited and the band produced their most popular album Back In Black, selling over 40 million copies worldwide.
