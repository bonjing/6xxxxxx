Publisher: Palgrave Macmillan | 2008 | ISBN: 1403912440 | PDF | 272 pages | 1.1 MB

In this investigation of Presbyterians and identity in modern Ireland, Baillie explores a wide range of contemporary topics based on over 115 interviews with Ministers and individuals from 25 congregations. Among other issues, she explores politics and culture; social and moral issues; roles of women; the influence of life history and geographical location; education; inter church relations; the Orange Order; Freemasonry; the ministry and the future. Do the institutions of the Presbyterian church help or hinder individuals in their lives? Baillie helps to demonstrate that identity is a key concept within the context of postmodernity.
