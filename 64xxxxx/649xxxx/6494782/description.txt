MOTORING: F1: Grand Prix Qualifying

European Grand Prix Qualifying.

Jake Humphrey introduces live coverage of qualifying for the European Grand Prix in Spain. With overtaking traditionally difficult at the Valencia Street Circuit, qualifying may be even more important than usual. Last year it was Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel who claimed pole, and the German went on to win the race ahead of Britons Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Vettel, the reigning world champion, has made an impressive start to the 2011 season, establishing a commanding lead in the drivers' championship. The 23-year-old's consistency in qualifying has been a key factor in his success, so the likes of Hamilton and Button will be desperate to beat him to pole in Valencia. With commentary from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
