,soupcip,2011-06-23T23:00Z,"Ronaldo99 I am just downloading so i wouldnt know, have to complete it first but I do admit I was a little confused at the filesize , and if it is like you said that would be real strange indeed :) ah well....it dont cost me more if I download another 350 mb eventho its useless data.
So thanks anyway TvTeam ;)"
