Supertramp are a British rock band formed in 1969. Though their music was initially
categorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional
rock and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the use of spiritual and
philosophical lyrics and the distinctive voice of co founder Roger Hodgson, who appeared on
the majority of the band's biggest hit singles. Supertramp were also well known for their
prominent use of the Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone. The band's early work included
ambitious concept albums; they would enjoy greater critical, and commercial success when
they ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works in the late 1970s, going on to
sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success under
Hodgson's leadership: 1979's Breakfast in America, their most popular album, has sold more
than 20 million copies.

Supertramp enjoyed multiple international hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including:
"Dreamer", "Give a Little Bit", "The Logical Song", "Breakfast in America", "Goodbye
Stranger", "Take the Long Way Home", "It's Raining Again" and "Cannonball". The band
attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, most of Europe, South Africa,
Australia and Brazil, and moderate commercial success in their native UK. Since Hodgson's
departure in 1983, co-founder Rick Davies has led the band
