Release Notes:
--------
In some ways, music doesnâ€™t get much more modest or minimalist than it is in the
hands of The Civil Wars, a duo comprised of California-to-Nashville transplant
Joy Williams and her Alabaman partner, John Paul White. They travel without a
backup band, and on their first full-length album, Barton Hollow, the bare-bones
live arrangements that fans hear on the road are fleshed out with just the
barest of acoustic accoutrements. Each song is an intimate conversation, and no
third wheels or dinner-party chatter are going to interrupt that gorgeous,
haunting hush.

On the other hand, thereâ€™s been something distinctly loud about the duoâ€™s
introduction to the world, even prior to the albumâ€™s release. Their signature
song â€œPoison & Wineâ€ was heard on Greyâ€™s Anatomyâ€”in the foreground, in its
entirety, over a key climactic montage, prompting hundreds of thousands of
viewers to Google the mystery music. And they got a wholly unsolicited
endorsement when Americaâ€™s biggest pop star gave The Civil Wars a seal of
approval. After first tweeting her love for the duo, fellow Nashvillian Taylor
Swift included â€œPoison & Wineâ€ as a selection in her official iTunes playlist,
saying, â€œI think this is my favorite duet. Itâ€™s exquisite.â€

Swift took the words right out of the folk-country-Americana worldâ€™s mouth. If
it looks like The Civil Warsâ€™ appeal might cast a net that extends well beyond
the typical audience for acoustically based music, that may be due to the
inherent sensibilities Williams and White bring to their collaboration, which
are quite disparate, if not necessarily warring. Both were gigging and recording
on their own prior to teaming up a year and a half ago, neither solo career
quite suggesting what their conjoined sound would turn out to be. â€œI do
naturally bend pop,â€ says Williams, who adds that she â€œgrew up on Billie
Holliday and The Beach Boys.â€ White, meanwhile, was raised on Kristofferson,
Cash, and Townes Van Zandt by his retro-country-favoring dad. â€œSomehow weâ€™re
pulling from each other what we crave and what our strengths are,â€ he says.

If the music ultimately leans more toward Whiteâ€™s native South than Williamsâ€™
northern Cali roots, he says, â€œI think Joyâ€™s got some hillbillies in her
ancestry or something like that. Thereâ€™s a song on our record called â€˜My
Fatherâ€™s Fatherâ€™ that we wrote on the day of the inauguration down in Muscle
Shoals, not long after we got together. I started playing the guitar figure and
she starting singing this amazing Appalachian kind of melody, and Iâ€™m like,
â€˜Donâ€™t even pretend that youâ€™re the pop girl and you come out with shit like
that!â€™ I donâ€™t know where this stuff is coming from, but sheâ€™s drawing it from
somewhere, and itâ€™s amazing.â€

â€œPoison & Wineâ€ isnâ€™t just The Civil Warsâ€™ breakout song. Itâ€™s also a thematic
declaration of intent for this utterly complementary odd couple, encapsulating
everything suggested in the duoâ€™s name when it comes to exploring the conflicts
that arise as part of couplehood. Speaking of which: They arenâ€™t, thatâ€”a couple,
that is. But theyâ€™re far from insulted if you mistake them for An Item in the
storied tradition of the Swell Season, Richard and Linda Thompson, or other
famous duos whose on-again, off-again relationships offstage complicated their
stage relations.

â€œA lot of people think that weâ€™re married, and I think thatâ€™s actually quite
flattering, to be honest,â€ says White. â€œBecause we donâ€™t want people to think
that weâ€™re up here acting and feigning the emotions that we write and sing about
and show on stage. But one of the things that really make this special in our
eyes is that if she and I were in a relationship together, it'd be a totally
different act. We would write totally different songs. I donâ€™t think we would be
able to go on stage every night and sing â€˜I donâ€™t love you.â€™ I donâ€™t think a
healthy relationship could withstand that every single night. Thereâ€™s areas we
can delve into that wouldnâ€™t make sense for somebody thatâ€™s
till-death-do-us-part. I think thereâ€™s also a tension there that wouldnâ€™t be
there if it was something that was just rote, something that was an everyday
relationship. We try to use that to our advantage.â€

â€œPoison & Wineâ€ fits the paradigm of subject matter too true to be spoken, as
opposed to sung. â€œThat song probably does sum us upâ€”The Civil Wars, the name of
the bandâ€”as well as any song that weâ€™ve written,â€ White says. Itâ€™s the one song
on the album written with an outside collaborator, their friend Chris Lindsey.
â€œWeâ€™re all married, and we were all talking about the good, the bad and the
ugly, and just felt like: What would you say to someone if you were actually
brutally honestâ€”the things that you could never say because it would turn them
away or let the cat out of the bag or reveal yourself to be weaker? What would
you actually say if you had this invisible curtain around you and could just
scream it in somebodyâ€™s face and theyâ€™d actually never hear it? We were all
being very painfully honest, because weâ€™re all very comfortable around each
other and know that things like that never leave the room, except in a song. Iâ€™m
pretty proud of that song, to be honest.â€

When â€œPoison & Wineâ€ was heard in its entirety on Greyâ€™s Anatomyâ€”versus in the
background, for a few seconds, as Williams and White had expectedâ€”they knew that
if the showâ€™s audience liked what they heard, it would put their search skills
to the test. The title only pops up in a verse, not the chorus, so it involved
some ingenuity or intuition to track the tune down. Fortunately, viewers proved
up to the test of finding, and choosing, their â€œPoison.â€ At last count, the
songâ€™s official YouTube video had been viewed 400,000 times.

White and Williams met in 2008 on what he describes as a â€œblind date, getting
stuck in a room together, not knowing anything about each other.â€ This was a
strictly professional blind date. As Williams recalls, â€œI got a call for whatâ€™s
called a writing camp, where several writers were called together to work on
trying to write several radio singles for a particular country band. Though I
live in Nashville, I worked mostly in L.A. and came more out of the pop world,
so I was like, why did they call me? John Paul definitely wasnâ€™t bringing a
Music Row sensibility in when he was coming into the write, either, but neither
of us knew that about each other. In that room, it was almost 20 writers,
basically drawing straws and getting to know each other a little bit. And when
he started singing, I somehow knew where he was heading musically and could
follow him, without ever having met him before. And that had never happened to
me.â€

â€œIâ€™ve done lots of co-writes and collaborative situations, but Iâ€™d never felt
that weird spark,â€ agrees Whiteâ€”â€œthat weird familiarity like weâ€™d been in a
family band or something most of our lives. The beautiful part of it was that
neither one of us would let on, so we both played it cool for a while, saying
â€˜That went well, we should write another,â€ and so on. I worked up enough nerve
toâ€”so to speakâ€”ask her out. But there was a lot of scuffing my heel on the floor
and â€˜I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing for a while, but Iâ€™ve got this guitar, and
you sing pretty good, but you probably donâ€™t want to. Youâ€™re so much better than
I am. Never mind. Iâ€™m just gonna go.â€™ Luckily she felt the same way.â€

Months later, they did their first show as The Civil Wars at the French Quarter
CafÃ© in Nashvilleâ€”where their future producer, Charlie Peacock, was in
attendance and definitely taking notice. Their second show was at a club called
Eddieâ€™s Attic in Decatur, Georgia, and it was attended by roughly 100,000 fans.
At least, thatâ€™s how many people have downloaded Live at Eddieâ€™s Attic, a free
digital album, from their website.

The set included eight originals plus a cover of Leonard Cohenâ€™s â€œDance Me to
the End of Love.â€ â€œWe didnâ€™t even rehearse that much for that show, and we were
flying by the seat of our pants,â€ recalls White. â€œBut the sound guy at Eddieâ€™s
is legendary for doing really great board takes, and we listened to the tape on
the way home and were pretty amazed at the quality of the recording. So we
thought, â€˜What the hell, letâ€™s see what other people think about it.â€™ The beauty
of putting that thing out as early as we did is, we could always fall back on:
â€˜Well, it was our second showâ€™,â€ he laughs.

â€œLooking back, John Paul and I canâ€™t believe we put out our second show ever,â€
Williams says. â€œHopefully you can hear the growth from then to now. But Iâ€™m
really glad that we did. To get emails now like â€˜A buddy of mine in South Africa
just sent me Live at Eddieâ€™s Attic,â€™ or somebody coming up to us and saying
â€˜Yeah, my friend in New Zealand was the one that told me about you guysâ€™â€”in
Alabama, where we were doing a relatively local showâ€”that really took us by
surprise, the way it started a conversation nationally and internationally.â€

The Live at Eddieâ€™s Attic release also had some other happy, unintended
consequences. Williams feels that the loose chatter between songs helped
establish that, as personalities, the two of them arenâ€™t always (or even
usually) as somber as their breakout song might suggest. More importantly, it
established them as a fully functional duo that might be harmed more than helped
by the addition of a slew of hired hands.

When it comes to keeping â€œthe bandâ€ to an un-band-like two people, â€œthereâ€™s
probably 10 different reasons for that,â€ explains White. â€œSome of it is
logistics. Itâ€™s so much easier for two people to get into a car. But it just
felt like releasing that record with just the two of us also put that stripped
down, more organic, more raw kind of sound in peopleâ€™s minds. And we felt like
it was more emotional and told the story a lot better. Itâ€™s just she and I and a
guitar and piano. If thereâ€™s something that is lacking, itâ€™s gonna be painfully
obvious. So the songâ€™s guts have to be strong, at least for us, from front to
back.â€

No frills means no distractions from the quality of their blended voices. â€œItâ€™s
the strangest thing when I sing with her,â€ White says. â€œEven the things we do
with vibrato, typically, theyâ€™re the sameâ€”we speed up and slow down at the same
pace. Sheâ€™ll ad-lib something live, and the next time around, Iâ€™ll sing the
harmony to it. But if I sat and thought about it, I couldnâ€™t do it.â€ For
Williams, whoâ€™s sold hundreds of thousands of records recording on her own,
sharing the vocals is â€œone of my favorite things about The Civil Wars, because
when youâ€™re a solo artist, you canâ€™t harmonize while singing the lead. To me,
all harmony is active listening.â€

Thereâ€™s something circuitously satisfying about the fact that â€œactive listeningâ€
is taking place on-stage at The Civil Wars shows as well as among the audience,
heightening the sensation that itâ€™s a conversation being eavesdropped on, not
just a performance. So much synchronization to go aroundâ€¦ but also so much
delicious tension, as the duo hardly shy away from the conflict that gives them
their moniker. Harmonious discord, thy name is The Civil Wars.

White and Williams are never going to forge a complete meeting of the minds.
â€œYouâ€™ll be a redneck once Iâ€™m through with you,â€ he tells her, teasingly. â€œOh,
just try!â€ she taunts him. Still a northern California girl after this many
years in Nashville, she says, â€œI still canâ€™t say â€˜yâ€™all.â€™ I still canâ€™t say
â€˜fixinâ€™ to.â€™ John Paul, you say â€˜might couldâ€™ a lot, which freaks me out. But
yeah, somewhere in there, if itâ€™s only in the melodies, Iâ€™m happy to absorb all
that.â€

And to dish it back out in the form of universal narratives that are both
elliptical and emotional. â€œAfter all the writing Iâ€™ve done for other artists or
writing for TV/film or solo music,â€ says Williams, â€œthe ability for John Paul
and I to share stories of whatâ€™s happened in our lives, either current or past,
and let those inform the way that we write intrinsically makes us care more
about it. Weâ€™ve got songs that deal directly with loss that weâ€™ve had in our own
pasts. The opening song, â€˜Twenty Years,â€™ is actually about a family secret, more
on my side of the family. We love to write about these things and hint at it
while not giving the whole thing away. If the stories that weâ€™re singing about
and the things that weâ€™re speaking of are true, hopefully theyâ€™ll draw out the
stories of the people who are listening, and that can create some invisible
cycle of safety and exhilaration and freedom, and of being transported somewhere
else for a little moment in time.â€

Somewhere likeâ€¦ Barton Hollow? Where is the titular location, anyway? â€œI guess
itâ€™s something to do with the picturesque quality of the phrase,â€ admits White.
â€œItâ€™s a phrase that youâ€™re not gonna Google and find, whatsoever. I found that
out the other day. There is no Barton Hollow, that I can find.â€ But a few
minutes later, heâ€™s changed his tune, declaring: â€œBarton Hollow is actually a
place that I grew up. Itâ€™s a little geographic place close to where I grew up
and did a lot of illicit activities,â€ White continues, embellishing as he goes,
while his partner dissolves into helpless laughter. â€œI have a soft spot for that
place.â€ Maybe the transporting Williams talks about has worked its magic on her
partner, too.
