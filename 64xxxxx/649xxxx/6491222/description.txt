Marikeâ€™s third album is something different, something special. Soundwise she chooses a new path. â€˜Here comes the nightâ€™ was mixed by multiple Grammy Award winner Tchad Blake, an idiosyncratic producer who has worked with such artists as The Black Keys, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello and Suzanne Vega.

Marike feels proud, if a bit surprised at their collaboration: â€œI sent him a few songs and he was very keen. Since everyone in the band is a fan of his, we feel honoured that he wanted to work with us. Tchad loves dynamics, just like I do, and has a great feel for atmosphere.â€

Marikeâ€™s newest album is very distinctive, with cinematic underpinnings. The band is bursting with energy and Marikeâ€™s guitar playing is compelling. â€œEverythingâ€™s falling into place. This is the album Iâ€™ve been looking forward to for years.â€

The recordings were done in the Jet Studio, the oldest studio in Belgium and a musical monument where both Edith Piaf and The Rolling Stones have set foot.
