Christ, you're cracking me up! LOL

,DaniGamer,2011-07-26T09:11Z,"Thankx for upload YIFY , was searching for this"
,CosmAvngr,2011-07-30T19:01Z,"@ xDEADx

I think the reason for the minus on the quality indicator should be obvious. 

The quality is garbage.

Seriously who gives this stuff +? What are you watching on, a phone?

High resolution and low bit rates = terrible encode.

This is worse than a decent DVD rip."
,Amazo_Etrigan,2011-10-14T21:45Z,"i don't understand the hatred, i've seen the screenshot YIFY provided and i think he's done a wonderful job ! thanks for the up !"

,AJNorth,2011-11-07T04:35Z,An absolutely pristine transfer of this truly extraordinary film. A=10; V=10; M=9. Those crabbing about the quality need glasses and hearing aids (and perhaps to go back on their medications...). Thank you for the post.
