dear god why zips"
,davedtm,2011-06-24T13:18Z,Am I the only one to get stuck in the house of the future? I can't select anything in there. Bug in the game?
,liudwik55,2011-06-24T16:02Z,Yes! Exact problem in future house with me. Maybe need another crack?
,gfudmek,2011-06-24T22:22Z,"Why the fuck would you put each piece of the rar in a seperate zip?
Last time I download anything from this asshole..."
,snipey101,2011-06-24T22:50Z,"confusing as hell, never downloading from you again"
,TheDarkNomad,2011-06-25T03:35Z,"SUMMARY: yes, it sux that he zipped the rars (maybe he thought it will double compress it ??), BUT the setup is good, the crack works and the game CAN be finished. Takes about 2h.

To the noobs that claim the crack is bad or whatever idiotic things they THINK are wrong: first get dirt on Edna (since you didn't figure it out, put the recording plant in the booth, call the phone booth from the furniture house, talk to Edna about her secret), THEN go after Emmet...
This episode is easy compared to the others. The only time I used hints was when I had to rescue Young Emmet and after disarming Tannen\Edna.

The rest shouldn't be hard to discover even if by random clicking... the ending will be ""interesting"""
,a1s,2011-06-25T09:45Z,"For the love of...! first rar-s and now zip-s?! I know it's a free torrent and everything, but I'm seriously not downloading this one."
,Insomneac,2011-06-26T04:14Z,"To all you noobs whining about zip files, it wasn't the uploader who did this, it's scene rules.

That's how it's done, so don't whine, you're getting it for free."
,McFlyGuy,2011-06-27T03:00Z,"@the dark nomad: funny that you call guys idiotic -.- 
in the bugged version you have to go after emmet first and then put dirt on edna, exactly the opposite from your hint (read that putting the plant in the phone booth before going after emmet causes the bug). otherwise you canĂÂ´t click on the walls in the glass house and you get stucked in it.
btw using the hints in the game is lame...especially in such an easy game like bttf"
,stonelesscutter,2011-06-28T00:41Z,"When I try to unpack the second time (the install file) I get an error saying ""You need to have the following volume to continue extraction: ""C:\Downloads\Back.to.the.Future.Episode.5.OUTATIME.v2011.5.21.58360-TE\tbtf1501\tbtf15.r00"""".
This is a problem coz that doesn't exist."
,stonelesscutter,2011-06-28T00:55Z,Can anybody help me out? Coz this sucks.
,stonelesscutter,2011-06-28T01:14Z,"Don't you just hate it when people place spoilers in the comments? This game is already so friggin' easy, nobody needs those hints. Thanks for already ruining the start of the game before I even got it to run."
,stonelesscutter,2011-06-28T15:52Z,"This torrent didn't work for me, but I downloaded this one...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6490749/Back.to.the.Future.Episode.5.OUTATIME.v2011.5.21.58360-TE
...and that did the job. Very fast download too. I did need this fix by RZR...
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6492565/Back.to.The.Future.Episode.5.Outatime.Fixed.Files.by-RZRX911
...to get the bug out of it but now I'm enjoying the game. Finally."
,a1s,2011-07-07T14:35Z,"@ Insomneac:
How is it that 95% of uploaders manage not to be dicks, but this one suddenly needs to follow ""scene rules""? It doesn't take any effort NOT to put your upload in rars and your rars in zips and your zips in an egg, etc. it was done deliberately."
,nikosplumis,2011-07-09T17:20Z,Thanks Fot The Game.
,AnamikaMogha,2011-09-28T15:06Z,"Had to do a lot of hard work.. LOL.. Thanks for the game, anyway..!"
,fred99u,2012-01-30T23:37Z,"yes, episode 5 is terribly buggy, all of the others work fine"
