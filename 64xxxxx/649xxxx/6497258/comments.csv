,smurfmurfet,2011-06-27T06:12Z,"From the Sample - 
A-7 A bit hard to hear, but ok when turned up.
V-9 would nearly pass a a screener. Will update when finished downloading."
,jec623,2011-06-27T07:24Z,"v-9 great video
a-2 though I can hear it it is way out of sync
the audio is the only thing that makes it hard to watch cause you see mouths moving when they aren't suppose to be. good start though. "
,jec623,2011-06-27T07:26Z,"V - 9 great video
A - 2 I have no problem hearing it but its just way out of sync when you see the pixar begining animation they normally have movie starts talking during that. "

,smurfmurfet,2011-06-28T08:30Z,Full thing - Video still close to a DVDrip of it but audio is slightly off unfortunatly. Hopefully someone will take this video and mix it with a better audio source.
