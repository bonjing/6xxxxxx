,wankan,2011-06-27T12:05Z,"Hi Klimodni ,

At 1:10 the audio stops and then the video freezes at 01:27 . Then there are short burps of audio and a slow frame change .

Well that's what I'm getting .
Did you see my little note regarding ""A Million"" .


I wonder why no-one else is commenting . "
,klimodni,2011-06-27T13:09Z,"thanks wankan. glad there is someone still care and I guess +1 is from you. 
Try to reduce error in next torrent."
,wankan,2011-06-27T16:49Z,"Have you thought about using something less ""exotic"" than mkv (x264 and aac) .

AutoGordianKnot.2.55 is really simple to use (even I managed it) . The file size will be a little larger but will probably be more successful (assuming of course it isn't my netbook throwing a wobbly with your files) .

,wankan,2011-06-27T19:25Z,"Just realised what you meant by the ""I guess +1 is from you"" comment .
Nope , it wasn't from me (have to admit I hadn't even noticed the option before) .

Someone must think it works okay then .

Maybe the problem is at my end , though I haven't had this problem before ."
,klimodni,2011-06-28T01:27Z,thanks wankan. Auto Guardian knot. will give it a try.
,sinner77,2011-06-28T13:03Z,Sorry guys....it was me who gave the +1 ...it was fr the size.....i hvnt d/l it so there might b a prob in it
,wankan,2011-06-28T18:06Z,"Lol :-) , now that is funny :-)"
,tre.fire,2011-09-13T17:33Z,"So what is the upshot, is this file good or are there issues with playback?"
,wankan,2011-09-14T17:55Z,"Hi tre.fire ,

I seem to have been the only person to comment on quality as I just searched the hash on Google and went through 4 pages of hits for this film and ,..... not a single comment from anyone . 
Which is really bloody ungreatfull as klimodni obviously put effort into his/her torrents .

Can't find any comments about his/her other uploads either .

They would have been great quality and , above all , interesting films if I could have actually used the files .

As I said , it could be my netbook but I haven't had the problem before or since .  "
