CAST: Matt Damon as George Lonegan, an American factory worker and "a reluctant psychic [...] who can speak to the dead but prefers not to".[3][4] Damon previously starred in Eastwood's Invictus, and was cast in Hereafter because Eastwood was so impressed by him. CÃ©cile de France as Marie Lelay, a French television journalist who survives a tsunami.[3][7] Frankie and George McLaren as Marcus and Jason, twin brothers. Jason is killed in a car accident early in the film, and Marcus later attempts to contact him in the afterlife.[8] Eastwood selected the two actors to play the brothers despite them having never acted before because he did not want "child actors who'd been over-instructed in Child Acting 101."[6]Lyndsey Marshal as Jackie, Marcus and Jason's mother, a heroin addict.[7]
Thierry Neuvic as Didier, Marie's lover. Neuvic was on holiday in Corsica in September 2009 when he was called to audition for a role in the film. His audition, which took place at a Paris hotel, lasted 15 minutes, and he read two scenes for Eastwood. Most of Neuvic's scenes were filmed in Paris.[9] Jay Mohr as Billy Lonegan, George's older brother.[10
