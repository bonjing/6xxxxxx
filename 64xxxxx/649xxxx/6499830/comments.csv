Sure the technology is dated, and the representation the workings of computers is silly.But I think of that as an attempt to make an entertaining visual representation of a visually dull subject. I think the acting over all is pretty good, and young Anagelina Jolie forshadows the quality she will achieve in later films Plus she is quite hot, even at this young age."

Also Hackers[1995]DvDrip[Eng]-NikonXP  @704MB which shows 47 seeds via DHT, likely more via mDHT.

Both well verifed via plenty of positive comments on the other two torrent index sites.

No disrespect to doude422, but as showing as no seeder, if anybody gets tired of waiting for an uploader seed, the other versions are out there and established.

Had i not looked at doude422's upload list and seen how sporadic uploads are, coupled with no seeder showing on page 18 hours later on this, i wouldn't have mentioned it, but looks like 15 people are waiting for him to come online and actually seed, so thought i'd mention the other two established versions.

If ye upload, keep online until the upload is established, a couple of people complete so can take over from ye. Rude to keep people waiting, many torrents get abandioned, so how is anybody to know, again, no dis intended doude422 matey.

Peace. : )"
