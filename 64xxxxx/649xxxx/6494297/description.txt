Known for an invigorating live show filled with trippy visuals, the Octopus
Project is no slouch in the studio either. The Austin, Texas-based quartet might
not be the most prolific recording act, but they have churned out EPs, remixes,
and full-lengths steadily since debuting in 2002 with Identification Parade.
Their fourth proper album, Hexadecagon, sits as the follow-up to 2009's Golden
Beds EP and finds the band expanding its sounds and scope. The record has been
described as an attempt to create a more enveloping listening experience. In
other words, that means plenty of instrumental layers filled with keyboards,
samplers, theremin, and everything else under the sun. Hexadecagon was recorded
with the assistance of producer John Congleton, who has worked with St. Vincent,
Explosions in the Sky, and the Walkmen.
