Clarence Larkin - Charts

The charts by Clarence Larkin have been extremely helpful to Christians since they were first published over 75 years ago. They have passed into the public domain as an aid to Bible study. Larkin's charts are well thought out and Scriptually sound. Some of the more detailed are books in themselves. They reveal Larkin's vast knowledge of the Scriptures and phenomenal grasp of prophecy.

Practically all of the "prophecy teachers" today got their basic knowledge of prophecy directly or indirectly from Clarence Larkin and C. I. Scolfield. Larkin's works, as well as Scolfield's, are definitive; works that will endure until Christ's return. No other books since these of Larkin, published over 75 years ago, have much improved on them.
