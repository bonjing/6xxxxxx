,zaroba,2011-06-24T12:29Z,"thanks for the quick upload.

but, as per what comody central (which currently owns the rights to air the new episodes first), season 7 has started and this is the 2nd episode."
,zaroba,2011-06-24T23:42Z,"sorry, please ignore my previous comment about the season.
i had misunderstood what i had seen on comedy central and thought that *this* was the new season instead of just being the second part of season 6"
