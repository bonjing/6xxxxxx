Release Notes:

Poor but Sexyâ€™s debut album,â€œLetâ€™s Move in Together ,â€ has a little bit for
everyone. At times itâ€™s even a bit too much. Some light-funk, brainy R&B, smooth
Yacht rock and warped art-rock all seep into the mix. Even with all those
sounds, the album is rarely unfocused. Itâ€™s just that sometimes it doesnâ€™t sound
all that appealing.

The bandâ€™s guitarist, Jason Caddell, is best known for playing with the
Dismemberment Plan, Washingtonâ€™s beloved indie rockers who embraced spastic funk
sounds and who staged a successful reunion tour earlier this year. But the Plan
serves as more of a reference point for PBS rather than a blueprint. Even with
all the genre-hopping, singer David Brown is the focal point of most of these
songs, filling up any empty spaces with wordy forays into awkward seduction.
â€œHotter Than a Poptartâ€ is his idea of a compliment. â€œWe can make a video and
put it up on YouTube,â€ he purrs on opener â€œBig Chief.â€ Sometimes it makes you
chuckle, but too often it sounds like the singer from Barenaked Ladies doing a
bad R. Kelly impression.

PBS is at its strongest when it dials things down. â€œFool Runninâ€™ â€ has the best
combination of easygoing funk and sprightly guitar and keyboards. â€œDance Aloneâ€
is straightforward blue-eyed soul thatâ€™s neither tongue-in-cheek or overly
saccharine, allowing listeners to groove without cringing.
