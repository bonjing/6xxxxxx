|   Something For Kate, a band that is well recognised down under, and         |
|   overly praised by some listeners, (re: Doug Belfast), are hardly known     |
|   elsewhere, though this double disc effort was made to try and change       |
|   that. Echolalia, named after the mental disorder that lets people          |
|   express in a form of constant mimicking doesn't sum up this album quite    |
|   right. Though as it is a double disc effort, there is a lot of filler.     |
|                                                                              |
|   The first disc features a majority of the highlight tracks, one of them    |
|   being 'Monsters,' which was quite successful here in Aus, with its         |
|   sweeping verses and quite light weight chorus. And lyrically Paul          |
|   Dempsey is once again at his phenomenal best:                              |
|                                                                              |
|   I was hiding away under water                                              |
|   Waiting for distance and buying some time                                  |
|   Trying to be two hundred thousand years younger                            |
|   So I could excuse myself from humankind                                    |
|   'Cause I don't want to be a container                                      |
|   Or a bastard with a ten page disclaimer                                    |
|   But these monsters spin me around                                          |
|   Get me down, just try and shut me out                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   The early parts of the record gives as a slickly produced sound that       |
|   could probably sound a lot better live, though is glossed with studio      |
|   perfection. As the record roles on we come to 'Feeding The Birds and       |
|   Hoping for Something in Return' which begins with a march like drum        |
|   beat, before the gloriously voiced Paul Dempsey directs the pattern in a   |
|   different direction with his guitar work. 'Twenty Years' is probably the   |
|   best song on the first disc with a very pop heavy feel, though it has a    |
|   more rushed tempo, giving it a spine tingled feeling and a sense of        |
|   urgency.                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   The second disc is full of live versions of the first disc, as well as     |
|   some re recorded older material and is a bit scratchy in sections. While   |
|   the live versions of some tracks are quite spectacular, it doesn't have    |
|   the nice coherent flow that the first disc does. While the album has       |
|   some amazing standout tracks, like 'Monsters' 'Twenty Years' the fast      |
|   paced 'Say Something' and odd 'Feeding The Birds and Hoping for            |
|   Something in Return' it is plagued with filler, which is unfortunate       |
|   since some of the good tracks are up there with Something For Kate's       |
|   best.                                                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   On Echolalia Something For Kate are gasping for a wider playing arena,     |
|   and have had some success with 'Monsters' but unfortunately it has         |
|   probably come out as the bands weakest release to date. While the album    |
|   is slickly produced, it doesn't seem quite full enough, or it's missing    |
|   something vital, though it is a Something For Kate album, so whatever      |
|   the lows may be, there are still a lot of highs. [jimmie stephens,         |
