If David Lynch had a French half-brother he might have made "With a Friend Like Harry." It's a strangely colored macabre thriller, directed by Dominik Moll and written by Gilles Marchand and Moll. The story is about a well-to-do guy, Harry (Sergi Lopez), who insinuates himself and his girlfriend, Plum (Sophie Guillemin), into the lives of a middle-class family -- Michel, his wife, Claire, and their three little daughters -- after the two men meet in a roadside men's room. Harry's apparent motive is to help his old pal Michel, with whom he claims to have gone to high school. (Michel never really remembers Harry.) 

Harry begins trying to solve Michel's problems. The family's car breaks down, so Harry buys them a new SUV. He offers to drive Claire home from grocery shopping in his Mercedes. He urges Michel to write again, as he did in high school. 

And then things get weird. The plot twists that follow are Hitchcockian, but these are less intrinsic to the movie's intents than the bizarre moments and intermittent disturbing humor
