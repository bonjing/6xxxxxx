The Grease Band was a rock band that started out as Joe Cocker's backing band. They recorded two albums in the 1970s. They are probably most widely known for their performance of The Beatles song, "With a Little Help from My Friends", with Joe Cocker at the Woodstock Festival in 1969. With respect to their self-titled first album, reviewer Joe Viglione said "...though this is far from commercial, it is important to have this document of the guys who made magic behind Joe Cocker in 1969 and Marianne Faithfull in the mid-'70s. ...Recorded in London, it is vintage stuff, and 100 years from its making will no doubt be respected for the historic and studious record that it is."[1]

The keyboard player was Chris Stainton, another Sheffield born man (known to his friends as Robin) who went on to tour extensively with Eric Clapton. The bassist was Alan Spenner, who went on to play in the UK white soul outfit Kokomo, with rhythm guitarist Neil Hubbard. Drummer Bruce Rowland later joined Fairport Convention from 1975 through 1979. Henry McCullough was the lead guitarist, a role he later occupied in Paul McCartney's Wings, and continues today as a solo artist.[2] Wikipedia.
