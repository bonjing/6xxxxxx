JavaScript: A Beginner's Guide, Third Edition By John Pollock

Bestselling author John Pollock provides a new edition of his hands-on, step-by-step tutorial, covering the newest features in JavaScript 2.0, including new "type" attributes and values, use of external "unobtrusive" scripts, the seven new Array methods, and more. 
All of the code in the book is completely revised to use XHTML Transitional, rather than the old capitalized HTML style, and new coverage of Firefox is included. The book now features the new and improved A Beginner's Guide style.
John Pollock runs two Web sites devoted to Web development technology, PageResource.com and JavaScript City.
