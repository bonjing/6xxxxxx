Auto xbins just isn't working for me recently, just keep getting ""connection closed by peer"".
So i thought lets try PB and voila! Thanks m8 "
,IMHUMAN,2011-06-16T04:59Z,"Dreileon - Yes, but by what i understand you will need to use ppf-o-matic to patch the ap25 on those games and then run them through abgx."
,timmythedl,2011-06-16T11:59Z,does anyone know if you can play the games with the new checks on them like hunted?
,nikolai1uno,2011-06-17T03:27Z,"@IMHUMAN 

Actually ABGX360 will auto-correct AP 2.5 if set to level 3, so you don't need it anymore.

cheers!"
