One of the greatest Latin bands, the Big 3 Palladium Orchestra, takes to the stage at
London's Barbican for a unique concert. They embody the spirit of the original Mambo Kings
and perform the music of the three legendary bandleaders and composers / Machito, Tito
Rodriguez and Tito Puente / who set light to the dance floor of New York's Palladium
Ballroom throughout the 1950s.

The Orchestra contains members who played in the original Palladium Ballroom and is
fronted by Machito Jr [son of the original bandleader, Machito AKA Frank Grill] and Tito
Rodriguez Jr [son of the legendary singer]. Joining this scorching ensemble are guest
soloists, legendary Fania pianist and producer Larry Harlow and trombonist Jimmy Bosch.

The Orchestra is the brainchild of Machito Jr, who approached the Puente and Rodriguez
families to recreate the music of this golden era, and the band has quickly become
recognised as probably the finest Latin Jazz ensemble in the USA. Much of the music is
based on historic charts by the three original bandleaders, and the Barbican concert explores
a repertoire from the beginnings of Mambo right through to the explosive and enduring sound
created in the hot house of the Fania label / a sound which has been one of the defining
styles of salsa.
