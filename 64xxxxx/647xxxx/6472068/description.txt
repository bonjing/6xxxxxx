                It is the day of Sambuca's memorial service, and
                everyone struggles with their grief. Vicki discovers
                she is pregnant with Aiden's child, and leaves Aiden
                reeling - just as Jess drops a bombshell of her own.
                Karen realises that her attempts to impress Richard
                Whitman are futile; his desire to close Waterloo Road
                has become a personal crusade.
