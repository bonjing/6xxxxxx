Loder

The legend (2007) :

""People - loder is simply an automated 'bot' that finds new torrents on other sites and posts them here on TPB.
 If they're not seeded, it's because the original torrent isn't being seeded. 

There isn't any info EVER for a loder torrent BECAUSE it's NOT a person.

Might as well whinge at your toaster!""
___________________________________________________________________________

The ""Loder"" did indeed have like 25.000 + torrents.
All very well seeded, Nestan
Until he and MovieX got busted in Bollmora Sweden.

After the trial:
Loder and his gang (Mr Solo) must also promise never to deal with torrents..

- So now live Mike ""The Loder"" at the Sunny Hospital Hotel in Monte Carlo.
Living good at his not spent money,

(Like in the Us -This was all about money)
- Sure, I`ll give you half crown for it.

/Gapskratt - Fingal Olsson - men det mesta e faktiskt alldeles sant."
