"In Manhattan, twenty-two year-old Harvard lawyer Emilia Greenleaf has a crush on her boss, Jack Woolf, and they have an affair. Jack's marriage is a sham but his son, William, is his pride and joy. Emilia soon discovers she's pregnant, and Jack divorces from his wife, Carolyne, in order to marry her. His son is poisoned against the partnership by his mother, and he is also resented by his stepmother. Emilia, who has issues with her womanizer father, delivers Isabel but three days later, the baby dies. Her marriage begins to suffer and unexpectedly William steps in to help find out the truth about Isabel's death."
