,abricoz_account,2012-01-19T14:06Z,"Hi mate,

can you, by any chance, seed a few more minutes? I have downloaded up to 92.3% and the thing is that only have 1 completed song (From Cradle to Grave -> which rocks!!) but still... I'm so desperate to have my lost cd's back... if only it's in mp3 I'm a reasonable happy man!

in any case, it's a fact that you are a great dude! otherwise, you wouldn't listen to this!

keep on rocking!"
