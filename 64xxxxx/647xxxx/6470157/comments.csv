,Onimaru9,2011-06-15T02:18Z,"Hi iMZDL, as usual, awesome upload but I'm curious  to know if this is different from the recent posted torrents pf: 11A480B? please let me know.... much appreciated."
,mnfesq,2011-06-15T07:28Z,"Apple released a minor update to DP4, changing the build from 11A480B to 11A480E.  The change fixes a problem with installations on the MBP 11.  Apparently, it fixed a problem with Lion hanging on reboot after installation and also a Wi-Fi problem."
,Onimaru9,2011-06-15T12:29Z,@ mnfesq thanx a lot. much appreciated.

,misanthropic_unicorn,2011-06-18T05:01Z,"This installed without a problem as an upgrade to  10.6.7 on my 3.06GHz Core 2 Duo Late 2009 iMac.

Just ran Software Update a moment ago and it updated to Build 11A494a

Everything seems to be working so far."

,maximiliankylen,2011-06-18T15:24Z,"Got a MacBook Pro 15inch and tried to install it without success... shows a ""fail message"" at 28 minutes left... Anyone know how to fix this? currently running OS X Lion DP 3..."
,misanthropic_unicorn,2011-06-18T20:15Z,"If you're having difficulty installing this, try this:

1. Boot from your original installation DVD
2. Run Disk Utility
3. Select your intended installation drive and click ""Repair Disk""
4. After the disk repair completes, click ""Repair Disk Permissions""
5. Reboot as usual and run the 10.7 installer

Worked for me..."
,pimmas,2011-06-19T14:30Z,@ stevchrly thanks i'm now running dp3 so i can just update
,danibo77,2011-06-20T06:48Z,"@creative_expansion 
I think you should stay away from any developer preview until the final version of Lion is released..

Not that it doesn't work, but it's just not for YOU! No offense.."
,mnload,2011-06-20T22:06Z,"Just perfect, I burned it onto a CD and did a clean install! I even have the ability to do software updates via apple! 

Minor bugs, like the sorty by name function not working sometimes etc. but apart from things like that perfect

P.S. tried both normal install and clean install and both worked ""perfectly"" "
,creative_expansion,2011-06-26T01:32Z,"danibo77  or dannyboy whatever ur name is. y the fuck is it not for me? are u too cool or something? or do u just think you are. its already installed I'm obviously not going to go thru the pain in the ass going back to snow leopard 10.6.7. my question was not aimed at ur stupid ass. i wanted to make sure it didn't matter that i didn't wait for snow leopard 10.6.8 before i got lion? and asked how to do an update to dp 4, without having to download an entire huge torrent all over again. and your completely right I'm not a loser computer geek that has nothing else to do. i was wondering if anybody else was having issues?"
,dstone99,2011-06-26T13:58Z,"No need to burn this onto a cd or place it onto a usb  memory stick /thumb drive

Here's what I did.

1. created a partition using Disk Utility
2. mount image and install onto new partition (you'll have the option of choosing)
3. reboot
4. reboots into new partition and finishes install

finished

You'll be able to update OS X  Lion via Software Update.

The gestures on this are so much fun.

Lion seems much more responsive than Snow Leopard on my 2010 13"" Macbook Pro. Swiping between apps is nice.

Full screen apps like Safari are a blast. Much more intuitive to operate. Awesome UI!"
,plume,2011-06-27T19:28Z,"@creative_expansion

You are clearly a delicate little flower who gets upset easily, but danibo77 was right.

This is a beta not meant for public release.  You say yourself that you are not ""a loser computer geek that has nothing else to do"" by which I take it that you are not particularly technical and definitely not a developer.  This is called a ""Developer Preview"" because it is meant for, wait for it, developers.

If you have to ask the sort of questions you are asking, you are not the sort of person this software is aimed at.  If you were, you would know that developer releases always have numerous issues and are NOT meant for running on a production system."
