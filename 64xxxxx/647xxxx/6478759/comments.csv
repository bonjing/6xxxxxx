,pitts41891,2011-06-18T18:40Z,is this fake or real
,AriGold45,2011-06-18T19:54Z,"It's real. I'm downloading the other copies with the small file sizes to see if this is the same one, only larger.  The beginning is all I've seen of yet, but it looks watchable after a focus fix and a guy walking across the screen. I'll update when i watch more and compare to the other copies"
,akridine,2011-06-18T19:54Z,"Its real but horrible quality. 

A - 3
V - 4"
,LeonGT,2011-06-18T19:57Z,"real, but super crappy. thanks anyway"
,brown2832,2011-06-18T20:01Z,its real but its really blurry and half way threw the movie it goes black for 3 min then it comes back for the rest of the movie
,yopparai2,2011-06-18T20:01Z,"Real, but Video 3/10 Audio 5/10"
,sqwelssh,2011-06-18T20:38Z,Don't bother AriGold45 with the small ones downloaded them earlier and there the same kind of A/V as this one and the screen goes blank aswell after 52 mins. Wait for some better copies.
,AriGold45,2011-06-18T21:13Z,"sqwelssh is right, it seems to be the same copies as the others, only with a larger filesize.  

I, unlike most of my friends, have no problems with cams.  Unfortunately, I have to say this one is almost unwatchable.  Most of the movie is fine, albeit low quality.  But the scenes that blur and/or black out make it frustrating to watch."
,JuggaloLash,2011-06-19T04:30Z,its good if you really wanna watch it. its decent for a cam
,senorpianist,2011-06-19T10:39Z,"for those who like good cam quality dont download.but those who are just desperate to see this film go ahead but take my word ,quality is not good
