This manual, by author Matt Smith, points out all the best new features of Microsoft's latest office suite, and explains them all in one handy guide. In most programs, it's not hard to find every single feature, but Office 2010 is so expansive that even veteran users will often find that they aren't expert in even half of the capabilities the software offers.
