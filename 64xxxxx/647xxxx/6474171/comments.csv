@bookzilla and ivaboner - Some uploaders use software will allow you to take a 1.4 Dvdrip copy and converted it into a 4.12GB ready to burn and watch, but is still the quality is only as good as  its original 1.4GB size, so the quality is good, but not as good as a ripped copy of the actual retail Dvd 5!

If you are looking for the actual Dvd - Here is Dvd 5 Retail!
