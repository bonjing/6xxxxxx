 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742  2hrs 54mins 41seconds version

Note: We have a number of exciting movies arriving from Europe next week 
that we look forward to being able to share.


We now have the pleasure to bring you this 720p resolution 2.77GB 
DivX conversion from the Cinefile 1080p 13GB file we downloaded ages ago - 
saves on bandwidth and is more reasonable for our mission as most reasonable stewards of cultural resources - I submit. Please download our 4GB 1080p
version instead if you prefer to have the higher resolution and bitrate 
combined (3200k bitrate).

1280 X 720 resolution 2800k video bitrate with great 256K audio too
(plays at normal viewing speed on our test computer station using the 
free vlc player software too)

The world has long been "going to the dogs" as it were.
The reason for this is that most of the planet does not have the spirit of the
supreme human beauty of the head of this family - Ms. Julie Andrews

They are as Judas to her amd want to see her spirit destroyed.
They invent a new religion called "multiculturalism" in order to make merit
a thing of the past, and human survival impossible "against the odds"

Please do what you can to destroy this conspiracy of the wicked and hateful
against those that truly most love the dear Irish spirit which is now mainly
to be found in Germany Holland Sweden France, Poland, and such areas that
remain, not to mention Russia - where true love has endured to this day Im
happy to say, as my own truest love of the Irish spirit comes from my mother's
endowed legacy as she was undoubtedly from the lovely Ukraine - as we trace her
genetic roots today.

Please note - the German audio track we previously posted separately will not work
with this version as it is for the Europe issue original movie file version
from which we have created a separate 3.7GB torrent for you here:
