,benus,2011-06-17T17:42Z,"Hi ChattChitto.

You seem to be popular and professional with your uploads, may I ask whether you could try to make available 2 little programs that help to install XP on ramdisk partition. These have not been done yet. Diskless Angel & Little Angel are interesting apps. Please let me know whether it's possible. Thanks in advance, also for your hard work. Cheerio. "

,wired2,2011-06-23T08:52Z,"Not working with Vista Home Pri 32 bit. Installs OK, but will not convert an avi movie to iPad format. The clock is running, but nothing being converted. Reinstalled 4 times, same problem.  Tried 5 different avi clips. No problem with DVDFab 8.0.7.3 or Handbrake.

Thanks for the all the downloads, but this one not working for me."
,karlocool,2011-06-23T19:07Z,Thanks Again !!
,Outback6,2011-06-24T18:03Z,I'm having a similar problem to wired2.   Can't get DVDs to rip to .avi or other formats.  There's nothing on DVDFab's forums about this problem (yet) so wondering if it is a problem with ChattChitto's release or an v.8.1.0.0 problem in general.  (8.0.9.8 rips same DVD just fine.)
,Needleteeth,2011-06-25T18:41Z,"Works fine if you want to copy a Blu t 100%, but if any re-encoding is necessary, it just sits there and does nothing.  Never had this problem with earlier versions."
,nomimanni,2011-06-28T04:58Z,"Thanks sooo much! I needed this. Clean, all working. :)"
,downaccs,2011-06-28T19:00Z,"does the crack work on Win XP x64? because it is not working for me.

run the patch, even try to copy manually the msvcr90.dll to program folder. no luck!

or do i have to disconnect internet while setup?

pls help. tks."
,daver412,2011-07-01T20:54Z,"There was a problem with this version with re-encoding and it has been addressed it the latest release which I believe is Dvdfab 8103Qt.

@ChattChitto - love the uploads always work perfect, but like i said above latest version is 8103Qt which addresses this encoding problem people are having. Just a heads up."
