[T],ajaxen94,2011-07-10T01:01Z,@Tal2me i rather think you are the idiot i dont know what you are listening to but there is no spanish dubbed over the english on my file and i dont think people would still be seeding it if there was you bloody ignoramous

Audio 1 english
Audio 2 German
Audio 3 French
Audio 4 Spanish
Audio 5 Italian
