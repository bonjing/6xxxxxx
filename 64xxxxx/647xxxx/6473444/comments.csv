,mrgogos,2011-06-16T21:29Z,does it works?
,marcusfenix919,2011-06-16T22:07Z,Is this one buggy too? (framerate dips)
,NukedHamster,2011-06-17T00:04Z,marcusfenix919: Your frame rate problem is not a bug. You need to turn PhysX off. If the issue persists then it is an issue you will have to address with your computer.

How do I turn it off?  I use an ATi card.(my problem seems to be gone after updating to 11.6)  I've set PhysX from 8 to 0 in the config.ini if that's what you're wondering?"
,marcusfenix919,2011-06-17T00:52Z,I've got everything working fine except for getting kicked about 5 minutes in to playing.  I'm thinking I'm going to cave and buy it.  It's the first game I've played in while that seems worth $50-60
,NukedHamster,2011-06-17T01:00Z,"Nah man, you're over complicating it. When you first get into the game (the main menu screen), before you start playing, go into the Video options and set PhysX to low or off. This can't be done while you are playing. 
Buying it is a good idea too. Wouldn't mind seeing Alice 3."
