,skulldragon,2011-06-17T06:48Z,"People people people! Instead of giving out the license code, which doesn't work, please give your License.dat file from ASC folder!"
[T],faren73,2011-06-17T07:35Z,"Ignore the previous two comments, the serial works just fine. For anyone new to installing I can only say that you must do the following, 1.disconnect yourself from the internet, 2.enter the provided serial and 3.block the application with a firewall. 4.DO NOT ALLOW THE PROGRAM TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET!!! and of course never try to update the program, instead wait for the next release on TPB and repeat the rules above, non-noobs already know this"

,skulldragon,2011-06-19T06:50Z,"Ahh, I finally got this shit to work thanks to repeating installation with Revo Uninstaller...

I don't know exactly, what caused ASC to reset back to FREE, but I think it was a hidden update, that was secretly installed somewhere to tell ASC to ignore that SN or maybe it was just a bug with older version...

Oh well, thanks..."
,jiveclive,2011-07-06T13:31Z,"This shit is working!!! Feel me, mofos? Shit works just like faren73 said it would. So I just wanna thank Anacondaz for a good job well done. Me granma, she gave me fluffy pancakes every Sunday and took me to movies when my folks thought we wuz going to church. Still, I want to thank Jesus for giving me such a cool granma. Big up yourself, JC. And last but not least, my stable of ho's who are out there for me, selling their precious and giving me 90%. I wouldn't be the man I am without them. "
,jiveclive,2011-07-06T13:33Z,"Well, they not 'cactly ""givin"" me the 90% but no point in quibbling. 90% is still 90% and that's not a bad deal compare to what other give their girls. Aaaight."
