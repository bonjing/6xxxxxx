,NHProwess,2011-07-02T11:34Z,"Thanks uploader ! :D 
Playing it now, works good. 
But shit it is hard !"
,mng6188,2011-08-10T10:28Z,"After I downloaded the file, I unpacked the files and all i could find was the Cd Image. I mounted and installed but I could not find the Prophet Directory with the Patch and Crack files. What do I do? Is the Prophet Directory sapposed to be in the file I unpacked?"
,vipkryq3,2011-09-10T03:38Z,"The PROPHET dir it's inside the iso image...

,Zanda777,2011-10-07T10:05Z,"I was wondering if anybody could tell me how to get the main file working. I used 7z to extract the main file from the 60 smaller file pieces in the torrent, and gave the file extract an .iso extention, but I can't mount it."
,Zanda777,2011-10-07T15:40Z,"Nevermind my above comment.

Do not download this torrent, you'll just be wasting your bandwidth no matter what you do. I analysed the data files with QuickSfv and the first 20 files have mismatching CRC codes. Meaning the file you extract will pretty much be corrupt and useless due to the 20 bad files.

Fix the torrent or delete it MAFIAA."
,jerm57,2011-10-21T06:01Z,Disregard zanda777. Just downloaded it and it works fine.
,bozolino,2012-01-30T02:57Z,I'd joined up with hjsplit and changed the archive into .iso and ins't worked...
,NephilimNexus,2012-03-08T13:07Z,"Since this game is considered an expansion for ""Armored Princess,"" does it include that too?  Just curious, since I've noticed that finding an English version for that game has proven rather difficult here on Pirate Bay."
,NephilimNexus,2012-03-08T13:08Z,"Oh hi, I'm blind: ""Contains   King's   Bounty:   Armored Princess""

Good to know!  And thanks for the great warez!"
,cbc9797,2012-03-15T23:25Z,Thank you! Works perfectly!
,obidobi88,2012-05-01T00:27Z,"I seem to be having the same problem as zanda77, unable to mount the file."
,haakon89,2012-05-07T23:07Z,"working great so far. had to manually open the zipped files with winrar, but evrything went smoothly after that"
,cbc9797,2012-06-01T02:50Z,Thank you. Works flawlessly.
,jesusshockwave,2012-06-16T11:09Z,Could someone upload a mac version of this? Please? It is possible. It goes for $20 in the mac app store. Anyone feeling up to the challenge? THANKS!
