,wontpayforit,2011-06-18T13:41Z,"If we do not head history, we're bound to repeat the same mistakes again.

Actually not WE but THEM, the powers that be.
Those pathetic fear mongering war fairing idiots that ponder up these schemes and send young men and women to die on foreign soil."
,Bluetack,2011-06-18T14:02Z,I'm seeding it too.  This one will probably get up to speed quickly.
,Bluetack,2011-06-19T16:11Z,"Alright, this one has plenty of seeds now and is running nicely alongside
the long-filename version at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6470778

The full Slim Set is also online at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6474110
It's 1.34 GiB (1442490549 Bytes), so people might prefer it over these originals.
Do you want to start a short filename version of that one too, asc11?  I'll help."
,Bluetack,2011-06-28T13:51Z,"The Pentagon Papers archives.gov small-files version with 
short filenames like this torrent is now seeding at:

https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6487363

That makes four healthy torrents of The Pentagon Papers,
giving you the choices of small or large files and short or 
long filenames, all verified and permanently seeded."
