Though Alison McKenzie lives near beauty-obsessed Beverly Hills, she's fine being a Plain Jane. But her mother Anne believes beauty is the key to success. So when Alison suffers a burn, Anne takes her to a plastic surgeon. The surgeon says he can not only take care of the scar but can make her beautiful. Anne is enchanted by his promises, and by him. As a romance blooms, Alison's transformation begins.

Then Alison finds a picture of the doctor's first wife and notices a resemblance to the work he's doing on her. Anne insists there's no resemblance, but Alison discovers that her now stepfather's first wife committed suicide after being disfigured in an accident - and that the woman had not always been beautiful; when he married her, she was as plain as Alison.

Finally she discovers that at the time of the dead woman's original surgery, there was a series of killings in the area, and each of the victims had one feature or another that bore a great resemblance to those of the surgeon's first wife. Now, there is a similar series of killings going on, and finally Alison understands. But is it too late?
