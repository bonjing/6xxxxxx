Thank you very much!"
,L4F,2011-06-27T22:20Z,"I watched the entire Le Mans race so I am well familiar with the format.

Parts 1, 3 & 5 were broadcast in HDTV on the SpeedHD channel.

Parts 2 and 4 were STREAMED over the Internet and NOT broadcast, except perhaps, in Europe.

So if this is truely the final part of the tace then it MUST be Part 5.

Therefore, I believe this torrent is mis-named, based on the original race as it was transmitted.

,Administrator999,2011-06-29T14:56Z,"I dont know if they are mis-named. I have downloaded this from a privat tracker, and it covers all that was sent on SpeedTV, from start to end. Please help me seed this. I am seeding 24/7, but it seems like lots of people just downloading, and not stay for seeding. I need more seeders please. Please seed the same amount that you downloaded. Ratio 1:1. 14,62 GB down, and 14,62 GB up. Please help me seeding. Thank you all that help me out!"
,oCoreCyan,2011-07-16T02:33Z,Brilliant torrent! Incase someone is wondering if all 3 parts show all the coverage of the race well the answer is yes. I downloaded all 3 parts and watched every hour of it and the quality was brilliant and the sound had no problems with the speed of the torrent either. Overall great torrent. I will seed until 14GB to return the favour thanks for this upload.
,L4F,2011-09-11T05:17Z,"oCoreCyan, If you downloaded parts 1, 2 & 3 from TPB, I don't see how you could have watched the entire race. There is a whole lot missing; the two parts that were streamed.

The uploader claims these time durations:

Part1: 2 hrs 17min
Part2: 3 hrs 2 min
Part3: 7 hrs 51 min

I make it 13 hours 10 minutes total; a little over HALF the race.

I have all 5 parts including the 3 posted on TPB. Parts 2 and 5 were streamed in realtime and the quality is not that great. It never is on streaming video. That is why I haven't released them.

Anyway, I glad these are available."

,shores,2012-03-28T20:26Z,I can only hope the uploader sees this: will you be able to get the same thing for 2012? It would be AWESOME.
