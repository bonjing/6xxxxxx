Lagwagon - Discography (1992-2008) [FLAC]

Biography
by Jason Ankeny
Southern California punks Lagwagon formed in the small town of Goleta in 1990. Originally dubbed Section 8, Lagwagon's lineup frequently fluctuated during their formative period and, by the time of the band's 1992 debut, Duh, was comprised of singer Joey Cape, guitarists Chris Flippin and Shawn Dewey, bassist Jesse Buglione, and drummer Derrick Plourde. Trashed followed two years later, and in 1995 Lagwagon returned with Hoss; Plourde left the band shortly after and was replaced by ex-Rich Kids on LSD drummer Dave Raun. Former Posies guitarist Ken Stringfellow also replaced Dewey in time for Lagwagon's next effort, 1997's Double Plaidinum; he soon departed as well, and another Rich Kids alum, guitarist Chris Rest, was on board for 1998's Let's Talk About Feelings. It took five years to record 2003's Blaze -- Let's Talk About Leftovers, a compilation of B-sides, outtakes, and songs both old and new appeared in 2000, but it found the group as reliable as ever, touting anthems both political and personal. Cape then issued a split acoustic album, aptly titled Acoustic, with No Use for a Name's Tony Sly in 2004. Both Live in a Dive and Resolve were released in 2005. The latter album was dedicated to drummer Plourde; sadly, he had committed suicide earlier in the year. Joey Cape carried on, playing on the side as a guitarist for Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, touring Europe with Lagwagon, and completing a solo acoustic album in June of 2008, after a two-year process. August brought forth a new EP for the band, titled I Think My Older Brother Used to Listen, which, including their first 7", marked their tenth release on Fat Wreck Chords.
