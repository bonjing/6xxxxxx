Just decided to upload this one because it's sooo slow on other hosts and so far this is the only Crashday version that works without the need of applying a patch on 7/Vista. So you can easily add mods like nitro and change the track by replacing the files in trkdata/tracks.

BTW: It also has multiplayer, you could try looking for some private servers on the web.

Have fun!
