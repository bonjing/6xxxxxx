The Parted Magic OS employs core programs of GParted and Parted to handle partitioning tasks with ease, while featuring other useful software (e.g. Partimage, TestDisk, Truecrypt, Clonezilla, G4L, SuperGrubDisk, ddrescue, etcâ€¦) and an excellent set of info to benefit the user. An extensive collection of file system tools are also included, as Parted Magic supports the following: btrfs, ext2, ext3, ext4, fat16, fat32, hfs, hfs+, jfs, linux-swap, ntfs, reiserfs, reiser4, and xfs.

6/14/2011: Parted Magic 6.2
It's that time of the month again. The most noticeable change is Rox now handles the desktop icons and feh displays the desktop wallpaper. These seemed like the best light weight choices in preparation for the new PCManFM when it's released as stable. Parted was upgraded to 3.0, but GParted is still linked against LibParted 2.4 for now. All fonts should look good in Firefox if you use a language other than US English. A few other useful programs were added like ZFS Fuse, Lilo Setup, Rox Filer, and FixParts.
Updated programs: testdisk-6.12, parted-3.0, linux-2.6.38.8, chntpw-110511, gparted-0.8.1, unetbootin-linux-549, module-init-tools-3.16, lilo-22.8, boot_info_script-0.60, file-5.07, flashrom_0.9.3+r1323, lsscsi-0.25, lzip-1.12, rsync-3.0.8, sdparm-1.06, xfsdump-3.0.5, xfsprogs-3.1.5, xz-5.0.2
