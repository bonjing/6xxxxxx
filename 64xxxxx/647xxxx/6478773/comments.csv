,pabloms2tx,2011-07-01T22:17Z,its not working.. if i use the original launch gta it asks me for a code and if use the launch gta from the patch folder it tells me to install the latest controllers for the video card
,xangxiao,2011-07-01T22:34Z,did you first install the whole then then copied all things from the crack folder into the install folder?
,xangxiao,2011-07-01T22:35Z,"did you first install the whole then then copied all things from the crack folder into the install folder?
i think if you don't do the crack it will ask for a code and if you use the crack it doesn't"
,pabloms2tx,2011-07-02T18:33Z,"yeah if copy the three files from the crack folder and when i launch it, it asks me to update directx (i already did and have directx 11) and to update the controllers from my video card "

,normatio,2011-07-09T07:05Z,I have done all the steps but its says theres a fatal error and i have to reboot my system.. any ideas why?
,xangxiao,2011-07-09T16:18Z,"for the crack go to where you download it for me it's
D:\user\Games\gta IV\GTA IV PC Version\GTA IV PATCH 1.0.3.0 + CRACK\GTA IV 1.0.3.0 Crack + Patch\GTA IV 1.0.3.0 Crack + Patch\Crack
or something like that

when i tried to install i stuck a lil too with switching discs or file but you do need to select the data itself at not the file where it's in the rest i don't know sorry"
,Heylia,2011-07-09T18:31Z,deos the data3.cab file exist on the gta iv dvd 2 file? i tried to do it that way but it can' still find it
,xangxiao,2011-07-10T14:20Z,i checked it and the data3.cab does exist on the dvd 2 file if you unpack it with winirar
,pkelly878,2011-07-11T09:05Z,"whats the fuckin' deal. don't bother seeding if your gonna set your cap at 2kb/sec. I'm connected to 100 seeds and 100 peers getting only 2.3 mb/sec down.
I should be capping out my connection at 5mb/sec with this many connections. Piratebay is good for leeching, but thats about it. Thats why I don't seed, because no one else does. All of my 35Mbps upload goes to private trackers."
,Stianwc,2011-07-11T15:30Z,ok. Step 1. Download everything. what should that mean? 
,Stianwc,2011-07-11T15:34Z,"i really need help i really wanna play the game and this is my first torrent download, it took 3 days to download and i really dont wanna delete the game.."
,Stianwc,2011-07-11T15:43Z,"why do i have to register?

it doesent work register.

and wich of the programs should i use, autorun or GTAIV?"
,xangxiao,2011-07-12T08:14Z,"download everyting just mean download the whole thing, can;t be easier

second you don't have to register on the socialclub if you don't want
just try one and see if it's going to install or not sometimes you just have to try, if you that afraid fo deleting something just copy the whole thing(yes again 'the whole thing') and use it as backup"
,BePwnR,2011-07-12T20:28Z,"Works like a charm ! thanks for this upload!

I just have one question: it's possible to play from my old savegame. I know that, but also with this? where does this cracked version save the games and how do I activate windows live (for offline, since I already have an account, (I bought GTAIV first but my cd is full of scratches so I was very unhappy with it)).

tnx in advance, and ty for the upload again. "

,xangxiao,2011-07-15T15:28Z,"you can always download a later patch and install that, but i never had any problems so i didn't think it was necessary to install it and you never install something in the savefolder most crack like 99% goes in the install folder"

,Daiquirii,2011-08-19T16:05Z,"For all those having trouble: Follow the instructions in the description. Honestly, it's that easy.

1. Download
2. Winrar to open iso
3. Install
4. Go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6574458/GTA_IV_ALL_PATCHES___CRACK___XLIVE_DLL_FIX and download the files.
5. Install the patches in order, from 1.0.1.0 to 1.0.7.0
6. Copy the cracked 1.0.7.0 and paste it into where you installed the game (probably C:/Program Files/Rockstar or something like that)
7. Right click on the cracked exe and go to Properties then Compatibility and tell it to always run as administrator (this isn't in the directions, but almost always helps)
8. Double click the game and play.

It's not hard, honestly. Currently downloading this great game. Thanks, xangxiao."
,light333,2011-08-22T05:34Z,no key required? 
,xangxiao,2011-08-28T20:29Z,"thx Daiquirii for the help

I opened up the dvd 1 and saw the gta4, rgsc, and the 2 autoruns. So i run the autorun.exe. But there's no install coming up. Also in dvd 2 I open up gta IV and clicked data3. however when it was done extracting/loading it said: Error: Launchgame couldn't be found. (or something like that)
i tried installing the patch, but it made no difference. also i can't do anything with the crack.

,Terozer,2012-01-09T05:38Z,"Everything works but its true the game is ""auto drunk"", gas keeps hangning and the mouse sense
is extremly low. You cannot change the sense or the key setting, because this version is ripped from a Play station or something.

Also the camera angle do not follow the car when you are driving. This makes driving very difficult.

I installed this game with many of the complications that have arisen in all these comments. I have managed to get round these issues and now have the game working just about at a pace which is playable. 

1.Installed
2.Used the 7 Patches mentioned in previous comment. Installed then copied to installation directory in C: 
3.Copy the crack which comes with 7 Patches to directory installation folder.
4.I then did find this website which helped to speed things up a bit:
http://www.tastethetech.com/games/pc/how-play-gta-4-smoothly-on-low-end-pc/
This helped BUT! As some of you guys have had problems with the drunk cam come up! You may of worked crack properly but if you use the game booster 3 mentioned on this website the crack is bypassed and game does not function. 
You need to clean up comp, defrag, uninstall any unused programs etc....
5.Go to http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897428.aspx
Download the config.exe file, then follow steps on the website in step 4. I struggled at 1st. You need to copy and paste this file to the directory installation folder for GTA IV the right click on the icon and create shortcut, it may ask to create shortcut to desktop, do this. Then right click icon, properties then in the target field type: -s with space between comma's, OK then right click icon again! Run as administrator! 
6. Then after completed all clean up and optimisation of your computer! Re-start. 
7.Download or have ready the game booster 2!!! This you game put in game mode, when applying game mode cllick ALL folders in set up to give MAX performance. 
8. Right click task bar in bottom of screen to open task manager so when double clicking the icon to start game you can right click on the processes bar to put GTA game as high prior4ity/performance. 

I also use 4 gig card for ready boost on windows, i don't know if works completely, seems to work though. I then open game booster go onto game mode open up GTA! Check screen resolution setting for you comp and then in start menu for game when running you will have to fiddle with the graphic settings to suit screen! Then i turn of things like GPS for the HUD and map, as all extra little things that add up to make the game run slower. Try set all these settings for optimum performance. Also visual/screen settings like colour etc will help and hope this all helps, it works now for me, and I have been told that only a quad core will ever play game properly! Well! works, if slightly slow but the game is playable! Thanks to the uploader :-)  "
