,Lithium1056,2011-06-24T06:13Z,"@Road-Killer, it would be nice if you'd comment about the quality of the torrent and not about your personal view of the film"

Straight DVD rip haven't viewed the DVD features yet but I'll look at them later, extract to one folder and mount in a Virtual Drive loaded fine in VLC with no issues. quality is looks to be 480P but that might just be my box."
,amann576,2011-06-30T20:58Z,"Hey. Newb here. How do i play rx files?
I tried using uplayer but it looks like i have to play them all one by one. Is there a more efficient way?
Halp! please and thanks"
,Allgood79,2011-07-03T19:31Z,"@amann576, try downloading ''videoLAN VLC media player''
It seems to play almost everything.

Thanks for the torrent SAFCuk009, good luck next season, see you in the fight for top 6!"
,Bananapicker9440,2011-07-04T00:00Z,"Great torrent, avg of 2.0 mb/s. Thanks a lot SAFCukO09.

Oh and don't listen to @road-killer, the movie is far from ""horrendous"". It's actually pretty good, worth watching."
,sak75,2011-07-04T17:25Z,"Hey guys, another n00b..but I seriously cannot get the movie to play. I've got VLC, it just keeps only playing one file at a time."
,rettsin,2011-07-09T01:38Z,"Noobs, I unpacked the rar file with 7zip in the folder containing all the rx files, then I just clicked and dragged the resulting iso image file right into vlc media player and zip, bang, boom! I am watching a high quality dvd rip as I speak. This rip is one of the best quality rips I have had the pleasure of downloading. Thanks, SAFCukO09!"
,drax12,2011-07-26T23:54Z,4.3G is way too big. I'm sure a lot of us would appreciate a 1.4G version if anyone's feeling generous.
,jggettri,2011-08-03T04:47Z,"err uhm. i must be blind or something, but i dont see the actual movie. there is a sample, covers, and other docs, but no movie...help!"
,drax12,2011-08-15T09:16Z,"To get a 1.4G version, search ""Sucker Punch"" note the space."
,260860,2011-08-26T18:17Z,This movie is just pure shite. Don't bother.
,ThatOneGuy314159,2011-09-09T23:00Z,This torrent is only a sample.
