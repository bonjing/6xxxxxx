Your Favorite Martian Info:

We're a fake cartoon band who writes comedy songs. We're 100% super-duper serious about the subject matter of our songs. Yes, our balls really are the size of the earth's moon. Yes, we really do drink the tears of baby orphans. Yes, we really have sexual relations with zombies. No, seriously.
