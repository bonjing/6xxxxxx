Im new to torrents so be patient with me while I learn. Ive tried it in the past but never could figure it out correctly. I have 500+ rips on my external 1TB hard drive, and a fast 12mbps cable connection. All my rips are MP4, and some are MP4/H264. Any tips would be appreciated, and all movies are genuine, no fakes. If you want a list or have requests email me and ill see what I can do.
