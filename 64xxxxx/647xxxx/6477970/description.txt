Release Notes:

Blaq Poet Society is a meeting of the minds of Blaq Poet and
producers Stu Bangas (Reef the Lost Cauze, Termanology,
Heltah Skeltah, Vinnie Paz, Apathy, Sha Stimuli, Chino XL)
and Vanderslice (Stat Quo, Apathy, Roc Marciano,
Termanology, Cashis) that, after a brief exchange, was
three-years in the making. As Stu Bangas clarifies: "I was
in contact with an associate of Blaq's for a few years, we
reconnected again in late 2008 and I asked him to get in
touch with Poet for a mixtape I was working on. He talked to
Poet, relayed I was interested in working with him and
vouched for me and I ended up going to Long Island too shoot
a video for a joint Poet hopped on that I produced in 2009.
When I got back to Boston, I decided I wanted to work on an
album with him and we decided to move forward with it. I
reached out to my partner Vanderslice and he was excited to
contribute production as well. The type of beats Vanderslice
and I excel at are big sounding, gangster shit, the type of
sound Poet excels over."
