Advanced Anti-spyware Detection and Removal

Webroot Spy Sweeper's advanced detection and spyware removal software is effective at fully removing even the most malicious spyware programs in a single sweep. You won't have to scan and restart your PC a number of times with Spy Sweeper - one sweep and your PC is clean.
Real-Time Anti-spyware Solution

This new version of Spy Sweeper advances the industry-standard in spyware removal softwareâ€”stopping threats like Trojan-Downloader-LowZones and SpySheriff from ever installing in the first place.
Enhanced Rootkit Discovery Methods

Malicious spyware uses rootkit technology to bury its files deep within your PC. Webroot Spy Sweeper finds and destroys these programs with robust rootkit discovery methods, a feature many other antispyware programs lack.
