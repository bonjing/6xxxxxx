,Hyperion888,2011-08-20T05:07Z,Thanks for the u/l. This is a true blu ray rip (1920 X 1080). To change to English use mkvtoolnix.
,SNZ.17,2011-08-24T10:57Z,"@Hyperion888 hey man, i downloaded mkvtoolnix but I'm totally lost on what to do to get it in english. a little help please..."
,Hyperion888,2011-09-01T11:57Z,"@SNZ.17
Start up mkvmerge
Open the movie (drag and drop if you want) â you will see all the tracks
Highlight the audio tracks and make the English track default
Hit Start muxing.
Mkvmerge will create a new movie file with an English track as default.
Delete the original and use the new .mkv"

,kylepender,2012-03-26T20:11Z,WARNING: This is the uk/european version and is about 20mins shorter than the US version. It misses out the scene when danny collapses and the doctor comes round.

other than that the quality is excellent"
