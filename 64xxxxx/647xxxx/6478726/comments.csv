,Bill_Oreilly,2011-06-18T23:32Z,"Are all the cards supposed to be unlocked? I've never played Magic before, but I thought that you had to unlock all the cards by winning matches. Is there any way to re-lock them lol? Kind of ruins single player."
,wizyy,2011-06-19T02:01Z,"Here's what I did to start a game without any unlocked cards:
From SKIDROW crack I copied just skidrow.ini and magic_2012.exe to game folder, and launched steam (smartsteam also worked).
After that, I started magic_2012.exe.
Hopefully all will be well and saved, I'm off to play now.
Happy gaming!"
,deviantdigi,2011-06-25T01:04Z,To play with card unlocked. You have to have steam running. Just copy the Magic.exe crack over to your dir. and start the game. Saves work for me.

,AranHei,2011-09-13T19:20Z,"hi i downloaded the game but it says that no AppID exists and then a black screen appears and says that steam is needed to load, but i downloaded steam afterwards and still gives the same problem :S any ideas pls?"
,iianakondaii,2011-12-21T03:32Z,"Hey ive got the same problem as Trixter, i installed the game, copied over the crack and now when i try open the game a get a error message that says : The program could not start because of a missing file called ""X3DAudio1_7.dll"" . Anyone know how to fix this?"
,pabolton,2011-12-24T09:07Z,"potentially has a virus, just installed this on another computer and it blue screened and crashed out. i also have recently had a trojan. scan and check this file carefully especially the direct x files which were the last thing installed . 

but as i said 'potentially' im unsure. 

apart from from that this is excellent. if anyone is having problems such as missing files it is probably the direct x which needs to be updated. just dont do it from the file included in this download for safety precautions , unless im wrong about the virus :)"
