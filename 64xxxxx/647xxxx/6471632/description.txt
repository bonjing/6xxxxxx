CD Rip at 320kbps

Thrill of a Lifetime is the second album by the rock band King Kobra, originally released in 1986 by Capitol Records. The album features "Iron Eagle (Never Say Die)", the theme song of the 1986 film Iron Eagle.
This is the CD reissue from Axe Killer Records released in 2000 as a numbered edition of 2,000 copies with slipcase and bonus track (weirdly NOT performed by King Kobra, rather the Jon Butcher Axis, which also appeared in the Iron Eagle film).
