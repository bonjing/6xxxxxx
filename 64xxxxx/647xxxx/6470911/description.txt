ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and
blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.

   \"Faith in the Last Day is to believe that mankind will be resurrected and recompensed for their deeds.

   

   It is to believe in everything that has come to us in the Book and the Sunnah concerning the description of that Day.


   Allah has vividly described that Day such as the following verse, â€œO mankind! Fear your Lord and be dutiful to Him! Verily, the earthquake of the Hour (of Judgment) is a terrible thing. The Day you shall see it, every nursing mother will forget her nursling and every pregnant one will drop her load, and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state. Yet they will not be drunk but severe will be the Torment of Allah.â€ [Soorah al-Hajj (22): 1-2]


   There are numerous descriptions of the Last Day in the Quran and the Sunnah that testify to the horror and terrible nature of this Day.


   Faith in the Last Day is not limited to believing in the Day that will be established after resurrection, as Shaikhul-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullah) writes in Aqeedah al-Wastiyyah, â€œFaith in the Last Day includes believing in everything that the Messenger has informed us about that will happen after death.â€
