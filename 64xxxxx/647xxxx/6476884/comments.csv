To config in game push one of the letter keys, I think it's ""g"" or ""t"" either way you'll know when you hit the right one.  ""enter"" or ""return"" is select, go figure.  ""right shift"" gives you coins, and you can change how many credits each coin amounts to in the settings menu.

I have not been able to change the key layout other than just switching between two presets. I want to change movement keys to ""wasd"" and attack buttons on my right hand but I don't think it's an option.  Oh well...

FYI, this is the same game as the i-app version ""SNK PLAYMORE KoF 2012,"" only better and free unlike their bullshit ripoff.  Gracias, Jorgeolla!"
