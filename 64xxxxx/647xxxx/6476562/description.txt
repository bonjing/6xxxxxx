After a rough cut of the Colin Tilley-directed 'Next 2 You' video leaked earlier this month, the official version of Justin Bieber and Chris Brown's collaboration is finally here.

"It's here," the 17-year-old pop star tweeted on Friday. "NEXT 2 YOU...from singing WITH YOU in my apartment to this...DREAM BIG. ENJOY!! thanks. #epic."

The cinematic music video clocks in at just over six minutes, and shows the two singers struggling to be reunited with their loved ones after an end-of-the-world event. While Justin is in a star-crossed relationship, Chris is madly in love and desperate to find his girl in the midst of the destruction.

Justin keeps having flashbacks to the good times with his girlfriend, and as the R&B stars sing their hearts out, their ladies cross paths in a shocking way. But don't worry Beliebers -- in the end love conquers all.

'Next 2 You' is featured on Chris' latest album, 'F.A.M.E.'
