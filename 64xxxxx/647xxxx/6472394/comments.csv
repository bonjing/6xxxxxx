,Naveedx,2011-08-13T05:17Z,the video is EXTREMELY stretched for me. anyone know why? using MPC home cinema
,Ps3MovieMe,2011-08-22T01:54Z,"You note on your videos this: ""PS3 and WDTV user you may need to rename to .MP4 instead of .M4V""

I've changed the file extensions to .mp4 but the Ps3 still won't see them over a wireless stream.  I play tons of movies this way but for some reason have had trouble with this particular file format showing up on the ps3 list with the others.  

Any suggestions?
