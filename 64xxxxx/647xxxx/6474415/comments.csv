very interesting! do they know of some impending doom that is about to happen?
I have sent the link to the BBC Radio2 in the UK.
I wonder if I will get a reply?
certainly food for though!!!"
,some-young-guy,2011-06-18T11:31Z,"The link was shared with me in conjunction with a story suggesting that a massive comet will be blowing through our solar system later this year.  Though the massive comet will likely miss a direct impact with Earth, the massive gravitational pulls it is predicted to inflict on us will likely alter life as we all know it if this is true."
,some-young-guy,2011-06-18T11:44Z,"Youtube search for ""Elenin Comet (Dwarf Star)"" for more on that, and between this and other vids, I'm sure you'll have more than ample leads to privately investigate if you so choose."
