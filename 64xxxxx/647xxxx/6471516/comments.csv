,soulmanice,2011-06-20T03:05Z,"Are these the uncensored versions? If you want the guaranteed uncensored original classics, you'll find them here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376566/Tom_and_Jerry_-_The_Complete_Uncensored_Hanna-Barbera_Classics"
,wissamitter,2011-06-20T14:19Z,"The torrent in the link above is only 126 files, so it's clearly not the complete collection anyway, and besides if this uploader ripped them from a DVD him/herself then this is the uncensored version. Bottom line is that this is the best Tom and Jerry torrent ever created on the internet!"

I was responding to soulmanice's comment about the link he posted as a comment in the following link (Which is not the full collection):

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5376566/Tom_and_Jerry_-_The_Complete_Uncensored_Hanna-Barbera_Classics

This torrent on the other hand that we are writing comments on it's page is all 161 episodes of course as it can clearly be seen in the file description :) So everyone should download this torrent since it's the best! Enjoy Tom and Jerry forever."
,finecrab,2011-06-23T07:30Z,"@wissamitte
I just finished  downloading all episodes of this torrent.When I open this torrent it shows 161 file.I downloaded all 161  videos.Everything is good."
,wissamitter,2011-06-23T12:28Z,"@finecrab
Told you this ""Tom and Jerry - Complete 161 Classic Episodes (DVD-Rip) High Qua"" was the best ;)"
,soulmanice,2011-06-25T18:51Z,"Wissamitter is wrong. This torrent is ripped from the 'Classic Collection' DVDs, which contain many edits and other censorship. My torrent (linked in my previous comment) has only 126 episodes because it focuses exclusively on the Hanna-Barbera period 1939-1957. So for that period, if you want all the original uncut content, my torrent is the best. This one is fine for the stuff made after that -- there was never any censorship done after the early 50s anyway."
,soulmanice,2011-06-25T18:55Z,I meant: There were never any censorship issues with the episodes made after the early 50s.
,soulmanice,2011-06-25T18:57Z,I have confirmed that the episodes in this torrent are edited. Not the fault of the uploader of course - they're like that on the DVDs.
,wissamitter,2011-06-27T07:54Z,"Quality is top notch, I don't see why some people would rate quality down. If you have downloaded this torrent please leave comments about the quality so that other downloaders know what's happening."
,Timyoni,2011-07-14T04:53Z,"Have you leechers noticed that this is a 27.45GB torrent? Huh, Have you?

Stop the fucking bullshit and give something back! SEED - WHILE AND AFTER you are at it!! I have already uploaded twice my download and I'm at an amazing 5% of the torrent  o.O !!!

WTF is wrong with you people?! Haven't you learned anything from the P2P community yet !? This is a TWO way lane. You get some and then you should give some away too! Stop fucking hitting and running away when your download completes! The uploader cannot seed this thing along for everyone else to hit and run like a bunch of motherfuckers are doing! Fuck you all!

Please, accept my apologies for my language. There is really no other way to express such dissatisfaction for these people. Peace.
