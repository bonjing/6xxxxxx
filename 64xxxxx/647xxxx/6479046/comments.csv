,mma4me,2011-06-20T08:26Z,Thanks again. Will seed as usual. Just curious how many more of these jems shall we expect if everything goes well?
[V],Nepotu,2011-06-20T15:55Z,"You're welcome! If everything goess well I intent to up nearly 200 games of the NBA finals from 80s, 90s, 00s. All I can find. But it takes very long time. One year or more."
,mma4me,2011-06-20T16:26Z,"That would be awesome, I will help seed whatever I download. The finals are great, my only request would be any classic Bird, Jordan or Sir Charles games. I'm in Australia so I missed out on pretty much all of them so any of them would be greatly appreciated. Again, love your work, I appreciate whatever NBA you upload and I will share it with others.  "
[V],Nepotu,2011-06-21T04:13Z,"All my greatest respect for you mma4me for your seeding. If God give us health we will arrive at those games that you like. Thank you to be by my side helping me with the seed, because are lots of people who download and run. They don't think that all the people will do that these sites like TPB will disappear. Respect, Australia!"
