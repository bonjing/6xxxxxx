Sierra Nevada Mountains, 1887: William Drayton, once a crack sharpshooter in the Civil War, has lost his wife and home. He has ascended to the high country, wanting never to be heard from again. But someone is trying to find him -- a long-lost daughter, Elizabeth, whom Drayton thought had died long before. Meanwhile, banker-turned-robber baron Horace Scarsdale has mustered an army of cutthroats and guns for hire to help him build his railroad empire. When Drayton returns to â€œcivilizationâ€ with his daughter and friends, he decided to make a stand against Scarsdale, his former employer. Against impossible odds, he faces down the vicious band of raiders that Scarsdale calls â€œThe Company Men.â€
