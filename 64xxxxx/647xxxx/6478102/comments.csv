Really well I hope, with sunshine, cold beer and good music to accompany you, just as I have (now). Again, thank you, and have a great summer!"
,The Real Chicken,2011-06-28T10:21Z,"Hahaha, I guess not! I myself have a few weeks left but they will not be spent on the beach, but on a ""hobby"". Have been landscaping my garden (that means shovelling dirt), and am now making my house beautiful (that means scraping paint from a very tall ladder). Ah yes, I am also pissing my neighbours off, as they seem to have very little understanding of the pleasures of the music from our digital age...   ;-)"

,The Real Chicken,2011-07-05T10:26Z,"""Ernst with better taste in music"".... Hahahahahaha, that really cracked me up!

On a different note; I heard about Arvika, sorry man. You had tickets? It's a real sad time if they are crashing for good. I wasn't going this year because of my work, but I really wanted to."
