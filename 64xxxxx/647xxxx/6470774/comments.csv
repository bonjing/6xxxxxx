,ToolGod,2011-06-23T16:57Z,I wasn't impressed with it but it's growing on me :P
,mmx69,2011-07-14T03:04Z,"Hey ToolGod, relax. Encase you haven't noticed, this isn't a finished copy of the song. You can tell it's really rough around the edges, sounds like shit at high volumes and the vocals TOTALLY haven't been mastered. "
,mmx69,2011-07-14T03:06Z,"Sorry ToolGod, re-read my comment. I sounded rude. I just meant have faith in Machine Head. They will impress. "
,ToolGod,2011-07-21T20:15Z,"No sorry needed :)) It's one of the final copies, there is this version and another on the Album apparently .. Not so much a demo just one is mixed by someone else - I think, can't confirm though it's just what I read :))"
,xxmohxx,2011-08-02T23:09Z,I think it's their best work yet!
