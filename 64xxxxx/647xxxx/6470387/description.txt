[DESCRIPTION.]:
A team of movers must transport a fleet of bespoke racing
yachts worth 8million 6,500km from the Caribbean island of
Guadeloupe to France.

The huge yachts race across the rough Atlantic Ocean to the
Caribbean, in one of the most extreme sailing challenges in
the world, the Route Du Rhum. Having crossed the finish line
in one piece, some skippers decide its too risky to sail their
yachts back. So they recruit a team of marine engineers to
transport the fleet back to France.

Its a huge challenge. The move crew decides to charter a
colossal 30,000 tonne cargo ship for the job. But loading the
delicate 50ft trimarans and monohull yachts onto the ships
deck is fraught with danger. Its an incredibly tight squeeze
to
fit all the yachts on board without damaging them. Storms
delay the ships journey and tempers flair when the loading
runs behind schedule.

Will the team get everything on board before the ship raises
anchor?
