Comment: This makes me think of the masonic death-ritual they performed against Lady Di. They\'ve planted an eternal flame too at the location where she was killed - just what they did at JFK\'s burial place and on top of the masonic pillar at Dealey Plaza. That\'s their wicked sense of humor. The eternal flame represents Lucifer\'s light throning on their victim. It means: \"Hereby the masonic elite proudly declares that JFK was successfully killed by Lucifer\". I can\'t get rid of the ominous feeling that it was the very same group who also murdered Jesus Christ 2000 years ago.
