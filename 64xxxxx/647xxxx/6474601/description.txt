ReleaseNotes:

George HarrisonÃ†s first-ever career-spanning solo hits collection, Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison. Special packaging includes a 28-page booklet featuring previously unseen and rare photos, and newly-written liner notes by Warren Zanes. The collectionÃ†s 19 tracks have been digitally remastered by Giles Martin at EMIÃ†s Abbey Road Studios. Ã´Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison is a gathering of material that takes us far into the territory that was
ultimately a place unique to George Harrison,"writes Warren Zanes in his liner notes essay for the new collection.

This collection is the first to span HarrisonÃ†s entire solo recording career, including the #1 Billboard Pop singles "My Sweet Lord," Ã´Isn't It A Pity," "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace On Earth)," and "Got My Mind Set On You." Let It Roll also features live recordings of three timeless Harrison-penned Beatles songs, "Something," "While My Guitar Gently Weeps," and "Here Comes The Sun," from his 1971 all-star Concert For Bangladesh benefit at Madison Square
Garden.

"The keyhole into the world of George Harrison is the music itself. Yet his songs and the accomplishments for which heÃ†s remembered are inextricably bound and those accomplishments are, without question, eclectic in scope," Zanes writes.

George Harrison is a twice-inducted member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a solo artist and as a member of The Beatles, and an 11-time Grammy Award winner for his recordings with The Beatles, Traveling Wilburys, and as a solo artist.
