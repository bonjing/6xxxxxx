[T],adnan1102,2011-06-15T14:50Z,"Follow these:
1) Install tuneup.
2) extract the crack.rar file with winrar.
3) copy all the files from the crack folder and paste them into the installed tuneup folder (by default it is C:\Program Files\TuneUp Utilities 2011) ...u will get a warning ...click overwrite the files.(it is necessary that u get this warning)
4) open the registration.reg file and import it into the registry.."

,clubkilla,2011-06-25T16:05Z,"Just a question for certainty, hope someone can answer: i already have installed TU 2010 and did loads of tweaks with it. Can I install this 2011 version over my old 2010 version or do I first have to uninstall the 2010 version? And what about my tweaks like self-made icon-pack - other boot and login screen etc.....  all gone after uninstalling 2010 I guess? ......"
,iAmOptimistic,2011-06-25T17:41Z,"Installed and activated correctly and worked fine after a restart. 

@clubkilla

I had a previous version which i uninstalled and then installed this one and my settings/tweaks were all saved.

Keep up the good work adnan1102, will seed 200%."
