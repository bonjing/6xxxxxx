,pirateradiorocks2,2012-03-08T01:44Z,"I heard that the US Govt. was going to offer a $10,000 tax free bounty for every illegal man, woman and anchor child turned in. That it was only available to 'real' citizens and was going to run $330,000,000,000 (that's $330 Billion) But, what got me was the fact that it would cost less to pay out the bounties on all 33,000,000 illegals than it would to support them on Federal, State benefits/monies for 3 months. That it would take less than 1 year to do so was just amazing! Seems this same info was made available in an internal DHS study in 2010, but the study was taken off the web share point docs after only a couple hours. So, if it is feasible, cost efficient and would open up a crap load of jobs to Americans, why won't the US Govt. Do it?"
