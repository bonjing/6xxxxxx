Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era. Our goal is to disseminate such works of art to the widest audience possible through the channels provided by P2P technology.

The Freakyflicks collection is limited to those films that have played an exceptional role in the history of cinema and its progression in becoming a great art. Films that are usually described as classic, cult, arthouse and avant-garde.

If you have films that fit this description feel free to share them and participate in our community. All you need do is include this tag in your upload and join us at the forum to announce your release.

'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE"" 

I believe that most of us here can agree that this USSC effort was begun by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. If you strip away those people and their agendas you are left with only one viable  product from the USFA to date...Proposal 1...and a lot of enthusiasm and passion. I believe we all know how hard it is to get groups and individuals to take an interest and provide feedback on issues even of area wide importance, much less national or world wide, so if this Proposal 1 can be pitched to groups in such a way as to generate in any degree the type of involvement in our Fellowship that we have all seen lacking, that can only be a good thing. It seems likely that Proposals 2 and 3 will fall by the wayside and then any implementation of a national entity will be done through  the established service structure which cuts those with agendas out."
