Director: Konrad Niewolski

summary:

Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector,
a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case.
The story is told on two planes. The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film.
In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character.
Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind,
making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion? Where is the borderline
between the real world and our perception of it? What makes suffering meaningful and what is really important
in one's life"?
