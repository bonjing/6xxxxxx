His character flaws are in many ways not of his own making, and there are times when he does show a glimmer of a 'heart.' I really enjoyed the recent crossover with X-23, and was left feeling more interaction between the two could benefit both of them in their search for what it means to be 'human.' Thx again for keeping up the great work! We ALL APPRECIATE IT!!!"
