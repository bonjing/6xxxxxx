,Bateman82,2011-06-24T12:29Z,I can confirm that the update you get when you first run the game does not update the dash or anything like that. The game isn't as good as the two other fear games in my opinion though. Its a shame Monolith(who did the first games) isn't involved in this game. It feels like a bad rip off of the two first games.
,elxhn,2011-06-24T21:26Z,i burn d game but i cant play it bcause a died b4 anything starts i cant even pick up the earpeace it dies b4 that and in multiplayer cant see the oponents just a flying red flame does i need an update or what?

,dominat3,2011-07-01T23:07Z,I did a manual hash check on this and it always stops at 99.8 on the ISO not the DVD? Maybe this as somethin to do with all of us having problems.

,djnicolo,2011-07-24T23:00Z,im new to the xbox thing is there a speical kind of disk i need to burn it on
,Robolew,2011-07-26T05:36Z,"@djnicolo
You need to flash your xbox 360 disk drive. It's a relatively easy job, no soldering should be needed, though you do need a connectivity kit, just google it. But it's not as simple as just downloading, and there is a risk of a console ban. It shouldn't be a problem if you keep updating your drive though."
,RonFly,2011-08-03T16:43Z,"@ dominat3  you're right!!! I have the same problem, soon as the first cut scene ends I don't see anything I just see a black screen and hear the lady on the radio and it says mission failed... I have downloaded this game 2x and ran this game 2x thru abgx and it still doesn not work correctly.... Starting to believe everybody else is telling lies... i've played a part of the multiplayer but not for long... I want the solo campaign!!! Waist of 2 dual layers!!!!"

You can use local classified's and find a local xbox repair shope or person, most of them do flash upgrades. I have used the same guy for Ring of Death, Cleaning and Flash upgrades."
