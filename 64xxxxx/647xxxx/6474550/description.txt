    A nerdy high school super whiz experiments with a chemical which will    
    transform his guinea pig "Mr. Mumps" from a gentle pet into a            
    ravenous monster. In a fit of rage against his tormentors at the high    
    school, Vernon Potts (Pat Cardi) goes on a killing spree, eliminating    
    all of those who ever picked on him - the Gym Coach, the School Jock,    
    The Creepy Janitor (Mr. Griggs) & his hated teacher, Ms. Grindstaff.     
    In the end he gets the jock's girlfriend for himself but his             
    happiness is short-lived as the potion turns him into a monster          
    hunted by the towns lame police Lieutenant - Bosman.
