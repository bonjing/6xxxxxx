SUMMARY:
Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) reunite for the 
comedy adventure Paul as two sci-fi geeks whose pilgrimage takes them to 
America's UFO heartland. While there, they accidentally meet an alien who 
brings them on an insane road trip that alters their universe forever. 
For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) has 
been hanging out at a top-secret military base. When he discovers he's 
been taken prisoner, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the 
compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town-a rented RV containing 
Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost). Chased by 
federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they 
accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to 
return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle to help, one 
little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to 
intergalactic heroes...
