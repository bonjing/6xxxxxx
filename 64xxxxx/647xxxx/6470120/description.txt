Passion is a 1982 film by Jean-Luc Godard, and the second feature film made during his return to relatively mainstream filmmaking in the 1980s, sometimes referred to as the Second Wave. As with all films Godard made during this period, the "mainstream" refers more to their budget, casting and distribution than to their content, which builds on the radical aesthetic of his post-New Wave forays into video and essay filmmaking.
