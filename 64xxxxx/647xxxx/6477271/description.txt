Special hour-long episode of the gardening programme. Now that the threat of frost has disappeared and the ground is warm, Monty Don plants out his dahlias, tends his roses and offers tips on extending the life of the vegetable garden at Longmeadow.

Monty then teams up with Carol Klein, Joe Swift and Rachel de Thame at Gardeners' World Live, where they view some spectacular show gardens and top class plants, and take part in a bring and buy plant sale.
