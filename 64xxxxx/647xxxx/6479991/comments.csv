I thought ""there's no way in hell a 600MB rip at 720p will look good"" up until I loaded this video up on my 24"" widescreen monitor. 

Well fuck me sideways, it actually looks better than shitty 720x680 res rips out there on big monitor. Acceptable level of quality for bigger wider screens. Nicely done.

You can also make it a 700 or 750MB rip, the size of old CD's and increase the video bitrate but for the love of god don't increase the file size just to make it a 5.1 audio release. With low size videos a 5.1 sound is the last thing most of us want. Keep the size at 600MB and video the same if you must.

Err.. anyways, good rip, going to download all other Scorp releases now. :P"
