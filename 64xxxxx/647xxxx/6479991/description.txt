[ENCODER'S NOTE]:...............[ RC - Blu-ray Discs use a a simpler region-code system with only 3 regions, labeled A, B, and C. 
- Region A includes most North, Central and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus the Republic of China (Taiwan), Hong Kong, Japan and Korea 
- Region B includes most European, African and southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand. 
- Region C contains the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as the People's Republic of China and Russia. 

Although small sized re encoding is a flawed concept but still we always strive very very hard to preserve MAXIMUM DETAILS within our rips. Hope you enjoy them as much as we enjoy working on em :)
