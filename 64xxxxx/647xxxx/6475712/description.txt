For those installing DP4 on VMware Fusion, you may get an error message when installing iCloud Beta 2: "iCloud can't be installed on this disk. An error occurred evaluating JavaScript for this package." I've created a new installer which allows iCloud B2 to work on DP4 in a VMWare virtual machine.

[WARNING] This installer bypasses the volume check allowing iCloud Beta 2 to be installed on Lion DP4 running as a virtual machine in VMWare Fusion 3. Please take a snapshot before installing. Do not use this installer for any other configuration.

For notes on how to get Lion DP4 running in VMWare Fusion 3, see:
