A small picturesque town at the turn of the century. The traditional morals of the townspeople are shaken when they find out that the school teacher FranzÃ©n published his poetry anonymously many years ago. At the same time he acknowledges his love affair with a waitress at the city hotel, Fanny. What is most upsetting is the fact that Fanny has a grownup daughter, Anna, with no known father. Could their poet teacher be the father although they are not married?
