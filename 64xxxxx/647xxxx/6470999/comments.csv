,telesam,2011-07-08T08:31Z,And why is there an Airplane folder with pictures of aiplanes and when folder is deleted Windows goes nuts and doesn't work?
,mx5-kevin,2011-07-08T18:51Z,"Windows XP SP3, Firefox works perfectly. You May Not Immediately hide the ip has occurred 
some times (restart firefox, or ip Changing this fixed the momentary problem). But it works 
perfectly.The program  having extra user agent and referrer hiding function and if you need a program downloading (the premium sites 1 download problem) to hide your ip some ip are not slow (90Kb/s my latest download speed). The airplains folder it  not part of the program.If something does not work then something is not compatible with the program, or you  use it wrong .1. Use the program  2. close the pogram  3.reset time.The program working theoretically forewer (lifetime) and the proxies are not slow."

,dashingguyof2k,2011-08-18T15:48Z,tell me something i want to use it when i browse ebay.com so any idea for how much time should i set that my ip resets?! i mean can ebay see this way tht i am changing many ips and suspend my account so or i just change a ip and set a long time that the software changes my other ip so i dont get caught?
,mx5-kevin,2011-08-19T18:57Z,"Yes the A Bay see all you IP adress (The changed IP) 
changed IP: Your Compjuter>Proxy Server>E Bay Ebay see the proxy server ip

Real IP:Your Compjuter>E Bay Ebay see your real ip.

Use google how to work a proxy.

Proxy test:http://ipcim.com/en/

Ebay see:your IP operating system,Browser,and how to go theare (search name like you type browser E bay Whath you use Google,bing,)Always Delete your cookies!
The proxy server sees the same about you through it, plus everything you do when you use it but only if You use the proxy server.Private network, but it's so much better than the public servers because public servers it is very observed,slow,and Storming."
