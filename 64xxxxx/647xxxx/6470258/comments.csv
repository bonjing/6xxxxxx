,Millor1,2012-02-28T10:08Z,"Apparently cannot be emulated. 

It does nothing but spam ""SPR MFIFO Write outside MFIFO area"" in the console and leave the screen black, on the official PCSX2 site it says the game is playable with version 0.9.9 of PCX2, but there is no 0.9.9 version of PCSX2 so that doesn't make any sense.

Don't bother unless your getting for PS2."
