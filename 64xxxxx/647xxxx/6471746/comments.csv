Game information
=================

Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set  in  a  world
war III scenario. During the 7 campaigns the player has to fly  and  fight
through over 48 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose  between
different aircrafts, each with different strengths and  weaknesses.  Within
the  missions  the  player  gets  different  objectives  like  patrolling,
sneaking, hit & run, bombing and escorting.  Objectives  are  presented  as
dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player  can
upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes  easier,  have
more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose
between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the
game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to  control
the  aircraft.  Beside  the  campaign  the  game  also  features  several
multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players
