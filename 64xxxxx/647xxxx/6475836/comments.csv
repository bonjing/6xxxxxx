Could you tell me what the point is of all those obviously fake torrents that blight this site every morning. What do they hope to achieve??? 

As you can tell I am a noob but even I am not dumb enough to fall for the bullshit seeders/leechers and the fact that the same  uploader just happens to have DVD quality versions of the 10 most popular films of the moment. Please help I'm confused!!!"
