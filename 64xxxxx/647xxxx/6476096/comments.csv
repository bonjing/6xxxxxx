,yuu153,2011-06-17T20:23Z,"notforlonger:

""Any lossy compressed game ,generally packed in an installer that has been released by the scene (pirate groups). The main aim is to reduce size with not much loss of quality.
the followings are generally compressed (lossy/lossless)
textures
sound
videos
Multi language support is stripped to reduce size
similar to full rips but with installers, as with ripped games installation takes more time due to decompression/unpacking."""
,notforlonger,2011-06-18T08:07Z,so nothing is reduced? just that they are compressed to smaller size? but everything will be as normal once it is installed?
,yuu153,2011-06-18T10:17Z,"As far as I'm aware yes - I didn't create the pack, though - this comes straight from the source minus the archive packaging over at wbb. I installed it a couple days ago once I finished the download, and I haven't noticed anything missing."
,yuu153,2011-06-18T10:21Z,"Actually, here's a link to the packing group - they're fairly well known on wbb and have their own FAQ for the games they do.

*Tried to post the link, got a 'database error' issue - guess the system thinks it's spam. Search for this thread over at w-bb: ""Custom Repacks - By Black_Box Team- Duke Nukem Forever [ GB]"""
,AMoveFan,2011-06-21T21:42Z,The game starts just fine until u have to make Duke urinate then there is a black screen and it stays this way forever can someone help me out with why the screen stays black ?
,vanjhelion,2011-07-22T03:58Z,"I had this and it seems its not saving, I tried to look for  save game folders but its always empty after I exit the game. I had been playing for an hour then I exit and to my surprise when I came back to play its in the beginning again."
,vanjhelion,2011-07-23T10:13Z,"Opps, just run as admin and the continue campaign will appear."
