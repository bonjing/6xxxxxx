Duke Nukem Forever is an action first-person shooter video game for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 that was developed by 3D Realms and finished by Gearbox Software. It is a sequel to the 1996 game Duke Nukem 3D, as part of the long-running Duke Nukem video game series.

Intended to be groundbreaking, Duke Nukem Forever became infamous in the video game industry and its name became synonymous with vaporware due to its severely-protracted development schedule; the game had been in development since 1996. Upon its release in June 2011, Duke Nukem Forever received predominantly negative reviews from critics.
