,rindidumplin,2011-06-21T18:20Z,"I was wondering if the poster, or Skywatch (who it seems to have worked for) has any clearer instructions. Any help would be most useful, thanks."
,jez1961,2011-06-22T16:39Z,"Thanks alot. This works good. The patcher is a bit tricky. After installing, copy the patcher to Sony program files and click. It then has to find various files to patch. Whilst doing a search of these files keep your eye ion the search window and you'll see there which file it is searching.  There is one for vegas, a dll, one for architect, and one for the soundforge audio stuff. If you havent installed soundforge etc ignore that bit. Hope that helps. Rest assured it definitely works, though!"
,Konan2002,2011-06-28T12:24Z,"for the crack to run for a windows vista/7 64bit make sure you run the file with the extension ""/startupworkdir C:\Program Files (x86)\Sony"" after the .exe..... Make sure you have the administrator rights enabled on the folders for the user you are logged in as"
,dan1237,2011-07-12T13:57Z,WTF i don`t understand how to crack it. I do it right how it is writed in instruction but nothing happens.
,bravepills,2011-08-04T00:00Z,"Ok, I had trouble with the patcher at first, but I figured it out.

1. Install the program 

2. Copy the patch into the sony folder (in programs)

3.  This is the important bit - you must right click and 'run as administrator', then the crack will open, click a 'head' and your all done.

If you don't run as admin the crack will still run and still appear to do its thing, but it will not crack it."

,bondoMaga,2011-08-28T02:40Z,"OK there are three versions of the same .rar here on the bay (and hey would someone tell me why these idiots still upload .rar files?) but this version is the ONLY one with the patch.

Thanx all for the helpful notes."

,wvyno,2012-03-25T06:20Z,"Even aside from the fact that they are in Spanish, these instructions make no sense and you can't tell which is the patch and which is the setup file. "
