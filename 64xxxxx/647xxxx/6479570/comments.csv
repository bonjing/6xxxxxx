[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-19T16:04Z,"hey you big mouth of a dick, i am seeding it as much as i possibly can, so why dont you just fucking shut your big mouth then"
,motley666,2011-06-19T16:53Z,"I laughed by both your comments guys, thanks!"
,bry68,2011-06-19T18:46Z,seed pls stuck on 66%
[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-19T20:38Z,"additional, added 3 more seeders locally, so there is a total of 4 seeders right now seeding 24/7, figured that would entertain someone Montly, hence why i said it. But those who say there are NO seeders, are full of it, im seeding like 100 some torrents across 9 machines right now, I always look up the names of the haters, and oh look yet another non submitter. So you came here and leeched, belly ached about the seeders, gave nothing back.We make fun of you people that do that actually."
,bry68,2011-06-19T23:44Z,plenty of seeds now thx ill seed once also
[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-20T00:32Z,"Thanks bry68 much appreciated, hate them no contributing leechers that come in an whine when the torrents like 5 mins old expecting several thousand seeders on it. Kinda hard to do, I'm only one person. Altho I do have 9 machines lan and mapped networked drive here, i max my upload (1 mbs by the way) seeding stuff via torrent. This was one cd out of my cd collection i decided to go thru and see if anything old and retro i had would be wanted. Apparently this game was wanted."
