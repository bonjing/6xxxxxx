The audio is out of sync. It is close to seven seconds ahead. How do I fix this?"
,Bolle420,2011-06-18T13:00Z,You use VLC and the J and K buttons.

Thanks. I did try that. It works up to two seconds only on VLC. Am I the only one with this problem?"

Using MKVMerge remux it...Delay the Audio by  7110ms and it is fixed. or use VLC (j,k)
