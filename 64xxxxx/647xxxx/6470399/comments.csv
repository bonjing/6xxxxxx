[T],MelloYello,2011-06-18T05:23Z,@shiva1791-  Yeah this is the same source as the 350MB size (check info).  I just re-encoded it smaller.  Pirate Bay was down so I went to EZTV's site and downloaded and re-encoded it.  So when TPB got fixed I had it ready to seed as I uploaded it on KickAssTorrents already.  :)
