Pretty Little Liars  S02E01

It's Alive

With Ian's body missing and the entire town of Rosewood questioning what exactly happened the night before at the church, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer have a lot of explaining to do. But with the police and their parents not quite sure what to believe, the girls' parents rally together to try and help the four out with the assistance of a therapist. Now being forced to talk out their problems, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer feel more alone than ever. Even with a reassurance that everything they discuss won't leave the therapist's office, is this the person the Liars can finally tell about "A?"
