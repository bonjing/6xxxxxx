,michaelizationable,2011-06-22T18:40Z,"i've downloaded, click to play but it says i need to insert CD.

I have a macbook air, so that's not an option.

I am looking for a No CD patch, does anyone know where i can find this? If you have it, can you create a torrent for it? I would really like to get this working. the No CD crack is all i need.

If you know where to find one, post here the link and type a step-by-step process as how to make changes necessary to the game file.

Thx."
,XX107,2011-06-24T20:01Z,"Downloaded it and tried to follow instructions but the 'crack' file to overwrite the original doesn't overwrite. It won't be placed into the same folder even. 

Until this is fixed, not a good torrent at all"
