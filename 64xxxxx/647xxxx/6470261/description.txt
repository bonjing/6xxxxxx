Show Information

The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, based on the best-selling book by
Kate Summerscale, is about an infamous murder in a Victorian country house.

The two-hour drama stars Paddy Considine (The Bourne Ultimatum, Hot Fuzz)
in the lead role of Inspector Jonathan Whicher alongside BAFTA award
winner Peter Capaldi (Torchwood, The Thick of It), Emma Fielding
(Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The Children) and Alexandra Roach
(Being Human, The IT Crowd, Candy Cabs).

It is a summer's night in 1860. In an elegant detached Georgian house in
the village of Road, Wiltshire, all is quiet. Behind shuttered windows the
Kent family lies sound asleep. At some point after midnight a dog barks.

The family wakes the next morning to a horrific discovery: an unimaginably
gruesome murder has taken place in their home. The household reverberates with
shock, not least because the guilty party is almost certainly still among them.

Jack Whicher of Scotland Yard, the most celebrated detective of his day, is
sent to investigate the murder at Road Hill House. With only an inept local
police to help him and no material evidence, he faces an unenviable task:
to solve a case in which the grieving family are the suspects...
