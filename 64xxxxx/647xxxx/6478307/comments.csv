But the movie itself was just a disaster. It included dancing ghosts, a darth maul-looking spider demon, and a gas mask being used to talk to spirits......Need I say more? It was really THAT bad, im not exaggerating. The only entertainment i got was laughing at how stupid it was.

It's hilarious that you throw around racist ignorant statements such as you've made and yet accuse ANYTHING or ANYONE of being ""retarded"".  And how would one of the most difficult languages to learn on Earth be its least intelligent?  You're a fucking moron.  Die and don't breed so we can improve the human population just that little bit."

Did you honestly just insult someone, Speaking in ENGLISH about them telling others to learn it AND call it retarded? Were you thrown out of a fucking tree onto your head and then ran over? Next time you through racist insults around, Try to sound smarter than the person your insulting or you just look like a dumbass, But I think you figured that one out. "

Keep your movie ratings to yourselves.

,PPierce34,2011-07-18T18:26Z,"Guys, the hate has gone too far. Funny how a couple people hate on something and everyone else runs with it because they don't want to be wrong. This is basically an evolution of Paranormal Activity (which belongs to the Found Footage genre) into a true horror movie. If you didn't like Paranormal Activity and its sequel, why are you here? I for one think it's good and creepy as hell. All the haters, watch it alone in the dark at 2AM and get back to me."

,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-07-22T20:34Z,"Wow you guys are to much, I'm sorry.

I downloaded this torrent I didn't receive a letter from my ISP, do you know why? Hmm, perhaps because there's a program out there that's called Peerblock. 

I've been downloading movies for over 6 YEARS, and I've never been caught nor did I get any emails from my ISP. 


I already watched this movie with a friend of mine in DVD rip and I have to say, It's scary as fuck and It's a mindfuck at the end. 

I got this copy for my dad if you wonder why I downloaded the same movie x2 times.

Anyways, enough said. 

A8.5
V8.5
M 8.0

The reason why I can't give this movie a higher rating in the Audio & Video is because It's not real HD, as in the 9~10GB versions out there.

Thanks for the upload. "

Going to download it and see what it's like. Judging from the plot it really sounds like it would be a great movie!"
