Mayer Hawthorne

Mayer Hawthorne was born in Ann Arbor, MI, listening on the car radio to the rich soul music coming out of the Motor City. He counts Isaac Hayes, Leroy Hutson, Mike Terry and Barry White among his influences, but draws the most inspiration from Smokey Robinson, Curtis Mayfield and the legendary Motown songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, which he shares with Daryl. After several critically acclaimed releases for the independent Stones Throw label, Hawthorne signed with Universal Republic for his upcoming new album, How Do You Do, and is currently on tour with Bruno Mars and Janelle MonÃ¡e. "I'm all about fun, and Live from Darylâ€™s House was one of the most fun things I've ever done,â€ enthused Hawthorne. â€œI want to be there every month."
