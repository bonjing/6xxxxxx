Now I can use it on my Windows 7 computer, don't need to buy a new scanner. Really appreciate it. More power to your other great uploads!!"

,bokva,2011-07-28T10:42Z,"Works great on my friend's Canon CanoScan LIDE 20 on Windows 7 64-bit! For two days I was trying to force Canon win7 drivers to work on Win7 64-bit and nothing. Now it's ok with VueScan ($39.95). AVG antivirus goes nuts when I started crack, but it's false alarm as it identifies it as Generic bla bla bla trojan. -=>Thanks, Anacondaz!!"
