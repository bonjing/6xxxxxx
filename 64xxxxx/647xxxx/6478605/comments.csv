I don't know what's wrong... It may be a Pirate Bay issue. The magnet link appears to work (if your software is set up to accept magnet links. Utorrent does), just not the direct torrent download...

TPB system won't even let me edit at the moment, so can't look and change anything. 

May have to re-upload if it continues to be a problem...

Thanks for letting me know watty64!"

Please use the ""Magnet Link""..."
,watty64,2011-06-19T04:14Z,"Yea, you're right about the Magnet Link. Never used it before. Thanks for the heads up Plarsugo. Will help seed for ages."
