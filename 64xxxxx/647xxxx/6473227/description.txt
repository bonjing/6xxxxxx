         Gypsy Creek's # 1 cop, Charles Gravytrain        
         believes in three things: Truth, Justice, and    
         slapping the no good crook Jimmy Fish Eye's in   
         the slammer for life! And with the help of his   
         foxy new partner, big city cop Miss Uma Booma,   
         he may do just that. But in a town that has      
         more stinky secrets and slippery surprises       
         than a tin of rotten sardines the only           
         question remains...Where's the Fish?!
