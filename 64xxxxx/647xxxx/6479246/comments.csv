,Aikousha,2012-02-21T09:21Z,"After seeing the Zappa tape masters library, I was hoping that the estate would put out a box set (or series of boxes) that comprised the entire works of Zappa that were his.  Instead, nothing even close has been available.  Not even box sets of just the released albums has been seen.
So, until such a creature appears, all my old vinyl (23 of the most common albums), several very old VHS tapes of his TV appearances, AND THIS COLLECTION!!!, will do.

Thanks so much for making this available!
Bless you, and all that helped.
