[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-19T05:11Z,this movie is weird.
,now192002,2011-06-19T05:29Z,"@John Depp, nobody actually knows at this point. According to the director there were 18 minutes ""mostly action"" that was taken out because it was deemed to violent for a PG-13 rating. I've also heard rumors about some sensual scenes between the girls. "
,nittany,2011-06-19T11:11Z,I'll wait until the extended version is released so I can witness this weird ass movie in full.

[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-19T16:51Z,"i'm looking for a good idx/sub vobsub ripper. subrip doesn't work for these. avidemux works, but its not nearly as good, basically sucks, but works.

subrip should work i would think, but it doesn't read them properly. If anyone can point me to a good one that would be appreciate because as of late all of the subs are idx/sub and converting with avidemux and then fixing all of its errors is very time consuming."
[V],aoloffline,2011-06-19T20:44Z,"HR,i sometimes rip subtitles myself ,but are the ones from blu ray,and ""suprip 1.16""works good..

Still didd 2-3 times idx/sub with Subtitle Edit 3.1.Has image compare or tesseract method.Tesseract is very fast,but errors remain as with ""subrip""...Usully the errors are ""-"" , ""_"", ""L've"" instead of ""I've"" ..for this type of situations text compare programs are useful..I recommand  TextCrawler is freeware and solves them in an instant"
,MassHysteria1,2011-06-19T21:13Z,seed please estimated download time is one day and i dont think my attention span is high enough for that :D
[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-19T21:36Z,"http://www.nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit

i'll give it a go as ripping with the program i was using for this style was just a waste of my time.  let you know my success.

subrip however is pretty great for dvd complete vob dumps.  its ocr only."

If you want to download at your full ISP speed, then switch to usenet, but you have to pay a small amount each month if you go unlimited, but it's totally worth it.  I download at 1.5MB/sec so just over 5GB's a hour.

No more torrents for me, I only come to piratebay now so I can see what new releases are available.  I scan the top 100 list for ""High res Movies"" and then download whatever I want from usenet.

Too many people getting sued using torrents these days, 20k people got sued downloading ""The Expendables.""  And thousands of others got sued for other movies like the hurt locker and farcry.  You can't get sued using usenet.

Check out this post on usenet, has links to all the great guides on how to do it:
