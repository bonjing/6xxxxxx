"Keep on Truckin'"

When Judd (Greg Grunberg) and his 
colleague Dan (Steve Talley) decide to 
crash a party, they get more than they 
bargained for when it becomes apparent 
that the cute host (Laura Prepon, "That 
70s Show") is having the party to say 
"goodbye" to her breast before a 
mastectomy. Meanwhile, Ricky (Donald 
Faison, "Scrubs") has developed a unique 
method for avoiding post-date 
responsibilities - secretly deleting his 
number from his date's cell phones before 
slipping out the door. His system works 
beautifully until he meets Angie (Joy 
Bryant, "Parenthood"), an intriguing woman 
with a disappearing act of her own. Also, 
Annie (Becki Newton) gets set up on a date 
with Matt (Matt Winston, "Six Feet 
Under"), who has a creepy interest in her 
pregnancy, but it's another Matt (Matt 
Long, "The Deep End") who comes to her 
rescue and helps her maneuver an escape.
