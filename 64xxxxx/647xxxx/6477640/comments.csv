If you wish to pirate HL1, Google Search for a how to; ""sven coop non-steam"". I won't offer any assistance with it as I don't use non-Steam (it's not that expensive anyways, and you lose a lot of co-op servers if you're not using the official game...)

Good luck, have fun!"

With that comment you made this torrent useless. 
If we had Steam purchased, we wouldn't need TPB for something like that."
[V],harry711,2011-06-18T21:44Z,"@Dem0n1337: _your_ comment is useless. There are many people here who own HL1. If you don't have it, you can easily find a crack for it yourself, but of course you lose access to VAC-secured servers.

TPB isn't just a place for piracy. I hope you understand that."

So ThePIRATEbay is not a place for piracy? Hmm..."
