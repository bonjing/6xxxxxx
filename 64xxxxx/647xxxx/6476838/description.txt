The Financial & Economic Crisis - Collection 6:

There many similarities between the financial and economic (FE) crises and world wars. They are all calamities of global proportions that started in the West, and they affected hundreds of millions of people all over the world. 
The difference: in world wars, people lost their lives and they sustained physical injuries. In the FE crisis people lost their jobs, homes, savings and livelihoods, and they sustained mental and psychological injuries.

Christianity is the major source of morality in the West. It failed to prevent WW1 and WW2; and it failed to prevent the many FE crises in the past. Unfortunately, this means we shall witness more FE crises in the future coming from the West.
