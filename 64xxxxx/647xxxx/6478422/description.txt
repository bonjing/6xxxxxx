Turquoise & Crimson is a double-album released by the band VAST, their fourth album, released in 2006 under Jon Crosbys 2blossoms record label. The two discs contain re-mastered tracks found on the online release of Turquoise & Crimson and the major-label release of Nude, albeit in different mixes and with different production. The track listing is also different on the retail version than the official online version. Frontman Jon Crosby has said that the retail version is the official final version of the album.

The album also has its own specialized album art, different from the album art released for the Turquoise 3.x and Crimson 3.x releases, which each had their own album artwork.
