Enya (born Eithne Patricia NÃ­ BhraonÃ¡in, anglicized as Enya Patricia Brennan, 17 May 1961) is an Irish singer, instrumentalist and composer. Enya is an approximate transliteration of how Eithne is pronounced in the Gaoth Dobhair dialect of the Irish language, her native tongue.
She began her musical career in 1980, when she briefly joined her family band Clannad, before leaving to perform solo. She gained wider recognition for her music in the 1986 BBC series The Celts. Shortly afterwards, her 1988 album Watermark propelled her to further international fame and she became known for her unique sound, characterised by voice-layering, folk melodies, synthesised backdrops and ethereal reverberations.
She continued to enjoy steady success during the 1990s and 2000s; her 2000 album A Day Without Rain sold 15 million copies and she was named the world's best selling female artist of 2001. She is Ireland's best-selling solo musician and is officially the country's second-largest musical export after the band U2. Her album sales were more than 75 million worldwide, with over 26 million in album sales in the US. Her work has earned her four Grammy awards and an Academy Award nomination. She has performed works in 10 languages.
