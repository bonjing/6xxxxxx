There are so many office torrents, start by telling us why this one is different."
,jersson,2011-06-15T20:31Z,It sounds very good and I need this one but please tell us more. More info buddy...
,T.A.H.,2011-06-15T20:42Z,"hey, I'm TheAeroHacker, I made this second account cuz my original account didn't wanna write comments, but here are some of the details:

Word, Powerpoint, Excel, InfoPath, Publisher, Outlook Business Edition, OneNote, Access, SharePoint Workspace, and Lync are all included

This will activate itself during installation, so you don't need to worry about the serial keys

Sorry I didn't write all the details, I'm workin on several other projects right now so I didn't really have much time to write...."

,GigaBoii,2011-07-04T12:43Z,"You can tell an installation of M.O 2010 is activated by going to the menu inside of any of the office programs, under under you menu, and then click on ""HELP"" near the bottom of the menu. heres a pic! LOL!

(DONT CLICK ANYTHING! JUST WAIT, IT WILL LOAD!!!!)  

I just updated my office 2010 x64 to SP1 (KNOWING WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN, BUT I HAVE BALLS!) "
,GigaBoii,2011-07-04T12:46Z,"Actually, click the teeny small little square next to the ""DOWNLOAD"" link. 
Bayimg is hilarious. Have never upd, or dl from them b4.. "
,GigaBoii,2011-07-04T14:24Z,"just got done installing this one. it wasnt ""PRE-ACTIVATED"". I managed to use Office 2010 Recovery Activation.
Just install this or the 32 bit, and use that activator. 
If you have Security essentials it will flag this, just keep moving. 
Grant program all available rights, it is going to install all the correct files, in the correct place. 
Dont forget to have all of the MO programs closed, prior to running the program. 
Just open, and hit EZ Activator! You can then check word, or whatever, and it will be activated! 
SP1. I am going to apply all updates, and comment back. Good luck
Post something in my forums, BTW!

,thesoftparade,2011-07-05T23:11Z,Thank you very much!
,gauravpande,2011-07-08T03:48Z,Works like Magic on my Win7 64 bit.. and yo don't need more instructions than mount and install!! Thanks a ton Aero.. I'm sweeding.. Great download speed and less leachers!
,-Adrena-,2011-07-10T02:47Z,"I agree ... you need nothing more then mount and install. ITS EASY !! A lot of the other torrents on this site DON'T WORK !! This one does :] 

Windows 7 / 64bit"
,FaythsDenyle,2011-07-15T01:14Z,Says that it's not Activated. I just downloaded and Installed and mounted like was instructed. How do I fix this?
,tpb9000,2011-07-18T02:46Z,Confirmed working! Thanks!
,Schueyf1,2011-08-02T21:52Z,"Works perfectly so far!
However, it clearly states that ""This product is unlicensed"" when I check in the Help menu. Should I be worried about that? Is it going to expire or what? Just wondering if that's just one of those eternal things, without me ever actually having to activate anything. Because there really isn't anything forcing me to do any kind of activation."
,123merlin,2011-08-21T17:37Z,"Te same situation as Schueyf1 and FaythsDenyle

Installed on 64 bit - no problem but it does says ""Prodict Activation Required!

.. and it offers the opption to change the product key and say ""This prodict is unlicensed"".

Is there a way to Activate it - I can't see the Pre-activated think. :-)"
,1minute269,2011-08-31T21:15Z,requires activation after 30 days.
,TheAeroHacker,2011-09-04T17:50Z,"Okay guys, I am so sorry that some of you couldn't activate this, if you are having any problems activating this just download the Microsoft Office 2010 Toolkit, or email me (TheAeroHacker @ Hotmail) and I will send you the download.... The torrent used to work before, but I guess it won't activate itself anymore."
,1minute269,2011-09-04T22:51Z,"no the downloaded torrent works, for 30 days. then activation is required, but i downloaded an office key generator which has worked for about a week and counting. thanks!"
,funnykindel,2011-09-06T22:43Z,which key activation did you use?
,Sviatislav,2011-09-13T19:09Z,Splendiferous! You the man!!
,dicentiu,2012-04-21T11:29Z,"it asks for activation after 30 days. 
use Microsoft Office Toolkit for activation. is the same as for the x86 version. 
"
,blacktraveller,2012-04-22T15:34Z,"This is the right torrent, I been waiting for no serial needed. Its fully activated and works well on windows7 64bit OS. Thanks for the upload"
