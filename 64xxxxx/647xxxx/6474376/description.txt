The Maltese doomsters from NOMAD SON have made a huge
impact on the scene with their debut and live shows. Their
2nd album brings dark, Hammond-driven, ominous heavy doom
metal tinged with epic and obscure soundscapes - the
perfect tapestry for the band's take on the spiritual,
social and moral decay afflicting humankind in today's
unrepentent world. This soundtrack for the apocalypse has
irresistible charm, especially if you worship TROUBLE,
CANDLEMASS, KRUX, ABSTRACT ALGEBRA, PENTAGRAM, LAS CRUCES,
but also DEEP PURPLE or ATOMIC ROOSTER. Sceptics shall see
you can bang your head to doom!
