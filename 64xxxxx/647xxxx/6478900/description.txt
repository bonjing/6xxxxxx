 Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), 17, looks after her catatonic mother; her brother, Sonny (12); and her sister, Ashlee (6). Every day, she makes sure they are fed, dressed, and bound for school, whilst teaching them basic survival skills (e.g. hunting and cooking.) The family is very poor - as an incident where the family dog is fed with stale food demonstrates (one of several incidents where someone is thrown a "bone". Her father, Jessup, a meth-cooker, hasn't been home for a long time and his whereabouts are unknown.
