,cschrille1,2011-06-18T01:14Z,Beta? But isnt this like CloneDVD? Never heard that beta came for fear 3.
,robalm,2011-06-18T03:47Z,"Smells like bullshit to me, why would you need crack for a beta release."
,Jinkaro9,2011-06-18T04:00Z,worth a try ... trusty uploader ... i hope
,motley666,2011-06-18T04:01Z,"They didn't say anything about beta, but uploader is trusted so i guess this is real. No way better than the first fear though."
,Jinkaro9,2011-06-18T04:01Z,il scan all the exe's just in case
,Achilles295,2011-06-18T04:58Z,It's most likely similar to the Deus Ex BETA that came out a while ago. Also MAFIAA. doesn't upload fakes.

,Josha5000,2011-06-18T08:47Z,"Doesn't ""full"" stand for ""beta"" at actual games nowadays? ;)"
,Netarangi,2011-06-18T09:25Z,The full game is out in a few days.. Don't bother.
,H3roChr1s,2011-06-18T14:02Z,"I wanna play it on LAN with my bro,but it says that,"" steam connection has been lost"" when i want to create a game :("

,terrorking24,2011-06-19T15:18Z,"beta is working, you need crack beacause it is a steam version"
[T],swebarb,2011-06-19T16:18Z,"What a waste,, u die and u start from beginning.. wait till full version instead. And its hard as hell even on easy mode 2 bullets and u are dead.. fuck"
,kik6666,2011-06-20T20:33Z,"it's because it isn't on easy mode, there's a bug in all the BETA versions for this game that no matter how low you set the difficulty the bug always sets it on hard"
,BlackMoth,2011-06-21T01:57Z,"FOR ALL OF THOSE WITH CARDS THAT DON'T SUPPORT DIRECT X11 USE THIS SWITCH ON THE LAUNCHER .EXE

-d3d9

Eg.

""C:\FEAR 3\F.E.A.R. 3.exe"" -d3d9

ENJOY!!"
,cooper125,2011-06-21T04:00Z,"It says ""connection to Steam has been lost"" when I try to play. Don't see anything in the instructions about that.."
,SarethW,2011-06-21T21:57Z,"I'm a huge Fear fan but even not going to download this, even intrigued and desperate I am to play this, I want to experience the real  full game, not Beta.

I'll just wait till a proper Skidrow crack comes out for the game, finish the campaign on late night weekends, and then try to figure out how to bypass steam to play Co-Op with my bro.

Thanks anyway who uploaded this "
