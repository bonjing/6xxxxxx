,princekyuubi,2011-06-21T21:53Z,Well!!? Does It Work?
,darkmatte2,2011-06-24T00:06Z,"Not only didn't it work, it F'ed up my computer, scanned it with avast Which resulted in ""virus free"" But! Something is evil about it and it makes you windows go boom."
,darkmatte2,2011-06-24T00:09Z,"Like aids, all it does is to wreck havoc. but with your computer, don't download it."
,FoamyKing,2011-06-24T01:15Z,"The movie works, I've just watched it and the quality is good overall: I'd say the video is 9 and audio 7. Not really an entertaining movie, but you won't cry that your eyes are bleeding or you hear ""omfg background noises in my head, maaan!"" like on other torrents.

For the people above who complained about viruses, get a mop for your crt monitor dustbunnies. They are truly dangerous and can get you sick, just by beeing near computers. In fact, this very message contains a deadly trojan that will infect your puny mind forever."
,darkmatte2,2011-06-24T10:35Z,I did say that the virus scan checked out. But everytime i even went near that folder and that file my windows not only shut down explorer but my firewall and antivirus went down. (Never happened before) And this download was the only suspect thing I did.
,Anardi,2011-07-01T20:37Z,"Not a virus as far as I can tell, although I did find an infection shortly after downloading this (and other things), but definitely a fake."
,aafz02,2011-07-04T16:04Z,"Fake! Dunno why I didn't believe the others but HAD to check it myself. 

That's two fakes in as many days, I notice the PrisM one was removed.

[H],tykoon123,2011-08-13T19:48Z,it's very easy to post fake without even downloading it.
