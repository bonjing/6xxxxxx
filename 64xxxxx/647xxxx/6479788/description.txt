corrected some registry entries in the PRESERVE.INF file
-updated WMP 6.4 and WMP 5.2 packages to include the URLMON.DLL & WININET.DLL

Starting with version 1.01 of the SP, the OSR2 SP deletes older OSR2 SP 
QFECheck registry entries from previous versions of the OSR2 SP when 
installing over a previous version.

Version 1.04 is probably the last release of the 1.0x series of the SP


Windows 95 Extra Drivers Discs:
-------------------------------
Microsoft has made the Windows 95 Driver Library (W95DL) available. The W95DL 
contains drivers for many printers, display adapters, sound cards, and 
network adapters not provided with Windows 95. If you have a modem, the 
drivers are available for free on the Microsoft Download Center. Please note 
that standard connect-time fees and long-distance telephone charges, if any, 
apply during downloading.
NOTE: The drivers included in this library are intended for use with Windows 
95. These drivers are not recommended for use with earlier versions of 
Windows.

PS/2 mice; uses only 3K (!) of memory
