,lisaherzel,2011-06-19T21:07Z,"I will let you know as soon as I complete my download. I'm interested in the Windows 98 resurrection as well. However I could not find it, did you post it somewhere?"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-20T00:33Z,"No it was basically a friends only kinda deal, HOWEVER, seeing so many interested in this, ill rebuild it again. 98 was fun to play with, let you mod a lot more than 95 does and the streamline installers worked almost brainlessly. Thanks for throwing some ambition out there for me"
,erroneus,2011-06-20T04:21Z,Totally bring back Win98!!  I want to load a machine up with XWing vs Tie Fighter!!
,lisaherzel,2011-06-20T19:05Z,I have been looking for a proper Win98 version on the web for some time now. Basically all I can find are basic copy's of the original Win98 SE version. There is a lack of a proper package like you provide for Win95 in this torrent. I think a lot of people would be interested and grateful if you took the time to also make a 'resurrection edition' of Win98.  
[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-20T19:12Z,"Should be up today I'm hoping (98SE Resurrection Edition) Lotta people wanted me to rebuild it cuz of this torrent, and i always give the public what it wants!"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-20T20:07Z,Windows 98SE N2KMaster Resurrection Edition here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6483018/Windows_98_N2KMaster_Resurrection_Edition
,nutter123,2011-07-08T20:57Z,Obvious question but how do you install using the virtual machine programs? W95 Doesn't have a setup file in it.............
[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-15T23:31Z,not sure this is basically for us that have old 486's and P133's sitting in our closets.

,pirateprotiva,2011-12-08T03:37Z,"n2kmaster, How do I burn the ""Windows 95 N2KMaster CD Rip.IMG""? IMG Burn wouldn't touch it and Alcohol 120% burned it but the disc was unreadable. 

Also I didn't see a ""readme"" explaining the install order."
