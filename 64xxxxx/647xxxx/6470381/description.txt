Some more from my research files, including a demonstration video of how the brainwaves corresponding to vision (in this case of a cat) can be decoded and displayed on a video monitor.   This is technology in the public sphere today.

Also included are some miscellaneous tidbits on the organized stalking phenomenon, which is part and parcel of the shadow government / secret society network which runs everything now.    They are the true criminals; they are the true terrorists.

Also an article on the very convenient explosion at a water-fuel research company in Simi Valley, California, with the even more convenient presence of the local SWAT team right down the road.  There have been quite a few water-fuel discoveries in the past decade or so, and none ever seems to survive to see the light of day.   Also be sure and check out the documentary film "Who Killed the Electric Car?" if you haven't seen it already.
