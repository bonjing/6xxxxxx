KUBRICK - The Rarity Archive

This archive has been created so that fans and aficionados can access the rarest and most sought after Stanley Kubrick material in one place. It is an archive for collectors, for students and scholars and for anyone who wishes to experience more of SK than is available in the public domain.

Files included:

Fear & Desire (1953)
Kubrick's first feature was self-financed with $17,000 loaned from his uncle. SK later bought and destroyed almost every print of the film. His attempts to suppress the work were not entirely successful, with reportedly two remaining prints currently held at the George Eastman House in Rochester New York.
