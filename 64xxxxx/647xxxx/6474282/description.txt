i dont know what the hell happened. there was a power outage while the torrent was seeding so it's probably derived from that. as a result, the disc vanished from my HDD. now is fixed as i retrieved the lost content by copying from the original blu ray disc via the blu ray optical drive. sorry for lost time downloading previous torrent..


i cant seed 24/7 so if u see 0 seeders is because the computer is turned off. be patient eventually you will complete it. my network connection is very fast provided there's good peering between clients, or whatever is called. i will continue to seed until there is at least 2-3 seeders besides me, after that is most likely bye bye kansas on my part. i only put this up to improve my shitty ratio so the admins dont ban me.

if after a week there in not even 1 leecher i will delete the torrent because my hard drive space is rather limited.


ENJOY THE SHOW AND I HOPE YOU LIKE IT AS MUCH AS I DO.
