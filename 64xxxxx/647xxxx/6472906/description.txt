+ RELEASE iNFORMATiON +
-----------------------
The Swedish epic metal group Falconer decided to take a slightly different
direction for their seventh album for Metal Blade Records, leading to an album
that more fully embraces their folk influences, and features lyrics sung
entirely in Swedish. Produced by King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRocque at his
studio in Sweden, the band seems to expect fans of their more metal-oriented
work to be slightly confused, but explained that the album is a way of paying
tribute to their longtime influences.
