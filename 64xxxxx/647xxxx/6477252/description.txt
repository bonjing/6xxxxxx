None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
No attempt has been made to "shrink" the file sizes.
All have custom menus using part of the original menus where possible.
I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

Enjoy 

All 41 episodes

Removed commentary, interviews, story boards and "bonus" material.

Files basically untouched as the quality was fine, just joined to make one dvd9
