Proactive Password Auditor v1.80.48.4110 Portable

Proactive Password Auditor is a software that says to "test the security," trying to detect passwords. Via brute force, all passwords can be broken. But time-consuming. The longer, more secure. The question is not whether the password is discovered, but when. So the PAP tries to find Windows passwords using different methods, and displays how much time did. Depending on the quality of the password, he can find it in minutes.
