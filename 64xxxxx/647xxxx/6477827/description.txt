What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


Today's offering: DC from Cairo, to Centurions

As usual I have everything of DC that has been scanned, and some Pre & Post DC comics for characters or series DC has published which have also been published by others. The big non-DC thing this torrent is a lot of Captain Marvel, known today as Shazam because Marvel owns the name Captain Marvel. There is also some Captain Action and  Captain Atom from other companies


Enjoy!

DC canceled a bunch of comics all at once in 1978. This was called the DC Implosion. These two comics were printed up by folks at DC for internal use. They are made up of stories that would have been published in the cancelled comics.

Captain Action was created to sell an action figure that could become various super-heroes. You could buy different costumes and such. DC published a short series. Decades after the action figure ceased to be Moonstone did some more Captain Action comics.

Captain Marvel was created by Fawcett Comics. For a time he was very popular, even outselling Superman. A whole Marvel family of heroes were created - Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr, even Hoppy the Marvel Bunny. DC sued Fawcett for copyright violation, saying Captain Marvel was a copy of Superman. They won big. Captain Marvel was history. He and other Fawcett properties passed to DC. DC never used him until many years later. By that time Marvel had created their Captain Marvel. DC had not maintained the trademark so they can't use that name. So they publish him as Shazam! He will always be Captain Marvel to me.

This has no reason to be here. It's just a few issues of a character with the same name as Captain Marvel, but it's not the same hero. But I do odd things like this

DC Briefly had a deal with the French comics company Humaonoids to publish English translations of their tittles in the US. Humanoids now does this on their own. Some of the titles DC published are scanned and some are not. As something of a substitute for unscanned ones, and because I imagine some of you like Humanoids titles and would be happy to have them, I am including what ever I can find of theirs, whether a commercial translation or an amateur one  - aka scanlation. This next was not a DC title
