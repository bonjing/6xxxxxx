Movie information

Directed by:  Drew Thompson and Tim Goldby 

Summary: The release is cause for celebration amongst Purple fans due to the rarity of material. Extensive interviews with keyboardist Jon Lord and bassist Glenn Hughes tell the tale of a band caught by circumstance into one of its most controversial, extreme and exciting eras of its long career. Ian Gillan and Roger Glover were gone. A young unknown singer by the name of David Coverdale was recruited as was bassist Hughes. The results were the albums Burn and Stormbringer (both released in 1974). But then Ritchie Blackmore left the band. 

Against all odds, they rocked on, recruiting Tommy Bolin (from Zephyr and The James Gang). The album Come Taste The Band (1975) documents the short-lived Bolin era, an era that all came crashing down when the band announced in July of 1976 that it was breaking up. By December, Bolin would be dead due to a heroin overdose. Nine years of silence would ensue.

This 85-minute documentary portion, "Getting Tighter," recounts the trials and tribulations of a band in turmoil, riding the rock'n'roll roller coaster to total excess. With its live images, backstage footage, never-before-told stories and original video material carefully culled from years of research, it's a veritable bonanza for Purple fans and fans of Rock History. No stone is left unturnedâ€¦and sometimes it's not pretty. Gritty, truthful, wild, this is the story of an era in the 1970s that is simply unforgettable.
