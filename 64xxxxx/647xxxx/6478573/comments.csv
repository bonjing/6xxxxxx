,Chisinau_Moldova,2011-06-18T16:18Z,"The most embarrassing and cringeworthy film I've ever seen.

A $20m piece of Georgian propaganda that ignores the facts completely.

Even the UN report admits that Georgia started the war.

Scroll down and read the review 2/3rds down the page.

Please don't waste your time and life with this crap,you'll never get that 90 minutes back again,download one of .BONE.'s other excellent uploads instead."
