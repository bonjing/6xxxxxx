This is a large collection of ebooks including many from Ragnar Benson and Paladin Press.

With this collection of ebooks you can learn to survive through anything from nuclear disaster to being stranded in the desert.

You can learn to make more different kinds of explosives than most people even know exist.

I have assembled within this collection everything you need to teach yourself lockpicking, martial arts/self defence (many great books by Bruce Lee and others), how to be a Hit Man, the ancient art of Ninjitsu, how to kill silently, pickpocketing, counter sniping, improvised weapons, and even how to build your own airplane.

There are too many books to list them all, but I uploaded the folder in non Rar format so you can pick and choose which ones you want.

Enjoy and seed please!
