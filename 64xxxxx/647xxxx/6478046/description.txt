As teenagers, Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) begin a whirlwind
courtship that soon blossoms into tender intimacy. The young couple is quickly
separated by Allies upper-class parents who insist that Noah isnt right for her.
Several years pass, and when they meet again, their passion is rekindled, forcing
Allie to choose between her soulmate and class order. This beautiful tale has a
particularly special meaning to an older gentleman (James Garner) who regularly
reads the timeless love story to his aging companion
