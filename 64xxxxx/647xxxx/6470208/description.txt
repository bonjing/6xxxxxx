                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Jon Snow presents an investigation into the final weeks of the civil war between
 the Sri Lankan government and secessionist group the Tamil Tigers. Using video 
 footage shot on mobile phones, the programme details atrocities purported to have 
 been committed by both sides. A recent report by UN experts concluded that as many 
 as 40,000 people were killed in the conflict's final weeks, and also called for an 
 independent inquiry into violations of international humanitarian and human rights 
 laws.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
