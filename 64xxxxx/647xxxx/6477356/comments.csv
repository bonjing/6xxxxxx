,dancemyth,2011-06-21T07:14Z,I keep getting a file check error? I did the right click and selected japanese but the game doesn't start. The error message is in japanese.
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-06-22T09:28Z,"Okay the english install was easy.

1. Download the torrent
2. Unpack the torrent.
3. If on Windows 7, Install AppLocale through a elevated command line (Start Menu, type CMD then SHIFT + CTRL and enter, place the applocale wherever you want, then start it throught the cmd window)
4. When the AppLocale is installed, open the AppLocale window.
5. Select the game, in our case CM3D English.exe
6. Just go through the wizard, and you should be good to go."
