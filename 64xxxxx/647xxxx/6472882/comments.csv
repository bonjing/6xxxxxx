,SpiderLess,2011-09-20T01:05Z,"please seed and keep this alive, i worked really hard to put these vidoes and torrent together."
,mcnasta,2012-03-11T22:31Z,Works great on my PS3!! No converting needed.
,Dorstlesser,2012-03-27T12:29Z,"Downing right now. Will be uploading from a decent connection from tomorrow onwards, because this should be a great torrent!"
,Dorstlesser,2012-03-29T00:23Z,"Good quality, better than the one I previously had. The dual audio is great; I usually prefer the Japanese because the English dubs are crap for most anime, but the English dub on FLCL is actually pretty good; and not having to read the subs makes it much easier to enjoy the awesome animation.

Thanks a bunch, let's get this torrent to the top!"
