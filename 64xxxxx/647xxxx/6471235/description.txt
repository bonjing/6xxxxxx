Release Notes:

The UK's crossover thrash kings return with a storming new full length as they
career through 25 fast and furious tracks in the vein of D.R.I., Municipal
Waste, early Anthrax and Suicidal Tendencies!

SSS 2011 are certainly faster and harder than before, which is backed up by
their formidable guest musician Barney Greenway of Napalm Death who occasionally
lends his considerable vocal talents, Hell yeah!!

Though despite all this SSS also manage to turn in some of their most rocky and
damn right catchy tunes they have ever commited to record with some especially
rocking instrumentals!
