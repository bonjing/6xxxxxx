Â» Storyline: David Norris (Matt Damon), a rising young politician in New York City, loses badly in a bid for the Senate. Going into the bathroom to compose his concession speech, he encounters ballerina Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) hiding in a stall from security after crashing a wedding. The two strike it off and then unexpectedly kiss before David is called to go on stage. Due to her inspiration, he gives a rousing off-the-cuff speech. Some time later, he bumps into Elise on a bus and she gives him her number. A group of mysterious men in hats have been following David. One of them was late for an incident in which he was due to knock coffee onto Davidâ€™s shirt, which would have made him miss getting on the bus and meeting Elise. The men capture David and explain that they are in charge of doing the tiny things that adjust reality in coordination with their Plan, which dictates that he and Elise are not meant to meet. They burn Eliseâ€™s number and tell David if he ever sees her again, they will be forced to fry his brain. Despite this, David rides the same bus again for the next three years in the hope of encountering Elise. One day he see her and jumps off, pressing her to meet him again. The adjustment team do everything in their power to stop the meeting happening but David cleverly outwits them. They then bring in the enforcer Thompson who explains to David that if he follows their Plan, he will become President and Elise one of the worldâ€™s top dancers, but if they follow the path of their romantic impulses then this never happens and they live a life of mediocrity together.
