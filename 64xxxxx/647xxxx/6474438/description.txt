Release Title: Serpico 1973 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Sidney Lumet
Tagline: Serpico is a cop in the early 1970s. Unlike all his colleagues, he refuses a share of the
money that the cops routinely extort from local criminals. Nobody wants to work with Serpico,
and he's in constant danger of being placed in life threatening positions by his "partners".
Nothing seems to get done even when he goes to the highest of authorities. Despite the dangers
he finds himself in, he still refuses to 'go with the flow', in the hope that one day, the truth
will be known
