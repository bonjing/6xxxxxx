[V],polisdavid,2011-06-15T17:01Z,"LiaFlia,

Yeah I did, and quite frankly I like 1.2 better, do you want me to upload that one?"
,LiaFlia,2011-06-15T18:41Z,"Thank you, Polisdavid. I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to respond before you posted 1.2.
I was already using 1.2, but when I downloaded 1.2.1, it didn't work for me.  
A never-ending sequence of boxes kept popping up, saying that my password for one of my accounts was wrong, but since those popup boxes wouldn't stop, I couldn't do anything except force quit the program. Also, my other account had a red border as if it was disabled.  So really, it was like I was using a malfunctioning Sparrow Lite. 
I wanted to know if this was happening to anyone else.
Just now on another site, I downloaded it again, and that one seems to be working.  I was satisfied to keep v1.2 myself. Guess we'll all have to wait for more updates from Sparrow."

Glad that my upload of the [k]'d version of 1.2 worked - I like it better too - we'll see what sparrow has to offer next.
