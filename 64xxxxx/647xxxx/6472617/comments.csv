Thanks.  Holding out for a widescreen cap, though.  Not sure why this show more than others is prone to get capped from 4:3 source."

I was sure TV Land was already broadcasting in HD, but it seems that still a future possibility for them.  The wide screen S1 uploads I presume must have come from DVD rips."
