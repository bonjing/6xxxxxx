,harryjohn09,2011-06-16T06:56Z,Is it possible to burn this in a clean DVD? thanks
,Cerebral222,2011-06-16T11:13Z,"@ harryjohn09, Thats not a problem; what I do is open the XP disc & copy & paste all files into a new folder, then create another folder inside that folder and Title it ""PROGRAMS"", I put all my programs + Drivers in that folder so everything is on one DVD, then I download N-lite & use it to make a bootable DVD ISO, you can also insert your drivers & hotfixes so they install automatically. This just makes things easy & saves wasting 4 gig of DVD space, hope this helped."

Hi Uploader, I've downloaded ur torrent and burned it in a clean CD with a minimal speed (16x) using nero 9 (burning was sucessful anyways) but it won't boot after I restart my pc. I've tried possible solutions like;
going to setup and put my boot device to cd or pressing f8 to load in boot set-up and pressing my cd but it just wont work... 

I hope there are smart solutions for these problem..


Blessed Be!!!"

did u burn the iso or extracted it
burn the iso directly with the slowest speed possible and then try it will work"

You sir, are a bad ass.
Most up to date collection hands down."

,avatar_24,2011-06-29T14:44Z,"There is no SP3 on x64 XP.
Only XP SP2 has x64."
