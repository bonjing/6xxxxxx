Newcastle\'s MaxÃ¯mo Park were among the more thoughtful bands to emerge during the UK post-punk/new wave revival of the mid-00s, due in no small part to the acutely observed lyrics of front man Paul Smith.
A year on from his group\'s rather disappointing third album Quicken the Heart, Smith is back with a collection of self-penned songs recorded with a collection of north-east friends including Field Music\'s David Brewis on bass. This is apparently just a side project rather than the beginning of a solo career â€“ MaxÃ¯mo Park are currently working on new material â€“ and Margins doesn\'t represent much of a departure away from their established template.
