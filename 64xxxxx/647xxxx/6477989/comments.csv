[V],Anacondaz,2011-06-18T10:30Z,thanks for another great upload mate
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-18T11:10Z,"@Anacondaz

You're welcome.


NOTE: there's a small error in the install notes, so here are the correct steps: 

Install KIS or KAV 2012 v12.0.0.374, or PURE v9.1.0.124, and activate as trial. 
1. Once a new license is required disable the Kaspersky Self-Defense.
2. Exit Kaspersky by using the Kaspersky system tray icon.
3. Start KTR2012-v1.1c and press the ""Reset"" button.
4. Wait for Kaspersky to launch and activate your new trial period.

Done!

>> Note: Your computer has to reboot when resetting Kaspersky 2012."
[T],sanpork,2011-06-18T15:24Z,Thanx man you just saved my ass....
,Imitate,2011-06-18T23:00Z,Thanks man! I can't find a download for Kaspersky 2012 though?
[T],faren73,2011-06-18T23:43Z,"The reason I think people tend to prefer using keys, instead of trial resets, is the constant, non-stop nagging you have to endure during a trial period. If there was a way to stop the popups on my screen virtually every few minutes, i would probably use the resets, but unless that happens, then having to hunt for a new license once in awhile seems more convenient for me"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-19T00:46Z,"@Imitate
Read the !Read.First.Or.Fail.Later!.txt file. That's why it's named !Read.First.Or.Fail.Later!
Obviously still you failed reading it.


@faren73
There are not always trial nags when using a trial resetter. And so what if there are, as long as they're not really annoying.
Also: once again it's a matter of reading."
[T],faren73,2011-06-19T01:41Z,"If that is the case with this reset, then i WILL use it. I left the comment in the hope that someone could confirm one way or the other. My experience is that kaspersky is the worst for the nagging during a trial. I tend to use every area of my desktop and having to constantly close their windows to get to my shortcuts is more than an annoyance. i wish all companies offering trials would understand that. No offense intended to you RH"
[T],faren73,2011-06-19T01:55Z,"I did read the improvements, good to see you back here again and thanks for another great upload from the best"
,haznii,2011-06-23T00:33Z,TUNEUP media itnues cleaner.. please upload the newer fully working version of it :)
[T],fabunbutaps,2011-06-25T01:10Z,"mmmmh thank for seed but i never use an AV cracked or trial reset like this...i prefer to purchase an original .reg activation or code, that a personnal and safety choice"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-06-25T23:06Z,"@fabunbutaps 

Good for you, but I doubt that anyone cares about your useless post. 

Thanks anyway ......"
,Imitate,2011-06-28T00:25Z,"@RobbingHood
I didn't download it, as it said you needed to find a download link to the new Kaspersky. I knew it would be a waste of time, as I've said, there wasn't a reason to download it as I didn't know where to get Kaspersky 2012."
,swinburne,2011-06-29T13:15Z,"u can download the 2012 version from the kasperky website and then use this crack. thats what i always do, and it works.

as for the annoying notifications, you can turn them off in the settings."

You must be seriously blinded or you have a reading problem.
As I already said, the download links are in the !Read.First.Or.Fail.Later!.txt file.   

The first link is for Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2012 v12.0.0.374.

The second link is for Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 v12.0.0.374, but accidently it's described as dl link for Kaspersky Anti-Virus 2012 v12.0.0.374.

The third link is for Kaspersky PURE 9.1.0.124.


For those who are blinded, here are the links:

,leapinlizards,2011-07-02T23:22Z,"thx RobbingHood;
works fine here.
thx for all your uploads
cheers!"
,Husain.87,2011-07-07T17:50Z,"nice job
works with my win7 ultimate x64"
,tannerman,2011-07-11T00:00Z,this crack wouldnt work for me. when i activate new trial period it freezes and reboots my pc. why is your torrents never working robbing.!!
,tannerman,2011-07-11T00:01Z,after reboot i still see 5 days left!
[V],RobbingHood,2011-07-11T17:03Z,"@tannerman

As a matter of fact it's exactly the same crack as of your little friend Rupert77

And since that crack works for you I suggest that you stop posting bullshit comments
at my torrents, since that's all that you've been doing lately.

Consider this as a last friendly warning."
,peegee23,2011-07-19T03:36Z,thanks mr. uploader for the trial reset. saved my ass on KIS 2012. hope you'll post more soon. more power!
,Pierolle,2011-07-23T22:30Z,Just wanted to thank you RH for all your great uploads. Appreciate it.
,Tatletz,2011-07-24T02:08Z,"Thank you RH, all your releases are top notch!
Will try it as soon as my trial period expires : )"
,tannerman,2011-07-25T14:38Z,"looks like kaspersky finaly managed to take up the fight against piracy.

WARNING: All new trial resets has been blocked by kaspersky. It will lock your subscription days and freeze your kaspersky 10-30 minutes after the 30 days has been applied.

the roobing hood, this is not a joke."
,Tatletz,2011-07-27T08:47Z,Is this true tannerman? Has someone else had the same problem? If yes then just post some comments guys!
,tannerman,2011-07-29T16:15Z,"it's true. just try do the reset urself. also there are the same reports all over thepiratebay-
i also tried with 1.1d by ganjin trial reset"
,bangar91,2011-07-30T12:14Z,"i can confirm what tannerman says. Usually there is no problem with Robbinghood's uploads and it may have worked for some time but now, if trial reset has been applied even once, the trial period expires. This may be due to updates in kaspersky. Hope u look into it, RobbingHood!"
,swexpert,2011-08-03T14:42Z,"It still works, the secret is you just need to uninstall and reinstall within the 10 min working period (including delete license option).

Thanks
SG"
,swexpert,2011-08-03T14:44Z,"By the way, its not robbinghood's fault. No use blaming him/her for it to be not working.

Thanks to the creator and the uploader.
Maybe univeral access' will be able to resolve this issue if it comes out.

Thanks
SG"
,Kandahar1346,2011-09-10T08:45Z,thanks
,ianislavus,2011-09-10T13:55Z,"Sorry, but it works only for a moment. It resets activation, then I can register trial again, but after few minutes KIS tells me again, it's expired."
,GearCloud,2011-09-22T18:23Z,that's what i want
,.h10.,2011-10-16T16:30Z,this shit aint working. robbing shouldnt upload this shit
,stephon_,2011-10-28T14:29Z,works nice... thanks :)
