This is episodes 1-26 plus B-Side Theatres 1-9 of K-ON!! Season 2. This is the Frostii release. (Frostii.com)

The series is still going, so check out the above link to see if the next episode is out once you get done with these!

The files are in .mkv Format, so you'll have to use a player that can open them. I personally use VLC Player.
