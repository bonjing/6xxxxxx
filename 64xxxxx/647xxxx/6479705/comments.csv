The folder you'll download will have ""(Eng Dub)"" in its title. That's supposed to be ""(Eng Sub)"". Fault of the original uploader I got these from, sorry. :p"

I forgot to add the Pirate Bay tracker to the torrent, so it might say it has no seeds for a while. I'm seeding it, so don't hesitate to download! :3"

At current, I'm showing 8 Seeders and 38 Peers, so you should be able to download it MUCH faster if you have DHT and Peer Exchange and all that stuff on. Make sure not to disable uploads while you're downloading! :)"
