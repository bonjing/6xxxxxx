,snowbirds,2011-10-30T07:21Z,"Thanks for the up.  

A more realistic score for video is 8 or 9.  Dark scenes are very pixilated, and this is a movie about the undead, so there are a LOT of dark scenes...

Also, I find the entire movie is out of sync.  I've tried with both VLC and GOMplayer.  Same problem.  When I sync the audio then the video becomes choppy, so I'm just dealing with the oos, and trying not to look to closely at their lips when they speak...

Wish someone would have warned me so I could have found a better dl...

cheers"
