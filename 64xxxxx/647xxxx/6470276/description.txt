Underground Wellness - Disconnect: The Truth About Cell Phone Radiation.


Dr. Devra Davis, author of Disconnect, stops by UW Radio to discuss the dangers of cell phone use. Despite its popularity, the use of cell phones has been shown to damage DNA, break down the brain's defenses, and reduce sperm count while increasing memory loss, the risk of Alzheimer's disease, and even cancer. Dr. Davis' book is avaiable in the UW Store! Hosted by Sean Croxton of Underground Wellness.
