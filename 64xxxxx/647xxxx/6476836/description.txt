Plot

"Sucker Punch" is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid 
imagination of a young girl whose dream world provides the ultimate escape 
from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, 
she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures 
blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked 
away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to 
survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls-the 
reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the
 street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung)-
to band together and try to escape a terrible fate at the hands of their captors,
 Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino), before the mysterious High 
Roller (Jon Hamm) comes for Babydoll. Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in 
fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual 
arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to 
sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn),
 their unbelievable journey-if they succeed-will set them free.
