Hazardous is the fourth studio album by Vanessa Amorosi, released in Australia on 6 November 2009. It was recorded in Los Angeles and Sweden. On 16 November 2009 the album debuted at #7 on the ARIA Albums Chart.

She had shelved another record she had written to follow up Somewhere in the Real World. The record wasn't good enough â€“ she would start again. So on her way home from songwriting sessions, she stopped off in Sweden at the suggestion of her publishers. The connection between her and the MachoPsycho team was instant. "It was literally pouring out of us. It's such a crazy thing when you have the right magic and chemistry going on â€“ the songs tend to write themselves and really quickly," Amorosi says.

"This album is so raw and edgy and out-there... it might scare people whoâ€™ve bought my albums in the past," she said. "The whole album is all the stuff Iâ€™ve never wanted to talk about, and Iâ€™ve only now had the courage to put it out there. I had a lot to say with this album, thatâ€™s why it came so quickly. I think a lot of people thought Iâ€™d take my time again, which I was nervous about. We were going to head to Europe with the last album, but then it wouldâ€™ve been another two years, and people wouldâ€™ve thought â€˜Iâ€™m tired of buying her records, she pisses off after each oneâ€™."
