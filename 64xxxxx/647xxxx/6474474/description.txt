Description:
 These videos are from an Mtv special for Adam Sandlers Film Little Nicky....
I posted these tracks in my deftones oddities II torrent and there was some question as to whether they were real or not. So here is a video of the artists performing the songs...

Songs included:

"Be Quiet and drive"

"The Joker"

Note:The joker is originally by The Steve Miller band, not tom petty as I wrongfully posted in my other torrent.
