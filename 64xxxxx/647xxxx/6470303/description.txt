         This documentary takes a piercing                
         investigative look at the economic, political    
         and ecological implications of the worldwide     
         disappearance of the honeybee. The film          
         examines our current agricultural landscape      
         and celebrates the ancient and sacred            
         connection between man and the honeybee. The     
         story highlights the positive changes that       
         have resulted due to the tragic phenomenon       
         known as "Colony Collapse Disorder." To          
         empower the audience, the documentary provides   
         viewers with tangible solutions they can apply   
         to their everyday lives. Vanishing of the Bees   
         unfolds as a dramatic tale of science and        
         mystery, illuminating this extraordinary         
         crisis and its greater meaning about the         
         relationship between humankind and Mother        
         Earth. The bees have a message - but will we li
