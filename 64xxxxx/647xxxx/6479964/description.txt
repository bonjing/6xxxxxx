Upgrade Notes:

For versions prior to 1.23.0:

To retain your old settings you may have to copy your old config file/s to a new directory.
To find out where the new directory is on your computer, run the program and go to the
Traces tab and look on the 14th line, the line that says "Profile directory:", that is the folder
your config files should be saved now.
If you use the "media library / cache" option you should reset it.

Contains appz for Windows, MacOsX and Linux
