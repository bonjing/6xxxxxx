If you are one of those unlucky ones whose country got the screening date pushed a month or two and are dying to see it... well here you have it BUT be warned that the quality is really terrible... even for a screener. I would wait for a better one. Thanks to sceneline for the upload as I know he did the best he could to make this screener view-able but really... it is terrible."
