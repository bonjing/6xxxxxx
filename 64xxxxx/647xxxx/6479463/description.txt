Release Notes:
Here we go with another fine release. The source was pretty good for a first CAM, it had it's issues
though, it was filmed at a fuuny angle for some of the movie, you could also see a lot of black
around the screen. Firstly i took the source and converted it from it's Flash AVi format to one that
i could actually work with, i then cropped it, quite heavily to move most of the black around the
screen. I upscaled it so you can actually watch this on a larger screen, as the p2p cam had the
dimensions you would find on a Mobile phone. I then filtered it, adding a little brightness and more
colour. It's a little blocky in the high action scenes but all in all it's the most watchable copy
at the moment in my opinion. This unlike the other CAM will play on most things as it's XviD.
Big thanks to the original source. If you don't like CAM's don't download this, you have been warned. 
But for most this will be watchable. Enjoy! :D
