Far away from the groundbreaking psychedelic/electronica sounds of the Screamadelica and Vanishing Point discs, this album is a still hugely enjoyable slice of retro-rock. Fans of 70s-style hard rock with generous doses of funk, soul and blues will like this CD alot. The Rolling Stones meets the Black Crowes: excellent music.
