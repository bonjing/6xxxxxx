Game information:

=================



Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set  in  a  world

war I+II scenario. During the 7 campaigns the player has to fly  and  fight

through over 48 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose  between

different aircrafts, each with different strengths and  weaknesses.  Within

the  missions  the  player  gets  different  objectives  like   patrolling,

sneaking, hit & run, bombing and escorting.  Objectives  are  presented  as

dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player  can

upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes  easier,  have

more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose

between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the

game easier to control, while the second one gives more options to  control

the  aircraft.  Beside  the  campaign  the  game  also   features   several

multiplayer modes, local and via internet for up to four players.
