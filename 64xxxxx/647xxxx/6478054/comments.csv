Video... well.. blacks out at times, occasional people walking in front of screen, out of focus about 40% of the time.
Its a pain to watch to be honest, but thanks for the upload all the same.

Now it seems we are fuckin stuck with unwatchable cams like this until an r5 appears 12 years later!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
