LIVE IN YAKUSHIJI is a broad and deep journey, to inner realms as well as exotic earthly destinations that only Kitaro can deliver. Recorded over three evenings in the sacred Yakushiji Temple in the ancient Japanese capital of Nara in HD Audio. Kitaro reprises nine favorite compositions from earlier albums, plus his Golden Globe Award-Winning theme from the Oliver Stone film "Heaven and Earth" and two previously unreleased tracks. This is a tour de force for Kitaro and ensemble.
