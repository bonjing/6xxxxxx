Yeah, they're that tiny. Slightly better than an avi, quality-wise, and tinier. A 2.5 Gig, and above, BD (or even a BR) rip still shreds these on a modern television.

The ol' Yifster seems to have quite a following though, it seems.

,devsri_129,2011-12-28T20:47Z,Thanks for this torrent and others ... !!!
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-20T22:24Z,The problems people are having are mostly due to the MKV format which is non-standard (and generally sucks). Using MP4 instead solves most of the problems. And there is of course also good old AVI.
