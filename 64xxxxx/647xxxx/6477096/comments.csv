,Hotsiminh,2011-10-29T13:07Z,"This is NOT 1st Vares 2004 Yksityisetsivì±„/Privat Eye. This is Vares 2011 Pahan suudelma. In addition DVD was without sound! Is this Blueray rip or what? For me totally waste of effort. For Vares 2011 Pahan suudelma I strongly recommend other torrent.

If someone has first two Vares's in quality torrents, plz seed them!!!"

Those that know for sure can report them in suprbay so that the problem gets fixed. The only place I've seen the first two movies in high quality are filehost services but they are a pain unless you pay for them. Not a strong showing from finnish torrent community. These are actually pretty good movies and should be available at least in DVD quality.  "
