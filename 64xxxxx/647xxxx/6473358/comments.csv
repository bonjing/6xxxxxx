,The_Reasoner,2011-06-16T13:52Z,Been wondering when this would show up. I guess the director's cut won't be far behind. Thanks!
,Dexter8445,2011-06-16T22:20Z,"10/10 sound
10/10 video
My rating for the film itself would be 8/10. It's like watchmen, you've gotta be a fan of that kind of movie to enjoy it.. Wount recomend it to the people who loves justin bieber movies. They'll say it suck. (NO PHUN INTENDED!!)"
,g0dsize,2011-06-16T22:37Z,"Good quality, thanks for the upload.

I have to ask, though -- in this day of cheap mass storage and DVD writers, why are people still splitting movies into CD-sized files?  I thought we were past that 5 years ago."
,sexto57,2011-06-17T04:48Z,"What kind of third world, lame ass group still releases 2x700MB movies? Scratch that, even in third world countries they stopped using CD media years ago!"
,sex1234,2011-06-17T06:23Z,"seeding at 3 mbps enjy guyzz
diz is better dn dt max copy

,Vimes84,2011-06-17T08:42Z,"Maybe program he uses to convert movies split it automatically? AutoGK splits files to cd size without your permission, chill out people. Combining it together takes like 2 minutes (use nandub or virtualdub)


@uploader/ripper

in AutoGK (if that is what you using) set file size to 1401MB - program won't split it"
,Papa_Darkness,2011-06-17T12:32Z,"@sexto57 

Well perhaps instead of complaining, maybe get off your fat ass and rip the movie yourself and upload it as a single file then.

No?  Didn't think so.  So stop being a whiny little bitch, and be grateful that there are people out there willing to take the time and effort to provide this free service to everyone else.


Kudos to the uploader, excellent copy. A10/V10

,spifkitten99,2011-06-17T14:06Z,"Explain to me why you would divide it into two 700 mb parts?

This is not 2001, it's 2011. Nobody uses CD's anymore."
,spifkitten99,2011-06-17T14:08Z,"Papa, stick your ""do it yourself then"" crap up you know where.

It's not a valid reason to rip videos in stupid ways.

Today, there is no valid reason to split a video into cd's, and there is no valid reason to conform to the 700 mb size at all.

Even worse is when people rarsplit it. There is just no valid reason for that anymore, and no, rar-fix is not a reason, since a corrcupted only happens BECAUSE it's rared in the first place. And if the contents has a problem, a rar fix would not be possible anyway, since the whole thing would have to be re-rared."
,Papa_Darkness,2011-06-17T16:06Z,"Wow, the level of stupidity in here is alarming, if you don't like the free movie, then bugger off somewhere else and pay for it.

Unlike the rest of us who appreciate the effort that people do to bring us these rips."
,Papa_Darkness,2011-06-17T16:09Z,"And seriously, how hard is it to put the two parts onto one DVD?

I think some of you need to go back to school."
,DaYgon76,2011-06-17T17:47Z,"@g0dsize 
Dunno bout anywhere else but here in Australia DVD player won't play avi file if the file size is over 1GB. 
Me personally I copy to flash drive, plug flash drive into DVD player and watch on big screen. 
So files need to be split into 2 parts of 1GB or less or movies simply will not play."
,kritias,2011-06-17T19:18Z,"I'm using an external hard drive loaded with movies n documentaries plugged up to a homebrew'd Wii running WiiMC, and the limit to what the Wii can handle video-wise is fairly low (a teeny bit bigger than 480p), so uploads like this are a lifesaver. Thanks a ton

And for all you tards whining about two different parts, go get Boilsoft Video Joiner and shut the fuck up.

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."

WASTE OF TIME!"
,AdamGs1981,2011-06-19T19:28Z,To the douche bags complaining about this being split: Why don't you upload one that isn't split then...or find one that isn't. Or use a joiner program and join them together yourself. Who gives a shit if it's split. You people are what is wrong with society...don't appreciate anything. Thanks SAFCukO09. A-8/10...V-9/10.
