,Joss70,2011-06-17T12:27Z,"Hi. Thanks for your efforts.
There's however a sound issue (no sound) in several parts of the video : at 1min 28sec, 2min 37sec, etc..
Could a Proper or Repack could then be released please?!.. "
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-17T15:48Z,@Joss70: If one is released I will be sure to upload it asap.
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-17T16:02Z,@Joss70: Just checked four sites and no repack has been released as of yet. Try here for the xvid release(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6472995/XIII_The_Series_2011_S01E09_WS.XviD-err0001)
,Joss70,2011-06-17T16:58Z,"Thanks for your concern.

Yes, I knew the ""err0001"" XviD release. But as always with these ones, it's full of trailers or commercials (sometimes almost 1/4 of the video screen!) , channel logo..
That's why these Web-dl are so neat!  :)

(Plus I work on high-quality French subtitles for this whole XIII series, so you can imagine how Web-dl are so much better then... ^_^ )

Well, hopefully people who originally made this version will realize this sound issue I pointed and will have others feedbacks than mine too..
For a repack to be post.

Thanks for : ""If one is released I will be sure to upload it asap. "" !
:)"
,Joss70,2011-06-17T23:56Z,"Answer from ION: 

""In the first four minutes, there were 3 audio and video glitches.
i will report to Apple. Let's hope they will fix that.""

So let's hope Apple will... "
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-18T18:18Z,"As of now, no repack has been posted at any of my direct download sites. I will keep checking and if one is reposted I will upload it here asap."
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-19T15:43Z,Still no repack to be found.
,Joss70,2011-06-22T02:11Z,"I know the Directdownload sites too, yes it seems no repack will be released or at least not for now..

Thanks a lot anyway for your presence Thetorrentlord, from this topic and from all your previous releases, it's another proof of how good and serious you are... A pleasure and really.
So nothing to do here with people who just post mediocre things then run.
Thanks for this and for your work. "
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-23T01:11Z,Still no repack. Just watched this and there is missing audio in several places on my copy.
,Joss70,2011-06-23T19:51Z,Same issue and again for the E10_720p from ION... Lol  ^_^
