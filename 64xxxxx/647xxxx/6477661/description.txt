Constantine is a 2005 supernatural action film directed by Francis Lawrence, starring Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, with Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton and Djimon Hounsou. The film is based on Vertigo Comicsâ€™ Hellblazer comic book, with plot elements taken from the â€œDangerous Habitsâ€ story arc (issues #41-46) and the â€œOriginal Sinsâ€ trade paperback.

The film, which was met by film critics with mostly mixed reactions, portrays John Constantine as a cynic with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true form. He seeks salvation from eternal damnation in Hell for a suicide attempt in his youth. Constantine exorcises demons back to Hell in a bid to earn favor with Heaven but has become weary over time. With death looming, he helps a troubled police detective learn the truth about her sister's death while simultaneously unraveling a much larger and darker plot.
