He was one of ten children and his parents also raised four children of Maryâ€™s deceased sister. The children all grew up partially at the Blue Front, which served hot meals, sold groceries, housed a barbershop, and sold bootleg corn liquor to both its African American customers and to whites who would buy it out of the cafÃ©â€™s back door. With the money they earned from the cafÃ© and harvesting cotton, the Holmes sent most of their children to college.

During the segregation era the Blue Front was subject most of the time to a 10:00 pm curfew, but during the cotton harvest it stayed open 24 hours a day to accommodate workers processing cotton. Another segregation-era restriction was that the cafÃ© could not serve Coca-Cola, which was reserved for whites. They instead sold brands such as Nehi but began selling Coca-Cola after the end of official segregation.
Musical performances at the cafÃ© have historically been mostly informal, and notable out-of-towners who played there included James ""Son"" Thomas and Sonny Boy Williamson II. It also hosted musicians who played in what has been called the ""Bentonia School"" of the blues, which is characterized by distinctive tunings (E-Minor and open D-Minor), the use of falsetto, dark lyrical themes, and an overall eerie"" quality.

The most famous artist from Bentonia who played in this style was Nehemiah ""Skip"" James (1902-1969). James learned to play guitar from local musicians including Henry Stuckey, who was never recorded, and also learned to play the piano. He recorded on both instruments for Paramount Records in 1931, resulting in influential songs including ""Devil Got My Woman"", ""Hard Time Killing Floor"", and ""22-20 Blues"", which Robert Johnson recorded as ""32-20 Blues"". After his ""rediscovery"" in the 1960s, James recorded several albums and performed on the folk circuit, introducing his seemingly idiosyncratic style to a new generation."
