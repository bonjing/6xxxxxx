Releaseinfo      The Symantec Endpoint Recovery Tool (SERT) is a bootable

CD that can scan and remove malware from an infected computer.

SERT is useful in situations where computers are too heavily infected

for the Symantec Endpoint Protection client installed upon them to clean

effectively. It is also necessary against specific threats which have the

ability to completely hide from Windows, or that have techniques that

manipulate Windows into protecting the malicious process against

Symantec Endpoint Protection's scanning and remediation components.
