"Where There's A Will"

Peter and Neal must follow a treasure map 
will to save a kidnapped daughter.

Sudden? We told you days ago we support CRF.
And since you spent hours talking about us 
(/me blushes) we know you knew. 

The scene does not go by EST, it always has 
and always will be UTC, so it was 6-15 hours
ago.

Since the crf rules were 'nuked' there is no 
valid agreed upon ruleset or value.

19 was a perfect fit. [preset slow]

Proposed guidelines -
18-20 crf
18/19 with min of preset slow
20 with min of preset slower

Flexibility, and encourages those who would
be lame and just use the lowest all the 
time to actually still make an effort.

Evolve... or die.


Enjoy :)
