Self-manage digestive disorders through dietary choices
Suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder-whether it's irritable bowel syndrome, gas, constipation, heartburn, or another condition-can be embarrassing and debilitating. While medical treatments and prescriptions can offer relief, one of the most important ways you can help yourself is to choose the right foods to eat.

Backed by the American Dietetic Association, this user-friendly guide shows you how to analyze your eating habits so that you can map out a dietary plan to manage and reduce the uncomfortable symptoms of digestive disorders. You'll find practical recommendations for implementing changes in your lifestyle and advice on steering clear of common dietary mistakes. Your meals will be pleasurable and nourishing experiences-not painful ones-when you discover how to make the best and most comfortable food choices so you can embark on the road to digestive health.
