,Erocy,2011-06-16T20:38Z,"@Insomneac

,Insomneac,2011-06-16T21:38Z,"Thanks for the info, Erocy."
,topk,2011-06-19T01:25Z,There was a nuked release - is this a fixed one or...?
,tix666,2011-06-19T14:25Z,"the game CRASHES everytime after intro - when Alice is talking with the doctor, anyone has the same problem? Can't even start to play the game, please help! Crackfix didn't work either - same problem, same crash"
,centime,2011-06-21T00:12Z,"Although I didn't receive the message that kosmaverik did about the game being ""tampered with"", it has crashed a few times.  Since it doesn't always crash at the same time/place, maybe it isn't the game itself, but something on the PC end of things causing it to crash.

Remember to check things like running background processes, programs that automatically update, anti-virus programs, etc., that might cause disruption in the game.

Also, the Suprbay forum -  http://suprbay.org/ - might be a good place to find answers about the crashing problem, as well as other gameplay issues.

The module responsible for my crashes is always Kernel32, and I never receive a message of any kind.  All I do is reload and play on.

And remember, the crashing problem is not the fault of either Skidrow or AiTB, right?

Thank you, AiTB, for uploading this game, and thank you, Skidrow, for all your hard work in bringing it to us.  Aside from the crashing issue - which has nothing to do with you - this download installs and runs just fine.  You are both much appreciated.

To resolve issues you have delete these: activation.exe, EACoreServer.exe,
EAProxyInstaller.exe, PatchProgress.exe"
