In the golden age of bank robbers, when Bonnie and Clyde were doing 
big business, an inventor created and patented The Mancatcher - a 
3.5 metre-tall metal monster, designed to catch bank robbers in the 
act. The Long Arm of the Law takes on new meaning as the Patent 
Benders make a long-armed, motorized mechanical security guard unit, 
testing the contraption on some modern day gun-toting gangsters.
