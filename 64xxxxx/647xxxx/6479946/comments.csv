,grrratusernames,2011-06-20T04:46Z,"Finally, thank-you.  Seed people please"
,grrratusernames,2011-06-20T08:59Z,"Getting really annoyed at these leachers.  Bloody seed, its not hard.  This is a joke."
,grrratusernames,2011-06-20T13:33Z,"A-4 Out of sync
V-7
Can't help but feel the voice-narrator guy missing."
,grrratusernames,2011-06-20T13:35Z,To be honest I would wait for a better copy.  A-4 out of sync & v-7.  The narrator guy's voice is also not heard as he is in the other 2.
,incubus4952,2011-06-21T02:49Z,"My apology if it appears Out Of Sync your end. I have played it on all 4 of my systems and through the Hd Player into the Tv and I could'nt find it.  I did notice the narrator however and I see where may may be a bit confused. In the original (Which I have also played again and checked.) The narrator only appears at the beginning and during the dramatic ending.  I dont have the equipment to get a better copy from the Foxtel, Maybe someone can suggest the best hardware and software for future attempts. Thanks anyway for the feedback"
,grrratusernames,2011-06-21T05:44Z,"Fair enough, normally I can fix it if it's out of sync but not with this one."
,buddymarvel,2011-07-05T12:51Z,hope someone uploads a better copy this is out of sync...thanks for the time and effort
