FROM ISO50:
My official summer jams record is finally available and it couldn`t come at a better time, Com Truise`s Galactic Melt is mind tingling, full of future fuzz, and glows like melting hot glass. This album is like watching a volcano, not the eruption but more of the thick bright magma slowly oozing out unstoppable beauty. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
