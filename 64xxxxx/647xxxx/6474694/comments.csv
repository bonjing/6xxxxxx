,lunaserax,2011-06-22T00:10Z,"FINALLY!  LOVE IT!  The video doesn't fill the frame, and there is some head dodging and lighting wash outs but also some good close ups; it is very watchable, and the show is amazing!

Audio: 8
Video: 5-7

Thanks!!"

,sarsapil,2011-08-18T02:40Z,"I must say that being an atheist, I enjoyed the show, it's respectful of that religion in spite of making fun of it, it's like the Life of Brian, but mormons have shown their open-mindedness by not making a big fuss about it, it actually might help them since it draws attention to their religion."
