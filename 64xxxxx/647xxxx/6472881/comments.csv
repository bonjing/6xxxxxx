1] Biutiful - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164999/

2] A-i-deul... (aka Children...) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861982/

3] Insidious - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/

4] The Lincoln Lawyer

From my above requests, you told that A-i-deul... is not released in Blu-Ray yet. Fine, but what about the others? Is any of 'em released? And if released, can you please upload them with English subs? TIA."

,Matak12,2011-08-03T09:59Z,can you hardcode the subs in next time? no point watching it onxbox 360 if you cant understand whats going on
,Asher_jk,2011-08-17T06:47Z,Strangely even on PC there were complete scene for about 3-4 mts where the subtitles didn't offer anything.. so had to watch like a dumb @@@ and try to figure out wtf is going on A/V/M - 9/10/7

,kingobnoxious,2011-11-06T12:00Z,"Thanks for sharing. Quality is good value for size, just found it annoying that 40% of the dialogue is without subtitles, so have to guess whats going on."
