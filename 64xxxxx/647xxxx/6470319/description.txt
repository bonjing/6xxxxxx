         It's 1972 and the Mafia crime families are at    
         war, but that isn't enough to stop a young,      
         unknown John Gotti, who has big ideas and even   
         bigger ambitions. In order to put an end to a    
         two decades' conflict, Gotti pulls together an   
         unlikely crew made up of one member from each    
         crime family to pull off a silver bullion        
         heist. If Gotti can keep these criminal          
         misfits from killing each other and succeed      
         with this problem-riddled heist he will secure   
         himself a spot in mafia history. This gang of    
         misfit gangsters, hijackers and wanna-bees,      
         all in their late 20's, hang out playing cards   
         at a gambling den known as the "Sinatra Club"    
         owned by Crazy Salvatore Polisi, the narrator    
         of our story. At the time, nobody is getting     
         "made" because all the families are at war.      
         What's worse, the bosses have no idea who John   
         and his underlings are. Determined to make a     
         name for himself, John masterminds a scheme      
         that will either squash the beef among the       
         five families or get him and his whole crew      
         killed...
