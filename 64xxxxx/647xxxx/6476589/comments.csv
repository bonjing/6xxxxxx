,imbackagain0101,2011-06-18T00:01Z,sample looks good
,petabyter,2011-06-18T19:28Z,is a CAM?
,blusniffer,2011-06-19T07:25Z,"@LONERUNNER maybe you could lend me your night-vision scope so that maybe i could rate the movie a v-7!
Apart from the shots outside in daytime the rest of the movie is so dark you see part of the face but no background! Thanx but i'll wait."
,ericv1984,2011-06-19T08:57Z,"@petabyter, of course it's a cam idiot. Look at the screenshots before asking stupid questions."
,imthelizardking,2011-06-19T09:00Z,@ssseriina  why when i go to yebakoMovies it asks me to take a suvey in order to view movie. Really? does anybody feel these out? why do you people post them?

,sobber11,2011-06-26T17:50Z,"Definitely REAL!!  Just previewed the whole movie and it is very much watchable, a little dark but i'll give it 6/6.  Thanks GreatMagician!!  

By the way it plays in MPCStar and VLC Player and in my Bluray player as well!  People don't make false comments until you check it out first."
,AARRGG,2011-07-12T05:05Z,its funny how nOObs call things like this a fake when they dont know about things like codec packs. anyway... it was worth a laugh for me
,norez,2011-07-14T11:00Z,"It is not a fake. 
It is a really good quality cam recording. 
Not dvd or bluray quality. 
It's not pixelated, and the sound is good. The picture is a little grainy though. 
Thank you very much :)"
,saie88,2011-07-14T22:48Z,"I downloaded the sample, its a good camera recording of screen, hard to get it at first because quality of sample is very nice for a camera. Audio is almost nice. satisfying if the complete is like sample. Look at his logo he is GREEN greatmagician. so it will be ok. I give 8 of 10 to quality. (if u are a blue ray dvd guy then u will give 6-7 to audio and video both). Anyway briefly sample is a very good camera recording and for sure I use this even big for quality of 80%"
,saie88,2011-07-14T23:03Z,"with total respect to GreatMagician, I found this almost same or a little better with smaller size, sorry it is not polite to advertise here but for slow connection like mine small size and also a little better quality is important, try the the sample of this too:
