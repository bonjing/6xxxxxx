Fredrik Egerman is a middle-aged lawyer married to a 19 year old beauty, Anne. Their two-year marriage is still unconsummated, due to Anne's reticence. Fredrik has a son, Henrik, from his marriage to his late first wife. Henrik is in his early 20s and is a student studying to be a minister; he is currently tormented by his love for his step-mother, who secretly loves him in return. Henrik is distracting himself from his semi-Oedipal urges by engaging in an unhappy affair with Fredrik's lusty young servant, Petra. Between his two marriages, Fredrik had an affair with a notable stage actress, the beautiful Desiree Armfeldt, but she broke off the relationship. Desiree currently has a young son named Fredrik, born shortly after her affair with Fredrik Egermanâ€”it is implied but never directly stated that little Fredrik Armfeldt is the son of Fredrik Egerman. Currently, Desiree is having an affair with a brutal army officer, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. The Count's wife, Charlotte, is an old friend of Anne Egerman.

Fredrik goes to see Desiree one night to pour out his marital troubles and ask for her help. Due to an accident with a puddle, Fredrik ends up at Desiree's house wearing the Count's nightshirt, and the violently jealous Count turns up unexpectedly and threatens Fredrik with violence unless he leaves. Once Fredrik is gone, the Count treats Desiree violently, leading her to want to break off the affair. The Count tells his wife about the encounter and orders her to tell Anne about Fredrik's supposed infidelity (no infidelity actually occurred, however). Charlotte ends up confessing to Anne that she loves her husband despite everything and would do anything to be loved in return. In order to solve these woes, Desiree has her mother invite all of the cast of characters to her country house for a summer party. Over the course of one night, Henrik and Anne, upon unexpectedly finding themselves alone together in a bed, consummate their relationship and then elope, with the assistance of Henrik's former lover, Petra, and Petra's currently lover, Frid. Fredrik sees the lovers depart but does nothing. Charlotte then joins Fredrik, and upon learning that his wife is with Fredrik, the Count interrupts them and challenges the lawyer to a game of Russian roulette. After the game, the Count reunites with his wife, his feelings for her renewed by his jealousy. Desiree comforts Fredrik, and the four pairs of lovers retire to be happy together. (Wikipedia)
