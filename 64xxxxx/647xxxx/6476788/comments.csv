Also forgot to clarify the original was pixellated and 4:3. No pixellation now which is why the original was 700Mb and this is 2Gb more. But worth it. You can get all the tech info on VLC - TOOLS - CODEC DETAILS. Feel free to comment and if there's a movie you want but can't find on torrent sites,I'll try and get it and upload :-)"
