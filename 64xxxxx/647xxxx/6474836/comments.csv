,rodricks,2011-10-13T02:39Z,"Default audio is Russian, so most of the world will have to manually switch to English before each episode.  Video is noisy and slightly jittery on WDTV player.  'E' for effort, but will look elsewhere."

Amazon tells me that Series 2 is out on Blu-ray tomorrow. Any word on how long before it appears on TPB??"
,measserv,2012-01-02T23:09Z,English is avaiabale as a second language IF your player supports it.  VLC Media Player does.  I have had trouble with video qualty on several files such as unrecoverable stops after using FF.
,geenotreally,2012-01-15T12:43Z,"@rodricks, get rid of your WDTV ""HD"" player and get a Boxee Box from D-Link. You will thank me later.

Thank you GoodFilms for this fantastic upload."
,JHD1995,2012-03-01T01:25Z,"English can be selected from the list of available languages. 

Excellent quality, thankyou!"
