,Zero771,2011-06-21T21:58Z,"I hate when people who put up albums squeeze in their own songs they like or versions not even in the album. Seriously, Empire but Midi...sure that's cool but why do I doubt that's supposed to be there..or any of the ones after the 12th song."
,kddonovan01,2011-06-22T01:02Z,"@zero771

It's called Deluxe Edition for a reason."

,deftonesFTW,2011-06-25T23:19Z,"This is basically the same version on iTunes. All of the bonus tracks are the same, including the midi track. Check iTunes if unsure."
