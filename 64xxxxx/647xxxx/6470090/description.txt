                Shoddy.
                Rick's going from strength to strength in his new job
                as a presenter on the Bargain Channel, but he's not
                best pleased when Marty takes a shine to his
                co-presenter, Donna. Rick's neighbour Clive is on the
                warpath, demanding a refund for an ornamental
                windmill that his mother bought from the Bargain
                Channel, but it's Rick's shocking behaviour at a
                funeral that gets him into real trouble - and
                threatens to kill off his career for good.
