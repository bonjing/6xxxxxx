Wanneer Summer Flynt (Garrett Hedlund) nog jong is, verdwijnt zijn vader Kevin (Jeff Bridges), een computerprogrammeur. Zo'n 20 jaar later krijgt Sam bezoek van Alan 

Bradley, een oud-collega van zijn vader. Alan beweert dat de vader van Sam nog leeft en vermoedt dat hij terug te vinden is in diens vroegere arcadehal. Sam hecht niet 

veel geloof aan dat gegeven, maar gaat toch op onderzoek uit. Wanneer hij een verborgen kamer vindt, wordt hij opgezogen in een virtual realitywereld. Samen met Kevins 

vertrouweling Quorra (Olivia Wilde) komen vader en zoon in een gevecht terecht van leven en dood. Ze moeten zien te ontsnappen uit een cyberwereld die niet alleen heel 

geavanceerd blijkt te zijn, maar ook heel erg gevaarlijk.

The son of a virtual world designer goes looking for his father and ends up inside the digital world that his father designed. He meets his father's creation turned bad 

and a unique ally who was born inside the digital domain of The Grid.

USA ~ 99 minutes ~ directed by Patrick Read Johnson ~ with Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley.

Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and he's just about to appear in the social pages of the 

paper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as Baby Bink's parents; especially the three enterprising kidnapers who pretend to be photographers from the 

newspaper. Successfully kidnaping Baby Bink, they have a harder time keeping hold of the rascal, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a 

little bit smarter than the three bumbling criminals.

Hey Momma!

Well, we've started the crossing to Europe. The night before we got to Miami I was told I needed to go ashore at 9:00 am to help some of the guys buy equipment and 

supplies. I already knew with my tight schedule I wouln't have enough time to meet up with you for lunch. :(
But I have a story for you from the night before we got to Miami...
I was preparing for a show for two angry people, (the kind of performers that are all smiles on stage, and miserable when they leave), I decided I would do something a 

little different to 'get in the mood' to run their show. So, I went to the staff bar and ordered 2 Beck's. After I drank those I ordered 2 more...then one more. Had a 

nice buzz going on, so I decided to grab a quicing vodka. The next day I woke up to the sound of the PA system as the Cruise Director was notifying the crew/passengers 

about a boat drill that was about to take place. I thought to myself "Did anyone get off the ship for the equipment we needed? Why didn't anyone get me up?". My whole 

body was hurting, I felt like I had gotten into a fight. I called Charlie, "Dude, did you guys get off ship?", "Yeah," he says "We tried to wake you up, you left your 

door open last night so I was physically trying to wake you up, but I couldn't so we left". No way. What the hell. I don't remember ever being that wasted. He told me 

some friends helped me back to my room. They said they left me at the toilet, they figured I would be able to make it to my bed. 
I don't remember any of that. I don't even remember my knee buckling that night, I just remember Charlie helping me up from the floor. Apparently Charlie and I were 

going punch for punch, I was told I went to punch him in the arm and I swung and my knee buckled, so my punch bumped off Charlie's arm and continued as I fell. From 

what I'm told it was pretty epic. I've been relying on my friends to help me fill in the pieces from that night. Charlie actually yelled at me, "I can't believe you 

whipped out your dick, man!". I was in disbelief, "No way Charlie you're fucking with me".
Apparently our Production Manager Matt while drinking with us, after I blacked out, he told Charlie and I (I guess in the general conversation at a bar after drinks), 

"I bet I can draw a dick faster than you guys", I guess I won, at this point I've already pulled myself out and I'm getting their attention by pointing down at it. They 

went hysterical from what I'm told. 

Oh man, what a bad night. I missed the boat drill and Matt and Charlie helped cover for me. Great guys, but I'm beginning to think it may be harder to get fired than I 

expected. Oh well, I'll continue to rock out this job until I'm finished. I'll call you in a few days, probably this weekend. I love you and think of you guys!
I know this isn't exactly the kind of story you write home about. But, I figured I would be depriving you guys if I didn't let you know. 

I love you !

some bread). Anyway, I went and ran the show. I did great. So I decided to celebrate....by getting more beer. I had a couple more beers and went back to my cabin. I was 

ready to call it a night, when I called Charlie to see what his plans were for the evening. Charlie wasn't sure if he wanted to go down to the crew bar to have a couple 

drinks, so I convinced him. Once we got to the bar we saw our Production Manager, Matt. Matt bought us 2 rounds of drinks right off the bat. Then Charlie bought us a 

round. Then I saw my friend Adam (who was scheduled to leave the next day since his contract was up), so I bought him and I a round of scotch to shoot. He was with a 

friend who had a bottle of Evian at the table. He told me to try some, I opened the bottle and smelled it, I asked "Water?!", Adam and his friend started laughing "Yeah 

man, it's water, drink a gulp". I smelled it again, oh yeah, now I smell it...Vodka. I hate vodka. So I took a quick shot from the bottle. The rest of the night I was
