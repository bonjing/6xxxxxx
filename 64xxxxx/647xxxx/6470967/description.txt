This show is sort of a sequel to the movie (My Big Fat Greek Wedding), and I would recommend you watch the movie (Which I have also included in this torrent) before watching this TV series. 

This TV series only has One Season, and all 7 episodes are included in this torrent along with the Movie. 

It was hard to get a hold of this, so I had to rip the episodes myself from DVD. 

They are all good quality, the movie file is 640x336 resolution, and the TV series are 704x416.

Nia Portokalos is a newly-married modern woman caught in an old-fashioned world. From an early age, Nia was mortified by her family\'s patriotic, exaggerated ways. But when she falls in love and marries a non-Greek teacher, Thomas Miller, her family eventually learns to accept him and Nia learns to accept her family\'s meddlesome ways. Nia and Thomas return from their honeymoon to begin their new life together and find that it will include her overzealous extended family. The family includes Nia\'s father Gus, an opinionated man who owns a Greek restaurant called Dancing Zorba\'s; her mother Maria, the consummate worrier; her overly-protective brother Nick, a typically macho Greek man who works alongside his family as a cook at their restaurant; her Aunt Voula, a vivacious woman always full of advice, and her big-haired, big-mouthed cousin Nikki.
