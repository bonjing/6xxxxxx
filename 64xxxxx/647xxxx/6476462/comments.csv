Just for the others that may experience some problems...

SYstem might throw at you an error about physxcudart20.dll... don't have the link now but just google it and place it in the gam edir.. where the exe is located....

If you have no sound...
Change your hardware settings to be 5.1 or 2.1 setup... 4.1 isn't implemented...

this game seems to me like it has been leaked unfinished... it has a potential but... I don't know... feels awkward... why do I think that... for example you can order your teamates as you did in ME2/3, but it's not shown anywhere, but if you open up input.ini (baseinput, user docs folder scourgeinput.ini you can see that they are there and you can assign buttons to it yourselves. Also... you'll need to adjust mouse sensitivity, 'cause it is just crazy and in game adjustment doesn't do squat. You have a melee move too... but it is so awkward it can't be a finished move...


And lastly... as a side note... I've seen some awkward sprinting in games but this game (tested it with a girl there)... she takes the cake.... i (and the cake is NOT a lie!)swear... funniest looking sprint ever...

hopefully it helps someone out..."
