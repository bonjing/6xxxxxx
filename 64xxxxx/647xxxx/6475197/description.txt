Although she may have shed a stone, Julia has lost no weight with her latest release. Deciding to take a brief time out from the Sydney sibling partnership and ditch young Angus for a solo album of her own, Julia Stone has proven she doesn't need to rely on her brothers influence or input. 'Julia Stone In The Memory Machine' is a stunning individual debut from the Antipodean songstress, and, her second great album this year, following on from the duos highly acclaimed 'Down The Way'.
