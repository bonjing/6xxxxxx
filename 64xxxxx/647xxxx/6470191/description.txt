"Grayson Capps first discovered music in Alabama where he was born and raised. His father and friends would sit around the house getting drunk, telling stories and strumming acoustic guitars. They'd run down songs by Hank Williams, Tom T. Hall, Glenn Campbell and Woodie Guthrie to name but a few. The idealism of those Cannery Row experiences would come to define his outlook on the world."

This is the only official live dvd from the magnificent Grayson Capps. Full iso. I'll keep this one alive a couple of days... Then it's up to yall!
