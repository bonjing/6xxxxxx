Your activation key has been disabled due to security reasons: someone might have attempted to use the same activation key.

Please contact the Parallels support team for further assistance.

Anyone with better luck?"
[T],joskewarez,2011-06-23T21:07Z,"off course the serials are blocked after a few days, you have to block the connections with little snitch.
Never heard of a 'call home' ? If you're to stupid to use cracked software, buy it! "
,craziqbn,2011-06-26T07:05Z,"Everyone has to learn somewhere. Can you tell me how to ""block the connections"". No, I dont want to buy it and I am not stupid. But I could use your help..."

,Munkoli,2011-07-26T14:09Z,Just download 14 day trial until someone has the serial...
,fcoflores,2011-08-13T15:58Z,"Hi, thanks for sharing MAFIAA.
This (v6.0.12090) WORKS in Lion, but you have to do 2 things before installing:
-install little snitch (if you use pirated software as we all do, this is a must)
-add to hosts file the ip addresses 
         127.0.0.1 parallels.com             
         127.0.0.1 registration.parallels.com
         127.0.0.1 update.parallels.com                                                  
         127.0.1.1 pd6.blist.parallels.com 

you can do this, via terminal, or an application that shows you the invisible files, eg: transmit

and you're good to go"
,Rccm112,2011-08-14T14:54Z,"12090 works in Lion. Previous versions don't. After installing I accidently turned little snitch off once and I started getting the activation key disabled message. It took a while to get a serial to work again. I used the License cleaners from the Addict torrent. Edited my host files per these directions, turned little snitch back on, and went offline to install. When I installed parallels this time and used the NQT0GS-BS73JA-B03MF3-DBR8F6-58ZJWA serial everything worked perfect. Parallel Tools didnt update but I don't want to mess it up again."
,rubengarciajr,2011-08-21T01:30Z,"good advice there flores.. 

My 14-day trial was going to expire so I just delete it.  Installed Little Snitch, inserted those lines on the hosts file, and install this version.  "
,macmelt,2011-08-21T02:52Z,"fcoflores or rubengarclajr:
I'm trying to the hosts file step and am completely clueless.  What is a host file?  Is it on the Mac side or the VM Windows side?  How do I add the lines in Terminal?  Thanks!!!"
