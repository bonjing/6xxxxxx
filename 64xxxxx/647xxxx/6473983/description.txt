Ken Hamm is a Western Canadian blues and roots music artist with an international reputation. Emerging from early coffeehouses and Northern Ontario bluesbands, to festivals and concert halls, Ken has been playing professionally since the late 1960â€™s. He has a reputation as a dynamic, moving performer, mixing hot slide fingerstyle acoustic blues with original songs based on his travels and encounters.

Although Ken is as comfortable playing a house concert in your living room as playing on main stage, recent performances have included Edmonton Folk Festival, Calgary Folk Festival, Saskatoon Jazz Festival, and Vancouver Island Musicfest.
