The concert in LA was filmed by 3D movie production specialists PACE. PACE had already filmed 3D versions of SNSD and BoAâ€™s music videos but this was the first k-pop concert they filmed. 

The footage from SMTOWN Live 10 will be used to promote Samsung Electronicsâ€™ new 3D LED displays. In addition, the concert will also be shown in theaters in 3D. 

A representative from SM Entertainment stated, â€œThe movie will probably be released in theaters between the end of this year and the beginning of next year. We believe it will be popular, not only in Korea, but also in China and Southeast Asia.â€
