,xplorsonu,2011-10-19T23:09Z,"Thank you so much for this valuable material sir.....although I can never thank you enough. I feel very glad to see some of the comments from Indian guys here. I am to download the physics part of this upload although it is going to take me nearly a month cos I know that Mr.Jason Gibson is one excellent tutor and also he specializes in the dept of Electrical Engineering.....so it's going to be fascinating to see how he teaches Electricity and Magnetism. Btw,I am one of your big,proud fans sir Niek and I usually sign in to TPB to comment on your works..........I will always be grateful to you."
