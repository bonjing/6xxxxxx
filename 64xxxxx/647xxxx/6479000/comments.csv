Who can explain this to me?"
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-19T23:37Z,"That is because this has been ripped by different people, this one is SECTOR7 and other one is johnderina."
,OsakaHugger,2011-06-20T17:45Z,"So a different group rips it and the size is 2x larger but the quality remains the same? 
I'm really glad they rip but that difference doesn't seem right... "
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-21T07:31Z,"Depends on the ripper's mentality, what one opts for...
Size is nothing, compression is everything."
