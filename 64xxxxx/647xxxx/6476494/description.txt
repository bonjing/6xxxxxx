Chris Brown Ft. Justin Bieber â€“ Next 2 You Lyrics

Send â€œNext 2 Youâ€ Ringtone to your Cell

[Chris Brown]
Youâ€™ve got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
That you keep that smile.

[Justin Bieber]
Yeah, you are my dream,
Thereâ€™s not a thing I wonâ€™t do.
Iâ€™ll give my life up for you,
Cos you are my dream.

[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours,
You will never go cold or hungry.
Iâ€™ll be there when youâ€™re insecure,
Let you know that youâ€™re always lovely.
Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

[Chris Brown]
You had my child,
You make my life complete.
Just to have your eyes on little me,
Thatâ€™d be mine forever.

[Bridge]
And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
Iâ€™ll be there when youâ€™re insecure
Let you know that youâ€™re always lovely

Girl, cos you are the only thing that I got right now

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

[Bridge]
Weâ€™re made for one another
Me and you
And I have no fear
I know weâ€™ll make it through

One day when the sky is falling
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you
Ohh ohh ohh ohhhhh

[Chorus]
One day when the sky is falling,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.
Nothing will ever come between us,
Iâ€™ll be standing right next to you,
Right next to you.

Oh nah nah
Oh yeah
Stand by my side
When the sky falls
Oh baby
Iâ€™ll be there

Youâ€™ve got that smile,
That only heaven can make.
I pray to God everyday,
To keep you forever.
