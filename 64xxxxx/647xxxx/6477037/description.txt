A very long wait but finally our ears are graced with a new
album from Texas DOOM METAL lords, LAS CRUCES! This is
molten lead weight doom metal but never sticking to just
one formula. You get the absolute pummeling old style
Trouble doom in tracks like "Dusk", "Banished", and the
satanic witch doom of "Killing Fields". But Las Cruces
knows how to rock like f-ing hell while keeping the low end
and bulldozer mentality. Just witness the blow outs on
"Revelations" and "Cocaine Wizard Woman". Plenty of old
school San Antonio Joe Anthony rock influences creep into
some of the songs, but above all this band plays it all in
the HEAVIEST of fashions making for simply one of the most
enjoyable head bashings I've had in quite some time.
Welcome back lads now lets' get to crushing some skulls!!
Get it yee worshippers of old Trouble, Black Sabbath,
Solitude Aeturnus, Pentagram, Vitus, Blood of the Sun, Iron
Man, etc...


Support the artists! Support the underground! \m/
