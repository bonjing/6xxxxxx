It took me almost 30 hours to get them all.

Here's the whole set, all ready to go:

,LucyWoof,2011-06-15T22:09Z,"Wow, you were able to get all of them! Thanks! I'm still trying, my Internet speed is not very good."
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T09:39Z,"I got lucky and had advance notice so I was the first one 
there and had half of them downloaded by the time their 
server bogged down.

I have hooked this torrent up to my copies so now you have 
two seeds.  ; )"
,LucyWoof,2011-06-16T09:42Z,"It seemed like it took forever, but I created a new upload with all the files, see:

,LucyWoof,2011-06-16T09:47Z,"How do you connect torrents? Not sure what you mean, but thanks, it will take a long time for others to download. I'm just getting started reading... will take a long time to get through them all. The links you posted look interesting."
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T15:20Z,"I'll write a guide.  It can get complicated really fast.

If everything goes right the first time do it like so:
_____________________________________________
Merging a New Torrent with an Existing Torrent\
================================================================
1.a - When the files are all of the same set, set the download
location of the new torrent to the same folder as the first one.

1.b - When filenames differ use Relocate to point each file in 
the new torrent to the existing file.

1.c - At this point, Force Recheck to verify that the files are 
indeed identical. 

1.d - If all the files check out good Force Start the torrent,
sharing everything instantly.  You are done."

It's only 1.34 GiB (1442490549 Bytes), and looks clear and
complete on first inspection so you might prefer it."
,LucyWoof,2011-06-17T01:39Z,"Thanks for the explanations. Much appreciated. I'm reasonably technical about some things, but very little about torrent'ing..."

Just use HTTP without the S and it will still work."
