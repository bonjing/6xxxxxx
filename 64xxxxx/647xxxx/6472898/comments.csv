of files which are much smaller.  Hopefully this means 
they scanned with OCR to create searchable files.

I'm going to keep the originals anyway. You just can't 
replace the look and feel of the original copy, which is a 
great part of the reading experience.  Besides, we don't 
know if the new set has errors or is a highly compressed 
image scan instead of extracted text.

You've got a mix of the two sets here.  I'm going to grab the
new set from the Archives and make a new torrent for 
them, then hook this torrent up to files in each set to seed
the whole thing."

They definitely underestimated the demand, why I do not understand. All the stuff on that site, they do not have anything that describes the process they followed for providing these documents.

 I have slowwww Internet connection, so I am leaving this torrent as is."
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T19:53Z,"Okay, the full Slim Set is now online:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6474110

I am also seeding this one now with files from both sets,
except for a few which didn't match: Part-IV-A-4, 
Part-IV-C-6, Part-IV-C-10, Part-V-B1 and the index.
My copies checked out when I scanned all the pages
so I'm assuming they are OK for now."
