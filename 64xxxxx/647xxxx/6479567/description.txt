This is an image of Battle for Middle earth 2, Rise of The Witch King.
This is for getting around the random version that is experienced with cracked editions. 
Directions,

1. Download and install Daemon tools

2. Download and install YASU

3. Make sure you already have a CLEAN(not cracked) version of Rise of The Witch King installed.

4. Mount this image in daemon tools.

5. Start up YASU and cloak the daemon tools virtual drive.

6. Launch and play. This fixes the random version number that you get when you try to play LAN games with cracked editions and will enable you to play with other people over LAN(with separate CD keys of course).


I have tried my best to make this idiot proof, but just when I think I have succeeded they make better idiots. However, its possible that I made a(or several) mistakes, If you have problems leave a comment.
