The Pentagon Papers, officially titled ``Report of the Office of
the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force``, was commissioned by
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in 1967. In June of 1971, small
portions of the report were leaked to the press and widely distributed.
However, the publications of the report that resulted from these leaks
 were incomplete and suffered from many quality issues.

On the 40th anniversary of the leak to the press, the National Archives,
along with the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon Presidential Libraries, has
released the complete report. There are 48 boxes and approximately 7,000
declassified pages. Approximately 34% of the report is available for the
first time.

What is unique about this, compared to other versions, is that:

 * The complete Report is now available with no redactions compared to
   previous releases
   
 * The Report is presented as Leslie Gelb presented it to then Secretary
   of Defense Clark Clifford on January 15, 1969

 * All the supplemental back-documentation is included. In the Gravel
   Edition, 80% of the documents in Part V.B. were not included

 * This release includes the complete account of peace negotiations,
   significant portions of which were not previously available either
   in the House Armed Services Committee redacted copy of the Report
   or in the Gravel Edition
