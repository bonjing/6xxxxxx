 WOW. Done at CRF 20 this came out at 3831mb vs 2239 under the old 2 
 pass system. Clearly some rules need to be modified. 

 On a side note. As a resident of Vancouver, I am shocked and appalled
 at the conduct following the Canucks NHL loss this evening. As I 
 sit here and watch the news coverage and see shot after shot of fires
 in areas I regularly frequent and normally pass through at this time 
 of night and stores I've shopped at being destroyed. This is fucking
 disgusting and disturbing. If any of my friends are out in this, I 
 hope they are safe.
