,frank81211,2011-07-31T15:21Z,"i was able to download, it was pretty fast 
however i am unable to play the game.. it keeps asking me to insert the CD. 
any work around?"
,xax123,2011-08-05T09:07Z,it wont let me play it says i need a cd
,Nodwick123,2011-09-18T18:20Z,with the CD issue what you need to do is download a virtual disk drive (I suggest daemon tools seeing as how it works for me) download the torrent then mount it to the daemon disk drive..
,naruto000,2011-09-27T04:01Z,"DOWNLOAD THE GAME, AND BURN IT TO A DISK!"
,fifa4eva,2011-10-03T23:09Z,quite possibly the greatest rpg game ever made. diablo 3 will not live up to this i guarentee it. great game indeed
,Jamblaster,2012-04-21T05:05Z,"For anybody who does not know. This is how you play an ISO.

Step 1: Download and install Daemon Tools Lite (Free Version)--> http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite

Step 2: Download the ISO and unzip it if necessary.

Step 3: Click the little play arrow on the Daemon Tool Application on your desktop and browse to the location of your ISO and select it.

Step 4: Install the Game from the ISO (Just like you would if you had inserted an actual CD)

Step 5: Mount the ISO EVERY time you want to play the game.

That's it. Not hard, just takes the virtual drive and the ISO. "
,berrick,2012-05-18T01:32Z,"i got everything to work except when i actually launch the game the colors are all messed up and pixelated, idk how to fix it and i would really appreciate it if someone told me how"
,ironymon,2012-05-19T21:01Z,"Select exe right click properties and set to run at 16 bits and 800x640 or something. Also make compatible to windows xp or lesser. Not vista. Don't burn game into cd's thats a waste, just mount disk with magiciso or daemon."
