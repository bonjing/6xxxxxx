This is a request.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/

Red Cliff (2008)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/

Red Cliff II (2009)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326972/

The first one is the most critically acclaimed Chinese movie.
Red Cliff is the most collected Chinese movie.
But nobody cared to do them properly.
Don't limit them to 480p.
Do them in 720p.
It's because they are ancient Chinese martial arts and war movies presenting to you a great FEAST.
Please do reply."
