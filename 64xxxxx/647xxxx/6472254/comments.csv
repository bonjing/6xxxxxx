,AnonymousPuddi,2011-06-26T03:03Z,"Yo, 
I got the crack and the game to work itself.
One problem though that I found from a few other torrents.
When I start the game, I get a so much lag, it makes the game impossible to even start when it asks you to ""Press any key to Start"".
I downloaded the things to help make it preform better like Direct X.
I know it's not my Hardware.
Any ideas on how to fix this?

tl;dr ~ Game has to much lagg making it impossible to Start the game."

,MiragesMistery,2011-07-10T16:40Z,"Game works great, first times it was saying; Steam has to run and blabla. Later I added files from another download, then I only needed 1 dll file, and now it's running great! =D"
,tehhiphop,2011-07-10T21:55Z,"Okay, I'm getting a pretty strange error.  I can play through the first part and get past the twins.  But when I load the next level in the elevator my input devices stop working for the game.  The mouse won't move the screen, and none of my keyboard buttons work at all.  I've re-installed 3 times.  Any ideas?"
,dembuds,2011-07-16T19:16Z,does multiplayer not work? other than multiplayer everything works awsome. great torrent
,Zarkow,2011-08-03T17:17Z,"tehhiphop>> Many reported it over at steam forums too and the devs put out a message that they got it, but no fix sofar.

Sucks, I am at the same location."
,coiboi,2011-08-06T00:05Z,"Downloaded it twice and installed it twice. Runs slow and crashes. Not what I accepted from Skidrow. Download is corrupted or not enough data to enable game play.

,TyMod,2011-08-15T04:23Z,"Alright, got the lag issue, uninstalled and tryed to reinstall and now it will say Load_HooverDamned (final boss fight loading screen) is corrupt,  press ignore, retry or cancel.  Is this a game issue or when I moved the disc image to my external harddrive and burnt it I must have not let it finish.

Also,  how the hell do you patch the game.  I can't find a download anywhere AND the only other way I see how to patch it is by letting it connect to Steam.  I will try this on a new account and see how it goes..."
