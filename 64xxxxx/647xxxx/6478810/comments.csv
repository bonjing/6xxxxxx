,ruudoleo,2011-08-03T02:30Z,"Lulzsec forfills the plans HBGary described, Government infiltration to make hackers look bad.
Why are they against the publication of Breivik's document? His actions and views are questionable, but people should be able to decide for themselves.
Anonymous was until now a group which got respect, Lulzsec makes hackers look bad, they hack for the hack without real purpose."
