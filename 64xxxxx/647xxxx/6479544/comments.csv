,just2help,2011-11-03T17:54Z,"Frstly, I would like to thank to ""dohduhdah"" for such a good uploads! Keep the good work, 'cause knowledge should be free.
Secondly, request - is anyone able to upload Lecture 17: ""Marcus Aurelius - Meditations of the King"". That's ""4473_02_PRACT_PHILO_DISK_3.Title9.mp4"" file from this torrent, but as it is mentioned above it's not working. I personally tried to fix it, but with no luck. I looked for it all over the internet, but all uploads are the same - only that file is not working. Thanks in advance!"
