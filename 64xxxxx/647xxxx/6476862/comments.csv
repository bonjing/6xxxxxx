,badboy420,2011-06-18T04:39Z,"Patch 1.1

1. Fixed the free Troll Trouble DLC download. It is now included in the patch so there's no need to download and install it separately.
2. Fixed an issue that prevented some users from downloading other free DLCs (the ones given out with some pre-orders, special promotions, etc). The launcher now properly refreshes the list of available DLCs and allows for installation.
3. Performance improvements: approximately 5% to 30% better framerate and faster game loading for many users, depending on their individual systems and game versions. Owners of retail versions can expect the biggest improvements.
4. Fixed random crashes occurring on some systems, especially after saving and loading saves.
5. Key mapping â€“ allows the arrow keys to be used for movement.
6. Added the option to invert the mouse.
7. nVidia surround vision now works properly.
8. More accurate assessment provided by the ""auto-detect settings"" option will help improve game performance.
9. Removed a bug that prevented completion of the â€œBlood Curseâ€ quest.
10. GOG.com credits now work properly.

,GaBoi234,2011-06-18T05:43Z,fake as shit
,badboy420,2011-06-18T07:21Z,"Do some reading GaBoi234

I mentioned it only works with Gog Release.

So naturally it wont work with Skidrow or BlackBox releases.
"
,Ravaner,2011-06-18T15:50Z,There is no longer a need for Skidrows crack as patch 1.2 removes DRM so just update from a clean install
,GaBoi234,2011-06-18T17:25Z,guess i spoke to soon sorry about that
,max_planck_no_1,2011-06-28T05:44Z,"Awesome Badboy,


This worked perfectly! No DRM no crack.

Running smoothly on 5870 with ultra settings, no problems."
,Andi_911,2011-06-29T12:59Z,thx
,Denis_90,2011-07-03T15:15Z,this don't work for me
,lolman10,2011-07-05T06:11Z,"So just install these updates and we're good,no need to move files or anything?"
,badboy420,2011-07-06T07:45Z,"@lolman10


Yup.

Just install them after installing the Game.

Works like a Charm"

,strakha,2011-07-15T09:16Z,"I don't know about the gog release, but if you have the skidrow release you don't need this patch.  Copy protection has been effectively removed.  If you just click OK on the box that comes up asking for the serial number, the game updates itself with patch 1.1 and patch 1.2.

Then just launch.  No crack needed.
P.S. BUY this game, I intend to."
,ninotores,2011-07-17T05:00Z,"^ You're wrong.  

Skidrow's version of this game won't auto-update to 1.2.  

It only updates to 1.1 and won't go any further for some damn reason.  Check the witcher2.exe file-version for yourself.  

It's stuck on 1.1, and I can't find a manual download of the patch anywhere that's compatible with Skidrow's release.  Argh."
,bllorx,2011-09-04T00:20Z,"Is the above comment still true? I've got the Skidrow version and want to install the updates, but am not sure which set I can use!"
,Angryjoey,2011-09-22T16:44Z,"Atention fellow pirates!!!!!! PULL THE STICKS OUT UR ASSES AND QUIT BEIN SO FUCKIN PRISSY! Thanks for uploading bad boy 420
STAY FUN, STAY FAST, STAY FREE. but mainly
