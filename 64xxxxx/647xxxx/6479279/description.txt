Deerhunter - Rhapsody Original (EP)(2011)(Live Austin Annual Rhapsody Rocks SXSW Party)(MP3@256)










A Deerhunter listening experience is nothing short of hypnotic, but have you seen these guys live? Not only do they play with technical precision, they bring an intensity that steadily lifts their hazy melodies into the stratosphere. This 2011 set was recorded live in Austin at the annual Rhapsody Rocks SXSW party. The band opens with a squall of electrifying guitar that never lets up as frontman Bradford Cox alternates between bratty sneers, childlike croons and melancholic howls. Press Play and imagine yourself boiling in the Texas sun, Lone Star in hand, and you'll nearly be there.
