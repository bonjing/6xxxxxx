ReleaseNotes:

Slippery When Wet transformed Bon Jovi from minor-league poodle rockers to global superstars on the back of hit singles "You Give Love a Bad Name," "Never Say Goodbye," and, of course, "Living on a Prayer." From the scantily clad car-wash girls on the inner sleeve to the "You lost more than that in my back seat / Yeah!" lyrics, the album is blissfully untouched by irony and subtlety, which actually adds to its charm. With guitarist Richie Sambora and songwriter Desmond Child, Jon Bon Jovi has produced a slew of consistently memorable tunes,
and this album contains its fair share of them. Slippery When Wet won't change your world, but it will, undoubtedly, rock it. --Ronita Dutta

This is a REMASTERED recording from original CD. Originally released in 1986
