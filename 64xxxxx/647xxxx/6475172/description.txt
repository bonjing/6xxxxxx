plot

The film starts with a brief scene in Iraq where the Georgian contingent of the coalition forces saves the life of an American reporter Thomas Anders. After Anders loses one of his colleagues in Iraq, he returns to Los Angeles but soon goes to Georgia on the advice of some of his friends in Tbilisi, who suspect that a large conflict is brewing. He, along with his cameraman Sebastian Ganz, delve deeper into Georgian life as conflict escalates and they get caught in the crossfire when an air raid strikes a local wedding they stumble upon. With the help of a Georgian soldier who saved them in Iraq, their mission becomes to get their report out of the country to raise awareness of violence they've witnessed.
