Stop thinking start downloading. Then post again.

After downloading double click, the map you've downloaded it to will open.
right click on Kung Fu Panda 2 and choose: Play or open with =>> i recommend VLC"

The guy has CLEARLY mentioned that it's a Cam and not a DVD. He has not mentioned about it being a DVD Rip or a Screener or R5 or anything of that sort.

Its a free offer, no one is forcing you to download so if you want really really good quality then

1 - Go to the damn cinema and watch it. 
2 - Wait for the DVD to be released 
3 - STOP fukkin cribbing, for fukk's sake!

Pretty decent quality for a cam."
