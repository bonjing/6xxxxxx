Storyline: Years later, Johnny has become a stunt rider famous for surviving disastrous crashes during his stunts. Before a particularly dangerous new stunt, Johnny meets his childhood sweetheart Roxanne (Raquel Alessi/Eva Mendes), now a journalist, and makes a dinner date with her that evening. During the same time, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), Mephistopheles' son, comes to Earth to find the lost contract and use its power to overturn his father. To ensure himself allies, he enlists the fallen angels known as the Hidden, a trio of demon spirits who represent three of the four elements â€” the water-demon Wallow (Daniel Frederiksen), the earth-demon Gressil (Laurence Breuls), and the air-demon Abigor (Mathew Wilkinson). In response, Mephistopheles makes Johnny the new Ghost Rider, and offers Johnny his soul in return for defeating Blackheart. His powers as Ghost Rider revealed, Johnny is spirited off by his bike at high speed to a railroad station built in place of the graveyard where the contract was once buried. Johnny discovers Blackheart and his minions at the station and, assuming his Ghost Rider form, Johnny kills Gressil while the others escape. On his way out of the station he uses his Penance Stare (a technique in which all the violence a person has committed is suddenly turned against them) on a mugger, leaving the man catatonic; the mugger's victim gets away.
