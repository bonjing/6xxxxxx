1.Run Typex_config.exe & assign User Specific Controls(u can leave Remapping blank)
2.Run"" loader.bat"" & NOT ""game.exe""

It Will Work Fine :)

@all having problems, this game requires a powerful PC so if it's slowing down for you make sure you have a good pc and gfx card."

,thatbb6,2012-03-21T07:45Z,"How come not a single button works for this game? The only thing that is functional is the left click, which add coins.
I can't select a player or anything.
I tried launching by loader.bat. Then tried typexconfig then loader.bat but still doesn't work.
Help please?"
,touji_ryuuzaki,2012-03-30T13:48Z,"It had a 1-2secs delay on my tri-core 3.6ghz AMD home theater pc. Maybe because i was only using onBoard video.

I think this will work fine on any dual core pc 2.6ghz and above with a decent video card."
