fix Alice: Madness Returns umbrella glitch step 1 to 3 :
1--Go into your default config file found by Program files -> Origin Games -> Alice Madness Returns - The Complete Collection -> Game -> Alice2 -> AliceGame -> Config -> Default Input
2 : Find the line that says +Bindings=(Name=""E"",Command=""TriggerBlock true | OnRelease TriggerBlock false"" and change the E to whichever letter you want to be block; in my case I wanted G to be block so I changed it to: +Bindings=+Bindings=(Name=""G"",Command=""TriggerBlock true | OnRelease TriggerBlock false""
3 : Save your changes and close out of the config file
fix Alice: Madness Returns umbrella glitch step 4 to 6 :
4 : Start Alice: Madness Returns game; go to the configure controls option in game; reset controls to default
5 : Since default for block is now the key you assigned in the config the default controls will reflect it
6 :you can now change the remaining controls to your preference "

At the main menu(after you choose your save game, the one you named), where it says; Continue, Memories, Extra Content, Etc, Etc,... on the bottom right it says 'Equip'. Choose that then click on the Dresses then use left and right arrow keys to cycle through them.

I have been using the Fleshmaid dress, which apparently allows you to use 'Hysteria Any Time', but i can't figure out how to use it. =\

Are you sure you put the files in the correct folders? Using Theta's crack; you're not supposed to paste each file separately. You're supposed to just copy the main folder, then paste it in the main directly and it will put them in the proper folders automatically(the folders are already there)."

it means that its referring to new game protections... like this one ea core and a ubisoft drm with solidshield 

Something like: It's getting harder and harder to crack a game its actually true becuase companies wasting millions just to get a protection for the software and it will take more time to crack the game and they will add splash screens like razor1911 does 

and the game has missing triggers which crashes the game which needs a crack fix

,Halibuty,2011-06-22T12:11Z,"Clarify 2 things:

Mouse acceleration cannot be disabled!  All methods attempted.  The controls as bad as justcause2.  This is a console port, it is not a PC game, so don't even think about using a mouse to control it.  If you can stomach using a pad controller for this kind of thing you should be fine.  (I can't so it's just a waste of a download)

Second, the THETA crack is the better choice.  Delete all the executables in the /Core/ directory after installation, use that crack, and you should be able to play without typing in any registration."

,elvispco,2011-06-22T18:14Z,"*NUKED* ========================================

  We decided to proper the SKIDROW release now, because both the initial
  release and the subsequent crackfixes are sloppy to say the least.

  Their main release, due to a questionable source, contains a bad file in the
  following dir:

  \Game\Alice2\AliceGame\CookedPC\Maps\Chapters\Chapter2\Chapter2_W1

  RLD: 180a8798cab39b869889abee76a93b4a *Chapter2_W1_Bottle1_01_S.umap
  SR : fc3d31968697301eabf68e77192a146f *Chapter2_W1_Bottle1_01_S.umap

  Additionally, the crackfix that followed had severe calling-home problems,
  and firewalling or deleting the files suggested in the nfo of yet another
  fix is not a failsafe solution. The crack wont start when applied to a new
  install.

  Our crack works fine and does not call home.

  We present you with a proper release for the archives!

Seriously just go buy these games and save the rest of us who know what we are doing the hassle of reading your half wit comments about how you can't get something to work or that there is a ""virus"". 

Game was a semi let down. It felt just like the original alice in terms of movement and gameplay...just with updated graphics."
,redrumpanda,2011-07-14T00:55Z,"Works perfectly, and I've been playing it for over an hour with no problems except with the frame rate. Here's what you can do to fix it if you are having lag-like issues while playing. Go into settings at the main menu and turns physxs down to low. No idea why but it works. Also, go get the skidrow crack fix. Thanks to SKIDROW for all the excellent uploads, and all the hard work you guys do.

Does anyone have issues with saving the game?
I have no problems playing the game on my laptop.
Installed the Skidrow game and used the theta patch. No problems with the game except the irritating jumping stuff. But everytime the game crashes or i decide to stop playing and exit the game, my data is lost. Everytime i restart the game i have to start from scratch? that's kinda ridiculous if you ask me.
Anyone has a solution?"
,playnice,2011-07-14T21:14Z,i'm using a win 7 64 bit version btw. i've scoured the internet for solutions but none have worked. it doesnt even create the folder it's supposed to save into..

really want to play this game, but if i have to start from the beginning everytime i turn on the game i see no point in playing further..

does no one else have any similar problems at all?"

This is a line in the game. It means that, obviously, things are changing, representing her reoccurring memory into Wonderland. 

""Be sure you remember how spoiled you were!"" is a very obscure line; meaning that how great, or bad, the things were in Wonderland, she must always remember what's been brought about upon her."

,neilzzz01,2011-09-20T03:30Z,"Finally I got it installed and working...

What you need:
- Original Skidrow Crack that came from Iso Dvd
- Alice.Madness.Returns.Crackfix-SKIDROW
- CrackFix by Theta - CRACK ONLY

Note: [Very Important]
- You'll need to block the Activation.exe, EACoreServer.exe, EAProxyInstaller.exe, PatchProgress.exe from accessing Internet by Firewall Blocking, NOT by deleting them
- Before, I used BitDefender to block those file, but i realized its not getting the job done, so I Uninstalled it and change it to Kaspersky Internet Security 2012
- Crack it by copying the whole folder of Alice2, not one by one or file after file and OverWrite, this is the tricky part for me.
- After I Installed the Game and Applied all the needed crack and FireWall Blocking, EA Account Registration Windows appears twice.
- That time when i saw the EA Account Registration Windows pops-up i was ready to give up, but at the third attempt after i press Enter, BOOM! Nice I Finally Got it Working

- Mount or Extract the Iso
- Run as Admin the Setup.exe
- After Installed, Block the Activation.exe, EACoreServer.exe, EAProxyInstaller.exe, PatchProgress.exe from accessing Internet by Firewall Blocking, NOT by deleting them
- Now Copy the whole Alice2 Folder from Original Skidrow Crack that came from Iso Dvd to C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Alice Madness Returns and OverWrite
- Now Copy the whole Alice2 Folder from Alice.Madness.Returns.Crackfix-SKIDROW to C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Alice Madness Returns and OverWrite
- Now Copy the whole Alice2 Folder from CrackFix by Theta - CRACK ONLY to C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Alice Madness Returns and OverWrite
- Done... Hope this Steps Help you, Enjoy"
