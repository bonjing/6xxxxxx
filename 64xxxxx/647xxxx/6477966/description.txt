Release Notes:

Acclaimed performing songwriter Peter Bradley Adams will release his fourth solo
studio album Between Us on June 14 via Mishara Music. Adams, who co-founded the
neo-folk and Americana duo Eastmountainsouth with singer Kate Maslich-Bode a
decade ago, follows up his 2009 album Traces with this new eleven song
collection featuring guest appearances by vocalists Maslich-Bode, Katie Herzig
(who sings backup appropriately on the song "Katy"), Aoife O'Donovan (from
Boston new acoustic outfit Crooked Still) and newcomer Molly Parden.

Instrumental backing included work from guitarists Joe McMahan, Jonathan Trebing
and Lex Price -- each of whom shared production credits with Adams on various
tracks. Adams' songs have been featured on more than forty television shows and
film soundtracks and was named by the Wall Street Journal in 2008 as "one of the
21st century writers whose songs are worth exploring."
