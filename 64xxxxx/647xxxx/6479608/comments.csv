,Sattori,2011-06-19T21:46Z,All episodes are out of order! This one is probably a much more earlier episode than 8! Is it correct that these assholes at CBS already cancelled this show?
,djtazie1,2011-06-21T22:33Z,"Thank God someone else noticed there was something up with the order , i did a google on it and nothing came up , and  checked on IMDB and they all seemed correct , but it looks like this episode should be slotted in between 1 and 2... i was a bit freaked out at episode 2 as well wondering where the blonde came from and how she was so friendly all of a sudden ... anyone have the correct order for these ??  Its a good show , pity they messed up the order"
