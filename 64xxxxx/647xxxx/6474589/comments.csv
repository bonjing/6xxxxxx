The fucking names of the tv shows show up as Encoded with MiniCoder..

What.. you never heard of 2011's Best Video Converter? AVS Video Converter 7 or 8?

This is total Garbage !!

Movie Name : Enocoded with MiniCoder SHIT!

,xilbot,2012-02-28T05:21Z,@least 7 episodes the audio cuts out midway
,crysisftw,2012-05-26T19:38Z,"thanks for this amazing torrent bone! facing same problem though, audio missing in episodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16 and 17 towards the end. And i think episode 6 is missing altogether in season 9.

the missing audio is some problem on the part of my media player? what player should i use? (currently using pot player, used vlc media player too)."
