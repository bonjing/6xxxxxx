standard interface for controlling all of your simulation
tools. SynaptiCAD's timing diagram editors have the most
extensive and accurate timing analysis features available

correlation, reconvergent fan-out, and clocks that model
jitter and buffer delays. Three different levels of editing

application.  Free yourself from the time-consuming process
of manually writing Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC testbenches.
Generate them graphically from timing diagrams.SynaptiCAD

design needs. SynaptiCAD offers support for the latest test
equipment and emulation technologies allowing you to port
