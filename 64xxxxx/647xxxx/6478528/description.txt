[DESCRIPTION.]:
A team of engineers race against the clock to move a colossal
telescope, weighing over 100 tons, up 5000-metres to a
mountain plateau in Chile.

The telescope is part of an ambitious multi-million pound
construction project in the heart of the mountainous Atacama
Desert where 600 engineers and scientists are working round
the clock to build the worlds biggest telescope.

With parts arriving from all over the world at the 3,000 metre
base camp, they must assemble the telescopes to millimetre
accuracy to be able to hunt down planets that might harbor
life. With no vehicle big and sophisticated enough to transport
the awkward and delicate freight up 5,000 metres to the
mountain plateau, the team has to design a huge, 28-wheeled
transporter like no other. The journey up to the plateau
through the driest desert on earth is fraught with dangers.

Will the movers and machines cope with the extreme heat and
lack of oxygen on their long climb up the mountain?
