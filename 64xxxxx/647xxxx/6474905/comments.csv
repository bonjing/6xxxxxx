Malwarebytes reports it as a ""Trojan.Agent""

maybe its safe anyway... i dont know... malwarebytes sometimes reports clean files as infected, but usually it dont reffer to them as ""trojans""...

so to be 100% safe ill use it on a permanently disconnected (=no internet, or network at all) computer :-)"
