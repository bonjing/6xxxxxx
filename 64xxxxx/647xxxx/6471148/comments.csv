,mx5-kevin,2011-07-05T18:30Z,"antikhrist all this nonsense

1st vindows 95? MX-5 kevin folder? ISO file? where you read these?

Mx-5 kevin icon in my name above (the winrar program  you unpack the files if you dont have 
winrar). you do not need to install just unpack the rar arhive in program files and play,It 
does not ask for no cd, and dont need  any installation.What do you want to install a ready-packed program???"
,heatl0rd,2011-07-06T17:17Z,"Hi mx5-kevin,

just like to first off say thanks for the upload, however i am also having the same issues as antikhrist in terms of slowness. I simply just unRAR'ed it to program files and executed the ""ResidentEvil3.exe"" file. 

The game runs but is extremely slow!! in the opening scene when you start a new game. Jill finishes talking about 5minutes before the screen even jumps to the next scene. Tested your RE2 torrent and it works flawlessly.

Any ideas?"
,heatl0rd,2011-07-06T17:18Z,and yes its running in Windows 95 compatibility.
,mx5-kevin,2011-07-06T21:24Z,I have XP SP3 running on XP compatibility of the game.i do not change the compatibility and the game runs perfectly for me.
,heatl0rd,2011-07-07T13:01Z,"Got it working mx5-kevin,

Running it without any compatibility got it working. It was slow because i ran it in 95 compatibility like RE2 which caused the slowness. Thanks again.

p.s - do you know how we can skip animations? like the opening intro ect?"
,jfdc,2011-07-25T19:44Z,"`well done kevin,really great torrent,works perfect on vista 32bit,thanks for the memories man,great work!"

,BlueBomb,2011-08-13T03:42Z,"I've downloaded this game a long time ago in mininova and it worked perfectly. Now, with this link, the game runs with some lines on the walls and around the scenario. There is clearly a graphic issue, at least running in my computer..."
