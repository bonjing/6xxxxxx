,LAU4ENC3,2011-06-17T21:44Z,the file names are all too long. i couldn't add any of them to itunes without renaming them. the file for adam's team performance is so long that i can't even rename it or open it with any program.

,dmanthony,2011-06-24T23:08Z,"@LAU4ENC3: Do you have a second email account that I could mail you the track (8?) with a shorter name? I wasn't aware that some systems cannot handle long file names. What file system and OS do you have?

@Novadestin: What file will not open? They all work for me on each of my computers. (Mac and Windows)"

,dmanthony,2011-07-01T13:56Z,"I have just renamed all the files with shorter file names. This should address the problem of some people not being able to save or open the files on their system(s).
