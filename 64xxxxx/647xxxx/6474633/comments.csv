Could you do an MP4 version of Boardwalk Empire, by the way? Or ipod/iphone compatible or however you say it. I'm kind of a noob."

[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-19T16:46Z,"i'm looking for a good idx/sub vobsub ripper.  subrip doesn't work for these.  avidemux works, but its not nearly as good, basically sucks, but works.

subrip should work i would think, but it doesn't read them properly.  If anyone can point me to a good one that would be appreciate because as of late all of the subs are idx/sub. "
,lekkeralgemeen,2011-06-19T20:05Z,Best thing I found is this one: http://www.afterdawn.com/guides/archive/convert_subtitles_from_sub-idx_to_srt.cfm But since I guess you're not on Windows I don't think this will be very helpful.^^
