Game Description:

Protect America from enemy forces in urban and rural warfare throughout the world in SOCOM 3: U.S. NAVY SEALs, exclusively for the PlayStationÂ®2 computer entertainment system. For the first time in the SOCOM series, land and water vehicles play a central role in the gameplay experience. Vehicles are drivable by both players and AI and cover a range of military and civilian vehicles including tactical turret-equipped pickups and the SEAL-team configured military Humvee and SOC-R Assault Boat. 

The innovative new weapon customization system in SOCOM 3 allows players to use more than 30 different weapons and attachments, resulting in nearly1,000 different weapon combinations. The new Team Command Actions (TCA) allows you to quickly give your teammates context sensitive commands such as move to, breach, and more, simply by pointing at the location and pressing a single button. Combined with more complex team and enemy AI behavior, SOCOM 3 presents a fully immersive and more intense tactical experience than ever before.
