,torrent_inspector,2011-11-26T19:43Z,"Torrent is concluded Fake:
1. Virus is Patch, High Risk
2. Set-up is trial version
3. Patch does not appear to run"
,bob23456,2012-02-23T04:26Z,"My virus scanner deleted both the setup and the patch so I am going to assume they were viruses. At any rate, the only way to get this installed is to turn off my virus scanner and there is no way I am doing that."
