Summary:
__The United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of
Women (UN-Women) was established by General Assembly resolution 64/289 of
2 July 2010 on system-wide coherence, with a mandate to assist Member States and
the United Nations system to progress more effectively and efficiently towards the
goal of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women.

__This first strategic plan, 2011-2013, sets out the vision, mission and priorities
of the organization in supporting Member States and the United Nations system. The
plan is driven by a longer-term vision, goals and results to 2017, and it will be
reviewed in 2013. In line with the results frameworks of other United Nations
organizations, the UN-Women unified results framework contains three interrelated
components: (a) a development results framework, (b) a management results
framework, and (c) an integrated resources framework.

__The development results framework comprises six main goals, each supported
by defined outcomes, targets and indicators. Central to the realization of these goals is the coordination and support role of UN-Women within the United Nations
system. The goals are: (a) to increase womenâ€™s leadership and participation in all
areas that affect their lives; (b) to increase womenâ€™s access to economic
empowerment and opportunities, especially for those who are most excluded; (c) to
prevent violence against women and girls and expand access to survivor services;
