Donovan - Live in Portland, 1968

Memorial Coliseum

Portland, Oregon,

10/03/3, 1968

Very good AUDIO

FLAC



This is a pretty rare show that has not really been circulated until recently. Very good audience recording with minor background noise. The Donovan show is from Portland, Oregon, Memorial Coliseum October 3, 1968. Donovan is in tip top shape here. I got the CDs in trading so I can make wav files available if there are any takers - but I think flac is fine for the vast majority.
