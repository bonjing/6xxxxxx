PS: the sha1 sum of the file i have downloaded is different from the one you gave in the description :s"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-07-14T21:21Z,"yes,because ei.cfg has been removed,bro !
don't worry,anyway,this the real version.
i don't up fake version !
burn and install it and you will see that all will working fine,anyway.
btw,you can reenabled ei.cfg as well to get matching sha1 anyway,but you won't get multi-edition so.

To restore original MSDN Untouched version (as Ultimate ONLY), use the ""ei.cfg Removal Utility"" [http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/]. It will automate restoration of this modified iso to original TECHNET 2011/04/12 ""fr_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_677299.iso"", with genuine SHA1 & ISO/CRC as SHA1 : 5370BB44F497E1B19114C7CF70F5CDEF9F3A2582
and ISO/CRC : 4AA2D9BB. 

Tested and verified."

Good work mate. Keep up and thanks!"
