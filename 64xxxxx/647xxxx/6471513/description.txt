- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  RUINS is the latest release by the Polish post-hardcore sensation, Setting the
  Woods on Fire. Their 2009 debut saw this power trio from Warsaw hailed as one
  of the best bands in europe and this new EP is a step up again, maybe one of
  the best independent releases of the year. The material for the Ruins EP was
  recorded on analog tape at the Prusiewicz Sound Studio near Krakow. Having
  entrusted the mastering of their debut LP to the Appleseed Cast's Chris
  Crisci, the musicians have once again chosen to work with the best in the
  field â€” New York's Turtle Tone Studios. Michael Fossenkemper, who has worked
  with such artists as The Get Up Kids, The Casket Lottery, Coalesce, The
  Umbrellas, Brandtson and Dizzee Rascal, is the man behind the final sound of
  Ruins.
