An unlikely friendship forms between Richard, a failed novelist who has never quite grown up, and Abby, a 17-year-old girl whose role in a family tragedy years earlier has stolen away her youth. At the urging of his wife Claire, Richard has moved to a Long Island beach community for the winter season in order to overcome his writer's block. There, Richard meets Abby and hires her as a weekly babysitter, even though he has no children. Their tenuous friendship is sparked by Richard's awe over Abby's homemade soup and Abby's enjoyment of Richard's writing and his attempts at Origami. As the season progresses and the warm, the quirky friendship between Richard and Abby grows, the two begin to share with each other their dreams and life hardships.
