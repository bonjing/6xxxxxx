From the Infowars web site ::

 
Alex covers the latest breaking news, including the GOP presidential debate in New Hampshire where Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann declared her candidacy. 

Alex also covers the faltering economy following the plunge of the stock market and its momentary recovery. Other topics include follow-up news from the Bilderberg meeting held last week in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Obama's plan to expand his war into Yemen, and the latest police state developments on the home-front. 

Alex welcomes back to the show journalist and comedy writer Charlie Skelton, who covered the 2011 Bilderberg meeting.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
