,Korassu,2011-06-18T23:52Z,Ive really tried not to bug you again about the My Digs unlocks. But i really want to check them out before i uninstall the game(and i have no intention of reinstalling it). So have you checked it out yet? Have you given up on it? I'm really sorry for the trouble.
[T],ADHDerby,2011-06-20T08:11Z,"@ Korassu: I'm working at it,.. I've unlocked all achievements and the extras menu, but couldn't get the My Digs unlocks working (yet).

@ ninjachaz: No trainer needed,.. which version do you have?"

,rayquest9,2011-06-29T09:50Z,can u provide Civilization5 update 1.0.1.275 and viking dlc cheats pls
,DaGhoztReaper,2011-07-01T18:47Z,"Hey man, can you do a cheat to unlock all of the stuff of ""My Digs"" in the multiplayer section??

'Cause I don't want to spend my time playing multiplayer. Also, I DON'T want to hack multiplayer (infinite ammo,etc), I only want everything unlock if it is possible. "
,LOL_BRIEFCASE,2011-07-05T02:10Z,"I have the retail Steam version and I'm running into some problems. I can edit the user.ini file, but only if I change numerical values (like mouse sensitivity). If I add any binds, new lines, or anything, the entire file gets reset to the defaults. This includes your cheat pack; running the game immediately puts the default user.ini back.

I'm fairly certain the file is being encoded properly and I tried turning off Steam Cloud. It just keeps going back to the defaults. Any ideas?"
,crzy101,2011-07-05T20:38Z,"Steam retail version updated, disabled cloud, copied steam ini into remote, still does not work. The game resets the ini to the original every time without fail. I've tried like 5 trainers and none work. It's driving me crazy. "
,JINSON5,2011-08-08T03:42Z,"---------POSSIBLE FIX (steam version)------------
What i decided to do since  i couldn't change the folder permissions to writable instead of ""read-only"", was to open the user.ini file provided in the ""Cheat Enabler"" folder using word pad. I then right-clicked and copied everything on the word pad and opened up the user.ini the location ""Steam\Userdata\UserNumber\57900\Remote"" and just pasted the information from one pad to the other. It WORKED with NO problem. =) I OWN the steam version. "
,TyMod,2011-08-15T04:27Z,"Thanks ALOT!

Btw, does anyone know how to install the Steam patch for the game on the Skidrow release.  I can't find a download ANYWHERE.  Did Gearbox ONLY release the patch for Steam? If so that's shit."
,zyonix,2011-08-25T02:21Z,Only the F commands are working. Halp?!
,YourMumhasadick,2012-01-08T16:36Z,Not working for me on Steam retail version have disabled steam cloud in both steam settings and update tab under properties of the game copy correct user.ini from steam folder (have tried both update 2 and update 3 torrents). Have tried the copy/paste of the text from wordpad into the file still no joy - file still keep being overwritten arghhhhhhhhhh!!
