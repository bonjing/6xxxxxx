[V],DownTYU,2011-06-16T18:14Z,"Its because of low seeds, and very very high peers.
You can't do anything but wait."

[V],DownTYU,2011-06-21T07:34Z,"@FRivera

Remember this is a passive dvdrip."
,FRivera,2011-06-23T17:06Z,"I'm not sure what a passive DVD rip is even after googling it, but whatever it is I prefer to use the same rating system for everything to keep it simple and clear to every1."
,FRivera,2011-06-23T17:08Z,"I googled passive DVD rip, nothing came out. 

Whatever it is, methinks one quality rating system for all formats is the simplest and clearest way to go."
,FRivera,2011-06-23T17:09Z,"oops, too many comments. oh and 10x again, the effort is nonetheless appreciated."
