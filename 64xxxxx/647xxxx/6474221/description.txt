Pinkpop 2011
============

A pretty much complete coverage of the 2011 edition of Pinkpop Festival. As always, there were a few bands that didn't give
permission for their gigs to be broadcasted live through the mainstream (30 Seconds to Mars, Volbeat, Deadmau5 and several others)
but pretty much all performances are complete.

Other then last year, two of the headliners could be watched live through the livestream, except for Coldplay, which is only
available in an one hour edit of their 1,5 hour performance.

There were some technical difficulties but the majority of those issues were due to the incompetence of the engineers of the public
network, of which Cultura is part from. Somewhat 'understandable', since the Dutch public network is facing some major budget cuts
so the expensive and experienced engineers are being laid off and replaced by cheaper and inexperenced ones.

On my end, there were only two performances (Tim Knol and All Time Low) where the stream couldn't handle the weight, so they are the
only ones with a part 1 and a part 2.


All footage were taken from the livestream and the image quality is acceptable if you don't have any high definition expectations.
