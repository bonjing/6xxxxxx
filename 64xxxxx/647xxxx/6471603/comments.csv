,EgilGO,2011-07-25T01:25Z,Thanks! =)
,EgilGO,2011-07-25T01:27Z,Btw: I can't imagine why this has a quality score of -7. The picture and sound is great and this release deserves way better score than that.
,Blank_0,2012-02-09T16:23Z,The upload is perfect. The quality score is ridiculous. I suspect the reason is the lack of some c*appy english dub you could find in any other release.
