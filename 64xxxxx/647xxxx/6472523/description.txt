The Death Gate Cycle is a seven-part series of fantasy novels written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.

The main conflict is between two powerful races, the Sartan and the Patryns, which branched off from humans following a nuclear/anti-matter holocaust.

The books follow the fiercely independent Haplo, a Patryn agent sent to scout the elemental worlds and throw them into chaos in preparation for his Lord's conquest of them.
