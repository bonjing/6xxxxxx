    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Train  Driver,  developed  by  the experts at Railwaves, is a brilliant
    standalone  simulation  of the West Somerset Railway. It uses the tried
    and  tested Trainz software 'engine' to bring this vintage line to life
    on  PC. The diesel and steam engines, all 23 miles of track and the ten
    accurately  modelled  stations  are  all  included and ready to drive â€“
    straight  from  the box! As a bonus, owners of Trainz Railway Simulator
    2006 and Passenger Edition can use Train Driver as an expansion and add
    the   West   Somerset  Railway  to  their  existing  Railway  Simulator
    operation.
