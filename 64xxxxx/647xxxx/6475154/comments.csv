,haze360,2011-06-17T12:51Z,thk dude is teh game any good??? is look great by the looks of itt....japanese videogameartist??Âż?
,abernick00,2011-06-17T13:12Z,"how about you get LT 1.9, like most ppl??? i know it just came out, but i was all over that one!  Games can only update their own content.... if you are logged inonline and see an update, STAY AWAY!!  i believe that they wont be updating the dash via releases anytime soon, unless i missed something.... 1.9 works great for me sooo far!"
,silent69,2011-06-17T14:47Z,I know  Lt v1.9 works great but i have not yet upgrade thats the reason in asking if the games asks for update (dashbord) for people yet on lt+ 1.1. And Since  GOW3 is going to need lt 2.0 im not in a hurry to update for if i can play this game on still on lt +1.1 and prĂŠ latest dashboard.
,silent69,2011-06-17T14:49Z,whats abgx wave report? wave 10th-11th or 12th? 
,haze360,2011-06-17T18:57Z,seed people!! 625 LEECHERS and !/ SEEDERS what the fuck people are gready...=(
,Krock0,2011-06-17T19:13Z,"I confirm . No update of the dash .No AP 2.5 .
Works great on LT 1.0 ."
,abernick00,2011-06-18T06:36Z,"The games WILL NOT and CAN NOT update the dashboard or reset your firmware, people!!!  if you are asked to update after starting up a game, it is just adding things to improve gameplay, options, etc.....  if you log into Xbox Live and they ask you to update AGAIN, then most likely it is another attempt at sending the drive firmware back to factory.... no news of this yet.   I have 1.9 as of yesterday and it has worked like a charm! Other than having to Re-Burn all AP 2.5 titles and Re-Running them through ABGX360....  Playing online should be kosher as well, but i havent tried it due to lack of time....  "

Yes this game is finger-licking good. I don't know what the developers have been smoking but I sure would like some of it. Thanks for the upload!"
