
 Seven different cartoon stars appear in their own series of animated shorts
 each week. "Milton the Monster": Professor Weirdo, the mad scientist, and his
 assistant, Count Kook, live on Horror Hill with the three monsters they
 created: Heebie (a skull-faced monster with long hair and formal dress),
 Jeebie (a green-furred creature with one eye and one sharp tooth) and the
 uselessly kind and gentle Milton the Monster. "Fearless Fly": Hiram is a meek,
 mild and passive little fly until he dons a special pair of eyeglasses that
 give him super-powers. The inscrutable Tibetan wizard, Doctor Goo Fee, and his
 faithful servant, Gung Ho, make every effort to destroy the super-insect.
 "Flukey Luke": The cowboy private eye, Flukey Luke, fights the mobster, Spider
 Webb, with the help of his trusty horse, Pronto, and his faithful friend, Two
 Feathers, the American Indian with an Irish accent. "Muggy-Do, Boy Fox": The
 wily boy fox has an endless number of schemes to make a dishonest buck. "Penny
 Penguin": The bratty little Penny gives her father no end of grief. "Stuffy
 Durma, the Millionaire Hobo": The filthy rich former hobo wants nothing more
 than to go back to his old life; but his secretary, Bradley Brinkley,
 continually thwarts his efforts.
