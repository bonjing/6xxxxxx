Storyline
Friday and Streebek are assigned to some very strange robberies, like i.e. the stealing of one bat, a 30 feet long snake and the mane of a lion from a zoo. All the latest BAIT magazines were also recently stolen, and some chemichals that when are mixed correctly develops a very deadly gas. All these thefts have one thing in common; visit cards with the word \"PAGAN\" left at the crime scenes. Solving these crimes, including why plenty of police vehicles have been stolen lately, involves the usual; to drink coffee at strip tease bars, rescue kidnapped virgins from drowning and lose the job.
