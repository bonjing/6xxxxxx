(DanniGirl of the Month- December 2007) I have a sweet neighbor. She's this old lady who once gave me a can-opener when I asked to borrow hers, and regularly asks if I would like some of her homemade tamales. You can say I'm lucky, but my neighbor is no Shay Laren! That's a blessing afforded to Crystal Klein, who saw how hot Shay was and proceeded to send her pictures out to the world, resulting in a coveted Penthouse Pet of June 2006 title. Living on the island paradise of Maui, Shay keeps her bodacious 36D-28-35 chassis tuned with regular visits to the beach. She's a surfer-girl, a snorkel-chick, and a spear-fishing mermaid, all in one totally gnarly bod. Her taste in music reflects her humble abode, as she digs such bands as Sublime, The Stones, The Doors, Tom Petty, and my personal favorite, Led Zeppelin. You can see that I am quite enamored by this sultry presence known as Shay Laren, as I'm certain you are too. After all, not only is this CK discovery beautiful, smart, and funny, but her breasts happen to be all-natural! Wipe the drool from your chin dude, and sing it with me now, "Would you be mine? Could you be mine? Won't you be my neighbor?"
