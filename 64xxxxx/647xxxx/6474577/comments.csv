,BennyPshj,2011-06-17T05:56Z,This file is missing the last 10 mins- the 2nd 10 mins being repeated.
,PhilLesh12,2011-06-17T07:17Z,"It's actually the 4 minutes that gets repeated.  20:00 to 24:00 repeats again, at 24:00-28:00.  Whatever happens after 24:00 is missing.

Also, it is missing probably 4 minutes from the beginning.

But this is the same across all torrent sites, this is how it was released by the scene.  Hopefully there'll be a REPACK or FIXED release soon."

,hippopotamus23,2011-06-17T23:50Z,"Viewers in UK can watch it on BBC iplayer until the proper (hopefully) comes out. Its only a short bit from the beginning and short bit from the end missing here. 

Cheers TvTeam for this and in advance if yous are indeed releasing a fixed one.

Fitting the scenes repeating glitch occurs shortly after Cartoon Head and Jess experiment with some ketamine :)"

,Tinny_pb,2011-07-22T11:39Z,"Like others have said, this file is faulty, with a few minutes missing from the end. I dunno if 4 minutes are missing from the beginning ... more like 4 seconds. The rest still plays well: V8 A9."
