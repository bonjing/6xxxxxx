,Caliokami,2011-06-24T09:04Z,"i have put them both on disks and installed it properly but it keeps coming up please insert correct disk
im not sure what to do, or what happened can you help please?
and what do you mean by copy over crack?"
,New_B,2011-11-22T22:10Z,"If i'm correct he means there's the already cracked version of serial code already in a .txt file on CD2 -as Cerebral222 has fore mentioned- that you can copy and paste in the boxes when you need to input the serial number, or you just copy and past that inside the program files when choose the ""View files in Folders"" option and paste over that part.

At least, I think, I haven't gotten to see what i mean, so i could be dead wrong Caliokami."
