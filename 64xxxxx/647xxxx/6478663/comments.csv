,deviantdigi,2011-06-18T18:35Z,500 kbs 30 min atm
,deviantdigi,2011-06-18T19:07Z,"Great torrent.

Working on Win7 32bit (P4 3.4ghz/2GBram/7900 GTO 512mb). 

Scanned clean AVG 2011 and nothing suspicious. 

Easy install."
,clearfox7,2011-06-18T19:42Z,"@emaszs i would imagine there's an option in-game to do that. i haven't finished downloading yet so i'm not sure. ps, i will definitely seed for a while :D"
,lanusick,2011-06-18T21:24Z,does this game support lan?
,Bill_Oreilly,2011-06-18T23:43Z,All of the cards are unlocked. Kind of a bummer. Maybe someone can re-upload without the cards unlocked?
,wizyy,2011-06-19T02:01Z,"Here's what I did to start a game without any unlocked cards:
From SKIDROW crack I copied just skidrow.ini and magic_2012.exe to game folder, and launched steam (smartsteam also worked).
After that, I started magic_2012.exe.
Hopefully all will be well and saved, I'm off to play now.
Happy gaming!"
,Bill_Oreilly,2011-06-19T02:52Z,Thanks wizyy!
,jimbobso,2011-06-19T03:27Z,"I downloaded this and copied the files like it said..  Tried running the game, and it said I needed 2 DLL files... I got them, and I still can't get the game to start up... Any thing I'm missing?  Can anyone help???"
,jimbobso,2011-06-19T03:31Z,Wrote a comment... don't know where it went... I downloaded this... followed the steps.. and its not opening.  It said it was missing 2 DLL files... I got them and still nothing.. Can anyone help??
,wizyy,2011-06-19T04:20Z,"Some people say that using my method game cannot be saved:
My game is saved using method described, BUT I had first Duels of the Planeswalkers bought on steam, and I've noticed the game refers to me with the Steam username I have on legally bought first Duels game.
I've also tinkered with Smartsteam, since it seems that any game legally bought on one account can be used on another with Smartsteam and saved gamefiles...
I will most likely buy the damn game - after all, it's only 9 euros :)
Sorry I can't be of more help."
,Kueyjin,2011-06-19T07:33Z,"i have the same problem as jimbobso
when i finish the process it says i need 2 dll files so i got them but then the game crashes i do not know what am i missing."
,Kueyjin,2011-06-19T08:38Z,I found the solution to the dll problem and runing the game with the problem you need to install the latest Direct x update from the game foulder called prereqs.
,Lozaro,2011-06-19T10:35Z,It would greatly help if the crack was included with this torrent. Anyone know where to find it?
,Lozaro,2011-06-19T10:43Z,"Before anyone even says anything, the torrent does NOT have a skidrow folder in it. All it has named Skidrow is a System Info. "
,Lozaro,2011-06-19T10:55Z,"Nevermind, found it. This one was hidden unlike other torrents I've done >>"
,random123,2011-06-19T14:02Z,There is a SKIDROW folder on the ISO. It contains a crack and some other files. Works 100% on 64bit win 7.
,wizyy,2011-06-19T16:14Z,"I tested it again on another computer - just copy magic_2012.exe and not another file from skidrow crack, start steam with your username and campaign will save.
Just play with the same username logged on steam every time."
,nesbigbasher,2011-06-19T22:21Z,"I am an udder torrent noob, all I see when I open the file is all the rar's and a .sfv What am I supposed to do? Granted I know how iso's work, just don't know where to start."
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-06-20T02:54Z,"Install Winrar (google it) and unpack the rar files then you will get a ISO, burn / mount ISO and have fun!"
,Aerionix,2011-06-20T05:50Z,"wizyy's method does work.  used smartsteam, copied over those exact files, opened smartsteam first, then ran magic_2012.exe.  working, decks locked, saves functioning.  

The other method making the rounds involves running smartsteam and running mtg from the library.  This will make the game work although not allow saves.  (and supposedly enable multiplayer although I've yet to hear from someone actually able to get in an actual duel).

,endemoniada,2011-06-20T08:45Z,"I can't beleive all the cards are unlocked, wtf is that? I don't have a Steam account and I really don't want it on my system so I guess I am out of luck in reseting the progress ? Skidrow fucked it up this time."
,Funsom,2011-06-20T13:39Z,The Theta release has the cards still locked as intended. 
,Creqaw,2011-06-20T15:18Z,So you need to have steam running to be able to save decks?
,Yoni__,2011-06-20T20:25Z,"Getting an ""Unkown error"". Everything installed correctly on win7"
,macpcmax,2011-06-20T21:21Z,who knows any way to play online with this torrent?
,Funsom,2011-06-20T22:36Z,"You can't play online, obviously. You realize this is a cracked game, right?"
,Dajmkrysset,2011-06-21T01:46Z,"Am I the only one that cant get past the first boss Koth without any unlockable cards ? I've set the difficulty to Mage which i asume is Easy.

I also cant seem to see my mouse arrow thingy and cant change the controlls from arrows to mouse.

please tell me im not the only retard.."
,Taute,2011-06-21T13:43Z,"There was a problem - have done everything as it is written (antivirus not deleted files), but for some reason does not play the game, writes that no steam. Maybe some help? Initially, the signature ""AppId error, then, as if it already connects the game (the game menu background is visible), but soon, after a few seconds off the game and the signature of the absence of steam."
,dopeydave420,2011-06-21T20:17Z,"Also to run the game and reset the game progress do what the other guy said, just copy the exe from the  crack nothing else but you can run steam in offline mode and it works to. i do havea  steam account still from some old cs gaming but nothing new on it since then it does work tho thanks for the info other guy figured id just add this tho."

,Aledd,2011-06-21T23:09Z,Does this work on LAN?
,shonofthedead,2011-06-23T12:48Z,"Great torrent, everything is working fine. I do have one problem though. All of the decks are unlocked, haven't played this game before and would like to start right from scratch. Is there anyway to start from the beginning, with no decks unlocked?"
,deviantdigi,2011-06-25T01:06Z,To play with card unlocked. You have to have steam running. Just copy the Magic.exe crack over to your dir. and start the game. Saves work for me.
,shonofthedead,2011-06-25T13:08Z,"If you want to play at the beginning with no cards unlocked: After installation copy/replace the Magic.exe in your installed directory with the one in Skidrow folder, on the disc. only copy/replace the .exe, nothing else from the skirdrow folder. Then run Steam in Offline Mode click ""Games"" then ""Add a Non-Steam Game to my Library"" find and tick Magic the gathering dotp. then you can play through steam, in offline mode."
,brucenasty,2011-06-25T18:43Z,"Okay, so I mounted the iso. But when i go to run it, it gives me ""Application load error 5:0000065434"" any tips?"
,brucenasty,2011-06-25T19:09Z,"also, if i add it to steam,  get (error code 54) can anyone give me some help"
,bobbbby,2011-06-26T15:32Z,"shonofthedead's tip fixes the issue with unlocked decks.

I can confirm that progress is also saved."
,BoneMonkey,2011-06-27T19:52Z,"Can anyone PLEASEEEEEE tell me where this game saves to?

I want to start the campaign over but can't I even uninstalled the game with no luck 

Also how do i play with no cards unlocked and I do not have steam installed on this machine at all 

thank you if anyone can help me!"

,dvega66,2011-06-30T01:25Z,"Cheers for the upload works perfect.

The game is a pile of dogshit"
,Fenrore,2011-07-09T06:02Z,The torrent no longer contains the crack files can sumone reup?
,Banzay27,2011-07-13T19:56Z,"Good torrent. Good game. Well, it really feels better than the last Duels of the Planeswalker - though not better than the 2nd last, that old from way back when that played similar to Heroes of Might & Magic. ;)

You don't need to do jack except follow the instructions to the letter to get the unlocked cards.
Someone said to only copy the .exe crack to not have the unlocked cards. But why would you want that, really? I wasted much more time than I should have on the last DotP unlocking each decks' damn cards. I couldn't beat the other opponents with their unlocked decks if I hadn't my own.
If there were enough different matches to unlock all cards, then fine. But there aren't, you're forced to repeat matches.
Screw that, SKIDROW was right to crack-unlock. Kudos to them.

Only one problem I've had: freezing. It's happened twice now, freezing when the AI opponent is one of his phases and processing what to do. First time was negligible; a bad precedent, but I was gonna lose anyway (Tezzeret's deck is annoyingly efficient); but 2nd time around, just now, I was winning, had him already 1 and myself at 18 even if I did lose all my creatures. Lotsa lands, though... I had him. And it froze. Bah!
Hopefully, it only happens with Tezzeret. But... fat chance."

,taiiat,2011-08-07T21:18Z,"Installs fine, tried suggestion of some comments, runs fine with steam running, with only the cracked executable. decks save fine. 
i haven't recieved any errors or anything. 
also the cards weren't already unlocked.
playing cracked games ""online"" has been and always will be fine so long as you use VPN's.
the only minor complaint i have is that the game pauses at the end of a match, at a win or a loss, then some seconds later shows the win or loss banner. might be how the game is written, might be the crack. "

,iAmburnJ,2011-09-19T10:39Z,"""AppId Error"" ""No Steam"" FIX

This worked for me, I hope it works for y'all. If you are running Windows 7 64bit, and were unable to download the Windows Redistributable 2008, this may be your issue. As it was for me. The ""vcredist.exe"" installer included with the game is only compatible with a 32 bit system. So...

http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=2092

Download this and it should work. Good Luck! Let me know y'alls results. "
,iAmburnJ,2011-09-19T10:51Z,"As for the ""X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing""...

This is an issue with DirectX. Although I already had DirectX installed, I was unable to use the installer included in the ISO. I can only assume my Windows 7 64bit was not compatibility with it either. Be sure to Google a DirectX installer so you can run this game.

Any other issues should just be your inability to install/crack properly. Have fun :) "
,andhaunted,2011-10-04T01:01Z,This game is awesome. It needs DLC immediately. 16 decks is not enough.
