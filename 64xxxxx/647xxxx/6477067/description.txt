If you're looking for hits, you're in the wrong place. 
Don't be scared offâ€”if musical artistry is what you seek, you've found itâ€”but all of Chic's hits are on The Best Of Chic package, which you're urged to pick up without delay if you don't already have it. 
That collection shares with this one the distinction of containing some of the most elegant, exquisitely played music you'll ever hear.

This collection spotlights some of the most intriguing of these stylistic departures: the hard-edged, strip-mined funk of 'Hangin',; the offbeat 'Your Love Is Cancelled,' which resembles nothing so much as Rick James' 'Super Freak,' and the gorgeous acoustic guitar showcase 'Tavern On The Green,' from the soundtrack of the film Soup For One. 
Also in evidence is the aching melancholy Chic conjured up on the ballads 'Will You Cry (When You Hear This Song)' and 'At Last I Am Free.' And there are classic Chic dance tunes like '26' (as in 'on a scale of 1-10 my baby's a 26'), 'Stage Fright,' and 'You Are Beautif          (From Liner Notes)
