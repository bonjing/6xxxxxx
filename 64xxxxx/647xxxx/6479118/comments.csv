,16peela12,2011-06-19T06:47Z,"@ blaze69  Dude i know. But that version is as old as my great grandmother. That is why i was talking about newer version. there were like 5 update after that(or more) and they r not available anywhere.ANYWHERE.

And thnks for the movie. will watch. "
,thegodoflions,2011-06-20T04:16Z,"is it just me or are all the cards already unlocked?
all the decks are unlocked + 16/16 cards for each deck.
so i guess theres nothing left to accomplish on this game except play it."
,Aerionix,2011-06-20T04:41Z,"yeah, the skidrow crack seems to unlock everything..  hopefully a better one hits soon.  there is a workaround, but with that, the game doesn't seem to save.  So if you can finish the game in one go, then use the skidrow stuff, you're laughin.  other than that, gotta wait for a fix it seems.  Thanks as always extremezone"
,Khepesh,2011-06-20T05:42Z,"What are the chances this is playable online without some sort of keygen?

Appreciate the upload regardless. Been wanting to test out this game for awhile."
,Khepesh,2011-06-20T05:51Z,"Looks like my old post was deleted. I don't really know the rules to tpb yet, so I'll just retry with a better choice of words.

Is this playable online directly after download?"
,pygmis,2011-06-20T10:48Z,"Ty for the nice torrent. I wasn't going to pay anything to these guys after how they treated the buyers of original dotp. They don't fix any bugs and when they do they make it a new game and you need to pay again. And even this one has lots of bugs and no fix in sight :/

So much potential wasted with no customer support."
,16peela12,2011-06-20T21:12Z,No online play doesn't work
,Taute,2011-06-21T16:25Z,"There was a problem - have done everything as it is written (antivirus not deleted files), but for some reason does not play the game, writes that no steam. Maybe some help? Initially, the signature ""AppId error, then, as if it already connects the game (the game menu background is visible), but soon, after a few seconds off the game and the signature of the absence of steam."
,jlkf3,2011-06-21T22:14Z,How long does it take for the free card to arrive? :-P
,eliten880,2011-06-23T00:11Z,why can't I download the file? It says no input file specified

,Z-Byte,2011-06-24T23:41Z,"SKIDROW is just a .nfo file.  There is no folder to copy anything from.

Help?"
,Z-Byte,2011-06-24T23:55Z,"Funny.  My comment disappeared.  

Where is the Skidrow folder?  I don't see it in the download."
,deviantdigi,2011-06-25T01:03Z,To play with card unlocked. You have to have steam running. Just copy the Magic.exe crack over to your dir. and start the game. Saves work for me.
,anon1978,2011-07-03T11:11Z,"This worked, and installed fine

I really love magic.  I tried playing this for half an hour (at the 15 minute point I wanted to pull my hair out) at the half hour point I just didn't care.

You can't see your cards, the interface is fucked.  Wow.  You have to zoom in every time to see the deck that was dealt you, or arrow left and right to see them all.  What in the hell?  What a peice of shit game.  The older one is 10 times more playable and fun."
,TRiXTeR67662,2011-08-09T13:23Z,"Hey all! Sorry but I am Just learning all this so I may have messed up one of the steps because I am getting an error message that reads......""The program can't be started because X3DAudio1_7.dll is missing from your computer"". If anyone can explain what it is that i need to do to remedy this please do, either on this comment board or e-mail me at andreworona25@yahoo.com. Thanxs"

,cogri,2012-04-07T15:55Z,Can u pls get expansions for this?
,darxide23,2012-04-21T17:09Z,"Great game, but I wish it had the expansion and the 3 DLCs. I've played the hell out of the base game."
