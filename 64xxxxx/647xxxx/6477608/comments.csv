Please let me know if it is A) because people are frustrated that I've had so much a/v trouble in the past, or B) if maybe you think people want it in a different format, and if so, what format would you want it in?  I have been processing these for quick easy access when I am on the road and I figured that anybody looking for Oreilly Factor downloads would be either A) excited to get whatever they could, and/or B) in a foreign country or without sufficient tv service to get the show so they might be downloading it over a very slow connection."
