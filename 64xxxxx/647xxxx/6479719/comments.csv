Been downloading this now for 36 hours and still only at 12%."
,beccyd,2011-06-20T17:17Z,"Bollocks to this load of crap, still says another
1 year 28 weeks and 3 days to go, what a joke."
,SonOfBasuto,2011-06-20T20:29Z,"Hey,  RedDr4gon - are you going to seed this? Mine has been stopped at 12% also. We can't see the 2000 amazing WWII pictures without a little help here."
,zyzykwy,2011-06-21T04:41Z,"The few I got look great, but please seed as 12% is not much of such a collection."
,bbzlov,2011-06-24T04:01Z,Please seed. Leeching bastards...
,bbzlov,2011-06-24T13:07Z,"Seeders:
0
Leechers:
201

Really guys? Not even the Leechers are seeding... Take off your uploading limits, be a real pirate."
,zyzykwy,2011-06-25T17:41Z,I've been stuck at 12.7% since this started and so is all the leechers.  My prog says as many as 20 seed but none ever go online.  Who is getting this and why aren't they sharing?
,Airvelt,2011-07-04T10:05Z,"For the guys who planted the seed (pun intended)
Please reseed. This is no good!"

if you are getting it in six hours, can you stay online and let the rest of us get it too?  I've been stuck at 12.7% since it was first started as all the seed seem to go offline the instant they get it.  Can anyone get more than 12/7%?"
,Rednol,2011-07-16T02:31Z,"It looks a bit fake. 2000.. 1980 x 1200, and then 170 MB?"
,bbzlov,2011-07-19T00:54Z,I'm 11.8%... I downloaded this the day it came out... I mean really guys? I'm seeding to people at 300kb/s... Could everyone else please do this.
,zyzykwy,2011-07-30T23:49Z,"still stuck at 12.7%, so is everyone else.  also shows anywhere from 10 to 40 seeds but none of them ever go online.  has anyone ever got beyond 12.7%?"
,ushum,2011-08-10T16:30Z,nope... 12.7% and stop.
,Errrk,2011-08-13T14:22Z,"hey guys, I like you have had this torrent for, what about 2 months stuck at %12.7? well since the original prick couldnt be bothered to seed I tracked down the files elsewhere, below is a 2 part rar of the pics and I am seeding them from this to the original torrent. so either way the rest of you should be able to get it now... try to merge it with your own partially downloaded torrent and lets turn these leeches into seeds!"

,Errrk,2011-08-13T15:17Z,"ok I took it from 0.127 avail to now 153 seeds, so im calling that good enough, dc-ing and going to bed... and fuck you reddragon, was that so hard? took me only a few hours to fix your 2 month fuck up... this was even the top pic torrent on the whole bay you dont think people wanted you to reconnect and seed? :-("
,Errrk,2011-08-13T15:29Z,212 seeds
,lrnlvr,2011-08-19T11:39Z,"downloaded fine for me, not only that it took only about 10 mins, not sure what the others were having problems with. as for the high def resolution im seeing all types of different aspects, but im not downloading them to use as wall papers. Onto the goods, their are some great historical pictures, if your a history buff like myself you wont be dissapointed. thanks for the upload."
,Browse.Torrents,2011-09-29T19:23Z,Thanks...
,Raelmaster,2012-03-05T18:32Z,"Thank-you Seeders, I'll be seeding for a good time."
