,zzw1983,2011-06-16T11:11Z,"don't thank me, thank RELOADED!"
,DoodleBop,2011-06-16T11:56Z,"Hi, i did everything like you said on this page, but i get ""Activation Check failed!"" and the game nor launcher wont appear.

I installed the game offline and used the keygen in the crack folder, but it won't work.

Have you tried this ? does it actually work ?"
,zzw1983,2011-06-16T12:28Z,"the instructions included weren't very clear.
check the following...

did you install aerosoft launcher and copy the 'local key' into the keygen?

did you install the patch after you activated it?

Try activating in aerosoft launcher again with the keygen. make sure the info's correct.

you don't have to do it offline. i did it offline before i installed the patch/ it worked until i went online and then i got 'check failed'. i reactivated while online and it now works.

make sure you choose 'offline activation'

"
,zzw1983,2011-06-16T12:30Z,"when it says offline mode. just click 'offline mode' you don't have to disable the net.

keep us posted."
,jensdebie1995,2011-06-16T14:02Z,"Thank you very much, this game is just awesome"
,DoodleBop,2011-06-16T15:34Z,"My bad, actually the aerosoft launcher didn't launch by itself and was in a totally different directory from the game.

I had to search it and activate the game, now works fine. Thanks again !"
,Crimzzy,2011-06-16T19:23Z,"hmm, I think I might have a problem with the keygen, ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item"""
,zzw1983,2011-06-16T19:57Z,"Crimmzy.
-Check your permission settings under the 'security' tab in the appropriate folder.
-Run the Keygen with administrator rights.
-Disable your anti-virus (is you have it).

,Crimzzy,2011-06-16T20:39Z,"@ zzw1983
I already tryed that, I'm using Vista 64bit if that helps. "
,DoodleBop,2011-06-16T23:32Z,"Crimzzy, its probably your anti virus, i had that problem on various other cracks before. If you still have that problem when turning your anti virus off, completely shut it down/uninstall it and it will work."
[T],Coolguy33,2011-06-16T23:55Z,"Can't get the fuckin thing to work. Did everything mentioned here but that fucking activation keeps saying it failed, wrong serial. Fuck it !"
,zzw1983,2011-06-17T09:58Z,"coolguy.

uninstall everything and clean the registry and try it in these steps.

-Install game
-use keygen to generate serial for installation
-install aerosoft launcher
-run aerosoft launcher
-disable your internet
-copy the local key into the keygen and generate a proper key.
-activate the game
-install the patch
-enable your internet
-run aerosoft launcher again and enter the local key into the keygen (make sure your email and serials are the same as the 1st time)
-enter the proper key 
-activate

These are the exact steps I used and it works. I installed the game on a separate drive and installed aerosoft launcher in the default location. Everything works.

Hope this helps. Keep us posted."
,zzw1983,2011-06-17T09:59Z,dont forget to click 'OFFLINE MODE' in aerosoft launcher to activate. This doesn't necessarily mean you HAVE to disable your internet.
,DC8910,2011-06-17T12:52Z,"Hi everyone! I have a problem... I install the patch before activated it... And now i get ""Activation Check failed"". 
What I have to do?

,laurentziu1993,2011-06-17T19:25Z,where do I find the local  key ?????????   
,Blind Pew,2011-06-17T20:30Z,"There is a virus in the key-gen:

6/17/2011 8:22:53 PM	Kaspersky Internet Security	Protection Center	Untreated: HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic			
j:\crack\keygen.exe
"
,zzw1983,2011-06-17T21:26Z,"dc8910: try reactivating. If that doesn't work. Try the steps I described in my previous post.

Tom92: I have no problems with it in Windows 7. Maybe XP is the problem? Try running it as an administrator. Are you running XP 64bit?

laurentziu1993: It is found under 'offline activation' in Aerosoft launcher.

Blind Pew : Google 'false positive'. Your antivirus is recognizing the keygen as a virus in an effort to curb piracy. It is not a virus. Your anti-virus was made to detect keygens as viruses.

,vishwa023,2011-07-30T15:44Z,"Hey this procedure sucks totally. Uploader please explain correctly. HERE IS THE PROCEDURE 
Unpack files and install 
when it asks for registration give email id and use key from keygen. After installing install aerosoft then press run update later and select wos3 activate button  press offline mode and give the mail id you gave before in the setup process then copy the local key which is situated in the top of the activation box inside ACTIVATION BOX. There will be a local key copy it and paste in the keygen next to local key and press activate button you will get the activation key and paste it it works"
