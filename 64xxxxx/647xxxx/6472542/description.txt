VeggieTales: Josh and the Big Wall! (1997)


The Israelites are trying to get to the promised land, but first they must pass through Jericho, which is guarded by...the French Peas. Also, some of Joshua's charges have their own ideas on how to get past the walled city. Will Joshua listen to God's directions, or will he try to do things his way?
