Through the years, Kight has collaborated or shared the stage with a variety of country and blues musicians including George Jones, Jerry Lee Lewis, Conway Twitty, Luther Allison, Taj Mahal, and of course, her idol, Koko Taylor. Taylor even recorded one of Kight's songs, "Fuel to Burn," for her Royal Blue album for the Alligator label. Kight's albums include "Have I Got Blues for You," a 1996 release for her own label, Blue South Records and four other releases: Come into the Blues in 1997, Trouble in 2000, Southern Comfort in 2003, and Takin' It Easy in 2004.

Since that night in 1995 when her life changed after she first heard a Koko Taylor album, Kight has racked up an impressive array of awards and encomiums from her peers, including six nominations in the Memphis-based Blues Foundation's Blues Music Awards for contemporary female artist and song of the year.
