,jmurphy9785,2011-06-16T18:13Z,it would help if you put the artist and the song title. ive been looking for this song for like a week or two. hope you get it working. whats the bitrate?
,jon_the_juggalo,2011-06-17T04:46Z,TPB wont let me edit it. its 128 i think. its iTunes Mp3 encoder. i have been trying to upload this torrent for weeks now. This is my first torrent. so im still trying to get the hang of this. if there is any music that you dont have let me know.
