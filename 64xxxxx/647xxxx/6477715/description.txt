Henning Eichler explores a selection of musical styles ranging from pre-war blues to jazz and rhythm and blues which illustrate both his eclectic approach to music and his accomplished grasp of the harmonica. 

With his blues roots as the basis and inspired by more progressive colleagues such as Carlos del Junco and Howard Levy, he has clearly reached the top league of harmonica playing.
