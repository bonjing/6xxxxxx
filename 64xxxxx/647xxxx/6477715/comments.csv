,daba_1,2011-06-18T17:25Z,"This album really shows the depth of the use of the harmonica. The new young players show that the boundaries are endless in the making of music with this instrument.

Back in the early 20th century many a poor musician could not afford a saxophone. This instrument allowed them to produce the same sound. Thus the harmonica in slang became known as the poor mans' ""Mississippi Saxophone"".

This German pressings is of the highest sound quality.

Thanks for sharing Night.

Always your friend;
