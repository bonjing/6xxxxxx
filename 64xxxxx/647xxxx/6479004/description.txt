RE-SEEDING THE SAME FILES POSTED EARLY UNDER \"Victor-Victoria [Original Soundtrack]\" 

Original soundtrack for 1982 Black Andrews movie performed by pretty charming Julie Andrews.

There is no seeders at all for sny others releases and this one IÂ´ve found on web in a .rar with 43mb. 

However by here the internet services are very expensive and still more and more if transfers gets over the damn monthly quota so iÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼â•¦Â£m going to remove it from my share when utorrent ratio gets 5.0.

If everybody do share it along at least until 2.0 this release would be alive for a quite while and also the world more happy in this fantastic era by torrent, more and more stronger each day grateful to this brave PTB and others open trackers. 

The humankind wouldnÂ´t never be able to afford a fair payback for this terrific enterprise of you all in charge.

Who cares about TV? I donÂ´t even remember what itÂ´s like...
