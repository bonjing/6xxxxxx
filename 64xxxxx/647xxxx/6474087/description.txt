WHEN DEEP PURPLE finally collapsed under a blanket of fatigue and insurrection in mid-1976, all bets were off as to which members would fly phoenix-like from the wreckage.

Fully loaded with talent, Purple was a breeding ground for a significant amount of lofty and successful spin-off projects, including Whitesnake, Rainbow and Gillan. But it wasnâ€™t until 1982, following a couple of low-key solo projects, that bassist/vocalist Glenn Hughes would resurface with a unit that would (quite rightly) stop the rock world in its tracksâ€¦

Teaming up with highly respected guitarist Pat Thrall (previously a member of jazz fusionists Automatic Man and the whiskey-snortinâ€™ Pat Travers Band), the duo joined forces and names under the â€˜Hughes/Thrallâ€™ banner â€“ an early-â€™80s collaboration that would go on to deliver an album that has seen its  â€˜legendary/all-time greatâ€™ status increase by leaps & bounds as the years have rolled by.

Full-bloodedly produced by the seasoned (and equally legendary) Andy Johns, a sometimes gun-totinâ€™ Brit whose credits also include Free, Led Zeppelin & Van Halen, the record received an overwhelmingly enthusiastic reception on release, basking in clear-cut melodies, razor-sharp guitar chops, edgy production and some of the best songs this side of a Journey or Foreigner album. The icing on the cake? Why, Glenn Hughes, of course. The voice of rock has never sounded so downright confident and so well-matched to the material. Every song, every phrase, every lick â€“ pure manna from hard rock heaven!
