[Notes]

Forged in the bowels of Chicago, IL, Black September arose from the depths
in 2006 with their demo Contortion. Inspired by bands such as Bolt Thrower,
His Hero Is Gone, Dissection and Bathory, they decided to form a band that
was heavy and aggressive, but more importantly, original. Although
unrefined, the demo laid the path for the albums soon to come.

Band founders and mainstayers, Chris McMorrow and classically trained
vocalist Jen McMorrow, and various line ups have released four EPs to date;
including a split with Louisiana's Thou. They Forbidden Gates Beyond, the
bands debut full length, originally self released in 2010, shows Black
September firing on all evil cylinders with a steady line up, and ready to
unleash their madness upon the unsuspecting masses! The band has previously
shared the stage with the likes of Unearthly Trance, Skeletonwitch,
Javelina, Masakari, and Magrudergrind, amongst others, and will hit the road
aextensively this year.
