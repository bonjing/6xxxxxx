,villeee2010,2011-06-17T23:08Z,How do i install it i cant burn it with daemon tools is it any other burning method or how i can do to install it?
,defconhakr,2011-06-20T05:24Z,"Great torrent, very easy to install and get setup.

I've got a question though, where are the crack files? The subfolders in the Razor1911 folder dont match the system folders. "
,Vegasbob,2011-06-21T10:09Z,"Don't bother, this is the same ""Nuked"" version/has the same problem as the original Razor releases. If you quit the game partway thru then play it again, it will save your progress as far as what episode you are on, but it does not remember how much Ego you've collected, and you cannot play previous episodes you've already completed.
