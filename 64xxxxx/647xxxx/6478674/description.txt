PLOT:
Sierra Nevada Mountains, 1887: William Drayton, once a crack
sharpshooter in the Civil War, has lost his wife and home. He
has ascended to the high country, wanting never to be heard from
again. But someone is trying to find him -- a long-lost daughter
Elizabeth, whom Drayton thought had died long before. Meanwhile,
banker-turned-robber baron Horace Scarsdale has mustered an army
of cutthroats and guns for hire to help him build his railroad
empire. When Drayton returns to Â“civilizationÂ” with his daughter
and friends, he decided to make a stand against Scarsdale, his
former employer. Against impossible odds, he faces down the
vicious band of raiders that Scarsdale calls The Company Men.
