I created this torrent in protest of the MPAA backed Protect IP Act. Downloading and seeding this torrent would be like signing a petition to stop these idiotic Legislation. If the United States was by the people and for the people, then why in the hell is private corporation and groups like the MPAA making our laws? download this for freedom!!!!
