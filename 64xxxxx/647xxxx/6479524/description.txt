Such a pretty face....

So young, so sweet. She appeared out of nowhere, in the middle of traffic, on a busy day. A teenager with no past, no family - no memories.

Such a lovely child....

So blond and beautiful. Carol and Paul were drawn to her â€“ she was the child theyâ€™d never had. A dream come true. And then Carolâ€™s nightmares began â€“ the ghastly sounds in the nightâ€¦the bloody face in the mirrorâ€¦the razor-sharp ax.

Such a relentless evil....

So deceptively innocent. Most mothers would die for such a darling little angel. And thatâ€™s what frightened Carol most of all.
