,phattsao,2011-06-17T01:55Z,"This has Cinavia, so if you play it on a PS3 the audio cuts out after 20 minutes or so.  Which sucks!"
,chrissyzieth,2011-06-17T09:17Z,"Cool shit, I'm smiling.  Thank u"
,kitykat70,2011-06-17T13:27Z,"very bummed, on VLC the dialogue soundtrack cuts out after about 20 minutes, great copy otherwise"

,jkeller80,2011-06-21T05:31Z,"What's up with the PS3 audio thing.  Is it cinivia or whatever?  The copyright protection add-on that cuts off the audio/video after so many minutes?  How do we get past this thing?  

They're adding new movies to the list all the time."
,ranzizam,2011-06-21T07:35Z,"i love the comic book, it's sad that they did such a poor job with the movie.. STAY BLACK DYLAN!!"
,kalamity58,2011-06-21T21:50Z,had trouble with audio
,bs14,2011-06-22T07:03Z,no audio :(
,scottsasse,2011-06-24T22:22Z,"@ jkeller80, to get past it take a beseball bat to all your sony equipment!! And furthermore WE SHOULD ALL BOYCOTT SONY for putting little ""viruses"" in the equipment WE PAY $$$ FOR!! It's just not right, who do they think they are?? Microsoft?"
,thanksalotppl,2011-06-25T00:30Z,it's superman!!!

,jkeller80,2011-07-09T22:24Z,"What the hell is up with some AC3 audios?  Most movies play fine then I have this freak thing with certain, and random, movies where the voices are non existant no matter what I do.  Replace codecs, tweak audio settings.  WTF?!?"

,sinx5,2011-08-01T03:41Z,"Quality 10/10, movie quality 7/10, and yes this file has the audio watermark on it which is a problem if you want to watch it on PS3. To solve the problem I've put the file on usb stick and watched it in a dvd player that has a usb port. Thanks for the up!"
,vdarkeaglev,2011-08-03T11:22Z,"Everyone seems to be having problems with PS3s so glad I have my 360 for watching movies. (Not a Microsoft fan boy by any means I own both a PSX original and a fat PS2 + retro consoles I'm just a gamer through and through) Only thing I dont like about it is you cant watch .MKVs which is what 90% of anime comes in but I don't think ps3 can either

But thats enough of my rambling thanks for the up."
,misteragez,2011-08-05T11:21Z,"Cinavia protected, won't work on PS3"
,fuckface69,2011-08-07T14:33Z,@misteragez ...this movie works fine for me on PS3 with CFW 3.55 Kmeaw in Showtime through latest multiMAN so I don't understand why you're lying?!

,Polarbear4444,2011-08-09T05:34Z,"Ok guys, here is what I don't understand.  All of you bitching and moaning about the sound not working on your ps3.  Obviously you have hd tv's, so why not just spend a little money and get a new video card that has and hdmi output and hook your computer directly to your tv.  Its an easy solution and you don't have to take the time to  burn to dvd.  Problem solved!  By the way,  thanks hero for the up."
