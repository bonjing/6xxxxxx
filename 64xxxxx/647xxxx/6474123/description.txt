(DanniGirl of the Month- September 2007) Jaime grew up in the windy city of downtown Chicago. After high school graduation, she decided she wanted to get away from those cold winters and attended Arizona State University. One day while waiting for class to start, she saw an ad in the college newspaper for Playboy's Special Editions casting call, and she knew she had to check it out. Jamie's first Playboy layout was released in spring 2004 and it went on to be one of the most popular special editions ever! Jaime enjoyed doing her photoshoot so much that she decided to move to Los Angeles to continue modeling. Even with her busy schedule, she made time to visit us at Danni.com and we're sure glad she did!
