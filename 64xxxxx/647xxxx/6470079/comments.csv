,johnstar,2011-10-17T20:29Z,"I found a good way of downloading from a private tracker without them keeping tabs, its easy just download as normal then stop the process once there is a number of seeders, next delete the tracker ( right click the torrent details to find the option ) then continue downloading, your client remembers how to connect to the peers but doesn't inform the tracker anymore, easy!

This works very well with private trackers because everyone is frantically uploading to try to make ratio ends meet and as such are very stable.

I have used this method for a while now and built up a good head of upload compared to my download, you see once I have 100% I upload by simply re-clicking on the torrent header file, the client says the torrent task exists do you want to import the trackers from it? click yes, now you can seed it at your leisure.

A whole TV program series of downloading usually will cost me no more than a few meg of tracked downloading, by reseeding once I have it all gives me lots upload credit! nice

anyway enjoy!

pirating the way it should be"
