High Fidelity: Extended Cut


Copyright (c) 2000 Touchstone Pictures

Directed by Stephen Frears

Based on a novel by Nick Hornby

Starring John Cusack, Jack Black, Iben Hjejle and Todd Louiso

Running time:  126 minutes



The original DVD release of \\\"High Fidelity\\\" included 9 deleted scenes. Having been a big fan of the book and movie for many years, I always felt disappointed that these scenes got cut from the film\\\'s theatrical release. They are funny, poignant and contribute to the narrative of the film. Furthermore, they include awesome cameos by Harold Ramis (as Rob\\\'s father) and Beverly D\\\'Angelo (as a jilted wife). So using Nick Hornby\\\'s novel as guide, I decided to re-insert these deleted scenes into the movie and create an extended cut featuring 12 extra minutes of footage.

I upscaled the original 480p DVD video to 720p prior to encoding in order to try to preserve as much detail as possible from the original DVD transfer, including film grain.

I hope you enjoy it.
