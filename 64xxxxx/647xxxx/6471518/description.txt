Memorial Day event at Hustler Hollywood Monroe OH store. Earthly Body provided all the Waterslide lube that the Honeys needed to get slick, and get busy! Sex Drive energy drink helped out with samples of their rockin' herbal energy beverage. Dayton's WXEG 103.9FM was on hand to broadcast the debauchery.  The crowd and crew dined on 'dogs, chips and sodas courtesy of Hustler Monroe.
  Keep an eye open for future events at the store, just off I-75.
