Oliveros with accordion in just intonation within an interactive electronic
environment created by Peter Ward. An amazing hour-long live creation
(improvisation)...images of valleys, other universes, whatever comes to
mind...an exercise in true "deep listening"as she refers to the concerts her
foundation presents in upstate New York.

While Pauline Oliveros' output has its high and low marks, the composer,
accordionist and organizer is an undeniable force in new music. For fifty years
she has pursued sonic experiments, and as the founder of the Deep Listening
Institute, she has supported many other sound innovators.

Sadly, it's sometimes easier to respect her from afar than to closely follow her
work. Her choices in collaborators can get in the way, and they often seem to be
made out social or political sympathies as much as musical ones. But there are
gems within her catalogue, such as Troglodyte's Delight (1990) with her Deep
Listening Band or the early tape experiments on Alien Bog and Beautiful Soop
(1997). Her 1998 release The Roots of the Moment, just reissued by Hatology, is
among those essentials.

Essentially a solo recording, Oliveros and her accordion are found here within
an "electronic environment created by Peter Ward. The electronic element isn't
explained in the liner notes (written by her neighbor, saxophonist Joe McPhee,
with whom she's collaborated), and its presence seems subtle on the
recording. Reverb and delay may be present at times, but it might be best just
to assume they're there.

Either way, Oliveros creates a fascinating, elongated suite (six tracks clocking
in at just under an hour) with her instrument. Her "just intonation accordion
allows worlds of small intervals, allowing odd intervals and tonal
juxtapositions that are complex without dissonance. The pace varies from very
slow to quiet trots, but the overall effect is of being submerged into the
accordion. They may polka when they're awake, but this is the sleeping
squeezebox's sound.
