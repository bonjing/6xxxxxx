And it does not seem to use .net or other managed CLR implementations which makes the program waste a lot of resources. Cutsom skinning, html news page and other horrible features riddle most of the file duplicate finders out there on the web.

I'll be testing it more, but so far I recommend people buy the program to support the author and making of proper programs. :)"
