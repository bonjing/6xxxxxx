,exxazz,2011-07-01T20:35Z,"@NLUPPPER002:
Please stop uploading non-dvd's to the category Movies DVDR. This category is purely for ripped DVD's. 
Instead use the Category Handheld regardless of the intended use. 
The categories are for how the film was captured and not for how anyone intended to watch the movie, regardless of the good intention. 

Thanks!"
