RELEASE NOTES

Alice: Madness Returns delves deep into the dark and violent side of
the imagination, creating a nightmarish Wonderland where Alice must
face the demons that haunt her visions. Visit the grim reality of
Victorian London and then travel to the beautiful yet ghastly
Wonderland to uncover the root of Alice's madness and discover the
truth behind a deadly secret, kept hidden for years.

Eleven years ago a horrific fire took Alices family from her and left
her mind horrifically scarred. Afterwards she was confined to Rutledge
Asylum, where she struggled to confront her demons by slipping further
into her fantasy world of Wonderland. Now, after ten years, she has
finally secured her releaseyet she still bears the heavy
psychological burden of that tragic event.

With her mind in tatters, she is unable to resolve the fear prompted by
her strange memories, dreams, and visions. Perhaps she'll do better in
Wonderland. She always has. She travels there, seeking what the "real"
world can't provide: security, knowledge, and the truth about the past.
But in her absence, Wonderland too has suffered. Something has gone
horribly wrong, and now a great evil is descending upon what once was
her beautiful refuge. Can Alice save Wonderlandand herselffrom the
madness that consumes them both?
