,tony419,2011-07-17T15:18Z,"@jcbycroft Tell 'em brotha. People be depending on u for movies and u leave us hangin just like that? I know its all free stuff so no need to complain but a lil courtesy wudnt hurt, unless there's somethin wrong somewhere, then i wish FXG the best and hope they come back soon. I didnt mean to troll, i just meant to offer alternatives for downloaders like myself that are avid fans of movies, and not fans of a particular uploader. As i said, i understand loyalty, but the show must go on.  

@Symn What the hell is your point? BluRay supercedes DVDrip in everythin, and Kickass and others i listed do BRrip at the same size as FXG's DVDrip. If ur a stickler for mediocrity, be my guest. (No offence FXG)

Start your own channel and see if you can do any better."
,redactedwv,2011-07-17T21:45Z,"You're an idiot, jcbycroft - and you're an idiot for agreeing with him, tony. Yesterday i almost commended you on providing a list of decent alternatives, tony - i was just too lazy to log in. Your subsequent posts have been shit, however. ""Tell 'em brotha""?? lol.

FxG has been providing quality up's for more than half a fucking decade. Sometimes they take a break... Sometimes that break lasts for more than a month or two. 

Get over it.

If you 2 friggin bedwetters are this upset that an uploader failed to give you a goodbye hug, you need to pull yourself up by the elastic band in your knickers and reevaluate your perspective.

Fuckin' hell.... Like FxG owes you a goddamn thing. 

""FxG didn't tell me goodbye!! He's supposed to be upping free shit for me! Doesn't he care that he hurt my feelings??""

Buncha fuckin' children."
,tony419,2011-07-17T23:56Z,"@Symn  ""+2gig files"", really? Illiterate or just plain dumb, pick one. Did u friggin read anythin i wrote!?!

@redactedwv  ""FxG has been providing quality up's for more than half a fucking decade"". True, I'm with you on that one. Riddle me this though, BRRip vs. DVDRip, which is a better quality? Come on! Coz i watched Fargo on my VCR years ago don't mean i'd want to watch it AT THE SAME QUALITY as i did before. I searched, and found, then downloaded the BRRip, and it blew my mind even more than the original. Video Tape < DVD < BluRay; tech has moved on. So in continuing with their near excellent upload record, isnt it about time they start uploading BRRips, at the same size as their DVDRips (here lookin at u, Symn)? As i said, i'm also a fan of FXG, and my first post was for those that may not know other reliable options are available when FXG goes on a ""break"". Tkanx 4 appreciatin the list though.

Still, even though its the internet, all anonymous and sh/t, half a decade is enough time to feel like you 'know' someone, enough to drop a hint when your goin on a break. We drop a comment sayin 'thank you' when we download a movie from FXG, FXG can say somthin b4 they vanish. The comments page can go both ways. Its mutual, it is freakin relationship! Yeah, i said it.

Peace!

,jcbycroft,2011-07-18T04:25Z,"KNICKERS PLEASE! You're right redactedwetvagina, I'm only guessing that's what the WV stands for, I'm in the wrong pair of knickers. lol. What a fag. Only a fat ass like you wears clothes with an elastic band (also noticed you couldn't spell waist and were too lazy to look it up so just put band)

I'm not saying I or anyone else is owed anything just simply making the point that even if someone is around ""half a decade"" then just randomly vanishes there is no reason to get all butt hurt about it, just move on - and at the same time pointing out that this ""team"" of uploaders is far from legendary. unless you have low standards I suppose. 

You're reading comprehension is piss poor. Your insults - ""you're an idiot"" are terrible. What are you five? You put quotes around you're own interpretation of others comments?

,redactedwv,2011-07-18T21:59Z,"Too funny, jcbycroft. 

While i don't like making spelling/grammar errors, you might want to check your own posts before making an issue of it (convenient, you're/your, etc). Ditto for the proper use of quotation marks and commas. 

You posted a trolling comment that consisted of a cum joke, calling a person a ""fag"", and a bit about the guy's mom - but calling you an idiot in response is immature, huh?

 In light of the source, i'll give that charge the consideration it deserves.

--

FxG is, apparently, taking a break. We have no way to know whether or not their silence is related to the cessation of their uploads (though they've made no announcements prior to past breaks, AFAIK). The only action to take is to keep seeding their ever-dependable ups, and hope for the best (for them, and for us).

Repeatedly moaning about the fact that they didn't kiss you goodbye - or coming in to bag on their ups - is completely pointless.

They'll be back, or they won't.

Regardless of what the future holds, they had a run to be proud of."

You used the word ""hence"" on a message board while you download movies? You are aparently logged in to this very comment section 24/7 simply to retort with weak ass responses. Why don't you fucking grow a pair and learn how to play the game. Your arguements are fucking tired and terrible from the first word you typed. Your dry wit and calm demeanor may get you into your daddy's knickers but its going to take a little more sweet talking to romance the pants of this wise group of downloaders. Finish playing your world of warcraft account and let the people who notice that fxg sucks if one person on the ""team"" can't find the time to up a movie. They don't need you licking their taint and defending their honor with british charm. fag."

Arguing online is like running in the special Olympics. Even if you win, you're still a fucking retard.
Hope to see FXG_team again someday, but just as aXXO was once the man, either they'll return or someone else will take their place in the scene. Either way, it's not worth fighting about.
