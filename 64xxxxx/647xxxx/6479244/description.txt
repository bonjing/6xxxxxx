Plot:
Manchester, North of England, 1975. The now much diminished, but still 
claustrophobic and dysfunctional, Khan family continues to struggle for 
survival. Sajid, the youngest Khan, the runt of the litter, is deep in 
pubescent crisis under heavy assault both from his father's tyrannical 
insistence on Pakistani tradition, and from the fierce bullies in the 
schoolyard. So, in a last, desperate attempt to 'sort him out', his 
father decides to pack him off to Mrs Khan No 1 and family in the 
Punjab, the wife and daughters he had abandoned 35 years earlier. 
It is not long before Ella Khan (Mrs Khan No2) with a small entourage 
from Salford, England, swiftly follows to sort out the mess, 
past and present. 


Enjoy :)
