,Bluetack,2011-06-15T11:06Z,"Wow, lots of interest right off the bat!  :D

If you want to help this torrent get started quickly
go to the archives.gov site, start downloading ONE 
from there and when it's done stop your bittorrent
app, dump it into your Pentagon Papers download 
folder, rescan/recheck the files and start up again.

I started this torrent because the archive site is 
obviously overloaded so don't try to download more
than one file at a time from there."
,Bluetack,2011-06-15T14:37Z,I'm sure he'll be flattered to hear that.  âş
,asc11,2011-06-15T21:09Z,"You beat me to posting, Bluetack. But renaming the downloaded files as you did makes it REALLY tough for others to do as you suggest and help to seed using independently downloaded file copies.

Here's the torrent with the original file names:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6471925

Unfortunately, seeding there will be interrupted for several hours tomorrow,"
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T05:23Z,"Actually there's nothing to it.  Once you drop the file in you 
copy the name from the incomplete file it will replace, 
delete that and rename your contribution.  Too easy.

The full filenames I provided will also make it far easier for 
people to select individual files for download without 
having to download the index or consult external sources.

You see, there's method in my madness.  ; )

Seeding is over halfway done, folks. Keep it up!  "
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T15:42Z,"Sometime today the Archives gave up on these full sized 
files and replaced them with a set that looks to be about a 
quarter the size.  That makes this one the only surviving 
First Edition full-sized collection.  :p

I guess being quick has it's advantages.  ; )

Even if the slim set is good I'll keep this one up because
I don't know if the other lost something by the compression.

I'm setting up the second set for a torrent with the 
same extended filenames as this one.  I'm not trying 
to be the first guy to offer them as much as being the 
guy who intends these two torrents to last forever as
a useful resource from which you can download one 
file at a time with no pressure to stay and seed them."
,Bluetack,2011-06-16T19:55Z,"Okay, the full Slim Set is now online:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6474110

It's only 1.34 GiB (1442490549 Bytes), and looks clear and
complete on first inspection so you might prefer it."
,Bluetack,2011-06-18T14:17Z,"If your computer has problems with the long filenames in this 
torrent there is an identical one with short filenames here:
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6477590"
,Bluetack,2011-06-23T15:14Z,Test.
