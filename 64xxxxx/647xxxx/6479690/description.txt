What if Cannabis Cured Cancer - by Len Richmond (2010)

Could the chemicals found in marijuana prevent and even heal several deadly cancers? Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries. "What if Cannabis Cured Cancer" explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies, and when pot is consumed, the "endocannabinoids" inside usâ€”along with any cannabinoids we ingestâ€”fit together like a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodyâ€™s healthy cells. A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabis â€” and perhaps even the future of medicine. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor, Peter Coyote, and featuring interviews with:
