In return for flooding /b/ this morning, have 62,000
passwords and emails. The top half is "password | email",
and the bottom half is "email | password"; these are random
assortments from a collection, so don't ask which site they're
from or how old they are, because we have no idea. We also can't
confirm what percentage still work, but be creative or something.

ENJOY!!! :)
