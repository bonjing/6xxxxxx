MotoGP 2 is a Grand Prix motorcycle racing video game developed by Black Rock Studio for the Xbox and personal computer. It was the second title in in THQ's MotoGP series and based the 2002 MotoGP season. Players could take part in a single race on three choosable circuits or participate in a full season, eventually unlocking more circuits to be raced on. Also featured in the game is a stunt mode where the player race a one lap performing different stunts as wheelies, burnouts and powerslides for points. Points are also rewarded when overtaking another rider, driving clean sections, or ramming other riders so they crash. However, recently gained points are lost if the player drives outside the track or crashes. Also if the player fails to reach goal within the timelimit, all rewarded points are lost. The menu theme music is Psynn 2 by Shawn Hargreaves, who created a new version of Psynn, version used in MotoGP.
