Armand Van Helden is a house music artist and music remixer whose biggest commercial successes came from his remixes of the 1996 Tori Amos song "Professional Widow", which reached the top of the UK singles chart, and his own track "You Don't Know Me" which was Number 1 in the UK in January 1999.
After a couple of below par albums, Armand returns with a mix CD of considerable substance and varying musical depths. His plan was to create a typical slice of New York nightlife, where a kaleidoscope of sounds clashes with one common theme - to move the crowd.
