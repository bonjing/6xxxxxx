"I was really impressed by your band El Cuero
earlier today, I didn't expect Norwegians to have
such a groove."

Is what Jackson Browne was quoted as saying after
catching El Cuero's performance at The
Norwegian Wood Festival in 2010. Jackson Browne is
not alone in being impressed by this band,
since their emergence on the Norwegian rock scene
in 2005 their albums and live performances
have gained rave reviews.

El Cuero's unique blend of rock based on an
American brew has been perfected to a T during
these years giving them a powerful, melodic and
above all bombastic groove. This will become ever
more evident with the 2011 release of their
upcoming third album.

El Cuero's new album "From Mountains To Sand", is
mixed by David Bianco who's CV includes
Bob Dylan, AC/DC and Ozzy Osbourne among others.
This album is produced by Lars HÃ¥vard
Haugen making it his second successful attempt at
capturing the band and honing their skills to
tape. Their songwriting is better than ever and
the production team has created a monstrous hard
hitting album with exquisite performances all
around. This album has a really hot buzz going and
the band is dying to release it and hit the road.

El Cuero was started by two brothers, HÃ¥vard &
Brynjar Takle Ohr in 2005. After growing up
together sharing bunk beds in the Norwegian town
of Kristiansund, listening to music and developing
their own musical skills, they finally put the
band together that you are listening to today.
With Brynjar on guitar and lead vocals, HÃ¥vard on
drums, yvind BlomstrÃ¸m on guitar and Tommy Reite
on bass, the classic rock combo El Cuero saw the
light of day.

Their first outing in 2007 was the self-titled El
Cuero and gained rave reviews for their blend of
powerful Crazy Horse influenced rock, via Steve
"Earlish" compositions to beautiful acoustic music
with soaring harmonies.

They also quickly gained a reputation for being
one of Norway's best live bands.
Their second outing was called A Glimmer Of Hope
and was the first album produced by Lars
HÃ¥vard Haugen. Eden Parke of Uncut magazine summed
up El Cuero by saying, They rock like
bastards.  A Glimmer of Hope cemented their
position as being a favorite among both critics
and audiences with excellent reviews.

El Cuero lineup:
Brynjar Takle Ohr (gitar/vokal),
HÃ¥vard Takle Ohr (trommer/vokal),
Tommy Reite (bass),
