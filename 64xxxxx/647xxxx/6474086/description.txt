ART BLAKEY and THE JAZZ MESSENGERS  MOSIAC
Released October 1961 
Recorded 2nd October 1961 by Rudy Van Gelder at Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 
Length 39:39 
Label Blue Note Records
Format:Flac


This is the first release by one of the most critically acclaimed Jazz Messengers lineups: Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone), Cedar Walton (piano), Jymie Merritt (bass), and Art Blakey (drums). They recorded and performed together from 1961 into 1964. Hubbard, Walton, and Workman became permanent members of the group following the 1961 departures of trumpeter Lee Morgan, pianist Bobby Timmons, and bassist Jymie Merritt, though Merritt and others would appear infrequently on subsequent recordings.
The Mosaic recording session featured no alternate takes and, therefore, has yielded no bonus material in reissue.
