Release Notes:

Save Your Breath release their debut album, â€˜Vicesâ€™ on Monday 4th July
on Purgatory Records. Itâ€™s an album that tells a host of tales for the
South Wales quintet, as bassist, Ben Griffiths, explains.

â€œA lot of bands these days are always aiming to please other people,
the endgame is to be famous, thatâ€™s the goal, the barometer for
success. Then thereâ€™s also the other end of the scale, where being cool
is the be all and end all. Youâ€™re something to 100 pretentious people
in every city in the country, 3 months later no one gives a fuck.

Our whole reason for being in this band is different from that. Wanting
to do something that could maybe turn the negatives from your life into
something that may provide positive experience, some direction for
yourself and maybe even for someone else.

â€˜Vicesâ€™ is that story. Growing up in a shit place, seeing things that
you only ever thought happened on TV and having to deal with all these
troubles at an age where growing up is hard work by itself, whilst
struggling not to carry these experiences in a negative light
throughout your whole life. Itâ€™s also the story of the problems weâ€™ve
faced as a band, itâ€™s hard enough being in a band, it seems itâ€™s worse
being a pop-punk band, it seems itâ€™s even worse being a pop punk band
from the UK. Hereâ€™s hoping that people will actually judge us on what
we do and say rather that where we come from.

Since leaving school weâ€™ve seen family members die, family members
imprisoned, friends and familyâ€™s lives ruined by drugs, depression and
a lack of direction or ambition. Where we come from thatâ€™s what
happens. Some of us have suffered from depression, some of us have seen
people throw their lives away, this is just our way of getting away
from that, in some ways itâ€™s the only way we have to tell our stories
and exorcise the demons that weâ€™ve had to deal with.

We paid to do our own record, we paid to press it, we book our own
shows, we sleep on floors, we struggle to afford food. Our gear is
fucked, our van is falling apart, we have rent to pay, one of us has a
kid, the rest of us canâ€™t get jobs. We do this because we love to do it
and everything we do is honest.â€
