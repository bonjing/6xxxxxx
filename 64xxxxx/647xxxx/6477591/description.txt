[VHS rip - persian audio, hard english subtitles]

A small child and her elderly neighbor are having all kinds of small adventures
in the streets of Tehran to get a sack of rice. This is a minimalist film where
nothing and everything happens depending on how you look at it. This movie is
very different from your ordinary Hollywood kind of child movie. It is utterly
unpredictable, very humane and extremely warm in its depiction of normal every
day people. It also gives the viewer a rare glimpse in the poorer areas of
southern Tehran.
