,widowzson,2011-06-20T08:34Z,"This is REAL!  I am staring at the ugly water mark right now.  Upon installation it appears fake and looks like every other seven installation, however on first boot you see the new boot screen with the beta fish, and it appears they have changed the performance test.  Looks like Tablet PC keyboard has been added and a few other minor changes.  Does not work in Vbox so I gave it a go on a rego.  NTFS is the filesystem....Seems like explorer.exe is a bit less of a hog.  Avast AV caused the black screen of death on installation and don't work. "

,frogcrush,2011-06-20T21:47Z,"This is real. I know you probably won't believe me, or believe me when I say I am writing this from Windows 8, but it is. If you would like a screenshot:
http://tylorstech.com/imagestore/frogcrush/win8_TPB_Proof.png

It does claim that it is Windows 7 Ultimate on setup, but this is because the guy who leaked it used the Windows 7 Setup files because  Microsoft has not created as setup wizard for Windows 8 yet. 

So... ya... Have fun with Windows 8"
,pbnjp,2011-06-21T05:03Z,Can confirm that this is real. As soon as you get passed the windows 7 logo on install it says you are about to install windows 8. Also it has nice features but it's nothing groundbreaking. If you already have windows 7 there's no point in upgrading.

If you think it's still fake then this fake is so brilliant that it is identical to real Win8 image."
,thejackofclubs,2011-06-22T23:00Z,what product key are you guys using? i found one online that works but wont activate over the phone. something im missing? also where is this new touch friendly start menu? thats the thing i really want to play with!

,tom.sk,2011-06-23T07:59Z,why at start of instalation on screen say windows 7?
,Evil_Star,2011-06-24T22:50Z,well it works and it seems to be a legit windows 8 but its horrible it runs like crap took me about 45 minutes to make it detect my graphics card and it doesn't detect my drd-rw driver either so i cant burn another os so i have to figure something out  i would not recommend this 
,SmilingAhab,2011-06-25T23:53Z,"You guys have to remember that THIS IS STILL IN ALPHA. This shit ain't even beta yet. There's not going to be much graphical difference; this is the attempt to make a competitor to iOS - something that can run on tablets, phones and PCs with full compatibility across hardware. They were smart because they've correctly anticipated the end of differences between phones, tablets and computers. We're heading back to the future of PDAs. One device that does everything from running our porn, music and videogames to making calls to being firmware-level compatible with massive databases and internet backbones. They want to cut into Linux's high-tech market (not likely) and use the Live metabrand to create UI-level cross-compatibility with the Zune, xBox and Windows. 

Run it in a sandbox or Xen if you can because this shit will mess up your computer if you don't know what you're doing - hence, alpha. 

It still says 7 because they haven't re-branded it, they're still trying to get the cross-platform emulation and new filesystem (about goddamn time) working and all the new little juicy tidbits that haven't been talked about yet. Then they will work on the new graphics system and backwards compatibility with hardware and software, then do a quick branding. 

Stable release 1 loose estimate by the build team: Q3 2012. 

There's a ways to go yet, but it looks solid so far. "

,imajet2,2011-08-08T04:33Z,"So install went well. Boots in 21 seconds post-install, same as 7. Internet Explorer and update wouldn't function for me, It is still registry based despite what I had heard about 8. Google Chrome installed and worked well. It is polished better than 7, 35 processes with 768 mb ram being used in default state at idle. Not bad for Alpha, sound,internet,keyboard,mouse worked OOB. May try to install gfx driver and a game like Fear 3 or WOW to see if/how it'll run."

,JackBack,2011-09-11T22:30Z,@ffmaniac4480 Do you not realize that some people are more technologically advanced then you. We are downloading it to try on a virtual machine. Not to use as our primary OS.
,Nkendrick22,2011-09-21T23:43Z,"ffmaniac4480 there would be 2 reasons people are downloading this. 

1.) They have a seperate computer they wish to try it on.

2.) They are using it through a virtual box or virtual pc program.

Why people would even try it on their every day computer would be just plain stupid."
