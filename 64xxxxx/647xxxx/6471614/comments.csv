,salencec,2011-06-22T23:08Z,"Just a heads up: this torrent isn't seeded - at all! After a week of dl-ing (and uploaded 26GB), the leechers (peers connected) are uploading at an average total of 4KBps."
,HarveyBd,2011-06-24T00:16Z,PLEASE SEED! I WILL SEED FOREVER!
,M.C. Hammer,2011-06-24T18:48Z,"Found the answer to my question on another site:

There is an .srt file in english but they are not hardcoded and the subs are for the complete movie. elvish only was not available to us from any source. and editing the full subs would take way to long.

I'm just gonna get them off google and hope they sync up. Not a big deal really.

Thanks for the up."
,koosbr,2011-06-25T17:35Z,"Are there dutch subs available?

,Romeo1983,2011-07-01T21:39Z,"So there are no subs for the Elvish translation? WTF? There is a lot of Elvish spoken in these films. 


I don't know how to add subs and I watch it on my PS3 from laptop, so is this even worth attempting or should I wait for better upload?"
,amey000joshi,2011-07-02T12:53Z,tons of thanks bro for the upload how is the audio video qaulity guys ?????
,ewjbtz,2011-07-04T00:51Z,"Hi everyone. I found some non-English only synced subs for this torrent. You will have to rename them the same as the movie and add .srt to the end so they will open automatically in VLC. Here's the links.

,owenp,2012-05-17T00:07Z,For those of you who want to hard-code or embed the Elvish subs in the mp4 Download ~ MKVMerge and you can add the .srt + .mp4 and save as an mkv or mp4
,osriccc,2012-05-20T20:11Z,Please say if these have the credits included. I downloaded another rip and I just erased the files because they have the credits cut off. Please confirm anyone who downloaded this or the uploader?
