Thanks for sharing. I have been looking for Rip of certain movies, but haven't found them so far. I request you to see if you can get hold of any (or, even better, all) of them.

Can you upload the DVDRip/BRRip/BDRip of the following (or any of the following) movies WITH English subs (soft subs preferred, but hard subs will also be fine if no soft subs are available)?

1] Biutiful - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164999/

2] A-i-deul... (aka Children...) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861982/

3] Insidious - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/

4] The Lincoln Lawyer

I'll be very grateful if you can do any of them, especially A-i-deul... (Sorry for repeating, but if it's possible for you to fulfill my request, please see to it that the Rip includes English subs.) Hope you can. And even if you can't, thanks and cheers."
