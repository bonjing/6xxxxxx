,dylan75,2011-06-19T22:05Z,"Hello all

Thanks for upload and sharing.
How i can burn 32bit and 64bit in one DVD?

thank you for help"
,dylan75,2011-06-20T19:19Z,"Not activeted for me, any way?"
,domatosalata,2011-06-22T17:12Z,"Installed on 3 pcâs, both versions 32 and 64  work like a charm, they  take updates normally.
Plus the name behind them is a warranty."
,TheAeroHacker,2011-06-27T00:12Z,"Dylan75, You can't burn both on a DVD, but what you can do is put them on a flash drive and use a program like 'MagicDisc' (Google it) to mount the disc images and then install them."
,Monniker,2011-06-27T20:48Z,Works great! Thanks!
,xG33Kx,2011-07-04T00:55Z,The install stalls while trying to upgrade my existing 2007 install?  
,TheAeroHacker,2011-07-06T00:52Z,"@xG33Kx:

Uninstall Office 2007, and then install 2010."
,keystone101,2011-07-07T03:34Z,HI..program worked fine...grats and thanks...unfortunately for me I had already uninstalled 2010 and it came up with the same issue about running out of time when I reinstalled your version. Is there a way around this?
,radische,2011-07-08T08:42Z,"Installed properly ... however, it evidently did not activate (at least that is what the program tells me when I click on ""Help""). Will the program(s) not work 30 days from now?"
,FelipeXmc,2011-07-29T18:18Z,This is BS! Pre-activated my ass! Thought it worked but its telling me I got 4 days left!
,techfree,2011-08-27T01:12Z,This isn't working. the program installed but is not activated. what should i have done differently? please help
,TheGingerGuy2k11,2011-08-29T15:15Z,"I tried to install Office when this message came up and cancelled the install:

'Error 1935. An error occurred during the installation of assembly component {39A436F1-525F-4D9C-95E5-01D682F0FB25} HRESULT:0x8002802F.'

I was installing it on Windows Home Basic 32-bit. Any help? And is anybody else having the same problem?"
,TheGingerGuy2k11,2011-08-29T15:20Z,I mean't Window Vista Home Basic 32-bit.
,TheGingerGuy2k11,2011-08-29T15:20Z,I mean't Windows Vista Home Basic 32-bit. Sorry.

,TheAeroHacker,2011-09-04T17:47Z,"Okay guys, I am so sorry that some of you couldn't activate this, if you are having any problems activating this just download the Microsoft Office 2010 Toolkit, or email me (TheAeroHacker @ Hotmail) and I will send you the download.... The torrent used to work before, but I guess it won't activate itself anymore."
,roflman1,2011-09-14T05:16Z,"This is awesome. I've downloaded it once already and it's working on my windows 7 virtual machine, and now I'm downloading it for XP. Didn't even have to activate it. Thanks"
