,robbinz,2011-06-16T11:03Z,Hmm. I am downloading now so will check with virus scan once complete but im sure its good :)
,robbinz,2011-06-16T11:08Z,"Finished. Scanned with ESET and Malwarebytes and everything is fine.

Geordieshore123 you are trolling scum.

Sensim thank you very much for a quality torrent :)"
,sensim,2011-06-16T19:40Z,"sorry about scrolling through sky and that, it's the best you can get without it being released on dvd. that guy has deleted the comment he made anyway, the doyle. glad you enjoyed"
,DalittleBIGmen,2011-06-16T19:53Z,"Thanks sensim!!!

There is NO virus for all who where concern. 

Video quality is acceptable but not the best. I saw the point of the mouse all over the video, and it appers couple of times the pop up menu from the cable box, there are black frames in the video but you can get rid of them pretty easy with vlc->video->crop. And last the quality of the video is not good, watchable in a laptop but not in a tv.

Not complaining just saying so other can be aware.

I'm seeding!!!

Cheers"
,fraserfinlay777,2011-06-16T23:24Z,"Fixed the screen by using vlc crop.

Great torrent

A:9
V:8

Gets a bit laggy sometimes (using vlc) but nothing too major.

Thanks uploader! +1"
