Love is the common denominator




â€œWhen your thoughts emanate from a mind purified by love, they will result in Right Action, which is Dharma, When Love becomes part of your experience, thought and action you get Shanthi (Peace). 

When we comprehend Love clearly, Ahimsa or non-violence will result automatically. So, Love is the unseen undercurrent binding all the four values. It can be summarised thus: Love in thoughts is Sathya (Truth); Love in feelings is Shanthi (Peace); 


Love in action is Dharma (Righteousness) and Love in understanding is Ahimsa (Non-Violence). Love is the common denominator for all these values. It is the form of God, for God is love. One who gives Love is a man and one who fails to nourish this love is a beast. Love, or absence of Love makes one an animal, man or God.
