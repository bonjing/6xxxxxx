,DeMasque,2011-11-20T05:23Z,"""Pff, those people were enjoying things. So I told them what they like is laughable. I sure showed them!"""
,Teddikilla,2011-12-13T19:59Z,"^What he said, I uploaded it in dubbed because some people like dubbed. There is many many more Subbed versions of this out there. Much Much easier to find, this is uploaded because Some people Prrefer dubs, And they are Harder to find.. "
,shishkaboo,2012-01-18T09:14Z,"Just, to let you know. This version has little cuts everywhere, like tiny scenes, cut from here and there, that whoever did this, felt are not important, maybe to make each episode a few minutes shorter so fits broadcasting slot better  or something. I believe it was probably made by dubbers or American TV broadcasting company (since the source is from TV) I wasn't able to find a different dubbed torrent (I believe that's because English DVD set wasn't released) Japanese versions don't seem to have those cuts.  So, if you are ok with tiny cuts, but eng dub then it is all good. I don't think it is fault of encoder or uploader in any way, so thank you Teddikilla for this."
,topk,2012-04-23T20:38Z,is the english dub professional or amateur self-made?
,oo_500,2012-05-25T09:23Z,"There's an annoying watermark, I couldn't stand it."
