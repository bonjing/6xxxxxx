When I download a file that has only one file, is it possible for me to break my downloaded file in two so that I may copy onto a dvd with limited space. widows media player will not allow me to do this so I always have to find a torrent with at leaste 2 files so I can fit each file onto its own respective disc (1of2-2of2) Your ufc ppvs are allways in multiple files so it is great when I can DL strait from you. If you understand my issue im having please let me know I would give you my email to explain if its at all a lengthy process but if its as simple as DL a new or diffrent media player great. Im not sure how or if you recive comments on your torrents so Im gonna paste a few of these on various torrents & maybe Ill get lucky. As always Love your quality and will seed as long as possible.Thanks "
