[T],rjaa,2011-06-23T15:24Z,"
IMPORTANT - When you install updates, make sure you do not install KB971033. You will see it is un-ticked, do not install it. I would recommend hiding it (right mouse click on the update) so you don't install it accidentally.

If you have installed update KB971033, download REMOVE WAT. It's much easier not to install the update in the first place."

,AbdulTapix,2011-06-30T05:13Z,"Thank you a lot, this torrent works perfectly!
I installed it on a virtual machine with VMware Fusion directly from the iso image.

Works really well!"
,trollopface,2011-06-30T12:12Z,Whether you either do a completely fresh install OR just an update from the cd YOU MUST NOT INSTALL WITH UPDATES. Only install the updates manually when you have installed windows 7 and choose for it not to install the updates until you have checked them. You can install them all EXCEPT KB971033 - If you are having activation problems THAT IS WHERE YOU HAVE GONE WRONG. I have installed this (Windows 7 MSDN Ultimate 32-bit) on all the PCs in my house and it works fine. You MUST watch out for activation related updates. Read the above comments this has been explained already.

,pumbala,2011-07-12T03:53Z,"khaoticc - an iso file is an ""image"" of a CD or DVD - in this case, a DVD because of the size.  Use any DVD-burning software (there's a lot on here) and any DVD burner to create a DVD, and use the DVD to install Windows 7."

,rhos22,2011-07-26T16:22Z,"I still haven't found this anywhere on here, but I can't seem to find out if this is SP1.  Does this include service pack 1.  Regrettably people that if this is just the release without SP1, then you aren't going to have an activated copy. 

You really need SP1 because of the security issues and performance.  

So heres my complaint.  Basically everyone downloading this, is starting with a 2009 pirated copy of windows.

Microsoft is well aware of the first verisons of their software to pirated and thus its easy for them to detect, keys, blacklisted, build numbers already activated.  Its not just one update that you have to avoid, theres about a dozen , like using anyother microsoft product (office) already looks for the well known pirated copies and insists you missed an update.

I'm just saying this is kinda silly, people really need to download a recent july 2011 /may build with SP1, already way past 90 different problems we've already overcome in the last 2 years.

You have people on here asking what the heck an ISO is and what do they do with it.  It surprises me how filled up the comments get with questions like whats an RTF, why couldn't you just make it a txt file. LOL.

The point is, theres going to be so much more whining. 

But theres experienced users like myself, back from the days of commodore and bbs'ing.  I simply might download this, and 3 days later, bang, slip of the mind, forgot not to install that update.

Though its a toss up, this is a really nicely organized copy of both x86 and x64


I'm reading that it's untouched, but they are selling Sp1 included now.  

Updatable ?  There is now two patches / hot fixs that unactivate / mark a pirate copy.
The first was able to detect an untouched copy that was pirated.  (which is this verison really)
second was after sp1, but people got around that.

The problem with this is, your going to get flagged during the update, so I dont see why not just put sp1 "
