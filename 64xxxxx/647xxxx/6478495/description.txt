From Wikipedia:

Nathan Barley is a Channel 4 sitcom written by Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris, starring Nicholas Burns, Julian Barratt and Claire Keelan. The series of six weekly episodes began broadcasting on 11 February 2005 on Channel 4. Described by his creator as a "meaningless strutting cadaver-in-waiting", the character originated on Brooker's TVGoHome â€“ a website parodying television listings â€“ as the focus of a fly-on-the-wall documentary called Cunt.

NOTES:

If you're looking for HD content, then please look elsewhere...

All my torrents will be in MP4 format (at lower resolutions), for the sake of keeping file sizes small.

Perfectly watchable, and most suited to those with mobile devices capable of playing MP4 (ipod, mobiles etc.).

This will play on PC / Mac also. Codec may be required under Windows.

If you have problems playing ANY video format then I reccomend the free K-Lite Codec Pack from:

I know it's clichÃ© to say it, but please seed, or at the very least upload as much as you download. Cheers.
