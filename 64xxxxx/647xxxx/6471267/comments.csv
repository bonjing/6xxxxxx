CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Sources:
Video: Floppydisk - thx
Audio: EP1C - thx
very good line and all in sync :P

Encode:
well that was load of work, as you may have noticed the video was good but the gamma was way too much.
its so bright that every black is grey and white, makes it unwatchable on my big tv.
Had to do a complete makeover scene by scene, cut in pieces and repair what needed to be done.
Scenes at daylight are now very good, darker scenes are brightened up as needed, colouring is fixed troughout as much as possible.
its way better now and watchable, as you can see from the pics and the extra long sample.
Audio needed some work too, fixed that noise and hiss and cleaned it up so that the voices are clearer.
Removed the floppydisk logo at the beginning - sorry m8 - dont want it at the beginning.

Title is fixed-cleaned, just because i fixed the problems and cleaned the audio. :D

Hope you appreciate the 7 hour work!
nice print always wait for cm8 releases thanks.."
