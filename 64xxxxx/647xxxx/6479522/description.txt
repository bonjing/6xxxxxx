CheckOutEr: Hey, guys! Please add me as trusted at SuprBay! Thanks a Lot!

There are different varieties of patches for all Kaspersky products from 2010-2011.

*Solution for problems regarding deactivating or automatic key deletion after reboot*

1.) Disable self-defense and exit kaspersky
2.) Install the crack
3.) Disable self-defense and exit kaspersky
4.) Find fltlib.dll and fltlib.ini and change their permissions. check "write" on deny permission.
5.) Make this 2 files as read-only.
7.) Open kaspersky and update.
8.) Reboot PC

*Solution to the activation problem after each reboot. All you have to do is, install the crack (as per instructions) and after all that when your product is finally activated, just change the permission of the "Kaspersky Internet Security" folder before reboot/shutdown. Just follow the steps*

1.) Right click on the above stated folder.
2.) Go to the Properties.
3.) Go to Security tab.
4.) Click Advanced.
5.) Click Change Permission.
6.) There may be 3 or more lines, so select every line one at a time and click Edit.
7.) Now check 2 boxes under the Deny section called "Delete subfolders and files" and    "Delete".
8.) Do the same for every line and click apply and ok as required.

That's all, now Kaspersky just can't delete anything from that folder neither can you until you revert everything to default. So, No more crack applying.
I hope it helps you all. Peace. Enjoy!
