Here is another of my big, messy libraries of texts. These are related to Zen Buddhist and Pureland Buddhist traditions and practices, which I found on an old hard drive. These two traditions are sometimes considered complementary: Zen is the more ascentic, disciplined way, while Pureland offers a practice adaptable by lay people for use in their daily lives.

I feel as if I am putting boxes of dusty old documents, unsorted except by the general topics of Zen and Pureland Buddhism, on the sidewalk with an invitation to help yourself.

Formats include .txt, .doc, .rft, .pdf, and .html - nothing in .epub or .mobi. The texts are in English. I suspect that most of these come from the amazing free online libraries of Buddhanet.net, but I am not sure.

May all beings be happy, and may all beings who download this torrent help to seed it. Feel free to clean up this collection, change the formats, or do anything you can to share it.
