Camel's first "greatest hits" package, with favorites from 4 of their earlier albums (Mirage, The Snow Goose, Moonmadness, Rain Dances - the group's best period, IMO). This is a great introduction to the progressive period of this superb group. Ripped in lossless FLAC. Includes scanned cover art. Enjoy, and don't forget to seed!
