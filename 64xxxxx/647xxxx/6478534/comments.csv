,aradiel,2011-06-18T16:05Z,"Imageshack does work, they just don't let TPB refer links. All you need to do is use an addon to control referals."
,Halo-101,2011-06-19T00:56Z,http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/60492 - Clearly very good copy better than safcs!:)
,suneelsahu,2011-06-19T03:18Z,@aradiel how to do that ???
,aradiel,2011-06-19T10:57Z,If you use FF then the addon RefControl works perfectly. Then just block imageshack from any referals.
[T],Fig666,2011-06-19T11:51Z,Didnt work for me
,suneelsahu,2011-06-20T03:09Z,@aradiel I use chrome
,aradiel,2011-06-20T09:59Z,"Ah, well in that case you can open a new empty browser window and then paste from there. I'm not familiar enough with Chrome to know how to remove referals."
,fluster84,2011-06-20T15:41Z,Thank you sunDox :)
