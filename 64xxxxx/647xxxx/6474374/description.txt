Formed by the bassist Albert Bell of FORSAKEN fame, NOMAD
SON is a '70s tinged (Hammonds!) doom band drawing
influence from the trailblazing sounds of BLACK SABBATH,
PENTAGRAM, TROUBLE, CANDLEMASS and SAINT VITUS. Doom is NOT
dead... See and hear for yourself checking this molten slab
of HEAVY doom! The versatility of moods and tempos will not
let you fall asleep, instead it can make your head bang
more than once 'cause they know what "uptempo" means!
A truly addictive stuff.


Support the artists! Support the underground! \m/
