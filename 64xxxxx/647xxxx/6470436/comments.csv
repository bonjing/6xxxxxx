,RealJoker,2011-06-16T20:46Z,"I got a small problem. When I open the setup and mount the files onto the drives with Deamon Tools I can't go further. 

It gives this error: The game requires NTFS drive to install. Please choose another drive.

How do I fix that?"
,badboy420,2011-06-16T20:57Z,"""The game requires NTFS drive to install. Please choose another drive"" 

This error is common for many Steam/Gog Games.
U need NTFS Partitioned Hard disk drive..
My guess is That you are using XP.

Backup a partition.Then Right click on My computer> Manage> Disk Management 
Select the partition>Format using NTFS.

Most recent Games require NTFS since FAT32 file system doesnt allow files of greater size to be stored."

Works perfect, install is really simple. If you have any clue how to download torrents and mount imgs, this should be no problem.

Patch 1.1 and 1.2 by badboy420 on his other torrent install perfectly.

Game runs smooth, but it does take a strong computer. I have a Phenom II X4, 8gb of RAM, and an HD 5870 and I'm still on Low settings, medium is a bitch choppy.

Good shit badboy420!"
,shehzadg,2011-07-06T20:20Z,"Oh yeah, I download and tried to install Skidrow's torrent, and it was shit compared to this one."
,max_planck_no_1,2011-07-07T11:22Z,"Install process.

Use daemon tools lite to mount disk 1 image (google to figure how to do this, easy).


Begin setup, when it tells you to insert next disk, switch disk 1 for 2. And then 2 for 3.

Finally, after disk 3 is installed, mount disk 1 again to finish the setup.

Then, download this torrent which is patches 1.1 and 1.2 (to patch you game to latest patch of ver 1.2)

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6476862/The_Witcher_2_-_Assassins_of_Kings_-_Update_1.2

Install patch 1 and then after that patch 2. 

Play the game from the launcher.


Additional note, on ATI HD 5870, I initially had problems with low res textures. To fix that, change the mipmap detail settings to max quality (as opposed to max performance) from ATI catalyst or AMD vision or whatever program you use to adjust graphics settings. Then everything works out

I cant believe ppl are still downloading skidrow. Bunch of monkey see monkey do morons, let the idiots suffer if they cant locate a good torrent"

,sickboy09sumi,2011-07-12T22:12Z,"@Dezarius

You should read the nfo file. It is very short and precise with instructions. If you don't have a nfo reader then just download from tpb. For your sake here are the instructions by the uploader:
1)Make sure you have the latest Display Drivers and DirectX installed
RUN THE FILE ""setup_the_witcher_2.exe"" present in the 1st DVD
2)Press SKIP immediately When you get the message ""Checking File 
integrity,Please wait."",and Proceed with setup.
3)When it asks for Files mount the required disks with Daemon and Proceed...
4) You need to run Patcher 1.1 before u install the 1.2 Patch
5)Enjoy a DRM Free Release"
,Dezarius,2011-07-13T22:04Z,"@ Sickboy. Ehm yeah I have read that like a million times. Still not getting it.

Run the file, then mount all the files at once ? 1-2-3 and it installs them in order ? Cause when I just mount Disk 1, the installation completes before I get to mount the other disks. 

If you could explain the process as detailed as possible that would be nice. Thanks in advance."

,Skattik,2011-08-23T12:28Z,"PLEASE HELP! :o) Made a login just to ask this.

Like some other peeps, I'm also having a problem with the sound files being corrupt. I mound CD1 for the fourth and final time, and after a minute or so (frustratingly close to full installation) it comes up with an error along the lines of:

Installation failed
E\.........sound\gui_menu_music
Source file is corrupted.

Seriously? It installs practically everything, then aborts it all because of some stupid menu music? I'd turn that off anyway! Very annoying!

I already re-checked the files, and the same thing happened. Do I need to download the entire thing again? If so... its not worth it I guess.

Any help? "
,badboy420,2011-08-23T21:19Z,"@ Skattik 

U dont have to redownload..
Make sure that the partition ur trying to install has at-least 16 Gb free space + its NTFS file system 

Just Stop the torrent. Then give Force Recheck..
Try reinstalling..
Mount the disks in Daemon when asked by setup in the following order 

Disk1>Disk2>Disk3> and then Disk 1 to finish Setup...

,Skattik,2011-08-24T15:01Z,"Thanks for the response Badboy...

I already did all that... My harddrive does have 16 gig free, and it is NTFS formatted. And I already did a force recheck and tried installing it again. It didn't work, and I got exactly the same error (despite the recheck).

I am using a diff mounter, called ISOdisk, instead of daemon... I havent had any problems with it before... could it be something as simple as that? Or am I being a fool in some other way somehow? :o)

I realise it must be me, as no one is having problems. :p"

Cheers for the link, I'll download it for future use.

Turns out a mate of mine has bought this game, and he's lent me the discs, so that's a lot easier... maybe using daemon would have solved it, and although I'm curious as to how to solve it, I think I'll just take the easy route. Still free I guess!!
