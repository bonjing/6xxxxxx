NOTE to first time users (like myself):
(I'm running Windows XP Pro SP3 and using WAMP Server installer with PHP v5.3.5 / MySQL v5.5.8 and Apache 2.2.1.7)

To install, point your browser to the 'system' folder on your server (e.g. http://localhost/ExpressionEngine2.1.3/system/) to start the installer.

If you get an Error Number 1064 during installation you need to do two small changes:

you need to replace TYPE=MyISAM with ENGINE=MyISAM  here:
1. â€œsystem/installer/updates/ud_200.phpâ€
2. â€œsystem/installer/schema/mysql_schema.phpâ€

And that's it, you have ExpressionEngine v2.1.3. installed!
