,Albeda74,2011-06-18T15:19Z,"I'm pushing my luck with my ISP as it is... :)  The original is a dual-layer DVD nearly 6 gigs in size, and my upload speed is severely throttled.  It's taken me nearly a full day to get this 1.5 gigs out there.

This *does* have uncompressed PCM audio (the important part), and I went with a file size twice my usual size (700 megs) to preserve video fidelity."
