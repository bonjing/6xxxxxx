,J3ennett,2011-06-21T18:45Z,Wouldn't work for me. Said codec error with audio. Shame cuz it downloaded really quick
,geoffp,2011-06-22T03:29Z,Downloaded in minutes with excellent playback considering the small file size. THANKS!
,YtownRedRum187,2011-06-23T06:27Z,"@ geoffp - Try downloading the AC3 audio codec pack. It's funny, really. The more codec packs you have on your computer, the less chance your file is to play... Learned this when using TVersity to stream my downloads through my computer to my DirecTV HD receiver."

,repetitiousous,2011-07-15T17:47Z,The quality is bull. V 7. You can watch it but not ENJOY it. How can you get such shitty result with x264?? Learn to use these codecs. I've seen 10 times better 1280x720 resolution 500MB BRrips.
