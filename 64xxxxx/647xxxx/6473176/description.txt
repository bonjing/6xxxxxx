Linking five continents, championed by the likes of Patrick Forge and Joe Clausell, sponsored by the New Zealand Arts Council, and praised the world over, Mark launched his much-anticipated debut album in July 2000. Snapping hard at the heals of the sublime \\\'El Dia Perfecto\\\' single (think chilled Underworld vocoder over vigorous Brazilian percussive workout), the album shows that he has much more to offer. \\\'Melodious Funk\\\' using THAT Gangstarr sample, the expressive jazzy house of \\\'Cosmic Echoes\\\', the 4 Hero-esque orchestral ambience of \\\'Mindscape\\\', and the intense percussive deluge of \\\'Motherland\\\'. Check it. Straight No Chaser, Sept 2000

...Call it nu-jazz, call it nu-house, call it future-jazz - in fact, call it what you want. I\\\'m sticking with the words \\\'awesome\\\' and \\\'genius\\\'. 9/10 Wax Magazine

Future funk from keyboardist Mark De Clive-Lowe -- a stunning blend of retro influences and forward thinking rhythms -- all filtered down into one incredibly hip album of instrumental tracks that almost sound like a 21st Century take on soul jazz! The album\\\'s got some nicely percolated beats -- almost London broken, but not quite out there -- more inside, which provides a perfect place for Mark to open up on the keys -- skipping a groove nicely on a mix of Fender Rhodes and other keyboards!

FYI:
While much New Zealand music is well known at home, in the greater world few are familiar with our household names.  This results in relatively little activity on this and other NZ music torrents.
Furthermore- In NZ we have broadband capacity and speed limits, while in most of the rest of the world (particularly Europe and America) there are no bandwidth restrictions.
These two factors make it difficult to seed new NZ music torrents from NZ.  It is particularly frustrating when leechers in restrictionless countries do not seed back what they download because that makes keeping the torrent alive a slow and costly task.
Pleeeeaaase- help support this torrent by seeding it back for as long as possible.
