This is it, the album where psychedelia, techno and blues rock all blend together in one blissful mix. With one foot in Beggars Banquet-era Stones (the gospel-rock Movin' on Up) and the other in the trippy soundscapes of rave culture (the Orb-produced Higher Than the Sun), Primal Scream caught the mind-blown euphoria of Ecstacy better than anyone. Released 20 years ago, it doesn't sound horribly dated, partly due to Andy Weatherall's incredible production. Screamadelica is a modern classic, and one of my all time favourites.
