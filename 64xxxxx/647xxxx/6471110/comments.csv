,jsho123,2011-06-17T08:20Z,"I hope nobody really uses these registry cleaners. No offense to the uploader (although I probably have offended you), but registry cleaners often cause more damage to your Windows system than anything. They render a lot of programs inoperable and can render your operating system useless. Never download or use anything that claims it can ""fix it all in one click."""

Linux i dont know,who are so worried about the PC then do not download programs in the copjuter that  simple."
