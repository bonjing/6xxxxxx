- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Our revolution revolves around life, Life revolves around the sun, And the sun
  supports the way of life, But the mind of humanity revolves around itself.
  We're all a great disgrace!' Taken from Same Old Story's debut album A Great
  Disgrace the intent is clear, not just to play great powerful melodic pop-punk
  but also to give us a message that there is one world and we need to look
  after it. This release has been a while in coming and the band have had time
  to develop it before the recording. They are touring now around the UK and
  Europe with Misconduct and ripping things up in the style of Millencolin,
  Green Day and Rise Against. This new CD, supported by a new video and tour,
  will not disappoint you.
