,paradox2011,2011-06-18T11:23Z,u need to copy and paste the links to your browser cant just click them
,FridayToker,2011-06-18T12:06Z,"@paradox2011 

Good Thinking Batman! :)"
,pari12,2011-06-18T14:26Z,pic links still don't work if you copy and paste
,Cameigons,2011-06-18T16:17Z,The copying and pasting instead of clicking worked for me.
,TorVariad,2011-06-18T18:14Z,"Hmm, it would be nice if just 1 of the seeders returned...*sigh*"
,Cameigons,2011-06-18T19:19Z,"Yeah, no seeders in sight on the swarm right now."
,FridayToker,2011-06-18T22:18Z,There is now over 400 seeders!
,Cameigons,2011-06-19T02:00Z,"This happens a lot, from 2/3 seeders it jumps to 100 or more just like that. I guess it happens when initial seeders got slow connections. I was monitoring everyone(me included) stuck at 95% and advancing on ""slow motion""...  but once someone with fast connection becomes a seeder it's like wild fire. :)"

,Cameigons,2011-06-19T20:34Z,"This one is good. I found the one with hebrew subs slightly better though.
The obvious downside might the subs themselves."
,sniperphd,2011-06-19T23:02Z,screw being hebrew.  english only & talk about quality not links. if they show links it's the only best ones

do so at your own risk."

people are not going to pay you to download your movie!"
,Cryptical654,2011-06-21T10:07Z,"The audio and video are pretty good considering it was some dude filming in a crowded theater. Every now and then some shadow gets up and walks across the screen. Very MST3K. The whole time I was watching the X-Men duke it out with people I was worried that some suspicious usher was gonna creep up and kick your ass out of the movie. LOL.

How's the movie? If I were a movie critic I'd say the movie is okay. Some cute mutant brawds to ogle. There's a funny Wolverine cameo."
,Grappler_Master,2011-07-04T13:57Z,"LMAO!!!!!!!! 

FridayToker,""Alright, now that my torrent is up, let me post some screens. Hmm... they didn't work. Np, I'll just post some more... Hmm... Those aren't working either. Np. Third times the charm! Hmm... Those don't work either..... FUCK IMAGE SHACK!""
