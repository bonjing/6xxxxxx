X-Men First Class



Xmen: First Class is simply fantastic. Strong emotion and explosive action. The acting is top notch. Delivery from every actor is at it\'s best, more so from Mystique, Beast, Xavier and Magneto.

The story is more character based than action, however the action sequences are still superb. Personally I\'d have liked to of seen it being a 15 and have a more adult but it wasn\'t a big issue. Also some more background story from the bad super\'s would have been good but again this wasn\'t too much of an issue and would leave some nice room for upcoming X-men movies.
