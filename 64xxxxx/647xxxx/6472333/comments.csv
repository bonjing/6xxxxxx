Well that's exactly the problem - 6 BDs. I hated the split DVDs, which I did buy, and now they've made the same mistake with the blu-rays, so I'm not buying them this time. I'm not gonna feel bad when I've spent more than enough money on these films already through previous purchases and cinema tickets."

,Danenoob,2011-06-19T17:31Z,"People need to chill out and be a little patient. You've been waiting forever for the extended blurays to come out, so you should be able to wait just a little longer. If you can't wait you should have downloaded the 720p rip. But I'm telling you this one is worth the wait ;)"
,omnimodis,2011-06-19T18:50Z,"@pbxpb, this is a full widescreen aspect ratio, so because cinema screens are wider than our monitors, the only way to present the movie it its original screen ratio, is to present it with the black bars.  When you watch a movie without the black bars, you're actually watching a chopped version (properly called pan & scan), so you actually had that the wrong way around.  Widescreen = original, fullscreen = chopped."
,Boglin,2011-06-19T23:28Z,This release does not have hardcoded subs. there is a wiki elvish sub pack available if you search for it.

,pbxpb,2011-06-20T10:40Z,"any chance this can be changed to 16:9 aspect ratio?
the 2.40:1 aspect ratio doesnt play full screen(checked out the sample) thus downloading something this big and then not finding any difference with dvd edition makes it suck!! :( no offence to uploaders (peace) :) but guys like me who have no blue ray players or 40+inch telescreens will not find the difference if its not full screen (i play it on 23"" monitor) and people THIS QUALITY IS VERY GOOD AFTER CHECKING OUT THE SAMPLE but its not 16:9 so it wont play fullscreen it will be chopped at the top and bottom a pity :( will some one release a full screen version please   @insinuendo no offence   "

,lonewolf1,2011-06-22T15:37Z,"So if the subs arent really working properly for the Elvish then doesnt that mean its really quite difficult to watch properly. You cant keep turning on and off the english subs when you need them, I dont want them always running as they will distract from the movie. There is a lot of elvish in the movies too, so you cant just not use any subs at all. Shame really as this u/l and quality look top notch judging by the size of the download. "

However one big question : how is this even possible? I thought the blu-ray will be released on the 28th of June 2011, that is to say in 5 days? So is this the extended edition blu ray, or is this the theatrical edition blu ray, with the extended parts taken from upscaled DVD source? Thanks for your answer!"
,Sargeras9,2011-06-23T16:43Z,"@insinuendo There seems to be a problem with every sub out there and this upload:

Subs that come with the torrent:
Fellowship goes out of sync 1:46:20 (line 1036)
Two Towers goes out of sync 1:46:45 (line 1045)
Return of the King goes out of sync 2:07:56 (line 1156)

Subs that you linked to:
Fellowship goes out of sync 1:46:20 (line 43)
Two Towers goes out of sync 1:51:10 (line 3)
Return of the King goes out of sync 2:12:51 (line 5)

Every sub I can find goes out of sync in the same place in all three movies, which means this upload of the extended edition is different than all the others.... someone needs to make special subs for this version, at least for the lines in elvish. Thanks for the upload bro, the movies themselves are great quality, I just wanted to bring this to the attention of everyone else like me who has been scratching their heads."
,Sargeras9,2011-06-23T18:05Z,"Hey everyone, I went ahead and fixed the subs insinuendo posted above. I just had to shift all the subtitles back a few seconds after a certain point in the movies, and they all aligned perfectly after that. I guess the bluray versions of these movies added a couple extra seconds in somewhere, throwing all the subs off. Someone else can fix the full english that come in the torrent, I didn't feel like it. :D

Do the others yourself, its very simple : download the sub for the EE dvdrip, and stretch the first and last sub accordingly to these BR movies. (use subsync or whatever) . strangely the dvdrip are a bit shorter in time but when you stretch the DVDsubs like I described the subs do match up. Guess that means the blurayEE runs a bit slower compared to the DVDEE. Anyway, it works ;)"

I can only echo what other people have said. It is totally worth it.

If you are like me and you're kind of happy with most movies to be I dunno about 3 gig and 720 just to watch, but when it comes to your all time favourites you want really good quality 1080s for playing on the big big TV, then you need to get this release. Or buy the bluray! Hahhahaha. No, but seriously...

It just remains for me to thank the encoders, the uploaders and everyone seeding. Thank-you. :)

,jamecam,2011-06-25T11:37Z,"First off, thanks for the release.  The quality is excellent in all three videos.

I have to ask, why did you stray from the mod16 resolutions for Two Towers and Return of the King?  This makes it so that anyone wishing to hardcode the elvish-only subtitles must reencode the entire video.

How did you manage to create non mod16 dimensions without the nasty green bars in the leftover space?"

,rlhq23,2011-06-29T21:38Z,"I play most of my films through my PS3. I run them through MKV2VOB, maintaining the DTS audio track. However, my receiver and 5.1 setup do not support DTS-HD MA, and I have an older 60gb (fat) PS3 so it does not support DTS-HD MA either. The specifications for these files note that the audio track is 6.1 DTS-HD MA. 
   So, my question is...will the PS3 or receiver automatically scale down the signal to make it compatible, similar to how 5.1 AC3 can be automatically scaled down to 2 channel? If not, will the muxing program solve the issue whilst maintaining the DTS format and bitrate (rather than scaling the entire audio track down to 640kbs AC3)? If anyone could please provide me with some answers or point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated. I don't want to download an 80gb film because of visual improvments (I have the previous 1080p extended edition release already) only to sacrifice audio quality. Thanks!

The subtitles I posted are the original subtitles that come with the movie.  Not all Elvish lines are subtitled (watch the DVD version to see the what is included in the hardcoded Elvish subtitles).  For example, Elrond's lines at the beginning are not subtitled in the original movie.

And then, it turns out the elf-speak in the Two Towers (haven't watched Return of the King yet) isn't translated in the supplied subs.

Therefore, I am not sure if the missing file/film was caused by that 'break' in the downloading process.  Now my main worry is whether the 2 films that I have downloaded will play or not.

I even wish upload speeds were as high as download speeds so we all could share more. However, this is not so. Limiting how fast others can download only hinders and frustrates those of us who do share. Unfortunately, there will always be those who just hit and run.

,xTobyMcD,2012-01-28T00:29Z,"Been downloading this for about 20 hours now, only on 28% :P

Anyway, I've finally downloaded all the samples and after watching them briefly I can safely say they look amazing and the sound is great. I previously downloaded a more compressed version before, and this one is ten times better quality - well worth the wait!"
,DoesThisLookInfected,2012-01-28T22:44Z,"been downloading for 1w 1d and only 70% done, 78.5 kB/s average..... wow worst seed to peer ratio ever especially for a torrent thats almost 80gigs c'mon ppl help a brother out.  i've already uploaded over 100gigs myself and im planning on seeding as long as is needed, but i just want this 2 b done already."
,Alarihos,2012-01-30T00:08Z,"He must be perfect Video and audio but the size of the files is ridiculous... ((77.96 GB)) for one trilogy?
i have this trilogy from there with perfect audio and video and only 12 gb... at least look perfect in my 27 inch screen.

,SBonesE8,2012-02-08T00:47Z,would u recomend i turn off via audio deck or lower bass an treble with equalizer on? im gonna use the new dvd fab an before with convertx2 dvd it always seemed WAY loud then way quiet during whispering is why im wondering...an still audio never seems quite perfect levels i wish i knew what to set for perfect audio
,ironymon,2012-02-08T08:22Z,"My advice, for someone with limited bandwidth... for example me. 200gb + - a month. I can of course download this in a matter of a day or two, depending on the seeders. Let's just put it this way... if you're gonna download this you might've just buy the blu-rays. Now the size of these is 1/3 of the original i assume. So 1 lotr film would be somewhere 30-70gb... 4 hours 70 definitely."

,FatFreddy247,2012-03-08T23:48Z,"can anyone give me some advice:

these files play fine on my PC with VLC Media Player although only in stereo.

when i stream them to my network connected blu-ray player the video stutters, stops then speeds up and i get very broken sound.

if i pop one of the files to a usb stick and pop it into the usb slot on the tv plays fine in stereo

if i burn a file to blank blu-ray as data i get the same issue as streaming so its not a network bottleneck issue (gigabit/switched)

other MKV's i have downloaded from here play fine except the Jurassic Park Trilogy they are jumpy too

I'm in the process of making a tutorial on how to encode your own hardcoded subs into this release (for Elvish/English parts), but I also want to show how to style the subs so that they appear with the pretty font/lettering from the movies.

Anyone know what fonts are used? Anyone have any screenshots of the fonts from the retail versions?"

,xdaxdbxdc,2012-05-02T08:29Z,I'm not happy with the video quality on this. It might just be the source Bluray... but the video is so grainy its not worth the massive file size. Much better off with a smaller copy of the film I don't think you would notice.
