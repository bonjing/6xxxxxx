The Toy That Saved Christmas, 1996

Mr. Nezzer's TV commercials have convinced all of Dinkletown that "Christmas is when you get stuff!" With the children whining and begging for more toys, it's sure to be the worst Christmas ever ... until one brave little Buzz-Saw Louie doll decides to take matters into his own hands! The Toy That Saved Christmas teaches children that "Christmas isn't about getting, it's about giving."
