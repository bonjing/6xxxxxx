,GrosShadock,2011-06-18T14:17Z,"Same size than this one posted a few hours earlier : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6478054/Green_Lantern_2011_CAM-P2P

So, probably the same... but the 1st one has more seeders."
,LEERV,2011-06-18T15:56Z,"It's a shame 'cos it works fine but the quality is crap, it's done on a low res cam. Thanks for the effort though!!!!! A 3/10, V 3/10"

,haze4evr2,2011-06-18T17:14Z,A4 & V3. At one point it looks like the camera is covered up because it goes black with just the audio.  Wait for better.  Plays fine with VLC media player.
,Shoobox,2011-06-18T17:37Z,"its real,
vlc player playback,
 such low quality though and can't use full screen
sound is loud enough with echo but clear.
video is real dark and flashes alot.
if you have to watch this release do it at night time or a dark room for better viewing.
A/5
V/4"

,whiteknight1962,2011-06-18T20:22Z,"I concur with previous comments, this is REAL video, but poor quality, out of focus, best to wait a few days for someone to post better copy. I deleted this after 5 minutes so I can enjoy it better. 

Good try tykoon, thanks for upload"
