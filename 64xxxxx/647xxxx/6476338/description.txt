Saul Williams - The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust! (inst. ver.)
================================================================================
Yes, the instrumental version, your eyes aren't lying to you!
Taken from promotional CD, this is as close as it gets to unreleased
Nine Inch Nails / Tapeworm tracks: usage of material from both projects
on Saul's album was confirmed by Trent Reznor himself.
I'm aware that the song "Convict Colony" is missing, don't ask me where to get it.
I'm also aware that some audiophiles would like a EAC rip in lossless format, but
you'll have to live with 192k MP3 for now, even this will upload rather slowly.
Please just have patience; yelling "seed, seed, seed" is not necessary.

P. S.
if you liked it, please support Saul Williams and buy the retail album, it has
his wonderful singing and bonus tracks. His earlier albums (Amethyst Rockstar
and Saul Williams) and a recent one (Volcanic Sunlight) are quite good too.

this upload is dedicated to ETS, you know who you are!
