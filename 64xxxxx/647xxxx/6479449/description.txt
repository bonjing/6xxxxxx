I know ive said this before, but im new to the download scene, so be patient if im not doing this right, im learning as I go. I have 500+ movies on my external 1TB hard drive and fast cable connection. I try to add new movies weekly to my collection and post them when i have time. I will seed for a little while, after that its up to the community to keep it going.
