Open each zip file once all are downloaded and extract the ""setup.part(nn)"" files, you can ignore the ""file.id.diz"" but REMEMBER to note and extract the ""keygen.exe"" and CORE files.

Now, with your zip tool, open the first ""setup.part01.rar"" file.  Choose to ""extract"" if required.

This will compile the full ""setup.exe"" from all the other .rar files, the result will be a 380+ meg setup file.

Run this as a standard setup.

When asked for a s/n use the keygen.ext to generate the key and add it where needed.

That should work for you.

NOTE:  I cannot verify whether this works with these specific files.  I haven't had time to test it on my system."
