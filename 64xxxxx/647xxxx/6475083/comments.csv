,keerochee,2011-06-17T12:52Z,would like to ask if you can upload the agony and the ecstasy 1965 and the ten commandments 1956 same format you usually rip? thanks again.
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-18T09:08Z,"Can't do The Agony and the Ecstasy as there is no source available. I've queued up a source for The Ten Commandments (1965), release will take a while though. Stay tuned :)"
,keerochee,2011-06-18T13:13Z,thanks in advance. i will wait for the rip.
