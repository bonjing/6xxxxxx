for a cam, the only downer is the audio cuz it's pretty crappy. timing is on but it's just really tinny. there's epic scenes in this movie and good sound is crucial. Thanks for the upload though it is much appreciated!"

Overall: Not a bad cam rip! Most DEFINITELY watchable. Would like to see it more clearly and with better sound. Can't wait! Good job, sceneline/EP1C!!"

I was like finish eating that sh*t, and I was like- shouldn't you wait till after to eat some loud ass food, what about some gummi worms or something? other than that, but that was a sound you couldn't tune out, and it went on for about 41 minutes which is about half, that was brutal.
