Cold Driven was formed in early 2005 by founding memberÂ’s vocalist Billy
Nickell, bassist Dennis Nickell, guitarist Shane Bouthillier and guitarist
Ben BouthillierÂ’s mutual passion for creating unique and original music.
With the rock solid foundation of this band being brothers and friends they
recorded their debut album, Â“Set In StoneÂ” (2005) and established themselves
as a fresh new force in music, that revealed a multi-faceted group which
thrives on creative exploration and escape.

With the nationwide release of Â“Steel ChambersÂ” (2007), Cold Driven further
reinforced their distinctive sound. On the strength of those songs, and
extensive touring across Canada in 2008, CD pushed their first single
Â“Heavier Than HeavenÂ” to number 51 on the Canadian rock charts, solidifying
a strong fan base across the country. The year also brought the band a top 5
winning slot in the Vancouver Fox 99.3 Seeds competition.

With recent changes to the band, CD looked to drummer and longtime friend
Jeremy McLachlan from their hometown of Armstrong, B.C. to become their
fifth and final member. With the core of the band together they now have
their sights set on recording an explosive third record with producer Danny
Craig from platinum recording artists Default.

Cold Driven has shared the stage with: Default, Thornley, The Veer Union,
State Of Shock, Corb Lund, Danko Jones, and Sam Roberts.
