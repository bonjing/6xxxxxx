,idxcue,2011-07-07T01:44Z,"This is bullshit. Jesse Venture is a Quack. The documents included are all cleared by the Freedom of Information Act. You can google them. Clearly the Government doesn't give a shit about these documents. How could he publish this book if that were the case...

This type of Conspiracy Mongering is the death of common sense. 9-11 WAS a conspiracy... by Muslim extermeists. Do you really think the Bush admin were smart enough to pull off a false flag operation to invade a country that didn't attack us. come on people WAKE UP Alex Jones and Jesse Ventura are nuts. Think CRITICALLY. "
,Cosades,2011-07-12T07:50Z,"idxcue, what evidence can you provide to prove your point? The conspiracy theorists provided evidence to back their claims; for instance, the curvature to the collapse of building 7. What actual evidence do you have to suggest that members of the united states' government were not involved?

Critical thinking involves evidence-based reasoning."
,kylejftheone,2011-07-16T08:14Z,"You are all fucking robots, furthermore I say we all lynch  Gorgie bush, Dick c, Donald rums, I cant believe they are still allowed to live or  see the light of day. I think they should be water boarded day and night till they give up the will to live and die. What a sick fucking world we live in fucking cunts load your guns and stop being scared ignorant pussy's. I will be awaiting the revolution lets get this shit started"
,saintamadas,2011-07-21T14:38Z,"@idxcue, you are just too dumb despite the fact that you have a system to search the web for information to keep you balanced. With overwhelming evidence you are yet to come to terms with reality? Have you watched the documentary-SUPERPOWER? American servicemen and women analyzing issues based on information they were fed and the facts on ground. Till date no WMD has been found. You must be very dumb. A great Nigerian musician(FELA) once said, read the book but use your initiative. Why is it that anytime the American won a war it is good planning and whenever they lose its an ambush? @captainelliotspencer, thanks for this informative upload. Its highly appreciated!"
,WideStance,2011-07-24T02:15Z,"""Critical thinking involves evidence-based reasoning.""

This is hilarious. The fact that you yourself describe these people as ""conspiracy theorists"" and not ""people with logical, evidence-based facts"" says more than anything."
,Amaximus,2011-08-03T12:27Z,"Conspiracy theorist is a name normally used to axiomatically discredit someone. Alex Jones is a bit much, and it's too bad, but Ventura gets a lot of the files right. 911 had nothing to do with the US government - aside from some incompetence. Kennedy was hawkish on Vietnam and nobody would assassinate him for any of his policies unless they were well outside the mainstream and that wouldn't have been covered up. Other than that, most of it is fairly accurate and informative. Most of the facts are right even in the cases were I disagree with his conclusions. 

The thing ism, George Bush's connection to 911 is not a solid case in very hard to prove and I doubt he had anything to do with it anyway, BUT, the fact that he's a war criminal is right out in the open. So why try to make this hard to prove easily  self isolating case for 911 when you can pursue him on war crimes - in the sense of getting his place in history right if not an actual court case - although you could make one for war crimes easily and not for 911 - Netherlands Invasion Act notwithstanding.

,exTerrorist,2011-10-27T11:01Z,"Here is a fact for you.
The majority of people in Europe, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and China all think Americans are brainwashed disillusioned idiots and the remainder simply does not care about America.
I know it sounds like stereotyping but I donât think a lot of people from the US cannot criticize that without proving to be a hypocrite."
,kungfupy,2012-01-20T08:15Z,"I have to agree with idxcue, but only about the fact that this stuff has to be bullshit cause if it wasn't don't you think the US Government would kill to have this info seize existence, oh no or maybe that's part of their plan; having the info out there people will just think its more propaganda.. doubt it the Government doesn't think that way, they're to dumb, and they know people are dumb enough to believe this shit. Not saying anything about 911 cause truthfully i don't know what happened. evidence can sometimes be quite misleading, yet again it can be pinpointing. But unless you actually conduct the experiments necessary, then you don't know for sure either, so keep being gullible. But i think in one way or another everyone knows its all political bullshit. "
,kungfupy,2012-01-20T08:25Z,"exTerrorist : what a coincidence because Americans feel the same way about Europe! Although personally i dislike great Briton and don't care much for France, most of Europe are a bunch of morons, Australia is cool in my book, and china i don't have a problem with. And while the rest of the world is just as brainwashed as anyone else, but you wouldn't think so, and that proves my point o0 I admit there are a bunch of retards in America but just like anywhere else, you also have intelligent people who don't always agree with mainstream bullshit. So look in a mirror buddy!"
,kungfupy,2012-01-20T08:30Z,And don't you see that you no body is brought up to respect each others views and work together? War is oh so profitable. Wake up and quit being a yuppy!
,kungfupy,2012-01-20T08:33Z,"mistype: it was just supposed to be no body, not the you preceding."
