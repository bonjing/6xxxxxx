,richardpa,2011-06-13T19:56Z,"@Zombie_Boy...Here's some links that might help you, There's no 480p version but you can always try a 720p version instead...                  http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-1189340/sublanguageid-eng

,Zombie_Boy,2011-06-13T23:07Z,"@richardpa...

None of those subs u provided exactly match this rip unfortunately, thanks for your efforts though bro. 

This 1 below is closest though as its not synced by fewer seconds unlike others:

The Lincoln Lawyer - The Lincoln Lawyer 2011 720p BRrip x264 TehDowns srt subtitle

Its link is here below:

Can any1 sync it to this rip please? I can delay the subs by seconds on vlc player but i need to watch it on my tv screen via my ps3..

,Zombie_Boy,2011-06-13T23:24Z,"Ok ok, i finally i found the correct eng sub! It had just been added on subscene and its works fine with this 1.

,chrispm84,2011-07-31T04:27Z,"@Zombie_Boy

And anyone else that might be interested. If you're not using VLC, download it. If you are, then VLC can adjust the timing of the audio track and subtitles. So, you can sync the audio or subtitles with any file. Very handy. It's not always perfect, but it helps me out a lot."

,DirtyLogic,2011-08-12T19:46Z,"man there's a lot of morons on here.  firstly how can you call this 480p when it's barely 3/5 of 480?  the source is 720 the final result is a height of 304.  also what idiot said this is a great 16x9 widescreen movie?  the aspect ratio on this rip is closer to 45:19  i think both the uploader and some of the users should've stayed in school.  i never released this kind of garbage back in the day, and while it's good for what it is, don't call it something it isn't."
