The band was founded in 1967 by Neco, Aziz Azmet, Ayd?n Daruga and Murat Ses who were previously members of SilÃ¼etler (silhouettes).
However, Neco left the band at the end of 1967. Also, Cahit Berkay, who was a member of SelÃ§uk AlagÃ¶z Band, and Haluk Kunt, who was a member of VahÅŸi Kediler (Wild Cats), both joined the band.
Later, Haluk Kunt was replaced by Hasan Sel, who was a member of ApaÅŸlar (Apachies) in 1968, and Ayd?n Daruga was replaced by Engin YÃ¶rÃ¼ko?lu in 1969.
In 1970, Hasan Sel was replaced by Taner Ã–ngÃ¼r, previously a member of Meteorlar (Meteors) and the Erkin Koray Quartet.
The band tried to fuse the technical aspects of pop music with the melodies of Anatolian folk music in late 1960s and early 1970s
In July 1970, Aziz Azmet, the band\'s vocalist left the band and Ersen Dinleten replaced him for a short time.
Mo?ollar recorded Ternek/HaliÃ§\'te GÃ¼n Bat?ÅŸ? (Ternek/Sunset on the Golden Horn) 45 rpm, and left for Paris in August 1970.
The group won the Grand Prix du Disque of the Charles Cros Academy (previously won by such groups as Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix) in 1971.
Nearly all of the tracks on this album are compositions or traditional arrangements of Murat Ses, the group\'s keyboardist, arranger and composer. This ambum is compelling work from the Turkish scene of the early 70s -- music that fuses rock and folk roots, and which makes heavy use of the Turkish baglama -- an instrument with strong sitar-like qualities.
Most of the tunes here are instrumentals that lay the baglama solos out over heavier rhythms -- in a driving sound that\'s certainly got roots in folk, but which comes off with more of a rock-like intensity.
There\'s a bit of fuzz on some of the instrumentation, but we can\'t tell for sure how much electricity was used by the band -- and although the English language notes on the CD do a great job of laying out the group\'s history and recordings, we wish they\'d give a bit more specifics on that front!
CD features a fair number of bonus tracks, including key recordings done by Mogollar in Paris -- and titles include \"Ozum Kaldi\", \"Misket\", \"Behind The Dark\", \"Hicaz Mandira\", \"Yine Bir Gulnihal\", \"Senhaz Longa\", \"Hitchin\", \"Dag Ve Cocuk\", and \"Garip\".
