Microsoft Office Word 2003 Tutorial 

To install this program:
- Close down all applications
- Insert CD into your CD ROM drive
- It it doesn't then please install using the following method:
Click Start, Run, then type D:\e2003.exe (substitute D for the letter of your CD drive if different) then click on OK

I am not sure if this program will install without the CD, it seems that way on my computer. 
Please leave feedback, if the file does not install I will remove this torrent
