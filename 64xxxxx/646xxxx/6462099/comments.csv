,cabostyle,2011-06-11T16:28Z,thnx bro for cutting off that unknown language:)
,frogshare,2011-06-11T17:05Z,"So, is the picture cut off at the bottom? Because the source has hardcoded Korean subs."
,gussers3,2011-06-11T18:06Z,Saw some screen shots elsewhere and the screen is cut off at the bottom.

,issaq,2011-06-11T18:22Z,hay froggie100 could you give us 720p v without the sub ????
,dotlite,2011-06-11T18:31Z,thanks man you are one of the best :)
,severed1314,2011-06-11T18:33Z,Judging from the sample I would say yes. Wait for a better copy.
,chandlerboy,2011-06-11T20:58Z,This is shit. Basically has a quarter of the picture missing. Would still rather have annoying subs than this. Waste of time.
,Archonin,2011-06-12T00:19Z,"It's much better to watch with the korean subtitles instead of this, way to much has been cut."
,jkeller80,2011-06-12T06:34Z,"I'd rather watch the full screen and ignore subtitles than miss a 25% of the screen.

Froggie100 is always on top though, thanks for giving others the option."

,7thSense,2011-06-12T20:47Z,"I wonder when non subbed version will come out. I have a feeling it'll be the day after I watch this, or considering Gyllenhaal is in this movie, it'll be the day after tomorrow."
,mancbhoy,2011-06-12T21:38Z,"@Kalyn22 are you really tht retarded that you want others to post spoilers on there comments, and stop pretending to be a women!"
,adicto_al_cafe,2011-06-12T22:38Z,The creators had to play half life to create this movie.

,heliorodrigues,2011-06-14T06:59Z,"the copy sucks! 15-20 fps or even less sometimes, its like you are watching slide show movie every second, very annoying! I couldn't watch the movie, because this thing piss you off!"
,Parad0x1,2011-06-14T18:18Z,Terrible frame-rate.
,hurka79,2011-06-15T09:30Z,Stop this work froggie 100! poor job
,ice1505,2011-06-15T09:59Z,"COME ON., if thats a Bluray rip then im the bloody toothfairy, and ill rip all ya teeth out... movie is good, but quality is bad.. this is a good R5 with really good sound, but its neither dvd nor bluray rip... LEARN HOW TO RIP MOVIES, AND WHAT THEY ARE CALLED., TS,TC,R5,SCR,DVD,BRRIP.... 6 different rips, 6 different qualities..

and now for something completely different :-)"
,Zarkow,2011-06-15T15:38Z,"""
NOTE:
I cut off the KORSUB

Should say:
""
I butchered the movie and decided to remove 25% of your viewing space.

,initdos,2011-06-15T16:06Z,"R-6 Release
A-9
V-9

But 3/4 of the original frame. Korean Sub is removed with 1/4 frame of the movie.

Watchable "
,Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny,2011-06-17T02:15Z,"yea im saying the ftrame rate is the only issue here
the video is clear, audio very clear...but i never was a fan of stop  motion animation, im even  less a fan off stop motion live action :) Have to add that this is the veryfirst negative thing ive ever had to say about a Froggie upload though, so i guess ill say thanks, cuz i know it aint easy 
, and add plz...next time give us a better framerate boss :)...all in all goood enough for free...but ill watch the whole movie when a better rip comes along, but plz never stop uploading froggie i like good movies ;)"
,groovygriffo,2011-06-19T03:34Z,What happened to the ending of the movie?? If that was the ending then I'm really pissed off. I believe that we are missing the end of this movie!!
,JaySean.,2011-06-20T21:28Z,where the fuck is the screen??
,free2flie,2011-06-20T23:32Z,"@ ice1505

Who let you out of your cage anyway? Go back into your cage you thankless piece of shit. Lets see you do better than froggie100"
,nchatra,2011-06-22T17:51Z,"This Movie has Low Frame Rate.. Don't believe what other are Quoting, 
I Downloaded It and cant watch..  Frame it is really Low.. 
This Torrent Sucks...!!!!!"
,Lion_X,2011-06-22T20:20Z,"ItÂ´s a shame HOW CAN ANYONE UPLOAD SOMETHING SO SHITLESS
!!!!!!!!!!NO QUALITY AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!
WAIST OF TIME"
,PI0XMATE,2011-06-23T12:40Z,Thanks for the effort Froggie. I expect more of you though - movie was like watching a slide show! :) Thanks anyway. Keep up the GOOD work :D
,nukeez,2011-06-24T16:03Z,"thanks for this
A:8
V:8

for a cam for sure :P"
,CanOfPringles,2011-06-25T15:39Z,"BAG-O-SHITE rip, couldn't watch past 2 minutes of it.

Mono audio, bottom of the picture cut off, fucking atrocious framerate (almost half of them are missing)."
,numse,2011-06-26T02:42Z,omg this rip sucks!
,nevise,2011-06-26T14:38Z,Playing it in Windows Media Center will look a bit better regarding the fps but just a bit theres still little stuttering left.
,nevise,2011-06-26T14:39Z,Try GOMPlayer.
,CanOfPringles,2011-06-27T04:34Z,"I downloaded the source avi that this release used, then ran it through AviSynth with the decomb plugin and simply used one single filter: decimate()
This restored the choppy 29.97fps video to a smooth 23.976fps, played back great and the Korean subs didn't distract from the film at all."
,f.kruger,2011-06-29T18:27Z,"thanks for the up, 1/5th of fram missing to remove subs, but it is a plot driven movie so not much missing apart from chins!!"
,fabioxxxx,2011-06-29T21:22Z,"FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU.

BLUE RAY RIP MY ASS.

Fuc#*#nG Ass$&(R@#&@*LE... got 800mb dvd rip with  better quality than this...

plus it lags to much couldn't watch ...

,justaddh2ohere,2011-07-01T21:56Z,most definitely not a BR rip.  watchable if you don't mind looking at people's faces with their mouths cut off most of the time

,gerryscat,2011-07-12T07:12Z,"BRRip? You mean fucking TS, it looks like shit"
,In_Da_Club,2011-07-13T01:39Z,"It's is BRRIP, you should check your eyes noobs... problem is the framerate is pretty bad, didnt frapsed it but i doubt its above 10-15 fps"
,EndeW,2011-07-16T12:35Z,"SHIT quality this is NOT BRIP THIS IS NOT BRIP !
Worst movie ever, btw!"
,thedeadserv,2011-08-01T00:58Z,"This is ridiculous. This is a SLICED at the bottom reencode of a korean video. Probably a PPV or a TS.

You sir are RIDICULOUS!

What's more ridiculous is the people who believe this is a BRRip after watching the video.
I won't even discuss the framerate but the PIXELS that look like a video on this torrent are a joke and what's more, they're INSULTING."
