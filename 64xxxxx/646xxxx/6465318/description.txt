59 7 "Sword of the Atom!" Ben Jones Steven Melching June 11, 2011 (iTunes) 307
 
Teaser: 
Aquaman does a musical number in a spoof of a '50s sitcom called "The Currys Of Atlantis". 
This teaser features Aquaman's entire family, including his wife and Aqualad as well as Black Manta. 
In the sitcom, Aquaman forgets about his wife's anniversary on the day he's supposed to fight crime with Batman.

 Main Plot:
 After the old Atom (Ray Palmer) retires, his arch-nemesis Chronos plans an attack and Batman goes looking for him. 
When Batman disappears, Aquaman & The Atom (Ryan Choi) must shrink to a microscopic size in the Amazon Jungle to save 
the Caped Crusader and Ray Palmer from tiny aliens.

 NOTE: And finally, Ben Jones switched the episode's teaser with episode 57, because they were running too long.  
 
Spoken Language:- English

[b]Note:[/b] I'm using the US season and episode numbers to keep in line with the {C_P} releases 
which include 2 more episodes at the start of season 3 which are listed as part of season 2 on itunes & elsewhere
