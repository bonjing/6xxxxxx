,glucas11,2011-11-10T20:28Z,"I have tried to use PowerISO to mount, and received the ""insert CD"" message.

I have also used daemon tools to mount and extracted the files, but each one of these gets through the installation failing to install AutoCAD Civil 3D 2012 and the Storm/Sanitary Analysis.

Any help?"

Thanks!"
