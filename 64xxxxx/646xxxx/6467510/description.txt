All Things Bright and Beautiful is the third studio album by Owl City. It was originally planned to have a worldwide release date of May 24. 2011. It was then changed to May 17th. On the 6th of April however, Young posted on his official site that the release date had been bumped to June 14, 2011. He stated that the reason for this was, "In an attempt to better connect the dots and ensure that every cloud in the sky is stitched together with its own special silver lining," and "with school finally out for the summer, it'll be a perfect time to sit back and watch the fireworks." On May 20, almost all of the album was leaked onto the internet, "How I Became The Sea" and "Shy Violet" were not among the leaked tracks.

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
