Enjoy"
,redtar,2011-06-14T03:59Z,Is it possible to rip it from the disc as 320kbps CBR?  I would prefer that and I assume most people would.
[V],bubanee,2011-06-14T09:44Z,No not me.. sure there's a 320 somewhere around here.. if not look for a flac and then rip the flac to 320cbr... perfect rip!
,idontcare007,2011-06-14T15:20Z,Is there really a noticeable difference between the 250kbps and 320kbps ?
,MFiresix,2011-06-14T15:30Z,"THNX Man, great job, I've been waiting for this for a tine now...great work indeed!!!"
[V],bubanee,2011-06-15T02:13Z,"@idiotcare.. Nope... 320 is considered CBR the 250 your talking about is Avg, VBR.. what vbr is to cut a long story short is a MP3 which removes all the wasted bits that are not needed and VBR V0 or even V2 is the chosen format by Lame and all serious CD Rippers... besides that most 320cbr in torrents is made by people ripping a V2/0 VBr scene release to 320cbr Transcode.. there is so much fake 320 in torrents..  "
