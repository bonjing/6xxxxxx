,straightflushin,2011-06-14T19:05Z,"Danish, Indonesian, Pashto, Swahili, Thai, probably your copy of Vietnamese, and Welsh are all v2 languages. "
,nipsicle,2011-06-15T07:16Z,hmm... that blows..... I'm pausing the torrent while i check all the languages...
,nipsicle,2011-06-15T09:01Z,"thanks straightflushin - you're right, somehow i managed to get some version 2 language files in there... probably because i just didn't care. and when i look around it seems many other uploaders are making the same mistake.

update 1: version 2 shit (sorry) - danish 1, greek 1 & 2, indonesian 1, pashto 1, thai 1, turkish 1, vietnamese 1, welsh 1, swahili 1

update 2: adding version 3 - greek 1 & 2, turkish 1. possibly more - look for updated torrent in a few hours. in the mean time i'll keep uploading the version 3 language files of this torrent"
,d_a_u_t,2011-06-15T16:27Z,"Can someone help me please? I've downloaded the torrent, but it's ISO, and I don't know how to run the application."
,nipsicle,2011-06-15T17:51Z,i've only included the language files. when you download the app odds are it will come with instructions.
,straightflushin,2011-06-15T19:07Z,"You might also want to check your Latin level 1, since you already had that uploaded before VasiaZozulia came out with the first v3 Latin levels available."
,blaze_08,2011-06-15T21:12Z,someone seeeeed pplzzzz !!!!!
,nipsicle,2011-06-16T02:50Z,"all checked - latin 1 is ok. I've looked at every ISO and verified that they are now all Version 3

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6472474

there are a number of torrents claiming to have version 3 of various languages and it's just not true. for the languages that I've removed there is just no V3 copy floating around in torrent land.

anyway, sorry for the mixup - I learned me a good lesson :)

@blaze_08 - dude, I am seeding. at about 2-300kB through my cell phone - i think that's pretty good. but as wimax service improves in my area I'll be sure to seed faster! however, if youread the previous comments you would know that I am no longer seeding the V2 language files. if you want them they are searchable.... "
,nipsicle,2011-06-16T02:53Z,"oh wait, sorry - i didn't say that here. now I am. I'm no longer seeding the V2 language files. "
,Makuso11,2011-06-17T13:21Z,"Thx for uploading, really great:) - but this torrent shows error

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6472474

btw, i started downloading on the 15.6.2011, were there already all v3 versions? 
or shall i restart downloading from the beginning?"

,Makuso11,2011-06-18T11:31Z,"I think you should be thankful for that uploading and not asking for more in an affirmative way, and also, when downloading the torrent, you you can choose which languages you want to download, you dont need to download 33 GB, although I did - you never know when you want to use some language, and your family may profit from it as well.."
,chronocrux,2011-06-18T18:58Z,I know this says Mac but will it run on the pc? Thanks :)
,d_a_u_t,2011-06-18T21:52Z,"I'm sorry, I forgot my manners. Please? I have been able to select files, but for some reason, French 2 will not finish the download. I am still very new to all of this, and would appreciate the help. If a comment was directed towards me, I sorry if I came off ungrateful."
,phantomphoenix,2011-06-19T04:05Z,so many incomplete files.. please reseed!!

,wampus64,2011-06-20T07:49Z,Don't bother with wasting bandwidth. This torrent was good for one day ONLY. I hate posters who only post for one day and nobody can possibly 33.12 GB in24 hours. May a repost of the original upload will show up #2&%$....
,Nadaddy94,2011-06-26T00:43Z,"SEED! I've been seeding for a day or two, and I'm also stuck at 83%. Come on people, I want to know swedish!"

,msinclair90,2011-08-12T09:42Z,"Stuck with 5% left too. So far everything is working great. I really want to learn Russian and French. Russian only has 1-3 which is fine it's a great start! But, because I'm stuck with that last 5% missing and no one is seeding I have French 1,3,4,5 but 2 isn't complete. But, like I said, everything else is great so far. Thanks!"

first of all .. thanks so much for a great torrent.
and thanks for the clear instructions on how to get it to work :)
however i have a problem and i need some help ...
the french stops at 99% or to be more exact at level 2 it stops at 99.3 % any advice on that guys?
and the polish wont work ! when ever i try to instal it i get a message that it needs a higher version and i know i cant upgrade it because it'll mess with the crack.
so your help is highly appreciated ..
other than that all the other ones are running nicely ..
thanks again :)"

,81ackr0se,2011-12-12T03:11Z,I checked only the box for italian but I think it downloaded all the languages.  I'm okay with that but was just really confused.  Since this is only the language packs is there a specific link I'd need to goto to download Rosetta Stone for them?
,godfatherdnr,2011-12-17T14:31Z,"Stuck at 97.7 %. If anyone could seed, I'd appreciate it. But what really is in the last 2.3 percent? Is there some way to find out? I don't really need every language. 

It's just that this was the only Mac torrent when I did the search. "
,valnal,2012-01-09T20:04Z,please seed.  
,johnlolsmith,2012-01-18T20:33Z,"1. Please seed. I, like the rest of the world it seems, am capped at 97%.

2. To nipsicle: where is the actual Rosetta Stone software? I see all the disk images, but there is no executable to run the .rsd files and such contained within. Am I missing something here?"

I am fairly new to this so please forgive my ignorance in these matters, but I have download these languages and I am using the French one but Level 3 upwards is locked and asking for an activation code, where can I find this if indeed I can?

Again I am new so sorry if this is an obvious question

Thanks"
,inwhysea,2012-04-16T16:32Z,Anyone know how to get this shit to work?
,estarr,2012-04-18T02:49Z,Can somebody please tell me how to get this to work.  I have a rosetta stone application that wants me to add  language disks but no one told me how to work it.  I see some of you figured out this torrent so could you please tell me how to work it so I can start learning some languages please.  Thanks.
,osustudent,2012-04-18T21:23Z,"Can anyone get Thai to work. I burned the ISO to a cd but when I try to load it it doesnt run like a loadable cd, it runs like just a data disc and rosetta stone doesnt recognize it. Any thoughts?"
,chasonspencer,2012-05-17T16:03Z,I am stuck with 5% left too. Can someone see please?! its been like this for three days now
,AirWorthyFunky,2012-06-05T02:44Z,why is my download opens as a document not as the dmg?
,thekashman,2012-06-12T05:16Z,I've got a problem getting Thai to work as well. Rosetta Stone won't detect it even after I mount the language. Is it still a V2 / V3 problem? Has anyone else gotten it to work?
