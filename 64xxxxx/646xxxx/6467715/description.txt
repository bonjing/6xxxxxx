i get my high speed internet through my cell phone - that pretty much means I'll mostly be uploading during my night time.

i've mostly only tested french, japanese and english because that's all i care about but the other should work.

at some point i'll try to get the missing languages/levels but that point is not now... soon :)

THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS ROSETTA STONE TORRENT I UPLOADED EXCEPT WITH ADDED LEVELS (LATIN 2 & 3). IF YOU WERE DOWNLOADING MY PREVIOUS TORRENT SIMPLY REMOVE IT FROM THE QUE AND ADD THIS ONE AND IT SHOULD PICK UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF. (POSSIBLY AFTER FORCE RECHECK)
