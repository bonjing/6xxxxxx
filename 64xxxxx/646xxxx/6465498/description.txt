Quote:
From the creator of 52 and Annihilation, Keith Giffen! An alien microbe, traveling through space, arrives on Earth and discovers humanity. As it enters an array of innocent human bodies, it remakes them into something new. Something powerful. Something wanting its own homeland, its own dominion. A new mini-series depicting the battle between ordinary humans and this new, alien invader taking over human bodies and infusing them with untold power!
