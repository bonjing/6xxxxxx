     SUMMARY:
              Engineering in space represents the future of human
              civilization, but also poses some of our greatest
              technical difficulties. We'l travel to NASA's tool lab
              and see the equipment we need to build in this
              challenging environment, from high tech wrenches and
              hammers to the ultimate robotic handyman, Robonaut.
     NOTES:
              Hybrid. We elected to do this at 30fps to minimize
              jerkiness and not to blend the film parts.
