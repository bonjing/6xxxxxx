Young Swedish genius Simon Olofsson created two short films entitled Words 1 & 2 that are currently rare and hard to come by. The author does not even have copies of these films himself currently. A stunning display of words on the screen, these experimental films are casually made yet exhibit such strong talent that one would be remiss to ignore these shining gems.

Olofsson purposely makes it so that you cannot read each word. Yet do not be discouraged: enjoy these shorts time and time again and treasure them forever.
