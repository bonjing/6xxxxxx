Van Canto is an a cappella metal band from Germany, founded in 2006. It is composed 
of five singers and a drummer.Van Canto fuses a cappella (non-instrumental vocal music) with power metal, creating what they call \"a capella metal\". While only two of the five singers perform the lead vocals, the other three will instead use their voices to imitate the guitars and the bass, with the help of amplifiers, in attempt to sound closer to the original instruments.
