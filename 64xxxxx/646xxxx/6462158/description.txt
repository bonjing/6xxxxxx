Product Description: 
The Second IUPAC Symposium on the Characterization of Porous Solids (COPS-II) provided the opportunity for detailed discussion and appraisal of the most important techniques currently used for the characterization of porous materials, especially those of technological importance. The 82 selected papers and reviews contained in this volume are mainly concerned with the theoretical and experimental aspects of adsorption, fluid penetration, small-angle scattering and spectroscopic methods with their application in the study of adsorbents, catalysts, constructional materials, etc. Particular attention is given to the characterization of carbons, oxides, zeolites, clays, cement and polymers. The wide range of materials and techniques described in this book provide a useful and comprehensive reference source for academic and industrial scientists and technologists.
