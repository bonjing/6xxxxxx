BOOK INFO:

This is the first of two volumes representing the ourrent state of knowledge
about Enriques surfaoes whioh oooupy one of the olasses in the olassifioation of
algebraic surfaces. Reoent improvements in our understanding of algebraio surfaoes
over fields of positive oharaoteristio allowed us to approaoh the subject from a
completely geometrio point of view although heavily relying on algebraio methods.
Some of the techniques presented in this book oan be applied to the study of
algebraic surfaces of other types. We hope that it will make this book of partioular
interest to a wider range of research mathematioians and graduate students.
