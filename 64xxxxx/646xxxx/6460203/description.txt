Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: well, at least the webcast went through at the right time, but the quality is still very bad.  By bad I mean the actual sound quality as well as the sounds the web engineer plays come through way too low.  I left some of the stuff in that I would normally edit out just so yall can hear what I'm talking about.  I wonder if this has anything changes related to GBTV.  Regardless, I hope they fix it by Monday!
