streets and alleys of the tiny European town. Your journey follows the path
of clues left behind by your missing girlfriend, where along  the  way  you
will have to solve an ancient mystery and the source of  evil  causing  the
local  townsfolk  to  turn  into  a  rare  breed  of  savage  night-thirsty
