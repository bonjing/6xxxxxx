[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-15T13:20Z,i thought maybe you would want to remove the old torrent so that new traffic is diverted to the new torrent? :)

,recorps1,2011-06-26T16:00Z,"Great quality, much easier downloading the whole series. Quality is superb, dont expect bluray quality but way better than SD tv. sound is great to, especially on 5.1 except episode 3 which is DD 2.0 for some reason. is this a bad recording or just how it was aired?"
