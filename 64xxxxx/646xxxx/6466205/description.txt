The grandfathers want the relationship to come up from their grand children. Raja Rao staying in abroad send urgent message on his ill health. So CR Simha, Radha and her family members rush. On a foreign locale Radha meets Krish a dancer. Krish is bowled over Radha beauty but it is Radha who has developed a different habit. She wants to marry a rowdy who is rough and tough. Radha also a dancer is tutor to Kuttappa (Dilipraj) a rowdy and she wants him to propose. When Krish comes to India he lives in the house of Radha. Radha is firm in her decision but the enormous love extended by Krish she pity him. On the other hand Kuttappa a rowdy proposes his love to another teacher in the dance school.
