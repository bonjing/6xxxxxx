Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements XV contains contains most of the papers presented at the 15th International Conference on Computational Methods and Experimental Measurements. The biennial conference, which began in 1984, offers the scientific and technical community an international forum for analyzing the interaction between computational methods and experimental measurements and all associatedmethods and experimental techniques are becoming more and more interdependent. The continuous development of numerical procedures and of computer efficiency, coupled with their decreasing costs, has generated an ever-increasing growth of computational methods that are exploited in a persistently expanding variety of scientific and technological endeavors, as well as in daily life. As these procedures continue to grow in size and complexity, it is essential to ensure their reliability. This can only be achieved by performing dedicated and accurate experiments. At the same time, current experimental techniques have become more complex and elaborate and require the use of computers for running tests and processing the resulting data.The papers in the book consider ways in which computational methods and experimental techniques compliment each other, as well as application areas where their interplay is particularly important.
