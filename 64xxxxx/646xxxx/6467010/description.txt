                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Jon and Julia Shorrock host the week's first round of the B&B competition from
 their four-star Derwent House in West Sussex. The guests are split by gender to
 sample the area, with the men firing machine guns at a shooting range and the
 women relaxing at a spa - but a carpeted bathroom and shower without hot water
 raise questions.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
