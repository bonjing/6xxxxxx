,LukeScooto,2011-06-29T01:30Z,"Downloading now, will comment on quality right after. "
,LukeScooto,2011-06-29T03:06Z,"Good quality and rip, although the file size is way larger then it needs to be, even for a BluRay. I have 500+ rips on my 1TB external HD, and none of them are this big, except for my earlier ones when I was still learning what programs and formats to use. Im not a pro, and im still learning, but smaller file sizes would be greatly appreciated, especially for a 810."
,LukeScooto,2011-06-29T08:12Z,"Well it appears I was wrong about the audio anyways, its severly out of sync, and the video is playing at a faster speed at times, which appears to be causing the sync issue. I dont think the problem is on my end, as all my other videos play fine, but it could be. Anyone else having this issue? Doesnt start till around 10 minutes in."
