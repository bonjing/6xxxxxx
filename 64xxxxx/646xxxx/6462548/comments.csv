,shuhadap,2011-11-23T08:50Z,"Fellow seeders and leechers, I have been waiting roughly 3 weeks now for this. up until 81% I was downloading at a staggering speed of 2000 kb/s, and now its stuck, and been stuck on average at 0.5 kb/s. Come on people, I have seeded more than I have actually downloaded, roughly 200 GB by now, and I am happy to keep sharing, but everyone who has downloaded this needs to get their asses on helping with the seeding!!! Get your asses on your torrents, and just give us a little support, I am giving all I can!!"
,shuhadap,2011-11-24T10:32Z,"In addition to what I wrote, if someone, the host or anyone else just helps me finish downloading my part, I will seed the full file for as long everyone needs it.

I am available all day to keep my laptop online and seed for everyone, so please I need everyones group effort, to help out the community.

This is just to kickass of a series to let the torrent die!!"

,shuhadap,2011-11-28T08:52Z,"I am missing from 301-450, all other episodes I am seeding, and once someone is able to seed this section to me, I will seed it all year long if need be, and more!! Give us support, do not let this torrent die!"
,riversoblivion,2011-12-27T23:25Z,"Is anyone still seeding this?

,Quemerita,2012-02-13T23:14Z,"Hi, Im new to PirateBay, so I dont understand much, but how do I seed?"
,shuhadap,2012-02-17T18:27Z,"Ok, so now I have been stuck on this torrent since November 2011, almost 4 months now, and I have been stuck on 83% for more than 2 months. I have seeded almost 1 terabyte of this torrent, but I have yet to finish it. Please guys, make the effort, I promise i will leave my computer on Day and Night once I finish it. You should expect my dedication, considering that I have been trying to download this for almost 4 months now. I just need everyones cooperation, once a few of us finish, and let our torrents seed, we will be able to bring this properly back to life. Please everyone who loves this show, or anyone who is interested in this download, show some support, help us keep this torrent moving!! :D"
,shuhadap,2012-02-17T18:33Z,"@Quemerita, seeding should come automatically once you start downloading a torrent, with your torrent software, unless the software already disabled sharing your upload speed.

Otherwise usually with all software, by default you will be seeding to everyone else.

In order to keep seeding once you finish your download, you just keep your downloaded file on the software, without deleting it.

Hope that helps somewhat hahah."
,TomX88,2012-03-06T11:47Z,Cmon guys please seed. Stucked at 87.8% for a week
