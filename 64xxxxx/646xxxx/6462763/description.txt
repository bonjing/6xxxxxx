The complete works featuring Scrooge McDuck and other famous Disney Characters from cartoonist Don Rosa. Every published comic from debut to retirement is here, and all in high resolution. *.cbz-format files.

I downloaded these from this excellent site: http://disneycomics.free.fr/index_rosa_date.php

All I did was sort and pack the jpegs properly in *cbz-archives.

Make sure to check it out for other Disney cartoonists as well, or if you only wish to download one or a few of the albums in this torrent.
