                   ================================== 
The First Great Train Robbery â€” known in the U.S. as The Great Train Robbery â€” is a 1979 film directed by Michael Crichton, who also wrote the screenplay based on his novel The Great Train Robbery. The film starred Sean Connery, Donald Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down.

Origins of the plot
===================
The story is loosely based on the Great Gold Robbery of 1855, in which a cracksman called William Pierce (named Edward Pierce in Crichton's book and film) engineered the theft of a train-load of gold being shipped to the British Army during the Crimean War; Â£12,000[citation needed] (equal to Â£809,417 today which in turn is USD$1,281,550 and 930,143 Euros) in gold coin and ingots from the London to Folkestone passenger train was stolen by Pierce and his accomplices, a clerk in the railway offices called Tester, and a skilled screwsman called Agar. The robbery was a year in the planning and involved making sets of duplicate keys from wax impressions for the locks on the safes and bribing the train's guard, a man called Burgess. The plot was inspired by Kellow Chesney's 1970 book 'The Victorian Underworld' , which is a comprehensive examination into the more sordid aspects of Victorian society.

Similarly, in his screenplay Crichton used another real-life character from Chesney's book, that of a housebreaker called Williams (or Whitehead) who, sentenced to death in Newgate Prison, managed to escape by climbing the 15 meter (50 ft) tall sheer granite walls, squeezed through the revolving iron spikes at the top and climbed over the inward projecting sharp spikes above them before making his escape over the roofs. Crichton based his character 'Clean Willy' Williams, played by dancer Wayne Sleep, on Williams. The only fictional person in the movie is the woman Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down), who is romantically involved with Pierce and who, along with Agar, is Pierce's "eyes and ears" looking out for any weaknesses that can be exploited in committing the title crime.

Music
=====
The film's lavish, energetic soundtrack was written by Oscar winning composer Jerry Goldsmith. The score marked his third collaboration with writer/director Michael Crichton following Pursuit (1972) and Coma (1978). The music for two pianos, played by the characters Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd) and Emily Trent (Pamela Salem) is from the third movement of Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D major, K. 448 Molto Allegro.
