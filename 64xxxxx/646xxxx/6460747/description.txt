This album is great! The first of three studio albums from Happy End. Many people may think that Happy End is a Western-style rock band from Japan, yes, they are a rock band, but very Japanese. The lyrics by Matsumoto Takashi are great, and if you like "Kaze Machi Roman", this album is a must! They go together perfectly...different but still consistent. The opening song "Haru yo Koi" just rocks..reminds me of Hot Tuna's "Phosphorescent Rat" just a tad bit. This album is more free and psychedelic. If you like Jefferson Airplane, early RC Succession, Nick Drake, or late 60's rock, folk rock, you will love this album! Highly recommended and if the bonus tracks are on here, the alternate take of "Juunigatsu no Ame no Hi" is awesome.
