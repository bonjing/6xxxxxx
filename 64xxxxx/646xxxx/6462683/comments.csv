According to the MediaInfo report you posted in the description, the movie frame resolution is 1280 x 544. That's a 720p resolution, just so you know.  

IMDB link:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1552221/

Nice one though. :) "

[T],ETC1337,2011-06-12T00:51Z,"you are correct room101bellboy

The name of the file threw me...they labeled it 1080p. sorry for the confusion/disappointment

nevertheless this is the highest quality you will ever be able to get...unless they remaster it

Enjoy guys "
