Hi,

One of 50 nice sounding (Bar Prove) MP3 files mostly VBR, 100% clean and fully labelled. Compiled during various moods. Including a nice web based picture I use as a folder.

The last two releases are more personal. One is a kind Top 11 (plus modern interpretation), plus 4 pairs (2x(11+4)) of related songs which should be in there too. Which I regard as the &quotbest&quot songs in their place-and-time frame. A matter of power I guess.

And 23 is the last piece of a puzzle (5x10). It consists of very (personal) specials that are nice to share (especially the words). Let&quots say &quotI followed my hart&quot (Dutch M&quotn Hart Gevolgd).

Finally, if you like some of it, download &quotPlay in Reverse&quot from &quotDutch Treat&quot or the smaller Indie collections like &quotLight&quot, &quotAfter The Storm&quot and &quotI Count Shapes&quot. These collections give a nice view of the soft side from Indie Pop and Rock. Some flowers opened up for me. That felt good. Especially for papa&quots who experienced the newness of music the first time and recognizes this a second time

If you are a freeloader, please make an exception this time. My machine is not that fast and people simply hate waiting. We can prevent that to happen. Thanks for the help.

Enjoy and consider buying for true sound quality and support.
