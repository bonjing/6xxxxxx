
Hey all, I have just started this new Music Blog at [url]http://Did.YouHearTheNew.com[/url].  I did not start this site for any other reason besides to put up new music for my friends to listen to, since I always keep going \\\"Hey, did you hear the new blah blah...\\\" So, this site and now this mix-tape is one other way I have to put some music out.  Hopefully others can enjoy it as well. 

Another great playlist of songs to accompany you throughout June and the rest of the summer.

Enjoy!
