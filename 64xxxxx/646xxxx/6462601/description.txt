     DEFACED's dvdrip is the rated version. Unrated has more         
     bloody scenes that were rightly censored from the theatrical    
     so the naive hearts of american kids won't be tainted forever.  
                                                                     
     DEFACED also seems slightly overcropped but we don't have the   
     dvd to compare.
