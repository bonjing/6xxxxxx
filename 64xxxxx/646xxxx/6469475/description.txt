 Outspoken and overly critical Nishant Agarwal    
 meets gorgeous new co-worker, Charu, offers his  
 help, assists her financially, and they become   
 close friends. His room-mates, Rajat and Vikrant,
 are pleased with this outcome as they already    
 have girlfriends in Neha and Rhea respectively.  
 But both the relationships are not as harmonious,
 as Rajat feels Neha is self-centered and demandin
 while Rhea appears to be withdrawn and aloof.    
 Missing their meetings and bar-hopping, the trio 
 decide to take a time-out and be by themselves.
