THIS IS THE TRUE DEFINITIVE LOSSLESS VERSION RIPPED DIRECTLY FROM THE CD.

IT IS NOT RESAMPLED TO 48KHZ LIKE THE OTHER RELEASES FLOATING AROUND BUT IS PURE REDBOOK 44.1KHZ AND THUS IS A DIRECT REFERENCE TO THE CD.

For all you audiophiles or any uploader (*cough* NoFS *cough*) please don't upscale CD audio to 48khz as it degrades the quality and is a waste of space/CPU time: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=78191
