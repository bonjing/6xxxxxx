[V],globeplus,2011-06-13T11:00Z,"To xplor3r : i am a kind of fascinated for the work of this guys and many geniality and creativity can be found on this levels , thank god that it is many TR fans and general gamers that already played many of this levels but getting them with fantatsic compression it is more tough , who have limitations somehow on the internet can really appreciate close 120 mb less to download in only 170 mb  with everything completly perfect , this is an art independtly of the size of the files we are talking about , i already have and know some of the mentionated levels and maybe i play a few of them , the pack  suggestion is positive too and who knows , my positive contribution is the compression work and i will keep analising possibilities ... thank you for your comment ."
[V],globeplus,2011-06-13T14:50Z,"Hi , i am surprised for the positive to the possible users addiction to this spontaneous creative file about a specific type of file about the Tomb Raider first games series and i hope the file keep like this of course , i am now continuing my deep research in several things abot this fan-made tr files to get new creative ideas or more pratical tools to help the general work for the files , go playing this levels file and later today (never before) i will see if a new one it is possible to upload .

Thank you to the users for the receptivity and with that inspiring more positive work for this type of files . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-06-13T15:16Z,"Next time i keep my mouth shout showing appreciation for anything because in this last 30 minutes the seeds dropped with more users getting the file , i still can change my mind about new files  !!! just joking but i hope not because i speaked a positive comment that the users start to contratriate me ... Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-06-13T16:26Z,"WARNING and a friendly advice :

SAVE OFTEN AND IN MORE THAN 1 SLOT , WHY ?

because in my research in a few areas i find out that possible circunstancial bugs can happen in some type of doors or objects maybe for example then imagine the next cenario with me : you have 1 save at a circunstancial bugged door or part of the cenario by the engine and a few hours already played maybe , then you want be able to continue from that bugged position with Lara with a bug problem but with more than 1 slot a kind of close it will be just play a little bit more before on the current level if that happen  and you get throw it over the circunstancial bug , see ? now save often and in more than 1 slot .

See all of you and i am thinking in a new file soon , thank you and follow my advice ."
