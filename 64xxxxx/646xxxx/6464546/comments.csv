,ZaheBro,2011-06-16T19:50Z,"Hi there. I got a problem with this. Here's the story:
I downloaded it. Used WINrar to extract the file. Opened the ""Read THIS TO INSTALL!!!"" text file. Followed the instructions. Launch the game. Make my user name ""ZaheBro"" (I didn't register it). And tried both checked and unchecked ""Force Update"". It loads quite fast (Doesn't even load without ""Force Update"") and it goes point blank. Through ""Windows Task Manager"" it says ""Not Responding"". Can anybody help? :D"
