    One mistake will change many lives. SOVIA, a nurse, makes a fatal        
    mistake in the emergency room, killing a patient. Later that night,      
    Sovia has a surreal, near death experience in which the deceased         
    patient appears and touches her shoulder. When Sovia recovers, she       
    finds a bruise has developed at the exact place she was touched by       
    the deceased. Unknowingly, she passes the bruise to others - who are     
    then killed at the hands of the deceased. Sovia becomes the prime        
    suspect in the murders and she begins to discover the truth. Since       
    nobody believes her, it is up to Sovia to try to save herself and the    
    others.
