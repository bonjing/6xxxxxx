These Vinyl rips were recorded on a Denon DP-45F turntable using an Audio Technica AT120E cartridge. The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).
Recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.
iZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.

This is A Lot of work folks!

This gig was the first time Charlie Rouse played with Monk, he continued for eleven years!



The Thelonious Monk Orchestra at Town Hall is an album by Thelonious Monk, originally released in 1959. The concert included Hall Overtonâ€™s arrangements on Monkâ€™s tunes (including a transcription of Monk's piano solo on "Little Rootie Tootie"). The other musicians performing were trumpeter Donald Byrd, trombonist Eddie Bert, Robert Northern on French horn, Jay McAllister on tuba, altoist Phil Woods, tenor Charlie Rouse (in his first of several recordings with Monk) and baritonist Pepper Adams, as well as Sam Jones (bass) and drummer Art Taylor in the rhythm section.
