plot

Congressman David Norris runs for the United States Senate. In 2006 he loses his lead and, while rehearsing his concession speech in a hotel bathroom, meets a woman hiding in a stall. She encourages him to be more honest. Attracted to each other, they kiss before David leaves to make the speech. Inspired, David goes off script and makes an honest speech that makes him a favorite for the 2010 Senate race.
