BOOK INFO:

In Digital Alchemy, acclaimed printmaker Bonny Pierce Lhotka shows how to turn your standard inkjet printer into a seemingly magical instrument capable of transforming your printed images into true works of art. Using plenty of visuals and straightforward terms, Lhotka walks you step-by-step through over a dozen projects. Forget printing on boring old paper, in Digital Alchemy, youâ€™ll learn how to transfer and print images to a variety of surfaces including metal, wood, fabric, stone, and plastic using the techniques Lhotkaâ€™s spent years developing.

If youâ€™re a photographer looking for new ways to personalize your work or a digital artist whoâ€™s ready to take your work to the next level, youâ€™ll find all of the tools, techniques, and inspiration you need in this book. Lhotkaâ€™s enthusiasm for experimenting with unusual printing materials and processes has led her to create new and amazing transfer techniques, including one that resembles a Polaroidâ„¢ transfer on steroids. She also shows you how to make prints using unexpected, everyday materials such as hand sanitizer and gelatin. Youâ€™ll even learn direct printing, the technique for sending your custom substrate through your printer almost as if it were paper.
