This Primal Scream self titled album, following 2 years after the debut Sonic Flower Groove, is nothing less than straight-forward rock & roll, with a pronounced MC5/Detroit influence: rock-ballad-rock-ballad throughout the album. And it works perfectly. It didn't escape my attention that the producer is listed as Sister Anne - a blatant tribute to the Five - and that the song Gimme Gimme Teenage Head is essentially a rewrite of Kick Out the Jams. I don't think there is anything else in the Primal Scream discography that sounds like this, but it is definitely worth seeking out on it's own merits.
