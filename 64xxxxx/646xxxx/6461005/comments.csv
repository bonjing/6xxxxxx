[T],trialNerror,2011-06-15T01:58Z,"I really don't think this is S05E03 as there doesn't appear to be any new episodes for a long time.  Why would they stop a season only 3 eps into it?

My belief is this is the end of season 3; S03E29.  I know, I know... Wikipedia, TVrage, TV.com, TheTVdb, and all your favourite ep guide sites say this is season 5, but there's one source of TV info that's been around way longer than all of those sites - before the internet even - TVGuide. 

TVGuide as well as the TV service provider both list this as being the 3rd season finale; S03E29.  This would make sense since TV shows usually have a DVD of the Season available months after it aired.  Well, Ghost Adventures only has Season 1 and 2 available on DVD with the 3rd coming in September.

This sucks because we have been mislabeling these episodes for over a year now and is way too late to fix it."
