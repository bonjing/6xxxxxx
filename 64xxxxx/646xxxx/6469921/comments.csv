HAH!"
,bundes88,2011-09-13T14:01Z,"After FlypSide's comment I considered to find some other torrent, but THIS ONE WORKS PERFECTLY WELL. This is true soundtrack from Madness Return's. 

Thank you for uploading. This is really good music :) and small size of files is only an extra advantage ;D"
,Sypoth,2012-04-04T00:41Z,"Great torrent! I think it includes a song not in the full OST, either that or they changed the name. If you want all the songs I uploaded the torrent, complete with several seeders (myself included) here. https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7156237/Alice__Madness_Returns_Soundtrack"
