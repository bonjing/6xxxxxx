NOTES:

thanks to "amiqe2" @ ru tracker for the "head first" rip

thanks to "beeks" @SLSK for the "my maudlin carrer" rip



kiss with a fist rolls off at 20 Khz,,,  so it's not really a LPCM file..

turn off the light rolls off at 21 Khz or something..


ANYWAY... THESE TRACKS ARE NOT OVER-COMPRESSED, I RATHER LISTEN TO A LOSSY NON-COMPRESSED TRACK THAN A LOSSLESS OVER-COMPRESSED TRACK
