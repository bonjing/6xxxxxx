,unimpersonated,2011-06-12T02:13Z,Sorry for my low upload speed. But in this country (Belarus) there is no choice. :) Be patient. It might take you some days to download all the files.
[V],joshua13,2011-06-12T02:46Z,excellent upload! Many issues are in it that I do not have. Thank you.
,loquorlicker,2011-06-12T08:24Z,NEVER apologize for being generous. We all have time. Thank you for all of this. 
,unimpersonated,2011-06-14T10:47Z,"It is going to take a lot of time to download all the files. Be ready to wait. My computer is usually offline when I am at work or sleep. It is online on workdays (07.00 pm-00.00 am, Minsk time zone). On days-off I am online from morning till night. Besides upload speed here in Belarus is very low (max 64 kbytes/sec ).

Just don't leave the torrent and finally it will be yours. :)"

Congrats and thanks!"
