,Kvass187,2011-06-13T06:38Z,You need a fix to play this game. I suggest you guys wait for it unless you want 3.79 loitering in your computer.
,noob66600,2011-06-18T00:24Z,same as most new games got the 3.60 lock 
,Kvass187,2011-06-19T02:55Z,"It appears the 1.01 update is signed with 3.60 keys

So the game is UNPLAYABLE (at least if a 3.60 CFW comes along, which is very unlikely).

Translation:

There won't be fix for this game (at least for a long, long, long, long ,long time)"
,xeusoi16,2011-06-24T22:55Z,iso file is broken dont download its fake
,Kvass187,2011-06-28T23:55Z,"NO, IT DOES NOT WORK.

EVEN IF THE ISO FILE IS OKAY THIS GAME IS A 3.60 version game,

ALL GAMES WILL BE 3.60 FROM NOW ON"
