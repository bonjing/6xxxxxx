Terraria - Mac - V1.04
=======INFO=======
This is a port.
Website: http://www.terraria.org/
IGN Review (given 9/10): http://pc.ign.com/objects/106/106846.html
TO PLAY:
Drag Terraria.app to applications folder, click to open + play.

=======KNOWN ISSUES======
This mac port is no better than the pc game! So, if someone on the PC experiences a crash, so will you on a mac! This is the SAME GAME, just for mac! With that said:
The game will crash every 5 minutes.
In order to prevent crashes, set skip frame rate to OFF in OPTIONS under the MAIN MENU.

Haven't tested multiplayer yet, but single player is awesome!
