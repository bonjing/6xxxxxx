,feartruth,2011-06-15T10:30Z,"Hi StyLishSaLH,

Thanks for sharing such great movies. Can you upload the DVDRip/BRRip/BDRip of the following (or any of the following) movies WITH English subs (soft subs preferred, but hard subs will also be fine if no soft subs are available)?

1] Biutiful - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164999/

2] A-i-deul... (aka Children...) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861982/

3] Insidious - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/

4] The Lincoln Lawyer

I'll be very grateful if you can do any of them, especially A-i-deul... (Sorry for repeating, but if it's possible for you to fulfill my request, please see to it that the Rip includes English subs.) Hope you can. Even if you can't, thanks and cheers."

This is a request.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/

Red Cliff (2008)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425637/

Red Cliff II (2009)
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1326972/

The first one is the most critically acclaimed Chinese movie.
Red Cliff is the most collected Chinese movie.
But nobody cared to do them properly.
Don't limit them to 480p.
Do them in 720p.
It's because they are ancient Chinese martial arts and war movies presenting to you a great FEAST.
Please do reply."
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-15T13:42Z,"@Venadan
I encoded Red Cliff Duology, but due to some sync problem in Red Cliff 2, I'm forced to skip them. Yes these are excellent pieces of Chinese cinema.

@feartruth
A-i-deul...
Not released in bluray yet.

You rock mate. Soon you'll become king of 480p and 720p movies. keep uploading great foreign flicks.
JAI HO."
,justregged,2011-09-12T17:13Z,For me the audio on this one was fucked. When on low volume it was too loud and distorted which became annoying and turned off after 25mins. My rating V-10 A-Sucks sorry.
,kratol,2011-09-18T07:47Z,"First, this has spanish audio, not french. Also, as justregged suggested, the audio is clipping, with lots of distortion, it's unbearable."
