Police & Thieves, the song, was a massive reggae hit in 1976, soundtracking both the political unrest in Jamaica, and that summerâ€™s Notting Hill riots â€“ hence a famous cover version by the Clash. The accompanying album is a solid-gold classic, with Murvins high-pitched laments swathed in a gloriously other-worldly production from Lee â€œScratchâ€ Perry.
