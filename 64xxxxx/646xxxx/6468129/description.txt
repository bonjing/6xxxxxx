The debut solo album from veteran songwriter and front-woman of The Ragbirds is a real departure from the percussive upbeat sound of her heavily touring band. These are private moments scooped up with two small hands and spread out in layers of strings, voices, piano and words. Zindle, who is known for her creative energy and endless smiles, has taken the listener into a smaller quieter world where pain slips through the cracks and the raw edges are left to show. The songs speak of strange experiences, loss, internal wrestling, forgiveness, family, nature and despair. With the exception of a guest bassoon and bagpiper all the instruments are performed by Erin herself. â€œScenes From The Fragile Agile Avian Worldâ€ is an 8-song journal of a feathered traveler. It is full of imagery and feminine musical textures that do not involve drums, bass and guitar. 

As Rumi said: â€œThe birdâ€™s favorite songs you do not hear, for their most flamboyant music takes place when their wings are stretched above the trees and they are smoking the opium of pure freedom.â€ 

â€œScenesâ€ offers a fleeting glimpse of that private moment in the sky.
