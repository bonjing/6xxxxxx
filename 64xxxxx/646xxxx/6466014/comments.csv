,Rurounin,2011-06-13T13:41Z,"Audio goes out of sync at 0:32:51, you'll notice a short speed up of the video and the audio will lag behind from there on.

It's watchable but the lag will bother you for a while till you get used to it, i would have waited for a proper had i known this."
,kuliglig,2011-06-13T14:00Z,where can i get subtitles pls?
,jeffro18,2011-06-13T14:01Z,"@powers987 - see Rurounin's comment, he has confirmed it - so not trolling at all. Not saying it's fake, just that a proper should be just around the corner.

Just trying save people some time and bandwidth. :)"
,Orion1986,2011-06-13T14:16Z,"@Rurounin

Yeah, I can back that up. It goes out of sync.

If you are using VLC, you can fix it by advancing audio over video by +0,400 seconds. 

Tools>Track Synchronisation

It pretty much makes it unbearable to watch without fixing it, at least for me.

Other than the unsynched audio, its good."
