    A soldier who deserted because of spiritual beliefs was tried and        
    evaluated by four psychiatrists, and they all concluded that he was      
    unable to distinguish right from wrong, so he was sentenced to a         
    mental hospital. One day, he escapes and kidnaps them and leaves them    
    all in the middle of the desert.
