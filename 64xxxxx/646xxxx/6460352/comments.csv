,NEL117,2011-06-11T00:19Z,SALAMAT! THANK YOU!
,cartman19987,2011-06-11T17:09Z,"@NEL117 - What does ""salamat"" mean? You say it in all your comments."
[V],mirrormaster82,2011-06-11T18:04Z,cartman19987 : I think salamat means - thanks or thank you - as he is writing after word salamat...very logical (when you think about it)...
,cranknozzle,2011-06-18T00:12Z,I love DEADPOOL Mirrormaster! Thanks so much for the tireless efforts to bring these great scans to us all! So sad my direct sub to Deadpool has been cancelled by Marvel. Hopefully it is not a sign of more permanent cancellations to come like Deadpool Corps and Deadpool Team-ups getting the axe. Thanks again bud!!!
,cranknozzle,2011-06-21T18:22Z,Mirrormaster you are the man! Thx sooo much!!
