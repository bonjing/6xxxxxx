Reinforced Concrete: Mechanics and Design 5th Edition by James K. Wight and James G. MacGregor
Product Description
Reinforced concrete design encompasses both the art and science of engineering. This book presents the theory of reinforced concrete as a direct application of the laws of statics and mechanics of materials. In addition, it emphasizes that a successful design not only satisfies design rules, but also is capable of being built in a timely fashion and for a reasonable cost. A multi-tiered approach makes Reinforced Concrete: Mechanics and Design an outstanding textbook for a variety of university courses on reinforced concrete design. Topics are normally introduced at a fundamental level, and then move to higher levels where prior educational experience and the development of engineering judgment will be required.
From the Publisher
Based on the latest (1995) edition of the authoritative American Concrete Institute Building Code, this text explains the theory and practice of reinforced concrete design in a systematic and clear fashion -- with an abundance of step-by-step worked examples, illustrations, and photographs. The focus is on preparing students to make the many judgment decisions required in reinforced concrete design, and reflects the author's extensive experience and expertise as both a teacher of reinforced concrete design and as a member of various code committees.
