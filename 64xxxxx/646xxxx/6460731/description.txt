If you find this album, buy it, whatever the cost. A band that has a southern drawled singer, so they gotta be from Texas, Louisiana or somewhere nearby. Blazing heavy guitars all over the place with wah-wah, backwards fazing and east/west stereo special effects. Everything you need for psychedelic guitar perfection.

Loose, rural psych/hard rock from 1972 with fluid guitar and masterful organ, produced by Artie Kornfield at A&R in New York. 8 powerful tracks with interplay that is similar to bands like (early) Lynyrd Skynyrd, Trapeze etc. Great songs like "Frolic Child" build from a gentle ballad into a beautiful guitar workout whilst "Trapped in the City" is a 6 minute bluesy workout with excellent phased Hammond work. Nice album.
