Thanks for your information and help. Dodger has been posting here at TPB for about 2-3 years and nothing has ever changed as far as quality screens goes. I cannot decide whether it is $$ or simple a ""hard head"", as in stubborn. 

,,,,,and a thanks to dodger for all that he has shared over the years."
