,junkbrol,2011-06-11T15:02Z,"at furryfacemanguy,

help yourself in an easy way, if you use firefox you can install an addon called epubreader, extremely easy, when installed just drag any epub.file to your firefox window and you can read it in a nice bookformat :-)"

 ""Nook for PC"" this is free and will read EPub
.
Thanks to uploader."
