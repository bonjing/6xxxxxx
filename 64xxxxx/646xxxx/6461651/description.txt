Mental Traps: The Overthinker's Guide to a Happier Life

Mental Traps is AndrÃ© Kuklaâ€™s immensely enjoyable and down-to-earth catalogue of the everyday blunders we make in our thinking habits, how these traps can affect our entire lives, and what we can do about it.
Ever find yourself putting off even relatively minor tasks because of the many other little jobs that youâ€™d have to tackle first? Or spending far too much time worrying about things you canâ€™t change? Or living for the future, not for today? Truth is, we all do â€” and we all recognize that sometimes our ways of thinking just arenâ€™t productive. When it comes to our daily lives, we often laugh off habits like procrastination as being human nature and just resolve to approach things differently next time. Or, when the issues facing us are enormous or traumatic, we might recognize that weâ€™re dwelling on our problems, or otherwise spending our time on fruitless thinking, but have no idea how to get out of that miserable rut. Either way, it takes up a lot of our mental energy.

But as AndrÃ© Kukla makes clear in Mental Traps, what we donâ€™t recognize â€” or at least admit to ourselves! â€” is how thinking unproductively about even the smallest elements of everyday life can mount up and keep us from being happy, from living life to the fullest. For what appear to be minor lapses are actually â€œhabitual modes of thinking that disturb our ease, waste enormous amounts of our time, and deplete our energy without accomplishing anything of value for us or anyone else.â€ So whether weâ€™re dealing with how to attain our major career goals or deciding when to serve the salad course at dinnertime, the end results can be much the same: readily identifiable patterns of wasteful thinking. These, in Kuklaâ€™s view, are the mental traps.
