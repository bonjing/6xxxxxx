The Heart of Mathematics An Invitation to Effective Thinking-viny


Math can be a living source of powerful ideas that transcend mathematics; a window into mind-opening philosophical concepts such as infinity, fourth dimensions, chaos, and fractals; and a practical training ground for developing skills in analysis, reasoning, and thoughtâ€”if you have the right approach and the right guide.

The Heart of Mathematics: An Invitation to Effective ThinkingÂ­â€”now in its third editionâ€”transforms mathematics into an engaging, relevant experience even for the most math-phobic student. Infusing this book with humor and enthusiasm, Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbirdâ€”both recipients of the Mathematical Association of Americaâ€™s foremost national teaching award and countless state, regional, and campus-wide teaching honorsâ€”introduce students to the most important and interesting ideas in mathematics while inspiring them to actively engage in mathematical thinking.
