[T],joskewarez,2011-06-13T10:47Z,"The best you can do to avoid serial blacklisting is blocking Parallels, the services and parallels updater with Little snitch. Don't block the nat or bridge function!"

,Kilamite,2011-06-21T18:57Z,"This was working fine until today. Looks like Parallels has blocked out all this codes, even for those who had it working fine before.

Any ideas how to fix it?"
,Kilamite,2011-06-21T19:00Z,"Any ideas on how to fix this? Seems to be affecting everyone who has used a pirate serial with Parallels, no matter how long ago it was installed."
[T],joskewarez,2011-06-22T23:56Z,"off course the serials are blocked after a few days, you have to block the connections with little snitch.
Never heard of a 'call home' ? If you're to stupid to use cracked software, buy it!"
