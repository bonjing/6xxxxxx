What a storm that is raging today in Los Angeles, it is impossible to leave the house with such a storm. We stayed in the impressive company Rebeca Linares, it looks like it will one day be legendary. But Rebecca is a little scared, in the wind, rain and the house, straight out of the twisted mind of Norman Bates, Rebecca fears that a thief can enter and take advantage of it. Thankfully Marco Banderas is to protect ... Is not it?.
