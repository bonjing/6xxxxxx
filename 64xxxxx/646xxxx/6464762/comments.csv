I have downloaded several RAR files without any problem, but this one has several files with the RAR files and it won't extract correctly for me.  I was wondering what I needed to do in order to extract these files correctly? It shows several R** files with the archived files."
,Lifemage,2011-06-13T11:18Z,Nevermind! I sort of figured it out.  It's a Windows bug.  I just tried to open it and set it to open using WinRAR from my list of programs instead of using the web.  It took a bit to get it sorted but it's finally working.  Thanks again!
