BOOK INFO:

Future Christ is the first English translation of the work of Francois Laruelle, one of the most exciting voices in contemporary French philosophy and the creator of the practice of `non-philosophy'.In this work Laruelle draws on material from the traditions of Christianity, Judaism and Gnosticism, but he does so by suspending their authority. This adventure in non-philosophy does not claim to think lor religion, but from it as material and with disinterest towards its sell-given status as ultimate authority. This provocative yet remarkably accessible book introduces philosophy to the lessons of heresy and makes use of them in a non-philosophical "dualysis" of messianism and apocalypticism. Laruelle investigates the "heretic question", analogous to but historically distinguished from the "Jewish question", to develop a "non-Christian science" that struggles against and for our World. Future Christ thus opens up novel ways of thinking within existing religious and philosophical thought and marks an incisive and wide-ranging non-philosophical engagement with key contemporary debates in philosophy and theology.
