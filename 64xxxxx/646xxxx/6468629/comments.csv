Lets see how many ppl complain in the comments when they find out it's a cartoon.  For some reason some ppl are so silly they think movies like this are real life actors with huge special effects.  You think it would be advertised a bit more if it was a big blockbuster....  Rather than straight to DVD.  

I loved Gothem Knight, which coincided with the release of the newest Batman movie.  Reminds me of animatrix with the short film approach with different artists working on each section.

With Hal telling different stories about various lanterns I giess this movie is trying to give the audience some background info on the main characters in the upcoming Ryan Renolds movie, which I am so going to go see in 3D as soon as it comes out (August 4th for Australia, Dang).  I'm reading quite a lot of GL comics like blackest night and the brightest day tie-in atm so am super keen to c it.

I'm sure this is going to be as great as the other DC anime movies.  If you like this movie then make sure you check them out.  For instance  Superman/Batman: Apocolypse is an action-packed fantastic movie.     "
