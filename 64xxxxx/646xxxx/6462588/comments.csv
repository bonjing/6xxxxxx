I just heard a wicked track on FG DJ Radio Antwerp... it's about a dj who starts talking dirty to the crowd and suddenly he interrups his set and starts cursing... with lots of f*ck-derivates in it. E.g. he asked if someone of the public got a good record and answered ""what? a cassette???"" etc... you know that track??? It's awesome!"
[T],djjlicious,2011-06-11T23:09Z,"No never heard of it, but if you get the name...let me know! Will use it in a new mix hehehe"
,clubkilla,2011-06-11T23:11Z,"...die maffe track hebben ze een week of 2 geleden nog live gedraaid in Versuz Hasselt in de vroege ochtend. Ik dacht eerst aan Funkagenda - The Beta Set, maar die is het dus niet - heeft geen vocals :("
[T],djjlicious,2011-06-11T23:32Z,"Sorry, can't read the comments....again..pffff"
,clubkilla,2011-06-15T14:21Z,"Had the same problem with the comments. Solution: clean your browser cache/history/session/etc... and compact databases with CCleaner (freeware tool). Works for me :-)
BTW this one is awesome, you surely got talent! I am seeding ."

,clubkilla,2011-06-21T12:54Z,"Yo J-Licious! I finally found out artist & title of that wicked track I was talking about. So check this out: "" Oliver S "" [or Oliver $ - Oliverdollar on Soundcloud] - Track is called "" Doin' Ya Thang [original mix] "".... really one of the predestinated Summer 2011 floorfillers ;-)"
