Wayne's World is a 1992 comedy film starring Mike Myers as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, hosts of the Aurora, Illinois-based cable access television show Wayne's World. The film was adapted from a sketch of the same name on NBC's Saturday Night Live. In 2003, readers of Total Film magazine voted Wayne's World the 41st greatest comedy film of all time.

Filled with pop culture references, the sketches and film started catchphrases such as "Schwing!" and "Schyea", as well as popularizing "That's what she said", "Party on!" and the use of "...Not!" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary. It augmented the slacker language of Generation X, much as Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure had done previously.

==== Wayne's World (1992) ====

Wayne Campbell (Myers) and Garth Algar (Carvey) are the hosts of Wayne's World, a local Friday late-night cable access program based in Aurora, Illinois, where they ogle pictures of beautiful celebrity women, play air guitar and drums, and interview local people, indirectly making fun of them over the course of the interview. The program is popular with local viewers. One day Benjamin Kane (Lowe), a television station executive, is visiting a girlfriend (Ione Skye) who turns the TV to the show. When she tells him how many people watch the show, he instructs his producer Russell Finley (Kurt Fuller) to find out where the show is taped, telling him they may have an opportunity for a huge sponsorship.

==== Wayne's World 2 (1993) ====

Wayne and Garth now do their acclaimed Friday-night TV show in an abandoned doll factory in Aurora. At the end of the broadcast, Wayne, Garth, and his friends, head into the Mirthmobile, and off to an Aerosmith concert. After the band's performance, Wayne and Garth head backstage (thanks to backstage passes), and grovel like they did to Alice Cooper.

That night, Wayne has a dream in which he meets Jim Morrison and a "weird naked Indian", in which Morrison tells Wayne that his destiny is to organize and put on a big concert. Wayne and Garth dub the concert "Waynestock" and get to work. Their early attempts to sign bands and sell tickets fall flat, however, and Wayne wonders if the whole thing was a good idea.
