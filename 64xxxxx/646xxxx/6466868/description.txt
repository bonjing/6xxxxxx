    Soon after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Lena, from the former East       
    Germany, plans a trip to Hollywood. She has planned her itinerary to     
    the minute, but when her bag is switched at the airport and she          
    looses the name of her hotel, all her plans are thrown into chaos,       
    and she finds herself in the middle of a typical Hollywood suspense      
    plot. A friendly cab driver tries to help out, but doesn't believe       
    bad guys are really after her.
