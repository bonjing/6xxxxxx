These Vinyl rips were recorded on a Denon DP-45F turntable using an Audio Technica AT120E cartridge. The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).
Recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.
iZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.

This is A Lot of work folks!





                                         Thelonious Himself




Thelonious Himself is a 1957 album by Thelonious Monk and his first to consist of exclusively solo material including \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Round Midnight\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Monk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s most famous composition. The original CD reissue includes a revelatory 22 minutes of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'Round Midnight\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" outtakes, ideas, and development. The Keepnews Collection edition omits this sequence. In the liner notes Keepnews states that including it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"would have required eliminating virtually every existing alternate take of other selections â€” five other examples of this pianist\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s improvisational genius.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"

The album was originally released in June 1959, featuring saxophonist John Coltrane.
