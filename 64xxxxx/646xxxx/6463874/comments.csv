,yawming,2011-06-14T14:24Z,"Really love your works 20-40. They are all top quality audio, video and all. There is one thing I would like to request of you. You see I am collecting blockbuster movies of which you have many uploads. All I am asking is that you keep the ending credits intact coz the ending credits is also part of the movies. The men behind the scene so they say. I will be truly grateful to you if you ever grant this request of mine. Thanks a lot and more power to you and keep up the good work."

,madmanmgb,2011-06-16T13:40Z,"20-40, thanks for the releases.
I have a request.
Can you encode Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in 720p?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120663/
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5886878
Thanks in advance."
,qudube,2011-06-18T17:10Z,"Thanks Man; I appreciate your effort to help others with your work to bring entertainment to our screens. . 
Thanks Twentyforty. . "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-29T02:04Z,"@madmanmgb
I attempted to encode Eyes Wide Shut several times with Gordian Knot and it came out as about 1.4 GB in two parts when I was trying for around 700 MB in one part.  So you might want to plan for a fairly big file, if twentyforty does do it (he has lots more skill and expertise than me, btw)"
