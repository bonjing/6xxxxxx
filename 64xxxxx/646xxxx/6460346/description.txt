
Trombonist Joe Bowie's free-wheeling outfit Defunkt avoids categorization. They rip through soul, funk, free jazz, rock, and blues, and stretch the limits of each one.
The atmosphere on their records is feverish; they don't do anything in an easy or simple manner.
Not everything they try works, but no Defunkt album is ever dull. (AMG)
