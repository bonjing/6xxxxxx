Tommy Tronic â€“ an old-skool platformer that isnâ€™t trying to be anything else! Jumping, shooting, dodging and exploring is all thatâ€™s required to help get Tommy to his destination and free his tiny puppy from the clutches of an insane genius school-kid and his brutal sidekick â€˜Biffaâ€™. It would be straight forward too, if it wasnâ€™t for the fact that this journey will take Tommy through Gnarly wood; a twisted and eerie forest that adults avoid let alone tiny children! Imagination runs amok as Tommy confronts his childish fears head on, all in a bid to be reunited with his beloved pal â€˜Yapzâ€™!
