Just a few questions...
 As two previous people asked, does the user name have to be ""Image 17"" or can it be something else.
Also, was there anything taken out of the various versions (games, etc, useless stuff) in order to fit them all onto one DVD?
And finally my last question is... If I were to use this with a serial key (I commonly fix others computers of people with their own legit keys) all I would have to do is restore Windows Activation Technology and enter in the key?

Thank you for your time and keep up the great work MAFIAA!"

great torrent,
I have one issue. I loaded the BIOS to boot cd/dvd, yet when I restart there is no screen 'press any key' and it just loads my OS from my HD.

Error code: 0x80070017

I get this error when I start the installation, it finishes copying files, then moves on to expanding files. Sits at 0% for a while, then the error pops up. I boot from my CD Drive, even tried just installing it in plain windows. Sick of this error. Tried removing ram stick... no luck. Help please!"
,georgekg,2011-06-29T18:36Z,"dwight28 I found this googling Error code: 0x80070017

""I would also suggest using a different DVD drive, or maybe copying the installation files to a USB stick (4gb or bigger) and performing a USB install.

The error 0x80070017 translates to ""CRC Error"" which means that the files that are being copied from the disk are not making it to the hard drive with the same structure, meaning that the ""original"" files on the disk are being modified/changed/corrupted while being copied to the ""destination"" location on your hard drive during the install.

This usually means either a bad DVD, or a read error on the DVD drive.  

The easiest thing is to make a USB drive to install Window s7 (and it's WAY faster than DVD too!)

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd535816.aspx 




1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:
Click Start
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD
Click 'Run as Administrator'
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.

    1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
       User Account Control permission
       If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
   2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.
   3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.
   4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
   5. Click OK.
   6. When you are prompted, click Restart.
   7. Attempt the upgrade again

Also, run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, it will scan your system and provide a report telling you if your PC can run Windows 7 and if there are any known compatibility issues with your programs or hardware.

If this is a digital download of Windows 7, try burning again at the lowest speed possible or download another copy of the software and try downloading again.

Also check the following:

It seems this particular error may be more likely attributable to a SATA-connected DVD issue.

so now i put the dvd in de rom station , and when i boot from dvd the windos instal screen tells me = starting up windows , and after that it keeps hanging on a ugly screen wit big pixelation .

is this the effect of burning it with 16x speed instead of 4x speed ? , or is there another thing that i did wrong ?

i hope for some solutions .

Yeah, that was worrisome, having the Not Genuine warning come up.  For me, it takes about 5 updates and reboots to get W7 updated. You have to click to check for updates even after bring up the Update panel.

What has worked to stop the warnings was to simply turn off automatic updating. Apparently MS has figured out how to spot this install and does so by checking its update center after booting, without telling the user that it is contacting MS.

That's my theory, and turning off auto update stopped the warning.

Try it and get back to the forum.

I guess I'll hold off doing updates until there are enough of them or something important such that it's time to update again."

,Mitch_Bainwol,2011-07-26T04:27Z,"Another followup on getting a nag screen about not running Genuine Windows.

There's still no indication it's going to kill my windows. The options are to go online to ""resolve"" the issue, or hit cancel.  It's annoying, but doesn't interfere with using the system.  It takes hours before it shows up again. I'm going to try moving the next one out of view to see if that stops more from showing up.

I've just built three systems using this. The other two: one I turned off and set aside, the other I finished for a friend. When he comes to pick it up, suddenly it gets hit.

During a boot, an astonishing 19,000+ ""registry settings"" were updated. Then during the Windows starting and flag coming together, the words Not Genuine Windows appear in the lower right and stays there.

It wanted activation.  I hit it with DAZ, which I've never used before. It turns out to be a Windows .exe that reboots the system about 30s later.  That's done the trick so far, including at least four reboots.

His system was configured to not check for updates. Get to the Control Panel screen entitled ""Choose how Windows can install updates.""  Even though it's ""Never check for updates"", the two checkboxes underneath it are not subordinate. So I unticked ""Give me recommended updates the same way I receive Important updates"" and ""Allow all users to install updates on this computer.""

Hmmm, is this clever legalese? A user could be any defined account, whether belonging to a person or to the system.  So while Windows Update might not check for updates, a system account might?

Yes.

On my nag screen box, I finished my environment setup, including installing Privoxy. It listens on localhost:8118, then I go to Firefox -> Tools -> Option -> Advanced -> Network -> Settings and
put in the proxy info. For HTTP/S it is effectively a new default route.

Given the nag screen, I keep looking at Events, and this started showing up:

Event Viewer -> Windows logs -> Application
ERROR  Source CAPI2  Event ID  4107
General: Failed extract of third-party root list from auto update cab at:  with error: A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file.

   A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file.  
--

What's being blocked in my Privoxy file?

.windowsupdate.com

That takes out that domain and any higher levels.

In other words, Windows is contacting Windows Update at MS to update it's security info, which then results in a nag screen. It's updating even though updates are off.

A google turned up: ""The newer DAz loader is much diffrent than the one available a few months ago, since it is now full encrypted.""

My impression is that it is checking the boot SLIC encryption certificates against a known list.  That after flagging it as not being a known third party it has cached that info and as a result I get nagged.  But that it's not sure(!) whether or not it's Genuine, and so doesn't get nasty about it (yet).

From Wikipedia:
Some BIOSes contain a ""SLIC"" (Software Licensing Information Code), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the manufacturer, for example Dell. This SLIC is inserted in the ACPI table and contains no active code. Computer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and/or system recovery disc containing Windows software. Systems having a SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see System Locked Preinstallation).

On my nag screen box, it's just that, nothing more.

However, that's two builds by me where this torrent was spotted as not genuine.  The RemoveWAT is being spotted.

Different people have commented variously that it's demanding an activation key (my friend's system was in that category) or that when you right click on Computer in the file browser window that the Properties page tells them how many days they have left to activate.

My main system is caught in a sort of limbo where a nag screen comes up, but there's no repercussions otherwise, no days left warning. But I'll probably run DAZ at some point. Other people here are have no problems so far. FYI, I'm installing Ultimate 64.

Searching around, I found a thread where both Hazar (RemoveWAT) and DAZ (SLIC in-memory fakeout) were posting:

RemoveWAT isn't supported here anymore as the developers stopped working on it and it no longer works.

If you're wondering whether to use this torrent: go ahead. But get the DAZ loader so it can be used if-when MS spots this Win 7 as Not Genuine.

I supposed I would use this sequence on a new build:

o on removeable media put the Privoxy and DAZ programs and latest Firefox installers
o install this Win 7 without the Net
o install Firefox
o install Privoxy
o edit User actions in Privoxy to have '.windowsupdate.com' and say '.microsoft.com'
o tell Firefox about the proxy for HTTP/S
Firefox -> Tools -> Option -> Advanced -> Network -> Settings and
put in the proxy info for HTTP/S to use localhost:8118 (not ftp)
o test that you can't access windowsupdate.com using Firefox
o connect to the Net
o install other torrents such as CS5.5 (CS is now 64-bit OSes only) and the cool lifetime license version of MS Office
o run MS Update repeatedly (restarting after each) and telling it to check for updates until there are no more. To get rid of all the optional language packs from listing as available, right click and select 'hide.'
o run DAZ the second you get blowback
o I would then turned off updates and uncheck the boxes underneath it too (allow all users to update)  If I ever feel the need to update, I'll wait until there's a bunch and be ready to use DAZ.
o report back here if your install gets flagged and how well DAZ dealt with it

Since I have caught MS contacting MS Update Center even though I told it no updates, and since privoxy isn't running during boot, either unplug the Net during boots or add exclusion rules to a router. Everyone should be using a router for another layer of security anyway.

I found only one reference to it in google, but it was by DAZ himself in 2009.

I had to install WAT in order for DAZ to work. Where...? Oh, you run RemoveWAT (faxcool) and there's a button to InstallWAT too.

InstallWAT died.  It couldn't write some file in system32. Hit Continue or Cancel. Continue caused coolfax to hang.  I think the taskbar was gone including the start button and all windows explorers blown out too, I forget if it was coolfax or DAZ that did that. I suggest being logged into the admin account and having Disk Management open, cos that's how I managed to get a file browser again ('open').

To open up permissions (even though I was already running as admin user) it's just weird strange ACL stuff through the properties GUI. Okay, get Properties of system32, click on tab security. Hit edit, type in the name of your admin account and enter (hopefully it'll find it). Then check Full Control. Then you have to get completely out and open Properties again. I'm not sure if every file was changeable. Then I turned off Read Only in the General tab and did that recursively too. I'm a Unix admin, I don't really know what I'm doing in Windows. Oh, there was some sequence of doing 'Advanced' in the security tab then tab Owner and doing something. Sorry I'm fuzzy on this. I'm pretty much just clicking and hoping. I hate being reduced to doing that.

I think I had to reboot at that point. I unplugged the Net.

Then InstallWAT succeeded and wanted me to reboot. But I then ran DAZ, which (held breath) succeeded.

Rebooted without the Net. Rebooted again with the Net.

All clear.  Phew."

I try to do a clean install booting from CD but it will only load the files, then goes towards a black screen with a white cursor that I can move around but it hangs there for awhile. I've waited for at least half an hour before giving up and restarting. 

In the meantime, I installed it over the old Win 7 OS I was using (not clean install) just for the sake of restarting all my Windows settings because I recently lost sound, etc.

Run it as admin and you are activated for 180 days. Read the page for more info.


Unforchantly you cant get pernanment activators for Enterprise. This activates it for 180days then you re-do the process. You get the Genuine badge and updates.

If you want to you can try this

Use one of the 7loaders by Hazar and Orbit30 (v1.5 or 1.6) and see if that works. If it does its pernamently activated. It did not work for me.

IMPORTANT - USE THE 7LOADER BEFORE THE 180 DAY ACTIVATOR

Answer this question - in Ultimate whats the bitlocker feature and do you use it? No. I am not surprised. Most people choose Ultimate cause of the name. Enterprise and Ultimate are EXACTLY the same. Only difference is Enterprise uses MAK keys and is supported till 2020 while Ultimate only until 2015. So if anyone has a new computer or a pc that will last a long time choose Professional or Enterprise. There are supported until 2020. MAK keys come out every so often and they permanently activate your Windows without any cracks.

So there you go - loads of others use something other than ultimate. Also some people might have Netbooks and would want to install Starter or Home Basic/Premium."

,flightc,2011-09-09T06:49Z,"I'm experiencing problems on install.  Keep in mind, I'm doing an upgrade, fresh install is not possible in my position.  When I boot from dvd-drive, it goes through it's typical processes of getting the files ready for install, asks me which version I want to install, etc.  Once I click the upgrade option, it tells me that the installation was started with the install disc, and to eject it and boot windows normally then insert the windows disc in and install from there (meaning install in windows).  Well when I try that, again after it loads all the setup files and asks what I want to install, it tells me to use the ""windows anytime upgrade"" option inside windows.  That doesn't work because you either have to have a key or you buy one right then.  Sooooo.......any thoughts?  Thanks"

This works as tried by myself on 7 Ultimate Build 7601.
Uninstall Remove Wat/Loaders etc. Uninstall Update KB971033. Open elevated command prompt(Type cmd in search box, right click, Run As Administator). Type the following, EXACTLY ""slmgr -rearm"" (without the "").
Hit enter.
Close Cmd prompt. Reboot TWICE. This should remove the Non Genuine notice. Now set your desktop background. (Right click desktop, select Personalize, etc) Go into updates and HIDE KB971033. That should be it.
Check in System. Should say Windows is Activated.

@muhammad15 there's a program out there via Google search which integrates all versions of Windows 7, you can make your own custom image if you wish but then again...this torrent already has all the goodies.

...for some users who may experience genuine pop up issues just use one of many Win 7 activators off TPB.

...for anyone who wishes to burn .ISO image to blank DVD-R, use ImgBurn latest ver. is 2.5.6.0 released Oct 2011 get it here @ http://www.imgburn.com/

,SpudGunz2,2011-12-03T08:05Z,"Used the ""Windows 7 USB Tool"" to put the .iso on a USB flash-drive.

When starting the computer, enter BIOS option to change boot order and/or boot from USB.

Run the install like any regular installation.
There should be no need to enter a key.
Choose whichever version you wish.
Put in whatever username you wish.
****Disable Automatic Windows Update.****

After the install finishes your system will try logging into windows for the first time, and you will receive an error message and your system will restart. This is the silent auto-activation MAFIAA mentioned. You should now be logged into windows.

After logging onto Windows, go to Windows Update>Change Settings
Select:
""Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them""

On the first 4-5 updates Windows will want you to install: 
Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool (KB890830)
DO NOT INSTALL.
Uncheck this update, and then right-click to ""Hide update"".
Windows releases an update for this every month, so you will have to make sure to check this every time you want to do an update. Installing this could deactivate your windows."

,onanetvoya,2012-01-13T02:43Z,"Let's see what the info says:

'This is the most complete release which includes all available versions of Windows 7 (except ""N"" and ""E"" editions)'

Yes, except N and E editions!! And you do not want these!
My first ever was a N edition, because I didn't want mediaplayer and stuff. It was a huge mistake!!! For what Microsoft do not tell you is, that N editions cannot be OEM-activated using the known bios loader trickery!!
This will only work with versions neither N nor E."
,onanetvoya,2012-01-13T03:41Z,"And here's another comment of mine, after reading literally 100 posts of you guys (some of which contained a helluva lot of valuable information, thank you for that!)

I read about so many problems people had in burning the image. Ever tried burning on LINUX?
For example, I once had a similar problem with Build 7600 RTM (when W7 was brand new).
The solution was to burn the ISO with K2B/K3B under KNOPPIX (5.1 recommended) which is a live CD linux OS, in DAO mode. Worked a treat.

I know well that we're now under 6.X versions but they replaced K2B with Brasero (which I can't recommend at all!!!). So stick to the oldie but goodie =D"
,HARDcoreTPBfan,2012-01-13T11:53Z,"what you guys mean the serial doesnt work?

iv installed this, had it for 3 days now, and i HAVE installed updates except the 1 mentioned in the info, it works perfect (i went from vista home edition to win7 ultimate) it has not asked me for a seriel key"
,qjrmakstp,2012-01-14T02:12Z,"It works great. I am now running on Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1.
However, I'm not completely sure that this is a genuine copy from my observations by testing the installation twice. It installed great both times.
However, first time I was trying to install Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, I was asked for a Windows serial key, so I entered one because I had one available at that moment.
Second time, I wasn't asked for any serial keys, but the installation went fine.

1. But when I try to download Windows XP Mode & Virtual PC from Microsoft's official website, the validation is interrupted and I am told to purchase a copy of Windows.

2. If I go on my computer systems properties, I don't see any product key or any option to change the product key. (Maybe I'm a noob and I'm mistaken for this one...)
But I checked the validation status for the Windows that I was using (actually this is the one that I am using right now), the validation goes fine and it says the validation was successful.

So I don't know.
MAFIAA, or anyone else, do you know why is it like that?

Is there any other way to see the serial/product key that is registered currently for your Windows?

And thank you so much for uploading this, by the way. It's great.
But answer my questions, please.
Thanks!"
,CONSCIOUSINSANITY,2012-01-14T11:14Z,I installed this and everything seemed to go smooth accept in sys properties it says that I still need to activate windows. Your description  says that this should auto-activate. Did I do something wrong?
,HARDcoreTPBfan,2012-01-14T16:42Z,"guys there is a programme in this file which is called hacktoolz, no its not a virus noobs, its what makes this version run without an activation key, it works great, it may be a flaw in what -bit your using, i used x86(32-bit). iv had no pop ups or when i goto system props it does not show an activation key, you guys should just be happy with what ya getting here this is a great DL"

,Dicehunter,2012-01-18T04:50Z,"not really that good to be honest, couldnt install MSE, took a while to restore wat, too much messing around to get it to work for a 64 bit OS, thanks for the work but more work needs to go into these things."

,roxas_nevermore,2012-01-19T01:09Z,"Totally agree with dicehunter, with this one, it's not easy voila youre genuine. Because the wat is deactivated and to get a genuine copy of windows, you need wat."
,roxas_nevermore,2012-01-19T01:22Z,"i take it back, it's fairly easy to get a real genuine windows, or at least for me, only needed removewat 2.2.6 to restore it and loader by daz and voila, GENUINE"

,porygon90,2012-01-23T22:20Z,Nice and easy to install one of the best ISO's that I've ever downloaded. Thanks!

,Tzannetos,2012-01-25T18:59Z,PLZ!!!! SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME STEP BY STEP HOW TO DO THE FIRST TWO STEPS PPPPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!
,romaanx,2012-01-25T21:41Z,"Downloaed it... but there's NO iso file. It's just files and folders when I extracted it. There's two .exe files... one is setup.exe and the other is setup64.exe?? What do I did? Did I do something wrong?
"
,Solistus,2012-01-27T05:27Z,"Tzannetos: Step one isn't needed anymore, it was there for older releases where the .iso file was compressed to a .rar.  Just ignore it, the current version of this torrent has basically already done that step for you.  Step two is just telling you to burn the .ISO to a DVD.  Any DVD burning program should support .ISO files, and any of them will work fine.  If you can't or don't want to burn a DVD, you can use a USB flash drive instead (as long as it's at least 4GB).  Microsoft has a free utility you can run that will take this .ISO file and load it onto a USB flash drive, then you can boot to the USB drive and install right from there: http://images2.store.microsoft.com/prod/clustera/framework/w7udt/1.0/en-us/Windows7-USB-DVD-tool.exe  All you have to do is plug in your USB thumb drive, download and install the program from the link above, then run it.  Then you can install off that USB drive without having to burn a DVD.  

romaanx: The torrent itself just has a 4.22GB .ISO file and a tiny .NFO text file.  The .ISO file contains all the folders and files you're looking at.  It sounds like you mounted that .ISO instead of burning it to a disc.  Find the original .ISO file in the folder you save your torrent downloads to, and then follow the steps that I outlined above for Tzannetos to either burn a DVD or make a bootable USB drive from it.  The disk or drive you end up with will have the same files and folders you're looking at now, but if you just copy the files and folders to the disk or drive then it (probably) won't work."
,teddy619,2012-01-28T18:48Z,dude what the hell! this sucks! its not the real thing! how do I uninstall this! i had Windows 7 Home Premium and i DL this progam of yours and it is nothing like the original Ultimate pack. my system is 64bit and sp1 is what i used but lots of my program for my system dont work! keeps asking me to use it as administrator. I just want to remove it! how can i restore my original version?
,teddy619,2012-01-29T09:06Z,"@bluerazorblade 
yes your right.. I said and moved to soon.. and its my fault.. I didnt back up some of my files first.. its just I have to re-install all the program i had, good thing is does back up some files in (windows.old) folder as it does.. but it did erase all my firefox bookmarks also.. lol but oh well.. and yes this is a GREAT APP!! my bad.. it just sucks thats i am re-installing my programs i had before.. my antivirus program also didnt work so i had to re-install it.. when i went to my control panel on uninstall programs there was nothing there? all tho i had a hard time finding them in my system.. but everything is fine now. its all that matters thanks! and sorry again for my temper =) lol"
,teddy619,2012-01-29T09:21Z,oh and it keeps asking me for a product key which I dont have? I thought it wasn't needed? how can I fix this or get one?
,makaflunper,2012-01-29T17:05Z,"Doesn't pass validation test from Microsoft. If you want to install microsoft security essentials for example, it will fail."
,teddy619,2012-01-30T08:12Z,"If this helps anyone NOT being able to remove WAT files, well simple thing I do to by pass TrustedInstaller to remove WAT files.. just right click the file then select properties, select security, select advanced, select Owner, select edit, and the owner screen pops up and then you select Administrator(exc...) then click apply, click ok then click ok on all your lil windows and then right click on the WAT files your gonna remove and go to properties and select security, click edit and you should be able to click full control on all 4 group or user names you select. simple thing if you want to remove the WAT files. 
Also Hacktool is NOT! a virus!"

,blooms4me2012,2012-01-31T12:42Z,"Hi Mafiaa,, U rockk to the core !!!!
Keep it up - v need more people like you....

Tried out Ultimate 32 bit and its the best.
Not tried any updates till now. Not tried microsoft security essentials also.

You can obviously work without that.

@hootkits, i had the similar doubt and i tried it on my PC, if anything is stored in your hard drives, it wont get deleted, whereas the remaining stuff - all thats in the c drive if thats where ur planning to install the windows will wipe out. so make proper backup before you start.

I have ALL new hardware... no problems with downloading (although My connection is too slow) and no problems burning or installing this .iso onto my computer.
I first experimented with 7 Starter and 7 Professional 32-bit.  I then formatted and installed 7 Ultimate 32-bit and used DAILY for over 40 days as my go to computer, no problems whatsoever with updates or anything else. (including Microsoft Security Essentials) The only thing that concerned me was in SIW, the License Status was showing as GRACE with # of days left.  I watched this closely and after the thirty days… nothing happened to my installation, everything remained fully functional and updateable.
Next, I formatted again with NTFS and installed “MAFIAA. Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Service Pack 1”.  Everything is the same now, but the only issue with 64-bit is that it will not accept MSE even after restoring WAT, installing MSE, and removing WAT.  I kept getting a message that my copy of Windows was not genuine and that after 30 days MSE would stop working.  But, Windows Update and EVERYTHING else was still working fine.  Curious.  I proceeded to use one of the many ‘loaders’ available and so now I am commenting from a genuine validated Windows 7 Ultimate x64 Service Pack 1 with running Microsoft Security Essentials protecting my computer.  In SIW, my Activation Status is “Activated” and my License Status is “Licensed”.  Now, there is even a genuine graphic in Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsSystem.

I have been using this torrent which i have booting off of a USB drive for a long time,  the reason for the gigabyte branding you saw was simply for these reasons.

1. You have a gigabyte motherboard.
2. There is a script that runs that detects your motherboard manufacturer and brands it accordingly and adds all the OEM information and logo's into you about windows page.

There is nothing wrong with the image file, it is clean.  It just changes the default theme to match whatever you install it on.  Try it on a dell or HP.  you will get the dell or HP logos and OEM info   :)

confused me the first install too tho,  but its a nice feature"

,Eldest584,2012-06-09T02:00Z,Umm I'm not sure if this is just me but when I tried to download the file you told me to. Or burn it I should say. To a disc it only copied over like250 mb instead of the full 4.2gigs. Is this normal?Please help
,extracube,2012-06-09T10:03Z,"@Kazuma88,

did you ever think that maybe to two ""trojans"" are really just false flags that were put there by the Antivirus software as part of a piracy prevention?  (I.e. the trojans perhaps aren't real, but made up by the Antivirus companies?)  I'm really not sure, that's why I'm asking you.  BTW don't get so pissed!"
,Kazuma88,2012-06-09T17:19Z,"ATTENTION DONT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT READ!
@extracube

No,it has nothing to do with this

I downloaded another torrent of Win 7 and at that version did not have any viruses

I know there are cracks which actually are not viruses but our anti virus software thinks they are viruses

But these cracks wont have names like Trojan.ADS etc.If the our anti virus software thinks that a crack is a virus then it will report as ""something.exe"" not as Trojan.ADS.Dont think that every uploader is a good person,this guy just tries to fool people and im pissed because there are people like this

Anyway everyone stop downloading this crap,i found a clean version of Win 7 here is the link:
http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7301621/Windows_7_All_Editions_SP1_(x86_x64)_[ThumperDC]

No virus,i scanned it more times"
,extracube,2012-06-10T17:57Z,"Thanks for the reply and info.

I went ahead and extracted this ISO, and while I was doing it with AVG running in the background, two different virus warnings popped up.  I'll type them here the best I can:

m:sources$OEM$$$SetupscriptsfaXcool.exe

described as Hacktool.PBY warning.  Also:

m:toolsenterpriseHAL7600 v1.2HAL7600.exe

described as Trojanhorse Generic3_c.AQYZ.dropper

Just a brief internet search shows that both faXcool and HAL7600 are some kind of hacktools used to disable Windows Genuine Advantage.  Is it possible there are malicious and harmful operations that could hurt you besides their original function?  Maybe, I'm not sure.  I won't comment on this as I am no big techie and will leave it to others to analyze / comment on what these mean.  However you do also have to stop and ask why is this torrent by far the most popular and even promoted by TPB Mods themselves.  This torrent has gotten tons of praise, apparently.

Besides the above listed torrent of Windows 7 by ThumperTM, I also had good success with the new Windows 7 SP1 May 2012 by Maherz, uploaded by username Tigerpol.  Only 2.66 GB, has worked nicely so far."
,EvilTaco1994,2012-06-11T23:44Z,"@Kazuma88 You're a fucking idiot. Those ""trojans"" are what makes it work. Do you seriously think Microsoft is going just let you waltz through and take free software people pay around $200-300 for?"
,danthemanturtleman1,2012-06-13T03:02Z,Hi so its working just fine just one problem can someone help me it says i have 21 days to activate it i thought it automatically activated i downloaded windows 7 ultimate 64 bit.
,Lehub,2012-06-13T15:03Z,Do I have to burn the torrent over on a CD or a memory-stick to use it???
,boogeyman269,2012-06-13T21:28Z,Burn it on cd.
,iprento,2012-06-14T14:56Z,The only Windows 7 torrent you will ever need! Thanks a zillion.

,TastyTeo,2012-06-15T20:24Z,Working Perfectly! Thanks!! By the way how did you manage to put ALL EDITIONS into a 4GB file? Amazing Work!
,Palpatin3,2012-06-16T16:20Z,"Don't waste your bandwidth with this shit, NOD32 detected viruses. Use untouched en_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_677332 ISO then get loader to activate. (Make sure loader is updated)"
,ttrash100,2012-06-18T10:58Z,"WHERE is the virus ?!?
