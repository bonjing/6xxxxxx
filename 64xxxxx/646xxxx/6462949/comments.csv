I can add all of HR and O.O.O films, but when I try to add yours it says this was not copied to ipod because it is not compatible.  Please help mate because it looks like you are doin some great work cheers"
[T],MelloYello,2011-06-18T05:17Z,I made a new profile and checked my settings.  Everything should be fine now. Sorry for any problems.  I think an old profile I had saved might of had a wrong setting.
