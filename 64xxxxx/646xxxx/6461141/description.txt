This 1990 release was a gloriously overlong melange of styles, bound together by some of Paddy MacAloon's most inspired melodies. The nineteen tracks cover a typically diverse range of subject matters, including a quartet of songs about the rise and fall of Elvis Presley that provide the album with its thematic core. Elsewhere, on songs such as We Let The Stars Go, All The World Loves Lovers and Doo Wop In Harlem MacAloon's songwriting hit new peaks. One of the best groups in pop history at peak form.
