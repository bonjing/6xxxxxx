,Ichthus,2011-06-12T15:29Z,Thanks! Looks very interesting!
,Scratzz,2011-06-14T03:23Z,"I'll borrow this for a while. Thank you.
Opera is not my gig, but this one is good.
I've seen it alive."
,LucyWoof,2011-06-17T02:23Z,You can probably see it better alive than dead. :-)
,Scratzz,2011-06-17T11:08Z,"Sorry LucyWoof, I meant live at the Opera house. I have one more I would like to see ""live"". That's Don Giovanni. But it would never happend in this lifetime. My substitute is a DVD from Italy(2009), and it's good.

,Scratzz,2011-07-14T16:53Z,I've dropped this one. Yeah 47% and one month. I'll buy it instead.
,LucyWoof,2012-02-12T02:37Z,It's on forced initial seeding so that should keep it alive.
