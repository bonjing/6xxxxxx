,OscarTheSlouch,2011-09-17T06:19Z,"DOWNLOADERS NOTE: This file (and several others by the same uploader) contain a video stream that some hardware players cannot play. (The audio stream works fine.) Software-based players (like VLC) seem unaffected by the problem and work fine. If you plan to use a hardware-based player, test it before you spend a lot of time downloading!"
