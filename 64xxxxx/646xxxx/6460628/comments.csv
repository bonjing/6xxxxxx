yeah its def not anything like soilwork....
lol but i knew that anyway, it does have some more flow compared to older albums, which i do like, but some purists will flip there banana. 
MMy preferred metal genres are Metalcore and Melodic Death Metal anyway. but so far its not a bad album at all"

Good quality.. Although.. Who ever did the ID3 Tags/Album Info is fucked in the head... ""Khaos Overture"" was in a different album then the rest of CD1... Corrected them all now and added album art..."
,BodomChild666,2011-08-16T21:27Z,Actually... Had to use fucked Windows Media Player to correct this.. iTunes would not even if all of them were set to same artist same album... If yall wanna fix this open up CD1 in WMP and select all then click   get info.. :D
