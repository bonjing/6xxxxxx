Power Point 2003 Tuturial.

To install this program:
- Close down all applications
- Insert CD into your CD ROM drive
- It it doesn't then please install using the following method:
Click Start, Run, then type D:\e2003.exe (substitute D for the letter of your CD drive if different) then click on OK

I am not sure if this program will install without the CD, it seems that way on my computer. 
Please leave feedback, if the file does not install I will remove this torrent.

I have WORD 2003 and EXCEL 2003 Tutorials also available, let me know if this one works I will create torrents for the other 2 as well.
