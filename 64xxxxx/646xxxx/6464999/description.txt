Fabulous Stage on Screen version of the iconic movie, starring Cynthia Nixon, Jennifer Tilly, Kristen Johnston, Jennifer Coolidge (steals the show), and many others, with costumes by Isaac Mizrahi!  I only saw this aired once on PBS, and captured it in VHS format.  Sorry for the low resolution, but it's still thoroughly enjoyable.  Also, cast interview by Jason Alexander at Intermission.
