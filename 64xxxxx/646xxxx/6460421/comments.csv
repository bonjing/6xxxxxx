Just shows what complete trash religion is.

Deluded fools the lot of them!!!"
,BigUglyMotha,2011-06-13T12:20Z,"This book is about History not religion, grow a brain. To doubt the veracity of this ancient literature is to deny the foundation of our own western civilization. Nothing can be built on lies and yet our whole civilization is built on the principles of freedom which emanate from these early writings.

[Hey, TPB, since using Facebook, when i see comments i like, i keep looking for the 'like' button these days, happens elsewhere too as it happens, lol's. 
Be a good addition to the plus/minus rating (which i should but use much), having a like button on each comment, and could hide unpopular ones, spammy comments etc by minus votes, simialr to Kickass.
Must bother to mention that on Suprbay one day!]"
,lapis2,2012-01-16T22:51Z,the bible is trash for dimwits.
,lapis2,2012-01-16T22:54Z,@BigUglyMotha  have you ever heard of the Greeks you dumb-ass?  our whole civilization is built on the principles of freedom of Greek culture.  your statement only proves how ignorant you are.
