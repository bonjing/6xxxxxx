Don't want RAR, then don't down RAR. 

Thanks for the up, and the RAR."

,rafaelprp,2011-06-13T05:27Z,"The uploader has a long list of releases. I'm convinced. Downloading now.

PS: I didn't knew that winrar was so difficult to use that people gets mad when files are compressed. :)"

,quick92,2011-06-13T05:59Z,Hey can someone explain the benefits of .rar downloads? Im a nub at this kinda down load but this is the only Game of thrones that is worth downloading. And also what to do with them when there done.
,Kalambaka,2011-06-13T06:24Z,"why rar ???? There is no reason to split an AVI , moron"
,silvah-,2011-06-13T06:38Z,"quick, go to www.rarlab.com and download winrar.
and then just click on one of the rar files of this download and a window with the avi file will open, just drag it to the desktop or something and your done. :)"
,Ludio,2011-06-13T06:50Z,".rar allows the .avi file to be split into smaller files. this helped back when it took awhile to download and errors made it so you had to restart the download. also useful for irc. all you have to do is have a program to extract compressed files. winrar, etc. just extract and boom there's your .avi"
,auntystatic,2011-06-13T07:30Z,"the problem with rar means it takes twice the disk space if you want me to seed it, I normally unrar then delete the rar to save space, that means no seeding which everyone complains about, why save 6k by raring?"
