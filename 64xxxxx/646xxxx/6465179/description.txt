The International UFO Congress

The IUFOC was established in 1991 and hosts an annual conference on UFOs and related phenomena. The Conference was held in Laughlin, NV until 2011 when it moved to the Phoenix, Arizona area.

The conference boasts more than 20 speakers and a plethora of exhibitors from around the globe, and covers a large variety of topics related to the UFO phenomenon including technology, government cover-ups, exopolitics, black projects, crop circles, alien visitation and more. Panels of astrophysicists, nuclear physicists, abductees, and former top-secret-clearance military personnel make up just a portion of highly decorated and influential speakers.
