                           The Gloria Story - Shades of White
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The Gloria Story was founded in SkÃ¶vde, Sweden, early 2009. The five members of the group had grown tired of their previous, sleepy, small town bands and decided to put together a hard working, determined band of brothers, aiming at the top of the industry. The Gloria Story was formed with the ambition of digging deep down to their various musical roots. Growing up with heroes like Kiss, Hellacopters, Cheap Trick, Mott the Hoople, Stones and even David Bowie The Gloria Story instantly found a natural path to follow. They created their own sound based on contemporary rock and roll, flavoured with loads of old school ingridients.
