Book Description
================
If it is true that the test of a first-rate mind is its ability to hold 
two contradictory ideas at the same time, then we live in a century 
when it takes a first-rate mind just to get through the day. We have 
unprecedented access to information; cognitive dissonance is a banner 
headline in our morning papers and radiates silently from our computer 
screens. Slipstream, poised between literature and popular culture, 
embraces the dissonance. 

These ambitious stories of visionary strangeness defy the conventions 
of science fiction. Tales by Michael Chabon, Karen Joy Fowler, Jonathan 
Lethem, Carol Emshwiller, George Saunders, and others pull the reader 
into a vivid dreamspace and embrace the knowledge that life today is 
increasingly surreal.
