,some-young-guy,2011-06-14T16:51Z,Couldn't you splice in the missing 55 seconds from another cam version for fluidity purposes?
,stumpybob,2011-06-14T18:27Z,"Thanks again froggie, i get a lot of your stuff and its always great quality. Appreciate all the effort into fixing these new movies up."
,AUhair,2011-06-15T23:48Z,Can we get some A/V ratings here?
,skullhill,2011-06-16T03:06Z,V7 A8 No one eating chips in the background in this copy. This is WAY watchable. Good job.
,deadwetdog,2011-06-16T07:27Z,i realy apreciate the hard work of uploaders but why do assholes have to make it so much more dificult to find torrents by misslableing them this is a cam not high res no one cares how fancy the cam is its still not high res lable your shit corect or leave it be and someone who knows the difrence will

,UlrikR,2011-06-16T10:22Z,Dont post Movies in Highres-Movies when there NOT!
,CastorFire63,2011-06-17T02:55Z,"I just want to thank deadwetdog, UlrikR, and grrrrrt808. I was excited that someone posted a high-res vid of this so soon, am disappointed to find that it's a cam, no matter how good of a cam it is. I just saved myself some time. Oh well, at least I don't have a bandwidth limit."
,ericv1984,2011-06-17T05:53Z,"@CastorFire63, the movie was released not even a week ago, if you really thought someone uploaded an actual ""high-res"" version this soon then your an idiot.

Actually, if ANYONE thinks there is a high-res version uploaded this soon then you're all morons."
,SD_rocks,2011-06-17T13:07Z,"such idiots u guys are, u know wat high-res even means??
it means that its resolution is high i.e in this case 720p

look at the info it says its 1280x544 pixels

even a cam copy can be high-res if its shot with a  high res cam AT THE HALL assholes!

he never mentioned it is a blu-ray/hd copy or something, just read the name carefully idiots 
Super 8 2011 720p TS READNFO XViD - IMAGiNE

i sure hope u guys werent dmumb enough to see it says ""TS""

fuckin assholes"
,fredfan,2011-06-17T16:55Z,"@SD_rocks:  I'm really not sure why you're so emotionally (and crudely) defending the choice to put a long-distance picture of a screen that happened to use an ""HD"" cam to capture it in this classification.  There is a separate classification for CAMs, and the two are distinct for a reason--it's not a technical distinction.  It's for ease of searching and honest classification of the end resullts.

Also, uploaders may wish to consider that blurring those lines harms their cred, if that matters.  I suppose an MPAA plant would actually love it, but for everyone else... :)"
,fredfan,2011-06-17T16:57Z,"Also, leaked screeners have produced GREAT copies of movies, often BEFORE their theatrical release.  It's not ""dmumb"" at all.  I've seen it often, though less commonly now."
,deadwetdog,2011-06-17T21:33Z,actualy ericv v its rare but sometimes thay do comeout at the same timenot often sherlock holmes was the last one iv seen it came out in high def les than a week after it did in theater so fuck you

,hypn0t1c,2011-06-18T15:49Z,"Stop putting cams in the high res section. You're not fooling anyone, you're just pissing people off."
,Dem0nTAP,2011-06-18T23:42Z,"well i download it iwas really fast :)

Ya, M:3.  3.  Waste of time.  (Spoiler:  It's E.T., but with the Predator.  That's all.  WAY too slow.)

,Silencer7,2011-06-19T10:51Z,"Actually I should lower that V rating to:  V:8
Still really decent tho.  Little dark, very slightly crooked (unnoticeable except at title.)  But, I have seen superior cam video, so I'll lower this to:  V:8"

This is  the best copy Ive seen of this movie "

,spankbot,2011-06-21T07:57Z,"Ah fuck.  It's a damn CAM.  Fuck you, third world rippers.  Wait for a proper DVD or BR rip kids."
,somedude.1001,2011-06-21T09:49Z,stop putting ts into highres section plz
,Slimline9,2011-06-21T22:46Z,"I actively steer away from your torrents froggie. Why? coz you incorrectly label your uploads. A TS is a cam and should be in the Movies section - NOT the hi-res section, and that's irrespective of wether or not a hi-def cam was used. Also the hi-res rips that you do put out largely suck. Have a look at a decent upload sometime. Neonrainbow, Rajmahal, The Great Magician. These are all people who put out great quality releases and NEVER mislabel. Think about it please"
,avatarjokumo,2011-06-22T03:18Z,"@ deadwetdog:
this torrent wasn't hard to find at all.  just type in Super 8 and it's there.  and the title isn't misleading if you know how to read it.  the big ""TS"" is a dead give away to anyone who can read.  It means telesync btw.  so quit your bitching and whining and hating on a VIP because you don't agree with how he labelled his torrent.  you can upload it yourself if you want a better copy."
,yellowboy06,2011-06-23T03:07Z,This is garbage. Its the old ass one that came out a long time ago. Plus its not HD
,Schmauges,2011-06-24T00:41Z,"This is wachable BUT should not be in HD I del. it waiting for a better copy.

,Polant,2011-06-24T09:03Z,"Certainly not HD, just High Res.  Still watchable at least."
,SolaceG,2011-06-24T19:34Z,"Yeah, thank you for taking the time to upload, but their is no such thing as a hi-def tele-sync mate, this is mislabeled and in the wrong category. "
,suiggy,2011-06-25T05:11Z,"poor quality
video sucks...."
,keyarchan,2011-06-25T11:53Z,"@SD_rocks, that logic doesn't make any sense. Filming a movie with a High-res camera does not make it High-res.
With your thinking I could film a regular dvd with a High-res camera and call it High-res. If you don't see anything wrrong with that then you're just a moron."
,kinvore,2011-06-26T07:44Z,"I don't care how high res the cam, it's still a cam.  The highres section should be for Blu Ray (or eventually better) media rips that are 720+ only.

That being said I'm sure this is a good cam.  I just won't know because I'm not going to share something that's mislabeled."
,Armstrong14,2011-06-27T03:21Z,"The reason he has it in High Res is because it was shot using a 720p camera in the theatre, Technically, it's located in the right spot... In reality, it was most likely filmed on an iPod 4 with 720p video that was set in a cup holder. Can't knock something that's free, though!"
,Th3z0d14c,2011-06-28T18:21Z,"Apparently a lot of you don't understand the difference between high res and high def, high res simply means how many pixels there are, it doesn't equate high def, high def is the quality of the video. Since it is 720p, it is technically high res, but it doesn't claim to be high def.

now @keyarchan, of course it would, it just wouldn't make it high def, high res â  high def. 

You do have to have high res to be a true high def, but you don't have to have high def to be a true high res, do you guys get it now?"
,daandejonge,2011-06-30T18:08Z,this sucks..

,rahulpear,2011-07-09T10:41Z,can someone plz upload some screens too... thanks for upld froggie
,Apxika,2011-07-14T04:37Z,"Guys relax. This falls under the correct category due to the fact that it is High resolution (1280x544). You don't have to like it to accept it, nor disrespect the uploader for going out of his way to put up some entertainment for you. Just thank him if you're going to bother commenting. Next time just browse through the torrents and make sure you avoid TS titles and you'll be satisfied like me :D"
,nnavish,2011-07-15T17:20Z,When are the DVD rip coming?
,doser69,2011-07-17T03:50Z,"RAR's missing

720p for some stupid reason

2.42GB for a CAM that should be 600-740MB.

Stupid."
,jsmoot,2011-07-17T23:20Z,"Well, while i agree with you about the resolution to definition difference, i still do NOT think this belongs here. In my opinion, anything under 720I/P should NOT be placed in high resolution simply for the fact that when people like us look for hi res movies we are getting just that. Also, when most people click hi res they are thinking hi def, so i would say this needs to be moved to just the movies cat. and does NOT need to be listed under hi res just because its more than 480 does not place it in this cat....."
,NYTropix22,2011-07-17T23:21Z,THANK YOU for taking your time and energy to upload this for us. 
,G3n3tiX,2011-07-18T16:05Z,"Well the obvious solution is to make a Hi-Res CAM cat. 

Too many of you are too stupid to know the difference between Hi-Def and Hi-Res. 

And it would greatly help me finding exactly this type of CAM, because all other LOW-RES CAMS can eat my dick.

Thanks for the upload froggie and thanks for correctly labeling it too, much appreciated. To all the rest, well, you know where you can go."
,hurka79,2011-07-20T09:23Z,Delete this shit please!

Should NOT be in the high res catagory....  fair enough that u put 'TS' in the title, but thats just not high res!!

Thats like filming the new x-men on my android phone in the cinema, THEN filming the movie playing on my phone in true 1080p high def, AND calling that video high res!!!  RETARDED!!!!"

,catalyst101,2011-08-12T00:49Z,"Strongly agree on this one. This isn't 720p and you feel a sting of disapointment when you first see this hyped movie in the highres section only to see the ""TS"" in the torrents name... 
It makes the highres category loose a bit of it's purpose"
,Vegasbob,2011-08-12T08:43Z,For gods sake could some admin start deleting this GARBAGE from the HiRes section? JUST BECAUSE YOU RECORD SHIT ON A HD VIDEOCAM DOSENT MAKE IT IN ANY WAY LOOK HD TO A NORMAL HUMAN BEING. Dear god this section has become polluted with this crap. 
,jsmoot,2011-08-14T02:10Z,"OK, this section is not about HiDef movies, it is about Hires movies. Anything higher than 480p is considered hires to me. The resolution on this video is 1280 x 544, so its higher than 480 which puts it in the correct category.....while i understand what you are coming from and usually you would think, if simple minded that is, that hi res would mean spectacular quality as well. Hi Res does not mean better quality only supported to show on a bigger screen without pixels showing ;)"
,baracas,2011-08-14T20:57Z,This guy really need to stop putting his crappy cams in this section.  He does it all the time on all kinds of cams.  Tubeplus movies look better then some of his crap.  Maybe piratebay can add a seperate section for POS cams.
