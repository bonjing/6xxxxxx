,pirate_0,2012-03-04T12:49Z,Can you Please seed? I have seen your comments on the other rips & 10gigs is a bit too much for a lot of us.You have yours about in the mid section.But this is very painful.The seeding is all over the shop & hopefully it will get better.Once I have loaded I will seed for as long as I can.I'll get back to you after I have watched the movie. Cheers ;-)
