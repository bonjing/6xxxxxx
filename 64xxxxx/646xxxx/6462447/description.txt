Hello Everyone!

This is a minecraft Ingame editor, you can give yourself the stuff etc.
just by opening your inventory!


IINSTAL INSTRUCTIONS!!


Go to \"run\" at start menu
Type there: %appdata%
a folder appears called roaming or something.
go to your minecraft folder ( .minecraft )
search for the \"minecraft.jar\" file and open it with WinRar
First delete the META-INF folder! (dont forget this or the mod wont work!)
than just drag all the  .class files into the folder


Just start minecraft and open your inventory!



In case your minecraft does not start, or stays at black screen.
Update minecraft solves the problem and removes the mod.
