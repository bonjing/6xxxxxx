This book provides guidance for the development of highway contract specifications and is intended to complement the LRFD specifications for major structures and bridges. This Ninth Edition includes several new sections: Sections 312 through 315 address additional base course options; Sections 716 through 718 address materials requirements for aluminum, timber, and ground anchors; and Appendixes A and B provide sample technical provisions and considerations for use with innovative contracting methods and pavement ride quality measurement. This update of the 1998 Edition expands the number of cross-references and provides uniformity of nomenclature, materials, construction requirements, and methods of measurement and payment.
