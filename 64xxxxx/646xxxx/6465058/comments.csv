[V],joshua13,2011-06-13T19:15Z,"it's ""tar""  = tape archive (ancient name). primarily used on unix systems

winrar and others on windows should handle it. Macs can use stuffit expander, unarchiver, or good old unix from the terminal among others

zip and rar are easily done from unix systems so their is really no need for using gzip, tar, and the like."

,1938mpr,2011-06-15T15:26Z,"I'm with the other comments, you can use folders to cut the photos up into manageable pieces of say 100Mb.  1.4Gb is a lot of bandwidth to waste if the collection is not good!!"
