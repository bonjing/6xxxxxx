 i just installed program. I used instruction to registered and update. At startup program ask me about update  and some else (sorry i forgot what is). Do i should click yes and connect to the website (for update - i think, and something else)?"
,sharealike54,2011-08-16T16:17Z,"Sorry, but I installed this so long ago I forgot exactly what the installation sequence was.  I think you register with the crack online, but I'm not sure if your update is a patch, or whether or not the patch is denied, or if the program is trying to sell you the next higher version.  Try it, it won't mess you up permanently.  You can always reinstall the program.  In fact, it is so buggy that you'll probably have to reinstall from time to time.  Still, it's a very useful piece of software."
