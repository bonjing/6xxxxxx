,mr.eclectic,2011-06-24T00:25Z,hi there....FYI..there is no audio on disc 8...No idea what happened...Will try a 2nd DL of the disc....Tnx for a great upload!!!
,mr.eclectic,2011-06-25T07:17Z,With regard to the above: I figured out what went wrong....The music was DL'ed....Windows just didn't see it...apparently in folders too far from the root(.C) All fixed now!! It is a great set.
