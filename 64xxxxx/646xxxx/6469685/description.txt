Plot
Helmed by Justin Lin, the hit franchise's third installment finds street-racer Shaun Boswell (Lucas Black) moving to Tokyo, where he's been dispatched by his concerned family members who want to keep him out of lockup. Boswell soon hooks up with a fellow American who introduces him to drift racing -- a fusion of bracing speed and lethal courses -- and ventures into the underworld to pay a debt to yakuza-connected D.K. (Brian Tee).
