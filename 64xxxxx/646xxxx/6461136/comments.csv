,Doc.Strange,2011-06-12T04:03Z,very very nice
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-12T08:49Z,"@zhekazlo,
I'm uploading all day long at 2 MB/s.

@Doc.Strange,
yeah, there is only one .exe file, nothing else can be opened :O"
,Doc.Strange,2011-06-12T18:11Z,"I know, but oddly enough, some people give negative vote simply by failing to install because they do not know."
,AMoveFan,2011-06-12T23:52Z,Thanks for this I guess I just have to wait for a working crack to come out now because non of the cracks that are out now work lol and I wish all games by steam could be uploaded like this good job for not having to send us through steam .
,idunno455,2011-06-13T17:36Z,I have this working but if i exit out of it i have to start a new campaign is there a way of fixing this.
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-13T18:09Z,"@idunno455, looks like you installed something else on this game, because I've finished it today without any troubles. Any saves work at any time... Very strange."
,AMoveFan,2011-06-13T23:29Z,idunno455 did you get this one or did you crack steam and download it from Steam and if not through Steam which crack did you use to get this game to work i havent found any yet that'll work for it .
,scnee,2011-06-16T17:20Z,"I have the same problem as idunno455, it WAS this torrent it was D/L from. i just cant resume where i left off. maybe i will try a different cracked game."
,scnee,2011-06-16T17:33Z,"okie dokie, i have been having this no save problem, all i did was run as admin. (even tho i am on my system(this seems not to matter)) anyhow hope this fixes ur prob, idunno. running this w/o running as admin seems to not put any save files in your system file. "
,scnee,2011-06-16T20:12Z,^^ system folder^^
,aDyerSituation,2011-06-24T06:40Z,So can someone help me? This isn't for steam is it? Becaues I don't want to get banned...thanks!
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-28T08:49Z,"@aDyerSituation,
You will not get banned. To play the game you must run it, while Steam is NOT running. Or the game won't even load :)"
,iLegacy,2011-07-01T22:05Z,"Hey Night, I have a problem with this game. When I'm playing the game I get these huge lag spikes that last 5-10 min and I can't do anything. Do you know any fixes? "
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-07-03T18:28Z,"@iLegacy,
If you use AMD processors, install AMD Dual Core Optimizer from ""redist"" folder.
If nothing helps, back up your saves and install this:
narod[.]yandex[.]ru/ disk/ 15745799001/ DoubleCrack%2BLauncher.7z"
,DP131,2011-07-06T11:36Z,"It's saying ""The application was unable to start correctly (0xc01500002)."" What should I do?"
,Fl0h,2011-07-15T20:37Z,"I've got the same problem as DP131 has!
Does anyone know what to do?"
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-07-21T11:06Z,Read the comments. Install redists.

,holyslayer123,2011-08-29T04:12Z,"Hey NiGHt-LEshiY  i have a request and a challeng for you. I want to see if you can or are able to get Fallout New Vegas to let us download. preferabbly in english please and the instructions on downloading it too. I've seen a lot of different versions of this game but all are either RIP CRACK or SKIDROW and i was wondering if you ""the best i've ever seen"" could be able to succeed in getting the game to become a download then play game. I really hope you will accept this challenge and let a lot of people on this site enjoy what is one of the best games yet."
,holyslayer123,2011-08-29T04:14Z,night- can you get fallout new vegas to be able for us to download. This will be a challenge. please in english tooooooooo. i hope you are able to do this
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-09-02T20:47Z,I'm just a download maker and seeder. But I'll contact our no-steam pirate and ask him for help %)
,Dnukem,2011-09-06T14:21Z,"Hey im a bit new here, and im stuck, ive downloaded it and installed it, but everytime i try to launch the game, it come up with 
'This application has failed to start because d3dx9_37.dll could not be found' 
Im sure ive missed something  out because for everyone else its working, so if someone could point out to me what i need to do, thatd be great, thanx"
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-09-09T20:38Z,"@Dnukem,
> d3dx9_37.dll
Looks like you don't have DirectX installed."
