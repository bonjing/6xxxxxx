Product Description: 
The term "capacity building" refers to enabling the indigenous people of developing countries to carry out development processes successfully by empowering them through strengthened domestic institutions, provision of domestic markets, and improvement of local government efforts to sustain infrastructures, social institutions, and commercial institutions. Capacity building also involves the need to recognize indigenous interest groups, encourage local efforts, provide incentives for privatization, and coordinate local, regional, and international strategies to enhance productivity and wise use of natural and human resources. Most important, capacity building encourages a "bottom-up" or grassroots effort for sustainable development. The grassroots effort begins with the family unit. Capacity building addresses all areas of social, economic and health, and environmental processes through a holistic approach. The chapters of this book, written by experts in their fields, address these three areas of the developing societies.
