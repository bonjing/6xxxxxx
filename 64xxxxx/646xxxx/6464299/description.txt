BOOK INFO:

Every action in SQL Server - queries, updates, whatever - leaves a set of tiny footprints; SQL Server records all that valuable data and makes it visible through Dynamic Management Views, or DMVs. A DBA or developer can use this incredibly detailed information to significantly improve the performance of queries and better understand what's really going on inside a SQL Server system

SQL Server DMVs in Action is a practical guide that shows how to obtain, interpret, and act on the information captured by DMVs to keep SQL Server in top shape. The 100+ samples provided in this book will help readers master DMVs and also give them a tested, working, and instantly reusable SQL code library.
