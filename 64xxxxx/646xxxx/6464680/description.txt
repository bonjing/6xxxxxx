BOOK INFO:

Rabbi Hugo Gryn was born in the Carpathian town of Berehovo in 1930 and deported to Auschwitz at the age of thirteen. He was rabbi at the West London Synagogue for thirty-two years, but was perhaps best known for his 'ministry of the airwaves', particularly as a regular panelist on the BBC's Moral Maze.Hugo's gentle humour and compassion, his deep spirituality and unquenchable faith in humanity made a lasting impression on listeners and endeared him to millions. This collection of his radio scripts will delight admirers and bring inspiration to a new generation in what would have been his 80th birthday year.Naomi Gryn is a writer and documentary filmmaker. She co-authored and edited her father's posthumous memoir, Chasing Shadows (Viking, 2000).
