,Celtic420,2011-06-16T06:51Z,"don't bother guys...this episode is with J.J. Abrams --- from June 14th. It's labeled incorrectly; I downloaded it twice now, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake."
,Celtic420,2011-06-16T06:55Z,My comment was deleted for some reason...but this is NOT the episode with Alex PrudHomme. I got mad respect for you VTV -- I've downloaded many from you before. I assumed this was just a mistake...but facts are facts - this is not the episode with Alex PrudHomme....I'm just being an honest TPB user here...
,Celtic420,2011-06-16T06:56Z,nevermind @ my last comment....website just bugged out on me. comment wasn't deleted at all ^^
