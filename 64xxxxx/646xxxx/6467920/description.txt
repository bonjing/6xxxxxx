***Uploaders Note*** - This remarkable boxed set of over 85 films was released in 2009 by the United States National Archives. It consists of wartime footage, movie newsreels, and propaganda films made from World War I through the Vietnam Conflict. No subtitles are available. Furthermore, the majority of the DVDs were produced so that it was not possible to fully separate the films with normal ripping software. Therefore, many of the disks had to be ripped as one long AVI file; some containing multiple films. I have ripped every disk to the highest resolution possible, with an average bit pixel ratio of 1.50. I would have liked to have released it all as one huge torrent (I still might if the demand is high enough), but after all this work, I really do not want this to die an unseeded death, so I have decided to release it in 6 batches to keep the size down. The DVDs contained no special features of any kind. Several of these films were either nominated or even won Academy Awards back in the day, and are not commercially available in any other venue I am aware of. For each torrent, I will include the screenshots and technical stats for one representative film.
