,AloneInDaDark,2011-06-13T22:14Z,"devilking & Dr.Sinister
fuck yall assholes"
,Fatfox,2011-06-13T22:14Z,"There are never, ever any trojans on eztv's torrents - that's why he has a green skull and a huge following.

There have, however, been a few instances where the MAGNET LINK has been to a different file (why use the magnet link anyway?) - eztv's files are straight .avi - never a .rar or anything else - so if

a) You sue the Magnet Link, and
b) it's not a .avi file, then DON'T DOWNLOAD IT.

Not rocket science.

Thanks eztv for the up - btw love the fact you put up the BBC series Psychoville - awesome!"
,CroPro100,2011-06-13T23:28Z,"WTF, WHY DID STARK DIE ,  WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED ????"

,tha_roo,2011-06-14T07:06Z,@devilking what are you bloody doing thanks for wrecking all the episodes leading up to that
,Ranilin,2011-06-14T07:43Z,"While I have to say spoilers are effing annoying, this show is based on a book series where nobody is safe! Do NOT read comments. If it isn't uploaded by eztv, don't get it, and no matter who uploaded it, don't read comments.

In George R. R. Martin's books.. nobody is safe. Avoid the comments if you haven't read the books so you don't spoil anything. Anyone and everyone can and may die, no matter how much you like them."
,bak13,2011-06-14T11:35Z,"com'on guys,there is no way that the main protagonist is off,he is the first name.no way,smt must have happened,i dont know deus ex machina or smth..

,devilking,2011-06-14T13:33Z,"I'm very sorry about my ""spoiler"" i was just too angry about the episode, besides i don't usually read comments before watching the episode, didnt though about other people doing so. 

I'm sorry for all the people who got the episode ruined by my comment.

Cheers"
,KD5EEJ350,2011-06-14T16:32Z,"I use CTRL+F and search the page for ""fake"" before downloading a show, I never read the comments because there will always be some one trying to spoil it.

Even now, I have already watched the show and only now read the comments."

,immugio,2011-06-16T09:01Z,"half the characters in the book die eventually through the series, so don't read comments cuz some e-tard is going to post something about it. i was going to post a list of all the characters that die, but i couldn't find one. I will say that my favorite character, tyrion, is still alive, at least until the next book. cheers."
