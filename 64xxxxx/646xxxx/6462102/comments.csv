[T],houruoha,2011-06-16T15:44Z,"@pruny
trying some new stuff out?
like uploading files to my webhost... hotlink it.. burn the torrent and voila you have 24+mbps 24/7 forever live torrent 
unluckily my hosting provider thought thats was a bad idea as the bandwidth is reaching sky high like 387gb on two continuous days and deleted all of my files zip,mkv,mp4s... Plus even my html,php,js everything now i have to start from scratch  though this is just an expirement but im hoping it will try to mastered it? btw if you have any premium account which support hotlink let me know... trying with fileden.. but its only 50+mb perfile and 5gb bandwidth "

its very simple if you are on windows 7 or any versions of windows you can right click on the zip files and extract to any folder you preferred
else you can also download 7zip,winrar,unzip the procedure is all the same as above
