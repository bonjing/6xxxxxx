Didn't notice any sync problems on this repack version, if there is it must be less than 0.01's out and that's good enough for me... 
Many Thanx to extremezone and IMAGiNE for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"

,billygoat71,2011-06-14T20:23Z,"V-10 A-10 M-4.5 good rip, movie is cheaply made. A good story, but can tell there was no money put into the production"
,tai69,2011-06-15T01:46Z,"AUDIO OUT OF SYNC
the audio is out of sync at different rates throughout the movie. I tried to fix it by setting the audio at -200ms - this makes some parts of the movie in sync, but other parts are out of sync. "
,tambu90,2011-06-15T02:33Z,thanks men it looks good
,feartruth,2011-06-15T10:34Z,"Hi extremezone,

Thanks for sharing such great movies.

Can you upload the DVDRip/BRRip/BDRip of the following (or any of the following) movies WITH English subs (soft subs preferred, but hard subs will also be fine if no soft subs are available)?

1] Biutiful - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1164999/

2] A-i-deul... (aka Children...) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1861982/

3] Insidious - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/

4] The Lincoln Lawyer

I'll be very grateful if you can do any of them, especially A-i-deul... (Sorry for repeating, but if it's possible for you to fulfill my request, please see to it that the Rip includes English subs.) Hope you can. Even if you can't, thanks and cheers."

,redactedwv,2011-06-16T22:15Z,Anyone have a definitive take on the sync w/ this repack ver? 
,Lord-Red,2011-06-16T22:31Z,"Gonna ask a silly question with a repack. it downloads 117 files in music. Don't know what to do with this.  is there something you have to do, like organize or compress.

New to this , still getting top grips.

Will say thanks for all your up-loads one of the best around"
,redactedwv,2011-06-16T22:45Z,"@ Lord Red: 'Repack', in this instance, isn't relevant to your question. There was a problem with the audio sync, and EZ has upped this ver to address it (i'm assuming) - thus the 'repack' addition to the file name. The reason there are 117 files is because - oddly - it was compressed with winRAR. 

Get WinRAR (shareware, technically i think, but you can keep on using it - or get a crack). Install it. Click on the first file listed when you open the AoH folder. Choose your destination, and winRAR will take it from there.

And, while EZ is a trusted user with a long track record, and someone almost certainly would have already mentioned it if there were a problem, you need to get in the habit of scanning RARs before/after opening them (as with anything) to prevent infection."
,redactedwv,2011-06-17T06:28Z,"Seeder count is dropping, so i guess that tends to support the 'still out of sync' comments, i s'pose. "
,Lord-Red,2011-06-17T08:54Z,"Thanks for the info reactedwv, i can sleep a little better now.

Good film thanks ex "

[V],neil1966hardy,2011-06-17T21:53Z,"Perfect!   Not out of sync.

Ignore the lying bastard who says it is!

A: 10  V: 10"
,redactedwv,2011-06-19T20:37Z,"Just thought i'd confirm:

neil1966hardy and EZ are absolutely correct... Sync is just fine.

THERE ARE NO SYNC PROBLEMS WITH THIS REPACK

Thanks again, EZ - Good file. Good movie too (thought the end was a little abrupt, but still a good flick)!

Will seed to 10"
