- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  The fourth studio album from Frank Turner, one of the greatest
  singer/songwriters out there at the moment. This record also features the
  keyboardist from The Hold Steady, Franz Nicolay, who also played on The Loved
  Ones and some other records. This is an absolutely incredible record that you
  should really buy this Tuesday.

  FNT: 9 years and nearly 10,000 rips later, and this is still so much fun!
