You fit all their source code in 14.82 MiB? Either I'm way behind the times regarding compression or Bethesda isn't working very hard."

,Bitmaster,2011-06-14T22:53Z,"Argh, blaring contradiction. On the one hand, obviously people with at least _some_ hacking skills. On the other hand... Fucking RAR. No one with skill enough to know the gritty details about various things would ever choose RAR for anything. So... What gives, LulzSec? Sarcasm?"
,MisterCats,2011-06-15T00:43Z,I'm pretty certain that no one cares if it's a zip or a rar (or even a jar!)
,ratchet1106,2011-06-15T01:25Z,You guys are douchebags. Forcing companies to put an extra million dollars into security isn't going to speed up shit. If anything you've slowed down the production of the game and now they're going to devote resources from the game into security. You guys are not funny; you're the douchebags of the interweb.
,Axisround,2011-06-15T07:27Z,"You guys don't get it.

If you think these guys are the douchebags of the internet.....just remember that you are a registered user of TPB (since you posted a comment)...as am i.  Who is a bigger douchebag: A guy that steals things or a guy that steals things? 

In either circumstance, it (almost) the same. You click and steal things.......these guys use their knowledge to steal things. 

You are a shoplifter and these guys are Chris Shiherlis.  Shut the fuck up, you are worthless compared to these trailblazers.

Lulz: I just wanted to say that I admire the work you guys have put into this - It is truly entertaining.  The succinct appearances of Wiki's is the best part"
,RafeeqQC,2011-06-15T07:40Z,"Well, all I can say is... wtf ?

Just aim the bad guys, the big guys or videogame industry like EA and Activision."

Copyright infringement is NOT stealing.

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copyright+infringement

""a violation of the rights secured by a copyright""

It is an infringement on the right of the content creator - or license holder of the copyrighted item - to make as many or as few copies of their work as they wish.

Stealing is to take a piece of property, depriving the content creator - or license holder of the copyrighted item - access to or possession of the item(s) in question (such as stealing a motor vehicle, which deprives the owner access to and possession of the vehicle).

Since items copied from users of this website does not deprive the content creator - or license holder of the copyrighted item - access to the original product/source code or in the case of photos of painted art works (etc.) access to the physical property, it is therefore not stealing.

Further, I strongly advise that in future you be more careful what you accuse other people of across the net as you may leave yourself open to charges of defamation.

That aside; while I do not condone the alleged illegal actions of LulzSec, I do however thank them for making a stand for internet users against oppressive governments and organizations while also encouraging such 'targets' to practice better security while in possession of personal data entrusted to them by the general public."
,azisco,2011-06-16T01:30Z,You should balance out your karma by hacking Activision and leaking the username+password of every stupid fuck who bought the CoD DLC. That would be great.
,KidD34TH,2011-06-16T12:19Z,All that hard work and no source to make a Brink keygen? :(
,Skrill4Lyfe,2011-06-16T12:34Z,"Seriously people, lulzsec can barely be called ""hackers'. They use exposed security to... copy files? Seriously? All that smack talk and all they can do is copy some files? As far as the DDoS attacks, anyone google up a program to do that on their own. It's nothing fancy and/or special.

Until they do something to do some SERIOUS damage, say.. wiping the US stock exchange mid-business﻿ day, this is just like watching a magician pull the same rabbit repeatedly out of a different colored hat."
,dragnet53,2011-06-17T17:13Z,Please Lulzsec take down RIAA and MPA. Also would be nice to delete all the elite bank accounts like the rothschild's and Rockefeller's....great job!
,jowjowjow,2011-06-19T11:50Z,ahh... script kiddies. How 'bout hack BILDERBERG those guys who think they can control our world? I am pretty sure we get better stuff from them then WikiLeaks got from the US internal cables.
,micnor14,2011-06-21T07:39Z,"@ratchet1106

Agreed. Lulzsec is going to put a lot of people out of jobs and even more people aren't going to get those big games now because of the redistributed resources of their ""targets"". Lulzsec could always take the more peaceful side of vigilantism, and cut the sadistic ""mayhem and chaos"" bullshit.

Dox everywhere: LulzSec under attack from hackers, law enforcement.

Hacking group Lulz Security has found itself coming under attack from all angles, drawing unwanted attention from both law enforcement and other hackers groups. Though the group's antics have won it many fans who appreciate LulzSec's anti-establishment leanings, they've also earned plenty of enemies, and those enemies have started to fight back. So far, they've posted LulzSec's ""dox""â€”the names, pictures, and addresses of the people claimed to be the ringleaders of the group.

Since LulzSec first gained prominence, pro-US hacker th3j35t3r (""The Jester"") has worked to uncover their identities and embarrass them. th3j35t3r, who has made a name for himself by knocking pro-jihad Web sites offline, has butted heads with Anonymous in the past, opposing the faceless collective's support for WikiLeaks. He worked to disrupt the activities of the AnonOps factionâ€”taking servers offline and revealing names of the participants. Since many of AnonOps' key players moving on to form LulzSec, th3j35t3r's focus has shifted accordingly.

th3j35t3r is staunchly pro-establishment, regarding the LulzSec Distributed Denial of Service attacks on the CIA Web site as terrorism, LulzSec members as bullies, and those who have suffered from LulzSec's antics as victims.

Another group claiming to side with LulzSec's victims and oppose LulzSec's campaign against security organizations are ""Web Ninjas"". Web Ninjas have posted chat logs and dox of a number of alleged LulzSec members.

LulzSec has also been taking heat from the anti-establishment side of the fence, represented by TeaMp0isoN_. TeaMp0isoN_ members don't care about the victims, don't deny their blackhat status, and don't like law enforcement or security companies. Instead, they're motivated by disdain for LulzSec's methods and public profileâ€”they think that LulzSec are ""scene fags."" LulzSec's tools have been simple SQL injection and Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities, and botnet-powered Distributed Denial of Service attacks: in TeaMp0isoN_'s view, this is not enough to earn the label hacker.

Beyond publishing information about LulzSec team members, TeaMp0isoN_ defaced the Web site of LulzSec and AnonOps participant joepie91. joepie91's relationship with LulzSec and AnonOps has long been something of an oddity; he's open about his participation in the groups, but continues to argue that he does nothing more than talk, and takes no active role in these groups' illegal activities. Whether active or passive, TeaMp0isoN_ plainly regard him as fair game, and doxed him on Twitter.

Meanwhile, LulzSec has been doing some doxing of its own. In the immediate wake of the arrest of British teenager Ryan Cleary, LulzSec claimed he had nothing to do with their group, that position was later softened, with the acknowledgement that Cleary operated an IRC server that LulzSec uses. Claiming that ""snitches get stitches"", LulzSec then doxed a coupled of individuals whose leaks of private chat logs and other incriminating data apparently led to Cleary's arrest.

Law enforcement agencies aren't standing still, either. After his arrest on Monday night, British teenager Ryan Cleary has been charged by police with creating and operating a botnet and performing Distributed Denial of Service attacks against the Web sites of the Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA, the UK's closest counterpart to the FBI), the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). He faces a custody hearing tomorrow morning.

For the time being, LulzSec appears to be shrugging off the attacks, continuing to laugh, at least in public, at its accusers. The group promises that it will be publishing more stolen documents on Friday: the first fruit from its ""Anti-Security"" venture, in which it has sought to attack and embarrass computer security companies and law enforcement agencies."
