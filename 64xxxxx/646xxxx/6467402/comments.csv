C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\My The Lord of the Rings, The Rise of the Witch-king Files""

Does not exist on my Win 7 laptop"
,Esfirius,2011-07-08T20:02Z,"Okay Solved it:
If the Appdata folder does not exist, then launch the game first, quit it, and the folder will be there
----------------------------------------------
Also, ig you keep on getting the ""game.dat"" error -
1) right click the game icon
2) choose properties
3)go to ""compatability"" tab
4) tick the ""WIndows XP SP2""
5) click apply
6) enjoy the game!

It created the icon and application to uninstalled the mod in the game directory but there is no application to start the game with the mod and starting the game normally does not use the mod.
,Millor1,2011-07-31T07:48Z,Found it... I had to use the search on my computer to find it because it put the shortcut in a crazy location I never use

,Stvmeister,2012-01-03T13:49Z,I'm unable to install the game as it is asking for me to please insert the cd/dvd. Its probably something simple but I couldn't find a way around. Any Ideas?
,swaggerdon,2012-01-04T14:23Z,"use Daemon tools to mount the game. This acts as a virtual drive, fooling the computer into thinking that a disk is present."

,Sarge Is,2012-04-29T11:47Z,"!!!-UPLOADER COMMENT-!!!__!!!-IMPORTANT-!!!

I have noticed a few issues regarding ""LAN/ONLINE Play"" and ""Installing"". I figured out why and how to fix it.

NEW INSTALL NOTES!
1. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT crack with the game.dat file if you want to be able to play LAN or Online. 
Changing the game.dat file changes the game version to a unique number. This is EA's doing to prevent pirating and cheating.
THIS MEANS, Don't install the ""Install LoTR Update and Fix"" DONT INSTALL.
You must google for the 1.06 Update and just find the Patch. Mine includes the crack which is NOT, what you want.

2. You can follow my Install instructions to the letter for both BFME2 and ROTLK to the letter EXCEPT cracking with game.dat, you must use a different crack to play online.

3. Search on google for Battle for Middle Earth 2 no-dvd or image crack. Ofcourse UPDATE the game. 
This crack works as a Virtual CD so the game verifies that you put the CD in.
Why this crack is not used so much is because when un-rar'd it's about 5gb in size. Don't worry, the compact downloaded file you download is only a few KB big."

,Sarge Is,2012-04-29T11:51Z,"Omg... Pirate bay is so slow...

Ok after this comment!"
,Sarge Is,2012-05-08T10:55Z,"3. Search on google for Battle for Middle Earth 2 no-dvd or image crack. Ofcourse UPDATE the game. 
This crack works as a Virtual CD so the game verifies that you put the CD in.
Why this crack is not used so much is because when un-rar'd it's about 5gb in size. Don't worry, the compact downloaded file you download is only a few KB big.

If you don't find the MAP folder don't worry. I mistakenly said you should Copy Paste this file but it is not needed. The important file is the Options.ini file. This File needs to be there and for some reason for some computers it doesn't create the file which gives you the Crash or No Responding error at start-up.

SO, if you follow these instructions that simply are:
* Download image no dvd crack, mount with daemon tools,
* Make sure you have the options.ini file at the correct location,
* NOT replaced the original game.dat with the cracked game.dat. IGNORE THIS CRACK.
* For BFME2, do NOT use ""Install LoTR Update and Fix"", instead google and download the 1.06 patch.
*The patch I included for ROTLK is just the patch so you can use this one."
