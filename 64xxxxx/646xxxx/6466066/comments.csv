,kaalisss,2011-06-13T20:36Z,This release has Boot.Tidserv in it?
,TunaKing,2011-06-14T04:57Z,"Didn't work for me.

When i mounted the iso it looked like it was gonna install (skidrow instructions came up) but then i got a blue screen with ""STOP: c0000c3d Unknown error"" on it, then my computer rebooted and i'm back to normal. Same thing happens everytime i mount the image.

Anyone got any ideas?"
,kugutsumin,2011-06-14T14:16Z,"i have an idea, don't dl this shit, it does have Boot.Tidserv!"
,Grimmace666,2011-06-14T19:58Z,"usually skidrow doesnt have viruses in his rips....maybe something happened, he'll just have to recheck it O.o"
,Jewfro1337,2011-06-15T16:42Z,Virus on Avast
,Jewfro1337,2011-06-15T16:42Z,"To clarify I meant, This is a Virus as detected by Avast"
,fatninja4,2011-06-15T17:39Z,"Yeah, downloaded this and had a warning from MSE saying it was an Obfuscator.PN virus, but I've had false positives like that before. Tried to install and my screen went black, then my whole fucking computer died. Had to jump through hoops to get Windows to reinstall, it was a bitch. Do yourself a favor and stay away. No hard feelings against SKIDROW though, as they weren't the ones who threw the virus in"
,weirdwars,2011-06-20T10:58Z,I can't find any uninstaller... any ideas?
,topec,2011-06-22T00:22Z,can't find an uninstaller either.
,gios,2011-06-23T13:57Z,"VIRUS trojan in system\bughandler.dll
and no unistaller.
SKIDROW THAT IS NO GOED!!!"
,nenaddorcol,2011-06-23T14:50Z,"I can confirm that this torrent is infated with trojan-bacdoor and  spywire. Auto instll virus in rootkit, Windows register HKEY_CURENT_USER->Volatile Environment and System; HEY_LOCAL_MACHINE->SYSTEM, Windows sistem Directoy, System Volume Information, Users->(pc Username)->app Data-> Local->Temp; 
Dont install this."
