,mtjoeng,2011-06-12T20:24Z,this one has the full subs?
,QborT,2011-06-13T02:55Z,"mtjoeng -  Probably not, it says the source is the ViSiON rip and that didn't have proper subs.

But I can't say for certain, I just know that the Japanese version was not released with subs.  So unless this has some fansubs it will be incomplete."
,helluvagood,2011-06-15T08:46Z,"read the description guys.. its there for a reason.
""Subtitles: Hard Encoded English subs""
and there's a sample as well"
,QborT,2011-06-16T00:05Z,"helluvagood I realize that it says the subs are hardcoded.  But what was the source of those subs?

The Japanese release never came with English subs.  So what release groups have done is re-timed the subs from the shorter international release to fit this Japanese longer release.  The problem is then there are about 18 minutes with of film with NO subs.  And there in lies the problem."
,helluvagood,2011-06-16T01:09Z,"ok you're right, some parts of the movies just have no subs.. such a shame. I will have to look for another torrent of this now"
,gaaraisgod,2011-07-12T19:05Z,"Apparently, the subs linked below work for the release: 
13.Assassins.2010.480p.BDRip.XviD.AC3.D-Z0N3"
