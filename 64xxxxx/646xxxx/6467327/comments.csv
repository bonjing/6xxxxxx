,pourable,2011-06-14T05:11Z,"A-5
V-8

for a cam, the only downer is the audio cuz it's pretty crappy. timing is on but it's just really tinny, I don't mind the cammer with the munchies lol. There's epic scenes in this movie and good sound is crucial. Thanks for the upload though it is much appreciated!"
,markmc01,2011-06-14T05:22Z,"HEY FAGGOT, THANKS FOR EATING YOUR FUCKING CHIPS RIGHT NEXT TO THE GODDAMN CAMERA, YOU HOMO. NEXT TIME DON'T DO THAT!!

,maverickman-fan,2011-06-14T17:26Z,"Definitely a much better cam, thanks. I got the first one but didn't tried watching it. Thanks!"
,Delusional78,2011-06-14T19:04Z,"Wow.... I really want to find the asshole who made this and smack him in the face with a brick. If I wanted to listen to some fat fucking piece of shit chew on popcorn every five seconds I would have paid the twenty bucks and sat next to you! 

Great picture, but you're better off waiting for a better copy.... The audio was fine until fatty had to eat next to the camera for the entire film. "
,Grzegrzolka40,2011-06-14T20:06Z,"video 7. audio 5. (for a cam). 

personally - its fucking ridicilous how long this guy, filming a movie, is eating a popcorn. he knows that it would go on the torrents. seriously, its INSANE how long this dude EATS watching this movie. omg. im 100%  sure he's american. 

ps. fuck you dude. "
,Grzegrzolka40,2011-06-14T20:24Z,"good torrent, medicore movie, death wish for the guy filming it. "
,hispeed86,2011-06-14T23:46Z,"FAKE! it's not ""Super 8""! it's ""The Sounds of Super Annoying Popcorn Eating Guy""!"
,Irlydont,2011-06-15T07:16Z,"YES V-8 and A-2 
WHY 2?  I HEAR YOU EAT YOUR POPCORN MORE THAN THE SCRIPT#%#@%%@#%

,Irlydont,2011-06-15T07:18Z,"5:28 MINUTES !! Can't wait that this ripper finish to eat HIS GOD DAMN POP CORN.

Time to remux without the popcorn voice..."
,Irlydont,2011-06-15T07:21Z,Hope you choke on your pop corn -.-

,seeloa81,2011-06-15T07:54Z,"picture and audio quality is very good, but for me the picture occasionally slows downa bit, im not sure if its the file or something in my configuration but this is the only file i have ever seen it happen. But the hardcoded subs are fuckin awful...whoever made them had zero understanding of the english language...its basically a word for word translation using google translate...90% of it makes no sense - and since you cant get rid of em, id suggest gettin another copy"
,Irishwolfman,2011-06-15T08:45Z,"A=4
V=8
The video is average quality for a cam. However, audio is really low and sounds slightly tunneled. Also the person shooting the video munched way too loud on their snack because it's clearly heard throughout the movie."
,pconvile,2011-06-15T09:08Z,"Video 8-10
Audio POPCORN"
,dashingguyof2k,2011-06-15T10:34Z,TS copy with same sample wtf?! what's the difference?! which one is better wid a n v ?!
,pinkertin,2011-06-16T01:32Z,"Video was def watchable for a cam, though a little dark when the alien comes around.
Audio was just plain annoying! The recorder was munching on his snacks all throughout the movie. It was so annoying I was about to strangle something."
,thanksalotppl,2011-06-16T18:27Z,popcorn

,thanksalotppl,2011-06-16T18:31Z,your clocks wrong pirate bay!!
,pvtpain,2011-06-17T13:52Z,"A-6 Sound is a bit muffled, but expected cam quality. I didn't have to jack my speakers all the way up to hear dialogue, so ^_^. 
V-8 Excellent, for a cam. The focus isn't the best and it's too light/dark in many scenes. Very tolerable.
M-5 It's a decent teen romance catalyzed by a crappy sci fi movie :\"
,donaldson1026,2011-06-17T20:11Z,"The Audio and video are tolerable, but the popcorn chewing is as close to insane as I can handle.  Its fucking loud too. Even when there is action, the popcorn chewing can still be heard.  At 39:39 you can hear the recorder loudly smack his lips and then start breathing heavily for the next minute or more.  Its fucking crazy!"
