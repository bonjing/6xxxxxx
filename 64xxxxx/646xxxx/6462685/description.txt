Synopsis: This is the story of love, lust and power that is generated between a housewife and her maid. Politicized under the Italy of the fifties, we grow the relationship between Anna and Angela, to the point where the class boundaries are blurred.
Perhaps not well known, or simply relegated to the corner of the cover embarrassing erotic, the characters in this tale of class struggle, is a homemaker, wife of a powerful politician, a little frigid, by his elderly mother, and extremely dissatisfied, and a cheerful young servant girl rude, Field, a virgin, but nothing innocent. Among them will be developing a history of gay corruption, in which the two will alternate the role of dominant to dominated in a fight in which eroticism is the key that unlocks the hidden corners of the soul, and leads to the more subtle transgressions.
And all told quietly, darkly warm, with the steady hand of maestro Salvatore Samperi.
The beauties of Guerin and Michelsen, meanwhile, clearly show that the greatest virtue of the actors in the film is photogenic, and has very little impact indeed acting classes they have taken in my life!
