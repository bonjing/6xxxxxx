Storyline: A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged 

landscape save the ash on the wind and water. It is cold enough to crack stones, and, when the snow 

falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the warmer south, although they don't know 

what, if anything, awaits them there.
