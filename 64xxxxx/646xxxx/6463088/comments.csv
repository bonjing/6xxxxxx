This guy is just copying and re-uploading.

,Cameigons,2011-06-12T19:14Z,"The korean subs aren't that bad. I'm used to watching subtitled movies (tough I usually know the language in the subtitles). 

Just download one of these, watch it and get over with it people. The movie is good by the way. :)"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-06-14T09:20Z,"sorry but no way would a drip or blu ray be hardcoded with subs-ESPECIALLY KOREAN!
there are 3 files doin the rounds
one at 1.3-one at 1.8 & one tiny one at 450 meg-they are ALL the same file .there are 2 swedish ones & 2 hindi ones.Some have agk`d it again 2 try n get shot of subs(guess the word hardcoded dont mean a lot)so that accounts for further file size difference -all the same file tho & not blu rays !"
,ramalan,2011-06-14T21:14Z,fuck this
,zeddy911,2011-06-14T21:35Z,Blu-ray due for release on 15 August 2011.. Guess we have to wait a little bit for the proper release...
,Lestatxx,2011-07-02T16:06Z,"@whaleoilbeefhooked I have been in asia and bought movies and YES they are hardcoded with their languages, and english audio.
Thats what they sell to their people their , Its cheaper I guess just to add the subtitles per country instead of re recording the movies"
,Saki33,2011-07-08T14:38Z,"Correction on that BR release date, July 26 in US, and we usually see foreign rips before US date, so not much longer wait.

It is hard to understand all these re-ups of the same old thing. What's the point? "
,qtaz,2011-07-08T15:17Z,What the fuck is going on with those korean subs?
