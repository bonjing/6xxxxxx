[V],Nepotu,2011-06-14T00:26Z,"@platinumkid: You're welcome! I could upload NFL but my space on HDD and my internet bandwidth does not leave me many options. You can try my uploads from FC Barcelona's matches from La Liga, Copa del Rey, Champions League, World Cup of Clubs, UEFA and Spanish Supercups.
@maggot_corps: The NBA finals are played in max. 7 games (the best of 7 games). The games are played so: the first 2 games at the best team (between those two) in the regular season, the next 3 games at the opponent (the third if necessary) and the last 2 games (if necessary) again at the best team. Therefore it were 3 games Heat vs. Dallas.
@fizdude: You're welcome!
@JOR23: One of the best thank that I received in my entire life as uploader! Thank you bro! I don't know if you are american or spanish or anything else but your english and spanish are very good. Tu agradecimiento se ha ido directamente a mi alma, dejandome sin palabras. Gracias tio!
Like a request of one of you I will continue to upload MotoGP 2011 Championship. For the NBA fans I will continue to upload all the NBA finals that I can find (next 1972 final game 5) and for the FC Barcelona's fans all the official games in the 2011-2012 season (from august to may). Thank you all for seeding and thank you all who thanked me! I'll keep you all in my heart! God bless you all! See you!"

Thanks Nepotu!  Looking forward for your posts on the next NBA Season.  Hope there's no lockout.  Do you also have NFL Super Bowls?  Anyhow, great job!  "
[V],Nepotu,2011-06-14T12:16Z,"@MoviesareFree: You're welcome bro!
@M1ked: You're welcome too! In the regular season is a little complicated with so much games but in playoffs I hope that will be here. With NFL Superbowl I can help you but what you need exactly?"
