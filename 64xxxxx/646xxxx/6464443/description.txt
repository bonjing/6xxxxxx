This study of Jonathan Edward's philosophy of sheds fresh light on one of the most important thinkers of early modern philosophy and theology. "Jonathan Edwards' Philosophy of Nature: The Re-Enchantment of the World in the Age of Scientific Reasoning" analyses the works of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) on natural philosophy in a series of contexts within which they may best be explored and understood. Its aim is to place Edwards' writings on natural philosophy in the broad historical, theological and scientific context of a wide variety of religious responses to the rise of modern science in the early modern period - John Donne's reaction to the new astronomical philosophy of Copernicus, Kepler and Galileo, as well as to Francis Bacon's new natural philosophy; Blaise Pascal's response to Descartes' mechanical philosophy; and, the reactions to Newtonian science and finally Jonathan Edwards' response to the scientific culture and imagination of his time.
