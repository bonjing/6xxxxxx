,ipay4U,2011-06-15T00:25Z,@Julagis i don't know mate ive haven't used it yet. are you using ENB for fsx? if so you need to delete it from your fsx that might be the problem because you have to press the same key F12 for this and ENB.
,Yxin123,2011-06-15T17:05Z,"Works perfectly here. Julagis, did you change your install path to your fsx folder? Actually quite a nice addon. The NVGs in superbug doesnt light up the outside of the cockpit, these do. Thx!"
,irlan85,2011-06-29T10:39Z,Works if you follow instructions and direct the instalation to fsx folder. Cool stuff.
,irlan85,2011-06-29T10:40Z,Thx btw :)
