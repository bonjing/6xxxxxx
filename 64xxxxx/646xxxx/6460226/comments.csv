,pattaz84,2011-06-15T12:16Z,why are you uploading fxg's torrents?
,Ian_Iguana,2011-06-16T00:57Z,"alot of people upload other ripper's torrents. I don't think it's really a bad thing,just spreads the torrent more. I only think it's bad when they use someone elses name in the title of the torrent when it isn't that person's torrent. If it's a bad torrent then it'l give the name given a bad name. And if it's good then why not use ya own nickname or whatever so you can get the credit lol."
