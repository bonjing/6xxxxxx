Jake Humphrey presents live coverage of Formula 1's Canadian Grand Prix. Great Britain's Lewis Hamilton was the master of Montreal in last year's race, winning a thrilling race-long five-car battle. Hamilton took the chequered flag ahead of his McLaren team-mate Jenson Button, with Fernando Alonso not far behind in third. The Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were down in fourth and fifth, but this year Vettel has been the man to beat following his stunning start to the season. The current world champion, though, has yet to taste victory on a track where his German compatriot Michael Schumacher won a record seven times. With commentary from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
