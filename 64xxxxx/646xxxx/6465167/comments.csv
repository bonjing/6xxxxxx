,war59312,2011-06-13T05:19Z,"@fatbeer It means it's a test release.

As taken from nfo:

""Testing dimension's suggested encode settings, for those that can, enjoy a higher quality release.""

About time they do this. If they get it right then people will start respecting their releases again. 

IMMERSE has been known for speed but lacking quality. Lots of PROPERS due to quality control issues."

,agnawt,2011-06-14T04:43Z,"Quality is excellent, thanks sceneline.  These ""fake"" trolls need to get a life and should have their accounts closed; they are a determent to the community.  What I don't get is these archived releases; they discourage seeding - I'm not going to keep both the .avi and .rar files around - its a big waste of space."
