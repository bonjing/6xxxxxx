I have compiled the setlist from The Black Keys June 10, 2011 show @ The Lawn at White River in Indianapolis, IN. The songs were gathered from their various studio releases, and are different bit rates. They should be playing a similar set throughout the entire tour. I even made a custom album art which matches their Brother album.

The songs are not a live recording from the show.

1.  Thickfreakness 
2.  Girl Is On My Mind 
3.  The Breaks 
4.  Stack Shot Billy 
5.  Busted 
6.  Act Nice and Gentle 
7.  Everlasting Light 
8.  Next Girl 
9.  Chop and Change 
10. Howlin' For You 
11. Tighten Up 
12. She's Long Gone 
13. Ten Cent Pistol 
14. I'll Be Your Man 
15. Strange Times 
16. I Got Mine 

Encore:
17. Sinister Kid 
18. Your Touch

Enjoy!
