,ManLemon,2011-06-16T21:18Z,"Silly question perhaps, but can I use this version to install the Home Edition as well as I'm going to use the Ultimate for myself but want as little extras as possible on my moms computer, to confuse her as little as possible :P

Thanks either way for the upload!"

PS> this is a DUTCH / nederlandse windows 7 Auto Activation! en je hoeft je niet druk te maken over die eene update die je eigenlijk niet moet insteleren, als je hem wel insteleerd werkt die toch nog goed !! MVG, BeToN075"
