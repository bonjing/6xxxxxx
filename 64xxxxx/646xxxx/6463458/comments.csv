[V],IndexTrance,2011-06-12T14:38Z,"neonrainbow just releases other peoples work on other sites so we all can enjoy them .. 

I don't think he takes requests since they are already busy with other releases and encodes but if you wanna make a try for it, write a PM directly to him instead @ Extratorrent or somewhere else he has an trusted account .. 

Sorry but couldn't paste links due to database error but just search and you'll find!

Good Luck!"
