She tells him that if at the end of a year, he canÃ¢Â€â„¢t find someone to say â€œI LOVE YOUâ€ to him he will remain like that forever. He then goes into seclusion with a maid and a blind tutor. They convince him to go out and find someone. He then goes out to find someone and he runs into Lindy, a student at his school who is not completely turned off by his swagger. When she gets into trouble, he offers to take her in until the trouble is over.
