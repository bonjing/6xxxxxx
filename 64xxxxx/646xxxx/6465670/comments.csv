However I do have to say that the dl stuck at 99% for quite some time, and still is as i write this in its 17th min of stuck, otherwise the dl was very fast and had no issues. Mabey its seeds or another issue, im not that guy. Anyhow Thank You for the up....appreciated as allways, and keep em coming :)"
