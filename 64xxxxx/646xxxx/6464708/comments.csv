,megabjorn,2011-06-21T16:28Z,"Nice.
Is this 2 ""normal"" DVDs or 1 Dual Layer for burning purposes?"
,grebel,2011-06-24T02:53Z,Don't bother downloading. Uploader should have made these as smaller DVD Rip files. All that's on these DVDs is the menu and the film itself. All special features have been completely cut. Completely pointless to have these as such large files.
[T],bill_214,2011-11-30T20:54Z,"I'd rather have the DVDs as they are than have some dumbass like grebel rip them with way too much compression. Note that sometimes the original uploader may have gotten defective DVDs (sans some features or menu from another title) out of the productions company's trash or whatever

Thank You Very Much!

BTW -- These look to be two separate DVDs by looking at the files listed."
,porneyeseeker,2012-02-06T15:17Z,"this is one of most stupids torrents ever... why to download a shit like this if doesn't have SPECIAL FEATURES!? almost 10 GBs of stupidity... the reason for download a DVD are the SPECIAL FEATURES! ""chkm8te"" moron... delete this shit and start all over again, and start it right..."
