[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-14T01:23Z,maybe you should try and see
,smthvk,2011-06-14T12:44Z,so the one that i downloaded off you two days ago was fucked and i wasted 6gb 
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-14T17:05Z,"@smthvk

The old sons of anarchy? It was fine, it was in SD not HD. These new ones are in HD"
,menopirate,2011-06-14T20:43Z,"The newer releases from mkvGOD are better since they are not as high compressed as he did with Rome - with around 200mb per episode it was sadly too high compressed and showed much too much compression artifacts. 

It would be great if you could redo Rome. 

Anyhow your effort to bring 720p to tv series in a small size and good quality is greatly appreciated. 

I myself download the 1-1.5 GB  episodes from shows I like and recompress them with handbrake and setting high profile RF:25 to file sizes what are mostly below the SD avi versions. "
,CosmAvngr,2011-06-14T20:54Z,"I have to agree. Too much resolution and too little bit rate has quality in the toilet IMO.

I didn't download these, but I did Download mkvGOD 230MB 720p Terriers and they were worse than the 352p 140MB ""BoB Releases"" encodes.

Trying to drive this much resolution with too little bandwidth leads to tons of edge/motion artifacts."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-15T18:28Z,"I wouldn't mind a re-done encode of The 4400 with higher video bitrate and lower audio bitrate...similar to your recent 720p rips of Deadwood and Mad Men etc.

Other than that, you're affecting my downloads of tv shows xivd/avi' as I plan to re-encode them myself but I don't won't to miss out on your good 720p uploads while they're seeded.

It sucks to have a ISP cable provider that only provides a max 200Gb per month...Australia's internet/cable is rather average and our upload speeds are atrocious.

Anyway, Thanks, will DL this eventually [even though I encoded a perfectly good DVD/TV rip of this show], however 720p in good quality is preferred...like yours."

Fantastic quality for such a small filesize and most of my favourite shows as well... Wish I could +1 you per episode though, whole seasons will sadly not give you the pink skull even though you do deserve one. 

Anyway, keep up the good work :D"

,Lukao.,2012-04-21T10:00Z,"Hey mkvGOD, is there any chances for you to upload in torrent the complete season 4?

I really enjoy your work compressing those videos in small sizes and taking awesome qualities.

I already downloaded the 3 seasons that you have posted, and now I need this recent season.

I would be very grateful if you post it.

Thanks in advace!"
