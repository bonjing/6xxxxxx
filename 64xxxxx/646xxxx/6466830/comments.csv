,djroosta,2011-07-08T00:12Z,"Is this torrent clean?

He doesn't seem to give any description of the sort on any of his torrents except ""PLEASE SEED THE TORRENT"" Which is rather annoying as their is noinformation on the game what so ever, and secondly people will seed no matter what and ""Shouting"" (In A Way, by using CAPS!!!)

 Doesn't help....

Try and use your brain uploader"

,jarooko,2011-08-02T11:31Z,"Well, uploader,  thanks for uploading this game, but I have to be honest... it doesn't work for me. It reports an error when I enter a key, and crashes. Now, judging from the type of the error(s), it maybe has something to do with my computer, rather then with the game generally not working, but I really can't tell. If I do fix it, I will write how.
All-in-all, in conclusion, it does not work for me, but maybe it will for you guys, so try to DL it."
,jarooko,2011-08-02T11:45Z,"      Ok, yea, so here it is:

   The problem is the first error, ""No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"". The fact is, you have to disconnect totally from the net for the game to work.
   First, I tried to block it with my firewall, but evidently, somehow, something manages to get past, and sends a signal to the server. In that moment the game knows I have a connection, but won't let it pass, and crashes. If I disconnect from the net completely, then everything works fine. Gonna try to fix this now. :D"
