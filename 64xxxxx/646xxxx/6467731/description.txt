       It's been a decade since the last time a rapper headlined an      
        episode of MTV's Unplugged (Jay-Z in 2001, to be specific),
        so when Lil Wayne took the stage at Culver City's Sony Studios
        for his turn on May 13 (the episode airs Sunday night),
        you could sense an instant feeling of accomplishment.
        
        This shit is censored, nothing we can do. Fuck MTV.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
