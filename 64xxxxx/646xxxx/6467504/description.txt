Someone emailed a video to a yahoo group I am on.  I wondered where it came from so I googled the filename.  Google led me to http://media.slutwives.com/videos/

That folder has 71G of video clips with indexing turned on.  The newest file in there is from November 2010.  I have no idea where they are storing their current videos.

I downloaded everything.  I removed the binary duplicates.  I stripped off the first 13 characters from the filenames (ie: 4ae932623f861mvc-409w.mp4 -> mvc-409w.mp4).  That left 66G in 4340 files.

Enjoy.
