,athavan,2011-06-16T12:28Z,Audio is 500ms out of sync!
,piratethisboo,2011-06-16T14:09Z,"guys very easy to fix Audio synch in VLC, once playing use shortcut keys to adjust + or - by one millisecond. I think I just did it forward  +3 times and synch was perfect. Here are the hotkeys:
Mac: F and G
Windows: J and K

Other then the Audio Out of Synch, Video is great 9 and movie is a 8. 

(side note: Sean Bean, is same guy from Game of Thrones on HBO)"
,hagoo,2011-06-16T18:11Z,Why is Boromir holding a gun?
,is0prano,2011-06-16T19:19Z,or just use vld player and sync the audio with the push of a button
,michaeldevon,2011-06-17T18:57Z,"Excellant Quality. Films pretty gash though, only saving grace is that it has Sean Bean in it and is about Bootnecks. "
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-06-17T21:54Z,"This has serious audio/sync problems.

Decent version here:

,Aeronomer,2011-06-28T03:26Z,0.3 seconds of audio in advance of video in VLC worked perfectly for me. Try it rather than download another huge file. 
,Plasmadude,2011-07-01T18:15Z,Good film

,toddleier,2011-10-15T03:26Z,"A sad, poorly retold, story. For the real story read the book Green Beach. 

http://www.amazon.com/Green-Beach-James-Leasor/dp/0755100441

In 1942 radar expert Jack Nissenthall volunteered for a suicidal mission to join a combat team who were making a surprise landing at Dieppe in occupied France. His assignment was to penetrate a German radar station on a cliff above Green Beach. Because Nissenthall knew the secrets of British and US radar technology, he was awarded a personal bodyguard of sharpshooters. Their orders were to protect him, but in the event of possible capture to kill him. His choice was to succeed or die. The story of what happened to him and his bodyguards in nine hours under fire is one of World War IIs most terrifying true stories of personal heroism.

This would have made a better movie."
