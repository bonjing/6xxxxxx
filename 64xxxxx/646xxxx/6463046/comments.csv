,senotrius,2011-06-12T18:31Z,is it possible to shave off a 100mb frm ur uploads..next time?all ur uploads are good however I think a 250mb file size would be optimum for handhelds without losing out on quality..
,pinkpetal,2011-06-12T19:09Z,I like this size anything smaller and you lose quality. Nice job.
