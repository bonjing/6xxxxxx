,zvengar,2011-06-11T17:27Z,"must be ,cause none of his screen shots have any pic. all come back with this:No such file with this filename "
,RL269,2011-06-12T08:48Z,".nfo depends on what it's used for, usually it opens just like .txt

On PC you set notepad to open it. If you can't do that, try changing the file name so '.nfo' is '.txt' then open.

Usually the file just contains info about what the files are about (model or movie info), the format (resolution, size, audio), or where it came from (spam ads)

If it is just text, than no, it can't be a virus."
