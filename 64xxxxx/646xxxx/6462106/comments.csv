,Liman_Bot,2011-06-11T17:19Z,"Hey guys just letting you know The Skidrow CRACK CAN WORK with razor's crack.

 Here is how to do it : If you already have razors version installed,apply their crack!
 AFter appying there crack, apply skidrows
 overwrite and it will work like a charm."
,JPeterson,2011-06-11T18:38Z,"If you lose Duke Vision and all items when you load your save game after changing from the razor to the skidrow crack it's because last.dcp, system.ini and user.ini from the razor version has some kind of non-standard unicode formatting with a 0x00 between all letters, which skidrow's steam dlls doesn't use.

So you need to run these replace commands on last.dcp, system.ini and user.ini to format from razor to skidrow format:

sfk rep last.dcp -binary /00// -yes
sfk rep last.dcp -binary /0d0d/0d/ -yes"
,DirtyRed,2011-06-11T22:47Z,Why the -3? This isn't fake...
,siki20,2011-06-11T22:47Z,Skidrow crack only?
,chuckl45,2011-06-12T00:27Z,"I get the same thing with this version that I did with the first Razor1911 version. Installs fine, launches, select ""Let's Rock!"" and then drinking beer, pissing, taking a shower but NO actual game!! I DID follow instructions in the .nfo
WTF am I doing wrong?
AMD II x4 955 BE 3.58GHz, 8G RAM, EVGA GT240, 1G DDR3 GPU, Win7 Ultimate x64
I have yet had a problem with ANY new game from Call of Duty:Black Ops to Prototype to Fallout Las Vegas.
Any suggestions?"
