,casperboo,2011-06-12T07:20Z,"BE WARNED!! This is for developers only, therefore it is NOT compatible with existing iPhone Libraries.  You will have to create a new Library to test this and manually add all your pictures from the old library and re-create all of your Events, etc.  Use this at your own peril as there is a high chance of losing photos and or your entire library if you do not know what you are doing by reading the release notes!  You have been warned!"

,repayfriendship,2012-06-14T16:29Z,"It looks like it is for Lion operating system.  It is not compatible with Mac OS X 10.6!  Thank you Jesus Christ.  Thank you for your kind people who share.  Also, thank you that I happen to have a backup disc that has the right version for my system.  Thank you iMZDL for the upload anyways.  It looks like a good copy from the message that it requires Lion."
