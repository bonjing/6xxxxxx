Casper v7.0.1801-DOA


Casper makes it easy to keep a complete and instantly bootable backup replacement hard disk for your system. Should your system hard disk fail or become corrupted by a virus or spyware attack, you can boot and run your computer directly from your backup hard disk and be up and running again in seconds!

Casper enables complete system backups to be performed at any time without leaving Windows, so there is never a need to restart the computer or stop work to create a backup.

Clear, easy-to-follow wizards guide you through the entire process step-by-step, while features such as SmartStartâ„¢, 1-Click Cloningâ„¢, and Integrated Scheduling ensure anytime is right for a backup.

You can schedule a backup copy to be performed automatically -- daily, weekly, monthly, or at any time desired. Casper's exclusive Advanced Power Management functionality can even wake your computer in the middle of the night to perform a copy completely unattended and then safely return it back to sleep while you sleep!

Optional SmartAlertâ„¢ Notifications can be configured to notify when a backup has been completed or only when a backup requires attention for true â€œset it and forget itâ€ operation.

SmartStart and exclusive 1-Click Cloning support make even on-demand backups a snap. And by taking advantage of new Windows 7 and Vista technologies such as I/O prioritization and I/O cancellation support, Casper's exclusive Automatic Performance Throttling support ensures the backup completes entirely in the background without interfering with your work.
