,kratol,2011-06-11T09:05Z,The patch and keygen are both infected. This is how lame hackers get their zombie computers. Then they sell their bots services on IRC and web forums.
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-06-11T10:53Z,"The Patch and Keygen aren't a virus, my computer also think it's a virus, but it's illegal software with no virus!"
,oiundisputedio,2011-06-12T03:50Z,"The patch won't download correctly for me, it loads, then tells me there was an error and it can't patch all the files.  What should I do, this happens when I click Patch... on the keygen.  I tried registering prior to doing this because I didn't realize I was suppose to, help appreciated."
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-06-12T10:46Z,"Is you open the patch,you have to select the Sony Vegas Pro 10 folder, if you do that; you click on the + sign and than on crack me. And than it would be finished. And don't patch the programme with the keygen!"
,henradical,2011-06-15T18:48Z,"Hey, Ajaxpyro97, It did not work. Mabey its just this specific build (670).

I entered the serial which worked, however it refused the activation code."
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-06-17T19:53Z,"At my PC it works with this built, and did you patch it before opening it ore activating it with the patch programme, and not the keygen?"
,henradical,2011-06-17T20:16Z,Yeh :( Are you running 32bit or 64bit? Im running 64bit Win 7
,henradical,2011-06-17T20:17Z,"Ill try it on a different PC, i might just have messed the patch up."
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-06-25T13:04Z,"I am running at Windows 7 64 bit, but I installed the 32 bit"
,kraftx,2011-06-28T16:07Z,"Where do Paranoid Idiots like Kratol (First Comment) come from? Why do they troll the boards and make stupid comments about viruses in every torrent???  If you can't handle a false positive virus alert you should either Not Run your virus program while downloading and installing programs which you download from the TPB or other such sites!  If you do run your stupid anti virus protection then Please Do NOT make comments if it flags a Virus EVERYTIME you go to install.  Thank-you for no longer pestering the crowd here at The Pirate Bay!

To Ajaxpro97, Great Post, it works as advertised!"
,xDaviz,2011-07-02T18:36Z,DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS . THIS TORRENT IS VIRUS !!!!
,drakeluvr,2011-07-03T13:18Z,I also had it refuse the 64bit activation. Will try the 32bit though I am running 64 bit windows.
,drakeluvr,2011-07-03T13:26Z,"Had to use a 32bit program on a machine running 64 bit win 7, but its working."
,Ajaxpyro97,2011-07-10T16:57Z,DO NOT USE THE 64 BITS VERSION!! THIS ONE WILL NOT WORK!! INSTALL THE 32 BITS VERSION!!
,LoveRhyme,2011-07-20T18:07Z,"After a few tries, here are the modified instructions:

I will help you with installing ""Sony Vegas Pro 10"" v100

Follow the following steps:

1. Disable your ""Virus Protection""; each virus protection has its own way of being disabled; do this first before going onto the 

next step; go to help section for this information

2. Install the 32 bit or the 64 bit version of Sony Vegas Pro 10; make sure you know which one you're installing and you can do 

this by going to start, all programs, accessories, system tools, and system information; see system directory for your bit

3. Run the programm called ""SonyVegasPro Patch"", and click the first of 3 icons (the filmtape)

4. Scroll and select the Sony Vegas Pro 10 folder; do this by going to your local ""C"" Drive, Program Files, look for ""Sony"", then 

make sure you click on ""Vegas Pro 10.0"" file 

5. Click the second icon of 3 (the ""+"" icon) and press ""Crack Me"" and wait until the patch is complete

6. Once completed, close the patching program by clicking on the third of 3 icons (""X"" icon)

7. Click on the keygen file and if your operating system is Vista/Windows 7 choose by right clicking on the ""KEYGEN"" icon and 

highlight ""Run as administrator"" scroll and select ""Sony Vegas Pro 10.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series"" 

8. Open Sony Vegas Pro 10 and you will have to fill in a serial; choose one of the keygen files (don't close the keygen file just 

yet!)

9. Follow each step until you have to choose the way of activation; choose for ""Activation from another computer"" and you will have 

to save a ""html"" file (save at your desire location and never delete it!)

10. Fill in bogus information regarding first and last name, email, address etc.

11. Now you will have to fill in the authentication code; copy the code from the keygen file into the activation window; press 

next.

12. DONE/Enjoy!!"
,B2cool,2011-07-24T18:41Z,Dont use the patcher if your planning to use the 64 bit one. Use the one in the keygen (look for the patch button)
,george1052,2011-07-30T08:43Z,"Hi everyone. I've read and re-read the posts to make sure that I'm not asking a repeat question but the keygen is not working for me. I'm following the step-by-step instructions provided by LoveRhyme (thanks!) but when I click on the keygen (step #7) an error states that ""the path is not correct"". Is anyone else having or had this problem? Thank you."
,tgcleader,2011-08-07T05:44Z,This works great thank you and for all that want to use the 64 bit vesion you and and it will work just use the patch in the keygen.exe and then generate a keay and activation code. This will also work this way using the 32 bit version too so I dont know why they included another patch file cause you dont need it.
,tgcleader,2011-08-07T05:47Z,This works great thank you and for all that want to use the 64 bit version it will works! Just use the patch in the keygen.exe first and then generate a key and activation code. then open up sony vegas 10 and enter the key then register from another computer then put fake info then continue then copy the activation code. Remember once you input a key dont re generate cause that key only matched that activation code cause they work in pairs. This will also work this way using the 32 bit version too so I dont know why they included another patch file cause you dont need it. 
,DontPissMeOff,2011-08-08T14:10Z,If you are afraid that a keygen contains a virus then use Avast and open it in the sandbox - no threat in that!
,Deam0nAssassin,2011-08-16T17:12Z,"Tnx bro, this works great !!!"
,doubleaa25,2011-08-24T00:05Z,"Good torrent! Unfortunately the Patch does not work with the 64 bit version of the program, you must install 32 bit version for this to work. And yes, the 32 bit version works fine on 64 bit installs. Also, this is not a virus, though McAfee says it is and deletes the keygen/patch. Very annoying..."
,Quentin360SA,2011-09-05T20:41Z,"It works without a problem!

Just follow the instructions LoveRhyme posted.

Windows Vista Home 32bit"
,Orient.OD,2011-09-07T21:26Z,"You do need to use the patcher included, But it only patches the 32 bit version. you can tell when it has been patched properly when vegas pro skips the serial number part and goes straight to authentication. Enjoy!"
,iMango,2012-02-18T21:52Z,"Thank you so much, it works perfectly!"
