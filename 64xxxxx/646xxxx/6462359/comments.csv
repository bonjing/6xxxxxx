I have been trying to complete my Doctor Collection, I have Doctors 1-4 COMPLETE, and I also have The 6th Doctor, HOWEVER, I have been unable to find the 5th and 7th Doctors, either in part, or complete, if you could post those you would be my hero, and that would also allow me to compile and upload a complete (1963 - 2010) torrent for everyone."
