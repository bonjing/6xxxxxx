In this Letterman episode Letterman asks him about NPH's new twins, how they were conceived and more.  NPH shows fotos of the twins dressed for Easter - Cinco De Mayo - so incredibly funny!  NPH is one of the best openly gay mentors the LGBT community could ask for.  I'm straight and I love the guy!"
