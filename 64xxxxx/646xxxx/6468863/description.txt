Picasso was avant-garde, traditional, an erotomaniac. He is a legend whose paintings almost everyone can visualise today. His works and character had an enormous influence on 20th century art. As an artist and man, he is still one-of-a-kind, rather like the collection of his
works on display at the Picasso Museum in Paris. Didier Baussy-Oulianoff presents them, sorts them according to period and establishes what inspired them. Baussy's analysis also explains why some of the paintings on display were so close to Picasso's heart that he never sold them, preferring to hold on to them until he died.
