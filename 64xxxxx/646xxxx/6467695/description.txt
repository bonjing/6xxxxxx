Okay, same as usual really. Jailbroken firmwares for iOS beta 1, with a guide on how to install them :) You guys know the drill, just download the folder you require, not the entire torrent! :) Contains all devices except the iPad 2, unfortunately this isn't supported as it uses the limera1n exploit but hey ho. Hacktivation isn't supported either, however there is baseband preservation.

Remember to seed please :)
