,minijigga,2011-06-14T00:22Z,"this cannot be the real cd... quality sucks, downloaded and deleted. appreciate the effort, but saying this is ""320 kbps"" is misleading... I can remix 96kbps into higher bitrates too, but that doesn't make them sound any better... If you care about quality, avoid this one IMHO"
,minijigga,2011-06-14T00:34Z,"sample the tracks on iTunes and then listen to these. Most of these tracks must have been webripped or something and then re-compressed to 320kbps. Not blaming the upper, but I'd avoid this if you like your music to sound the way it's supposed to.
This torrent sounds better:

That one doesn't seem to be the real thing either, but it does sound alot better than this one"

,deftonesFTW,2011-09-25T00:11Z,"There's a major problem with the quality of the songs. It is 320kbps, but it was resampled from mostly mono audio. Mono audio means that all of the sound channels were dumped into one central channel. In normal stereo we hear everything being sample into Left and Right channels. In most of these songs the audio was sampled in mono. Hope this helps the misunderstanding. If you don't get it then check iTunes and listen to the version they have there which is sampled in stereo."
,deftonesFTW,2011-09-25T00:31Z,"Do what @minijigga says about the songs on iTunes. The problem with these tracks is that they are mostly sampled in mono (everything is mixed into ONE central channel which makes the song sound overcompressed), some of the tracks are sampled normally in stereo (everything is mixed into two channels; left and right). You won't notice it through normal speakers, the best way is to use headphones.

-Cheers"
