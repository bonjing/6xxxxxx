BOOK INFO:

The content of this book will lead to affordable phono amplifier design approaches which will end up in lowest-noise solutions not far away from the edge of physical boundaries set by room temperature and given cartridges - thus, fully compatible with very expensive so called "high-end" or "state-of-the-art" offers on todayâ€™s markets - and, from a noise point of view in most cases outperforming them! This book demonstrates that theory is not far away from reality.
