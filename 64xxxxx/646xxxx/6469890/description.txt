[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

Fox News gave me an hour for another special.

I titled it after this cute Onion clip: "Should The Government Stop Dumping Money Into A Giant Hole?"

We will soon spend ourselves into oblivion. But finally... movement! Budget slashing proposals from Paul Ryan, the Republican Study Committee, Ron Paul, Rand Paul and even Tim Pawlenty! But politicians and real people across the spectrum still resist change. What should government do? What's its role? What have other countries done? The Money Hole tackles that.
