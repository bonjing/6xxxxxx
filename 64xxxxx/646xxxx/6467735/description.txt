A bereaved mother, dumbstruck by her son\'s     
accidental death comes to Kolkata to carry     
out the last rites and claim his belongings.   
Her three-day stay in her dead son\'s apartment,
laden with memories and interaction with his   
friends makes her realize that those belongings
which she claimed to be exclusively personal,  
are ubiquitous, distributed among his friends  
and acquaintances. She also realizes her own   
presence in the midst of these unfamiliar peopl
that she has been inhabiting their hearts and  
thoughts much before destiny brought them      
together.
