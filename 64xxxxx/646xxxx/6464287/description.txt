As more images and videos are becoming available in compressed formats, researchers have begun designing algorithms for different image operations directly in their domains of representation, leading to faster computation and lower buffer requirements. Image and Video Processing in the Compressed Domain presents the fundamentals, properties, and applications of a variety of image transforms used in image and video compression. It illustrates the development of algorithms for processing images and videos in the compressed domain.

Developing concepts from first principles, the book introduces popular image and video compression algorithms, in particular JPEG, JPEG2000, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, and H.264 standards. It also explores compressed domain analysis and performance metrics for comparing algorithms. The author then elucidates the definitions and properties of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), integer cosine transform (ICT), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). In the subsequent chapters, the author discusses core operations, such as image filtering, color enhancement, image resizing, and transcoding of images and videos, that are used in various image and video analysis approaches. He also focuses on other facets of compressed domain analysis, including video editing operations, video indexing, and image and video steganography and watermarking.
