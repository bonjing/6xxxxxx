,rocketero,2011-07-07T14:45Z,"the game plays ok on my win 7 x64, but for some reason the fps is only 15 , which makes it run very very slowly, voices seems like coming from a deep cave and slow as hell. the gow version1 I have for pcsx2 runs fine with same settings."
,rocketero,2011-07-07T15:52Z,"interesting, it improves a bit by running it windowed instead of full-screen (22 fps). what I found curious is that when u get killed the menu says tgbus.com instead of 'continue from last saved-pont, other than that is working ok. "

,Kingkjvku,2011-09-02T09:52Z,"i got solution on my own:

Try this:

1) go to config
2) select appropriate options; i recommand direct input for both boxes (right and left)
3) select middle tab (name: Pad 1 )
4) Now Apply your keys your way,
like changing action key for any game
5)if i were u i like to give:
for x(cross) key in ps2 give space in pc,
likewise 

6) click on apply
7) click on okay...

This is it."
,Kingkjvku,2011-09-02T09:58Z,"i forgot step 1.1
it is go to controller(pad)


I also recommand to download latest version of pcsx2 which is free and of only 13 mb size from pcxs2.net  it solved problem of sound in my pc.

thanks to manipwr40, for highcompression upload"

,vishnu195,2011-09-23T05:12Z,MY settings CDVD- PLUGINS game started but. Select LAnguage KeyBOAD not working. what should i do
,RyanxRAGE,2011-09-28T05:35Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I can't go 5 minutes without the game completely pausing and flashing a stupid Chinese website on the screen for a good 30 seconds or so. It's really really annoying and you can't do anything about it except stare at it and wait for it to go away.
