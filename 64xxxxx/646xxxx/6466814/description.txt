BOOK INFO:

There exists quite a vast literature on mobile robots, covering fundamental principles on motion control and path-planning in indoor environments using ultrasonic/laser transducers. However, there is a scarcity of books/collective documents on vision based navigation of mobile robots and multi-agent systems. The book fills this gap and attempts to develop interesting models for vision based map building in indoor and outdoor environments, precise motion control, navigation in dynamic environment, and above all multi-agent co-operation of robots. The most important aspect of this book is that the principles and models introduced in the text are all field-tested, and thus can readily be used in solving real world problems, such as factory automation, disposal of nuclear wastes, landmine clearing and computerized surgery. Primarily meant for graduate students and researchers in robotics, the book is equally useful to interested audience of any discipline for its contents and simplicity in presentation style.
