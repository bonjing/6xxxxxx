Book Description: 
In Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy: Transcription Factors and Other Nuclear Proteins, a panel of leading basic researchers, pharmaceutical scientists, and clinical oncologists explain in detail the therapeutically-relevant protein targets that contribute to cancer pathology and spell out their implications for cancer drug discovery and clinical application. The authors identify and illuminate selected transcription factor oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, together with nuclear proteins that are central to the phenotype of the tumor cell involved in chromatin control. The emphasis is on new targets and approaches to cancer treatment derived from the cancer cell cycle, gene control targets, and angiogenesis.
