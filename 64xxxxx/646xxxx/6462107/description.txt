Note: This torrent is a 137 cut of the movie. Strangewise, a 137 minutes version is not listed on IMDb. Maybe IMDb got it wrong and is listing the Italian version wrongly (127 instead of 137 minutes). I assume the latter one, which means that this torrent is the Italian version, thus the longest and most complete cut available.
