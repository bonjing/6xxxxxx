Marvins Room" is another signature take on Drakeâ€™s sing-rap style with atmospheric production, light drums and subtle keyboard work. Reminiscent of some of the slower jams from his popular mixtape So Far Gone and his debut LP, Drake continues in the vein of a tortured lover on the emotionally charged track. The song finds Drake playing the role of line stepper as he pines for a taken woman all while trying to gain her affections. Upon the songâ€™s release this morning, the track has spread throughout the Web with fans commenting in droves.
