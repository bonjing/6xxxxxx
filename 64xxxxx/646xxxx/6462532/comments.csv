This is a good book and this is an ALMOST complete version now (750 odd pages) and so a perfectly good taster with the final release coming out on the 5th of July (unless it's held back again) . If you like what you see here buy the full book so the author can keep writing books that work for you! I have my hardcopy on order aswell!"
