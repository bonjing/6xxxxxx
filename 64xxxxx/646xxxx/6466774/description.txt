It's been more than a decade since Dr. Jonathan Wright introduced the concept of bio-identical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) with the book Natural Hormone Replacement for Women Over 45 (Wright JVW, Morgenthaler J. Smart Publications, 1997), at a time when only a handful of clear thinking, knowledgeable doctors had ever heard about bio-identical hormones. Many women first learned the truth about HRT and BHRT from that first book; others later heard about it from TV celebrity Suzanne Somers, who described her personal experiences with a different version of BHRT in the first of a series of books.

But the real stampede away from HRT and toward BHRT began in 2002 with the premature termination of a large, government-funded study-the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)-the results of which confirmed that the risks of conventional HRT unquestionably outweighed its benefits. In their new updated book, /Stay Young & Sexy with Bio-Identical Hormone Replacement: The Science Explained/, authors Wright and Lenard have brought to light many examples of forgotten or ignored scientific studies combined with up-to-date clinical experience that provide solid support for the safety and benefits of BHRT.
