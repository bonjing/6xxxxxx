Folder Marker Pro 3.2.0 Portable


Folder Marker Home lets you mark your folders with color-coded and image-coded icons with one mouse click, which makes them easy to find and retrieve. Simply select the folder you want to mark, right-click on its icon, select a color-coded icon from the drop-down menu and it will be assigned to the folder at once.

Users can take advantage of great customization flexibility. You can, for example, modify a right-click menu of a folder by adding new menu items and categories and assigning icons to them. You also have the ability to add new items to Folder Marker's icon set. Simply drop an ICL file to the appropriate folder and a new tab with folders from this file will appear. The user can choose to make folders, customized with Folder Marker Home, distributable. This means a color-coded icon remains unchanged even if the folder is copied onto a new computer or the system has been re-installed. Also, you can apply a selected icon to all sub-folders in a given folder.
