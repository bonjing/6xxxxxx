         A mystery surrounds a small town that was        
         attacked on September 9, 2009. Now sixty years   
         later, the last survivor, Sarah, sends a high    
         profile reporter a letter suggesting what        
         really happened on that day. The government      
         calls 9/9/09 the start of the "Modern Plague",   
         and the reporter soon realizes that the truth    
         may be harder to uncover than the lies.
