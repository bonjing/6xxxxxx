,steve30x,2011-06-11T00:54Z,This is fake. Gran Turismo 4 was never on the PC.
,cschrille1,2011-06-11T02:00Z,"This is for emulator which allows you to play for example, PS2 games on your PC.
Doubt its fake."
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-11T19:52Z,"ok. this is bullshit. this is just the normal Gran Turismo 4. it's not a remake. but yeah, it works with PCSX2 (a ps2 emulator for windows and linux). i've stopped seeding because i realised that it isn't a remake. it's just the original 2004 game. but if you still want the original game, you can search for ""Grand Turismo 4"" here on TPB and download the most seeded torrent. that one also works great with PCSX2. sorry about that, but the ripper fooled me."
,XxXDoWNLoADeRXxX,2011-06-11T19:55Z,and TPB won't let me edit the fucking torrent.. sorry about that guys..
