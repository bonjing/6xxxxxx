Product Description: 
World wetlands are endangered by human activities and development in all parts of the world. This book approaches the study of wetlands management and development policy by using integrated ecosystem modelling that draws on insights from hydrology, ecology and economics. The authors devote particular attention to the spatial dimension, the development of a set of complementary indicators, and the aggregation and evaluation of information.
