Product Description:

 

Actuators, which move and manipulate objects, are the key technological components for all modern science and technologies. The advent of new, outstanding actuators will bring innovation to a range of different areas â€“ such as basic science, industry, medicine, welfare, and the global environment â€“ and in this way will provide us with a better quality of life.

 

Next-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs is the proceedings of the final symposium of MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas: Next-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs, held in January 2010.

 

This project pursues the realization of next-generation actuators and accumulates the common basic technologies for actuators, with a view to possible future applications. Since the realization of next-generation actuators requires an interdisciplinary approach, the research has been organized according to a broad technological perspective that consists of:

â€¢ actuators for small motion of nano-meters;

â€¢ small-size actuators of micro-meters structures;

â€¢ intelligent actuators for functional motions;

â€¢ power actuators for large force/torque; and

â€¢ actuators for special environments.

Next-Generation Actuators Leading Breakthroughs also deals with common fundamental technologies for these actuators, such as intelligent materials, machining processes, control technologies, evaluation methods, and system integration. It provides cutting-edge research for researchers, postgraduates, and practitioners in mechanical, electrical, and materials industries.
