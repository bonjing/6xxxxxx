Leaving behind the Dogma War and Leonard and his friends for a brand new tale of adventure, White Knight Chronicles: Origins offers an entirely new story set 10,000 years before the events of the original PS3 game. With a 30+ hour single player campaign and cooperative play for up to 4 friends, White Knight Chronicles: Origins has plenty to keep you going on the move. You'll also be able to trade quests and avatars with your friends.
