"God has endowed the British race with a worldwide empire - 
that they may execute his sovereign purpose in the world.  
The victories you will have over the heathen are the victories
of the nobler soul in man."  Powerful Quote from the movie script


Note:
Converted from a PAL DVD folder we found on the net some time ago.
It contained Polish subtitles only, however we did manage to find
German, Italian, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Romanian and Norwegian
in addition to the Polish that was there to begin with. 
That said, we had no luck finding matching subs for French, English
or Dutch Im afraid to say. This is the PAL version, as I say once again.

Reviewer comment:
The aim of this movie to to provide a wake up call to those in the British camp
most of all to the horrors of the conflicts that are inflicted by attempting to
integrate masses that have no real basis of coming together in the first place in
the manner we see unfold in our world this present day, everywhere in our midst in
fact - based on this newfound sense of idealism which lacks true virtue or sanity 
in fact. This movie shows the core differences that are plain enough to see.

We are in fact shown an image of a "Jesus like" saviour to the men of Africa,
perhaps, in some way of looking at this picture, as he physically carries a 
huge man of Africa on his back through the desert, to save him from his plight 
by show of sheer force of physical strenght and similar spirit too perhaps as to
provide  what is the energy he must require to pull it off. Oh well, live and
learn I suppose, I am not as yet and most certainly now convinced of the mans 
merits to put it plainly.


Enjoy!
