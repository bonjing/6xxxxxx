Call to Power is a turn based empire building game. You start a
civilization in the stone ages and lead them to the future through
science, diplomacy, war, trade and other actions. Eventually you
will be building colonies in space and cities in the ocean if you
can survive.

One of the most noticeable differences from the original Civilization
is that the timeline of the game does not end in the 21st century,
but rather goes to the year 3000. There are five epochs in this game:
Ancient Age, Renaissance, Modern Age, Genetic Age, and Diamond Age.
In the game, space colonization and sea colonization become a reality
with appropriate technological advances (available in the Genetic Age).
