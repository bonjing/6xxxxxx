BOOK INFO:

This is a textbook on preaching from an ecumenical perspective, covering the foundations and practice of preaching. In our rapidly changing world, Christian preaching is as important as ever, but makes even greater demands of the preacher than in the past. It is being challenged by new forms of worship and communication at a time when it is becoming more difficult for preachers to address the complex issues of modern life in relation to Christianity. This book is designed to help preachers to sustain themselves and each other in their work and to realize their full potential by helping them to re-affirm the importance of preaching by rehearsing its biblical and theological basis and to understand the cycles, dynamics and rhythms of their vocation and to engage with them constructively. It offers clear guidelines on how to construct a sermon and use contemporary professional support services throughout their preaching ministry and to develop their own support networks. So the book emphasizes what preachers themselves, personally and through supportive networks, can do to sustain and develop their preaching ministries.
