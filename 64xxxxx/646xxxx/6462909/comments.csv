,ogchris,2011-06-13T06:44Z,thanks. Are you going to get the CNN debate?  
[T],skJGZV6z,2011-06-14T22:11Z,"debate? I kid. No. To be honest, the election stuff already swinging is just...so...exasperatingly...boring...to me. Freedom Watch luckily hasn't become _all_ about the 2012 race, because for a few days there I was considering taking a break from watching. My personal list of favorites for the next President is quite short. I don't imagine it changing, so for me there is little more to do but wait 17 months and see if anyone on that list survives onto the ballot."
