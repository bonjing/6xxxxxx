In a developing series of shows focusing on the individual candidates for the 2012 election, as he did previously for Ron Paul, John Stossel tonight invites Republican candidate Gary Johnson on the show for the full hour. Candidate Johnson puts forward his particular platform for running, has a debate on the issues with Stossel's fake-President Obama, and takes audience questions.
