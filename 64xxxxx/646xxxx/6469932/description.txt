- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  Here's a collection from this amazing Chicago band. They were definitely one
  of my favorites when their Asian Man Debut came out in 2000, and their music
  still means a lot to me today. It's got that Tim guy from Rise Against and Dan
  and Rob from the Broadways. Now that's a good band. Anyways, these records are
  remastered and this is the first time the demo has been on CD.

  These Nails can build anything we want them to, let's build a place where we
  can choose
  The Life We're Living." -The Honor System: Slaves
