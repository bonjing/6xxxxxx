Beautiful, detailed contemporary engravings, widely researched sources. Mostly American domestic engines. Many types: grasshoppers, camel-backs, Moguls, Forneys, plus some famous onesâ€”the General, Reuben Wells, Pennsylvania, more. Best source for a spectacular engine. In this pictorial collection, each illustration catalogues a high point in the continuous developement of the train engine between the year 1804 and the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. In many ways, these pictures tell the story of the locomotive more dramatically than any copiously written history.
