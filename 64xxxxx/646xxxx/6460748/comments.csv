,miguelsz3,2011-06-11T02:08Z,"P.S.
I did a virus scan and damn does it make me cringe. I've done a virus scan on my pc and it's clean sooo....... ummmm yah thats it :D
Oh and Theta reeaaally need's to clean up both their installer and their NFO viewer cuase it make alot of Virus scanners go nuts -0-

P.S.
Here are a few results from 2 virus scanning sites. It appears the NFO viewer makes alot of false positives. Oh and before I forget my pc tested clean after a virus scan so no virus only false positves.

,Shinichii,2011-06-11T12:16Z,Anyone who knows how to get this to work? I can't seem to get it working.
,Kes82,2011-06-11T13:55Z,Thanks works fine :)
,StormtrooperZ,2011-06-11T14:58Z,"Thanks for uploading again!
Confirming it works, scanners give false positives most likely."
,nighttarga,2011-06-11T15:37Z,"Hosting a server today and probably tomorw aswell.

Hamachi:

ingame: well, join with my Hamachi ID:

and by the way, this is an awsome toreent, yes the virus scanners go nuts, buts a false positive, completely awsome torrent."
,miguelsz3,2011-06-11T23:49Z,I really dislike it when people start spamming servers =/
,AsplosiveForce,2011-06-12T06:35Z,"Avira found a malware on Terraria.exe

Odd."
,AsplosiveForce,2011-06-12T06:40Z,"Also, can't run the app."
,miguelsz3,2011-06-12T07:09Z,"Have you installed both Microsoft XNA 4 and Microsoft .Net 4? That should fix the program not starting up.

P.S.
The setup and apparently the NFO Viewer creates alot of false positives, though it is safe to run =/"
,AsplosiveForce,2011-06-12T07:14Z,"Nevermind. It was a false alarm.
I disabled my antivirus, installed it and it works just fine.

Thanks!"

,himan95,2011-06-12T15:13Z,"Why Terraria THETA versions always have this trojan TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen2 ?

A clean 1.03 version exists so I'll wait for that one"
,himan95,2011-06-12T15:22Z,I found clean 1.04 version on dmnoid...
,himan95,2011-06-12T15:24Z,Clean 1.04 version exists on another torrent site
,himan95,2011-06-12T15:25Z,Clean 1.04 version exists
,miguelsz3,2011-06-12T19:18Z,"There a reason you posted 4 times? 

P.S.
The game is clean the problem is that most of Theta's software nowadays creates a buttload of false postives."

Please dont try to connect to the serves posted on here. They are spam and my guess is that it wouldn't be the greatest idea in the world.

Please go here if you want to find a server to play online. Its a list of servers from the official forums.

,GeneralTso92,2011-07-04T22:12Z,"Notcie how the end of alot of the viruses end with .gen?

Generic.
