Modern Russian Grammar: A Practical Guide is an innovative reference guide to Russian, combining traditional and function-based grammar in a single volume.
The Grammar is divided into two parts. Part A covers traditional grammatical categories such as agreement, nouns, verbs and adjectives. Part B is carefully organized around language functions covering all major communication situations.

With a strong emphasis on contemporary usage, all grammar points and functions are richly illustrated with examples. Main features of the Grammar include:

clear explanations

emphasis on areas of particular difficulty for learners of Russian, such as numerals and verbs of motion

extensive cross-referencing between the different sections.

This is the ideal reference grammar for learners of Russian at all levels, from beginner to advanced. No prior knowledge of grammatical terminology is assumed and a glossary of grammatical terms is provided.
