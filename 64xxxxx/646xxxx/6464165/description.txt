BOOK INFO:

Follow along with author Steve Sande and learn how to make useful, attractive Web sites with iWeb '09 and '11!

Apple's iWeb aims to help you build an attractive Web site quickly and easily, but not all of iWeb's features are fully explained. For step-by-step instructions and plenty of time-saving tips, turn to Web pro Steve Sande. In this ebook, Steve walks you through all the steps for building an iWeb site and uploading it to MobileMe or to another Web host. You can look over his shoulder as he enhances iWeb's templates with a designer's eye, using tools like masks, reflections, and Instant Alpha.

Steve teaches you the best ways to make all types of iWeb pagesâ€”including blog, podcast, photo, and movie pagesâ€”and he covers topics that go beyond the basics and way beyond the online help. You'll also find coverage of how to import podcasts and videos and even get ideas for working with CafePress and Google Checkout to create an online store.

Special projects covered in the ebook include:

Creating graphical effects like those in the above images
Setting a graphic's background color to match the page color
