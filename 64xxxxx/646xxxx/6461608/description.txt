Review

I borrowed this CD two weeks ago, and it was an instant revelation. I had heard
things from Norwegian percussionist Terje Isungset, but this album really is
something else. Karl Seglem plays sax, ram's horn, voice and electronics. The
two musicians create a kind of music you've never heard before : tribal,
intense, furious, melodic, mad, frantic, explosive, rhythmic, intimate,
expansive, hypnotic, joyful, sad, ... and all that in a very compact format. The
whole CD consists of 12 tracks of which only two last longer than 5 minutes. The
major feat of this music is that it is absolutely impossible to classify, yet
extremely coherent and unique in it's own approach. All pieces are totally
different, but they all speak the same (new) musical language. It is so utterly
creative and at the same time so accessible and avant-garde and
out-of-this-world that it's hard to compare to anything I know.

All I can say is : get your copy of it!
