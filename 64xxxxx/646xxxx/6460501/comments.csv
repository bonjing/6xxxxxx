,honunet,2011-06-12T05:54Z,"Bullshit, monsterbeck is a spammer that is the same fucking broken torrent that is floating around everywhere else.  Goes to 99.9 percent and holds, it has no seeders, ever and over a hundred leechers.  Is a rar file and will not extract .  I suspect even if it did, you would discover its horsheshit.  

Episode 10 is worthless, since they spend an hour talking about last weeks episode where apparently there was a huge blowout.  So naturally this is the one nobody has."
,monsterbeck,2011-06-12T12:55Z,"Well I was just coming on here to tell everyone that the torrent link I posted for ep9 only goes to 99.9% so don't bother downloading, but I see honunet beat me to it!  Chill out mate, seek some anger management - mine was an honest mistake and not spam at all - just trying to help out all the other housewive fans."
,)m3ga,2011-06-12T16:49Z,"PLEASE LOAD EP 9
9 PLEASE"
,monsterbeck,2011-06-13T17:09Z,"Peeps, the above link goes to 100% now."
,)m3ga,2011-06-14T17:15Z,"why nobody is uploading episode 9?? come on, please load EP9"
,honunet,2011-06-16T14:31Z,"i usually dont stream but you can actually, legitimately watch it here: http://www.free-tv-video-online.me/player/megavideo.php?id=2K9CVVYB
