,defendor,2011-10-26T20:51Z,Brilliant upload :)! Thanks a million
,bsnalex,2011-11-19T20:44Z,"Is this the same as the movie ""Senna""?"
,tusser_NOR,2011-12-27T15:20Z,"To clarify, this video has 2 audio channels(one regular english and one commentary)

Thanks for the upload!"
,tusser_NOR,2011-12-28T20:39Z,"I personally wouldn't recommend this version though, the interviews are inserted directly and very much breaks the flow of the movie, and makes the commentator track pretty erratic. Its watchable though."
,Toon36,2012-01-14T17:43Z,"A&V on PC are excellent.
But I can't play the movie with the WD TV mediaplayer... installed latest firmware and removed all audio with MKVmerge.
Still the WD TV freezes completely and has to be reset..
It's the first time I experience this problem.
Anyone who knows the way around..?"
