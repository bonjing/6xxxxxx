Geometric Theory of Dynamical Systems: An Introduction
By J. Jr. Palis, W. de Melo


Publisher:   Springer
Number Of Pages:   198
Publication Date:   1982-08-18
ISBN-10 / ASIN:   0387906681
ISBN-13 / EAN:   9780387906683
This book grew from courses and seminars taught at IMPA and several other 
institutions both in Brazil and abroad, a first text being prepared for the 
Xth Brazilian Mathematical Colloquium. With several additions, it later 
became a book in the Brazilian mathematical collection Projeto Euclides, 
published in Portuguese. A number of improvements were again made for 
the present translation. 
We are most grateful to many colleagues and students who provided us 
with useful suggestions and, above all, encouragement for us to present these 
introductory ideas on Geometric Dynamics. We are particularly thankful 
to Paulo Sad and, especially to Alcides Lins Neto, for writing part of a first 
set of notes, and to Anthony Manning for the translation into English.
