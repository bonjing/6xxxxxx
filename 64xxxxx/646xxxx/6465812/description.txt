French disco mixer Dimitri From Paris likes to dig deep in his crates, so his hour-long mix of classics from the '70s disco label turns out to be half-history lesson and half-collectors' crawl. Beginning with a rare-ish Salsoul Orchestra/Loleatta Holloway collaboration ("Seconds"), My Salsoul skips quite a few of the label's highlights to focus on tracks from obscurists like Rafael Cameron, Carol Williams, and Skyy (the latter's "Here's to You" is present in a Dimitri From Paris remix). Most of the rare songs aren't worth hearing -- major exception: the intense Walter Gibbons remix of Holloway's "Catch Me on the Rebound" -- and though Dimitri does spin a pair of acknowledged classics ("Ten Percent" by Double Exposure and "Let No Man Put Asunder" by First Choice; toward the end, natch), he also turns in the most ephemeral entry in the label's entire catalog: Charo's horridly tacky "Love Boat Theme." My Salsoul never fails to evoke the disco era, for better and for worse -- fans of the sound who haven't heard the vintage Salsoul mix Disco Boogie, Vol. 1 will want to proceed there first.
