`This is about humility as the deepest kind of realism. It will resonate profoundly with all who are hungry for truth ...' From the Foreword by. Archbishop Rowan WilliamsIn our celebrity-obsessed culture, humility is unfashionable and too often dismissed or confused with the cringeing, false humility of Uriah Heep. When genuine humility is energised by real passion, fresh and exciting light is shone on the challenge of following Jesus Christ today and humility is rediscovered as a healthy and life-giving virtue, capable of transforming our Blame-Someone-Else society.
