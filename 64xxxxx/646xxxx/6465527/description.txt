Aquarian Dream moved from Buddah to Elektra with their second album, Fantasy. With lead vocalist Gloria Jones having left the band, a new singer, Sylvia Striplin, was added. (Striplin would be gone by the third album, Chance to Dance). Despite changing labels and undergoing some personnel changes, however, Dream hadnâ€™t changed their sound much; this LP is fairly similar to its predecessor, Norman Connors Presents Aquarian Dream. Connors can take some of the credit for that â€” the producer knew how he thought Aquarian Dream should sound, and on sleek, Connors-produced material such as â€œGentle Thoughts,â€ â€œDo You Realize,â€ and the Earth, Wind & Fire-flavored â€œYouâ€™re a Star,â€ his guidance clearly serves the band well. Arguably, Fantasy is Aquarian Dreamâ€™s finest album, but even so, it wasnâ€™t the commercial breakthrough that the band was hoping for.
