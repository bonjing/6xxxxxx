,golfpro,2011-06-11T12:36Z,Those Hard Coded Korean subs are pretty annoying. Maybe wait for one without (unless you're Korean that is).

,datagrab,2011-06-11T14:15Z,wow good thing for koreans huh?
,Dokajan,2011-06-11T14:33Z,"@golfpro Man, can't you just turn them off in your player?"
,severed1314,2011-06-11T14:48Z,"lol HARD CODED means you can't turn them off. 

Thanks but I'll wait for a better one. ;)"
,fefefkers,2011-06-11T15:02Z,"@Dokajan, are you an idiot? how can someone turn off HARD CODED subs from a player, duh!"
,deadlifts,2011-06-11T17:13Z,"too bad for the korean subs. i like watching my movies with english subs, but since you can't turn them off, it'll look like a mess"
,issaq,2011-06-11T18:09Z,thanks for the upload but i`ll wait 
,issaq,2011-06-11T18:15Z,"this one is without the hardcoded sub

,issaq,2011-06-11T18:16Z,(sub free ) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6462099/Source_Code_2011_BRRip_READNFO_XViD-TDP
,issaq,2011-06-11T18:22Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6462099/Source_Code_2011_BRRip_READNFO_XViD-TDP   .((((no sub)))
,oak415,2011-06-12T02:19Z,"Dude issaq, the reason Why there's not subs on that one is because it's been cropped. Not really an improvement"
,jkeller80,2011-06-12T06:30Z,This is better than the cropped version for sure.  Korean subtitles are a bit big but not as bad as missing 25% of the screen.
,f.kruger,2011-06-29T20:53Z,thanks for the up TV team. A9 V9 Plays well looks great and you can learn Korean!!!! Beast version out there
