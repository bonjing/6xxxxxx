Watch out, this isn't a false postive
@nikita200 i use file insight, and scan a lot of keygens, cracks, loaders etc. and lots of them pass. Saying that it is flagged because it's a keygen or named a ""keygen"" does not fly with me. Norton passes lots of these, but they don't pass this one"

It showed the same Infostealer.Gamepass It will crack your superantispyware and you will get a lifetime subscription, but after I used it I had a problem with malware constantly showing up in my temp files and after i cleaned up, it just kept coming back"

,rusmafia,2011-08-13T21:50Z,"Just download from the superantispyware website and chose ""FREE EDITION"", it is problably THE BEST program , so why not go original, instead of risk of virus, when its FREE .
