""No time to encode"" you meant.
 You're right, I'm busy right now with encoding The Lord of the Rings trilogy 1080 multi and only in about a week I'll do this one as it was requested by patbb ( a fateful pirate fan of mine ;-)
@insinuendo
It is indeed, it's good someone gave me the tip.

Some people prefer an untouched & un-shrinked Blu-ray. I've seen myself many BDRips encoded in a rush with low encoding settings. Very few (maybe only 10%) do a proper encoding resulting in lossless image quality. Especially in dark scenes one can detect the faults in the ""cheap"" encodings.

It's sad that such few full Blu-rays are uploaded over here (a tracker with millions of visitors) while small pvt sites with only apx 40.000 members have 5 times more BD-s (thx to the selfish vampires who hit and run)."
,jenchai,2011-06-15T15:13Z,"@mkvonly: Ok, great to know a encoded version will be there soon. I hope its 1080p. Been waiting for it.

Thanks for all the hard work. Cheers !!!"

On my 112 cm diagonal Panasonic full HD TV I see no difference between the BD and 900p rip quality.

In the other hand more people could play 900p who can't play 1080p on their system."
