Artist: MU
Title: MU 
Genre: Psychedelic Rock
Country: US

Mu \"Compilation\" \"Disk 1 - California 1971-1972\" \"Disk 2 - Hawaii 1974\" {USA} [70\'s] (Psych)
A Merrel Fankhauser band that I prefer to love due to the Jeff Cotton days (aka Jeff Cotton of Captain Beefheart\'s Magic Band).

Disk 1 is great (lots of Jeff Cotton influences) 12 tracks of brilliance that hold beats similar to the Beef himself (imho Cpt Beefheart is the most inventive musician ever). I would say that Disk 1 of this is an Essential for anyone interested in Psych music.

Disk 2 however loses Cotton and (although ok) is not what I would call essential. By this time Mu had become more of a Merrel Fankhauser project and I am not truly a fan of his (although I have all the recorded works of his that I know of).
I remember my friend at school having an album Lemurian Legends and cannot find any references to this at all on the www so if anyone knows anything about the Lemurian Legends album I will be grateful. Hi \"Tab\" if you are out there and looking here - Thanks for all the sounds back then when we were 17 or 18.
We were at the Brinkburn Grammar School in England (oops - I forgot - This is about Mu - Not my checkered past).
