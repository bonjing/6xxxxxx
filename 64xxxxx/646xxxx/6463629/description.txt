    eteran movie tough guy Mark Stevens both starred and directed in         
    Escape from Hell Island. He plays the skipper of a Florida merchant      
    boat who smuggles in Cuban refugees as a sideline. When a woman is       
    killed while escaping, Stevens loses his license. He then becomes        
    involved with Linda Scott, wife of the violently jealous Jack Donner.    
    Donner charters Stevens' boat, intending to murder him--but it's         
    Donner who winds up in Davy Jones' locker.
