,Ulrich1984,2011-06-14T22:47Z,"Hi,
thanks for this great torrent. But I have a big problem:
I live in Austria, and therefore I use German JAWS. Today, JAWS 12 was released in German. But unfortunately, the version number is 12.0.1619. So I copied and overwrote the files successfully, and I only get an error message when I start JAWS. I think due to the version number differences, the crack for 12.0.1158 doesn't work with Jaws 12.0.1619. Could anyone please try to get a crack for the 12.0.1619? I think this is only for the German JAWS version, because on the English FS website, there is JAWS 12.0.1161. I experienced that the first time that in German, there is a higher build number than in English JAWS. So, I would need a crack for JAWS 12.0.1619 if possible in 32 and 64 Bit please.

Regards,
ulrich1984"

I will look around but, cannot make any promises.  I recommend that you restore your old installation until a verified German crack has been found.
My apologies if you assumed that this crack was intended for your German JFW.

Thanks"

Receive following error message when running jaws after changes have been applied:  ""a referral was returned from the server.""  Tried repairing JFW, then disconnecting from internet.  Received same message after crack was applied again.  Any thoughts?"

,blindlife,2011-09-02T14:44Z,"hi, there is bad news, this crack doesn't work on windows7 64 bit. anyone who knows anything about a working crack for this version?
Regards"
,bzrkr,2011-09-22T20:19Z,"this worked for me on win 7 64bit..  but you must do the following:

Disable User Account Control in windows 7
install JAWS with a custom set-up (not typical) and uncheck the remote server options
copy over only the cracked jfw.exe not the jhook.dll file

should work"
,Deon588,2011-09-30T09:47Z,Seeing as this torrent has had seeders since it was uploaded i'm assuming someone got it to work?  If so please add a comment explaining how.  BRZRKR that doesn't work the only reason your not hearing the activation window when starting JAWS is because it's the jaws runtime so nothing will be read.
,blindlife,2011-10-28T16:01Z,"the crack tip didn't work, it just hang itself and you couldn't do anything at all, there must be something wrong with the modified jfw.exe"
,AlMaArri,2011-12-06T19:01Z,"Good news. Jaws for windows V13, 32 bit,  is now available at https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6868581/JAWS_FOR_WINDOWS_V13.0.527_32-bit_with_crack"
,Ocyro,2012-04-21T06:45Z,"I am running Windows7 Pro, Altered the UAC setting, replaced the jfw file. The dll is not needed in 64bit. After installed and cracked Jaws states ""NO Active Window"" However if you open the demo version, then close the demo version, replace the jfw file and then open the crack jfw file the application works perfectly until reboot. Any one that can help please post."
