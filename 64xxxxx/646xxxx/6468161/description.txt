[color=lime]Arguably the greatest jazz saxophonist of all time, Charlie Parker permanently changed jazz. His spontaneous phrases became the vocabulary of post-1945 jazz, many of his ideas from 60 years ago still sound futuristic and he could play extremely rapid lines in his solos which, if slowed down to half speed, reveal themselves to be both very coherent and consistently creative. He is credited, along with Dizzy Gillespie, as the co-founder of bebop, but in reality his unpredictable improvisations were far beyond the beboppish playing of his countless number of followers. 
Parker, who was known throughout much of his life as "Bird," was born in Kansas City, Kansas in 1920 although he grew up in nearby Kansas City, Missouri. He dropped out of school when he was 14 because he wanted to be a professional musician but his technique at that point on alto was far behind his ideas. After a lot of woodshedding, by the time he joined Jay McShann's in 1937, he was ready. It took a few more years for him to completely develop but by 1940, when he made his recording debut with McShann, his technique was astounding and fresh ideas seemed to constantly pour out of him. He came to New York with McShann, met Dizzy Gillespie and worked next to Dizzy in the big bands of Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine. By the time he made his first session for Savoy as a sideman with guitarist Tiny Grimes in 1944, Parker's style was fully formed. During the 11 years he had left before his premature death, Bird led classic sessions for the Savoy, Dial and Verve labels.
