BOOK INFO:

Turn it up to 11: get creative and make music with GarageBand's loops!

Seattle composer and musician Jeff Tolbert turns it up to â€™11 with step-by-step tutorials that guide you through creating five different songs using GarageBandâ€™s built-in loops, including two brand-new tutorials covering creative loop-mangling and ringtone creation. In this book, Jeff not only explains how to use GarageBand's editing and mixing features but also how to be playful and creative while composing. You'll learn how to plan a song, edit and arrange Real and Software Instrument loops in imaginative ways, create exciting mixes, and export your masterpieces.

The book also covers automating track volume, tempo, and panning to create more dynamic recordings, and getting the most out of the GarageBand effects. It also teaches you how to customize Magic GarageBand songs and includes helpful suggestions for solving performance problems.

Bonus! Linked-in audio lets you listen to examples while you workâ€”you can even download the actual GarageBand project files used to create the tutorials in the book! To round it all off, a five-page glossary helps you quickly learn music-related terms.
