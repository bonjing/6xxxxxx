,Brandonw1994,2011-08-15T14:41Z,"i looked into what i was talking about earlier and i think i sorta understand it now that when the blue and red bars are mixed it jus means that ""RED means the piece is not available within the group of peers you are connected to"" thats what i found out and now im jus woundering if its true?"
