ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and
blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.



This nice article discusses a very nice topic. It discusses the meaning of Allah\'s name: An-Nur (the Light). No doubt lots of Muslims did not read about its meaning due to its being obvious but we should take much care of knowing any aspect of Islam even if we think it is very clear. Dr. Saleh As-Saleh explains its meaning through explaining the verse in which it is mentioned in Surat An-Nur.
