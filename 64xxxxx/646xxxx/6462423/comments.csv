,diegothedrummer1,2011-07-02T01:57Z,"Habetino says it took 2 days to download, but you said ""very fast Download."" Is two days considered ""very fast"" compared to normal upload time? Im kinda afraid to download it if it takes that long. I hate when i spend so much time downloading and then have it not work."
