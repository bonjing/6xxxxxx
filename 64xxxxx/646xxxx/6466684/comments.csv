poor quality cam and the audio has some hiss, i'm fussy though, if you don't mind cam's then go for it, if you're getting this for your kids, wait for a better one, remember you're prob gonna have to watch this a few hundred times in a row"

A=7+
V=7+ or 8"
,Abys-Maul,2011-07-20T14:29Z,"The best so far? Really? Almost makes it worth paying for! Unwatchable!

A4 V3 

If you're used to cams then this is just as shit as them, you'll probably like it. For everyone else, wiat for the rip!"
