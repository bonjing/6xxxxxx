- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  With somewhat of a fresh start, Life On Repeat are preparing to spread their
  infectious brand of pop-rock with melodic hooks, dance-able beats and driving
  guitars in the form of a digital EP, As I Grew, recorded with producer Brian
  McTernan (Thrice, Circa Survive, Senses Fail) in August and released on
  December 1, 2009. "He's responsible for so many successful albums that each of
  us grew up listening to. When we heard that we had the opportunity to record
  with him, it was a no-brainer," explained Walker.

  "Upon leaving the studio, we wish to not see home for months at a time, no
  matter what it takes," Baylis expressed what could possible be the band's
  mantra. Striving to perfect their craft not only in the studio, but more
  importantly live, self-booked tours have kept the band on the road for over
  two years, including shows with Versa Emerge, Dance Gavin Dance, The Ataris,
  and more. Life On Repeat played all 6 dates of Cornerstone Festival 2009.
  While consistent touring is an essential ingredient for the recipe of any
  successful band, it was a much bigger requirement for the quintet. "In a
  nutshell, there is no music scene in Salisbury; the closest venues are about 2
  hours away. We rented out halls and churches to hold our own shows," Walker
  described. "Throughout the past year or so, we've basically established our
  own local scene through the shows we've set up."

  Of the signing to Equal Vision Records, the band says, "Equal Vision has not
  only launched the careers of many highly respected artists, but they have
  maintained a work ethic that continues to prove they are here to stay. From
  day one, we aspired to be involved with a label that is, in every way, able to
  properly have our music heard. We couldn't be more excited for what the future
  holds with Life On Repeat and EVR."
