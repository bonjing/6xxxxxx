,axemblack,2011-06-14T22:17Z,"mr kickass, you're torrents are awesome! I will always look to see if you have released the film before I download another one...

I have a request, please upload 'Lawrence of Arabia' (1962), there are only crappy or oversized copies that I can find so far. Thanks!!"
,axemblack,2011-06-15T17:06Z,"thanks hitman but I already saw that one, it is a very poor rip. its a 3.5hr movie there no way you could fit that into a 700mb file at 720p, even with MKV. just check the screens, they are very blurry. thanks anyway, i'll wait for a Kickass copy :)"

What happened to you?
You were uploading a lot of old classics earlier.
But now considering your last 30 uploads only 2 of them were before 2000.
YIFY  & Stylishsalh were uploading usually the new generation movies.
But they also did movies like
Ran [1985]
The Seventh Seal [1957]
Gone With The Wind [1939]
Dr. Strangelove (1964)
The Thing (1982)
Citizen Kane (1941)
Once Upon A Time In America (1984)
etc.
They understood that there is a very large audience for old classics.
But why are you reluctant to work on the classics.
This is a request."

Limitless
Hanna
Sanctum
on piratebay as soon as possible please."
,donk1664,2011-08-19T05:16Z,"As usual KickAss does just that. Yet again he delivers a torrent of 10/10 pic and audio. Other uploaders get their ass kicked by him in terms of what a quality torrent should be.

Keep up the good work!"
