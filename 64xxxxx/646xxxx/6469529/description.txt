The first of a series of three films directed by Veber and starring Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu. Instead of the more recent Francois Pignon, we have FranÃ§ois Perrin, who comes off as a French Schlepprock.

A French/Mexican co-production, we have the odd situation where almost everybody in Mexico speaks French, even when not asked to.  The strangest thing is that continuity fails a bit, when there actually are characters who do not speak French. I don't think a single one even attempts to speak French with a Mexican accent.

Don't let that little nitpick stop you from enjoying this quite enjoyable film.

A clutzy accountant is hired as a detective to find a lost clutz of a girl.  The logic astounds me as much as it did Depardieu's character. 

Fairly insubstantial extras make most of the data the film itself.
