If this was on purpose or a virus I don't know but i'm warning against downloading if you are looking for #80 This is most likely not it.  Please check your Resources before uploading if this was an accident.

,MonJoh,2011-09-03T13:09Z,"Hello!
I'm looking for Issues #75 and #76, anyone got'em?
Demonoid has a pack 00-75 but I'm not really interested in DLing 00-74 twice, and no trace of #76 there either...
Can help? "
