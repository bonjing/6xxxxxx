,LFXTrader,2011-06-17T13:53Z,9down.com has the pro version.
,LFXTrader,2011-06-17T14:12Z,"some random useless comment that adds no value, and the one that did was deleted by redr4agon"
,darkchild1,2011-06-20T20:33Z,"works great, thanks"
,Aurasan,2011-07-21T19:20Z,"freeware is useless when you have to download it from adobe's site and the install frigs up every time.. so you go to a place like this to d/l the program (already installed somewhere) enabling you to actually USE said freeware.
in summary:
blow it out your ass, jersson"
,PERFECTSHOT,2011-07-23T00:45Z,Hey Jersson. I can tell you are new and idiot. Yes it free from adobe but you will have to download it every time you want to install it. This you only need to download once.  
,surferbroadband,2011-07-31T22:27Z,"The reason for having a torrent version on Pirate Bay is that some WiFi spots block www.adobe.com so that is a problem. But on the flip side www.thepiratebay.org is not blocked. Yeah the world is messed up place ( I don't use profanity ) and sometimes something that does not seem ""logical"" (as Mr. Spock would say to Dr. Mc Coy) is actually very logical."

,Saki33,2011-09-24T13:39Z,"Obnoxious comments knocking someone who points out that this is the free version are misinformation. You do not need to download the free version from Adobe every time you want to download a PDF. You only need to download and install it once. There will be periodic updates to download, and it's a good idea to download them to protect against viruses. There is a link to download Reader on web sites that offer PDF files, but you only need to do that if you don't already have it installed. Maybe that is why some people mistakenly think they need to download it again. If you don't have Reader installed, the safest place to download it is at Adobe's web site. The only reason to download this is if you are blocked from Adobe's web site, and if you don't already have the free version installed."

,bluephoenix71,2011-10-26T16:22Z,"I have gone to adobe's site and downloaded 10.1.1 or adobe x....

the problem is that I can't still open the pdf files and it is saying that adobe is still running in the background so needs to shut it down first..

i have reloaded several times, still the same... so I ended up looking for an older version like adobe 9.x.x

any ideas? mine is windows 7 64 bit..."
,bluephoenix71,2011-10-26T16:35Z,"installed x again...

,khannies3,2011-11-02T14:22Z,"If you think this is freeware or of no use, then who insisted you to come here and download from this torrent. It show's your personality that to what catogory you belong. If you can appreciate someone for something then you dont deserve to insult him. (No Offense , But try to make yourself  a Good. :))"
,elektralicious,2011-11-08T10:43Z,Thank you so much... :)
,gxfjlvg,2011-11-15T16:18Z,"Thank you very much! Very helpful of you top post it here, Adobe asks 3 business days to send you a link for a free software!?. Works great, distributed through the company very easily."
,Aqash,2011-12-06T11:37Z,"@RedDr4gon Thanks Dude....its pretty helping torrent....and the guy down there he is right....
if you'll have to download it every time from Adobe to install it....but from here you'll only have to download it once....

So, Much Thanks From Pakistan...."
,.M3th,2011-12-07T10:57Z,"I hate the comments saying its ""freeware"" an to download it from the website.
Maybe i dont have internet on another pc that i want this installed on, an the Adobe Website only gives you the launcher or whatever to download the complete file. Which you have to be connected to the internet to do so.
Idiot//"
