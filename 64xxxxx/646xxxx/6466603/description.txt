Product Description
Representing Health addresses the importance of the media in shaping and reflecting public perceptions and attitudes to health and illness. Bringing together contributions from a variety of academic disciplines, this lively text examines contemporary theoretical debates and analyzes media as diverse as television, cinema, literature, print media and the Internet. Centring around themes of 'virtual' bodies, audiences, representations and public health, it examines discourses of sexuality, gender, race, disability, childhood, medico-moral panics, regulation and governmentality.
