British comedy legend and star of The Fast Show, Down The Line and Bellamy's People, Simon Day debuts his own BBC Radio 4 character comedy show.

 Simon performs as Northern poet Geoffrey Allerton, popular blazered entertainer Tommy Cockles, eco-warrior Dave Angel, reformed violent criminal Tony Beckton, opinionated Billy Bleach, and as himself.

 In each episode one of Simon's characters come to perform at The Mallard, a small provincial theatre somewhere in the UK. We hear the highlights of that night's show, along with the back stage and front of house goings on at the theatre itself.
