[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-15T00:47Z,"This film is called ""5 Days of WAR"""
,indaBlack,2011-06-15T01:25Z,5 Days of August is the original title...sigh
,reazonable,2011-06-15T11:58Z,As an ethnic Russian I want to punch the director of this in the face just after looking at that poster.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-15T13:28Z,"5 Days of August is the Georgian title. 5 Days of War is the title the rest of the world gets.

To me, that makes this 5 DAYS OF WAR."
,bigghands,2011-06-15T19:31Z,thats because Georgia saw this as an OCCUPATION while the rest of the world saw this as WAR.  Movie looks good though.
,GEORGIAN,2011-06-16T01:31Z,"...and as a GEORGIAN i'll F**CK you and your PUTIN ""DEAR"" rusian.

,vienya,2011-08-04T13:48Z,Gerogian are vampires who drink blood of minorities. In Georiga is no freedom for simple things. Georgia is a deeply fucked by own president Saakaishvili and fucking fashistisch people of sympel Georgian mentality. Abhaziers & Osetiers and other small nations suffering from Georgian dictatorship. Georgia is a criminaile country which must be condemned in the Hague Tribunal. The film is pure propaganda.
