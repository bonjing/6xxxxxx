*** This review may contain spoilers ***

While the special effects are entertaining in some cases, that is far, far overwhelmed by the sheer exaggerations, assumptions, and out right fabrications perpetrated by the creators of this farce. This program is clearly geared to evoke a variety of politically correct responses to the fuzzy and questionable pseudo-science prevalent in society today.

Firstly, the way humanity ""steps off this mortal coil"" makes a huge, tremendous difference in how events would play out. Simply vanishing is a dramatic but narrow-minded way to captivate the viewer and instills a ""do not question"" attitude that, again, is so prevalent with pseudo-science.

We are shown elephants in a suburban neighborhood where all the trees are denuded. This would be understandable if the elephants were late comers to the feast, but they are first arrivals. It is June, but the filming must have been done in autumn or very early spring. Just lousy editing.

We are shown lions hunting a baboon in a playground and the poor felines can't get the ape because it's on a plastic tube-slide. However, the slide comes off a wooden play structure that has a flight of stairs, but we're expected to believe the lions are such lousy hunters they don't circle the structure and go up the stairs.

We are told that ""birds fly south and more will survive this year"" because the lights in the cities are off. The narrator explains that birds navigate by the stars and in cities at night many ""circle the buildings till they tire and die."" Now, I've seen a dead bird or two in cities, but the suggestion here would have us find hundreds or thousands every morning. It's patently ridiculous.

Many of the mechanical catastrophes depicted seem on the whole accurate, however, since most people do not visit their Waste Water Facilities they are unaware of how they work and this shockumentary takes advantage of that ignorance to outright lie about it's failure.

Further, there is a claim, directly from the EPA and the IPCC, that automobiles pump out 19 pounds of CO2 per gallon of gasoline. Now, the fuzzy pseudo-science crowd adore the EPA and IPCC mainly because these agencies do not use the scientific method when doing science. They start from a solution and work backwards to prove it as opposed to asking the question and experimenting to determine the answer. Gasoline is basically 8 Carbons with 18 Hydrogen. In one pound of gasoline there is about 0.84 pounds Carbon and when burned in the combustion engine combines with about 2.24 pounds Oxygen to become 3.08 pounds of CO2, nowhere near 19 pounds.

Why is it, the pseudo-science crowd always lies about their claims? They'd get more mileage from the truth, but then they wouldn't get any money from the average Joe who can't be bothered to study the real science.

Watch this movie for the entertainment value, but please, please, please educate yourself and your children as you watch so you don't get caught believing the hype and dogma."
