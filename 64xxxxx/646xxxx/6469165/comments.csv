,ipay4U,2011-06-30T20:34Z,@EmesiS who said it was a new one? 
,EmesiS,2011-07-02T03:58Z,"No one did...but why list a torrent that's already on TPB. It just makes it look like it might be a new version. That's the first thing I thought when I saw the listing. So what's your reason for listing an old torrent?
