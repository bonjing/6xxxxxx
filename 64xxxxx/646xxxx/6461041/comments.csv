If you make music in guitar pro and/or want to practice individual tracks from other bands you can select individual tracks and just convert everything and exclude the guitars, take the mp3's with you to practise anywhere. Its awesome. The finished converted files sounds a bit more real than midi, like GP's RSE.

Thanks for the upload, you rock!"
