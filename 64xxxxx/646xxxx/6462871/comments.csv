,raptor215,2011-06-13T06:08Z,whatever happened to cat and the rest? do they still model? there was a guy on here that used to upload the sets unfortunatley they were only half sets and it ended just as they got good...he is gone now apparantly along with most of the other good uploaders.

,Terry666,2011-06-13T13:38Z,All 40 as preview except 1 include the knees...
,Ioxen,2011-06-13T17:30Z,"raptor, as i understand it, he was an employee, if not the director of pr, for the site as his handle was Bmodels, and he uploaded nothing other than preview sets, which I and others enjoyed, cat being their star IMO. 
i would imagine he got banned or left when the shit hit the fan, and TPB got an agenda to rid the 603 of anything under 18, even those who were only fingered for uploading both child and adult modelling. For those watching the events, its clear it was a witch hunt. the conservatives won, most posters have left. RIP TPB, RIP tikibob, your missed bud."
