This here is the collection of the covers for DC # 1 issues of upcoming series,

which I don't know if they would be regular series,but they should start in

september. You'll see characters from wildstorm which have their own issues,like

Grifter and Voodoo,and you'll see new stormwatch where Apollo and Midnighter are 

standing alongside Martian Manhunter...so they have intergrated wildstorm 

characters into DC universe...but you'll also see revamped characters like

Ressurection man or Nightwing...I don't know but with what I'm seeing there is a lot 

of possibilities - check it out!
