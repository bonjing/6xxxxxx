The rain let up just before showtime for Central Park's free NY Philharmonic concert (July 2001?).  It was by far the best of the Concerts in the Parks that I have ever attended (that's me way in the back).  :-)  As far as I know, the filmed version only aired once on PBS and I was fortunate enough to capture it in VHS.  Sorry for the poor resolution--even so, it was a thrilling peformance.
