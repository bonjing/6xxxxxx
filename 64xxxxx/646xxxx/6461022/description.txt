GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series Race 7 - Watkins Glen - June 4, 2011

This is the 30th annual "Six Hours of the Glen" endurance race held at
the Watkins Glen International Raceway in upstate New York on 4June11.

This is the 7th race of the GRAND-AM Rolex Sports Car Series season of
2011. This type of racing is unique in that there are four different
classes of sports cars racing on the track at the same time, including
the Daytona Prototype and GT classes. 

The program spans about 6.5 hours but the video is about 2 hours 45
minutes in length. Edited out are all of the commercials, station
breaks, promos, and anything that isn't directly related to the race.
What remains is encoded into H.264 at 5000kbps with 160kbps audio and
combined into a Matroska container. The resolution is 1280x720.

The quality of the video is pretty good. But unfortunately there were
a few intermittent audio sync problems at about 40 minutes remaining
in the race. This is referenced to the time-remaining countdown clock
that appears at the top of the screen. The worst problems occur at about
34 minutes remaining. But they don't last long are quickly passed by.
