i don't like these cat fights between them and to skidrow.... i respect your work, but please dont point out flaws in other releases, you did the same thing with flt.....anyways thanks for this one...although i wouldn't be playing this game again...and remember no more fights..;)"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-06-12T09:25Z,thanks for another great upload +1 rep
,Deadlegend186,2011-06-12T09:42Z,Its a bit of friendly rivalry nice one the skidster
,Tino64,2011-06-12T13:14Z,"@mitulv: Scene releases has always been about competition - who can crack this or that and Nuked releases etc They don`t do it for us the users but who can crack different protections first. 

Maybe different today but that is what started it.... "
,mitulv,2011-06-12T13:45Z,@Tino64...ya you are right....well someday maybe the scenes will think about users and not about being the no.1 cracker...
,AMoveFan,2011-06-12T23:45Z,It doesnt work for me I copy all the crack contents and place them in the installer folder and nothing it copies over everything but it shuts down the game after I try and click into it .
,Ludskiiz,2011-06-16T22:09Z,Everything works except It says I need d3dx9_37.dll to play where can i get this?
,Ludskiiz,2011-06-16T22:28Z,Nevermind I got it and every other .dll files! If you need them here they are... http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6474357
,socialoutcry69,2011-06-24T22:59Z,This crack is crap it undoes all the fixes that razor1911 fixes. The only thing i had problems wiht was the difficulty level being always on the hardest level. this one breaks the quicktime events and everything else
