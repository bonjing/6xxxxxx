BOOK INFO:

Geared toward the adventurous photographer, The Wild Side of Photography provides a rich source of ideas and inspiration for fun projects ranging from clever to unconventional.

Learn to build a shift/tilt lens for your DSLR from an old junkyard 120 film camera, try the camera toss, shoot images from a kite, use a peephole door viewer as a fisheye lens, or build your own pinhole camera. Get ready to capture the perfect aerial shot on your next commercial flight, and to paint beautiful night scenes using a flashlight as a lightbrush.

Author/designer, Cyrill Harnischmacher, brought together 20 international authors and their unique projects to produce this intriguing book.
