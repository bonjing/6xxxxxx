[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-12T11:38Z,"@critic89
Welcome back mate :D
Prison Break, I'd love to do it. but the sources available are >30GB. need two months to get it finished and nearly a month to upload.
My internet has an average speed @200kbps down ( dependent on torrent health). So sorry bro
I'm happy to see you back. I'll keep this in mind. 

@Venadan
Great list bro, I'll try to do them :)
I'm doing Cell 211, Ran, Merantau, etc.
Also I'm getting mixed responses regarding 480p & 720p, lol
But I'm pretty sure that 720p will give many seeders & attention, lol
But I promised my friends that I'll do Adjustment Bureau in 480p. 
It's a nice movie and Matt Damon is excellent.

@rockr191
Can you link a nice source bro ?

@iamno1
Fast five not released in bluray.

NOTE:- 
It's possible to do Adjustment Bureau in 720p under 400MB, but I'm doing it in 480p now. 
.. thanks ..






"
,Jabdy69,2011-06-12T12:04Z,Source Code! Please do it in 550MB at 720p. THNX!
,Venadan,2011-06-12T18:27Z,"@StyLishSaLH
Thanks.
Most of the uploaders don't listen to plea for these films.

But you are different.
I will be waiting for your future uploads.
Any way, thanks for doing such a good work till now."
