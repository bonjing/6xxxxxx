,BadMoonzIsRetarted,2011-06-18T21:57Z,"Is it that big of a deal to extract rar files? Really, is it? I can't believe you would complain about something like that."
,BadMoonz,2011-07-01T15:47Z,"uh yeah it is, why cant it just be an avi?"
,BadMoonz,2011-07-01T15:49Z,"@Skavenuk

you haven't ""contributed fuck"" either pal "
,DieDaily,2011-07-23T15:19Z,"Contribution or not, there was no good reason to RAR this video file. DUH. There used to be valid reasons for using them, but in current times RARs are just stupid for single files. They introduce doubt and possible password protection crap in addition to just being all-round stupid douchery. Next time please de-douche yourself beforehand, so that you can upload just the AVI."
