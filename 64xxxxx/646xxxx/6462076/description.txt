|   Important to Sonic Youth is the modern-day equivalent to the under-        |
|   ground/experimental rock scene they grew from. Yesterday's Theoretical     |
|   Girls and Swans leads to today's Hair Police, today's Wolf Eyes,           |
|   tomorrow's who-knows (Thurston knows, and has his eye on them for a        |
|   release on Ecstatic Peace). Sonic Youth seem intent on keeping in          |
|   spiritual touch with that stream of youthful creative energy, as well as   |
|   the world of cutting-edge art in general, even while being "rock stars"    |
|   releasing albums for a major corporation. Even going back to the band's    |
|   start they've had twin pop culture/underground interests, and an           |
|   obsession with larger-than-life figures both countercultural and           |
|   completely mainstream. Their song title "Total Trash" could easily         |
|   denote both -- the outcasts and the pop stars (see Madonna, Britney        |
|   Spears, etc.). They're walking a line of their own, not between any        |
|   misperceived divide, but among several concurrent, but quite different,    |
|   sides of the art/popular culture continuum.                                |
|                                                                              |
|   Think of the basic Sonic Youth sound, even underneath their most direct    |
|   pop/rock singles ("Dirty Boots", "100%", much of their 2006 album Rather   |
|   Ripped), and it's sheets of guitar, played in an evocative way, using      |
|   noise as a graceful wall that's both a challenge and a force of beauty.    |
|   The element that carries through all the songs, wild and quiet, "pop"      |
|   and experimental, is not those moments when they're wailing on their       |
|   instruments but when they take that same energy and smooth it into a       |
|   super-charged dream-state. This is the invisible energy field tying        |
|   together those disparate worlds ("rock songs" and Goodbye 20th Century,    |
|   arena stages and art galleries, The Carpenters and Nautical Almanac),      |
|   and coursing through their discography.                                    |
|                                                                              |
|   That background-generator sound is called to the front of the stage        |
|   here, on The Destroyed Room. The album opens with this in its purest       |
|   form: an edgy/pretty instrumental titled "Fire Engine Dream" which rides   |
|   one sound for an exhilarating 10 minutes. It's placed upfront so the       |
|   band can, as they write in the liner notes, "see who's here and who's      |
|   not." It's a tone-setter, then, outlining the route the band is taking     |
|   throughout this 76-minute CD. That route is to explore the side of the     |
|   band interested in, as the liner notes also put it, "blurring the lines    |
|   between composition and improvisation", without leaning too far in one     |
|   direction (without, for example, the songs sounding completely like        |
|   "ordinary", composed songs, as they have on their most recent              |
|   albums).They're taking shards of pop melody and pushing them into an       |
|   improvisational/experimental direction, creating textures and ideas.       |
|   They're setting up a room and destroying it, so it's unstable but still    |
|   feels like a room, is both comfortable and dangerous.                      |
|                                                                              |
|   This is Sonic Youth's first Geffen release that heads in this direction    |
|   entirely. Erase that; it might be their first release in this direction,   |
|   as there's still a lingering melodic sheen here (lingering like a cloud)   |
|   that isn't present on most of their experimental, non-Geffen releases      |
|   (the SYR series, for example). Unlike most of those releases, this isn't   |
|   entirely instrumental, either, though it mostly is; three songs feature    |
|   vocals (Kim Gordon on two, Moore on one). The songs are not all of the     |
|   same style, either. Most are off-kilter mood-jams that rage and roll       |
|   with haunted beauty, but others are much different; the album as a whole   |
|   has variety within the adventure trip.                                     |
|                                                                              |
|   The brief "Razor Blade" is a hushed Gordon sung letter over a strange      |
|   country & western mood, with steel guitar even. Gordon's other vocal       |
|   appearance is on the minimalist "Blink", where a skeletal framework sets   |
|   up a complex horror-film mood that's scary, but philosophical, lush, and   |
|   introspective in a way. "Campfire", filled with slithering electronic      |
|   sounds, was performed on a Groovebox machine, commissioned for the         |
|   Tannis Root/Grand Royal At Home With the Groovebox album. The jam "Loop    |
|   Cat" contains many bizarre, hard-to-pin-down soundsâ€¦ though actually the   |
|   whole album is like that. Sonic Youth has always explored unusual          |
|   instrumental set-ups, figuring out different ways to get sounds from the   |
|   basic rock instruments. That's especially evident here, on an album        |
|   where several of the songs were "accidents": songs built by carving an     |
|   evocative side-trip out of an improvisational jam, or by taking a          |
|   particular theme or mood (having the film Two-Lane Blacktop in their       |
|   minds, for example) and following it wherever it leads them.               |
|                                                                              |
|   The Destroyed Room is ostensibly a collection of "B-Sides and Rarities";   |
|   that's the guise under which this was released to the marketplace, and     |
|   some of these songs have appeared before, on various-artists               |
|   compilations or in movie soundtracks. But it feels absolutely like one     |
|   album. It's built-from-leftovers genesis is similar to Tom Waits' recent   |
|   acclaimed Orphans collection, but where that still feels like a randomly   |
|   generated batch of Waits songs, this feels like one cohesive collection.   |
|   It's remarkable, amazing even, how together this album is, how             |
|   everything fits into one overall statement, even while the 11 songs each   |
|   represent an off-road trip with its own singular intentions, or lack       |
|   thereof. In some ways it's one of Sonic Youth's most cohesive albums       |
|   even, as strange as that sounds to say. It's also one of their most        |
|   exciting. It sounds like the wellspring of their creative energy, like a   |
|   wild and naturally formed representation of the inherent elements of       |
|   their music, those that have made them influential and, in their           |
|   combination of pop/rock and experimental/artistic impulses, innovative.    |
|                                                                              |
|   The final of The Destroyed Room's collected side-trips is the full, 26-    |
|   minute version of one of Sonic Youth's grandest pop/experimental           |
|   statements, Washing Machine's "The Diamond Sea". It's the right way to     |
|   end this collection, with a reminder that the band's Geffen Records        |
|   period has not been marked by compromise -- as fans feared back in 1990    |
|   -- but by continued exploration, continually taking them in fresh          |
|   directions. Even as its technically a retread as much as a new release,    |
|   through its cohesive mood, and the exciting pieces that make up the        |
|   whole, The Destroyed Room is yet another fresh new statement, one that     |
|   shines brightly even within the complete, storied discography of Sonic     |
|   Youth.                                                                     |
|                                                                              |
