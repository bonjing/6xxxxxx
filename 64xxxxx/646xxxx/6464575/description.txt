Product Description:

Cambridge First Certificate Writing New Edition combines creative practice of writing skills with systematic training for Paper 2. It contains varied, stimulating activities designed to develop planning, checking and revising techniques, while also providing helpful grammar and vocabulary input and practice. Activities within each themed unit lead towards a fully updated exam-style task which enables students to use their newly acquired writing skills and to familiarise themselves with the exam. The book begins with a Foundation unit to increase awareness of key aspects of writing and concludes with a Review unit which draws together the main techniques presented and practised. The aims of each unit are set out clearly at the start, and students are guided throughout by helpful, illustrated exam tips and study hints.
