,NSRacer,2011-06-11T21:18Z,does it work?
,mickyfinny,2011-06-11T21:25Z,Tested and Yes it does work with version 2.10.
,_SnakEye,2011-06-11T22:26Z,"the full credit belongs to ""mickyfinny"" on his torrent/Credits, I just brought to your attention that it would also work with v2.11 as when mickyfinny submitted his torrent, v2.11 was out already, hence Aerosoft couldn't add those Credits to their black list for that version.
