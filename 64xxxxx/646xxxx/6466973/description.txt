    Tara B. True is a flight attendant who makes a weekly swing through      
    New York, Miami, and Los Angeles. In each city, she has a man:           
    Edward, older and wealthy; Johnny, a beach bum with gambling debts;      
    and, Davey, a rock musician on the cusp of success. Tara is a free       
    spirit, faithful to each man in her own way, and so stunning that she    
    dresses in a wig and ill-fitting uniform while she's working so men      
    won't harass her constantly. The low-life whom Johnny is in debt to      
    figures out a way to use Tara to help him execute a daring in-flight     
    robbery. But will Tara stand by helplessly, or is superchick ready       
    for action?
