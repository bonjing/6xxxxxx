Storyine: Matthew McConaughey stars in this legal thriller as a low-rent defense attorney named Mickey Haller. Most of the time, Mickey barely keeps his head above water, representing low-life clients and working out of the back of his car. He thinks heÃ¢Â€â„¢s landed the case of a lifetime when heÃ¢Â€â„¢s hired to defend a rich playboy who stands accused of rape and attempted murder, and eagerly accepts his new client and the massive payoff thatÃ¢Â€â„¢s sure to come with him. But Mickey soon discovers that heÃ¢Â€â„¢s become ensnared in a twisted plot where no fee in the world is high enough to pay for the deadly workload, and his only hope of survival may just lay in his own skills as a long-practiced double-crosser.
