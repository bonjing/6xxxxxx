Product Description:

 

This book has been designed to serve as a text book for post graduate-students and research workers in earth sciences who require a background of and a feel for statistics and the theory of regionalised variables. The book is titled 'Geostatistics with Applications in Earth Sciences". This new edition has been completely revised to reflect the notable concept - and technique-wise in geostatistics. Chapter 1 has been expanded and incorporates more detials on sampling and sampling designs. Chapters 2 and 5 have been extensively revised and a new chapter "Introduction to Advanced Geostatistics" has been added. Also new are the "Review Questions" at the end of each chapter and the computer codes on the CD-Rom.
