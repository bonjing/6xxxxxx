COMMENTS    :    Ok this is maybe the weirdest bluray ever  when playing this it seems that the movie is dubbed 2 times in the mux which seems to be
the regular because its just like that watching the regular bluray.  After days of tampering with it still comes out the same. Everything
else seems to be just fine but the extra audio in the ac3 seems to be the norm for this release so we are leaving this as is and letting everyone
know before hand.  Sorry if that is a bother but im thinking it was pressed this way as there is nothing we can do.  Thanks
