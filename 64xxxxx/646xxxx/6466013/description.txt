The Chakra Project brings a ground-up Linux distribution, a free software showcase project created by a bunch of people who like the KISS principles of ArchLinux the elegance of KDE and a bundlesystem to support well known Gtk applications.

With a new concept of half-rolling releases, freshly cooked packages and bundles, our graphical tools and a small but strong and diverse community, this is the computing environment you may have been waiting for, especially made for enjoying the KDE Software Compilation, for people who really want to learn something about Linux or dont want to deal with administrative overhead.
