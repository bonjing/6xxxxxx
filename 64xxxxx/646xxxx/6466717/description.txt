BOOK INFO:

Over the past twenty years, stress echocardiography has developed into a well-established technique that is versatile, patient friendly, and relatively inexpensive. This new, extensively revised and enlarged edition of Stress Echocardiography documents all of the very significant advances made since the fourth edition. The early chapters place the technique within a historical context and describe its pathophysiological basis. Thereafter, all aspects of stress echocardiography are discussed, clearly and in detail, by the distinguished pioneer, Eugenio Picano, and other contributors carefully selected for their expertise. Both mainstream and emerging applications are explained, and systematic comparisons with competing and complementary cardiac imaging techniques are provided.
