,adrianlives,2011-06-14T17:45Z,"Hey I have downloaded, installed and copied the program crack into the directory, all is working well so far, I am not 100% sure where I should paste the plugin cracks though, any help here? inside the program, when selecting plugin presets and opening generators there is no affect when selecting any generators? has this go to do with the plugin cracks?
THANKS FOR THE DOWNLOAD ITS TIME TO MAKE SOME MUSIC :)))"
,JuggaloLash,2011-06-14T18:11Z,go into the folder where you installed the program. inside the program folder is either a folder with the .DLL inside or they will be there as soon as you open the program folder
,adrianlives,2011-06-15T16:31Z,"Thanks, yes I have found the plugin cracks, I was just wondering where I should copy them to? should I paste them in the main directory or in one of the plugin folders?"
,JuggaloLash,2011-06-15T20:43Z,what ever the name of the crack is just copy and paste it into the folder of the original file and replace it. make sure that fl studio is not open while doing this
,adrianlives,2011-06-20T17:13Z,"thanks all done! Do you know anything about using Waves plugins with FL?

,Kushala,2011-07-09T05:38Z,Just need to know if this program has any problems with 64bit OS. Opening up the exe folders not doing me any good. Pops up in my processes but not the actual setup window. Then when I open it more than once Its speaking of Adware Open Candy. I'll take your word for it not being bugged but you got any ideas on what needs to happen here?

,boltwolf,2011-08-27T18:18Z,"Hello all.

So i've downloaded this torrent and i'm clueless on what to do next. I just want to make some music already.
After opening flstudio9 folder, there are 3 things; cracks, flstudio_9, info.

I've located the program crack, but I have no idea where to copy and paste it like you guys say... 
Can I get some help? My email is: boltbachman@live.com"
,akshay101,2011-09-03T16:07Z,"What is OpenCandy? 

OpenCandy is a platform and network which enables software publishers 
to recommend other products, during installation of their software, they 
believe you will find valuable. 

Soâ€¦ What is this folder, its contents, and why is it here? 

These files are only on your computer because you accepted a software 
recommendation. These files are TEMPORARILY copied to a folder within 
the publisher's program files directory until the recommended software 
is downloaded and installation is performed. 

This folder contains: 

  * OpenCandy_Why_Is_This_Here.txt
    - This text file youâ€™re reading. :) 

  * OCSetupHlp.dll
    - This file is used to display a recommendation during the 
      publisherâ€™s software installation and to facilitate the download 
      and installation of the recommended software. This file also 
      allows us to provide software publishers with *non personally 
      identifiable* information such as statistics like install 
      initiated and completed, country, operating system and language, 
      and whether the software recommendation was accepted or not. 

Once the recommended softwareâ€™s installation is started (and regardless 
of whether it is successfully completed) these files and the 'OpenCandy' 
folder will be automatically deleted. 

The possible reasons this folder and its contents remain are: 

  A) You rebooted before installing the recommend software
  B) You lost power before the recommended software was installed
  C) Your computer exploded before the recommended software was 
  installed (Then how are you reading this?) 

Feel free to delete this OpenCandy folder (and its contents) at any 
time; there is no harm in doing so. If you believe this folder and its 
files should have been deleted and were not (and neither A, B, or C 
happened), we'd appreciate if you contacted us (see below) and told us 
what you think happened. If it happens to be a bug, we'll fix it so this 
doesn't happen to anyone else. Oh yeah, and we'll send you an awesome 
purple t-shirt for helping us out! 

If you have any questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us at 
www.opencandy.com/contact/. 

Thank you. 

- The OpenCandy team"

,nickbrx,2011-09-11T17:05Z,"Idiots. See the definition of ADWARE. I'll give you a hint. ADware. AD for advertising. It's not going to harm your computer, it's just advertisements."
,nickbrx,2011-09-11T17:07Z,"Oh, and this isn't working for me. I have Windows 7 32-bit and I get the same problem as the others. It pops up in the processes, and uses 50% of my cpu. I'm on an old laptop though.

Has anyone been able to workaround this?"

If you have problem with Open Candy, then temporarily deactivate your anti-virus.
