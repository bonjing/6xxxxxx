,bonnievilleangel,2011-07-21T12:52Z,"Hi...I'd like someone to give me a hand if possible please.  I'm still new to downloading movies, getting it right most times however when a movie such as this comes with a .srt file, I'm unable to open it.  What I mean is that the movie plays on my Windows Media Player but without subs.  I use WMP to burn all my movies, it works fine for me but I desperately want to watch this movie but can't get the subs to work.  They work fine if I watch it in VLC however I can't burn DVD's using VLC.  Any advice please would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you..."
,discolex,2012-02-17T16:19Z,just drag the srt file over vlc after starting the movie. hest.
,croakerbc,2012-03-01T02:20Z,"@bonnie: Use ConvertXtoDVD 4 to convert and burn your movies to dvd-r. Easy to use and a hell of a lot better than WMP. 
For displaying subtitles, remember to: 1) Always make sure the srt files are the same names as the movie files. 2) Make sure you have the subtitles codecs installed (if you're not sure, google VobSub).

Well, I watched all of Tony Jaa movies and Chocolate and Raging Phoenix but those don't count as good movies. I only skip to the fight scenes anyway."
