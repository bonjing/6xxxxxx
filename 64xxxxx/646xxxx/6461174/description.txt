Set approximately 20 years in the future, we follow a group of survivors in the mountains of Northern California after an apocalypse wipes out nearly 75% of the worldâ€™s population.

There was no natural disaster. There was no war. Abandoned buildings and homes are peacefully still standing. In fact, there were no real signs of immediate danger.

How did the world fall to shambles, leaving nothing more than stories of what may have happened? The answers lie within a stranger that stumbles upon this small community of survivors with nothing more than an empty gun and a bloody wooden knife, fighting his way across the country looking for the answers. And the solution.

To find out what caused the world to end, and what anomalies now inhabit mother earth, our survivors along with this new stranger, must venture out into what may be the end of their livesâ€¦
