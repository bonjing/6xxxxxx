The record features 12 tracks including many brand new Ragbirds songs. We had the honor of working with producer, fiddler and multi-instrumentalist, Tim Carbone (of Railroad Earth) and Phil Nicolo at Studio 4 in Philly who mixed and mastered the songs. Phil is a Grammy-Award-winning producer and engineer who has worked with an impressively long list of top performers. 

Here's what Phil had to say about the album: "I was pleasantly surprised to discover The Ragbirds new album to be a wonderful combination of clever songwriting and heartfelt performances. This will live in my CD player for a long while!" 

Made from Eco-Friendly packaging, designed with a plastic tray made out of recycled plastic bottles, and printed with vegetable based inks. Each CD saves 6 plastic water bottles from being thrown in a landfill!
