,Quark1,2011-06-12T11:01Z,"Only 175mb...? Usually, an 720p episode is arround 556mb. So, i suppose this is NO Highdef?"
,slhavec,2011-06-12T11:49Z,"Sorry guys. no its not high def only high quality. 

I am trying to edit the torrent and change it but everytime i click on it i get a message saying edit currently inactive.

,mantikor777,2011-06-13T15:52Z,"Well then it shouldn't be loaded in the Highres-TV shows section then, should it?  I mean, really, how difficult of a concept is that to comprehend? Thanks for wasting my time."
,slhavec,2011-06-13T17:51Z,sorry man. i really didnt mean to waste your time. and no it should not have been loaded there then.
