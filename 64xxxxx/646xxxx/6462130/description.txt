This is a PAL converted movie from the German film release - It is entirely
in German with German subtitles on-screen for non German spoken parts too.

We found this movie anonymously posted elsewhere on the net and are bringing 
it to you as is in what is a 640 X 352 video 192k audio offering. The video
bitrate is really quite high (relatively speaking in any event) at 1500k plus
It isnt showing available at thepiratebay so we bring it to you as an important movie for all concerned.


There is an incredibly devastating effect of mixing the cultures shown
in this movie - that of the greatest German peoples of Austria versus
their counterparts from Turkey (timely for the EU debate at the present moment)


Thank you for helping seed this important movie to our family 
in greater Germany, Austria, Holland and elsewhere, it is intended to restore
sanity in what decisions are being made across the board - everywhere we look
it seems
