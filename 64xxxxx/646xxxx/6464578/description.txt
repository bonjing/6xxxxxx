A one-stop resource for understanding and applying polymerization catalystsAn edited volume featuring contributions from leading researchers, the Handbook of Transition Metal Polymerization Catalysts covers the design and synthesis of catalysts, and their applications in synthesis of polymers. Dealing with those polymerization catalysts that afford commercially acceptable yields of polymer with respect to catalyst mass and promising newer catalysts, this practical reference provides polymer and organic chemists with a comprehensive overview of the known methods for developing and applying these important catalysts.With both recent advances and historically important catalysts, the subjects covered in this text include:Metal alkyls and other compounds that function as co-catalysts with a large number of catalystsThe varieties of porous silica either necessary or valuable in certain catalyst formulationsCatalyst scale-up and commercializationCopper catalysts for olefin polymerizationMorphology controlAlong with the above topics, the Handbook of Transition Metal Polymerization Catalysts provides tables of valuable data to assist in reproducing a synthesis or applying the knowledge to a new problem. Polymerization reactivities, polymer properties, monomer and solvent purity requirements, molecular weights, distribution, and reactivity ratios are also covered. The Handbook of Transition Metal Polymerization Catalysts offers an excellent one-stop resource for understanding and applying polymerization catalysts.
