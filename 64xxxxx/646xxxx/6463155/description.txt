Product Description: In the vein of the bestselling Salt and Cod, a gripping chronicle of the myth, mystery, and uncertain fate of the worldâ€™s most popular fruit

In this fascinating and surprising exploration of the bananaâ€™s history, cultural significance, and endangered future, award-winning journalist Dan Koeppel gives readers plenty of food for thought. Fast-paced and highly entertaining, Banana takes us from jungle to supermarket, from corporate boardrooms to kitchen tables around the world. We begin in the Garden of Edenâ€”examining scholarsâ€™ belief that Eveâ€™s â€œappleâ€ was actually a bananaâ€” and travel to early-twentieth-century Central America, where aptly named â€œbanana republicsâ€ rose and fell over the crop, while the companies now known as Chiquita and Dole conquered the marketplace. Koeppel then chronicles the bananaâ€™s path to the present, ultimatelyâ€”and most alarminglyâ€”taking us to banana plantations across the globe that are being destroyed by a fast-moving blight, with no cure in sightâ€”and to the high-tech labs where new bananas are literally being built in test tubes, in a race to save the worldâ€™s most beloved fruit.
