                           The Complete Season 1



Camelot is a historical-fantasy-drama television series.

When King Uther is murdered, Merlin brings Arthur, Uther's son, from the commoner family who raised him from birth, to install him as the new king. Morgan, Arthur's half-sister, wants the throne for herself -- and when she learns that she has a half-brother (one for whom Merlin claims proof that he is the legitimate heir to the throne)-- she becomes his rival for the throne, in a story that will unfold as an "epic battle for control."

According to Eva Green, the character of Morgan is not so much evil as she is "damaged": "She believes herself to be the rightful heir to the throne, but because she's a woman, she's denied the throne and she will do absolutely anything to get it back."

Whatever the background motivation, Morgan will stop at nothing--including the use of magical forces--to win the throne from Arthur. Arthur must defeat his enemies and unite the kingdom.

In addition to Arthur's love, Guinevere, the magician Merlin stands by Arthur, but his support for the new king is complicated, because "his premonitions of Arthur's sudden rise to royalty also include dark visions of the young heir's future." A complicated figure himself, Merlin is described by Chibnall as a kind of "warrior monk," who has a "duality within him of both a soldier and a spiritual being."
