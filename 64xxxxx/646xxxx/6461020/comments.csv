,nzwolftoo,2011-06-11T17:16Z,"as far as I can see, but I am not the specialist, this is where you find your information:

Hope this helps?"
,oldlen70,2011-06-11T18:47Z,Probably means they repeated the telecast of episode 10..They often do that..
[V],manOtor,2011-06-11T23:02Z,"The Starz schedule shows for Friday June 10, 2011, Camelot E110 at 10pm with a direct repeat at 11pm.

The Rip is from the first airing. That's why the season finale is announced again during the credits.
No worries, this is the complete season 1, if you follow the link to Wikipedia you can see that there are indeed only 10 episodes ;)."

much better "
[V],manOtor,2011-08-05T04:09Z,"@hakuna_matata:
I don't mind people spamming my torrents with links to allegedly better versions, because my torrents speak for themselves, but I'd appreciate if you could state why the linked version is supposed to be better!?
Because the version you are linking to is a NapisyPL release - I admire their work, but they achieve the smaller file size by shrinking the files to a much lower resolution.
So it is hardly better, if you want to watch on a bigger screen.

As I said, I don't mind you linking to other torrents, but your spam comment should have looked like this:

If you are looking for a smaller file size and lower resolution look here:
