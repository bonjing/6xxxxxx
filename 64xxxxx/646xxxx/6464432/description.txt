The Second Edition of Lippincott's Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook is a practical, yet comprehensive, reference guide that provides alphabetical access to cancer drugs and to drug administration guidelines. Written by two high level nurses at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, this book is a valuable resource for practicing nurses, physicians, IV therapists, and other oncology health care providers. The main section includes chemotherapeutic drug monographs, drug regimens, and information on drugs needed to control side effects. New to this edition are brief sections that detail the guidelines on safe handling and administration, management of side effects, and home care guidelines.
