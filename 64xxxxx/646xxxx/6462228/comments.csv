,deltafun,2011-06-12T19:17Z,"This torrent works 100%.

There is a bug right now that causes infrequent game freezing, but it is confirmed not the fault of KaOs but a defect in the game."
,gteweq,2011-06-12T23:27Z,The game works great but on the very first level it won't trigger a cutscene just before a broken bridge and I end up stuck. Is it a prob with me or?
