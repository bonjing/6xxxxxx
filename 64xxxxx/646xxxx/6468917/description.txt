Clay is a successful screenwriter, middle-aged and disaffected; he's in LA to cast his new movie. However, this trip is anything other than professional, and he's soon drifting through a louche and long-familiar circle a world largely populated by the band of infamous teenagers first introduced in Less Than Zero. But his debauched reverie is about to be interrupted by a violent plot for revenge and Clay's seemingly endless proclivity for betrayal and exploitation looks set to land him somewhere darker and more ominous than ever before. 'His tautest, most compulsively readable work since American Psycho. A sequel to Less Than Zero, it imagines what became of that book's group of over-privileged, dead-eyed kids as forty-year-olds' Hari Kunzru 'A murder mystery a woozy, paranoid, hallucinatory version of LA noir' Sunday Times 'Brilliantly written and coolly self-aware . . . Here, as in Less Than Zero, Ellis is plumbing the depths of human nature, exposing it at its worst.' Observer 'The novel is a kind of modern noir and, as in Chandler, the form's accepted master, atmosphere is king. Paranoia prevails'
