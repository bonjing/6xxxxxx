,emillo108,2011-06-14T16:25Z,there are only Two songs on the album?? One for each disk... strange
,edmursantos,2011-06-20T19:29Z,"This torrent has a cue file plus an only mp3 file. Which mean you have to:
A) Burn the CUE image to a disc, using IMGBURN.
B) Listen to the CUE file on FOOBAR2000, that automatically recognizes the tracks (IF OPENED BY THE CUE FILE)
C) Divide the MP3 file according to the CUE, with MEDIEVAL CUE SPLITTER (OPEN THE CUE FILE TO DIVIDE).
Thanks!!"
