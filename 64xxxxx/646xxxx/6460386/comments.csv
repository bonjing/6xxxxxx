@abciscrazy:Sorry, I cannot. As people heard, I had hard drive crash two days ago, as in March.

@puplone: Done, I can't remember when and in what format, if encode is Pack or not... Sorry.

@tintinintibet: Betty Blue was done, many times, as one of my favored. Malena while back, but I don't have BluRay anymore. The rest - I can promise nothing. Maybe, if sources can be found. Not before I fix my PC."
