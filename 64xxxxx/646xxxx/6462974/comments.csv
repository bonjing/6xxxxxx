Page buttons look way better, and scroll bar along with the windows just look much cleaner. Thanks."
,Bonerman5000,2011-06-17T21:18Z,"One question though, would there be a way to move the user picture on the taskbar? I have my taskbar hide on the left side of my screen and the user picture hides some of the notification icons. If this would be possible than I would have no complaints whatsoever. "
