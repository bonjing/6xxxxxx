                Fourth episode of the five-part drama. Travers and
                Natalie Chandra are shocked to discover that Lucy
                Wilson had a history for blackmail, strengthening the
                prosecution's case against Martin Newall. With
                Wenborn breathing down Travers's neck, the pressure
                really mounts. When Wenborn finds out that his wife
                Maggie has been caught shoplifting, causing him
                professional embarrassment, he lashes out at her.
                Later, he stumbles across a crucial coincidence which
                could provide the missing link between the Spaull
                killer and his prime suspect. Has he got his man at
                last?
