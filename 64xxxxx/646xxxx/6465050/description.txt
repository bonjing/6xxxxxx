A groundbreaking four-step program for breaking self-destructive habits, increasing productivity and creativity, and performing at your personal best.
We often make our worst decisions when we act from a weak sense of self, and our best decision when we are confident and self-assured. Using the latest research findings in neuropsychology, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and Peak Performance strategies, Awaken Your Strongest Self shows you how to live with greater joy, ease, and effectiveness. Author Neil Fiore, Ph.D., provides a four-step program that involves (1)stepping back from old, ineffective patterns, (2)waking up your "new brain"--what neuroscientists call the â€œExecutive Organizing Functionâ€ (3)awakening the five qualities of your strongest self, and (4)putting everything together to achieve your goals. 

Through innovative examples, case studies, and exercises, you will learn how to cope with stress, recognize early signs of inner conflict, perform at their personal best on everyday work projects, minimize feelings of being overwhelmed; and ultimately, choose healthy alternatives to replace former bad habits.
