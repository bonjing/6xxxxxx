- great video quality
- good audo quality. There is a soft buzz which is obvious at the start of the movie. When the sound of the movie is soft you still hear the buzz, but in louder scenes you don't notice it. I'm sure with original BD English audio it will be fine. The R5 audio isn't very bad thought, like I said good :)

Thanks!"

,flatusgass,2011-06-12T14:53Z,"There are subs for EVERY other release but this one. WTF????  

Dont bother trying to use one of the other subs, which often works. Not on this one.

SOMEONE POST SOME GODDAMN ENGLISH SUBS!

NOW, YOU PIGS!"
,flatusgass,2011-06-12T14:56Z,"And ya, whats with the damn humming on this copy? It's not nearly as mild as the previous comment made it out to be. It's damn annoying."

,mirkamp,2011-06-13T15:31Z,"@NADRO @ Froggie

I want to respond on the problem with the sound. If i play it on my surround system i hear a loud buzz. its quit annoying. The movie Alexander had it to and it often happends with the uploads from froggie. I dont want to say anything negative cause the uploads you do are great though KEEP UP the good work. But maybe you can fix the buzz? i only can fix it by turn de woofer off and only hear the sound, and thats a pitty cause i want to enjoy the 5.1 doulby sound! thnx anyway for the great uploads!  "

,arr1829,2011-06-15T07:58Z,the audio hummm seems to stem from a fault in the dubbing chain ?
,dunCN,2011-06-15T19:56Z,Same issue with the buzz playing the movie on my home theater system. Have to redownload this movie and watch it  again with subs.
