,ZQ2,2011-06-19T13:09Z,"I'm having multiple problems with all this. The download worked fine, but your instructions really suck, I don't get them at all. First of all, there's no file/directory called ""Razor"", so I don't know at all if I've copied and pasted the right files from one place to an other for this to work.
Secondly, your instructions for how to register an account on Rockstar Social Club are wrong, there's no option that says ""Create Local Account"", all you can do is to create an account (which I've done multiple times) and then try to log in with it (which hasn't worked at all).
Thridly, there's no serial key that follows with any of the download files that I got from here, so I can't register or anything. Maybe I shouldn't register at all, and then somehow work around this quite bulletproof system that Windows Live and Rockstar Games have created, but I don't know what to do then. Since I can't follow any of the steps and instructions that are given, I have no fucking idea how to make this work, since you give instructions that are completely irrelevant, since I can't understand them. 
Now, I request a full and detailed instruction and clearence on the points I've given you above. If you fail to meet my request, I'm afraid I have to report this file as corrupt and defaulted, since it's unavailable to use.
You can contact me either here the form of a comment or with a private message to my mail; zlash_qu@hotmail.com.
I will eagerly await your response.
Best regards"
,caloletti,2011-06-20T10:45Z,"ZQ you start the game,you press ""Home"" then you click ""Create new account"" there must be a button called ""Create local acount"""
,caloletti,2011-06-20T10:48Z,"@aliceblack there are no viruses,the CRACK is detected by your antivirus like a trojan but it isn't!"
,ZQ2,2011-06-21T21:57Z,"I still don't get it, but it's nice to have a dialogue. Here's what I see when I launch GTA IV from the Rockstar Games Social Club launcher. I see GTA IV with big black letters in front of a girl sucking a lollipop. In the bottom left corner I see a big ""PLAY""-button. If I click it I'm requested to activate the game, whcij I can't. In the upper right corner I see, written in gray letters ""visit Socialclub"" and next to it to the right I see ""You are not logged in"" and a big X in a box. Then there's ""Register/Login now"". If I click the ""Register/ Login now"" text I get to see this: Rockstar Games Social Club, and then they want my E-mail and password. I see two boxes in the bottom right corner. One that says ""Create New Account"" and one that says ""Retrieve a Lost Account"". I then click ""Create a New Account"" since it seems to be what you're telling me to do. I then get linked to the Rockstar Games Social Club website, to the register of an account section. I now see, written in big white letters ""Sign Up"" and below ""Enter your information below to sign up for Rockstar Games Social Club!"". Below there're multiple boxes to fill in, and I do that to create an account. But there's absolutley no box that says ""Create local account"", which makes me think I'm doing something wrong. Anyway, after I've filled in all the boxes and given them my E-mail and so on and click ""Sign Up"". I'm informed that I'm now registered if my E-mail is valid blah blah blah and I go to the sign in section, hoping that it'll work. I type in E-mail and password but then a red box appears that says ""The username/password combination you entered is incorrect"" and no matter how many times I try I won't work. I've tried all the possible ways over and over again with what's clickable on the site and in the launchbox, but I won't reach any results. Now PLEASE tell me, what am I doing wrong?"
,caloletti,2011-06-22T08:34Z,"Youtube it :P

You click PLAY that big PLAY BUTTON or you go where u installed the game and u launch the game from there..."
,ZQ2,2011-06-22T18:06Z,"When I click the PLAY button the game want me to register ""my authentical game"" and I don't have a code. Didn't find anything useful on Youtube. How do I avoid the registration, that is, how do I avoid having to register that my downloaded copy is an original?"
,caloletti,2011-06-22T19:08Z,you go where u installed the game and u launch the crack that you installed LaunchGTAIV.exe
,ZQ2,2011-06-22T23:57Z,"""Error

Seculauncher: failed to start application. [2000]""
(The menu doesn't even appear)

This happens when I launch that exact file you told me to launch, when it's still in the crack folder OR in the Rockstar Games Social Club folder (together with every file that also were in the crack folder). When I copied every file in the crack folder into the Program files folder with Rockstar Games; GTA IV, the same problem occured which I've described earlier: the menu appears as it should, but I'm demanded to register, add a serial key and so on. I think we're getting closer to a solution here, thanks for helping me :D"
