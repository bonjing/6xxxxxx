,BruceLucio,2011-06-11T07:01Z,This repack contain trailers and credits?
,illiria,2011-06-11T07:23Z,"@ BruceLucio

Yes, it contains everything. It is a complete full version. Nothing at all was cut."
,elturbo9077,2011-06-11T07:23Z,can u read its says full and best  which means that this uploader rocks 
,BruceLucio,2011-06-11T08:00Z,"@illiria
Thank's for full repack's,thank you!"
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-06-11T08:51Z,"U r a good uploader , but if u wanna be the best u have to include more info , one or two screen caps and a picture in the title .. If you do all that surely u will earn ur trusted skull.."
,illiria,2011-06-11T12:19Z,"@ G.i.a.n.t

Oh, I don't claim im the best uploader at all, far from it. I just make pretty and functional repacks where nothing is cut.

Which file hosts will be showed correctly on PirateBay? I've tried making screenshots before, but the links didn't show up in the description, thats the reason why I don't do that anymore.

Again, thank you all. Sorry for bragging about ""full"" and ""best"", just for now - thats the best compression and looks you're gonna get for a full version, yeah. :P"
,tredrzxcvt,2011-06-11T12:39Z,"""a custom autorun along with custom setup""
so it doesnt use razor installer? because razor installer doesnt work on my pc :/"
,tredrzxcvt,2011-06-11T16:39Z,"thanks, it works, unlike razer installer"
,illiria,2011-06-11T16:41Z,"@ tredrzxcvt

It's a custom installer created by me. It doesn't use nor Razor1911's, nor SKIDROW's, nor official installer."

thank you for a repack. But as a small complain its damn annoying that every ""repacker"" writes own installer, sometimes providing stupid features like disturbing music that can't be turned off. As a programmer I know that it doesn't take much effort to write own installer (like a shitty form on Visual Basic). So please, use something more standart, just a simple InstallShield installer would be ok for most people. No one will blame you like ""YOU DUMB ASS, I NEED CUSTOM AUTORUN WITH POKEYMONS AND RADIOHEAD AT BACKGROUND MUSIC!"" "

,Cerebral222,2011-06-12T10:48Z,"Thanks illiria, this is a flawles upload works perfectly with no bugs, just the way we like it. Cheers."
,Darckness,2011-06-16T17:51Z,i can't resume my playing after having the game shut down! i have to start all the way from the beginning of the game every single time i start the game. Why won't this game save and memorize my progress??
,illiria,2011-06-17T11:46Z,"@ Darckness

Saves work fine here. It probably doesn't save your progress because game path or path to your Documents is in any other language than english? It is the most common issue with modern games: if your Windows uses a non-english language, you may have troubles saving.

If that's not your case, then I don't know."
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-06-18T16:54Z,"@illiria 

To include a title picture u need to post from the bayimg with the tag .. You should read this to know more about that 
http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=60770

For screenshots imgshack will do f9 ..

Also i had recommended you for trusted user , but since you don't have enough uploads , screens etc they have denied it .. Upload more and u will surely earn it .. Also try replying to the comments .. It helps a lot .. ( I can see you are doing that no ..)"
,Darckness,2011-06-19T21:51Z,"@ illiria

Yeah, i'm norwegian, so that could be the problem. should i rename the whole path in english, or just the saves folder? if i have to change the whole path, i would love it if you could type the path (what i should name every folder) so that i don't get anything wrong :))"
,Viggen66,2011-06-24T17:51Z,"Just play the game on Administrator rights, and you can save, the best release, with no noticeable bugs, excellent work illiria"

,Insomneac,2011-10-05T08:09Z,Does anyone know if this includes Update 1?
,fantmclwd,2011-11-16T14:49Z,I played this up to the point where you get into the duke cave for the very first time then i exited out of the game and it did not save when i started it back up again. I havent bothered to get further in the game yet so maybe i never hit another checkpoint or whatever. Basically it did not save for me as far as i know.
