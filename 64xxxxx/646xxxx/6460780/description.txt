Now I've made something I bet most of you would want. Scene release of DNF didn't have any installer at all, let alone a normal, comprehendable one. My repack is, as usual, very good looking, very functional, very easy.
Nothing was cut at all â€“ not even the trailers, just plain good compression (even I was surprised how good it turned out to be).

Well, those of you that already know my repacks, know the quality. Nothing else to say. It's an ISO because I've made a custom autorun along with custom setup. Anyway, enjoy.

Tags? If you want a pretty, shiny, good looking release with an easy and comprehendable  nice install, grab it. Coz umâ€¦ As much as I am VERY grateful for cracking it, the original release is not something I'd like to keep in my collection.

Even with such a high compression, installation completes quickly, btw.

----------------

This release contains a FIXED crack (second release).

Just in case, report any problem you may run into, although that is very unlikely.

***********

As far as I know, second crack works fine. However, I can't guarantee that it works perfect. I've heard certain rumors (about the first one), so if anything occurs, you can just download a different crack (if there will be one), and copy it over.

*Please, keep in mind that any stuff like "game doesn't save at key points", "graphical settings are not memorized by the game" and so on are crack, not repack related.* - and don;t get freaked out, I'm saying this just in case.

If there will be new patches or cracks for the game, you should be able to use them with this release.


SEED AND SHARE EVERYWHERE! Other trackers too! Thank you.
