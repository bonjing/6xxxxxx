[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-15T15:30Z,"Make sure that the Frontier Hi Rez shortcut points to the right folder, just right-click the shortcut, select properties  and in the Shortcuts tab enter the correct values for target: ""C:\Elite 2 Frontier-Hyperdrive25\Frontier.exe"" --size 960, and Start in: ""C:\Elite 2 Frontier-Hyperdrive25""  If your default drive is C:\ it should work fine. If you have installed to another drive just change C:\ to what your drive letter is.

Alternatively right-click anywhere in the folder and create a shortcut and edit its properties to the above, making sure you define your drive letter."
