,marthafar,2011-06-14T13:41Z,"@Vector1818: ""Subs"" is an abbreviation for ""subtitles"" (those little words at the bottom of the screen that more or less match what the people on screen are saying). ""NL"" is an abbreviation for the Netherlands, where they speak Dutch. ""Custom"" means ""home-made"". Put them all together and you'll get an idea of what ""custom NL subs"" means.  "
