are they inside the ISOs? "
,gr8franks,2011-06-13T03:03Z,"you will have to first mount the CD, the use a different program to rip them to a FLAC file.  Think of this as a the raw material, like a physical CD before you rip it to a hard drive."
,kryptosdaddy,2011-07-10T18:59Z,"I just downloaded these a couple of hours ago- 7Zip, Nero, Roxio and the posters own vaunted free ware Daemon Tools lite  WILL NOT DO A THING WITH THESE FILES! - Maybe its me but I have not been able to get these on my harddrive or either of my disk drives- though i don't have any cds. I bought  50 Sony  dvdr's yesterday and yes they work- I have already backed up 80 gig of data and burned some other items.
We appreciate the effort of the posters here, but some don't have the experience or the time to buy new cds. rip the image there and then rip it back to the HD (where i can make a true back up anyway).
Thanks to you folks seeding for allowing me to get this in less than a day- maybe after awhile I'll find something to actually work on them?"
,kryptosdaddy,2011-07-10T21:08Z,"Ok here is the scoop on this NRG format these disks are cloned under. This is something new to me, but apparently this is not a new file format.

NRG is proprietary to Nero- so if you are not familiar with the way Nero works your at a loss immediatly. Nero 9 does not have a convertor for this- it will 'burn' the disk in its disk image- so now you will have two copies of this locked up  BS.

Sorry to be so negative, but the time i have spent trying to open these files with nothing to show but downloading that garbage Quick Time player is just not worth the trouble.

Nero 9 will not convert this onto a cd and let you just open it- it prompts for you to install Quick Time and if you have Quick Time its already opening as soon as the disk is recognised and then there is NOTHING you can do.

Other than that the video is fine- if you like QuickTime .

But alas, I thinkn this is a waste of time .


Do not download this unless you want to spend hours trying to convert while adding to your 3.5 inch coaster collection. "
,rich121,2011-07-29T18:01Z,Anyone get figure out how to get these to work?
,OscarTheSlouch,2012-01-07T04:26Z,"NRG is neither mysterious nor new. As stated above, it is proprietary to Nero software (why the hell they pull this shit is beyond me) but a quick Google search for ""convert nrg to iso"" returns at least ten different programs (some open-source) that will do the job. 

They convert fine. They mount fine. The data is intact. Sure, NRG is not the optimum choice for an upload format but, bloody hell, fixing it isn't rocket science!
