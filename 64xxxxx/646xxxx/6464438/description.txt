I downloaded these when they first came out in 2009. The gentleman that uploaded these made image files out of the brand new discs. Use a program like Daemon Tools Lite to mount the images onto a virtual drive. You can than use a different program (like Nero) to burn the image files as an exact CD that will play in any CD player.

FLAC is of course gaining popularity and I have a copy of them stored on my PC. You can mount the images and make your own flac version of the individual songs or album, complete with .CUE files

As pointed out by a poster in the Mono Box Set download, these are the only ones that have the embedded video clips. The clips will play as quicktime files in Itunes, or any other quicktime video player.

If you have any questions, please send me a PM or post a comment, and I will do my best to answer it.
Enjoy!!
