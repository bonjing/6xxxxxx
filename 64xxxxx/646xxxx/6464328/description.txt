"Remote Control"

When the CIA learns that a terrorist 
is hiding in Paris, the CHAOS spies 
are sent in to capture him. But when 
French intelligence agents shut their 
operation down, they must continue 
the mission while avoiding an 
international incident.

If the CRF so-called 'rules' are 
about quality, then why is the 
ratefacor 20? With 18 being pretty 
much transparent to source, would it 
not be the logical solution to use 
18? And medium preset? Seriously? 
So the settings stay more or less
the same and still ignore half of 
the detail and quality of the source 
even though we all got now fancy 
shmancy cpus that can handle real 
settings and raise the bar on quality 
that the previous section rules 
already sat so low? O wait, I forgot, 
the posers at IMMERSE just wanted crf 
so that they could finally use their 
'live-encoding' tool, and pre even 
worse quality trash 15 seconds after 
a show ends on their poor quality 
Half-HD bitrate sources.

knows the origin of the Jackalope]

If anyone can explain why douches 
are so determined to pre subpar 
shit, please let us know.

Enjoy ;)
