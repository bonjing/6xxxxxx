,H0llyw00d7,2011-08-10T12:07Z,"Hi. New to the whole download scene. 
YIFY or perhaps someone else out there can help. Really love the work as the quality is absolutely amazing especially for the file size but would like the same choice of downloads but without subs.
Please help someone. "
,MasutinA,2011-10-18T11:06Z,"H0llyw00d7, MP4 and MKV files have embedded (or muxed) subtitles that you can disable. E.g. Media Player Classic runs an external program, DirectVobSub, which, among other things, lets you do this. In Windows it appears as a green arrow in the notification area."
,xevar,2012-03-16T06:11Z,I'm following you. lol. Great ups. Thanx and keep em coming. Low Size High Res is what we should all aspire to.
