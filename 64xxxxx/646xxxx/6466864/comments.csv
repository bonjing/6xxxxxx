,motley666,2011-06-14T02:36Z,"It's not all about graphics little kid, what do you know about gaming? Nothing, stick to your modern warfare arcade noob."

,edge15,2011-06-14T18:59Z,why is that my comment is removed? is the multiplayer here working?
,pether,2011-06-14T23:12Z,"The game has nothing in common with the first and second Dungeon siege. And the game itself is rather crap. It will give you half a day worth of gaming.

I completed both this and red faction armageddon in the same game day.

Games today are not what they used to be..."
,zaamatu81,2011-06-15T18:16Z,this game no work. dont waste your time
,blood_dealer,2011-06-15T18:28Z,"Thnx for upload, can't expect better. The game is nothing like DS1 and 2, graphics was not a problem in fact I would have preferred the graphics of DS1 or 2 has as long as they brought the game play of the classics back. "
,HTC_guy,2011-06-16T10:56Z,"can someone confirm if they got their co-op working?? I downloaded this version coz the Reloaded release crashes when you click ""Multiplayer"".

This release goes to the Multiplayer screen, but once you click on Private/Public game it gives an app crash.

any ideas??"

,Spiderwhisperer,2011-06-21T23:03Z,"I would still like to try it out,is there a better one,plz let me know,thankyou."

,daggerhpbrs,2011-07-09T13:30Z,hey i was wondering if there was a problem with the d3drm.dll file on this game and Hunted. my antivirus keeps trying to say it has a virus in it..maybe why cant use extreme graphics settings...other than that game is great...still sound stuttering ocasionally but fixes itself.
,Gorgamin,2011-07-12T18:04Z,"FIX HERE: 

If you get missing textures in the game...
Set your Graphics card driver control panel
(Catalyst on ATI, Forceware on Nvidia) Anti Aliasing option to ""Application Controlled""... :)"
,mushi123,2011-07-13T12:45Z,"works great and thanks gansuk for all the work you put into all your games.

ds 1 and 2 i didn't finish cos its long and some what boring but this! i onlny finish with 1 character and never look back again (pyro type one)
"
,Epizen,2011-10-12T17:29Z,"This torrent doesn't work, there's an issue with the .bat file. I'm going to open it in notepad and trycatch it to try and manually fix the repak.

If you don't have basic coding understanding, you probably won't be able to get this to work - for me it extracts to the file, runs the .bat and then the file has nothing except unpak.dll in the install folder."
