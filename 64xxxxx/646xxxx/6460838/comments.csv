,pooponme,2011-08-30T09:57Z,I am only getting audio while trying to watch the episodes. The divx+ player has audio while other mkv file players I downloaded crash when I try to even open the file. I am wondering if I am missing a codec or something?
,LazerWulf,2011-09-05T22:52Z,"Try downloading CCCP (http://www.cccp-project.net/) for a Windows machine, or VLC (http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for Mac or Linux. (I do not recommend VLC for Windows, but that is more of a personal preference.)"

Just some video and audio errors after the credits on some episodes."
,Loveography,2011-10-15T17:12Z,"Finally, the RK series included with the English actors. This is one anime where I prefer the English. :) Good quality. The credits just mess up a little, but for me it's negligible. Thanks for sharing. "
,Battosai28,2011-10-21T07:45Z,Any screencap sample?
,kalish87,2011-11-24T08:46Z,please seed i love this show
,Teck1,2011-12-03T20:51Z,"This is the 1st anime I ever watched & I loved it, as long as the seeders are constant, I'll download & continue seeding this. Thanks a lot."
,vanics,2012-01-21T23:11Z,Does it really have english subtitles????
,Tsu-na-mi,2012-03-04T01:34Z,"When I saw someone rate this a 10/10/10 I thought ""pfft, pandering idiot"".  Considering the age of the show (shot on film, early DVD release) the quality is not reflected by the small file size at all.  It actually is very good, and the subs are gorgeous.  I own the US Release DVDs, and only got this because the damn things won't play on my comp. >_<  FU Media Blasters.  Great show and a very nice torrent."
,ninjalord,2012-04-03T07:10Z,hey ass hole how come its in Japanese and not English like it says in your description !!!!!! u ass hole  i spent 4 motherf@%$ering hours to find out its in japanese wtf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,Gorav24,2012-05-22T12:22Z,"Hey TheManuel08,

the quality and size of the torrent is really comendable & impressive .Not just this torrent most of the other torrent too which you have uploaded. Most of us try but didn't able to reach this mark.

themanuel08, is there a way i can make a request of torrent or atleast get in touch with you to know the method ?

Do reply."
,Alexdeite,2012-05-23T08:36Z,"Since I'm going to format my hard drive and all I'll only seed at least 50gb(enough for 5 people)Then move the file to another hard drive.

However, if someone tells me how I can continue seeding when I restore Windows 7 and install utorret and tells me how I can add the files I already have to seed again I'll be glad to keep seeding.

so far seeded 1.27gb"

@ninjalord
Please, if you don't know how to switch audio do not post newbie questions because the audio can be changed to English.

@nickharh
Most subtitles of anime I've seen aren't an exact replica of what they say in the english version so always assume its for those preffering the Japanese audio."
