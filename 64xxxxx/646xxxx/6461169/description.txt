::Plot::
 The Bride, along with her groom (Chris Nelson), rehearse their wedding. Bill arrives, and it transpires that The Bride has retired from assassination and left her former lover Bill, in order to settle down with her unborn daughter. Moments later the Deadly Vipers attack on Bill's orders. In the present, Bill warns his brother Budd (Michael Madsen), a bouncer and former Deadly Viper, that he will be targeted next. The Bride arrives at his trailer, but Budd shoots her with a rock salt shotgun and then sedates her. Budd calls Elle to sell her the HanzÅ sword, before sealing The Bride inside a coffin and burying her alive. In a flashback Bill takes The Bride to the temple of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu), a legendary martial arts master. Pai Mei has mastered a technique wherein pressure points on the victim's chest are struck leaving them with a few footsteps before their death. Bill informs The Bride that Pai Mei teaches no one the technique. After she trains under Pai Mei, who initially dislikes her, she eventually wins his respect.
