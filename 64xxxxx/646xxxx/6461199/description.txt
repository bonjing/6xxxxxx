"How to..."

When Annie's (Becki Newton) friend Jodie 
(Michelle Trachtenberg, "Buffy The Vampire 
Slayer") bakes a banana bread for her new 
flame Charlie (Bret Harrison, "Reaper"), 
he feels threatened and tells her they 
should just be "friends." Suspecting it 
was the banana bread that scared him off, 
Jodie is livid and decides to be the best 
"friend" he ever had. Meanwhile, Ed 
(Kurtwood Smith, "That 70s Show") and Faye 
Strathmore (Frances Conroy, "Six Feet 
Under") visit their son Kyle (Stephen 
Rannazzisi, "Paul Blart: Mall Cop") and 
his boyfriend in Venice, California and 
Faye is on a mission to make sure that Ed 
keeps an open mind and is on his best 
behavior. Also, when Judd (Greg Grunberg) 
and Colleen (Constance Zimmer) meet over-
the-top television sex therapist Dr. O 
(Jeffrey Tambor, "Arrested Development") 
at a party, he offers some suggestions 
about their love life that have 
disastrous results for the couple.

Enjoy :)
