On 6 June 2011, Depeche Mode will release Remixes 2: 81-11 on Mute. An inspiring
collection of new and classic mixes of material covering their entire career, the album
includes remixes of tracks from their 1981 debut Speak And Spell, through to 2009's Sounds
Of The Universe, and is the follow-up to 2004's million-plus selling Remixes 81-04. These
remixes reinforce Depeche Mode's standing as one of the world's most influential and
innovative acts.

Depeche Mode have been at the forefront of remix culture for the best part of three decades
and this new compilation includes classic mixes from M83, UNKLE, TrentemÃ¸ller, FranÃ§ois
Kervorkian and Dan The Automator, alongside all-new mixes from Stargate, Eric Prydz,
Karlsson & Winnberg (from Miike Snow) and RÃ¶yksopp. In addition to this, the expanded
editions include exclusive remixes by former band members Vince Clarke and Alan Wilder -
the first time either artist has remixed tracks for their former colleagues.

Highlights from the selection of classic mixes include reworkings of "Dream On" from 2001's
Exciter, "Suffer Well," "John the Revelator" and "A Pain That I'm Used To" from 2005's
Playing The Angel and "In Chains," "Peace" and "Wrong" from 2009's Sounds Of The
Universe, while the new mixes include "Tora! Tora! Tora!" and "Puppets" from 1981's Speak
And Spell, "Never Let Me Down Again" and "Behind The Wheel" from Music For The Masses
as well as "A Question Of Time" from 1986's Black Celebration. Lead single "Personal
Jesus", from 1990's Violator, also features several strong remixes as part of the package.
