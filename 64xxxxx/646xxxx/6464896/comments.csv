,hmonteiro,2011-12-03T20:17Z,"@yymmrr you have to unzip normally the files, and then will appear the files, .r00, .r01..."
,Stan_Kee,2012-01-12T17:12Z,"Thanks MAFIAA for the torrent - I'm getting an error on installation 'NSIS Error' - I unzipped all the files and have them all ks232x64.r00 to ks232x64.r37. Now what? Should it just install from keyshot_w64_2.3.2.exe? Or do I have to combine the small files?? HELP!! I'm a bit lost, and new to this - thanks for any extra directions :)"
