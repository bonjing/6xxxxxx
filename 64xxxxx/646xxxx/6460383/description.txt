Inno Setup Unpacker v0.36
Including: Inno Setup Unpacker + 2 GUI's - ISUnpacker v1.6.9 (Inno Setup Unpacker Explorer) - InnounpW Rebirth

innounp, the Inno Setup Unpacker Version 0.36
Supports Inno Setup versions 2.0.8 through 5.4.2

Inno Setup is a popular program for making software installations. Unfortunately,
there is no official unpacker - the only method of getting the files out of the self-extracting executable is to run it.
One piece of software that addresses this issue is Sergei Wanin's InstallExplorer,
a plug-in for the FAR Manager that unpacks several types of installations, including Inno Setup (IS).
But since it is not updated in a timely fashion, and so does not support the latest IS most of the time,
this program was born.

The advantages over InstallExplorer are:
Innounp is open source and based on IS source.
Therefore, it is more likely to support future IS versions.
It recovers portions of the installation script (.iss file), including the registry changes and the compiled Innerfuse/RemObjects Pascal Script, if available.
