ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and
blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and
upon all of his companions.


Dr. Saleh As-Saleh shows in his introduction to this book that Allah could not have created this universe without a purpose. He is All-Wise, All- Knowledgeable, All-Merciful and All-Just. All of these attributes entail providing ways of guidance that would lead to the proper knowledge of Him, and thus the right way to worship Him. Allah sent his messengers to direct man to relate to His Creator through complete submission and obedience (this is the meaning of Islam). He needs to know what benefits him and what harms him. The Message from Allah comprehends everything. It brings man to live for a noble purpose. All forms of worship are explained in the Qur\'an and by the Prophet. Worship is not left for our limited minds to decide upon their ways.
