  Arm yourself for the greatest conflict of modern times!

  STORM: Frontline Nation revolutionizes the turn-based strategy genre with
  unbelievable strategic depth and a cinematic scenario. Scarce resources and
  a prolonged economic crisis plunges half the world into strife, which can
  only be resolved by a force of arms. The tension laden mood has a host of
  nations mobilizing troops and researching advanced warfare technologies.
  New groups are created, accords are signed and alliances turn to face war.
  The player has myriad of possibilities available to them in terms of
  resource and troop management. Enormous freedom of action in the areas of
  combat, research and diplomacy allows the player to secure world domination
  for one of the nations. The perfect mix of strategy and turn-based combat
  makes STORM: Frontline Nation unique in its genre.
