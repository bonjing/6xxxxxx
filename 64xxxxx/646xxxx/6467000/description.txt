In no time, Basya becomes the most sought after person and he is liked by all in the surroundings. The story takes a turn when Bhageerathi (shubha) gets attracted to the goodness in Basya and falls in love with him. However, Basya keeps her at a distance but then she challenges him and in no time, Basya falls in love. However, Bhageerathiâ€™s father Singarappa and his brother Veerabhadra get a whiff of the relationship and they are enraged. Veerabhadra goes to the extent of bashing Basya up and looking at all this, Basya also revolts. He challenges Singarappa that he will marry Bhageerathi and what happens from there forms the rest of the story
