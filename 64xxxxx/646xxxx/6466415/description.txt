 Moray handles drums, bass, guitar and keyboards (piano, synths, mellotron and organ) duties himself, plus occasional dabbling with mandolin, banjo, bouzouki, hurdy gurdy and cittern, and selectively enlists guests to add those layers of paint he feels not qualified to or are simply physically impossible for one man to deal with, such as occasional Female voices or orchestral arrangements; although I have to admire Moray multi-instrumentalist skills, the quality of the playing and even his fair dose of good taste, this approach necessarily harms the interpretationsâ€™ spontaneity. 

 The material apparently mostly consists of either traditional songs (and stories) or songs penned by Moran atop traditional structures; there are no obvious weak tracks and youâ€™d be instantly transported by the step-by-step built up rhythmic and aural tapestry of the opening â€œBristol Harbourâ€, the muted guitar, the strummed pattern, the marimbas, the bass and the drums that successively enter and the ethereal melodeon lines that on and off float above it; but then itâ€™s also impossible to ignore a certain Dave Mathews vibe which transmutes into a grunge or Foo-Fighters like one on the heavy Rocking refrain; then on the beautiful melodies of â€œJenny of the Moorâ€, Moray and Hannah Peel alternatively sing the verses in a obvious attempt to evoke the Trees or Fairport, but the song drags on with too few diversions to genuinely be entitled to so high comparisons, and eventually feels more like some of those monotonous songs which Mostly Autumn occasionally deliver. 

 Things do much more authentically approach Fairport levels of intensity on â€œWilliam Taylorâ€, yet its orchestral arrangements do preferentially lead it into Led Zeppelin Kashmirâ€™s like territory; itâ€™s an epical grandeur which may also be found on â€œCold Stoneâ€ for which a viola and a couple of melodeons sufficed to reach the aural impact of the orchestra employed on previous piece. 

 With its wistful mood and restrained use of the drums and bass, â€œLong Lankinâ€ almost qualifies as a Folk-Rock classic, but â€œHardâ€ for instance is too Poppy (Coldplay?) for that, in spite of the banjo and mandolin and â€œThe Lowlands of Hollandâ€ with its trivial violin orchestration is a too mainstream ballad to even fall in the Folk category IMHO. 

 Itâ€™s an album which deserves to be listened but itâ€™s also the proof that it does not suffice to work on songs that have been covered by the likes of Steeleye Span, Sandy Denny, Dolly Parton or Joan Baez to instantly be rewarded with a place on the pantheon of the great ambassadors of the Folk tradition.
