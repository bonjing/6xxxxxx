    About ten years ago, Raymond Rajaonariveloâ€™s first feature film, Tabataba, and our first documentary film, Angano...angano...Tales from Madagascar, were concurrently screened at festivals. It was, and still is, rare to see African films at the cinema. How rare, then is a Malagasy film? As our films belonged to the same endangered species, this created a very strong bond between us, and today â€˜Mahaleoâ€™ by Raymond Rajaonarivelo and Cesar Paes is one such rare specimen of cinema from the South.
    The projectâ€™s strength and originality springs not only from the subject, but also from the unique filmmaking combination, which gives a dual insight into Madagascar through the Mahaleo group and their music. Raymond is a Malagasy filmmaker, screenwriter and director of feature films. He is of the same generation as the band and has the advantage of being close to them. Cesar, a Brazilian filmmaker also from the South, is a committed almost militant documentary filmmaker of the cinema du RÃ©el. His view of Madagascar and the groupâ€™s commitment is more distant, more strategic. Their approaches are thus very different, and the criss-crossing of this double vision is what carries the film and gives us food for thought.
    Mahaleo and their music is an entry point for depicting Madagascar today, at a critical time in its history, after a political crisis that brought the country to the brink of civil war. Beyond this, the group also provides an interesting insight into the status and commitment of the artist in a developing country.
