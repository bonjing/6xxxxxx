[V],joshua13,2011-06-12T18:58Z,"seeders are better than comments, though I like both on my torrents, if I have to choose seeders are a higher complete!"

,drumrobot,2011-06-16T01:34Z,"Thanks for fixing the torrent!

I bought the iOS version and while it is pretty good, I do think that a free copy of the OS X version should have been included (seeing as it was quite a bit more expensive than the other RSS readers).

Torrent rating: 10/10. No junk/ads/spamware, fast download, only one file.
Application rating: 9/10. Good user interface, easy to use, multitouch controls."
,pmdsp,2011-06-26T10:32Z,Works like a charm.. thanks for the upload..
