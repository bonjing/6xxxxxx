Okay, so what the hell is this??

Well, these days I'm getting about 400 tracks a month or more. And to be honest, there's only
room for just SO many tracks on the main playlist. And I've noticed that there's SO MUCH good
music left over every month, it just gets tossed into a folder and forgotten, for the most
part.

That's not fair if the whole point of this is to get new music HEARD. So I decided to put together
a second playlist now, every month (I presume), featuring these leftover tracks. 

These TASTY leftover tracks. So eat up!!

Yummy.

You may notice a lot more remixes, instrumentals and more obscure experimental or weird stuff
here on this playlist. So if that's your thing, you may like this one even more.

But that's not everything here... there's plenty of sweet pop goodness and rock
delectables and edibles to chew on.

Enough eating metaphors to fill you up yet??

groan.

Anyway. Enjoy. And remember, if you found YOUR music here, it doesn't mean I thought any less
of it.. quite the contrary. These are NOT REJECTED TRACKS!! Those go in the trash.

That comes to about half of what I get going into the recycle bin.

Hope you all like it. It was fun to put together. As much as the other playlist. I imagine
I will even do this one with quite a bit more care and attention from now on, even throwing
in some older stuff and personal favorites from time to time. A kind of playground for my
evil whims. Bwahahahaha!

See you in June, prune. ( I realized after I wrote this in the NFO that actually I'd be seeing you in July, Guy. Too late to edit... such is life)

P.S. - The consensus is in. The consensus being that I decided. I'll put these out when I
have enough tracks to justify it about halfway through the month.
