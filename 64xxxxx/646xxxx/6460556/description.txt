Well they finally put this abandoned movie onto DVD for us as we have been asking
them to do for a decade now! This DVD just arrived in todays mail - new!

Its an interesting thriller starring the likes of no less than Mr. Michael Caine
and Sir Laurence Olivier would you believe!


We have included English SRT captioned subtitles that can be used as a template
for other languages using google convert too perhaps - in any event this is the 
PAL version so there should be a nice selection for all as I hope to see - soon!

We will soon have a second supplementary ISP hooked up for our seeding maintenance
as our present ISP is three times the normal rate for the first 300GB of use 
and then fully one whole dollar for each gig beyond 300GB - with no cap limit
So I suppose we could just get into several hundreds of dollars a month if we arent
careful. They do provide up to 8 times the upload speed of the competition though
and fairly reliable service too - although we have seen an outage now and then
for brief periods only - thank goodness! Its still the best in town - all things considered and we have asked them to look into saner rate structure so no one goes bankrupt paying for excessive service fees on their accounts.

Thanks for helping us to seed

By the way, could someone fix it so we could edit our torrent postings for
spelling errors etc. thank you!
