BOOK INFO:

The definitive, up-to-date guide to planning, configuring, and administering Cisco call processing and voice messaging.
This book brings together all the hands-on knowledge you need to successfully configure and administer Ciscoâ€™s flagship IP voice systems, including Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), Unity, and Unity Connection. Fully updated for the new CUCM, Unity, and Unity Connection, version 8, it presents step-by-step procedures for every common and complex task that installers, integrators, and administrators will encounter.
 
Long-time Cisco voice implementer and instructor David Bateman begins with clear, well-organized explanations of Cisco Voice over IP technology, including its key functions and devices. Next, he guides you through preparation and deployment, including configuring CUCM for maximum performance, removing DNS dependencies, defining enterprise parameters, configuring regions, and enforcing security.
 
The author presents quick access, step-by-step solutions for dozens of post-deployment tasks, each with thorough instructions and cross-references to prerequisite tasks wherever needed. He demonstrates how to integrate features to create more powerful IP voice systems, thoroughly introduces Ciscoâ€™s new management interface, and provides extensive coverage of the latest feature enhancements.
