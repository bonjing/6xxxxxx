Posting this for any Julianna Margulies fans.															                                                             Canterbury\'s Law is an American legal drama, which ran from March 10, 2008 to April 18, 2008 as a mid-season replacement on Fox. The show was created by Dave Erickson and executive produced by Denis Leary, Jim Serpico, Walon Green, John Kane, and Mike Figgis, who also directed the pilot. The series revolved around Elizabeth Canterbury (portrayed by Julianna Margulies), a rebellious defense attorney willing to bend the law if it protects the wrongfully accused. A rising star, she puts her career on the line to take on risky and unpopular cases, even when they take a toll on her personal life.

Produced by Sony Pictures Television and Apostle, the series aired Mondays at 9/8c and was broadcast in Australia and Canada on Channel Nine and Global respectively. [1][2] Due to the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike, only 6 of the 13 episodes ordered were able to be produced.

On March 20, 2008, Fox announced that Canterbury\'s Law would move to the Friday 9:00pm/8c slot for the remaining episodes. Repeats of House assumed the series\' original Monday timeslot.[3]

On May 15, 2008, Fox officially canceled the series.																				Plot

Elizabeth and her law professor husband, Matthew (Aidan Quinn), are both haunted by the disappearance of their young son (Jeremy Zorek) and have just settled in Providence, Rhode Island, in an attempt to distance themselves from the tragedy and put their relationship back together. But even as they try to move on beyond the tragedy, those goals become elusive whenever Elizabeth\'s work provides a stark reminder of the justice absent in their own lives.

At work, Elizabeth must also deal with fellow coworkers: associates Russell Krauss (Ben Shenkman), a former district attorney, who was forced out of his job by his financially-strapped boss and whose knowledge will guide Elizabeth in their cases, even if she doesn\'t want to hear his reasoning or logic; Chester Fields (Keith Robinson), a congressman\'s son who wants to distance himself from his political family; and Molly McConnell (Trieste Dunn), a headstrong individual who\'s not afraid to switch sides, even if it\'s against Elizabeth.

Frank Angstrom (Rescue Me\'s James McCaffrey) is a private investigator with whom Elizabeth has a sometime affair.																																					                                  Cast
