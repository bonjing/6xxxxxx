,sisaoiaosiao,2011-06-12T22:32Z,I put you -1 because there is no sample no screens and too big t download just to see the quality :/
,maggot_corpse,2011-06-12T22:34Z,720p soon? no hardsub?
,perensap31,2011-06-12T23:20Z,@sisaoiaso If you'd have a decent fucking connection 8 gb wouldn't be a problem.
,perensap31,2011-06-12T23:22Z,"@sisaio . If you'd have a decent connection, 8 gb wouldn't be a problem."
,HolyArrows,2011-06-12T23:22Z,ty nice upload
,DR-NL,2011-06-13T01:01Z,"Dankjewel!

Thank you! 

Great movie as well! 

And people, please don't moan about the size, just wait for a smaller one if you want. This one is perfect for a 1080p version. "
,KarloV1,2011-06-13T01:37Z,"why i see on section cutted from screen and its black as i play it whit BS player
that sucks"
,bylaur,2011-06-13T04:03Z,"This video is cropped at the bottom at least 20% of the movie height.
The original probably had hardcoded korean subtitling and the author didn't want it shown.
It was only fair to specify that in the description.
It's the kind of thing you need to know. For God's sake, 8 GiB for a cropped movie?
You just don' do that. Not when you are a VIP.
-1 from me.
I do recommend watching the movie in full height, regardless of the hardcoded subs."
,addiction1010,2011-06-13T08:31Z,"Okay, to that uploader thanks, to the haters note title ncludes R3 this is an indication of asian origin. And unfortunatley these nine times out of ten come with hardcoded subs. Agreed the crop detracts from the view quite some, but it is alot better than the hardcoded subs. My advice is wait there should be a better version minus the hardcoded subs soon.

Anywho for those that aren't bothered: A:10, V:10(obviously the Crop is there but other than that excellent quality)."
,UlrikR,2011-06-13T13:32Z,NOT REAL HD !!!
,fylfo,2011-06-13T15:03Z,"@ perensap31 you sound like a douche. decent connection speeds vary from country to country, here in the UK my 5 meg connection is considered decent. downloading 8gig via bit torrent is a big ask just to test the quality he made a fair point. "
,sisaoiaosiao,2011-06-14T13:08Z,"perensap31 fuck you, i dont have time for these crap, neither for seeding stupid dumbass"
,vallhallaftz,2011-06-14T20:33Z,"The problem with NLUPPER02 is that the quality of what he uploads is random at best.
Guess i'm just used to better :)


Creds for working hard and all."
,thribbone,2011-06-14T22:14Z,This copy has definitely been cropped and then stretched vertically. You can see this in the faces of all characters which look slightly too long. Having downloaded this torrent I think I'll wait for a better copy to download before watching this movie. I guess you win some and lose some ;-)
,frogshare,2011-06-15T23:16Z,"It'd be nice to tell the people about the source, instead of misleading them for a 8GB download. Cropped at the bottom means the source is the hardsubbed Korean shit. Sucks."
,maxwell666,2011-06-16T04:11Z,"are retard uploader its true,sorry"
,13324,2011-06-16T21:51Z,Quality is good if you ask me.
,Gazooo,2011-06-17T11:06Z,"Thank you very much for this very nice UP!!!...
I enjoyed the movie very much.
The quality is SUPER!!!...
I didn't mind at all that you cut of the original hardcoded asian subtitles, in fact, i would mind it you hadn't done that!!!..
Keep up the good work and thank you again!.
Bedankt voor deze super UL, ik heb er van genoten!!...
Greetings to you all, from Gazooo"
,Elnasse,2011-06-17T15:06Z,"This is a cam version, but it is a really good one"
,SoundBarber,2011-06-18T18:09Z,"methinks I fuked up converting this for my PS3. the film cutoff before the ending!!! and since i foolishly deleted the original mkv, i'm downloading this again! ( hope the ending isn't really cutoff... is it?)"
,kwissie,2011-06-19T20:50Z,"Oke het is jammer dat er geen sample of screendumps bij zit. Maar al die zielige zeurders die minpunten uitdelen die notabene zelf niet de moeite hebben genomen OOIT iets op TPB te plaatsen hebben wat mij betreft geen recht van spreken. NLUPPER ik dank je hartelijk voor de moeite die je hebt genomen en ik ben bij dat ik hem heb. Ik zal blijven seeden tot minimaal ratio 1,5
Heel erg bedankt!
==================
Okay it is a pity that no sample or screen dumps are in this upload. But all this pathetic whining losers who gave minus points please note; If you never posted anything on TPB you have no right to speak. (I checked them and found NO uploads... so SHAME ON THEM) NLUPPER thank you very much for the trouble you've taken and I am happy to have this movie. I will continue seeding until 1.5 ratio at least
Thank you!"
,ziz0oo,2011-06-20T13:59Z,please all seed to make it fast its 8 GB :S
,spankbot,2011-06-21T07:55Z,"It's a bad cam.  If you live in a third world country, you'll love it.  If you live in a democracy you'll hate the poor quality.  Wait for a proper BR or DVD rip."
,SoundBarber,2011-06-21T14:01Z,"The movie is 100% intact. Ignore my earlier question whether the end was cut, it is not. And if this is a cam version I want their camera because its better than most of the rips that are posted."
,ziz0oo,2011-06-23T01:25Z,could any one tell me how can i attach the subtitles to the dvd player with the movie?
,kwissie,2011-06-23T12:49Z,"The title should say ""Telesync""
audio = good
video = cropped (but is logical... its a Telesync and there where the original subs...)
overall = oke"
,imnangler,2011-06-24T18:42Z,Quality is not so good - movie looked very good though...gonna wait on another
,Rodan.H,2011-06-25T16:20Z,"People, you did the same misstake as me, you missed the ""R3"". Sorry, I was coming here to whine about how shitty the quality was cause I'm used to NLUPPPER's high quality stuff. I don't say that I can do better or something so don't judge. Thanks for the up but I can't watch with quality like that xD Sorry."
,atk444,2011-06-27T10:48Z,"Having an HD camcorder is not the same as working with a 1080p rip... btw you can pay to get vip status... its the trusted purple skulls that know better. This is what it is, a early release and I thank the uploader for their time, I personally will wait for a decent ripped copy, without hard-coded subs."
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-07-02T19:46Z,Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch a fucking sloooooooooooooooooooowww download zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz ive been waiting for this for fucking days and im still at 85% zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz a regular dvd rip only takes 25mins to download. This is fucking shit. FUCK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,fightthenwofuckers,2011-07-03T10:43Z,Downloaded it and it does not work with vlc player. It lags through the whole movie. I reccomend avoiding this like the plague.
,kwissie,2011-07-03T15:29Z,"@fightthenwofuckers Go get a better computer... It is a 1080P MKV.....

Here it is running perfectly in VLC. (intel i7 though)"
,MaartenKant,2011-07-11T17:31Z,don't even try to download.. this is way to slow
,evilmonkey99,2011-07-14T10:56Z,"HI people. I downloaded this in about 1 day. I have a cable modem that can pull up to 26mbps. If I remember correctly, I think this downloaded between 700-900kbps. I watched this video using VLC media player and it worked flawlessly along with all my other 450+ 1080p/720p bluray movies i've downloaded. There might have been a part in the movie where the pixels took a crap but I just skipped back a little bit and watched it again and it didn't happen again.
All in all, great video and audio quality. I play all my downloaded movies on my HDTV 1080p LCD 32"" SONY BRAVIA with 5.1 Surround Sound. 
Thank you to the uploader.
As for any of my other movies, if another copy is uploaded to thepiratebay.org that is bigger than this torrent, I might download it to see if it is any better. "
,B1gBlue,2011-07-18T20:55Z,Don't waste your time. The video quality is absolute shit.
