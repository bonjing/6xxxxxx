,Netarangi,2011-06-10T23:03Z,Wtf is seeg
,dumas1000,2011-06-10T23:29Z,"There are tracker issues with this file, not neccessarily seeding issues."
,goingbaldy,2011-06-10T23:55Z,well  no seeds 
,Netarangi,2011-06-11T00:38Z,Something definitely wrong with this torrent.
,dumas1000,2011-06-11T01:14Z,"I cannot connect to this torrent at all, or at least not to any sources. The tracker is not functioning properly. I'm not seeing 1 seeder or 82 leechers on my client. Like I said before, tracker issue."
,myers23,2011-06-11T01:36Z,if torrent dont work try the magnet link
,zegga,2011-06-11T04:34Z,"Is there something wrong with piratebay atm? The site isn't loading correctly.
Will you be releasing a Dirt 3 rip? "
,Sinister181,2011-06-11T09:21Z,"Is someone gonna seed this file, or am I wasting my time?"
,Sinister181,2011-06-11T09:23Z,SEEEEEEEEEEED
,myers23,2011-06-11T09:38Z,seeeeeeeeeed.....ffs grow up u kants
,Sinister181,2011-06-11T11:11Z,"There's nothing wrong with their Dirt 3 Torrent... There are heaps of seeds on that. But, with this torrent, there are 2 seeds, and neither of them are seeding."
,Sinister181,2011-06-11T11:21Z,Don't bother downloading this. They're too greedy to seed the damned file.
,tredrzxcvt,2011-06-11T12:17Z,"how installation looks? because razor installer doesnt install correctly files on my pc, i dont want to waste time downloading it if it have same installer like razor steam torrents"
,tredrzxcvt,2011-06-11T12:29Z,"lol, uploading at full speed, but download 1kB/s hahaha"
,goatee34,2011-06-11T15:35Z,need a seed shroo
,eaglee955,2011-06-12T07:10Z,i can't register in tour < tptb.com > why?????
,Tracaine2,2011-06-13T21:25Z,"You guys realize this isn't out until the 14th right? Do some research. If it's having trouble being seeded or working at all, it's because it's been released almost a week early. Give it some time, keep an eye out for skidrow or reloaded to kick something out. I have 100 internets says that extremezone is gonna come through on this one for us."
