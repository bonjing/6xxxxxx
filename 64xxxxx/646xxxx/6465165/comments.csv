,LordBlazer,2011-06-13T04:31Z,Real?
,TurkishMasta,2011-06-13T04:32Z,Of course it's real. 
,GreenPianist,2011-06-13T04:35Z,"I will download this but I hope it's not virus, because I get them all the time"
,jediluc,2011-06-13T04:38Z,"judging from the number of .rar files, I would say no."
,scurrg,2011-06-13T04:38Z,"sceneline, greenskull should be good."
,silvah-,2011-06-13T04:41Z,sceneline uploads legit stuff so it's real :)
,endlessdrive,2011-06-13T04:41Z,"""password protected"" bullsh*t!!!! DON'T DOWNLOAD!"
,silvah-,2011-06-13T04:42Z,"yea it's real, sceneline is legit =)"
,Tao_1,2011-06-13T04:45Z,Should be.  The green skull and cross bones beside their names means VIP
,gabskiwabski,2011-06-13T04:54Z,"Most likely real, check the uploader's history. Thanks sceneline!"
,SamuelTheDamned,2011-06-13T04:58Z,"Green skull, whatcha think?"
,Terratari,2011-06-13T04:59Z,"sending started  9 PM Eastern Time (colonies)
which is 3:00 our time (civilization), so might be real,
and if it is thats pretty fast"
,bonao94,2011-06-13T05:03Z,Is this a legitimate file?
,bonao94,2011-06-13T05:04Z,"Oops, sorry for that comment. All the other comments saying it was legit weren't displaying until I posted."
[T],MelloYello,2011-06-13T05:15Z,@endlessdrive- U are a dumbass. Stop lying and go to sleep troll. No fkn password spag.
[T],artpepper,2011-06-13T05:31Z,"Thanks @sceneline. Ignore the noob doofuses, with their whining. They're too dim to check an uploader's history (which tells you everything you need to know).

 Instead, you get morons like @endlessdrivel, posting outright lies (""it's password protected""; no it isn't, you useless prick). Never mind. Against stupidity, the Gods themselves war in vain..."
,bigtexx22,2011-06-13T05:40Z,The noobs saying it's password protected are probably clicking on the magnet link which for some torrents links to some b.s. torrent that has a password.  I have not checked this one however.
,misterllah,2011-06-13T05:41Z,"Downloaded full file, it is unfortunately a password protected RAR. Don't bother."
,Virsin,2011-06-13T05:43Z,"Guys this is definitely real. I just confirmed it. Now its time to go watch an episode that I've been really looking forward too!! :)
Time to kick some Lanister ass!!"
,tdawg2345,2011-06-13T05:44Z,"real!!

thanks sceneline"
,HeyYou88,2011-06-13T05:45Z,Episode 9? But 8 just ran on TV?
,Mcalk,2011-06-13T05:47Z,"The torrent is REAL .
There seems to be some problem with one of the rar files but works fine with winrar"
,Da_pirate_guy,2011-06-13T06:08Z,"slowest download ever, seed ya bastards"
,darkscrea,2011-06-13T06:16Z,so whats the deal? trusted user but pw protected rar files?
,GreenPianist,2011-06-13T06:17Z,"omg you guys need to smoke some weed and chill
if it has virus it's ok, and if it has no virus it's ok too
good luck"
,sunny_rio,2011-06-13T06:22Z,Of course it's real. Tks!
,Kalambaka,2011-06-13T06:28Z,"why rar ???? There is no reason to split an AVI , moron"
,Fooath,2011-06-13T06:29Z,No trouble here. works fine.
,slogen1,2011-06-13T06:41Z,fake ffs
,Ludio,2011-06-13T06:45Z,"Yes, its rar, but no password ignore those that said so. Its real as well. Non rar torrent exists if you'd prefer that which I don't see why you wouldn't."
,caseyfw,2011-06-13T07:13Z,"Yet another RAR clusterfuck. Ignore this shit and check out Hero_No_1's version at:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6465332/Game.of.Thrones.S01E09.Baelor.HDTV.XviD-FQM_"
