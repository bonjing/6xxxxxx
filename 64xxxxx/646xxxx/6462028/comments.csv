,elturbo9077,2011-06-11T20:28Z,"this is better than the razor1911 version becuase u have a proper installer and don't have to select sid disk

skidrow version of steam is they have a proper installer u install it and press next and next until the game installs and press finsh at the end

razor1911 steam versions sucks becuase u got shitty installer which u press razor1911.exe and it installs the game until it ask u for sid disk 1 and with the skidrow version it does not do it 

reloaded steam version u gotta press the fucking steamback.exe to install

fairlight steam version u press their own custom installer which is better than 1911 and reloaded

IN OTHER WORDS PEOPLE WHEN A GAME HAS STEAM PROTECTION ALL WAYS WAIT TO DOWNLOAD SKIDROW STEAM GAMES BECUASE THEY ARE MORE EASY TO INSTALL

[T],dexto,2011-06-11T21:16Z,"100% working, make sure to install DirectX

1-Download
2-Extract the Rars

Any help?"
,MasterViking,2011-06-12T06:46Z,"Worked fine for me, crack files are both in a rar archive outside of the .iso and again inside a folder in the .iso  none of them were password locked for me so I have no clue what issues the other posters are having."

,majuaraan,2011-06-12T08:36Z,"@russian4 this same thing happened to me, the only solution I found so far was to reboot and continue campaign, but after you quit or die youll have to reboot again "
,Russian4,2011-06-12T08:53Z,"@majuaraan Ya it let me continue after rebooting, but do you really have to reboot everytime you quit???? I haven't had to yet. Hopefully someone figures out the reason for this. Other than this the game runs like a charm, crack works and no issues in game."
,Russian4,2011-06-12T08:57Z,"@""All stupid people"" All you have to do is use winrar to unzip the file, there is no password or other shit to this....jeez comon people, use some comon sense. This is a perfectly cracked game, all you have to do is:

1. Unzip every file
2. Install the game (whether using the mount/burn route or my preference just unzipping and using setup.exe to do it for you)
3. Copy the cracked folder files
4. Run the game...

Pretty simple instruction for anyone but a 5 year old I would assume. These are legit cracks, no viruses, no fakes. SKIDROW is the shit. Thanks :)"
,Pimbax,2011-06-12T09:44Z,"Since Razor's one has issues.. Im seeding this one.

Thx."
,colinb74,2011-06-12T09:59Z,"I see all this bullshit about RAZOR1911 crack not working properly. It is merely that... JUST BULLSHIT! I say this because:

I got this patch, on day one! NEVER had a problem with it.. No bugs as people claim, my chapters are all there to access and so on.

I also see people bagging out the game, some saying it takes 2 or more mins to load chapters. Also saying shit like the graphics are from the 90's. I have a resolve for this:

Take your shitty ass 1996 PC (That was able to play DUKE3D), drown it, get a job, earn some money and go buy a fucking decent gaming pc. Do all this BEFORE you come onto an underground site sprouting such BULLSHIT and making damn fools of yourselves.

PS: I run windoze 7 64 bit

But anyways... Go with what works for you and YOUR computer. Be greatful for these people that provide you with these games for free.

Try not to bag out Razor1911 for being the FIRST on the scene to get this baby cracked. Sounds to me like a lot of you need to go wipe your SKIDDY arseholes. I was seeding this game but I have now stopped due to ungreatful arseholes who ruin it for others!

,azisco,2011-06-12T22:21Z,"All right, I narrowed down the problem to the system.ini file, so if anyone is trying to use their save with this torrent, do NOT copy over your system.ini file. It's useless anyway; as far as I can tell it's just your config settings, which can be set again.

However, chapter select still doesn't work, so this was pointless. Hopefully Razor will come out with a fixed crack that works with their version. For now I'll just focus on beating the game."

,br31t1,2011-07-21T17:02Z,"works fine for me, had only 1 crash which seems caused through sloppy development of the game itself.  thx 2 skidrow for preventing me to buy this piece of shit, wouldve regretted it majorly. the story sucks, the jokes are lame and the movement sucks ass imho. way to put the duke into an early grave, they just should have remade duke 3d with advanced graphice, would have been better than this pathetic console port ..."
,Almeida777,2011-07-21T21:42Z,"It keeps saying : can't start program because "" dnCommon.dll is missing . i installed again and again but same error . What can i do?"
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-08-05T17:26Z,Duke.Nukem.Forever.Update1.v1.01-ALI213.NET is out (p2p release)
,zane121,2011-08-19T10:57Z,Works great its the only duke nukem forever download i have been able to get working so if you want the game download this torrent or buy the game
,mrpoolman,2011-08-24T02:15Z,"when I run the game all it does is open up the DNF page on steam?
I did everything"
,cobain87,2011-09-05T00:43Z,"Still can't get it to work. I'm experienced with torrents. I've mounted and installed, copied the crack files into the game directory, updated directx, updated c++ redistributable, etc. Still missing dll files. I downloaded a bunch from that dll site, but the game says there's no entrypoint for bink_setmemory@8 or something, guessing it's something to do with that generic binkw32.dll file I downloaded. Spent 2 hours trying to get Razor's to work, and another 2 on this one, just SOL I guess. Back to playing Deus Ex I suppose."
,magikp,2011-09-12T12:53Z,use this razor911 version sucks this one is much better+1 from me
,Aniketwww,2011-09-17T13:42Z,PLZZ HELP i get error dat iso file is broken i tried wirh both winrar and 7zip (i extract this file-sr-dnf.rar) Plz help me frnds!!
,9Od9meO,2011-10-14T04:06Z,"Listen up, noobs!

Install latest Direct X update possible, via  dxwebsetup. Search for it on Microsoft download centre. Save it to your desktop first if necessary.
Solved my .dll issues. 

Follow Skidrows setup instructions. I used winrar and  Poweriso. Use best computer in the house with all the bells and whistles.

Works like a charm!. Saves the game progress too. 

Best of luck.

Thanks to the uploader! Buy the game if you can afford it and support the game programmers.

Anyone with a walkthrough?"
