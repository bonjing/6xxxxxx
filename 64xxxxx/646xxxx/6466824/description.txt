ABSTRACT
This excellent title introduces the concept of mission-oriented sensor networks as distributed dynamic systems of interacting sensing devices that are networked to jointly execute complex real-time missions under uncertainity. It provides the latest, yet unpublished results on the main technical and application challenges of mission-oriented sensor networks.

The authors of each chapter are research leaders from multiple disciplines who are presenting their latest innovations on the issues. Together, the editors have compiled a comprehensive treatment of the subject that flows smoothly from chapter to chapter. This interdisciplinary approach significantly enhances the science and technology knowledge base and influences the military and civilian applications of this field.
