Amazing collection, and the biggest cd undertaking so far, even eclipsing the 180 cds of the Philips Mozart collection!"

Thanx"

@zeke90: CD 97 not corrupt. it's just a very short CD as confirmed by the booklet. There are some errors in the CUE file which caused problems when I tried to split the flac, but they are easily repaired by replacing some double quotes ("") by single quoties ('). After that the splitting worked out perfectly."
,zeke90,2011-10-01T22:38Z,@shadow57254 Thanks for Your info about CD 97 I have just split the flac according to Your instructions and i works great THANKS
