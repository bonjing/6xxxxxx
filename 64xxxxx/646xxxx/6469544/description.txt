Note: We have a number of exciting movies arriving from Europe next week 
that we look forward to being able to share.


We bring you a 2GB (approx) DivX conversion from the Cinefile 1080p 
13GB file we downloaded ages ago - next week we will share a 4GB DivX
version in 1080p resolution - today we bring you his 720 X 405 version
for those whose players are not HD capable as it is Standard DivX resolution
at nicely higher video bitrate than we normally use (1305k) and with
great 256K audio too

The world has long been "going to the dogs" as it were.
The reason for this is that most of the planet does not have the spirit of the
supreme human beauty of the head of this family - Ms. Julie Andrews

They are as Judas to her amd want to see her spirit destroyed.
They invent a new religion called "multiculturalism" in order to make merit
a thing of the past, and human survival impossible "against the odds"

Please do what you can to destroy this conspiracy of the wicked and hateful
against those that truly most love the dear Irish spirit which is now mainly
to be found in Germany Holland Sweden and such areas that remain, not to mention
Russia - where true love has endured to this day Im happy to say, as my own
truest love of the Irish spirit comes from my mother's endowed legacy as she was
undoubtedly from the lovely Ukraine - as we trace her genetic roots today.

Please note - the German audio track we posted separately will not work
with this version as it is for the Europe issue original movie file version


God bless
