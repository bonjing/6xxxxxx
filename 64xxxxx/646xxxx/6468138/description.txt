Dexter Gordon considered this his finest album and few would disagree. With the perfect rhythm section of Sonny Clark, Butch Warren and Billy Higgins, this tenor giant reinvents standards like "Three O'Clock In The Morning," "Second Balcony Jump" and "Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry" and introduces his most famous composition "Cheese Cake."
