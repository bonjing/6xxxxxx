BOOK INFO:

"In 2009, a new Archbishop of Westminster will be appointed, at a crucial time both for the Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain but also for this country as a whole. The Westminster Cardinals is essential reading for anyone with an interest in this appointment, whether inside or outside the Catholic Church." "Ten biographies retell the fascinating history of the - so far - ten Cardinal Archbishops. Starting with Cardinal Wiseman, Michael Walsh shows how the office of Westminster Archbishop has evolved in the life of the Church and of the nation." "At the time of the restoration of the Roman Catholic Hierarchy in 1850 with the appointment of Wiseman, the Catholic Community was still marginalised, an uneasy amalgam of recusant families, Irish immigrants and distinguished converts. How vastly this picture has changed is the story of this book." "Walsh emphasises the outstanding contribution of three men - Cardinals Manning, whose funeral was attended by vast numbers of London's poor, Hinsley, whom Winston Churchill is said to have wanted as Archbishop of Canterbury, and Hume, upon whom, as he was dying, the Queen bestowed the Order of Merit." "The Roman Catholic Church in this country is now a force to be reckoned with, having powerful representation in parliament and the professions. The eleventh incumbent of the office of Archbishop of Westminster may well be a person of considerable significance in the future of our country."--BOOK JACKET.
