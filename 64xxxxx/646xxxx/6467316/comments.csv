This was an Israeli move to try and get a strategic point from which they could more easily attack targets in Iran.  
Side bonus would be to portray Russia again as a warmongering country.

@Cyberjanne
Fucking bullshit. You seriously believe Georgia, having the majority of all its soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, would venture against Russia in a fight they'd never win? There hasn't been any wikileaks documents saying the US or Georgia was behind anything. So where are your god damn evidence? The way I see it, Russia was trying to win back its old Soviet pipe-line (atleast you have to think like that if you believe the US only fought Iraq for oil). "
,Pillesnoppen,2011-06-17T00:49Z,"And how is this propaganda? It merely shows a different point of view. Most people who watch RT (which is Russian Governmentally funded) would believe everything all the Russian media channels would have to say about it. I personally enjoy different kind of views on things. It makes the every-day idiot a little bit less blind. Just like how the 9/11 documentaries broadened ones mind and movies about the wars (Russian and American) in Afghanistan has given people a bigger perspective on the conflict. Green Zone also gave us a perspective on the Iraq war. 

So no, this movie is not propaganda but gives the person watching it, a broadened perspective. Mayve Georgia didn't start the attacks as the media portrays them to have done, for what reasons would the russians want to attack Georgia. You can't go fucking mainstream and yell ""9/11 was an inside job and US only invades shitty countries for oil"" and then go ""But Russia are okay, they're legit"". How about Chechnya? Large Oil funds, murdered russian Chechnya-covering reporters, hush hush and recently Georgia with the largest ex-soviet pipeline in the former Soviet. Coincidence? Perhaps. But broaden your f-ing perspective ya mainstream faggots. "

,kopfs,2011-06-21T15:12Z,"Lots of comments. Great quality a/v=10

The actually movie is pretty crap. There's not really much of a story to follow. Really just moves between a lot of shocking fictional scenes to try and get a rise out of the audience.

Many comments are saying this is historically in accurate, and that appears to be the case. An independent report commissioned by the EU found that Georgia was in fact the aggressor, despite being warned by the US not to provoke a military confrontation with Russia. The same report found that Russia had a right to intervene in defense of Russian peacekeepers, but found response disproportional. Both sides acted illegally with little concern for civilian casualties.

Important to understand that both separatist states involved were only added to Georgia in 1922 with the formation of the USSR. South Ossitia declared independance in 1990. They just want their independence recognised.

US interest in Georgia seems unusual, since the US stance in Serbia with Kosovo is completely opposite, yet very similar--it's almost hypocritical."
,ransukles,2011-06-24T23:28Z,"The independent report sponsored by EU actually said that all sides share responsibility. While it did find that Georgians initiated the actual war, it was a response to a series of provocations. The report found that Russia did not have any justification for the extent of the operations it undertook, which btw were clearly planned well in advance. "

The report found that Russia did not have any justification for the extent of the operations it undertook, which btw were clearly planned well in advance.

The situation in Abkhazia and S. Ossetia is complicated by the fact that unlike Kosovo neither is democratic and the current population mix of both is a result of recent ethnic cleansing. If it were like Kosovo they should be granted their independence, but unfortunately they are not like Kosovo. "

,Cyberjanne,2011-06-28T01:30Z,"@ransukles, what provocations? Sorry, none found in the EU report. Just Georgian propaganda and this stupid movie at least admits the war started on the ewe of the olympic games opening (watched by billions of viewers normally). Georgians tried to use that event to start a war of aggression.

As for Russia having been ""prepared"" that is pure BS, it took them two days after the Olympic ewe to respond to Georgia. That's on their border, no way the US would be so slow if somebody were killing US citizens, not do anything for 2 days? Russia ""prepared"" yeah right!

West support to Georgia, surprise surprise is about Nabucco, western pipeline that runs through Georgia, to challenge Rus South Stream pipeline. So, pipeline more important than Ossetian lives."
,Cyberjanne,2011-06-28T01:39Z,"One thing more for the doubters, Georgia had once before attacked Russian peace-keepers.
When the third break-away republic Adjaria submitted to Georgia, Russia had no choice to leave Adjaria in humiliation. Russia had the right to retaliate but with the Adjarians deciding to join Georgia, there was no good reason to stay... this victory led to Georgia believing they should try something like that again, and they did later with attacking South Ossetia.

But Ossetians are very different people than Georgians, they are not willing to be assimilated by Georgia. Many had taken Russian citizenship just in case Georgia would try to repeat the Adjaria military adventure. The only reason South Ossetia was in Georgia to begin with, is because of Stalin who added it, he was ethnic Georgian btw."

Wait when u collapse and moscow will be separate state than we will talk. you cant have oil all the time, since you have no brains, once u run out of oil u are doomed. What about Chechnia u piece of shit? why did not u defend them ? cause u r fake! and your dwarf putin is moron, fucking u all in your drunkard brains.  "
,Ifafa,2011-07-11T10:07Z,I thought this film was excellent but chilling as it reminds us that freedom is only there until our neighbours decide to knock on the door.

,accountas,2011-07-22T01:53Z,"I just wonder how dumb Russian people are, i see them acting like Georgia was agressor, according to the simple logic you will understand that there was NOT point of starting a war against Russians.by the way it was NOT the business of Russia to enter the WAR PLACE because the South Ossetia started the war against Georgia and Russia supported them to attack. also i see the guys who are saying that EU says Georgia was the agressor, i rotfled on that lmfao, turn on the TV at or take a look at Europhian channels of them are saying thet the agressor WAS RUSSIA. also I have to say that Russia is going to split in few years.Russia made himself hated for all the countries in the world. the oil will dissapear soon, the peace in Russia will end in few years, they are alcoholic mongols with no brain..

Support to Georgia from Berlin. i wish the best for you :)"
,accountas,2011-07-22T01:55Z,forgot to rate the film. its awesome A=10 V=10.
,nanoc_t2,2011-07-28T17:36Z,"V =10 A=10 M =5 Quality of the camera work and so on is very good, however film is based about some events based on a  true event that's as far as i describe it. Its so one sided its not even funny. From watching this film you are under the impression that the Russians started a war by bombing a wedding. "

,Timewarpone,2011-11-28T01:38Z,"The USA, even with all it's faults, is still the greatest country on the planet. Why does everyone want to come here?? Because we are the land of opportunity. One thing this country has that no other has is OPPORTUNITY. I hate people that come here and try to take advantage of our laws in order to change us. If you don't like it here then go back to the hell hole you came from. Try to change it like you are trying to change us. Your country will probably shoot you or jail you forever!!! Good Luck!!!"
