,Groovejet,2011-06-12T02:42Z,"I download the sample. The picture quality is great but the hardcoded subs are in the middle of the screen, whoever put them there did it to guarantee that they are annoying."
,yezzir07,2011-06-12T10:21Z,"is an HD copy without hardcoded korean subs coming? (one with a cropped picture doesn't count, haha)"

,JlM1337,2011-06-12T17:23Z,"1.5k s 5k l atm, slow download :/ Please seed"
,juliepac,2011-06-12T19:14Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD - the idiot who uploaded inscribed the subtitles in rock! They can't be taken out from the movie. Impossible to watch unless you're a dumb korean who needs subtitles in the middle of the screen... to hell!
,wayawesomer,2011-06-12T19:27Z,"I wasn't impressed by the quality. Maybe an upscaled DVD copy, but not HD."
,fuamiki,2011-06-12T22:17Z,Perfect audio and video quality... bt KorSub is a total turn off...will wait for a PROPER dvd rip or a blu-ray...bt thx anyways froggz;-]
,ronin6,2011-06-13T07:08Z,"i don't mind the korean subs since i am in MI in us military attendeding Defense Language Institute in Montery CA, it will help with my course work. i will be stationed with MI unit attached to 2nd ID in ROK listening to DPRK commo,  bring it on!"

,Metroidn1f,2011-06-14T02:12Z,"Why do people upload HD videos in XviD?  Usually to blocky no matter the bitrate.

Who thinks maybe we should give WebM a shot for HD Videos?"
,SubGum,2011-06-15T07:30Z,The quality on this one is simply not very good...
,RMGG,2011-06-15T11:05Z,"Guys, this is a cam right ?"

,Lucius_0,2011-06-16T19:38Z,"Absolutely watchable! Korean subs don't ruin the movie, I barely even noticed them! Why does everybody complain so much?!
Thanks for the upload."
,el_muerte17,2011-06-17T03:08Z,"Subs are hardcoded.  Why do people still do that these days, and why doesn't uploader put it in the description?  Thanks for wasting my bandwidth, will wait for quality rip."
,Faisalish,2011-06-17T23:58Z,"Damn, I have been seeding this torrent without knowing there's Korean sub for several days . 
Quality is great but the sub is annoying !
do NOT download ! "
,S3nd41,2011-06-22T22:12Z,"Wtf is this ""HDRip"" bullshit?! Please don't post crap with misleading names."
,pacocrowley,2011-06-24T04:00Z,"NOT RECOMMENDED for the following reasons:

-This is not High Resolution, looks like a DVD upscale.
-Although it's mentioned that it includes Korean subtitles in the tittle of the torrent, hardcoded subtitles are not used anymore, it's now dumb.
-Those subtitles are gigantic, 1/5 of the screen.

,Vegasbob,2011-06-24T12:48Z,"V: 6 
A: 6 
M: 7 

Seriously this is just a really good quality TS probably from a digital source. Probably why the subs are hardcoded. Not HORRIBLE, but not very good. Shame on the poster for implying this is an HD Rip. "
,ssdsa,2011-06-25T10:59Z,Seriously...all u selfish ungrateful jerks barking up the wrong tree...The Video quality is best next to a BRrip...And also the subs are not so very distracting...So better STFU and be grateful to the uploader for making available such great print as soon as possible...Thank u 'froggie100'...Keep up the good work...
,regxjin,2011-06-25T23:55Z,"This movie quality is pretty damn good.
I can't believe it's a cam version.  The video is just as good or even better than dvdripped.  Freaking nice.

V: 10 (for cam)
A: 6ish (a bit of an echo)

M:  Not sure yet.  only watched 5min of it so far.

Thanks for the upload.  Been waiting for this movie for awhile~"
,Autobogg,2011-06-27T19:41Z,"Awesome version. The quality is great!  Had trouble burning to DVD to watch because I realize its a Blu-Ray size avi. I have a DVD that can play avi and wmv but only on 4.7 GB size Re-Writables.  Any suggestions on how to shrink size and keep resolution quality?

To Commentors - Just download the English subs and play them with the file. The ViSiON subs puts the English subs over the Korean symbols. Stop complaining about getting a horse for free in the middle of the desert when you're other choice is to walk! Remember ""True Grit""? Think of ViSiON as Jeff Bridges. Otherwise, learn Korean and appreciate the work it must have took to provide this! Thanks ViSiON. 

To ViSiON - Are you still with The Avengers?

,pacocrowley,2011-06-28T07:43Z,"@ all those who complain about complainers

This is the HIGH RESOLUTION section, there's nothing wrong with the rip, except it doesn't belong here (and the gigantic subs)

""Quality next to BDRip"" 
Well yeah, if you watch your videos on your ipod."
,baya_bongo,2011-06-28T19:59Z,"1. It is DVD RIP not hi res video!
2. big permanent probably chinese or another similar subtitles"
,wayawesomer,2011-07-04T22:47Z,"@pacocrowley

""This is the HIGH RESOLUTION section""

Are you retarded? Just because the resolution of the copy is high, does NOT mean the quality is good. Most of the comments made were those who felt they were mislead by a title that said HDrip. 

An HD rip, this is not. If you want a decent cam with enormous subtitles, then download away."
,BetterRedThan,2011-07-06T14:08Z,"@wayawesomer 

You can clearly not read. pacocrowley's point was that this should NOT be in the hires section.
Having said that, there are plenty of others who will upload material "

,TheOriginalCoda,2011-07-15T08:15Z,"HDRip my ass. I watched this on a 1080p capable 42""plasma, and to be honest the quality is 4/10 for both A and V. Its only marginally better than a cam.
Was surprised to find the Korean subs were hardcoded (yes I guess I should read the nfo), but got used to them after a few minutes."
,sun2244,2011-07-16T12:09Z,it puzzles me why HC sub?
