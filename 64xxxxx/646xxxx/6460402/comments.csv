,Owen_L,2011-06-21T15:01Z,Only two parts of book one? There is a huge gap in story between 1 and 2. There must be one ore more parts missing. I'm listening to another copy right now so I'm able to compare.
,getsuga13,2011-07-01T19:02Z,"@owen_L
you are right, there is a chunk of about 50 min missing from first book, don't know which parts are missing though. also haven't checked the rest "
,paketa69,2011-07-11T19:05Z,"was so much looking forward to this, specially in m4b format.
Not downloading it though after previous comments about missing parts :((( "
,ximongray,2011-07-13T21:24Z,"Not sure what those guys are talking about, I've just finished the first book and there's nothing missing. It begins and ends just as the TV show did. Quality isn't great because it's encoded from cassette tapes, but it's still worth it because of the audiobook format... I don't think anyone wants these books divided into 2000 mp3s!"

You're a fucking moron. Of COURSE we want them divided! Why would ANYBODY want one gigantic, several day long MP3 per book?! Chaptered MP3s are the best way to put books on here...this shit is just frustrating."

All you need to do is to write down how long you have listened,is that too much for your brain to handle?, if so buy the audio books yourself or buy the books you stupid punk.I will not complain about the quality its free and becuase its free it wont be perfect.Fucking morrons expecting shit these days you get what you get live with it or simply stop downloading stuff,if you want ''perfect'' quality you buy it and others like me we arent so bitchy about stuff its free and its better then nothing.Fucking whining bitch.

,wyllson,2012-04-22T17:52Z,"""M4B is an audiobook file. I convert a bunch of MP3 files (like you get when you rip a book on CD) into one audiobook file. The reason this is superior to several MP3s or one big MP3 is that M4B files have a place-saving function. So if you stop listening, whenever you come back to the file, it always knows where you left off. I play this type of file on my iPod or in iTunes."""
