Product Description: 
Presenting a clear, comprehensive review of theoretical thinking on crime, this book encourages students to develop a deeper understanding of classic and contemporary theories, and provides an interdisciplinary approach to criminology through the contributions of sociology, psychology and biology.

By adopting an interactive approach to encourage students to react to the text and think for themselves, this book distinguishes itself from others in the field, and ensures its place as a valuable teaching resource. The student centered nature of the book is further enhanced by reflective question breaks throughout the text; chapter summaries; suggested further reading and web sites; and a glossary of key terms.
