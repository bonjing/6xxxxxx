   222 good-looking, witty, activist, optimistic cartoons concerned with the environment, social issues, peace and more, all by Andy Singer.
   I tried to include as many as I could find scattered on the internet and spent a good deal of time looking for better resolution replacements, converting to single format (jpg) and renaming to simple and recognizable names.
   I like most of theese cartoons, especially about bicycles, irrationality of cars, oil, consumption, arms. However, some are quite offensive, mostly to religions, Republican party (of the USA) and its voters or generally somewhat rude. I suggest selecting the good ones for wieving and sharing and deleting the rest.
   You will need to unzip the nine files. Pictures are grouped regardless of their content with the aim of providing several batches of mixed content, funny and meaningfull cartoons. I intend to sort them thematically and upload as another torrent in the future.
