Scanned clean with AVG 2011

Also the reason the crack instructions are limited is because it a keygen. I ran it sandbocie'd, I think its clean.

But my gawd this game sucks. Its a button mashing brawler type. It was supposed to be all realistic as in physics. But its not like what shown it the vids. 

Textures are horrible. It didn't remember my audio settings between switching game modes.

2/10

AWESOME TORRENT THOUGH!  "
