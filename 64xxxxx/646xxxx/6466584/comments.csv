,nsatampa,2011-06-15T01:29Z,Could you seed the keygen also separately?  I already have the full installer from Autodesk.com
,Mudstomper,2011-06-27T01:06Z,rjaa ur the man thanks.... works great.... +1 from me.
,shrauf_me,2011-06-29T20:26Z,hey.. worked prefectly for two days.. n at the end of the 2nd day some license code activation error occured. could u pls help?
,deejis,2011-07-03T10:53Z,"For some reason, while in the program, if I select the black box above the white box on the left at all, the program freezes and I have to force close the program. Is there something wrong? Or is it just me. Even if I am in the render box and select ""top view"", it will freeze because the black box has been selected. Help? I would really love to make pretty shapes now..."
,haidaboy,2011-07-05T21:07Z,"I'm sorry but this totally failed to install for me.  I'm using Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit version.  It won't even get to the activation screen.

I followed the directions in the crack directory in the install.txt file to the T."
,tarunisme,2011-07-07T11:12Z,"@haidaboy: I get an error during installation on every max version after 2010. The solution i found is:

Instead of installing froma mounted image, copy all the content of the dvd to you hard drive and then run the setup from your HDD, will work fine after that."
,haidaboy,2011-07-09T20:20Z,"@tarunisme.

I feel completely stupid now, but I thank u massively.  This worked perfectly.

I take back my previous comment totally.  It registrered fine after using the hint from tarunisme."
,Kashito91,2011-07-17T12:05Z,installed perfectly; but the crack doesn't work. Any ideas?
,duralyon,2011-07-20T11:54Z,Hey I can't figure out what the problem is. I follow the instructions step by step but when i get to the mem patch thing it says I have to wait till I am at the license page... but I am. I am at the page where it gives me the request code and has the slots for the activation code. Is that not the right page?
,thestiglet,2011-08-02T05:01Z,i cant activate. none of the serials are correct. ive tried coming up with ones of the same pattern but nothing is working. and the activation code in the keygen isnt correct either... can you help me??? Thank you! :)
,Squilbo,2011-08-14T07:56Z,What is this on the keygen about authentification?  I don't know what I'm supposed to put there.
,Squilbo,2011-08-14T08:17Z,Whoops never mind.  I got it to work.  Following instructions is good.
,crAmz,2011-08-18T01:56Z,When I run the keygen I get a process block under violation: Trojan.Win32.Generic.pak!cobra - Be careful!
,crAmz,2011-08-18T10:14Z,Anyone know if its a false positive? I'm not into risks... :/
,CyBeR16,2011-08-22T09:40Z,thx.. works great.. 
,multiman2005,2011-08-24T12:52Z,"The code i get doesnt cover all the textboxes, its too short..."
,rodzaman,2011-09-02T17:10Z,"Thank you, works like a charm."

,marshontom,2011-11-23T17:52Z,"Hi Guys
I've installed 3ds Max and successfully activated it, yet whenever I try to open the software, it shows the loading screen and when the text gets to ""Starting 3ds Max..."" it freezes and will not load past that point. Can anyone help?
Cheers,
Tom"
,icemav03,2011-11-26T03:34Z,"hey. i can't use 3ds max due to the fact that the keygen included in this torrent is not working. it shows ""windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have appropriate permissions to access them."" I ran it as an administrator and still nothing. If anyone could help me, it'll be really great. Thanks."
,Mark1003,2011-11-27T21:58Z,"please someone guide me as to where exactly the liscense page is, I am after clicking ""I have an activation from autodesk"" or something like that, but on the xforce thing it says you must be on licence page. help?!"
,Mark1003,2011-11-27T22:01Z,"my xforce keeps saying I need to be on the license page even though I am, please advise me as to why this is?"
,chris1010,2011-12-09T01:00Z,"@ multiman2005
I got the same problem. I have activated 3ds max 2009 with corresponding xforce keygen and worked perfectly but this time...dont know...as you say..the code returned by the keygen is to short hence no activation...I used serial 667-98989898roduct key 128D1 and my request code is:
20E3 GZT1 94J3 N63D 02UA 6ZJS 8982 HC3Z /32bit OS. The code should be 16 blocks by 4 digits =64 digits but the returned code is 57 digits [7FGXX7XT6Y87FCEPDHF0Y7LQ3TRND5X6Q439F2KLJN8JEYXKTARUN8C3Z].... anyone suggestions or info on what could be the reason ? this is really annoying"
,chris1010,2011-12-09T01:12Z,ok just found out that is doesnt matter if the returned key does not fill all boxes...IMPORTANT: Win7 user: LAUNCH KEYGEN AS ADMINISTRATOR WHEN ON LICENSE SCREEN AND THEN MEM PATCH WILL WORK:::fill your request code and copypaste returned activation code into activation field..IT DOESNT MATTER IF IT DOES NOT FILL ALL BOXES
,trolcia3,2011-12-18T21:05Z,"make sure remove all space in request code
should be ok
workin for me"
,LordOnyxx,2012-01-10T08:06Z,"HOW DO YOU DO THIS INSTALLATION???? WHEN I OPEN THE TORRENT I SEE ALOT OF THE SAME FILES AND THERE ALL ZIPPED?

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?"
,Hector25,2012-02-09T00:38Z,"Work well for me. Thank you! For those who have problems with installing, If you're using Vista or windows7, you have to switch off the account control before installing. Then mount ISO file with Daemon tool and run the set up file. Make sure you have microsoft DirectX and .net framework4 up to date before running the application."
,PC101,2012-03-06T04:07Z,"Problem solved, chances are you installed this earlier, didnt do something right, uninstalled 3DSM and still cant get the keygen or something to work. First you need to remove the traces of previous installs. If you install CCleaner beforehand it will make life a lot easier. Uninstall 3ds max 2012, delete contents inside program files (Autodesk folder), also under x86 programs, AppData folder Autodesk contents, just search for everything Autodesk/3Ds Max. Then run the registry cleaner in CCleaner, clean all that out. Copy contents of the ISO to a local folder, install from there, place keygen in install directory, right click and ""run as admin."" (Antivirus companies get paid to add keygens as viruses, this one's good BTW, but still stay safe) Install program following the .txt file provided in crack folder. Select activate using offline method. Insert random bs for personal info. restart 3ds when it comes up. Select""Mem patch"" keygen when at the license window (LMU.exe). When successfully patched, Delete all text in ""Paste Auth Code Here"" (Important), then paste the one provided in 3ds. Use that code in the program, you should be good! Dont worry, all boxes dont fill up. Hope this helps, no need to beat your wife now!"
,crimsoncore,2012-04-04T22:16Z,"This is really confusing! I dont see any 3ds max 2012 exe... why? only the caft, poly trans etc etc... how do I even start up 3ds max?"
,cjseaman,2012-04-18T01:19Z,"WORKS PERFECT JUST FOLLOW PC101'S INSTRUCTIONS AND INSTALL

DONT FORGET TO EXTRACT THE FILES FROM THE ISO, NOT MOUNT"
,jboggle,2012-04-29T22:34Z,"Rad torrent, thanks for uploading!!"
,adrenilator,2012-05-03T20:05Z,"Ok, downloaded it 3 times, tried installing off ISO, extracting to folder and running as admin, and every time I do tells me the Common~1.cab is corrupt... HEEEEELLLLLLLLPPPPP!"
,adrenilator,2012-05-03T20:24Z,"Solved my problem, downloaded the medium resolution library from autodesk, istalled it and installation worked..."
,Heduxz,2012-05-11T21:41Z,"Worked perfect! Thank you big time!

Also thanks to PC101 :D"
