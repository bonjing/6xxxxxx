,Lykos2210,2011-08-29T15:27Z,"Hi! I got a problem.

I currently installed (while I was disconnected from the internet) some Adobe Products CS5 and CS5.5 and everything works just fine but when I reconnect andreopened any of the programs after using it for the first time, I get the trial message asking me to insert a new serial key because the old one is invalid. Can anyone help please?? "
,Iyatiku,2011-09-08T05:45Z,Thank you. It works! No problems. Just note that it does not include Acrobat and if your system is 32 Encore and Contribute will not be installed as they require the 64.
,ShadowMastr,2011-09-13T23:38Z,"Thanks for the upload. I've been using cs4 for awhile, and decided to finally upgrade.

Couple words of caution, the included keygen seems to have all or most of it's keys blacklisted. I couldn't get any to work, thanks to the comment from zMTz one of his worked. I see there are updated keygens available as well.

The other is this DOES NOT include Acrobat pro. Dunno why.... just be aware. You can't install this as an upgrade over cs4, (I tried, waste of a few hours). So when you uninstall cs4, leave acrobat pro, or you'll have to get it separately.

I'm having trouble finding where this color finesse effect is in After effects, I have a movie loaded and looking thru the effects I don't see it. I'm sure mr goog will help tho, since the adobe help crashed on me...."
,WishEater,2011-09-18T20:44Z,"Tried mounting, and extracting to harddrive, keep getting this error when I click on the set-up:

We've encountered the following issues:
Installer failed to initialize. File not found. Please download Adobe Support Advisor to detect the problem.

Seems like it's just me. Anyone any ideas?"
,McGunt,2011-10-21T20:49Z,I managed to update CS4 offline. Just find a computer that hasn't got this installed because any time you open up an Adobe program and you're connected it goes bye byes!
,McGunt,2011-11-16T17:30Z,"Yep, pity that it doesn't include acrobat -- otherwise very goo...and the 64 bit apps are HUNGRY"
