,leoncie,2011-11-11T01:35Z,Correct that.  Something must have happened when I downloaded.  Redid it and everything is complete.

I haven't tried the generic subs available for this season at addic7ed yet, but i will come back and rate in a few days when i've gotten them all dl'ed/encoded etc.

[The addic7ed S7 subs for the seed currently breathing here at the good 'ol PB were solid ( http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6460672/BBC_-_Waking_the_Dead_-_series_7_%282008%29 ) ]

,libertaswv,2012-03-06T22:26Z,"Only encoded the first two eps, but the addic7ed eng subs were spot on. Generally that's true for the whole season if it's true for the first two... I'll update if they stop sync'ing later in the season.

Thx again, Anon (and s/l's)!!"
