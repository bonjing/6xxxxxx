I tried on samsung 3d & not able to play this video's too

a bit research and i find out that the max frame rate for my TV is 8 to 30 fps

Thanks to r3dcat for providing this video. 
he used Frame Rate: 59.94

How to make it work: ( reduce frame rate to 30 fps)
-------------------

1) download HD convertor software, i used

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6168821/WinX_HD_Video_Converter_4.1

2) after install

i tried different settings, but the one fastest i could find is to convert to avi using divx format

click +Add button to add the file downloaded.

4) choose to hd avi tab

5) leave default settings, change the following

videoquality : 8000 kbps ( to keep small file size)
format: divx
frame rate: 29.97

depending on your system cpu, it will take a hour or two

should work now.

Enjoy..."
