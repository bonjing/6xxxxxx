Product Description: 
The Gift of Story brings contemporary literature and film into conversation with the grand Christian narrative. This book examines the specific connections between contemporary cultural meta-narratives (the stories humans typically tell about themselves) and the ideas of hope found in Christianity. Despite postmodernism's skepticism about narrative, the dialogue with contemporary fiction, drama, music and film demonstrates that the Christian story can engender and sustain hope.
