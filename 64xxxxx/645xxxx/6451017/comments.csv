,filmy_lense,2011-07-16T23:39Z,What do you mean its being watched?
,LoLWuT19,2011-07-31T04:36Z,"By ""watched"" I mean some Anti-P2P company is randomly getting IP addresses of people who download this and then sending them to the downloader's ISP. The ISP then forwards whatever they said to the person who downloaded it.

What I mean is I got a letter from some no-name middle-man legal company/Anti-P2P company saying that Evil Angel Studios is accusing me of violating copyright. Apparently they own the film or whatever. It also said I needed to pay 200 bucks in order to avoid a future lawsuit.

Maybe this problem doesn't exist in Europe or other places but copyright letters like this are very common in the United States."

It's not financially feasible for the company to do this. They're just trying to extort money from you like a collections agency, whatever they can get. "
