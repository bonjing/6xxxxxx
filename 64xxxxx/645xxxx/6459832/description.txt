series seven


Following the hilarious chaos seen in the 1989 Christmas Special The Jolly Boy's Outing there was a change of mood for the seventh series of Only Fools and Horses.

Although technically the 1990 Christmas Special, Rodney Come Home was an essential scene-setter for what was to come, and if Rodney's courtship of Cassandra in series six had been a bit of a dream then series seven was the nightmare.

Rodney Come HomeFocussing on their marital difficulties and looking at the theme of male insecurity following his partner's career success, the change of tempo demonstrated John Sullivan's tremendous, and sometimes overlooked, ability to blend wonderful comedy with pathos.
