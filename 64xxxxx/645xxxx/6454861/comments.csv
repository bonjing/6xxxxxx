28 Weeks Later

in 720p
and no problem if u cant do (u must have ur own reasons for it)
And just one more thing I want to say thank u for whatever u have given to the torrent community (it saddens me that some uploaders just come to Tpb to promote their ddl's just to get some bucks)
~RESPECT~ "

,praveenbhaijee,2011-06-08T23:38Z,Thanks mate.
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-09T11:26Z,@.xDEADx.: Thanks.  2nd thing you might not like: None of  28 ... later can be encoded by me as 720p. They are long and 16/9 aspect what disqualifies both of them. I cannot break 1.4 GB file-size ceiling. Sorry.
,hazel13,2011-06-10T00:49Z,Thanks for White Collar.
