Blien Vesne

blien vesne is a post rock band originally from La Plata, Argentina. has a 5-song ep plus 3 homeworks as bonus tracks. the ep is called "five lessons to judy Bucknell. some people have said on hearing BV "is a sweet sound mixed with melancholy," It was as if somehow we all knew, and they are part of everything. Blien Vesne, the blooming of spring, is a bit what we mean, but without words. The affects are best expressed where they pass directly from the soul to the world. The winters can be very cold, even some become poignant, and these are crossed only by those who believe that next season is spring, warm and soft. Blien Vesne (bleveshnÃ©) is song for those who are going through winter, for those who have gone through. blien vesne is a road sign remembering better times to come. Blien vesne: poetry made song
