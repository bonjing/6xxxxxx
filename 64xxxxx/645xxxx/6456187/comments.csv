Although, I think you should have named it differently. Disc 1 is In The Zone but also contains miscellaneous tracks from ...Baby, One More Time and Oops... I Did It Again.

Disc 2 is Britney and also contains miscellaneous tracks from her first two albums.

So basically, it contains half of Baby One More Time and half of Oops. And full versions of Britney and In The Zone.

Also, checked with audio checker and is good stuff. Great work and awesome find!"
