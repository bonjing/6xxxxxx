Alien.Hallway.v1.15-TE


Much like the British, the aliens are coming. Where, exactly? Well, down the hallway, of course! Youâ€™re not going to let them walk all the way down that hallways to the bedroom, or even (gasp!) the bathroom, are you? Of course not, and Alien Hallway gives you the chance to recruit heavily-armed gentlemen to defend the halls against the incoming alien threat. Itâ€™s like the safety patrol for grown-ups. Or at least people with a computer.
