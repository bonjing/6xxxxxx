[quote]The project is born in November, 2008 from the RK's spirit. WMU's music evolves in a "Post rock /Metal" style. Influenced by the astronomy and the mythology, the journey between the space and the time can begin. The sound meetings are multiple. Welcome in a world where reality is next to the imagination, where emotion of melodies faces the violent winds. A demo and an EP are today available in free download. Pep joins WMU to replace "drums kits" by the very real sound of its trunks.[/quote]
