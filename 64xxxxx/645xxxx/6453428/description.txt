Various episodes of the show that ran from 1999-2003

The Jersey is about Nick Lighter, Morgan Hudson, Coleman Galloway, and Elliot Riffkin, four teens who discover the magic of "the jersey", a mystical football jersey that transports them into the bodies of professional athletes. 

This is done in a way similar to the way that the main character in Quantum Leap, Sam, travels from body to body, and there is a different athlete featured in every episode. 

The show has several sports superstars as guest actors, including Dan Lyle, Michael Andretti, Terrell Davis, David Robinson, Malik Rose, Tony Gonzalez, Shannon Sharpe, Donovan McNabb, Byron Dafoe, Michael Strahan, Kurt Warner, Stephon Marbury, Sergei Fedorov, Kordell Stewart, Jerome Bettis, Junior Seau, Scott Steiner, Eddie George, Adrian Peterson, Sabrina Bryan, Randy Johnson, Tony Hawk, Laila Ali and Danny Farmer.
