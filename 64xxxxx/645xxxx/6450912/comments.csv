,a_gatorpie,2011-06-07T13:14Z,Hey guys. I often see torrents here that I want but I don't know how to view these files. I use GOM player to watch the AVIs. Anyone willing to give guidance?
,a_gatorpie,2011-06-08T04:51Z,"@otisdriftw00d - I love the rarzilla download and even donated. 

@sceneline - I've tried the VLC before and got frustrated a few times. The unraring may take a minute or two but totally worth it. 

Thank you for your help guys...very much appreciated and now i can enjoy all of sceneline's torrents!! :D 

Loving the Bachelorette...this is a great download!"
,skalbare,2011-06-08T21:37Z,"I downloaded this torrent, but I onlye get the sound when I try to play it, no picture... :(

Anyone else who has experienced the same?
Any suggestions to what I can do to fix it?

I don`t get it!

Stupid thing!

This is the only episode nr. 3 out there, but I don`t get to see it, because of that, argh!!!!!!!!

What a waste!"
,zupergirl,2011-08-28T21:05Z,"No disrespect, Sceneline, but I just get upset and frustrated about these winrar-files.....cause I never get how to make them into 1 file, with the winrar-program, sigh.

Keep the good work going.
