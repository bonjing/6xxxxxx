just asking :)"
,mufckingud7,2011-06-10T10:46Z,"The show is 120 minutes long including adverts without the adverts it is still at least 110 minutes.

For this to be about 45 minutes my guess is the wwe adverts also removed"
[V],scene4all,2011-06-10T11:28Z,"The reason it's only 45 min is coz its only the matches, no segments. But u want the whole show then u will need to wait a bit longer."
