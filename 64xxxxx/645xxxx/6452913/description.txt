The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

This ninth alphabetical installment is: Bi-Bn

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

The Batman A-Z  torrent was well received so I thought I try doing this in bigger chunks.  This one was planned as two and is now one. Don't worry if you are behind,  I'm still seeding the Batman at a good clip as I'm not happy with the seed to peer ratio yet. If big chunks don't get seeded, if necessary I'll repost as two and switch back to smaller torrents

Today's offering: DC from Big All American to Blue Devil with some good pre-dc additions

These  Big Bang comics from Image-Caliber I have not read or researched, but it only takes glance to see they are closely modeled after DC, and are tongue-in-cheek recreations of DC and sometimes others at various time in Comics history.

Last, AC did an "oops" and started a series of heroes they thought were public domain, but DC has the copyright too. 
So they hastily revised them just enough
Thought I'd toss this issue of that in. Details in PDF
