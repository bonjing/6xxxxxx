BOOK INFO:

This book is mainly intended to meet the needs of
undergraduate students of Civil Engineering. 
The book has two principal aims: 
firstly to provide the student with a
description of soil behaviour-and of the effects of the clay
minerals and the soil water on such behaviour-which was
rather more detailed than is usual in an elementary text, and
secondly to encourage him to look critically at the traditional
methods of analysis and design.
A certain amount of factual information, in the form of design charts
and tables, has been included. The 
book will prove to be of use to the students of Soil Mechanics and Foundations 
and will help to bridge the awkward gap 
between theory and practice.
