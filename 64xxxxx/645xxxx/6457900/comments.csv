,Yanouil,2011-07-05T11:50Z,"Super marche impeccable. Personnellement j'avais déjà fait la maj v30.1 et la j'utilise donc juste la nouvelle cartographie (pas besoin de la mise a jour CD)

Testé et approuvè sur une llaguna III 2008.

PS : par contre il faut prévoir un DVD double couche.

Merci pour ce torrent"

,Eville007,2011-07-28T12:11Z,"Wasted 4 DVD DL's burning and it failed to work.
The CD update works, however the map DVD keeps giving disc error no matter how its burned ><
Ive tried to burn complete iso on dvd, burn all files seperate in dvd root, burn all single maps in root (seems most logic) and tried last one again with diff dvd, diff burning program and slowest speed all as described :( Looks like its fingers crossed and hope me old version from 2007 is still accurate enough for a 2000 km drive haha. Good luck those that try and succeeded ^^"

,tox53c,2012-03-17T22:32Z,"Hi, insert the CD into the Car CD slot and leave it to update.After a car system is updated, eject the CD. then insert the DVD into the NAVIGATION device under the front passenger seat and leave it there since it contains all above mentioned maps. Works like a charm. Tested in Central Europe with Scenic 2008. Follow the instruction ! And one more thing: If you get it for free, you give it for free and don't charge poor people like you've been a specialist or something! Greetings from Slovenia..."
