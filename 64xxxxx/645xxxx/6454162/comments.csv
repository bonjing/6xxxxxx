,capnwinkeh,2011-06-08T12:37Z,My max upload speed has always been around 115k is there a way to increase that?  (that is with settings set to unlimited...using deluge)
,FucHollywood,2011-06-08T16:30Z,Anyone verify if this is legit another anonymous uploader?
,capnwinkeh,2011-06-08T20:22Z,"Yea it is.  I'm the uploader actually.  Just didn't realize I had it checked for anon.  And for some reason it won't let me edit.  Been playing it for the last 3 hours, pretty good once you get past the initial first stage.  "

,capnwinkeh,2011-06-09T04:04Z,I will keep my eye open for a PAL version but no guarantees on my putting it up right away.  I want to make sure this gets seeded and I don't have a seedbox atm.  But I do want to thank you seeders out there for helping.  If all goes well then I may do the PAL if nobody beats me to it. 
,AcidReignFalls,2011-06-13T00:35Z,Why won't ABGX verify this? I'm afraid to play anything that ABGX don't verify.
