mr. Xpert... my advice... you should talk to some real experts...
get there help....
would love to see you doing good quality rips...
having 100+ seeders...

,Mr_Xpert,2011-06-11T13:39Z,":) stay calm everyone..! 

First of all,
banukaknight these are not my own result, as i mention in my each upload and appreciate the original ripper how ever their work but that nice to me.. 
2ndly I don't have that much bigger and hy fy system that is why i only prefer to download another source of this kind of stuff and then upload them at here so you guys can get it so kindly no argument and i have no competition with others they are most seniors than me and i am nothing in front of them..


ILPruny
thanks for appreciating me, and yes I've been downloading many series each episodes of BoB result but from my university's INTERNET Lab and recently a very bad scene happened, these 2 PC's which I've been using for downloading those were formated by someone. and thats a big shocked to me cox I think I've lost more than 100GB data.. and have to download each item again.. but don't worry I'll upload all good stuff but can't promise for good seeding but will try my best..


Thanks all of you and enjoy!"
