Product Description: 
Piling is a fast moving field and recent years have seen major advances in theory, methods, testing procedures and equipment. Some of these changes have been driven by the need for economies and efficiency, reduced spoil production and new methods of pile bore support. Advances in theoretical analyses allow pile design to be refined so that piles and pile groups perform to better advantage. This third edition of the well established book has been comprehensively updated. It provides an accessible and well-illustrated account of design techniques, methods of testing and analysis of piles, with a marked emphasis on practice but with design methods that incorporate the most recent advances in piling theory. "Piling Engineering" is written for geo-technical engineers, consultants and foundation contractors. It is also a useful reference for academics and advanced students on courses in piling, practical site investigation and foundation design and construction.
