,chase6342,2011-10-24T04:52Z,dido what TheMatkin1993 said
,chase6342,2011-10-24T06:27Z,"turns out you have to extract and then mount the bin file (i used deamon tools light) and then put the files from in there into data, patches, packs. hope this helps some lost people"
,za3tarji,2012-01-10T19:52Z,"@Chase6342, ISO files are mounting splendidly, but Bin and Cue files aren't being accessible by Daemon tools ?? any help plz ?"
,za3tarji,2012-01-10T20:31Z,"Aight guys, I figured it out finally. The ISO files mounted easily, 
then if you had at certain folders .Bin and .Cue files that you had trouble mounting. just right click the .Cue file, open with Notepad or Wordpad, then replace the name inside (blahblah.bin) with the file's name,   make sure to keep the "".bin""   
your welcome"

I wanted to start mixing in samples with traktor especially once I get a midi controller."
,JoelCassarOfficial,2012-04-14T06:00Z,"Iv got all the files and they are all winrar files, I tried doing what has been said in the recent comments and nothing seems to be working. How to I get this to work!? :("

,Jobot27,2012-06-13T22:39Z,I don't understand how you install these folders. In nexus it is looking for .nxp files. These are just waves.
,Gleeze1,2012-06-16T22:24Z,"All .bin files work apart from the last one in the list, the 'VEE electro essentials' .cue is incorrectly configured, and it cannot be mounted in daemon tools or alcohol 52%

to fix this is easy, just rename the .cue file to .txt, and change where it says VEE.bin to dyn-vee.bin, then save, and rename it back to .cue
