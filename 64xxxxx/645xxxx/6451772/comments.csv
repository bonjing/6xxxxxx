as you know i only do VBR.. there's a few rip offs of this from 128aac to all soughts of MP3s... there is one real version getting around.. but it's at private and someone didn't keep the original nfo/sfv files and it's a 320 rip.. 
everything posted public that is 320mp3.. does not match it! so i don't know whats real and whats not!!! P*sses me off.. "
