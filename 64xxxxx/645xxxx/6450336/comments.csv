@Harley81 - You could also try ImgBurn for Iso files! 

@flawxster - I am not sure what you are doing, but all you have to do is right click on DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT and a new box will appear, scroll down to Save target as, Left click on that and then it will ask you where you what to save the torrent? Decide where you want to save the torrent click save and your done!"

,Homygdogallison,2011-08-16T09:25Z,I'm fairly new to tottering. And I was wondering how I could download this and burn it to separate disks. I downloaded the torrent (on a Mac) using utorrent. After that there are 2 discs in the folder...they are file formats that I have never seen before (like I said...I'm fairly new to this) I have no idea how to burn them to discs. Or what file format they need to be in order to burn them. Hopefully I will get a response soon. Thanks
