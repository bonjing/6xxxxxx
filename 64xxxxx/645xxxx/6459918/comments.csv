,Aznloki,2011-06-11T13:33Z,Running the .exe as admin. The game save my last checkpoint but does not save any ego boosts or my difficulty level. Win 7 x64. Anyone else noticing this issue. I seem to have it narrowed down the progress.ini not being written properly.
,Aznloki,2011-06-11T13:35Z,"Running the game on windows 7x64 as admin. It saves my settings, and also my most recent checkpoint. It does not properly save, which levels are completed if i go to chapter select, which ego boosts are gotten, and also what difficulty level I am on. Anyone else noticing these sames issues? The problem seems to be in the progress.ini file."
,lawdretep,2011-06-11T16:52Z,Still can't select the chapters via chapter select. Mehh.
,dajupe,2011-06-11T19:12Z,"this game is a piece of tripe. i wouldn't normally write this comment, but saw a v on some of the developers hyping it up, and it shits me to see how much money can be made by the hype alone. shame on the dicks who worked on this shoker. give me right to develop a game and i wouldn't give nothing but gold, specially when u got the old crew looking up your tattered skirt. 1 star out of 5"
,Cunz,2011-06-11T20:06Z,"now the game saves the checkpoint but not the EGO...

anyone found any solution?"
,Trevayne,2011-06-11T20:31Z,im still stuck on the forklift level.
,Coma13,2011-06-11T21:06Z,"Same, I cant acces to select chapter and my ego is lost. I cant continue the game, who have the solution ??"

,Roboghrunt,2011-06-12T23:59Z,"your all wrong  the razor1911 duke came does work  there are no problems with it. when u install it u had to replace more than just the crack. every file that u see in the razor1911 file on the dvd/iso needs to be copied to ur install directory. i have win7 64x 
i downloaded this one 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6459396/Duke_Nukem_Forever-Razor1911
