Okay, so I couldn't find it here So now it IS here, in Dual Audio!

For those who don't know, 'dual audio' means that it had options 
for both English And Japanese audio. To switch between audio
(for me, using media player classic from the k-lite codec pack) 
All you haveto do is press 'A' :]
Thanks for SEEDING! And say thanks on your way out >.<
