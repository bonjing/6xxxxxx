@konoha_uchica: No, there are only 42 episodes of this anime. The manga, however, consist of 329 chapters in 33 volumes. It is all there on the wikipedia page. By the way, the anime does not cover the entire manga and has a rather open end. It's still great though =)"

,OnePiecePirate,2012-04-21T20:22Z,"Just finished watching the whole episodes. There were few lines missing. About ten of them, I think. 

E.g. When Recca told his dad not to smoke while working on the fireworks, in episode 1.

Not a major letdown if you could live with it--about 3 to 4 episodes only affected."
