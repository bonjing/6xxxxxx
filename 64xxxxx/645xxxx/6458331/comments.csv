Complain more and be more hypocritical please. 

Where is your comment on quality?

Comments never seize to amaze me. No news is good news. People are much more likely to post if something is wrong than all is good. "
,_censored,2011-10-05T02:42Z,"a/v - 10/10

@finkalyptic - happy now?
@sneed006 - this is supposedly a community, quality control is part of the communication. also buy a dictionary."
,bongojiing,2011-11-02T10:27Z,This is supossed to be a dvd rip..Huh..If so then why are the episodes seperate avi files and not  just 1 iso file which would be a lot better with menu etc.  Keep you eyes open guys as soon as i get the dvd i will upload as an ISO a complete copy of original....
,loxxikus,2011-12-16T04:24Z,"sneed006 is a fucking idiot.  He just assumes that if someone comments they downloaded and that the download completed.  Shut the fuck up, guy."
