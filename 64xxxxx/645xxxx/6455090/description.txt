
Fluid Mechanics, 2nd Edition by  Pijush K. Kundu and  Ira M. Cohen
Review
Direct-write technologies, the latest advance in fabricating electronic and sensor devices and power sources, refer to techniques/processes capable of depositing, dispensing, or processing diverse types of materials (including biological) over surfaces following a preset pattern/layout. The editors, with the Materials Science and Technology Division at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, introduce these commercially valuable methods for generating high-quality patterns capable of producing working prototypes so rapidly that they represent a paradigm shift. The 18 contributed chapters cover applications; materials for implementing applications; dispensing type approaches to direct writing (e.g., ink jet technology, dip-pen nanolithography); comparison with other approaches to pattern and material transfer; and current and future trends. Includes illustrations, appended material on ancillary technologies, and 265 references.Book News, Inc.Â®, Portland, OR
