Ch4 Meet the Elephant Man HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Just over 120 years ago, one of the most extraordinary figures of the Victorian era, Joseph Merrick, passed away. Merrick was named the 'elephant man' after developing terrible disfigurements from an early age. After escaping the freak shows to live out his life at the London Hospital, Whitechapel, where he was visited by the Princess of Wales, he became a minor celebrity and his amazing story passed into legend. Now a team of international scientists are studying the elephant man's bones, and Brian Richards, who suffers from the same disorder as Merrick, is following in the elephant man's footsteps uncovering details of what Merrick was actually like.
