Product Description: 
"Tales of Chivalry&Romance" are adventures which explore the two ideals which set King Arthur Pendragon apart from most other roleplaying games. 
The code of chivalry and the high art of romance are vital elements of the true knight's character. They can inspire you to great deeds of valor and honore, or if frustrated, can lead to dark rifts between lords and lovers. The adventures found within can be played individually for an evening's entertainment, or woven into your own epic campaigns.
