BOOK INFO:

This topical new study of France's tradition as the 'land of asylum' for refugees examines the tensions between refugee rights and government responses.This book: gives historical context and depth to current issues such as citizenship, assimilation and national identity; provides new and original historical research on an important topic previously under-studied; and situates French refugee history within wider European context.This book examines changing responses towards refugees in modern France through French legal, intellectual, political and social history. Critical questions in the book frame debates and policy: whether individuals had a natural human right to receive asylum and whether refugee policy was a matter for national government, or international agreement.
