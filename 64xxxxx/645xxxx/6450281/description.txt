Overview
 
Innovation is the engine that drives much of what is called success in business and industry. Incorporating the fundamental principles of lean manufacturing and the rules and behaviors of structured innovation into the development process, innovative lean development unleashes the creativity of everyone involved in developing new products, services, or processes; speeds the process; and leads to higher quality.

Written by two experts who have successfully made the road by walking it for more than 20 years, Innovative Lean Development: How to Create, Implement and Maintain a Learning Culture Using Fast Learning Cycles focuses on six key areas necessary for dramatic development. It shows you how to â€”

1. Identify and fill user gaps

2. Use multiple learning cycles

3. Stabilize the development process

4. Capture knowledge

5. Use rapid prototyping

6. Apply lean management principles, including learning cycles and visual boards

Applying these principles, the authors have helped development teams cut development time in half and increase speed to market, while delivering award-winning, quality solutions. In this manual, they share those examples while providing a road map that all companies can follow to reach a lean development culture, one where creative thinking and practice converge in ways that lead to innovation, improvement, and success.
