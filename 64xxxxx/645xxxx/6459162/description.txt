| Release note |
----------------

This is actually a re-release from an unknown source given to me by an acquaintance of mine. Quality of the film is quite low, it's the only
copy I have been able to get my hands to. The release gives some insight into the Finnish neo-nazi scene, but it is also a very personal story
of a real person all can relate to in some form. Features Finnish celebrities!

The purpose of this film is to inform and to entertain, nothing else.
