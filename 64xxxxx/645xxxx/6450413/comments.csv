Make sure you stay tuned to the site guys!"
,Laxidate,2011-06-08T23:33Z,So are we still going to be able to get monthly packs from the site?
,[Flux],2011-06-10T03:41Z,"Thanks! I've been waiting for this, for a while."
,r083r73h,2011-06-10T22:53Z,"So, who will create packages now?"
,[Flux],2011-06-14T23:52Z,"Nobody. He said you have to go to the dub-level website. Which helps with advertising, but torrenting would be the best way, cause then it wouldn't take all of their bandwidth. "
