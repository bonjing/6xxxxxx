,jhartsb,2011-06-07T07:21Z,how do i go back to ios 4.3.3
,shamoopan,2011-06-07T07:28Z,@pentatonic i paid 2 hours ago no reply either but the site said it takes up to 12 hours hell prob do it in the morning hes prob asleep
,shamoopan,2011-06-07T07:32Z,@pentatonic its late hes gonna do it in the morning atleast i hope
,pentatonic,2011-06-07T08:30Z,"Give him until tomorrow. I looked him up - his address (or, his parents' address) is posted in the Google checkout receipt. There's a phone number too. Plus google ""tvick47"" and you'll find a long history of iOS related forum postings. Worst-case scenario, if it does turn out to be a scam, we've got info. But I bet he's just inundated with requests right now. Plus, I think it may take a few hours to propagate once he's added us."

,kingkoo,2011-06-16T10:38Z,UDIDiOS5 promises quick activation but its more than 36 hours since I paid him and still no reply by email or any activation. Its frustrating. Paid to parad0x88 for another device and activation was done within 6 hours
,kingkoo,2011-06-16T16:20Z,Of course I am not happy as you dont even reply to my emails besides the fact that you have not activated my device number. I paid you with my paypal id igtc@emirates.net.ae. Just refund if you cant activate the device.
,kingkoo,2011-06-18T09:11Z,UDIDiOS5 I am still waiting for refund to my paypal account igtc@emirates.net.ae
