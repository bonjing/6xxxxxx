[V],twentyforty,2011-06-07T18:45Z,"@Swanee1 : Act as civilized man, please. Become familiar with uploader's rules. It is something you must do, before passing such stupidity, as you just did.


""NAMING RULE: name.source.year/season/episode.frame-format.encoding-type""

""      352p = frame-size 624x352(272) pixels, 16:9(2.35:1) aspect ratio, 
             playback ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file,
             unless file is made iPod 5.5 and newer, iTouch or Nokia compatible.
             It's ""crossbreed"" then with now abandoned 360p (TIP: upgrade firmware). 
             NOTE: Cheap LCD displays doesn't like this format."""
