Summary:
If you want to dramatically increase your sales performance (and your income) in today's complicated business environmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦this is the book you have been waiting for! 
A great deal has changed since Dr. Donald Moine and Dr. Ken Lloyd wrote their best-selling book, Unlimited Selling Power, a dozen years ago. Ultimate Selling Power is the book that America's 18 million full-time salespeople have been asking for ever since -- it contains more than a decade's worth of the best strategies the authors have collected from the most powerful sales professionals in the world. 
Ultimate Selling Power reveals how average salespeople in a variety of industries have created multimillion dollar careers using many powerful newly-developed sales and marketing techniques. It is a practical, step-by-step guide showing what the best, most successful salespeople in the world are doing to attract an almost unlimited number of customers and clients and to close a record-breaking number of sales. 
In this unique new book, you will learn how to use the most powerful words in existence to create compelling sales and marketing presentations, how to get the media to sell for you, how to sell to dozens or even hundreds of people at one time by using sales seminars, how to harness the incredible power of CRM (customer relationship management), how to find a sales coach who can help you double or triple your income, and dozens of other million dollar sales and marketing strategies.
