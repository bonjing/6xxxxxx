very nice rip...
please make friends season 2 in hd "
,ronnieaka,2011-06-12T07:16Z,"hey man could you rip up ""Of Mice and Men (1992)"" ?
really everywhere i search for it, the quality rips are over 4GBs. and that would take forever. 
seeing all your movies are beautifully encoded in less then a GB, i'm requesting you thus.
so see to it if you can buddy. otherwise, still you the best!

Btw, how do I know about which torrent you're doing next?"
,PrinceDastan,2011-06-12T08:50Z,"@YIFY

do you have any other medium that you uploaded your torrent to other than piratebay?

sooner or later, my 'clever' country will block like 10 file sharing sites and piratebay is one of them.

please respond.

thank you."
