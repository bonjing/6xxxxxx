Product Description:

This book, the result of 40 years of Hegel research, gives an integral interpretation of G.W.F. Hegel's mature practical philosophy as contained in his textbook, Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts, published in 1820, and the courses he gave on the same subject between 1817 and 1830.

The content of Hegel's book encompasses not only `right' or `law' in our sense of those words, but also morality, the family, economies (`civil society'), politics (`the state' and `international politics'), and world history. These matters are treated philosophically, that is, the treatise is dominated by an implicit logic, which has puzzled all scholars who have tried to reconstruct Hegel's arguments.
