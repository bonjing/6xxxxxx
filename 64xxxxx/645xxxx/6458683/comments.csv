Set 6 is almost ready!
(Probably by next weekend.) 

I just need to finish cleaning up 7 more pages of  the HDL JW Where there's smoke DJ scanlation and re-numbering the scanned pages of a T. Andrae book before releasing CBDA Set 6.

I have been busy with real life stuff and also recently acquired a few hard to find CB DD comics from Europe for later scanlation.
1. an European published CB Gyro Gearloose story
The Guard-Door DoorMat""
2. Best Verhalen DD: 134 & 135 for the
rest of the HDL JW DJ/CB comics as well as Scrooge the First DJ, Pied Piper of Duckburg DJ\CB and color Pluto saves the ship CB.

Next CBDA release after CBDA set 6 will be another CBDA VHS preservation: Carl Barks - Duck Maestro.  It would be nice if I could put together some custom DVD covers.  But, I still need to work at making better DVD menus.  We'll see. 

Since, I have finished collecting the CBL in color,  I was going to re-read all the CBDA sets to check for improvements and add in the CBL in color one-pagers with a few CBL in color stories for a big CBDA update pack. 

I gathered together a lot of the CB articles and put them in Set 12 and I was thinking I could put the articles in the individual CBDA sets which be similar to the original Another Rainbow CBL sets, but that could be more work than it is worth.

I read that the IDW Barks Bear Book may be delayed until January 2012 to take advantage of the surge in Carl Barks interest from the new Fantagraphics CB collection. 
The IDW Barks Bear Book will only include the Barney Bear stories.  The Happy Hound stories and Andy Panda story will be made available in CBDA Set 11, but not in the best quality.  A more recent printing of Porky of the Mounties can be found in Bugs Bunny and friends: a comic celebration.

If anyone has this comic, then I would like a scan of the more recent Porky story. Thanks!

Next year, I read a rumour that might be a new CB art-book series from Egmont that would include unpublished color and B&W artwork as well as all of the CB paintings.  At least, I hope so because the CB paintings books are still quite expensive for most people.
