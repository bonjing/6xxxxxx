Video quality looks good, but it stutters all the way through. Every third frame is repeated for most of the movie, although there appears to be a few sections which are ""good"". It's not my decoder or media player, the video is only Xvid and it's progressive. Seems it was badly de-interlaced or IVTC'd.... or something don't fully understand.

Unless you really, really need hardcoded dutch subs and you can't find them anywhere else, and you don't mind watching a movie which gives you a headache, this torrent is for you.

Otherwise, it's a waste of time.
