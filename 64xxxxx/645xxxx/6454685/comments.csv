,zappo23,2011-06-09T04:13Z,Thanks for the upload!  I've been waiting since S/B Apocalypse for this movie to release.  I hate how DC drags their feet to release these movies!!!
,zappo23,2011-06-09T04:20Z,"Then again I can't complain.  I'm not paying for them, after all!  I love the movies that DC has released in their Animated Movie series.  I am REALLY looking forward to Batman: Year One and JL: Doom."
