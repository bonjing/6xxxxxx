,crcollin,2011-08-09T00:23Z,well u might be able to buy a dvi to hdmi cable or converter i know they make those. the best 3D program for a computer I have found is Sterioscopic Player. I dont know much about the ps3...i know the file is a side by side file so there might be a setting to get side by side images to play.
