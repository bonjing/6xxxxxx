There are also Turkish subs and an English Director's commentary. There are English permasubs during the German and Maori moments. I guess I should be clear, the film is mostly in English, with a smattering of German and Maori.  There is also a German dub.

The first feature film by New Zealand director Harry Sinclair.  His two later feature's, The Price of Milk and Toy Love, are well worth a gander. They are all a bit removed from reality, or I am missing something totally unique to New Zealand and  its mating rituals.  Goats and sheep.  I particularly enjoyed the goat in this one.

There is also an interview with the director, and a short, Sinclair's first film, The Lounge Bar, both with only German permasubs.

Though without the lush colors of his later films, I think I laughed harder during this one.  Yes, there are some topless women, but don't let that be the reason to download it. It mostly relates to a film within the film, an awkward art film with German ladies, topless, telling a narrative as if they were New Zealand locals.
