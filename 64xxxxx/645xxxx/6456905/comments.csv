if you dont have anything helpful to say or add to the comments then for the love of god just shut the fuck up

trolling is when you go around the net starting on people and thats not who i am so bite me

also thanks haze for letting me and others know that this is MULTI 5

omg since when has it been a crime to ask something? by saying stuff like that your just showing your age.... grow up we all like getting games for free but its helpful when we can understand what they are saying!"

I strongly disagree with you about Red Faction. I started the first game and after 10 min got bored and never played it again, whereas Armagedon Rocks, its a huge step forward instead"
,Elektroskank,2011-06-09T19:15Z,"IGN's release dates are usually pretty accurate. It's just that games tend to be uploaded here about a week before official release.
Nice! dl'ed in 2hrs6min. Thx for the up"
