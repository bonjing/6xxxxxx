,CrossCrucial,2011-06-07T04:36Z,leechers are making the last 10% of this torrent crawl so slow
,CrossCrucial,2011-06-07T06:14Z,"subs in this release are incomplete. They were for the shorter version of the film

 replace the old sub file with this one for the extended bluray edition: http://subscene.com/english/13-Assassins/subtitle-445138.aspx"
,QborT,2011-06-07T19:47Z,"CrossCrucial  -   Those are the exact same subs, yes I checked.

there is no proper sub pack for the full length Japanese version.  "
