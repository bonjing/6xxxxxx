,tuvokk,2011-06-10T16:33Z,"How about a ""Collection of the truth"" instead of such useless criticism collections, which do not really tell us anything new. We know already that all these holy books are for the ones who want to believe something, and for these, there are plenty of holy books, pick your poison. But how about the truth, the facts, with evidence, and not just some stories without any evidence, which you have to believe?"
,sexpanther,2011-06-10T18:30Z,That's kind of what these books are - think of them as being like a crowbar to pry people away from supernaturalism and remove all the myth nonsense.
,sexpanther,2011-06-10T18:31Z,...and great torrent by the way - thanks for the up!

The search for truth is a personal journey. 

These uploads show to us that Christianity has some truths mixed with many myths, superstitions, corruptions and forgeries.

,aloses,2011-06-25T22:11Z,"Thank you for these collections!
I was once told every debate starts with research.  This offers some facts that a reasonable person can use when confronted  a Bible pusher.  Religion is a form of insanity and needs to be locked away for the protection of mankind!"

On the other hand the Father of Darkness, tehe very person that Jesus predicted as the anti-Christ - Muhammad the Bandit, Pedophile and Rapist has been projected as a God. "
