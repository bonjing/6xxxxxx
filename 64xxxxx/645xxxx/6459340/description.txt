Criticism of the Bible - Collection 13 (Forged):

The star of this collection is the latest book by Bart Ehrman: \" Forged: Writing in the Name of God - Why the Bible\'s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are\" (2011).
I only have the AudioBook version and it is included in a separate subdirectory.

It is a must-read (must-listen to).
