,makmak1980,2011-09-03T16:00Z,works 100%
,ThiefintheNight,2011-09-12T18:26Z,Sorry to disappoint boys and girls but unless someone comes up with a crack for the registration this app will malfunction after a few weeks - all the serial does is allow you to install it ..... and don't use it whilst online ... 
,leeroyjenkinsv8,2011-09-22T10:59Z,ThiefintheNight    you talk a load of shit boy talk sane man not trash i ve built 10 websites with this for free over 4 mouths free free free is king
,ThiefintheNight,2011-10-01T09:54Z,"I'm interested to know if this actually works as it is designed to, because, the copy I've used appears to work fine but doesn't. This software is structured to build a master page, which is a bit like a template, allow the objects of that master page to be incorporated into subsequent pages, and then those pages be developed as the user wishes. BUT, what happens is that the master page objects are not added to the second page, AND, when the user hits Save, or Save As, it will only save the new page as the master, thereby losing all the previous work. 

Serif have this cracked. By that I mean that after registration further coding is added anonymously to enable the software to operate fully. A pirated download may provide a serial number to make it install but it doesnt provide the coding to make it fully operational.

And I assume most people who download Serif products do not come back to the torrent site to tell of their experience.

If you have a different tale please let us know."
,ThiefintheNight,2011-10-01T10:03Z,"well leeroyjenkins you are having better luck than me then . . . all it does is keeps saving any page I make as the index.html or master.wpp

I can only say as I find.  

A supposedly cracked version of Draw+5 seems to work too but after a certain amount of time it throws up a message saying some error has occurred and closes and after that the file wont open again, in fact trying to open it causes the s/w to crash again.

I have registered copies of Page+6 and Draw+4 and none of them behave like these supposedly cracked copies.

I'm gonna be reviewing the Serif Forums to see if registered users are complaining of problems with Web+5, cos I aint spending money on any s/w which comes with errors built in. Walked that  road before with WebEasyPro.

but if it's doing the job for you leeroy, then good on ya mister ... keep going ... "
