,TranceJunky78,2011-06-17T05:11Z,"PrimE-RulZ, good lookin BRO!! Works like a CHARM, DUDE! I would consider myself just beyond beginner computer skill and this upgrade was VERY simple!... Ill give some advice 4 beginners here: Download the torrent and just burn the ISO file to a DVD and install Windows 7. Then after its installed run the Loader program (I upgraded the loader version to v2.0.3 by Daz. Just google it.) That Simple. (Dont download that WAT KB971033 update. Its to track Pirate versions and shut ya down) THX AGAIN PrimE!"

,TranceJunky78,2011-07-04T02:16Z,oh and its so clean you can even download that update i mentioned above (WAT KB971033) and still be golden. but i still recommend uninstalling and hiding it for future possible tip-offs to big brother.

,Dimmis80,2011-08-19T13:06Z,Hi guys.I have a question if anyone knows.I allready have a version on Win7 64Bit Ultimate English but without SP1 included.And they don't need Activation they are activated.I used a lot of updates and they all work fine.But i don't know about SP1(If i will install it) if it will ruin my activation and i will then need to activate it my self and i can't do that because the Win are pirated and stuff.And then i will have to Format and install them and stuff.!!So any help or if anyone knows and can answer my question.???Thanks in Advance.
,namshub,2011-08-25T20:07Z,"@Dimmis80: Depends on how you activated it. If you spoofed it with RemoveWAT or Daz's Loader, you can install SP1 & keep it on automatic updates.

But if you used any other exploit, who knows? You'd need to find a forum or torrent of that exploit and check in those comments.

Always know what tools you've used!"
,Dimmis80,2011-08-28T09:46Z,@namshub thanks for the respond mate.About the activation i did not do anything and when i installed the Windows it was already activated and sayd Genuine.With that way they were activated do u believe that i can install SP1 and i will be cool..!??
,icansex,2011-09-06T12:10Z,"the windows aero theme isnt transparent. its telling me its because my graphics card doesnt support it. i previously had vista ultimate, and aero was working just fine. any ideas on how to fix this?"
,KapitalD,2011-09-30T00:14Z,I installed one similar to this and it too said 32 bit and 64 bit. I want 64 bit because my processor can handle it. However when I install I just get 32 bit. Any ideas or help would be appreciated
