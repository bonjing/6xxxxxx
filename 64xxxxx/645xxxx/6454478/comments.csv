And it is real. I could watch a couple seconds of it. It looks pretty decent for what it is. Thank you Mr. uploader. Thank you very much."

,keishii,2011-06-09T18:52Z,"I've downloaded it twice now, first time started last night until a few hours ago (10:45pm EST - 11:30am EST) And then again at like 11:45am til now 12:50pm and both times all i'm getting is sound with the Marvel logo thing as just a single shot. Anyone else having this problem or can tell me how to fix it, I've tried using VLC and Windows Media and Quicktime, all i get is sound."
,FridayToker,2011-06-09T18:56Z,"@notnowplz

You still think it's a fake?"
,FridayToker,2011-06-09T18:58Z,"@keishii

Your missing a codec, get a codec pack."
,keishii,2011-06-09T19:30Z,"@FridayToker

What codec would I be missing, I've never had a problem with movies before from here. I've got Divx codec, xvid codec, vlc player that has its own codecs."
,keishii,2011-06-09T19:39Z,"@FridayToker

I have a bunch, VLC that has its own codecs, DivX codec pack, and Xvid codec pack, and it still doesnt work."
,Videographyguy04,2011-06-09T20:11Z,"Works GREAT!! downloaded just fine! Notice how notnowplz quit responding to comments only after commenting with some completely unnecessary namecalling... no need for that pointless BS namecalling, other than giving the people who read it with a few seconds of entertainment... so thanks for that much at least notnowplz! It Really shows everybody what a mature person you are. Feel free to retort to this or one of the other responses to you so we can all get another decent laugh. Great upload fridayToker!! 
Also, @ keishii... K-lite codec pack made it work no problem for me."
,FridayToker,2011-06-09T20:29Z,"Type Codek in to Google and install an up to date pack.
Nobody else has a problem so it must be your player"
,jsterr1,2011-06-09T21:59Z,"works great. fairly decent quality. subs are in russian, but hardly crucial to understand whats going on in the movie"
,RueLove,2011-06-09T23:06Z,"Keep seeding! It was going so fast now it's slow, haha.

Can't wait to watch! Thanks man! :)"
,Proudlittlebear,2011-06-10T01:26Z,dont know what the fuss is. worked with my vlc ok
,SirReno8,2011-06-10T07:44Z,"Thanks..

1.) Works great,
2.) DECENT ENOUGH quality to watch,
3.) AND it was released here VERY quickly, considering how NEW the movie still is.  Thanks Friday Toker..  By the way, this is definitely NOT fake -- notnowplz is the village IDIOT."

,dan-34,2011-06-10T14:56Z,"genuine... but looks like it's been filmed with a mobile phone, plus russian subs"
,FridayToker,2011-06-10T15:47Z,Some people are so ungrateful.
,KrK0,2011-06-12T04:51Z,"A6/V4
rus subs ?!?!"
,KrK0,2011-06-12T04:59Z,"Please include English Subtitles, to the wriden rus. text. Thanks"
,vangelas,2011-06-12T15:56Z,"average quality - probably from a a camera. the main problem is that the subtitimes for the parts in german, are in russian."
,varadrake,2011-06-13T08:56Z,thanks FridayToker
,Polant,2011-06-13T16:09Z,"The A/V is about what you'd expect for a movie that was recently released, but it's still unwatchable in my opinion."
,Chizach124,2011-06-15T20:55Z,"Hey you need to actually rip from the DVD so we can have ""SUBTITLES"" This is Chizach124 singing  off"
,jake4954,2011-06-16T19:04Z,"OK quality, post some screenies guys to warn peeps and to persuade pepes tog et it,  ive seen worse, kunfu panda 2 is terrible quality ;/"
,EthanZag,2011-06-17T20:23Z,Great film however Subtitles in Russian was a major issue as at least 10-15 minutes of the film was in other languages ie German and the subtitles were of no use. So No clue what was being said for key sections of the film. Still enjoyed it but would rather get an English version.
,FridayToker,2011-06-17T21:45Z,"If you want me to up one with English subtitles, I'll do it if enough people ask for it!"
,FridayToker,2011-06-18T09:46Z,"Here's the link for the one with English subtitles.

,FridayToker,2011-06-21T13:54Z,"I usually just ignore them as they are either retarded or just trying to wind people up.

There is no way you can get DVD quality until it comes out on DVD.
"
,jake4954,2011-06-24T21:26Z,"LOL at the retards, this is good quality for a newish movie, if uve seen some of the movie torrent on this site they are shitttt this is great, watchable :D"

,slypuppy,2011-07-01T20:05Z,thank you very much for this. you have been most kind
,Jack_Sparrow2011,2011-07-02T23:30Z,"I'm with the others. It's not DVD because it's only in theaters. The only way to get DVD quality in a movie is to get a camera that Hollywood uses. Fast downlaod, free, good movie. Haters shut the fuck up and love what you have!"
,Jack_Sparrow2011,2011-07-02T23:31Z,Btw thanx a lot Toker for providing a torrent of this with a LOT of seeders :D
,Jack_Sparrow2011,2011-07-02T23:32Z,"and if anyone has a codec problem, download VLC player. It plays almost every type of codec. Free, reliable program. :D"
,dandeedan,2011-09-14T19:54Z,"and if anyone has a codec problem, download VLC player. It plays almost every type of codec'' U fuking DUMBASS!!! No 1 likes these gayass VLC Codec crappy copy movies!
