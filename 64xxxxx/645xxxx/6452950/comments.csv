dude its a wrothelss episode of RAW so why are you uploading 4.54 for 720 p when the human eye can barely tell the difference and you guys watch this on your pc losers  mp4 means you have to watch this on your pc or burn this on a dvd hello 2011 streaming avi buy a hdtv and stream its 2011 "

If u were that smart enough to read, u would have found out that its both raw and tough enough in one file, that's why its 4gb idiot!!!. But u being a smartass u always comment before reading and bitch about mp4 formats, we don't need to see u cry every week, that aint going to change anyones mind. These rudos files are for those rudos peeps that don't worry about what format it is, and only care about the quality, unlike u. Oh and FYI i don't watch this on my pc, i watch it on my PS3, why don't u throw that shitty xbox 360 and get a PS3 so u don't have to come here every week and cry on each and ever rudos torrent out there."
