This is an almost-complete collection of WOK Music's (http://music.service-1.de/) VSTs. It is a collection of all the VSTs I could bring together, including the free ones. There were a few that I simply could not get a hold of, but the majority of the VSTs are here. Here's what you get:

Cromina String Machine
dTUNE Soft Detuner
CromFX Vintage Effects
SIMPSHI Simple Pitch Shifter
Moogofilter

ClockWOrK Stepsequencer including Ratchit MIDI Trigger Effect
Racktube Overdrive
StepCut Filter

A couple of the plugins I just couldn't find. They are:
daBUMZ Drum Synthesizer
Skalenmeister Chordgenerator
Polymeister Force2Scale
Midi-Filter Pro
Quatropolis Chorus Pro (appears that it hasn't been released yet)

If anyone has those plugins, I welcome a supplemental torrent. In the meantime, here is the most complete collection I could put together.
