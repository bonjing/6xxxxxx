Title: Ultrafilters and Topologies on Groups (De Gruyter Expositions in Mathematics)

Author(s): Yevhen Zelenyuk

This book presents the relationship between ultrafilters and topologies on groups. It shows how ultrafilters are used in constructing topologies on groups with extremal properties and how topologies on groups serve in deriving algebraic results about ultrafilters. Topics covered include: topological and left topological groups, ultrafilter semigroups, local homomorphisms and automorphisms, subgroups and ideal structure of \u00c3\u0178G, almost maximal spaces and projectives of finite semigroups, resolvability of groups. This is a self-contained book aimed at graduate students and researchers working in topological algebra and adjacent areas. From the contents: Topological Groups Ultrafilters Topological Spaces with Extremal Properties Left Invariant Topologies and Strongly Discrete Filters Topological Groups with Extremal Properties The Semigroup \u00c3\u0178S Ultrafilter Semigroups Finite Groups in \u00c3\u0178G Ideal Structure of \u00c3\u0178S Almost Maximal Topological Groups and Spaces Resolvability Open Problems
