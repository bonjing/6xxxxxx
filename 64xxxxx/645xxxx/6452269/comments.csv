Any solutions ? "
,americanderp,2011-06-14T17:52Z,When I try to start the setup it starts looping consent.exe and freezes the folder .. running vista 32 never had this problem before what do I do?
,americanderp,2011-06-14T17:54Z,"10 seconds after I submitted that it worked, so I'm going to assume it was my antivirus checking it."
,Pstrosatko,2011-06-18T15:04Z,dosen't work for me either as it freezes right on start. needs to be cracked properly imo.
