P.S-Why aren't there any seeders?"
,Riddhiman,2011-06-10T16:52Z,"There seems to be a problem mate. 
When I try to download the torrent the page refreshes,then it says- ""No Input File specified"". Tried downloading it from other websites as well and no luck."
,Riddhiman,2011-06-13T14:26Z,"Finally managed to download it from another website where you had also posted. Quality is good. 
But why did you pillar-box it into 16:9 . The original aspect ratio is 4:3. Hence there will be some loss of horizontal resolution from 480 to 404.
But any ways many many thanks for keeping my request. Keep up the good work

P.S-Eagerly awaiting JP2 and JP3 in fullscreen  from you."
,V3nDetta_2,2011-06-13T15:43Z,working on those now. Yeah i realize the aspect ration was out of wack. was in a bit of a hurry to get to work. will have the other 2 up soon
,Riddhiman,2011-06-14T08:59Z,"Please post JP2 and JP3 Fullscreen in 4:3 aspect ratio not 16:9 pillarbox! And don't hardcode the subs as you did with the previous JP3 release.


P.S:I don't know ,this'll probably be too difficult for you .But if you ever have the time and space on your hard drive then can you re-post Jurassic Park fullscreen in 4:3 to preserve the original aspect ratio."
