Kerrelyn Sparks's first paranormal romance, How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire, flew out of the bat cave in 2005 and survived three weeks on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list. In 2006, Vamps and the City became the second book in the Love at Stake series. Kerrelyn lives in the Greater Houston area with her husband and brilliant children. At this time, there are no vampires in her family. Werewolves are another matter entirely.
