,tomasjose,2011-06-07T21:37Z,"Hey, Xandecs! 
Will you be uploading all of the E3 footage from June 7 to June 9?"
,Brenry,2011-06-07T21:39Z,why's it say HDTV when its 360p ?  Please reupload the 720+ version
,tomasjose,2011-06-07T22:12Z,your avi files arent standard please upload standard avi or mp4
,Xandecs,2011-06-08T01:17Z,"@tomasjose Sorry mate! I don't know much about what's standard and what's not. :S

And I don't think I will upload all footage, just the main Press Conferences. It's a lot of work you know. ;)"
,tomasjose,2011-06-08T08:12Z,"ok Xandecs thanks, but the mp4 isn't working either"
,Xandecs,2011-06-08T14:20Z,"@tomasjose That sucks. :S
I never watch on my PS3, so I wouldn't mind. But I can understand it sucks. :P But I wouldn't know how to fix it."
