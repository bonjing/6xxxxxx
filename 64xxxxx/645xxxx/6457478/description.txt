Browse your collection
Browse all your photos right away. Unlike catalog-based photo
applications, you donâ€™t need to waste valuable time importing files that
are already on your computer and connected devices. Access your folders
and files live, in real time. Sort, group and filter photos by camera
information, edited state or other criteria for super fast scanning. You
can also browse by date or event to see photos from a specific occasion.

Organize from the start
Hit the ground running. Specify categories, add keywords and create
backups as you upload photos from your camera, card reader or other
device. When importing is done, your images are ready for you to browse
and share.

Bring together over 100 file types into one convenient place. View,
manage, and get extensive format support for your photos, audio, and
video clips including BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG, PSD, MP3, MPEG, TIFF, WAV and
many others

Manage your collection the way that works best for you. Unlike other

system. Create your own categories and keywords, mark favorites, edit
your metadata, and rate your shots. Rename, resize, rotate, or edit file
information on groups of photos at once. Plus tag your best photos and
bring them all together for further editing or sharing.

Find any photo
ACDSee 12's powerful search tools can help you find any photo, even if
you have thousands in your collection. Enter keyword phrases like
â€œsummer vacationâ€ or â€œschool playâ€, search only specific folders, and
find that one special image with the Quick Search bar. Or perform more
detailed searches and save them for ongoing use

Perfect your photos with easy-to-use editing tools
Instantly correct exposure, fix red eye, and erase unwanted objects.
Rescue photos that are too light or dark with a single click. Turn your
photos black and white, add text, and put a finishing touch such as a
vignette, border or drop shadow. Apply creative effects to selected
areas of your photos. Edit with the peace of mind that your original
files are never altered. With ACDSee, it's never too late to achieve the
shot you were hoping to get.
