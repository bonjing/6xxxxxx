,Ravath,2011-06-26T03:55Z,"This is my first and last ViP3R torrent.  The audio in the beginning was terribly desynched (~570 ms), so I spent a few minutes to line it up properly only to find that it was desynched again in a different part of the movie.  I stepped through and found 3 distinct timings throughout the playback.  I personally can't stand misaligned audio, so this is a definite no go."
