Notes: This is the third recording from the Ten Cent Shooters, who hail from Western Australia. "Early Country Blues continues to inspire us, together with a couple of other influences as evidenced on the CD. As always, this is a traditional 'Shooters recording' - no overdubs, no special effects. We try to capture our live sound as realistically as possible."
