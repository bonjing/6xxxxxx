|   Australia is lucky enough to call many great comic actors and comedians    |
|   their own - Gina Riley, Jane Turner, Glenn Robbins, Eric Bana - and has    |
|   produced such fine comedies like "Kath & Kim", "Big Girl's Blouse",        |
|   "Fast Forward" and "Full Frontal". Joining the list of greats is Chris     |
|   Lilley and his terrific 6-part mockumentary "We Can Be Heroes: Finding     |
|   the Australian of the Year".                                               |
|                                                                              |
|   In the tradition of "Best in Show" and "Drop Dead Gorgeous", "We Can Be    |
|   Heroes" follows the lives of several contestants, in this case, for the    |
|   Australian of the Year award. Lilley plays all of the 5 nominees           |
|   himself, and does a great job of showcasing his acting abilities, as       |
|   well as brining life to some memorable characters, most of all school      |
|   girl Ja'mie who really deserves a show of her own. Each of the nominees    |
|   that Lilley plays are very different from one another. The outgoing        |
|   Ricky, the stuck-up Ja'mie, the modest Pat, the arrogant Phil and the      |
|   hilarious Daniel.                                                          |
|                                                                              |
|   Each of the 5 nominees have all been nominated for various reasons, some   |
|   more convincing than others, and some totally absurd. But that just adds   |
|   to the humour of the show. The characters are not all likable, but it's    |
|   better that way. Lilley is backed-up by a terrific group of supporting     |
|   cast who play the friends and family of the nominees, and each of them     |
|   do a great job given the short periods of time they are on screen for.     |
|   The narration from Jennifer Byrne gives the show an authentic feel. A      |
|   great show, would be awesome to see a second season with some outrageous   |
|   new characters, or Ja'mie in her own show!    --boyinflares                |
