just want a reply if vlc video output could be as same as powerdvd by making some changes
I myself does n `t think so far"
,Night_89,2011-06-09T16:46Z,"even if I watch Screener file Or Cam in powerdvd 11, it looks like dvdrip
video quality is much sharper and brighter"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-09T19:34Z,"@Night 89
vlc is less good than powerdvd 11 indeed.
what is your video card ? proc and ram ?
did you try to activate gpu acceleration option on vlc ?
btw your link is dead :s
In fact it depends of the quality of the copy you got.
Screener and Cam are often in average-low quality sometimes.Anyway,if your copy has a bad quality,it does not exist any real specific player who will help you a lot to resolve this problem.
depending of the codec,format,bitstream and pixel quality
(pixel quality is often the real problem)
i don't think you will find a specific player who will help you a lot to resolve this problem.
Try to convert your file in another format.
I myself have a small preference for powerdvd older version like : 7.3 or 8
let me know more ...
which format is it ?
Porn movies ? lol :p ...joke !
cu around"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-09T19:43Z,"is there anybody who would like to get the ""N"" version ? x86 or x64 ?
Enterprise or all edition ?
I can up any ""N"" version edition...
let me know here asap.
x64 version edition like this one will be up soon :)
regards"
,Night_89,2011-06-11T03:27Z,"its not about the format or any other thing
it`s just powerdvd is superior than vlc in video quality
I was just wondering if someone could help me making the vlc video quality as same as powerdvd
but now I imagine its far not possible
and if anyone could do it, its the developers and they are not replying"
,virus49130,2011-06-11T09:38Z,Is it possible to burn it on a CD or we must burn it on a DVD ? (only CDs are bootable)
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-11T18:35Z,"@virus49130 :
2,32 Go on one cd ? hummm...
Impossible bro !
you must use one dvd for that !
cd = max 800 mb...
regards"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-11T18:39Z,"@virus49130 :
no bro ! a dvd can be bootable as well...
unless you have a cd recorder only huh ?
you must have and use a dvd recorder and use one dvd media for.
this file is bootable,fortunately indeed !
cheers"
[T],Tyr3ll,2011-06-11T18:49Z,"@Night_89 :
that's sure bro !
Powerdvd has forcibly a better potential than vlc indeed.
however vlc is free and i think not a so bad player also.
I suggest you to try different settings and see what's the best between each of them for you so.
Even i guess you already have tried it...
sorry for you mate :s
regards"
