Hi there
another new great stuff for anyone who speak french.
This is the new iso from MSDN/Technet as DVD retail.
This new version of Windows 7 SP1 x86 French is normaly the "Ultimate" edition
This explain why this file is still named : ultimate.
However like my previous torrent about,i removed the "ei.cfg" from the source folder from the DVD itself .
That means you will be able to choose between all edition except "Enterprise" edition then.
Starter/Home Basic/Home Premium/Pro/Ultimate
Except this change i made about,this file is absolutely untouched.
Original iso directly from MSDN/Technet and dated from April 12
and delivered such as.
it is the second edition of this file;
first edition of this file was from 21 November 2010.(see my previous torrent)

As usual use fast up speed,please ! i work better in cooperative mod with that.
All peers with an ip starting by 41. must use utorrent 2.2.1 only if possible.
Avoid utorrent 3 as it seems make too much congestion on my torrent network within .
I saw so much peers on utorrent v 3 with crap results...
Avoid using too old version such totaly outdated as well...
Or i well fear you will get nothing at all...
avoid to use any proxy : crap...
VPN connection are slower,don't forget that !!!
avoid to filtering too much your ip or mask it so much...
In certain cases this will not help at all.
No crack or serial or loader is uncluded.
You can easily find all you need there on tpb.
Be patient as i don't have more than 1 meg up speed.
this may take a while for few of you to get it but don't worry it will be your soon :) 
100 % clean and reliable. No hidden bullshits inside .
Btw,the "ei.cfg" file can be restored at anytime as well.
...
this file is quite hard to grab and find,that's why i give you the nice and rare opportunity to get it.
This way i hope you'll really enjoy it .
PS: when you'll get this file check if "ei.cfg" is present again on "source" folder inside of your iso.In case it will be still present : remove it to get all edition then.
seed with me asap mates and help the other peers as well...
Ty for understanding
best regards
