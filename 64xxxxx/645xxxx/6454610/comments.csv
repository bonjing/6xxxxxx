,kalas-claes,2011-06-09T14:34Z,"Thanks again EzDL.. like many point out: this is the only way I can watch this!

@serenx

This show has 45 min runtime.. you do the math (i.e. 350mb is not possible unless loss is wanted)"
,longjohnshane,2011-06-09T14:52Z,"I wanna go back to FLV :P heaps smaller and still good quality! its only a tv show not a 7.1 blueray on a 55"" tv or anything.. haha nah I dont care. VLC plays all anyways thanks again!!!"
,selbyftw,2011-06-09T15:54Z,"Yeah I wish it was flv aswell! It was top class quailty and only 150 mb, thats awsome! Im not complaining mind just 150mb took like 3 mins to download whereas this one takes a while, though I can't moan im getting this for free!
Once again thanks EzDL, Please keep rippin' these your doing an awsome job!"
,Behan93,2011-06-09T17:46Z,"Appreciate the upload, whatever the format."
,somebodyelse222,2011-06-09T23:34Z,"Yay! Great that it's avi, and sorry to the flv lovers - someone was gonna be disappointed! 
Why is this rubbish so fascinating? "
,neeliesu,2011-06-11T08:46Z,"Thanks for doing this .EzDL, we're Geordies living abroad and want to make sure you all know that these are NOT typical Geordies, in fact they're not all Geordies!! 
I couldn't watch on my DIVX got a message 'Video codec not supported' so only had sound. Not to worry I watched on my PC.
Thanks again, even though watching these wannabes is sometimes cringeworthy, it's lovely seeing my hometown... Newcastle :)"
,.EzDL,2011-06-11T23:14Z,"@neeliesu No problem, i had the same problem while i was on holiday in cyprus last year, wanted to watch Peter andre the next chapter, but the DL speed was horrific out there and no one was uploading.

Don't worry guy's i will continue to upload the rest of the series and hopefully many more to come :)"
,neeliesu,2011-06-13T04:46Z,Thank you .EzDl :)
,liaash,2011-06-15T15:12Z,Could you upload episode 4 please??
,.EzDL,2011-06-15T19:51Z,ep 4 is now uploaded.
,shumi-thep,2011-06-19T13:32Z,"Dear .EzDL, I have the South African A340 DVD and divx file, but I don't know how to upload it here (I don't know how to create a torrent). I am receptive to have lessons to do that.

In the meanwhile, would you please seed the ""Cyprus Airways"" video? It hasn't seeds for a long time. If you want you can contact me directly to my e-mail fcord_44@hotmail.com. Thanks. "
,Chestercopperpot5,2011-06-19T21:59Z,"I'm in the states so this is impossible to watch.  Really surprised a ""scene"" group hasn't been ripping these but that makes your contributions that much more appreciated.  Thanks!!"
