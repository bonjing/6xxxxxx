[B]New in 0.92 release:[/B]
  -Complete reanalysis in design decisions lead to scripts being rebuilt; they are now flawless.  
  -Basically some features weren't working because of certain snipets of the script; completely fixed.
  -One example is (dial-up, vpn and broadban/DSL) login either wasn't working properly or at all; fixed. 
  -I researched all removed Components/Services, and maticulously examined the effects of their removal
  -Added instructions for VmWare; people didn't know how to properly install it on VmWare Player.
  -Changed Service Descriptions to be more helpful.
  -Added features folder on Desktop to re-enable underutilized features in XP  
   Of course, there is also add/remove windows components that can disable or unlock certain XP features
  -Added "OptimizeXP.bat" to Desktop to maximize speed and reduce memory footprint; 7 questions away. 
  -Removed Unused Services with Nlite, setuperr.log remains 0 KB :) 
   Other services are removed via startup.bat (automatic) and finally the rest are removed with OptimizeXP.bat (must run script).
  -Added another AIO installer, but for Apps suggested by a user
  -For Windows Updates, it will work if you install KB905474.  But since that is also a backdoor, you might opt for Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser 2.2 
   which DOES NOT require KB905474.

[B]Summary:[/B]

There are a lot of crap MicroXP out there, and this isn't one of them.
No need to activate. (VMware has special install instructions)
Most significant speed enhancement are built-in, except OptimizeXP.bat   
Feature-wise, this copy has almost all the features of original XP Pro.
Automatic Windows Update works as explained. 
App Compatibility now exceeds retail copy.
Why install this copy instead of retail? No need to activate, malware-free, much faster, more secure and requires less ram than retail copy.  
Can I use this copy to fix my friend's computer?  Yes, this is a high quality release.

[B]Instructions:[/B]

Make sure you "Force Recheck" the torrent once it is stopped.
Burn on any media with imgburn WITH the verify option checked. 
Install is automatic, just configure your bios, choose where to install and everything else will be done for you.

[B]VMware Instructions:[/B]

Micro XP Pro 0.92 is incompatible with "easy install" from Vmware.
When creating, a new virtual machine YOU MUST SELECT "I will install the operating system later".
Then start the virtual machine, click on "Virtual Machine", "Removable Device", "CD/DVD, "settings". 
Select use iso.  Browse to image file, press ok, and restart the virtual machine.
This time, you will avoid having to put in a serial number, and you will also avoid Error Code: 0x80070002 upon first XP startup.
You see - easy install bypasses one of my important manual install procedures, that's why you get that error.
