         Engineering in space represents the future of human           
         civilization, but also poses some of our greatest technical   
         difficulties. We'l travel to NASA's tool lab and see the      
         equipment we need to build in this challenging environment,   
         from high tech wrenches and hammers to the ultimate robotic   
          handyman, Robonaut.
