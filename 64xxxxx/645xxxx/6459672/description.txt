Storyline:

Antonio is a jolly and precise guy working for an auto factory in northern Italy. He decides to take his wife and two daughters 
on vacation to Sicily, so that they can finally see his hometown and meet his family. He's excited to show them around and dispel 
many of their negative stereotypes about Sicilians. He even dispels stereotypes about the mafia, saying that being a mafioso as a 
teen amounted to just being a messenger boy. But as Antonio reconnects with his past in Sicily, 
he finds out that there are more sides to being a Sicilian than he remembers.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
