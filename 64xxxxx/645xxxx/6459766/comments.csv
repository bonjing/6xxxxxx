Paul & Adjustment Bureau.
Sorry for the delay, I've encoded Paul in 720p instead of 480p, lol
Now re-encoding it in 480p, it'll be sized around 309mb. Adjustment Bureau, too
Hope you all will excuse me, thanks friends :)"

Hey. You were an uploader on whom I was having a lot of hope.
Hangover has been done in
720p by
 Mr. KickASS
Henry[-=KSRR=-]
strausbergq
Ameet6233
and in 480p by
MKVGuy
ILPruny.
So in my opinion, this was a waste."
,Venadan,2011-06-10T16:16Z,"The Adjustment Bureau (2011)
has been done in 720p by YIFY & punk420.
Paul (2011)
has been done in 720p by YIFY and in 352p by twentyforty."
,Venadan,2011-06-10T16:20Z,"Why don't you stop working on the movies that have been uploaded in reasonable size by a lot of uploaders?
Please work on the ones that are waiting to be done.
Don' t waste time on the ones that will be surely done by the others.

,Venadan,2011-06-10T16:24Z,"You are the one who uploaded
Do the Right Thing [1989]
The Vengeance-Trilogy
Tropa de Elite Duology
Enter The Dragon [1973]
A History Of Violence [2005]
Mother [2009]
A Moment to Remember [2004]

The Seventh Seal [1957]
Rescue Dawn [2006]
The Man From Nowhere [2010]

Kramer Vs Kramer [1979]
These all are one of the best movies ever that have been done by less uploaders.
You did all that in reasonable size.
So please don't fail us.
Your hopeful downloaders."
,r-0987,2011-06-10T17:19Z,Thanks! Please do Paul & the adjustment bureau!
,r-0987,2011-06-10T17:20Z, Thanks for this & wall-e!
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-10T17:32Z,"@Venadan
that was a bit rude, ha ha :-)
I agree with you bro. I love these movies. I know they have been done by many others. I just want my contribution to be among those lists of movies, lol
I'll do classics and foreign flicks. hope you understood. I really appreciate the way of u replies, bravo :)"
,snake.eyes1994123,2011-06-10T18:14Z,"+1 THNXXXXXXX
WILL YOU BE DOING THE ADJUSTMENT BEARUE 720p  OR IN  480p ?????????

,SmartGuyTorrents,2011-06-10T18:16Z,Can u please upload all Jackie Chan' movies in small size?
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-10T18:33Z,"I'll try akki. then if everyone are requesting 720p, I may move to all 720p encodes, lol
I don't do it friends, but I do like to up 720p under 500MB :-)"
,Venadan,2011-06-10T19:10Z,"@ StyLishSaLH
I don't mean to be rude.
If I did, then I am feeling sorry about that.
The movie you are uploading is loved by everyone.
I also love this movie.
But the whole point is that
""Isn't it an awful waste of time?""
Everybody is missing the foreign flicks & classics.
Most of the uploaders are doing some dumb shit in 720p.
So you are our hope.
Please don't let us down."
,kuttootta,2011-06-10T19:28Z,"@StyLishSaLH don't forget to upload in 480p also, you are here in this position because of that 480p bro."

[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-06-14T17:12Z,"Maybe I can, but haven't tried yet, lol
I'm getting mixed responses about these. 
I know I got accepted with my 480p. I cant forget it friends. "
,weegeeteeble,2011-06-14T17:21Z,"I was skeptical at first, but this is such amazing quality for a video file thats less than 500mb!

downloaded in 1hr50mins.. 

Cannot wait for a brrip of hangover 2 :) thanks for the great film,

Am seeding.. will do for a few hours.

maybe some of you people should upload comments like these that actually have some useful info in!! rather than asking for stupid amounts of uploads, THE UPLOADERS DO HAVE LIVES!! THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO!! and hundreds of people ask them for requests everyday, so be polite and only ask for one at a time cos then you have a chance of actually getting it :)
No offence intended to anybody offended ;) 
Peace Out & Spread the Love "
