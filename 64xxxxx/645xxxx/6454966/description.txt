Product Description
Now reflecting the new 2008 ACI 318-08 Code and the new International Building Code (IBC-2006), this cutting-edge text has been extensively revised to present  state-of-the-art developments in reinforced concrete. The text analyzes the design of reinforced concrete members through a unique and practical step-by-step trial and adjustment procedure. It is supplemented with flowcharts that guide readers logically through key features and underlying theory. Hundreds of photos of tests to failure of concrete elements help readers visualize this behavior. Ideal for practicing engineers who need to contend with the new revisions of the ACI, IBC, and AASHTO Codes.
From the Publisher
Extensively revised to reflect the new ACI 318 Building Code, this cutting-edge text analyzes the design of reinforced concrete members through a unique and practical step-by-step trial and adjustment procedure. Supplementing text material with flow charts to logically guide students through the learning process, the book decreases the necessity of actual laboratory testing by offering ample photographs of instructional testing of concrete members. This illustrates the failure of various types of structural members as well as demonstrates how the designed member behaves at ultimate load.
