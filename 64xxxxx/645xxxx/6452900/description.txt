Product Description: 
A comprehensive book on shipping derivatives and risk management which covers the theoretical and practical aspects of financial risk in shipping. The book provides a thorough overview of the practice of risk management in shipping with the use of theoretical examples and real-life applications.

This comprehensive book introduces a new, fast-growing area in shipping which has attracted a lot of attention not only from the shipping and transportation industry, but also from the banking, finance, and commodity trading sectors. The authors provide a complete and thorough overview of the practicalities and functioning of this exciting market. 
  
Readers are shown how to analyse and measure the impact of financial risks in shipping investment and operations and how to select and execute effective strategies to minimise or eliminate such risks. In addition, several chapters are devoted to demonstrating how shipping derivatives instruments, both forwards and options, are priced and traded, and how they can be used for risk management and investment purposes. Numerical examples and real-life cases are used to illustrate the ideas and topics and new research findings in the area of shipping derivatives are presented and discussed.
