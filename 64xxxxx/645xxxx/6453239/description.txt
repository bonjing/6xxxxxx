No // Hope album: a collaboration between Sounds of the Outland and 14 vocalists/songwriters

Sounds of the Outland (SOTO) was founded in January 2011, by Ingmar de Vos.

We created an album without having the limitations of distance and time. Nowadays many songwriters and vocalists have their own music workstation, so it is easy to collaborate through the Internet.
Would it have any influence in the creative process? Yes, but most of it positively. Everybody can work in their own time, at moments they have inspiration. There is no limitation in time, studio costs etc.

On every track we worked with another songwriter/vocalist. On many tracks the songwriter is also the vocalist, but there are also tracks where we wrote the song ourselves or another songwriter came in.

Most demos were created at home and then sent to us via the Internet. From that point on we started working on the songs in our very own outland, and the first recordings took place. At the end of this process the vocalists came by in a professional studio where we recorded the final vocals. On all tracks we combined electronics and programmed beats with recorded drums, guitars, keys, horns and strings. 
 
In this project the role of the producer was also (co)-writing the songs and music. This is how, even though every songwriter has his or her own style, we created unity in the album. Every track started with a piano/guitar and vocal demo, and then we started working on the music, instrumentation, arrangements etc. However, the process of writing, arranging and producing was different for every track and songwriter.  

NO // HOPE takes you on a journey through themes of hope and no hope...

We â€˜hopeâ€™ youâ€™ll enjoy this album as much as we do!
