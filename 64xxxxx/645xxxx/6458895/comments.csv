,newskinout,2011-06-10T18:28Z,Yet to start the download but appreciate your effort
,tmaxx666,2011-06-10T19:47Z,"FUCKING BRILLIANT! ! !  My Digital copies were ripped from my own CD's and I have to say, these are absolutely fucking awesome! I am blown away by the difference and the increase in the sonic space.  THANKS!!! "
,simpletech,2011-06-10T19:58Z,Thanks very much indeed for all your work on this!!

Thank you for sharing! I bought the vinyl records back in the 1970's and it is great to finally have the proper sound on CD with the tube amps overloading in all the right places. :)

But ... the CUE sheets for Led Zeppelin II and onwards (except Physical Graffiti) are wrong and EAC refuses to burn. The INDEX 00 values are wrong.

Workaround is to burn without the CUE sheets - and forget about an accurate copy...

A short sample below of the impossible CUE from LZ II:

FILE ""01 - Whole Lotta Love.wav"" WAVE
  TRACK 01 AUDIO
    TITLE ""Whole Lotta Love""
    PERFORMER ""Led Zeppelin""
    PREGAP 00:00:32
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE ""02 - What Is And What Should Never Be.wav"" WAVE
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    TITLE ""What Is And What Should Never Be""
    PERFORMER ""Led Zeppelin""
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
  TRACK 03 AUDIO
    TITLE ""The Lemon Song""
    PERFORMER ""Led Zeppelin""
    INDEX 00 91:23:10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"
,jimclip,2011-06-13T23:57Z,"In response to BOMM2's comment: EAC doesn't have the ability to burn from cue sheets and FLACs unless the FLACs are first converted to WAVs and put in the same folder (google this and you'll see), OR if you change every instance of .WAV in the cue sheet to .FLAC. Granted some of the CUE sheets show some weird pre-gaps, hence the INDEX 00's, but that's just the nature of some CDs, or at least of certain pressings (you often notice evidence of this when playing in a standard CD player and see the counter move backward into some weird negative numbers before going to the next song). But as you said, if you simply burn the FLACs, you'll get a musically accurate CD with the same lengths of silence between tracks as you find on the CD (provided you don;t have your burning program set to add 2 secs between each song)."
,Zerg[P],2011-06-14T12:56Z,"If you want be so precise, it's good turn on in EAC - Defeat audio cache: Yes
btw maximum accurate rips go reach only with plextor mechanics (it's not comercial)."
,snowsf007,2011-06-17T17:36Z,"Absolutely amazing, thanks a lot for this!"
,jimclip,2011-07-01T23:02Z,"BOMM2 is correct; my original CUE files are flawed. I fixed them and also created flac.cue files that you can use to burn a CD with EAC, Burrrn, Nero etc. without having to convert to WAV first. I uploaded the revised files at a filesharing site. TPB won't let me post the URL, so see next comment."
,jimclip,2011-07-01T23:13Z,"Per BOMM2's comment above, I posted Revised corrected CUE files and flac.cue files for my torrent at:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6509457

Full info at the new torrent page and inside the torrent's Read Me. If you don't use CUE files to listen or burn the FLAC files from my original torrent, then you don't need to bother with the revised versions. -jimclip"
,R2d6.51,2011-07-07T14:57Z,"I simply want to give you a big fat hug Bro for making these available, especially for us old timers  who were young & restless in a world made sane by these guys when I bought their first white album & saw them at their 1st US appearance in San Francisco at Fillmore auditorium & followed that tour through southern California to the campus Bball auditorium at UC Irvine then on to the Rose Palace in Pasadena CA where they played with Elvin Bishop, Ike & Tina Turner & Steve Miller Blues Band. I wish I could go back & relive those days when our youth ruled a world of peace & love to you.

The first song I played after DL this discography was dazed & confused & the song did not skip a beat exactly as I remember it being close to their sound.

Many Kudo's my friend. Led Zep forever."
,JohnnyBlaq,2011-08-13T19:10Z,"Many thanx for this download jimclip, appreciate the work you've done. Cracking tunes and exellent quality!"
,JohnnyBlaq,2011-08-25T22:50Z,"I always wanted to experience the Zep but never quite got round to it. I can now say that I'm glad I did. Been having a major Zepfest for the past week or so and I'm loving it! The early stuff especially. Not feeling the later stuff as yet. Great stuff, cheers jimclip!  "
,Kadano,2011-09-21T00:07Z,Great effort. Will seed forever. Thank you so much.
,Billycan,2011-12-29T01:26Z,"Yeah, I'm sorry I just don't get it and I reckon Jimmy Page doesn't get it either. I appreciate that the uploader went to a great deal of trouble to make these masters available but I don't for the life of me know why. I purchased these CDs when they hit the market way back in the 80s and got a lot of pleasure from them but when Mr. Page had the whole lot remastered to state of the art in the 90s, I turned my originals into drink coasters faster than it takes to scratch your nuts. 

Compared to the remasters, these tracks sound like the band is playing underwater and Robert Plant is being smothered with a pillow. Thanks but definitely no thanks."
