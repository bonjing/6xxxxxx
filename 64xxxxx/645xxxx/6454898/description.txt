Ground Vibration Engineering: 
Simplified Analyses with Case Studies and Examples
by Milutin Srbulov
Product Description
Ground vibration consideration is gaining significance with peopleâ€™s decreasing tolerance of vibration, introduction of new environmental legislations, increasing use of equipment sensitive to vibration, ageing of existing buildings and expanding construction sites to/near collapsible/liquefiable/thixotropic soil.
This volume bridges the gap that exists between rather limited provisions of engineering codes/standards and complex numerical analyses/small-scale tests.
The book contains descriptions of ground vibration measurements, predictions and control for engineers. Effects of most frequent sources of ground vibration arising from construction/demolition, traffic and machinery, ground wave amplification and attenuation as well as foundation kinematic and inertial interaction have been considered by simplified analyses aimed at ease and speed of use for major problems in ground vibration engineering. Comments on assumptions, limitations, and factors affecting the results are given. Case studies and examples worldwide are included to illustrate the accuracy and usefulness of simplified methods. A list of references is provided for further consideration, if desired.

Audience: This work is of interest to geotechnical engineers, engineering geologists, earthquake engineers and students.
