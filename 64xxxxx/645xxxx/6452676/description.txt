Product Description:

This unique volume surveys state-of-the-art research on statistical methods in molecular and systems biology, with contributions from leading experts in the field. Each chapter discusses theoretical aspects, applications to biological problems, and possible future developments. Topics and features: presents the use of thermodynamic models to analyze gene regulatory mechanisms; reviews major algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction; discusses developments in the area of oligo arrays; examines the application of models of stochastic processes in nonequilibrium thermodynamics and biological signal transduction; describes phylogenetic footprinting methods for TFBS identification; introduces penalized regression-based methods for constructing genetic interaction or regulatory networks; investigates the specific role played by irreversible Markov processes in modeling cellular biochemical systems; explores the concept of gene modules in a transcriptional regulatory network.
