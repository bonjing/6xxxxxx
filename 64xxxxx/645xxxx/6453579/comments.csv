,aholmes,2011-06-30T18:50Z,"^ It was the video codec that wasn't supported. However, I did try to use mkv2vob to convert the mkv and was partly successful. The film did play, but the audio stuttered as if it had speech impediments"
,t_amante,2011-07-07T19:41Z,"I got the same problem. Video codec not supported. I'll try to convert it to other formats... 
That's a shame, because it's so slow! It took me 4 afternoons to finish it, and it's not supported. Uploaders should put samples on every torrent."
,aholmes,2011-07-11T01:10Z,"@t_amante I don't think it's a problem everyone encounters, seeing as someone else had success with another of r3dcat's 3d films while I got thevid. codec error"
,watfordkid,2011-08-23T07:22Z,"Hi r3dcat.

Huge thanks first and foremost for all the quality 3D torrents!

I'm 100% getting the 3D effect when I hook up my PC base unit to my 50"" LG Plasma 3D TV, but it also shows like a ghost image / shadow of the main image occasionally.

I only bought the 3D TV (first time I've owned one) a few weeks back so sorry if what follows is too in depth / a bit stupid!

The GPU in my PC base unit is an ATI Sapphire Radeon HD 5850 Extreme (CPU is an AMD Phenom II X4 955 (3.20 GHz)).

I checked out....

http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-5000/hd-5850/Pages/ati-radeon-hd-5850-overview.aspx#2

...and it mentions ""3D stereoscopic display/glasses support"" on that page.

I have connected an HDMI lead from one of the 3 slots on the TV to one of the 2 HDMI slots on the GPU.

Cutting thru the above waffle and to the chase though, I was wondering if the ghost image / shadow thing was due to the rather large screen size of the TV?

In other words, can the GPU cope with it and would it not have the ghost image / shadow if it was hooked up to say a 22"" 3D PC Monitor instead?

Sorry for the long winded message, any advice and guidance gratefully received!

Keep up the great work :-)

Cheers!"

,game88,2011-09-03T07:15Z,"not running in TV r3dcat any of your upload except the LG TV DEMO ; not a single file is running in TV ; Showing invalid File with lenght 0.00.00 and a cross icon in the below of the thumbnail

,ethermanous,2011-09-26T06:15Z,"Hey. This might be a stupid doubt but anyway. I wanted to know if this file is 'Hubble 3D' in 3D or is it the movie in normal format but just 1080p. Also, If it is a 3D movie, can I watch it on my normal computer LCD screen with 3D glasses? Please comment. Thanks."
,kuklei,2011-10-04T03:30Z,LG LW5500 does play the file but has no sound. Looks like the LW models dont like the 47.952431 frame rate or there is something with the a52 (aka AC3) encoder that uploader has used. any ideas?

I tried on samsung 3d plasma, I am not able to play this video's too.

a bit research and i find out that the max frame rate for my TV is 8 to 30 fps

Thanks to r3dcat for providing this video. 
he used Frame Rate: 47.952431


How to make it work: ( reduce frame rate to 30 fps)
-------------------

1) download HD convertor software, i used

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6168821/WinX_HD_Video_Converter_4.1

2) after install

i tried different settings, but the one fastest i could find is to convert to avi using divx format

click +Add button to add the file downloaded.

4) choose to hd avi tab

5) leave default settings, change the following

videoquality : 8000 kbps ( to keep small file size)
format: divx
frame rate: 29.97

depending on your system cpu, it will take a hour or two

Now try , should work as for me. Enjoy..."
