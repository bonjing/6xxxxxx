,kadaver123,2011-06-17T16:59Z,"superb quality, the movie sucks."
,Johnny575,2011-06-18T13:27Z,"Weird. Why doesn't VLC show this in correct aspect ratio?
This mkv is 1280x696 (1.85:1), but VLC shows it in 16:9 (1.778:1) so the picture become slightly pressed together, enough to see that the aspect ratio is wrong. And there is no custom aspect ratio option on the mac-version of VLC :S

The earth behind the Universal logo is not a perfect circle and the people appear taller than they actually are."

,anonabyss,2011-06-26T02:00Z,@Johnny575 This is probably because you have your software set to play at 16:9. Otherwise it plays at the file's natural resolution.
,abhikrit,2011-06-27T20:11Z,@verlineshears or whatever... why dont you just fuck off coz we are all really tired of your shit everywhere...motherfucker...whoever is it behind the keyboard posting it.
