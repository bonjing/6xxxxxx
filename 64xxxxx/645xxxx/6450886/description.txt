    This film seems to have gone straight to VHS               
    & from there to theatre in Portugal & then                
    to DVD.  To say the quality is poor, is,               
    well... true.  We cleaned it up a bit. IVTC            
        is not possible.  Source sample included.

    John Tucker is the notoriously feared leader               
    of the Civilian Operated Police State, a               
    ruthless band of bounty hunters formed to              
        restore order in a city overrun with crime.            
        In the name of the law, and armed with an              
        arsenal of weapons, he will stop at nothing            
    to capture each bounty. But when corruption               
    is exposed within the C.O.P.S. organization                
    --instead of upholding the law--John Tucker                
    will be forced to fight it.
