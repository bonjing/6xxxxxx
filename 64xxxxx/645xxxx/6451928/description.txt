American.Chopper:Senior.Vs.Junior.S02E07.Cadillac.Build.Off.Part.2

The highly-anticipated bike build-off for Cadillac Corp started last week. Both the father and son put a lot of work into both of their bikes. Based on the seriousness of both team from the last weekâ€™s episode I can safely conclude that the show is no longer American Chopper: The Series, but rather the American Chopper: Senior VS. Junior. It was a total hardcore bike build-off with lots of muscles and ranting to boot
