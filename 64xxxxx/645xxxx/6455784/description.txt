The Abyssinians:
Satta Massagana, Released 01/01/1993

One of the most deeply spiritual reggae albums, embodying the soul and power of Rastafari. Re-mixed from the original eight-tracks and featuring some of the most beautiful harmonizing to be heard in reggae. Full of classic songs including two of reggae's greatest anthems - "Declaration of Rights" and "Satta Massagana." Also includes rare tracks like "Leggo Beast" and "Reason Time." A true testament to the greatness of one of Jamaican music's finest vocal trios.
