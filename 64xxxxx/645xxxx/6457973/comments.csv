[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-12T06:33Z,"@crunkwitdadrank: If you already have the software installed try the help or go to (www.videohelp.com/tools/BDtoAVCHD)  and follow the link to the authors site. There is no practical guide that I know of, I learned by trial and error."
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-12T06:48Z,"@crunkwitdadrank: If you have more questions try to give me some specifics and maybe a screenshot and post it at bayimg. Good luck, it's always hard to learn when no one is there to show you how it's done. I still can't use MeGUI to compress files and make them into MKV files."
