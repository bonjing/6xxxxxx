This one not only has annoying ads and pop-ups, it causes my browser to lock-up while deciphering this poorly coded crap! "

[V],joshua13,2011-06-09T19:35Z,"just for the most of the porn torrents here are legit as far as no password, no gimmicks to download. most of them do contain url files in the DL that they may get some money out of but you never have to open those, and the pic are what is promised. you do get the scam ones in all the categories"
[V],joshua13,2011-06-09T19:36Z,I should say many contain not most. for example the guys doing met art and many other sets typically do not include anything but the pics and info files
,fullauto,2011-06-13T10:15Z,"I agree use ANOTHER pic hosting site that one sucks.
if a post has ""DipPic"" as its image site i wont even look at the post not matter what is says it is."
