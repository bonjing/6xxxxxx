,Shark_01,2011-06-08T06:11Z,"Xandecs, I have gotten most of these press conferences from you and I thank you for them dearly, but I must warn others than the video quality on this release leaves much to be desired and the audio is SEVERELY out of sync and just gets worse over time watching this.

I myself am about 1/3 into watching this at this moment and will stick with it adjusting the audio delay in VLC as needed instead of spending the time finding and downloading another copy of this conference, but for those of you who have not started a download of this yet, maybe you might want to look for another release (if there is one) if you need clear picture and synced audio.

Again, if you are using VLC (and some other players I'm sure) you can adjust an audio delay to mostly fix the sync, and the video quality while low is passable enough. If your fine with that, download this!"
