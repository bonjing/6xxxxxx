Product Description: 
The emerging outlook on the AIDS crisis is bleak; it seems that Millennium Development Goal 6 cannot be achieved in most developing countries by 2015. While most books look at the HIV/AIDS epidemic from an epidemiological point of view, this work evaluates AIDS and the international financing mechanisms of aid from a public good perspective. In contrast to the standard approach of the academic literature on AIDS, which derives policy recommendations from the demand side, this book explicitly considers the supply side. The study does not only advance the public goods literature, it also provides new insights into the effectiveness of international policies and paves the way for policy recommendations. As it reveals the weaknesses of current anti-HIV policies, a more effective allocation of international assistance is postulated.
