,benus,2011-06-10T18:01Z,"Hi ChattChitto.
You seem to be popular and professional with your uploads, may I ask whether you could try to make available 2 little programs that help to install XP on ramdisk partition. These have not been done yet. Diskless Angel & Little Angel are interesting apps. Please let me know whether it's possible. Thanks in advance, also for your hard work. Cheerio."
