,Master2873,2011-10-19T19:11Z,"Wow. Glad to see someone is thinking about cosole users and Compatibility. But here is my rating for this file.

A:3/10 V:8/10

The Audio is very lackluster for it being a Bluray rip. The audio sounds no better than the cammed TS version back in 2008.

And the video seems pretty good but you can notice that quality isn't top notch, especially for a Bluray rip. I can see it degrading in parts of the movie where there isn't allot of movement or action.

Overall, I had a feeling that with the file size being nearly at 420Mb that qualtiy wasn't going to be grate but acceptable. The video is acceptable for me and I was quite shocked at quality for the size of the file. But audio was not acceptable for even a DvD rip which killed the video for me.

PS. here is a tip when making 360 Compatible video files. When you encode the files in H.264, or X.264, Try not to make the file size any bigger than 3gb. Apprently the 360 won't stream the file."
,heeeeha,2011-12-15T18:17Z,"hey buddy could you please upload [Real steel 2011] and [The three misquoters 2011] please, if they are released on dvd's.. "
,vreyhr676y,2012-06-14T17:12Z,"A:5/10, V:10/10
The sound is: Audio: AAC HEv2 24000Hz mono 39kbps.

I don't know why people rip like that, I don't see why you can't make it 5.1 HEv2 48 Khz 192+ Kbps. The uploader is a mediocre one at best."
,vreyhr676y,2012-06-17T01:58Z,"The text in the movie is not English, is some European language probably."
