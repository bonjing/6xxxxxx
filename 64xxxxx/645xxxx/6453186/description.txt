Summer always reigned in the Fairy Land, with bright colors and merry laughter... but the land had its dark place as well. On its far border lay the castle of the wicked wizard, who loved the cold and the dark. Around his castle reigned winter and eternal night. Now, he has turned the fantasy land into snowy wilderness! Help the young magician in his struggle against the wicked wizard and restore summer to the Fairy Land in Frozen Kingdom!
