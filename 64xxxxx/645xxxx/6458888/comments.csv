,mkvluv,2011-06-17T08:24Z,"aoloffline, what happened, man? you used only upload the best of the best.

this rip is crap! the aspect ratio is completely off! it's stretched from cinemascope to 16:9. what a shame. i deleted it. please nuke this file and look for a better rip. thanks."
,mkvluv,2011-06-19T19:28Z,ignore my last comment please. there was something wrong with my media player that scaled the image. i might be cause by improper mkv encoding but the file aspect ratio is correct when i play on other devices. thanks.
,dasvunderkidd,2011-07-03T19:54Z,HEADS UP EVERYONE WITH COMCAST.  I downloaded this last night and got an email from Comcast this morning saying I tried to illegally download The Eagle.  This torrent is being tracked.  I'd even stay away from TPB for now.

Learn to check if the problems are in your end, before coming here with your guns blazing and saying the file is bad.

@tathurm
Hey idiot, freedom does not include the right to theft, which is what we are all doing."
,noob_toob,2011-07-14T07:41Z,Hey tathurm! How do you check if its on your end? I got a letter from comcast to for downloading Iron Man 2 fro aolonline. It was weird bc He is one of the best uploaders on here. All of the other movies I've downloaded are AWESOME! Any help would be great. Thank You

Before you go calling people 'idiots', which I am surprised you can spell, I suggest you check your info, spastic. 

Usage of piratebay is in fact NOT ILLEGAL anywhere in the United States. If it were, it would be a blocked IP, same as it is in countries where it is illegal.

Perhaps you ought to familiarize yourself with Swedish law and the passage of bills relating to P2P sharing in the USA before passing comments that suggest your mother is also your sister. 

Remember, folks, when we all come here to find a movie we want: it was a@sholes like this who ruined it for everyone else."

He never said anything about TPB being illegal in the US - it is in fact quite legal.  Forks are legal all over the US too.  But if you run around stabbing people with forks, that's not.  See how that works?  Stealing copyrighted material by otherwise legal means is quite illegal in the good ole USA, and probably where you live too."
