      ---------------------------------------------------------------------

	Featuring production by the likes of Kanye West,
	The-Dream, Babyface, Consequence & more.
	4? is scheduled to be released on June 28,
	2011 in the US and June 24 in Australia. Have a good one.

	4 is the fourth solo studio album from BeyoncÃ©.
	The album was recorded over a year between the 
	spring of 2010 and the spring of 2011, while 
	BeyoncÃ© took time away from the spotlight.
	She engaged in what she describes as simple things,
	including listening to every kind of music she truly
	enjoys. The title signifies not only the artistâ€™s fourth
	 solo offering and the day of her birth but it is also a
	personal gift to her fans who took to their social media
	pages urging her to name the album for her special number.
