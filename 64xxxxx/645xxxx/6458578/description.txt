Boston Blackie (Joe Houston) was shot by  bluesman Taildragger in 1993  after a dispute about money that arose out of their performance together at the Chicago Blues Festival. By most accounts Taildragger was acting in self-defence, but was found guilty on a manslaughter charge and went to prison for a couple of years.

Otis Big Smokey Smothers was born in Lexington, Mississippi, and was taught by his aunt to play both harmonica and guitar. Smothers relocated to Chicago in 1946, and his debut stage performance occurred with Johnny Williams and Johnny \"Man\" Young. In the early part of the 1950s, Smothers played alongside his own cousin Lester Davenport, plus Arthur \"Big Boy\" Spires, Earl Hooker, Henry Strong, and Bo Diddley.

In 1956 and 1957, Howlin\' Wolf used Smothers as his rhythm guitarist on several Chess tracks, including \"Who\'s Been Talking,\" \"Tell Me,\" \"Change My Way,\" \"Goin\' Back Home,\" \"The Natchez Burning,\" and \"I Asked For Water.\" Smothers secured a recording contract with Federal Records in August 1960. With Sonny Thompson as his record producer, and Freddie King on lead guitar, Smothers saw the resultant album, Sings the Backporch Blues released in 1962. Another four track session followed, including \"Twist With Me Annie\", a reworked version of \"Work with Me, Annie.\" As a part-time member of Muddy Waters\' backing band, Smothers also cut \"I Got My Eyes on You,\" in 1968.

The 1970s were a lean time for Smothers, but he finally returned to recording in 1986, when Red Beans Records issued his album, Got My Eyes On You. His backing band were billed as The Ice Cream Men, a nod to Smothers working as an ice cream vendor back in the 1950s.

Latterly suffering from heart disease, Smothers died in Chicago at the age of 64, in July 1993
