,Smuggles,2011-08-20T17:24Z,thank you :)
,bettycananddoes,2011-09-04T05:33Z,Not worth downloading. This is the old version. His new book has a black cover and more articles than this.
,mschooler,2011-09-07T08:39Z,"@bettycananddoes : This is the one you are thinking of. This is the only one that has been written, there are no other versions. If you open the book in whatever book reader you use, it may start out in a page other than the black one (with the spider) but if you scroll up, you will see the cover."

Save your time."
