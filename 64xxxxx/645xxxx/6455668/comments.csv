,beatomen2,2011-06-12T13:32Z,"Thanks!

@bradleygarrison: Disable it in your player, it shouldn't be hard-coded..."
,shottymcshot,2011-06-14T14:52Z,"Great quality. Downloaded fairly quickly. Thanks!

@bradleygarrison 
Not sure if what player you are using, but in VLC player you can go to video>subtitle track>disable on the menu at the top."
,Smurf123,2011-06-16T14:36Z,"Wtfh is wrong with the you seeders? 50kB/s +-25 and I have 100/100mbit connection. Any of the others others Paul releases and I get at least 1-2 MB/s. Been here for 12 hours too.

Shame. Shame on you all."
