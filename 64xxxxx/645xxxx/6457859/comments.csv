,majinbuxl,2011-06-12T05:43Z,"@blkvkng79
are you using more than one monitor? try disabling your secondary one. I've had the same problem with a few games in the past and doing this works 99%of the time. Metro 2033 was one of them...."
,streetbum149,2011-06-12T10:28Z,"confirming this works. simple as all hell, and dx 10-11 worked fine for me. on a side note though if anyone know's of a good trainer for this besides the ones from GCW it would be greatly appreciated. it seems the 5000+ salvage options work but if i do inf ammo\anything else it crashes. "

,Derickk,2011-06-12T17:16Z,"@ blkvkng79 have you by any chance figured out or heard what was causing your issue with the dx 9,10,11? just incase that happens to me, and also for who eva is deciding to d/l the ""skidrow"" version dont, whats the point in lying and having others fall for it, its legit but the crack is some bullshit password thing when u try unzip it, so dont waste 7giggs on it not worth the bullshit, anyway cheers"
,L33ch3r1,2011-06-12T17:35Z,"Hi Shroo and TPTB,

I have a problem with setup.bat. It skips files when installing. This leads to the game loading up to the menu screen but with no sound and a new game cannot be launched. I'm on Windows 7 x64 and UAC and my antivirus are deactivated."
,L33ch3r1,2011-06-12T17:39Z,"Hi Shroo and TPTB,

I have a problem with setup.bat When setup.bat is installing it skips installing files and consequently when I try and run the game it gets to the main title screen but there is no sound and a new game won't load."
,L33ch3r1,2011-06-12T18:15Z,"Update:

I unpacked the .zip file with WinRAR instead of 7zip. Unpacking with 7zip unpacks the files properly and the setup.bat works properly installing all the files.

Game then runs fine.

P.s. I also find watching the setup.bat percentage increase intently and begging it to work properly also might help :-)"
,bruno011,2011-06-12T22:30Z,4 week's download??? SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED ;(
,UryanMatthewric,2011-06-13T00:01Z,Cant seem to get it to unzip using winrar or daemon tools any advice?

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6459748/Red_Faction_Armageddon_pc_directplay
 it works dont worry its a copy from the original steam game but i made it no-steam. im uploading with 400kb and in 3 days i will upload with 2 mb. "
,MVoleski,2011-06-13T00:32Z,"Works good, but when i'm done with it how do I delete the game? It installed files in places that I don't think I can find and just put into recycle bin. And red faction doesn't show up in the uninstaller."
,Roboghrunt,2011-06-13T00:35Z,u can still choose but my package is much larger and i know tptb is good and shroo is a vip so it would work fine tho. but i never tried it from him
,UryanMatthewric,2011-06-13T01:27Z,got it to work but major lag. Any advice on how to speed up performance perhaps a patch I can get? turned all quality options down to low or off such as details and textures. Running windows Vista
,ShadoShane,2011-06-13T03:51Z,"Game works fine, well, except with directX9. DirectX9 makes it crash at start, DirectX10/11 works great! Aside from the horrible, horrible lag."
,Thepclova,2011-06-13T04:35Z,"Thank you TPTB.
Game is working fine.
Well done."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-06-13T08:34Z,are the ingame videos reduced quality with this release or are they supposed to look blurry and pixelated? rest of game runs and looks good @ 1920x1080p
,acilius,2011-06-13T14:00Z,I hope it's 3.87gb because they reduced down the video and not because they removed singleplayer elements from the game. TY for the rip!
,jailbird24,2011-06-13T17:26Z,ive downloaded a previous release from shroo and damn if it isnt the best dl i have yet from TPB. keep up the good work.
,Tracaine2,2011-06-13T21:21Z,"Game installs fine. Good quality, works, no viruses etc. Dx11 tries to access the net according to zonealarm, but I denied it cause seriously, dx doesn't need internet access. To the guy asking where it uninstalls, just delete it from wherever you unpacked it to. Mine is in my downloads folder for example. It's real easy. If all else fails, go to properties on your shortcut and check where the target it. That will show you the game location. And thank you TPTB. First download I've gotten from you guys. I'm pleased it works. I'm a believer. /salute."
,tizrmonky,2011-06-14T00:55Z,shroo got the power- ni i i i ice -does wot it says on the tin thanks for thgame installs as easy as wot u say plays great

,coldpea123,2011-06-14T05:52Z,"Huh, I am having trouble with the INFESTATION mode. Whenever I try to run it(whether its single or multi) it crashes. Any help? I really want to play the infestation"
,Dr.DivZ,2011-06-14T09:33Z,Great Rip and a good game. Works perfect on DX11. TPTB and Shroo Zindabad.
,6xSnake6x,2011-06-14T16:34Z,"@coldpea123 it's not you having trouble with it, it doesn't work for anybody. I think the good thing to do is wait for a volition patch and a proper scene release."
,Yenrock7,2011-06-15T08:05Z,Is there no way to play the one uploaded by ssCLOUD? I've waited 4 days to download it. please help.

,zZsaberbladeZz,2011-06-22T01:05Z,"@ trueAustinLove
If I remember correctly, I extracted contents to a folder, then ran TPTB.4.EVER as administrator, nothing happened, then I ran as admin again and it began extracting 0-100%.  Once that was complete there was a  shortcut on my desktop to begin playing, job done."

,chazzon,2011-06-26T09:08Z,"Was a very good rip till about 48% according to in-game progress report. Game crashed, which is cool, just means you try again. Loads back up fine. However the entire world is dark. Like no lights are on.

Can't seem to find a fix for this yet. 

Some mentioned there was a crash at the beginning level, wait till the RF guy finishes talking, then walk in backwards. That's how I got past the crash."
,chazzon,2011-06-26T16:53Z,"Well, I found the fix. Just gotta restart from the beginning. Sucks, but hey, you aint paying for the game. Took me about 1/2 the time. So I was right back there within 2 hours.

Besides that, amazing game, and great Rip. Can't expect much else. Nice work TPTB"

If you compress a game you always get worse performances then the full gmae itself.. retards, oh and yer infestation is cut out coz u didn't put it as an iso...zomg"
,DangerDan43257,2011-07-01T11:31Z,"@Ramb082 compressed versions like this are for people with crappy internet connections, not everybody has fast internet and have time to spend days downloading an iso. and why did you bother downloading it if u were gonna bitch? from its size you can tell its not the iso and from the description you know it is of a lossy quality. +1"
