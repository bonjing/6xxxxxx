,Mr-Rivet-Head,2011-06-09T08:05Z,"@Anfo1,
Im quite aware that only cd2 is the new material,
incase you didnt know in the majority of torrent clients you can CHOOSE what files you wish to download before the download starts in which case for yourself just de-select the first CD,

In terms of links are the public trackers not good enough for you?
The torrent is running along quite nicely and i see no need to modify it for now"
