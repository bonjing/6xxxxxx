,stormvader,2011-06-09T16:10Z,Even though it's a volume edition it still needs to be activated otherwise it only lasts for 30 days!!
,bytor10464,2011-06-09T16:30Z,"Is this a ""trial"" version that only lasts 30 or 180 days, or a full version that can be updated?"
,morrig,2011-06-09T16:38Z, As soon as Office goes online it  automatically gets activated?
,paul450r58,2011-06-09T17:30Z,"seems  to work fine,does not seem to be a trial as i cant see it limited to 30 or 60 days"

,WOLFGANGTHOR,2011-06-09T17:59Z,"So far great upload, 2.4Mb/s

Installation went smoothly
at the end of installation it does say there was an error but i disregarded it and the programs work fine

However when I click File/Help and look the product is NOT activated but since this is a cracked version I do not believe this will be a trial. 

Thanks for the upload! "

,SRoss58,2011-07-03T08:02Z,"I try to install it by opening the setup.exe and i get an error saying - ""Setup cannot find the the required controller file, either there was a network error, an error reading from CD,DVD or other installation media problem or a problem with the media package you downloaded""."
,wilco1000,2011-07-03T09:39Z,Works great. Do the registration on Sundays as you get an auto activation & not a real person
[T],L3G3ND,2011-07-07T15:43Z,"I am sure its working and cracked.

If someone is having problem then you can use this Genuine LifeTime Activator of mine.

,KaramjaHead,2011-08-28T13:25Z,"If u update it does it still work then?

the torrent really works and is awesome good thnx man i got all stuf :)"
,jsallday,2011-10-22T04:09Z,"Thanks PrimE-RulZ.  I downloaded it Sept 17, 2011.  After 30 days it started to pop-up the activation window.  I ignored it and after a few more days it says that Word/Excel trial period has expired.  However, I can still use the apps, it just has an annoying red bar above the tool bar.  I'll probably try one of the activation programs to get rid of the annoyance.  But no issues using the apps after the trial expiration.  Has this happened to anyone else?"
,sa1000watts,2012-03-18T02:01Z,Seems to work great so far!  Great work!
,englishman82,2012-03-23T12:02Z,@L3G3ND  the link to your life time activator isn't taking me anywhere. can you re-check and repost please?
