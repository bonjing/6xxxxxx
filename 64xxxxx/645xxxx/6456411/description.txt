Quote:
This anthology miniseries contains two full length issues each month; each what was originally solicited as a separate 4 issue mini; both stories written by the 'DNA' team of Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning.

The 'headlining' story is the 4-part 'Annihilators' miniseries; a new heavy hitting cosmic team that spins out from the events of "The Thanos Imperative". The team, assembled by Cosmo from Guardians of the Galaxy as the last wish of Star-Lord, includes Cosmo, Silver Surfer, Quasar, Ronan the Accuser, Beta Ray Bill, Gladiator and Ikon the Space Knight. The team's first mission is to deal with the threat of the Dire Wraiths.

The second story/series is "Rocket Raccoon and Groot", a duo adventure of this fan favorite buddy team, also from Guardians of the Galaxy. This series was originally to sport covers by original Rocket Raccoon 1985 miniseries artist Mike Mignola, and it still does, but sadly only as limited variants.
