,daba_1,2011-06-07T17:28Z,"Thanks Bro. This is the concert that I went and saw. The way they named themselves the Blues Mongrels is because you can hear the influence of other genre like swing,jazz etc.. 
My dear friend who I took to the concert is visibly impaired. Carlos was soloing and my friend thought the whole band was still playing. The sound that he can produce from the harmonica is incredible.
He did Amazing Grace and you would swear it was bagpipes playing.
I will be sure to share this with her.
Peace,Love & Blessings "
