[V],twentyforty,2011-06-09T21:59Z,"LOL, I never do ""wrong"". I leave that to others.  You know them, right?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T00:31Z,"@puplone: I felt bad first time around, but as I told you back then, if Edit was functional, I would insert your art without hesitation. Now, it found purpose. Thank you  again."
,moshster,2011-06-10T01:19Z,"Only 2 channel audio.  Plus, there are some hard coded grandstanding messages overlaid on the video, i.e. ""Encoded by ...""  

Waste of bandwidth."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T08:36Z,"@puplone: I always start with some widely accepted/used resolution - and use my own eyes from there. That is only correct way, not obeying some conforming rules, which apparently, might be wrong as much as right.

In asked case, you would learn that most R5 (as PAL have 576 and not 480 pixels as heihght for DVD), that proper resolution for 2.35 AR is 624x288 and not 624x272 or 720x320 and not 720x304) as for NTSC DVD rips. BluRay disks are more uniform than DVD - but - as it seems - they sometimes get things wrong, especially  when actually watching the video What makes thing worse is a need to confirm to x16 or x32 multipliers to get proper behavior of x264/H264 itself."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T08:39Z,"heihght =  height 

Sorry."

""Plus, there are some hard coded grandstanding messages overlaid on the video, i.e. ""Encoded by ..."" ""
Just irritated that this negates the possibility of grandstanding in front of your pets and claiming that YOU are the encoder.  Truth hurts doesn't it?"
,moshster,2011-06-10T10:14Z,"@puplone 
Do you not understand ""hardcoded""? When the text is hardoded, it cannot be edited out of the video.  Yes there are 6 ch versions, but my point was that people will see this smaller file size version and might expect it to be 6 ch since it is a modern movie.  Of course, it would help if the description info was more informative.

@formerly_azrielle
No because I am not a pedller, I just leech but like to have my movies follow scene rules.  it's okay though, now I now twentyforty's torrents are not scene quality."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T10:26Z,"Typical rambling of beginners. NFO (supplied, should be downloaded first) and screen-shots (3 supplied, should be downloaded first) are MORE than information one really needs.

And I am VIP and that counts too, on some different planet, maybe.

Tagging is explained gazillion times: my encodes are not for sale and not for commercial ""watch-online-for-frree"" or Vimeo or Hulu where they ended before I started tagging.

Show respect or piss off."
,moshster,2011-06-10T10:28Z,"@puplone 

Regarding movie resolution sizes, this can vary.  Movies are not always transferred to consumer video format at the esact same aspect ratio as projected in a cinema, so there is not real exact standard other than the limits imposed by different codecs for alignment to pixel multipliers (8 or 16 usually).  Toy Stor 3 for example on Blu-Ray does not fill the complete 1920x1080 HD resolution, it's just short of 1920 because the source frame from Pixar's render is also short of 1920.  it's accurate however, because it is 1:1 pixel match with the original Pixar rendered frame."
,moshster,2011-06-10T10:33Z,"@twentyforty

With respect, on TPB NFO should be included in the description.  And I'm no noob, I'm a professional software architect in the digital media industry.  I've also been scene since the 80s.  Peace."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T10:45Z,"BTW, does ""twentyforty"" belong to ""Scene"". Nope. 

Groups which signed-in to be part of Scene are:
(in alphabetic order) ]

1920, BestHD, CiNEFiLE, CLASSiC, CULTHD, CYBERMEN, DEFiNiTE, HALCYON, HANGOVER, HDEX, HDMI, hV, iKA, Japhson, ORPHEUS, REAVERS, SECTOR7, SEPTiC, SiNNERS, SUNSPOT, TiMELORDS, VOA 
- regarding x264 and they use MKV - and here we have H264/mp4 stated in torrent and file-name.

I mean, how stupid man must be to bitch about his own choice?

Stupid, malevolent, evil or rotten, pick the term you find appropriate."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T11:54Z,"@puplone: Not directed to you - but - have you EVER seen something civilized as:
""Thanks for encoding and upload. However I have problems with playback. Video on MY setup appear with incorrect aspect ratio""  or ""appears blurry"" or ""why sound is not 6ch, I bought 6ch surround system and want to get max out of it"".

I haven't seen something like that from October of 2008. That man become my friend till present days...

In latter ""2 Ch., not 6 Ch"" - I do 6ch, when I found some reason for that. It's piece of  cake, but totally unnecessary in 99.9% of movies

AND

people CAN make their own choice and choose something that suits their needs better, right?

Even if I appreciate your meeker approach, that guy has not deserve it at all. For reasons mentioned."

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-10T17:50Z,"@puplone: ""don't have neither skull; nor upload "" - they have, in general, at least two accounts here, one real one, as uploader, and other one(s) for trashing/attacking other uploaders (why? I have no clue. Maybe are in need of  ""Myyaaoo"", maybe are plain psychopaths). They have learned a lesson, this way, when they get banned and account erased - they still have decent face to show others. And play innocent.  "

,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-29T02:24Z,"This should be standard response from all who support @twentyforty (or something similar) in the spirit of the classic 60s mantra--

 ""What if they gave a war and nobody came?""

Nothing irritates a TROLL more than no direct responses--like he is occasionally annoying fly buzzing around.

From http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/
Definition of: TROLLING

(2) Posting derogatory messages about sensitive subjects on newsgroups and chat rooms to bait users into responding.

and from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)
""Do Not Feed The Trolls"" and its abbreviation ""DNFTT"" 
In Internet slang, a TROLL is someone who posts inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community...with the primary intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or of otherwise disrupting normal on-topic discussion.

[current MyaaaaOOO] is a TROLL, and by inference, so are all the rest of [you all know who]'s ""pets"".
