I can`t find anything online about this album or the artist. Â© 1994, it was released by G.A.S. Records of Moncton, New Brunswick; I can`t find anything online about them, either. The album is number GASRT 12, so it probably wasn`t their only release.


Mostly pop with folk influences, there`s a strong autobiographical sound to several of the songs.


Backing musicians were Clarence Deveau, Cam Bowman, Jack Guppy, and Dave Reimer. Guest musicians were Barney Bentall, Geoffrey Kelly, Vince Ditrich, and Kim Linekin.
