Providing a broad introduction to sociology, the third edition of Sociology: Making sense of sociology lays the foundations for a theoretically and methodologically robust understanding of the subject area. Key topics encourage critical reflection within a wide social, cultural and historical context.
Issues are explored against the backdrop of a UK, European and wider world context to offer students a balanced view in a globalising age. Topical examples from across the world stimulate student interest and apply the analysis.
