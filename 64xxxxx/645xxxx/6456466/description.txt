This is one of the finest pop albums ever made, and some say the best. Some may complain that the 80s was a poor decade for music, but this record destroys those ignorant moans. A record full to the brim of wonderful ideas with an unapologetic singer flitting from heartbreak to sugared-out bitternes to all-out love with such deft lyrical brilliance. He sings surprising melodies flung about almost off-hand around killer hooks, never letting a song get predictable. If you have never listened to this album then you should.
