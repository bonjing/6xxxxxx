,Muffincaek,2011-06-10T00:54Z,"Ok?
Whats wrong sir. whinekid?
You're really not the one to talk based on your fuckin comment."
,Muffincaek,2011-06-14T22:39Z,"Also, since the ""Edit"" button is broken, i'll write it here.

The online part, only works with people playing with this exact copy of them game!

not 100% sure of course, 1 out of 10 we tried with could join and host public and private online games.

Remember, this exact copy of the game!"
,viktorcpp,2011-06-27T09:42Z,"Please provide additional info:
- game patch version
- game language[s]

Thanks"
,Muffincaek,2011-06-29T17:21Z,"Sorry Victorcpp.

Language is English by default, dont know if you will be able to change it.

Version is unknown, please provide it if someone finds it!"
,viktorcpp,2011-06-30T10:55Z,"Thanks for answer Muffincaek :)

I downloaded this distr and have a new question:
in which way I can install these DLC? only copy-paste?
I can't find any DLC-installers

Thanks
"
,iamwaldo69,2011-07-02T17:10Z,"can you please explain to me how to run the game, because it comes with an error code which says, ""_FMOD_Memory_GetStats@8 could not be located in the dynamic link library fmodex.dll,"" any idea where i could get this?"
,viktorcpp,2011-07-04T09:54Z,"OK, tested, all works fine
One of the best torrent ))"
,bcabrcm,2011-07-04T15:35Z,Hey Man Help me install this game please
,Boneblade,2011-07-14T00:10Z,"Does not install correctly. The disc image mounts and installs but does not create any .exe file, plus the readme instructions are in some foreign language."
,Muffincaek,2011-07-22T23:01Z,"Sorry everyone for late answers, but here you go:

Viktor, yes, you unpack the Dlc's one by one and copy paste / overwrite, and be sure to copy paste them in the right order!"
,Muffincaek,2011-07-22T23:03Z,"Bcabrcm: Just install the regular game, then copy paste the content from each Dlc in the right order and overwrite the files over and over, that's it.

Boneblade: The installer should work just fine, and the description is in Swedish, explaining what i wrote in the comment before this."
,12Kings,2011-07-24T08:03Z,For online gaming you can use Gameranger or similar programs (thats what I have done)...
,Muffincaek,2011-07-28T19:49Z,"Nice tip there 12Kings, still works though with this version online."
,GHOST_SOLD13R,2011-08-11T00:14Z,I need some serious help?! I downloaded it then i installed it and now i dont know what to do i tried starting it up but it says i cant because i dont have the binkw32.dll file???
,GSU_fan91,2011-08-11T06:15Z,Same error as GHOST_SOLD13R. Don't really know what to do.
,Muffincaek,2011-08-12T00:32Z,"Sounds really strange, alot of people have gotten this to work, 1 friend got a virus warning, might be something like that fucking up that specific file..

I'm going to superclean this folder to make sure once again it's 100% clean and upload it again, since i just upgraded my internet connection seeding wont be a problem, hope you'll try again later when it's re-uploaded."
,Muffincaek,2011-08-13T01:39Z,"Since Piratebay is fucked up, i cant remove this torrent it seems..
