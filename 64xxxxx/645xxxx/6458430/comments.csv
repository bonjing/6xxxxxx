,caarll,2011-06-22T23:14Z,"I checked this with abgx360 and everything is correct.. BUT everytime i play this game my console freezes and i need to power it off. Dont know if its a bad iso or my 360 that is fucked.. Ive tried to install this to my harddrive but after 19% it says cant read disc.

Can someone else confirm if this is working for them or not?

Anyway.. thanks for the upload webchella!"
