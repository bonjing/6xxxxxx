,minapengar,2011-10-01T18:08Z,"This movie is the shit, real old-school 90's action with great shootouts, you know what I am sayi!n, Johnny Strong is the guy who executes and cut ppl with knives badass style"
,Frankiecees,2012-01-13T14:55Z,Great Quality! As far as lower budget/low end movies go this movie is fucking awesome. For anyone whos into serious action/shoot outs - i'd even say Jason Statham flicks - this movie is for you.

,Manchu64,2012-01-20T04:07Z,"y3n007 ,if you had any idea who trained the shooters in this movie,you might change your tune.Sonny Puzikas,this man is the REAL DEAL,I know because I've trained under him,hollywood can make all the shoot-em up movies they want,but not one has the realism as far as CQB and real world combatives goes as this movie does.This man is a former Spetsnaz operator,just to see the footworkwork and transitions make this worth watching and buying.This guy is still active in the real world doing bad things to bad people"
