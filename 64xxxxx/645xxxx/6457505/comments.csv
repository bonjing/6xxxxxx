To start make sure you have disconnected your comp from net. Pull the internet plug from back of machine is easiest.
Start install.
Copy and Paste the 5 digit product code from notepad and paste. Same with Request code.
Hit NEXT.
Once at activation screen you will see product No. and REQUEST CODE.
Click I have a LICENSE KEY
Open key gen if not done already.
Click MEM PATCH. It will say install success.
Click OK.
COPY and PASTE Request code from ACTIVATION page to the request code box in the KEYGEN.
Now click Generate.
Copy and paste this generated No.into the activation page, Yes it`ll be some digits short. Dont worry.
Click Next. Activated congratulations will spring from your screen and shake you by the Hand.

Hope this Helps. 
Good Luck."
,Kurtrocks1996,2011-07-05T14:21Z,Thanks Venaboli for the help
,mrc1124,2011-07-06T00:42Z,I have downloaded the program and I can get a 30 day trial but the keygen being 7 digits short causes an error.  I have tried all of the helpful hints on here to no avail.  Can somebody please help???  I have a request code of 9NEH P0H5 KXWL EK21 LZ4D E327 WTQY FEPZ and even with the net off I still cant seem to make this work.  Help Please! and TY in advance
,pstreddy,2011-07-08T12:53Z,"Related to Evri1 who has a problem activating the product:
1. Make sure your internet connection is turned off during the entire period of installing and activating ur product.
2. Select ""I already have an activation key from autodesk"" tab during the first screen of activating.
3. Open the xforce keygen and select ""mempatch"" as soon as u enter the next page of activation where u r provided with a request code. The mempatch must display ""successfully patched"".
4. After this, copy the request code provided into the ""authentication code"" box of the keygen. And click generate.
5. Type down the obtained code of the keygen in the activation code boxes of the autodesk window. Dont worry because the code obtained is always 7 digits short. And thats the correct one.
6. Press the ""Activate"" tab and then u r done!!!.
7. Shut down ur system once before reconnecting your internet, to avoid any furthur problems.

Hope this helped everyone who has a problem, otherwise this a perfect torrent... Cheers to ""Prime-RulZ'..$$$"
,azzaman77,2011-07-08T13:01Z,"OK,, since I'm not sure I've done everything properly,, can you be more precise with your instructions :)??
I folowed your instructions all by there:
**********************
To start make sure you have disconnected your comp from net. Pull the internet plug from back of machine is easiest.
Start install.
Copy and Paste the 5 digit product code from notepad and paste. Same with Request code.
Hit NEXT.
**********************
by hitting NEXT my instalation begun and I don't know if I had a chance to use key-gen all by the end of instalation...... 
**********************
Once at activation screen you will see product No. and REQUEST CODE.
Click I have a LICENSE KEY
Open key gen if not done already.
Click MEM PATCH. It will say install success.
**********************
when I click MEM PATCH it says ""You need to apply patch when activation screen appears""

So that's where I'm stuck.......
I've tried to MEM PATCH on all 3 pages of activation process (page with ""Autodesk Privacy Policy"",, and before/after clicking ""I have an activation code from Autodesk"") and still no result..
**********************
Click OK.
COPY and PASTE Request code from ACTIVATION page to the request code box in the KEYGEN.
Now click Generate.
Copy and paste this generated No.into the activation page, Yes it`ll be some digits short. Dont worry.
Click Next. Activated congratulations will spring from your screen and shake you by the Hand.

Hope this Helps.
Good Luck. 
**********************
And of course,, since the MEM patching failed,, neither the generated code could'n work,, so I'm stuck now waiting for your respond (or anyone's) since I don't want to start this 30 day trial........ If I ""start it"" would I still be able to activate it using this generator :)??

Thanks,, and hope to hear from you soon :D :D!!"

I followed the instructions exactly the same as i did to install it on my desktop. It just wouldn't accept the key(s) that I gave. After a few tries it said my license is expired. Any idea how I can delete or reset this license? I've had 3 previous versions of Autocad on my desktop - could this be the problem? I usually migrate my settings after installation. Thanks for any help. Cheers."

,Marv70,2011-09-10T19:36Z,"I installed AutoCAD 2012 on both a 32 bit and a 64 bit computer and here is my experience. The 64 bit took one tenth of the time it took for the 32 bit machine.
1. If the AutoCAD file is on a disc â€“ copy it to a file on your hard disc. It will not install from a disc. With your internet connected, double click on AutoCAD_2012_English_Win_32bit.exe and install it. This may take some time â€“ it took me all of 21 minutes for the file copying part of the installation. Accept the License Agreement and click Next

2. Select ""I already have an activation key from Autodesk"" tab during the first screen of activating. And put in the Serial number: 400 45454545 â€“there will be a small check mark in green next to the numbers and Product key: 001D1 And the same green check mark. Click Next. 
3. Next is Install > Configure Installation. Choose what you want and click Install. This part of the installation took me all of one hour and twenty-six minutes.

4. Deactivate any antivirus autoprotect and firewall until you restart your computer after â€“ the keygen may give a false positive for virus. Open the xforce keygen and select ""mempatch"" as soon as you enter the next page of activation where you are provided with a request code. The page will read â€œPlease Activate Your Productâ€. Remain connected to the internet. The mempatch must display ""successfully patched"". Click on â€œActivateâ€.
5. Click on â€œI have read the Autodesk Privacy Policy, etc.â€ and click on â€œContinueâ€. It will give you a: 
Product: 	AutoCAD 2012
Serial Number: 	400-45454545
Product Key: 	001D1
Request code: 	JNJ0 ARWQ D7C9 3CXH K5CL C256 CD72 FEPZ (this is for example)
Copy the request code provided into the ""authentication code"" box of the keygen. And click generate.
6. Type down the obtained code of the keygen in the activation code boxes of the Autodesk window. Dont worry because the code obtained is always 7 digits short. And that is the correct one. 2K96RV8KKUUZ9QD79AEUT6XJPHJGHVX2R8C8H3QND8YXPGYUUCPPDKEPZ (for example you will generate your own number)
7. Click on ""Activate"" and then you are done!!!.
8. You will see â€œCongratulations, etc. You are done.

My problem then hit when the battery went flat on my laptop as I was making a brew and when I plugged in and rebooted and opened AutoCAD the blooming thing loads as if it has already been activated but no activation screen and the programme closes.

I have tried unistalling and deleting all the files I could find then re-installing but the same thing happens again. When I tried repairing the install,......yep....the same thhing happens.

Could anyone be as good as to shed a little light on how I can sort this.

Thanks in advance"
