Storyline: When two friends get off his car, supposedly to get some money at an ATM, they rob the bank, and Henry is arrested for supposedly participating in it. Rather than give up the names of the real culprits, Henry takes the fall and goes to jail. There, he meets the irrepressible Max, a con man who's grown far too comfortable with the familiarity and security of his â€˜idyllicâ€™ life behind bars, but one who also helps plant an idea in Henryâ€™s mind which will change his life forever: for a man to find his purpose, he must first have a dream. Upon his release one year later, Henry finds his purpose. Having done the time, he decides he may as well do the crime. Discovering a long forgotten bootleggerâ€™s tunnel which runs from the very same bank to a theater across the alleyway, he convinces the reluctant Max to file for his long overdue parole â€” and then recruits his former cellmate to help stage a robbery. Henry becomes actor in the theater's current production of "The Cherry Orchard" by Chekhov, to get access to the tunnel. However, he finds himself slowly falling for the productionâ€™s mercurial leading lady, Julie.[1] One of Henry's "friends" helps clearing the tunnel from mud; he informs the other "friend", who insists in parcipating too. A retiring guard of the bank helps by informing the robbers when there is a lot of money in the vault.
