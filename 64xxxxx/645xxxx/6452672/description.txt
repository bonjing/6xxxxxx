Product Description:

There is no easy answer to the question, â€œWhat is RCA?â€ Some will give a general idea of what Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is designed to accomplish, while others will advocate a specific approach. In this third edition of the best-selling Root Cause Analysis: Improving Performance for Bottom-Line Results, acclaimed experts Robert and Kenneth Latino offer a broad look at the various types of approaches to RCA, comparing their pros and cons while supplying practical tools for implementing or improving current RCA initiatives.

This edition expands the scope of RCA, taking a holistic approach that includes recent perspectives, opportunity analysis, and RCAâ€™s fit with current initiatives such as Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma. In addition to a broader perspective, the book presents updated and expanded material including: a chapter devoted to problem-solving/brainstorming; methodology versus software; using the PROACTÂ® approach complimented by thePROACTÂ® Enterprise Version 3.0 software; discussion of the various conflicting definitions of common terms used in RCA; and a focus on measuring ROI.

Emphasizing the organizational support necessary for successful RCA efforts, Root Cause Analysis: Improving Performance for Bottom-Line Results, Third Edition demystifies the concepts involved in effective RCA and presents hands-on guidance for program enactment.
