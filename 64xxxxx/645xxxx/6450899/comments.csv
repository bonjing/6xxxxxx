,charles221,2011-08-04T07:29Z,"      -Hi, I know the last post needing help is a little old but if anyone has problems getting to the browse part for the keys all you need to do is disconnect from the internet, enter 1111-111111-1111111x then it will say something like error or whatever hit continue and then browse to where you downloaded your keys.
    -Not trying to sound like a douche but you could just read the readme.txt included in all keys I download and follow their instructions, hope I have been of some help cheers :)"

,xXJuggaletteXx,2011-09-10T17:47Z,"The download was fast and just as it says. The only thing im haveing an issue with are the keys. There aren't any listed for 2012, even if i could find it I would't know how to open them to where they could be read."
,charles221,2011-09-10T19:07Z,"Thank you for the upload my man 
this is the third time downloading and installing this file and i have to say it works wonderfully 
for all those looking for a simple ""cracked"" version of kaspersky i don't believe one exists, but all you have to do with this one is disable automatic updates and once a week update it and download a new key pack from TPB
and try to read the ""readme.exe"" files  because they explain the details that you guys seem to missing :D"
,Ivex_Boss,2011-10-13T03:14Z,"Fantastic... Worked fine... funny, i downloaded a trial kaspersky internet security from the official home page and it had errors, but this one is just fine... thankz..."
