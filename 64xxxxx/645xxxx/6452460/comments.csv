Enjoy and please seed."
,dvdgen,2011-06-08T06:52Z,"Fan-tas-tic! Thank you so much for this. Can you explain ""you will get priority if you have uploaded the previous piece"" please? Forgive my ignorance."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-09T19:48Z,"Every time you download a piece of the file, you don't get another one until your bit torrent client sends the signal back that you have uploaded it to someone else. The faster you upload, the faster you get new pieces."
,ekrunch,2011-06-19T18:50Z,"You sir, are the man! Thank you once again for another fantastic upload! If you happen to do DS9 or Enterprise, I'll be happy to help seed. lol"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-19T20:51Z,You're in luck. DS9 will be uploaded later tonight. I've already done TNG but will have a look at Enterprise too.
,ekrunch,2011-06-20T02:28Z,"Thank you! It is appreciated. I'm in the TNG cloud seeding away already. ;)

Thanks again for being a high quality uploader!"
,mostwanted187,2011-06-26T00:34Z,"thanks for this, i been looking for the whole thing!"
,isithot,2011-06-30T21:16Z,"Thanks toilet_sniffer_v, good quality download, will be seeding for a while ;)"
,ScifiNerd,2011-07-05T23:01Z,"Hey! I downloaded it a while ago -brilliant quality, btw- but suddenly the videos have no sound! I just finished watched Season 1 with no problems.... is/was there something up with the torrent?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-06T19:14Z,No sound will be your codecs. There's a link in the download to get free codecs.
,Rick050989,2011-07-26T21:34Z,"0,1 Kb/s download? Hmmm... also letting it upload as always, but no one uploads and I can't download :(. I will wait for a few days and hope the torrent will download at a better speed :)"
,Rick050989,2011-08-04T14:06Z,"Ok statusupdate: Im almost done at 86,6%, however Im still uploading like crazy but the downloadrate is still lower than the uploadrate. It's downloading at a steady 100Kb/s, upload 490Kb/s :P"
,Swelve,2011-08-06T02:07Z,not getting anything faster than 10.2kb/s and i usually dl at about 3000....
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-08-08T14:39Z,"Anyone getting a slow download, check your settings. I've done a guide to setting up utorrent. Click on my name, download the guide and make sure your settings are correct. There are 35 seeds, it should be fast.  "
,R4g3qu17,2011-08-16T15:48Z,"The only thing is that no one on the pirate bay thinks about us poor aussies. Unfortunately, we get charged for uploads at the same rate as downloads (it actually comes off out usage caps).

I'm not trying to be a whinger, I'm just saying that it sucks when you have only 16 gig a month to play with and you get charged for uploads. I'd love to upload, I really would, but I simply can't."
,E-Noid,2011-08-22T18:15Z,"   Just an fyi, I was getting really bad download speeds. Average was between 40-50 kb/s using bitcomet. Decided to try Utorrent and the guide that was recommended.. Started getting far worse downloading speeds. Between 20-25 Kb/s, and that was at it's best. So as apposed to waiting 2 years and 4 days for it to download, I'm now going back to Bitcomet. 
  I do appreciate the upload, It was nice to find the whole series. I just can't watch it for 4-6 months...Has to be one of the slowest downloads i' have ever downloaded.
But again, Thank you for the upload. I will enjoy it when it's finished."
,Cosades,2011-08-28T10:42Z,"@R4g3qu17

It's okay, bro. I'll seed your share for you. One love. :P"
,smilisav,2011-10-08T11:10Z,"This is just ""perfect"".
Having 2MBit down and 256kBit up speed on ADSL2+ will be very helpful with this one. Up speed 22kByte will limit my down speed to 22kByte and help make this torrent very ""popular"".
Otherwise everybody will be ""happy"" to already ""watch"" while seeding back.

Or you plan to open here your own ISP with better ratio than 1:8?"
,karlz007,2011-10-09T09:16Z,"How come all the exterior space scenes are all ""jerky""  (watched them on PS3 and burned them on dvd with same problem). Anybody has that problem?"
,polarbearable,2011-12-06T02:16Z,"Please, please seeeeeeeed. My download is trickling away at around 5-10kB/s = 20 weeks. There's selfish people out there with 100% downloaded who refuse to seed."
,Falcon25,2012-01-29T23:41Z,"Finally managed to download this, but the subtitles aren't in English. They are in some other language I don't recognise. "
,Evostars,2012-01-30T01:45Z,"Indeed, looks good, but subtitles are not in english (polish maybe?)"
,DotFrog42,2012-01-30T20:01Z,There aren't any files in this torrent.  What's the deal?  
,Kumcats2,2012-02-11T01:06Z,Thanx. Great torrent! Cheers. Kumcats. 
,Benishdamenish,2012-02-24T09:10Z,"Talk, talk, talk.. What about V: , A: and  M: ..Well,, we all know STV rocks OK tell us about he torrent.. TPB is not a commentary.."
,Benishdamenish,2012-02-24T09:11Z,Thanks Toilet_sniffer_V  ;P
,markusminix,2012-03-31T06:26Z,"Anyone, help me to find the english subtitles pack for this series,,  Download link please...

Thank you"
,Holocowboy,2012-05-12T18:05Z,"Extremely slow torrent, 1 seed for 10 leech. 370 mb per ep blows it up to over 60 gigs, 200 mb wouldve been sufficient. Total waste of resources, imma go with the mkv/mp4 colletion, but thnx neways."
,killerkalamari,2012-06-13T08:17Z,"Video is [XVID]  576x432  24bpp  23.976 fps  858.6 kbps (104.8 kbyte/s)
Audio is 192.0 kbit AC-3 (stereo)

Gave up downloading this, it was just way too slow! I was getting 5-10k down, while my ISP was capping me at 150k up. There are some very selfish leechers in this torrent. Ended at a 2.83:1 ratio, and I'd only completed downloading 2 episodes!"
