,rogue1911,2011-06-21T00:40Z,Can somebody tell me where i can get full blu rays like with blu ray menu i would really appreciate it i have 8.5 gb discs
,A_Bridge_Too_Far,2011-06-29T03:44Z,"BluRay Discs are 25GB for Single Layer,...and 50GB for Double,...You'll be lucky getting BluRay Rips to fit on D9's (8.4GB Discs) without any Chapters,..Menu's,..and STILL won't be FULL HD 1080p.  
If You want Full BluRay Copies w/Chapters,..Menus,..and all that,..You'll have to have a BluRay Burner and some Single layer (25GB) discs at least.  there are those who offer Full Disc Images of BluRay Releases,...But 20-40+ GB is a LOT Of downloading!! for one Movie,..not to mention alot of space taken on Drive.  
I only download the massive MKV Files on EPIC Movies,..and Must Have's.  other then that,...stick w/ the 6-8.?GB BRRips (MKV's) and Burn them to D9 (8.4GB DVD) and use Your DVD-DL Drive to Play,...Install CODEC's to Decode (Shark007 and the like) especialy for DTS Audio on You PC,  Or Players like VLC Media Player for playing MKV's w/DTS,....and Output A&V to HDTV and Home Theater Speakers For a STILL VERY Nice quality Experience.  
I built a HTPC rather than pay a couple hundred on a mid to high end BluRay Player,...I spent a couple Hundred on Parts and it not only plays BlyRay's,..It plays about EVERY Codec known to Man!!!  
Love it,..especialy when Viewing in 1080p on a 120Hz refresh rate 42"" Full HDTV and a 1000watt Home Theater System,....Who needs to go to the Movies???  

Thanks PirateBay!!   lol


Thanks for the U-Load ""ltt99"""
