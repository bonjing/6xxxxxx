,wissamitter,2011-07-11T10:31Z,"The Season 1 ripped ones are at this link:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5977553/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air_Season_1_Complete_(DVD-Rip)_High_Qua

And the other seasons are also on pirate bay, just search for the torrents that have ""High Qua"" in there names."
,wissamitter,2011-08-06T10:51Z,"It's a shame that after the uploader seeded this wonderful big torrent everyone just hit and run... I will upload every season separately (1 - 6) (Yes these same exact ISO images) up on piratebay. This way if you are downloading this big torrent you can simply copy over the files you already downloaded and do a ""recheck"" (Even if they are not completed yet) and continue them with the new torrents. When I upload them I'll post the torrent links here. And for God's sake keep them seeded this time..."

,MarbleHouse15,2012-04-20T01:44Z,"*Facepalm* This is going to take absolutely FOREVER to download. Why can't people be curteous and seed? I'll download and seed it for as long as I possibly can, because I hate to see people be nice enough to upload a huge torrent like this and just have people hit and run."
