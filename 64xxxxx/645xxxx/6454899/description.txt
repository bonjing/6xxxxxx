The first of a new run of Channel 4's science documentary strand, this film tells the story of how the Russians, at the height of the Cold War space race, developed a very remarkable kind of rocket engine.

Not only was the technology different from that used by the Americans, it was actually better.

When half a dozen of these engines were rediscovered 20 years after they were built, they were found - to the amazement of the American rocket design establishment - to be superior in power to anything NASA had come up with in the intervening decades. What's more, they worked.

Now, incredibly, Russian engines are being used to launch American rockets.
