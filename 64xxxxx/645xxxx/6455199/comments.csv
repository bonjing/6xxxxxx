EnjOY with HDvideos..."
,xidio,2011-06-09T22:40Z,Quality looks just like any VHS/DVD version.
,xidio,2011-06-09T22:40Z,Has alot of noise / blocks in them too.
[T],Filmofiel,2011-07-01T21:14Z,"Jurassic Park 2 doens't even open it, prolly a bad rip. I couldn't open it with every software player i have here. The sound on the other two are worthless, as xidio said...it has lotsa weird noises. To be more clearly: i have found better rips than this one."
