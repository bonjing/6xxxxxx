KeSha - "Tease Me" Lyrics

Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)

Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)

Spot lights down
In my hotel lobe
Spit it up
Honey, shake that body
Dance on top
Have a Manta Reedy
Nobody can get enough
(enough, nought, nought)

Push and pull
It's a evening mission
Turn me on like a television
Fire me up with your disc ball vision
Have you ever get enough

People in the sky
People on the ground
Everywhere I go
From Tokyo
To London Town

Boys to the girls
Then the girls to the boys
(C'mon)
24 days a night
Girls to the boys
Then the boys to the girls
(C'mon)
It's been all of my life
If your gonna
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)

Drove me up
As am your show fur
Ride me in
Like I'm Tina Turner
Just one touch
And your done
Your over
But you'll never get enough
(enough)

People in the bedroom
People on the floor
Everywhere I go
From Mexico
To Singapore

Boys to the girls
Then the girls to the boys
(C'mon)
24 days a night
Girls to the boys
Then the boys to the girls
(C'mon)
Don't be wasting my time
If your gonna
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Why you gotta
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)

If you want me
Know how to please me
Go on and turn me out

If you want me
You better tease me
Don't make me show you how

People on computers
People in the park
Everywhere I go
From Ohio
To Sandspur

Boys to the girls
Then the girls to the boys
(C'mon)
24 days a night
Girls to the boys
Then the boys to the girls
(C'mon)
It's been all of my life
Boys to the girls
Then the girls to the boys
(C'mon)
24 days a night
Girls to the boys
Then the boys to the girls
(C'mon)
Don't be wasting my time
If your gonna
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Why you gotta
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
Go ahead and
Tease Me
Tease Me
(Tease Me)
