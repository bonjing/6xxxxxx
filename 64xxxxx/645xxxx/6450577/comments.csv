,Ilpastoredelcampo,2011-06-09T09:57Z,"Chiromaniac, dude...

The fact that your download is not progressing, has nothing to do with seeding. It is your download speed that is hampering you.

I dl'ed this file in less then 15 minutes. Try using the Magnet Link provided by TPB, in combination with Transmission (freeware)."
,Price15,2011-06-09T10:40Z,Does this game crash a lot?
,mihalo,2011-06-09T17:45Z,the game while playing with throwing out pls help me?
,Aypolo,2011-06-09T19:25Z,"""the game while playing with throwing out pls help me?""
when you type a coherent sentence with a subject, verb, and maybe even an adjective, I'll help you.

""Does this game crash a lot?""
I haven't had a single crash. However, be sure to meet the requirements:
Memory: 2 GB [4 GB recommended]
CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo with 1.86 GHz [Intel Core i3 with 3 GHz recommended]
HDD: 2 GB of free space [10 GB recommended]
Video Chipset: NVIDIA GeForce 9400 (256 MB) - No Support for Intel integrated graphic chipset [ATI Radeon HD 4670 (256 MB) recommended]
Online: Ethernet or Wi-Fi"
,x818hovox,2011-06-10T04:28Z,The game starts up then all i hear is music with a black screen. help plz.
,Aypolo,2011-06-10T18:05Z,"x818hovox:
1. What are your computer specs? (graphics card, ram, free hd space, model)
2. Do you not see the beginning intro with the Gameloft logo?
Try waiting a few minutes, your comp is most likely slow + old. "
,Aypolo,2011-06-10T18:10Z,"x818hovox:
 What are your computer specs? 
I'm 99% sure they DON'T fit the required. please check the app page in the description to see the required specs. "

,Aypolo,2011-06-11T18:03Z,"If you see the logo then it's not a problem with your Operating System b/c it's initializing the application and playing the movie (I believe it's an .avi in the app's resources)

First of all, you ram is lacking and I doubt it will run smoothly.
You also didn't include your video card. It's under graphics/display in system profiler. "
