,haze360,2011-06-07T22:16Z,@BLACK SHADOW whats up whit you and the spring update....is there ever dash updates in the games???? whitout being online???? thk to the uploader 
,Elektroskank,2011-06-08T00:42Z,@haze360 There are dash updates on EVERY disc. Dunno which one this contains. Anyone here know how to check the dash version by just looking at the SystemUpdate folder? I'm on jtag so the updates just get deleted.
,black_shadow_1981,2011-06-08T00:43Z,"yes some games DO come with dash updates and im not the one that flashed my 360 so its not as easy as me just reflashing again after update, i dont have the cash to spend on a reflash right now and im trying to hold off untill the new LT comes out and i dont need the spring update stopping all my backups from working what is so hard to understand about that!!!!!.......... geez all i did was ask if the dash update was on the disc "
,Elektroskank,2011-06-08T00:52Z,"Whoa relax man. I understand completely why you're asking. My comment was directed at haze360, hence the ""@haze360"" at the beginning of my post ;) I would check for the update even though it doesn't apply to me, but i don't know how. GL"
,fanfasnight,2011-06-08T00:54Z,No update
,haze360,2011-06-08T01:07Z,NOT diss just wanted some info can your hack guy make a back up key of your drive free???then is no worry for that but new soft is up soon www.c4evaspeaks.com 
,Elektroskank,2011-06-08T01:07Z,"ok... my comment disappeared. Anyway, @black_shadow_1981 I understand completely why you're asking. My comment was directed at haze360, hence the ""@haze360"" at the beginning of my post ;)  I'd be happy to check the dash version in the update if i knew how, but as i always delete the systemupdate folder i can't tell what version it is. Good Luck"
,Elektroskank,2011-06-08T01:08Z,WTF now my comment's back. retarded. Anyway THX Stun
,black_shadow_1981,2011-06-08T01:21Z,"lol im not pissed with you my comment was for haze too!

,asrocker,2011-06-08T13:17Z,"Dont know if Ive burnt this wrong same way ive burned every other game, Img burn 2.4X verified correct layer break and it doesnt work!

Just comes up play DVD and ive got the latest LT+ on."
,asrocker,2011-06-08T13:19Z,"Looks like we are gonna have to wait for LT+ 1.9 because this apparently has it on the disk, which means unless you got JTAG this is not going to work."
,SpitvenoM,2011-06-08T16:05Z,"@Stun
Thanks for the upload i got the game really quick

@asrocker
You are wrong this just booted up perfect for me and i dont have a jtag and i didnt get asked to update."
,muchomacho333,2011-06-08T17:45Z,"I have already preordered this game so I won't be downloading...
Just wanted to say, I'm VERY impressed you got it up this early! Good work!!!!!!"
,asrocker,2011-06-08T18:23Z,"@SpitvenoM

Looks like your right think its me being a dumbass and misflashing recently LA noir didnt work either so im 100% sure it works fine!"

,shleal225,2011-06-09T01:12Z,@asrocker you can still play it  if you didnt update your xbox if you did then you know it flashed your disc drive to new firmware and you have to wait and it doesnt update your xbox ive been playing it all day
,fanfasnight,2011-06-09T01:50Z,"This game sucks, maybe its just me but very bad. I was very dissapointed"
,treetops422,2011-06-09T03:41Z,So I just burn this to a disc then pop it in my xbox 360? I usually only pirate pc games.
,cchki,2011-06-09T07:06Z,"So you can play this game with iextreme 1.6? But you must not updata, when the game ask you to?"
,grekpektis,2011-06-09T09:03Z,"does this come with a .dvd file, if not where can I get one and do i need to use abgx"
,Dan_Dee,2011-06-09T18:42Z,"Thanks for the up Stun. Especially a week before release in OZ!
Works great once run through abgx...
My only problem is...
What a disapointment of a game :-( This may have been a good game 12 years ago when they started making it..."
,littledoo,2011-06-10T12:41Z,"download works perfectly thanks for the upload, as for the game..........i think this is the end for the duke nukem franchise. i was expecting great things but the reality is just a very poorly coded below average first person shooter with some corny novelty jokes and primitive slapstick humor. trust me the novelty wore off very quickly and i found myself playing a game that wouldnt have been out of place on the first xbox. i was expecting loads of tits and funny stuff like any duke nukem fan but this just did not live up too the hype. i truly feel sorry for whoever actually buys the retail version of this game. in comparison to battlefield 3 and moderwarfare 3 crysis 2 etc etc this is on helm-sucking, ass muching, smegma infested piece of shit!!! you have been warned........................................................................................................................................................................................................â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”/Â´ Â¯/)

Pity the XEX is not a verified release (yet)."
,r1982,2011-06-10T16:49Z,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR DUAL LAYERS. Period. This game is so dissapointing. Graphics are extremely outdated, character models move like stick figures, humour wears out fast and the gameplay is plain out boring. 

What a waste of time, energy and my FEKKING Dual Layer. "
,CrippledCorn1234,2011-06-10T18:06Z,How do I make all of the files into an .iso file? I'm pretty new at this.

,PhilanthropyAndAnarchy,2011-06-11T09:26Z,Thanks for the Upload STUN! I Love this game! It's well worth buying IMO. I'm very pleased with it. 
,DJ_SEVEN,2011-06-12T07:17Z,"Crapiest game EVER!, its not even worth the price you pay for the empty disc!

15 years for what, some shit that ooked even better on the N64 hahaha"
,greensmoke1313,2011-06-12T17:07Z,"Thanks for the up, it works great. Too bad the game is complete shit. Its games like these that justify pirating, anyone who paid retail is going to be dissapointed or in denial."

,dzilla91,2011-06-22T20:19Z,"Darn noobs.. okay extract the ISO with 7-zip or winrar... run the IS0 through ABGX 360 at level 3 and make sure it makes a DVD file for you along with fixing the ISO.. then use a program like imgburn to burn the dvd file.. once done you can play, but only on a modded system... no you cant play without modding you dumb noob.. ps. your welcome lol"
