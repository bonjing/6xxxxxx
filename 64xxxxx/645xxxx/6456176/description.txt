I apologize for the number of errors with "The Obvious Identity" Album. Also, FYI, collecting these albums was a huge task, and so some of the preset volumes might not be consistent, especially if you are using off-brand media players.

I hope you strangers get some enjoyment out of this band that I have loved and admired intensely for the past decade. And don't forget to seed and leave comments!
