Del has just seen the film Wall Street and decided the upwardly-mobile lifestyle is for him. The camel-hair coat is out, and in comes a smart new image. Green mackintosh, mobile phone, aluminium briefcase, but the yellow van remains.

Del even wants to buy the flat off the council and sell it for a fast buck.

Rodney, meanwhile, has decided to complete a computing diploma course at the Adult Education Centre. It's there that he meets a beautiful posh sort called Cassandra, who learns his name from the tag Del stitched into his raincoat (for a giggle).

Del and Trig ditch The Nags Head in favour of propping up a wine bar. The rest is comedy gold. Rodney and the boys head to a club, where Rodders amazes the others by dancing with Cassandra.

Del is having stomach pains. It could be his new fast-paced Yuppy lifestyle, or it could the eviction notice demanding three months worth of unpaid rent up front.

The solution presents itself in the shape of Uncle Albert's lady-friend Elsie Partridge, a medium who lives off payments for her amazing predictions.

Del thinks it's a load of mumbo-jumbo, but sets up a seance room in The Nags Head. Albert, worried for Del's health tells Elsie to say his Mum has contacted her asking him to go the doctor.

Rodney's down in the dumps. Despite getting engaged, he thinks he's failed his Diploma in Computer Science, which could cost him a good job at Cassandra's father's company.

On top of that, he can't come up with his share of the dosh for the new flat he and Cassandra plan to buy. His only relief is that the diploma arrives in the post.

Del comes to the rescue, promising to call in all his favours to raise the money Rodney needs.

Trouble is, the Driscoll brothers are calling in their debts, and those who can't pay get bruised.

Managing to buy precious time, Del cons Boycie into paying for some dodgy video recorders and can cover the Trotter's debts. Meanwhile, Uncle Albert has Del sussed, and asks him how much Rodney's diploma cost.

Not all goes to plan in the end, and Del fulfils the duties as a battered and bruised Best Man. After some words of Trotter wisdom, Rodders and Cassie journey to Rimini for their honeymoon.
