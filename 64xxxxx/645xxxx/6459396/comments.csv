but still after installing the game and copying the crack you will have to download -

after that run the game and it will run smoothly.

this thing is applicable to operating system   windows xp , 7 and vista"

Do you realise that being on an administrator account doesnt automatically run your programs as admin?

Run the game executable as administrator. Do this on either the main executable or you can do the same to the shortcut to the said executable.

Here is the reason it doesn't save as a normal user. PERMISSIONS. Running the game this way and expecting it to write to the file it needs to write to is wrong!

Guys it's not hard to figure out ;)"
,Angut2006,2011-06-11T09:59Z,Never seen so bad game in the last Years. The graphics are from the 90's or so. Even Quake 3 has better graphis and better game feeling. ANd why  the game loadingtime is 2 minutes ? For what? For 8 bit Textures in shit designed levels. So it is not worth downloading this. I am disappointed that so many hype made 4 this SHIT. Played 3 levels and now i am going to erase it. If u want to have fun go wwwDOTquakeliveDOTcom. SO another studpid strategy from Gearbox and 2K. Even they didint get Borderlands to work for 2 years. Allways crashes bugs etc. ANd they do not care for the community. Never solves problems. Glad i didnt bought the game and DN4E is even not worth downloading it. I f u dont belive me go youtube and look the graphics. 
,Angut2006,2011-06-11T10:03Z,Ahahaha. GEarbox and 2K. Makeing good looking animated Company LOGOs does not make a good game.

3. Dialog asks me for destination folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Duke Nukem Forever"", I click ""Install""
4. It installs in 1 second, shows dialog: ""Game installed, install directx, copy crack"". It doesnt ask for seed files, and in destination folder there are no files! look at this screen, it shows what happens after setting destination folder and clicking Install:

#GmanAndy"
,Reviewer,2011-06-12T22:35Z,"COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS :

1: Mount or Burn ISO

2: Once mounted, open the ISO using Windows Explorer. Inside you will see 'razor1911_installer' Right Click the installer and 'Run as administrator'.

3: Select your preferred install destination and click 'Install'. It will now ask you to locate the 'Duke Nukem Forever_disk1_0.sid'. Click on the Browse button (the ...) and navigate to the MOUNTED ISO. It should already be pointed there once you click on the browse button. Select the file and continue.

4: It will install for a few minutes, then it will then ask for the 'Duke Kukem Forever_disk1_2.sid'. Once again click the browse button, and it should already be there. Select it and continue the install. It will only take a few seconds and this is normal.

5: Update DirectX if you need to by navigating to \Program Files\Duke Nukem Forever\Redist\Direct X and run the installer.

6: Open the mounted image once again in Windows Explorer and open the 'Razor1911' folder. Inside should be 7 folders (LogitechLCD, Maps, MilesRedist..etc). Highlight ALL 7 FOLDERS and move to \Programs Files\Duke Nukem Forever. Copy and replace all files.

7: To run the game, Right Click 'DukeForever.exe' found in \Program Files\Duke Nukem Forever\System and 'Run as administrator' or else you wont be able to save. 

8: Have Fun !"

,danne_9200,2011-06-14T20:53Z,How to uninstall it after? 
,Jurosem,2011-06-14T21:17Z,"To clear things up for some people, this did work for me, but I had to follow ALL the instructions; not just those given in the torrent description, but those given at the end of the Razor Installation itself. i.e. go to the ""Redist"" folder under the newly installed game folder, and install the programmes there. I had already just done a recent update of Direct X, yet for some reason this game wouldn't work until I the the DX install that is in the aforementioned folder.

And to clarify another thing some people seem to be having difficulty, the ""Crack"" folder mentioned in the install instructions refers to the folder named ""Razor1911"" under the iso file. Copying all of those files  (and folders) will ""crack"" the game. I hope that's clear enough.

That said (as others have mentioned) I can't recommend anyone bother with this game. The events are far too scripted, and the actual action/shooting is simplistic and unsatisfying. I gave up after about an hour of play, which is about how long it took me to install and get the damn game working...

Thanks to Razor for the great torrent though."

,insanegamerx,2011-06-16T04:54Z,"ok all so i finally got it installed and its different as you all may remember. its all SIDS now. ill list what im using in this install

winrar
magic disk

mount the game with your desired virtual drive, but do not install yet.

go to your downloaded dir. and open your file. youll see the rar file for duke nukem forever.

do not open the file. 

right click on it and extract to specific destination.

extract to desktop.

takes about 4 minutes. 

when all done and is on your desktop, install game by going to your virtual mounted drive.

it will ask for Sid 1. hit the ... button and then on your left you'll see where you can choose the desktop location.

hit it!

it will already be looking for sid 1 and will appear on your screen to choose.

you will not see all the other files because it is specifically looking for one file in general.

hit ok and let it do its thing. it will take about 4-5 minutes this time beings you spread the files to be individually installed.

it will ask for sid 2.

hit the ... button again and go to desktop if not already there.

find the designated sid 2 file as it will now only be looking for that.

click on the sid 2 and hit ok.

install will be about 10-20 seconds this time and will come up with a direct x visual c++ thing. dont hit ok until the files are done installing. you can see where it says files right under the install bar. the numbers will be the same after about 1 minute. 

HIT OK!

it will bring you to a window that says duke nukem forever  you want to be in the program file path. c:/program files/dukenukemforever.

NOW!

open a new window to the downloaded file and open the rar now.

go to the razor 1911 file.

open

high light all the files! drag and relese in the installed directory. it will prompt to over rite all files. accept eveything and let all overwrite. after that is done.....

open the system folder, right click on the duke nukem launcher application but right click and open with admin right. 

GAME WORKS BITCHES!!!!!!

cant wait to see who cant foloow this install instruction lol"

People with save game issues, nobody with the cracked game will be able to help retrieve saved chapters, because the save feature probably had to be cut out to get the game to work right.

,zingmars,2011-06-18T08:43Z,"@vrocks94
First of all - your grammar is even worse than a 9-year old's, not to mention that your writing style shows that you're ~8-12 year old, which means that by answering you I'm probably not going to achieve anything, but I'm still going to try.
What is hi-tech graphics? There is no such thing. This game follows its own graphic style, and you can't really compare it to anything.
While I agree that models and textures could be more detailed than this, saying that the graphics aren't on the level with modern games is simply being ignorant.
Also, using review sites as an argument is not a good idea - those sites are biased and whatnot, not to mention that by asking to take look at someones opinion, you're saying - ""My opinion is biased, based on other persons opinion, and I can't back up my claims myself. Why? Because I'm an ignorant bastard"". Also review sites are meant to be reference - to help you to decide either to buy the product  or to skip it and buy something else.
Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised that you were one of the people complaining about Crysis 2 having inferior graphics when compared to the first one. If this is indeed true (which it probably was), then you're the one whose perception of graphics is non-existent, and you'll always be a bitch to companies releasing things, and people reviewing them.
That is all. Have a good day now."

a lot of people have agreed with me over the graphics of this game on the other sites...........

and for ur information at the launch of this game the graphics designer himself confessed that the game lacks graphics and needs to be worked upon but they still launched it......

,Baneli,2011-06-24T23:37Z,"Right I got so pissed of with this install I thought I would come a write a comment and had to sign up to do it so listen up!!

First install game - either by using Deamon tools or by unraring the file and installing that way.

when it askes you for the SID files go to the downloaded Duke Nukem file the you unrared and will be in there... If you are using Deamon tools (or simular software) go to that file and it will be shown

once installed you have to copy everything from the Razor1911 file over to the install which is normally in program files under Duke Nukem forever. IMPORTANT Do not copy the Razo file as a whole.. go in and grab all the files so your coping all them files instead of one large one and copy over... some reason it didnt work for me the other way.

then go back to Pirate bay and download Skidrows crack which is 2.6mb so takes no time at all and. Unrar that and copy it to the system fiolder in the installation file... I had trouble with no sound and this fixed it and the game save problems. Make sure you run as Admin and Lock and Load!!!"

the game runs fine for me, but I want to burn this ISO into disk instead of having it sit on my HDD and waste space.

The ISO is 4.51GB and it says it can't fit onto a DVD that is 4.7GB (I am using Nero). So I tried copying it to my friends USB stick, and it also said the file is too large even though the USB stick was formatted and is an 8GB stick that has had ISOs on it in the past.

I suspected afterwards that it could have been that ntfs thing, but it still doesn't explain why the game won't burn to disk. I will try burning with PowerISO. if that fails, I will extract the ISO and burn it assuming it will still be below 4.7GB
*goes to try it now*
Power ISO didn't work but then again, I can never seem to get it to burn as it always gives me an error, pisses me off.
Extracting the ISO and burning the files didnâ€™t work either, still says it's too large. but I have another idea. I shall take the file 'Duke Nukem Forever_disk1_2' and burn that separately to a second disk since the installation pauses and has the user select the file, so at that moment, the user will then swap disks when prompted for the file to see if that will work.
So the burning onto 2 disks worked, However, when I run the install off the disks, and swap disks when prompted to locate the â€˜'Duke Nukem Forever_disk1_2' the install finishes but the game always crashes during the loading screen.

So, to get it to work I had to make a folder on my desktop and copy the contents of disk 1 and 2 into the folder and run the regular install from my desktop. Once installed and cracked, I deleted the folder I made containing both disks files.
So there you have it. That is what you have to do if you want to burn the game to a disk and install it either later down the road, or onto someone elseâ€™s computer."

I'd recommend skipping the game, although if you played Duke Nukem 3D back in the day as I did, you're better off getting it out of your system by playing it through in a couple of days.
It's not a complete waste - it can be fun. But I finished it with a worse impression than I might have, because level design becomes increasingly poor and frustrating starting at halfway through.

Plus, it's too goofy. Duke 3D was done right, had the quirks in a moderate amount while still characteristic for them. This one was overdone and flopped all over the floor.
Still, fire it up, shoot up some pig cops with the SMG, then toss it."

I poked my head in here just to see any comments (I pre purchased this game because I wanted to own it via steam) Just wanted to add a comment to all the intelligent users having issues.

Will some of you please get off this site (any torrent sites) if you don't know what 

the hell you are doing. Seriously just go buy these games and save the rest of us 

who know what we are doing the hassle of reading your half wit comments about how 

you can't get something to work or that there is a ""virus"". Most torrents contain 

everything needed to run the program (unless otherwise stated) 

1. Get firefox with noscript, adblock, ghostery, betterprivacy.
2. Get peerblock and figure out how it works.
3. Get a firewall program (legitimately pay for it) like Zone Alarm or something 

that allows you to prevent these programs from calling to it's home website further 

making things hard for you to use the software or having it disabled.

This is just basic stuff I'm sure others can add to this incomplete list of ways to 

not have problems with torrented files. The main thing is to use that thing between 

your ears and learn how to have reading comprehension and study skills."

De4dGypsy is right. I had the same problem till I ran the game as an administrator. Its not enough that you are a local administrator over your PC, you have to explicitly run it as an admin each time.

Either right click DukeForever.exe and choose ""Run as Administrator"" or to avoid having to do this each time, right click go to Properties, Compatibility tab, and check the box for ""Run this program as an Admin"" and hit OK. It should remember it from then on. This is all assuming youre on Vista or 7."

,Trevoc,2011-07-25T06:51Z,"As of 20 minutes ago, I succesfully have beaten the game. To do so my steps were
1. Download torrent
2. Mount image
3. Razer installer, during installation it will ask for STP, go to your virtual drive made when mounting the image, and you can find your STP file there. You will be prompted twice.
4. Download the Duke Nukem Forever Razer1911 (Fix) crack, it will solve some bugs ahead of time for you.
5. Replace files from the crack and add them to the game file, but for MilesRedist, add those four files to system, not Redist. 
6. Playing the game fullscreen is slow and framey, drop it down to windowed mode.

I had no sound the first time I tried it, but I moved the MilesRedist files to system and it worked fine. If it still doesnt work for you, add to Redist, Sounds, System. Whatever. I added to them and it worked fine. 

It saved as long as you ran it as Administrator.....or you beat it in one sitting =D

The Actual game was quite what I expected it to be, a couple hours of destruction and snappy one liners. If that's all you want, to be entertained by Duke's voice while killing aliens, it's quite a fun game. If your expecting some final fantasy combat with mass effect dialogue, wrong place. 
In the end, I'm glad I torrented it instead of paying good money for it. A few hours shouldnt be worth 60$.

,The_Cabin,2011-08-26T19:13Z,"Played the game close to the end started it up and exited a few times and my save has been there, then I leave it for a day or 2 decide to go back on it and my save is completly gone. This is the first cracked game thats messed up on me, not sure if its a game problem or a crack problem but I'm pretty dissapointed. and doubt I'll be using razor again..."
,zachosen,2011-08-29T10:37Z,"I've Downloaded and played this game ... Seriously I'm shocked 
I've enjoyed playing the old Duke Nukem over and over without even getting board, this edition sucks! with all apology to the fans of course ... play the game and make a short comparison with the classic Duke and you'll know what I mean "

,Sneevox,2011-09-02T21:31Z,"For all of you people who can't get it to work:

When you download this torrent, use Daemon tools to open it. It will ask for a file, and when it does, go to ""My Computer"", click the Duke Nukem icon, then click the file that the installer asked for. 
Good luck ~"
,row123,2011-09-08T16:20Z,"finally got this freaking thing to work.

,Algae998,2011-09-13T06:55Z,"thanks for the upload.
installation was fairly straight forward.  the game launches and menus work but locks up and creates a crash report every time after i select difficulty and  start the game.
any suggestions?
going to try reinstallation.

running XP 64"
,Algae998,2011-09-13T07:09Z,"how do i uninstall the game?  theres no uninstaller and it doesnt show up in add/remove programs under duke nukem or razor.
just delete it from program files?
anyone?"
,My_name_is_X,2011-09-14T12:22Z,thanks man
,shotgundog89,2011-09-21T02:35Z,"Bad installer. If the game isnt working, you have no sound, etc.. Read everything, you have to copy all the files and folders the installer does not copy for whatever reason. Also no uninstaller. 

Game sucks anyway, spend most of the time waiting for people to give their speeches while you can't do anything.  Little action, lots of boring walking & waiting. Fights are not even interesting, this game is about 8 or 9 years out of date, I was hoping for much better. "

,WalrusBot,2011-12-12T12:31Z,"hey can anywone help me, i downloaded the game and all but when i start instaling, it asks for ''Duke Nukem Forever_disk1_0.sid'' and 'Duke Nukem Forever_disk1_2.sid' but it never asks for the middle one and when it finishes, it says that it was not installed correctly and when i try to run it, it does not open,please i really want this game!!."
,WalrusBot,2011-12-12T13:01Z,"hey i managed to fix that error i was having so everywone thats having it just calm down, all you have to do its install the game, if it says that it didnt worked or if it havent asked for the other part there's no problem, just copy the contents from the Razor1911 folder to the folder where you installed the game and then run it."
,WalrusBot,2011-12-12T13:13Z,"And about the game, it just completely sucks, i prefer playing hello kitty island adventure for 10 years than playing this game for 10 minutes, well ive played a shitload of games, so everywone that should say i never played anything else can shut the fuck up, the game development took 12 years for this completely shitty hopeless mindless unworthy piece of mammoth shit, just think of the first duke nukem game, completely awesome right?(i mean for that time) now think of that duke, being raped by 15 giant alien dicks for 6 years, then smashed into a wall of shit for another six years, and you have the 12 years development of duke nukem forever, the most shitty game of all time, i mean the guy can have only two weapons, the game have the most stupid jokes full of stupid easter eggs and the SINGLE and ONLY funny part is drawing a dick every time somewone asks your autograph, IGN was being IGNorant when they gave a 3.5 for this game, i think they felt sorry for who wasted 60 bucks on it, this junk would deserve 0.5, and dont say i didnt played this game, because i did.(unfortunatly)"
,Duratorg,2011-12-17T22:40Z,Thanks
,moonwalk11,2011-12-20T02:00Z,I already know this game is shit. I just want to see for myself. It probably isn't the kind of game I would pay for. It is more of a test run to see how they made THE DUKE look in this. Kinda curious seeing as this game has been in development for such a long time.

Your a fuckin asshole.

,Topgun999,2012-04-22T05:36Z,"///FOR ANYONE WITH SAVING ISSUES\
The solution is very simple. You need to run the game as administrator (Windows Vista and 7). To do this, right click on the shortcut and select Properties. Under the ""Shortcut"" tab, find the ""Advanced"" button and click it. In the new window that open,s just check off ""Run as administrator."" All saving will now work properly. Due to how many comments are here, please feel free to copy and paste this, as the issue seems to come up quite a bit."
