This is a great gangster genre movie with "character"
It is set around the types that are normally found in New York
with accents that are definitive of the Irish-Italian-Jewish
multicultural mosaic around those parts.

Included are several renditions of the greatest song "Danny Boy" 
featured in the movie


We hope you will find the subtitles template useful for creating
your own subs as we couldnt find an exact subtitle to offer in the
many Euro languages we checked


Thanks for seeding - it costs us a buck a gig for our uploads
right now - based on usage thus far this period. Hope for a better deal soon.
