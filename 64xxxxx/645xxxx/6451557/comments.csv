specs:

video: 960x540 (codec: h264)
audio: aac (48kHz)

please leave a comment so everyone knows if there's a problem (/similar to the other torrents) with the video and PLEASE SEED.

what the fuck are you calling him a cunt for?

If the download link doesn't work then click the magnetic link.
Worked for me, and if it still doesn't work for you, then check your computer cunt."
