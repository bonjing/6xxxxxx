I myself had the hard copy of Nelson Chemistry 11 in school but had to give the book back. I really needed the book again and looked everywhere for an electronic file (only the Nel$on site had it and some other strange websites that I was not willing to download from).

I finally managed to get the CD of the book from school and now I want to seed it into the internet and hopefully you guys will spread it so that it will be available to all and people will not have to go through what I did in oder to get a copy."

,TheyFeedingULies,2011-10-08T06:02Z,"High Titan for some reason when I try to download the file it gives me that error screen.  From the previous comment another TPB member left it appears to be browser related, however I tried with IE as well as Google Chrome and neither worked.  I haven't loaded Firefox, and honestly don't need another browser.  I'm not sure if it is something on my end.  I closed all firewalls as well and it didn't work still... Any idea?"
