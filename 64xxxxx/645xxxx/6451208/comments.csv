,ArdentCustodian,2011-07-21T06:28Z,"Wow. This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen. It is beyond shoestring budget bad. This is no budget filmed on a home camcorder bad. No direction, no acting, no writing. The DVD poster is the best part of this movie.

Even though it's only 3GB, I still regret wasting bandwidth on it. Nothing to see here folks. Go download some Anime instead, any Anime, you can only go up from this garbage."

Sooooo, it's safe to say that you think that all Production Companies that dub Animes and Japanese movies are assholes as well. Buddy, it's people like you leaving comments such as the one that you did that screw people up when they're going to download a movie, as they don't know if it's good or not. How about posting a comment, that is actually useful, such as for how the torrent works, picture quality and sound quality, rather than just bitching for the sake of bitching and being rude."
