Race with the Devil is a 1975 occult thriller and action film starring Peter 
Fonda, Warren Oates, Loretta Swit and Lara Parker. This was the second of three 
films Fonda and Oates would star in together (The Hired Hand was their first and 
92 in the Shade was their third). The film was a hybrid of the horror, action 
and car chase genres.

[edit] PlotRoger Marsh (Peter Fonda) and Frank Stewart (Warren Oates), with 
their wives Kelly and Alice (Lara Parker, Loretta Swit), leave San Antonio in a 
recreational vehicle for vacation in Colorado. They decide to camp en route in a 
desolate area of central Texas, where they witness a Satanic ritual human 
sacrifice. After barely escaping with their lives, they report the incident to 
the local sheriff (R.G. Armstrong), who investigates their report but attempts 
to convince the men that they probably only saw hippies killing an animal. When 
the men refuse to accept the sheriff\\\'s explanation, it becomes clear that he is 
a part of the Satanic cult. The couples agree to leave peacefully, but Roger 
steals a sample of dirt stained with the murder victim\\\'s blood, intent on 
delivering it to the authorities in Amarillo. As the couples head towards 
Amarillo they are pursued by a steadily increasing number of cultists, who are 
networked throughout numerous small Texas towns. Eventually, Roger and Frank 
purchase a shotgun and stage a showdown with the cult members during a high 
speed chase that pits their RV against a convoy of trucks. Frank and Roger kill 
or wound all of the attackers and escape, stopping to celebrate when they pick 
up a radio signal coming from Amarillo. In the middle of their celebration, the 
couples hear chanting outside their RV and find themselves surrounded by cult 
members. The film ends as the cult lights a ring of fire around the vehicle, 
trapping the couples inside.
[edit] ProductionRace with the Devil was filmed on location in San Antonio, 
Castroville, Bandera and Leakey, Texas. Director Jack Starrett later claimed he 
hired actual Satanists to serve as cult-member extras, though he probably stated 
this for publicity purposes.[1][2] Starrett directed the similar B-movie action 
film A Small Town in Texas the following year.[3]
[edit] ReleaseThe film was released theatrically in the United States by 20th 
Century Fox in June 1975.
The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2005. This version 
is currently out of print.
On April 12, 2011 the film was released on DVD through Shout! Factory, packaged 
as a double feature with another Peter Fonda film, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry.
[edit] Remakes announcedA remake was planned in 2005, written by Drew McWeeny 
and Scott Swan, with Chris Moore (of Project Greenlight fame) to serve as 
director.[4] Kevin Smith has said that Race With the Devil is a strong influence 
on his film Red State, which is due to be released in October 2011.[5]
[edit] TriviaThe film was also the basis for the Tamil language film Kazhugu 
(Eagle) which was released in 1981.
