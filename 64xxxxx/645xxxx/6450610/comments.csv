,pwfletcher,2011-06-07T07:00Z,I paid tvick47 4 hours ago ... still no activation and he is not returning my emails.  BEWARE!!!
,pentatonic,2011-06-07T08:30Z,"Give him until tomorrow. I looked him up - his address (or, his parents' address) is posted in the Google checkout receipt. There's a phone number too. Plus google ""tvick47"" and you'll find a long history of iOS related forum postings. Worst-case scenario, if it does turn out to be a scam, we've got info. But I bet he's just inundated with requests right now. Plus, I think it may take a few hours to propagate once he's added us."
