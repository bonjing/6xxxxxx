,DjOutblast1992,2011-06-09T10:53Z,is there a 720p version?
,I-tem,2011-06-09T15:19Z,"This is not a fake and doesn't seem to have any virus. You can safely download it. I am not going to watch it though, because I am waiting for the HD realease. Where are the other uploads anyway? "

,bobbbby,2011-06-09T17:53Z,"No, it works. Started extraction with .00 not .rar"
