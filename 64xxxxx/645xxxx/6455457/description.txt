Product Description: 
Older people are entering nursing homes later and sicker than ever before, thus presenting as more physically fragile and complex residents and requiring more advanced care and treatment. To this end, Hyer and Intrieri have gathered together a group of health care professionals who are genuinely dedicated to the care and research of long-term care (LTC) environments. This group seeks to push the envelope for improved use of professional time, effort, and input and in this remarkable book, share their ideas with you.

By applying the Selective Optimization with Compensation (SOC) model to various care settings, the editors are able to examine current LTC practices and existing psychosocial issues confronting older LTC patients; either support or challenge them; and offer suggestions and strategies, such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy, for improving the LTC system and residents' physical, psychological, emotional, and social health.

This book provides insight on the psychological issues facing long-term care residents for a plethora of health care professionals, including:
Physicians and geriatricians who care for older adults in the LTC system
Nurses and geriatric nurse specialists
Social workers
Activity coordinators
Physical, occupational, and speech therapists within an LTC setting who are seeking ways to explain behavior and empower the residents they care for
Psychologists and psychiatrists whose practice focuses on older adults
