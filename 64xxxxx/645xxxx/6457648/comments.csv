,Echiman,2011-06-09T16:52Z,Is it real?
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-09T17:34Z,"yeah, Echiman, works perfectly here.
i've reorganized gansuk's files and added missing ones, by downloading vids from youtube and converting to .bik
i've tested a thousand times, and use it in my game aswell ^^"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-09T17:37Z,"yes
works perfectly here, i've tested a thousand times, and use it in my game aswell ^^"
,Kangaxxx,2011-06-09T20:53Z,"If you are going to upload a fix, please seed it?!"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-09T21:15Z,"i am seeding u.u but my freaking net is slow as a goddamn turtle, for now, it's all i can offer"
,Kangaxxx,2011-06-11T22:13Z,How come it is about 200 MB smaller than the movies.pack I already have?
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-11T23:48Z,"because it does not include movies1.pack, either that other file i forgot the damn name xD JUST movies2.pack, that was the messed up file."
,Echiman,2011-06-12T11:29Z,"Download it.... test with RAD video tools (all playable)... ingame clans intro are all playable, haven't try the clan victory from ingame yet but i'm sure it work also.

Will help seeding as long as i can

+rep for Luoco_da_feira.
"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-06-12T16:23Z,"thanks for the +rep and the help. Echiman ^^
you and bad boy encouraged me to re- organize the files anyway :P"
,Echiman,2011-06-13T15:43Z,yes.. just replace the movies2.pack with this one.
,telep_man,2011-07-05T11:24Z,"So, if I download the KaOs repack and this I'll have the hole thing, right?"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-07-06T00:43Z,"ya, telep ^^
sorry that i didn't put all the stuff in a single re-pack, i couldnt do it, cuz of my net speed."
,telep_man,2011-07-06T12:38Z,"Alright, thanks. I'll get at least 1:1 ratio, i promise."
,Louco_da_feira,2011-07-08T16:25Z,"WOOOAAA D:
still no Ikko ikki pack for us :S"
,cpt_acid,2011-07-14T23:07Z,"First of all, thanX a lot for the effort...

But, since this is a pretty big file, and there are no seeds could you please upload to some file hosting site?

Or better yet, post instructions on what to do with pack manger and bik player and RAD tools so we can fix the movie2.pack we got :->"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-07-15T05:29Z,"well,iextracted the files from the pack with pack file manager, extracted the files that contained like 2, 3 videos compacted at the same .bik, then, had to download avi files from youtube, victory videos and 2 intros, then converted it to .bik, with the same parameters of the other videos, and repacked with pack file manager, setting it all as ''movie''. ^^, anyways, i'm seeding."
,cpt_acid,2011-07-15T20:22Z,"^^ Got it!
That will be my contingency plan.
But if you (and others) keep seeding, I'll dl the file in a day or two, easy.
I'm in no hurry... Game worx fine without the movies, it's just I like it complete :-)

What puzzles me greatly, is how did it come to the broken movies2.pack being included in the distro in the first place?! That's disturbing...

ThanX for your effort once again, Ldf. "
,Louco_da_feira,2011-07-18T17:10Z,"i wonder 2 things
1- where are the seeders? xD
2- and most important... when will we get the ikko ikki pack? D:"
,cpt_acid,2011-07-28T19:22Z,"Not only Ikko Ikki, but there's another DLC Sengoku Jidai Unit Pack...
Guess there's not much interest among the crackers because of low cost...

I'm seeding."
,Louco_da_feira,2011-07-30T23:16Z,"ya man D: i've been offline for a few days, and no sight of dlc's yet =|
btw, thx for ur help ^^"
,oblaz,2011-08-06T04:52Z,New DLC Sengoku Jidai on ali213 site.
,Louco_da_feira,2011-08-17T15:45Z,"i uploaded it here at pirate bay aswell ^^
btw, thx for the tip, man :D"
,Louco_da_feira,2011-09-03T04:52Z,"you know, it's really good that this torrent is still so ''popular'' :)
still waiting for the icky D:"
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-26T22:02Z,"This file sucks. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

Total War_ Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics

You'll then need another patch because R.G.Mechanics version is bugged. Do another search for:

[FSrv] Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack

Anyone who's played Build 4247 knows how fucked up the game is. The latest patch, Build 4358, and crack are on the thread 35:

Page 35:
patch10.pack build 4358
&
3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"
,Redfren,2011-11-28T02:57Z,Once I finish downloading this I will go ahead and continue to see it with fair speeds. I hope this helps and thanks Louco.
,Redfren,2011-11-28T02:59Z,"Once I finish this download I will continue to seed it with fair speeds, I hope this helps and thanks Louco."
,Bad213Boy,2012-01-07T02:03Z,"Dude, just download Total War Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics:

Take the movies2.pack from there. It's the one everyone needs. This way you don't have to use this bootleg movie file.

You still can only play Build 3444 with out any crashing, but you can use the movies2.pack files from any of the repacks out there."
,Louco_da_feira,2012-01-11T01:25Z,"''dear'' bad boy... this ''bootleg'' file helped a lot of ppl... so.. please.. if you got the original file, UPLOAD it yourself. do us all this favor, aye?
otherwise, you can just fuck off.. you're becoming annoying. so, if you're tired of bitching here already, please upload the file for us.. thanks"
,Zulwarn,2012-02-24T01:02Z,dude u bad213 bastard upload the movie2.pack file dammit.
