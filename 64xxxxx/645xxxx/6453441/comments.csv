,Itbankrock,2011-06-13T06:28Z,Agree with r3dcat
,basker123,2011-06-13T11:55Z,"I HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION!!!!!!!!
1) Click on windows start symbol.
2) On the search window tyrpe regedit (this is for windows 7)
3) Open the registry editor.
4) Click on HKEY_CURRENT USER
5) Click on Software.
6) Click on Xilisoft
7) Click on RegInfo
8) Click on (Default) then enter this code:
1A77-F1B4-A5C5-ECA9-C8AC-B199-CC82-5F00
9)Click on Serial then enter the same code as before:
1A77-F1B4-A5C5-ECA9-C8AC-B199-CC82-5F00
10)Run the software as usual.When you try to convert a sign appears saying the software is unregistered but notice the register button is now grayed out. Click Remind me later and proceed to do your conversion.
11) The program converts your file completely."

,Tekuzumoto,2011-06-14T11:09Z,"@basker123 ur way worked when i tried it at first but now for some reason its only converting first 3 mins, this is just the second time im using it after using ur method. please help me :("
,ampopogi,2011-06-16T09:02Z,"doesn't work.... 

I've tried all your instructions but none of them work..

what a waste of time"
,mcjimick,2011-06-23T01:16Z,"Generally if you have had this installed on your
computer once and it has died - a new install of
Xilisoft will usually make updated versions invalid as well .. .you can try uninstalling anything from
xilisoft on your hard drive and then empty it's traces from the registry >>good luck... first time
users and installs usually work >> disable auto
updates once you have proggie running"
,j.solanki17,2011-06-26T07:12Z,"Not working....
Tried everything !!"
,tha_rapper4eva,2011-07-02T03:50Z,"work fine for me ,,,all serials number work perfct,,,thankz..."
,glennvelasco,2011-07-03T10:07Z,its really works!!thanks..
,scottstrades,2011-07-31T06:16Z,"I agree with mcjimick.  However, after uninstalling the version that is not working, remove ALL references to it in the registry (mine had 4 or 5, which of which were folders, which I also deleted).  This worked for me.  I should mention that I also did a system restore to a point earlier in the day when I knew the program was working correctly.  Then I removed the registry references.

After you get the progam workingr, be sure to uncheck the automatic updates in the preferences area.  If you don't, you may eventually get the 3 mintutes only problem and have to start all over again.  Good luck."
,TheUnbeholden,2011-11-04T14:24Z,"Tried your method of editing the registry, it doesn't work, as soon as you start the program the 'serial' part in the registry gets changed back to 'null'. And changing the serial while the program is running doesn't fix the problem of not being able to fully convert music/videos. Ugh, I've searching ages to get this new version working."
