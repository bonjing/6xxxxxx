,massivetempah,2011-08-18T19:47Z,needs more seeders :( stuck at 0.5%
,malhalla,2011-08-27T22:06Z,"No. It's been seeded average 14 hour a day since launch.
With all the leeching. Not sure how much longer I will bother."
,hippysocks,2011-09-19T19:03Z,I'll keep this on seed as long as i can. I grew up in the ecstasy generation and bonkers made it! I'll seed this until i run out of bandwidth. Reach for the sky! Love you all ;)
,hippysocks,2011-09-19T19:05Z,I forgot to thank Malhalla for the upload. Cheers mate your a star x
,iamralph,2011-12-11T05:54Z,Thank you.   I love the organization.
,iamralph,2011-12-11T19:34Z,"almost to 1:1 already, gotta jump off for some hours but hope to get to 5:1 or 10:1 in a week or two, if everyone does even 2:1 it would be seeded forever :-X"
,Redt0rrent,2011-12-18T11:32Z,"Right, im leaving my computer on forever while downloading / seeding this.

I just started so."
,Redt0rrent,2011-12-18T20:21Z,"Right, thanks now, i have downloaded, and will seed  more than 2:1, i always seed more than double or triple the amount of the original file."
,Redt0rrent,2011-12-18T20:25Z,"Also, why are all the tags messed up?"

,malhalla,2012-01-26T10:46Z,"RedtOrrent: Surely you are mistaken. What you report sound like some of what I have fixed from the other torrents. Your list is void for this torrent, I'm not even bothered to check more than a couple. All the tracks are there and they are named correctly. I have however not touched the tags. Teach your player that filename does just fine."
,blackmarketmusic,2012-05-27T15:30Z,Thanks so much for this. I will seed once downloaded :-)
