Psysive Presents: FS2004: Tropical Sim - Terrance B Lettsome, Beef Island / TUPJ

errance B. Lettsome International Airport (IATA: EIS, ICAO: TUPJ), previously known as Beef Island Airport, is the main airport serving the British Virgin Islands, a British overseas territory in the Caribbean. The airport serves as the gateway to just about all of the islands within the BVI. Many travelers fly into Beef Island, with the intention of taking the ferry to the other smaller British Virgin Islands. The airport is located on Beef Island, a small island off the main island of Tortola, to which it is connected by the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge.
The Terrance B. Lettsome airport underwent a major $55 million renovation in 2004. After dredging was completed the runway was expanded allowing larger planes into the BVI. These planes are not the large jumbo jets one could expect flying into St. Thomas or Puerto Rico. They are merely 64 passenger turbo prop airplanes, used for regional flying only. This renovation was the largest capital project ever at that time.
