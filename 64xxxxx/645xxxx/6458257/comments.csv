,jamaroney,2011-06-11T14:51Z,Correction - the file is called keygen.exe
,jamaroney,2011-06-11T16:02Z,"Further correction. Since the file didn't work in Windows 7 64-bit, I assumed the virus indication was authentic - it wasn't (a common thing with keygen files). The problem is that the Keygen worked only when I ran it under a virtual 32-bit PC. Then all was OK. But why such a hassle with all the extraction - what's the point?"
