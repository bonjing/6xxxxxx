Looking for bulk mailer Atomic Mail Sender if you do requests...
which version are you looking for,mate ?
recent build is hard to get in full version with serial or crack .
tell me more !"
,jersson,2011-06-10T14:24Z,"Oh any vers will do. It doesn't have to be the latest. I had 5.10 working on XP but now I have changed to Windows 7 and it doesn't work any more on W 7.
Thank's for your attention and 1 st mass mailer is a good one to if you cannot find Atomic Mail Sender"
,jersson,2011-06-14T18:43Z,"This vers does not work on XP only on W/7. However, your previous vers 8.0.9.7 works on XP. Does anybody know why ?"
