This work is the real thing - a genuine, divinely inspired, elaboration on the events of the gospel!

For those too busy to read so many wonderful pages about Jesus, His family, friends (and enemies) it can be said: "We played the pipes for you and you wouldn't dance; we sang sad songs and you wouldn't cry." 
Matthew 11:17

Peace be with you always
