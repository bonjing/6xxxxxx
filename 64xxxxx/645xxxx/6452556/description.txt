Economic Freedom and the American Dream explores the effects of economic freedom on America in several areas, such as, markets, politics, and opportunities. By focusing on the economic liberty of individuals, corporations, and markets, and the conflicts among them, the book offers an original perspective on some of the nations most difficult dilemmas. Shaanan challenges the view that unrestricted economic freedom enhances our economic and political well being. He demonstrates that while economic freedom provides benefits, its unchecked version, including the right to profit through government, inflicts a heavy toll on democracy, free markets and, paradoxically, on economic freedom itself.
