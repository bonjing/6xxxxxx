BOOK INFO:

The articles in this volume consider the prevailing standards of feminine decorum, and how these are being played with and challenged by various media. This is a collection of essays which focuses on the representation of women's bodies in historical and contemporary cultures. It discusses recent books on the subject, and compares the two different approaches to the body adopted by the soft-porn magazine "For Women," and the women's monthly "Cosmopolitan." It also examines TV cult figures, such as the "comic body" exemplified by comedienne Joe Brand, and situation comedies such as "Absolutely Fabulous."
