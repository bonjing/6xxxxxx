                Second in the five-part drama. Despite strong
                opposite from his wife Jane, Travers decides to visit
                murder suspect and old university friend Martin
                Newall. As Travers is drawn into Newall's case, he
                finds himself plunged into a conspiracy which
                stretches far beyond the courtroom while fighting off
                the forces that threaten to destroy him once again.
                Meanwhile, ambitious detective Mark Wenborn is
                determined to track down the killer of the murdered
                man discovered on a Suffolk farm. With no sign of
                motive or struggle, Wenborn thinks the case is more
                an execution than a murder.
