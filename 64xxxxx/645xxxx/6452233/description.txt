Five12 Numerology Pro v3.0.2 MAC OSX WORKING

Numerology is a modular music sequencing and audio plugin environment for Mac OS X. It takes the step sequencing and modulation metaphors established by the analog sequencers of the 70's, and implements them in a structured and highly interactive software environment designed for experimentation, improvisation and live performance. By using Numerology in conjunction with your choice of Audio Unit plugins and hardware synths, you can create an open compositional environment that is truly your own.

* â€œGenerateâ€ and â€œEvolveâ€ features use generative algorithms for creating and transforming patterns. You can even use them in real-time for ongoing mutations to patterns.

* Pro-only features: Route multi-output AUs, monophonic audio, custom scale quantization, and advanced sequencer tools like CV to audio for use with outboard analog synths
