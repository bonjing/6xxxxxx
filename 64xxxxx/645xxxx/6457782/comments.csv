You are the idiot Sir, do a bit of research about video containers or mkv. Maybe you will learn not to be so stupid insane. BTW it does look good despite its Size."
,moshster,2011-06-10T10:19Z,"Only 2 ch audio and video it very low quality unless you view it on a 15"" laptop screen.  There are higher bitrate versions for 50"" plasma and projection users."
,justregged,2011-06-10T16:42Z,"The quality of this is fine A/V 10 when viewed on a 32"" lcd tv, anyway most ppl will be familiar with Arnt encode so will know what to expect, but you will get the odd tool who is looking for something to watch on his 50"" plasma with 6channel audio and expects to find it in a 500meg file lmfao what a dope!"
,AmunKa,2011-09-28T01:02Z,"Just so we are clear on the whole Blu-ray question. Those of you bashing ZvAgO because he knows that you can't fit any production Blu-ray into half a GB are what I like to call... wrong.

While the source of this may very well be Blu-ray it has been transcoded as can be plainly seen by the author's provided information.

For anyone that is curious, the size of the Paul BD is 46.1Gb, and extracting the main movie, the lossless English audio, and the English subtitle stream to a Matroska file takes 19.8GB. It only goes up from there if you want additional audio or subtitle streams. Yes Matroska is a nice container format. No it does not reduce the size of the movie itself... no container format compresses video. Only transcoding results in smaller file sizes. The reason why extracting three streams to an MKV file results in < half the size of the BD is because the disc also includes the theatrical release, other audio and subtitle streams, and other video content."
