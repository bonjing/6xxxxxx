,kian89,2011-06-08T09:56Z,"thank you, its been a long time for mr. neeson"
,ukmnaidu,2011-06-08T12:17Z,Dude which encoder u r using 
,dicknova,2011-06-08T16:42Z,"i think, it's handbrake yo.........."
,pinkpetal,2011-06-08T17:33Z,"@dicknova It's not redundancy, it's choice. I happen to choose to d/l HR ups if they are available. But it's because that's MY CHOICE. HR is a deity around here, he puts out great stuff. He's earned his skull, and he doesn't put anyone down who's upped a movie after he has. HR is a class act. Watch and learn youngling. "
,gaaraisgod,2011-06-08T17:36Z,Saw the Feel-Free's encode a couple of days ago. Not as badass as Taken but still good.
,Anti-illuminati,2011-06-09T06:32Z,"Thank you so much for uploading all these movies for us HolyRoses!! Always in good quality and a great choice of movies!
I just noticed that the movie The Adjustment Bureau is out on Dvd, could you upload this one?
Thank you in advance and keep up the good work.
"
,kian89,2011-06-09T09:10Z,"I agree with pinkpetal.. 
this is quality.
me too dnt download any shit that gets available before HR.
for instance , i saw this very movie on some frenh sob's account who thinks everyone is fat who give him -s .
but i didnt download that movie,cuz i dnt wanna waste bandwidth in DLing ing ULing crap ."
,holololo,2011-06-09T12:55Z,"@HolyRoses : some of your iphone converted  movies has optional subtitle(s), how you do that?"
,themorningstar69,2011-06-09T19:43Z,"HR currently uses Encode Handheld 5.7.  It sounds more complicated than handbreak, though obviously yields better results in the right hands."
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-06-10T17:40Z,"Hello : Any chance you could come back and seed this movie from aaaaaaaaaages ago????

I'd be grateful if you could?!?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-10T18:39Z,"will see, might take a while."
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-06-11T08:17Z,"Cheers for going back mate. It's much appreciated. Once I have it (I'm the UK flag in utorrent :) I'll take over the seeding for you.

Thanks again!"
