,ELDREAMBOY13,2011-06-10T11:20Z,IS FOR 3.55 OR WAT
,ROKKERO,2011-06-10T19:36Z,"it clearly says ""This game requires FW3.6+!!!""
why people always ask stupid questions! and dreamboy13, you need to go seed some games! they were posted by you and people are stuck! GO SEED YOU FOOL! "
,ROKKERO,2011-06-10T23:51Z,if anyone know how to get this game working please let us know! i tried but cant get it to work! thanks! 
,danch1,2011-06-14T05:55Z,ROKKERO is right first you have 2 read
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T11:42Z,So what is the point of this when there's no way (an probably never will be) to play backups on 3.60 fw?
,hairyshit,2011-06-19T11:55Z,"Just have to wait like LA Noire or DNF, maybe a fix or a slipup will come out."
,aceman2010,2011-06-20T20:58Z,why arent you people modding the eboot and sfo? if i can do it you should be able to. i'll download and see if i can get it work
,ROKKERO,2011-06-21T23:03Z,ACEMAN2010 any luck? please let us know! thank you
,aceman2010,2011-06-22T00:23Z,lol dont i feel like an @$$. i dont think you can modded the 3.60 fw. for some reason i thought you could. i thought Brink and the new starwars lego were 3.6 and i can play them.
,aceman2010,2011-06-22T00:27Z,Duke Nukem Forever is 3.60 and i played that..fyi is kinda lame. so someone somewhere can get it to work
,ROKKERO,2011-06-22T16:52Z,"oh duke nukem was easy! we had the patch! just like ""hairyshit"" was talking about! 
the Q&A flags are out! thats some good news! ;)  "
,jitsuin,2011-06-27T01:33Z,"so will this work on 3.55cfw

do u need an eboot fix?

im just ?ing why the file is so small, only 4 gigs?!"
,00101010,2011-06-29T21:12Z,"The file is small because the game doesn't contain that much data on consoles. It will likely be larger on PC due to higher resolution textures.

No, there is still no 3.60 CFW and this does not work with 3.55 even with SFO patched.

If anyone gets this to work on 3.55 PLEASE POST EXACTLY HOW YOU DID IT.  Until then, I'll assume there is still no way to do it. :/"
,jitsuin,2011-06-30T03:05Z,"thanks for your reply 00101010

if you want to keep up to date on the hacking scene, ps3-hacks.com is a good way to stay posted. When they get the 3.60 fix it will get blasted on their front page."
,hairyshit,2011-12-26T16:57Z,"there's a fix out for CFW 3.55 by duplex (including dlc), can't seem to post links. just search torrentz for ""alice duplex"""
