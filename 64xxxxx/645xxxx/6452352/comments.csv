,jekrump,2011-06-08T16:40Z,"@dj_Fagboyretard
good lord, do you even listen to yourself when you post? You sound like a retarded sixth grade boy that just learned how to masturbate and thinks he's hot shit. Also, for the record, no sane person still uses Windows Media Player. Get VLC like a normal person, nigger."
,NastyGNU,2011-06-08T22:38Z,"@dj_vietsta: No comment, in fact ignore my post please.
@ all: To watch .mkv files on WMP you need a nice codec pack that recognises the container such as CCCP or K-Lite (I prefer the latter cause of CMP) VLC is always good to have cause it plays everything. For media center or media library and streaming XBMC is a great choice for most platforms on desktop, though might need some getting used to.
PS: I wouldn't recommend using WMP for large video collections cause hours of tag editing could go down the drain..."
,NastyGNU,2011-06-08T22:52Z,One more thought; In order to play .mkv file the system needs to have a proper splitter installed which neither Windows nor WMP comes bundled with unlike vlc which also uses it's own codecs. Thats the reason why you need a codec pack which contains a splitter. For further understanding I recomend reading http://www.matroska.org/technical/whatis/index.html

,pxpierre,2011-06-16T03:43Z,"""So when does the live action version come out???"" - Sooner than later."
,muscle555,2011-06-17T01:55Z,"The live action movies comes out June 14 in New Zealand, June 16 in Hong Kong, Thailand, USA, June 16 in Canada, UK and August 31 in Italy.

You can visit IMDB to find out the details:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133985/ 

The details about Emerald Knights is here:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1683043/

Some reviews seem to indicate that the live action movie acting was not very up beat so the animated movie might turn out to be better.

Either way... enjoy them both...  if they are good, I suggest you try to see them in the theaters so they have money to make some sequels.  "
