,PsychoLogic,2011-06-07T12:32Z,MeGUI with a bunch of custom presets and VirtualDubMod for muxing are my favorites.
,jaded3825,2011-06-07T18:11Z,sweet. hope it works this time. cant wait. THNX!
,jaded3825,2011-06-07T18:22Z,"@ psychologic: r u referring 2 ""office space""? if so, would u pls upload like u u usually do. i m not not sure what u mean by ""Should I up a straight audio file as well"". sorry i m a newb and not really proficient with all the technicalities. thanx again."
,keerochee,2011-06-08T11:15Z,"besides from cloverfield, rock n rolla and lock stock, can you add schindler's list in blu-ray rip XVid 720p file? thanks again. still waiting payback proper to finish download."
,jaded3825,2011-06-11T19:04Z,i have burned it 2 dvd.....a/v quality is good. r u planning on upping district 9 any time in the future?  thx again.
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-15T20:18Z,"Vision's District 9 rip is still on here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5312884/District.9.2009.720p.BRRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON

By straight audio file I meant just the audio in .ac3 format, would have been around 400MB but would require muxing with VDub or AviMux or similar. Really cbf though.

I think Office Space was one of the first ones I uploaded to here... I'll have a look for it."
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-15T20:25Z,"Ohs. You've found and commented on it. Read that wrong. :/
The audio is fsck'd too? That's really annoying, I coulda sworn it was right when I uploaded 'cause I watched it myself first. Just listened to it with pro logic and direct 5.1 input and yeah, it is. Want another one?"
,jaded3825,2011-06-16T19:26Z,"that would b greatly appreciated (""office space""). i have downloaded vision's ""district 9"". from what i remember it had theses unnecessary foreign language chapter marks eg. ""prawn hq"" and there would b foreign language subtitle denoting ""prawn hq"" as well. m i making sense? sorry if i did not articulate that well. btw, do u have ""the jacket"" (adrian brody, kiera knightley)?"
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-18T09:57Z,"Finally found a BluRay source for The Jacket (2005) :) although I don't know how much I trust it since the movie wasn't released to BluRay... at least to my knowledge.

I saw those comments on Vision's District 9. The only version I've watched was a 1.4GB DVDrip which had no hard-coded subs. Not sure yet how to do them, but I'll give it a go, love that movie."
,jaded3825,2011-06-19T06:36Z,"i found a ""district 9"" torrent. r u able 2 use this as a source? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5163765/District_9_2009_1080p_Blu-Ray_DTS_x264-WiKi%28No_Rars%29.  the source that vision used was 720p.BluRay.x264-METiS. did u find ""the jacket"" here?"
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-19T07:23Z,"The Jacket 'BluRay' (I'm assuming it's actually a 720p HDTV rip) I'm pulling from a web source.

Just finished downloading ESiR's District 9 BluRay, as it's a higher bitrate than WiKi's one. Now I need to learn how to hard-code subtitles, and make my own custom file."
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-19T08:28Z,"On second thoughts I won't hard-code them, that will fuck up anyone who wants to watch with a different language sub.  I will make my own .srt for the non-English dialogue though as the ones I found aren't technically valid."
,jaded3825,2011-06-19T17:47Z,"bummer about not hard-coding the prawn parts but i c where u r coming from. nero does not burn .srt. nevertherless, i m grateful that u r working on upping it. thx 4 ur efforts on ""the jacket"" as well. you rock!!! i want 2 nominate u 4 a skull but i dont know how. do u / does anyone know that can help me?"
,PsychoLogic,2011-06-20T07:25Z,"Ahhh true, and I guess the reason I make these rips is so they can be watched on standalone/xbox etc., which won't like separate subtitle files (that and my media PC is too slow to play 720p x264 lol). I'll hard code them and do another release without if anyone complains.

Nawww, a skull :3 No idea how but thx xD"
,jaded3825,2011-06-21T06:34Z,"really??? u r fucking awesome dude! my apologies if u a dudette, lol, seriously...very kind of u to oblige w / the hard-code rip so that i can burn it 2 dvd but unbelievably gracious of u 2 rip another copy if ppl complain. fuck i hope no one complains, lol. many thx!!!"
