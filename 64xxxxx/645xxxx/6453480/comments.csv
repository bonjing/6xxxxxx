,xidio,2011-06-08T08:00Z,And why would anyone buy this when Morrowind Overhaul 2011 is out since a long time ago?
,emgblood,2011-06-08T13:54Z,"@xidio Don't really know of any other graphic mods, this worked for me, so I figured I'd share it. "
,emgblood,2011-06-08T14:08Z,"Also everyone I only have around 130 kB/s upload... So when you download it, seed for a bit to help others get it. As It'll take forever with just me lol. :)"
,emgblood,2011-06-08T20:29Z,"Attention! x64 users, the Installation file I made, is for 32bit Windows, if you are an x64 user, simply:
Copy the files from ""Program Files\ Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\"" to ""Program Files (x86)\Bethesda Softworks\Morrowind\"".

My bad on the fixed path. lol"
,timthenub,2011-09-10T04:16Z,does this have morrowind too?
,NeverPool,2011-10-04T03:22Z,Great pack. Going to seed 200%
