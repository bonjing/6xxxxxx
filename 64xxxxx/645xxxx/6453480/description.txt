Mods to make Morrowind look playable, all in a nice one package install. So no more boring unzipping and dragging countless mod files for an hour before you can even play your game. :)

I also used the GOTY Edition Torrent on here for the install, search "Morrowind" and it should be the top result. 

Also none of this is my work, I just packaged it all neatly for everyone. So all credit goes to the people that made the mods, which you can find details and what mods are install on the website included in the readme file. 

And keep it mind this is an old game, but with this it doesn't look half bad for what it is. 

Either way enjoy it, if it doesn't work out for you, let me know and I'll try to remedy the situation.
