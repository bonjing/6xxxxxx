"A charming, lightweight comedy, "The Actors" goes in one eye and out the other, but provides a pleasant buzz along the way.

The amiable, daft tone is captured by award-winning stand-up comic Dylan Moran, who plays Tom - an actor struggling along as a Nazi stormtrooper in a dodgy Dublin production of "Richard III".

The play's title role falls to Anthony O'Malley, a bitter old thespian convinced he's never received the acclaim he deserves. He's played by Michael Caine, but this is not a documentary.

About to be evicted, deluded with his pitiful career, O'Malley hatches a plan to con a case of cash out of reformed local hood Barreller (Michael Gambon). All Tom has to do is pretend to be a goon hired to debt-collect for a notorious London gangster."




Kind of hard to come by so enjoy!

IÂ´m a big fan of Dylan Moran so this is a given for me :)
