Product Description:

 

With contributions from leading authorities, this timely professional resource critically examines available self-help treatments for weight problems and obesity, binge-eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and body-image disturbances. Practical pointers are offered for guiding clients or patients toward safe, effective approaches that provide the right level of care, from fully independent strategies to treatments with higher levels of professional involvement. Chapters review the strengths and limitations of commercial diets, exercise programs, workbooks, support groups, Internet resources, adaptations of behavioral models, and more, including strategies for long-term maintenance of weight loss. Special topics include night-eating syndrome, childhood obesity, and coping with weight-related discrimination.
