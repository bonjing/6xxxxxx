WinMend Disk Cleaner is a quick and safe junk file cleaner. With a powerful scan engine, it safely and quickly locates junk files in your system.

The scan results will be displayed with subtotals. Its Disk Analyzer module enables you to see the types of files in charts or lists.

Features
1. Safe and Comprehensive Scan Settings
Base on much testing, we decided that the changes to certain folders might affect system security and automatically add these folders to the Exclude Folder list. These folders will be skipped during the scan to avoid any potential risks.
2. Scan Results Confirmation
If you are not sure whether a junk file should be deleted, you can check its content by using the Open File or Properties commands before making the decision.
3. Powerful Disk Analysis
Disk Analyzer can perform comprehensive scan and analysis of local drives and the data in them. It can then present the results in charts or detailed lists for you to have a visual overview of the distribution of files on each drive. The unique junk file classification makes it easy for you to identify and safely delete junk files on local drives.
