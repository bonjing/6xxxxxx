An adopted child raised in New York, Diana Jones always loved country music, later discovering her grandfather was a Tennessee guitar picker. She's since reclaimed her heritage on two albums steeped in old-time atmosphere but boasting fine new songs about characters enduring in hard times. This third volume is her best, featuring a couple of heart-wrenching instant classics in "I Don't Know" and "Drug For This". Her approach can be austere, on occasion even morbid, but there's intimacy in her drawl and resilience in hoedowns such as "Poverty" and cameos such as "Don't Forget Me", about a reformed jailbird. Classy accompaniments, with fiddle and banjo prominent, complete an impressive, rounded album.
