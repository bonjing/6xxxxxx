WELCOME TO THE SECOND â€œGOLDEN AGEâ€ OF SUPERHEROES AND HEROINES Superheroes have come a long way since the â€œMan of Steelâ€ was introduced in 1938. This brilliant new collection features original stories and novellas from some of todayâ€™s most exciting voices in comics, science fiction, and fantasy.
