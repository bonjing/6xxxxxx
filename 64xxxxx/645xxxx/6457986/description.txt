Sinbad: Brain Damaged HBO Special 1990. Most hilarious stand-up special I have ever seen. Clean and family friendly. I searched for over a decade to rediscover this special which has never been released on video. I figured I would seed it so more could discover this. The quality is that of a vhs rip, but okay and the sound may be  a bit off. Totally worth it though. Please seed as this is the only full copy readily available on the internet.
