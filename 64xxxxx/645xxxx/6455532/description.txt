Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: Odd stuff today.  The first hour wasn't even broadcast over the web at the normal time.  Luckily the rebroadcast of hour 1 came through normally.  Well, I say normally, but all three hours had no web broadcast engineer again so I was able to just cut out the long silences.  The net is you hear the raw broadcast, only live commercials and the radio broadcast music.  Enjoy!
