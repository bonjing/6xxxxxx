,rideon4s,2011-06-08T16:20Z,Well if nothing is wrong with it why has the uploader re-released it? in a re-pack?
[V],TvTeam,2011-06-08T16:56Z,"rideon4s, nothing wrong with it. Releaser just broke scene rule little bit but for normal users this release have no issue.

,beefcrink,2011-06-09T06:07Z,nuked means some one broke the rules when they posted it or it had a problem. So it was flagged as having a issue. every one has rules even the scene!
