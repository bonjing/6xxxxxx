,Shahin85,2011-12-11T13:07Z,"I have the impression that Tiesto ""helped"" this project with Allure - since that it is his nickname. Though he wasn't the one who ""made"" the tracks in the album. he simply helped them produce the album - Am I far-off here, or is it correct? Would be appreciated if someone could explain all of this!"
,GeniusAnomaly,2012-03-27T06:43Z,"Tiesto is Allure its an alias of his, like Markus Schulz uses Dakota as an alias."
