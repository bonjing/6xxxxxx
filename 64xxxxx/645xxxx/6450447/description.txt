Love Hina is a romantic comedy manga about a young man named Keitaro Urashima who is trying to get into Tokyo University but inadvertently becomes landlord of a Japanese female dormitory. Throughout his adventures he begins to find friends in unexpected places, and even some whom he considers to be a little more than friends...
