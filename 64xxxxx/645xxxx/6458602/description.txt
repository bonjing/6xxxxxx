Have you noticed that the longer you have your computer, the slower it runs and the more it crashes? Often this is because whenever you install or uninstall software, add or remove hardware, or change your computerâ€™s settings, the Windows registry is updated. These changes can leave the registry fragmented, with obsolete, corrupted and, in some cases, harmful files. Over time the registry starts to get bogged down and conflicts emerge. Left unchecked, your system will become increasingly unstable, run more slowly and crash more frequently.

One mouse click and our registry cleaner does the rest. And using RegistryBooster regularly keeps your PC free from errors and from obsolete, unused or unwanted files. RegistryBooster is trusted by specialist IT technicians and home PC users around the world to solve all their registry based performance problems.
