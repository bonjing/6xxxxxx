Thanks a lot for sharing."
,micmac33,2011-06-10T00:59Z,"Hi again, @Illidan.
I've just checked out your upload Spiderman 2.
Though, the quality is very nice, I wouldn't hesitate  one second to increase the file with 150-200Mo. The runtime is about 30 minutes longer than this one, and you see the loss of quality.
I think it's much more interersting to have a constant quality than a constant file size.
Now, I don't say this to critisize, it's just an opinion for your further uploads that I very much hope to see.
Thanks again for this flawless upload."

,dj-test,2011-06-20T10:06Z,"Picture is great, just the sound is too much compressed, it sounds like a bad 96kbps mp3."
,ViolentC,2011-07-18T08:59Z,"umm, why are the subs hard coded? wrecked the whole film ;/ please don't do that..."
,ViolentC,2011-07-18T09:00Z,"WARNING!
HARD CODED SUB TITLES!!!
WARNING!"
,roachiglesias,2011-11-15T14:32Z,Are the hardcoded subs in english or any other language?/ please reply anyone who have downloaded this movie....
,BinkyDeath,2012-01-15T22:30Z,"I'm confused at the above comments.
I've downloaded this and the subtitles aren't hard-coded, they're optional - they just come on automatically and you have to switch them off.
Also - the audio is terrible! It's got a flapping noise all the way through and the voices sound like they're hiccuping or something. It's also quite tinny, a bit like you'd get out of really cheap and nasty set of mini speakers.
They video/picture quality is ok for the size, but I've seen much better for the same or smaller file size at the same pixel ratio.
I'm confused because what I'm seeing/hearing doesn't match the comments above me. :/
I only updated my version of VLC Media Player yesterday so I don't see how that can be the problem. Plus I've not got this problem with other videos I'm playing.
I don't see how it can only be me that's got a bad copy when other people are giving it a high rating. Very confused - what I'm seeing is a terrible copy, so I don't know if it's just me or if the torrent's been changed or.... what. :/"
