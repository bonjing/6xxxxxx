,namorax2,2011-06-08T00:59Z,"I really doubt TV Team got hacked, this is the new animated dc release, it came out on dvd this week I think."
,countryj,2011-06-08T01:10Z,Is this a FAKE? TvTeam is trustworthy.
,countryj,2011-06-08T01:11Z,I'll let ya'll know when I'm done downloading... I bet its fine.
,JayDomSpacePirate,2011-06-08T01:32Z,I'll try it. if its a fake then someone is a gay fag. if it's REAL someone else is a gay fag with a dick in his mouth. zurgssvvpfd8676 has'nt uploaded ANYTHING but he is gonna declare fakes??? i bet it's real. probably the animated one though. i'll keep that for the kids.  thanks tv team.

,jimbards,2011-06-08T03:31Z,"Ok, couple of comments here to reply on...

1) If you think this is the theatrical release that HASN'T even been released yet, it is NOT.  This is a new cartoon movie that was released today, 6-7-11.  Been waiting for it, myself.  dj_vietsta, the only idiot, faggot, whatever you are talking about here is you.  Look at the file list.  The movie is in ONE .AVI FILE, tard!  People like you that leave comments like you do just PROOVE the gene pool needs a little more chlorine!!!

2)  Namorax2-  Yes, this released this week.  Today, actually.  Good to see it available immediately.  :)  Enjoy.  Just watched GL- First Flight this morning with my son, in preparation for this one.

3)This is NOT a fake... This is a cartoon movie.  People need to start checking dvd release dates to see what is really coming out so they know what they are looking at.  No misleading here.  Do your homework.  I usually use darkhorizons.com to see what is coming out down the road.  Several movies are even available several weeks before the DVD is due out.  Again, all in the effort you put into it, or you can be a fcuk-tard like dj_douchebag...

4)  dj_vietsta, did I say what an idiot you make yourself sound like?  Wikity-wikity-wik!  Scratch that, loser.

TvTeam, great upload, and again, quickness of posting it is MUCH appreciated!!!  Keep up the good work."
,JayDomSpacePirate,2011-06-08T08:04Z,in his mouth. it's good. animation. you rock tv team.
,DeltaPan,2011-06-08T10:49Z,"Will somebody IP ban that inordinately inane and puerile tosser dj_vietsta for slagging off a long time trusted uploader group!!!

Maybe he'll learn some frackin' respect then!!!!

TV Team gave the link in torrent description, here...
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1683043

All anybody needed to do was copy and paste that to address bar and it woiuld have been realised it is indeed the animated version.

TV Team are not responsible for brain dead Pirate Bay users who to them, sensible and rational thought processes are an alien concept!"
,markdbsilva,2011-06-08T12:00Z,Post real. nice quality. tnx TvTeam :)
