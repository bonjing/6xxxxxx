,parkcentral,2011-06-09T13:43Z,Incredible how season 15 so far has failed to produce even a single decent episode. What happened? Did the show's writers take a sabbatical or are they using manatees?
,alan_007,2011-06-09T15:18Z,"@MPjordan lol!!! your such a noob!! retard!!


south park rules!!"
,synthent,2011-06-09T16:09Z,"@parkcentral

,Krisiun,2011-06-09T23:12Z,"Rated arg for pirates. F**k you! But yeah, did they spend like 30 seconds writing this? Season 15 is weak : /"
,Joab1,2011-06-10T00:18Z,"@synthent
I lol'd


Good episode; I think it was a big ruse. It would be great if it just reset as usual.It would be the ultimate troll."
,RanY2jith,2011-06-10T00:44Z,"Stop with the 10 year old shit, the show was very funny and the ending was just absolute you faggots, if you don't like it, either your a fucking dickweed or a moron who doesn't understand a shitty thing on the last episode. 

Let these guys atleast end their season 15 with an average season as if you are expecting a 10/10 episode you ass maggots, that era is gone for real. "
,mancbhoy,2011-06-10T01:19Z," @alan_007 DONT SAY NOOB YOU RETARD! and to the rest slaggin south park, it is'nt getting bad, your just getting old ""grandads"""
,doser69,2011-06-10T04:56Z,"7 episodes left of the season (2nd half)

After that, who knows what happens.

Very sad ending.

The end is nigh, going by this episode

PS. Fleetwood Mac - Landslide"
,drcat123,2011-06-10T08:00Z,the episode was crap to me but stan's mom made the episode make sense at least to me. 
,mister_pirate,2011-06-10T11:14Z,"@RanY2jith - You are a stupid fuck. This episode was SHIT and the creators clearly acknowledge the noticeable drop in quality this season. No one is asking for a 10/10, but they can atleast make it seem like they are trying.Hence the viewer backlash. 

Do you understand? You stupid dickweed moron."
,mister_pirate,2011-06-10T11:18Z,"P.S)Anyone who believes that this season does not suck big-time compared to any other season or episode is lying. It's like you are being buttfucked, but denying you are taking it up the ass. 

None of the episodes work fully if you've paid attention - A promising idea is run into the ground by un-inspriing decisions made by writers (Asian guy is actually Caucasian, crack baby basketball episode etc). The ""Penis"" episode was funny tho in parts...kinda reminded me of the quality of previous seasons. "
,DarthExile,2011-06-10T14:02Z,this EP was so shitty 
,blfunser,2011-06-10T17:58Z,i dont care what anyone thinks or has to say so i can relate to stan good ep
,supersteve2345,2011-06-11T12:18Z,Fair to say South park has went down the shitter
,Azriel2.0,2011-06-11T18:56Z,"its all good guys. south park may not be on form but to say that its shit is an exaggeration.

also, this is a sharing site - where's the love? seems like alot of users are just using the comment section to vent their anger.

light up a massive bifta, chill out and watch some cartoons."
,2ch.so,2011-06-11T19:08Z,                    YOU'RE GETTING OLD!
,ozmartian,2011-06-12T14:38Z,"come off it guys! the Canadian Royal Wedding episode was okay, albeit nostalgic and nothing much new I guess."
,bapwa,2011-06-12T15:58Z,"wow, that was a really shitty episode..."
,johan184,2011-06-12T21:55Z,"does anyone know what the 2 old farmers is trying to save?

I know breeches are means pants, but I dont understand what the farmers refering to...."
,rodvd,2011-06-13T03:08Z,epic shyt
,Jay2him,2011-06-13T17:02Z,"Woah holy fuckin shit dude, i come to innocently download a southpark episode and everybodies raging. can't we all just get along? Everything has to die sometime, even Kenny. i have to admit i've seen funnier episodes in the past, but it still cracks me up, how much they take the piss. that tooth decay episode? its like they weren't even trying to think of a story line, they just used the manitee tank, but it was fuckin hilarious"
,bigredwill,2011-06-14T08:28Z,"seriously, people. go back to the first and watch some of that shit. do you really want more ""volcano"" and ""weight gain 4000"" episodes? those were funny as hell, but they certainly couldn't just keep making chicken pot pie and women in kitchen jokes... they had to go somewhere. I think this episode is more of a response to the the endless number of trolls out there. if you think it's shit... ya"
,heyman1981,2011-06-14T11:45Z,CRAB PEOPLE
,hops727,2011-06-14T20:19Z,"I don't care what none of ya'll think. I grew up watching south park, and believe it's the best show that ever was. So fuck all the haters, if you don't like it, don't watch it.. Idiots."
,adamr6,2011-06-15T15:09Z,"The BEST episode for ages, awesome and very clever."
,bzerk22,2011-06-15T16:59Z,"I personally think that the South Park episodes has decreased in quality since season 13.
I still enjoy the episodes, but they seem to get less and less funny for each new episode that comes out.

I still enjoy watching episodes through season 4-13 alot, so don't come here and call me a troll ;)

Good torrent anyway, great quality as always. .)"
,luke444,2011-06-16T09:32Z,"shut the fuck up cunts!! season 15 is hilarious, all you cocksuckas who think different can eat my shit, then shit it out then eat my shit again. faggets"
,Don_16G2,2011-06-16T18:52Z,"ah maaaaan, just saw melancholia earlier today where the world ends and now this shit!!!!! Goddamn, shit's depressing, man!"
,alex0008,2011-06-17T05:52Z,"About the breeches...
I kinda felt like they represent South Park as a whole.
If it's true that Matt and Trey are not enjoying themselves anymore, then continuing to make more episodes (which may therefore suck), is analogous to farting in those ""poor breeches"".

Listen to when the farmers are jumping out of the window after stealing them."
,namshub,2011-06-17T06:38Z,"I've been watching SP forever, and completely adore it. HOWEVER, I have to agree that in the past couple seasons some of the epis have been of far poorer quality than I expect from the SP team. This is a shame.

By the way, for all you bitchy little twits whose sole method of disagreeing with someone online basically just involves choosing a few words from a short and pathetically unimaginitive list of simple curses and inserting them into a staggeringly inept sentence; a sentence with such poor spelling and grammar, normal people read it and think you've suffered a severe and permanent brain injury in the past and are forced to wear a diaper for the rest of your life: grow up. Please. You're annoying & boring.

(Look at that, you CAN insult people without using overused curse words!)

Thus ends the rant.

Look, people disagree. It doesn't have to become a contest to see who can sound the most moronic the quickest. Half the comments I read on the Internet make me feel as if I should apologize to my eyes for subjecting them to such misery. (And saying it's only half is a very kind estimate).

The more you curse, and the more people see curses everywhere, the less powerful - and thus the less useful - those curses become. Hey, didn't SP do an epi ABOUT THE VERY SAME FUCKING THING?

Anyway - thanks eztv. Once again, you're the best."
,wojtek88,2011-06-18T10:52Z,"I think it's just hilarious how the people complaining about how shitty this episode is are missing the irony here. You people are suffering from the same melancholy cynical bullshit as Stan. Stop being so vehement about your complaints. Either something is your thing or it's not. Why the hate? You've completely missed the point of what you're slagging.

Thanks, eztv for the upload. You're the best."
,simoncuynen,2011-06-21T20:03Z,when is the next episode?
[V],maximersk,2011-06-25T23:10Z,"Awesome TV shows
Guys, you're fucking awesome !"
,Inter4ction,2011-06-28T03:04Z,"Hahahaha this EP was so full of shit! :D i'm not complaining just like those others arent complaining, they are just telling facts that this ep is actualy full of shit :P"
,bleys666,2011-06-30T20:16Z,"Thanks EZ

Anyone else felt like the last conversation between Randy and Sharon was actually about South Park itself?"
,Tallaksen,2011-07-02T16:36Z,When is the next episode released?
,CommentsAbove,2011-07-06T09:57Z,"Next episode is on October 5, 2011. Going to be a while stop asking."

,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-07-08T21:42Z,"Damn..why do they stop for such a long time? Do they have vacation now?

Let's just wait. "
,kiloweess,2011-07-16T21:35Z,"I think that was the last episode. There were metaphors galore about the ""show"" getting shittier so the best thing to do is hang it up. I hope they don't but I think that's what they're doing."
,teemu92,2011-07-24T02:41Z,"good stuff, i love you :):)"
,GeekAtWork,2011-09-11T11:15Z,"Poor Stan, thanks for this episode"

What is truly shit is family guy...
Brainless piece of shit comedy.."
,ADNC,2011-09-26T18:45Z,"""Anyone else felt like the last conversation between Randy and Sharon was actually about South Park itself?""
Yes, they were making the point of as time goes on people change...10 years ago a kid with a satellite dish coming out his ass was funny...now it is immature...they were making the statement of growing up sucks...saying good buy to the old fans (who no longer find the show gunny)...are they done for good? who can say  "
,Cheyenne-tgy,2011-11-14T20:23Z,thanks mate.
