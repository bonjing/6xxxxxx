,majtophat,2011-06-10T20:32Z,"I am connected to 24 peers but no seeders... 

I downloaded 10.2% nearly instantly and then nothing..."
,UriGerkov,2011-06-10T20:56Z,"Dead torrent, no seed of ANY type."
,jazzmelody9,2011-06-13T07:58Z,Torrent is NOT dead. I removed required encryption. Now you can download from me without encryption.
,Cyan11,2011-06-13T10:05Z,Why none of the checksums match? This makes me really suspicious.
,jazzmelody9,2011-06-16T01:08Z,I dont know but these files went on Demonoid before TPB.
,jazzmelody9,2011-06-16T01:13Z,"I know now. Sorry, my fault. I repacked this released and obviously changed MD5.

,yamala,2011-08-01T14:27Z,"@jazzmelody9 

i have a problem.

i installed crossover office in /opt/cxoffice/ by sudo sh 'filename' in terminal

i made patch executable since it does not execute in terminal and on applying patch, i inserted my name, clicked patch, a browse box popped and i directed it to /opt/cxoffice/

but on patching (clicking open box), i get a message box from crossover linux to insert registration mail and password.

what have i incorrectly followed? "
,yamala,2011-08-01T15:15Z,"@jazzmelody9 

i solved my install problem. on reinstalling the app in /home folder, i got message that i was fully registered.

thanks for this app."

,adkyz,2012-03-19T22:52Z,how to run CrossOver_10_Patch_by_Pesymista_32bit ???????
,matricx76,2012-04-17T16:56Z,Please upload the new Crossover 11 (with crack of course).
,matricx76,2012-04-17T17:03Z,Please upload Crossover 11 with crack.
,Cant1,2012-05-31T09:02Z,I know you probably have a lot of requests but when you get a chance could you crack the Linux version of Sublime Text 2? I know Sublime Text has a free trial that for now has no time limit but im worried about when it does get a limit. Also i know it isn't that expensive but i mean its a fucking text editor(a very good one i will admit) but i don't understand how the hell you can charge people for a text editor? I will seed that for 2 months at least! Oh and thanks for the uploads you have made so far. I really like the Zen Studio one :D Which im going to seed for a while.
