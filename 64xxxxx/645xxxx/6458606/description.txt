Creator: Codeweavers
Version: 10.0.0
Website:
Protection: Subscription
Unpacked using: Nothing
Cracked by: Pesymista
Release date: Thu, 03 Feb 2011

Instruction: 
1. Install CrossOver Office, CrossOver Games, or both if you want.
2. Verify that checksums match IF DONT RUN IT! FIND ANOTHER RELEASE!
2.5 Check that you ARE NOT root, never run similar tools as root! just change file permissions.
3. Run CrossOver_10_Patch_by_Pesymista_(32bit or 64bit)
4. Enter your name. 
5. Select CrossOver product that you want patch.
6. Click \\\"Patch!\\\" and select cxgames or cxoffice directory.
6. Enjoy!

**************************
Bonus (you don\\\'t need to do anything from instructions below if you done these above,
after patch CrossOver will not care about trial date)

Trial reset:
1. Go to .cxoffice or .cxgames (depens on that with bottle you want reset)
2. Enter to directory with name of your bottle.
3. Open \\\"system.reg\\\" file in your favorite text editor.
4. Find [Software\\\\\\\\CodeWeavers\\\\\\\\CrossOver\\\\\\\\cxoffice] string.
5. After it should be: \\\"InstallTime\\\"=dword:12345678 (of course you\\\'ll have another number here)
6. Run Patcher and press \\\"Reset trial\\\" button, in textbox will appear new hash.
7. Replace old hash (in this case 12345678) with new one generated by Patcher, save and close file.
8. Run CrossOver, now it think that you created this bottle today and still have 30 days of trial ;)
   In most cases nag\\\'s will not appear coz it depends on install date.
9. Enjoy!

Ofcourse you need to repeat this process to evey expired bottle, and they will still expire,
so you\\\'ll need to repeat this for every bottle after 30 or 7 days.
