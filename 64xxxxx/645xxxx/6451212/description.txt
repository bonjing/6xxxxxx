Many fans consider this Greatest Hits as the best Police compilation now available, for the number of tracks included and choice to include only original versions. It contains all your basic Police tracks but it also adds some. If you're looking for a good introduction to The Police or to get a taste of what their music was like, I would highly recommend this.
