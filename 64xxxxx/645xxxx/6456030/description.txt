ReleaseNotes:

Bill Lacey, credited here with "audio restoration," successfully freshens and brightens the group's familiar, diverse string of 1969-70 hits: the lush ballad "These Eyes," the jangly "Laughing," and 1970's superb two-sided hit "No Time"/"Undun," showing off lead guitarist Randy Bachman's respective jazzy and heavy rock guitar styles. Then again, few songs have aged more poorly than the clumsy protest anthems "Share The Land," "Hand Me Down World," and
the pretentious, Psalm-quoting "Hang On To Your Life." (Michael Hill's well-researched liner notes show the group craving the FM radio cache' these message songs brought.)

We rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.
HHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)
