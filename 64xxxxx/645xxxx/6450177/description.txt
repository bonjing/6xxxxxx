Hoxsey - How Healing Becomes a Crime (1987)

In 1924, Harry Hoxsey claimed a cure for cancer using herbal formulas. Organized medicine has banned the therapy, exiling it to Mexico. Is there a cure for cancer? Thousands flocked to Harry Hoxsey's clinics across the United States hoping that his herbal and dietary remedy would stave off their life-threatening illnesses. The story of this colorful man and his battle with medical authorities is told in Hoxsey: How Healing Becomes a Crime. Insightful and sympathetic, the film uses contemporary news footage and interviews with those involved, including patients and clinicians at the Tijuana clinic that continues his work. Though there's only anecdotal evidence that his program works, enough people swear by it to provoke at least curiosity in the viewer; it's hard to see how the medical establishment could keep their eyes closed for so long. Whether he was a snake-oil hustler or a mistreated humanitarian, Hoxsey's life makes compelling viewing.
