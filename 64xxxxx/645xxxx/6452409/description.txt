Based upon the classic novel by Graham Greene, Brighton Rock is a gripping, razor 
edged thriller. 

The directorial debut of screenwriter Rowan Joffe (28 Weeks Later), Brighton Rock 
features two generations of Britainâ€™s greatest acting talent including Sam Riley 
(Control), Andrea Riseborough (Never Let Me Go), Helen Mirren (The Queen) and 
John Hurt (The Elephant Man).

Joffe recruits Sam Riley, Helen Mirren, John Hurt and Andrea Riseborough for the 
film, and steers a path thatâ€™s slightly different from the book.

The plot

The year is 1964. The place is Brighton. A once quiet seaside town is suddenly 
overrun by gangs of sharp suited Mods and greasy Rockers looking for a riot. 

Amongst the chaos lurks top Mod and gangster Pinkie Brown. Ruthless, ambitious 
and horrifically violent, Pinkie will stop at nothing in his brutal quest to 
make a name for himself within the criminal underworld. 

But when a cold bloodied killing links him to a waitress named Rose, he uses 
seduction to secure her silence. 

Can Rose be saved in time from Pinkie, or will he drag her further into a world 
of death and damnation?

It was always going to be a brave move to bring another version of Graham Greeneâ€™s 
Brighton Rock to the big screen,yet thereâ€™s enough of an identity within director 
Rowan Joffeâ€™s take on the materialto give the film a distinction of its own.
