Why else would the roms be encoded in a compression format that no one has ever heard of, forcing you to use the ""conveniently"" included software to decompress it?? What, are you to fucking good for ZIP or RAR?? In fact, the torrent itself is already compressed in RAR so what the fuck is the point in compressing the roms again??

Stay away from bullshit like this."
,Searinox_Navras,2011-10-14T19:03Z,"@matrixban: would you like a tinfoil hat with that?

On a side note I keep seeing FreeArc more and more often, what's the deal? Is it better than 7zip compressing at ultra?"

His .Arc file he gives you to use to open his emulator and roms is as follows:

Threat Name:Trojan Horse
