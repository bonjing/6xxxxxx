Nothing ripped?"
[T],torrentshredder,2011-06-10T12:05Z,"this is scene release you faggot. he didnt do anything to it. its the scene who pack and create the releases. are you really this fucked up to ask such bullshit for real? look at all the other unpacked torrents of the duke here for example on tpb and elsewhere, then you will see the real size of the iso.
faggot."
,Pakundo,2011-06-10T12:08Z,this comment serves one purpose - to read the 2nd comment.
,Pakundo,2011-06-10T12:10Z,"torrentshredder, I don't know what kind of stick is up your ass, but obviously you didn't think that at the time I didn't download the torrent yet.
Yes, I know the size of the iso is 4.51GB, but I was simply hoping SOMEONE manged to find a way to further compress the iso file ITSELF, while still keeping it readable, so that in some way, you could burn it onto 1 DVD.

tl;dr If game companies can burn as much as over 7GB of data onto 1 DVD that my PC can read, why can't we?
Or are we being sold Dual-Layered DVDs in retail that contain our games?"
[T],torrentshredder,2011-06-10T12:47Z,you must be new to this shit. since when do you actually burn anything onto dvd that is scene released. are you really this new to the game? get some clues first before burning useless dvd or cd media in the first place. retard.

What's funny is that I'm not new to this at all, actually, I've been downloading torrents and scene releases quite awhile.
I know they make iso files out of the contents of retail disks, which don't seem to be normal DVDs, probably Dual-Layered, hence the fact retail games usuallyhave more than 4.36GB of content in them.

Since when I burn Scene release content onto DVD(s)?
Since I want to backup my games and not be forced to re-download them every time I want to install them, and since I don't have a very spacey hard-drive, or any external one, it's DVD burning and backing-up for me. 
Also, you need to relax.
Really."
