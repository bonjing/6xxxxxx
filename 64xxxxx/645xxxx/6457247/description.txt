           FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT THINK THEY KNOW WHAT MEANS my aka DeGun : 

         DeGun is french slang from south Marseille/TOULON which means :

          NO ONE - NOBODY - DeGun DOES NOT means "da gun or the gun etc" 

         I AM NO ONE ! I AM NOBODY ! NO GUNS TOLERATED ! NO FUSS & FIGHT .
