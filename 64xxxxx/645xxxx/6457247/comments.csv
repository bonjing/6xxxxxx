[V],DeGun,2011-06-28T18:10Z,Yep thats wat it is for ... mainly .
[V],DeGun,2011-06-29T22:20Z,"i ve noticed premium links i created with a debrid site are dead , i guess they only live for a 24h period , i guess as never before this happened to me .

Basicly go onto a free site to debrid yur links , there is many on the www so enter ""rapidshare debrid links"" and find one where yuh can get http direct link or premium links... now rapidshare puts 1h wait between two downloads (as free user) when before this limit was only 10 or 15mn so it is annoying to wait all this time ... try to convert yur links or be patient with JdownloadeR.

,Maverz,2012-04-29T22:33Z,Do the voices support 64-bit platform? So far the ones I've found are only for x86 (32 bit) and they don't work in x64..
