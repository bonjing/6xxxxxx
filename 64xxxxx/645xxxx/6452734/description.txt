Product Description: 
This book comprises a collection of papers given at the third biennial conference of the Centre for Property Law at the University of Reading held in March 2000, and is the first in the series Ã¢â‚¬ËœModern Studies in Property LawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The papers focus on issues of immediate importance ranging from human rights to electronic conveyancing, as well as timeless but ever-relevant subjects such as trusts, mortgages and the numerus clausus of property rights. As ever, a range of international topics are discussed, this time including land registration in the Nordic countries, and the re-privatisation of land in Eastern Europe.
