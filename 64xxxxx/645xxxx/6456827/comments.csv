,BoonesFerry,2011-06-10T08:18Z,"@mikebuckets, this is not a forum for requesting movies...but I suppose you might get lucky. The movie documentary you mentioned was just released to theaters only 3 days ago and so far I could find no DVD release date information. You might have better luck waiting a month and try you search again. "

[V],err0001,2011-06-10T10:28Z,"People can certainly ask for TV movies here if they wish. Though they shouldn't necessarily expect a response. There is no point asking err0001 for non-TV material though. 

The Bobby Fischer movie doesn't seem to show up in the TV schedule in Canada within the next 2 weeks."

,cindy25,2011-06-14T04:19Z,"this has become sort of a forum bcuz Pirate Bay doesn't have a PM function. 

I wish the scene would do a better job with TV movies, but they don't so we have to ask wherever we can.

thanks to err001 for this, and also for Too Big to Fail. I pay for HBO but HBO asia just did not show it. "
,cindy25,2011-06-14T13:15Z,"do u get Lifetime in Canada?
