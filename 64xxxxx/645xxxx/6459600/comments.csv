,Melangell,2011-08-07T10:59Z,"I replaces the files in the installations directory with the fixfiles and then ran del.lic.ser and the licensing service was stopped successfully, but when I tried to run the programme, it terminated it because the licensing service was stopped. Did I miss a really obvious step somewhere? Was I supposed to disconnect from the internet first or something?
Which installation directory was I supposed to copy the fixfiles into, the one finereader created in programme files, or the folder I created to extract the winrar file to? Sorry for being a little obtuse."
