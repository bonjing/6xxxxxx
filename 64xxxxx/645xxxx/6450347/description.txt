                First in a new five-part crime drama. After suffering
                a nervous breakdown, high profile defence barrister
                William Travers turned his back on the murder cases
                that made him his name and moved with his family to
                Suffolk. One day, an old university friend asks
                Travers to defend him for a murder he swears he did
                not commit. Old allegiances are tested and his
                family's fragile peace is threatened as Travers
                returns to London and his old chambers. Meanwhile, a
                body is found on a deserted farm in the Suffolk
                countryside and Detective Sergeant Mark Wenborn is
                assigned his biggest case yet.
