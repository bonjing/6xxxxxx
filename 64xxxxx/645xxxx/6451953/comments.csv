+1"
,brutal_product,2011-06-10T05:13Z,"dude, wtf? i have dl'ed alot of torrents in my day and seen alot of weird file formats, but wtf is this shit? only thing i got to successfully unrar was the keygen (the numbered rars, not the lettered ones) hopefully the keygen will work on the demo, but this upload is nuked."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-08-06T01:08Z,this is one of the dumbest packaging jobs i've ever seen. 50+ separated zip files with other 50+ separated rar files zipped inside them all for 1 exe.
,Jiia,2011-09-20T21:35Z,"WTF is this crap. 50 individual zip files that each contain one part of a split rar file.

Just download some other release or be prepared to spend the evening unzipping the files separately."
,pshelley,2011-10-01T10:50Z,"Uploader, please could you shed some light on why you saw fit to package this the way you did?  I have been downloading torrents for years and have NEVER seen anything so stupid. Here is your chance to defend your work, otherwise people are just going to think you are a F*****G retard!"
,CRimsonEagleX,2011-10-06T02:10Z,"I thought that there was a false positive in this but I guess that it was really a virus because a folder named ""3DMARK.11.PRO.V1.0.2.MULTILINGUAL.INCL.KEYMAKER-CORE"" pops up in my documents everytime my computer restarts. & What a dumbass packaging job, burn in hell asshole."
,AzatiPrime,2011-10-11T23:33Z,This is without a doubt the single most retarded torrent I have ever seen.  WTF are you thinking?

,fuzzeh,2011-10-21T20:05Z,"For all you morons qqing about the archived packaging being harder then a single right click to unpack:
Step 1. Select All
Step 2. Right click and unrar
Step 3. Repeat

To the uploader: Thanks for all the good stuff~!

False-positive show up for me on the keygen, my antivirus flags all keygens as potentially malicious. "
,pbpyrojust,2011-11-11T20:05Z,"Wow, this is a horrible packaging job. Wow."
,koocat102,2011-11-14T10:00Z,"You are all idiots. The file is packaged that way to make it harder for the Feds and anyone to else figure out what is inside. AND furthermore how dare you complain about something you stole/ i mean borrowed in the first place.  I mean really what kind of person are you?    if you can't use a computer then dont use one. 

other than that. Thank you very much for the package I got it to install perfectly but the keygen wont run. keeps spitting out an error on permissions.  dunno whats wrong with it"
,atemlos,2011-12-22T14:32Z,"crashing during test,some files are missing from the program,rubbish."
,Jeronwong,2012-01-20T04:48Z,"I've seen this kind of packaging for a torrent, I believe it was for Grand Theft Auto, but I don't remember what to do. I remember it had something to do with extracting everything to the same folder and it merges by itself."
,Goldfire1986,2012-01-29T08:27Z,"@koocat102 ""...make it harder for the Feds...""

That's rich, considering the name of this torrent is at the top + they can easily download the file for themselves. -.-"
,Ballsw4gg,2012-02-23T22:38Z,"Guys, it's pretty obvious isn't it?
Files are packaged this way because antivirus won't go down through two levels of archives to look for trojans, which this is almost certainly infested with.

Jesus, you people are a hacker's wet dream."
,IR-BRU,2012-03-09T18:08Z,yip so stupid waste of time...grrrrrr
,iCrazyNoob,2012-03-14T21:20Z,"This torrent works 100% tested.
ok guys here is how you do it:
1.First you need winRAR or some kind of de-compressor.
Then after downloading you will end up with bunch of .zip files. 
2.Select them all, and select ""Extract Here"". Have to be that selection not making each into separate folders.
3.Now you will end up with 59 different compressed rar files. (.part01-.part59) just open the first one and it should automatically extract the installer.
4.Using the keygen extracted from step 2 will register your product.

5. DO NOT UPDATE when it tells you to. It will un-register and you will not be able to register again."
,drbenzo,2012-03-17T03:58Z,Yea these aren't false positives at all. Torrent sucks
,ViperH,2012-04-06T15:21Z,"This torrent is FUCKING retarded. The multi-part rars in torrents are bad enough but this is a fucking joke.

I hope the uploader gets his car rammed through a railroad crossing barrier into an oncoming freight train."
,suiggy,2012-05-02T13:06Z,"it works, but adding installation instructions could've been helpful."
