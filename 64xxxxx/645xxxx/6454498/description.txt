Plot -
A New York City ballet company is producing Swan Lake, and director Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) and is in the process of casting for the lead role of the Swan Queen. Dancer Nina (Natalie Portman) lives with her overbearing mother, former ballerina Erica Barbara 
Hershey), who puts pressure on her daughter to succeed where her career failed. 

Nina finds competition in new dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) and struggles with the stress by apparently mutilating herself. Swan Lake requires a ballerina who can play the innocent White Swan, which fits Nina, and the sensual Black Swan, which fits Lily, but Nina gets the part after she violently rebuffs the sexual advances of Leroy. The dancers' rivalry changes into a bizarre friendship as the show's debut approaches, and Nina begins being overtaken by dark revenge fantasies against Lily and starts to lose her grip on reality.
