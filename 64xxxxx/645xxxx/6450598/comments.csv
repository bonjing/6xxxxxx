,buttslaya117,2011-06-07T10:50Z,The host for this conference was such a douche. You will want to kill him within the first 10 minutes.
,iceberg303,2011-06-07T11:14Z,"XAN cant encode for shit!  The quality of this is horrid. All 3 of their E3 releases are encoded non-standard, you will NOT be playing them on ps3, 360, iphone, ipad, android or anything other than a PC and at 288p you will be gouging your eyes out with this one. These guys need to learn what the hell a scene proper is!"
,Xandecs,2011-06-07T14:02Z,"Show some respect iceberg303.. I clearly say in the information that the Ubisoft stream was bad, it has nothing to do with the encoding.. And I hopefully will get a 540p release later on."

,TCU-Fratdaddy,2011-06-08T01:42Z,"Hey Xandecs, screw all the ungrateful leechers. I actually appreciate what you're doing here and I can't wait to take my time rewatching all of these conferences. Obviously 720p would be great but this is already plenty. (If you do end up offering higher quality versions, I vote for Sony first)"
,UAREDUMB,2011-06-15T19:36Z,How about the G4 Live tv coverage? Do you have or know anyone who has it?
