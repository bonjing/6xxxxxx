,Darth-JOE,2011-06-16T18:49Z,This Looks Nice.. but any body know if it will work on PS3...??? Thanks for the upload man!
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-16T20:56Z,@Darth-JOE:  All I can tell you is it says right in the info  that this format is PS3 compatible. The info was copied from an old HD-R-US post. I do not own one so I can not say for sure.
,odie74,2011-06-17T10:41Z,"""First volume descriptor type not primary like ISO9660 requires""

Probably fake UL...."
,odie74,2011-06-17T15:54Z,"Forget my previous comment, it's no fake UL. You can burn this ISO with Nero Buring ROM and then play the m2ts-file with VLC, but since the ISO doesn't seem to be standard it can be a bit tricky to mount the ISO directly.

Thanks for sharing thetorrentlord !!"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-17T19:38Z,@odie74: This is as standard as it can get as it was made with ImgBurn  and as it says in the info it is Blu-ray format AVCHD which is not a standard iso. It would need to be played with Blu-ray software or on anything that can play a Blu-ray disc.

True HD on my plasma screen. Perfect.

Please keep the AVCHD coming, thank you!"
