,mortiis34,2011-06-07T00:46Z,"Dean cheers. The last week of Corrie has been fantastic, but I've missed the full lengths! Seriously, I would watch this show all day long if I could, but there just isn't enough corrie to fulfill my addiction to it!

Would you ever consider uploading some 'classic' older episodes (not like really old, but 2000's era) when Richard Hillman etc were at large?"
,BRITGIRL,2011-06-07T01:42Z,Thank you very much for this one and all the other great uploads! Thanks for your time and effort. You make lots of people very happy from all over the world :))
