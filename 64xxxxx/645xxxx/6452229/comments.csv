,Yberman33,2011-06-08T14:45Z,"a question, if you upload a series why do you skip some of the episodes? Episode 60, 61, 63 65 and 66 is in the middle of these episodes and yet not in the upload."
,The22eht,2011-06-08T15:51Z,"It's a different angle on the serie, a focus on the Master. I'm uploading the DW episodes with him, only him but all of them (as far as i know) through all the seasons. "
,Yberman33,2011-06-15T21:38Z,"Allright, thanx for the explanation. Just thought it looked a bit weird the first time i read about the upload. But now I get it =) Havent seen any of those episodes so just thought I would miss alot of the story if i dl this. Will look around for al episodes around that time instead. But thanx any way"
