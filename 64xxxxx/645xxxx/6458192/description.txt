Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: Had to catch the rebroadcast again. Today they didn't turn on the web broadcast until halfway through the 3rd hour!  And when they rebroadcast it, the quality was extremely crappy, so I did the best I could.
