As the fabled Atlantis and our own Nordic forbidden pagan past are about to be discovered as being one and the same
culture, time seems to be right for the revelation of the inner secrets of that culture. Told by Ior Bock, the last
in an unbroken family lineage of storytellers going all the way back to heathen times, these tales expose the very
core of a past that would otherwise be lost in academic speculation.

| Release note |
----------------

This massive 5-DVD package contains the words and theories of the late Ior Bock, a Finnish guru and truly the walker
of his own path. It records his controversioal theories about the ancestry of Finns - as well as offers insight to the
following he gathered. The "purpose" of this release is to encourage people to find their own place in life, despite the
pressures and constraits society or specific people might impose to you. Ior Bock can be seen as a lunatic and an esoteric, 
but he lived his own way. This way ended unfortunately 23th of October 2010, by the hand and blade of his own cultist-housekeeper.

These are his stories, as reported by Morten Joramo.
