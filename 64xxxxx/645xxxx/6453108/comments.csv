I've been downloading your torrent for a while now, felt like i owe a big ""thank you"" for you"
,r-0987,2011-06-08T11:17Z,Thanks! Peter Sellers is the best...
,AndroidLove,2011-06-08T12:49Z,"BIG BIG THANKS YIFY! Kubrick and Sellers are two of my favorites!! Lately I've been coming onto TPB and doing a search for YIFY cos the quality to file size ratio on your uploads are some of the best!!!
Thanks a million!

Would it be possible for you to do a full Kubrick series, Peter Sellers series & David Lynch series? That would be killer!!"

I can't believe no one else even mentioned it...and no, I'm not going to disable thumbnail generation and use tiles or some fuck else."
