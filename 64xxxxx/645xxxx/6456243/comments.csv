,Danj303,2011-06-23T04:18Z,Worst episode I've seen in a real long time. And I thought southpark was over the shit jokes...
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-29T21:47Z,@{C_P} when will you upload episode 8 its been like nearlly 3 weeks since episode 7. And also keep up the good work.
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-29T21:48Z,As real as they come.
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-03T01:47Z,I wonder why the SouthPark creators were releasing a new episode every fortnight or weekly and now they still havent aired SouthPark Ep8 S15 and the last aired Episode was on June 8 2011. So its been like 4 nearlly 5 weeks.
,mohiergauth,2011-07-17T15:28Z,"Ok people people people, this is SOUTHPARK, not the fucking BRAVO fag network. There is no such thing as decorum in SOUTHPARK, don't you get that? Southpark without shit jokes is like a gay bar without chaps, izod shirts and tom collins'. 

And let us remember the disclaimer at the beginning of EVERY single Southpark episode.

If you don't like Southpark anymore, fine asshole, don't watch anymore. Don't expect it to beco,e all cerebral and shit. When it does, it ceases to be Southpark. "
