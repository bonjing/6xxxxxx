                Third in the five-part drama. William Travers
                continues to probe into the Martin Newall murder case
                while valiantly fighting off the ghosts of his past.
                Sure that the missing laptop will hold the key,
                Travers and Natalie Chandra visit the scene of the
                crime and meet the chambermaid who will become a key
                witness. Meanwhile, Jane is on a quest to find out
                more about Alan Stewart, the young offender whose
                debut novel she would love to publish. Wenborn's
                investigations are advanced further when he goes to
                visit Jeremy Forbes-Watson, Travers's old adversary.
