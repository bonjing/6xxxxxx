With coverage in applied exercise psychology, motivation technique, and theories and models in health psychology, Dr. Anshel shows us how the mental health practitioner can not only learn about the positive mental health effects of exercise and activity, but also how he or she can interpret this information and use it to help clients become more physically fit.
