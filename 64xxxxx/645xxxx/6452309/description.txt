Product Description: 
This collection of articles by scientists from various disciplines discusses all the significant conceptual and empirical advances in the study of behavioral development. A special feature of the approach taken here is that learning is considered to be one process contributing to the development of the individual from conception to death. The brain's development is also discussed in relation to behavioral processes.
