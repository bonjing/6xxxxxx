aka 

thanks alot this a legit and the crack is from ali213 becuase it seems skidrow is gone"
,Necroclysm,2011-06-09T11:20Z,"Yes well, even if it is legit, it will probably be removed.
Someone keeps reporting all the Red Faction torrents as fakes, despite them not being so.

The torrents claiming to be Skidrow do include an actual iso of the game, with a supposedly working crack, but the crack is passworded.  The iso itself is fine.  I can understand those torrents being removed.

However, someone is reporting the CLONEDVD releases as fake(including one someone uploaded that is already cracked and extracted for you).  They are NOT fake, stop reporting it as such because someone in the comments is claiming it is a fake.  If you do not understand how to use Phoenix, it does not make it a fake.

Someone also reported the crack from ali213 as fake and it was removed.  This is a legitimate non-scene crack."

Same happened with the crysis 2 leak , and other leaked games , some individuals are just too stupid to think and report on sight"
,elturbo9077,2011-06-09T14:46Z,for ya people to understand the uploader is argentinan but the uploads are all full like extremezone aitb .bone but this guy have low seeders becuase motherfuckers can not read spanish and see that is multi 5 and not only one language 
,Robbajohn,2011-06-09T16:02Z,"when this works ill be seeding it.  the games been out a couple days, there should be a few working torrents by now.    only a few to several hours to download."
,Psiboi,2011-06-09T16:49Z,"I can't get the game to install. I'm at the launcher where it asks whether you want DX9 or 10/11 installations, and clicking on either option does nothing. Pressing enter simply closes the launcher all together. Am I missing something??"
,stiltet,2011-06-09T18:01Z,"Works GREAT! :D
Thank you verry mutch UL!
Ps. The game is in English!"
,stiltet,2011-06-09T18:13Z,"ATTENTION! You donÂ´t have to install the game.
Simly follow these steps:

1. Download.

2. Copy the contents from your download-folder to any location on your computer, for example ""C:/Games"".

3. Extract the file ""Red.Faction.Armageddon.Crack.Patch.By.Ali213.rar"".

4. Run the crack patch. The lang is crap but simply guess witch is the next buton and proced with standard options. The only thing you shuld change is the path to the game folder.

5. Run ""vcredist_x86.exe"" from game folder and install.

6. Run ""DXSETUP.exe"" from ""DirectX""-folder and install.

7. Play the game using ""rf4_launcher.exe"", chose if you want to play with DX9 or DX10/11.
Don't play the game using ""RedFactionArmageddon.exe"" or ""RedFactionArmageddon_DX11.exe"". If you do so the game will crash!

8. HAVE FUN!"

,lukeneves,2011-06-10T16:21Z,"Not working for me, can't get past the crack patch, where you have to choose a folder where to install the game. When I click next button it shows some message in gibberish and I click ok and it goes back to select folder window. Any clues? WIN7 64 bit supported?"
,lukeneves,2011-06-10T18:46Z,"Got it to work after all. Anybody got any sound issues? Voices mainly, I can't hear them too well!"
,Roboghrunt,2011-06-10T22:45Z,@lukeneves i dont have any sound problems but i downloaded a clone dvd and not this one so i dunno. but i used ali's patch also
,videinfra,2011-06-19T02:12Z,is there anyway to crack this for multiplayer?  single player functions work great.  anytime I try to host a LAN game or play online it just crashes. 
,Dimmis80,2011-06-20T09:48Z,Its working just great.@stiltet thanks for the instructions and @consolasatope dude great upload thanks man.:)
