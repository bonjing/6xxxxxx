,bloominoctober,2011-06-10T14:27Z,"Has anyone been able to find Fear Itself: Fearsome Four #1?  I've been looking practically non-stop since late Wednesday for it with no luck.  I found the other two Fear Itself tie-ins (Fear Itself: Deadpool #1 and Journey Into Mystery #624), but no luck on Fearsome Four :-/"
