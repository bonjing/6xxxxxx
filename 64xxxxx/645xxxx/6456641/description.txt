::Plot::
 The film opens with an intertitle displaying the quote, "Revenge is a dish best served cold." A pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) lies beaten at her wedding, telling an unseen Bill (David Carradine) that it is his baby, before he shoots her in the head. Sometime later, The Bride finds Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) at her home and fights her, but they cease after Vernita's daughter Nikki arrives from school. It is revealed that both women were former members of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad; elite assassins under the employ of Bill. The squad was ordered by Bill to attack The Bride's wedding in El Paso, Texas. Vernita attempts to kill her with a hidden gun, but dies after being stabbed. The Bride offers Nikki revenge should she seek it as an adult before leaving. She then strikes Vernita's name off a checklist, the second after one "O-Ren Ishii" has already been struck off.
