"Audition #1"

After conducting a nationwide search, 100 of the 
best amateur cooks in America, including a 
police officer, an oil rig engineer, an interior 
designer, a forklift operator, a professional 
poker player, a classical pianist and a tattoo 
shop owner, were flown to Los Angeles in the 
hopes of becoming the next MASTERCHEF and 
walking away with the life-changing grand prize. 
The hopefuls will prepare their signature dishes 
and present them to judges Gordon Ramsay, Joe 
Bastianich and Graham Elliot. The amateur cooks 
will be put through the paces, and only the most 
deserving among them will win the coveted white 
apron and move on to the next round of the 
competition.

Enjoy :)
