,aajduke36,2011-06-10T21:16Z,"So, i got Duke Nukem Forever, so excited about it and all the rest, but when i exit the game then go play again BOOM, no continue game option, just start a new campaign. In-game it says checkpoint reached, but it doesn't save the game. And i can't save it manually. So what the hell is the problem?? Please answer."

,chuckl45,2011-06-11T02:32Z,"OK, it installed just fine and it starts up just fine but when I start to play it stays at a black screen with crosshairs and ""Gotta drink more"" and ""this ain't no pissin' game"" then you pee for 30 seconds. Over and over. Eventually you take a shower and use a blow dryer, all in the dark What's up with that?
I'm using Win7 x64, AMD II x4 BE 955, 8G RAM and a EVGA GT240 card."
,chuckl45,2011-06-11T02:35Z,"Ok, it installed just fine. The game starts up just fine, through the opening credits and scenes, I select ""Let's Rock"" and then I get ""Gotta drink more"" and ""This ain't no pissin' game"" and peeing, over and over. What's up with that?
I'm running Win7 x64, AMD II x4 955 3.58GHz, 8G RAM and an EVGA GT240 card."

For those having trouble try reading the nfo that comes with it. Install, copy, play BUY....Couldn't be simpler."
