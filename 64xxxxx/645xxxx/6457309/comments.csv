,hacker7890,2011-06-09T21:57Z,"Installed from DMG without and problem (Mid 2010 MBP)

It's still a bit buggy, loving some of the new features though."
,joy2707,2011-06-10T03:44Z,i install it and work great
,Hammid,2011-06-10T05:00Z,"Hardly any issues.
It looks like it's soon ready to go for GM (Golden Master!).

Don't forget to really BUY Lion whenever it's released on the Mac App Store.
229 SEK/$29 ain't much of a discussion."

Ive attempted twice and re burnt the image twice.

,spitfirehaz,2011-06-11T05:31Z,"When the final release version comes out will it just update or will you have to reinstall the official RC ? 

And can you install this fresh by burning it to a dvd and doing it that way ?"

,cameronmalek,2011-06-11T19:35Z,Installation didn't work on my 2007 MacBook when doing a clean install. It only works for me when upgrading from Snow Leopard.
,godlullaby,2011-06-12T07:15Z,Everything worked until during installation it says 'can't download updates needed for installation'. It says the same thing with or without connection. And then it stops installing. Most of you don't seem to encounter that problem.
