Product Description: 
The Raoul Wallenberg Institute of Human Rights and Humanitarian Law at Lund University is pleased to introduce the first volume in its new Ã¢â‚¬ËœNew AuthorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ series, which contains the best theses from the human rights masters programmes in Lund and Venice. The new authors contained in this first volume are: Filipa Marques JÃƒÂºnior, Dominic LaferriÃƒÂ¨re, Kajsa Ãƒâ€“brink, Annette Lyth, Mona Ressaissi, Malin KÃƒÂ¤ll and George Jokhadze. 

The issues they discuss are those which have been high on international agendas during recent years: human rights and the fight against terrorism; the human rights of women; state responsibility to ensure adequate standards of living; and the human rights accountability of transnational corporations. 

Collectively, the authors demand the revision of the inadequate theoretical and practical approaches in international human rights law. They address the challenges presented by the world we live in and suggest solutions that are flexible, preserve human dignity and topple the unnecessary barriers between theories and areas of legal regulation. 

The introduction to the volume by Professor Ineta Ziemele notes the importance of human rights education; the writings in this series are one example of the achievements of that education.
