,scottsasse,2011-06-24T09:18Z,"One Quick WARNING: These files are VERY difficult to remove from a flash drive for some reason as are ILPruny's rips of Californication x264 (NOT saying it's a virus but it is a bug so be real cafeful with other portable devices)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't know why, if you do please let me know at DrWynnScott@gmail.com. That being said however the quality of sound and picture are virtually indistinguishable from that of other torrents with files twice this size. The picture quality is one of the best I've seen for such a small file-size, looks great on 42 inch screen and sounds good on home theater! Anyhoo, ...................many THANKS to ILPruny and all you seeders out there!!"
