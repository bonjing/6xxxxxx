                           DESCRiPTiON 

 New series. Comedy in which Chris Lilley plays a host of characters all confronting various
 dilemmas facing young men in the 21st century. Teenage twins Daniel and Nathan dream of
 making a success of the small farm where they live with their widowed mother, her new
 boyfriend and their younger siblings. However, cars, girls and friends prove a distraction.
