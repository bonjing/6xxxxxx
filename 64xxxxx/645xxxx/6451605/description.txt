Here's the Korean horror movie: Bunshinsaba

It was released 2004.

I have it in Full HD with English Subtitles.


The quality of the audio and video is just perfect. This is my first torrent and I hope you'll like it.

It's an .avi file, you can burn it on to a cd/dvd if you want, but I prefer watching it in Windows Media Player :)


Video/file info:

Opinion about the movie:
A very good horror movie, almost like the Ring but in a Korean version.
Very well made. One of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely worth a try.
