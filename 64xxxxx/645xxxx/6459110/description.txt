                School-based drama. Sambuca wants to meet her father
                before she dies, and enlists Lauren and Finn's help
                to track him down in Blackpool. Keen to promote a
                positive image of Waterloo Road, Karen hires a public
                relations 'expert', with terrible results. Meanwhile,
                Naomi's support of Aiden strengthens her bond with
                Rob. Is the fledgling romance between Karen and Rob
                over before it has begun?
