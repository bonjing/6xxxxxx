,Jaeng7,2011-06-11T12:13Z,hello Poothaijaa..Im having trouble burning these for my wife Lady Yaowarat ( disk 3 ) and Mae Yah Nang..when I put a dvd in to burn each disk it says file is too large for dvd-r disk and need dual layer..we dont know what this is..all your other files download and burn to dvd excellent before..can you resize the files so i can fit them onto a normal dvd?
[V],poothaijaa,2011-06-11T18:50Z,"Jaeng: All file (each disc) less than 4.3gb (around 2.2-3.0gb). you should not have a problem.

Are you trying to burn 2 disc into 1 disc?

I use Convertxdvd to burn DVD.

Thanks"
[V],poothaijaa,2011-06-12T17:22Z,"The files were missing from Disc 3 (lady yaowarat)
so you have to convert VOB files into DVD.

sorry for mix-up"
,Jaeng7,2011-06-13T07:13Z,Im afraid the files are bigger..I am using convetxtodvd also and when I insert the dvd to burn i get the message 4.38 GB on disk but required is 5.11GB.the file is 5.11GB on disk 1
