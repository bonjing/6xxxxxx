Light and airy, filmic but intimate, delicately arranged but deceptively powerful, Suck It and See is Arctic Monkeysâ€™ fourth album. Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer and collaborator James Ford, it has a summery pop feel--the sound of some out of season sun for the boys, with most of the work done on the West Coast in January.
