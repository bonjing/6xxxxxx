                           DESCRiPTiON 

 To mark the start of this year's Isle of Man TT, a look at British            
 motorcycling legend John McGuiness, the fastest man on the island with the    
 current lap record and undoubted star of the Honda team. The former brick-    
 layer talks about his bikes, his rivals, his victories and about breaking the 
 130mph barrier.                                                               
                                 Enjoy!
