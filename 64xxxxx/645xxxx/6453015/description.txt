Product Description: 
 

The Maginot Line is the most famous fortification system of World War II, but in fact most European countries were busy building fortified defensive lines from the end of World War I until 1941, when the limitations of the French approach became obvious. In addition to the West European sources and contacts he drew upon for the popular Hitler's Blitzkrieg Campaigns, J.E. Kaufmann has now been able to use previously-unavailable East European archives to provide new material on the Soviet Stalin and Molotov Lines and the Czech Nachod-Ostrava defenses. A truly comprehensive account of all European fortifications of the World War II era is available now for the first time, supplemented by scores of remarkable technical drawings by Polish artist Robert M. Jurga.
