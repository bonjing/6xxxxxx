      times.  It was like that in the source.                                     
                                                                                  
      Summary   
                                                                                  
      The narrative revolves around police officer Amadeus Warnebring, tone-deaf  
      scion of a distinguished musical family, and his attempts to track down a   
      group of six guerilla percussionists whose anarchic public performances are 
      terrorizing the city. The drumming set pieces correspond to an avant-garde  
      score with four hilariously titled movements. Where the short involved the  
      six drummers imaginatively using standard apartment furnishings as their    
      instruments, the feature unleashes them on an unspecified city's civic and  
      cultural institutions. Including an amusing backstory for each of the       
      soberly dressed drummers as well as their nemesis, music-hating             
      investigator Warnebring, the film creates a treat for the eyes and ears     
      from the dull, repetitive sounds of everyday life.
