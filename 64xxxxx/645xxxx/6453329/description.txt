I downloaded these when they first came out in 2009. The gentleman that uploaded these made image files out of the brand new discs. Use a program like Daemon Tools Lite to mount the images onto a virtual drive. You can than use a different program (like Nero) to burn the image files as an exact CD that will play in any CD player.

Listening to these albums in Mono, the way they were originally created was an awesome experience for me. I had never heard ANYTHING in mono at any point in my life up til then. For the first time ever, I finally understood Beatle Mania.

These are an awesome listen and addition to any music collection. Being an exact copy they will play the quicktime video if loaded into Itunes.

FLAC is of course gaining popularity and I have a copy of them stored on my PC. You can mount the images and make your own flac version of the individual songs or album, complete with .CUE files

If you have any questions, please send me a PM or post a comment, and I will do my best to answer it.
Enjoy!!
