I've been producing music since I was 11 (I am now 18) and I am ready to get out there and chase after dreams.
All you dubstep/electronic lovers, please check out my track on Youtube by searching ""Kid Chemical - Genesis"".
Listen while you browse! You wont regret it! (Free download! ;)

Thank you all :)

,DandBfan,2012-04-06T11:57Z,"Hey if you like Skrillex you might also like noDj.
No spam intended because seriously this guy is
pretty good. I dunno how I found him but I really
dig his stuff! He's from Los Angeles too and has a similar style to Skrillex but at the same time its different, Wouldn't waste my time posting this if I didn't think it was worth it, Anyway, Hope you guys can check him out to discover something new.
