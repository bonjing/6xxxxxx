,frednot,2011-06-07T17:24Z,"Whats with the whining? You guys arent old enough to read a subtitle?,Then i guess your not old enough to see the movie. Great upload, thanks. "
,QborT,2011-06-07T19:48Z,Subs are not complete.
,richardpa,2011-06-07T22:22Z,"Here's a link for other English subtitles for this movie (1CD) version...

,Chill90,2011-06-08T02:35Z,Its good vid and all.. Not that i know Japanese but i KNOW its missing some lines all over the movie.. And its pretty annoying in the long run when you dont allways know who's who and where the heck they are going etc.
,the-chojin,2011-06-08T18:25Z,is the  text from the 126 min version  and the film is 141 proper version   
,QborT,2011-06-08T21:17Z,"the-chojin, yes.  It is the subs from the international version re-timed to fit the full length Japanese version.  About 18 minutes of this contains no subs.

And the link that richardpa posted is most likely the exact same subs.  Still missing 18 minutes."
,Gurrah,2011-06-10T15:22Z,"How about this one?
http://www.findsubtitles.com/subtitles/English/Jusan-nin+no+shikaku/1478634
Last comment is at 136 min. So with the closing credits it could be the correct length. Haven't tried it myself yet..."
,kwenb1,2011-06-10T17:08Z,"People complaining it's not dubbed, wow..."
,SijoSilLum,2011-06-11T19:43Z,"Were are the subs? I watched the first 20 min, no subs."
,Ponyoo,2011-07-03T18:49Z,"Seriously....this is an .AVI file.  Can you say .AVI file is Highres?  Why isn't this MKV or mpeg?  

How is quality? Could someone rate it?"
,Mklangelo,2011-07-05T17:44Z,"If you refuse to read subtitles, you're missing a lot of great movies."
,insickness,2011-07-07T18:09Z,"A: 10
V: 10 (hi res)

Subtitles: Excellent, with caveat.

There are some missing subs in certain scenes in this version. That's because the subs in this version were taken directly from a dubbed version of the film which is a shorter edit of the film. 

The missing subs were killing me while watching the movie. So I went and downloaded this dubbed version:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6521303/13.Assassins.2010.DVDRip.ENG.H264-BONE

It is A LOT lower quality, almost unwatchable, in my opinion. So I played the audio of dubbed version along-side the video of this hi res one. The dubbed version is edited out where the subtitles are missing. In other words, the subtitles on this version were taken from a different edit of the move, that's why the subs are missing in some places. So story-wise, you won't lose much at the places where the subs are missing, since those scenes were actually edited out in other versions."
,vinpirate,2011-07-08T10:33Z,ppl who don't read == BLIND!
,2mjolk,2011-07-08T21:36Z,"can anyone point in the direction of good subtitles for this movie?(EXTENDED not the americanized retard version)

,gaaraisgod,2011-07-13T05:24Z,I think I have subs. I haven't checked myself but supposedly they're for the Extended version. lordretsudo's custom subbed full dvd on adc.
,pdarkness85,2011-07-17T02:31Z,"If anyone is interested, FULL EXTENDED EDITION SUBS have been release recently. I have checked them, and they are timed perfectly with this release and works for all extended scenes:
