,ResistNWO,2011-08-19T19:59Z,"nevermind. this is just a link to a website. which asks you to sign up to see the answers, which i did. Im not sure about the accuracy of all the answers, but Ill go ahead, and just make a pdf for all the answers and upload sometime soon."
,loliluv,2011-08-24T02:45Z,"Yep, just a pdf with a link to http://www.meetyourbrain.com/bookChapters.php?book=Stewart-Calculus-Early-Transcendentals-6th-Homework-Solutions

Trying to get access with a GuerillaMail account, but I still haven't gotten the email back to activate my account. It looks pretty sketchy, though -- glanced at chapter 6 and noted there were a lot of sections that had no answers. Not sure if that's because I don't have an account yet or not, but I wouldn't bet on this. If anyone else knows where to find this, let us know here, lol."
