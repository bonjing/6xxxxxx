,kai201,2011-06-12T04:51Z,some one told me the 720p version isn't available.....so this is the best quality well get?
,Xandecs,2011-06-14T19:15Z,"@kai201 Just got back from a festival and still no 720p. So I don't think it will be available. 

Too bad.. but yes, than is this 540p version the best you can get. ;)"
