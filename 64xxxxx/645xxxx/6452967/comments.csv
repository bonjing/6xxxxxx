,redactedwv,2011-06-08T20:29Z,"yeah, notnowplz... FxG has cleverly been uploading top quality seeds for half a decade in order to lull us all into a false sense of security - all because the coming of this Green Lantern cartoon was long foretold, and they're some diabolical, long-term plannin' motherfuckers.

Even now, across the globe, events set in motion by the seeding of this torrent are beginning to topple world governments and throw humanity into a new age of chaos and instability.

A chaos soon to be reigned in, locked down, and ruled by the iron fist of our new FxGian overlords.

Someday, in the dark times to come, fathers will tell their children of the hero who tried to sound the alarm... The one man who dared stand against the darkness... The lone bulwark against the forces of tyranny and oppression... The legend known to the ages only as notnowplz. 

All gave some, but notnowplz gave all. You tried man, you tried....

-------

Anyway.... Thx FxG :). Will seed."

,jonext,2011-06-13T09:25Z,it is an animation movie not the real one but its good quality though...
,muscle555,2011-06-17T02:03Z,"Thanks, FXG_team... your the best!!

This looks to be a well produced animated movie. It is interesting that the animated version is being released so close to the live action movie.

The live action movies comes out June 14 in New Zealand, June 16 in Hong Kong, Thailand, USA, June 16 in Canada, UK and August 31 in Italy.

You can visit IMDB to find out the details:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1133985/ 

The details about Emerald Knights is here:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1683043/

Some reviews seem to indicate that the live action movie acting was not very up beat so the animated Emerald Knights movie might turn out to be better.

Either way... enjoy them both... if they are good, I suggest you try to see them in the theaters so they have money to make some sequels."

,pumper84,2011-06-17T21:22Z,so gay its a fckin cartoon. FXG such a BIG FART
,redactedwv,2011-06-19T04:28Z,"Sincere sympathies on the brain damage problem, pumper84. That's gotta be tough.

----

With the exception of the 'marine drill sergeant' segment (total crap, that one), it was pretty decent, cartoonwise. Worth watching and seeding, if you're at all into GL/GLC."
