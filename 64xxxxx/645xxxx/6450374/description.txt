From the Infowars web site ::

Bilderberger sleuth Jim Tucker of The American Free Press reports on this year's elite confab to be held at the swanky Swiss retreat at St. Moritz, a short distance from Davos where the banksters regularly meet. Tucker, known as "the doyen of Bilderberg hunters," has tracked the group since 1975. He is featured prominently in Alex Jones' film, Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement. 

Alex also talks with economist and columnist Paul Craig Roberts about his latest article posted ondetailing the possibility of war between China and India. Dr. Roberts served as an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan Administration. 

Alex talks with Mike Adams of Natural News about evidence that the deadly e.coli bacterium sweeping Germany was cooked up in a lab.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
