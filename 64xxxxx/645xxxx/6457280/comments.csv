,Charlie117,2011-06-19T07:44Z,"Never mind my last comment, is the Return trailer the Cinematic one? or the mash up from the previous ones shown at E3 11?"
,MAVERICK900,2011-06-19T13:30Z,"The return trailer is the cinematic trailer shown at
e3 2011"
,DarkWeetus,2012-04-02T01:40Z,"Good upload thanks for taking the time. Great quality in both WMV and MOV 10/10.
My only issue is big ""Intro Cinematic"" watermark in the top righthand corner of the Return clip.  I know its not you fault but good to point out for those using the footage to mash up.
Thanks "
