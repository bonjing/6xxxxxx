,blizuntochronic,2011-06-08T21:29Z,"Just copy the 1.01 update (Google it) on a USB stick, and then run it from the install pkg files menu and and the game will work"
,Funkee_Munkee,2011-06-09T02:37Z,"can someone please tell me how to install this, cheers guys"
,oikjgbvguiugfc,2011-06-09T06:27Z,"lol so this legit?
How can this game be 2GB hahaha.
Even 4GB is odd, oh well."
,jeshansson,2011-06-09T08:56Z,What version of the game is this??? is it bles01147??
,stvescot,2011-06-09T11:49Z,Why even waste time asking if it works when the person uploading has a colored skull? ...Welcome to torrenting bits fruit-cakes.
,stvescot,2011-06-09T11:52Z,"Bahaaaha! ""Is this version bles01147?"""
[T],swebarb,2011-06-09T14:51Z,"Rofl i bet if the game came 2001 it would be 4,5gb or so.. broussard even said himself many years ago their internal build was around 8gb or something..."
,hairyshit,2011-06-09T21:30Z,"this is bles01147, works fine on 3.55kmew with multiman 2.00.004, just let multiman patch the .sfo and allow mutiman to download 1.01 update pkg, then install via the .pkg installer from the xmb and start the game from the xmb (I was also puzzled at the small size of the game (around 4.6Gb) but it seems to be the full game)."

Install that and it'll be good to go."
,alexisawesome,2011-06-10T04:51Z,Seeeeeeed
,garry554,2011-06-10T21:16Z,hairyshit is spot on.  Game works with CFW 3.55 and multiman 2.00.04.  However I was worried for a couple minutes when i was loading game off XMB and it was on a black screen for a couple moments.  Game installs fine with update.  Thanks STUN!
,Darckrest,2011-06-13T15:11Z,"Works like a charm! run multiman update first.

3.55 kmeaw, multiman 2.003"
,pqp2005,2011-06-26T22:31Z,"no sound here, there is any fix for that ? ?"
