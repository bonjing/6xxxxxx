So many tutorials for FMC on Youtube. It helped me alot"
,_SnakEye,2011-06-08T19:45Z,"what version the 737NGX is it?
the 1.0 or the 1.01...etc?"
,hunter123456789,2011-06-08T19:53Z,I would also like to know what version this is because the other one on here that was removed plagued me with the mouse cursor lag
,Capt.Jambo,2011-06-08T21:06Z,"Oh yeah! this bird looks great guys! IFly claims they simulate almost everything in the cockpit.

Thanx a lot Cruzu"
,SniperBliss,2011-06-09T00:46Z,"I hope this is version 1.01, as 1.00 mouse lag kills the experience."
,Matty297,2011-06-09T02:54Z,"Please seed 
Thank you =)"
,SkyCapt,2011-06-09T03:08Z,Please Seed!!!!!!
,Lowryderstrain,2011-06-09T03:24Z,"I think Cruzu has no clue how to seed
delete it and seed first"
,PMDGRULZ,2011-06-09T06:05Z,Scared.To seed.He is.....
,clintferns,2011-06-09T06:36Z,which version ??
,Cruzu,2011-06-09T20:56Z,"I just want to share this shit. So keep jacking my torrent anyway. And BTW: I always seed, no doubt."
,PMDGRULZ,2011-06-10T21:07Z,Well to share this shit you need a Higher number that Zero for seeders.Actually zero isn't really a number but hello.How many IFly's came through this house in the Last week.Too many ..None are here.What's the problem.Seedddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.  But only if it's Cracked.
,aarque,2011-06-11T00:41Z,"Too funny. ""I seed always"" except now and any time since this torrent was posted."
,SkyCapt,2011-06-11T00:46Z,"Here you go: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6457680/iFly_Jets__The_737NGX

Works and its craked, version 1.00
Sorry about the seeding. Its a repacked torrent with addition liveries."
,saintamadas,2011-06-11T10:30Z,Now i am confused. Will someone be specific which of all these torrents flying around has the issue of this mouse lag. The info will be highly appreciated. 
,saintamadas,2011-06-11T12:39Z,"Skycapt, your torrent aint seeding. its bad enough that you ve included liveries which is is good but not too helpful at this point. Anyway, seed and keep ur torrent alive rather than leaving us stuck. More grease to your elbows."
,saintamadas,2011-06-12T13:56Z,"Has anyone tested the baby to confirm its functional? Pls, the flight status is highly needed. Thanks!"
,saintamadas,2011-06-12T18:22Z,"just installed. Still plaque with the issue of no landing gears. VC guages are black. I allowed the iFLY 737 dll despite malwarebyte viewing it as a trojan scar to see if its the cause of the blank guages. If these issue is not resolved, i will have to delete as its occupying 2gigs in my drive."
,wab1201,2011-06-12T18:38Z,work so good for me thanks man 
,saintamadas,2011-06-12T21:41Z,"@wab1231, whaz da magic?

,saintamadas,2011-06-13T14:55Z,"@wab1201, just an insight that i need thats the reason these forum exist not some email add dawg. No thanks, i dumped the this torrent's file and used that of Skycapt as i created an exception for FSX now i am flying with liveries not the IFLY default. thanks to SKYCAPT's torrent.
