,kuklei,2011-10-04T03:39Z,"Audio not working on LG LW5500. Not sure why but probably due to the audio encoder used or perhaps the double frame rate 47.952431. Not sure but I guess is the FPS. Anyone has a clue how to fix this, please tell us! Thanks"
,blrfind34,2011-10-25T09:19Z,"I tried on samsung 3d & not able to play this video's too

 a bit research and i find out that the max frame rate for my TV is 8 to 30 fps

Thanks to r3dcat for providing this video. 

How to make it work: ( reduce frame rate to 30 fps)
 -------------------

 1) download HD convertor software, i used

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6168821/WinX_HD_Video_Converter_4.1

 2) after install

 i tried different settings, but the one fastest i could find is to convert to avi using divx format

 click +Add button to add the file downloaded.

 4) choose to hd avi tab

 5) leave default settings, change the following

 videoquality : 8000 kbps ( to keep small file size)
 format: divx
 frame rate: 29.97

 depending on your system cpu, it will take a hour or two

 should work now.

 Enjoy..."
