,plush2,2011-06-11T03:00Z,"Who gives a sh*t if the file is rar'ed or not. I have no idea why they do it, but I certainly prefer an HD rar'ed torrent over an SD unrar'ed one.

Thanks @ uploader."
,Andy_S,2011-06-18T08:51Z,"well then get HD Unrarred one, there is almost everytime one available."
,davidpaquet,2011-06-18T13:55Z,Are you guys really complaining about a rarred torrent that small? It takes a couple of seconds to unrar!
