    Everyone has something to hide                                           
                                                                             
    An attractive woman enlists the help of her two best friends to          
    confront a charming man with a secret background who has pushed her      
    to the breaking point. The women underestimate the consequences when     
    they take matters into their own hands as their opponent forces them     
    into a desperate situation, and everyone pays a price.
