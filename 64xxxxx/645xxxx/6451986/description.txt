Enjoy

DRUM is a group  that releases all kind  of electronic  stuff but  mainstream
We dont  care for any  releaseyear or source...its still all about  the music
In the  beginning of 2002 we began to support the scene with the best of the
best ... our  goal was not  to become  group #1 in scene ... we rather
wanted  to create a strong  community out of music lovers and give our
musictaste to the ppl who still understand the music and its spirit
and after 2 years we're stronger than ever before. The friendship
that we earn keeps us continuing every single day of the year
and it will go on like this. So we wanna say thank you to all the
ppl that helped us over the last 2 years ... siteops, groups and
any kind of sceners. In the  times of  flaming and  arrogance its a
luck to find ppl with the same attitude like we have. We  appreciate
your help and your support in any way. So if  you wanna  join our
small  and welfare community, dont hesitate
to contact us

We dont care for a monthly amount of rips
its still all about the music and friendship

Last but not least a few greets fly

to our friends from
