Tested and works just fine on Windows 7 64Bit (Though not this particular torrent)"

,Epigene,2012-05-21T18:38Z,"Excellent torrent, just follow the installation readme and everything should work fine, even on Win 7."

,Jona198102,2012-06-16T15:50Z,"The .mds file is not meant to be mounted. This is the Media Descriptor file created by Alcohol 120 when the disk was ripped.

Its probably there for a reason..

Mount .mdf files in whatever virtual drive program you use and leave the .mds files alone."
