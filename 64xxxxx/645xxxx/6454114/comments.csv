[H],BigNoise,2011-06-08T12:36Z,adding a 'tracked by demonoid_me.txt' while it is not indexed there looks iffy to me.

[V],bigbluesea,2011-06-09T16:33Z,"This is pure fuckery been downloading since yesterday and still hasn't completed

Stuck at 64% Last time at 12%

WTF! Fix this torrent!"
[T],faren73,2011-06-09T23:02Z,"It should be fairly obvious by this point that the chance of anyone getting 100% of this is somewhere near 0. This is only a carrot dangled in front of your face. This should have been seeded in a few short hours and when you get somewhere in the 90% range the plug will be pulled, that's my guess anyway. nothing wrong with the torrent, it's the uploader"
,OriginalTheOriginal,2011-06-10T09:20Z,"Please uploader, seed it for us! Thank you."
