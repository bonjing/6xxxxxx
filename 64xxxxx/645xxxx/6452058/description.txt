Show Information

Sir David Jason stars in this one-off drama written by Thomas Ellice,
which follows the story of three World War II veterans, Harry (Jason)
and his friends Frank (David Warner) and Albert (Michael Jayston).

Albert's dying wish is to be buried on the little hill outside
Hinderburg in Germany, where he watched the Russians take position
in the closing stages of the Battle for Berlin.

The notion of Harry and Frank transporting his body after his death
is a crazy one, but life is short, friendship precious and, after all,
the trio have known each other for more than half a century.

The plot unfolds as Harry and Frank begin a journey that will change
their lives forever. With Albert's coffin tied to the roof rack of
Harry's black cab, they embark on an adventure to honour their
friend's last wish and create Albert's memorial.

The emotional voyage sees Frank and Harry coming to terms with the
trauma of what happened all those years ago. Both skate on dangerously
thin emotional ice as the events of 1945 continue to haunt them.

Little goes according to plan and, hopelessly lost in Calais, they
pick up German hitchhiker Vicki (Judith Hoersch), who intuitively
learns of the dark secret that has driven a wedge through the heart
of their friendship..
