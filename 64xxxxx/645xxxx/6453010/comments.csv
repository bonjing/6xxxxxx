,QborT,2011-06-08T03:46Z,"Does not contain proper English subs. 

There is currently no English subs for the full Japanese release, the subs are for the international release which is 18 minutes shorter."
,X3MEX,2011-06-08T06:22Z,"thank u so much for this u made my week ...

(can u do Biutiful with no Hardsubs )"
[T],margelaturau,2011-06-08T06:33Z,... I do not know which version you think ...! This sub. is for the duration of this movie! If it's not good looking or other .... buy the movie! :)
,QborT,2011-06-08T21:13Z,"Check for yourself MarGe.  At 35 minutes into the movie there is a scene with Shinroku that was not in the international release, this scene has no subs (about 2 minutes).  

Like I said earlier there is about 18 minutes of the movie that contains no subs because English subs were NOT released with the full length Japanese version.

The subs from the international release were re-timed to fit the full length release, but the additional 18 minutes are without subtitles."
[T],margelaturau,2011-06-09T06:14Z,"QborT:
What can I say rip and upload are made ââby me! Sub. is all I have found now is the time to leave and more! What was up to me, I did!"
,QborT,2011-06-09T17:16Z,"Just trying to help keep downloaders informed.

Some people like to know if subs are complete so they don't waste their bandwidth."
,fcRabies,2011-06-10T01:14Z,"I have to say that Qbort has a point, lots of Samurai sat around clearly planning death and destuction with lots of dialog going on and there are no subs to tell you whats happening. 
I had to stop watching after half an hour coz I wanna know what's going on. 
Many thanks for to the uploader for a A 10/10 copy we just need those extended subs.

,falconss,2011-06-10T08:59Z,"agree with Qbort lots of missing subs. with that said you still get the story.... nothing major.
v 10 
a 10
subs 7 "
,mufuti9,2011-06-10T12:05Z,"Actually, since there is a total of about 18 MINUTES MISSING from the subs, I would consider this major.

There is very little reason to watch the extended cut when you will not be able to understand one single scene that is added from the international version.


Obviously nothing the uploader can do about it, it is either wait for the proper extended english sub or do yourself the favor and watch the international cut if you are not fluent in Japanese."
,Dragon8000,2011-08-15T17:10Z,thanks
,downaccs,2011-08-16T12:35Z,"sub maybe available elsewhere, just try google them."
