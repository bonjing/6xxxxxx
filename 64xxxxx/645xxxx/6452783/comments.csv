,BozzaBow,2011-06-09T21:44Z,"Hey dude, thanks for downloading. What is the host software you are using (after effects cs5?) try reinstalling. If  that doesn't work, try re-downloading the torrent, or going to the red giant website, download the demo version and use the serials on that."
,unersiege,2011-06-11T03:08Z,"thanks for the response, i really appreciate it. I'm running AE CS4. But the problem seems to be with the install, not with running the plugin itself as i haven't got to that point yet. i guess ill try downloading the demo versions and see what happens."
,heyashuhi,2011-06-17T06:17Z,It does not work.
,unersiege,2011-06-17T22:52Z,it worked perfectly for me. Download the entire suite (http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/downloads/trial-versions/registration/trapcode-suite/) and use these serials. Thanks Bozza. my work is looking a lot better in AE.
,heyashuhi,2011-06-22T19:10Z,Hey thanks.. it worked.. you need to download trial version from redgiant and use the serials..
,chelafoto,2011-06-23T15:50Z,"the serial for Starglow isn't working, and that is the one I actually need! help! send me a new serial please?  I downloaded the trials, and all others accepted except Starglow!! "
,EpicBlitz,2011-07-10T16:50Z,"Starglow and 3D Stroke both don't work, but its fine! Thanks for everything else though!"
,RGBeffect,2011-07-23T01:45Z,"Keeps ending up with an install fail.  Can't get the uninstaller to fire up, keeps crashing.  I'm running CS5 and the new Mac OSX Lion.  Not sure that Lion has anything to do with it. Any help would be great."
