The system requirements also mention that a one time internet connection 
via Steam will be required for PC players in order to play the game. 
Gearbox had revealed earlier this year that the PC version of the game 
will use Valve's Steamworks game development tools which will provide 
PC gamers with features like achievements, leaderboards, matchmaking 
for online multiplayer matches and more.
