,Archonin,2011-06-10T17:01Z,"1. This has already been unRAR'ed, for you non-computer-users.
2. The size is correct. This is NOT demo-size, the demo was 1.7GB.
3. The size is smaller due to low texture-res and old engine. Use your effing head.
4. I DL'ed at 5MBps. If you got slow download, it's your own f'ing fault.

,mrhozer,2011-06-11T22:02Z,"Awesome Upload! TANK U!

I had some issues with sound as well, the intro had sound but not in game... and then I realized that I only copied the ""System"" folder from the ""Razor1911"" folder in the dvd iso. After I copied the entire contents of the ""Razor1911"" (LogitechLCD, Maps, MilesRedist, etc.) TO the System folder install location (usually C:\Program Files (x86 if you're on a 64bit windows)\Duke Nukem Forever), accept all the overrides, then the game launch is in the ""System"" folder. After that all the sounds worked perfect.

Also, Thanks ppl for the save game workaround, you can also right click the launcher>options>Compatibility>Privilege Level and check ""Run this program as administrator"" on. This will make sure you don't accidentally launch the game without the ""run as admin"" on, and to possibly play without being able to save.

Thanks for all the feedback! Everything is working for me now, Graphics look and works awesome on my AMD Phenom II, 8GB ram, ATI HD 5500 graphics card machine."
,WHORATIO,2011-06-11T22:34Z,"Game works fine!

For all those having trouble:
1. Install the game by selecting the file inside the DVD drive.
2. Once it is installed open the DVD drive in the ""My Computer section"".
3. Once this screen is open you should see a folder named ""Razor 1911"" open it
4. Inside Razor 1911 you will see a ""System folder"" open it
5.  Copy everything in it
6. After that, make your way to your program files. It will look something like this: C:\Program Files (x86)\Duke Nukem Forever.
7. Once there, open up the system folder.
8. Now paste what you copied in Step 5.
9. Replace every file it brings up.
10. Once that is all done open the Duke nukem application as ADMIN
yay! You are done now!"

Obviously you have reading problems. The instructions tell you to run the game as ADMIN rights and there are 7 pages of comments where people say ""YOU HAVE TO RUN THE GAME WITH ADMIN RIGHTS OR YOU CAN'T SAVE""
