,frogshare,2011-06-16T15:10Z,"Nice rip. But end credits are cut off -- at least the picture, so that the music keeps on running, but the picture is frozen. Some players freeze because of this, especially when skipping to that sequence. Please, for future rips, keep the end credits completely. People still can decide for themselves, in case they want to cut of the credits. Everyone can do it easily with mkvmerge."
,smugglerscat,2011-06-24T07:56Z,"With all due respect, but this rip is total crap. 720P in 700MB for a 2hr movie is a joke. Looks horrible. Pixel party!!!"
,magi123,2011-09-15T12:58Z,"thank you, YIFY."
