I have updated this torrent to include latin Levels 2 & 3 - it is here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6467715

it's the exactly the same as this torrent (plus two more levels) so all you have to do is replace the old torrent with this one, force recheck and pick up downloading where you left off :)"
