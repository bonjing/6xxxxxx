"Tony Eveready and Porsha are cat burglars with a bit of a problem - they can't seem to keep their minds on the job. Every time they break into a house, something comes up and they find themselves immersed in another salacious situation. Tony just can't keep his hands to himself, and he ends up stealing as many hearts as heirlooms. Porsha might be getting a bit frustrated with him but when he turns his amorous attentions to her, she's more than happy to oblige. From fiery one-on-ones to blistering group gropes, these tantalizing thieves make the most of their felonious career paths. And with shapely sirens like Sierra and Cherry Mirage on hand, you'll put this video on your personal 'Most Wanted' list."
