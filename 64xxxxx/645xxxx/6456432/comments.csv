But I have some more movies I wish you would upload. Orson Welles's ""Fountian of Youth"",  Yasujiro Ozu's ""The End of Summer"" and any other film by Ozu, Kenji Mizoguchi, Nicholas Ray, F. W. Murnau or Douglas Sirk.
And thanks for all the other wonderful movies you've given us. :)"

also there is a copy of the beast of the city with Harlow, Huston and Hersholt. I've only been able to download 86%, tried watching it anyway, but it drops off to much. Can you get a copy of that the dialogue I was able to hear is great.

also how about some CLeo Moore, over exposed and this girls confession.

Hate to be greedy, but these old films are so enjoyable.
thanks,"
