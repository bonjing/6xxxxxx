If you use Por or Spa forced you can set in MPC to display them on top of the screen so that won't mess up with the English ones (which are on the bottom).

[T],-Gabe-,2011-06-10T20:34Z,"Best rip quality yet. Not even one doubt. 4 Days of continuing encoding at the highest possible quality is a thing that it ne'er happened for any other.

Cheers and keep your bestest job with other new blu rays (such a The lord of the Rings, I,II,III) "

,Night_89,2011-06-11T10:06Z,"I have downloaded one of your torrents named Resident evil quadrology and I must say it was brilliant
what I am asking now is if you could upload the extended version of resident evil apocalypse
It would be really excellent
thanks anyway for all of your uploads"
,Mimics,2011-06-17T22:27Z,"Gabe has right. 
I do not know if you do requests but it will be just an OUT OF THIS WORLD thing if you will encode and upload LOTR triology from the new BD (becouse it has the full extended edition). The quality of your torrents are much too high to say a simple word like ""great"". 
One more thing, it would be prettier if it will come in 1920x1080 resolution. I think you could do it in (just in case you will say yes to my request)

Thanks for this movie and leave an answer for this request."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-18T09:39Z,"@Mimics
On Tuesday will be uploaded. It takes a long time the encoding using TESA (Motion estimation method) with 64 range etc...see the pic bellow
http://www.bilderkiste.org/show/details/3130838118115/LOTR_%5Bmkvonly%5D_encode_settings.png.html
I do them on 3 pc-s. It will have also French Audio tracks separately and multisubs.
Black bars obviously cropped (1920 x 800 AR:2.40), You don't want apx 700 MB of black bars to download, they are filled back by your player.

One more thing, see the picture bellow the end of First episode(second part)
http://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/2130838197657/the_end.png
 is at 1H 53min 49 sec and credits take 22 more minutes!. I will remove the credits video but upload the DTS credits soundtrack separately. 
The torrent will be about 33 GB (3 GB for French audio demuxed)."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-18T18:08Z,"My LOTR torrent will have these subs; 
Eng (full with Elvish), Chi, Cze, Dan, Dut, Fin, Fre, Heb, Hun, Kor, Nor, Pol, Por BR, Rom, Srp, Spa, Swe

..and French audios separate."
,Mimics,2011-06-19T18:02Z,"I didn't know that part with the black bars. I thought it is no longer a full hd at 1920x800 resolution. Good to know, Expert :)

Yes, I know it has a long long credit but also it is not recomanded to see a black screen just after the movie's end becouse of the soundtracks. They are worthiness and it could be annoying for many fans.
Your torrent would be great. I didn't know the blu ray came with so many subs. 

Thanks again!"
