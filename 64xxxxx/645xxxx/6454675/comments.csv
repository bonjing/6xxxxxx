3: Hit MORE
4: Hit SETTINGS
5: Scroll down to AVAIBLE MAPS
6: Download the part you are missing 

DONE"
,JackieDan,2011-06-14T20:21Z,"I downloaded and installed successfully, one issue though. Each time I start the navigation, it says that ""The GPS-signal is missing. The navigation will start automaticly as soon as the reception is sufficiently strong"". 

I have been to different places and it seems not to work. Does anyone have the same problems? Can this be solved? 

My device is an: Samsung Galaxy S2"

,JOEHERLEV,2011-06-18T10:03Z,"- on first startup a short data connection (ca. 25kB) is required to register your product.

After you should be able to use this APP 100% without using data connection :)"
,JackieDan,2011-06-18T14:22Z,"OK, I found a solution to the ""Demo problem"".
Turn off the GPS, and turn it on again. Always turn it on before you launch the application."
,JackieDan,2011-06-18T18:58Z,"Galaxy S2 users, Read this:
There's a confusing point with the GPS. When you turn it on, the GPS symbol on the top will start ""Blinking"", this means that it tries to identify your position so let it load. The symbol should not blink when it's done. After that, run the navigation and it should work. "
,Azzur,2011-06-22T10:27Z,"always nice when these uploads comes... thanks alot
I had navigon 2.6.1 on my htc desire hd before, but after the upgrade to 2.3.x it stoped working. Then I found this : )
But my question is.... I have all the maps for the old version... why can't it use them? It still wants to download. The issue is that I want to still have my poi that I have saved, and this looks like it does a new install.. instead of on top of the old one. Does anyone know how to do for it to use my old settings?"
,bad ass,2011-06-22T16:07Z,"Where to put the APK file before clicking it to begin the install...  Where on the phone?  Sd-card, og phone memory, and at what path??  have a samsung galaxy 2"
,torrentorist,2011-06-22T17:34Z,"What if the application is not purchased, can't the navigon track the user while downloading the maps?"
,sheaky,2011-06-24T01:25Z,"is it possible to the download data (2GB) from any other place rather from downloading this app? its slow and halted everytime i download , any solution?"

This is what the program says ""processen com.navigon.navigator_checkout_eu40 för programmet navigon stoppades oväntat ? I have to try the 2.6.1 instead."
,re1850,2011-08-08T11:40Z,Are you able to use Navigon Fresh to update this after you have a working installation on your phone? This works perfect on my LG Optimus 2x....and I would like to update to latest release...3.6.2....
,greececheeze,2012-06-13T12:06Z,"Is there any way to get to the settings? Or is it missing for some reason? Or ks just me, and if some knlws is it possible to update it via navigon fresh?
