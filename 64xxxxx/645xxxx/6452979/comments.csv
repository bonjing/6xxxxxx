,army111,2011-07-09T23:29Z,"Great album. I tried adding all the tracks to my Zune media player playlist but its only adding tracks 1, 6 and 9. It will play all files through zune if i click the file directly though. The software version is 4.7.1404, so up to date. I tried restarting my computer but had no luck. Any ideas?"
