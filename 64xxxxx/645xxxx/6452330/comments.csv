,ady4321,2011-06-11T20:37Z,"First of all, why have you associated this with what seems like ""Quicken"" ?!?!? I downloaded Quicken and it wasn't very straight forward AT ALL. So if you want to fuck around on this one and waste some time, download it. FUCK knows how you got a green skull."
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-06-11T21:31Z,"@ady4321 I am sorry, but I don understand what you mean?

""""Quicken"" ?!?!?"" 

Try again :)"
,lodgeij,2011-06-11T23:53Z,"What do you open this with ? .srt comes back with nothing the format is mpeg-4 according to the listing but neither mp4 or mpeg works, was a nice waste of bandwidth"
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-06-12T00:36Z,"Aha I see it missing the.mp4 in the end

Make it to look like this: Just.Go.With.It.2011.720p.BRRip.x264.AAC.-Zen_Bud.mp4

It plays fine in vlc and mpc.

Good luck :)"
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-06-12T00:43Z,"And this is the Swedish subtitle (.srt):

Just.Go.With.It.2011.720p.BRRip.x264.AAC.-Zen_Bud.srt

,khurrambajwa,2011-07-07T16:03Z,Thank you Zen_Bud for the explanation that we need to add .mp4 at the end of the name. Can you not change the original name on the torrent?
