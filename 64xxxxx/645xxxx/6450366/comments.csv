,ajmalsaab,2011-07-19T16:09Z,"movie plays fine, but the audio is dubbed in Russian...not even dual audio :( the 'English' language tag is a lie."
,ajmalsaab,2011-07-19T16:14Z,"Also, it barely runs to 90 minutes, whereas onlines reviewers indicate a running time of 2 hours and 35 minutes...!?"
,ajmalsaab,2011-07-20T21:33Z,"yep...it only has the first 6 scenes, and it is missing 3 more. incomplete film."
