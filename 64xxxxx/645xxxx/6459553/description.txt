BBC The Sky at Night 2011 Cygnus the Swan HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

The summer constellation of Cygnus will soon be flying overhead in our night sky. With its rich array of nebulae and star clusters, it is a delight for astronomers to look at in the warm summer evenings. Sir Patrick Moore looks at the yellow star Albireo with its superb azure blue companion, whilst Chris North goes in search of the Milky Way.
