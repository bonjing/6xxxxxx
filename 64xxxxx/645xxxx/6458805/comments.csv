,mancbhoy,2011-06-15T18:40Z,"this torrent is BS, download rate 0.3 upload rate 77,
im only DL episode 2 and ive got a 3 year ETA 
this is not sharing  specaily when i,ve uploaded 1.74 GiB there is better rome torrents out there cos this is shit"
,DarthPS3,2011-06-15T20:07Z,"Hey, mancbhoy....go fuck yourself and die. This dumbfuck uploaded a whole 1.74 gb and lost patience. Seriously dude, fuck off. Everyone else, the torrent should be finished uploading today, up time was five days. 
Also, if there are any requests as to what I should up next from the list, now is the time, otherwise I'm going with Kingdom of Heaven."
,DarthPS3,2011-06-15T20:22Z,"Also, you can't find this anywhere else, that's the point. This is for people who want it on their PS3."
,Gnimm,2011-06-16T20:08Z,"I just wanted to offer a sincere kudos to you for uploading this.  

I'm about 1/5 of the way done with it. 

Tell me, how do I transfer these files to my PS3 once it is done.  Will they all copy via a media server or do I need something else.

I'm assuming they play natively.

Thanks again."
,DarthPS3,2011-06-16T20:18Z,"The point of these files is to avoid streaming them using a media server. Just pop them unto a hard drive, (They have been properly sized to fit on fat32) and they will play directly on the PS3. I have already finished a full seed of this, but because my connection is limited to upping at about 100kb/s I will continue to seed for another week or so at about half that. To those that have received the full file, PLEASE HELP SEED! 
Thanks for the appreciation, it makes it worth it :)"
,DarthPS3,2011-06-16T20:20Z,"I didn't quite answer your question. Yes, you could use a media center to do a wireless copy of the files unto your PS3 as well. "
,Gnimm,2011-06-16T21:11Z,"Actually, it was me who failed to give you enough information.

Allow me to elaborate.  

I have a nice, spacious hard drive on my PS3 already which will easily accommodate 45 GB.  Since Rome is my favorite show of all time, this is a no brainer. 

What I was wondering is how I need to transfer these.

Say for example I fire up PS3 media server.  Do I need to transfer just the MTS file (I'm assuming that's the episode itself) to my PS3, or do I need all the smaller files on the hard drive?

It's fine either way.  I've watched this show through its entire run about 8 times, and I still put in on every single night to relive the greatest moments.  A magnificent piece of television, and I'm glad you found it worthwhile to upload it."
,DarthPS3,2011-06-16T21:47Z,"I'll be honest with you, I've never tried doing it without all the additional files, but I will hazard a guess and say that they are necessary. Once you put the episode on the PS3, either through your media server (Which I'm not sure if you know but takes muuuuch longer than using an external hard drive), or through an external hard drive, you will find the episode in the stream folder. 
Like you said though, uploading this one was a no-brainer. Any from the list above that you'd be interested in seeing first? 
As for me, I'm just happy to be doing my part. Long live the pirates, after all. "
,Gnimm,2011-06-16T22:25Z,"I'm sure any of those would be met with praise, and look gorgeous.

People would likely prefer the TV series over the movies, since they're more difficult to find in HD.

However, those take much longer.

I don't think there's a wrong choice.  Just pick the one you like the best.  You're doing us a huge favor."
,Gnimm,2011-06-17T10:07Z,"I don't know if this information is particularly valuable, since it's just speculation on my part.  Forgive my ignorance if I'm totally wrong.

Based on the folders this torrent produces, I find it somewhat unlikely that the MTS video file (which the PS3 does read) is dependent upon the other files.

Here's my reasoning.  There are 9 files for each episode, one of which is obviously the one that plays.  However, they're located in different folders.  

Now, if these files were inseparable, I would assume the software in the PS3 would also have to discern what's in which folder.  From what I gather, the PS3 has its own video folder that is required to store a file in to play natively.

Therefore, if the MTS file plays natively, it's unlikely that it needs the other files, unless I'm just completely misunderstanding how the PS3 reads files.

Second, the other folder names are ""backup"", clipinfo"", and ""playlist"", none of which sound essential to playing back the file.

The most compelling evidence of all is how small the other files are.  If they were video, they'd be bigger.  If they were audio, they'd be bigger.  

These files probably work to make a burnable Blu-Ray that will display the episode guide and other features of the disc.  However, I am skeptical as to whether they are essential for the MTS files to run.  I could be wrong though.

I'll tell you right away once these finish downloading.  Man I love this series."
,Gnimm,2011-06-17T18:43Z,"I've downloaded 65% and have been getting great speed through most of it, but now it seems to have slowed to a crawl.  Not sure why, still has the same seeders. "
,DarthPS3,2011-06-17T19:49Z,"The reason I say it might be necessary is that the file contains certificates that 'trick' the PS3. So, it could work, let me know, I'd be curious to hear. As for the speed on this file, like I said, I already upped it once fully, but no one else seeded it, sooo, its going to be 2-3 days before I re-seed this one, apologies, but I have a few things I'm getting and its taking up my speed, but I will re-seed! "
,DarthPS3,2011-06-17T20:17Z,"I seem to be having terrible luck with this one, no one wants to help seed, I assume its because its such a large file. "
,Gnimm,2011-06-17T20:28Z,"It's okay, just do it when you can.  Your upload is much appreciated!"
,Gnimm,2011-06-18T21:36Z,"I have confirmed that the MTS files will play natively on the PS3 without any assistance from the other files.

And the series looks AMAZING.  Thank you again.

Everyone seed this, it's so awesome!"
,Gnimm,2011-06-21T04:30Z,"Can you please reseed for just a couple more nights?

I'm at 73% of these files, and I'd love to have the rest of them.
"
,DarthPS3,2011-06-21T06:55Z,"It will definitely be re-uploaded, but it will take 3-5 days, but I'm not going anywhere, definitely plan to seed this long term."
,Argael,2011-06-23T07:19Z,"I've been looking for a good quality copy of Rome which I could watch on my PS3, and here you are. I am very grateful to you for this upload. It doesn't matter how long it takes. I'm sure it's worth the wait.
If you could upload Battlestar Galactica next, it would be great. But that would be another huuuge file, so maybe uploading each season separately would be a good idea."
,DarthPS3,2011-06-25T07:33Z,"Doubling my speed on this within the next month, thanks to those who've been patient, 
@Argael, glad the torrent is being made use of, and as soon as my speed increases I will be uploading the BSG Complete. "

,Gnimm,2011-06-30T05:58Z,"Hey, I just finished downloading these, and I hate to be a killjoy.

But you forgot the first season finale, episode 12."
,Gnimm,2011-06-30T06:26Z,"But in any case, thank you once again.  These look incredible."
,DarthPS3,2011-06-30T06:28Z,"I just checked the original file, and yeah, it isn't in there, give me a day or two and I'll add the file in another torrent. Apologies though! Hope its working well though otherwise. "
