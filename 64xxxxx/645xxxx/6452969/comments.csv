,themorningstar69,2011-06-09T19:47Z,"HolyRoses, I was just wondering if you were planning on releasing a HD m4v version of the new blu-ray transfers of The Lords of the Rings Extended Editions.  I was just wondering since they have started to pop up today.  More often than not I will try converting myself and after a lot of trouble you will end up posting the same movie (Like Unknown) and I wished I had just waited.  Thanks in advance HR, Hope things are well."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-06-10T04:00Z,"yes, but those CHD ones don't have subs."
,themorningstar69,2011-06-10T06:51Z,"CHD? Subs aren't really a big concern for me, except for non-english portions of movies I guess.  Thanks for getting back on that so quick, and I will look forward to those uploads.  And as usual, appreciate your efforts. (-:"
