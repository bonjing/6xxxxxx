Product Description: 
This volume explores the theory and practice of flight dynamics. It sets the relevant equations for the general case of a spherical rotating Earth, which is then evaluated by examination of the flat, fixed Earth. All equations are designed to solve practical difficulties the author met during his teaching activities, which were often the source of errors and wasted time.
