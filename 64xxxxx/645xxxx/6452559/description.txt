BOOK INFO:

This authoritative text aims to reveal the truth behind the mystery of the hieroglyphs and the ancient civilization that created them. Egyptologist Aidan Dodson traces the origins and development of hieroglyphic writing, and explores the varied theories that scholars have expounded in their attempts to explain this curious pictorial script. From the earliest known marks on pottery to contemporary examples, the reader is taken on a journey that brings to life the ancient Egyptian world of kings and queens, religious and cultural ceremony, and domestic and political life. Information on how to read hieroglyphs is also included. Illustrated with photographs of ancient sites and texts, as well as prints and engravings of the signs and inscriptions, this book offers insights into the lives and language of the ancient Egyptians.
