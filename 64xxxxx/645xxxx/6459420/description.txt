In Italian with yellow English subtitles on

This is a new conversion from a brand new VHS tape copy of the original movie
which we found on ebay, nd had transferred onto DVD by a so-called local
professional lab that provided a nice enough offering for us here I suppose.
They only cost $28 to do the conversion to DVD format within a couple of hours
notice.


We got a fully 720 X 480 picture at 1005k bitrate and with 160k audio too


This movie shouldnt have disappeared from the shelves as it describes a difficult
situation in what is a lax attitude towards false shows of macho like bravado in 
that is simply cowardly abuse in violence towards women - the best of the women of 
Italy in fact! (A lovely blonde truest Irish spirit of a fragile spirit).


Some things you can teach, and there are some you can only bring about through forceful deterrence in the environment. In any event the right public message on this is always a key place to begin.


As a fellow compatriot of the greatest peoples of Italy I can only say that we
know we are are made to die for our mothers and fathers and children - (we
have greatest idealism here)why not for our wives too - and maybe even more than
any other concern we could live for - when such Christianly beauty is involved
above all! It is a trust from God that we care for greatly Maegherita Buy! 
Capiche paisan! Grazie and god bless!
