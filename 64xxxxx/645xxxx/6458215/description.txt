This is just to see how much potential for PS3 converted stuff there is. If you guys like it, let me know and I'll try to convert more stuff. I own a PS3 too and I'm sick and tired of stuff not working on my PS3. That's why I convert it and for just a little more effort I'm willing to share it with you.

Don't expect a "release" a day though, I have other things to do too and this is by far not my hobby.
