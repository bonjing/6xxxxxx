I believe that Jazz Me Blues, The jazz Band Ball, Royal Garden Blues, Sorry  and Old Man River are done by Arturo Sandoval.  I haven't listened to the complete list yet, but I downloaded a bunch of Bix a couple of years back and I remember getting a few tracks of Arturo in them.  He's a great horn player and he does play a lot like Bix.  Anyway, great upload."
