,killersushi,2011-06-09T11:35Z,"Out already? Not supposed to come out until end of June. Suprises me time and time again how people get their hands on this stuff so early.

Got the bluray preordered but I guess it can't hurt to have a peak :)"
,maggot_corpse,2011-06-09T12:18Z,"the same situation with Paul, which is due in august (acc. to blu-ray.com), but yesterday we got a genuine rip and it's just amazing."
,hacker7890,2011-06-09T12:48Z,Paul officially in the UK on Monday. Fiiiinally one film we get before the US! However it's nice to get hold of it a few days early

,ShadowXcz,2011-06-09T13:09Z,Nice fucking try. 500 seeds already? On a 44GB big file? Good job.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-09T15:23Z,"Great stuff. Are the non-English bits hardsubbed, or do we need to find matching subs?

For anyone wondering: This is real."

,Keegen,2011-06-09T19:47Z,So i should expect a 1080p version soon?
,xidio,2011-06-09T22:38Z,The quality looks ASS
,killersushi,2011-06-10T18:52Z,"Quality is great actually. Brilliant image. Can't get the sound to work on my PS3 though. After converting with mkv2vob no matter what I do (DTS, Always Transcode DTS, PCM instead of AC3), either the movie doesn't play at all or the audio is messed up.

So if you you're in a simliar situation, might wanna save yourself the download."
,sad4life,2011-06-11T00:20Z,"Do you know how many years we waited for this? A big Thank you goes where it's due.
I hope 1080 is coming before I finish downloading this ;P"
,Gavan24,2011-06-11T09:08Z,Thanks for the great upload.  Anybody know where to get subs for these?
,Gavan24,2011-06-11T09:15Z,"More specific, in english :)"
[V],meech,2011-06-13T12:38Z,"killersushi:
Have you tried ps3mediaserver.  I haven't finished downloading this yet, but I've never had anything that ps3mediaserver couldn't stream to my t.v. via the ps3.  I assume your trying to play it on the ps3 natively.  But why go through the trouble of converting, etc., when ps3mediaserver can play it as-is."
,cannibalvegetarian,2011-06-13T15:28Z,"The screen caps don't really give the impression of high quality. Looks alright, but not what's expected.

The file sizes are pretty inconsistent as well. 15.2G for 228 minutes, 13.1G for 234 minutes and 15.6G for 262 minutes? More worryingly these are cinemascope movies, thusly the need for bitrate is lower than that of full widescreen. The 1080p version could run at this bitrate. 

Someone's been either lazy or credit whoring, or both. Proper this shit."
,cannibalvegetarian,2011-06-13T15:39Z,"Sorry, may have been a bit harsh. I see there's another mysterious audiotrack in the Fellowship of the Ring. Still, around 50G for the 1080p should be enough."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-14T21:02Z,"Subtitles for non-English parts:

,moshster,2011-06-16T12:05Z,"Agree PS3 Media Server is a must have for PS3 owners that want to stream HD movies.

@cannibalvegetarian

Bitrate/filesize depends on the actual content being encoded, not running time.  Four hours of mostly low motion would yield a very small file in actuality.  The more I frames there are the more data is to be stored."
,deathfest,2011-06-16T13:42Z,"@cannibalvegetarian

Moshter is perfectly correct. Maintain the same bitrate at 1080p, and you'll end up with even bigger files. "
,Valtieri,2011-06-16T21:38Z,"omg, just 10kbps...

3 years ETA"
,JeffMiller1984,2011-06-17T15:47Z,Anyone else having a problem downloading Fellowship? I've downloaded it twice and just get an empty folder.
,tiktianc,2011-06-18T00:32Z,"@deathfest
well seeing as there are other torrents for the non-extended version at 1080p with high bitrates on the tpb at ~13Gb, I really don't think it's asking too much for atleas a full 720p @ under 20GB."
,maggot_corpse,2011-06-18T13:29Z,thanks to those who made that happen. finally
,cannibalvegetarian,2011-06-20T14:10Z,"@moshtar: In encoding there are far more variables than simply one frame type to define compression, but I agree material is all the point. That's kind of my point actually, cinemascope doesn't require as much bitrate as full frame widescreen. This is a straight up scene encode with very little thought put into it. With a little wizardry, this can be stuffed into a sensible size."
,karakorama,2011-06-22T02:24Z,Many many thanks!!!
,Dolldude,2011-06-30T10:33Z,Guys seed please.
,qball359,2011-07-31T09:46Z,"This may be a large download, but the video and audio quality is great.

Only thing needed in addition to the download is the Elvish subtitles which another user has already posted in the comments.

Slower connection on my end saw it taking close to a month on and off to complete but was well worth it."
,o_cyanide_o,2011-08-02T12:03Z,"@GoodFilms
Do those subs sync well? Because i heard that for this version the old extended's subs are out of sync."
,cannibalvegetarian,2011-08-14T15:56Z,deathfest: No. Bitrate is the rate of bits. Resolution has no link to filesize.
,F3n1xoftheaxe,2011-09-02T09:21Z,Missing Fellowship but A/V is fine on the others
,southak,2011-10-22T10:13Z,3-4 hours per film...what a waste of life. Can anyone post the link to the 1080p dts original theatrical films? I cant find at all.
,southak,2011-10-22T10:17Z,Sorry I meant 1080p theatrical with DTS sound. AAC is garbage. 
,lesalrd,2011-12-15T21:12Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6472333 here is the link to 1080p but the seed is veeery bad...good luck with it, I've been downloading it for 1 week and 2 days and it's on 18.5%
Hoping this one is seeded well :-/"
,Syrianeagle,2012-01-10T22:06Z,why am i being limited to only 10 kbps ?
,MCooper86,2012-04-01T13:53Z,Thank you!
,Coldblackice,2012-04-15T15:09Z,"Does anyone know what font is used for the retail's hardcoded subs? I'm in the process of making a tutorial on how to encode your own hardcoded subs into this release (for Elvish/English parts), but I also want to show how to style the subs so that they appear with the pretty font/lettering from the movies.

Anyone know what fonts are used? Anyone have any screenshots of the fonts from the retail versions?"
,GoldEagle76,2012-04-22T20:11Z,"Thanks man, I really appreciate it."
,teh-cheeseman,2012-04-28T13:27Z,"Don't download it, buy it. If there were three movies not to download, it is this series. So much effort and time has gone into these that it is just cheap not buying it. It is worth every cent buying it. I would not usually be one to say things like this but after watching all of the special features on the series, so much dedication has gone into it.

If any movie deserves your money it is the Lord Of the Rings Series, BUY IT"
,PauloFran,2012-04-29T18:46Z,"Excellent video quality.
Thank you very much!"
