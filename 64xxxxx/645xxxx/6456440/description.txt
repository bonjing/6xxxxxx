    Two silvertip sharks must be flown 6,000 miles from        
    Australia to Dubai for a breeding programme, but the      
    animals are extremely hard to keep alive in confined     
    spaces. Specialist animal movers construct a water tank   
    and reinforce the aircraft to keep them alive en route,    
    but the journey remains very dangerous as any delay in    
    the 30-hour trip could mean the oxygen inside the tank   
    runs out.
