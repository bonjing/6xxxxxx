My e-book reader can't handle DJVU. Converters exist but those tend to generate enormous files.

There's a 800 MB PDF available on TPB. I have a PDF complete with Instructor's Solution Manual at ~330 MB (good quality and bookmarked) but I am reluctant to post it coz I am not ready to upload 1.5~2.0 GB a day to keep it alive. There's this established fact in the torrent world that anything above 100~120 MB receives poor seeding."
