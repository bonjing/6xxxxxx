After nearly ten years of our existence, we are more than proud to present    
our first full lenght album "Berghall Vortex". Since our                      
                                                                              
first EP "The Aiionwatha" (Antiscarp 2004) we have been touring around and    
releasing tracks on various compilations, but now, the                        
                                                                              
debut is here!                                                                
It contains 8 tracks composed during years 2009-2011. It is a combination of  
many different styles, a humoristic ironically serious                        
                                                                              
journey thru time and space to the berghalian vortex and beyond. We had       
shitloads of good time and fun while creating it, and you                     
                                                                              
can hear and feel it too! Anyway, one album speaks more than million words,   
so let's cut the crap and go get yours!
