[V],IndexTrance,2011-06-07T16:56Z,"Nope, no more hardwell .. Have thought about it for a while to stop preview it .. It really doesn't bring anything new to the table for me .. I have a couple of dupstep shows that's maybe gonna start to go to the radiopodium so maybe there it will be some new genre/tunes .. . )"
