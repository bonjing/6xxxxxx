,jdinh071,2011-06-29T02:45Z,"hey can u tell me how to get full version cuz i couldn't . you said copy the AngryBirdsRio.exe from the crack folder and paste it in the folder where i have installed the game but when i clicked it, it said failed to open.
please tell me man because i love this game."
,CarlesNeo,2011-06-29T05:08Z,"@jdinh071 - try to re-install the angry birds rio 
                  and then open the angrybirdsrio.exe in the directory where you have installed the game. If it works then copy the crack and paste it ! And if it works start the game , there will be written on the menu ""get full version"" click on it. It will ask you for a key.
Type random numbers without dashes (fill the whole box of activation key with numbers )

IF IT DONT WORKS REPLY ME AGAIN 

THANK YOU FOR SHARING OUR PROBLEM AND DOWNLOADING MY TORRENT !
