,MrOsborn,2012-01-17T05:07Z,"It sounds like a good cam but the video is what you'd expect from an MKV (IE. good). Thanks for the uppage, dude.

I generally like Gruffudd and Roxburgh but from the first few minutes I get the feeling this movie might suck multiple kinds of arse."
,forty2,2012-02-09T10:38Z,really good video result for a 650MB. Acting needs work.
,Dig1taL,2012-05-24T00:42Z,"Good quality video, but the subtitles have a lot, and I mean a lot, of mistakes. They're also pretty big and distracting.

Video a solid 9/10.
Audio more like 7/10, but you get used to it."
