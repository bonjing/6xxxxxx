Personally I probably won't dl it though, because I'm a little picky and like at least TS, but good job anyway bro! Keep em comin!!"
,mrkalium,2011-06-11T08:10Z,"watchable but barely
Movie sucks "
,iwatchmovies4,2011-06-11T08:44Z,"i saw this in the theatre tonight and it was amazing. i have a feeling, with the majority of the movie taking place in dark settings, that a cam isn't going to do it justice whatsoever. i'm gonna DL it just to experience the movie again without paying 12 more dollars!"
,RIcan25,2011-06-11T15:05Z,Watchable...seen better but its worth the cost..LOL...Thanks
,dilly58,2011-06-11T17:16Z,"Cam is tilted and off center, zoomed in, right side of picture missing Seats visible.

Otherwise, I've seen much worse. Watchable. The price is right.  :)  Great movie.

Decent encode all things considered - nice work froggie100.

Hopefully we'll get a TS soon."
,billnie,2011-06-11T18:50Z,wut is this movie about is there a monster? alien? what tell me
,billyboy999,2011-06-11T19:21Z,"@mrkalium...STFU .Its so bloody annoying to be told ""the movie sux"" on here...If you want to review the film go to imdb or s'thing."
,mvcomputers,2011-06-11T19:55Z,I applaud the effort but iphones or what ever piece of crap camera this guy used is simply not suitable for cams. If you are going to do it then do it right!
,Shitpoop,2011-06-11T22:55Z,"Just attempted to watch this at a Regal theater. 15 minutes before the end, the bulb broke in the projector, and we were told if we wanted to see the ending, we would have to watch the first hour and a half again.

THIS IS WHY I PIRATE SHIT. FUCK YOU."
,Shitpoop,2011-06-12T00:27Z,"You didn't film the fucking credits? YOU DIDN'T FILM THE FUCKING CREDITS OF A JJ ABRAMS MOVIE? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

Abrams ALWAYS has clips at the end/during the credits. FUCK YOU.

Also, the movie was decent, fuck the haters. Cloverfield was absolutely ten times better (honestly, everything by Abrams was better than this), but this was still okay."
,asmith85,2011-06-12T02:44Z,"Didn't even try to watch it.  I understand that cam releases are not going to be good quality, but if you have to be all sneaky and afraid to the point where you cut off the screen and have seats in the picture then you may as well leave it to the big boys that can do it right."
,pinzmoo,2011-06-12T04:08Z,"I normally dont complain, but this is horrible for video."
,Djcole,2011-06-12T04:08Z,wow a spielburg movie that sucked
,Djcole,2011-06-12T04:09Z,no even the dark parts of the movie were watchable. it's a good cam but the movie is not
,Djcole,2011-06-12T04:13Z,"asmith85. how many times have you risked your
freedom to tape in a movie theater.
if you don't like it go pay $11 to see the movie
and not complain about a bad cam copy."
,Djcole,2011-06-12T04:16Z,"Shitpoop????
well you picked the right name for yourself.
because your attitude is Shitpoop  Shitpoop"
,Djcole,2011-06-12T05:34Z,"no i did'nt miss read his comment.. the end credits are not on the video. it cuts off just as it says jj abrams. so he was complaining.
but thanks for misunderstanding"
,Djcole,2011-06-12T05:36Z,"A 7 V 6 completely watchable.
thanks froggie100"
,girl_this,2011-06-12T08:00Z,Thank u for the download...Movie was just fine...U R awsome....any chance u can get Bridesmaids please...Keep up the excellent work of entertaining us on a daily basis!!!!
,MrMacntsh,2011-06-12T15:25Z,"Very watchable.  The beginning is pretty tilted and off-center, but towards the middle it straightens out.  
A little dark but you can make everything out.

,Bonez0088,2011-06-13T02:59Z,Just a awful cam not watchable at all

,sayanshaka,2011-06-13T08:43Z,"@ Shitpoop,

I've been using tpb since mininova turned to shit and never bothered writing a single comment even tho... i felt like it many times. However i thought i'd let you know that: trying to make a cam, one would tend to leave right at the end and be safe, as opposed to stay alone like a morron with the lights on just to get credits for rude kids like you... nah?"
,sayanshaka,2011-06-13T08:45Z,-r ; )
,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-06-13T18:32Z,Thanks for the upload. I noticed my head being cocked to the right watching the beginning but it does straighten out near the middle. 
,saequa253,2011-06-13T19:22Z,needs a fucking password what a waste of time
,LarryInColumbus,2011-06-13T20:15Z,"@saequa253 - NO! there is no password needed you dildo!

The cam is low quality but nothing is missing (except credits bfd).  The cam is all over the place, tilted, autofocus going in and out, at times the seats take up the bottom third of the screen.

If you are picky you may want to skip this one but if not, like I said, you won't miss anything.

,Frice,2011-06-13T21:04Z,"Awful quality.

Watchable if your a cheap bastard like me.

J.J. Abrams + Spielberg FTW"
,roonz,2011-06-14T19:03Z,"Movie is shit, but watchable"
,kevhast,2011-06-14T21:02Z,"Pretty bad quality even for a cam, cropped and sometimes tilted. End credits are cut off (there is an extra clip during that you'll miss).

I don't recommend downloading this if you've never seen it before (go to the big screen, it's good!), but I saw it at the cinema and it was nice to watch again even in poor quality."
,mulukku1,2011-06-17T06:55Z,"Yes, this is free but the quality suck really big dicks."
