BOOK INFO:

The Wiley Encyclopedia of Chemical Biology is an authoritative new work whose goal is to illuminate the crucial role of chemistry and chemical techniques in the life sciences. The encyclopedia will adopt an inclusive editorial approach, encompassing fundamental and blue-sky science as well as those areas of research that have more immediate medical or commercial applications. The scope and structure of the work will reflect the multidimensional character of chemical biology, focusing in particular on the fundamental science of biological structures and systems, the use of chemical and biological techniques to elucidate that science, and the applications of this knowledge in areas as diverse as drug discovery, sensor technology, and catalysis.
Major topics areas covered in the encyclopedia:

Chemical Views of Biology
Biomolecules within the Cell
Chemistry of Biological Processes and Systems
Chemical Biology of Cellular Compartments
Synthetic Molecules as Tools for Chemical Biology
Technologies and Techniques in Chemical Biology
Applications of Chemical Biology
 

Wiley Encyclopedia of Chemical Biology (WECB) is the only major reference resource devoted to the cross-disciplinary field of chemical biology. WECB is a first port of call for academic researchers and advanced students looking for timely and authoritative review-type information in this field. The articles in WECB, contributed by world-class authors, are designed to

illuminate the crucial role of chemistry and chemical techniques in the life sciences
support the information needs of researchers in the field of chemical biology
provide relevant and readily accessible information to upper-level students and to scientists in adjacent disciplines
WECB is an evolving online database of information, combining the most useful features of traditional reference works and review journals in a compelling format designed to exploit the full potential of the online medium. Extensive linking to the primary literature and to other online resources further enhances the value of the encyclopedia as a gateway to the broader scientific literature.
