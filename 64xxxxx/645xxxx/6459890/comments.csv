Much of our knowledge is based on how good teachers we had in school, especially the younger years. I have seen that many peoples is put of further studies, because we tend to think that we are not studying for our own sake, but because the society demands it. Then in our later years we try to catch up again. I am certain that knowledge should be free.

I have put in a request for you dohduhdah on math tutor physics 3 vol 1-2 and math tutor chemistry 1-2.

I find these DVD-lectures very good, although these apparently missing, are the ones i need most. Figure! Lectures on specially chemistry and electronics seems to be very rare.

Otherwise any suggestions where to find any sorts of lectures on chemistry and electronics?"

[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-11T15:20Z,I'll add physics 3 en chemistry soon (got some other requests in the pipeline).
