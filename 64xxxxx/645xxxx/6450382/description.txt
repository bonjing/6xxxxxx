Cashflow 101 E-game is the pc game version of the popular financial education board game, Cashflow 101. To those of you who are unfamiliar with who Robert Kiyosaki is, he is the author of the best-selling book: Rich Dad, Poor Dad. 

The objective of Cashflow 101 E-game is to get out of the rat race and into the fast track to achieve your dream, that is, to achieve financial freedom. As a person who has never played the real Cashflow board game before, I find the digital/software version pretty interesting and quite addictive. 

At first impression, the e-game was amazing in graphics but needs more improvements in the background music and game options.

202 is a little better ..... but good all round learning tool!

Enjoy
