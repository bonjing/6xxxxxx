I would up more (and more) there than on this hostile place which offer no decency to VIP uploaders, allowing all possible lunatics to say whatever they want and whenever they feel ""an urge"".

Frapper formed Search Group ""20-40"" on first page there, so past complaints about ""hard to find your torrents"" become obsolete."
,MajinOLesedi,2011-06-07T18:11Z,"Thanks 4 Movie awards. Could I request ""Teen Wolf"" series, its HOT."
,jotalopes,2011-06-07T18:23Z,Thanks again for United States of Tara.

@20-40
I signed up for the other site, but despite its faults, PB is simpler. Let us know if you are stopping your uploads on PB so we know where to look for them."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-07T21:32Z,"@longdistance: Thanks, regarding sceneunderground.org it cannot be simpler now - go there and on main page click on ""20-40"". "

,funpigj,2011-06-08T04:35Z,"Other site is closed for registration.  

Will you be upping TV there or movies?  I'm really not interested in movies, just TV."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-08T07:40Z,"I would send Invitation as reply to e-mail (address is in many torrent descriptions). 


Anyone who want it, should put TPB screen-name in ""Subject"" line of that message, for example ""funpigj: Invite me, please"".

Only requirement is that I know you (by good)."
