,tkshyam,2011-06-10T05:47Z,some files are 675 mb and all... are they full length movies? why are they so big for a short??
,xadoph,2011-06-10T06:07Z,"The bigger files are usually a bit longer. Not all shorts were created of equal length. The 675 MB one is about half an hour.

These are quite big, because they've been encoded with high fidelity codecs (i.e. H264 MPEG4 at 720x496, AC3 192kbps). This reduces quality loss, as some shorts have quite bustling scenes. Different tools were used for different clips, sometimes with different settings."
