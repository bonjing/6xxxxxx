Do you know - Are they going to do the Majin Buu Saga?"
,RThsA,2011-06-17T10:15Z,"No Buu saga, they didn't do it in Japan."
,Dr_Science,2011-06-17T13:24Z,"That's kinda a bummer...considering how the Cell Saga ends.  Not the way I would like the show to wrap up.  But that's OK.

oh and thanks for the great uploads"
