Product Description:

Servlets and JavaServer Pages dramatically simplify the creation of dynamic Web pages and Web-enabled applications. With Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE), these tools have come of age, earning the support of an unprecedented range of Web and application servers on every major operating system. This book is a comprehensive guide for every experienced developer who wants to master the new versions of these powerful tools. Start by mastering servlet syntax, installation and setup fundamentals and the servlet life cycle. Use cookies and session tracking, optimize browsers, compress pages to slash download time, and decrease overhead with persistent HTTP sessions. Next, master every key JavaServer Pages 1.1 technique you'll need: expressions, declarations, and scriptlets; controlling the format of the servlet that results from the page; incorporating reusable JavaBeans; sharing Beans among pages; dynamically including other files; defining your own JSP tag libraries, and combining servlets and JSP in a single application. Part III offers the industry's most in-depth, practical coverage of using applets and HTTP tunneling as servlet front ends, using JDBC and connection pooling, and HTML forms.
