,LiLP12,2011-06-10T17:00Z,"I can't get this to work! Please tell me how. I downloaded it, unpacked it and put it in the application folder. And when i try to launch it, nothing happens.. Do i need wines or ?"
,Aypolo,2011-06-10T18:06Z,"LiLP12:
Does it open in the dock then quit?
This is going to sound very very stupid, but open it multiple times until initializes. 
(the actual pc game is not very stable, so the mac is even more so)"
,LiLP12,2011-06-10T20:01Z,"Yes that is what it does i try what you requested, if it doesn't work i keep using bootcamp. :)"
,Aypolo,2011-06-10T22:10Z,"sorry it's not working for you, I have no idea why. "
,jimmyjamesbob,2011-06-11T06:04Z,do what LiLP12 said. mine kept crashing then i tried again and it just worked. dont know why but at least it works
,Aypolo,2011-06-11T18:01Z,"I found that it's like that for a LOT of pc--> mac app/game ports. Especially bioshock 1 and 2. 
Glad it's working for you"
