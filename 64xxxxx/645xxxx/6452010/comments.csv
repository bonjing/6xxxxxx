What do I do next exactly? 
Are both files needed ?
Do they contain a boot loader and a payload ?
I've wasted 3 discs already - they are not seen as being bootable."

,sackese,2011-09-14T21:01Z,Where is the tool itself?
,VulcanTourist,2011-12-21T09:10Z,"The title is correct, and not the description: this does NOT contain the actual utility.  It ONLY contains a recovery CD, as the title indicates.  The recovery CD serves no alignment purpose at all."
,kleiderei,2011-12-27T08:57Z,"agree with VulcanTourist. Useless download...pfft, how do you ""crack"" a plain .iso anyway LOL"
