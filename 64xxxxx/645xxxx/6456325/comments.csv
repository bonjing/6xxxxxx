,mickflynny,2011-06-27T17:08Z,"Hi momamedienta I download this great film, i was stuck on 87%, for a day untill you came back to seed, it is fully download now, i shall seed as long as possible, to boost this great film up,so that others get a chance.
The only dislike in this film is the ending with no words ect, its not importants just wondering if there was more to the film.
momamedienta do you have THE ROSE starring Bette Midler? Anyway thanks momamedienta keep it going"
