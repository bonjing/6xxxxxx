,oregonak,2011-06-07T15:13Z,"Wow, Thanks a lot!

I've been having problems getting majority of my 3D downloads to play through the PS3.

I've converted every-which-way possible only to end up with stuttery streams.

I will report back and confirm if this is ps3 compatible or not.

Thanks again!"
[V],r3dcat,2011-06-07T15:48Z,@oregonak I am a PS3 owner also but unfortunately the PS3 does not support/play .mkv files and the only homebrew media player on the PS3 Showtime currently has an issue rendering 1080p video https://www.lonelycoder.com/redmine/boards/15/topics/746 . I also found that with my LG 3D TV SBS files that I could play with Showtime on my PS3 did not render correctly. They played fine in 2D SBS but when I switched to 3D SBS the image was badly out of alignment and not watchable. Your other alternative is to stream to your PS3 using a media server or convert the file. I just found it was easier to play files direct through my 3D TV.

,heshanh,2011-09-05T16:43Z,"does not work on Samsung LED 3D.
i usually rename the .mkv to .avi so the TV can pick it up. the Lion King 3D works perfectly but this comes up as invalid codec"

,blrfind34,2011-10-25T09:01Z,"
I tried on samsung 3d plasma, I am not able to play this video's too.

a bit research and i find out that the max frame rate for my TV is 8 to 30 fps

Thanks to r3dcat for providing this video. 
he used Frame Rate: 47.952431


How to make it work: ( reduce frame rate to 30 fps)
-------------------

1) download HD convertor software, i used

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6168821/WinX_HD_Video_Converter_4.1

2) after install

i tried different settings, but the one fastest i could find is to convert to avi using divx format

click +Add button to add the file downloaded.

4) choose to hd avi tab

5) leave default settings, change the following

videoquality : 8000 kbps ( to keep small file size)
format: divx
frame rate: 29.97

depending on your system cpu, it will take a hour or two

Now try , should work as for me. 

Enjoy..."

,mekakkar,2011-10-28T14:54Z,"Sorry i meant LG

Dint work on my LG 3d LED

Codec problem"
,blrfind34,2011-10-30T02:48Z," i think the tv displays ""codec error message"" if it can not play the movie for no matter what reason. 
even if it can not play due to 49 fps.

find out from your your tv manual which format it can play and at what fps

then use the above method to convert it to that format and it will play."
,blrfind34,2011-10-30T02:55Z,"do not worry about LG or samsung  brand names,  deep down all latest tv's are more or less use similar technology. 

just like we all are humans irrespective of our different names, race, religion etc."
,AnamikaMogha,2011-11-03T05:26Z,Video codec not supported. Is there any way to delete the codec? Will it crash the file?
,minder_sas,2011-12-01T14:16Z,"I use MKV2AC3 audio remuxer very fast.quicker than re n coding the full file.also removes dts-hd file,works well with my lg 3d smart tv via harddrive.software is free,and can be downloaded from here:-http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3#usercomments"
,Shah_Jahan,2011-12-31T08:12Z,"The audio and video quality are great! And the 3D effects were just wonderful. And with its small size of less than 2GBs, this one is a great download!

And since this had a framerate of 47.952431, the video appeared smoother than the 24FPS videos.

@ r3dcat: How did you encode it @48fps? Was the source 48FPS or did you frame interpolate it to double the FPS?

Thanks for uploading. And I hope to see more of your 3D releases, and hopefully now in 60FPS for an ultra-smooth and fluid playback!"

,Maiki100,2012-01-25T21:20Z,"@r3dcat : Thanks first of all for your efford!!! Although the movie looks perfect on my new philips TV the sound, sounds like cracking noice... 
The TV supports HE-AAC, AC3, MP3 and PCM audio encoding... 
Is there any conversion I could do.. to watch it and hear it as well???
I have watched successfully other 3d movies in SBS format... (Half SBS can mess-up the sound?? I guess not...)"
,howyeman,2012-01-27T21:39Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
