In this indispensable DVD, Danny Gill takes an in-depth look at the seven major scale modes. Learn scale patterns, licks and solos for the ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian and locrian modes and understand how they relate to each other.

You will also learn how to recognize and create your own modal progressions and solos. In the DVD, each solo idea is played in context with a full high quality backing track and then demonstrated slowly.

Danny Gill also details the theory of the modes and teaches how you can use them in common playing situations from blues to jazz to metal and everything in between.
