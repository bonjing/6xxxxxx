,jaskelling,2011-06-07T01:50Z,Downloaded & installed. Verified real. It will update your iTunes library which takes some time depending on how big your library is.
,Rapier_Wit,2011-06-07T11:12Z,"downloaded, installed & running with no issues. Thanks."
,nIckKyD,2011-06-07T23:37Z,"got an error -50, shall i just try re downloading and installing again?"
,goodluck4287,2011-06-08T07:34Z,"Now I can't install iTunes 10.3 because the .itl created from this iTunes torrent's library is newer.

I have a time machine backup with an old version of iTunes, but I have made a bunch of changes to the library since my last time machine backup.

Anyone know how to install 10.3 over this without using time machine?"

,cameronmalek,2011-06-09T17:22Z,"Hold off on the iTunes 10.5 upgrade if you want to use iOS's wireless iTunes sync. However if you're using Lion, you may want this since it's the only version of iTunes floating around right now that takes advantage of the fullscreen capability.

@goodluck4287: To downgrade to 10.3.1 again, just go to the iTunes folder and delete the .itl file! Make a backup of your Library.xml file (iTunes > File > Library > Export LibraryâŚ), first, just in case so you can import that if something goes wrong."
,Booi3ie,2011-06-10T08:05Z,"Verified Real... iTunes installed without a problem, thank you iMZDL"

,iphonezapper,2011-07-14T13:14Z,"It installs perfectly, but when I open it up, it bounced twice and disappears... help?"
