It opens and the menu at the top works fine, but the actual window doesnt load images properly, it acts as if its buffering and doesn't fully load. I tried to reinstall photoshop, but that did not fix the problem. Is there anything I can do to make it work properly? my email is mariyanovitski@yahoo.com Thank you!"
