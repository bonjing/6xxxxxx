And no, not because it's dubbed. The audio is actually out of sync."
,PiraatBae,2012-03-11T10:27Z,"The audio is NOT out of sync.  And by ""dubbed"" you should be clear that you mean ADR and not what is traditionally termed ""dubbed.""

It is true that the words don't match the lip movements 100% of the time, but this is indeed due to the ADR.  If the audio were actually out of sync, the sound effects and musical cues would also be affected, which they are not.

If you are experiencing out of sync effects and cues, then it is your player or software."
