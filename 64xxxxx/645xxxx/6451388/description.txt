Lyrics --

[Bruno Mars - Chorus]

This one's for you and me
Living now our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I want to see is a sky full of lightets, a sky full of lighters

[Eminem]

[Bruno Mars - Chorus]

Living now our dreams
We are right where we should be

With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I want to see is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

This one's for you and me
Living now our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I want to see is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
