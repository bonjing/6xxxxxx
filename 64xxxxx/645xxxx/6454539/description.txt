Summary: Key ARM reference
Rating: 5

This is an architectural reference; it covers the instruction set, exceptions, etc. For that purpose, this is the best book I believe. 

This is not the technical reference manual; it will not cover the ICE, instruction timings of a given implementation (say, the ARM7TDMI), coprocessors that might be present, etc. For that, the TRM for a part is best; the TRM will in turn not cover architectural issues, such as the instruction set. 

It also is a bit dated, not covering the newer Cortex chips (i.e. Thumb2). 


Summary: Excellent Product, Excellent Service.
Rating: 5

This is the introductory text that I am using for ARM. Although makes it a bit more difficult to start with such a Reference because often lose "Big Picture" saves buying simpler introductions that can usually be found on internet. 

Excellent condition. Quick service.



Summary: Great Reference, but way to general and out of date
Rating: 2

THis was one of the more expensive books I bought for info on the ARM architectures, but I'm disappointed, the book covers just the core ARM architecture and is a few years out of date now too. Its a tough book to write, no doubt, there are so many variations on ARM that its unrealistic to expect them all to be coevered, but I'd like to have seen some more specifics. Most ARM imlementations by the multiple vendors ot there put in a bunch of peripherals, I'd like to have seen some attemtp to address those features better. 

If you wanted a detailed ARM core reference, it might be the book for you, but bear in mind it doesn;t addres the newer products...

I you plan , or are already developing for arm , than this book is a must have on the bookshelf !



Summary: Clear, competent, well organized.

This is a completely adequate reference for the basic ARM architecture, including the Thumb instruction set. 

This is a reference book, not an instruction manual - you'll probably be happiest with this book if you already know at least one or two other assembly languages. Given that background, you might like the ARM ISP. It's a very regular RISC. The Thumb subset is even more stripped-down, but lets you pack parts of you code almost twice as densely as usual. 

If you've gotten this far, you already know that there are dozens of ARM implementations, with different add-ons and special features. This, of course, can't handle your special circumstance. Still, it's my favortie presentation of the core ARM instruction set.
