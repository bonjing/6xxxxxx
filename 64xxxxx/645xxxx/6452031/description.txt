BOOK INFO:

Faced with the theories of scientists and philosophers, perhaps most famously Charles Darwin's, late-Victorian theologians were preoccupied with the reconciliation of Christian teaching with their contemporaries' ideas. First published in 1894, this text forms part of a series introducing key areas of Christian theology for the modern audience. Dr James Iverach examines theories of the origins of both the universe and of life within it, finding in intelligence, morality, faith and ethics a unifying and clarifying force that he argues reveals the presence of God's creative process in the history of the universe. Nothing, he claims, occurs by chance, and natural selection simply expresses that the sum total of causes, both internal and external, results in the state in which only the forms of life now observable should exist. This text provides an insight into the late-Victorian philosophy of Christian Darwinism.
