ErES - Group Information

Here at ErES we consider each member as more than just a collegue or a
friend, but as a family member. It's been just over two and a half
years since ErES was established and in that time in the scene we've
produced many quality releases because of our attitude not only as a
group -- but as individuals each member of the group has shown
respect and friendship and in return offers loyalty that could only be
found when part of a tight-knit family. We are not a release
machine and never intend to be. We have a relaxed, yet hard-working
attitude towards producing releases and you can see this through all
of our current (and future) releases.

If you feel ErES is a family that you want to be part of
we have listed below the currently open positions and things we
require:

Experienced reversers for all Operating Systems
Skilled coders
Quality suppliers
Good 100Mbit EU & Asia Sites to affil with
Anything else you think we might like
