Hi dear ThorntonWilde...

You have an outstanding collection of films! Thank you for sharing them with us. I daily check your listing and I'm amazed what kind of treasure you have. 

I an looking since  long time or a very nice movie: Catch a Falling Star (TV 2000) 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175245/ 

Sydney Clarke is a spoiled famous actress who is shooting a film when she suddenly gets angry and storms off. She wakes up in the middle of nowhere and gets a ride to a small New England town. There she meets and develops a friendship with Joyce, a waitress at a bowling alley. There she meets Ben, a steel mill owner, and later when she goes to get a job in that small town, she meets Ben again. Sydney becomes a nurse at the mill. All the men adore her. There they have many great times together, and Sydney realizes how important real friends are

maybe you get across this or you have your way to find it.
This would be great and highly appreciated - maybe some one else also looking fort this.

with best regards,
Rudi
