,Pope_,2011-08-13T02:44Z,"Sorry for the intermittent seeding. also had some complaints about this being one massive fucking .rar

my first torrent so there are some issues for sure.

if enough people ask nicely i will post the entire 20 gig folder uncompressed. i at first thought that a .rar would be preferable to save a bit of download time, but apparently this was flawed thinking.

feel free to share your thoughts"
,jimseed,2012-04-17T21:52Z,Could you pretty please share - if you would like to upload the unrar'd version that would be awesome - I will help you seed it - please?  I used to have this file but my hard drive corrupted and I really miss it you know?
