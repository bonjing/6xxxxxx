,jujux9,2011-07-13T19:42Z,"Funcionou!! 
Esse arquivo alÃ©m de pequeno, funciona perfeitamente!!

Primeiramente, desative a internet, o firewall e o antivirus para nÃ£o dar nada errado!

Instale o arquivo SEM descompactar! Siga os passos da instalaÃ§Ã£o normalmente.. colocando o product key qd for pedido.

Quando acabar a instalaÃ§Ã£o, abra o programa e aparecerÃ¡ uma msg de ativaÃ§Ã£o do produto ou usa-lo por 30 dias. clique em ""active"" e aparecerÃ¡ q a senha colocada na instalaÃ§Ã£o estÃ¡ errada. Feche a tela e clique novamente em ""active"". Agora vc colocarÃ¡ a nova senha.

AÃ­ que vem o pulo do gato! AparecerÃ¡ uns locais para serem preenchidos na caixa do autocad. Clique no arquivo ""x-force"". Cole o ""request code"" que estÃ¡ escrito nessa mesa tela do autcocad. Clique em GENERATE e aparecerÃ¡ uma sequencia de letras e numeros. Escreva-os nas caixinhas. 

AtenÃ§Ã£o: se aparecer a msg perguntando se vc Ã© o admin, clique com o direito do mouse no link ""x-force"" e clique em ""run as a admin"".

,Naoh_97,2011-07-24T09:11Z,any fixes for the key generator? if not im just going to delete it i guess
,jhenwin17,2011-07-24T16:04Z,is this a trial version .somebody knows how to activate. so that i can use it forever.
,Naoh_97,2011-07-24T23:51Z,"essentially yes, you are downloading the same thing as they have on the autodesk site but also what is supposed to be a keygen, however the keygen spits out a code that is too short. i guess it has worked for some people, however many including myself cannot get it to produce a keygen that autocad will not accept to upgrade from the trial. Iv stopped seeding and will be leaving a neg feedback if someone doesnt have a fix."
,Dauntless05,2011-07-25T07:33Z,"I was having the same issue as everyone here with the activation part.  At first I completely missed the step where you have to copy the Request Code and paste it in the request field.  After I started to do that, I had the same issue, but I noticed that ""Paste Authentification here"" was at the end of the Request Code.  Once I finally deleted the ""Paste Authentification here"", i generated the code and, poof, it worked.

So my suggestion is to look for the ""Paste Authentification here"" in the Request Code field and delete it.

Hope this works!"
,Naoh_97,2011-07-25T09:10Z,"Dauntless05 thank you so much, i cant believe i missed the part about pasting the request code from the autocad activation screen into the key gen after patching. great instructions gatorpup, i guess i just fail at reading..lol reseeding and rated, thanks guys!"

Thanks a bunch! ;) 
,Marv70,2011-09-10T19:27Z,"I installed AutoCAD 2012 on both a 32 bit and a 64 bit computer and here is my experience. The 64 bit took one tenth of the time it took for the 32 bit machine.
1. If the AutoCAD file is on a disc â€“ copy it to a file on your hard disc. It will not install from a disc. With your internet connected, double click on AutoCAD_2012_English_Win_32bit.exe and install it. This may take some time â€“ it took me all of 21 minutes for the file copying part of the installation. Accept the License Agreement and click Next

2. Select ""I already have an activation key from Autodesk"" tab during the first screen of activating. And put in the Serial number: 400 45454545 â€“there will be a small check mark in green next to the numbers and Product key: 001D1 And the same green check mark. Click Next. 
3. Next is Install > Configure Installation. Choose what you want and click Install. This part of the installation took me all of one hour and twenty-six minutes.

4. Deactivate any antivirus autoprotect and firewall until you restart your computer after â€“ the keygen may give a false positive for virus. Open the xforce keygen and select ""mempatch"" as soon as you enter the next page of activation where you are provided with a request code. The page will read â€œPlease Activate Your Productâ€. Remain connected to the internet. The mempatch must display ""successfully patched"". Click on â€œActivateâ€.
5. Click on â€œI have read the Autodesk Privacy Policy, etc.â€ and click on â€œContinueâ€. It will give you a: 
Product: 	AutoCAD 2012
Serial Number: 	400-45454545
Product Key: 	001D1
Request code: 	JNJ0 ARWQ D7C9 3CXH K5CL C256 CD72 FEPZ (this is for example)
Copy the request code provided into the ""authentication code"" box of the keygen. And click generate.
6. Type down the obtained code of the keygen in the activation code boxes of the Autodesk window. Dont worry because the code obtained is always 7 digits short. And that is the correct one. 2K96RV8KKUUZ9QD79AEUT6XJPHJGHVX2R8C8H3QND8YXPGYUUCPPDKEPZ (for example you will generate your own number)
7. Click on ""Activate"" and then you are done!!!.
8. You will see â€œCongratulations, etc. You are done.

But if you do you do not get any request code unless you want to contact the company and get one by e-mail, wich is a very bad idea.

So the only way is to disconnect AFTER you see the request code.

But now probems appear.
I put in the request code and hit mempatch and then this message came up:

""You can only apply patch when license screen appears or already patched?""

But screen IS up! The keygenerator dont notice that. 
But OK i tried to hit the ""generate"" directly instead.

And yes, the digits are 7 short. But I did as explained above and then hit ok anyway. 

The box that came up said ""error"" So something is wrong but i cant figure out what. (windows 7 x64)

I had retried a copple of times, the mempatch still cant detect the license window and you cant use the generator directly.

Those of you who get it to work, did you do as told above or did you foud out your own way to make it work??"

,Codeplayer,2012-03-22T08:01Z,"Using Windows 7, it crashes while opening any DXF.
When I open DXF by doubleclicking the dxf- file, I get to see the contents before the crash, When I use the file-open dialog from program menu, it crashes instantly."
,Codeplayer,2012-03-22T08:05Z,"Sorry, was bad DXF file. Everything works excellent. It even works with VBA enabler downloaded from Autodesk site. But I would reccomend using VB.NET instead the 32-bit VBA, which slows down even saving your document."

MEM Patch, then paste request authetication key, then generate and paste under activation code.

,yamahar62000,2012-03-30T15:43Z,Hi there...hey guys...AutoCAD 2013 just came out...does anybody has it yet?....
,tinito77777,2012-03-30T21:16Z,"zarpa, cuando salga ""I cant get debug, Are u administer? tienes que darle al boton derecho del raton sobre el keygen y decir ""ejecutar como administrador"" y ya te funciona!!"
,QwyItStrm,2012-03-31T04:35Z,"if you get the ""can not get debug privilege! are you admin?"" message, right click on the xforce program. go to properties, compatibility, and check use program as admin at bottom of window. now the keygen program should work. i still had a problem with the key that it generated though. it gave me a key that was several digits short. when i got to the autodesk page where you enter the key, i noticed that there was a request code provided at the top of the page. instead of clicking mem patch and then pasting that number in the request code line. i used the code on the autodesk screen, clicked next and it worked. hope this helps"
,m0derN,2012-04-02T17:14Z,for those who have problem with patching... the problem is that you don't have rights to patch some files so you need to get access to hidden administrator --- > http://www.petri.co.il/enable-the-windows-7-administrator-account.htm this should help ;)
,hetspook666,2012-04-22T14:10Z,"the crack works, you do get a keylogger mss on you're virusscan but it works :)

you have to run the crack wile booting autocad"
,Troop464,2012-04-27T06:49Z,Works...thanks bro!
,OverheadCrayon,2012-05-08T04:35Z,Y'all have to be careful with these because Autodesk can see every registered version of their software. Not that they look all the time but if a product key used too many times it will send them a flag. Just saying to be careful.I recommend just downloading the 30 day trial to an external. At the end of the 30 days just uninstall then reinstalling it. I had to do it for a year till I could afford my own license. Doesn't work exactly that easy but if you know anything about computers you can figure it out.
