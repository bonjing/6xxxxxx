@reedakay, come on man the movie was released in the cinemas a couple of weeks ago. Who on this planet would have a dvd version of it.

You are better googleing the release date and looking for it then."

,BinkyDeath,2011-10-17T18:52Z,"This is a good quality .avi file and shows the whole movie right from the start to the end of the credits (unlike others that chop the beginning or end off the file). No skipping or other play problems and didn't need any special codecs to play.
Nothing dodgey is included in the torrent files so it's all good. Thanks very much to the uploader! :)"
