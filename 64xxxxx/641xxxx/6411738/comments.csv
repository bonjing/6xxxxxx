,M00KEY1,2011-05-22T00:52Z,"You don't need any files except the video file, and you don't want trackers either just run a virus scan to delete tracking cookies. I just get the video file it downloads faster.  "
,random-arrow,2011-05-22T00:53Z,SEED DAMNIT!! F*king leechers...
,M00KEY1,2011-05-22T00:56Z,Imagine is fake shit so stop uploading it. i just opened this torrent and it has a whole bunch of shit in it. Not to mention it says POTC4 but the file is only 9mb.. don't fall for this goober.. 
,ianpark01,2011-05-22T02:35Z,lol the 9.23 mb file is the sample doh!
,jjf3,2011-05-22T02:45Z,OK I don't know why people are saying this is fake. If you actually open the torrent you see the 9 MB file is the sample file. This is the real deal and best copy I've seen so far. I give the video a 6 or 5 especially in darker parts. You can wait for a better copy but this is good enough. Very watchable

I gave up trying to watch after a few minutes. Most of the time it's like watching a black cat playing in a coal cellar."
