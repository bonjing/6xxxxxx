,tazzmania1990,2011-05-23T08:32Z,"i dont see anything wrong with RARs. just as easy as anything else, you just have to right click it once and press extract  -_-"
,kingoflight,2011-05-23T13:48Z,"Personally i don't get why people rar these, the file size is the same as the unrar'd one so it's not a issue of space... even though when you unpack the rar you then have the unpacked file and the rar files making it twice the size...

Anyway maybe someone will point this out to me why it's beneficial but i can't see it.

It really makes no difference what one i get it just so happens scenebalance is first most weeks so i click the magnet link and then sleep :D
