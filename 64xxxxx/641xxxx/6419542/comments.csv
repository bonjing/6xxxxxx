,GodzEnemy,2011-05-24T21:18Z,Does this work?? And im new how do i seed?
,elturbo9077,2011-05-24T21:23Z,"@Chris-Aksel

totally agree with u not a race track but u help by giving more download places  like somepeople come here to download some to stun and some go to extremezone that is packed with leechers and seeding is slow "
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-24T21:37Z,"@GodzEnemy
When you finish your download in bittorrent client , then just dont close it , it will start seeding the game automatically.

@elturbo9077
I know ppl who download only from one person , like clients only from ""extremezone"" or ""stun""  , etc.. And if you look throught torrent comments , you can find a lot of ppl say' that they just waited when first or second ppl makes that upload."

Thanks for your support and enjoy :)"
,elturbo9077,2011-05-25T00:05Z,"@ Chris-Aksel

yeah i agree i like downloading from u stun and extremezone  and rlf rls becuase you are the best uploaders and i like the autodesk uploads u make well i notice that some uploads u make some comments say that u don't seed and u respond Always wait 10 - 30 minutes before seeders will appear like the witcher torrent i always download a  torrent from u but i don;t always comment becuase u a cool and trusted person and all torrents work only noobs have problems installing "

,patrolkid,2011-05-25T10:34Z,thx Chris-Aksel lets see what this game can do
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-05-25T10:45Z,"@leezaal40 Always block pirated games with a firewall. Comodo is a great choice free quality AV and a great firewall.

@jaswalker24 Probably a missing DLL, either run the game with a debugger or install vcredist 2005, 2008 and 2010, just choose the correct cpu architecture (32/64)"
,hahalolfailmupp,2011-05-25T10:46Z,"Re-read your comment, this is not a steam game, go away troll."

,dawdler,2011-05-25T16:09Z,"@hahalolfailmupp
He's not trolling. The error is quite common for cracked games (I think it's SKIDROW cracks that do this, but could be more).

Now, which debugger would you suggest? :)"
,cboarcas,2011-05-25T16:30Z,"The description is pretty clear, and the torrent has a .nfo file to. 

1. Mount or burn image                                              

2. Install (use 11111-11111-11111-11111-11111 as serial) 

3. Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation

4. Play the game  

5. Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy!

At step 3. I had the antivirus disabled...copyed the files into the game directory....added paul.dll and skidrow.dll to exception in my antivirus the re-enebled the antivirus. and played the game ! Sure hope that now you get the picture !"
,GodzEnemy,2011-05-25T16:52Z,Cant find the skidrow files
,lordnaul,2011-05-25T17:04Z,i just get black screen after launch no matter what crack i use. I'm on windows 7 X64 ultimate if that means anything. no dll's blocked have made exception's in av program and have turned off av program to be sure on more than one try.have latest nvidia drivers.

,xlmnt,2011-05-29T21:26Z,"Fix for ""game will not start issue"":

1) Go to Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Services
2) Set Windows Update Service to Automatic; Background Intelligent Transfer Service: Automatic
3) Download 32/64 bits Windows Live Sign-In Assistant (wllogin_64/32.msi)
4) Install it, it creates a new service called Windows Live service Sign-In assistant that needs to be set on Automatic too.
5) Launch the game, enjoy.
