Of course. Remember, most of the movies released are not 16:9 format, aka 1920x1080 1.78:1 ratio.

The ratio of this movie is 2.4:1, or 1920x800. Divide 1920 by 800 and you get 2.4. If you want full vertical 1080 in this movie, then the resolution would have to be 2592x1080, which is a ratio of 2.4:1.

I see people complaining all the time about the 800 pixel vertical resolution in movie rips. If you don't like the 800 vertical resolution, then complain to the Advanced Television Systems Committee.

Heb je programma's als SubSync en MKVmerge al geprobeerd? En via welk medium speel je de films af?"
