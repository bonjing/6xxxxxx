,suncoast,2011-05-21T04:53Z,"this is my first torrent.

i am trying to seed this but status bar is red.

any ideas?"
,suncoast,2011-05-21T05:02Z,all good now..
,The_Pharoah,2011-05-21T10:25Z,Still get 'No input file' error. 
,Thyx747,2011-05-21T14:32Z,Torrent is BROKEN. Can you fix the problem please ? 
,FS_Junkie,2011-05-21T19:48Z,Upload appreciated suncoast ;-) ... but still no go ... either as regular torrent link or magnet ..
,ofb,2011-05-21T23:46Z,"damn...just bought ths..hey thyx and pharoah you need to click (Magnet link)...then the download page will open, it will appear blank but just click ok and the file will start downloading in your bittorrent"
,ofb,2011-05-21T23:52Z,"Same to you Junkie..magnet link page appears empty but just click ok and torrent should start...I just tested it, works...let me know guys and if you still have problems I'll upload my copy."
,useless_leacher,2011-05-22T04:42Z,"Hey thanks suncoast,

I won't bother making anything for FSX again.  Thanks for stealing.  Hope you enjoy the scenery."
,ofb,2011-05-22T06:16Z,"Sure you will useless...most of the fsx software is waaay overpriced..so what if a few guys with small pocketbooks share it, you're still making money...I know this because I bought my copy"
,ofb,2011-05-22T06:22Z,"by the way useless...suncoast didnt steal it, he uploaded it, which means he bought his copy...so right here alone you sold 2 copies...his and mine, I was going to upload mine but didnt have to. Nice scenery by the way...cost my $35 though, quite a bit considering I got the whole bloody game for $60"
,FS_Junkie,2011-05-22T08:12Z,@ofb ... thanks for that ... working now :-) ... first time I tried it I just didn't wait long enough ;-)
,grfam,2011-05-23T02:12Z,"doesn't work :( i cannot download the torrent file, also the magnet link does't work :("
,useless_leacher,2011-05-23T11:17Z,"@ofb  ... because you have clearly never made anything in your life:  2 sales at $30 doesn't justify 18 months work, so thanks for your purchase, but I'll get a job at Macdonalds instead of making anything else for you guys to steal.   Having never made a thing in your life I wouldn't expect you to have a clue, or a conscience.

Despite what you tell yourself, this is theft.  My time stolen.  How much is 18 months of your life worth?  I'll give you $60 and see if you like it."

,grfam,2011-05-24T23:41Z,"ok, the magnet link works just fine, thanx for this! :)"
,ofb,2011-05-25T00:26Z,"Useless..I do understand but the amount of people sharing your scenery is a drop in the bucket..like I said I bought mine, but think about it, $30 for one scenery..if a person bought every airport or plane available for FSX, it would run into the $1000s. I'll tell you who else makes fantastic sceneries but doen't get all worked up about it like you. Carenado...I bought several of his planes but I emailed him about one that didn't work properly (corruption maybe?) Anyway, I got an email from him saying sorry you're having problems..so here...this is on me...the email contained 2 free planes. I hope you continue making scenery , you do great work, I'll request you do Toronto Pearson and I'll buy it. I'm guessing you wont stop making them because, be honest, like the freeware boys, you must enjoy doing it at least a little bit."
,ofb,2011-05-25T00:30Z,"By the way useless..money is not a big thing with me, I've spent most of mine on family and friends, so in regards to your comment of me never making anything, I wish I had your talent or someone would teach me how to do it, because I love FSX, and I would gladly make planes and scenery and I'd give them away as freeware in a heartbeat."
,ofb,2011-05-25T00:35Z,"finally useless, if you think I'm lying about paying for your scenery, post your email, and I'll forward you a copy of my order and receipt from PC Aviator."
,udidwht,2011-05-25T19:25Z,"@ useless

Hate to tell you this but anything that one creates for FSX (any game) is a hobby. No matter how you slice it. Regardless of whether you get paid or not you KNOWINGLY decided to create this knowing that it will likely end up on the FREE internet. The fact that your on this site strongly suggests that you have in fact downloaded from this site or another as well. Who's calling the kettle black? It's an uphill battle that will NOT be won by the creators/lawyers/governments. And still, they keep creating...and we keep downloading."
,_SnakEye,2011-05-26T21:22Z,"hey guys , stop making up stories and lame excuses on the actions we do here,  no mater how much money he got or how much he didn't , if he spent 10 days on making it or 18 months, it's irrelevant 
rather it is pricey or not, it would make no difference. admit it , it is stealing.
""stealing is taking something that does not belongs to you or without the owners connect""
and he dam showed us ""his connect"".
I admit I D/L it too (probably never will be used anyway), usually if i like the product I stoled I then go buy it (did with PMDG/REX/FSXBooster/UT2,many more). yes I am also stealing, but the difference is I don't lie about it or fine stupid excuses trying to justify my actions."
,useless_leacher,2011-05-28T09:34Z,"Thankyou akila ... someone who acknowledges what they are doing.

Just because you CAN, doesn't make it legal guys.  You are stealing, so stop lying to yourselves.

@ofb .. you have no idea, but I can tell you that sales stop when a torrent is available .. again, you contribute nothing ... "" 

 ...  I wish I had your talent or someone would teach me how to do it  ..""  You don't consider that talent and time worth people paying for.  You don;t get it, do you?

You tossers won't pay $20 (on special) for something that took ages to make.

""  ..  I'll request you do Toronto Pearson and I'll buy it.  ""  ......

You must be fucking kidding, right?

""..if a person bought every airport or plane available for FSX, it would run into the $1000s""   then DON;t buy them ... but don;t steal them either.

@udidwht  ""The fact that your on this site strongly suggests that you have in fact downloaded from this site or another as well. Who's calling the kettle black?"" 

No, it suggests I can use Google.  I am stealing my own scenery?  You really are a retard.
"
,useless_leacher,2011-05-28T09:47Z,"@ofb ... almost forgot ... Why don't you tell Carenado you download pirated copies of their stuff and see how much love you get then.

With regard to the Pearson thing .. I have reconsidered ... wire the money to my account then you own the IP and can handle distribution and support.  Let's see what you think of people downloading stuff then....

Not interested?  Wonder why? ... after all, the money you'll make on sales means the piracy won't matter.

Post your email address here and I'll let you know where to send the money.

Please do it soon, as I am holding my breath ...."
,ofb,2011-06-05T16:32Z,"@useless_leacher I'll do better than that, give me your email and I'll send you photos of my copy of your fucking bundaberg and ser. # that I bought, to prove I didn't steal a fucking thing from you...but like one of the other chaps said, sometimes I come here to check out sceneries to see if they are worth the money, because on the other side of the coin, some of you guys expect to get paid for pure crap and  that is also a form of STEALING! As for Carenado,  he has my email and info and would tell you I've paid for every plane of his that I have...in fact I buy all my stuff, including aerosoft, PMDG, the lot...funny though, now after shelling out hundreds on FS9 software, now it's all collecting dust, because most of you greedy fuckers refuse to allow me to have a patch to ""upgrade "" my software so it works in FSX (PMDG prime example) and expect me to buy the software all over again...bullshit"
,ofb,2011-06-05T16:42Z,"actually this indignity from you is toooo funny...Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, and on and on...all poor starving software developers, I've never heard of a software developer in my life  that wasn't stinking rich, probably including you, I'm a pensioner who's only fun is my computer, living on $700 a month ,  but a pure rich guy like you is pissed because 25 guys (what I see here) beat you for 30 bucks...give me a friggin break...greed knows no bounds, and you don't know me at all, if it were my software, I wouldn't lose a minutes sleep over it because for every guy on PB, there are a dozen who aren't"
,R4lfin4tor,2011-06-25T20:57Z,"Does anybody else here think it's ironic that the ""useless"" person here claiming to be the creator of the software (they never are, btw.) has a Pirate Bay account?"
,useless_leacher,2011-06-26T10:42Z,"@ofb: Your ignorance continues to astound.  The reason your ""FS9 stuff"" hasn't been patched is because mostly it requires redoing from the ground up.  Given that you were (self-confessed) too lazy to learn how to make the stuff yourself, it is pretty rich that you call people who do invest the time to make things greedy. 

Make something and see what you think the price should be.  You really are lame.

You may not have noticed that your $20 purchase didn't give you the right to upload the software (as you were intending to do)    

@R4lfin4tor:  It is probably more ironic that ofb is on this thread having apparently purchased the scenery already  (for greedy megabucks according to him/her/it).

I am sorry if you doubt that I authored the scenery, but frankly I don't make a habit of giving my credentials to thieves ... so you'll all have to take me at my word  ... and muster all your pre-pubescent intelligence to see whether I could have any other reason for finding this thread (clearly I'm not here to encourage people to steal the scenery am I?)

(Still waiting for ofb's email address and down-payment so I can get started on Pearson for him)"
,useless_leacher,2011-06-26T10:47Z,"@ofb ... at $700 per month, you get more (for doing little) than this scenery has earned in TOTAL.

Maybe that will give you something to think about.

Ignorant, greedy and selfish."
,2bardel,2011-07-06T04:07Z,"Why all the fuss. I cannot download this as there is no link to the ""Magnetic Link"" Can somebody fix this?"
,STIG360,2012-03-09T22:38Z,Please seed...........
,STIG360,2012-03-13T21:59Z,"Please help me!
