[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T20:14Z,"Worth repeating:

""I do sympathize with people on slow connections - it is my 'raison d'etre' (French phrase meaning ""reason for existence."").

 However, your claim have simple solution: Become regular. I seed long enough for anyone - but
 1. people on slow lines must be here and start download on day of upping
 2. people must be reasonable and learn simple math - ""How much I can really download"" in let say 48h, non-stop.

 People who miss something - must accept the reality. As in life, if something has been gone, by own deeds and merits, it belongs in the - past.

 People shouldn't be acting like children left alone in candy store and stuff in mouth more than can swallow, take or put in the pockets."""
