,Maanegahl,2011-07-07T01:04Z,"Nice collection! But you're missing the 2000 bootleg ""Vamperotica"". Other than that, fuckin' great! Love that you've added the P.D.A.-album :)"
,Impaled_Carcass,2011-08-17T21:50Z,Thank you very much!!! Great collection!
,DarkRaven88,2011-08-22T12:25Z,"Love the torrent. The only thing I have to comment on though is that you do not have COF 1993 Album ""Total Fucking Darkness""... Other then that. AWESOME TORRENT!!!!
(#^.^#)"
,worldmisanthropy,2011-08-27T12:02Z,"I FORGOT ADD SONG ""Nocturnal supremacy '96"" FROM DUSK AND HER EMBRACE ALBUM"
,Kargeras,2011-09-12T12:21Z,"I don't know why exactly your torrents aren't receiving any comments but...

I just registered an account specifically to thank you for the MAGNIFICENT amount of effort behind your truly AWESOME and PROFESSIONAL made torrents : Burzum, Metallica, Dodheimsgard, Gorgoroth & other COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHIES.

Needless to say that FLAC(s) are more than welcome and I think a special ""Thank you!"" is in place just for this thing alone.
But to submit also the 320kbps (the highest MP3 quality) of the exact same thing (with Hi-Res covers, booklets and whatnot) is just the way things should've always been done.

Being a collector myself I understand the amount of work and attention required to obtain such COMPLETE & ACCURATE discographies.
Gigantic stuff, superbly made, just like your other torrents.

I just hope YOUR manner of creating/uploading torrents becomes the new standard.

Looking forward for more of your great stuff.

Thank you once again, you've my (and I'm sure, MANY, MANY others') utmost appreciation!

P.S.
It's most unfortunate how these torrents don't receive a simple ""thanks"" when they deserve thousands.

P.S.2

Thank you for mentioning you forgot to add that one song (Nocturnal Supremacy '96).
Yet another proof of the quality of your torrents for those of us who appreciate accuracy & completeness."

[T],dylanlutchman,2012-03-17T20:14Z,"thanks a million 4 this, no other 320kbps out there and hardly CoF on TPB...thumbs up bro"
,eargasmic,2012-04-05T13:40Z,"Thank you so much for this. This is the most complete collection of Cradle of Filth I've ever come across. Not only was it professionally done, but from reading the other comments, is well worth the download. Rather than downloading the MP3 one though, I donwloaded the FLAC and intend to convert from FLAC to MP3. 

Once again, thank you so much for this!"
,eargasmic,2012-04-05T15:49Z,"Now I feel stupid, 'cause event though it said it in the title, I still thought these were FLAC. Herp derp"
