Video format seems to be PAL 4:3; but the picture is PAL 16:9.
It is recorded in 6000k MP2 directly from the digital TV receiver.
The videos are released unedited, and in its original format; no extra compression.

IT IS GUARANTEED -- absolutely  -- that the material is "real", real TV  :), 
and it came from my TV recorder. This material do not come from "the Internet".

This video release is for research purposes only, and it is suspected that the
video is produced prior to the "event" which, in that case, is likely a hoax 
or at least partially fabricated. This void the copyright rights for research, 
political, or law enforcement purposes.
