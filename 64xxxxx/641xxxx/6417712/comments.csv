,cryoffalcon,2012-01-09T21:21Z,"JUST TO COMMENT HERE I MADE ACCOUNT ON PIRATEBAY, well i don't know about you people but this software worked for me, right now the level of testing is only done on two tracks and it worked perfect on one and one 2nd one it has a very minor sound in the ending part of track, but no matter WHAT YOU USE YOU CAN NEVER REMOVE VOCALS COMPLETELY, in theory it is possible in reality not. I was not going to download this after reading comments but as its size was small i thought of giving it a try, now i am glad i did this ^_^"
