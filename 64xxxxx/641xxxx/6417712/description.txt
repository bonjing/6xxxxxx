YoGen Vocal Remover 3.3.10

Donâ€™t let someone elseâ€™s singing keep you from enjoying your music. Listen to songs in a brand new way. Or take over the lead vocals yourself! Vocal Remover is a stand-alone program that tries to remove lead vocals from stereo sound. This software works very well for vocal tracks that are â€œup in the middleâ€ of the stereo mix. Other placement of the vocal in the stereo field may not be removed. So donâ€™t expect this software to remove vocals 100% nicely. In many cases it will be useful enough to remove lead vocals.
