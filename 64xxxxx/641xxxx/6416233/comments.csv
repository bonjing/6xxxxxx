[V],twentyforty,2011-05-23T20:00Z,Thank you for doing season packs.
,dark_defender,2011-05-23T20:39Z,"@20-40: Friend, most of all people, you don't need to thank me. I am glad to be of some help."
,guitarblues14,2011-05-23T20:50Z,"I was just falling short of 3 episodes & thanks to you, I'll have the entire season now. Thanks a ton for doing the season pack, mate. Cheers!

Sorry if this posts twice, TPB seems to be on its rag yet again & is not showing what I posted before /yet/."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-23T21:10Z,"ALL Supernatural fans:

 DO NOT download from ZERO if you already have my encodes.

 1.) Load and start torrent by dark_defender and keep'm running few minutes, till folder and few files (files are empty even if they look fine) are created.
 2. ) Stop the torrent.
 3.) Find all my encodes you have and COPY them in that newly created directory - when asked OVERWRITE empty files
 4.) Do Force ReCheck right clicking on stopped torrent
 5.) ReCheck should find files you've put there - and you'll be at higher percentage to start with
 6.) Press Start

 Please, by doing so, you'll be doing a favor to yourself (not downloading same stuff twice) and - to fellow downloaders, who would have something to exchange.

 Please, do not just leech. You are better than the rest. Exchange bytes given during the download - that would be only way to finish at all - dark_defender and myself (for a help, just for short time) would seed with activated Initial seeding."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-23T21:14Z,"LOL... ""all my encodes"" = of course, of Supernatural Season Six."
,dark_defender,2011-05-23T21:16Z,All those who already had the whole season or just completed from me can help me in seeding this and let others have it too.
,dark_defender,2011-05-23T21:27Z,"@20-40: Lol. Didn't see your comment until i made mine and so I said the same thing.

And yes, thanks for helping me seed it.

@All: As 20-40 just said, our seeding time is only limited, so share while you are downloading, by setting your uploading speed to unlimited and try and keep your active torrents to minimum."
,guitarblues14,2011-05-23T21:52Z,"I started following Supernatural a bit late so all I have of 20-40's encodes are episode 17-22 which I'll be sharing when I start the download in an hour or so. My internet speed isn't all that great but I'll keep the upload speed at 10-15 kbps, I know its not much but I myself download at anything between 12-17 kbps now that I've exhausted my high speed usage. Hope it helps (:"
,tylr,2011-05-23T23:41Z,"..tHink u can do House s7 after tf'y completes releasing the torrent?!

,dark_defender,2011-06-12T15:20Z,"^^ Funny that you asked. I guess you haven't heard of twentyforty.
Anyways you can download one file, hardly 125 mb and see for yourself."

,jayrvorgz,2012-04-06T12:38Z,"Hi. I'm new to downloading torrents, so I didn't understand the part where I should  ""Find all my encodes you have and COPY them in that newly created directory"" as instructed by 20-40. Can anyone help me out? Thanks!"
