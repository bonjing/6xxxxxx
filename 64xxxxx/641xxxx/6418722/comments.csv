,UF6,2011-05-25T12:11Z,"Yes this is real, if you believe me take a shot and scan the rar file to check. 

Also does anybody have the Victoria 2 Old Vic DLC uploaded here?"
,GoodTunes,2011-05-30T01:29Z,"Don't use Old Vic, it screws up so much and is impossible to uninstall.

Everyone I've heard who's used it (myself included) had had issues with it, it's not worth the slightly fancier graphics."
,Cynabal,2011-07-30T01:15Z,"Works fine, don't need to crack it. Just patch and play.

A word of advice though: Don't install a mod, then patch, then install another mod. It will only end badly. My main computer is now a flaming wreck, and I had to post this from my phone and oh crap my legs on fire ow ow ow"
,RobMidas,2011-07-30T14:41Z,Thanks for the upload. Have you got the 1.4 beta June release? Do you know where if not I could get it?
,HorneyKlingon,2011-09-01T02:06Z,Anyone know where I can find the latest 1.4 beta? Been searching for days...
