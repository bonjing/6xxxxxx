Call of Duty is a first-person and third-person shooter video game series franchise, created by Ben Chichoski. The series began on the PC, and later expanded to consoles and handhelds, and several spin-off games have also been released alongside the main series. The majority of the games in the series have been set primarily in World War II, with the exception of Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2 which are set in modern times, and Black Ops which is set in the Cold War era.

The Call of Duty video games are published and owned by Activision and published for Macs by Aspyr Media and have been developed primarily by Infinity Ward and Treyarch, with other games being developed by Gray Matter Interactive, Spark Unlimited, Pi Studios, Amaze Entertainment, Rebellion Developments, and n-Space, using a variety of game engines including the id Tech 3, the Treyarch NGL, and the IW 4.0. Other products in the franchise include a line of action figures designed by Plan-B Toys, a card game created by Upper Deck, and a comic book mini-series published by WildStorm.

As of November 27, 2009, total sales for the entire Call Of Duty series have surpassed 55 million units worldwide, taking $3 billion in retail sales in the process.

A 2010 Q3 earnings call from Activision confirmed that the eighth installment of the franchise - a FPS - was currently in development, due for release "during the back half of 2011".

Call of Duty is a video game based on the Quake III Arena engine (id Tech 3), and was released on October 29, 2003. The game was developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. The game simulates the infantry and combined arms warfare of World War II.[3] Call of Duty was accompanied in September 2004 by an expansion pack, Call of Duty: United Offensive, which was also produced by Activision, but developed by Gray Matter Interactive with contributions from Pi Studios. The game follows the American paratroopers, British paratroopers and the Red army. The Mac OS X version of the game was ported by Aspyr Media. In late 2004, the N-Gage version was developed by Nokia and published by Activision. Other versions were released for PC, including Collector's Edition (with soundtrack and strategy guide), Game of the Year Edition (includes game updates), and the Deluxe Edition (which contains the United Offensive expansion and soundtrack; in Europe the soundtrack was not included). Since November 12, 2007, Call of Duty and its sequels have been available for purchase via Valve's content delivery platform, Steam.
