,dielaughing,2011-05-24T06:02Z,"God Dammit! This isn't Porn!!!! And it won't let me edit it.. it just goes blank, white screen, with the words: ""EDIT - Temporarily disabled !"" Fuck that! Why did my pictures, high resolution, get categorized under porn?! I'm fuming! I deliberately took out all of the naked women, save one, and all the jokes, funny words, bands and CD covers.. all the limp dick art pretty much, and left a plethora, a cornucopia of really awesome stuff that'll get spread around a LOT, I'm sure of it. Porn...?! There's lots of that all over the place, but this isn't it! This is Better! (said with an evil grin, as horns slowly emerge from my forehead, and my heart turns to solid, cold granite."
,dielaughing,2011-05-24T06:09Z,"I've stopped all of my downloading, seeding torrent traffic, accept for this.. I'm giving all my bandwidth to this. And when people start to get %100 of this package of pictures, I expect to hear a few words of appreciation from the masses... and if you were lookin' for a beaver, I've uploaded plenty of that too.. but this is Evil Art.. and should dress up anybody's lamer desktop &/or screensaver.. I put all my personal favorite wallpaper packages that I've collected together into this one torrent, so you might have some of these already.. and I renamed all of the pics, numbering them and all.. nice and neat... so if you have a duplicate some place, I'm sure it'll have a different name. TPB really needs to fix that Edit reject function.. it's been like that for far too long now. I've tried to edit others in the past, oh, 6 months.. and I have always gotten the same lame words, temp. disabled, or some such shit.. get on it people! We bring the goods.. you run the site.. so... Run It Then!"

,moonrunner99,2011-05-25T16:50Z,"definitely does not belong in the porn section. Looked through the pics, and haven't seen anything pornographic. Lots of weird images, many not wallpaper sized, or of low quality, but so far, not seen any porn."
,dielaughing,2011-05-28T07:01Z,"Some, you mean, not many, some.. I just threw a few odd ones in there, but the vast majority of the 1600 images are infact, huge."
