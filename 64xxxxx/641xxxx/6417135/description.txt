This here is the most polished up collection of my best pictures, mostly high resolution, for wallpapering your desktop or screensaver. Some might be great to make into a poster, which I've included the free app to do that as well. A very special thanks goes out to: HR Geiger (even though I couldn't find much of his artwork), HP Lovecraft, http://www.goominet.com/, Escher, Angelo, Super-Resolution Microscopy, NASA, www.VirtualCustoms.com, Zigmunt, Skinny Puppy and all the great and terrible influences that made this all possible.
