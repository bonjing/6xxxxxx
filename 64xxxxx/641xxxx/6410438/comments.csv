This is a CD rip. Elektra Catalog # 5E-507-2.
It was originally released on vinyl in '79.

Since it's probably the only real CBR320 rip that you're going to find on the internet you could at least say thanks for the share.

You sound like some of the ingrates on Demonoid. 

Cheers."

I have this CD but it takes time to find it and to convert it to MP3... This just makes it all that much easier!

 So THANKS again vtwin88cube!"
