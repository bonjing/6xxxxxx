i have a movie request if your busy schedule permits you please look into it: 

""Days of Heaven"" 1978
directed by Terrence Malick
IMDB ratings 8/10

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077405/

Perhaps the most typical example of a '70s American art film -- daring, romantic, rebellious but also filled with longing for the beauty of the past."

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-24T14:49Z,Seeding aborted. Negative rating (+1/-2 (-1)).
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-24T15:19Z,"@sadhu: Done and upped yesterday. Must wait for Friday. Currently, on seeding server are Barney's, Bloody Valentine. The Con Artist and Sarah's Key but it seems as I can't find few bucks needed for more upload slots. I even must shut down biggest server on 26th (50+ movies). That's how cookie crumbles."
