  "The Boys in Company C" follows the lives of five naive young Marine      
  inductees from their training in boot camp through a tour in Vietnam      
  that quickly devolves into a hellish nightmare. Disheartened by futile    
  combat, appalled by the corruption of their South Vietnamese ally, and    
  constantly endangered by the incompetence of their own company            
  commander, the young men find a possible way out of the war. They are     
  told that if they can defeat a rival soccer team, they can spend the      
  rest of their tour playing exhibition games behind the lines. But as      
  they might have predicted, nothing in Vietnam is as simple as it seems.

  Recognized as the inspiration for Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket," "The     
  Boys in Company C" is a high-end member of the cannon of classic battle   
  field movies and a frighteningly realistic critique of the pointlessness  
  and corruption universally associated with the US Vietnam war.
