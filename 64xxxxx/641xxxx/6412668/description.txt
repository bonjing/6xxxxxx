[W4F PRESENTS]: Monster.Moves.S05E02.Spectacular.Spitfire.HDTV.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/05/22

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
A team of aviation engineers attempt to move a historic
Spitfire fighter aircraft over 6,000km from Duxford in England
to Easton, Maryland USA for a private collector.

The vintage aircraft cant carry enough fuel for the team to
fly it to the US. Too large to be trucked or shipped intact, this
episode follows the team attempt to dismantle it for its epic
trek by trucks and ship. This operation is a huge challenge, as
the aircraft must be flight worthy after it has been
reassembled.

To squeeze the Spitfire inside a shipping container, the team
must disconnect the fuselage, wings, nose and tail. They must
build a support cradle for each component so they fit, snug,
together like a jigsaw puzzle inside the container, and dont
bump or knock around. The journey is fraught with problems.
Following a painstaking reconstruction process in Easton, will
this classic aircraft survive the journey to fly again?

I saw a spitfire take-off up close once, those things are
LOUD.

Note: Ep 2 was aired weeks before Ep 1 in Australia for some
reason.
