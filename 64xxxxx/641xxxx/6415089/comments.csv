Please let us know the source [silver cd, lossless image w/ cue...?] & rip methodology [EAC secure ? w/ log and a NONcompliant (hope so) cue ?] used here...

,omniwig,2011-12-23T02:28Z,anyone else notice that the tone of these songs have been raised? they definitely sound like the album tracks. it sounds like someone was playing with his or her equalizer when recording/mixing them.
,omniwig,2011-12-23T03:03Z,they definitely don't sound like the album tracks*.
,castiboy,2012-01-23T18:29Z,"from the logs, it seems these are ripped from CDs...

Something's puzzling me though...

All tracks report as ""Accurately ripped (confidence 1)"" in all logs...

but all my verifications with CUETools yield:
[CUETools log; Date: 23.01.2012 18:44:33; Version: 2.1.2a]
[CTDB TOCID: ...] disk not present in database.
[AccurateRip ID: ...] disk not present in database.

I'm no expert so I don't know what to make of this..."
