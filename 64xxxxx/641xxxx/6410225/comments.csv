,sharaz_ali,2011-05-21T19:26Z,"THIS DOES NOT HAVE THE POST CREDITS, BUT ITS OKAY. THANKS UPLOADER. In the post-credits scene of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, Blackbeard's voodoo doll of Captain Jack Sparrow washes ashore in front of Angelica. She picks it up, and smiles as she realizes she can have her revenge. So there will be a Pirates of the Caribbean 5 in most likely the year (2013)."

,InsaneCaribou,2011-06-25T01:15Z,"This torrent works perfectly, good quality and all.
But fucking MPAA tracked this torrent and send an email through Time Warner to tell us to delete the file.
