,coolzephyr,2011-07-22T06:38Z,"Sure, I'm doing something wrong but during the activation screen when the x-force is opened and ""Mem Patch"" is clicked it gives an error msg -""You need to apply patch when licence screen appears"". Then when request code is pasted on ""Request"" and "" Generate"" was clicked it produces a code inadequate for all the spaces provided in the activation screen (produces 57 character while there are 64 spaces)...
if anyone can plz help with some idea, will really appreciate. Thanks "
,Mobius96,2011-08-07T18:55Z,There's no keygen and the exe file included in the crack doesn't work. Am I missing something? Please help 
,deadvillager,2011-09-25T03:08Z,"Working fine, thanks. Just wondering, can I access the mudbox community features safely, what with this being a cracked version?"
,DemiNytemair,2011-10-07T01:19Z,"Everything I get from X-Force is fucked up. Anyone figure anything out with this Microsoft Visual C++ issue? I got one use out of this piece of garbage. Don't download or seed for X-Force, everything they upload is bullshit."
,DemiNytemair,2011-10-09T16:40Z,"FOR EVERYONE WITH RUNTIME ERROR: Go to My Documents, and rename the ""Mudbox"" folder to ""Mudbox old"". This will reset the configuration of Mudbox, which is apparently being corrupted."
