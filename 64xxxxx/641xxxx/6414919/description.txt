Master and Commander - Patrick O'Brian-viny

The beginning to the sweeping Aubrey/Maturin series and inspiration for the major new motion picture starring Russell Crowe. "The best sea story I have ever read."â€”Sir Francis Chichester


This, the first in the splendid series of Jack Aubrey novels, establishes the friendship between Captain Aubrey, R.N., and Stephen Maturin, ship's surgeon and intelligence agent, against a thrilling backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. Details of a life aboard a man-of-war are faultless rendered: the conversational idiom of the officers in the ward room and the men on the lower deck, the food, the floggings, the mysteries of the wind and the rigging, and the roar of broadsides as the great ships close in battle.

Master and Commander is available in two editions: the regular edition featuring the classic cover art of Geoff Hunt, and a movie tie-in edition with a cover photo featuring Russell Crowe, star of Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.
