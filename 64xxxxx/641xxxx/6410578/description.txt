The lyrics and music of Kaoma's "Chorando se foi (Lambada)" are an unauthorized translation of the song "Llorando se fue", originally composed, performed and recorded by the Bolivian Andean pop group Los Kjarkas in 1981.[5][6] The song's lyrics and music had been lawfully registered in 1985 by the founding members of Los Kjarkas- Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa- in Germany's Music and Authors Society (GEMA). The unauthorized copy by Kaoma led to a successful 1990 lawsuit by Los Kjarkas against Kaoma producer Jean-Claude Bonaventure.[5]

According to Gonzalo Hermosa, Los Kjarkas had based "Llorando se fue" from a small, nostalgic Andean melody. Their song was written in a sad and slow Saya rhythm.[7]
