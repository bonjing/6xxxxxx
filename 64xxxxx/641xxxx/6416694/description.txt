Sarahâ€™s Key tells two stories simultaneously. In the first, Sarah (Melusine Mayance) is a 10-year-old Jewish girl living with her parents and younger brother in Paris in 1942 when French authorities arrest them and other Jewish families to send them to Nazi prison camps. In the second, Julia (Scott Thomas) is a journalist living in Paris in 2009 with her husband and daughter who wants to write about the detainments to bring to light this little-known moment of shame in French history.
But her investigations turn up a disturbing discovery: The apartment her family is moving into (which has been owned by her husbandâ€™s family for more than 60 years) was previously occupied by a displaced Jewish family â€“ Sarahâ€™s. Believing that Sarah was not killed in the concentration camps, Julia goes on a hunt to determine what became of her.
