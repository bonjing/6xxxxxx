As it is, one very highly detailed nipple fills the entire screen."
,andenxtc,2011-05-23T03:08Z,"thegreenfrog, i understand, but the way is that some ppl want original size. after downloading u can rezise yourself. ppl who us CS5 want biggest as possible, but if u want this for wank, I will think about it  =)"

,moonrunner99,2011-05-24T01:38Z,"I am in favor of posting stuff at it's original resolution. I have seen pictures out there that have been re-sized, cropped, bent, folded, mutilated, and pixelated beyond all recognition. Each time the person doing it thinks they are improving it. In the end, if a person wants to re-size the picture, most image viewers have a fit to screen option and allow you to zoom at will. 

I am not disagreeing with any other poster on this, just stating my personal preference."

,mnamna,2011-05-25T00:00Z,This one's a bit plain looking for me. Pass.
,agregger,2011-06-13T23:51Z,"If you don't have the bandwidth or the drive space, download one of the many lower res sets.  As for me THANK YOU for giving me the high res!"
