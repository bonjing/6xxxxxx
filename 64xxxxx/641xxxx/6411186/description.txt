who make a long-awaited return to the show to play tracks from their latest
album Angles.

Also in the studio are Staff Benda Bilili, based around a core of disabled
musicians who used to rehearse in a zoo, and who have recently been the subject
of a film - Benda Bilili! - which appeared at Cannes to critical acclaim.

There's music from The Burns Unit, an eight-piece Scottish-Canadian collective
whose sound has been described as 'indie pop meets carnival rock', and whose
members include award-winning folk singer Karine Polwart, alt-folk royalty
King Creosote and indie queen Emma Pollock.

Seasick Steve performs songs from his latest album You Can't Teach an Old Dog
New Tricks, and forms a hobo power trio alongside drummer Dan Magnusson and
bassist John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin and Them Crooked Vultures fame.

Plus Charlie Haden Quartet West, in which the legendary double bassist,
veteran collaborator with Ornette Coleman, Pat Metheny and many more, teams
up with wife Ruth Cameron to perform music from his Sophisticated Ladies
album, which explores the Great American Songbook.
