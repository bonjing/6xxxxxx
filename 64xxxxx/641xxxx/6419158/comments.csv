So, not working for me sorry :( any ideas?"
,egervari,2011-05-25T15:55Z,"I already have an old loader on my system, but I don't know which one and how to remove it. How can I find this information?

This loader prevents me from installing it."
[V],DeGun,2011-05-25T16:12Z,"@@ ICEY : 

If you previously had another loader (or previous version of this one ) you need first to use the same loader than before , click on uninstal then use this one by pressing instal .
For instance if your previous loader was WatRemove 2.1 you need to execute again wat remove to click on uninstal and then you use this one ...

Let us know ."

Followed everything to the letter. Seemed to work, no error messages. Rebooted, illegal Windows nag screen. Still black desktop and ""This copy of Windows is not genuine""."
,dogbone1951,2011-05-29T03:45Z,"You MUST visit the following website to revalidate Windows: http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/
It's part of the 'fix'. Works fine now! Thanks DeGun!!!!!!

,Xarlequin,2011-06-19T14:06Z,"Last time I reinstalled my computers I had to struggle with 4 advanced programs to get my windows 7 back to being 'genuine'. Took atleast 2 hours.

Using your program I was done in 3 minutes and everything worked perfectly.

Thank you so much!"
,fnoop,2011-06-23T08:16Z,"I'm trying to install this, but it's telling me I need to uninstall other cracks first. I've uninstalled the ones I had on my torrent client, ran removeWAT, but it didn't help. Any thoughts on how to remove cracks that may or may not be there?"
,wheretheactionis,2011-06-29T17:30Z,"I installed and rebooted, got genuine status, visited http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ and i get ""Because Windows installed on your PC is genuine, enjoy the security, reliability and protection it provides."", but when i try to install security essentials i get 'Windows did not pass genuine validation' ... go online and resolve, when i go online i get that my windows is genuine.Can someone help?"
[V],DeGun,2011-06-29T22:14Z,"@@ FNOOP : one of the last crack yuh used is still on your computer or else yuh did not reboot after uninstalling previous crack , did yuh ? if yea and still not working it means that a previous crack is STILL on yur cpu so run them all cracks/loader/removeWat/any other and where yuh see ""uninstall"" click on it , each time reboot until the last loader works , by the way version 2.0.4 released https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6500039 so use it after uninstall worked .

@@ Wheretheactionis : no idea whats going on i never use this app but as guess check program options if there is nothing saying about checking this (ie : if windows update are uptodate or if it checks for genuine version first etc...)  + check google :
