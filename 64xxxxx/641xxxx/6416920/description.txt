Before you plan your wedding, plan your marriage! Wish you could know what youâ€™re getting into when you say â€œI doâ€? Now, with Things I Wish Iâ€™d Known Before We Got Married, you can. Dr. Gary Chapman, #1 New York Times best-selling author of The 5 Love Languagesâ„¢, has spent the last thirty-five years counseling couples. In Things I Wish Iâ€™d Known Before We Got Married, he shares what he and these couples have learned from experience. 

Among the twelve things you should know: that being in love is not enough to make a successful marriage, that romantic love has two stages (and how to make the transition), that mutual sexual fulfillment is not automatic, and that personality profoundly affects behavior. The stakes on marriage are high, but the rewards of preparing are even higher. Whether youâ€™re single or dating, this audio can be your relationship blueprint and help you decide if and when youâ€™re ready to tie the knot. If youâ€™re engaged, even recently married, it will help you examine your relationship foundation and learn the skills necessary for building a successful marriage. Things I Wish Iâ€™d Known Before We Got Married was written to help you realize your goal of marital happiness. But donâ€™t just listen to itâ€”experience it. Grapple with the practical tips and ideas discussed, honestly share your thoughts and feelings, respect each otherâ€™s opinions, and find workable solutions to your differences. The more you do so, says Chapman, the more you will be prepared for marriage.
