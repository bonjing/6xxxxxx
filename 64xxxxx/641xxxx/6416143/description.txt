RL Vision Flash Renamer 6.53

Flash Renamer renames many files at once by applying rules such as case convert, sequential numbering and seach / replace. It's a time saver for people with large amount of files, eg digital camera users, webmasters & mp3 collectors. Flash Renamer renames many files at once, so called batch or bulk renaming (or "en masse"). With Flash Renamer you can automate thousands of file renames in a single click!

Use Flash Renamer to set your filenames to UPPERCASE, lowercase or First Letter Case. Extract & rename with Mp3 ID3 tags to tidy up your music collection.

Find & replace strings within the filenames. Set the file date & attributes. Remove unwanted spaces. Add & remove characters at certain positions.

Sequential renaming gives you the chance to add number sequences to your filenames. You can also extract useful information, such as width/height, length, bitrate & framerate from movie, music & image files, and put this in the filename.

And if that wasn't enough, Flash Renamer can detect the format of files without proper extension. You can even organize your music collection according to eg artist & album!

Flash Renamer handles both files & directories and works with all versions of Windows. The realtime preview instantly shows you what the new filenames will look like, so you don't have to worry about making any mistakes. Don't spend your time renaming files by hand. Use Flash Renamer - the essential file utility!
