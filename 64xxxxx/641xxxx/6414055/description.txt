This is a RESEED. I have a reason to believe that the original torrent uploaded about 8-9 hrs ago was corrupt.  

In order to make a solid MONO remix, the reference of sort is needed.  This time, the title â€œHey Bulldogâ€ from the double album â€œRock â€˜nâ€™ Roll [US pressing/MONO] was taken as a starting point.  The title â€œHey Bulldogâ€ (MONO) was mixed rather unusually. The mid frequencies were sort of suppressed (1-3khz) making the vocals â€œpushed backâ€ while the Georgeâ€™s guitar and Paulâ€™s bass take the center stage.  The frequency matrix was copied and applied to all tracks.  In my opinion, â€œHey Bulldogâ€ was the best mono mix ever made.  However, the re-master version in â€œBeatles in Mono, Past Masters 2â€ doesnâ€™t have the punch and the kick of the bass, and the whole impression is sort of â€œairyâ€ because of the unreasonable high frequencies boost.  

The process:

1. Applied the frequency curve of â€Hey Bulldogâ€ MONO  to all tracks 
2.  Stereo converted to mono by simply mixing lef and right into a single center channel at 50%
3. Mid compression at about 10khz
4. Re-sampled for the smallest possible file siye while preserving the authenticity of frequency response and dynamics.  

If youâ€™re going to listen to this on a high end surround sound system, youâ€™re bound for a major disappointment.  Basic two channel stereo system will be more than enough to give you an exceptional listening pleasure.  

Enjoy
