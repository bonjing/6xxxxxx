Il Mare (aka Siworae) (2000)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282599/

Video: MKV 720x400 23.98fps
Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo, Korean
Subtitle: English (integrated)

The video was downloaded from a 'file-sharing site'. Unfortunately the audio was not Korean & it was so annoying. So I extracted Korean audio track from lower quality rip video to replace it. Hope you guys like it
