Another thing i want to say that all the crack keys usually get blocked by kaspersky very soon. So bring a solution"

the only safe and easy way to keep your kaspersky free and working is by means of keys.

# the keys with higher validity are not usually uploaded or made any effort to make them available because no matter how long the keys validity are they will be blocked soon.
