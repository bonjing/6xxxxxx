*** NOTE *** Once again our source was hammered with severe weather causing a banner on the top through out the show along with an annonying banner scrolling at the bottom.  To make things even worse there was a weather station interuption during the 14 min. mark of the program ( lasts only about 30 seconds ) which we cut out.  The weather sure hates Oprah or does not want to see her gone.  *** NOTE ***
