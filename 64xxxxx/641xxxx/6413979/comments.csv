,KingKarat,2011-05-23T19:51Z,"Is everybody downloading this just because they think it is a sequel to ""The Incredibles""? I can't figure out another reason after looking over the reviews at IMDB..."
,guessvic,2011-05-24T03:17Z,"No, this is the Chinese version of incredible. It's fun, well as least according to the way they speak in Chinese.

The IMDB described based on the story of the film but it doesn't say anything about this film being a ""sequel"" of the other incredible film.

Try watch it. It's sorta fun :D."

,Exodus666,2011-05-27T22:09Z,"Great download, remember to get the subtitles in its own folder.

Movie is pretty funny, ofc its got alot of the chinese slapstick humor that becomes very cheese for a western audience, but its still great film."
,SparklyNunPanties,2011-05-29T22:14Z,"Nice rip excellent quality. 

Movie is blehâa total piece of crap. Spare youself."

,MrHanimi,2011-06-09T00:11Z,"BSplayer?
seriously?
as in bull shit player?

I wish VLC was built into OS's nowadays :("
,peekowang,2011-06-10T22:46Z,"why bother with vlc just download the cccp (combined community codec pack)

i've never had a problem with any video as long my codecs are up to date"
,somedude.1001,2011-06-11T11:26Z,"bsplayer is a legitimate video player, bro -.-"
,born2b,2011-06-15T08:50Z,Thanks!
,Archonin,2011-06-15T09:24Z,"Agree with above comment, if you're an idiot, of course you can use VLC or another player with pre-installed codecs.
If you like good quality however, use CCCP."
,panzersiddhartha,2011-06-15T19:39Z,"Sigh.. Ok, I feel myself being sucked in, even though the mantra 'debating on the Internet is like running in the special olympics..' is echoing in my mind. Are you serious that there still are people out there using Codec packs? Like in the 90s? No matter if the player is called bullshit or xvid or whatever, it is still very funny. I use VLC for some stuff and XBMC for some stuff (like 1080p on slow computers) and I have never, ever, had any problems with any movie at all since I went away from the codec hell of the 90s. Can we get  back to the film at hand now? So it is chinese, is at 5.2, and is described as a slow romantic comedy about two retired super heroes thinking about getting at it again, with some action scenes. Well, fair play."
,chicalleje,2011-06-16T19:03Z,K-lite codec pack standard install MPC and has all the features I want (zooming with the numpad is really good).
,jaironep,2011-06-23T20:44Z,Nice quality video and audio. litlte funny movie.
,call_me_nobody,2011-07-04T14:18Z,"If you have an poor cpu or a non 1080p usable cpu, but a good gpu i recommend media player classic home cinema;)"
,mkvluv,2011-07-07T08:10Z,"god awful movie. they should ban this torrent, lol"
,Rickyv90,2011-07-09T07:33Z,lol I was thinking this was Mr and Mrs Smith until I read the comments. Not downloading this thats for sure.
