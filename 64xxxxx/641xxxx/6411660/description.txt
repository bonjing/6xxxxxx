A small community in India is terrorized and held to ransom by a notorious gangster named Katya, who will kill anyone who stands in his way. When Katya finds out that Sachdev is attempting to rally the local residents against him, he has him brutally killed in broad daylight, and thus ended whatever opposition was there against Katya. Then Shambu Nath and his adopted son, Kashi Nath come to this community to visit his brother, Shiv Nath, as Shambu has to seek medical treatment, and is hospitalized. When Kashi witnesses the oppression and abuse inflicted on the residents by Katya and his men, he decides to oppose it, not knowing that he is endangering the lives of vulnerable Shambu, Shiva, and Shiva's wife and children.
