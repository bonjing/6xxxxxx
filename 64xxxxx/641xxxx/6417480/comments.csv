,wang8111,2011-05-26T00:19Z,does this work on ps3?
,pradoboy67,2011-05-26T07:11Z,How ever rated this an *5. out of 10 needs glasses. Luck to be a very low 6. Picture and sound not worth the download.

,wang8111,2011-05-26T08:08Z,from the samples the movie looks VERY watchable.  once again can anyone confirm whether this works on ps3?
,X-BLACK-DOG-X,2011-05-26T18:01Z,doesn't work on ps3 due to ciniavia
,BAshKd,2011-05-27T19:24Z,"Absolutely good I would give it V-9 could easily be a proper release but audio I would say maybe 6.5 or 7 because its a cam, 
But great stuff TvTeam and keep on doing what you do"

,Doonkeey,2011-05-29T20:34Z,hope this isn´t out of screen !!!!
,steelcitysy,2011-05-30T15:25Z,"great quality, worth the download.. only bitch is that the subs are in german, an im not german.. well worth the download tho, thanks..."
,celtqueen,2011-05-30T21:12Z,"epictroll:  ""nice qulaity"", ""8.5 a/v"" ???  When it's daylight the pic is good, but you can't see what's happening in the dark scenes and that's most of the movie; it's out of sync half the time and it has hard encoded German subs. I'm sorry, TvTeam, and thanks for the effort, but this one is just frustrating trying to watch.  "
,davidf1986,2011-05-30T21:15Z,this is not fast and furious 5 this is maxi overdrive 
,sopark4000,2011-05-31T11:18Z,Im getting sick of seeing this fast and the furious faggot shit taking up space on the top 100. Seriously who watches this garbage mostly people 16 and under I would assume

,flumpo,2011-06-11T19:29Z,"M:8 (If you're not a huge F&F fan, maybe 6-7).

I'm a huge Fast and Furious fan and was really looking forward to this new release. Even though I was still recovering from food poisoning, I dragged myself out of the house and went to watch this at the cinema.

I have to admit I was kind of let down. It was more like a shooter action film than a driving film. More running and shooting than driving!"
,iamnick96,2011-06-12T01:31Z,"you dont rate a movie ""for a cam"" you dumb shits"

,darmourdfi,2011-08-15T02:14Z,"to those having trouble watching on PS3....just 

• create a new user
• name it MOVIES
• and don't worry about creating a sign in
• Ciniavia cant work unless it connects to the net"
