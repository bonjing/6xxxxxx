,55trucker,2011-05-23T04:46Z,"I personally appreciate the pre-race program, it's part of the complete package that BBC offers the viewer. I keep the events permanently. Many thx for your efforts as I can't get BBC coverage here where I live for any of the f1 races. "
,Cuongga,2011-05-23T05:31Z,Thank you so much for your sharing. I expected it most
,mojazubarka,2011-05-23T05:42Z,"Build-up, of course we always interested seeing it, especially in HD, and YES we enjoy the Formula 1 coverage in HD. Man, i have no words to describe you how much your work means to me. THANK YOU jorrell0733. :-)"
,MukBro,2011-05-23T06:23Z,Thank you so much Jorrell! I live in a place that does not broadcast the F1 at all - so this is a godsend to say the least.
,yaksox,2011-05-23T10:02Z,"Thanks. Greatly appreciated. There doesn't seem to be anyone else doing this at the moment. Like a previous commenter, I'm in an area where there's no F1 coverage. These torrents are it."
,io23,2011-05-23T12:29Z,"My plasma & I can't thank you enough. China & Turkey in HD were beyond awesome! Looking forward to the built-up too! Sorry to hear these files are giving you trouble and taking up so much of your time and effort. Us ""exiles"" pray you hang in there!

Thanx again dude."
,Landaris,2011-05-23T12:45Z,"Are you guys crazy? Do any of you honestly think that there is something good in seeing Eddie Jordan's shirts in HD?

Just kiddin'. Thanks for the great work, Jorrell."
,DanteMac,2011-05-23T12:53Z,"Thank you so much!  As someone who has had to put up with the crappy American coverage for years, I can't express the depths of my gratitude!  BBC Rules!  And thank you in advance for the build-up, it just doesn't feel the same otherwise."

Seriously, jorrell is that so hard to read your description before clicking ""Add to index >"" button?"
,shores,2011-05-23T13:56Z,I'm still interested in the build-up.
,yaksox,2011-05-24T10:49Z,"grz911, hay man, until someone steps up and does a better job, jorrel's all we got."
,Sanyi001,2011-05-24T16:32Z,"Great quality, especially for the file size. And thank you for not including the pre-race show/buildup"

,mpaguirre,2011-05-26T03:14Z,Thank you so much for all the work in every grand prix!! I'll wait for the Build Up before watching the race... In the meantime have to stay away of the newspapers and sports shows to avoid finding out the result of the race! :))
