,EliteNot,2011-05-24T00:39Z,Yep.  This needs seeding.  My client is showing only 41.4% available.
[V],dohduhdah,2011-05-24T05:20Z,sorry for the slow speed
,indiaman,2011-05-28T04:02Z,"Differential Equations are a difficult topic to grasp.But these lectures make it quite easy to grasp especially because they have been explained with graphs.Dohduhdah,I can't tell you how grateful I am for these wonderful lectures.I was just browsing through all your other uploads and you are the only person who has uploaded the maximum lectures on various difficult topics.Thanks to you,these topics have become easy to understand.I express my deepest gratitude,as I know all the other students and teachers of the world do,for all the lectures you have uploaded in the past and I'm sure will keep on uploading in the future.You will always be in our prayers."
,tamsta,2011-05-28T18:43Z,"yeah, it would be nice to have Conquest of the Americas."
,indiaman,2011-05-29T14:56Z,"Could you please upload the Lectures on ""Differential Equations"" by MathTutorDVD."

,xplorsonu,2011-08-05T19:49Z,"I am very glad to realize that there's a company like ttc that cares to make such products,that there's dohduhdah who cares to upload them here,and there's mishhh who cares to compress them and I live in this internet generation. Because of guys like you Bram Cohen's work looks meaningful. I can't wait to download this torrent,although I'll have to wait. But thank you so much Sir Niek......you are one big reason why I look at the Netherlands more respectfully and humbly. I always felt that Calculus is one portion of mathematics where Visual methods are most effective and too essential also......and the description of the course is enough for me to tell that this course is going to be so much fun."
,surfbug,2011-08-13T05:10Z,"Does anyone have the utility (or collection of utilities) that's used throughout these lectures which goes by the name ""DTools"", which is supposed to be available for buyers of this course through his website (and for buyers of his book ""Differential Equations"" as an accompanying CD)? It would be much easier to follow the contents with the help of this utility..."
