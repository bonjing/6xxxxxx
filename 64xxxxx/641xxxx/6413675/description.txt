Take your photos further with Picasa from Google
Organise
Picasa instantly locates and organises all the pictures on your computer.

Find the pictures you forgot you had.
Picasa organises your entire collection while you watch, scanning the images on your computer and automatically sorting them by date.

Move and re-name pictures from inside Picasa
Want to clean up messy folders and move pictures around on your computer's hard drive? Simply drag and drop pictures from one folder in Picasa to another. Picasa will make the change permanent after double-checking with you. Want to change a picture's filename from 671056398a.jpg to Lisa.jpg? In Picasa, it only takes seconds to re-name one picture or a group of pictures.

Make an album
Use the "Albums" collection to tag your photos into quick groupings inside Picasa. Viewing and sharing the pictures you grouped under an album is easy â€“ they make great slideshows and movies or you can email them to friends.

Add a star rating
Give a gold star to any photo you love: it turns your favourites into visual standouts at a glance. Picasa even has a star search that reduces your entire photo collection to the best of the best in less than a second.

Keep one picture in multiple albums
Picasa creates a new â€œinstanceâ€ of each photo you label without taking up more space on your computer, so you can put the same picture into multiple albums.

Password-protect collections
Have photos you want to keep to yourself? You can add passwords to any of your Picasa collections (this does not affect which pictures you and others can see on your computerâ€™s hard drive).

Edit
Turn a grey sky into a picture-perfect day.

Basic Fixes are back â€“ and better
Picasa's Basic Fixes are buttons that make it fast and easy to crop, remove red eye, fix the contrast and colour, and enhance your digital pictures.

Amazing effects turn so-so pictures into works of art
You can see how much Picasa's 12 new visual effects can improve your photos â€“ and in seconds, not hours. Go sepia. Warmify. Make pictures pop with colour or try austere black-and-white. Try easy one-clicks or the more finely tuned sliders for better control where you want it. And of course, you can undo your changes at any step along the way.

Write captions that stay with the picture
Picasa makes captions the way journalists do â€“ using the IPTC standard. That means your captions are saved within their pictures and stay with them, whether you export as a web page or make a CD presentation. Picasa captions are fully editable and searchable, and you choose whether to display them or not.
Zoom. Pan. Tilt. Get the angle you intended.

So you did not get the shot? With Picasa, that is not the end of the story. Go in closer and move the focus slightly to the left. Your camera was slightly crooked? So what? Your picture is perfect anyway.

Know how to use a camera in manual mode?
Photography aficionados can now fine-tune their photos with Picasa's EXIF display. This window shows you all the camera data that is stored in a picture's original file - such as camera model, date the photo was taken, even if a flash was used. The EXIF display also has a RGB histogram, a real-time graph that shows the intensity of colours in your picture and how they change when you make edits in Picasa.

Share
The hardest part of sharing your pictures is choosing your favourites.

Gmail
Send photos via email that are a joy to receive
Take the guesswork out of sending photos. Picasa automatically resizes and attaches pictures to email messages at sizes your friends will be able to open. Works with most email programs, including Google Mail.

Put pictures on your own site, for free
Picasa Web Albums is the fast and easy way to put your photos on the web. Just select the photos in Picasa that you want to share and click to publish. In seconds, those photos are on your own web page, ready to share with the people you know. Check out a few things you can

Make beautiful slide shows
With Picasa, you can turn a group of photos into a presentation with one click, then share your slide show on a CD.

You can take your photos with you no matter how you like to carry them. Picasa works with all the newest compact flash devices.

Backup

Create a network backup of your pictures.

Now you can also control the quality and sizes of your exported pictures. Picasa even will save photos back to any drive, including the newest flash memory cards and sticks.

Create
Enjoy your pictures in fun, creative ways â€“ it is what photography is all about!
Turn your photos into a movie.

It is so easy to play filmmaker with your pictures. Select your best shots, then adjust the delay time, dimensions, and video compression settings. That is it â€“ Picasa will render a movie, complete with title graphics, that you can play and share.
Make a personalised desktop picture or screensaver.

Your best pictures are now on display. Pick a favourite photo as your desktop picture or add several into your screensaver rotation. What better way to enjoy your photographic genius at your desk?

Create a poster
Picasa can tile any picture you select, allowing you to print each part and reassemble them at poster size â€“ up to 1,000% larger than the original.
Make picture collages.

Select a group of pictures, choose one of the beautiful templates, and Picasa will create a collage that expands your creative horizons. Picture pile it. Make a multi-exposure image. Create a contact sheet. Done? Simply save your collage to a folder, as a new desktop background or as a screensaver.
