For fans of the turbine era at Indianapolis, THIS IS IT!

Over an hour of solid vintage Indianapolis racing film from the year 1968 is here.

See three different vintage films, all on the 1968 race.  All show and tell the story of the 500 that year, but each with different emphasis for different sponsors.

"Preview for the Future" by Championship Racefilms for D.A. Lubricants & Bowes Seal Fast.

"The 52nd 500" by Dynamic Films for PepsiCo Frito-Lay.

"Racing Revolution" by Allend'or Productions for STP Corporation.

You'll see Jim Hurtubise and the PepsiCo Frito-Lay Special, the last of the roadsters, and of course the three car Granatelli STP turbine team of controversial "turbine wedges"!

Hope you enjoy this.  Please leave comments, and I'll post a few more of the ones I have.

Please seed!
