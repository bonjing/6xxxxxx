Doesn't really matter wether it is Pal or Ntsc does it. Is complete with any extra's.  I have lot's of phone numbers.  Doen't really give a damn who wins what cup.  Question do you drink tea or coffee from it?? "

The url you posted concerns burning PAL to dvd or copying to tape then posting it to someone who is going to try and play it on an Ntsc player and visa versa  so the url is right in what it says. But the big thing YOU are forgetting is the we are burning to disk through a computer and can change to which ever format we require.  So the remark ""Is it PAl or Ntsc"" Really is pointless isn't it !!"
