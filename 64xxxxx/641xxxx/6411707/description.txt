Militant Islam provides an innovative sociological framework for understanding
the rise and character of recent Islamic militancy. It takes a systematic
approach to the phenomenon, incorporating examples from around
the world.
A number of sociological concepts and theories are applied to militants
including those associated with social closure, social movements, nationalism,
risk, fear and â€˜decivilisingâ€™. These are examined within three main
themes; characteristics of militant Islam, multi-layered causes and the
consequences of militancy, in particular Western reactions within the â€˜war
on terrorâ€™. Interrelationships between religious and secular behaviour,
â€˜terrorismâ€™ and â€˜counter-terrorismâ€™, popular support and opposition are
explored. Throughout the book, examples from across Muslim societies
and communities are drawn upon, enabling the popular tendency to concentrate
upon â€˜al-Qaâ€™idaâ€™ and the Middle East to be challenged.
This book will be of interest to students of Sociology, Political Science
and International Relations, in particular those taking courses on Islam,
religion, terrorism, political violence and related regional studies.
