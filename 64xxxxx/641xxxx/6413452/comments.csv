What's the point with a 1080p video if it gives me black bars on my screen?

Enlighten me!"

@Attakny

Maybe because this movie is in the standard format 2.35:1, like every other modern movie (well, some are in 1.85:1), while your screen is in 16:9 or 16:10 or 4:3.

The point is that you can do a little research by yourself on movie format, before asking like that.."
