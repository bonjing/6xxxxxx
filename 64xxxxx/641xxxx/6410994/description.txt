This is my first torrent I have ever uploaded, however I took the time to 

read everything on TPB so I can understand eveything. I have so much stuff 

I can share when it comes to movies well programs to but those really for 

the most part torrent I gathered over time. I just felt it time I do my 

part in seeding instead of leeching all the time.

other movies I have that I could upload if requested.
