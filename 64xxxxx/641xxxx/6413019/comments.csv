,rkidd,2011-05-22T17:13Z,"why do i keep gettin torrent error (11004, getaddinfo failed) for only these peacemaker torrents o.0?

,HillOfBrains,2011-05-22T17:15Z,"@Nepotu
Size is not the problem. But everybody gets stuck at 95,2%, so pls help with availability a little longer. :)"
[V],Nepotu,2011-05-22T19:37Z,"I don't know why it stucks there. From my point of view this torrent have 381 seeders (they don't stuck I supose). The other torrent at this time has 83,5 % disponibility and going up."
