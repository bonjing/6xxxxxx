,mirkamp,2011-05-28T10:24Z,"okee thnx for the info, works great by the way! great torrent. "
,mirkamp,2011-05-28T10:46Z,"xxThugxx still got a question, did you put the whole voice pack into the copilot torrent from only europe? Cause the voice dont speak every turn but only on main roads i think? do you know of thats normal? i used it so far only in the netherlands. Greetz thnx"
,mirkamp,2011-05-28T10:59Z,"xxThugxx still got a question, the voice guidance dont speak every turn and only on the main roads i think. Is this normal for copilot or are there maybe parts missing? i hope you can tell me. i downloaded your orther torrent from 2010 only europe maps. For so far I used it only in the netherlands.  

ps: what do you think is the best navigation for android?

,Z_V,2011-05-29T18:17Z,"xxThuggxx, Any chance of you doing copilot for trucks? They want like 149.00 for it. "
,georgekg,2011-06-01T22:34Z,"can I use just maps from this release, for win version of copilot live 8?"
,Z_V,2011-06-03T04:32Z,I don't believe you can. Windows has no idea what an .apk file is or what to do with it. I could be wrong and if so someone will clear it up for you.
