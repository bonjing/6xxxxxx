,jorgy2612,2011-06-22T22:03Z,"Amazing torrent! just wondering though, i wasn't sure where i could request torrents but could you please upload a torrent of Josephine Collective's We Are The Air album in 320kbps? and Satellites & Sirens' Self-Titled album in 320kbps?"
,HMD3,2011-06-23T02:39Z,"Those artists don't sound like my cup o' tea, but for requests, go to the forums here http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=46 create a user if you haven't yet, usually they find what you're looking for."
,Gimpy13,2011-06-25T06:28Z,"hmmm...forgot their original 1995 album Wave of Popular Feeling.  was from WAY before they were signed. Is pretty rare, but can find it online probably.  Only reason I know it exists is because I have it.  Not great stuff either, it was like Silverchair, but stoned and uninspired at that point.

Thx for the up dude!"

,mr_krueger,2012-01-09T15:20Z,"HMD3, Very good download, 500x500 art, 100% complete/Accurate ID3's, 320kbps and etc. But why do you have in almost all the torrents of music never numbered tracks? Is it so hard to do? For example:
01 - blabla
02 - blabla
If laziness, that is a great utility ""eags on!"". Takes the information from the tags and renames the file as follows:
Track Num - Song Name (01 - blabla bla)
freeware. The program can be downloaded from here https://sites.google.com/site/wodmor/home/Eags_On.zip

Thanks for all your downloads"
