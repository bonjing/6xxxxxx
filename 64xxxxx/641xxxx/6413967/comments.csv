,mfharis,2011-05-25T23:46Z,"English Description: When the Muslims (Moors) Ruled in Europe. A must watch for anyone interested in the history of modern day Science and Technology and of course, Al-Andalus (Spain). 

The contributions made by the Muslims of Spain during 8th-13th century. ItÎ“Î“Ã©Â¼Î“Ã¤Ã³s interesting to note that modern day Spaniards are only now beginning to realize and  appreciate their Moorish history which is incredible in sense when you consider how Muslims during their pinnacle has contributed to the society across the World, 
but at least the process has begun. The Spaniards of ancestral age were deliberately intent on hiding the Muslim History and achievements made by Muslims and Islam.

How many islamic states can show off great hospitals and universities? What about womens rights and freedom of speech and religion? It's all....gone? Was it ever there? Or did islamic hordes steal all this ""knowledge"" from their captives? Yes, that is the truth. This is...islamic propaganda! "
