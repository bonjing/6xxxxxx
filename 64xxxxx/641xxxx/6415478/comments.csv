http://download.theforce.net/games/starwars_thebattleofendor_v21.exe

You can also get Battle of Yavin plus the Graphics/Sound upgrade created by TMaster_Syrus
from your yellow ""here"" link under it."

A dual core machine runs this game very fast, a single core under 1.5GHz will be noticeably  slower, so it serves a purpose besides being a game. It will reveal hardware driver issues instantly."
