::NOTES:::::::::
Pre-announcing a new group, EP1C. This is a unofficial first release.. Our official first release thats coming soon we will have further details about EP1C and what we stand for. Work done: Some spots are a little dark but trying to brighten it up I decided against it, made the blacks to artificial.

Instead I wrote a AVS script to bring out the detail a bit because it was a little cartoonish. Audio is ours, very nice full stereo. Pretty quick and easy sync job.    

Repacked because this version has hard coded english subs for all the Spanish speaking parts. 122 lines of it. Enjoy. //iNK Sample was cut from previous version.. sorry.. its all there.
