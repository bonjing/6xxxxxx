Every Woman is a Tree is dedicated to the women of Iraq, whose children cling to
their branches for protection during this time of war. It asks the brutal
question of what happens to the children when the branches are cut and the tree
is killed, as well as questions of leadership and societal upbringing. The six
musicians of Angles make this a personal matter through their music, as each
track is unified by the sense that the men are all deeply affected by current
worldly affairs. From the opening piece, an overwhelming frustration and even
disgust with the world's current state is apparent. The music depicts a
21st-century depression: a poverty of life and mercy augmented by a wealth of
war, violence and terror.

Magic from Sweden, published in Portugal. This Swedish band consists of Johan
Berthling on double bass, Kjell Nordeson on drums, Magnus Broo on trumpet,
Martin Kuchen on alto sax, Mats Aleklint on trombone and Mattias Stahl on
vibraphone. The band brings a strong anti-war album here, and an ode to women in
war-time, the "trees" that hold the families together. The music has this
unbelievable combination of energy, melodic beauty and emotional
sensitivity. Some of the tracks are wonderful, and possibly among the best I've
heard this year. The opening track starts with arco bass, followed by dramatic
and sad alto sax, with the vibes offering the right supportive touches, then the
rhythm instruments move into a unison theme, opening the floor for the rest of
the band to join in the sad melody. The bass also has a long intro for the
second track, now on pizzi, for another wailing and tearful theme by the rest of
the band. The title track is brilliant, with a strong and sweeping melody, very
moving and heartfelt, offering lots of possibilities for expansion, and played
in a wonderful African call-and-response mode, including percussive
polyrhythmics and a staggering trumpet solo by Broo. And the next piece is great
too, starting with a gut-wrenching sax solo by KÃ¼chen over a slow and bluesy
rhythm, which offers the right background for the ensuing vibe and trombone
solos. Those who know KÃ¼chen and Nordeson from their work with Exploding
Customer will find similarities in the music, albeit less joyful here of course,
and richer because of the additional instruments. The music is rhythmic,
melodic, with a clear structural approach of theme, improvisations and back to
theme, although a little more sophisticated than I describe it. But
compositional power is one thing, the major achievement is in the performance
itself, which is warm, sad and wonderful. A great album.
