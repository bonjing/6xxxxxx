,Ynobe,2011-05-23T08:41Z,Maybe an end of season finale?
,ust2,2011-05-23T14:14Z," Ah fck! Still not regular torrents uploaded for this episode!?!

 @Ynobe

,QborT,2011-05-23T19:33Z,"The NFO from the LOL rip somehow got mixed up with the 720p DiMENSiON rip.  

This is the .mkv hi-def rip, not the HDTV XviD .avi rip. 

Don't blame the uploader bots, this is not their mistake.


@ ust2  - what are you talking about ""someone else's copy""?  eztv doesn't make any of their own rips, they upload the scene release.  "
