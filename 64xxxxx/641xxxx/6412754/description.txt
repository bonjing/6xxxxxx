Rosetta Stone does NOT make a v3 of Thai. v3 is the only option. 

I have searched for these for a long time, and compiled this from three different torrents.

Instructions:
1. Burn the ISO in the folder labeled "Rosetta Stone V2 - Thai" or use your favorite ISO loader.
2. Run the program in the folder "Rosetta Stone V2 -Thai". No need to install or crack.
3. Enjoy!

This was tested on XP and Win 7. Appears to work normally.
