I have got a compaq presario laptop . it was recently formated , how ever after formating the resolution is very bad , pictures appear skewed .Also windows update does not work .can u advice?"
,yosoyusuario,2011-05-25T07:48Z,"Maybe this tips coul help You:
1. If You installed xp, You need to install the drivers for your laptop. The easiest way to do so is installing a program like driver genius, driver checker, etc (both of them can be found in this page). After installing the program, conect to the internet and the software is gonna look for the drives You need. 
2. If installed xp and your laptop supports windows 7, It is much easier if You format your laptop and install 7.
3. You can also search for download the package of drivers among the torrents in this or any other web. Once downloaded, install them.
4. You can conect by internet to the official website of compaq, insert the data of your laptop (serie, model, etc) and searcha for the drivers You need (I am not expert, but if You say your problem is visualization, then You need the graphic drivers, for example). Be careful to download drivers only form safe sites. Remember drivers are program, so a if there is a virus, you're gonna be in serious trouble. In the case of The Pirate Bay. the trsutable uploaders are the one with a skull (like Arulkarthik. Good luck, man. By the way, thanks to the uploader for this torrent. "

,D3M0N1NMYH34D,2011-05-28T22:09Z,"So this is pretty much the same exact install file that you get from the official website. No crack, no searial. 

Why would anyone download an install this?
It's almost surely backdoored."
,SpeedyUp,2011-05-30T02:12Z,"@D3M0N1NMYH34D
What are you talking about? It does contains a crack."
,Zasurus,2011-05-30T10:38Z,"Thanks keygen works fine (didn't scan for viruses though ran keygen in sandbox) I already had 3.3.1 installed from DisplayFusion's site and pasted key in and that worked perfectly!
THANKS again!"
,Electr0,2011-05-31T13:06Z,"It keys saying the License Key is invalid. Would you like to enter a new one.

What's the go?"
,SFYoda,2011-06-05T07:22Z,Key doesn't work for me ether. Anyone able to get a working key??

,DoTTGaMMa,2011-07-25T04:02Z,"I think this has been patched, or is incompatible with my set-up
I installed the version that came alongside the download (3.3.1.) did no updates or anything stupid... Installed it successfully, opened it up, tried to enter the generated key using different name text field inputs and I just keep getting this error:
WindowTitle= DisplayFusion
Text           = License Key Error:Sorry, your License Key is invalid.
                     Would you like to enter a new License Key?
Options       = YES & NO


My set-up is

And I ran everything using the ""Run as Administrator"" Mode, and I'm not a dumbass either.
This is not a virus by the way, the uploader submitted clean files, and is trusted by TPB staff.

Can you give some feedback on how to get around this, or re-upload a fixed version?
Thanks Anacondaz"
,DoTTGaMMa,2011-07-25T04:16Z,"FIXED!
The issue was that the Keygen was interfering with the Keystate of DisplayFusion.

To fix this just get your Serial/ License Key from the Keygen after entering your name, then close the Keygen. Now paste the key into DisplayFusion 3.3.1 and press ""OK"", and a success window will appear.

If you do not want to use the Keygen, or if you are still experiencing issues with it, just keep the Keygen closed and enter the License Key below:

,cjlalo,2011-08-13T15:57Z,@Faetoner....Thanks for the key. 
,vinniec,2011-09-23T19:27Z,"HELP PLEASE!
I when I enter in a key using the keygen or the ones that have been posted in the comments, the key works: ""Thank You for Registering"". However, after a bit of time, a window pops up and says the key is invalid. When I reenter a different key, same thing happens; accepts then says its invalid later

any help would be amazing"
,vinniec,2011-09-23T19:29Z,"*edit*
also after I uninstall display fusion, and the re-install, all my settings are still there. How do I delete and start fresh?"
,ultraVert,2011-09-29T23:15Z,"Works just fine, thanks Anacondaz, and Dottgamma!"
,Skyywolf3,2011-10-20T06:21Z,"faetoner,

I fucking love you, that serial means that you don't even have to download the torrent.  You can grab a legit copy of displayfusion off of their site or cnet, go to enter a serial, ctrl v, bam, pro version, without ever having to download a torrent.
Beautiful.

,v1d9uy,2011-11-09T21:04Z,worked great for me
,DirtArmy,2012-01-13T20:49Z,Works great.  Downloaded in like two seconds and the KeyGen worked like a charm.  Thanks for the upload!
,74cam,2012-02-20T17:35Z,"Works, but it knows it's pirated if you let it communicate with the internet.
After a successful installation, I got a message saying the key is invalid, even though it's still working and the keygen was closed after getting the serial. The message said something about piracy, and then about me not stealing from a faceless corporation, but an individual who designs the software to provide for his family and some more typical yada-yada. I might just shell out the $25 in a few weeks, it's not like it's a $50 video game or the EXTREMELY overpriced Microsoft windows after all"
,BiERPuNK,2012-02-23T01:33Z,"@DoTTGaMMa,

Thanks, that worked for me too (and i am running the newer v3.4.0). I felt really stupid that just closing the keygen helped, but it did!"
,Darkman802,2012-03-11T13:56Z,"If anyone needs it here is a key for v3.4.1

And remember to block binaryfortress.com in your hosts file."
,13thFlame,2012-03-12T06:01Z,How do i block binaryfortress.com in hosts file?

Thanks! Works 100%!"
,mntlcase,2012-04-15T18:50Z,"If you're getting the ""Invalid Key"" popup, the hosts file block isn't enough. Block the displayfusion.exe executable file via an ""Outbound"" connection block in the Windows firewall.

If it works, you should get an error when the programs tries to check for an update or you initiate a manual update."
,XenonKilla,2012-04-21T17:44Z,"You guys having issues with the program detecting your serial.....

• Go into DisplayFusion Settings
• Select the ""Options"" tab at the very top
• Click on ""Internet Connection Settings""
• Select ""Use Custom Proxy Server Settings""
• Then for ""Server Address"" use ""127.0.0.1"" and you can leave ""Port"" at ""8080"" and everything else blank

Problem Solved =)"
