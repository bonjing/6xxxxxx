,moshster,2011-05-23T09:35Z,Looked like usual Bluray quality to me
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-24T02:16Z,Then you are blind. It's an awful upscale.
,renison7,2011-09-15T17:01Z,Its a fucking R5 -1 for misnaming. I don't think the blue ray is out yet. It is playing in the theatre in Australia. If this is a brrip it is the russian or german retail and should be named R5 brrip.

OR: BOZX had a bad day picking bad preview pics.
