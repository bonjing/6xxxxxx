Despite the Western worldâ€™s increasing cultural diversity, there are still many who have geography-class preconceptions about the shape, size and color of the package in which theyâ€™ll find an indigenous treat. Multilingual singer/songwriter Yael Naim confounds preconceptions like these on the self-titled release she created in her apartment with co-producer David Donatien. Recording the songs at home wasnâ€™t merely economical, it allowed for complete creative freedom. The fruits of that freedom are audible in the duoâ€™s original blend of European, American and Middle Eastern musical elements. 

Naimâ€™s breakthrough came when her English-language song â€œNew Soulâ€ was used in an Apple laptop commercial, fittingly sparking an avalanche of digital downloads. But the bulk of her album is darker and sung in Hebrew, which the singer learned while growing up in Israel. Ironically, it was her return to Franceâ€”her country of birthâ€”that provided the gestation for her personal artistic voice. Naimâ€™s decision to write and sing her composition â€œParisâ€ mostly in Hebrew was a move of intuition, she saysâ€”a key factor in her creative process. Because Naimâ€™s primary musical influences were classic American pop and soul, she had been writing exclusively in English. But a growing need to reconnect with her Israeli roots and resolve her ambivalence about living in France led her to write in her oldest and most personal tongue. Naim claims that composing with Hebrew words accesses her simplest and most emotional workâ€”songs like the wistful â€œLachlom.â€ 

Commonly, Hebrew music is linked to Judaism. Naimâ€™s globe-spanning pop bears no such connection, though the sense of homelessness embodied in certain songs does parallel the longing behind traditional and mournful Jewish songs. In Naimâ€™s music, though, spirituality is only subtly implied. When translated, Naimâ€™s impressionistic lyrics sometimes find her floating in dreamlike states or meditating in the stillness of dawn. Her now-internationally famous track, â€œNew Soul,â€ emerged when Naim dismissed her formerly held belief in reincarnation. On the humble but affirming song, she sings of the fumbling attempts to live well that convinced her she must be starting from scratch after all. (Iâ€™m a new soul/ I came to this strange world/ Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take/ But since I came here/ Felt the joy and the fear/ Finding myself making every possible mistake.â€)

â€œFar Farâ€ is a seemingly autobiographical cut that describes a girl awakening to artistic gifts she believes are an answer to prayer. Then, turning philosophical, she describes the introspective process by which art is created: by embracing oneâ€™s contradictions in tandem with oneâ€™s abilities. (â€œFrom time to time there are colors and shapes/ Dazzling her eyes and tickling her hands/ They invent her a new world with oil sky and aquarel rivers/ But donâ€™t you run away already/ Please donâ€™t go/ How can you stay outside?/ Thereâ€™s a beautiful mess insideâ€¦â€)   

In the CDâ€™s booklet, thereâ€™s a picture of Naim sitting on a pillow, intensely engaged with a toy keyboard. This is a perfect representation of the music, which combines the artistry of a mature musician with the playful and unselfconscious spirit of a precocious child. Her effortlessly culture-blurring sound suggests that it truly is a small world after all.
