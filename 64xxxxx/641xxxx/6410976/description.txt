Photographic Workflow refers to all the activities that occur between the initial image capture and the final destination of your photograph. Photographers have very different workflows, depending on the volume of shooting they do and what the photographs will be used for. Your workflow might be as simple as downloading images from your camera's memory card and printing them on a printer attached to your computer. Or, it may include the addition of keywords and star ratings to search and sort your images, image adjustments and corrections, backup and archiving, printing locally and sharing your photography on the web or sending your files to printing service bureaus or pre-press facilities for final printing. Bibble Pro 5 supports a wide range of workflow options and working styles to ensure that you can get the best quality from your photographs in the least amount of time.
