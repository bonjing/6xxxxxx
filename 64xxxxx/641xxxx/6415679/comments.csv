,samanika,2011-05-29T06:24Z,"Just installed it today. Theres almost no changes in this from the standard Windows 7. Heres what Ive noticed so far

IE9 is installed by default. Theres a new icon down by the clock that gives you direct access to your windows user account settings. Theres a new tool in control panel called History vault, looks like it can back up documents to local drive or network drive. Also an icon in control panel called ""location and sensors"". Looks like they are building in accelerometer/gps support."
