Some people prefer seeing shots before starting the download. And going trough the trouble to first download only the jpg's is really not worth it considering the broad selection available.
I asume, as an uploader, you want people to download your torrent. If this is the case, it's your job to make the downloaders decision wether to download your torrent or not as easy as possible, as otherwise they will simply look on. 
I know I will."
