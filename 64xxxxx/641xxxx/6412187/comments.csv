,IQuitSmoking,2011-05-25T22:48Z,"@arulkarthik - First let me say salute for the great torrents you have on here. I just picked this one up and it seemed to work at first and a lil pop up message in the bottom right corner of my screen comes on and tells me the name of the registrant. I then went to go back in the program, at a later time, and it asked serial and it said the one in the folder didn't work. I am new to this but not entirely but feel free to let me know if I've done something wrong. I really need this program so any help would be infinitely appreciated. Great work once again. "
,snarkster,2011-08-05T00:39Z,"This is not working for me on Windows 7 Ultimate. It starts and shows the registration box in the lower right but then crashes before the program loads.

Can you make a new portable with the latest version? Or a Keygen?"
,snarkster,2011-08-05T00:47Z,"This wasn't working for me at first on Windows 7 Ultimate. It would launch but then crash just after the splash screen. Then I tried to ""Run as Administrator"" and it fired up. Thanks!

Can you find a serial number or keygen for a traditional instal of this?"
