,Pulverpojken,2011-07-13T22:01Z,"Is Season 14 Fiji REALY complete? Because the other ""complete"" torrent doesn't include the most important part of the whole season, the part when they vote for the winner and read the votes. 

A whole season ruined."

,Basiclife,2011-09-18T22:16Z,"Any chance of more seeders? Some seasons aren't complete with those currently online.

Many thanks"
,txediter,2011-10-06T03:20Z,"I want to congratulate all the current seeders for their extreme patience. Thank you for hanging in there for all the time it took to finish downloading this torrent. 

I can't explain my situation (perhaps similar to panamalynn), but it's impossible for me to keep my end up and running 24/7, or check in here very often. Again, thank you!
