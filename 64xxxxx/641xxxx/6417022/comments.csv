,clastro,2011-06-27T15:17Z,"I cant seem to play this file. Only the sample works.
DL'ed cccp and many other codecs and also vlc but still cant get this to work"
[V],IndexTrance,2011-07-06T18:08Z,"WTF!? What do you think? It's about 30 GiB difference Between this release and HDLiTE's .. Offcource this release is better but the size is way to big for others to download .. I don't have a problem with these filesizes but hey, you're just an ordinary piece of shit! At least HDLiTE have used a little more software for their release than just bandwidth like you do .. Grow up!"
,jessez,2011-07-15T01:17Z,Anyone able to get one of the episodes to play? Anyone who already downloaded this please tell us 43.6 gigs is gona take a long time no matter what speed

It is NOT better than HDLite & is 4 times the size
The video is very grainy/noisy in many scenes"
