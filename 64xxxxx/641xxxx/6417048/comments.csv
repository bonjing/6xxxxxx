,G.i.a.n.t,2011-05-24T11:54Z,Thanks for making that video .. Explains everything .. Now i just need to wait for 15 hours (because its downloading at 100 kbps) and make sure that it works .. will comment after the download finishes .
,brianxxx,2011-05-24T16:58Z,"Thanks! 

AMD CPU version or guide or fixes?"
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-05-24T18:16Z,seed seed zzz ..
,mov03,2011-05-25T00:33Z,"Not working.
When booting up, the error message is: ""MAC OS X is not supported with software virtualization. To Run Mac OS X you need a hostï»¿ on wich VMware Workstation supports hardware virtualization""

I run vmWare 7.1.4 on Dell-AMD hardware; Leopard image loads OK, as well as linux and all Windows OSes I tried.

Something is probably wrong with this image."
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-05-25T06:26Z,"Working properly .. Running on intel - i5 with 4gb  .. Except the fact that its a bit laggy , everything is perfect ( Not ur problem though ) .. Its better if we watch the tutorial first and do everything according to that .. 
However i don't think that the updates are working .. It is showing that my build is 11a390 and the latest version is 11a459e (DP 3) .. And whenever i try to update its showing that there are no updates available ..
@mov03 - This version might not support amd"
,mov03,2011-05-27T04:45Z,"@G.i.a.n.t
Indeed, it might be a CPU problem. Thank you."
,itzyup,2011-05-30T13:09Z,account password?????????????????
,itzyup,2011-05-30T13:10Z,ACCOUNT PASSWORD????
[T],SoulUploader,2011-05-31T00:39Z,"@itzyup There is no password set to start with, it's up to you to set it."
[T],SoulUploader,2011-05-31T00:40Z,"@G.i.a.n.t It doesn't automatically update DP through ASU, you have to manually download the .dmg through the dev portal"
[T],SoulUploader,2011-05-31T00:40Z,"For all those asking about problems with the AMD processors, hit up the video link and there's a linked fix."
,enjourni,2011-06-04T18:05Z,"""MAC OS X is not supported with software virtualization""

Either you people have a cracked VMware or how are you bypassing this check? Can't load any Mac OS in VMware."
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-06-07T18:05Z,"for those ppl who r having software virtualization problems , watch that video .. It shows exactly how to crack it .."
,WickedBetrayal,2011-06-07T20:19Z,"I need some help... Any of my keypresses on my keyboard in the OS in VMWare just does random numbers. any key i press no matter what it is﻿ goes from 0 to 9 and repeats. Shift+ any key equals the symbol variant.

Also, audio does not work... I have an IDT audio codec driver but I do not know how much good that does me or you.

Help pleasizzle?"
,WickedBetrayal,2011-06-08T01:15Z,"I can confirm that it is an issue on my side as i have tried another virtual machine and it does the same.

I tried it on this and a Leopard build i downloaded today. My laptop (dv7t-4000) keyboard as well as a usb keyboard both do the issue. 

Has anyone had similar issues?"
,mirzasghar,2011-06-11T13:31Z,"Error :/

""The guest opreating﻿ system is not Mac OS X Server. The virtual machine will power off""

What i﻿ can do??????????????"
,DayElf,2011-07-09T22:46Z,"Thanks man, finally I have a working Lion Virtual Machine, now I just need to get sound."
,OZZ1E,2011-07-10T16:41Z,".exe I expect this is a virus then, can anyone confirm?"
,abryanbt,2011-07-22T00:01Z,"So, this is Lion that comes on all the new Macs? Not a beta or anything?"
,abryanbt,2011-07-22T06:28Z,Will I need VMware Workstation?!
,bryanperez51,2011-07-26T18:17Z,How do I install this on a virtual machine
,SuperNiFF,2011-08-21T11:04Z,"Works perfectly on an i7, under windows7 x64.

The ""Lion user"" account has an empty password, but what's the root password?

If I run sudo it prompts for a password, but an empty password is not accepted there."
,16031984,2011-08-25T15:31Z,Works like a charm. Watch the video definitely. Run the VMWare unlocker. Installing XCode now for iPhone development :) thanks OP
,ollonkorren,2011-08-27T15:44Z,"@SuperNiFF:
I believe you need to set an account password to use the sudo command, since it won't accept an empty password even though that is the set account password."

Thx man! Perfect!"
,ios_dev,2011-11-29T22:35Z,I installed xcode but then when you start it gives error and closes. Anyone knows why?
,simoneast,2012-01-15T07:24Z,"Yeah, it doesn't seem to run the latest Xcode when installed from the App Store (now free).  It could possibly be because this is the GM version, not the retail one.  Not sure about the process of upgrading to retail.  Will play with it when I get some time."
,aadarshbohara,2012-01-29T14:11Z,"hey, can some one please update the link of the video..??
