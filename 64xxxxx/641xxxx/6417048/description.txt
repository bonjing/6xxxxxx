Okay, so instead of all those people out there trying to get Mac OS X Lion running under Windows properly, I've prebuilt an image (which works like 100%) for you all to use instead :) Just run the .exe and it'll self extract and open the VM in VMware (or whatever you use). 

Oh yeah, and this is Mac OS X Lion 10.7. When every new build of Mac comes out I think I'm gonna upload a new image.
