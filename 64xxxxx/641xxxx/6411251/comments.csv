,believenu,2011-05-21T13:51Z,"hey doyll, have an open mind , you may actually like it...naaa to much like every other shoot em up car chasing.. oops no thats cop/car chasing movies for guys. Moral is... we watch guy stuff that tends to be all alike too. SWMBO will like this one ending with a twist.. kids irritate though."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T14:28Z,"@doyll: Camelot 1x01 was upped -  four times. Day after airing, that week Weekly Pack, two weeks later requested, re-upped in next Daily, then again in Weekly of that week."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-21T20:20Z,"Borgias too. Upped, requested and re-upped.

Then announced as been dropped and brought back upon many requests.

Go for big ones, tough."
