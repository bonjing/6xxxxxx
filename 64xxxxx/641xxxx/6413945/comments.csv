,gregsolo,2011-06-05T00:39Z,Wow.  This is pretty awesome.  Thank you friend.
,after.h0urs,2011-07-04T15:47Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I'm not familiar with FLAC beyond what I've just googled--is there a way to split the files into individual tracks? Can someone recommend software for that?

Much appreciated!"
,BitchyNit,2011-07-23T22:24Z,"that's brilliant, thank U so much :o)"
,biteyticket,2011-09-12T23:35Z,"Just watched Who Is Harry Nilsson online. Great talent, great upload."

,ProphetZarquon,2012-01-04T02:43Z,"@after.h0urs  Or try Audacity.  Not the easist thing ever, but a very good audio editing solution and totally free.  Audacity is to CoolEdit Pro 2 as the GIMP is to PhotoShop 6"
,ProphetZarquon,2012-01-04T03:22Z,"Wahoo, thanks yanek231!
Really great upload here.  I've been wanting The Point for months now.  Since May, come to think of it...

I personally prefer discrete high bitrate MP3s for compatibility, but I can't complain about FLAC!  (I'd rather complain that more devices should support FLAC.)

My audio normalization went nuts on the spoken word albums, so turn that stuff off for this high fidelity storytime, dig?"
,punk333,2012-03-30T19:45Z,"I'm sorry but why are these 1-track flacs? That is probably the absolute worst way to do a discography... now it's impossible to find differences between the different issues. Just two questions:
1. What the hell were you thinking?
2. Are these from vinyls, and you had no way to separate the tracks? 
A little clarification could go a long way... also WARNING a user before downloading 6 GBs would be nice too..."
