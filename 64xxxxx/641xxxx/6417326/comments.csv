,ScoreGods,2011-07-17T19:57Z,"The real untouched albums are rare to find therefore I would love to see 

Wave or Flac uploads

MP3s are often poorly encoded even provided in 320 

Therefore leave master composers untouched and provide them in original quality which come from the best encoders, best recordings and finnaly best masterings which you guys cannot top 

trying to do so will end in fails - 


upload master composers in an untouched quality

thx
