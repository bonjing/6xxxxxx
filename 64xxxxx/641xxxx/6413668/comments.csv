I have been unable to connect...bgeen hit or miss for the past 2 weeks.

I think Comcast is blocking, even though they claim no to be doing so.

Friend of mine down the road with FIOS had no problems. If I log in from his house, no problems either.

Another friend with Comcast has had similar problems and he is 20 miles away! 

Going to start using a proxy maybe!"
