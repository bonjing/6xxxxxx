,Kyle2011anon,2011-06-13T08:10Z,Nice. 20 minutes is not bad for a whole discography. Much appreciated. May take it awhile but I'll try to seed. IDK my UL sucks major balls and I can't stop FW from trying to seed every little thing I DL so the cache is up to 17 and some of them are god damn huge.
,Ultrahorizon,2011-08-03T00:21Z,"Great torrent :) but you haven't got ""Lost it All"" :)"
,Wraymando,2011-08-19T05:42Z,"Wrong, this isnt Discography from 2001- 2011 because you forgot the Diamonds in the Rough and Live in the Lbc album "
,callume,2011-08-23T18:18Z,Its studio albums not live albums in this torrent :D
,karlocool,2011-09-21T02:53Z,Thanks :) 
,fearrising10,2011-10-07T02:17Z,"It's a fucking virus, don't open it. Deleted the drivers for my sound device/speakers, and it won't let me go to microsoft.com (key factor that it is a virus)"
,OOZMAN,2011-10-11T04:12Z,@fearrising10 its not a virus dont listen to this troll/noob
,asteink,2011-10-12T01:45Z,Buried Alive off nightmare is @ a super low bitrate as is the new single but other than that great up!
,fearrising10,2011-10-15T05:56Z,Well then how do you explain why my computer got fucked the minute this torrent finished downloading?
,uniform42,2011-10-31T03:10Z,@fearrising10 Did you actually scan the file before downloading it?  Or determine that the original infected files were part of the torrent?  Coincidental timing does not beget fault.
,faeruszorander,2012-01-14T08:55Z,"@fearrising10   lol m8, your such a noob, pack it up, ship it back to apple, as you clearly belong in amishland wielding wooden tools and dating chicks with beards... great upload callume, keep up the good work"

,Dark_Fields,2012-05-08T00:24Z,"I know someone said its 48kb quality, but i'm presuming that's not the bit rate, so what's the bit-rate?"
