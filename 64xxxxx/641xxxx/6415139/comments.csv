,Fuqthegovt,2011-10-26T21:34Z,"@kadirooo there is very little 1080p anything yet (it isn't even broadcast in that except for very few satellite stations). Simple reason is you won't be able to tell the difference from 1080i or 720p unless you have a 70""+ hdtv (or are playing a video game on you smaller tv). And very few do. This is especially true for cartoons since they simply ignore drawing the details that 720p won't reproduce anyway."
