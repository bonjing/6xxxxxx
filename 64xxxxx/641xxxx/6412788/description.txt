At 20, Alessi Laurent-Marke is prodigious (she's already put out several EPs and one studio album, 2009's Notes from the Treehouse) and precocious too. Because while her voice is sweetly girlish and breathy, her songs â€“ weightless, but deftly made folk songs â€“ are very grownup. "Blanket" is a true spine-tingler, but she can do swing with sweetness too: one of the album's highlights is a cover of "Maybe I Know", a slower and more intense version of Lesley Gore's lilting 1964 hit that brings even more pathos to the admission, "maybe I know that he's been a'cheating".
