,Billythebat,2011-05-23T10:03Z,"Its VTV mate, look at the green skull and the name. 

That why there is no comments as it is a given to the quality and the source."
,emmawashi,2011-05-23T10:04Z,"@ wyckd 
VTV is a top torrent provider (also generally speaking when you see a green skull next to the uploader's name it should be good)  and yes, in this case,  it is a good torrent."
[T],artpepper,2011-05-23T10:11Z,"@wykd, I guess you're new here. Otherwise you'd know that a green skull beside an uploader's name means you're getting exactly what it says on the tin..."

,bondjing,2012-04-19T02:49Z,The Borgias has turned into my favorite new show. The Borgias isn't burdened with the endless genealogy of GOT's.
