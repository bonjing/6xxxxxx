,raymond_u,2011-05-22T06:21Z,why is it 1440x1080? That's a weird resolution

1440 is what the beeb is broadcasting. Probably some kind of ""anamorphic"". Come to think of it the BBC probably got nothing to do with it. I'm guessing it's the cameras Formula One Management are using for the global feed."
,SzaliS,2011-05-22T13:19Z,"Thanks for your work, would it be possible to keep the original interlacing? [i guess it is transmitted that way] 25fps is too slow for F1.
But enough for the interviews :)"

LOL, you kiddin` me?
Your geography knowledge is very poor jorrell."
,jorrell0733,2011-05-22T16:38Z,"RE: Joakim. The Sound is NOT out of sync mate, must be your system.."
,jorrell0733,2011-05-22T16:39Z,"RE:grz911, Yeah so a slight typo error on the text documents dude, no big deal. I think the file itself's the important part dont you think?"
,jorrell0733,2011-05-22T16:41Z,RE: SzaliS. The original broadcast resolution is 1440x1080@25fps. Not much point in trying to double deinterlace to 50 as the source format is 25. Sorry
,grz911,2011-05-22T18:28Z,"A typo involves simple duplication, omission, transposition, or substitution of a small number of characters.

So what you say jorrell is that you wanted to type ""Spanish"" and the result was ""Turkish""? That's a copy/paste error, DUDE, NOT a typo, LOL.

You got issues understanding/using words, too, jorrell.

BTW: Did you upgrade your dial-up 56kbps internet connection?"
