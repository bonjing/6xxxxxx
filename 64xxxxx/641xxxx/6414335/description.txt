Live from the 1974 Montreux Jazz Festival, blues legends Buddy Guy and Junior Wells joined forces with Bill Wyman, (Rolling Stones), Terry Taylor (Rhythm Kings), Dallas Taylor (Crosby, Stills And Nash) and Pinetop Perkins (Muddy Waters) for a rampaging set of R & B that has passed into festival legend. With Guy's guitar and Junior's harp at their blues-wailing best, satisfaction is definitely guaranteed.
