I was sick of the laughable "256kbps" transcode from MySpace torrent or wherever it was recorded from.  The quality of that torrent (seemingly the only one around) is 128kbps at best.  It also has a browser "click" heard in "Little Big Man."  

I've never been a huge proponent of vinyl to MP3, but I think this one turned out alright.  I paid for the album but wanted a good quality portable version.  Torrents usually do the trick, though surprisingly no high quality ones to be found for this one.  And why Fat Wreck sometimes includes download cards, yet other times not, is beyond me)

Source: 120gram black vinyl @ 33rpm
Turntable: Kenwood KD-3055 w/ replaced cartridge & stylus (brand escapes me)
Phono pre-amp -> USB sound interface
Recording software: Audacity
MP3 Encoder: Itunes 

This is my first torrent. Bitching about lack of info, how you dislike Ben Weasel (even if rightfully so) -or anything for that matter- is futile.  

Enjoy.

First World Manifesto

by Kyle Ryan March 15, 2011 (AV Club)


Rightly heralded over its 25 years as one of the great pop-punk bands, Screeching Weasel has wrung a handful of classic albums out of an existence marred by frequent lineup changes and breakups, legal fights, and the vicissitudes of mercurial frontman Ben Weasel. The only constants have been Weasel and guitarist John Jughead, but First World Manifestoâ€”Screeching Weaselâ€™s first album since 2000â€™s forgettable Teen Punks In Heatâ€”finds Weasel without Jughead for the first time. He and frequent Screeching Weasel guitarist/bassist Dan Vapid are quick to note that Jughead never wrote any music, so his absenceâ€”following a lengthy legal disputeâ€”isnâ€™t noteworthy.

Fans would likely disagree if First World Manifesto werenâ€™t Screeching Weaselâ€™s best album since its early-â€™90s heyday. Well producedâ€”a rarity in the Weasel discographyâ€”by The All-American Rejectsâ€™ Mike Kennerty, itâ€™s full of catchy, concise songs nicely layered with backup vocals, organ, and subtle flourishes. The album works because of the many moments where the elements align perfectly: the bandâ€™s signature simple guitar lead synching with the organ in â€œFrankengirlâ€; Weaselâ€™s vocals and the guitar at the end of â€œThree Lonely Daysâ€; the backup vocals in â€œBeginningless Vacation.â€ 

Lyrically, Ben Weasel remains crankier than ever, with his contempt for the scene that sustains him informing much of the album. He intended the opener, â€œFollow Your Leaders,â€ to be a â€œpoke in the eyeâ€ for punk scenestersâ€”though Fat Wreck Chords owner Fat Mike sees it more as a personal digâ€”and the theme continues on â€œFriday Night Nationâ€ and â€œLittle Big Manâ€ (which mentions Fat Mike by name). Itâ€™s a little wearying, mostly because Weasel doesnâ€™t realize thereâ€™s nothing bold about mocking scenesters, hipsters, or other caricatures. But no Screeching Weasel fan expects nuance from Ben Weasel. Fortunately, what fans do expectâ€”catchy, clever, anthemic pop-punk songsâ€”First World Manifesto has in spades.
