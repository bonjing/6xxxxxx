,cleft99,2011-05-21T03:10Z,"We're hoping that posting some of these episodes will bring other Passions posters out in the open, so we can re-seed dead torrents and, most of all, in search of the Passions Holy Grail -- Episode 1652, aired in the United States on Jan. 11, 2006 and Canada a day earlier. (Jan. 12 and 13, 2006 would be most welcome as well, on a slightly less grail-ish level.) We have other requests as well, as well as more shows to share if it's worth everyone's while.
