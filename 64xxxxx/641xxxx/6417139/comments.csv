Please seed. "
,hotrod666,2011-05-24T04:43Z,"sorry..
"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-05-24T15:33Z,Apology accepted. I'm not sure why you're apologising but I'll accept it anyway. Have a great day. 
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-05-24T18:26Z,This is being uploaded with a 1 gigabit broadband speed. You automatically get priority on the pieces when you have uploaded your previous piece so increase your upload speed and this will really fly.
[V],manOtor,2011-05-31T21:24Z,"Hey man, sup ;)?

I wonder if you could upload the rest of the Star Trek saga as well?

Star Trek - Deep Space Nine
Star Trek - Voyager
Star Trek - Enterprise

The Star Trek community and I would be greatful forever (and I could feature them in the KABLAM!!! :D )

Keep it up!
Cheers"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-01T01:40Z,"Mr. manOtor, long time no speak, nice new name. I'll sort out the Star Trek for you no worries."
,ZxDragon,2011-06-02T08:47Z,"Could you possibly upload or make a torrent containing all 7 seasons of house in HDTV? I don't want DVD-rips. Thanks!

Otherwise the deleted scenes are pretty sweet, =)"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-02T16:58Z,"ZXDragon. Do you mean the 1.09GB per episodes? The DVDRips are better quality than the HDTV 350MB episodes but the 1.09GB is marginally better. I haven't got any 1.09GB episodes so can't do it yet but I've recently bought a Panasonic 3D Plasma so in future there will be a lot more full HD uploads. Breaking Bad 1, 2 & 3 in Blu-ray is next up, then Voyager for the manO."
,yelloo,2011-06-04T12:07Z,Thanks Toilet_sniffer_V. Great upload!
,ashwin.terminator,2011-06-07T17:40Z,"hey guys, this is not spam! Instead of downloading this through BitTorrent which is slow for such large torrents, try Torrific.com. There, you only need to copy paste the link of the torrent and click on get. Then, if the torrent has been requested sometime in the past 2 weeks, it is readily available for direct download. And if now, it downloads it for you and then emails you when the files are available for direct download! :D I just tried it with this torrent and all the files are available for download! So download it from there and seed it here! :D Cheers! try it out, registration is free!"
,NoSpamAllowed1,2011-06-09T00:51Z,What program/settings did you use to do the DVDRip?

,katana536,2011-12-21T18:59Z,"Hi Sniffer
I am half way through this d/l avg down 450kB/s @ u/l avg 505kB/s so thank you for a very swift download.
Could I possibly ask you to U/L NCIS series?? If you do I will seed that one pretty much indefinitely when the missus isn't on her laptop :-) Many thanks"
,katana536,2011-12-22T17:09Z,"Hi TSV (sounds better than sniffer!!)
A quick question as I'm new to torrenting. I am currently seeding:- SG1, Atlantis, Lie To Me, Bones, House, Star Wars Deluxe Set and V. My question is... would you prefer I seed them all simultaneously at max upload speed or seed individually until a decent ratio is achieved. If I seed individually my U/L will obviously be quicker for that one torrent. I live in Eastern Europe and my D/L & U/L speeds are extremely good. I will seed until ALL of the torrents I have downloaded from you are at least 5:1. Any joy on my NCIS series request?? - Seasons Greetings :-)"
,lukeninja,2012-01-18T19:34Z,"Does anybody else have trouble finding the actual episodes when previewing the download? All I can find are the extras, the icon, TSV, and season 7. "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2012-02-04T06:42Z,"I don't mind how you seed as long as you do it. Many thanks.

Re the question of not finding the files. For some reason in the torrent it puts them in the extras file. When you download them they'll all be in the right place, I have no idea why it does this.   "
,greyz3r0,2012-02-20T01:46Z,"Thanks, but can any one seed please ? the torrent is very slow!

thanks again.!"
