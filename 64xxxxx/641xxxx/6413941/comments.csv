Jim Dale is a fascinating narrator. I have listened to these audiobooks twice in the course of 3 months. They're absolutely perfect if you have to do menial tasks and need to let your brain escape. The characters are lively and Jim Dale doesn't have one voice, but literally hundreds. 

The quality on these are perfect, and rosie1966 is well deserving of that pink skull. "

,Ben81311,2011-10-24T01:00Z,So who is the better narrator? The comments at the Steven Fry torrent suggest he's got a nice voice whereas Jim Dale torrents comments suggest he's better then Steven Fry.. I am getting confused.
