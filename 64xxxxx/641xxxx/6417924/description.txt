His tales and poems brim with psychological depth, almost painful intensity, and unexpected#8212;and surprisingly modern#8212;flashes of dark humor and irony.brbrThis anthology offers an exceptionally generous selection of Poe#8217;s short stories. It includes his famed masterpieces, such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and "The Purloined Letter," featuring Poe#8217;s great detective, Dupin; his insightful studies of madness "The Black Cat" and "The Tell-Tale Heart"; "The Gold-Bug," his delightful exercise in "code-breaking"; and important but lesser-known tales, such as "Bon-Bon," "The Assignation," and "King Pest." Also included are some of Poe#8217;s most beloved poems, haunting lyrics of love and loss, such as "Annabel Lee," nightmare phantasmagories such as "The Raven," and his grand experiment in translating sound into words, "The Bells."pBenjamin F. Fisher, Professor of English, University of Mississippi, is a longtime enthusiast of the works of Poe.
