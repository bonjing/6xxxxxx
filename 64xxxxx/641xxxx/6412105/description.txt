thx
Audio: Imagines Line thx


Encode:
Well the russian video was very good in scenes with daylight, but very very dark and lifeless in colouring in dark scenes. 
There is no way to do the whole movie with one setting for brightness without killing the daylight scenes.
So once again i had to cut the movie in parts and treat every part differently as needed.
That was a lot of work, believe me.
I corrected the wrong aspect, added a lot contrast and colouring for all dark parts, as you can see on the following screenshotcomparisons
I left the already good scenes at daylight nearly untouched

Imagines Line didnt fit to the russian video right away, had around 20 oose spots to fix to get everything nearly lipsync.
looks good now
prolly best version to get till new videosource arrives

btw: there is also a proper russian version out by now,which is worse than the first.

did i already mention that there are  no oose spots? :D
