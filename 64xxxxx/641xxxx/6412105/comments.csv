 The movie sucked. Compared to the last 3 this is garbage. Most of the original cast is gone etc "
,Fallerup,2011-05-27T07:36Z,"I don't know how people can say it's garbage. But to each their own I suppose. You know before you watch the movie that at least 2 of the original actors will not be in this movie, thats not most, thats 2 of about 5-7. You also know what it will be about if you watched nr. 3. or the trailer. I suppose they could have picked another actress instead PenĂŠlope Cruz, but it will be hard to beat Keira Knightley no matter whom you pick. So she's as good as any other. But like I said, to each their own, I liked this movie a lot.  "
,ogprimo,2011-05-27T08:04Z,good stuff

 Quality is what you'd expect, doesn't have any annoying flicker or anything atleast, just a little blurry and dark.

 Seems good enough for what is supposed to be a mediocre movie.

 Havn't had a chance to watch it on PS3 yet to see if it's Cinivia protected though, took too long to DL so that will have to wait 'til tomorrow night."
,racinjunki,2011-05-28T17:00Z,"First time I downloaded I got an error message. Tried to play the file in Nero and Win Media Player and there was no sound in either one. Deleted everything, downloaded a second time, all good, but there is still no sound. What am I missing? "
,ust2,2011-05-28T18:44Z," No Cinivia here.

 Gave it the 20min test run on PS3 this morning, and it didn't trigger the protection, so it looks good to go."
,ust2,2011-05-28T18:46Z," @racinjunki

 You're probably just missing some codecs.

 Easiest thing to do would be to just use a different player like VLC."

One of the funny things about this movie is that they made edward teach (black beard) the focus of it despite the fact that there is no record of him ever having killed anyone quite the contrary he was well known for his good treatment of crews from ships that he hijacked and he often let them go unharmed"

,Attakny,2011-07-11T21:23Z,"Thanks for the upload! Heard this movie was quite bad so I' not gonna pay for it unless it's good  ^^

For those of you complaining about the quality: It's a CamRip, which then was telesynced. Google it if you don't know what that is.

@helpme247
In your torrent client there should be a tab next to ""Down Speed"" called ""Up Speed. As long as there are some values there you are uploading. Once your files is 100% downloaded and there are still values in the ""Up Speed "" -tab, you're seeding. 

Firther to the left(or right, depending on your torrent client) there should be a tab called ""Ratio"". Your ratio should be at least 1,0, preferably 2,0 before you inted to delete ay torrents. That'll mean that you have seeded twice the amount you downloaded. This way the torrent won't die and more people can download.

@dartsmad180
If you don't have sound download VLC or Media Player Classic. I also recommend installing a codec pack, which will give your video player more supported file types. K-Lite codec pack is a good choice. Just google it."
