,alle53,2011-05-26T20:57Z,this was pretty awesome when they show 3d movies and it comes a big fish called something like potato cod
,carnetic,2011-11-01T12:39Z,"Wow, thank you for making such high quality downloads available. These are perfect for my LG LED TV. Thank you :-)"
,joedish,2011-11-29T02:38Z,Thanks for the LG 3d uploads. We appreciate your efforts. Would you be so kind and email me regarding the software you used to encode the video and audio. I have a movie but the file is too large for my Fat32 thumb drive. Thanks again.
,spennsor,2011-12-13T09:49Z,Thanks r3dcat!
,AllzCool123,2011-12-21T12:45Z,"+1 Thanks for your generosity, r3dcat."
,cadelo,2012-01-06T01:27Z,"Video played great on my 42LW5500 right from thumb drive, but sound stuttered a bit at the beginning and then went mute. Will try on an external disk where I load my movies from! 3D effects were amazing, particularly the underwater scenes - 5*"
,howyeman,2012-01-27T21:36Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
