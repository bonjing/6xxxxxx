 ""I do sympathize with people on slow connections - it is my 'raison d'etre' (French phrase meaning ""reason for existence."").

 However, your claim have simple solution: Become regular. I seed long enough for anyone - but
 1. people on slow lines must be here and start download on day of upping
 2. people must be reasonable and learn simple math - ""How much I can really download"" in let say 48h, non-stop.

 People who miss something - must accept the reality. As in life, if something has been gone, by own deeds and merits, it belongs in the - past.

 People shouldn't be acting like children left alone in candy store and stuff in mouth more than can swallow, take or put in the pockets."""

 @ALL
 Look at the screen-shots. If you have missed some title, click on ""twentyforty"", browse through pages and load torrents you find interesting or missed, keeping eye on screen-shot.
 This is LAST CHANCE to get them really fast.

 All interested could look what is on seeding server till 26th.
 You all have few days left. 

If you have problems with connection to that server and IF you run PeerBlock, find OVH in active connections list, right-click on it and do ""Allow permanently"".

Let me know, I can put needed torrent as ""High priority"" one. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-22T16:35Z,"@hakuna_matata: And you CAN said that you've got both and save 2 hours of my upload time. Please, forget about future ""requests"". You requests miraculously fit your busy schedule - twice, but you haven't stopped me from wasting time and pushed-out other things I could upload instead.

Another ""pearl"" aside for not picking the requests and not saying Thanks by mainly your countrymen (and many others)."

,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-22T20:18Z,"My daughter thanks you profusely for Water For Elephants, and has a request, Blue Valentine, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1120985/, which she says is ""supposed to be hauntingly well acted""."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-22T20:24Z,"I think she wants Blue Valentine because it so accurately portrays her first marriage (though, frankly, I can't imagine why she would want a revisit).  Anyway--it is what it is."
