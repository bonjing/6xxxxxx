=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, 
and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s 
story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.
-----------------------------

For those who donâ€™t like anime, youâ€™ll be pleased to hear that this X-Men anime series 
(unlike the Wolverine anime) seems to be staying fairly true to the source material. 
Cyclops, Professor X, Beast, Storm and Wolverine all pretty much look like 
recognizable versions of themselves -- albeit â€œanimetedâ€ -- which, if you think about it, 
isnâ€™t too far from what a lot of American superhero cartoons are doing today 
(see: Wolverine and the X-Men).
