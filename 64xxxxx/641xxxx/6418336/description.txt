This mod/new map replaces the default map, Blood Gulch. The new map makes several changes to the original. Same layout of bases but the ground is white like snow and skid marks are orange like fire. There are teleporters throughout which access sniper positions that you are unable to get to in the regular map. All of the weapons can be found scattered throughout and every vehicle makes an appearance. Tanks, turrets, banshees, ghost, warthog machine gun and cannon. The instructions are in the readme.txt file.

You must be the host/server for this to work. If you join a regualar match only you will see the textures and the new platforms don't work because you are using the server map. If you want to join regular matches you must replace the original files.

The .exe is a self extracting WinRAR archive.
