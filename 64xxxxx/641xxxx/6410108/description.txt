On May 17th, Virgin Records will release Give Till Itâ€™s Gone , Ben Harperâ€™s 10th studio album.
With â€œRock Nâ€™ Roll Is Free,â€ the albumâ€™s first single, Harper pays tribute to an audacious art form that continually challenges the status quo, demanding that we look at the world in â€œa brand new way.â€ The song was inspired by rock legend Neil Young, whom Harper opened for in London last summer. Youngâ€™s mesmerizing performance of â€œRockinâ€™ in the Free Worldâ€ planted the seeds of a new song in Harperâ€™s mind, compelling him to go straight back to his room after the show and write â€œRock Nâ€™ Roll Is Free.â€ The incident is emblematic of the kind of urgency with which the new album was forged.

Harper recorded most of Give Till Itâ€™s Gone â€“ his first solo record since 2006â€²s Both Sides of the Gun â€“ at the Los Angeles studio of Jackson Browne, who harmonizes with him on the wistful â€œPray That Our Love Sees The Dawn.â€ The album also features two tracks co-written with Ringo Starr â€“ the exuberant, psychedelic-tinged â€œSpilling Faithâ€ and â€œGet There From Here,â€ an improvisational instrumental. Starr, who also plays drums on the songs, tapped Harper for his 2010 album, Y Not.

â€œIâ€™ve never made a record that was such a timeline,â€ says Harper. â€œItâ€™s a real extension of the last year and half in my life, and all these sounds are inspired by my experiences. Itâ€™s as honest a musical statement as I could make.â€

With Give Till Itâ€™s Gone, Harper examines the disparity between the man he is today and the man he endeavors to become. Reaching deep within, he discovers there are no easy answers, but implores us to go the distance with him on this journey in the moving album opener, â€œDonâ€™t Give Up On Me Now.â€ While its songs are highly personal, Give Till Itâ€™s Gone illuminates the universal struggle to find meaning and fully engage with life and one another. We may pass through a dark night of the soul, but giving up is not a viable option, as Harper reminds us with certainty in the transcendent â€œI Will Not Be Broken.â€

Harper made his debut in 1994 with Welcome to the Cruel World, which was subsequently certified Gold. In 2005, he received GRAMMY awards for â€œBest Pop Instrumental Performanceâ€ for his single â€œ11th Commandmentâ€ and for â€œBest Traditional Soul Gospel Albumâ€ for There Will Be A Light, featuring the Blind Boys of Alabama. His three most recent studio albums â€“ Both Sides of the Gun (2006), Lifeline (2007) and White Lies for Dark Times (2009) â€“ debuted in the Top 10 of The Billboard 200. Harper formed Fistful of Mercy with Dhani Harrison and Joseph Arthur and the trio released the album As I Call You Down in 2010.
