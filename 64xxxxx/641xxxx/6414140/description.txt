Postmodernist exegesis questions not only the 'grand canonical narrative' allegedly supposed by or encoded in the Bible; it also attacks the modern project of historical criticism. Hart also discusses the work of Harold Bloom and M. Blaanchot, as well as J. Derrida's view of the Bible. -- International Review of Biblical Studies 

Kevin Hart introduces the reader to all of the major figures and issues in the field, including Derrida, Baudrillard and Foucault, as well as explaining what makes a thinker or writer postmodern.
