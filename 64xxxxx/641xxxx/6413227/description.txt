Kreviazuk's first album, Under These Rocks and Stones, was released in Canada in 1996 and the U.S. in early 1997 to much critical praise.[citation needed] The album sold over 100,000 copies in the U.S., fueled mostly by the singles "Surrounded" and "God Made Me", while in Canada it went double platinum with sales of over 200,000. Three videos from the album receive modest play on the video channel MuchMusic and radio ("God Made Me", "Believer" and "Wayne" ), but it was a fourth, "Surrounded", that became her first major Canadian airplay hit in 1997.

In 1999, Kreviazuk released her second album. Titled Colour Moving and Still, it featured tracks written with her new husband, Raine Maida, lead singer of Our Lady Peace. The lead single from the album "Before You" became a huge radio hit in Canada and she performed the single on the 2000 Juno Awards, where she won two awards for Best Adult/Pop Album and Best Female Artist. Kreviazuk released two more videos from the album, "Dear Life" and "Far Away", as well as an additional radio release, "Souls", which was also remixed and was released as a promo vinyl for the M1 & Steve Fernandez Remix.

Her third album, What If It All Means Something, was released in 2002. This album also featured multiple collaborations with Maida. The first single, "In This Life", was a hit in Canada. Kreviazuk performed the song live on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
