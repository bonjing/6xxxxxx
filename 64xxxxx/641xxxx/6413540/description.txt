Hi there

Well for this sunday i decided to share with you another great file for my dear french mates :)

See bellow to learn more :
 
- Operating System : Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise with Service Pack 1
 - Language : French
 - Original File Name : fr_windows_7_enterprise_with_sp1_x86_dvd_620202.iso
 - Platform : X86 (32 BIT)
 - ISO CRC : 0d2432f6
 - ISO SHA1 : 909109d70624605a1dd713e29936ec9239ba325c
 - File Size : 2.357.139.456 bytes

this is the MSDN-TECHNET DVD retail in 32 bit edition only then.
as usual use fast up speed to download this torrent,please !
avoid seriously to use bittorrent 8 beta,please !
avoid to use too old versions also as you might be partialy rejected or banned by certain trackers.
Tixati users,please,update to latest version 1.61 asap so !
use and give a suffisant up speed or you might get nothing at all.
I still make my best to help and assist you during your download but i cannot make some miracles :s
cooperative mode is suggested so between you and i.
check constantly your up and down,and when you up,you must request a part at the same time as well.
Without request,you will get all slower.
adjust your up and speed to try to find the best ratio between them so.
Avoid to filtering too much your ip as it will forcibly disadvantage you as well.
Slow and lazy peers,please,give your max up speed so !
some anti-virus and anti-spyware can slow down your up and down speed as they are filtering hard your internet connection so check them and try to find the best compromise with them then.
minimum 30-45 ko/s up speed is recommended from your part
Be patient as i still continue to seed simultaneously many other torrents at the same time.
I will seed on two parallel connections with 1 meg up at the same time asap to help you more.
untouched iso and 100 % clean and trustworthy !
100 % tested and working like a charm :)
no any virus is hidden in this file so !
beware : no serial or crack is included !
and this is not the eval version ! ----> NO time bomb then !
use 7 loader,remove WAT or X Treme Napalum edition to activate this last one if necessary.
search here on tpb and you will find easily all you need so.
I will up 64 bit version asap as this last one is really more difficult to grab :(
But i still hope get it soon so :)
GL mates :)
Wish you have a very nice sunday so :)
Enjoy
best regards
