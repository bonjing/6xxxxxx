thx for all those great torrents, having fun reading many of these books will also improve my english i hope... ;-))

Now a question:
are your pdfs converted/encrypted in a special format?
When i try to save a pdf as txt-file (an option, acrobat pro gives you under ""save as..."" it clutters the line-endings.

example: 
""save as txt"" SHOULD give:
""The Last Olympian
THE LAST OLYMPIAN
THE LAST OLYMPIAN
Percy Jackson and the Olympians - Book 5
Rick Riordan
Scanned by Cluttered Mind (v1.0)""

this is, what ""save as txt"" give in reality:
""The Last Olympiab 



The Last Olympiab 


THE LAST OLYMPIA` 
THE LAST OLYMPIA` 
Percy Jackson and the Olympians - Book t 
Rick Riordaj 
Scanned by Cluttered Mind (v1.0ĂÂŤ""

You see: last character of line is replaced (hopefully by a rule, but i cant identify it)

Do you think there is a workaround for getting those txt out of the pdf? I want to reformat the txt so it is printable.

thx in advance "
