,laari,2011-12-09T23:26Z,"Well, people, it is not about seeding as you can see. Something is wrong with the torrent. 
oaa.uk must check and fix it."

,jpcrtc,2012-02-20T16:08Z,At least you can already extract finished files from this upload though it stucked at 91.8%. Just open the rar file and drag and drop any of the files inside the rar to your desired folder. That's it!
