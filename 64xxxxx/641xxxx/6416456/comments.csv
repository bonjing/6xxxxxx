Can you tell me why are there some scenes missing in some of the episodes? For example in ''Who killed Mr. Burns?''
At the scene when Sideshow Mel arrives to the police station with Krusty and tells the police that they have captured the wrong man, Dr. Colossus doesn't show up! What's up with that?"
