The reference point for this MONO remix was taken from a bootleg EP "Come together / Something / Oh darling / Octopuses Garden" released in Holland in 1973. When compared to regular un-mastered stereo, it was (more or less) centered at a 60/40 ratio with slightly muffled high frequencies. The separate MONO channels were overdubbed twice in order to gain some of the "fullness and depth" when listened through the regular two-speaker stereo system.  

These sound differently from both, re-mastered and/or regular stereo.   

NOTE: definitely NOT suitable for multi-speaker surround etc, sound systems!
