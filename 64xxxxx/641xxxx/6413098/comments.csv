Notes to the developers: Pirating softwares also works in your favor. People use the software and when they're used to it they recommend it most of the time like what we did a decade ago. We recommended autocad to our CEO bcoz we know it, unlike microstation which is very hard to obtain during that time...

We, users, can't afford to buy it...big corporations are the ones who purchase it. So, its wise to give it free to the ultimate users.  If they know it...they will ask for it or recommend it...eventually the most that are used (pirated) wins the selling game. (Could this be the new selling strategy??? Why not???)

I, for one will recommend this (BricsCad) becoz this is the 1st time i've seen this if not for TPB (thanx TPB!!!)"
