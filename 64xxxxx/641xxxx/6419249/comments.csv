Naming conventions are annoying though so if you like things perfect be prepared to spend 30 mins renaming the songs. 

Quality is not 320kbps on all songs, most average at 210kbps, still great quality.

.m3u for those who don't know is a playlist file, open it and it plays the whole album (until you rename the songs) so do not worry.

Overall great torrent, great music and thanks. If some of the other albums are indeed overwritten then I will comment again and let you all know.

Cheers."
