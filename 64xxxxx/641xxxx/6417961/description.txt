Learn Swedish!

This is a great way to learn Swedish, even though it is from the 70s.

NOTE: I will try to seed around 8:00 - 12 Midnight PST (Pacific Standard Time) GMT-8

This includes:

- All 4 double-sided records in mp3 format
- A 100+ page Instruction Manual in pdf format
- A 16 page Test Manual Workbook
- Scans of each record\'s labels for lesson-reference


I hope you enjoy :)

OH, I almost forgot... I will begin scanning a 160+ page book entitled:
             \"Advanced Spoken Swedish\" - Martin SÃ¶derbÃ¤ck (1947) ...

This book includes some EXTREMELY helpful explanations on some discrepancies that are difficult for a speaker of English to comprehend.

Like Tycker, Tyckte, TÃ¤nka, Tro, and Trodde ... They are all translated as Think, thought, thinking... But they are all used in various ways that needs some explanation!

This book helps SOOOOO much in the understanding of things like that... I will begin scanning it today, so if everything goes to plan, then it will be done somewhere between now and 1 week lol.
