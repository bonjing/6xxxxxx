,rajmxxx,2011-05-24T17:01Z,Atleast can you do Final destination quadrilogy?
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-24T17:11Z,"@bdlnaredi: You are surrounded by leechers, who give you shit but suck you dry. So: press Stop then Start few times minute apart and that way you rearrange your ""company"" (peers around you). Increase Global number of active connections to 256, per torrent to 128 - but set number of upload connections to max. 8. and UN-tick ""Use additional upload slots if..."". Use recommended programs (look up). Play then with Stop/Start till you ""catch"" my BitTornado. It is a tornado and Niagara like seeding."

Anything. In any form and shape.
