Throughout his career the novelist best known for some of the twentieth century's best loved novels including A Passage to India, Where Angels Fear to Tread and Howard's End wrote short stories which reveal much about his outlook on life. In them he explored many of the themes central to his novels, including the morals and mores of the middle classes in the early twentieth century, and his fascination with the Mediterranean. Many of his stories were unpublished until after his death because of their homosexual theme and only shown to his circle of friends, among them Christopher Isherwood and T.E. Lawrence.
