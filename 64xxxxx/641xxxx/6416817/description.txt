                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Gordon's Great Escape sees Gordon traveling to India to learn more about      
 Indian cuisine. The second series saw him travelling to South East Asia.      
                                                                               
 Gordon travels to Malaysia where he learns more about lesser-known recipes 
 from the region. In just a week Gordon must enter a 'cook the national dish
 competition' at one of the leading cooking schools in the country. He also 
 ends up risking life as he climbs high up inside a bat-infested cave to get
 nests for birds' nest soup. He also samples bull-penis broth and goes on the
 road with a bunch of food-loving Harley bikerss
