Another torrent, far better seeded, exists for this episode. The description on that torrent includes the following: *** NOTE *** Once again our source was hammered with severe weather causing a banner on the top through out the show along with an annonying banner scrolling at the bottom.  To make things even worse there was a weather station interuption during the 14 min. mark of the program ( lasts only about 30 seconds ) which we cut out.  The weather sure hates Oprah or does not want to see her gone.  *** NOTE ***

This video is complete and does not have the weather warnings, but has somewhat poorer quality as a result of being created from an analog capture instead of a digital capture.
