Louisiana-born singer and harmonica blower Sidney Maiden first made his mark in the blues world during the late Forties with Eclipse of the Sun, a number cut in Oakland with guitarist K.C. Douglas. Unlike many other Southern bluesmen who urbanized their styles after relocating to the West Coast, Maiden and Douglas stuck close to their rural roots. Maiden spent much of his career entertaining farm workers around Fresno, while Douglas became a favorite in Bay Area folkmusic circles. This 1961 reunion, recorded in Berkeley by Kenneth S. Goldstein and Chris Strachwitz, reveals that the two men had lost none of their old musical empathy and shows Maiden, in the words of annotator Larry Cohen, worthy of being mentioned along with the select few greats of the mouthharp.
