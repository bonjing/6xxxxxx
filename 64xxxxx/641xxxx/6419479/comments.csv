,xenterx,2011-05-25T12:32Z,What version G4WL you guys use ? 
,RAZOR152,2011-05-25T13:30Z,"My F-secure says that the skidrow.dll is a virus.
Is it?"
,steve30x,2011-05-25T13:48Z,Its a false positive.
,gilect,2011-05-25T14:25Z,"kaspersky found trojan
in paul.dll"
,steve30x,2011-05-25T14:32Z,"Looks like some people dont know what a false positive is. If your Anti Virus program says its a virus , then it must be a virus right. I mean How can they be wrong."
,drboose,2011-05-25T18:18Z,"This did not work for me.   I get the error: No disc inserted. Please insert the original ""Dirt 3"" CD/DVD.

I got the 'false' positives also."
,TheBigLOL,2011-05-26T11:45Z,"no viruses found with avast! antivirus.
someone must added as false positive & the database updated :)

should work"

,jesseajax93,2011-05-26T14:48Z,Why does my virusscanner says this is a virus? every skidrow crack i download is a 'virus' while others work perfect
,gilect,2011-05-27T19:57Z,"crack is legit it aint virus
yesterday i downloaded it kis 2011 sayd virus today it says it aint virus restored from qarantine"
,Loginer,2011-05-28T20:05Z,"The reason the crack is detected as malicious is because it's obfuscated. It may be a trojan, or it may not be; I prefer to err on the side of caution."
,CelaP,2011-05-29T13:33Z,"File SKIDROW.dll and paul.dll not viruses.
One who uses NOD32 antivirus has to put those files in the EXCLUSIONS.

,Xanax411,2011-08-12T23:18Z,Yeah im using avast and its flagged as a trojan........Could be a FP but none of the other games by skidrow where flagged as trojans.....And i like to stay on the safe side.......Any Cracks that arent flagged by every virus scanner under the sea????? It just makes me uneasy if its flagged..........All of them get flagged by avast the Dirt 3 cracks...and i really wanna play this game :( I guess ill just ignore the AV warning.
