You couldn't pay me to play it :P
much less play it for free."
,neil22768,2011-05-24T11:01Z,i agree with shroomblood i was waiting for this for ages cause realy liked the first 1 but honestly i think this is 1 of the worse driving games ever in my opinion :(
,king_shrimp,2011-06-25T18:13Z,"love how people slate this game, let me guess, you like need for speed games. games where you can go flat out round a 90* bend.

TDU2 isnt a racing game, its a driving game for car enthusiasts. if you want to race round boring tracks, go play forza. if you want 2 huge islands where you can drive wherever you want in whatever car u choose, then play TDU2

ive also read lots of other comments about the handling with keyboards? WTF are you  playing at trying to steer using BUTTONS, get a god damn wheel or pad you dumbfucks where you can then actually have control over your steering.

Infact keyboards are just shit for gaming.

,Meng2strong,2011-07-08T15:05Z,"@Hamdex008, The comment posted works, you can install with that. All you need to do afterwards is copy the files over and block UpLauncher.exe in your firewall to prevent the game from updating as mentioned by the uploader."
