Here's a fascinating and unique look at one of the most popular drivers in the history of the Indianapolis 500, Eddie Sachs.  In June of 1960, CBS television broadcast a 1 hour B & W special on the 1960 Indianapolis 500 Mile Race title, "ON THE POLE". A documentary on 1960 pole-winning driver Eddie Sachs, the show is a behind-the-scenes look a the race from his perspective, starting from a week before the race through the day after the big event.

The presentation is shown in ites entirety, even including the original TV commercials.
