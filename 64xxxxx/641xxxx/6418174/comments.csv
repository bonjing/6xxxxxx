,TorrentChick,2011-05-24T19:36Z,Thank you so much!!! I have been waiting to watch this movie for a long time! :D
[T],winto_bungle,2011-05-24T23:08Z,why do people keep claiming 720p when it isnt!? this release is 1280x544 which is a scaled down of the original 1280x720 (hense 720p).
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-25T02:18Z,hence
,jimmystyx,2011-05-25T02:44Z,"Wow, it's unbelievable that in this day and age morons still keep posting this shit about 544 vs 720p.  People are so eager to complain; it's endemic.  winto_bungle, subtract 2 large black bars from 720p and you end up with 544 horizontal lines.  Do some research before you start your bitching.  It's called ""original aspect ratio,"" your TV is likely 16x9 and the movie is recorded at 2.35:1.  aoloffline, another killer release as always!  Cheers."
,scarygood48,2011-05-25T02:50Z,@winto.  If it was kept at the 1280 x 720 ratio there would be black bars included in this release which would just be a waste.  What really matters in the 1280.
,abhikrit,2011-05-25T03:31Z,@bungle... please think before you comment... whats the point of keeping the black bars when your viewing source can do the same for you??? please stop being an idiot in public.
,Dulasync,2011-05-25T08:23Z,"Ha Ha Ha!!!

I still learned a lot from idiot's comment.  Thanks to all those guys do all the ""teaching""."
,Erman_Yildiz,2011-05-25T12:52Z,You did a great job. 
,freeman_RS,2011-05-25T14:36Z,thank you for this...
,N0rs3,2011-05-25T15:28Z,I think this album is going to be very good! Great musicians everyone of them.
,Libava,2011-05-25T16:01Z,"@N0rs3: = LOL !!!!!= ALBUM/MUSICIANS ?? ...... put out your smoke dude....

Every one else: PLEASE SEEEEEED !!!!.... I started dwnld like 10 hr ago..... still at 1% completed and crawling at 3-5 kB/s ..... wtf !! =)"
,Libava,2011-05-25T18:44Z,"Damn it !!! ..... SEED after you downloaded for at least a few Hours !!! ..... & increase your Upload Limit you mf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =

------

also I was thinking ~ may be it's not a bad idea to name your movie files Starting with the actual Movie Name ... Duh .... so then folks who already downloaded won't attempt to Rename the file ,which I guess could be one of the reasons why Uploading stops [- I mean it'll stop automatic Seeding when you rename the file, right?] ) 
- so foe example this one: f-true.grit.720p.mkv ~~ c'mon aoloffline !! ...... or did you specifically mean it's a ""F"" TrueGrit ???..... LOL !!!!="
,zlayall,2011-05-25T19:52Z,"Thnx for the up.
The info says English subs. Where is it?"
,Munchk1npuncher,2011-05-25T21:42Z,"Finally registered on the site to say, Thank you very much for your uploads. This is one fantastic movie that shouldnt be missed. Really appreciate your uploads and keep up the good work!

[T],winto_bungle,2011-05-27T16:58Z,yea my bad meant hence. and actually meant its a scaled down version of the 1980x1080 blu ray version - 720p is the output of smaller tvs and games.
,raj2020,2011-05-29T07:09Z,"Avatar 720p downloaded from the same uploader has got 1280x720 so it fills my 20"" LCD monitor screen. Whereas 1280x544 movies uploaded these days has black bars in the top & bottom. Should i buy a 21:9 TV to view it without black bars? Don't jump on me just try to answer my question"
,strawdogg,2011-05-29T22:45Z,"@raj2020

Hey fellow, it is possible using VLC to 'crop' your balck border with a right click my friend.

Works for me on my smallish, 19 inch, computer screen so good luck with it."
,DomCheetham,2011-05-31T10:26Z,"LOL @ winto_bungle. Probably young and new at torrenting. Kudos on posting man but negative points for sounding like a douche.

Anyway shouldn't we talking about shitty ISP's that shape and throttle, pissing me off with BT...Deluge client seems to work well. 

Thanks for the movie.  "

If it's great quality then why in the fuck would you rate it 
a: 8
v: 9

a8v9 means it's pretty much crappy quality, where as this here looks like

a: 10
v: 10"
,topk,2011-06-03T17:54Z,"@bbb_ozoz

Good camrips are rated 
a:8

This here is a fucking

,John_Doe1214,2011-06-04T17:49Z,@Libava - An easy fix is to copy the movie file then rename it. This way you can still upload & give back while renaming the copy and doing whatever you want with it.
