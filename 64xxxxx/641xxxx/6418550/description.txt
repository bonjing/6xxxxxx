While Savannah volunteers for Habitat for Humanity, John circles bars at last call, looking for new hookups. She's an affluent, idealistic do-gooder; he's an outsider trying to rehabilitate himself. Despite their values and lifestyle conflicts, the pair begin to converge. Then the random lightning of history snaps them apart.
