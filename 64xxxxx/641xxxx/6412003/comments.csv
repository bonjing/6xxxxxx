Working perfect in a Samsung 3D!"
,bajendanne,2011-05-27T00:07Z,Thnx! Working fine...
,eddiert,2011-06-01T22:00Z,"Had a few times where the sound cut out on my Samsung 7000.  Once around 58 min and some later.  Played ok on the computer.
However, not a fault of the George but this was the worst 3D movie experience I have ever had.  The entire 3D portion is shot in a very narrow depth of field where one thing is in focus and the rest is out.  Drove my eyes crazy and gave me a headache trying to focus on things they couldn't.  I have seen many 3D movies and never had this problem.  Don't see why they bothered to film it in 3D.
Thanks for the effort though."

Thanks dude and keep the good work man, you are the best 3D uploader!! "

worked fine using PS3 media server and panny VT20. Probably the best torrent ive ever downloaded...just a shame i cudnt get the DTS 7.1 to work wit my playstation and home cinema but thx for the DD5.1 track with it!! 

Also found the aspect ratio changed a few times during the film but assuming this occurs in the source :-S

Unbelievable torrent"
