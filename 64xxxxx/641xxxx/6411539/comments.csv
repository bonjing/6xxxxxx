[V],twentyforty,2011-05-22T08:45Z,"@spiritualiste: Add 50 to all - then I move torrents from Initial-seeding to their final destination - on that server, where so called up-seed is performed.
But, purpose of screen-shots was different:

@ALL
Look at the screen-shots. If you have missed some title, click on ""twentyforty"", browse through pages and load torrents you find interesting or missed, keeping eye on screen-shot.
This is LAST CHANCE to get them really fast.

If you have problems with connection to that server and IF you run PeerBlock, find OVH in active connections list,  right-click on it and do ""Allow permanently"".

Let me know, I can put needed torrent as ""High priority"" one."
