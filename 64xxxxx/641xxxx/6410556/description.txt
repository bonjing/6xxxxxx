Benny Rodrigues â€“ Live @ HEY! Beachclub Karavaan Scheveningen (Rotterdam, Netherlands) â€“ 07-05-2011


"My 1st (unoffical) gig in a loooooong while due to my 2010/2011 sabbatical which iâ€™ll will be interrupting this summer for 6 festival-gigs and 1 very special club-gig only:


this is the sound of myself joining Michel de Heyâ€™s beachparty and trying out Traktor for the 1st time, the day after i bought it, so not every mix is as smooth as you might expect from meâ€¦.how ironic that may sound hahaâ€¦., but no, i DIDNâ€™T sync my set ok?!  

i was suppose to play 2 hours only, but ended up playing for 7.5 hours in total, including a 5.5 hour back2back set with Michel de Hey  

so this is the start of my set, building things up nicely while the sun is shining on the beach and more of where that came from  

njoy!"
