Igo 8.x, Amigo, Igo Primo - May 2011 compilation Europe West & East!

This is a compilation of original maps, POI's and 3D buildings.
The sources are: Navteq Q4 2010, TeleAtlas Q4 2010 and TopMap (HU) March 2011.

The main ideea is "bigger is better", so I've compared the size for each country, from each releases (maps, POI's and buildings) and this is the resulting compilation.

Usually the folders are in the Content folder of your installation.
