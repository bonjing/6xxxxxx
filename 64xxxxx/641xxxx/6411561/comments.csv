,superb0y,2011-08-03T13:16Z,"speedcams: see scdb.info
the google earth file is free (otherwise EUR10 subscr), and with some smart editing (e.g. textwrangler on mac) you can convert it to a igo speedcam.txt file good luck"

,Danoots,2012-01-06T11:18Z,"@zzolee30 & everybody else that wants to use the maps for international travelling: THE BORDERS DO NOT MATCH so you will get a complete f-up route or a message saying the maps are isolated. I've just been on a road trip from Romania to Spain and I can tell for sure that the maps for Hungary, Austria, Italia, France, Spain, Swiss, Germany don't have matching borders so you can't get a route through, will have to go on the map and point a place on the road near the border and it's kind of frustrating. But better than nothing, right?"
