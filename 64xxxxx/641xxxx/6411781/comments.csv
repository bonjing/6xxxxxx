,Hyper9,2011-09-03T12:04Z,"Thank you so much!  I searched for this forever, but could only find Disney's awful 2005 re-dub with the Fanning sisters!  UGH!  But thank you for helping me preserve this memory from my childhood."
,Hyper9,2011-09-03T12:06Z,"works great, btw.  audio 10/video 10."
,Zev747,2011-10-16T08:32Z,"This download has a bunch of weird files ""ifo"", ""bup"", and ""vob"".  I don't know what to do with them.  Can't watch. :/"
[V],HobbitGamez,2011-10-30T02:58Z,"@Zev747

It is a DVD-R. If you have any decent codec pack you open one of the VOB files in Windows Media Player and that's that. Or VLC, or MPCHC, or XBMC, etc. There are 100 ways to play this."
,salitrov,2011-11-24T06:42Z,"I can confirm that this is in fact the original English dub, not the Fanning dub."
,Scazza,2011-12-14T17:48Z,"SEED PLEASE! 

This is the only torrent with the good dub and it's quite a big file. I'm currently at 20h which is risky as seeders come and go. I'd like to get the whole thing! Please seed!"
,sidlicious8789,2012-01-26T05:11Z,"I just want to thank you so much... I've been looking everywhere for this dub version, I hate the new one with Dakota Fanning.. I over-watched this movie when I was younger and destroyed my VHS. Thank you so much!"
,Teerfall,2012-02-10T06:21Z,Can someone help me? Which IFO file contains the movie? I'm using AGK to turn it into a movie file. I've never done this before and am a bit confused.
,strivetoresist,2012-05-28T12:59Z,"EXCELLENT. The ONLY rip of the Fox dub that I've been able to find, anywhere.

It is a large download (couple hours). But install VLC media player and just load up the folder that contains the files and it will work just fine.

Haven't watched the entire movie yet, but the audio seemed perfect. Video is very good, seemed like there were some lines but that could be my laptop's screen. Going to test it on my TV tomorrow."
