,cl0ckwerk,2011-08-12T22:09Z,"It works fine on Vista, although at can be a little buggy so I would suggest saving often. I'm guessing the bugs aren't compatibility problems though. it seems like the kind of game that would have been buggy on the OS it was made for. It's not a big deal though because it's 99% a puzzle game. it has very very few battle scenes, and dying on them doesn't really do anything. you don't even have to start over, you just respawn and keep fighting. that's why crashes don't really matter. since you already know the solutions to puzzles you've already finished, you can quickly get back to where you were (it helps to know you can push esc to skip dialogue)."
