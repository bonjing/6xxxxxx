,rigmar_radio,2011-05-21T23:56Z,Aspect Ratio ALL 4:3?  Are you sure??? Most unusual if that is the case as I have most of this lot from my UK suppliers in Widescreen 16:9.   Hope you did not rip it 4:3 by mistake as once you do that it can never be undone.
,rigmar_radio,2011-05-22T00:02Z,"Oh and not that this is all that vital, but you may as well get it right next time.   You see very little difference when you RAR a VOB or MPEG2 file as they are already compressed to fit on the DVD in the first place and for file names it is convention to use 'Artist's Name - Song Title' or most Video import and playback software gets rather confused.   As I say not really an issue here as the original VOB files will have to be split into tracks and then re titled for use in Video Discotheques anyway, as no one uses physical DVD media on the road these days.  Promo only make it easy as the tracks have on screen titling anyway."
