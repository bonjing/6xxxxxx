
This was a Sunday sermon.., or should I call it an analysis of the "Sheeple".., that make up the majority of those that are a part of "Churchianity" today.., or anywhere else in "our great society" for that matter !!

It was spoken by Pastor Peter John Peters (LaPorte Colorado) in 1985.

I consider it to be one of the best of his "classic sermons".., where he is able to translate thought provoking ideals and observations into words that are able to communicate.., "as to where the rubber meets the road" so to speak.., along with his well known humor and sarcasm  :-)

This audio file is 52 minutes in length and has a quality of about an 8.., as it was made from an old audio cassette.  Remember those ?? !!  There's also a few intermittent CB radio interference signals from passing truckers.

At only 25 Mb.., it's more than worth your time to download and listen to.., especially if you've enjoyed any of my other "Borzoi" uploads...

As always.., please share here.., there.., or however you can.., in order to possibly help those who are asleep.., but who just may.., wish to be  AWAKENED  !!!...

"The Truth shall make you Free.., but at first.., it'll make you Damn Mad" !!!
