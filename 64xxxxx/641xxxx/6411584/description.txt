    Three DVD set by Cannibal Corpse with Centuries of Torment through       
    the Metal Blade Label covering the first 20 years of Cannibal Corpse,    
    an US Death Metal band founded in 1988. The band has released ten        
    studio albums, one boxed set, and one live album. Although Cannibal      
    Corpse has had virtually no radio or television exposure, a cult         
    following began to build behind the group with albums like 1991's        
    Butchered at Birth and 1992's Tomb of the Mutilated. Cannibal Corpse     
    reached over 1 million in record sales worldwide in 2003 including       
    over 500,000 in the US making them one of the biggest selling death      
    metal bands of all time.
