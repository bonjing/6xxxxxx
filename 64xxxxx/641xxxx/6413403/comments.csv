""Current TV is available internationally in the UK, Ireland, Italy, and South Africa, however, â€œCountdownâ€ will not appear on Current TV or Current.com in those countries. We will continue to look to broaden our international footprint in the future.

""Unfortunately, there will not be audio or video podcasts of full episodes of Countdown available for download as our agreements with our cable and satellite distributors do not allow us to do so.""

So we MUST find someone who can get the show from American TV and post it here (or any other torrent site)!  PLEASE!"
