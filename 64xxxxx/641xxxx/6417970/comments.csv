,dnivie123,2011-05-24T09:45Z,Anybody knows when there is coming a good rip of this? This is quite bad quality have I heard.
,mnemo666x,2011-05-24T10:43Z,"THIS IS REAL and all people who say fake need to delete themselves from this world. Its also very watchable.

It states that episode 7 is available so this being a webrip is very possible."

,arzie,2011-05-29T17:45Z,Totally watchable and thx to uploader. When can we expect ep.1/8 land in bay ?
,jreilly89,2011-05-29T21:30Z,The reason this episode is worse quality then the others and some ppl are claiming its a fake is because it was a promotial thing hbo was doing by showing an episode a week earlier online. This same episode will be on tv the regular time slot so for those who want better quality will have to wait for then.
,dillpickles,2011-05-30T00:24Z,"legit copy, and good series. thanks for the upload. "
