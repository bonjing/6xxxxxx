,semicrazy,2011-06-10T03:27Z,I can't get the patch to work.... a little help please.
,Movieslut,2011-06-14T22:16Z,The RAR contains the wrong version for this keygen to work. Copy the Standard version directly from the developer's site here: http://www.highcriteria.ca/download/tr82se.exe
,nickdove,2011-06-17T21:36Z,"Nope, still doesn't work. ""invalid name or registration key"". 

And when patching: ""patch failed"". 

Anyone?"
,Morroco,2012-04-19T21:07Z,"Make sure you're not suing the program while you are patching, the patching worked for me and I got it registered.

However, I still receive the slight hiss after each minute mark.

This torrent works and is great, mostly if you want to collect sound samples straight from your computer. Much less for Skype conversations or full songs."
