You can also slow down or speed up the playback of an Internet broadcast.
â€¢ Convert files to any supported format (including on the fly converting while recording). For more information, see the Sound Format Conversion Tutorial.
â€¢ Edit sound files using a built-in sound editor. This built-in sound editor allows you to cut, trim, and join your recordings.

Splitting an existing recording can also be done. For more information, see the Splitting and Tagging Files Tutorial.
â€¢ Use Cue-sheet files. Total Recorder lets you create cue-points, which can be used for splitting a file afterwards. These cue-points can be created manually, for example to make a bookmark in a sound file. Or they can be created automatically during a recording session (based on pause reduction, changes of the clip information in an external player, etc.) or while capturing an Internet transmission and information about a track changes.
â€¢ Create and edit file tags. Total Recorder can work with file tags for any of the supported media formats. Tags can also include artwork.
â€¢ Play a media file at a slower or faster speed than normal while optionally preserving the original tone.

â€¢ Use add-ons. Total Recorder supports add-ons that can be used for sound enhancements, mixing operations, integration with iTunes/iPod, and for other purposes. Refer to the Add-ons page for information on the add-ons available.
