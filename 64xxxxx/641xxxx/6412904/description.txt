No-Man is a project of Steven Wilson and Tim Bowness. Wilson is widely known for his work with Porcupine Tree, and while some facets of Flowermouth recall his work there, notably the vocal engineering, No man is quite a different band. Flowermouth is a delicate balance of post-rock texture and mood, pop vocals and simple, carefree lyrics, coupled with a hint of dance ambience. The melodies are subtle and hypnotic, while a lot of the tracks, while built around a melodic motif or simple rhythm, possess a trance like quality that sees them unfold and expand around the listener. The songs are incredibly original, and have the presence of Robert Fripp and Lisa Gerrard as guests. Underrated gem.
