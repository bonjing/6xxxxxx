This is the bands second full length CD and a long wait since the debut in 2002. This Japanese band have produced several split projects and have a double CD early works compilation that is due out any day. Anyway, the 7 songs here are themed around 5 different serial killers. We start off with "Motherfucker" (Ted Bundy). The production is so damn raw and this is more hard driving and not as doomy as previous material I have heard but includes some ripping lead guitars. "Soul Discharge" (Mark Essex) is next and pretty damn brutal as well. The vocals are very tortured but the band build up a cool groove. "Red Ripper Blues" (Andaei Chikatilo) starts with some samples and tasty blues guitar and spaced out synthesizer sounds but donâ€™t be fooled as this band plans to rip your head off every time. Awesome space blues!!!!! "Filth Bitch Boogie" (Aileen Wuoanos) also has some samples to start things off before a pretty cool bluesy hard rock riff takes the song on itâ€™s way. Nothing to do with the old TANK song of the same title. Next, the band take on the classic Cactus song, "One Way or Another", and do a pretty good job with a nice long jam. "Candy Man" (Dean Coall) is a slow heavy, more doomy song and the longest on the CD at 7? minutes. Reminds me a bit of Cathedral this one! The CD closes with the slow building doomy, instrumental, "El Topo". I assume titled after the cool film by Alejandro Jadorowsky. I wish the production value was a bit higher as it is a bit hard on the ears at times but great songs and playing.
