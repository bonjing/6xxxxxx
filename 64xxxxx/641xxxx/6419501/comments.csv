,Sugar_Skull,2011-07-24T01:38Z,Let's see how much this Download boosts after today.
,Cantwait,2011-07-24T02:35Z,Will leach and seed in her memory.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-07-24T02:49Z,"downloaded her discography from here and listened, or attempted to listen at any rate, to her repertoire. GAWD--what a complete waste of disk space that was! The ONLY positive thing I can say is that her voice reminds me of Duffy.

But thanks, theLEAK, for giving me the opportunity to listen to a quality--and trusted source--download.  Will seed until 1.0, then delete."
