Absolutely over the top debut album by Turkish psychedelic guitar guru. At last reissued on vinyl, this is the rarest of all Erkin albums but also the rarest Turkish psych album ever. This album, originally released in 1973, is actually a compilation of singles from the previous years since 1968. You can notice the difference in time when listening to the album, with some tracks kinda pre- psychedelic and some others heavily into it, but all of them with that unique Eastern feel that the guitar master gives to their recordings. Definitely, the best Koray album together with Elektronik Turkuler, a total masterpiece.
