This is the soundtrack for the game Revenant, (1999) Eidos Interactive, Including the CDDA files from the second disk that took literally YEARS for me to find. I found a copy of the second disk online that was a complete copy of both the audio and data tracks, and then ripped the audio. 

The game has such great music and considering all the trouble I went through to put this together, I figured all you internet people should enjoy it.
Enjoy this complete soundtrack, including theme music and score, from a great game with great music.
