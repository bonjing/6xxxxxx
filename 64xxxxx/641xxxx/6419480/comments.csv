,robodude05,2011-05-25T11:50Z,"Ok this is fully legit. I have played the entire first tour. Very fun game, I think it is a great improvement over Dirt 2.. Which was also a great game! The only problem I ran into was my antivirus (norton) kept removing the crack when I would launch the game. Then the game would ask for the correct disk. I fixed this by going into norton and added exceptions for the codemasters folder. Hope this helps. Also I read a comment somewhere saying they cant get the game to save. All you need to do is create an account offline. :) Simple as that. 

Thank you extremezone!!"

After playing the game and going through the weird 1111-111-11.... inlog with win-games Dirt 3 is saving my game progress but i lost everything in my F1 2010 win-game save files

I then started a new F1 career(and save file) after playing only that, as a test, it remembered my F1 saveF after a reboot but forgot it after starting Dirt3 again. 

So back up your save files in case this problem is not only mine. 

I hope a new improved crack gets rid of this problem.

Previously for Dirt2 I was using GFWL version 3.0, it worked with no errors in saving. Version 3.0 failed to created local (offline) profile for Dirt3 so I tried the latest version 3.5.88 (version info according to Control Panel Uninstall Program) Unfortunately using 3.5.88 didnt work either.  I have two local/offline profiles that I use for crack games.  I signed into one of these offline profiles, but Dirt3's in game profile creation fails. 

So I then created another fresh local/offline profile under GFWL 3.5.88.0; however that also didnt work.  I then tried another step by creating a name@live.com (microsoft's email account) and also an xbox live account using the same name@live.com.  Just for testing I tried to sign in with this newly created live account under GFWL but of course it'll ask to sign in with the fake serial number i have entered. It doesn't verify.

So now I'm just wondering, how did you get it to work? what version of GFWL are you using (check control panel)? What steps did you do differently than what I described?

I'm still staying away from the skidrow folder...as one game isn't worth it to mess up my whole pc, worst of all ive read messages about people getting mysterious incoming concections after crack.

You are doing it the right way. I've installed tons of torrent games, where many are skidrow versions without any infection. Like you, I've stayed away from this one after observing in- and outbound connections to ip of webhost in a sandboxed environment, which resolved to a webserver with controlpanel for botnets...
I've de-assembled the dll's and the instructions are hardcoded in each to connect to the same ip to accepts commands from a host.

What I did to get it working with the mini-image:
1) Mount the game;
2) Used xxxx's as serial;
3) Installing the game (it will take a while);
4) Uninstalled GFWL from my pc;
5) Installed GFWL FROM THE IMAGE (v3.5.88.0 (in controlpanel));
6) Downloaded and mounted the mini-image from Gamecopyworld;
7) Started the game;
8) Made an offline account;
9) Made playername;
10) Enjoyed the game with savefeature, even after 2 days of gameplay without any infection :-)

Good luck. If it doesn't work, please tell me. I'll keep a close eye to the comments."

The image is the archive you downloaded (the torrent).
You need to install windows live from the folder when you mounted that image.

I used Daemontools Lite (free version) and in advanced options, I ticked all emulation security options, such as rmps, safedisc, securom and laserlock. I mounted the mini-image and started the game."

,mw1987,2011-05-27T17:39Z,"@Saash30
No, you don't need to login to live. I highly recommend you NOT to do so, because of pirated game.

All you need to do is make sure you uninstall this GFWL and reinstall using the installer in the directory when mounting the image.

Regarding the conflict of emulation software, make sure you only have one virtual drive running. For example, ONLY daemontools and not poweriso or alcohol. I've already uninstalled poweriso and alcohol, because they are not anything to add really. If you want to make images, I would highly recommend BlindWrite, cause it could make 1:1 copies of every protection to date.

So, make sure you have daemontools only, the free version is all you want.

Tell me if it works and good luck :-)

Thank you for your help and instructions. It's rare to have someone that doesn't ramble on that their game works or not without providing details. Unfortunately, it still did not work for me.  First I uninstalled dirt3 and also gfwl.

I then followed your instructions, this time using xxxx's as serials instead of random numbers.  Innstalling dirt3 will auto install GFWL it seems, so i uninstalled GFWL, and then reinstalled using the gfwl exe from skidrow's ISO.  I checked the exe file's properties/details and see it says File version 3.4.62.0, but when installed it says 3.5.88.0 in Control Panel.

Also this time around, I made sure to take out the XLive and GFWLive folders from My Documents that are generated from previous games, so it will be fresh start.  

I then started the game using mount method with Daemon.  Just to make sure I am using Codemaster's original dirt3.exe which is 9,026kb in size.  I wonder what is different that you're doing.  I am using Windows 7 64bit."

No problem.

I've no clue. The steps I wrote down are the steps I toke and it worked for me on Win 7 32 & 64 bit with AV and FW on.

All emulation features are ON though in Daemontools, maybe that's what's makes the difference. Make sure you have admin rights and restart after you install daemontools.

What's the problem you have?

A general advise I could give you is that you always install the following frameworks upon a clean install of Windows:
1) .NET 4.5 redistributable framework;
2) C++ 2005 redistributable framework;
3) Java runtime;
4) DirectX 10.0c or 11.

Make sure you have installed those. Rare errors could be depending upon missing one of it.

But you have to be more specific what errors you get please."

I got the same frameworks and also peerblock, firefox, gfwl and foobar.

Are you really sure you didn't install other virtual drive sofware next to Daemontools?
Maybe it's still running as an application or service, which will conflict upon calling the same function in the kernel dll's.

Try to delete all emulation sofware and do it again please, this time only with daemontools lite with all emulation features, which is what you will need as a pirate :-)
But to narrow it down, please reboot in safe mode, start up daemontools and mount. Let's see from there. If it works, there is an app or service running next to daemontools.

I doubt it has anything to do with new pc's, as they are all dependend to the cpu instruction set.

,ada357345,2011-05-28T10:39Z,"I've downloaded this and it works fine with no problems at all.

1. Mount image.
2. Enter all 1's for activation key. Don't copy and paste the key. Enter it manually - just hold down the 1 key.
3. Tick create shortcut on desktop during installation. Give it some time - it might seem like it is stuck but it is not, it has to copy 15GB of data so that takes a while. Took me 10 minutes. Try to install game on a seperate drive if you have one. It will make a big difference in performance.
4. Copy the crack over and replace original files. I've scanned them with Avast 6.0 and they're clean.
5. Double click desktop shortcut to play.

This should work for EVERYONE, even those complaining that it doesn't work. Yes, it works.

Make sure you have the latest of:
- Windows updates
- Graphics drivers
- DirectX
- Games for Windows Live

One thing that didn't work for me is the 'Upload to Youtube' feature. Did anyone get this to work? Does it work with cracked games or do you need a genuine copy?

Did you let the game connect to dirt servers? If so, it could be patched and that's why you get the error.

Try to update to the newest or older drivers. Maybe their are issues with driver of your card.

1) go to my deamon tools lite in preferences=>integration=>select all=>apply(mount on the first device unchecked), then go to advanced=>select all=>apply
2) mount dirt3.iso
3) install the game(type X for key), maybe you'll think it stuck on some part, but just wait, it will install
4) after install click finish and go to see in control panel if GFWL was installed if not go to your mounted drive, map GFWL and install it
5) copy all files from map SKIDROW in your game install directory, it should copy fine, if not try to disable antivirus program and firewall
6) download DiRT 3 [MULTI5] No-DVD/Fixed Image from GAMECOPYWORLD
7) mount DIRT3.mds file with deamon tools
8) start DIRT3.exe and enter the game
9) when ask for autosave press YES
10) in menu find LIVE, navigate with back space and keys find tab where you create profile, go down with key you should see create local profile then just press enter and create it 
10) try to play DIRT TOUR, then exit the game and launch it again
11) when ask you to type live id just pres ESC, then LOAD PROFILE should pop up, enter your profile and play with your previous SAVE

skidrow.dll in particular, I think this is one reason why some people are seeing why can't copy and paste these files or that they are mysteriously gone after a system restart. Most likely it is because Windows Defender (windows 7) or your anti virus programs are deleting them for your system's health.

The only thing I'm wondering, who else can get the save profile to work where they didn't use the three .dll files? mw1987 says he can, who else???

It's either your antivirus or firewall that is deleting the files behind your back or preventing you from copying them.
I don't know what software you use but make sure that you add exceptions for those files in your AV and firewall.

Setup your antivirus and firewall to NOT scan or go throught the Dirt 3 folder AT ALL. Completely disable your AV and FW before copying the files. If it doesn't work try it in Safe Mode."

all u need to do to make it work is to restore the original bin32.dll file or what ever its name is.

so it will go like the following:

1- install the game
2- apply crack (3 DLL files)
3- start the game to make it recognize ur local GFWL account and make it to auto save, also u can play a race or 2 to make sure
4- remove all 3 crack DLLs
5- restore the original bink32.dll file
6- mount the mini-image will all emulation options turned on

@nitrosnail & EVERYONE

That's not a virus. This is a just a false alarm due to the way the DLL files is packed. The packed files signature can match some virus signatures that use the same packing method. If you look carefully at the scan results you'll see that they're all gneneral warnings and not a specific virus.

Another proof that these files are free of viruses is I have a firewall and these DLLs have never ever tried to access the internet. A real virus will most likely try to access the internet in order to infect other computers or report to a command server.
My computer is doing fine as well. No sign of virus damage AT ALL and I play the game everyday with this crack (the one in this torrent) installed.

You have to learn to distinguish between real viruses and false alarms.

The DLL files are 100% virus free. If you get a warning it is just a false alarm.

I have downloaded many torrents from you and you are the best maker with torrents...

BUT! in this game im sorry to say, that the SKIDROW.dll file got virus.

I got Norton Antivirus and im not joking about this. If you got a bad virusprogram, i would not downloaded this. My Norton program was almost corrupting, but because its one of the best virusprograms it fixed it. 

But one problem, my pc are going a little bit later now when i got this. Maybe its because of the virus, Norton Antivirus cant remove.

Btw, i have downloaded maybe 50-60 gb's from you and i have never seen this...

I followed these instructions

 ada357345 at 2011-05-28 10:39 CET:
I've downloaded this and it works fine with no problems at all.

1. Mount image.
2. Enter all 1's for activation key. Don't copy and paste the key. Enter it manually - just hold down the 1 key.
3. Tick create shortcut on desktop during installation. Give it some time - it might seem like it is stuck but it is not, it has to copy 15GB of data so that takes a while. Took me 10 minutes. Try to install game on a seperate drive if you have one. It will make a big difference in performance.
4. Copy the crack over and replace original files. I've scanned them with Avast 6.0 and they're clean.
5. Double click desktop shortcut to play.

This should work for EVERYONE, even those complaining that it doesn't work. Yes, it works.

Make sure you have the latest of:
- Windows updates
- Graphics drivers
- DirectX
- Games for Windows Live

One thing that didn't work for me is the 'Upload to Youtube' feature. Did anyone get this to work? Does it work with cracked games or do you need a genuine copy?

Thanks
-------------------------------------------------

Youtube doesn't work which isn't a problem for me.
If there is an error saying the right disk isn't inserted it is due to your antivirus. It happened to me and I had to disable resident shield on AVG and re-copy over the crack.

Yeah you can go to 1920x1080p, but I can go even higher resolution than that on PC.

,SATURNIANTITAN,2011-07-03T14:15Z,"The Media.cab errors are caused not by x32 vs x64 incompatibility but by trying to install the game using the wrong installer.
It may seem like you install the game using 'Setup.exe' but this is a pirate game remember, you must bypass as many security checks as possible.
So, you install the game using 'Game.exe' also found in the disc image's root folder.
This install is simple and doesn't ask for a serial key or anything like that, and also will correctly find the Media.cab files.

 How in the hell can you use a computer and not know what it means to copy something!?  This is not some weird slang.  Copy means to copy. 

It's simple.  When you right-click somthing, there is an option that says ""Copy""  That's what you do.  And then you find the installation folder located where the game was installed.  Go to computer (or in most cases it's ""My computer"") 

Click on your c drive (C:)  And go into your program files.  If you're OS is Windows 7 then it's in the ""Program Files (x86).  Once you're in, look for the folder called Codemasters.  Click on the Dirt3 folder and then right-click once again and then click ""paste""

Or what you could do is simply click and drag the cracked contents into the installation folder.  Either way."

Game works perfect so far. Just copy from skidrow folder to game folder. Fast way to get to your game folder is to right click the shortcut and choose (open file folder). Copy crack there and start game. If its crashing, or wont start, you prob do not have system requirements. If your comp is old or you do not have a 500mb vid card or better, you should allways google (Game-name), then system requirements before dling a new game. Will save you time and aggro

Installation takes time and it may look like stuck in the beginning.

Created offline profile (already did in Dirt2 and it picked up by itself)

Installed SKIDROW Dirt3 Update Patch and replace the new skidrow.dll along with other files (remember disable McAfee OnAccess Scan)

Downloaded SKIDROW DLC and pasted in local windows profile folder as mentioned

That being said have you driven a real rear wheel drive rally car in the dirt, because you do steer to a degree with the back of the car. 
IMHO current AWD Rally cars have removed a LOT of the skill necessary to drive hard on gravel, mud and snow etc. This is why there are NO AWD Drift Cars as a rule.

You have to be sure when you paste the crack the antivirus is disabled(this prevents it from deleting the files that you copy)

Then make sure that after you have done copying the files you change the properties of all the files that you have copied to read only.

This method will prevent any other errors.

PS. also for the  ""Please wait while windows configures DiRT 3"" thing, this is the process that it installs the game, so pls wait for it to finish.(time varies from system to system)
Everything works perfectly.

YOUR basically creating an xbox live account online , after you have done that , login microsoft games with the name and password YOUVE CREATED , Then Accept the Terms and continue ... it will bring you back to a login screen on Microsoft games ... Ones thats Done ... Click Setup and Install Dirt 3 ... Problem Fucking Solved :)"
,SoClouded,2011-08-31T10:25Z,"Its insulting to comment a Skidrow torrent and say it isn't working, it is your own incompetence which will not allow it to work.
I followed these instructions

ada357345 at 2011-05-28 10:39 CET:
I've downloaded this and it works fine with no problems at all.

1. Mount image.
2. Enter all 1's for activation key. Don't copy and paste the key. Enter it manually - just hold down the 1 key.
3. Tick create shortcut on desktop during installation. Give it some time - it might seem like it is stuck but it is not, it has to copy 15GB of data so that takes a while. Took me 10 minutes. Try to install game on a seperate drive if you have one. It will make a big difference in performance.
4. Copy the crack over and replace original files. I've scanned them with Avast 6.0 and they're clean.
5. Double click desktop shortcut to play.

This should work for EVERYONE, even those complaining that it doesn't work. Yes, it works.

Make sure you have the latest of:
- Windows updates
- Graphics drivers
- DirectX
- Games for Windows Live

One thing that didn't work for me is the 'Upload to Youtube' feature. Did anyone get this to work? Does it work with cracked games or do you need a genuine copy?

Thanks
-------------------------------------------------

Youtube doesn't work which isn't a problem for me.
If there is an error saying the right disk isn't inserted it is due to your antivirus. It happened to me and I had to disable resident shield on AVG and re-copy over the crack.

Cheers for the UL ES

Alt + Enter to get full screen.
To use 360 control you have to put it into a usb before starting the game.
To save, get past the first 15 races or so and exit back through the menus untill there is a list. In the list there is a options menu, select that and there is a save option. Press that and save it manually. Auto saves dont hold the info for some reason.
If your keyboard goes crazy then pull out of usb, close game and put it back in the usb.
Change graphics options have the correct aspect ratio as the resolution, for example 1920 x 1080 is 16:9 aspect ratio. 
The game gets better as you learn the vehicle set up options and racing buggies in the night on ice with headlamps is amazing.

Make sure to disable antivirus when you extract the files (on desktop), that way the files will remain 100% functional, then copy/paste the .dll and .exe into the installation folder and add exceptions in your antivirus with paul.dll and SKIDROW.dll before re-activate your antivirus.
