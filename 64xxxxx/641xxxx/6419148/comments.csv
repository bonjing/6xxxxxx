,Kashxk,2011-05-26T23:00Z,"Hey guys, do comment about this;
Is it a real Limited Edition?
If yes, what are the special things that you get?
Thanks."
,MitsEvX,2011-05-28T01:27Z,"Tested and it's working great! :D

I can almost play this on the max. settings (except the 8XMSAA (I set 4X)) on my E8400 C2D @ 3.0 GHz and my Sapphire HD 5670! I was a little bit surprised because of this, but exactly hitting the system requirements (it recommends a HD 5670) will always gives you a benefit I think....Thanks a bunch! :D

I don't know yet if this is real a limited edition, but I believe AiTB ;-) Maybe it has to do with the things you can get at the Live Marketplace...."
