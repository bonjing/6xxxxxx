    Aliens return to earth after 10 million years to see what has become     
    of the human experiment they have created only to be disappointed by     
    what they find. After landing they come upon Vernon a homeless bum       
    and decide that earthlings are untidy and figure crossing a vacuum       
    and a human will elimate the problem as well as create a better race     
    of beings. The experiment however goes awry after one of the aliens      
    pee in Vernon's bottle of gin which makes him insanely in love with      
    the vacuum Dusty which was brought to life by the aliens. Things get     
    a tad bit crazy from here as Dusty tries to reproduce and Vernon         
    tries hard to find Dusty.
