Having returned victorious from their battle with Frieza, the Z-fighters can at last breathe a collective sigh of reliefâ€¦ But they wonÃ¢Â€â„¢t have long to rest. A new host of villains has appeared, ready to wreak havoc on the Earthâ€”and Goku, the Z-FightersÃ¢Â€â„¢ greatest hero is still missing!

In the face of these new dangers, a mysterious youth with Super Saiyan powers has come bearing a bleak prediction for the future: in just three yearsÃ¢Â€â„¢ time, an evil greater than any the Z-Fighters have ever faced will emerge to cast a shadow of destruction and despair over the Earth. And if the young SaiyanÃ¢Â€â„¢s prediction is correct, the Z-Fighters will have to train like they have never trained before in order to have any hope against these seemingly unstoppable foesâ€”the Androids!
