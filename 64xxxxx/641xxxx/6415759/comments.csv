[V],twentyforty,2011-05-23T21:04Z,"@guitarblues14 & ALL Supernatural fans:

DO NOT download from ZERO if you already have my encodes.

1.) Load and start torrent by dark_defender and keep'm running few minutes, till folder and few files (files are empty even if they look fine) are created.
2. ) Stop the torrent.
3.) Find all my encodes you have and COPY them in that newly created directory - when asked OVERWRITE emty files
4.) Do Force ReCheck right clicking on stopped torrent
5.) ReCheck should find files you've put there - and you'll be at higher percentage to start with
6.) Press Start

Please, by doing so, you'll be doing a favor to yourself (not downloading same stuff twice) and - to fellow downloaders, who would have something to exchange.

Please, do not just leech. You are better than the rest. Exchange bytes given during the download - that would be only way to finish at all - dark_defender and myself (for a help, just for short time) would seed with activated Initial seeding."
