It is the time of the year when the Summer beach parties are not long away and the wine will no doubt start flowing, so a timely re seed of this classic is in order I think.

The song tells the story of a pimp-like \"afro-gipsy, rastafari\" character named Diego who walks into a crowded nightclub at midnight, and the DJ, as he sees Diego walk in, plays the \"twelve-o\'clock anthem\", \"the song he desires most\", which happens to be the 1979 rap hit \"Rapper\'s Delight\" by Sugarhill Gang. The first verse of Rapper\'s Delight: \"I say the hip hop, the hippie...\", pronounced phonetically in Spanish the way it would sound to someone who does not understand English, becomes the chorus of The Ketchup Song. Although technically meaningless and sometimes referred to as gibberish, the chorus is a more-or-less phonetic pronunciation of the first verse almost in its entirety.[citation needed]

I said a hip hop, the hippie, the hippie
    AserejÃ© ja de jÃ© de jebe
do the hip hip hop, a you don\'t stop
    tu de jebere sebiunouva
the rockin\' to the bang bang boogie say up jumped the boogie
    majabi an de bugui
to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
    an de buididipÃ­

The song was performed by a three-girl Spanish group called Las Ketchup, and had a distinctive accompanying dance known as \"The Ketchup Dance\". The song is performed in 180 beats per minute and in the key D# minor.
[edit] Reception and adaptations

For the release in Brazil, a version of song was sung in PortuÃ±ol and featured a Brazilian \"girl band\", named Rouge, alongside Las Ketchup. This pushed the album\'s sales up and eventually led to over 2 million copies sold in Brazil alone.

The song was used in the Christian De Sica\'s 2002 film Natale sul Nilo, as Soundtrack.

The song was remade in La Vida Mickey 2 by Walt Disney Records. In 2004, this song was included on the popular children\'s album series, Kidz Bop 4.

The popular German political comedy program Die Gerd-Show took the music and made a parody to the lyrics, called \"Der Steuersong\" (The Tax Song) for the taxation policies of the former German chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der.

This song is an example of a mondegreen, in this case one in which the lyrics of the original song are reinvented because of a linguistic difference.

Charo performed the song in a promotion for the American morning show Today Show and later released it to YouTube.

The song was the 50th best-selling single of the 2000 decade in UK.[1]

Most recently, Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio ranked the song at #52 on the list of the 100 Worst Songs Ever, asking, \"How could such an inoffensive condiment inspire a song that unfolds in so many different, annoying ways?\"[2]
