,xplor3r,2011-05-24T07:55Z,"well this is my third time i'm downloading the game , meaning that i've encountered a crash problem on e level ( after finishing the level , it crashed .. some errors appears saying some files are missing ) ... anyway i've trie with 1.0 , with 1.1 ..now let's see if it works 


- the crash is on the disco level ( i don't know it's original level name ) ... so after you hit the level exit ( in that hole ) ... and in store you hit the door to exit ... crash    ....

- i hope this works .... thank you"
,xplor3r,2011-05-24T09:44Z,"nope ... the same crash ... i've tried playing on another pc , and encountered the same crash problem on the same level ( disco level ) ... 

-  now i'm working to see if i can skip that error with Cheat Engine ( maybe there's somthing that triggers level skiping ) ... 

-  well thank ... maybe there's another update patch released"
