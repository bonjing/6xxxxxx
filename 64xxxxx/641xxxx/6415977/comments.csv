,annabelle31,2011-05-23T17:17Z,"Very interesting book, however, it's barely readable due to the format it is in.

I'd love to see a clean version of it.

Regardless, thanks for sharing!"
,orucsschmaf,2011-05-23T17:52Z,"@annabelle31 The alternative was a very annoying compiled HTML document,that's why pages differ in size. There isn't a cleaner version on the net,I know ,I've been searching for this book for months now. "
,annabelle31,2011-05-23T19:37Z,"I know this is the best that could be made without a lot of manual intervention. I appreciate your effort and was in no way trying to take away from that.

I can't find a better version either, only the html version. Can't afford the paper version, even after 15 years it is still very expensive."
