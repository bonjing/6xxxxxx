The mid-1950's was a dangerous time to be a race car driver.  Of the 33 drivers who started the 1955 Indianapolis 500, 14 would be dead within 8 years.  The exciting 1955 race was won by a comparative newcomer to the track, nevertheless, the year will always be remembered as the tragic end to the fabulous "Bill Vukovich Era" at Indy.  One of the legendary drivers of all time, Vuky, driving a new type of car called a "roadster" was in sight of victory in 1952 when mechanical trouble sidelined him while leading.  He became forever famous by winning the race in both 1953 and 1954, but his tragic crash in 1955 is still a topic for discussion by veteran race fans to this day.   "The Unforgettable 500" shows this historic race in COLOR, while the "The '55 500" is a very rare vintage B & W film which gives an interesting, although different, perspective of the event.  The wreck is shown in detail and in color, plus three pre-race driver interviews.
