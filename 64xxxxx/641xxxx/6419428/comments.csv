,p3ns3ur,2011-09-24T22:40Z,"Thanx Youssef!  Fighting adhd myself - one item helps me more than most: Ipod Touch.
Multiple alarms, multiple snoozes, online sync with calendars, email and ebay on pod, yada yada.

Keeps me focused in good times - bad times are served by 10k songs and 30k books haha.

Good luck - Remember: it is NOT a disease - it's parallell processing! (Too bad the efficient OS is called dexamphetamine..)

We come mentally with UNIX RISC blade server installed - of course linearheads with monoprocessing will give us hard times ;-)"

thank you so much man i swear i recognize people who knows what the hell ADHD is actually, and you mentioned a lot of thing that 'im really related too i was also thinking about using google calendar so that i can keep myself focused because i'm really having big trouble with my studies jumping from here to here(economy, physics, dutch, french english, japanese and also arabics) those are the subjects that i should study but i always find myself reading some books of computer science or psychology and i think i can really manage it but the big trouble is the chaos i can't sync those things not to mention some behavioral problem that caused me a lot of trouble with firends family and even my profs, but anyway how could i help it the devil is inside my mind and he is playing tricks on me, why the hell we do hirt the people who means a lot for us in this cursed life,..... i think i should stop."
