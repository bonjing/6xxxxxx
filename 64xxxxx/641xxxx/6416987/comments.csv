For example -

CTU -""Game.Of.Thrones.S01E01.Winter.Is.Coming.720p.HDTV.x264-CTU"" worked perfectly for the first three episodes -

MrMoody- ""Game.of.Thrones.S01E04.Cripples.Bastards.and.Broken.Things.720P.HDTV.DD5.1.x264-MrMoody"" worked perfectly for episodes 4 and 5 (I can't find episode 6)

EbP - ""Game of Thrones S01E06 720p HDTV DD5.1 x264-EbP.eng"" worked perfectly for episode 6

I'm also using the latest version of Media Player Classic-Home Cinema (http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/) with K-Lite Codec Mega Pack (http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_mega_codec/) with the 7.1.8 update (http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Codec-Packs-Video-Codecs/KLite-Mega-Codec-Pack.shtml)."
