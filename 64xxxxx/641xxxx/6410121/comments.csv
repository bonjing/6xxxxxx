,ananoymous1,2011-07-29T00:08Z,Correction: Just the first chorus is censored.
,MPAAss,2011-07-29T16:39Z,Why would only one chorus be censored??
,MPAAss,2011-07-29T17:04Z,"Has some sort of ad before the song starts...

it's so hard to find a good version of this remix, which isnt the crappy clean version and doesnt have ads of various radio stations :@"
