ATTENTION:
This release is in an ANAGLYPH 3D format. It can be played on any TV
or Monitor, all that is required is a pair of anaglyph Green/Magenta
3D glasses and your good to go! Enjoy the movie!

Notez:
Here is the Anaglyph 3D version of Drive Angry 3D! Directed by
Patrick Lussier (Director of 'My Bloody Valentine 3D' & before
directing, he was the long time film editor for Wes Craven) and
starring Nicolas Cage, William Fichtner & Amber Heard. Get
ready for fun and bloody good time imo. Once again used the
Green Magenta Anaglyph format on this one, due the heavy dosage
of blood in the film, and Red/Cyan often turns the reds brown/black.
Encoded to Green/Magenta Anaglyph 3D from a Stereoscopic 1080p 
Half Side-by-side 3D source. Enjoy!

Huge Thanks once again go out once again to a certain private 3D 
community. Thanks once again for all of the amazing work you guys do!
