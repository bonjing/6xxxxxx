Useful tips to help achieve a more professional level of speech
Our speech and voice can say as much about us as the clothes we wear, the car we drive, or even the newspapers and magazines we read.
We live and work in a global market - but English is still regarded as the international language of business. In an effective but light-hearted talk, you will be taken through easy exercises and given helpful hints and top tips on how best to use your voice and tidy up your speech, giving you confidence and helping you to make the best impression possible - whether at work or when socializing.

It is aimed primarily at those who have American English as their first language, but it is also useful for those with English as their second language.

Topics covered include:
Valley of the Lost Consonants
Incomprehensible Vowel syndrome
Reconnectin' with your word endings
Learning, like, not to like, say 'like'
Losing those upward inflections!
