When Brian Karterâ€™s mother dies; he is surprised to learn that he has inherited The Sanctuary, home to her controversial experimental addiction treatment center. During a tour of the decrepit building with his friends and a mysterious associate of his mother, it becomes clear that something sinister lies beneath the surface. Despite their misgivings, the group follows a secret passageway underground and comes to a terrible realization: Brianâ€™s mother built a revolutionary machine that cured people of their addictions but, as a side effect, caused those addictions to materialize in the form of mutant children hungry for human flesh, now living in the bowels of the abandoned building. With the mutant children hunting the group as prey, Brian and his friends fight to stay alive against the inconceivable and soon realize that some things are better left hidden.
