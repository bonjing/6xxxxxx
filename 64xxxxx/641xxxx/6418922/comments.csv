Wait... that's not right... What I meant WAS...

Oh look... like EVERYONE else... this is NOT complete. I SWEAR I'M THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS ABOUT THE 2 HR SEASON FINALE!!! Making it episode 24!!! And on this list... I do NOT see... an episode 24...

Congradulations... you SUCK like everyone else who doesn't know what they're talking about... Just taking someones torrent, reuploading it, and calling it their own... Why don't you contribute to those uploading and seed theirs... But NOOO... ""I want people to upload MINE""

Ughhh...."

But I still stand by what I said about seeding other peoples files instead of reuploading them yourself... "
