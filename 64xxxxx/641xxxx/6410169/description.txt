PLOT:
The English-language horror/thriller begins when Brian Karter s
mother dies, he is surprised to learn that he has inherited The
Sanctuary, home to her controversial experimental addiction treatment
center. During a tour of the decrepit building with his friends and a
mysterious associate of his mother, it becomes clear that something
sinister lies beneath the surface. Despite their misgivings, the group
follows a secret passageway underground and comes to a terrible
realization: Brian s mother built a revolutionary machine that cured
people of their addictions but, as a side effect, caused those
addictions to materialize in the form of mutant children hungry for
human flesh, now living in the bowels of the abandoned building. With
the mutant children hunting the group as prey, Brian and his friends
fight to stay alive against the inconceivable, and soon realize that
some things are better left hidden
