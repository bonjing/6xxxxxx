From Wiki:


Robert Clarke Seger (born May 6, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist and pianist.

As a locally successful Detroit-area artist, he performed and recorded as The Bob Seger System throughout the 1960s. By the early 1970s, he had dropped the "System" from his recordings, and he continued to strive for national success with other various bands. In 1973 he put together "The Silver Bullet Band," an evolving group of Detroit-area musicians, with whom he became most successful. In 1976, he achieved national fame with two albums, the live record Live Bullet, and the studio record Night Moves. On his studio albums he also worked extensively with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, appearing on several of Seger's best selling singles and albums.

A roots rocker with a classic raspy, shouting voice, Seger was first inspired by Little Richard and Elvis Presley, along with James Brown.[1] He wrote and recorded songs that dealt with blue-collar themes. Seger has recorded many rock and roll hits, including "Night Moves", "Turn the Page", and "Like a Rock", and also co-wrote the Eagles number one hit "Heartache Tonight". His iconic signature song "Old Time Rock and Roll" was named one of the Songs of the Century in 2001. With a career spanning five decades, Seger continues to perform and record today.

"Old Time Rock & Roll" charted #2 as most played Jukebox Singles of all Time, second only to Patsy Cline's "Crazy".

Seger's songs have been covered by many artists including Thin Lizzy and Metallica.

Seger was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.







Greatest Hits 1994



Greatest Hits is a compilation album by Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band, released in 1994 (see 1994 in music). Certified 8 times platinum, it is Seger's most successful album to date. In December 2009, Billboard and Nielsen SoundScan confirmed that with nearly nine million copies sold, Bob Seger's Greatest Hits was the decade's best-selling catalog album in the United States, even out-selling The Beatles' 1 and Michael Jackson's Number Ones.

Californian photographer, Karen Miller, took photos of the band as part of two photoshoots for the album. The most popular pictures out of the first photoshoot were the railroad track scenes taken on the Southern Pacific Railroad Tracks north of Mojave, California. The single picture of Seger holding his guitar became the cover photo as well as the most recognized photograph of Seger to date. Another photograph of the entire band on the same tracks was used for the centerfold of the booklet that came with the It's A Mystery CD, released the following year in 1995.

Other photos on the album include pictures of Seger's newborn son, Cole Seger. The back cover of Seger's son at a water pump was taken at Seger's home at the time in Miami, Florida. Cole was 17 months old at the time. The inside of the booklet includes photos of Silver Bullet Band members Craig Frost, Chris Campbell, and Alto Reed with their kids as well. Seger's manager, Punch Andrews, was skeptical about the idea of using the band's children as album art at first. However, Seger had seen it done before with other artists and insisted on the photographs being used on the final copy of the CD's insert.
