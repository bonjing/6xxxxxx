,XxM24Ty,2011-07-09T08:33Z,"THANK YOU! I am the biggest Bob Seger fan from my early days living in Michigan. I have ALL of his records in MP3, and this makes maybe only the second album I found in FLAC!

BTW: Somebody please try to rip and post Bob Seger Greatest Hits Vol #2 --- IMHO Vol #2 Is FAAAAR Better than Vol #1, but few fans even know that there is a Greatest Hits Vol #2!!!!!

Thank YOU!

Please upload Greatest Hits Vol #2 as it is a very RARE CD but has the best music on it! (imho!) - Long Live FLAC."
,XxM24Ty,2011-07-10T11:48Z,"Another big THANK YOU to the uploaded!! -

I just wanted to pass the word that Bob Seger's Greatest Hits Vol #2 (Second of 2 set) from 2003 was just uploaded last night in MP3 192kbps format. We all hope somebody can make a FLAC copy straight from the retail CD of  Greatest Hits Vol #2, but it's a rare CD that many Seger fans are unaware of. All I could dig up was 192kbps Mp3s, which sound pretty good, but many prefer FLAC.

There are many great songs on Vol #2, in fact Seger could easily fill three CDs of Greatest Hits. If interested in Bob Seger's Greates Hits Vol #2 with 16 of his best songs in MP3 192kbps
please checkout the new upload of Vol #2: 

MP3 192kbps - Seger's Greatest Hits Vol #2:

Vol #2 helps to complete Seger's collection, but there are still some great songs that are not on either CD.

If any music collector has Seger's Greatest Hits Vol #2- about a million poor fans greatly long for Vol #2 in Flac. It is a rare CD, however Amazon and other places do have it for sale for under $10.00.

Sorry for hijacking the comments, I just thought some may wish to listen to both Volume's 1 and 2 of Seger's Greatest Hits, thats all. 

Thanks for your upload Kitlope! Peace."
