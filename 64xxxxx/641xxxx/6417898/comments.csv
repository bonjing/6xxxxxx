It has a 1TeraByte internal drive and I can transfer torrent downloads to it through my home network, and ply back on my samsung 3D T.V. Before in order to play the M4 files I had to convert them to mkv using mkvmerge GUI. I was worried that it would wear out the usb connector and wanted a better solution."

however every other release not made by you, works on samsung tv. if you own a samsung tv DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS.

(would be great if you found a format that works on all tv's.)"
,Gjura,2011-08-07T16:32Z,The reason it don't work on Samsung 3D TV:s is that the frame rate is 50 and Samsung handles max 30.
