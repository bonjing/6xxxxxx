,sagarzz,2011-08-18T13:12Z,add registry entries manually to be able to launch the game from the official site.
,sagarzz,2011-08-18T13:13Z,"32 Bit:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free]
""Installation Dir""=""C:\\Program Files\\EA Games\\Battlefield Play4Free""
""Language""=""EN"""
,sagarzz,2011-08-18T13:13Z,"64 Bit:
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free]
""Installation Dir""=C:\\Program Files\\EA Games\\Battlefield Play4Free""
""Language""=""EN"""
,Jevin,2011-11-29T19:03Z,"Well after some time I figured what Sagarzz meant to say;

Here is a more detailed description of what you actually have to do with registry editor.

Go to registry editor; (Windows key on keyboard + R) and type: 'regedit' without the '' and press Enter.

Go to:
32-bit: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free]

64-bit:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free]

They may not be there;
if they're not there: Create them.

Then create in the 'folder' Battlefield Play4Free a new String Value;

1st one:
Name: ""Installation Dir"" (Note: without the quotation!)
After that double click; and put in the following information:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free""  (Note: without the quotation!)

For 32-bit: ""C:\Program Files\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free""  (Note: without the quotation!)

2nd one:
Name: ""Language"" (Note: without the quotation!)
After that double click; and put in the following information: ""EN"" (Note: without the quotation!)

NOW it should work;)
I mean, it worked for me:P"
,Jevin,2011-11-29T19:09Z,"whoops;
EDIT:
64-bit:
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic Arts\EA Games\Battlefield Play4Free]

of course;)"
,ykumar00,2012-02-08T17:59Z,PLEASE PLEASE Upload The newest version!! The official site does not seem to be wokring for me. The download does not start at all. PLEASE !!
,serdude1,2012-03-22T18:34Z,"it is 22 of march 2012 18:32 hours [6:32 pm]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREElectronic ArtsEA GamesBattlefield Play4Free]
