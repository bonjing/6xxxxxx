His girlfriend Priya (Jasmin Bhasin) is stinking rich, and the only way to gain her family's consent is to play the rich boyfriend himself.

In order to get away from there and launch her own business, she reaches Chennai and is caught by the police.

Bharath Chakravarthy (Bharath) aims to become a famous rock star and he starts his journey with his friends, including Laasya (Vega Tamotia), to give live performances. His mother doesn't like the idea of her son wasting his life, so she wants him to go into the army like his father. Naturally, Bharath resists the idea, gains a live gig in Chennai and sets off.
