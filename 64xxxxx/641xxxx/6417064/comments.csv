YOU are a sad idiot, cvvvcvvv!
You SHOULD be saying Thank You!!! Are you suffering from brain damage or just plain stupid?

Anyways: Thank You!"
,Livens,2011-10-21T03:48Z,cvvvcvvv is right... Burning in subtitles is retarded. Dont DL this unless you will be needing to see swed subtitles throughout.
,Alenthas,2012-01-21T15:27Z,why would you burn subtitles you jerkoff?
,enonumus,2012-02-08T11:43Z,"Every single ""Swesub"" torrent I've ever seen has the Swedish subtitles burned in.  For the life of me I fail to understand why they don't put them in a separate track so the entire rest of the world can enjoy the movie too, without having to watch subtitles in a language that only about .1% of the world's population speaks.  What a waste.  "
