,IXIRaiN,2011-05-22T06:17Z,Nice job man.  The quality isn't perfect but still good.
,natehbabeh,2011-05-22T13:30Z,"THANKS MAN! been a great fan of OC, even though I downloaded this, I'm still gonna buy the cd and go to their concert in my country. it's just that I can't wait to hear the songs. :D hope you can post higher-quality versions though :)"
[T],woollytorrent,2011-05-22T15:37Z,"Yeah please excuse the quality, its 192 kbps but its a leak so hopefully there will be a 320 kbps version out soon. And January 28th, 1986 is an interlude, not a full song :D its the full thing

,IXIRaiN,2011-05-23T08:21Z,"Oh another thing Woolly, you're missing the song How I Became the Sea.  It doesn't matter to me cuz I already have the song but it is one of my favorite off the new album."
,redtar,2011-05-28T00:55Z,How I became the Sea is a bonus track.  This is the complete album
,jaxco,2011-06-01T20:29Z,This is great! I'm glad it's not full quality so when I buy it when it comes out I will enjoy it even more! Thanks!
