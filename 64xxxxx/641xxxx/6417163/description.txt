"Arrival"

The White House is gripped by a power 
struggle of historic proportions, pitting 
Martinez (Blair Underwood) and Chief of 
Staff Peel (guest star Roger Bart, 
"Desperate Housewives") against Jarvis 
(Bill Smitrovich) and his secret ally, 
Sophia (Laura Innes). Elsewhere, Sean 
(Jason Ritter), Vicky (Taylor Cole), 
Sterling (Zeljko Ivanek), and Simon (Ian 
Anthony Dale) race to stop the dispersion 
points for the virus. Meanwhile, Leila 
(Sarah Roemer) fights for her life. But 
it all may be too late -- as the portal 
begins to open, sending tremors across 
the globe.

Enjoy :)
