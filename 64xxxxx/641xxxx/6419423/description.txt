                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Featuring a man who needed urgent treatment to save his sight after cement dust exploded
 in his face, a tree surgeon whose fingers were crushed by a log splitter, and a man who
 injured his leg on a discarded toilet in his mother's back garden. Plus, a boy who got
 a pencil stuck in his ear, and the story of how a woman survived a 200ft fall from a
 New Mexico mountain. Narrated by Sheridan Smith.
