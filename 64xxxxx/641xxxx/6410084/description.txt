The third album of the Greeks Dimitris Violitzis
              and Elias Garanis appears like a musical odyssey.  
                                                                 
              Their journey \\\'Across The Sea\\\' leads them to       
              various islands of sound, where the two of them    
              encounter wondrous atmospheres and exciting        
              adventures which create a fantastic epos in their  
              entirety. They explore the depths of a mysterious  
              labyrinth of melodies, get hypnotized by alien     
              siren calls and eventually face the power of       
              really rocky synthesizer riffs. While doing so,    
              again and again the emotional and thrilling        
              atmosphere of a movie soundtrack evolves.          
                                                                
              Together with the grinding, organic bass sounds,   
              which float \\\'Across The Sea\\\' like a golden         
              thread, it becomes pretty clear why Krama          
              appropriately describe their own music as \\\'Power   
              Progressive Trance\\\'. By means of the extensive     
              usage of analogue studio technology the two        
              producers manage to paint their newest work in a   
              refreshing variety of different sound colours and  
              also to create a very cosy feeling of listening
              pressure.
