Until it was reccomended I had never heard of this CD, but took a chance as I love Louden. Its a classic; a seldom seen softer side with a hint of the old ascerbic LW3. Produced by Richard Thomson, the combination of these two geniuses has produced something special. I've no idea how it took me decades to find it.
