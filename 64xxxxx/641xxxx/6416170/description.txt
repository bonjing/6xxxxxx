As Korea's first 3D theatrical movie, erotic melodrama Natalie gets twice the buzz for its technical breakthrough and its racy content. Up-and-coming actress Park Hyun Jin (Miss Gold Digger) makes quite the splash as the sultry dancer who enchants Lee Sung Jae (Dreams Come True) and television star Kim Ji Hoon (Stars Falling From the Sky). Directed by Joo Kyeong Joong (A Little Monk), Natalie especially attracted attention for its 3D bed scenes and mysterious tangle of sex, lies, and secrets.

Sculptor Jun Hyuk (Lee Sung Jae) has created his greatest masterpiece, "Natalie", a sculpture capturing the beauty of woman. At his exhibition, he talks to art critic Min Woo (Kim Ji Hoon) about the inspiration for his sculpture - dance student Mi Ran (Park Hyun Jin) and the passionate love they shared. But Min Woo has a different story to tell about Mi Ran, their intersecting memories revealing an illicit love triangle.
