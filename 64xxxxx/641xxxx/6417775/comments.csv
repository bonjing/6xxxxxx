,wierd-old-guy,2011-09-08T22:42Z,"This appears to be the commercial Enterprise (server) version that is installed from your network, so you could add nodes from it, etc.
If it's a specific company's purchase it might not have all the drivers for a non-commercial platform (sound card, whatever) but you could d/l that obviously....I believe. I am NOT sure however as Red Hat is getting very similar to Suse (Novell) Linux and becoming a business oriented OS."
,r00fio,2011-09-30T17:30Z,new to the linux game. messed around with ubuntu in the past and wasnt impressed. my question is this: it says update. can you perform a clean install with this or only update an older version of redhat? soory if this is a dumb ass question
