,Tinate,2011-05-31T00:03Z,Seed please.
,Tinate,2011-05-31T02:55Z,"Not to spam, or anything, but, what's with 10kb/s?

Please set your upload limit to atleast 5kb, on every torrent. This way, the 200 individuals connected to me, sending me 0.1 kb/s send a decent amount."

,dark_justice1986,2011-08-12T04:35Z,what the fuck? lol.. Someone who doesn't know why VLC player is? VLC player is safe and is actually one of the best video players around. It plays practically anything. I highly recommend it. It does NOT have viruses. I don't know why the fuck you are saying it has a virus.. 
,Tom2e2,2011-08-14T08:04Z,"HELP!! I downloaded this 1.5 days ago and it is still going. Download speed is averaging 0.9kb/s. Current ETA is 2wks...just went down to 0.2kb/s and says ETA is 6wks. Why is this so slow?

Should I just stop and delete and try again? It says 483 seeders, plus since the client has been working for almost two days I have been seeding all my other downloads for over 24 hrs now."
,finisher489,2011-08-19T03:40Z,I reported this to the government because I think this is wrong!!!!! NO MORE PIRATE BAY NO MORE PIRATE BAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUST BUY THE DVD'S OR GET THE CHANNELS
,Dr_Science,2011-08-21T02:45Z,"@finisher489

That's cool. but you should know that this is on free broadcast TV.  You can watch any of these episodes for free on the NET, and NBC supports that.  Also it is not illegal if you own the DVD's just like I do, but I DL from pirate bay so I can have them on my cpu.

Also, get a life if this is the biggest thing you have to worry about in your life.  adopt a child or volunteer at a homeless shelter or anything to use your time more constructively than you are.

but I shouldn't throw stones.  Just try to calm down,  besides this is probly someone just trolling anyway."
,bloodred125,2011-09-24T04:26Z,"rigHT so you support people getting paid when theyve already been paid for doing the office by the sponsors already for making the office. You support the fact they should get paid for not doing anymore work? lol fck you Finisher.!!!!! AND Pirate bay FTW.

If you make more than million dollars for a show in your pocket for profit over a 6 month periods of work, i think you shouldnt even give a sht if you are being watched for free.. 

Peopel out there do labouring everyday 9-5, they dont get paid royalties for going HOME at the end of the day and the work doesnt do itself. These peopel get paid 10 million + for 6 months work AND royalties on top..its a joke."
,mrshakezula,2011-10-10T09:39Z,"@finisher489
Lol How did you ""report it""? Did you just walk in to a local police station or email the president? Like they don't already know about all the shit up for grabs here anyway."
,steller33,2011-11-13T10:59Z,thanks
,Kole97,2011-11-30T12:22Z,"Check out The Office theme song...for those who looking everywhere for it -
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6854321/The_Office_(Theme_song)"
,TheShad0w21,2012-03-16T04:34Z,Will seed at maximum rate indefinitly when done
,WhyPaywhenUcanPirateBay,2012-03-26T01:58Z,haha this is gonna be great. 
,komaxlaredo,2012-05-06T16:25Z,Gracias. excelente calidad de video. Thank you. great video quality.
,LouiseGCA,2012-05-20T21:42Z,"I'm not supporting finisher489 but this torrent IS being tracked so you might  get an unpleasant surprise from your ISP (depending what country you're in, naturally). I know because I got one for ""copyright infringement"" (although probably not thanks to finisher here). Not to discourage seeding, but all Office episodes can be streamed through the-office.vyrantstudios.com in HD if you register just like on piratebay."
