Storyline:


An ex con teams up with federal agents to help them with breaking up a moonshine ring.

Burt Reynolds is Gator McKlusky, a moonshine runner who wages war against corrupt police officials in this two-fisted, four-wheeling action extravaganza. With adrenaline-pumping car chases, bone-crunching brawls and terrific acting by an all-star cast, including Diane Ladd and Laura Dern, White Lightning will give you the jolt of your life!

Gator is serving time in the Arkansas prison when he learns that his brother has been murdered by ruthless Sheriff J.C. Connors (Ned Beatty). Swearing vengeance, Gator agrees to go undercover to expose Connors, going to any lengths to get the goods on the sheriff and make him pay for the crime... with his life.
