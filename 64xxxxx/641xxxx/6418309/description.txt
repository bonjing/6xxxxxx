Turbo C++ v1.01 from Borland.

Released as a freeware by Borland. Had a hard time finding the proper setup on the 

internet so I'm gonna seed this as long as I can.

Installation is pretty simple.

1. Run INSTALL.EXE

2. Enter the drive in which the setup is located. (C:, D:, ...)

3. Enter directory location of the setup. (This uses DOS style directory names 

limited to 8-10 characters, most probably the directory will already be entered.)

4. After that, you get to select where exactly you want to install the software.

5. After installation in complete the setup will ask you to make certain modifications. 

((to your config.sys file which will be located in your root directory.))

(Example:-C:CONFIG.SYS )


Then go to the installed directory and run TC...
