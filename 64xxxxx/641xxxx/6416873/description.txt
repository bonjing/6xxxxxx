                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The programme looks at how the Manchester prison has changed since the infamous riots
 in April 1990, when inmates protested against an outdated system and inhumane conditions.
 Cameras follow Mark Greenwood, who has gained catering qualifications while serving his
 sentence, as he leaves Strangeways to start a new job in the outside world, and
 persistent offender David Charlton returns to cause more trouble for staff.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
