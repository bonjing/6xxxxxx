Radeon HD 4250, VLC Media Player

Pretty sure its the video, because the audio plays fine during the lag.

Made the video still watchable but not enjoyable. ):"

,Glowyrm,2011-06-20T22:22Z,"http://wiki.videolan.org/How_to_save_bookmarks

How to bookmark videos in VLC. I haven't read it myself because I personally believe just pausing it and coming back later is fine, or even starting a few minutes back so I get caught up on what is happening again instead of jumping back into exactly where I was."
,Glowyrm,2011-06-20T22:27Z,"Looking over that VLC wiki, it doesn't seem to be the most elegant or reliable solution and you're better off using another video player if this is a big issue for you.

Here's an article explaining how to do it for WMP via a plugin and KMP which is (almost?) just as great as VLC to most people.

,Glowyrm,2011-06-20T22:54Z,"Sorry for the multiple posts, (this place could use an edit/delete).

It's actually really easy in VLC now that I try it.

The Bookmark option is under Tools > Bookmark (Ctrl + B)

The only way these are usable though are if you load the movie by going to View > Playlist (you have had to open the movie in VLC at least once before for it to show here).

When a video is loaded that particular way, you can open the bookmark list up and go back to certain saved spots in movies with VLC."
