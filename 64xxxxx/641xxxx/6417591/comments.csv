,AlexK1,2011-06-03T23:00Z,"Worked perfectly for me, thanks a lot adnan. -Install win7 from boot and reformat your drive. -Change windows update status to ""Download updates but let me choose what to install."" 
-Find Update KB971033 and select Hide this update. (This update scans your windows files for cracks such as this and gives you the windows genuine messages)
 -Run this loader and follow the directions."
