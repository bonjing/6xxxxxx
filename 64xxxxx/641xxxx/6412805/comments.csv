,ManLemon,2011-05-22T19:18Z,@face_book : Depends on what player you use for the green line to be there or not. It shows in Media Player Classic (CCCP) but doesn't show in VLC for example.

,face_book,2011-05-22T21:32Z,@ManLemon the same green line is in the dvd's too when you burn it with convertxtodvd and watch it from tv with normal dvd player ... so there is an thing that need to be fixed !! and like 35% of ppl are watching the movies with windows media player that is actually inclued in vista and 7 already ..

One will just need a red cyan glasses to view it here are some sources .
I think you should give them a try.

,tim_dawg,2011-05-24T13:00Z,"Hey guys - can anyone confirm if this is the full uncut version? IMDB has stated the following about the runtime:  104 min  | UK: 95 min (cut)  | Australia: 96 min (censored DVD version).

Since YIFY has stated that his up runs at 99 mins, I'm not sure what the score is. This could be the uncut version with the credits removed, for example. But if anyone knows for sure, I'd appreciate the info.

Cheers."
,Robin5555,2011-05-26T19:56Z,"uncut version link :

,tim_dawg,2011-05-27T21:19Z,"Thanks Robin, I see that the link you supplied is the uncut version and has a duration 2 mins longer than YIFY's. However, it's German sub (which doesn't help me) and also doesn't have YIFY's capacity-quality ratio. YIFY - perhaps you're the right person to settle this one. Thanks mate."
,Joab1,2011-06-07T17:57Z,"Fucked up film. And yet amazing; if you were wondering whether or not to watch, defiantly do.
Great quality upload. Thanks YIFY"
,TheSageM,2011-06-08T18:20Z,"This is actually a good film. Is is also NOT the full version. Believe me, those extra 4 minutes make all the difference!"
