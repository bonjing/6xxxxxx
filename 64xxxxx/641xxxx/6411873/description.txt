File size: 1.49 GiB
Duration: 1h 31mn
Subtitle: English,Romanian

Taglines: There are two kinds of people in his up-tight world: his victims and his women. And sometimes you can't tell them apart.

Storyline:

Based on the theme of the individual pitted against the large, impersonal organization. Here the central character 
is an old-fashioned loner of a gunman embroiled with a large-scale, corporate criminal operation behind a respectable-looking 
'front'. Without delving into psychology or motivation, the film places emphasis on action and surface appearances, superbly 
capturing the glossy, depersonalized feel of a 1967 Los Angeles--a nightmare landscape of concrete, glass and coiling freeways.

*I don't take requests because I don't have time and everyone will fill the comment section with them instead of commenting about quality and other tehnical specs of the movies or say thanks.Thank you for understanding!
*For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
*These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
*I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
