,xoferbean,2012-03-16T16:41Z,"I'm confused. You say you've checked it and it all works fine but the runtime for this film is 3h3mins.
The actual runtime is 1h31mins (which you have written in your description). I've tried it in VLC and also in KMPlayer and the runtime is still 3h3mins. I thought it may have been corrupted so deleted it all and redownloaded it but the same thing - 3h3mins. It seems like the first half is the film but the second half is the film with no sound. I've never seen this before and I download a lot of torrents. It seems like great quality apart from that but don't really want to start watching the film to discover something else amiss. Wondered if you'd noticed that or knew why it was doing it. You could probably half the size of the file if you remove the second half. Thanks anyway. Best."
