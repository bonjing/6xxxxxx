These Vinyl rips were recorded on a Denon DP-45F turntable using an Audio Technica AT120E cartridge. The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).
Recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.
iZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.

This is A Lot of work folks!
