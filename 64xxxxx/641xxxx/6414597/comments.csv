,Nephilim83,2011-05-23T07:16Z,"Well, there ya go, people.  Don't read the comments here or you'll have an epic show ruined for you by some asshole who can't let everyone else enjoy it like he did.  

If its uploaded by EZTV just download it, 'cause you know its good.  "

,HouseAtlantic,2011-05-23T08:51Z,"Thank you eztv and people seeding! This is the last time I read comments for this show, because stupid people don't know how to keep their mouth shut. I got things to do besides sit around and read these books, though I'm sure they're just lovely.. Take into account I like the actors, I'm a visual person and I like watching the story unfold their way. If you need any further consideration than that, you can fuck yourself and you're pretty stupid"
,foxdrake,2011-05-23T08:56Z,"i don't give a shit ... put your spoilers, I'll still watch it; gladly."

,Shrimp67,2011-05-23T10:28Z,"Well since so many 12 year olds with tiny dicks want to ruin the enjoyment of others, how about we 20+ year olds with big penises just post how much we thank EZTV and push the restarted comments back where no one will see them?"
,Ezel,2011-05-23T10:37Z,Im just adding a comment that isn't gonna hurt anybody but the bastards.

,demujin,2011-05-23T14:27Z,"Every week I try to download the EZTV version, but I never get above 13 kB/s down speed. Yet I nearly always manage to get around 250 kB/s with other torrents. But it currently says that this torrent has over 8000 more seeders than leechers.?.? 

And to Noobdownloader: This is the full episode, but I have yet to  confirm it personally."

i have been getting cypyright infringement email from COMCAST almost everytime i open a file by FQM. this doesn't happen all the time but apparently there must be tracker. this probably doesn't concern anyone but comcast customers but they CAN cancel your service if you get too many of those notices. 
that's all. somebody who knows more about this than me should look into it. 
that is all"

,MrKingJames,2011-07-15T06:04Z,"QUESTION lol:

is there a point to adding a limit to the amount of seeders on a torrent? This apparently has 20k seeders now, and most bittorrent clients have their seeds defaulted to a limit of 50/torrent, i took off the limit and got 150 more seeders, does this actually make my dl faster?"
,kb1234kb,2011-07-18T22:43Z,WARNING! I have also received a letter from ISP instructing me to cease and desist all illegal downloads. It specifically named this torrent.
