,3idiots,2011-05-24T17:33Z,is it episode 08 or 07 ??
[T],trialNerror,2011-05-25T05:20Z,"This is actually episode 8.
Episode 7 ""Tribal Fishing"" did not air.

I checked at least 3 ep guides before uploading, they all labeled this as ep 8. "
,ryan_8374,2011-06-06T22:56Z,"Amazon lists this as episode 6. ""Tribal Fishing"" is listed on wikipedia as a special. If it airs off the regular schedule, it's usually a special. All 3 seasons have had 7 episodes each.
Zap2it isn't perfect, but I trust it and wikipedia the most.
