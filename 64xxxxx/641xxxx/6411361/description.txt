Quote:
Demo is a twelve-issue limited series of comic books by writer Brian Wood and artist Becky Cloonan, published 2003-2004 by AiT/Planet Lar.

Each issue is an isolated story, but they all revolve around the lives of young people. Originally, the series was intended to focus on young people with supernatural powers -- which many of the issues indeed do -- but as the year progressed, the stories increasingly focused on people, relationships, and emotions, with the "supernatural" angle quietly deemphasized.
