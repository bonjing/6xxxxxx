
Roadster Era race fans and historians are in for a treat with this Dynamic Sportsfilm production made for Mobil Oil Corp.

The 1957 Memorial Day classic will be remembered as the culmination of the Indy 500 driving career of popular veteran Sam Hanks and a new type of car in Victory Lane.  The track itself took on a new look in '57, with a new control tower the focal point of the new tower Terrace grandstand and pit area.  Here's the story of winning car owner George Salih and the yellow #9 Belond Special, with highlights of the changes in race car design at the speedway from the years 1951 to 1957.  Throughout qualifications and the race itself, you'll see the racing personalities and great drivers of 54 years ago in nice close-ups and in action on the track.  The race is a duel between Rathmann, Hanks, Bryan and Russo.

Run time is 34 minutes.
