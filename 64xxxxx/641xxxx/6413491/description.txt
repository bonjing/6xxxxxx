American music legend Hank Williams has long been considered one of the earliest influences on rock and roll and in fact was the first of a very few artists to be inducted in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.  .
 
Williamsâ€™s vocals, steeped in emotion, have influenced generations of rock and Americana artists, and lately have been covered by more rock artists than country acts. In the way he wrote and the way he sang, he set the standard for self-expression and believability that has inspired rock artists from Elvis Presley onward. Rolling Stone named him as one of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Keith Richards, Norah Jones, Beck and countless others have reinterpreted  his songs.  Dylan and John Fogerty both cite him as an early influence, Pearl Jamâ€™s Stone Gossard created a side band in his honor called the Hank Khoir and Neil Young, who owns one of Williams original guitars, wrote  This Old Guitar about it.  
Many journalists refer to Hank Williams as the first rock and roll casualty. He was an original rock and roll rebel, making his music his way without compromise.  Williams songsâ€¦and his searing performances of themâ€¦were intensely personal statements. His simple poeticism is still the benchmark by which popular songs are measured.

This set is an astonishingly great addition to Hank Williams recorded legacy. The 54 songs are all previously unreleased (28 of which are the only existing versions recorded by Hank Williams). These are peak-period Live In The Studio recordings that equal or surpass the quality of Williams studio masters in performance and sound quality (with a few exceptions). Some songs are preceded or followed by studio chatter, conversation, introductions or promotion of the sponsorâ€™s product (Mother's Best Flour) and the effect is like having Hank Williams and his band in the room with you, performing his hits, personal favorite songs and brand new compositions, just for you circa 1951, if you could time travel. And now you can.

This 3-CD box set contains 54 songs Hank and his band the Drifting Cowboys recorded live in the studio for the Motherâ€™s Best Flour Company at the height of his popularity, in 1951.
