,Skeingald,2011-06-03T00:22Z,Is this guaranteed 64 bit OS compatible? 
,Gkkiux,2011-06-04T10:20Z,For me it works. You just need to have resolution change window opened in win7 because otherwise colors are messed up

The only 64-bit OS I've tried it on is Windows Vista, and it works fine. Not sure about the other Windows."
,wanda_5,2011-06-09T07:51Z,Works on Win 7 64-bit.
,l33tp0wn,2011-07-07T11:11Z,thanx for the game its awesome and if the colors stuff up either change the color setting or run in window mode. thats what i did :)
,Nooblet,2011-09-02T01:53Z,"Thanks for the torrent. It's been nearly 20 years since I played this game. Works great on my Vista64 PC, though I did have to click the executable like 4 times before the game would load. Almost gave up, but a day later I tried again and it loaded. No clue why it kept telling me that it couldn't find ""DUKE3D.GRP"" since it was in the same folder as the executable..."
,lkjhasdf,2011-09-09T17:48Z,is this the hd version
,Rated.Mumbai,2011-09-25T06:56Z,Seed Please.. I am stuck at 20% though there are 39 seeders still the download is stuck at 20%. Bit Torrent log says my client wants to receive data but the other peers do not want to send data. I have tried force download as well.
