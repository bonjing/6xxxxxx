         Richmond debates with himself about whether or not to         
         continue in the run for office; authorities are unsure        
         about making an arrest that could help solve a case; the      
         Larsens decide to take part in their own investigation        
          into Rosie's death.

         In spite of FEVER's release having the correct framerate,     
         it still suffers from blended frames throughout. Samples      
          included for comparison. In particular, note the sides of the 
          arms at the start, and the arm going down at :20 in for some  
          obvious examples.
