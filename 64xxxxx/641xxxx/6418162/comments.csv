Never saw the first one--because seeing the second one was--imho--one of the worst wastes of movie ticket money I've ever had the misfortune to spend--turned me OFF from watching ANY Gene Hackman movie for a good 20 years--in fact, the first Gene Hackman movie I have been able to stomach is The Quick and the Dead--and that only because of Sharon Stone's character.  I can still hear him saying to some minor French perp (who didn't understand any English) that he was going to stomp his leg into oatmeal!"

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-26T08:47Z,"Can I say something about?

If I am asked about selection of movies I encode, I have learned long ago that some movies doesn't stand ""test of time"".

And that is basic difference between approach of both trikiti and azrielle. Trikiti have put the movie in his perspective, and that perspective is both ultimately personal (we cannot know what movies he like) and perspective is ""younger"" some twenty years plus, meaning that azrielle's ""judgment"" was established long ago and needles to say, as such should be placed in his personal context, which might be strange to trikiti, so should be vice-versa, but the fact is - individual standards and metrics are very often enigmatic for any other person who doesn't have nor share background, age and mind-set. I also must point the language - what  seems as perfectly acceptable for non-native English speakers, might sound as ultimately ridiculous for native speaker (as azrielle) because native speaker put sayings from the screen in real-life context."

> twentyforty at 2011-05-22 20:18 CET: 
 @jamydoug: Encoded, I and II, as 480p from reasons I explained (grainy, old, bad footage transferred on BluRay 'as is'). Both finished encodes are in upload right now - and it would take whole night. But - torrent would be upped on Tuesday - after the seeding of this one. Be here then - if you are not mad why it wasn't 720p."""

I understood what Gene Hackman's character meant--that he was going to break the guy's legs by snapping them in half using the curb and gutter for leverage, and then stomp the bones until they were so broken and crushed that they would resemble oatmeal when he was through.  But it was an idle threat--he was just saying it to the guy--with a smile on his face the whole time--because the guy couldn't understand what Gene's character was saying.  It was Gene's character's way of saying to the French to ""kiss off, I'll try not to let the door slam me in the butt on my way to the airport, you can keep your miserable damn country!""  Or at least that's what I got out of it.  Just didn't care for the graphic detail--even in jest--which, btw, pretty much sums up the personal character and ""integrity"" of the detective Gene was playing on screen...I HATED him, and by association, couldn't stand Gene Hackman either.

Also, the MPAA was known in the 60's and 70's for awarding Oscars to films that were ""less than popular"" with the audiences that watched them, so the number of awards a movie won was relatively meaningless as a determination of the enjoyability of a movie, and hence the ""worthwhileness"" of seeing it."
