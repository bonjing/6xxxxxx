Pre-"Roadster Era" race fans and historians are in for a treat!

The 1951 Memorial Day Classic was the first 500 mile race ever run in less than four hours.  Pole winner in 1951 is Duke Nalon in the famous white Purelube Novi, and Walt Faulkner, pole sitter the year before, sets a new qualifying record in 51 with a speed of 136.872 MPH!  Here are all the great drivers from 60 years ago.

Spectacular camera shots capture the Mauri Rose wreck, plus other spins and incidents!

As usual, enjoy.
