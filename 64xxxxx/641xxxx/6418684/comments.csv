As good as it is, 'Unforgiven' & 'No Country For Old Men' are still my favorite westerns. Modern westerns, that is. No one yet comes close to The Man With No Name's trilogy.

As always, @extremezone, you rock. Keep up the wonderful work.

,The_Test,2011-07-17T07:16Z,Received a letter from Paramount. They're watching this torrent just to give you guys a heads up. I've also received letters from HBO for Dexter and Deadwood.
[T],Arrrrrrrrrr,2011-07-18T03:33Z,"Dear Paramount studios,

I could not rent this movie because, due to the popularity of NetFlix, both Blockbuster stores in my area have closed. The one remaining rental outlet is a kiosk at a local grocery store, and it is so unprofitable that it has been down for almost a month and repeated calls to the company haven't changed this.

I don't even understand why NetFlix is so popular here (I'm not in the U.S.) as due to your and other studios' predatory licensing restrictions, only old and/or mediocre movies are available there. For example, there is not one Disney movie to be found. This movie is there only as a placeholder to tell that it is unavailable in my location, whereas in the U.S. I could access it.

So, how to watch it? Buy it for $15 and watch it once? I don't think so. If you were smart, you could have made some money off of it by allowing me to watch it on NetFlix. But, you seem to prefer getting nothing at all, and then complaining about it.

Sincerely,
Arrrrrrrrrr"
