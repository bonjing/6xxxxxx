,victor.brazil.qwerty,2011-05-24T21:07Z,This episode definitely exposes that the show is  likely to be over soon. The idea behind the plot for this last episode was good enogh but it could not be properly developed in a 40m episode. The result is an ok episode far from what fans expected for a season finale. Besides it starts with a great amount of suspense (like house could have kiled someone) and in the end it was just... ah nevermind
