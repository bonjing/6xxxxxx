best version out for sure"
,brimarosie,2011-05-25T19:22Z,thanks so much -this is the one they pay the popcorn for lol- at the beginning as they go through the arch in the daylight you see the film darken and that much better cos it stops all the blurriness that is on the other versions - all perfect in synch - THANK YOU
