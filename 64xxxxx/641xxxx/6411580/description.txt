Storyline:Former Army Ranger Cameron Poe is sentenced to a maximum-security federal penitentiary for using excessive force and killing a drunk man who had been attempting to assault his pregnant wife Tricia. Eight years later, Poe is paroled on good behavior, and eager to see his daughter Casey whom he has never met. Poe is arranged to be flown back home to Alabama on the C-123 "Jailbird" where he will be released on landing; several other prisoners, including his diabetic cellmate and friend Mike "Baby-O" O'Dell and the criminal mastermind Cyrus "The Virus" Grissom, are also being flown to be transferred to a new Supermax prison. DEA Agent Duncan Malloy wishes to bring aboard one of his Agents, Willie Sims, as a prisoner to coax more information out of drug lord Francisco Cindino before he is incarcerated. Vince Larkin, the U.S. Marshal overseeing the transfer, agrees to it, but is unaware that Malloy has armed Sims with a gun. Shortly after takeoff, a prisoner named "Pinball" Parker incites a riot spearheaded by Grissom that allows them to overpower the guards and pilots and take over the plane; Sims is killed when he attempts to stop Grissom. Grissom orders the plane to continue to Carson City for a scheduled prisoner transfer, where they will offload the guards and pilots disguised as prisoners, aided by the poor visibility from an ongoing dust-storm. Though he could have left the plane during the transfer, Poe feigns co-operation with Grissom but leaves a recording device from Sims' body on one of the guards being offloaded. Among the new prisoners boarding the plane are Cindino, who masterminded their escape, their new pilot Swamp Thing and serial killer Garland Greene, who even has the respect of Cyrus.
