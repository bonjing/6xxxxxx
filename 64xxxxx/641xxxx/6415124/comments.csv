You need a program called VLC its logo is a small orange traffic cone

For files that are 1080p or above you should use a program called splash lite player, vlc has problems with files 1080p or above

Both programs are free

Try VLC first and get used to it :)"

,sapful,2011-10-04T18:02Z,Episode 8 is missing.
,umirin,2012-04-23T06:55Z,"episode 8 isnt missing. The episode numbers are messed up a bit. Episode 7 is actually labled for epsodes 7 & 8, so each episode should be shifted down one. The real S09E18 is ""its a trap"" and is not included in this torrent"
