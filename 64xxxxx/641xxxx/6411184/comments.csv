,gfunkb7,2011-07-19T17:34Z,"Even when I try to open the keygen as admin, the keygen seems to have saved itself on the network and NOT in the installed directory. been working on this for the two hours. This sucks but can't get it the keygen to open."
[V],Slickinator,2011-07-23T14:50Z,if your antivirus already snagged it or quarrentined it u will see the keygen but can't use it ....just search your av for snagged keygen and ignore or allow again ........if you still have a problems install follow my guide and when you get too your id number  highlight and copy it and send to slickinator2006@yahoo.ca and ill gen it for u

[V],Slickinator,2011-08-22T13:43Z,the keygen gets snagged by lots of av's but its just because its a keygen theres no virus in it 
[V],Slickinator,2011-08-22T13:46Z,chilediez what the hell are you even talking about that is not even the keygen file your trying to say something about a file that has nothing to do with this program ...nice try buddy
,Struner,2011-09-08T23:03Z,"trying to activate, the program reports that the code is missing digets. With the addition of 2 digits at random on a trial basis, the code is apparently long enough, but is being reported as not valid.
Did Nitro change the protection?
Slickinator, do you have a solution?"
,sap404,2011-11-30T09:47Z,"thanks a ton :) activation id generator works fine... no virus threats whatsoever. . 
thanks again .. 

@struner : it worked fine for me .. so  theres probably some glitch up somewhere on your end ...."
