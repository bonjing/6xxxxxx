This does not seem to be available in any official DVD release.  This is from a Japanese VHS rip, but I am unsure where the subtitles came from (they are removable).  They are more than usable, but do have some typos and some minor mistranslations (Prime Minister for cabinet minister, and ice candy man for loan shark, to name a couple).  They do seem to have been made by someone with fair to fluent English skills, and maybe a little bit of laziness. The story comes off properly in any case.  As the image is pretty good for a file this size, improved subtitles would be nice, but I can't really do them myself.

It is 115 minutes long and 4:3 a/r, but IMDB gives no information to compare. I watched this originally over ten years ago, and as best as I can say, it seems complete.

An absurd story, with lots of gibberish philosophy (or naval gazing), and some cool cats (and a weasel fart). Lots of guys sitting around talking about how everybody else is crazy.

The late, great director Juzo Itami plays a major role, subordinate to Tatsuya Nakadai (of many Kurosawa films).
