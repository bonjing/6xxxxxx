,ThaYoda,2011-11-11T18:21Z,"ehm, I'm getting the same error with ""bethesda.logo.bik"" , I had a look around google and people said that their problem was fixed when they installed it in a different directory, however, I did that and it still didn't work and I had a look around the morrowind data files folder and there is no Video directory whatsoever when there should be one, really :/"
