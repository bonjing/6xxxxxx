Reseda Skatercross, The snake run at the Concrete Wave.  Mt Baldy, Revere, The Reserviors and spillways, Signal Hill.  The world as a playground.  Darwin would have explained it as the Dogtownian period, when man left the water and discovered the land.  If every kid in the world had a skate, war would be obsolete in 3 generations."
