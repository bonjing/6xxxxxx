Sorry. Internet went down for a few hours. is it finished now?  If yes, please seed it."
,LethalBeans,2011-08-28T20:31Z,"UPDATE - You can right click + copy the disc containing the ISO (after being mounted), and then paste it. Which means you don't have to rely on any discs or Daemon Tools. You can run it as an .exe ..Hope I helped :)"
,LethalBeans,2011-08-29T16:46Z,"actually, forget what I said. This one isn't an ISO like the last version. Thanks 'theLEAK' :) !!"
