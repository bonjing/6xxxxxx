Big Meat Hammer are the oldest punk rockers in Maine.The band has been going for the last 21 years.We play old school type punk rock with many influences from the past.We love Iggy,The Deadboys,60's Garage,70's - 80's punk and a ton more bands and music.Most of us are now in our 50's and still playing punk music.This is our second LP with some additional unreleased stuff.Also included are a bunch of images from the famed Fudafest Party.Each year there is a 3 day party in Maine called Fudafest and we have included our fave old Fudafest photo gallery.

It was Jordan who formed BMH back in 1989.He had played in a Punk Band from Boston which first formed in 1977 called The Transplants.Lenny played in one of Portland's First Punk Bands The Technicians.Skummy had played in Skull 69 and he started playing in bands back in the late 60's.A Punk Band needed to be formed up here that would keep the spirit of free speech alive in a sea of Conformity.Yes Portland is a small city but rest assured BMH does what it can to shake up the community and keep Punk alive.       Punks Not Dead !!!   We have done    Public TV Shows  with Bands playing.............. Underground Home Made Films and lots of Beer Parties.
