I am anonymous because I don't want to take credit for it. These guys made this               freeware, but you need Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion to play it. This is really amazing as they had professional voice actors and a recording studio, and made this game with a grand story with classic RPG game play mechanics. This game has nothing to do with the storyline of the Elder Scrolls or Oblivion.
