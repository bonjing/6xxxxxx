 Qualifying. Jake Humphrey presents coverage of qualifying for Formula 1's Spanish Grand Prix, the fifth race of 2011. Australian driver Mark Webber took pole at the Circuit de Catalunya in 2010, with Red Bull team-mate Sebastian Vettel just behind him, and McLaren's Lewis Hamilton third. Qualifying is especially important in Barcelona, with the last ten races won by the driver who started first on the grid. With commentary from Martin Brundle and David Coulthard.
