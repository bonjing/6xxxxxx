What is that even suppose to mean?  Also, Red Faction 2 was Gorilla, Red Faction 3 is Armageddon, and has yet to be released."

,pastor_of_muppets,2011-05-28T06:33Z,"Hey jj423 thanks alot for this upload. I'm a big fan of the series and this one kicks ass! The Physics are truly amazing. Been playing it every free minute I got since finishing the DL.

But how come you have an extracted version but not the ISO? Is this the retail copy or some kind of pre-retail version (i.e. not the finished product)? "
,jj423,2011-05-28T06:37Z,"im glad you like it!! i have only played it for a minute on a buddys jtag just to test it..i got it from a trusted source, but have been unable to get an iso copy as of yet.. i sure like to play the damn thing!! lol. if anyone comes across an iso version, plz share!"
,ade_n,2011-05-29T14:21Z,"what a piece of shit game. ruin mode sucks so bad. I was looking forward to an improvement of the interesting ""wrecking crew"" mode from last game. don't waste your time... "
