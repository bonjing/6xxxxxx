This is J. M. Barrie's classic novel, Peter Pan. Read to you by Jim Dale, winner of many Audie awards for the Harry Potter Series. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do. Jim Dale will ruin you for any other narrator. He is amazing. I love his work.

This has great quality audio. Ripped from CDs into iTunes. I formatted all the track names for stress free use and organization! 

I can't tell you how many audiobook torrents have "track1, track2, etc." and album/artist names that don't match....really people...really?

P.S. I realize I forgot to number the tracks so the easiest way to keep them in order is by putting the tracks in alphabetical order and change the "introduction" track to "Chapter 00" and it should work out fine Otherwise you can manually add the track #s if you would like.

Enjoy and Seed!!
