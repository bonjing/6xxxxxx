,blazivic,2011-05-24T18:05Z,"too bad last episode!

thanks for the upload!"
[V],joshua13,2011-05-24T22:15Z,"allmightykay, i dread to say it but since ratings are about commercial revenue and commercial revenue pays for tv, I hat would happen torrents included the commercials. Would tv networks then cheer us on and could the downloads for ratings. I'd still skip the commercials but that's no different than people do with dvrs. Just a wild thought."
,Kwanger,2011-05-25T01:36Z,Thanks for uploading all of these....shame its the last one.
,DarthExile,2011-05-31T14:21Z,they fucked up big time on this show and why is it still around. it could have been a great tv show if you drop the hole lost plane trash and just give us an assignation on the president would have been a great show instead its a huge blurrrr pile of shit with over dramatic acting that is painful to watch how did they fuck up on this show ??? hey lets not copy lost

,ericripper,2011-07-05T05:41Z,Why the hell is this the 13th most popular torrent right now at the time of my comment? This show aired a month and a half ago.
,pshark8b1,2011-07-05T17:34Z,"and now it is 4th,above falling skies and leverage,that is saying something,i don't think that tv networks have the slightest fucking clue what a good show is,i mean they cancel everything good,look at heroes,and v...need i say more,i thought flash forward was not bad,they don't even give shows a chance,the event and v ,and heroes ended off with serious cliff hangers,i mean WTF....they don't care that we have been following the shows for years,like heroes,boggest fucking mistake ever!!!!!!FUCK THE NETWORKS!!!!"
,pshark8b1,2011-07-05T17:35Z,biggest...can't type for shit when i am mad.....lol
,pshark8b1,2011-07-05T17:37Z,biggest.....i can't type for shit when i am mad...lol
,pshark8b1,2011-07-05T17:47Z,"WHAT HAPPEN TO MY FUCKING COMMENT!!!!!
IT SAYS 17 COMMENTS,A FEW ARE MISSING LIKE MINE???"
,pshark8b1,2011-07-05T17:50Z,"my bag computers are weird,they were not there now they are.....confussing?????"
,ericripper,2011-07-10T05:28Z,"pshark8b1, yeah, cancelling Flash Forward was really unforgivable. The Problem is that more people watch shit shows like American Idol, Think You Got Talent, Think You Can Dance, Dancing With Stars, and the rest of those pointless shows.  These piece of shit shows are destroying the market for shows that actually have a point or tell a story."
,Reviewer,2011-07-10T11:12Z,"some blogs on the interwebz say that the illuminati/mason are responsibly for this show, and were trying to give a heads up to upcoming ""events"". so that's why it was quickly canceled despite fan feed back."
,temujinthemeek,2011-08-03T00:59Z,"Yep, the show got canceled because it was too revealing. I cannot tell you any details but it is gonna get ugly down here."
,russvan,2011-09-14T02:20Z,thats kind of what i thought too. OVB
