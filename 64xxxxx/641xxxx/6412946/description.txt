What can you say about Judas Priestâ€™s BRITISH STEEL that hasnâ€™t already been said? It is truly a landmark Heavy Metal album that bridged the classic heavy Rock of the 1970s and moved it into the slick and powerful 1980s with itâ€™s pure metallic sound and commercial accessibility to FM airwaves. Look at all the classic songs that still get played on Classic Rock and current Rock radio: â€˜Metal Godsâ€™, â€˜Breaking The Lawâ€™, â€˜Living After Midnightâ€™, â€˜Unitedâ€™. Iâ€™m lucky here in Rhode Island because the local Rock station (94 WHJY) has one of the longest running Heavy Metal programs on Saturday nights called  â€œThe Metal Zoneâ€ and Iâ€™ve heard plenty of deeper tracks from BRITISH STEEL played over the years like â€˜Steelerâ€™ and â€˜Grinderâ€™. I grew up with this album, I think I got it in 1983 officially but I had a dubbed cassette, and itâ€™s been one of my favorite albums by Judas Priest and of the â€™80s.
Now BRITISH STEEL is 30 years oldâ€¦..thatâ€™s hard to believe! Thatâ€™s most of my life (Iâ€™m 38)! In order to celebrate such a milestone, Judas Priest toured last summer and played the entire album in order, then added a handful of Priest classics and rarities. I caught the show in Mansfield, MA on July 7th and it was a magnificent show, now itâ€™s great to have a commorative document to enjoy it again.
