,Sarkasmi,2011-06-13T00:10Z,"""Problem

The following message is received when first logging into the game: â€œProfile Creation Failed â€“ You must be signed into Live to create a new save for your profileâ€

Solution

Whenever you create a new profile in the game â€“ which will allow you to save your progress â€“ you must be logged into Windows Live. It is not possible to create a new profile in the game if using an offline profile. The first time you create a profile you will be asked for the Windows Live Key that comes with your game.""


So how are you guys doing it? 

I did make an offline (local) profile but it still says:

""Profile Creation Failed â€“ You must be signed into Live to create a new save for your profile""

Using the skidrow release with paul.dll etc. cracks and the game works fine, I just can't figure out how to save the profile without going online..."

,Kissen11,2012-01-06T13:40Z,"I hope anyone coul'd help me with an issue.
I've downloaded and tried a lot of different Dirt 3 uploads and there's no problem installing it and it to work.
The problem is that it freezes every 4-5 seconds. So I can't play.
I've tried all sorts of cracks and patches and it still don't work. Lower grafics and so on like someone mentioned. It can't be the computer cos I have an i7 2600K, GTX 580 and 8gb ram.
Any suggestions?
Thank's for the upload! "
