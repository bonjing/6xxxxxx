And here are the latest Largo Winch, Largo Winch 07 - Golden Gate (and yes, i know that Largo Winch 6 is not out yet, waiting on the decencored pages).


Simon, Largos friend, has been cast as the lead in a new TV series, Golden Gate. Its produced in part by one of Group Ws subsidiaries. When the investigator sent by Dwight Cochrane to examine irregularities in the funding of the series disappears, Largo takes matters into his own hands and heads to the city by the Bay. But what will he find? An innocuous example of bad television? A case of tax evasion? Or worse?
