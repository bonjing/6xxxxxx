,Avi1231,2011-05-31T11:16Z,"I'm confused. I check my basic Sanctum install last night and I could run it just fine. Downloaded this while I slept and installed just now and now it crashes with the little splash image up before it can run. Anyone else experience this?

I did copy over the cracked content. Don't know what I coulda done."
,MoneyMikeAZ,2011-06-01T07:32Z,"I have downloaded the original skidrow release, updates 1,2 and 3 (this one). Installed and copied the contents from the crack folders to the install directory ( C: - Program Files (x86) - Sanctum - Binaries - Win32 ), I am using Windows 7. The game playes fine on all 4 levels..( the three original levels and the new one included in this release) My issue is, I am not able to host or see any multiplayer games... anyone else have this issue or know how to solve it??? thanks.."
