So i went over to see my odd Russian friend Mikhail one day. It was fall and quite warm, and he was wearing this goofy looking touque, so I asked him, "what's up with the touque man?"

It turns out it wasn't just ANY touque, but rather a touque that he had used to fashion himself a Tinfoil Hat.

Seeing as I carry my video camera around with me, specifically for moments like this...i decided to whip it out and interview him!

As such, in the following interview Mikhail explains the "Benefits of Wearing a Tinfoil Hat".

This isn't an act, he's 100% serious.

Unfortunately I missed the day he fashioned a glider out of broomsticks and plastic cling wrap and was attempting to fly it; as well as the day he extracted something from cough syrup and ended up crawling around on the floor near comatose....but surely more Mikhail moments will be caught on film in the future.

In the meantime, enjoy this interview....

PLEASE SEED AND ENJOY!!!
