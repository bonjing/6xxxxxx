,omfghoax,2011-09-04T20:32Z,"After disabling my antivirus it would continue past the EULA stuff - but once it ""starts"" installing there's an error and it aborts the installation. Anyone else got this?"
,dartb,2011-10-03T17:04Z,"No, this is not a virus or a trojan or a worm or a mystical unicorn pissing rainbows - it's a game.  The false positive (which I admit raised my eyebrows too) comes from the injection method built into the installer.  As you run it, it generates a key and directly injects it into the installer, along with the NOCD crack and the like, for ease of use and for your convenience - don't worry about it and disable your AV for a few minutes.

@omfghoax: That happened to me before I disabled Nod32 but after that it was fine.  Maybe you had a bad download?"
