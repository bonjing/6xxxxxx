For everybody else, Mac OS X Lion DP3 is offered in Apple's Developer Accounts since May 16th."

,iMZDL,2011-05-26T00:51Z,The least you could do is credit me because i know you get them from my website. 
[T],User_01,2011-05-26T01:44Z,"Credit goes to iMZDL for having a site!

Now shut down your site and see if i still can get them (whatever that might mean).

For people who want Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Developer Preview 3, it's a new torrent here
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6423167/Mac_OS_X_10.7_Lion_Developer_Preview_3_
This version is outdated."
,iMZDL,2011-05-26T03:25Z,"I'm sorry if i offended you, i didn't mean to... If you get it from my site (which looks like you are) then i would like just a credit that i was the original provider, is that to much to ask for?
If you do not get it from my website then i am sorry."
,lectrick,2011-05-26T22:37Z,"Just FYI- this image works, but it does not seem to include the Windows part of the disc that allows you to use the Windows version of Migration Assistant to  move Windows files and settings over to a new Lion Mac."
