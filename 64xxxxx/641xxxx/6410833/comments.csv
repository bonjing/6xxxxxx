Keep it up, and you be getting better and better quality rips. Not quite there yet as 3Li's top noch quality for example. Dont get me wrong, urs are good, just not as good as theirs yet, but much better then other random peoples attempts, absolutely! 
You just need the contrast I believe, to be a bit better, you need sharper picture, sharper edges, so you do not get this a bit blurry edges of houses for example. And also it get this ""grainy"" looking picture, specially backgrounds (know when they are out of focus it is another mater, but this I talk about need to get a bit sharper to be as great as the rest of the big name rippers!).

There you go, some constuctive critisism, NOT AT ALL TO BE RUDE, ONLY TO HELP IMPROVE!! =) 
hiest if its your rip, or if your are able to pass it on to the ripper (Feel Free, or ""Pitic"" ?) please do so!

Thankx anyways!"
