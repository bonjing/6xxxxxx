Enjoy!"
[V],IndexTrance,2011-05-22T21:23Z,Thanks for the subtitle link!
,Darkfall666,2011-05-23T09:20Z,"Is anyone else getting a load of audio clipping on louder parts of the movie? I'm finding the audio is fairly poor overall, but in fight scenes, it's just constant distortion, and some of it is out of sync in those fight scenes.

I've not had this problem with HDScene releases in the past, but this one has issues for me."
,Darkfall666,2011-05-23T09:25Z,Ahh. I should pay more attention - this is an R5. That explains the audio issues. I'll wait for a real BluRay version before watching this one further. The audio on the R5 is too annoying to enjoy for me. :)

thanks"
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-05-24T08:39Z,"Yes, the audio is horrible.  Picture not too bad for the file size though.

But the audio is bad enough to detract from the enjoyment of the movie.

,jojo92,2011-06-06T21:18Z,is it by camera?
,est1987,2011-06-13T06:32Z,It would be nice if you could also add English subtitles to your torrents. Just saying.
,Saintrocky,2011-06-13T11:23Z,Whats the difference between AAC and AC3 audio ?
,ZombiePanda,2011-06-28T02:05Z,"Great up until the point where the audio went out of sync, the audio is pretty fair up until battle scenes where it messes up completely.

,5amjr,2011-10-29T23:44Z,"Make up your mind is it a bluray rip or an r5? Can't be both and by the 'sound' of the audio problems from DL'ers it's the latter!
No thanks."
