The entirety of the Australian TV series "Snobs", in English. These are collected from various sources around the internet - p2p and direct download - and I figured I'd upload them to make life easier for other fans of the show.

File size is large for a 20 minute episode, but I didn't encode them. They're TV rips, and decent enough quality. I considered including a sample, but tbh, these are the only known copies in English on the internet, so if you want the series, the quality will have to do. :)

I'm in Europe, so bear in mind my PC waon't be on some night between 11pm and 8 am GMT. If there's no seeds, just comment here and I'll seed again.

And help seed, ne? :)

Oh. And they're known to work on the PS3, through the PS3 Media Server application. :D
