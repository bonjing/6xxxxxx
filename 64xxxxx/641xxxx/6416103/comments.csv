Rogers messes around with the torrent protocol (even if you use encryption... they assume all encrypted traffic is BitTorrent.) They also block some things completely such as IRC DCC protocol in some areas.

I voted with my wallet, dumped Rogers and went with TekSavvy, which offers cable service cheaper and no messing around. Never looked back."
