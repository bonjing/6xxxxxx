Created using RPG Maker 2000 and too damn much time on his hands, Director Joseph Greene... creates... something just strange, disjointed... and fail. Just fail. Thus the name.

Completely vulgar, totally racist, crude, full of plot holes... what can you expect from filmmakers during their downtime.

It's fail... but strangely it works.

I have another "Season" I'm going to upload pretty soon as well.
