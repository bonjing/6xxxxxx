It's easy to install, and also easy to de-install. Much easier than Norton products with their hundred of files it is. Norton is crap, Sophos is ok for me."
,woododoll2,2011-05-24T17:26Z,I would not recommend anyone to d/l an anti-virus program from a torrent-site. Go directly to the Sophos home page and d/l from there.

I dont recommend this app on/from torrent sites. I recommend the program itself."
