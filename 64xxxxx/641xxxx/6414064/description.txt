    While Eva Magnus and her daughter, Jenny, are taking a walk, they        
    discover a dead body floating along the riverside. Eva runs to the       
    nearest phone booth and pretends to call the police. Then she leaves     
    the body for someone else to find. Why? Konrad Sejer, the police         
    officer investigating the case, links it to another unsolved murder      
    of a woman killed in her bed. A woman that used to be a childhood        
    friend of Eva Magnus...
