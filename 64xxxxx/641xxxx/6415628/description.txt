BBC Mountain with Griff Rhys Jones 5of5 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2007

Griff Rhys Jones explores the great mountain ranges of Britain, from Scotland southwards to the Pennines and Wales.

Part 5. Wales.
Griff Rhys Jones' journey around the mountains of Britain brings him to Snowdonia in Wales. Tales of dragons, giants and King Arthur feature in the mountains' history, but with millions of visitors every year and a railway now taking visitors to the summit, it's clear that modern life has made its mark. Yet the mountains continue to protect a fragile ecology, and Griff meets some of the people who respect this natural balance, including climbers and eco-friendly entrepreneurs.
