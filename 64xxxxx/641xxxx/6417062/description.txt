Here is the mixtape that I have been working on throughout the year entitled â€œThe Diary Of A Pissed Off Rapperâ€. I modeled it after one of my favorite Emcee's projects "Charles Hamilton â€“ Every Charles Hamilton's Ex-Girlfriendâ€™s Worst Nightmare Mixtape" with my own little twist. "The Diary" refers to a place where you keep your inner most secrets and feelings (my brain in this case), and the "Pissed Off Rapper" refers to the anger and hurt that has been locked up inside the diary for years that is finally rising to the surface. This tape explains what happened and how I felt about certain females and our different situations. It was created for all of the good men in the world that are always outshined by the â€œAssholesâ€ and taken advantage of by females who obviously cannot make up their minds, nor know what it is they want when it comes to a partner.  Hopefully, women will learn that all men are in the â€œassholeâ€ category that they tend to group us in; the â€œN***** ainâ€™t s*** categoryâ€. Some of us actually are good dudes that want nothing more than to give you the world, and treat like a queen on a pedestal. So please remember women, that maybe itâ€™s the guys that you f*** with â€œthat ainâ€™t s***â€ and not everything that has a penis. Anyhow, thank you for downloading and listen to it. I really appreciate it. It is probably the BEST WORK I have ever done as a solo artist, and it is ABSOLUTELY FREE. I produced 11/15 beats and 3 by Raw-T and 1 by Reek Nas. Each track is a sample from the collection of Final Fantasy video games. Enjoy! 
Thank you for the support, I appreciate each and every one of you. You are the reason that I keep doing this. Be on the lookout for my next two projects, â€œThe Hopeless Romantic Pt. 1â€ & The Hopeless Romantic Pt. 2â€.
