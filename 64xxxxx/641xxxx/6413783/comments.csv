,leldorleen,2011-05-24T20:34Z,"Thanks a lot, you saved me a lot of time for another playthrough of Mass Effect 1. This DLC helps you explore the options, influenced by your decisions in ME1. Whether the Citadel Counsil survives or not, who is the human representative, whether Wrex lives or not (which, I believe, will have a tremendous effect in the Tuchanka missions and ME3). 15 minutes spent in reminiscenence are quite worth another 24 hours replaying ME1."
,chaostotem,2011-05-25T05:49Z,Thnx a ton man been looking for this :)
,Tyverius24,2011-05-27T06:12Z,I take it the crack is included in this? if so great cant wait to replay ME2 again just to have the changes i wanted :)
,m.rafay31,2011-05-27T21:28Z,Genesis is NOT as good as ME1. its a poor poor alternative to the game that actually has a stronger storyline than the second by several times.
,kopo007,2011-05-29T15:15Z,I'm glade I could help:) crack is also included..
,karakoncula,2011-06-03T18:30Z,trojan in DLC. can be detected throught instalation
,keximexi,2011-06-05T20:15Z,how can I uninstall it?
,shipz2640,2011-06-12T17:28Z,"Thanks a ton for this! I played the original Mass Effect on Xbox 360, and I play Mass Effect 2 on my PC so I don't have access to my save files from the original Mass Effect. This allows me to play through Mass Effect 2 with choices from the original Mass Effect without having to play through the game on my PC, which I *really* don't want to do because I thought the original Mass Effect was more annoying than fun. Plus I've already play through it (or at least most of it), at least 2-3 times already.

BTW guys, if you don't like the comic don't fret. The point of this is to allow you to play Mass Effect 2 while carrying over decisions and choices from Mass Effect 1 for those of you who don't have a save file on your computer, like myself."
,GeneralTso92,2011-08-20T02:30Z,"Actually, by what i've played so far, Mass Effect 2 will probably be better.

Alot of things sucked in Mass Effect 1, hopefully 2 fixes them."
,Rex290,2012-02-21T03:49Z,Boring or not it lets you avoid mucking around with editors. Thanks for the upload Kopo!
,volksbank,2012-03-08T15:52Z,"congrats deuchbag, this is the first time the torrent client warns me about a virus in the downloaded files!"
,abses,2012-05-04T16:41Z,"thank you so much... saved me the trouble of playing ME 1 again for the 3rd time,scanned (no viruses :]).bye"
,codexius2,2012-05-29T00:12Z,"I installed it, unlocked it, but after the space scene it never happened? How do I see genesis?"
,codexius2,2012-05-29T02:08Z,"Ok my issue is that this won't authorize! I am trying to use this as well as a DLC pack and when I turn on the game it says it couldnt authorize the DLCs and that is hwy it isnt showing up!

Why wont it authorize?

Thanks"

Yeah.. kinda bad not to include readme (sry kopo007 but its true, still thx for good torrent :)
BUT, to install you:
1) run ME2_Genesis.exe - installs genesis
2) Replace MassEffect2.exe (in ...me2 folder/binaries) - otherwise it will complain about wrong disc or whatever
3) run giveme2entitlements - otherwise it will complain about authorize of DLC once game is started

CHEERS! :D"
