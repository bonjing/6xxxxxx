I searched for this DLC for a while now but couldn't find one in here, so I created one. This may not be very useful for PC, since we have save editor but well another 15mins of comic couldn't possibly hurt. 
Oh..! I'm not the original uploader of this dlc, I just found it somewhere and upload it here:) Thx the original uploader and happy gaming:

The scene trigger after Sepherd got spaced and lets you pick the choices about the events that happen in ME1:)
