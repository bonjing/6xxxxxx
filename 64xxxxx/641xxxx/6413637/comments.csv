,FaerieGrl,2011-05-29T09:55Z,"Thanks for this awesome complete pack!  If it's not too much trouble , can you tell me what I'm doing wrong with the keygens?  I install the program don't let it connect to the net , disconnect the internet and when I'm on the activation screen I open the keygen, but I still windup up short 5 characters to have a complete activation number. This has happened with every autodesk product I've gotten here so far. Any help would be appreciated. "

,mnessim03,2011-05-31T01:10Z,"dear FaerieGrl,
i have win7 x64 , when used the keygen, press the mem-patch button then generate activation number, then copy and past.
there is no problem that that the number is short , just press activate, and start use your app.
have fun."
