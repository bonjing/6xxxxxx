Beach Road - James Patterson-viny

The life of Montauk lawyer Tom Dunleavy bears no resemblance to those of his TV counterparts. Day after day, he scrapes by with routine real estate closings; nothing more exciting ever comes his way. Then one day, out of the blue, he is hired to defend a local hero accused of a triple homicide. Almost immediately, this honest advocate realizes that his hapless client is only a fall guy, but proving it involves dangerous liaisons with people privy to sordid secrets of the Hamptons rich. To solve the case, Dunleavy reconnects with former girlfriend and hotshot attorney Kate Costello. James Patterson in full flight.
