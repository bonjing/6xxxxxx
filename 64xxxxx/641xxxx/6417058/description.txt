Quote:
The Call of Duty was a series of short-lived Marvel Comics series featuring firefighters and emergency service workers dealing with paranormal phenomena in the Marvel Universe.

It was conceived in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and consists of three limited series (Call of Duty: The Brotherhood #1-6, by Chuck Austen and David Finch; Call of Duty: The Precinct #1-5, by Bruce Jones and Tom Mandrake; Call of Duty: The Wagon #1-4 by Chuck Austen and Danijel Zezelj) and a short unsuccessful run as an ongoing series in 2002-2003, that lasted four issues (by Chuck Austen and Pat Olliffe).
