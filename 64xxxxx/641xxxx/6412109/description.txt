                           The Complete Season 6


Gamble (creator) said the sixth season of the show focuses on the brothers' relationship. The season steers toward the format of the early seasons with "lots of meat-and-potatoes closed-ended episodes, and...a season-long story arc to weave in". According to a press release by the CW, Heaven and Hell are now in "complete disarray", forcing Sam and Dean to reunite to "beat back the rising tide of creatures and demon-spawn" that "roam across a lawless and chaotic landscape".
