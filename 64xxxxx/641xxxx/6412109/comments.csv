[V],manOtor,2011-07-15T22:27Z,"@ Fr3ak101:

If you're asking whether there'll be a seventh season, then the answer is yes!
Supernatural will be back in Fall 2011."
,saxonprice,2011-07-16T03:00Z,"Thanks for the quality file. It's been well executed all the way around, and, as I do when I come across good content like this, I will seed for at least 48 hours. Keep it up!"
,livluvlaf,2011-07-24T19:23Z,Thanks...great download...will seed for at least a week
,ncc46537,2011-08-22T22:07Z,"Seeding is perfect, even though TPB says there are more leechers than seeders.Maxing out my connection on download speed, which isn't saying much considering my speed is 300 kbps, but it's still nice to max it out, as some downloads don't max out.

Video:10/10, perfect for the type of upload, once again.

Audio: 8/10, echoes a little, and sounds slightly muffled, but is perfectly fine, have seen much worse.

,eyyaz,2011-08-28T19:58Z,"Thanks for this, been seeding for 2 days now."
,Maelificent,2011-09-09T18:22Z,"Looking good! I'll be seeding as much as I can. 

How about more seeders so it doesn't take everyone 10+ hours.... (Okay, so I exaggerate, but still.)"
,Shydogg82,2011-09-10T10:50Z,Season 7 doesn't start until Sept 17th or so...Thanks for the collaboration.  Supernatural is by far one of the best shows out there right now and the best thing the CW has going for him.
,MrPhooey,2011-09-19T03:47Z,"Just started to download the season. Thank you so much for the upload. You are a savior, sir. Seeding"
,MrPhooey,2011-09-19T03:49Z,"Sorry for the double post, but I forgot to add that season 7 will be airing on Friday, September 23."

,footswtch,2011-10-31T18:08Z,"I thank the uploader and KABLAM!!!;

,Hysterics,2012-05-08T10:29Z,"Am I the only one who has issues with this torrent? When I go to load the files it says the AVIs are not compiled properly and asks if I want to fix them. When I go to fix them it just pauses and never continues. I'm not new to this, I've never had this happen, also the quality of the files seems very poor. I had the first five seasons in smaller files that looked nicer..."
