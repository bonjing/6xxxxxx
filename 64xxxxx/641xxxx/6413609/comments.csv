,Iamst00pid,2011-05-24T15:01Z,"Can anyone help me out?

I followed the steps described here exactly, but the Addon isnt showing in my Addons screen, nor is it loading.

Does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks"

always happy to see this uploaded and updated thanks"
,b1hb0y,2011-05-25T00:53Z,"@Iamst00pid Your name says it all, but il help you, simple add the folder to World Of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns and once you log in when you are on the char screen the addons tab should show up in left hand corner! If there is no AddOns folder in interface make one and add the zygor folder in there.

Thanks for the update :)"
