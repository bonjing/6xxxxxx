,aradiel,2011-05-24T08:19Z,Completely uninformative IMDb link. Screens suggest some kind of serial killer thing?
,Joe-the-Tug,2011-05-24T08:51Z,"""aradiel"" You could always try goggle instead of waiting for someone to do it for you."
,aradiel,2011-05-24T10:48Z,"You can't Google what isn't there. If IMDb doesn't have anything on this stinker of a movie, then nothing else does either. Maybe YOU should try Google before wasting other people's time telling them to.

Anyway, the rip is fine, as you'd expect. Both A/V are solid. The movie is a werewolves vs. vampires deal, just really poorly done. I didn't bother watching the whole thing, but someone might enjoy it."
