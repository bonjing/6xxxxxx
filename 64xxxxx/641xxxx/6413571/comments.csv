,stationmiek,2011-07-27T00:06Z,"Click on MEMPATCH on the keygen when you have the register screen up, then put the authorisation code in. It won't accept it otherwise.

This is much easier to use than ZBrush, it doesn't produce the same results, but it's good enough."
,jboggle,2012-01-21T18:23Z,Could anyone tell me whether this is 32-bit or 64-bit? Thanks!
,deniss93,2012-01-27T20:17Z,Read the titel and you will know if its 32 och 64bit! -.-
,project94,2012-02-16T17:22Z,"hey what song is that on the keygen, it's familiar but i cant remember where i've heard it from.

,Chozley,2012-02-23T11:49Z,"Hey there guys! This was working really well for me, but when I tried to use ""Mem Patch"" it said that it couldn't get ""debug priviledge"" and asked me if I were admin, and I most certainly am, is this a known issue? Is there anything I can do?"
,legolooney,2012-04-27T04:06Z,"Awesome torrent, all worked fine for me...now I cant stop sculpting!! :)"

The only weird thing I can find is when I play the training videos on the welcome screen, it sounds like 5 women are talking at the same time in different languages. This happened when I downloaded Maya 2012 also. Maybe it's just a weird glitch on my computer, I don't know. But it's no big deal. Nothing you can't find on Youtube!"
