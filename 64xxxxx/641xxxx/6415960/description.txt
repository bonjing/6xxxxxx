Jack and Jill - James Patterson-viny

Someone has killed one of the most powerful men in the U.S. Senate - and the whole world is watching. Someone has murdered a small black girl on the mean streets of Washington - and no one seems to care. But only D.C. homicide cop Alex Cross suspects that the evil striking down both the high and the lowly wears the same shocking face. From James Patterson, the sensational author of the bestsellers Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, comes Jack & Jill, the #1 thriller that breaks all the rules - and shatters every nerve.
