Screw you, why did you post those serials? Now they're definitely getting blacklisted by Quark."
,autor13,2011-06-09T09:46Z,"@ Aradalf

FU very much! If (and that's a big IF) serials get blacklisted, than use keygen. Plenty of serials in it. And now, go in to your closet and blacklist yourself."

People there is no virus in keygen, just disable your anti virus software. Install, activate then move the crack off your comp. Do a full scan, Result will be NO trojan OR Rootkits."
,zarzavat,2011-07-06T19:38Z,is no virus in keygen is a false positive from your antivirus..i leech this from a respectable source
