         The Battle of the Little Big Horn is one of the most          
         iconic events in American history. It is an amazing story,    
         but until now it has never been fully told. Many questions    
         still remain but one question remains above all the others,   
         did any of Custer's soldiers survive? New evidence will       
         prove that a soldier named August Finkle was the lone         
         survivor of "Custer's Last Stand," a battle that is           
         practically synonymous with "no survivors." Forensics         
         on the man's skeleton and his two gunshot wounds will         
         definitely show that the story he reluctantly told the        
         world nearly 50 years after the battle was true. He alone     
         survived, and his tale of what actually went on in the        
         battle will revise our interpretation of the events of        
         the day. This special will also reveal the amazing story      
         of seven others who very nearly survived--who rode for        
         miles away from the carnage only to succumb to their own      
          fear and turn their weapons on themselves.
