CM8 Doing It Right The First Time

Sources:

Video: New High Quality German 720P TS PFD thx


Audio: Imagines Line thx

Encode:

the german ts was very good, no shaking,no flickering, nothing cropped and full movie.
The scenes at daylight were very good didnt touch them much, there are some darker scenes
which i brightened up a bit, looks very good now, could almost pass as a screener.
I synced the line nearly lipsync, was a lot of work all together around 10h work at least.
will do till the retail comes around.
watch samples!!
