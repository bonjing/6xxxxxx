,mojopriest75,2011-08-08T14:22Z,dont bother to download this file as its in mkv format which is of no use to me but thanks anyway
,partykid,2011-08-11T07:07Z,"i cant believe how many of you people complain about mkv. it is far superior to xvid, has been since the time of its creation. "
,frilel,2011-08-13T20:24Z,"Because many dvd players doesn't support .mkv? Mine doesn't anyway, it's really annoying."
,southak,2011-09-01T16:29Z,DVD not support MKV? Then get yourself a media player. They have near-universal support. I don't understand anyone who downloads torrents of TV shows and doesn't have one.
