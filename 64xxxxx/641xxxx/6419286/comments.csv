,M0SHP1T,2011-05-24T22:35Z,"@838974039  rammstien is fine on this comp alot of bands can be called nu-metal among tons of other things. 

@DeepHole You got my hopes up man I was hoping this was volume 2. But I see its just a corrected verison. Nice song choice btw.  Looking forward to volume 2 and 3. :-)"
