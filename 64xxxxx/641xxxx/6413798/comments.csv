Sorry for bumping, just activated office 2010 pro plus vlk permanent: this way: thank you youtube

PERMANENTLY ACTIVATE OFFICE 2010 PRO +.
The notes are based on using Word, but any other Office 2010 
application can be used (phone activation takes less than 2 minutes).

01. Disconnect internet, and start Word.

02. If the activation window appears close it.

03. Go to menu File, Help, Change Product Code, and then enter key:

828CH-G4FPY-HMH4R-32GCK-6D9BH
-or-
3W3MQ-H7M6X-3WYP7-TPCH6-8G8T2

04. Untick the ""Activate over internet"" box at the bottom, and click ""Next"".

05. In the window that appears click ""Install"".

06. When finished the Install process, close word an then reopen Word.

07. An activation window will appear (if not, go to menu File, Help, Activate).

08. Select the ""Phone Activation"" option, and click ""Next"".

09. Pick your country, then ring the number and follow the instructions.

10. When asked for your ID, input the code given in the Word activation window. 

11. When asked which edition, choose business/volume use, used only on 1 pc.

12. A code will be given back, and enter the code into the activation box.

13. Click ""Next"", and Office will say that it's permanently activated.

14. Close Word (and any other Office 2010 application).

15. Restart Word, and go to Help to check the subscription status.

Note: 
- If you don't get the automated system when calling then phone back in the evening or Sunday.
- If you are put trough to an operator then just lie and they give you the code.
- If you had used a kms activator previously for 180 day activation then just use the same activator 
to uninstall the kms process and any scheduled reactivation., you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to deactivate Office.

Just give someone else a oppurunity to fully activate without using a activator. By the way; great upload!

Tried both key different calls (days) key don't work."
,tops.c,2011-05-31T13:49Z,"Called again last night all she ask me is this only going on one machine, I gave the 2nd key and told her I got this off creaigslist, sweet. Microsoft wants users to have this new product it's a promo I mean who would pay 200 bucks it's not much better than office 2007. "
,mahapash,2011-06-02T18:07Z,"@ grizzmo.. Thanks buddy,,,, dat worked out for me..."
,mahapash,2011-06-02T18:10Z,Guys pls use the keys provided by grizzmo to activate offline.. its working..
,kteddycharms,2011-06-06T22:30Z,not working for me @grizzmo says the keys are not valid 
,SpiffyMasta,2011-06-07T06:17Z,"@grizzmo: Thnx for the guide. I used the second key and called at about 9pm PST got the automated system, everything cleared.

If it doesn't work for you you are too stupid to type in the correct numbers or letters. Stop whining."
,gamerbeatsgamers,2011-06-19T03:50Z,"Sorry, after I gave my ID, the system said it's invalid. what can I do?"
,FelipeXmc,2011-07-29T16:50Z,This is fucking bullshit! The bitch on the phone doesnt give u no code! Fuck this!
,TornLoader,2011-10-16T17:53Z,It works for me. I was talking to a very nice lady on the phone. She just asked me where I got the key and I said I got it from my father and she then gave me the activation code. 
,TornLoader,2011-10-16T17:55Z,The robot on the phone will not give you the code. In my case I decided to continue to talk to the real customer representative who gave me the code.
