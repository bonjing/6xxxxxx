I was going to seed longer but at that time I was working on several projects at once. I only had time to seed the 32-bit version of Windows 8."

,TheAeroHacker,2011-06-27T00:17Z,"@Cain71546 Thanks for backin me up


As for the rest of the people downloading this, it IS NOT WINDOWS SERVER, if you have this installed click on the start button, run ""winver"" and it will show you that it really is Windows 8 Build 7959."
,TorrentzKing,2011-06-27T17:44Z,"Hello, I have two questions before my download finishes:

1. Does this have the new metro UI included ?

2. Do I need to activate this at all ?

Thanks, torrentzking."
,TheAeroHacker,2011-07-06T00:53Z,"@TorrentzKing:

This does not have the metro interface. The metro interface MIGHT come included with Windows 8 Milestone 4, but there is currently no official Milestone 4"
,TheAeroHacker,2011-07-06T00:57Z,"Sorry, I Had The Activation Codes For This, But I Can't Find The File With The Codes On It. I'll Post Them Up If I Find Them For Now: Google Is Your Friend :)"
