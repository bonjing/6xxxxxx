Lost Hero, The - Rick Riordan-viny

Jason has a problem. He doesnâ€™t remember anything before waking up in a bus full of kids on a field trip. Apparently he has a girlfriend named Piper and a best friend named Leo. Theyâ€™re all students at a boarding school for â€œbad kids.â€ What did Jason do to end up here? And where is here, exactly?
Piper has a secret. Her father has been missing for three days, ever since she had that terrifying nightmare. Piper doesnâ€™t understand her dream, or why her boyfriend suddenly doesnâ€™t recognize her. When a freak storm hits, unleashing strange creatures and whisking her, Jason, and Leo away to someplace called Camp Half-Blood, she has a feeling sheâ€™s going to find out.
Leo has a way with tools. When he sees his cabin at Camp Half-Blood, filled with power tools and machine parts, he feels right at home. But thereâ€™s weird stuff, tooâ€”like the curse everyone keeps talking about. Weirdest of all, his bunkmates insist that each of themâ€”including Leoâ€”is related to a god.
