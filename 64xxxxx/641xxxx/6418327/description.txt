NEIL YOUNG ARCHIVES VOLUME 1
Label:Reprise
Released:2010
Format: Flac



Archives Vol. 1 suggests that this is only the first multi-disc bonanza, in a series of maybe four or five. It spans (merely!) his early days in Canada, circa 1963, with his Shadows-aping garage band the Squires, through to 1972â€™s epochal Harvest. The CD version gathers 114 tracks on eight discs, of which 40-odd are previously released.. 
Young compiled and remastered the whole lot himself. Air any disc from Archives Vol. 1 and you will hear his very best songs from that given era. Starting with Youngâ€™s compositions for the late-Sixties combo Buffalo Springfield, we follow the crystallisation of the music, which soundtracked US hippiedomâ€™s withdrawal from Americaâ€™s cities into its vast open spaces: his spinetingling falsetto tenor; his loose, speculative guitar playing (witness labyrinthine takes on Words, Down By the River, etc); his effortless song craft, the words both vernacular and poetic, sometimes politically angry (Ohio, cut with Crosby, Stills & Nash), sometimes tear jerkingly romantic (Only Love Can Break Your Heart, live, with peerless harmonies again from C, S&N). Of three live discs, two are solo, with hilariously rambling between-song monologues; the third is a rip-roaring set with Crazy Horse in tow. 
Consistently electrifying, overloaded with fabulous melodies and lazily brilliant playing, this is the full story of one of rockâ€™s true greats â€” or at least, the complete early chapters. Vol. 2, covering the rest of the Seventies, could be even better.
