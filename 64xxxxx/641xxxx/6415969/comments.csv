,Dude014,2011-10-04T20:57Z,Yeah Sorry to complain. Thanx. Shur beats buying em.
,pspete,2012-01-15T07:46Z,HAD TO COMMENT - you DO NOT have to get ALL the minis - simply select the games that you WANT from this torrent and don't download the others... That's the best thing about torrents - you can choice what files you actually want :)
,DarkDezzick,2012-04-02T03:48Z,"Erm, pretty sure that you need to download them all to even get the .rar to extract... so that makes you fuckin' wrong mate."
,DarkDezzick,2012-04-02T07:35Z,"My normal .rar extractor couldn't extract this so I used 7zip. When I tried to c/p this to my psp nothing happened. I was unable to interact with any of the files. I tried to delete the folder a few times with no luck. Turned out the path name was too long... The mario thing was about 100 folders down and every folder had a retardely long name. I am running xp sp3 btw, don't know if any other os has this problem."
