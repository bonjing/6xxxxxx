This is a song written about the Vancouver Canucks by Canadian hip-hop artist Kyprios. It's pretty much a playoff anthem. Great song. Canucks will win the cup this year.

In terms of format and quality:

Format: .mp3
Bitrate: 256 kbps

So it's good quality. Can't tell you much more about it, I'm no music geek. I'll seed until we get a decent amount of seeders. Happy downloading!
