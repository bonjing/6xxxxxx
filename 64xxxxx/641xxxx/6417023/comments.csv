,kelv1969,2011-09-22T13:18Z,on tv.com these episodes are classed as season 7. 
,str8b0r3d,2011-10-24T22:20Z,not season 6.... this is season 7
,BSuga,2011-10-27T23:11Z,in the us it's classed as season 7 but uk its season 6 !
,Nemo_Russia,2011-11-01T14:58Z,"If it's different season numbers in different countries (which i highly doubt it is, since that's just plain stupid) why dont the people compiling this and uploading write next to the torrent name ""US"" or ""UK"". I believe that IMDB is the most competent web site in the world for anything broadcasting on TV anywhere, so if it says there this is Season 7, then this is freakin Season 7 and not anything else in the UK, in India, in Australia and bla bla...."
,Sprout,2011-12-23T18:59Z,"since Fox owns the rights to family guy, id say they are the official word, not imdb(especially since imdb is editable just like wikipedia, so anyone can alter the info even if they dont know anything aboout the subject). Fox says they are on season8 right now, the torrents here at pb, have combined season1 and season2 so this one is labeled 6. this is actually season7. This was the last season aired, and fox is showing that the season right now is the 8th season. Logical conclusion...... season7. Unless Fox decided to skip a season(Fox owns the rights to american dad(seth mcfarlane is just the creater and executive producer))."
,arielmercoledi,2012-01-19T08:03Z,"( the torrent has a ""i stole it"" tracker - make sure to remove the tracker after you add the torrent )"
,dubwank,2012-05-29T15:50Z,"this is season 6, you guys are just fucking retarded. thanks uploader. "
