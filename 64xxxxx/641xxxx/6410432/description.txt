The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

Part Four

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this. Here we go again, but bigger.

    Ok, four parts in a week is really fast, but It'll slow down. I still have research and hunting to do for some of the next few.

This Fourth installment is: Adventures (of/in)

Here's 15 sample covers you can look at.

One of the fun things about doing this series is the odd mixture of titles you get.

       We've got comics from 1949-2006. We have Superman, Batman, The Animated DCU, Bob Hope, Jerry Lewis (with guest shots from Batman and Wonder Woman) and Rex the Wonder Dog among others. Even of all people, Ford Fairlane. (Clearly a Hitchhiker wannabe)
	
       A few people out there have told me they like the crazy descriptions I sometime write. I'm bipolar which has it's ups and downs. Unfortunately today I'm just too tired or depressed or tired of being depressed or maybe even depressed because I am tired (of being depressed(recurse ad infinitum) to be half-witted today. I mean halfway wittty. Half-witted I can do with my right brain tied behind my back. Not today. Nothing to read here. Move along.  
	
	 My understanding is the believers will be taken to heaven by Christ tomorrow anyway (5/21/2011), followed by several months of death and destruction leading to the final end of the world. So really this is of little consequence. 

	This is not the description you're looking for. You don't need to see my birth certificate.
	
	When I get like this, my psychiatrist saysâ€¦ well, she says something. She always says something. The problem is none of them are as entertaining as when Michael Scott used to say "That's what she said" on TV in "The Office". 
	
	So while my neurons continue to malfunction and idiots abound who don't believe in "mental illness" (because unlike the liver, heart, kidney's etc the brain cannot have any disorder) and so they think "it's all in his head", little realizing how incredibly ironic that dismissal is -  because, in fact, yes the organ of my body that is having a neuro-chemical imbalance, is, in fact, in my headâ€¦, I realize that the only thing that has kept me alive this long is sheer guilt about obligations to the living I'd leave behind -- So-- since MTCDC-NMC is an obligation I owe to all of you, I not only can't kill myself without feeling bad about it, but I'm going to feel terrible if I get caught up to heaven tomorrow since I'd leave some of you behind without the comics I promised. I know that would be your number one concern. On the plus side, I'd be in paradise. Unfortunately I expect to be at work on Monday.

	On the other plus side (that would be your plus side), you get all these comics.

	I wish I had the money to buy the all the old comics that I share, I really do. A complete set of DC. Nothing less. If you do have any cash, support your local comics shop and buy some oldies. Where would you be without the shop? I never read anything modern, being seriously stuck in the middle 20th century. Unfortunately I can't afford the 50-80 year old comics I love - which, in an arrogant and downright flamboyant display of what's wrong with the universe, are frequently considered too valuable to actually READ by those who can afford them. If I could afford them I probably would not have digital comics. Paper is real. Electrons and photons are quantum illusions, man.
	Also, since I never read 21st century comics, I only get the scans of new ones to share with you. Seriously, that's the reason. So enjoy. But if you typically read the new stuff, support the industry and buy those. Comic book character's really can die.
