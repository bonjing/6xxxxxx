From Wiki:


Sloan is a Toronto-based alternative rock quartet from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Throughout their 20-year tenure Sloan has released nine LPs (one being a double), two EPs, a live album, a "best of" collection and no less than thirty singles. The band is known for their sharing of songwriting from each member of the group and their unaltered line-up throughout their career; a feat that is seldom seen in the Rock music industry.

The band was formed in 1991 when Chris Murphy and Andrew Scott met at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) in Halifax; Patrick Pentland and Jay Ferguson joined soon after. In 1992 the band created their own record label, Murderecords, for themselves and other Halifax area bands, and released the Peppermint EP.

According to Sloan's official website,[1] the band's name refers to a friend's nickname. Their friend Jason Larsen was called Slow One by his French-speaking boss, which with the French accent sounded more like Sloan. The original agreement was that they could name the band after their friend's nickname as long as he was on the cover of their first album. As a result, it is Larsen who appears on the cover of the Peppermint EP.

Later in 1992 Sloan released their full-length album Smeared on Geffen Records. In 1994 Geffen did not promote their second album, Twice Removed, due to artistic disputes,[2] although it sold well in Canada. Spin named it one of the "Best Albums You Didn't Hear" in 1994. A 1996 reader poll by Canadian music magazine Chart! ranked it as the best Canadian album of all time, only two years after its release.[3] The same poll in 2000 ranked the album third, behind Joni Mitchell's Blue and Neil Young's Harvest.[4] However, the 2005 poll once again ranked the album first.[2]

After the release of Twice Removed, the band went on hiatus and were rumoured to have broken up, as they had rejected Geffen's offer for their next album.[5] In 1996, however, they released the widely praised One Chord to Another on their own Murderecords label. Following 1998's Navy Blues album, Sloan released their first live album 4 Nights at the Palais Royale in 1999. Those albums were followed by Between the Bridges in 1999, and Pretty Together in 2001.

Sloan made a concerted effort to break into the US market on their 2003 release Action Pact. Songs were recorded in L.A. with Tom Rothrock producing. The glossier, radio-ready sound failed to raise Sloan's profile in the US, though they continued to be highly popular in Canada.[6]

Sloan's first compilation album A Sides Win: Singles 1992-2005, included two new songs, "All Used Up" and "Try to Make It". The Japanese release included two additional new tracks.

Now signed to Yep Roc Records for their US releases, they put out their eighth disc, Never Hear the End of It in 2006. The album contained 30 tracks with all the members of the band contributing new songs. It was met with widespread critical acclaim and became the highest charting Sloan album in the US up to that point.

In 2008, Sloan followed up their longest album with their shortest release Parallel Play.

In November 2009 Sloan added a digital music store to their website. The band released an online-only EP called Hit & Run to promote the store. The EP featured two songs by Chris Murphy, and one by each of the other band members. Murphy's Take It Upon Yourself was released as a free single. In February 2010, the band released another online exclusive, the compilation album B-Sides Win: Extras, Bonus Tracks and B-Sides 1992 - 2008.

Sloan announced plans to release a 10th album in 2011, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of their first show.[8]

On February 22, 2011, Sloan announced that their new album would be released on May 10, 2011. The album is entitled The Double Cross, a nod to their 20th (or XX) anniversary. The album is preceded by the its first single, "Unkind".

With the release of the The Double Cross, Sloan has now released a catalogue of around 175 different songs.

In promotion of the new album, a special video series produced and directed by Catherine Stockhausen has been launched on YouTube to commemorate the illustrious success of the band. Interviewed in these videos are several musicians and celebrities such as Jason Schwartzman, Joel Plaskett, Stefan Brogren, Dave Foley, Kevin Drew, Buck 65, Ian D'Sa and Benjamin Kowalewicz from Billy Talent, K-OS, and Dave Hamlin.

All four members of Sloan write their own songs, and when they play live they switch instruments accordingly. Usually the band performs as follows: Murphy is on lead vocals and plays bass, Pentland is also on lead vocals and plays lead guitar, Ferguson plays rhythm guitar, and Scott plays drums.

While Murphy has written more of the band's songs than any of the other members, Pentland is nonetheless responsible for having written many of Sloan's most recognizable hits. Perhaps more noteworthy, however, is the fact that every member of the group has contributed at least two songs per album, with only the following exceptions: On 1992's debut LP, Smeared, Scott and Pentland are credited with just one song each, while on 2003's Action Pact, Scott has no songs, for according to Eye Weekly, that album's producer, Tom Rothrock, essentially randomly selected tracks out of the band's submissions in the interest of creating a more streamlined sound. Scott's songwriting output at that time may also have been somewhat diminished because he had recently become a father





Smeared 1992


Smeared was the first full-length album released by the Canadian rock band Sloan. It was released in Canada in October, 1992, and in the United States in January, 1993, on Geffen Records. Like their first release, the Peppermint EP, it was seen as a noisy pop record reminiscent of Sonic Youth with Beatles-style harmonies. Jennifer Pierce of fellow Halifax, Nova Scotia band Jale sang backup vocals on "I Am the Cancer". The album was certified Gold in Canada on July 12, 1995.

The album was ranked 86th in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums.

Twice Removed 1994


Twice Removed is the second album by Canadian rock band Sloan. It was released on Geffen Records in 1994, and is considered to be one of their best albums. It was more melodic and catchy than their previous album, Smeared, and as a result Geffen did not promote it very well because it didn't fit the commercially dominant grunge rock style of the time. The band was dropped from Geffen after Twice Removed was released. Although it was the record that made them famous in Canada, Sloan took time off from touring and writing after the troubles with Geffen, and they were rumoured to have broken up. The album was certified Gold in Canada on October 20, 1998.

Jennifer Pierce from Jale appears once again as a backup singer on "I Can Feel It".

One Chord To Another 1996



One Chord to Another is the third album by Canadian rock band, Sloan. After rumours that they had broken up following the problems they faced with Geffen Records when Twice Removed was released, Sloan began touring and writing again in 1995 and released One Chord to Another on Murderecords in 1996. Like the previous album it was a catchy, Beatles-influenced pop record. The band also experimented with instruments they had never used before, such as piano, trumpets, and maracas. The album was certified Gold in Canada on November 21, 1996. It also won the award for Best Alternative Album at the 1997 Juno Awards.

Navy Blues 1998


Navy Blues was the fourth album by Canadian rock band Sloan. Released on Murderecords in 1998, it was a little heavier than their previous albums, showing an influence from 1970s rock mixed with their usual catchy, melodic, Beatles-esque sound. The album contains arguably their most popular song, "Money City Maniacs". "Money City Maniacs" was used in a beer commercial at the time; furthermore, it became a top 10 hit in their native Canada and received heavy radio airplay. The album was certified Gold in Canada on June 12, 1998. Navy Blues was also nominated for Best Rock Album at the 1999 Juno Awards.

Pretty Together 2001


Pretty Together is the sixth album by Canadian rock group Sloan. It was released on Murderecords in 2001, and is often seen as the band's most mature album. While it still has the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1990s influences of Between the Bridges, it is more melancholy with fewer of the upbeat songs found on previous albums. 'If It Feels Good Do It' and 'The Other Man' were the two major singles from the album, with the latter being a melancholy plea by Chris Murphy which marked an outing from the usual upbeat songs Murphy provides the group with. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2002 Juno Awards.

From this album, "If It Feels Good Do It" and "The Other Man" were released as singles. Although the album did not chart or do well in sales, both singles received notable radio airplay.
