- The Legendary Bob Dylan Turns 70: Democracy Now! Airs Rare Interviews From Pacifica Radio Archives

Today Bob Dylan turns 70-years-old and we air a special program on his life and music. Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. Raised in Hibbing, Minnesota, he moved to Greenwich Village in January of 1961. Within a couple of years, Dylan would be viewed by many as the voice of a generation as he wrote some of the decades most famous songs including "Blowing in the Wind," "The Times They Are A Changing," "Like A Rolling Stone," "Masters of War," "Desolation Row" and "Mr. Tambourine Man." After emerging from the New York City folk scene, Dylan explored many other genres from rock to country to the blues. He continues to tour to this day. In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize jury awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power." But before Bob Dylan became a musical star, he was one of countless young musicians in New York City trying to get heard. Some of his earliest radio appearances were on Pacifica radio station, WBAI. We speak with the legendary WBAI broadcaster Bob Fass, the host of Radio Unnamable, who interviewed Dylan several times. We air excerpts of those interviews and feature Fass's photos of Dylan. Fass' show began in 1963 and became a leading outlet for the emerging counterculture of the 1960s. It still airs every Thursday night at midnight. We also speak with music writer Elizabeth Thomson co-editor of the newly reissued book, "No Direction Home: The Life and Music of Bob Dylan," written by the late Robert Shelton.
