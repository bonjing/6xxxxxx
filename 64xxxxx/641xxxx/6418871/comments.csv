,daucuskarota,2011-05-28T17:59Z,"Many thanks, but, why isn't sound during videos, menu and ingame? I go and check sound optins and see mute is on, but i can't deactive it.
It seems all the sounds options can't be configurated as seems ""darker"" than the other options at video and controls, that can be configurated and seem ""brigther"""
