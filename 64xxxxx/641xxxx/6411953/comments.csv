Is it just me or has everything gone all green around here?"

You are a total legend. Stupid bloody iPlayer won't let anyone watch programmes outside the UK. I'm a British citizen and I'd be happy (well, maybe not happy, but willing) to pay the license fee from abroad. Silly rules - thank god for bit torrent and people like you! "
