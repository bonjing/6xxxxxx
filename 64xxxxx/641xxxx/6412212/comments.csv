,gregersamsa,2011-05-22T13:55Z,Thanks for not using the pre-neolithic rar-archiving system!
,geolittle,2011-05-22T14:31Z,Any mkv versions without embedded subtitles?
,Subjazz,2011-05-23T00:40Z,love the uploads eztv but this one was crappy and choppy while trying to play it on VLC. stick to avi or something plz... 
,jeebexton,2011-05-23T01:22Z,Super torrent as usual but PLEASE don't embed the subtitles 
,Livens,2011-05-23T03:26Z,"*** ATTENTION ALL ***

The subtitles are NOT embedded... Just set your player not to display them.

Why people automatically assume its always someone elses fault Ill never know.

As always thanks for the 720 eztv!"
,hot_soup,2011-05-23T03:48Z,"This is a .mkv file, the subtitles (english) are included but they are NOT hardcoded.  Just deselect them in your player if you don't want to see them.

Thanks you for including the subtitles!"
,errata24,2011-05-23T05:33Z,"Don't know what you guys are doing, but there is no way to turn of the subtitles with windows media player or windows player classic. I'll try VLC later, but just thought i'd mention this. Not sure what Livens and hot_soup are using. "
,errata24,2011-05-23T05:35Z,"disregard my last statement, you can turn of the subtitles in BS player."
,SD_rocks,2011-05-23T13:10Z,yeah of course this works :P 
,Interrogatory,2011-05-24T02:28Z,"This file will not open with the latest version of VLC (1.1.9). Are we sure this file is good and, if so, what are you using to play it?"
,Interrogatory,2011-05-24T02:29Z,"Sorry, take back the previous comment. It just takes a LOOOOONG time to open in VLC. Not sure why."
,ccp041985,2011-05-24T13:29Z,never fail to love the comments. works like a charm as do all your ups. no hardcoded subs.Thanks again
,SomeScottishGuy,2011-05-28T20:53Z,"Downloaded it last week, very good quality upload as always. I'm hoping you'll upload episode 6 too. The subtitles are easily switched off with VLC but I just used MKVextract and MKVmerge to remove the subs completely."
