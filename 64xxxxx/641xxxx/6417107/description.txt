 This is the story of the Charles Heidsieck who opened   
 the market for Champagne sales in America just prior to 
 the American Civil War. He is a reluctant French spy    
 and is captured and spends time in a Union prison.      
 There are two parallel love stories (he is French) and  
 some battles with his uncle for control of the family   
 vineyard (because his father married his mother who the 
 uncle also loved).

  The audio on the dvd was not in sync for most of the flick,  
  so we edited the audio it to get it closer. There are still  
  small sync issues in some of the movie, but the final is     
  much better than the source sync. Enjoy.
