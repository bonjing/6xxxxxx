This is not one of those books floating around on the net for a long time. I had

purchased this book long time ago, and also had scanned the whole book long

time ago. Maybe someone can do OCR and reduce it to a small size, I have

PDF version that I made also but this will be easy for some one to turn it in to a

nice book. The whole book is in JPEG scanned pages.

Also this book is somewhat different than the ones floating around on the net,

this book I have found to have passages on how to recognize sexual signals

women give (consciously or unconsciously) and how to respond to them.

Following this book I had great success with women. It is very easy to follow,

although it was written over 2000 years ago, it is still very much the same.

Please seed after downloading it.

Good luck with this.
