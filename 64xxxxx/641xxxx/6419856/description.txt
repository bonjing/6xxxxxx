Liam Mullane Finn (born 24 September 1983 in Melbourne, Australia) is a New Zealand musician and songwriter. Born in Australia, he moved to New Zealand as a child. He is the son of pop musician Neil Finn (of Split Enz and Crowded House).


Well-known as the frontman of New Zealand band Betchadupa, in 2007 Finn released his solo debut I'll Be Lightning, which draws on his experiences from living in London in recent years. Finn chose to record the album entirely in analogue at his father's recording studio, Roundhead Studios, in Auckland. During concerts, he creates an instrumental layering effect by using a looping effects pedal, the Line6 JM-4 Looper, as well as a Boss Super-Octave 3 to create bass guitar lines; he is also accompanied by backup vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Eliza-Jane Barnes. In a recent article, it is announced that this yet to be titled album will be released in May of this year (2011). His first single, "The Struggle," was released 21 February, and he also announced a small number of shows in New Zealand along with a 14-date North American tour. Finn will be touring with his new full band named 'Liam Finn and the Come Agains.'
