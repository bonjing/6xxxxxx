,cirios8300,2011-05-24T20:05Z,Thank you Master     Hero_No_1 !
,steve30x,2011-05-24T20:10Z,By the way this is downloading I will get it downloaded this time next year. I see 1 seed 124 leechers and 0% availability
,steve30x,2011-05-24T20:14Z,..
,rozdvd,2011-05-24T21:14Z,omg skidrow! pls dont make cracks with paul.dll or New skidrow.dll...there is a virus...and my pc is not allowing me to copy the file! even with my antivirus disabled! 
,rozdvd,2011-05-24T21:46Z,and there is no way to disable UAC! so pls fix that... my win7 is not allowing me to use these dll files coz its dangerous for my pc...that happens only with Fable3/witcher2/dirt3 crack dlls
,MaxxDamage,2011-05-24T22:04Z,
,MaxxDamage,2011-05-24T22:04Z,oh.. god
,undermaker,2011-05-24T22:10Z,this is SHIT !  real crack is only 713kb ! http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6419479/Dirt.3.CrackOnly-SKIDROW-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D
,EP91GlanzaV,2011-05-24T23:14Z,"I'm guessing this is only for the Steam pre-load version and NOT the retail clone dvd. If you copy the .exe from this one to the directory and you try to launch it, it will give an error with something about steam. If you have the retail clone dvd, get the 700 kb one (or don't copy the exe). Also gave a virus error on 2 files, but that's most likely bullshit like always."
,steve30x,2011-05-24T23:30Z,"@ rozdvd : You havent a clue. The Paul.dll and skidrow.dll files arent viruses. They are what is known as false positives. 

Also UAC can be disabled if you knew what you are doing. I have UAC diabled on my computer. 

I also have this downloaded and it works perfect."
,lordnaul,2011-05-25T00:17Z,crashes after start. any ideas? thx.
,AKERSEKOMIS,2011-05-25T02:38Z,Does this work with the CLONEDVD version?
[T],torrentshredder,2011-05-25T02:50Z,"is the XXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXXX stuff as a serial only a placeholder or is that supposed to be Xes?

or any other real numbers? any details? what is the real deal?"
,jps48,2011-05-25T08:57Z,@Akers Yes it does. However it  seems impossible to save a profile. I have a local profile for games for windows live too. The same process worked for Dirt 2.
,xenterx,2011-05-25T12:19Z,Does anybody have found a way how do save the progress ?
,marcomarti,2011-05-25T13:43Z,"Aplication error: steam api 1:0000065675

3_ Error Problesm
- Make Sure install DirectX New VERSION
- Make Sure install GFWL (Games for Windows Live)
- Make Sure you'r Anti Virus not removing the .dll files
- Make Sure Windows defender not deleting the .dll too

More Info___
Anti-virus programs always say that cracks are viruses, because cracks modify data just like viruses do. Difference is one of them is good :D"

,PunkBuzter,2012-01-15T18:23Z,"SOOOO MANYYYY NOOOOOBS HEEEEREEE......!!!!!
Wooooooooow, i have never seen so much noobish noobs in one place like this EVER :O

okey first off, ONE; cracks are changed data, your free shit-anti-virus will 7/10 times tell you a crack is a virus, this is called a FALSE-POSETIVE (((use google to learn more about it)))

and TWO; learn to READ the fuckin' .nfo file !!! right-click the .nfo and open it with ""Notepad"" """"Noooooote paaaaaad"""", then follow the instructions inside it!

THREE; i'd like to tell you folks that SKIDROW is the largest (so called) force out there cracking games for you every month! after YEARS of experience in cracking games, you guys are still saying there's a virus??????

-------------------------------
if you still ain't sure about a torrent named ""SKIDROW"" then go look for the god damn forum and perhaps register? ..so you know when the actual SKIDROW team uploads anything.

secondly, try pressing the uploaders name, you'll see he's got 25 pages, thats right.. TWENTY-FIVE PAGES of uploads plus ""Hero_No_1"" has been assigned ""Helper"", still don't feel like this dude knows what he's doing?? then get the fuck off TPB!

i'd recomend getting a better Anti-Virus, and i'm not talking about some free shit like AVG or Avast. i'd recomend downloading KasperSky, WinClam, or Nod32."
,Deckard_Cain,2012-04-27T09:33Z,@PunkBuzter. You'r a loser.
,DANNYonPC,2012-04-28T14:23Z,"It works fine, and check his name

thanks hero ^^"
,ezequiel14,2012-05-03T17:31Z,"@PunkBuzter

Lol, i have Nod32 and the dll's files are troyans."
,Majestik1,2012-05-05T01:55Z,"your antivirus may/will detect paul.dll and skidrow.dll as a potential or actual virus.
they are NOT
and you will need to add an exception to your a/v 

ESET users HOW TO: (version 5)
older versions are very similar
-------------------------------

RECOVERING DELETED FILES BY ESET
--------------------------------
1] double click your icon in the tray by the clock and hit F5
2] in the left pane click tools> then in the right pane click quarantine
3] the two files at the top (skidrow.dll and paul.dll) can be right clicked>retored. Some people have luck with right click>restore AND exclude from detection. if it is greyed out read on.

EXCLUDING FROM DETECTION
------------------------
1] double click your icon in the tray by the clock and hit F5
2] go to computer>antivirus and antispyware>exclusions
3] in the right pane click add
4] navigate to you folder that has been extracted (-=UPDATE=- - wherever you extracted to and choose the paull.dll file click ok
5] repeat steps 3 & 4 again for skidrow.dll.
6] when you copy these 2 files to your installation directory you may or may not need to do steps 3-5 again but this time pointing to where you copied the cracked files (your installation dir)"
,Majestik1,2012-05-05T01:57Z,"i fucked up, i said -=UPDATE=-  folder - i MEANT the SKIDROW folder"
,petmin102,2012-05-08T20:43Z,The crack works and is not a virus. Just copy all the files EXCEPT the .exe file and run the game.
,dankodigo,2012-05-12T21:29Z,"Works perfectly, copy only dll files, not .exe"
,hardcorex,2012-06-06T01:31Z,"Not working for me, It downloaded succesfully the first time, but skidrow.dll would not copy over because it couldn't find the original file, although I was looking right at it.

Tried to re-download and now it says I don't have permission to download this torrent in Utorrent. Never seen this before..."
,BioHazard34,2012-06-17T16:36Z,"I found a solution for all error 5:000006564

It was telling me to ""insert disc"" and error with paul.dll isn't correct for windows etc after copying only the 3 dll. 
So I copied the .exe crack also, and then ""Application load error 5:0000065434""....

I added paul.dll and SKIDROW.dll to exceptions in NOD32, and then what I did is to repair DiRT 3 from control panel/uninstall a programm, click on DiRT 3 then uninstall, click next etc then choose to Repair the game, wait until it finish (it takes time like installing...) and then everything worked perfect!

Weird from a Skidrow release though this was a waste of time with all these bullshit Paul and Fanny gay dll errors."
