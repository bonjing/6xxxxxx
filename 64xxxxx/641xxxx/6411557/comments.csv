btw what's the difference between iTunesRIP and CDRip...(except that CDRIps are Ripped from CD's)"
[V],jainmehul,2011-05-27T15:06Z,"@fafxal :-

iTunesRip comes from the Itunes m4a aac files provided by itunes if we buy it from there.for eg this album can be purchased from here :-

http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/born-this-way-bonus-track/id438731876

and i think you know what CDRips are.It should be  noted that iTunesrip aren't purchased from me,they come from various blogs."
