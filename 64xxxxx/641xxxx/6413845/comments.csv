,j00rgen,2011-06-07T08:11Z,I've been searching google with no spot-on result: How do I make Tomtom think I have bought this map?
,bunga-bunga,2011-06-08T12:11Z,"@j00rgen

You need to activate the map, in order to utilize it on your TomTom device.
Use the activation tool 'Easy Activator'. You can download it from:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5786989/Albert_s_Easy_Activator_v0.57.21

The Easy Activator takes you step-by-step through the process of activating
the map. 

For the activation process a map-specific file 'meta.txt' is required:
With a text editor, for instance the Windows Editor, generate a new
file and insert the meta code I posted above into this file and save
it as 'meta.txt'.

After having completed activation, copy the map folder to the root
directory of you TT device.

Make sure that the Navcore of your TT is 9.02 or higher, otherwise
the map won't work.

I would recommend to make a full backup of the files on your TT device, 
before copying the new map to it.
