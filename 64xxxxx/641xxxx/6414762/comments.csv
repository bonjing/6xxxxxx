I really enjoyed this movie at the theater and want a good copy of it, that is why I asked some questions, and by the way, it hasn't come out on DVD yet, so how did he get it? "

,LukeScooto,2011-06-17T04:41Z,"Hey, I have 500+ movies on my PogoPlug and 1TB external Hard Drive, and im on a 12mbps cable connection. Ill post the list and share any and all movies that anyone wants me to, if someone can give me a good copy of the real Battle: L.A. with Aaron Eckart. I suppose I can just go to RedBox and get it myself shortly, but my car broke down and I dont have a ride, and I want it. I already seen it at the theater, but I want to see it again. If you doubt my movies, check some of the ones ive uploaded here, you can see I do have HQ MP4/H.264 movies, most in Ipod/Ipad format. Holla at me if anyone has it and ill work something out with posting my flicks."
