,gaaraisgod,2011-07-05T21:00Z,"What was your source for this? 1080p or 720p?

Thanks for the movie. Even now, there is no other release less than 2CDs. This is kinda a middle ground and acceptable for me :)"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-07-08T00:27Z,"my friends:

it doesn't matter the source .. if it was something of quality.

it counts the source...if you really ..can count 720p ..  or 1080p

....and the result is your answer.. quality or... not ...???"
