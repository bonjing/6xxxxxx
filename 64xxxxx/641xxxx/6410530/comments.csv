,beeftv,2011-12-13T01:04Z,"only 400 megs for a 720p movies.

You have to be some kind of fucking moron to do that.

It makes no sense. It's clearly going to look like shit."

I think you're still stuck in the Xvid age, embrace the wonders of h264 compression!

Although 400mb is a little low, even yifi's torrents are 700mb (and look good if you don't have a monster TV), hard drives are super cheap and downloads are super fast, we really don't mind downloading 7gb rips with DTS soundtracks, things don't have to fit on a CD anymore...
