Unabridged

I am reuploading this in a different form. Before it was one mp3 for each of the 18 CDs. This version has one mp3 for each story which I'm sure most people prefer. I plan to do this for a couple more Holmes torrents which could benefit.
For my torrents that I've personally ripped I try to remove the 'end of side 1', 'start of side 2' etc announcements however for this upload I haven't. It would of been a lot of work with fade-ins and fade outs needed because of music and the way it's used. 

About the book itself:
"Sherlock Holmes, the worldâ€™s firstâ€”and most famousâ€”consulting detective, came to the worldâ€™s attention more than 120 years ago through Sir Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s novels and stories. But Conan Doyle didnâ€™t reveal all of the Great Detectiveâ€™s adventuresâ€¦
Here are some of the best Holmes pastiches of the last 30 years, twenty-eight tales of mystery and the imagination detailing Holmesâ€™s further exploits, as told by many of todayâ€™s greatest storytellers, including Stephen King, Anne Perry, Anthony Burgess, Neil Gaiman, Naomi Novik, Stephen Baxter, Tanith Lee, Michael Moorcock, and many more.
These are the improbable adventures of Sherlock Holmes, where nothing is impossible, and nothing can be ruled out. In these cases, Holmes investigates ghosts, curses, aliens, dinosaurs, shapeshifters, and evil gods. But is it the supernatural, or is there a perfectly rational explanation?
You wonâ€™t be sure, and neither will Holmes and Watson as they match wits with pirates, assassins, con artists, and criminal masterminds of all stripes, including some familiar foes, such as their old nemesis, Professor Moriarty.
In these pages youâ€™ll also find our heroes crossing paths with H. G. Wells, Lewis Carroll, and even Arthur Conan Doyle himself, and youâ€™ll be astounded to learn the truth behind cases previously alluded to by Watson but never before documented until now. These are tales that take us from the familiar quarters at 221B Baker Street to alternate realities, from the gaslit streets of London to the far future and beyond.
Whether itâ€™s mystery, fantasy, horror, or science fiction, no puzzle is too challenging for the Great Detective. The game is afoot!"
