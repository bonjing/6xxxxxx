i appreciate the english subtitles too.
i'm not deaf or hard of hearing and english is my first language. but, having the subs helps me focus and follow what is going on. also, it's really helpful when actors whisper or mumble words :)
hope the 720p rips keep coming!"

Thanks for your appreciation, I agree with you on the subtitles issue. I'll definitely will continue to upload 720p episodes and subtitles, hopefully I keep on finding them."
