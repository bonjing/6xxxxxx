Since I run Windows 7 64bit, I first tried the x64 plugin, but the software didn't recognize it (could be the limitation of software rather then the LAME plugin being defective). It did recognized the 32bit plugin, so I used that one and it works like a charm!

Thanks for a good working upload! I'll also seed for a while."
