,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T09:22Z,"The quality isn't ""excellent"" and is worse than most of yify's uploads but I think it's the source that's the problem as there is alot of pixelation and artifacts thoughout the movie.

,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T09:28Z,"Also, I rated the video without edge and colour enhancement, as using those with your graphics card or media player makes these small size files worse as it makes the flaws more noticeable in any highly compressed video."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T09:31Z,"I should mention that I had edge & colour enhancement turned off as those options make flaws in video more noticable. 

You can turn those things off in most graphics cards settings and windows media player classic: home cinema."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T09:33Z,"Crap, sorry for the double post as the second post didn't go though straight away."
,miketheratguy,2011-08-10T05:28Z,"I love most of YIFY's rips but, like all people, he's not infallible.

The general quality of the A/V of this copy are great, as usual. But there's a strange visual problem that I've encountered before and I'm not tech savvy enough to know what causes it or what can be done (if anything) to fix it.

From time to time there are weird ""blur pulses"" that occur on the picture. It's as if you're looking through heat waves or something. This happens occasionally throughout the film. I found it most evident at about the 28 minute mark- check out Arnold's face right after he hits the woman with the gun at the end of the village clearing scene.

Again, I don't know what this is called or what causes it. You might not notice it much or care but there may be some of you like me who can't ""unsee"" stuff like that once we notice it.

I'm not complaining- the download was free and YIFI is a good uploader- this is just something to be aware of if you're expecting a picture with no noticeable flaws."
