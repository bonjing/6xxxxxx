no worries dude.....we all have problems.....hope you start soon again!!"
[V],globeplus,2011-05-28T12:08Z,"To gauvi149 : unplug the controller and use the keybord but after a few tentatives of the controller bindings beeing acceptable with normality in succession you get the controller ok too , some games can have ununexpected troubleshooting with the controllers use , it is like that ...

And to the other comments : thank you very much but in life sometimes we get ununexpected problems that we have to deal off , what it is important is no matter are the difficulties we still close to our principles and thinking in keeping a nice files sharing spirit , it is healphy and it is more pleasure using the files like that . Thank you ."
,WiKiH,2011-05-29T23:54Z,"Hi Globe, so if You don't be make a games anymore so maybe You can tell me how can I do this? I tried make a portable games but it didn't was a good, because I don't have a ""coach"" to this. So what are You think? How can I start to do this."
[V],globeplus,2011-05-31T21:22Z,"To Wikih : hey,no big deal to help you with a nice general tip : install the game that you want and after applying the worked executable if the game is ok copy the entire folder to the desktop then uninstall the game from the computer and launch the copy on the desktop and see if it works , in 90% of the games have a good possibility of that and with that meaning that you can put the game wherever you want on the computer or external hard drive , now letÂ´s analise if the game donÂ´t work : so , if donÂ´t we can have 2 possible options : 1 - the game need an obrigatory registry information that makes the executable works and in this case we must have a fixed directory to the game installation normaly the computer folder for games , the other option is that in a few registry cases the reg file can be used with the game portable but without other necessary information beside the exact location like a serial or specific information that can be in some other computer location but the portability can be simple but turning the game light and easy to use that it is another story but use my tip if you want and you welcome to ask more tips if you want , enjoy your files and thank you for the comment ."
