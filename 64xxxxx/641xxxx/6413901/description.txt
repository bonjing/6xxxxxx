A tale of drugs, prostitution and a young girl's fight for survival - against all the odds.

Imelda Dooley is scared. Really scared. Sheâ€™s played hard and fast and now sheâ€™s been caught. Sheâ€™s pregnant and now sheâ€™s on her own. Her father, not a man to mess with, will see that somebody pays for this. And itâ€™s not going to be her. So Imelda Dooley tells a lie. A lie that literally causes murders.

When Mary Dooleyâ€™s husband is killed in the nightâ€™s events, she knows she must graft to keep the family afloat. And graft she does, becoming a name in her own right. But she still has to watch her daughterâ€™s life spiral into a vicious, hate-fuelled cycle of drugs and prostitution.

Caught up in the carnage that is Imeldaâ€™s existence are Maryâ€™s adored grandchildren, Jordanna and Kenny. Pretty little Jordanna isnâ€™t yet three and she already knows far too much. All she can do is look after her baby brother, Kenny, and try not to draw unwanted attention to herself.
