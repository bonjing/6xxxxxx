Cheers r3dcat "
,Ganzinha,2011-07-09T22:09Z,"well is not working via USB + external hd
i believe that i will need to be conected via HDMI 1.4 3D, to be able to chose the 4th 3D option on my LG lx6500 that is the one with frame packing.
This movie doesnt appear in 2 half for me.

someone experienced the same??

,aholmes,2011-07-11T01:11Z,@Ganzinha Go and buy yourself a 16gb usb stick :)
,Ganzinha,2011-07-12T02:10Z,with a usb stik will work ?? some explanation for that?
,phpman,2011-07-13T00:39Z,"Works on our Panasonic Blu-ray and 3D TV. Played from a USB stick, it occasionally reverts to 2D, but can be continued in 3D with a few button presses. Panasonic seems to be a bit too finicky with signals and won't interpolate what appears to be a glitch in the stream.

Thanks a lot r3dcat for your 3D torrents."

,carnetic,2011-11-01T10:55Z,"Wow, thank you for making such high quality downloads available. These are perfect for my LG LED TV. Thank you :-)"
