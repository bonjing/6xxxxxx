Special Note from Andrew Kramer: 
It was difficult to put into words what this collection is... We see these organic effects in commercials, music videos, and even movie trailers so naturally I wanted to bring these visual elements together. Included with this stock footage collection are 5 in-depth video tutorials that demonstrate the title graphics above. Not to mention, a couple of prominent design studios have already been using beta copies of Riot Gear! I'm looking forward to sharing their feedback with you soon.
