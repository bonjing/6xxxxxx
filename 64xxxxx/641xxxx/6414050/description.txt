Here is the complete list of Professor Messer's CompTIA A+ 220-702 series of movies. put them in order and are well organized to watch one after the other.
left them in there original format so you can convert to what ever you would like there in 480P so they look nice either on your monitor or phone.

the mans a genius i have tried to watch the CBTnuggets and i just couldn't finish them i watched all of Professor messer's with a little help from Google and i passed both my 220-701 & 220-702 first try and all i had was these videos so i decided to make it more convenient for you all and have them all in one spot =)

hope you enjoy and learn from this man...
