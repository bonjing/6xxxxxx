Marathi Movie Rita (2009)

Rita Welinkar is the main character in this film. Rita is the girl who got an English environment in her family by her father and mother. The image of her mother in her eyes is â€˜a perfumed womenâ€™ just due to her high cultured, high fashioned lifestyle. She never saw original shade of motherâ€™s love in her motherâ€™s eyes. While growing in â€˜conventryâ€™ environment, suddenly a problem occurs in her family and she had to take all the responsibility of the family on her delicate shoulders. During this journey of a common struggle she met Viththal Salvi who is 15 years elder than her. As the time passes she realized that she is in love
with Salvi. Same case about Salvi. And Rita starts a new life to understand herself and also to live for herself. She built up her own world with Salvi. 

  But lots of social, mental problems arise in their life due to their unacceptable relation. Rita always prefers to live openly, to make relations openly with divine and clear mind. But the situation does not allow her to live in her own way. In this travel one of her friend Saraswati helps her to stand strongly after facing storms.

  The story puts lots of questions before the viewers patiently and in a decent way. Pallavi Joshi and Jackey Shroff had played roles of Rita and Salvi excellently. Mohen Aagashe, Makarand Deshpande, Renuka Shahane are the remarkable actors in this film who played their characters artistically.

  The whole film have southern touch in its scenes, dialogues that give a beautiful feel of wonderful nature to viewers. Taufic Quereshiâ€™s background music suits this feel very beautifully. This movie is the example of a ideal and sensible Marathi movie.
