This is one of the most phenomenal books about creation and God that I have read.  Well worth the time and effort."

While I still believe that this Man of Epic Divine Power would get bored after 13.7 billion years of sitting on his throne, (or excuse me, was it 6011?) I now believe that we can never really know for sure while we're still alive. So I'll see it when I see it hopefully 60-80+ years from now. "
