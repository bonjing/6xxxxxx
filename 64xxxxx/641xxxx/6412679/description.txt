[DESCRIPTION.]:
A team of maritime engineers battle to move and sink a huge
US Navy ship in the Cayman Islands to create an artificial dive
reef.

The team must battle winter storms and huge swells to tow
the USS Kittiwake 1,600 miles from Virginia to the Caribbean.
They must strip out all hazardous material from the old vessel,
power clean her in a dry dock and cut holes in her hull to
enable her to sink in a controlled flooding.

Sink Master John MacKenzie must devise a foolproof way to
ensure that the Kittiwake remains perfectly level and upright
as he attempts to sink her onto a tiny site on the ocean floor
surrounded by fragile coral on one side and a 1,000ft abyss
on the other.
