Free MC Boot version 1.8b with ESR




Contains guides and how to setup.


Read included info. You must have a boot method to get to the installer, With a readable USB Fat 32 formated flash drive that works in your PS2.


Some PS2's won't work with FMCB.



This is called soft modding and works with alot of games but not all.
Currently this version or past of FMCB/ESR won't work with PS2 CD type games or on the CD-ROM format, but maybe they'll fix that with later releases.


As for DVD9 type PS2 games they have to be patched with Toxic Dual Layer, and
can be a pain it seems alot of times it doesn't work.




Compressed With 7Zip, SEED & Enjoy!
