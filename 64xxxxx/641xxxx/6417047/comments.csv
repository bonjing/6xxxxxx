,PsychoLogic,2011-05-25T14:15Z,"@DeafMackem dunno what happened at year end, but I seeded it the whole time. Maybe have a little patience. Could also maybe say thanks when it finishes. Just a thought.

The Jacket wasn't released on BluRay, so can't do it. Payback and Cloverfield BluRays are on my drive, will do them after Wrong Turn 3 :)"
