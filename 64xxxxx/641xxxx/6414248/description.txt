This is a remake of an old torrent I did a while back.This is the entire Space 1999 TV series in 3GP format.There is a lot of extras like interviews,special effects,a desktop theme (Originally for Windows 9x but adaptable to XP/Vista/Win 7) CBR files of the old comic book series and even a few MP3 files of the old records on the series.

Have fun with this.
