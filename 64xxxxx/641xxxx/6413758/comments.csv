,jamydoug,2011-05-22T19:33Z,"sir, u askd to req The French Connection movie pack this week!! wil u able to upload them in Blu Ray dis week?
"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-22T20:18Z,"@jamydoug: Encoded, I and II, as 480p from reasons I explained (grainy, old, bad footage transferred on BluRay 'as is'). Both finished encodes are in upload right now - and it would take whole night. But - torrent would be upped on Tuesday - after the seeding of this one. Be here then - if you are not mad why it wasn't 720p."

@ALL
Look at the screen-shots. If you have missed some title, click on ""twentyforty"", browse through pages and load torrents you find interesting or missed, keeping eye on screen-shot.
This is LAST CHANCE to get them really fast.

All interested could look what is on seeding server till 26th.
You all have few days left. 

If you have problems with connection to that server and IF you run PeerBlock, find OVH in active connections list, right-click on it and do ""Allow permanently"".

Let me know, I can put needed torrent as ""High priority"" one. "

actual value is 2.4 ratio...
i have no more bandwidth...
cheers for my carelessness 
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-24T08:42Z,@houruoha : Sorry my friend. I have on Smiley ratio 78 and number of seeders - goin' lower and lower. Hit&Runners deplete (suck us dry) seeders and wonder (loudly) whenever some torrent is dead.
