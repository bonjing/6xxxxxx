I tried on samsung 3d plasma, I am not able to play this video's too.

a bit research and i find out that the max frame rate for my TV is 8 to 30 fps

Thanks to r3dcat for providing this video. 
he used Frame Rate: 47.952431


How to make it work: ( reduce frame rate to 30 fps)
-------------------

1) download HD convertor software, i used

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6168821/WinX_HD_Video_Converter_4.1

2) after install

i tried different settings, but the one fastest i could find is to convert to avi using divx format

click +Add button to add the file downloaded.

4) choose to hd avi tab

5) leave default settings, change the following

videoquality : 8000 kbps ( to keep small file size)
format: divx
frame rate: 29.97

depending on your system cpu, it will take a hour or two

Now try , should work as for me. Enjoy..."

,Shah_Jahan,2012-02-09T14:44Z,"It has the deepest Out-Of-Screen effect I've ever seen at ~42:35

Starting near 42 minutes are 2 exceptional effects. A tortilla floats to 40% and a thrown orange extends to a whopping 80%, almost bouncing off your face!

The audio and video quality are great! And the 3D effects were just wonderful. And with its small size of just 2GBs, this one is a great download!

And since this had a framerate of 47.952431, the video appeared smoother than the 24FPS videos.

@ r3dcat: How did you encode it @48fps? Was the source 48FPS or did you frame interpolate it to double the FPS?

Thanks for uploading. And I hope to see more of your 3D releases, and hopefully now in 60FPS for an ultra-smooth and fluid playback!
