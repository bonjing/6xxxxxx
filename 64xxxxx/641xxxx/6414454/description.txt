      PLOT SUMMARY     : Milo Tindle and Andrew Wyke have something in
                         common, Andrew's wife. In an attempt to find a way
                         out of this without costing Andrew a fortune in
                         alimony, he suggests Milo pretend to rob his house
                         and let him claim the insurance on the stolen
                         jewelry. The problem is that they don't really like
                         each other and each cannot avoid the zinger on the
                         other. The plot has many shifts in which the
                         advantage shifts between Milo and Andrew.

      SPECiAL NOTES : The copyright on this DVD is 2002, so it can't be the
                      original DVD released in 1998.  While the movie was
                      originally shot in 1.66:1, this DVD is 16:9, and the
                      effective AR isn't far off.  1.66:1 didn't look right,
                      and research showed that the DVD was in fact 1.75:1.

                      It's a great movie, a true imdb 8.0. Enjoy it. -SChiZO
