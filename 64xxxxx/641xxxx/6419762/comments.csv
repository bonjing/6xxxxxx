Don't put out rar'd video-files. Nobody bothers to seed a (minisculy) huge file when it's just taking up space.
If you put up video files as video files and seed them (in one go - meaning, one torrent with 22 video files unrar'd and ready to watch) more people will seed as it will just lay there (being seeded) while they are watching the videos.

A recovery protocol was added though."
