,eXoflow,2011-06-04T12:24Z,Why is this 1920x1080 and the others 1920x1040?

you're welcome.

Here is a snap shot from bluray.com:
http://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/8130745113313/4251_1_1080p.jpg

As you see one would have to crop 21px from top and 21px from bottom (total of weird 42 px). I didn't want to risk getting a weird AR nor funny playback. Probably safest would have been to crop 16px + 16px. 
Un-cropped is maybe about 40 MB bigger but guarantied flawless play back and original AR. One needs to see snap shots from their rips to understand how they were done.
The exact AR of the picture is 1,84971098.
If 1920/1040 (with no black bars) you get AR 1,84615385.

40 px of black bars shouldn't bother you really. 
When it's 280px of black bars is a waste of apx 280 MB, well that is not cool."
