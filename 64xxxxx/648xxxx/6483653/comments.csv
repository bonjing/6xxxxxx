,Timmmm,2012-01-15T00:31Z,"Ah, confusing. I didn't even know there was an American version.

To be clear, this is an American remake (why? seriously?) of the original Danish TV series called The Killing - Forbrydelsen (The Crime) in Danish."
,moshster,2012-04-02T05:44Z,Not every US remake is bad; in recent years US networks have learned not to simply copy but adapt an idea for the US market.  This is a good example of a US remake that is very well done.
,YohYohY,2012-06-11T17:03Z,"thanks for this but bit confused, wiki says ep 1 was a 2 hours..so have you made the first 'file' 3 hrs? first 2 hour pilot ep the the 2nd ep? thanks and apologies for being slow... "
