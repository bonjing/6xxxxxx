This is what came up when I tried to play it - 

You may need an additional audio decoder to play the soundtrack of this file.
This file contains a track in the Dolby AC3 Audio (code ""8192"") format. You may need to install a DirectShow decoder for this audio format in order to hear the soundtrack of this file.

I'm really not sure what to do now, any suggestions?"

For AC3 DirectShow decoder (code 8192) FOR MAC go to-

Perian claims to be a Quicktime Component but it DOES work with Divx.

I've been advised that this works for Windows-
