,t2ngom1ke,2011-06-24T01:58Z,"Okay Bloodlust Zombies which was supposed to be Alexis Texas's ticket to the mainstream, but actually this movie is hardly mainstream. I'd say this movie was more of a B-Rated movie than anything. 

Anyways the only best scenes are probably with Alexis Texas .. that is when she is naked.. and I guess when she is trying to act as well.

The other cast members are horrible, and the budget for this movie must have been 10 cents.

I don't discredit Alexis Texas's talent, due to the horrid script and terrible special effects.. or the lack of it.
