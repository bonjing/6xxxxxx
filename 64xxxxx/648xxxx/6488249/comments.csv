,Null11,2011-06-23T00:44Z,"@Doc.Strange
You have to wait at least an hour before complaining there are no seeds, people have to get it before they can seed as it turns out.

Unless your just encouraging people to seed after dl, then I retract."
,TheBoyka,2011-06-23T00:50Z,"extremezone i dont know have you read mi comments but please upload Thor God of Thunder and Green Lantern movie if you can please..

I'm not a newbie to this.  I been on it for years.  I know common sense says look for a skull and cross bones first read the comments second.... every time...no matter who the uploader is!!  But i gotta say...when it comes to any game uploaded by SKIDROW, EXTREMEZONE, or RAZOR1911...thoes are the only ones I trust 100%.  I don't even bother with the comments on their torrents.  I have been downloading from them for years and i have never had a problem with anything from them.  please keep up the good work and if there is anyway i could help out just let me know.
