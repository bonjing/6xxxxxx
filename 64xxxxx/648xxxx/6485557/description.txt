The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.


Today's offering: DC from Chain Gang War, to Crimson Avenger

No time for cover collages today

The range is appropriate as I imagine a chain gang war could produce a lot of crimson folks who might want revenge. (ahem)

     As usual I have everything of DC that has been scanned, and some Pre and or Post DC comics for characters or series DC has published which have also been published by others. 

     I've got some Humanoids graphic novel translations that DC did not distribute on the theory that they might have if the joint venture had succeeded, and that if you like some you might like others.

    The CMX Manga in this range is not all scanned or at least I could not find all volumes, so I have scanlations as substitutes for some volumes. Not all the translated manga series DC published were complete. When DC stopped doing CMX, some were in progress. I will always include scanlations or other publishers translations of volumes beyond DC-CMX if I can find them. 
     I put in a  bunch of Adam Hughes art collections to make up for the unscanned DC published collection I substituted original 2000AD issues for the Indigo story DC published but which is not scanned in that form.  I have a few  alternate takes on Cinderella to go with the Vertigo (ugghh!)Â® re-imagining of that character. A couple of old Red Circle issues of The Comet, We have Crack Comics which was published by Quality. Some of the characters i those comics became DC character, at least once or twice. One, "The Clock" got no more than a passing mention that he was dead, but others have actually been used. Poor Clock, his time ran out. He had looked forward to retirement to unwind, but it was not to be.  It was his time to go. He stopped. The bell tolled for him. He had been such a handy guy too. I was always glad to see his face. He could be a bit of an alarmist though. And of course employers were not too pleased with staff who watched him all the time. Never slow, never fast, he was always on hand at the right moment. Some people said he was wound too tight, maybe at times he was, but so many people ran their lives by what he said, it's understandable.  He always had a spring in his step. Now he'll never ring me up again. I guess I won't miss that.
