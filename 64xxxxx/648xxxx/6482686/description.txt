History

The modern lyrics were written by Emili Guanyavents, who won a polemic competition on 1899. The music was composed by Francesc AliÃ³ in 1892. The song is based on the events of 1640 known as Corpus de Sang, the event that started the Catalan Revolt or Guerra dels Segadors (Reapers' War) where Catalans fought against the Count-Duke of Olivares, the chief minister of King Philip IV of Spain.
The Catalan government adopted "Els Segadors" as the anthem of Catalonia in 1993.
