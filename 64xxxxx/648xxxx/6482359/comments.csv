,yerisan710,2011-06-21T06:00Z,"La producciÃ³n de la segunda temporada de la serie de HBO 'Juego de tronos' (Game of Thrones), asÃ­ como el rodaje, comenzarÃ¡ el lunes, 25 de julio de 2011, justo un aÃ±o depuÃ©s de que comenzase la producciÃ³n de la temporada 1. SerÃ¡ de nuevo en Belfast, al norte de Irlanda, en el Paint Hall Studio, y en numerosos lugares del norte de Irlanda donde grabarÃ¡n exteriores.

Una temporada 2 que al igual que la primera estÃ¡ previsto que tenga diez episodios y se estrene en abril de 2012. Richard Plepler, de HBO, ha acalarado que la intenciÃ³n del canal es lanzar la serie en la misma fecha que la temporada anterior, un aÃ±o despuÃ©s.

De momento no hay mÃ¡s datos sobre posibles fichajes adicionales para el bloque que rueda la serie, aunque el grueso del elenco y el equipo que han trabajado en la primera temporada estarÃ¡ en la segunda. "

,nittany,2011-07-02T05:51Z,"Why do people still burn stuff to CD/DVD's....just get a WD TV Live player and then put all your media on an external hard drive and plug it in....and done, you can play everything.

Once you download a bunch of movies/TV shows then it's time to move on to a Unraid server that can protect all of your data and serve it up to your devices."

Oh, wait, you won't.  I'm getting a > 200 you cunts, so if you have a bad connection, switch providers.

And for the HBO bitches above.  Tough luck.  I get all your shit over Dish Network for free anyway so don't complain.  And yes, their receivers are cracked for any previous satellite pirate."
,Zoraster,2012-04-10T01:53Z,"nuborn13 is another HBO guy.  It's amazing how many the movie industry sends to piratebay.  For those complaining about the download, stop bitching!!!  150 - 250 KB/sec is the norm, so don't complain.  I'm uploading at 30 KB/sec cuz I have stupid roommates.  Once their stupid asses go to sleep, I up at 80 (max I can go)."

,Lionsault,2012-04-27T22:44Z,"Guys, be careful - HBO is tracking this file and reported me to my ISP. 

So stupid, I have HBO Go. I just wanted the files on my computer so I don't have to go on the internet every time to watch."

,cloudsora,2012-05-04T00:08Z,"So i was a little worried after I had read the msgs about HBO watching the torrent... Not even a day has passed since I did and I already have a letter in the mail...
I recommend you either don't or do it super carefully."

You're so full of shit you corporate cunt. I can find images just like that everywhere on the net. Not to mention that absolutely no self respecting pirate is going to promote any bullshit software like you're trying to do.

Spotting these corporate faggots is easier than playing Spot the Fed at Defcon."
