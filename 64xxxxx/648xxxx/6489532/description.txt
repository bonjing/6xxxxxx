Despite the many improvements in Windows over the years, one feature hasnâ€™t improved
a bit: Microsoftâ€™s documentation. In fact, Windows 7 comes with no printed
user guide at all. To learn about the thousands of pieces of software that make up this
operating system, youâ€™re expected to read the online help screens.
Unfortunately, as youâ€™ll quickly discover, these help screens are tersely written, offer
very little technical depth, and lack examples. You canâ€™t even mark your place,
underline, or read them in the bathroom. Some of the help screens are actually on
Microsoftâ€™s Web site; you canâ€™t see them without an Internet connection. Too bad if
youâ€™re on a plane somewhere with your laptop.
The purpose of this book, then, is to serve as the manual that should have accompanied
Windows. In these pages, youâ€™ll find step-by-step instructions for using almost
every Windows feature, including those you may not even have understood, let alone
mastered.
