Ez all, dunno if you guys ever saw me knocking about in the past, but I have done a new mix. Kinda marks my return to hardcore, use to hold a decent residency and played a lot of hardcore. Found some good new tunes so bosched something together. Unplanned and first recording, which is a change for me. 

Bit tongue in cheek the title, but basically I did a hardcore mix, plenty of new tunes, lots of breakbeats, hopefully not too much gash
