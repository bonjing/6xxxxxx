,candycanegl,2011-06-22T17:58Z,sceneline is never fake dipshit.. you are probably just some 12 year old who doesn't know how to unpack a RAR.
,robidew,2011-06-22T21:12Z,Thank you for packing this into little rar files so i can download it on my dial-up connection from the 1990s
,shawny23,2011-06-24T23:22Z,"Thanks for the upload!!

@azper: candycandl is right, you are a dipshit! Worse, you are a liar. 

@rodidew: You are also a dipshit. Your sarcastic comment betrays your ignorance.  But maybe the apple doesn't fall far from the tree; Last night, after penetrating your crack whore mother with various household objects she voice a similar sarcastic remark: ""Thanks paying with this white powder like it's 1990; this doesn't even work in my crack pipe!"""
,robidew,2011-06-29T07:41Z,"@shawny23: Explain to me then why in 2011 we are still 'raring' these files.
Also; How's this for irony: Using a 'yo momma' to burn my mocking of the 90's"
