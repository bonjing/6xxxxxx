This is a work that provides the skills necessary to become true experts in the technical support and service of computers. It is intended for fans who want to start their own business from scratch, as well as to those that are running and want to professionalize their activity.

In each chapter full photographic cutting each of the components, with full-color computer graphics to explain in detail its operation. It also explains visually and practice the steps for the install of each component and the methodology to carry out diagnosis and repair of most frequent failures.

While a collection and cataloged in detail each of the 4 disc, eh instructional information needed for each task, procedures and video interactive visual guides for each component and hundreds of software ready to install and use, besides that all this collection is entirely in Spanish."
