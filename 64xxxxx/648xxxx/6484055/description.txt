They don't have a lot out yet, but they have a couple of releases tricky to find.
The most complete Saving Abel torrent. As with all my others music torrents, 500x500 art, 100% complete/accurate ID3's.

Studio Albums
1. Saving Abel (2006)*
2. Saving Abel
3. Miss America

EP
4. 18 Days [Tour Edition]**

*Thier 1st self-titled, self release of the same name as the major label debut, it is not the same, and has earlier versions of tracks on the 2008 release, and original songs that were not part of the 2008 release.

**Contains 8 tracks

Please Seed, the 1st release, and full EP aren't common in torrents!

Enjoy!
