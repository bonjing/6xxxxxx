|   The times for Tim Burton would never be better, with the immense success   |
|   of Batman proving his financial viability and a sequel on the way to       |
|   continue building upon that reputation. It would be the satirical          |
|   tragedies of Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas that   |
|   would earn the director his most ardent fans, however. The social          |
|   commentary of Edward Scissorhands speaks to the heart of any outcast,      |
|   offering a stark glimpse of Vincent Price's final, suffering creation of   |
|   horror thrust upon a "perfect" vision of 1950's suburbia. The fairy tale   |
|   genre would serve both Burton and collaborating composer Danny Elfman      |
|   well, with the storytelling structure of both Edward Scissorhands and      |
|   The Nightmare Before Christmas allowing for extremely tight parameters     |
|   that help the scores for both films tell the stories by themselves. For    |
|   Elfman specifically, Edward Scissorhands further heightened expectations   |
|   for the young, classically untrained composer. The score remains a         |
|   powerful juggernaut in album sales charts two decades later, though its    |
|   success remains slightly bittersweet in that time would unfortunately      |
|   reveal that the successive triumphs of Batman and Edward Scissorhands      |
|   would not be equaled by the composer in any of those following years.      |
|   Incidentally, both would feature the orchestration work of Steve Bartek    |
|   and the conducting of Shirley Walker, though the latter score would be     |
|   recorded in Los Angeles rather than London. While Batman appeals           |
|   appropriately to the classically oriented mainstream action collectors,    |
|   Edward Scissorhands reaches towards fans of Elfman's very specific early   |
|   styles of unconventional rhythms and unashamed harmony. The score is       |
|   somewhat of an enigma, combining those two key elements of Elfman's        |
|   early styles and packaging them into one very serviceable score and        |
|   album. Edward Scissorhands is one of Elfman's few scores (if not the       |
|   only completely effective one) that balances the best of both the zany     |
|   quirkiness of his early scores and the thematic enchantment of those       |
|   that would follow.                                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   The most remarkable aspect of the Edward Scissorhands score is its         |
|   ability to tell Burton's story without the visuals. The album takes you    |
|   on the journey of this fable with masterful precision, embodying the       |
|   heart-wrenching emotions of Edward's discovery and downfall with           |
|   thematic and choral elements never restrained. In terms of the             |
|   orchestral ensemble, not much is different from Elfman's previous          |
|   scores, though a significant role is given to the celesta and other        |
|   high-ranging struck percussion. The celesta specifically offers dual       |
|   representation of both the innocence of the main character and the         |
|   wintry setting, lending a music-box style to the score that accentuates    |
|   the bedtime storytelling ambience. The piano, while an integral role of    |
|   other Elfman scores at the time, is largely displaced by the celesta,      |
|   though a few notable piano solos are registered. The harp returns from     |
|   Batman, leaving behind its grand flourishes for deliberate plucking        |
|   that, along with the strings, helps the celesta set the score's delicate   |
|   rhythms. Rowdy rhythms for brass and bass woodwinds explode in "The        |
|   Cookie Factory," serving as the score's only true direct reminder of the   |
|   sharp wackiness of Pee Wee and Beetlejuice. Few brass solos have an        |
|   impact on the score, though the longing trumpet performance at the end     |
|   of the title theme performance in "The End" (among other instrumental      |
|   techniques heard in that cue) would largely foreshadow the upcoming        |
|   spirit of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The true heart of Edward         |
|   Scissorhands, though, is provided by the boy's chorus that brilliantly     |
|   carries the imaginative elements of story and is rarely absent for         |
|   longer than a minute or two in the score. It was not unusual for Elfman    |
|   to employ a boy's chorus in his scores of the time, but the performances   |
|   by the Paulist Choristers of California for Edward Scissorhands are        |
|   incorporated with skill not heard elsewhere in any score of the 1990's     |
|   (by Elfman or otherwise). Elfman layers the group, allowing portions to    |
|   serve as counterpoint to itself in an effort to maximize the harmonic      |
|   resonance of the combined voices. An adult choir is also worked into the   |
|   score at times, though the boys' performances clearly define the work.     |
|                                                                              |
|   Elfman uses the combination of the chorus, celesta, and strings to         |
|   explore two primary themes in Edward Scissorhands. The first is the        |
|   obvious title theme provided in the credits. An overarching idea for       |
|   Edward's journey, this light waltz swings with elegance over celesta and   |
|   plucked strings as the chorus provides the primary wordless statements     |
|   of fantasy (bracketing a woodwind interlude that would serve as a sub-     |
|   theme later in the score). This cue would be fully reprised with the       |
|   same instrumentation in "Etiquette Lesson" and "The End," with             |
|   continuing, fragmented references in between. Despite the appeal of this   |
|   theme, however, it takes a back seat to the score's unofficial love        |
|   theme, which creates the undeniable tragedy in the score. It is this       |
|   theme that graces the score's two famous tracks, "Ice Dance" and "The      |
|   Grand Finale," and presents the chorus in its most beautiful, yearning     |
|   performances. Elfman teases you with this theme in "Storytime" and "Home   |
|   Sweet Home," and he never allows the theme to come to a natural            |
|   conclusion outside of the slowly fading departure in "The Grand Finale."   |
|   In the aforementioned early cues, as well as "Ice Dance" and "The End,"    |
|   Elfman always ends the theme (and cue) on a longing note, never            |
|   returning to its grounding key and thus drawing out the score's tragic     |
|   intent even further. The climactic choral majesty of "The Grand Finale"    |
|   is a dazzling, magical experience, and stands among the most powerful      |
|   single cues of the digital era of film music. The score's darker side,     |
|   dominating its second half, strikes the culture clash at the heart of      |
|   the film's dark edge. Elfman utilizes medium drums and lighter "la-la"     |
|   vocals to underline the pleasantly sickening nature of the somewhat        |
|   timeless 1950's suburbia setting. The world of the "Castle on the Hill,"   |
|   in opposition to the silliness of suburbia, is the menacing and            |
|   ultimately tragically frustrating core of Edward's upbringing and          |
|   seclusion. Several of the more horrifying moments of the tale, heard in    |
|   "Death!" and "The Tide Turns," recall troublesome ideas established by     |
|   Elfman in the just previous Nightbreed. These cues are hardly weak, but    |
|   in contrast to the surrounding beauty, they merit far less attention.      |
|                                                                              |
|   Like many of Elfman's earlier works, Edward Scissorhands has a few         |
|   stand-out tracks of sheer wizardry or bizarre deviation that deserve       |
|   specific mention. You can always tell when Elfman gets in a mood for       |
|   ambitious fun when he pulls out the tubas for a wild rhythm; that          |
|   rhythm, along with the harshly muted brass of "The Cookie Factory,"        |
|   would yield to a few playful performances by woodwinds in that cue that    |
|   would also foreshadow The Nightmare Before Christmas. The piano-led        |
|   rhythm in "Ballet de Suburbia" allows the sax to lead a motif that, once   |
|   the percussion lets rip later in the cue, would mirror much of the         |
|   spirit of Elfman's famous theme for The Simpsons. A solo accordion in      |
|   "Esmeralda" is a bizarre but short deviation. The most colorful cue is     |
|   "Edwardo the Barber," and for those who grow tired of the score's          |
|   overbearing choral performances of the two primary themes, this cue is a   |
|   constant pleasure. A mock-tango rhythm with castenets underscores          |
|   Edward's hairstyling talents, mutating the suburbia motif for perhaps      |
|   the score's most relaxed moment. In the middle of this cue, however, is    |
|   a hoedown style explosion for about a minute that actively underscores     |
|   Edward's most frenetic styling sequence. During this minute, plucked       |
|   strings and accordion establish an increasingly frantic pacing over        |
|   which a solo violin works wonders with its precise western-style           |
|   slurring. If the comically melodramatic conclusion to this sudden burst    |
|   of energy can't invigorate you, then you're not a true Elfman fan. The     |
|   Tom Jones song is an unfortunately downside to the album; his voice and    |
|   the style of the song may have been an attempt to mimic the 50's           |
|   atmosphere of the film, but its tinny recording sound is quite             |
|   irritating. Burton and Elfman would have been better served by having a    |
|   sensitive vocalist provide a song version of Elfman's love theme. The      |
|   balance of the mix between chorus and orchestra in Edward Scissorhands     |
|   emphasizes the chorus far more than Batman did, without losing any of      |
|   the orchestral elements in the process. This masterful mixing would be     |
|   lost by the time Batman Returns would yield a flat result. Overall, many   |
|   collectors believe that Danny Elfman, despite a productive career          |
|   hereafter, has never really captured Edward Scissorhands's essence of      |
|   magic ever again. Whether he does or not, this score will forever be       |
|   noted as a grand highlight of both his career and film music of the        |
|   1990's.                                                                    |
