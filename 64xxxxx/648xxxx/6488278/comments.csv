,icebox_z33,2011-06-29T11:21Z,"are movies included? 

can you play online or LAN? please answer ASAP. badly need it."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-06-29T21:08Z,"then run ra or ramd. windows hides the .exe cause it knows what the files are. also run the games as ""admin""

to play c and c online or even just lan you need to create an account. the serial i used to create this is not legit so idk what will happen if u create an account or if it will even allow ya to do so

and yes all movies are included, nothing has been removed."

[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-07-15T08:58Z,"@duh7125 sure u aren't thinking of a different command n conquer? if not then perhaps u haven't built the proper buildings to unl9ock those units? cause this is the full game, with the expansion and the latest patches."
,momnufix,2011-07-15T11:29Z,"fuctupunk what about my problem? i really missed this game, trying to find a proper torrent for 2 weeks now. could it be because of windows 7 or firewall? i tried everything though"

""I can't see menu's or see the movies but I can hear them""

you should see a doctor :D

@uploader
i guess it was a modded game that i was used to play 10 years ago..and btw, have you ever played this game ? cause there isn't any way of getting a10 warthogs or radar jammers in this version. no matter how many type of buildings there are in your base..

nice torrent though, as i said earlier."
,mposta,2011-07-21T11:35Z,@duh7125  It is this version you are talking about. You can get the mod online. Just search for red alert 2 add-ons and it'll bring up a few red alert sites that have it.
,Toribandy,2011-07-22T21:32Z,"Hey.

I have extract the game with winrar  and i tried to run ""ra2.exe"" but then it doesnt work...

Then i tried to play it in windows xp mode and then it didnt work too... 

Then i tried to run it in xp mode and admin mode... but then it comes ""Unable to initalize 'ra2.csf' please reinstall Red Alert.

I got Windows 7 64-bit... please help.

If i get the game to work, i will share it and i will seed in many weeks.

Thanks."
,awhilicious27,2011-07-28T19:17Z,"Finally I've found the solution, follow this guide:

1). Extract the ""Command And Conquer Red Alert 2 (v1.006) + Yuri's Revenge (v1.001).7z""...

2). Open the folder and search for the ""Ra2.exe"" for Red Alert 2 or ""RA2MD.exe"" for Yuri's Revenge. Right-Click the desired .exe file you want to play and click properties. Then choose compatibility mode and run this program in Windows 98.

NOTE: I'm using Windows XP SP3 and it works for me. I'm not sure if this guide works in Windows 7 and Vista..

@FuCtUpPuNk
Thanks for the game...

,Manuki,2011-08-16T00:01Z,I also have the problem of the menus that won't refresh when you browse them
,Manuki,2011-08-16T02:12Z,"Ok the solution is to click on your laptop's battery menu and to check it on ""high performances"" or anything like that."
,oxygens,2011-08-18T10:04Z,"Hello,

The ***FATAL***String Manager failed to initialized properly can be fixed by setting the compatibility cu Win98/Me in the Properties/Compatibility tab on YURI.exe or ra2.exe.

If you experience a slowdown on Vista and Windows 7 and/or you want the game to run at your current screen resolution (yes the game can do that) try this:
