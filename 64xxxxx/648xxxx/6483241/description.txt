    Photoshop for Designers Type Essentials

    Author: Nigel French



    For this installment of Photoshop for Designers, Nigel French

    explains the fundamentals of working with type in Photoshop,

    distinguishing when it is appropriate to set type in Photoshop

    rather than InDesign or Illustrator and what makes Photoshop

    unique for certain type treatments. This course demonstrates

    essential techniques, such as entering and editing text;

    interacting with type layers; and adjusting the color,

    transparency, character and paragraph formatting of type.

    Exercise files are included with the course.
