Scottish folk singer Emily Smith is known as one of the world's leading Celtic singers and her album, "A Different Life," shows that that her reputation is well earned. 

Simply arranged without the frenetic quality of some modern folk music, Smith's album is pleasant and peaceful, marked by beautiful arrangement and flawless vocals. Not only is her music authentically traditional, but in her mid-twenties Smith has the lyrical wherewithal to perform mostly original material. She was named BBC Young Traditional Musician of the Year in 2002 and is the only winner of the USA Songwriting Competition in 2005.
