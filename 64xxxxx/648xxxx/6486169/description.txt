Storyline:


Set in a medieval village that is haunted by a werewolf, a young girl falls for an orphaned woodcutter, much to her family's displeasure. 

Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight) directs a fantasy thriller that puts a haunting twist on the classic fairy tale. For years the villagers of Daggerhorn have maintained an uneasy truce with a werewolf - but the beast changes the stakes by killing the older sister of brave young Valerie (Amanda Seyfried). Promised in marriage to one man but in love with another, Valerie is affected yet again by the creature's bloody actions. When a werewolf hunter warns that the beast takes human form by day and walks among them, panic sets in as the death toll rises. And Valerie learns she has a unique connection to the wolf that inexorably draws them together, making her both suspect . . . and bait. Gary Oldman, Billy Burke, Shiloh Fernandez, Max Irons, Lukas Haas and Julie Christie also star.
