                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Caught in the Crossfire Private Mike McCabe films intense Taliban attacks on 
 2nd Battalion, the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment in 2009 as the platoon 
 comes to terms with new rules of fighting intended to protect civilians. By 
 2010, the Scots Guards are fighting a battle for hearts and minds, and the 
 cameras capture their struggle to teach the Afghan National Police to curb 
 their reckless behaviour. Last in the series.

 Note: FTP's has missing footage from around 52m55s - 53m35s not the first 
 time this has happend is it?
