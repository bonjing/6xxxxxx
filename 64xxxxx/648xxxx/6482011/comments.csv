,muciano,2011-06-20T14:50Z,"Hi MelloYello, Thanks for these great torrents.
I`m from Brazil, and I`m a beginner at H264.
You`ve got great quality and so little packages.
Could you make me a tutorial (codecs, programs you use) and put a link here? Thanx again.
In my opinion Divx and Xvid are old codecs. We have to spread out the H264. "
