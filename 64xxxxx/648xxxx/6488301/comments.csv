Downloading this and your Final Cut Pro X as I speak.
I'm on a slow connection, so it'll take me a while, but I'm already at 14% for this and 10% for FCP X thanks to great seeders!

Just wanna know, can we expect to see the newest Motion coming soon?"
,WENKERBOY,2011-06-23T19:11Z,"NICE! But before I download, any differences with the Final Cut Studio 3 version? Less options?"
,kristie84,2011-06-23T22:31Z,Personally I'm gonna stick with Final Cut Studio 3; the reviews on the App Store haven't been all that positive for Compressor 4.
