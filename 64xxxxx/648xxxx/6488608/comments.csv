,CBP,2011-07-11T21:03Z,"@ wtfdoido

Its not really that hard, just follow the instructions. 

1. Install The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle 2011. Install it where it says in the instructions. Do NOT patch or crack!
2. Install The Sims 3 - Reloaded. Install it where it says in instructions. Yes you have to download the base game over again.
3. Download the superpatcher and run it.
4. Install Generations (the one in the bundle works fine)
5. Crack the game with the NO-CD patch included in the bundle.
6. Play

Atleast thats how I did it. If this is how you did it and its still not working then I dont know.

Good luck! "
,lannibyrd,2011-07-14T04:20Z,"There is no Generations expansion pack included in the bundle so is it alright if we download any one available on TPB?

Also do we apply the cracks found in the The Sims 3 Reloaded and the Generations according to their individual instructions? Or do we just install them and then ONLY use the No-CD patch in the bundle?"
,kool1678,2011-07-14T06:31Z,Does anyone know how/where to install the .sims3package files and worlds like riverview?
,CBP,2011-07-14T14:21Z,"@ lannibyrd

Generations should be included in the bundle torrent, but as a standalone install. Its the Reloaded version.

You need to crack Generations according to its individual instruction after you install the No-CD patch.

@ kool1678

You cant install Sims3Pack files as the launcher does not work properly. 
You can convert them to packages tho using Delphy's Sims 3 Pack Multi-Extracter.

,MichealRein,2011-07-14T18:37Z,"@kool1678
It goes in mods or something, there's a full walkthrough on modthesims.com

I've installed the game and it seems to have gone fine, but uh, where do I run it from?"
,wtfdoido,2011-07-14T18:49Z,"@ CBP - Dude, have you downloaded the same torrent that I did? In my Ultimate Bundle version, I have 3 ISO files, folder with language changer and a folder with no-cd crack. Plus two text files. No Generations included! Also, I did exactly what you said (with 2 different  reloaded versions of Generations) and I always get the error message and later the game craches, without even loading the main menu. 
Lastly, you said to crack the generations individually. But in the versions that I have, I got 1 dll file and 1 exe called TSW, and in Readme it says not to crack the Generations folder, but the base game folder. Doesn't it interfere with the no-cd patch included in the Bundle? And do we still have to use the Sims 3 reloaded crack, or can we just ignore it?"
,MichealRein,2011-07-14T20:32Z,"Never mind, I got it.

I didn't bother with generations, and it didn't  install in an EA folder either, so I might've messed something up.

The game works, though"
,CBP,2011-07-14T23:47Z,"@ wtfdoido

I might be incorrect about the Generations being included, I just cant remember downloading it.

Anyways, you do have to crack the base game bin folder with the Generations crack, if it interferes or not I dont know but thats what I did and it works.

The extra base game gets cracked by the bundle patch as it installs over the base game in the bundle.

I just patched this bundle then but i'd like to know how to add generations to it really.
Even if I have to uninstall and re install everything, I rather do it now than when I played already.

So could someone tell me how they managed to make it work with generations, where they downloaded it and what exactly they patched with what? It is certain that Generations is NOT included in this torrent."
,Cytios,2011-07-17T23:30Z,"Tested without Generations so far, and it works perfectly.

GENERATIONS IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS TORRENT. Right now I'm downloading ""The Sims 3 - Reloaded"" and then I will download ""The Sims 3 Generations-RELOADED"" (the one with most seeds) and try this:

1-Install the bundle in ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\""

2-Install ""The Sims 3 - Reloaded"" in default location.

3-Install the Superpatcher called TS3_1.22.9.0110xx_update.exe from the website in the description.

4-Install ""The Sims 3 Generations-RELOADED""

5-Execute ""The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle NO-CD Patch"" included in the bundle.

It should work that way...I'll let you know as soon as I try it."

,xXLuneXx,2011-07-29T02:52Z,"To all who are having problems with this torrent;
PLEASE READ:

This torrent is the actual and full The Sims 3 game with 7 of the expansions included, everything in this torrent works flawless. 
Please Note: I do however know how to install the 8th expansion The Sims 3 Generations but still not too sure about 9th expansion The Sims 3 Town Life Stuff.


Step-by-Step installation (Including instructions for Generations):

*RECOMMENDED* programs required for download and installation (Skip if you already have them)

- Winrar
- Daemon Tools Lite
- uTorrent

Now that you have the required programs you can finally start! 

1. Download this torrent using uTorrent, once it's done locate the files you've downloaded. Interested in the 8th expansion? Well then, download these torrents here as well;
-The Sims 3 Generations Expansion: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6427325/The_Sims_3_Generations-RELOADED
-The Sims 3 RELOADED (Trust me your going to need this in order to have Generations):
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4901166/The.Sims.3-RELOADED

2. Open Daemon Tools Lite and click Add Device if you haven't already. Now go ahead and click on Add File, and browse for ""TS3UBDVD1"" 

3. ""TS3UBDVD1"" should run automatically and start the installation, if not go to My Computer and the drive with ""TS3UBDVD1"" manually.

4. Follow the on screen instructions for the installation process. Now it should start the installation of The Sims 3 and all the expansions included. 

5. When asked to change to DVD2, go back to Daemon Tools Lite and load up ""TS3UBDVD2"" just like how you loaded the first one. Now you can go back to your The Sims 3 installation and browse for the location of ""TS3UBDVD2"" and click on okay.

6. When it asks for the third disc do the same thing from step number 5. So, load up ""TS3UBDVD3"".

7. When the installation bar for The Sims 3 is full, the Language Changer program will pop-up. Now choose your desired language, click OK, and close the Language Changer application. 

8. Now install ""The Sims 3 - RELOADED"". Install it where it in the default location. Installing this will replace the original one you have from The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle 2011

9. Download and run the SuperPatcher: 
http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/175477.page
follow the on-screen instructions.

10. Now install ""The Sims 3 Generations - RELOADED"" follow the on-screen instructions.

11. The installations are now complete! Now all you have to do is crack the game. 

9. The torrent ""The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle 2011"" includes a folder called ""No-CD Cracks"" open it and run ""The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle NO-CD Patch"". Follow the on-screen instructions and let the setup do the rest. 

10. Launch the game and play! If you do not find any visible start-up icon, locate it in either My Programs file in the start-up menu OR My Computer>C-Drive>Program Files(x86)>The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle>The Sims 3.
**NOTE** DO NOT REMOVE THE LAUNCHER APPLICATION FROM THE SIMS 3 ULTIMATE BUNDLE FOLDER IN YOUR C-DRIVE, OR THE GAME WILL NOT WORK. 

...WHEW... x_x''"

And all of you having issues installing if you just read the instructions it will work fine."
,MasterBattousai,2011-08-01T00:00Z,"This works perfectly with no errors or game crashes thanks again BONE! 

Just follow XxLunexX instructions IN ORDER! and the game will work along with all the expansion packs including generations. If you followed all instructions in order and still have errors or game crashes its because of the following:

1. Your PC sucks balls and cannot run the Sims, remember that even if you follow all instructions and your computer doesn't at least meet the minimum requirements to play the game you will get errors and or game crashes etc...

2. You did not crack the right way and all you newbs remember to always add any and all cracks and patch's that come with the expansions to the base Sims3 game for example C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin...not to for example C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle\The Sims 3 Ambitions\Game\Bin...and remember to click on the patch or crack and right click copy then right click paste on any blank/white/area in the base Sims3 bin folder not drag n drop method.

3. Another thing you can try if it doesn't work is to make sure that whatever ANTIVIRUS AND FIREWALL YOU USE IS NOT BLOCKING THE PATCH,CRACK,ETC..

Also PowerISO sucks and will give you errors your better of with DaemonToolsLite. Hope this helped some people and leave me questions im newb friendly(^_^)"

I seem to have forgotten to mention that you must place the crack found in the Sims 3 disc and copy,paste, and overwrite it into your *Sims 3, bin folder found in the destination program files/ electronic arts/game. 

*The crack MUST be in the Sims 3 folder not Generations etc...

Hope this helps! (: "

,coneyaw,2011-09-01T11:18Z,"Am I SOL if I want the patches for anything but base game and Generations? I mean it was difficult enough to get Generations to work with this, but from my novice opinion, it looks impossible to patch anything from Ep01 - Sp02 (World adventures through outdoor living)"
,Jessi_Minaj,2011-09-07T00:52Z,"WTF?  I mounted the image for DVD1 and nothing happened.  Clicking on my Deamon Tools icon now does nothing.  Furthermore, step 2 says to run ""Setup.exe"" but there is no ""setup.exe"" in this download!  I've done this before on previous computers but I can't figure this out!"
,Jessi_Minaj,2011-09-07T01:07Z,Ignore last comment... had to renistall my DaemonTools.  Now installing this bundle and hopeful that it will work!
,_UndeadlyVamp,2011-09-13T18:35Z,Installed without any problems at all. Seeding :)
,melloorr,2011-09-30T19:39Z,Would I be able to install Town Life Stuff with this? I have all of the other add ons except for that one.

,h-cat,2011-12-06T11:48Z,"so Can I access all the sims games(late night,ambitions,world adventures etc...) from one single sims 3 game?Or do I get to play different ones using different sims players on different EXE files ?

,bakagaijin79,2011-12-15T03:35Z,"I dl'd this one, took me a while but worth it. I haven't had any problems with it, sweet game!

Thanks in advance, killer upload BONE"

,Mazphrael,2012-01-10T08:49Z,"Hi guys, when I start installing the game, a few seconds in I get the error ""\Sunset Valley.objectCache

An error has occured:
The source file is corrupted""

and the options of abort, retry and ignore.

I tried retrying several times and it just gets stuck in the same place and if I hit ignore the installer freezes.

Is there any way to fix this short of redownloading the entire torrent?"
,brentjk1,2012-01-12T00:47Z,"No matter what I do, I cannot get this to work. It always says 1 of 2 things

1)Software not updated, update via launcher. When I go to do that, it says expansion not found and game not found.

2)If I can even get it to eventually jive, it tells me disc authentication error and kicks me out. 

What am I doing wrong??! I download this, run it via magic iso and then run the crack no? Even if I install the super patcher in the middle I mess up.

Can someone please tell me what step I am missing? I'm not worried about installing future expansions..."

,Joey_Roddy,2012-04-29T00:50Z,"To everyone who has been having problems downloading exchange items for  THE SIMS 3, go to

http://www.simprograms.com/the-sims/the-sims-3/the-sims-3-programs/programs-the-sims-3-package-editors/

Scroll down the page and download

TS3 Install Helper Monkey which will install package files when you double click on them.

and download TSR Launcher which will install Sim3PACK files into the game.

With these two programs, you can install items into the game without the EA launcher."
,Joey_Roddy,2012-04-29T00:52Z,I've tried it and it worked for me. I hope none of you have any problems as well.
,GamerFR,2012-05-05T19:26Z,"Hi ! Nice torrent ! I downloaded it long time ago and it works great. But I wonder if I can install Pets and Showtime, and how ! Can someone help me ?"
,gumbear,2012-05-10T06:30Z,"GamerFR 

To install pets and showtime you have to uninstall the Ultimate bundle and start all over

First you install the ultimate bundle normally but DO NOT run the ultimate bundle no-cd Patch.exe.

Then you have to install the sims 3 base game. Doesn't have to be a reloaded file any one.

After that you have to install and run the super patcher. Witch will basically get your game up to date. Can be found here... http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/175477.page

And then you install what ever expansions you want but dont crack just yet

When cracking the game, you always go with the  latest game to date. So if your getting pets and showtime you don't crack for both. You just use the showtime crack provided with the torrent you downloaded. 

These instructions are verry brief so if you need any further help just let me know and I'll do my best to help.

Oh and by the way, Generations and master suite stuff are awesome add-on's to the game! :P"
