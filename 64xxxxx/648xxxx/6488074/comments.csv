,tatuDowns,2011-06-25T16:06Z,"@xdarkstar2 This might be because the text file inside it is '0' kilobytes. Are you sure you downloaded that folder? Have you ticked it when you had to choose what you want to download from the torrent? 
Download that folder again.

If it doesn't work, simply create a folder titled 'en-us' then put a text file called 'readme' in it. That should do. 
Hope this helps."
