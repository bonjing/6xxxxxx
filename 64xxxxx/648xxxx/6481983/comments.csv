[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-20T10:40Z,False Positive since its Precracked. I suggest you switch to Eset Smart Security. I have PLAYED the game and I enjoyed it :)
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-20T11:06Z,"Avast Antivirus gives a lot of false positives. The best anivirus and the lightest one that I have ever seen is Eset.  

Remove the horrible Avast AV and download my Eset 5 Smart Security torrent, apply the trial lock and you're set to go!!!"
