,makohk,2011-08-14T17:56Z,"Where is the difference between 700 Mb and this 3.93 Gb copy, because in www.ubuntu.com the release is 700 MB. "
,akshat01,2011-08-21T19:42Z,"@makohk :The 700 Mb image on the official page is an installable live CD. This seem to be the ""full install"" DVD with additional applications and all languages."
