,pxpierre,2011-06-21T09:32Z,"Thanks eztv & seeders.

It's like Afganistan today except the Americans are replaced by aliens and the Talibans are replaced by American undisciplined militia. A really shitty show. :(

Soap opera with guns."

,mikelfann,2011-06-22T09:39Z,thankyou!
,shayweis,2011-06-22T18:01Z,"thanks for the upload! this show is not going to last. better show then this has been canceled such as the event, and worst, SGU which was the best show in the Stargate saga. the aliens look stupid and the characters are not very intresting. so dont get too attach cause you can count on the network to cancel it before it goes anywhere"
,LukeScooto,2011-06-24T03:49Z,"Sadly enough, and as much as it pains me to agree, it is a poorly produced show, and the acting is even worse. Its not going to last, and usually if a show has good ratings past 13 episodes, thats when they start talking money, and renewing the show and so on. I highly doubt this will make it past the 13 shows, on TNT anyways. I know they already shot the 13, because you can read about it in different blogs, and they've showed some critics all 13 already, which they shouldnt have, because the critics shit all over it. I think it iwll make it to around 10 episodes, have very poor ratings, even for cable tv, and get sold off to a lesser network, MAYBE Sci-fi, where it will play out its 13 episodes, over and over and over. Sci-fi is way too cheap to pay noah willey and the rest of the cast to make new fresh episodes, and by no means could they ever afford Spileburg and Dreamworks. I know Spielburg is only exectutive producer on this, but come on, he needs to do better if his stamp is going to be on this pile of warm dog poo. Go watch the episode of The Totally Rad Show where they reviewed this show, they hit it spot on, the actors arent engaging enough, not enough of them anyways. The special effects are weak, and the plot line is weaker and predictable. The guy above said it BEST, its a Soap Opera with guns, lol."
,adventurjunky,2011-06-25T21:02Z,"God damn it your right,the aliens look like shit.
No one can come up with something better than district 9`s prawn it`s just impossible."
,majinbuxl,2011-06-26T18:09Z,meh I've watched an episode and its sort of interesting. Not sure if it'll go past season 1

,Mo_money1716,2011-06-30T04:08Z,"@$3! all the idiots using the comments for a movie go on IMDB or Roten Tomatoes and puff hot air till ur hearts content. 

Wanna to be helpful? .....Comment about the Quality of the AUDIO and VIDEO!

Anybody viewing the torrent has already decided to download it FFS!"
,Reviewer,2011-06-30T15:34Z,"Mo_money1716

everyone knows the quality will be 10/10 because it's eztv you dumb fuck, most trusted uploader since axxo. And people along with myself will continue to review the torrents because believe it or not people actually do read them because it comes from peers who have similar interest. I have stopped plenty of downloads because of bad reviews from other pirates. So kindly fuck off."

As far s the series goes.... seems like the writers of this series clocked-in, got paid... clocked-out! Not sure why the networks allow such poor production to be viewed. Maybe a good thought by some, but a huge disappointment for many.   Your typical aliens vs humans series. "
