RELEASE NOTES

When it comes to putting in work, Lil' C does the damn thing. Hustling
as hard as the day is long, Texas' own rapper slash hustler Lil' C has
been grinding hard on the MixUnit scene for some 3 years or so solid.
Dropping a slew of Texas-centric compilations sprinkled with Lil' C
exclusives as well as full-length solo mixtape projects, C has been
gettin' his name out the good ol' straight-out-the-trunk way, putting in
that work in mom & pops all over Texas and wherever they f$%k with that
Trill sh*t.

With this new release Lil' C takes his mantra literally and went in the
lab for a couple good months and came out that bitch with this brand new
solo mixtape, featuring all new and original material from the king of
the Keep On Stackin' regime. C cranks this new mixtape out with features
and verses from Z-Ro, Killa Kyleon, Fat Pat, J-Dawg, Young Capo and
more.
