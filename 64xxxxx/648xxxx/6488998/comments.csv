,Keithuk,2011-09-15T02:55Z,"Ok if this is supposed to be 6.0.11 how come after you have installed and restarted you go into Maintenance and click on Update it shows the installed version as 5.0.5?

Yes if you click on Update program it installs the lastest version 6.0.1289.

I've used the cracked Avast for a couple of years now but the license will run out in May next year so with this one we are good until 2038.

There are 2 serials for this version and they are both the same. Avast don't list a 6.0.11 its 6.0.1125

,estudyante_blues,2011-10-24T23:54Z,"Had a difficulty trying to insert the license key and install this one cause i have an existing Avast installed in my computer. So for beginners here's the step by step process how to install & make it work:

1. Uninstall your  existing Anti Virus product
2. Restart your computer
3. Do not connect to the internet
4. Install Avast.exe
5. Open Avast
6. Go to Maintenance/Registration
7. Find Offline Registration (If you can't find it just drag it down cause its in the extreme lower part of the screen)
8. Click on Insert The License Key
9. Copy the License Key in the license key notepad (AntiVirus 6.0.11 - C2092...)
10. Paste it and click OK.

You should be getting a confirmation and make sure that your Avast will expire on 2038. Thats it! Again this is for beginners and those having difficulty in making this generous entry. Thanks RedDr4gon."
,Levitate666,2011-11-01T02:41Z,"Works well for me atleast. Haven't seen it update yet but I've only had it installed for 6 min so I can't really say. My Avast window says; Free avast, but when I click on registration it says; 6.0.1289, registered until: 2038. I think it works.

I would recommend this for all who want a good virus protection. It's smooth and doesn't take up much power from the comp.

Thanks RedDragon!"

I successfully installed the antivirus, and when done so, expiration date was until 2038. However, after clicking on update program it updated from version 5.05 to 6.0.137 but the expiration date changed to 2012. was that suppose to happen?? Should i do it again so the expiration date goes back to 2038? Thank you ."
,Sploder,2011-12-29T06:08Z,"After registering it still says Avast free edition at the top, also its version 5.0.594 not 6.0.11. There really is no point in this torrent, just get it from the avast site."

,blaymoric,2012-01-19T07:07Z,"Works perfect. It may say free at the black border uptop but if you go to Maintenance > Registration it says Expires on: 1/18/2038. Lolwut...Perfectly done, RedDragon, I tip my hat to you."
,F.E.,2012-01-20T08:42Z,"FACT:

1- With Speed Network of 18 Mbps (Low) it downloaded in 2 minutes on ""Utorrent 3.1""

3 - Indeed says expires in ""2038""

4 - Thank You ""RedDr4gon""

4 - Also I would like to give my best regards and appreciations to ""estudyante_blues"" for your ""Beginners Comment"" it completely helped me a lot step by step (Sense I don't know much about programs installations). I recommended you readers to follow.

It is difficult to uninstall but some people (ie arcspark) are to dumb to figure it out so they claim its a virus. it just takes a bit of knowledge.

Click on the ""Maintenance"" tab and you will see a lot of sub-menus, click on ""Registration"" and then you will see a screen that says ""Your registration"" at the top"" and you will see that your current status is ""Unregistered"" and you will also see a green register now button and an upgrade button.

The serial key works and this program doesn't give you problems like how Norton does. If you don't know how to register the program with the serial key provided, then just follow my other comment. Thanks again RedDragon, this is probably the best antivirus software you can get on the web, and don't worry, it is safe to update, it updates itself all the time to protect against the newest threats today! If it updates, it will not unregister itself, this is awesome, now all your important files like business related files and personal files which contain sensitive information like banking details, is all kept safe by this amazing program. Thanks again and you have to download this."

,Hungryghost76,2012-04-08T12:34Z,"Works and updates:
Until recently I have done without virus protection on my aging 512mb RAM 30GB HD laptop as I found that it made it run unusably slow. I thought that the danger from malware was greatly over exaggerated anyway. I've had no problems...until this week when my email account started sending spam to all my contacts. I don't know whether an antivirus program would have protected me or whether it was due to my using the same password with mior variations for everything! Still I figured it was time to rethink.

     Installed this and it hasn't slowed my computer down at all. The offline registration worked fine. At first it said that it was only 5.something and wouldn't update but after I went to uninstall it it said ""version 6.something is already installed"" Then when I rebooted it updated to version 7 the latest! It also updates the virus definitions daily. I am extremely happy with this software. 
     Someone said you can get this free from the website. You can get a basic version but this seems to have more features. Although the title is still the basic one; it seems like you can access paid features.
     All in all a good antivirus package"
