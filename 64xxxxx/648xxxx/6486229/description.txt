Unfortunately this is sourced from the God Sent reissue GSLP 200, rather than the original. Having said that itâ€™s better than the travesty achieved with the Orange Street CD remaster. With that you get a second CD of dubs, which are so bad you should throw the second CD in the bin. If you wish to buy crap here it is http://www.amazon.co.uk/Humanity-Prince-Lincoln-Royal-Rasses/dp/B00005A4CI

Anyway the albumâ€™s a classic, enjoy.

Usual equipment:

Linn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge, via a  Naim 62 pre-amp into Pioneer PDR-609 CDR, using TDK audio CDR.
