,prashant90001,2011-06-26T11:41Z,"I have a problem...

The trial reset worked ...but i tried to activated the trial license... it is showing that the kaspersky i unable to connect to the server....!!!

Kaspersky definition update is working, the keys are working and also the trial activate option is available but trial license do not get activate as kaspersky is not connecting to the server. so at atlast i activated it through a key.

Is any one having the same issue that i am facing ???

,rohit4,2011-06-28T07:34Z,"I also have the same problem on my Win7 X64.
The trial reset working. But after using trial reset, KIS unable to connect to the activation server, ""Activation Failed"". The activation working again by uninstalling KIS completely then reinstalling."
,prashant90001,2011-06-29T09:54Z,"

,waree,2011-07-22T00:40Z,oops sorry for double post.
,tMrz,2011-07-23T19:37Z,"No waree I had the same problem today too. I think Kaspersky has increased their security measures somehow. Still wondering what it is, may be update issues or something like that? Perhaps a internal date protection?"
,tannerman,2011-07-24T18:17Z,"i just did my 2nd reset 2 days ago and all works perfect here.

it is very important that your reset 1 or 2 days before your subscription ends, if you do it the same day your subscription ends, it wont work.
there is also a ktr2012-1.d trial reset out there.
might wanna try that one - the ppl that cant get this crack to work.
"
,tMrz,2011-07-25T00:45Z,"I have used the similar reset stuff mate, for a long time too, and at any time yet never happened to see that before. I have no idea why my Kaspersky keeps running out of time and giving me no option of activating as trial."
,tannerman,2011-07-25T12:10Z,"mate, you have to follow these steps.

1. disable protection and disable self-defens from settings.
2. EXIT Kaspersky from the tray icon (the icon at the right bottom of the screen)
3. download the trialreset
4. run it as an adminstrator and click the reset button.
5. computer will reboot.
6. when computer starts, it will force you to either put in a serial key or register the trial version. the 2nd option will give you 30 trial days.

i just did it again and it's been working for way over 10 min"
,tannerman,2011-07-25T12:37Z,"nvm. seems like kaspersky finaly managed to take up the fight against piracy.

WARNING: All new trial resets has been blocked by kaspersky."
,tannerman,2011-07-25T12:48Z,"gonna try reinstall with revo uninstaller pro, delete the registry keys and try with the oem key torrent.

all trial resets are now freezing your kaspersky subscription."
,zedahm,2011-08-01T08:52Z,"I would like to inform all people here that nothing is gonna work on KIS/KAV 2012 like trial resetters.


The trial resetters will get expired after 10-20 minutes as KASPERSKY LAB has fixed all kinds of tweaks.


Unfortunately, no fix in sight yet."

,swexpert,2011-08-02T19:15Z,"lol zedahm you lost the battle even before fighting.

The good news is it still works. A bit tedious process though. Patch, activate. Within the 10 min period, Unistall Kaspersky, delete license info also. Reinstall and activate as trial.

Perhaps ""Ganjin"" still left some file unaltered.

BTW i tried on XP 64bit.

Thanks and regards

I did it before your post but it was not working with me i uninstall kis with Rev unistaller. but It expires after one day.

You mean when i active kis. It work for 10 minutes then i uninstall in that period and reinstall it."
,swexpert,2011-08-04T15:21Z,"gabbas, did you delete all information when uninstalling? By default, it keeps activation data and you have to select ""delete everything"" (or something like it, cant remember exact words) when uninstalling.

I cannot comment on this if you used some third party uninstaller, it may not have deleted the updated components as well as the license info. 

Apparently, the Kaspersky updates now update the application components also due to which this issue arises. I am still to find from where we can set ""do not update application components"" which used to be there in earlier versions..like..er..3,5,6,7 etc.

This is for educational information only. Buy your license if you are not actually doing any R&D :-).

Hope this helps
Thanks

,qabbas,2011-08-09T05:13Z,"swexpert 

I tried with third party as well as normal uninstall i have deleted all information as it ask during uninstalling process.

swexpert :----- Is it still working with you? if it is working with you then i am missing some thing and i will manage it. I will give another try. Please write down step by step process that you apply. It may help full for others"
