RELEASE NOTES

The fourth official mixtape from the Pittsburgh's favorite
melanin-deficient son Mac Miller shut down DatPiff, had 20,000+ fans on
the live uStream the night it dropped and has been one of the most
popular mixtapes of 2011 so far. This official release from the
19-year-old Rostrum Records (the same label Wiz Khalifa grew up on) is
the latest in a nice little arsenal of incredibly dope music, featuring
tracks with Wiz Khalifa & Phonte (from Little Brother), plus production
from Just Blaze, Cool Kids' Chuck Inglish, and in-house producer ID
Labs.
