,gary.mumford,2011-06-21T14:26Z,Works great!  But I cant believe there is no DNS server anymore!  And how am I supposed to host multiple domains for the mailserver?  Lion Server has been over simplified and can only be used with one domain.  I'm going to have to stick to Snow Leopard server with full DNS and mail domain alias's... Bummer!
