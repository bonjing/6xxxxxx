,Villeroy,2011-06-23T11:03Z,"Since I can't edit my torrent description for some reason, here are some more release notes:
All files are MP3, obviously of various bitrates. I used sites like Last.fm and RYM to check out which songs are more popular, but sometimes I had to pick less-known tunes which I considered better.
Previously I have done a preliminary version of this compilation, with a somewhat different tracklisting (including, for instance, Baths and Gold Panda, who are hardly chillwave, but were tagged as such somewhere).
Artists I would also recommend, chillwave or almost chillwave: 18 Carat Affair, Sumsun, Teams, Rangers, Monster Rally, Lay Bac, Big Spider's Back, and there are lots more which I don't personally found interesting..."
