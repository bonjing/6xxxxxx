,pjsmoke,2011-06-23T18:58Z,"How about Burn Notice in 720p? I haven't seen the show but I'm a huge Bruce Campbell fan...

Anyway, I know you won't answer but at least I asked before downloading and re-encoding a dvdrip myself eventually."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-23T19:01Z,"Scratch that, Burn Notice season 1-2 are the only seasons available on Bluray...unless you do one of your 720p web rips for the remaining seasons as well?"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-23T19:46Z,"This show was very good. Its not action packed like 24, but it was very well done.

Burn Notice is not planned. That is a bad show!"
,theartpirate,2011-06-24T06:11Z,"Dude I have never even heard of this series but a little research tells me it's awesome! Thanks!

I think you would love to watch Game of Thrones."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-24T06:39Z,Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad are my favorite shows right now. I've also read all the books for GoT.
