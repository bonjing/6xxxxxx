I've been a fan of Pulp for years, and although I enjoy Different Class, His 'n' Hers is my favorite. Gorgeous melodies, with young people experimenting sex being a prevailing theme throughout the album. Every track after Joyriders is superb, the obvious highlights are Babies and Do you remember the first time for first timers, but I bet they won't be your favourite tracks after a few listens. Many songs seems to take your imagination for a ride each time you hear them; it's difficult to put into words, but I know that some people out there will know exactly what I mean. An absolute brilliant classic.
