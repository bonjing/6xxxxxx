The first time I heard ISMFOF was way back in 2005 when they put out ""Crank 'Dat.""  But other than just listening to that one song i never really got into their music.

The first time I smoked marijuana at a live music event was when I was at Warped Tour.  I was sitting down watching ISMFOF, just listening and really enjoyed what I was hearing.  So yeah, I went home and downloaded this album.

It's great and has been on repeat the last week."
