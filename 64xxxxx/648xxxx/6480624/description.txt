All 3 albums from Red Sparowes in great 320kbs quality. Bought them myself from their page, so they're as original as can be.
One member of the band plays/used to play in ISIS. This band plays instrumental post-rock, meaning no vocals at all. Just purely the outstanding, progressive, building-up sound of post-rock, nothing more, nothing less. Please enjoy.
