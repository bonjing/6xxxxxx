Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) is an application development platform for building robust enterprise systems. J2EE includes numerous Java APIs and tools including Enterprise JavaBeans, JavaServer Pages, and Servlets. Developers looking to leverage this complex platform need guidance not only on the features of each tool, but on using them together to create real-world systems.
J2EE Developer's Handbook provides both -- discussing the tools in the context of practical J2EE applications which demonstrate every aspect of J2EE development. In the Spring of 2003, Sun will relase J2EE 1.4 which includes numerous updates and new features such as JSP 2.0, EJB 2.1, and new APIs for creating J2EE Web Services and using the J2EE Connector Architecture.
