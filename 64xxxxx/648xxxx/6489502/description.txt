Rob and Nikki met in the wake of different types of
personal tragedy in December of 2008. Rob was reeling
from the loss of his biggest supporter and
inspiration, his mother, and Nikki was coping with
the exodus of all of her closest friends and loved
ones to the west coast while remaining in Boston to
pursue musical endeavors. Both were toiling away in
the Boston music and comedy scenes, respectively, and
were starting to feel a little weathered. Though they
had crossed paths numerous times before without so
much as a passing greeting, late one night at a party
at New Alliance Studios, they found themselves on the
same old couch seeking respite from the noise and
networking. It all started when Rob asked Nikki, "Why
do you play music?" and the outpouring of emotions
and truth from the two of them that followed. They
spent the next 6 months finding that they were
seeking much the same thing...a return to the
childlike love of music and life, but with undertones
of the pain and realism of both their individual
lives. From beach drives to bowling, personal
philosophy and later to fun-loving videos, they were
fast writing a script that would turn into a
simplistic yet cuttingly honest debut album of 20
songs and 3 bedroom demos within a 2 month time span.
"Did We Happen to Begin?"* the debut album from Super
Time Pilot is the culmination of the collision of two
people burning at an alarming rate and refusing to
fit into any predetermined definitions. With only 2
days to do it in and the help of 4 great friends and
Boston contemporaries, Nate (drums), Kier (guitar),
Adam (bass), and Kevin (sax), it seemed magic had
been on their side. Bouncing from humor to heart to
psychology and back to explosive laughter, Rob and
Nikki sought to lay their insides out on this album
and have a blast doing it. "Did we happen to begin?"
is the question you ask a whirlwind of a person who
unwittingly helps you find your own perspective
again. Here we have two people asking each other the
same question. *Super Time Pilot debut album "Did We
Happen to Begin?" due out in the Fall of 2009, on
Open E Records
