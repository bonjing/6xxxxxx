A lot of trippy, deep, minimal, progressive trance, techno and house.....all mixed beautifully. 
Not my usual style but the deeper minimal music has started to appeal me a lot and mixing these tunes together was definitely an amazing (cheese-free) experience. 
Though there are a few mood swings but overall this mix is very relaxing and is the perfect companion for a nice intoxicating chill-out party or green therapy session.
