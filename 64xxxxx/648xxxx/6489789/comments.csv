[T],iamgreat,2011-06-23T17:00Z,"I have a different user name here than on demonoid but i still love your releases over here too. 

About Murdoch Mysteries, technically err0001's releases would be dupes of the already released episodes from the UK. There are 2 or 3 releases for every episode of s4 of Murdoch from the UK including the complete season in standard 350MB files. 

That said the episode with the prime minister is a different version to be shown in Canada so that would not be a dupe; it makes use of alternate takes with the PM instead of the regular cast member. 

Thank you for XIII. I am not sure why no group picked it up but i am glad that you did. I hope it gets the late renewal that is a rumoured possibility. "
