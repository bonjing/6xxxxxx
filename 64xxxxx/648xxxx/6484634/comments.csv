,Chris_Yaz,2011-06-21T14:05Z,"Can i ask how is this possible in 15 minutes upon it's upload every single one of those keys to be blacklisted ? 

I do appreciate the effort but can someone find a more permanent way (not trial resseting etc) - i mean i've been testing keys the past half hour (approximately 100-120) and nothing works."
,arf110,2011-06-21T14:40Z,kaspersky is gettin better in blacklisting these days:( already 7 keys are BLed
,michaelwilliamson,2011-06-21T15:30Z,@Chris_Yaz.....Yes mate...Buy it.....Saves all the hassle mate

,iMacAppleWindows,2011-06-21T16:07Z,"I have a problem with Kaspersky keys. The keys are always blocked, even if one inserts a new key. Why? After 1-2, it is blocked again. Is this an explanation?
Is there any solution for this?"
,repeat123,2011-06-21T16:16Z,Thanks works perfect!
,mrfilcher,2011-06-21T17:24Z,"hi chattchitto, i downloaded this torrent not long ago and it worked perfectly! however, just today, i got this message from the application:

ATTENTION!

YOUR LICENSE IS BLOCKED.
THE UPDATE FEATURE IS DISABLED SO YOUR COMPUTER CAN BE EXPOSED TO RISK OF INFECTION.

I tried going through the process again of reactivating with a license key, however it denied it, saying that kaspersky has blocked it even though my net connection is plugged through the process.

Any advice on this? thanks!"
,mrfilcher,2011-06-21T17:26Z,"correction,

my net connection was UNPLUGGED, not plugged. hope you have an alternate key or something to fix this problem. thanks!"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-06-21T17:45Z,"Delete the old Key, download these new keys and use them, They are all working at the moment."
,soldierofthelam,2011-06-21T17:58Z,"@BONE
Correction they don't work for 91 days.

after 3 days of using the license

you get 
""ATTENTION!

it is easier to just delete the trail number and reset it."

to restart 30 day process:

got to manage license ""bottom right corner""

delete  license number "" will be a red x to delete trial.""

select activate application

select activate trial version
""""should now say 30 days again.""""



---------------------------------------------------------







turn off your internet connection

got to manage license

delete  license number

go to activate 

click on browse for key file

activate. (but all license keys are blocked)



how exactly do you do that process?

""delete trail key and reset the 30 day trial"" ?"
,soldierofthelam,2011-06-22T17:53Z,"@gamhanan

confirm the 6th license works but after couple of hours you get a message saying blocked license.

[V],ChattChitto,2011-06-23T18:06Z,"Same here, working."
,soldierofthelam,2011-06-23T23:10Z,"@BONE. 
lol,
   theirs only only way of doing it.

if your getting the blocked license code,
    then it worked and they already black flagged the license. or because to many people have used it.
so obviously saying someone didn't install it right is asinine!!!"
[V],.BONE.,2011-06-24T16:38Z,disconnect from the internet then do the key code all 1s with n x on the end

,soldierofthelam,2011-07-04T17:39Z,"@Bone 
Yes your is working.
   Because you used your key before it got used to many times, for most other people it won't work now. 

u can only register each license with so many machines.

most other people will have to wait for CC to release more.

""once again another asinine comment from another uneducated person."""
,riral123,2011-07-14T00:10Z,is this the original antivirus or just the keys???
,wbone,2011-07-19T13:58Z,all licenses blocked now but thanks for the time we did get!
