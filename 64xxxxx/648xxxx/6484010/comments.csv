Thanks in advance.

,Apxika,2011-08-08T03:58Z,"Why don't people ever advertise the quality of the files. At least mention the Kbps. Some of us like our collection of music organized and in high quality. Nevertheless, I appreciate the effort and I will download/seed :)"
,markdeuce22,2011-08-11T00:01Z,good upload but this album is terrible. Its like drake's; they both arrogantly talk about how they've finally made it but never actually make good music
,HiroPro2,2011-10-10T07:10Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V2 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramp is FANTASTIC ripping software!"
