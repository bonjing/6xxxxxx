is at 1H 53min 49 sec and credits take 22 more minutes!

Detailed lengths:
2001.The Fellowship of the Ring (1)  1H 45 min

2002.The Two Towers (1)  1H 46 min

2003.The Return of the King (1)  2H 7min
2003.The Return of the King (2)  1H 53min

The extended DVD releases are split in the same place as the Blu-rays so in case you find 2 CD subs 25 frames (DVD) convert them to 23.976 and will be good for this release more or less with some +/- delay."
[T],-Gabe-,2011-06-20T15:02Z,"Thanks a lot mate!
I waited 2 years to get this version and now its available in less than 30 GB! (the BD is about 200GB).
You did just an usually great job."
,Mimics,2011-06-20T16:21Z,"Best quality around. For those who do not believe just check the other releases and convince yourself.  The speed is not so good. I barely down with 50 kb  but I trullly hope the quality is worth the wait.

I will seed this for a long while

Cheers!"

Can you get Hungarian dub for LOTR as well?

For me English is fine but my wife prefers Hungarian... :)

Thanks"

I'll upload them in a day or two with limited upload speed to avoid quickies, hit & runners. AC3 5.1
Look back here tomorrow evening or after-tomorrow for the link. cheers"
,ndnenigma,2011-06-23T19:37Z,Any chance of elvish only subs for this release? Thanks! Great quality!!!
,ndnenigma,2011-06-23T22:31Z,"Also, just wanted to ask if 5000 kbps is sufficient for relative transparency? I read somewhere that you need at least 7000kbps for a 1080p file, just curious."

,Dragondice,2011-07-08T22:41Z,Is it 2 files for each movie..  
,Porgus,2011-07-12T07:41Z,Great Job! Video and Sound Quality are awesome. I was wondering if you could provide us with the .srt files of the forced subs. I'm having a hell of a time finding any that will fit.
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-13T14:59Z,"Thanks  -Gabe-, Mimics, downaccs, jnptr etc for your appreciation.
I tied to edit forced English but I couldn't. If I could provide them I'd obviously mux them in.

I'd like to hear also from those who download with 2 MB/s only from me so I suppose they finish the torrent in one day.
@primaxka21 ""9,6 kb/s ""? you must be kidding!
I alone upload with 10-15MB/s. And all those Dutch, Swedish, Norwegians etc peers surely seed generously too.
Run fewer torrent at one time with more conections.
@Dragondice thx for letting us know."
,handsolo7,2011-07-15T04:28Z,"mkvonly,

I'm loving the quality of your torrents man! Many thanks for all of your hard work! This (and all of your movies) play flawlessly fully on my BoxeeBox. Please keep up the great work! :)

Peace

,foffster,2011-07-16T23:57Z,Is this really the extended version? 
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-17T13:10Z,"@foffster
Sorry I wasn't more clear,
each episode has about 22 minutes long credits (after the end of the movie).
I removed them, not exactly at the point when it finishes  so I left some extra seconds till shows the director's name and main actors and the song ends and begin a new song, so it is not uncomfortable.
See my second comment. About 2.7 GB saved together with the French dub cuts.
So you can call it extended [mkvonly] cut ;-)
Who wants the credits read them at imdb and the music is in the torrent. 
Thx for asking, I admit I should have made it more clear. Cheers"
,Zacno1,2011-07-18T20:29Z,"Got a problem here when muxing the files 2002.The Two Towers (1).mkv and 2002.The Two Towers (2).mkv together. I used these two wersions of mkverge: MKVMerge 4.0.0-MKVExtractG and MKVMerge 4.9.1-MKVExtractG

So the problem is when i muxe these two files together i get a grey video(no video, just audio) when the second part begins and till the end...I managed to combine other four parts together with no probs, just these two giving me the trouble. 

Could someone tell me what im doing wrong...:)"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-19T17:30Z,"@Zacno1
Don't merge them together. They are two different encodes for God's sake. Why make a 3H 30 min form it?
Curious how some people split a 1H 40min movie in two while others want to merge 2 x 1H 45min movies in one.
I'm sure the tool (mkvmerge) showed you a message saying they don't take responsibility for the result. Leave them separate as they are. Safer and easier play back."
,Zacno1,2011-07-20T07:42Z,"@mkvonly

I know that, but i only run movies in one piece and adding some subs that are for 1file not 2. Y i got warrning, but still i managed to get other four parts together just this one is givving me the error, thats why i asked if there is some workaraund...

Now u tell me that u used different encodings on 2nd part of the trilogy :S. So i can't merge them together as i did before with other parts..."
,Zacno1,2011-07-20T07:43Z,I forgot to say thanks for this one ;)

thumbs up!"

Apreciate the Portuguese subs and sound in your realeases."
,JohnPogs,2011-11-24T03:29Z,OMG mkvonly is our NEW hero right now. Seriously Im a nitpick myself or might say I'm a videophile but mkvonly's BR rip are just way too superb than the others. I mean the size is too small as well as the bitrate but its just awesomely great. I just downloaded the LOTR Trilogy and its just mindblowing for the size. I even compare my neighborhood's original copy and this one its just so close to notice man. Now his star wars complete sage my new project Im still waiting to finish thats why if you are those people who are in need a star wars BR rip copy then dont think twice to download it because it is very recommendable. Now lets seed this torrent and damn Ill tell you guys. Its very worth the wait :) Thanks mkvonly! u are the boss
