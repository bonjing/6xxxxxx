Jamiroquai is a British jazz funk and acid jazz band formed in 1992. Jamiroquai were initially
the most prominent component in the early-1990s London-based acid jazz movement,
alongside groups such as Incognito, the James Taylor Quartet, the Brand New Heavies,
Galliano, and Corduroy. Subsequent albums have explored other musical directions such as
pop, rock and electronica. Jamiroquai have sold more than 25 million albums worldwide and
won a Grammy Award in 1997
