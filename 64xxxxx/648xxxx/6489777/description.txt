First penned in 1748 by John Cleland while serving in an English debtors' prison, his erotic novel no doubt relieved the aching loneliness of his incarceration. The subsequent publication of Fanny Hill brought inevitable banning for obscenity that was not overturned until court cases in the 1960s and 1970s.
