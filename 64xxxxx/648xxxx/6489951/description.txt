Here is an assortment of Buddhist books and shorter texts on meditation, from works aimed at beginners to more advanced, theoretical texts. Of course, meditation is so basic to Buddhism that you will find pertinent works in my other Buddhist torrents, for instance, five books on Vipassana or Insight Meditation -

These texts are in a variety of formats, but none are in EPUB or MOBI. I hope some downloaders will convert them to other formats and share them in other ways. Please seed.

By the way, I accidentally uploaded a torrent of 350 texts related to Tibetan Buddhism anonymously, and so, it does not show up on my list of torrents (which include a good many related to Buddhism).  You can this Tibetan Buddhist archive here -
