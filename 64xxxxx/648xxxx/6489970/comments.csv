,applev7,2011-08-16T08:54Z,I want the serial?????
,thespiritglass,2011-09-01T13:52Z,"I burned all images onto individual dvd's, but when it says insert disc 2, the second disc I put in is NOT recognised during set up, and everytime i hit continue it does not go any further, can someone PLEASE comment on the 100% complete working procedure as I am stuck at nearly halfway to install this......"
,poormansdvd,2011-09-11T15:46Z,"from what i see 

there are 4 cds

iso 1,iso2,iso3,iso4

i would mount rather than burning depending on hard drive space

if your going to burn you will need a double layer dvd burner with double layer dvds

dvd 1 is 7.04 gb
dvd 2 is 6.53 gb

then install , patch , keymaker

gonna take a bullet for you as i dont trust unproven uploaders but downloading it now"
,poormansdvd,2011-09-11T20:28Z,"alright seems to work but my computer is way to outdated for this stuff

but seem on the level

first i used magiciso mount

down load from here free ware 

http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.htm

second 

install the trial version as i could not find the serial number

select the programs you want installed there are quit alot to choose from most of them my computer system requirements do not meet

after installition close your anti virus as they do not like keygenerators

on cd3 is the folder named core with the key generator in it select the software you selected and patch"

,sianide13,2011-10-30T22:08Z,"@thespiritglass - i'm having the same issue with no positive results.  i get the first disk installed, then once asked for the second disc it won't recognize the disc and will no longer proceed.

anyone found a working fix? i've tried everything in my knowledge to get past this step.  i need help."
,fedepres,2011-11-06T12:10Z,It works!! thanks so much!!
,tsjca213,2012-02-10T21:05Z,"@thespiritglass @sianide13 - Wow! im having the exact same problem as well!

When i mount the second disc it is not recognized by the installer.

I tried to download this package from thethingy also, and i got the same issue.

I have used magicISO and PowerISO, didnt make a difference.

How do everyone get past this step?"
