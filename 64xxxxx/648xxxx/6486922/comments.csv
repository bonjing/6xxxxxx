His are better quality and .avi, which is more commonly used. I stopped downloading yours and only seeding his, and I have a very high u/l bandwith. 

Just a thought, seems stupid to split everybody up.

Not trying to be a dick, what you're doing is a great thing for sure.  It would just make more sense if we all stuck together on one solid, fast, quality set of seeds.  

It'll help keep the new comers coming back since they won't have to wait all day for a download."
