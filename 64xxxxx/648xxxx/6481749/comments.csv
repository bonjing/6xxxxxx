[T],VixenofVenus,2011-06-20T18:19Z,"I'm downloading this one for a look-see ... but from reading about it ... it sounds like the extended cut has a few scenes that don't really add to the tone of the film, and then a few scenes that do ...

Gonna have to check it out and see whether it works ..."
,Sonicblade007,2011-06-20T20:10Z,Please SEED!!
,omfgtrish,2011-06-21T03:19Z,"Perfect torrent, but my word, this movie BLOWS GOATS. I registered just to tell you that. "
,moshster,2011-06-21T09:24Z,"There is nothing wrong with the story or the movie technicals.  This is one of those movies that you love or hate, depending on your genre tastes.  If you love this kind of fantasy genre then you'll love this movie, otherwise you'll hate it.  Personally I think this movie will gain a cult following."
,Bondshead,2011-06-21T16:35Z,This extended version has 17 minutes of additional fight scenes. These are the scenes they took out so it could get a PG-13 rating. 
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-06-22T00:00Z,"@omfgtrish Definitely! This should have been something I'd love, but it was genuinely one of the worst films I've ever seen. 100% style, 0% content. 

Thanks for the upload though, BOZX!"
