Does anyone know of any other plugins? They appear to be .air files and I couldn't find any other information on them. 

I ask because I'd like to edit or create my own plugins for it (the standard ones are kinda bland). I have no idea what was used or how to make them so any help is greatly appreciated in advance. =)"

If anyone is looking for a simple way to play ""white noise"" so they can get some sleep, I stream it from: http://simplynoise.com/ 

You can customize White, Pink, and Brown noise.  I play it over my pc speakers at bed time.  To mix the sounds just open 2 or 3 browser tabs and play them at the same time.  If you have problems with the computer going to sleep or the background tabs stop playing, try putting the browser in Full Screen mode (F11.)  Most computers will not idle to sleep while streaming content in Full Screen mode.

Hope this is helpful."
