This is a collection of Binaural Natural Environments that you can play with Aire Freshener

Binaural recording is a method of recording sound that uses a special microphone arrangement and is intended for replay using headphones. Binaural Recording transcends normally recorded stereo, since it accurately reproduces the effect of hearing a sound in person, given the 360Â° nature of how human ears pick up nuance in the sound waves. Binaural recordings can very convincingly reproduce location of sound behind, ahead, above, or wherever else the sound actually came from during recording.

Aire Freshener is a combined nature sounds player, CD player, and MIDI wind chimes player.
