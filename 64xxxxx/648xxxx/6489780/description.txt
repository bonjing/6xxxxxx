"I've Been Everywhere" by Lucky Starr in 1962 ( #1 Sydney #2 Melbourne #1 Brisbane #1 Adelaide #4 Perth) which contains 94 Aussie place names, sparked off overseas demand for Lucky to record the same idea to other countries. Geoff Mack, who penned the song was touring the Australian outback but urgent telegrams brought him flying back to Festival Records with new lyrics using place names for New Zealand, Great Britain and the U.S.A. Lucky then had the task of learning the new lyrics and recording them in record time. Here for you to download is that EP by Lucky Starr "Lucky's Been Everywhere" (FX-10.485)
