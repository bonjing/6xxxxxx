The debut album from 2007 and first musical excursion as a band. Some of the songs on this album were already years old. Others, like A Broken Toast came together a day or two before the recording session. Remko Schouten engineered the album and the musical style varies from pop-rock to singer-songwriter with a pinch of reggae for good taste. The album was received well in the press and gave us courage and energy to continue our journey as a band.
