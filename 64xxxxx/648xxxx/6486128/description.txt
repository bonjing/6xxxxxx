This well-established international series examines major areas of basic and clinical research within neuroscience, as well as emerging and promising subfields.
This volume examines the challenges in cognitive science with cross-linking of different interfacing disciplines like psychology, neuroscience, computer science, and linguistics. The volume contains two major sections: one on cognitive neuroscience and another on computational modeling. The section on cognitive neuroscience will focus on major cognitive processes like learning, perception (especially time perception), attention, language and reasoning and the neural bases for those cognitive processes. The second section on computational modeling will focus on computational modeling of neural and cognitive functions.
