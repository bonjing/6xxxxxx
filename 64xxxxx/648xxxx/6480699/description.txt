This album presents the distinctive blues born from the hardships of life â€”especially African-American lifeâ€” in northern Mississippi. In addition to their music, this collection includes the men's speech: J. D. Short, who died shortly after this recording was made, contributes his memories about Charlie Patton, and Son House presents a description of "the key of minor."
