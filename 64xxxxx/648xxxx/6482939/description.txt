POWER OF METAL - 2CD LIVE



Description:

CD 1.

Gamma Ray's material is not very exciting. Ralf Scheepers is still the singer. Most of the songs are from the Insanity & Genius CD.
There is a short Helloween medley: I Want Out/Future world/Ride the Sky. It is too short actually, clocking in at 4 minutes.
Helicon closes the disc with 2 average songs.

CD 2.

Rage set includes 4 songs from Missing Link: Refuge, Nevermore, Firestorm, Certain Days. It's surprising that they did not include
more songs from that album, since it was their latest at the time. The best songs are included from the preceding album, Trapped!
: Solitary man, Enough is Enough, and a few others. Don't Fear the Winter from Perfect Man is a highlight too.
The songs from the earlier albums are not as interesting, perhaps because I'm not familiar with the studio versions.
There's quite a bit of speaking to the crowd, in German obviously.
