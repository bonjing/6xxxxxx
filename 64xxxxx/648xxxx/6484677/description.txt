The 20th book in the Anita Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton, released on June 7, 2011.




I just finally found the actual "print" version of this and I had to share it right away on Pirate Bay.

Included are several versions of the book, including .PDF and .LIT.

This is my first upload, and I am quite happy to be the first to bring it to Pirate Bay and finally give back to all those who have helped me by seeding their torrents.
