                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Hynes/Food Twins Dominic Littlewood explores the case of a woman who allegedly
 used 25,000 of the council's money to pay her rent and council tax while owning
 a property and running an import business. He also hears the story of Corinna
 and Nick Lunn, who received help from a charity after their twins were born with
 a rare illness.
