A motion comic of the short but incredibly good story written by Geoff Johns, this isn't a huge space epic story like Green Lantern has become famous for, this is a much more intimate story about who Hal Jordan is and what flying means to him. This was first printed in the pages of Green Lantern Secret Files and Origins back in 2005 and can also be found in the trade paperback "Green Lantern No Fear".
 I would like to thank the publishers an the artist of the source material for all their hard work, and I would also like to extend my gratitude to the musical group Pink Floyd, their beautiful compositions have always been a personal inspiration and I have been wanting to use their work in one of these motion comics for years now. Also a huge thank you to the voice actors who helped make this project come together so quickly, we got this project to fly (see what I did there?) in just over one week.
