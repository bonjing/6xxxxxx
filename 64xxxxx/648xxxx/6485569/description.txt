[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:
Video: EP1C
thx - great video
Audio: Imagines Line
thx - great audio

Encode:
another 8h work job. Had 2 videos to start with. EP1C was great, scenes at daylight are very good, darker scenes just ok.
Imagines Encode of the source was better cropped,rotated and resized and had that great audio, but the video has too much grain and a lot darker scenes.

I wanted to use imagines video first but something with the motion is not right, its not running smooth.
I noticed that EP1C source has 24.000 frames and imagines video had 23.976 frames.
guess thats what the problem is, cant fix that without having the source video.
So is switched back to EP1C Video and used it as my source. So you dont have the better cropped video but a lot better quality in the end.
Since some scenes are reddish and some too dark, i had to cut the video in around 40 pieces, and treat every piece differently in colours,brightness and contrast.
Scenes at daylight already were very good i just slightly adjusted them when needed, dark and darker scenes are brightened up as needed too. you can see now more in the dark.
Looks to me as the best possible video to do with that sources.
I attached 3 different samples, at daylight,dark and darkest that you can see what you get.
I had to resync imagines line back to the video, still a lot of work was necessary to get all in sync.
Still did my usual cleaning to the audio but not a big deal, since it was a very good line.

hope you enjoy another long work project
