HAY YAAR U DON'T HAVE AVI FILE?
PLZ ADD AVI MAN"
,swexpert,2011-06-19T17:08Z,"koyyode, mkv or Matroska format is much much better. a 350Mb file can give you better quality than a 700MB AVI file. Even scaling up does not affect the quality of the video much due to the container format.

Use Media Player Classic (MPC) to play mkv files. If you cannot play, something has messed up with your Matroska codec, so try updating or reinstalling your codecs.

Hope that helps.

,swexpert,2011-06-26T03:31Z,"Movie is good, senseless (not nonsense) humour, no story line. Good as a stress buster. Downside is too many stars so you don't get to see much of any single one.

A/V = 5/7
I stopped watching halfway, will wait for a better print because its worth enjoying.

Thanks
