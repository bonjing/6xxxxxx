The Remains of the day is a most compelling film about the loss of core
values that have any real meaning.

Indeed the capacity to articulate well is fundamentally intrinsic to what is
a sane and civilized existence for those that are capable of attaining it, certainly.

That said, there can be no substitute for the ability to give genuine care and warmth
as is appropriate to those that are in our community (in fair spirit I would think).
It is otherwise a meaningless existence we pursue, despite what flashes of apparent 
brilliance are offered as an example along the way.
