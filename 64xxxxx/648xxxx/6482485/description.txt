In 1980, after twenty years of the blues scenes of Providence, Detroit-Ann Arbor, Chicago, the Bay Area, the Cajun country of Louisiana, and Texas - performing with Duke Robillard, Steve Nordella, Big Walter Horton, Asleep At The Wheel and Johnny Shine (Nicholas played on and produced the late Johnny Shine's last album with Snooky Pryor), Johnny Moved to the Hill Country outside Austin and opened the Hilltop Cafe, inconveniently located in the middle of nowhere (10 miles north of Fredericksburg, Texas) Until 1991, that was the only way you could hear Nicholas on any recording.

Then in 1994, Antones released his CD Thrill On The Hill, a live CD which brought him again to the forefront of the world blues scene. By popular demand, TopCat Records is re-releasing this gem with 4 great bonus tracks from the original sessions. Thrill on the Hill was recorded live on location, direct to two track at the Hilltop CafÃ©.
