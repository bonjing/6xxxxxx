,FreeTibet,2011-06-22T09:43Z,"The subtitles work fine for me. The only problem is that apparently they are the same ones that were used at the Rome Film Festival screening of the film, infamous for having ""human beingsâ mistranslated as âhuman beans"" :-)"
,SirMild,2011-09-01T16:58Z,"I don't think the subtitles are all that infamous :-)  More like the original story is famous.  ""Human beans"" is a joke from the original book, not a mis-translation.  If you haven't read the book, you should definitely check it out, a real classic for sure."
,Rantaine,2011-12-01T12:22Z,Human Beans... lmao!
