* Comment:

My original Load cd gave errors while I was trying to rip it. I decided to 
download it, but the FLAC-version didn't have enough seeders.

I was able to repair my cd and ripped it. Thought some people would appreciate
a downloadable FLAC-version. I'll try and seed it as long as possible. Try to 
do the same.
