,Aviatrice,2011-10-11T14:15Z,How to install textures: surf the net and find the liveries (you can find hundreds of them on Flight1 Library). When installed follow the instructions that written in My Fleet Instructions (myfleet.pdf). This file goes with this airplane. It seems quite complicated but it works when done correctly!
