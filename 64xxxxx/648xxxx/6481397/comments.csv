By the way, you can check the sample before :)"
,gorgang,2011-07-19T05:20Z,"Gabe,

Thanks for the fix. By the way, I met Gregory Peck in Houston when he was touring the country to talk about his career. He stated that the fight between himself and C. Heston was ""a bit real."" Although the two of them were longtime friends, he never understood how or why Heston got mixed up with the NRA. This remained one of his favorite films, and I think it is one of the best, especially by William Wyler, and not only for Peck and Simmons, but also the great Burl Ives, a great folksinger and actor (also Cat On A Hot Tin Roof with Paul Newman)."
[T],-Gabe-,2011-07-19T08:21Z,"It was ""a bit real"" ? Waw, I didn't expect to that! You made me feel jealous for your meeting :)
Yeap, a good acting also for Burl Ives
...and is one of my favorite movies of all time too

I'll be looking soon for Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

Thanks for your interesting replay :)"
