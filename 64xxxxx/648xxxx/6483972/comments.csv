If anyone has it, I'm always working when this show's on and still havn't seen much of the previous season"
,ectoendomezo,2011-07-09T18:04Z,"Ahhh..Thank You So Much!

I Don't have ""TeeVee"" anymore..its too grim and frankly..like ""Material Support For The Enemy""..and ""Current TV"" is hard to find anyway..

So Thanks. Because this actually looks great and I have been frustrated by this ""Torrent Challenge"".

Anyone out there get the ""Oxycontin Express""? If its included in this File I apologize..if not..Please..Please..Please..(Sounds like a James Brown Song)

Thanks.."
