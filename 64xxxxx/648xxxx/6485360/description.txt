They may have been downgraded over the intervening years to a retrospectively-acclaimed, collector-type act, but at the time Skip Bifferty were genuine contenders: significant radio support for their singles, heavyweight management (courtesy of the notorious Don Arden), and afforded Next Big Thing status by the weekly pop papers. 
Sadly, though, it didn't quite work out. Despite receiving rave reviews, the band's eponymous album failed to elevate them to the premier league, largely due to RCA's bizarre decision not to release it until the summer of 1968 - a full year after it had been completed. 

Not that such record company procrastination matters now, as the album has long been regarded as one of the most dazzling examples of the British psychedelic pop genre. It forms the basis of this new, definitive Skip Bifferty collection, which, for the first time, gathers their entire studio output under one roof. 

Pride of place goes to three previously unreleased recordings, all taken from the original master-tapes. `Jesus Smith (The Other Side Of)' is the band's semi-legendary, hitherto-lost debut studio recording, while there are two versions of `Skizoid Revolution', a song that has previously only been available with a guest vocal from Alan Hull. As with all Skip Bifferty material, these far superior versions feature the soulful tones of the band's lead singer, the hugely underrated Graham Bell. 

An essential release for anyone interested in British psychedelia!
