,Keegen,2011-06-21T04:44Z,Are there subtitles in this release?
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-21T05:03Z,Not all. But subs are available externally.
,Squeezert,2011-07-22T20:51Z,"Hey! Thanks you so much for sharing. I have a suggestion though. Can you give one or two people your bandwidth in stead of everybody? Once they got it complete, they (hopefully) become seeders. That way the download speed would increase. At the moment it takes 400 days, i'm not joking. I've some 7MB/s upload speed available..."
,Mollenvanger,2011-08-01T11:25Z,"Hey!   Thanks you so much for this torrent! 
Though, I have a question about the 33 connected seeders. Actually one is seeding, 32 are just connected. Is there an option at my end which is wrong? At this moment it takes 320 days, really. 
Thanks again for this great torrent! "
,jstew1,2011-08-08T01:25Z,"hi, can someone tell me what format these are in, are they mp4 or mkv, and will they work on a ps3 ? thanks"
,Squeezert,2011-08-09T07:23Z,"These are mkv, but no idea if they work on a PS3"
,Linendail,2011-08-29T23:16Z,They would seem to be x264... :G
,esince,2011-09-01T18:53Z,"Seed, please! After downloading around 9% of the total size, the speed dropped to 1kB/s from 200-300kB/s. :S

,lenwar,2011-10-01T16:50Z,"Has anyone found the Dutch subtitles?

So far I have only found the Season 1 Dutch subtitles that belong with this release...."
,h4ckerman,2011-10-26T14:41Z,The ULTIMATE TORRENT we just need some seeders dont we?:D
,lilly113,2011-11-01T09:37Z,"Really nice, thank u very mutch DownTYU u are best!"
,jajoah,2011-12-11T09:32Z,Great release although it took some while to complete the download. I will keep seeding this for some while
,SweetDoug,2011-12-12T03:48Z,"Okay...

Having taken almost a year to download the other two large BSG torrents, at 91gigs and 61 gigs, do I really need to try this one? Is it any ""better""? Quality? Video? Sound?

I'm pretty satisfied with  	

Battlestar.Galactica.Complete.720p.HDTV.x264-HD 

by PeN as it's all 1280x720 5.1

Any compelling reason for this as to quality?

No offense Reptile. Appreciate the time and effort, too. I do like a bigger file size because there's gotta be more ""stuff"" there.

Damn! This is a good show. Everything looks like a wanna-be rip-off of it now."
,faeruszorander,2011-12-21T16:06Z,"Superwicked torrent, ah frack, need bigger drive's..."
,fuisp,2012-01-12T21:15Z,"Fuck this shit.

Added 3 days ago and have an avarage download speed of 5 to 15 kB/s.

Why even upload something this huge if you cant handle it. Cunt."
,muLineZu,2012-01-23T23:44Z,"Thank you very much DownTYU & REPTiLE for one of the biggest torrent on TPB!
It took me 8 days to finish it (no, I don't have a dial-up connection, if you're wondering) and I've downloaded it with avg. 426.7 KB/s; meanwhile I've uploaded no less than 4.28 TB (a 15.6 ratio U/D). Why do I bother you with this statistic? Just to say that if you want to share, you can do it at least as me (and I don't think I have the best bandwidth); if I had 3-4 seeders that wouldn't strangled their upload speed, I would have had finished in 2-3 days (which I hope I helped others to do...). Thanks for sharing, brothers, but I think we can do much better..."
,xBenedictx,2012-01-26T02:53Z,"Please seed guys, the torrent is at 0 peers and 107 leeches. I havent even gotten season 2 yet, just 1 and the miniseries T.T"
,xBenedictx,2012-01-26T03:06Z,Yay Seeders! thanks!
,pawas,2012-02-03T19:29Z,"Have some patience, I downloaded it in 6 weeks."
,halidak,2012-03-16T14:39Z,Oh my God! Great upload...Thank you!!!
,MjewelsBE,2012-03-21T23:10Z,Hey guys ! We need more seeders :)
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-28T21:59Z,"Pfft, amateurish quality again, and absolutely slow speeds.

0/1000, try harder uploader would ya."
,Erfeuil,2012-04-29T13:05Z,"Great show, and the torrent is fast (It took me 2weeks to download)
I don't know about the other torrents but sound is perfect (only episode 06 of the season 2 is awful) and the video too. You can easily find English subtitles, and also French subtitles. 
Worth it ! 
I'll seed as long as I can. "
,igneshto,2012-06-06T16:39Z,"Just uploaded 310GBs, took me almost 3 months(Download time included)... But I did my share... So enjoy...."
