Clay Bidwell is a young man in a small town who witnesses his friend, Earl (Gregory Sporleder)kill himself because of the ongoing affair that Clay was having with the man's wife, Amanda (Georgina Cates). Feeling guilty, Clay now resists the widow when she presses him to continue with their affair.

Clays problems worsen when he inadvertently befriends a serial killer named Lester Long, who murders the nagging widow in an attempt to "help" his "fishing buddy." Clay is horrified, but does not go to the police for fear of his role in his friends suicide coming to light. But that doesn't matter for the police, as well as for a savvy female FBI agent (Janeane Garofalo) and her partner (Phil Morris), who see Clay as their prime suspect. Yet Clay doesnt tell them of his "friend," who admits to him his crimes.
