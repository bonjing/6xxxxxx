WarLordConsole ALPHA Release 21/08/2006
 by Labmaster
 
This is a command line utility for dumping and inserting maps from 
Nintendo/Intelligent System's Gameboy Advance game "Advance Wars 2:
Black Hole Rising".

This utility created by labmaster is very useful and is the required tool for 
inserting compressed maps into Advance Wars 2.  However, using the utility 
is hard and has taken me a week to figure out how to use it.  

It turns out the reference.xml file needed updated to include all the list of 
terrain and units.  So I have gone and sent this update to romhacking net to 
include the latest files.  

Many thanks to rpgfan for working out how the utility works.  If it werenâ€™t 
for him, I would have never figured out how to use this.

The utility that you have downloaded should include the following:

- An updated reference.xml
- Four .xml map examples 
- An AW2 cleaner patch, apply this if the rom you are using has a hacked 
  intro when you play the rom
- An AW2 gba save file named â€˜aw2.savâ€™
- List of AW2 Terrain (almost finshed)
- Useful Hacking Notes
- Labmaster's readme file
- RadioShadowâ€™s readme file
- Other stuff to make the utility work

You should now have version 1.2 of this utility.  I have gone and done a 
massive update to the reference file and added most of the AW2 terrain.  
Also include some useful hacking notes and included a few more sample 
maps.  

I have started to create a guide on how to use it.
