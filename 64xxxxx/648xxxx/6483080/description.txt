- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

So 2 years after releasing our previous record Â“Ways To EscapeÂ” it's been a
long journey of member changes, songwriting and rehearsing but itÂ’s all been
worth it! WeÂ’re finally releasing our new record Â“What Keeps You BreathingÂ”
tomorrow! We know it's a real cliche thing to say but it feels bloody good to
be releasing what we think is our best stuff yet! A lot of hard work has gone
into these 11 new songs so we hope you spend just a much time listening to
them as we have writing them!

You probably already know but our album is being bought out by a whole gang of
friendsÂ… Lockjaw Records, No Reason Records, Fond Of Life Records, Bad Mood
Records, Funtime Records and Shield Recordings, itÂ’s a real group effort and
it's good to be teaming up with such gentlemen! The album is going to be
available for very cheap and should be all over in the coming weeks! There
will also be the release of the record on 12Â” in the coming weeks, more
details on that soon, but for now, get yourself off redtube, get yourself an
early night and go get our new album first thing tomorrow!

Fucking awesome melodic punk rock. You better check this shit out.
