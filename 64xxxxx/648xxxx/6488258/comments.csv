,babipsylon,2011-12-18T17:27Z,"Hi

When I click the LAN button in the game main menu, nothing happens. Has anyone else had this problem or now what can be wrong? Joedude345 apperently did nog have the problem, so I wonder why, as I would love to play this game over LAN.

,babipsylon,2011-12-18T17:50Z,"hi

Ok, I solved the problem by downloading the ipx wrapper. So now I have a menu, but I still don't see the other pc's. I runned the ipxrouter.exe. In the ipxconfig application, the ports also match. Any suggestions how to solve this?

Thanks a lot."
