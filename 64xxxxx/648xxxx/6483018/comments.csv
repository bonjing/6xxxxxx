[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-25T20:21Z,"you'll notice the Windows XP Network wizard is installed after you install the service packs, this will help network lan pcs together for mapped network drives. I used to use this version myself a LOT before i found a suitable Windows XP replacement (Performance Edition is the XP i like)"
,lisaherzel,2011-06-27T20:25Z,I tried getting it in a dual boot with Windows XP. I am still struggling to get that to work. Stand alone it installs like a charm! I'm going to install the updates/Plus packages now.

[T],n2kmaster,2011-06-28T16:28Z,"K to dual boot xp, you'll need to set it up like this, fdisk the drive into your two partitions, install 98 first then install xp next. If you install xp first, 98 wont show properly."
,lisaherzel,2011-07-16T13:22Z,"Looks like I completely forgot to thank you! The dual boot didn't work out, but I was able to install it on a other (older) computer. Your pack works like a charm, thanks!
