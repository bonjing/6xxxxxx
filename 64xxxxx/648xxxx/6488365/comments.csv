If a SKIDROW game doesn't work for you, uninstall and follow the directions next time. Or get rid of your computer and get yourself a calculator."
,deathtrooper30,2011-06-23T12:41Z,This works flawlessly! Given all the other releases problems with difficulty and videos not playing I should've waited for a scene release to begin with. Plus it downloaded so fast.. actually one of the fastest new releases on here!

For those having problems playing (remember single player!) just follow the uploader's instructions (see the description) and you won't go wrong. I didn't use the auto-loader though from the mounted .iso - cancel that and use the installer from the virtual drive. Don't forget to copy the entire SKIDROW folder contents over once the game installs too. For me that's all it took. Great. I shall now seed it as much as I can to say thanks.

Thats an integrated gpu that was not meant for gaming the time it got released around 2008?
in short, i belive that your specs does not fill the minimum req for this game. the minimum specs i managed to find is as follows:

RAM: 2GB

you might be able to force the game boot up in 640x480 or similar with right cliking on the application .exe and selecting properties and compability, i have no clue if this actually will do any good tho(probably not but might be worth a try). if your drivers with the gpu and display is up-to-date its probably a compability issue?"
,appie366,2011-06-25T20:57Z,"Meppster,
It hasnt work but thnx for your advice.
i found another solution just run in windowed mode and then with your mouse you canadjust the resolution:)
and gamekingg what are your system specs then i can help you."
,brianxxx,2011-06-25T21:00Z,"Solved my NO LAUNCH problem.

Seems (not sure really but only thing that changed) was that launching this game went OK after I resolved an issue with my Creative X-Fi card. Sometimes Windows 7 (or Vista) will ""lose"" the card and you need to Device Manager - uninstall it then reinstall it. PITFA!!!!!!!! Anyway...once I did that and the card was recognized again by Win 7, this game launched fine. 

Now playing it and enjoying myself finally!"

Fear 3 is no exception to this rule, with motion blur enabled by default with no easy way to turn it off, and no way to do so via the tried and tested method of messing with configuration options.

So then how are you supposed to turn it off? well weâ€™re about to tell you.

Install a hex editor of your choice and open the games main executable file, when open search for the following hex:

When the game starts and I choose single player, I get the message ""the player has left the session"".  I get this same message no matter what I choose.  I have tried to reinstall many times with the same results. I can set all the settings but I continue to get the message and I have to exit the game.  Can you please offer any advise.  Thank you.

,elena.a,2011-07-11T19:47Z,I found something that works with the HOST ERROR. I read a comment about having a USB plugged in so I plugged in my Kindle and no more error. :D Also the thing about your emulated driver being a letter more down the alphabet than your real driver is crap. Hope this helps.

,anichu,2011-07-20T21:50Z,"FOR NUBES: This is the first game I ever install and it worked out just fine. Here is what I did:
1. Download the torrent.
2. Unpack the torrent with WinRAR (freeware)
3. Open the (.iso) file with DAEMON TOOLS program. In case you don't have this program, which was the case for me, it is a freeware, so don't panic. Just go to: (http://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads) and download the ""DAEMON TOOLS lite""
4. The DAEMON program is basically a virtual DVD drive. Hit the play button (green triangle) which will then open a window where one of the options is ""Run"", click this.
5. You are now installing the game on your main disk drive (presumably C:). At the end of the install, you will be prompted to check the boxes for some programs (DirectX, Microsoft Visual C++). I recommend you select the general DirectX option (the top one) just in case as the game wasn't running until I did this. It didn't work when I chose the DirectX (x64) option for some reason, even though I have a 64-bit system. Check the ""C++"" option too if ur unsure whether or not you already have this program. 
6. Now open the folder ""Skidrow"" from the original file you downloaded and unpacked using WinRAR (step 2). Copy all the available files and paste them into the folder where the game is now installed (from step 5). Make sure to ""copy and replace"" the files.
7. Now download and unpack the crack for this game. Download from: (http://www.btarena.org/games/crack-only/fear-3-crack-only-skidrow)
8. Copy all the files in the crack folder you just downloaded and, similar to step 7, paste them in the folder where the game is installed. Again, make sure to ""copy and replace"".
9. Click on the executable file and (hopefully) enjoy!

Hope the above proves useful to some fellow gamers :) "

,Banzay27,2011-09-24T01:58Z,"Has worked flawlessly so far, on Win 7 64 bit.
The trailers had disappointed me. Then I'd heard the game wasn't as bad as the trailers. I've been disappointed again - it really is about as bad as I'd expected. Feels low budget and I see more rookie dev mistakes than talent.
Also, it's one of those games that starts to wreck my nerves after an hour or 2 of playing. Sure, most FPS can do that, but this one doesn't compensate with enough enjoyment. In FPS, I'm usually playing on and on, in long sessions, but it's either because I'm enjoying it or because I want to finish it as soon as I can, close that chapter and uninstall the game.
There's been too many subpar FPS for me recently... Bulletstorm, Brink, now this one. Well, I've still got Crysis 2 left, I tend to leave the best for last. If I were to play any of those after Crysis, they'd feel even less fun, I expect.
Play it if you're into the story of FEAR as I am. But I'd recommend going ahead on easiest difficulty, it's not done that well that a challenge feels good. It really feels worse than FEAR 2, which in turn was worse than the original except in visuals. Gets me nostalgic about that original romp..."
