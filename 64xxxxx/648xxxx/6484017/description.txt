This album has everything you could want. A million listenings would not be enough to get all the humor and dirt and sex that is in Different Class. This makes you want to put on spangled shoes and be a rock star. It is a huge, riotous, spooky, ambient, moody, loud CD. It has the size of great glam-era Bowie but the maudlin smarts of the Smiths. Highly recommended for dancing on tables, drinking vodka, and finding a too-young-for-you partner.
