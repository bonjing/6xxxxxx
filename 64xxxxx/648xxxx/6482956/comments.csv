,zerocta,2011-06-20T21:10Z,"that's good or bad?
people think different, you know?
I might not like what you do, and vice-versa."
,S111or,2011-06-20T23:47Z,"For a BR rip, even though RC area, is 2 much low a quality.
Video should be like 9/10, but it seems to be 5/10 by the way I see the sample pictures.
I shall wait for another relase with better picture.
Thanks for the upload, but this time I sahll pass."

è¶³audio will be 2 ch. Stereo ONLY. (surround not available)

1. Go to Sound Settings
2. Audio Settings
3. Select Optical Digital
4. Check all Boxes*
5. Save settings
6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

,Brickface,2011-06-22T03:03Z,"Like everyone has a ""Sound System""..."
,SoundBarber,2011-06-23T04:33Z,"By 'Sound System"" I mean how your sound is connected. My PS3 is HDMI to a lcd screen with sound out of the tv. ""Optical"" is not connected to anything. I've burned the mpeg files to disc and/or copied them to my PS3."
,ftservd,2011-06-23T23:33Z,For a early release its good quality stuff audio not so great though. V 8.5  A 5
,Funkadub,2011-06-24T19:20Z,Cinavia...lol.  Hollywood should stop trying to figure out ways to mess with pirating and start making good movies again.  Haven't seen anything good for at least a year or two now.
