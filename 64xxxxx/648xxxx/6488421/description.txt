None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

Removed commentary and lots of "bonus" material.

This collection still came to 7 dvd9 after deleting a lot of stuff, too much
to upload for one collection.So after making 7 uncompressed dvd9s for a master
copy they were then compressed to dvd5s and the quality is still great.
The Woody Woodpecker episodes have been seperated to make 3 discs leaving 3 discs of " and friends" and the last disk with both.
The discs will be uploaded alternately.

This disc has 30 episodes of "and friends"
Woody does appear on a couple or so episodes but only in cameo parts.
 
Enjoy
