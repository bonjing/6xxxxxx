[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Sources:
Video: Russian Relizlab
thx
Audio: Imagines Line
thx

Encode:

I used relizlab video which is encoded from same source as imagine. Relizlab has done an amazing job already, video looked really nice.
Just had to fix, brightness,gamma,contrast,black and white base,sharpness,chroma, and looks perfect now. 
I adjusted some perspectives and blurred the russian subs and replaced them with the translated eng subs from imagines version thx. 
now you can read the subs clearly.
i also attached the 40 secs endsequence from imagines version after the relizlab video to have it full thx again.
Now to the Audio. Imagines Line was nice, has some slight metallic noise in the background, that cant be removed without attacking voice channels. but no big deal, still did my usual cleaning of the track and synced it back to my new video, took a lot of cuts to make but now everything is sync.
2 samples are included, looks a lot better than whats out atm.
enjoy
