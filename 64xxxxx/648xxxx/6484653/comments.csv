[H],HeroMaster,2011-06-24T06:31Z,"@seeloa81 Excuse me, this is not fake, 100% working torrent, if you don't want it leave it but keep in mind useless comments will get you banned little boy."
,omfgtrish,2011-06-24T21:15Z,"Not bad, some audio syncing required, decent enough to watch! Thanks!!!"
,Sachinb,2011-06-25T14:22Z,"Whoever has given this video an 8, they would probably give a black screen a 5.  I have this loaded onto my iPad (small screen) and its barely watchable.
Not complaining, just don't like being misled.  Thanks to Hero_No_1 for the upload, but I will definitely wait for a better copy."
,Demonstalker121,2011-06-26T06:14Z,"A8/V8 Its a good TS can't fault it for that. The movie is set 3/4 at night and makes the picture very dark in places. Even with the brightness turned up i still couldn't tell you what the alien looked like, some scenes i didnt know what was going on. If your waiting for this film i dont think cam copies are the way to go coz of the brightness issues. If your not that bothered about the movie that much this copy is good.   "
,tigersquall,2011-06-26T06:19Z,"whats the a/v rating? i dont give a toss about ""for a TS"" what is the overall rating..."
,Demonstalker121,2011-06-26T06:20Z,"A8/V8 spot on for TS.

Only problem is the movie is set mostly at night making brightness an issue with cam copies, i still dont know what the alien looked like, a couple of scenes i wasnt even sure what was happening. 

If you've been waiting for this movie, cam copies are not the way to go. If your not that bothered about the movie this copy will do you fine.   "
,vassetski,2011-06-26T14:57Z,I am looking for this movie in Russian.
,nireshis,2011-06-28T06:34Z,"yeah, thats quite good one.. 8/10"
,psycotroop,2011-06-28T20:23Z,Well d/l this when it first came out on the 21st and today received a letter of copyright infringement from paramount studios. Would seem this torrent is being watched. 
,jaja202,2011-07-15T22:52Z,please seed...
,bid4sid,2011-07-16T18:51Z,"trusted copy..........A 8, V 8"
,boniac,2011-07-26T00:38Z,"got a warning letter from comcast for this one, not that i care, but just a heads up for anyone who does."
