NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release.......... Super 8 2011

Ok seems some had lag issues on our first release,so we've gone back and one it again
Totally did it a different way and used megui to create the script,which gave us the correct framerate....however
the issue seemed to be with the way it was cammed ,as in set to var fps.
We opted this time to stick to 24 fps which is what the first part is and the other file we changed fps to match so
we could append.
Now onto the filtering side....firstly we used the perspective filter to pull it straight and level,then used the crop option
and resized.
Also the film is/was quiet dark so we made it brighter this time round and also we used a smoother to clean the noise and also
managed to add some sharpness back into.
Now there was also 4 parts the camera slightly dropped so we cut the files and changed the perspective and crop on each one of them
so it flows pretty dam nice and hides that movement.
Audio needed to be resynced due to fps being changed,but same source as before.
