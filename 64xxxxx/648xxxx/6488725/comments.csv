,SirBunny,2011-07-04T17:01Z,"Yeah gekiganger, show a bit of a sign of not being indoctrinated by gravity. That's what you were saying, right? See, for me, when someone implies that they don't believe the Bible to be true, all I hear is ""I'm indoctrinated by the theory of gravity"". And if they don't believe the Quran, I assume it's because they've been indoctrinated by atomic theory. Don't people realize that everything they see in the movies isn't real?

..seriously though, on topic: nice torrent. :)"
,jojolabadawhoozit,2011-07-25T05:34Z,"but to back him up  I would recommend not believing the bible or evolution just because you where told to. There are many books written by people set out to disprove the bible that end up defending the bible as truth, and there are many bastard ""Christians"" that wouldn't know right from wrong if God himself was telling them (assuming he exists).
