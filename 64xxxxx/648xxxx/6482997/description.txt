If the main title for this film didn't clue you in that this is B grade, check out the a.k.a's:

Bloodhead
The Creature

Loaded with actors you've probably forgotten:

Lynda Carter
Shirley Jones
Frank Gorshin
Berney Kopell

...and some pretty large guys that look surprisingly like the director, and might have been stuntmen on "They Live!".

The story follows an uppity Negro and a White Trash bigot, who, through a lattice of coincidences turn out to be brothers.  They don't really take a shine to each other, but there is the requisite love-fest/happy ending where tag-teaming is the key-word.

In contrast with his cousin, Sofia, the budget output doesn't seem like such a huge waste.  There's plenty to appreciate here.  Especially the aging process of Beef Jerky, and the (probably wishful thinking reference to) drive-in experience. Floppy monsters.

No subs, just German and English 5.1 soundtracks.

Probably a straight to video endeavor.
