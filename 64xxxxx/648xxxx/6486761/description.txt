Release Notes:

Fully loaded with global locales, fast-paced racing,      
international espionage and a touching tale of friendship,
\\\\\\\"Cars 2\\\\\\\" also features an amped up score by Oscar and     
GRAMMY-winning composer Michael Giacchino, plus music from
alternative rock legends Weezer, country music hitmaker    
Brad Paisley, bestselling British singer/songwriter Robbie
Williams, French superstar B nabar and the power pop      
Japanese girl band Perfume. The international lineup puts 
the tune in tune-up as the \\\\\\\"Cars\\\\\\\" characters hit the road 
on a worldwide tour full of epic adventure. \\\\\\\"Cars 2\\\\\\\" is   
the fourth Pixar feature score for Giacchino, who has     
previously composed the music for \\\\\\\"The Incredibles,\\\\\\\"      
\\\\\\\"Ratatouille,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Up,\\\\\\\" along with half a dozen short    
films from the Studio. \\\\\\\"Michael is doing such a cool score
for the film,\\\\\\\" says director John Lasseter. \\\\\\\"We did not   
want to do a typical spy movie score. We wanted it to be  
something very different-a whole new approach.\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\"John    
[Lasseter] knows the story,\\\\\\\" says Giacchino. \\\\\\\"He knows    
what his characters need and what they want. That\\\\\\\'s how to
discuss music-in emotions. If Mater is feeling left out, I
can translate that into music. I love working with the    
people at Pixar because they all talk in terms of story   
and that\\\\\\\'s how I love to work.\\\\\\\"
