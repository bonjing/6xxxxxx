,dmnrocha2,2011-07-23T04:15Z,"A few songs through the album, don't have my monitors plugged in, but audio sounds perfect from my PPC built-in speakers.

They definitely still have the Limp Bizkit sound, but they've added some new sounds too. MOAR SKCREAMING for instance.

Also only took 1min to download! Gotta love that

,dmnrocha2,2011-07-23T04:17Z,"1 question. Is there any way someone uploading a torrent can keep gapless playback set? I understand that torrents don't download in order, but seriously, every single album that should've been gapless comes out not. Not a big deal to change it in iTunes, I'm just curious."
