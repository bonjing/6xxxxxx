[T],Maherz,2011-06-26T17:37Z,"@BuffyAndAngelForever
Privet Elena.
It doesn't matter what your system is! You can use 32 bit anytime.
I recommend 32 bit XP over 64 bit.
But if Windows 7, then 64 bit is better than 32 ;)"
,DaRkSe7eN,2011-06-27T20:37Z,"have you included security updates for IE8, .net framework(s)?.."

,Havort,2011-06-28T05:08Z,"Hey Maherz, 
Awesome job once again, I have an issue.
I fixed BIOS to boot CD/DVD, did md5 check, yet the disk doesn't seem to be recognized at all. My system just boots directly to the old one in the HD. 
Any ideas? (doesn't sound like a mounting problem)"

i've installed this on another pc , used the format function also ... and used a clean install ... so what have i've done wrong ?"
[T],Maherz,2011-06-29T21:17Z,"@DaRkSe7eN
Security updates for IE8 included.
.net framework not included.

@dave2441
Seems that you have a problem with your network driver!
Try deleting and re-installing it.

@Havort
How did you burn the CD?

@Errystio
It's genuine.
No need to use any crack or activator!
