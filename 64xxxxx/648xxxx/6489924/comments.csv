Thanks for keeping these files alive, some of these oldies took quite some doing to compile."
,dielaughing,2011-07-02T06:41Z,"Just one episode per year in the 80's? Exactly what way is that complete? There is approximately 1000 episodes from 1964 to todays date (consult the Wiki on it), which is roughly 10-20 eps per year.. I have roughly 440 eps myself, and the main source for them is thebox.bz, which is a torrent site with open registration, but they are harsh on ratio management and UK TV friendly ONLY, so unless yer a Britt then it's kinna hard to know what to seed or upload, but this torrent here is a far scream from complete.. in fact, it barely makes a dent in the whole BBC Horizon Series.. but at least it's here, available for people to become interested in the show, 'cause hands down, Horizon beats the crap out of every other science show I've collected! Now, if ANYONE reading this thinks they might have a rare Horizon episode to share, you'll get a prize for it.. like 50GB Upload credit and beyond @ thebox.bz because there they have a moderator that has put together the internet's best BBC Horizon Showcard, involving all who wanna become part of the community.. the ones that are still missing are not new ones, they are ones from the 60's, 70's, 80's and even some 90's are still out there somewhere... I think the hardest ones to get are the ones from the 60's and 70's... 'cause wasn't that era like, those reel to reel projector things they used to show us boring stuff at school back in the 80's (and sadly, the 90's too).. I'm just kind of wondering in the back of my own mind just how one would try and hook up one of those archaic metal beasts with the two reels moving the raw film in front of a bright light onto a pull down screen.. to a personal computer...? USB? Does Radio shack even carry a converter for a movie projector to USB..? LOL!! That seems laughable, but that's about where we're at in the collecting/combing the world for all the missing eps for the BBC Horizon Archive Project over at thebox.bz"
