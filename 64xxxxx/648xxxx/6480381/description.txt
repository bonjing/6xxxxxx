The Picadilly Line's Huge World Of Emily Small is perhaps the great lost British Psych Pop album of the 1960's by a band that were regulars at legendary London psychedelic clubs The UFO and Middle Earth. Released at the height of the Summer of Love in 1967 the album also features the same backing band and production team that created Donovan's Sunshine Superman album. Filled with delightful and evocative dreamy, pop-psych and with the addition of ten bonus tracks.
