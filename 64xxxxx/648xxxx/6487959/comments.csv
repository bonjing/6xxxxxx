Ran your uncompressed mpeg thru handbrake leaving the quality still HDTV 1920x1080 but now all ten episodes are combined into a single mkv file that is half the download size of this source torrent.

[V],wushdishmeen,2011-10-18T14:27Z,Is this video deinterlaced because the 1080i versions I've downloaded before were interlaced which causes annoying horizontal lines around moving objects.   The source is not progressive scan so it needs to be deinterlaced.
,ninline,2012-01-04T21:04Z,You know the i in 1080i stands for interlaced don't ya?  On my 240hz tv I don't see any problems with moving objects.  I doubt there is a 1080p version available so maybe just buy the set if you want absolute perfection.
