iH8Sn0w, a Toronto-based iPhone developer, released iFaith, a new SHSH blob dumper for all iOS devices which can save SHSH files of any firmware running on your device even if Apple is not signing it.

We all know that backing up SHSH blobs allows users to easily downgrade devices in the future, by simply restoring the device using iTunes. The problem is that once Apple stops signing the old firmware, there is no way to get SHSH blobs for it. This is where iFaith comes in, it allows users to dump SHSH files for the old firmware running on the device even if Apple is not signing the firmware.
