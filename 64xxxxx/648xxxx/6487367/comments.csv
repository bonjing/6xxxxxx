Cleaned the infection ok though which is the important thing, and it worked even though the machine had a previously-expired 30-day freebie license, blocking the legit HMP from fixing.

Anyone know how to remove the 30-day license flag?  Deleted all keys and values containing the strings ""SurfRight"" and ""Hitman"" but that didn't work.

Thanks for the upload Anacondaz."
