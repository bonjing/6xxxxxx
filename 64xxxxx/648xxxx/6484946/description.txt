Here is the most popular of all Buddhist scriptures, the Dhammapada, a collection of 423 verses/teachings. There is the text in English and the original Pali (with illustrations), which links to MP3 files spoken in English and chanted in Pali. There is also a page of links to other free Dhammapada resources.
