,technosailor,2011-06-24T03:55Z,"@horald: Listen you stupid faktard, all my torrents were seeded long ago, and I made sure several seeders have it before I stopped seeding, all my torrents are legit,  I stopped seeding because in my Country Bolivia the internet bandwidth is expensive and I only get 160 Kbps download and about 56Kbps upload, so I need to stop seeding in order to download other torrents, how do you know my torrents are fake? you probably say they're fake because you can't download them, you're a ignorant dumbass that writes shit out of ignorance because you can't think in the proper way to say things, get a clue of torrent terminology before ""opening your big mouth"". How do you know I ""log people's IP"", how do you know I ""scam"" them? you don't, you don't know me in real-life, if you did you'd know I don't, never had and wouldn't, you write shit, that's what you do, you're a big mouth asshole

@All: I'll have more bandwidth in July, better seeding hopefully.

Don't listen to this idiot 'horald', he doesn't even have any files seeded in TPB. He tried to download the files 2 minutes after I published it and I started to seeding hours later because of my limited bandwidth I need to stop seeding for many reasons, this dumbass is only frustrated and came here to write shit so I can hurry to seed it again, just ignore morons like this one.

Everyone stopped downloading at 1.7% because you believe and idiot that doesn't have a single torrent  here? well don't, I took really long time to have the whole file, mostly was stuck at 96.xx% now is complete and I added more trackers so it has better seeding and announced it in 'Suprbay.org' too, I seeded exclusively last 18 hours and almost nobody downloaded it, only 5 people. Many had the original unfinished now thanks to me and few other seeders they've downloaded but not seeded for long the original (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5271090/The.Biography.Channel.Dana.Plato.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM), I'm still seeding it that one anyway.

The .rar files are untouched, you can check their integrity with the .sfv file, the movie has great video and audio, I loved Dana Plato and I loved seeing her sad Biography to know more about her.

Don't believe everyone who writes comments, I'll have it seeding a few days, just to show you I'm telling the truth, just download it and see for your self.

The movie is 43 mins long. The following is information from MPC x64 v.1.4.2824.0 (MSVC 2008 SP1, GCC 4.6.0):
