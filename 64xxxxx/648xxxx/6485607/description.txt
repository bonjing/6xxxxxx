a few mods i downloaded from www.crymod.com before they started updating for crysis 2 and you cant download from them anymore ):


1 Chaos:from Xigmatek; Extra particles, bigger explosions and such.

2 Hk_ump-45: a new weapon with new attachments; very nice.

3 Realistic: makes bullets penetrate stuff and much more;
  the bullets go infinite though and because of this it makes you'r comp. go slow.

4 Scar cmag: A bigger mag for the scar rifle 100 bullets (:

5 Slowmotion: just as it says slowmotion for crysis, you can change how slow too!

6 Xtremenuke:from Xigmatek; a (very big) nuke for crysis with wind and physics
  effects!
  'Warning: high lagg if shot'

7 Xtremerockets:from Xigmatek; replaces the ordinary rocket with an xtreme one!
  uses wind and physics effects too!

Thats all, hope you enjoy it!

i'll be seeding a 20 to 1 ratio or until www.Crymod.com comes back up!

please seed when it finishes downloading.
