    Too bad its not XXX :) Divxlord rel from ~y ago is nuked for various     
    reasons, none of them which makes movie unwatchable though. But this     
    is done for the archive guys. Who never watch movies anyway , they       
    just like to have them.. makes sense, right :$

    World War II: Allied Command learns that in 60 days three Japanese       
    generals and an admiral party at a bordello on a tiny Philippine         
    island. It's fortified and hard to attack, so a creative, cynical        
    major gets the assignment to figure something else. With the help of     
    Paco, a Filipino guerrilla leader, the major devises a plan to put       
    four women assassins among the prostitutes. He must recruit and train    
    them, convince his general that an unarmed woman can best a man, and     
    get them on the island. The rest is up to them. An imprisoned killer,    
    a nurse with a fatal disease, a chippie on the lamb from the mob, and    
    a Filipina whom the Japanese assaulted are his team. Can they do it?
