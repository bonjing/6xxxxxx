,leaveiton,2011-06-22T17:52Z,I got Invalid Torrent. Magnet Link seems to work fine.
,HiVoltg33,2011-06-22T17:53Z,Awesome! Thanks WMI
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-06-22T17:54Z,"Strange. I tried it on another computer, and it loaded fine. Thanks for the heads up though."
,LeonGT,2011-06-22T18:26Z,Cute! works fine for me.. maby you are invalid?
,MotleyC,2011-06-22T18:44Z,I think she is very cute but this set is nothing groundbreaking for the fame girls website. It appears that we have another model who will tease us each week but probably never give up the goods. She is a nice addition but hard to judge it based on one set.
,ragnarok_falls,2011-06-22T19:33Z,Is it time to complain about the fact that she never shows any pussy yet?
,KWAKZX10,2011-06-22T19:44Z,"many thanks, wmi, she's a real QT"
,Gunnar_Sigmundson,2011-06-22T20:12Z,"I agree completely with your assessment posted in your blog. 

Not very inspiring. Of course it's difficult for anyone to be compared to Sandra and Ella. "
,joesee,2011-06-22T20:33Z,"tsk tsk
An overpaid model that will never compare to the likes of Ella or Sandra.  Not even close to being in the same class."
,btbam006,2011-06-22T21:08Z,"Interesting they decided to add a new model. I was checking out some of her newer sets coming out and by the looks of this one...

http://fame-girls.com/prw.php?show=file&path=/updates/525/540-lg.jpg

Looks like maybe she will be a good addition to the team and set the standard ;) "
,captainkhaos1966,2011-06-22T22:36Z,Thanks WMI. She looks like a nice addition to FG. Maybe with a new girl this might spark some competition between the girls to get more daring. One can only hope
,gregman,2011-06-23T01:24Z,Thats a tampon string hanging out of her right?
,33wearhilton41,2011-06-23T03:24Z,you have to kidding are'nt you.what a heep of shite
,eviction0,2011-06-23T03:38Z,"All I care about is, is she pretty?

Judging from the previews, the answer is no.

(I should have specified, by pretty I meant O.O pretty.)"
,eviction0,2011-06-23T03:39Z,Not that she's ugly either. She's definitely on the good side of middling.
,Gunnar_Sigmundson,2011-06-23T05:15Z,"I wonder if they added her because Sandra might quit after she has her child? 

That would be a shame. "
,hghatrsk,2011-06-23T06:24Z,"@Gunnar_Sigmundson - Sandra quit modeling long ago. Everything they have of her sets has all been taken and stored by the studio. You haven't seen a ""new"" Sandra set in some time."
,Holy Divr,2011-06-23T09:16Z,"She's not even hot. But still, thanks Web. +1 to you"
,fcalen,2011-06-23T10:04Z,NO !!!
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-06-23T10:34Z,"New blog post regarding her nude modeling and such:
http://blog.webmodelsindex.com/?p=113"
,davidhot,2011-06-23T14:22Z,"Thanks webmodelsindex!

I don't like Janice, I don't think she is Fame-Girls material.

She lacks that mixture of innocence, cuteness and hotness that Ella, Sandra and Virginia have, plus she looks kind of trashy."
,LOLTHATWASLAME,2011-06-23T15:28Z,"All I had to say is ""wat"" when I saw this.

Then I said it again when you said she did some nudes. 

I guess they are running out of sets, and need some whore to do it for them :(
"
,Sumiha,2011-06-23T16:41Z,"+1 to WMI

- infinity(but you can't count that number can you?) to FG site.


SuMiHa"
,mnamna,2011-06-23T16:54Z,Boring.
,yarisdude,2011-06-23T20:25Z,First Fame-Girl to go Hardcore! :D
,smitacular,2011-06-24T01:33Z,"A quick search of ""melita"" on imagefap resulted in this set with her shoving a dildo in her ass

,Dont_wanna_know,2011-06-24T06:16Z,"Not very pretty, stupid fuckin' tattoo, can't seem to figure out how to actually get all the hairs when shaving her pussy/asshole. An embarrassment for Fame Girls, really. I won't waste bandwidth or drive space on her ever again."
,MisterPoe,2011-06-24T10:46Z,Someone on another site said she was already taken off the site. A quick look seems it's true. Good riddance
,robbee23,2011-06-24T21:26Z,She's ugly and I hate her tatoo. Fame girls needs a younger model in the fold.
,congusano,2011-06-25T02:25Z,why did you take down the Janice page on your WMI site?  
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-06-25T05:46Z,Because Janice was removed from Fame-Girls. It would have been misleading to keep her up there with a link to the Fame-Girls site.
,toasterstrudel,2011-06-27T10:58Z,"i had to see for myself, that was impressively bad."
