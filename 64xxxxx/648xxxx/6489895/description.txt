Organizational activity - your horse? Or do you leash-leash decided to try his hand at a new career? Good chance! Team of professional riders want the manager! Develop strategy and tactics of the upcoming races, nominate athletes ...
  In terms of physics does not seem to play the next game. In the time trial there is even the opportunity to choose the number of teeth.

It may seem that the list of features is too small, and CM4 can not be called a novelty, but in fact it has lots of impressive depth and nuances (such as biorhythm athletes, changing throughout the race, or self-shifting mode to "Time Trial") .

Understand all of this is incredibly interesting. New game interface is perfect, and sometimes the game gives absolutely unforgettable moments when, for example, in the midst of the season your best cyclist hurt his knee on the pass and knocked out the competition for two months. It is doubly sad that it happens right before the start of a major championship, to which you have been preparing for months: periodically traveled to training camps, have appointed an experienced coach, used a "fitness peak" and spent a lot of money.
