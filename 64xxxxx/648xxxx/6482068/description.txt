This is a working crack without the logon/activation prompt when you try  to start the game. I haven't had any errors yet and have been using it for  a day now. Extract & copy over all of the folders straight to the game  directory & replace all of the original files. Remember if having problems disablein outbound in firewall & set compatability as administrator This has worked on the Skidrow Release for me, I have not used clone dvd or the kaos rip. It should work on those as well. Now it's time to say hello! goodbye! I'm late to play the game!
