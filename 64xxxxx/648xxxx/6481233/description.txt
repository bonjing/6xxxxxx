Hell on earth.

Thatâ€™s what itâ€™s like for Luce to be apart from her fallen angel boyfriend, Daniel.It took them an eternity to find one another, but now he has told her he must go away. Just long enough to hunt down the Outcastsâ€”immortals who want to kill Luce. Daniel hides Luce at Shoreline, a school on the rocky California coast with unusually gifted students: Nephilim, the offspring of fallen angels and humans.

At Shoreline, Luce learns what the Shadows are, and how she can use them as windows to her previous lives. Yet the more Luce learns, the more she suspects that Daniel hasnâ€™t told her everything. Heâ€™s hiding somethingâ€”something dangerous. What if Danielâ€™s version of the past isnâ€™t actually true? What if Luce is really meant to be with someone else?
