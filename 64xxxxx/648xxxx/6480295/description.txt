[i]Brilliant Moon: Glimpses of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche[/i] chronicles the life of the writer, poet, and meditation master Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, one of Tibet's most revered 20th-century Buddhist teachers. Known as the teacher of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Royal Family of Bhutan, his life and teachings were an inspiration to all who encountered him. Two of his admirers are Richard Gere and Lou Reed, who provide the narration for his dangerous journey out of China and the subsequent spread of his influence around the world. 

[i]Brilliant Moon[/i] was filmed in Tibet, India, Bhutan, the United States and Nepal, and uses animation, rare archival footage, and photos, along with new interviews with some of Tibet's great teachers, to tell Khyentse Rinpoche's moving life story, from birth to death to rebirth. 

Written and directed by Neten Chokling (Milarepa movie), a student of Khyentse Rinpoche, and filmed in Tibet, India, Bhutan, Nepal and the United States, Brilliant Moon uses animation, previously unseen archival footage and photos along with new interviews of Tibet's great teachers, to tell Khyentse Rinpoche's moving life story, from birth to death to rebirth. This is an intimate, moving and revelatory look at a transcendent spiritual being.
