,severed1314,2011-06-20T09:17Z,Been waiting forever for this to premiere. Thanks!!!
,j0ket,2011-06-20T18:15Z,"TY!

But seed! like 3H for 2,5 gb.. :((( 
Ye you with 1mb/S + !!
You help more then you know.. "
,manwich49,2011-06-22T14:50Z,"DD 5.1 audio is b0rked in this torrent. Several video glitches also, not up to the usual eztv standards but then again, the show itself kinda sucked. 

Seemed like a bad ""V"" clone."
,truthy,2011-06-22T15:41Z,"thx for sharing, too bad it's not standalone compatible even if you remove the header compression with mkvmerge. video encoding option cabac=1 ist the culprit in this case - stuttering playback. well it plays fine on pc."
,ricmello,2011-06-22T21:25Z,No comments yet?!
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-06-24T01:02Z,"Very poor download speed compared to the other posters. Won't be getting many form this source anymore as all of the eztv posts that I have tried from here as of late have terrible download speeds, and yet they show thousands of seeders. As they say, That don't compute."
,Superflow,2011-06-24T20:17Z,"Hmmm I don't think I will follow this series. I didn't like the rape angle, it was illogical and a bad deus ex machina. Also somebody should have kicked Pope's ass.
Whomever wrote the script to this should be replaced immediately."
,tomtom75,2011-06-26T10:42Z,"I agree with Superflow. This was bad. I'll watch a few more episodes, but if this isn't getting better, i won't waste any more my time."
,mrdoubleb,2011-06-27T21:25Z,"As said before, does not play on (some) HW players, even after ""cleaning"" it with MKVmerge. Tried and failed with Samsung B series LED TV0s media player. :(("
,Thor-csf,2011-06-28T07:23Z,"As it has been reported by other users, this release is bad. Couldn't watch on my LG LE series LED TV - video keeps freezing at some parts and restarting from the beginning. Really annoying and impossible to watch.

Don't know if the cause is that, but I found the audio bitrate way too high - 8000 bps!

I hoped that I'd find a proper release, but nothing until now. :/"
,Thor-csf,2011-06-28T07:26Z,"Sorry, I meant the hertz - 8000Hz."
,velcroman0001,2011-07-03T03:39Z,PLEASE DON'T WRAP YOUR FILES in MKV format do you have ANY IDEA how often they can not be openned.  Just stick to .AVI like you have with other files
,raindog33,2011-07-06T21:00Z,"Thank you for this.  There is nothing wrong with this torrent. It plays absolutely fine on my system *and* with DD5.1 (WDTV Live).  Oh and Matroska is far better than AVI. If people have a problem with this format, then perhaps they should change or upgrade their software / hardware. "
,brod,2011-07-19T03:01Z,"@manwich49

Usual eztv standards? You know they just upload scene releases and don't actually do the encoding themselves, right?"
