I did Not download any of the 9 zip files from this torrent
because all of these themes are available free from www.Drupal.org.

... So why risk Viruses, etc, for no reason.

====================

The 9 themes available from this ThePirateBay.org torrent
are simply nine of the 175 free and freely available 
Drupal-7 themes contributed by members of the Drupal community.
 (AKA 'Contrib' themes)

They are always available in their most up-to-date versions 
at the main Drupal site, drupal.org.

Just go to the main Drupal theme page at drupal.org at
http://drupal.org/project/themes.

===

The nine themes from this torrent, and 
their online pages where you can get their
most up-to-date versions are...

- AdaptiveTheme
http://drupal.org/project/adaptivetheme
