,igorpam,2011-07-04T22:11Z,Someone PLZ just list the filenames of the .bin files in the archive! Urgent help needed!!!! Thx
,ragemaniscool,2011-07-05T02:52Z,"Worked PERFECT!!!!!!! This is great! Don't forget to factory reset after upgrade. Also, write down your trigger settings so u can re-enter them after the reset. Also, for custom kits, write down the instrument names & not the number's like I did, cause the instrument numbers all change because of the new snares and bass drums. "
,ragemaniscool,2011-07-05T03:19Z,"Also, you guys need to keep this seeding. It took me 2 days and I am not on a steady internet connection were I can keep it going all the time. Thanks to whoever in France though, I was stuck on 80% until you seeded! "

What I've been hearing is that this update is version 2.04 rather than 2.05 the original users are getting.

If there is any truth to this then this release is different to Roland's 2.05 release.

Plus the uplaoder took it upon themselves to remove the PDFs that came with the original for some unknown reason.

I'll let you decide whether this is the final release.
