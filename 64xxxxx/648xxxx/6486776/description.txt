                Series in which Australian comedian Chris Lilley
                plays a host of characters, all confronting various
                dilemmas facing young men in the 21st century. Kerry
                Sims invites a deaf teenager to spend a day at the
                farm with Nathan. Nathan starts retaliating for
                Daniel's behaviour, apparently taking the high ground
                although actually anything but. Jen shows her son Tim
                the lickable shoes range he'll be endorsing, which
                includes sushi and lychee flavours. Rapper S.Mouse
                encounters creative differences with girlfriend
                Lasquisha while making his newest recording.
