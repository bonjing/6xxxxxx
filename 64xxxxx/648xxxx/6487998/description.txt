Dead bodies are showing up in shallow graves on the empty construction lot of Vincent Plum Bail Bonds. No one is sure who the killer is, or why the victims have been offed, but what is clear is that Stephanies name is on the killers list.

Short on time to find evidence proving the killers identity, Stephanie faces further complications when her family and friends decide that its time for her to choose between her longtime off-again-on-again boyfriend, Trenton cop Joe Morelli, and the bad boy in her life, security expert Ranger. Stephanies mom is encouraging Stephanie to dump them both and choose a former high school football star whos just returned to town. Stephanies sidekick, Lula, is encouraging Stephanie to have a red-hot boudoir bake-off. And Grandma Bella, Morellis old-world grandmother, is encouraging Stephanie to move to a new state when she puts the eye on Stephanie.

With a cold-blooded killer after her, a handful of hot men, and a capture list that includes a dancing bear and a senior citizen vampire, Stephanies life looks like its about to go up in smoke.
