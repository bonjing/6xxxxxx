A:9
V:8

Video lags a lot using VLC but nothing too major

Thanks Uploader!"
,S6ltlane,2011-06-22T21:43Z,It's episode 4 !
,tomcroucher,2011-06-22T23:27Z,Don't download unless you're desperate. This is a terrible copy out of sync and very choppy. Sound is rubbish as well
,somebodyelse222,2011-06-23T01:06Z,"It is Episode 5 - and audio is out of sync - despite that it keeps us up to date, so thanx to the uploader"
,midge218,2011-06-23T01:41Z,"stop complaining, its the only copy out there at the moment, if you can wait then dont download"
,Behan93,2011-06-23T13:52Z,"From the comments I think I will wait to download, but for those who can't wait.... VLC Media Player has an audio sync feature so you should be able to sync up the sound."
