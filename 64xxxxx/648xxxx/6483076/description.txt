Release Notes:

The Grates spent the better part of two years immersing
themselves in Brooklyn culture and taking a bite of the
Big Apple. It's fitting that their new album "Secret
Rituals" should take on a few traits of the city that
never sleeps. Tough in its intent and infectious in its
delivery, their third album holds the promise of drawing
an army of new fans to their beck and call. Sassy, sexy
and bold, "Secret Rituals" sheds The Grates' inhibitions.
Incorporating bass, layered keyboards and electronic
touches the single is adventurous in its musicality.
Recorded over the course of several months in Brooklyn,
"Secret rituals" is the first album as a two-piece since
the departure of original drummer Alana Skyring.
