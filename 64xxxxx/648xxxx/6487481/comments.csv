,rdmarino,2011-07-03T10:28Z,"zMTz: Thanks, I tried the first serial you posted for Windows, and worked like a charm. :)"
,slarty55,2011-07-10T02:23Z,"@zMTz: so i guess adobe has already canned those serials you posted, cause they return a ""This serial number is not valid for this product"" when i download and install the CS5.5 Master Collection trial..."
,grrranimal,2011-07-11T21:42Z,any new ones? non work
,brain3k,2011-07-14T17:21Z,zMTz you rock thanks for saving me time
,peterkeeee,2011-07-14T17:46Z,"slarty55

It worked for me today (i used the first number). However i use an older (...) http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5634050/Adobe_CS5_Master_Collection_2x_DVD_NLUPPER

btw what is 5.5? what is the difference"
,MumtazG38,2011-07-17T12:38Z,"It seems Adobe has fished out all of the serial numbers you listed. Same for those in the comment by zMTz. Any new ones out there to try?

Come on ppl, I'm sure there are a few brilliant ones out there that have some freshies!"
,jcoll01,2011-07-22T03:36Z,"the serials are not active for this product. in addition when i used the activator after disabling my antivirus (i have norton) it did not work. All of a sudden i could not connect to the internet, i could not even get google to come up as my firewalls and my server settings had been changed, when i changed them back to the way they were and applied the settings, when i restarted the computer they were changed back to what this program had done the first time. after looking at the programming code for it i saw that is was changing permissions in parts of the computer it had no business messing with.  >>>>DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND USE THIS TORRENT>>>"
,blackarrowpro,2011-08-02T01:00Z,"Hey guys, I figured out how to get the serials to work! 

Like most of you, I was happily using CS5.5, when all of a sudden I recieved a 'Please Enter A Valid Serial To Continue Use'. WTF? I'd already 'registered' my full Master Collection using a 'valid' serial. 

Anywho, cut a long story short, I searched TPB for ANY working CS5.5 serials, but NOTHING worked. Then I read a comment on another torrent page about changing the time on your computer, and that gave me an idea...

So, I changed back my computer time to Febraury, and TADA - the serial worked no problem! I hope this works for everyone as it has worked for me.

Happy editing/digitising/painting/scoring/looting.

;)"
,leo123458765,2011-08-02T19:14Z,blackarrowpro: tried it. it works but only until I set the date back again (to the correct one). Then I get 'Please Enter A Valid Serial To Continue Use'. Or am I missing something?!
,gegeo,2011-08-05T20:33Z,"Hi guy i got it to work with this: (CS5)

,xsnyper,2011-08-06T23:52Z,"@blackarrowpro  thanks for the tip :) it worked!

hey guys what blackarrowpro posted is true for the cs5.5 serials you need to set your computer date back to february and it works like a charm.
