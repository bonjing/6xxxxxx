Le Trio Joubran - AsFar
2011

I've listened to the Joubran brothers before, but I have to confess it was when I read Dhafer Youssef was involved that I couldn't wait. Dhafer is not playing, though. He lends his voice, which is perfect for three brilliant oud players. An awesome record you shouldn't miss.

("AsFar" means "Jouneys" in Arabic)

This is the first international release that does full justice to three of the most original musicians in the Arab world: Samir, Wissam and Adnan Joubran are brothers and oud players from Palestine who have developed a compelling, intuitive style that allows the Arabic lute to be heard in a new way, not just in backing work or solos but as a trio instrument in complex, emotional and remarkably varied compositions. Their last album was a poetry-and-music set, dominated by the writing of the late Mahmoud Darwish and aimed largely at the Arab world, but this recording displays their instrumental work at its best. Their playing is backed by percussion and the occasional drifting scat vocal from the Tunisian musician Dhafer Youssef, and their oud work changes within every track: sturdy, stately passages develop into improvisations that echo jazz or blues; brooding, atmospheric pieces like Dawwar El Shames could easily be used as classy film music; quietly epic tracks like Sama Cordoba build up into rapid-fire complex arrangements. In order to sound spontaneous, they chose not to rehearse before going into the studio.

AsFar, so good

Whilst the three Joubran brothers from Nazareth have established themselves as one of the most innovative groups to come out of the Middle East in recent years, their previous recordings have hovered just below the point of brilliance. However, on their fourth CD, which features fellow Palestinian Yousef Hbeisch on percussion and Tunisian singer Dhafer Youssef, the balance of passionate intensity, fiery musical interplay and moments of mystical reverie is all but perfect. From the exhilarating flamenco-tinged runs of the opening track, it is clear that these siblings share an extraordinary musical intuition and understanding. Oud players are notorious noodlers and three virtuoso brothers armed with 33 strings between them could result in a riot of unfettered plucking. But the disciplined way that they create space for Dhafer Youssefâ€™s soaring voice to pour through on 'Douja' is remarkable. 

Ouds are rarely heard playing together in ensemble but Le Trio Joubran create an almost orchestral sound that is both excitingly fresh and steeped in their musical tradition, all gloriously captured by flawless recording. The emotional range of AsFar shows a depth and patience that allow the music to reveal itself on its own terms â€“ a maturity reflected in cover photos that show the boys looking rather more workmanlike than in the past. This is the album we have been waiting for Le Trio Joubran to make.
