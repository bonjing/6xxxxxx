,vitaliid,2011-06-23T05:00Z,"Hi mkvonly, 

Thanks for all the hard work. I have downloaded a few of your torrents and they are all excellent, however, I have a little problem when I use mkvmerge to mux the video & audio files together. On my Windows 7 64 Bit after I successfully mux the files, the resulting file sort of locks my computer. Memory, all 8 GB of it, quickly gets used up as soon as I select the file to see the thumbnail for it and thumbnails are not generated. I can see the properties of the file with MediaInfo and I can play the file but that is not the best experience :). I did some searching and found a solution but it is not optimal. I have to run the file produced by mkvmerge through MetaFox and that fixes the file, which usually is a bit larger than the input file produced by mkvmerge. So, the question is, is there some settings I have to make on mkvmerge to make sure the muxed file is good? 
Note, I am using mkvmerge 4.8. Also, your video files are fine and my PC can display the thumbnails for it. 
Any suggestions?
Thanks   "
,vitaliid,2011-06-23T06:23Z,"Me again. This time with good news. You propably aware of the following but in case someone else has the same issue as me, here is the solution.

I looked at your later uploads (e.g. Megamind) and it also has the same issue on my PC. The reason is mkvmerge v4.8, which you also used for Megamind. I think after v4.1 they forced compression and that causes issues, that is why your earlier releases didn't have this problem. So, I did a small test and set compression to ""none"" for video and audio tracks for Megamind release and the issue went away.
Inspecting the files using MediaInfo I see that your main mkv file has ""Muxing mode: Header stripping"" for both audio and video (same as my files after I muxed them) and after I muxed it together with compression set to ""none"" the property disappeared, which also fixed the memory/thumbnail problem. Also, v4.8 has a setting in File->Options->""Disable header removal compression for audio and video tracks by default"", which does it automatically.

Regards"

That sounds weird. I've muxed hundreds and even on 1.5 GB ram pc and never had any issue.
I use the same version as you and is perfect.
Only one think I can think of, when there are more then 30 subs muxed in mkv then mpc won't play it most of the times. This file has 28 subs though.
Is it installed in C: Programs(86) ? With all muxes you have this problem or only with specific mkv-s? Examples?
Always run the audio first through delaycut before mux it. You better ask @ http://forum.videohelp.com/ , they know more.
cheers"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-06-23T06:35Z,"Lol, we wrote at the same time. I didn't think of this, interesting. I'm glad you fixed it clever boy ;-)"
,vitaliid,2011-06-23T06:46Z,"I was wondering if you are answering my first or second post :). 
It is for all your the files that I would mux (well...yours are the only ones I need to mux, which is cool) and now also for the latest releases that you put up.
I think it is related to the codecs I have installed on my PC (do not even remember what I have).
Well, thanks for paying attention and more importantly for the work you do."
,kejser11,2012-02-05T17:49Z,"@FatFreddy69:
First of all thx a lot for your upload. I am new to .mkv-files, however, so I wonder if you could tell me how to get this dowm on a DVD to watch it on my TV. Can I de-mux the file so I can select which audio and subs I want included? :-)"
