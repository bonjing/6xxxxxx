They started the trouble in a calculated, ruthless and underhand manner (check the historical facts!) just as the 2008 Olympics were kicking off in Beijing, thinking they could get away with it, but alas, the did not! 
 Side bonus would be to portray Russia again as a warmongering country. Luckily the plan failed miserably and so now they have to make big Hollywood movies to sway peoples opinions.  these movies are simply brainwashing for the masses. If you think Russia started this, you don't have the slightest idea who Shakashwili is and where are his connections. 
This film tries to reflect the opposite, though a daring adventure........typical Hollywood distortion of truth to suit the USA hegemony and its globalist agenda. "
