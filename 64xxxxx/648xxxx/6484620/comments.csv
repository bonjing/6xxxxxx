P.S.

,ZenzSeezYa,2011-06-26T15:45Z,"Worked perfect for me, ty. =]"
,TNC,2011-06-26T17:46Z,It doesn't seem to work with 64-bit applications since the bdcap64.dll-file isn't also cracked. It doesn't recognise applications that runs 64-bits systems
,TNC,2011-06-27T22:00Z,"In my case, I run Minecraft on 64-bit Java, and I have to since my 64-bit operating system have decided not to run minecraft smoothly on 32-bit Java. I have tried to find a crack but can't even find the crack you have included here. So it would be really great if you could manage to get hold of a cracked bdcap64.dll. Then this torrent would be the torrent of the year (for me at least ;P)"
,Dislikeyou,2011-07-07T06:38Z,This works fine on 64bit windows. Just delete bdcap64.dll and it will not complain. Found this trick on another website. :)
,TNC,2011-07-08T18:38Z,"@Dislikeyou
You won't be able to record 64-bit applications. Deleting bdcap64.dll doesn't do shit."
,miguelsz3,2011-07-08T19:11Z,"@TNC
Have you tried installing it as a 32bit (86x) application on your pc? I cant test whether or not that works since I dont have a 64-bit system =/"
,TNC,2011-07-08T19:40Z,"@miguelsz3
Bandicam is a 32bit application, so you cant install it as anything else, no mather what format you're system is running. And for all I can see their solution to this is to have a bdcap32.dll and a bdcap64.dll so that bandicam can read both formats of applications. And since only the 32bit .dll is cracked the program will never be able to record 64bit applications."
,miguelsz3,2011-07-08T20:03Z,"@Lwc
Yah, I kinda knew that would be the case. *Sigh* Gonna go search for 64-bit crack agian.

P.S.
Damn that was a fast response."
,Tiddlyfisher,2011-08-03T22:19Z,"Thank you so much! FRAPS was not working for me at all, and then I found this! I owe you my life! :D Seeding now, just for you, you bad bitch!"
,zelive,2011-08-10T18:35Z,I don't understand replace what files. Is this even a registered version of Bandicam.
,miguelsz3,2011-08-10T22:48Z,"What? How the hell could it be a registered version of bandicam? Its a ""cracked"" version. The Instructions are damn easy to follow >.>

Anywho, replace the file ""bdcap32.dll"" in your programs folder with the one in the extracted folder ""Bandicam 1.7.rar""

 Then delete ""bdcap64.dll"""
,patcab96,2011-09-10T06:47Z,i cant record audio.. please help
,syntoc,2011-09-17T12:05Z,"This doesn't work for me on Win7 x64.  If I leave bcap64.dll in the directory running the program does nothing, it won't launch and there is no error message.  If i remove bcap64.dll I get an error telling me the program is invalid and needs to be resintalled."
,miguelsz3,2011-09-19T11:08Z,"@patcab96
Check under the ""Video Tab"" you should see a button called ""settings"". Choose the audio device you want the program to record. Also make sure you have ""Record Sound"" checked. If that doesnt work try to change audio codecs. 

@syntoc
If you read the previous comments you'd know it aint cracked for 64bit systems."
