[color=yellow]NOTES:[/color]

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Green Lantern 2011 

Right video,we were kindly given the source files which were ok but need alot of TLC.The video was filmed at
angle and the borders all round were all slanted etc....the video was washed out and was badly interlaced.
Also contain 5 lines of subs which were hardcoded in russian.
Now work done....first thing was pull the video level and change the perspective,which left us a video with pretty
much straight borders which then were cropped and then resized the video to give it a better AR.
After than we deinterlaced and it still had some faint line in parts so we had to recall it and blend aswell to remove all.
Then we did our normal stuff of tweaking the rgb colours,chroma,brightness,contrast,sharpness etc...
And finally we made a subpack for the non english subs and hardcoded them in yellow.
Audio is very nice LiNE we filtered, synced and muxed to our encode :P
Enjoy folks :)"
