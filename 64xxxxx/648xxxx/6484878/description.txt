\'Staircase\' is a pulsing, rythmic track taken from their forthcoming \'From The Basement\' sessions, and this live performance sees the band augmented by the appearance of a second drummer, Get The Blessing\'s Clive Deamer, who Philip Selway describes as \"one of my favourite drummers\". 

The programme will air on July 1.
