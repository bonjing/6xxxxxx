I'm trying to do, 
but my personal capacity is limited,
I just strive to do, but I also have a lot of difficulties,
you come from different countries around the world, 
I think you have the best music video collection, 
I hope we work together communication exchange, 
the music is no age barriers, no language barriers, 
but no national boundaries, 
they are the good common world language, 
because music in our lives, life, soul, 
I believe you will be sharing the spirit of the infection, 
since you want to come here to get something, 
even a little bit, I hope you can leave something to share to other people, 
so we will have a better continuity, you will more belongs to you.
