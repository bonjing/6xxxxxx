I'm trying to upload some Buddhist texts in MOBI / Kindle format. These three reference works will be useful for beginning or experienced students.

A Manual Of Buddhism - Venerable Narada Maha Thera

A Young People's Life of the Buddha - Bhikkhu Silacara (Not just for young people!)

The Tree of Enlightenment - Major Traditions of Buddhism - Peter Della Santina

Please seed, and please check my torrents for other books on Buddhism and other spiritual traditions.
