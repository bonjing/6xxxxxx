 The Making of this film:
 In the beginning of 2008, Juri Schmidt presented his concepts and work to Klaus John. After intensive preliminary talks and own participation in a workshop, the project matured. Juri developed a special shoulder stand to take professional recordings without disturbing the participants during a two-day workshop. There were strict requirements for quality because it was a diploma thesis. In addition, there was the claim that the experience of the participants should be shown factual and ethical correctly. Also according to the participants, this goal was fully achieved. For presenting the experience focussed on practice and for the dramaturgy, theory and a presentation along a timeline was largely abandoned. Juri Schmidt shows his perspective of events with intensive support and advice by Klaus John. 

 The observer will also get his own view of things. Topics such as death and abuse can stir up and polarize. Finally it is important to know that it is a healing process and all the participants are fine after such an experience. This booklet and the epilogue provide information to watch the film in the context of the topography of the unconscious developed by Stanislav Grof. In the epilogue, Klaus John discusses the difference between psychedelics and Holotropic Breathwork and shows some missing perspectives.
