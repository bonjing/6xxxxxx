              Lawyer Sam Bowden's life becomes torturous      
               when Max Cady re-enters his life. Cady          
               went to jail for 8 years after Bowden           
               testified that Cady attacked a young           
                 woman. Cady begins to terrorize Bowden and      
                 his family, particularly targeting              
                Bowden's daughter, Nancy. Initially, Cady       
                uses his newfound knowledge of the law to        
               annoy the Bowdens, then poisons the family
