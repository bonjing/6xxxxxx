PLEASE KEEP RELEASING AMW!!!"
,tyler453,2011-09-25T21:19Z,"still seeding this episode but there must be 7-8 new episodes by now that for some reason havent gotten the attention of ANY of the torrent groups. why is that??? i mean, amw is reasonably popular and there are people who cant watch it for the sole reason of living in Europe.

PLEASE RELEASE NEW AMW EPISODES!
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!"
