"Is our debt bubble about to burst? If interest rates go up, or interest payments might explode! Radio talk show host, Neal Boortz, tells us what this means, for our ballooning $14.3T and ever growing debt. And, more and more Republicans are against war unless the Congress declares war. Congressman Scott Garrett is here to explain. And TX Governor Rick Perry sure sounded like a presidential candidate this weekend. Fox political analysit Doug Schoen stops by to tell us if the governor will take the lead in this Texas-two-step towards the 2012 presidential bid. All that, and our Freedom Fighters [...] Big Brother and big banks: the Fed is embedding more regulators in private banks. Will this tactic really prevent another financial collapse? Sounds like more government overreach that violates these principles..."

On 20110731, the servers providing the ReplayTV Electronic Program Guide data will be shut down forever, stranding my DVR without a schedule. Alternative sources for guide data are being explored by the owner community, but there are some doubts as to the ultimate usability of the units after this date. _IF_ it becomes impossible to schedule unattended recordings with my unit, then the flow of torrents describing this show and others will stop after this date.
