[T],thetorrentlord,2011-07-20T07:48Z,"Just now got around to un-raring, and the file was corrupt. Did two forced rechecks with U-torrent and it says the file is 100%. Anyone else have trouble? Don't you check your uploads at all. This is the 14th rared file that has been incomplete when trying to un-rar. All from sceneline."
