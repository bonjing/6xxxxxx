Had some trouble ripping â€œHits & Assorted Secretsâ€ using EAC so the last 5 tracks are ripped with CDex. This is a newer, more complete Northern Pikes torrent than the one I made available a few years ago but its not quite complete. If anybody has any Northern Pikes that's not included in this torrent please do make available, especially their last studio album, 2003's "Its a Good Life". Granted, this isn't a true discography since its lacking the final album but its quite expensive to buy and to say the truth probably isn't very good compared to their earlier works (but I hope this isn't true). And just to add, Big Blue Sky is one of my favourite albums of all time! Love sitting back and listening to it right through... have been doing so for many years. Enjoy one of my favourite bands.



Thanks!

From Wiki:


The Northern Pikes are a Canadian rock band formed in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in 1984. The original members were Bryan Potvin, Jay Semko, Merl Bryck and Glen Hollingshead. Hollingshead left the band in 1985, and was replaced by Don Schmid in 1986. The band was active until 1993 and subsequently reunited in 1999.

The Northern Pikes released two independent EPs before being signed to Virgin Records in 1986, "The Northern Pikes" (1984) and "Scene in North America" (1985). Their first album for the label, Big Blue Sky, included the Semko-penned "Teenland", the band's first significant hit. The follow-up album Secrets of the Alibi contained two more minor Canadian hits, "Wait for Me" and "Let's Pretend" (both by Semko), as well as the slightly bigger hit "Hope Go Astray", written by Potvin.

Their 1990 album, Snow in June became their biggest seller in Canada and the US. That album's lead single, "She Ain't Pretty", was the band's biggest hit, and was written by Potvin. An innovative music video for that song received heavy play on MuchMusic and was nominated for a Juno Award. Overall, the band has been nominated for 5 Juno Awards, but have yet to record a win.

In 1992, the band released Neptune. The album's biggest hit, "Believe", was again written by Potvin. After touring to support the album, they announced their retirement as a group in July 1993.

In 1999, Virgin Records asked the band members for their input on a "greatest hits" package. The band decided to do a short promotional tour following the release of Hits and Assorted Secrets 1984-1993, but found themselves enjoying the more relaxed independence of making their own schedule that they continued touring. They have since released three independent albums, including a live one aptly titled Live, with promises of more to come.

In 2006, the band was expected to release a hybrid collection of songs from Truest Inspiration and It's a Good Life under the name Beautiful Music. It was to include a bonus DVD of footage from the recording of Truest Inspiration and some promo clips from It's a Good Life. However, this has yet to see the light of day.[1]

Recently, the band has struck up a musical collaboration with Les Stroud. Throughout 2005 and 2006 they performed together live several times, and a collaborative album is currently being produced under the tentative name Les Stroud and the Pikes. The official Northern Pikes website, the album is scheduled to be released in 2008







Big Blue Sky 1987


Big Blue Sky is the first major label album by The Northern Pikes released in 1987. It featured two hit Canadian singles - "Teenland" and "Things I Do for Money". The album was certified Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on December 24, 1987.

The songs "Love Will Break You" and "Heartaches Heartbreaks (Open Up)" were added to the album when it was released on CD in 1990. "Heartaches Heartbreaks (Open Up)" was the b-side to the "Teenland" single in 1987. "Love Will Break You" originally appeared on The Northern Pikes, the band's original independent release in 1984 and it was the b-side to the "Things I Do for Money" single. Additionally, the song "Dancing in a Dance Club" originally appeared on the band's 1984 independent release The Northern Pikes, while the songs "Lonely House", "You Sold the Farm", "Jackie T", and "Teenland" all appeared on the band's 1985 independent release Scene in North America.

The album is dedicated to the memory of Neil Morgan who played guitar, synth, and vocals for The Idols, an early incarnation of the band which also included Jay Semko, Merl Bryck, Don Schmid, and Robin Billinton.

Secrets of the Alibi 1988


Secrets of the Alibi is the second album by The Northern Pikes released in 1988. It featured two hit Canadian singles - "Wait for Me" and "Hopes Go Astray".

Although this was their second album, the Pikes were nominated for "Most Promising Group" at the 1989 Juno Awards. This was likely because no Juno Awards were presented in 1988, the year their debut album would have been up for nomination. They were also nominated for Best Video at the 1989 Juno Awards for their song "Wait for Me". They failed to win either award.

The album was certified Gold in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on July 18, 1991.

About one year after recording their successful debut album, the Northern Pikes returned to the studio in the Spring of 1988 to record the follow-up. The resulting production had a more serious tone than their first, no longer talking about "Teenland" but themes of growing up and a political awareness of the world at large.

The first track on the album is "Place That's Insane", apparently about a pretty waitress who works in a smokey bar, as the lyrics describe "The girl that works in the club downtown / Knows all about life, man, she's been around". The guitar sound in this track is representative of the live sound throughout the album. A remixed version of this track was released on the 12" single.

The first single "Wait for Me" is a sad remembrance of love lost written and sung by Jay Semko. As guitarist Bryan Potvin recalls: "Our demo process was always an intense thorough exercise and we came very close to some true magic with this song. The demo version was very relaxed and rather meloncholy. Another killer chorus though, can't lose no matter how you play it." The video was directed by Ron Berti and nominated for "Best Video" at the 1989 Juno Awards.

The second single was the offbeat "Hopes Go Astray" written by Potvin, complete with a strange video of the band members in household situations in the middle of a prairie field. The song was one of Potvin's first attempts at song writing and dated back to 1986, before the band was signed to Virgin Records. Jay Semko said "I think this was a breakthrough for Bryan as a singer and a writer. I recall the sessions at Bearsville with Bryan singing the break ('Now the princess washes dishes...') as a pretty cool evolution."

The band would tour extensively to support this album, including the opening spot for Robert Palmer's 1989 tour.

Tracks: 


1.	"Place That's Insane" (Jay Semko) â€“ 4:19

The nominations were: Group of the Year, Single of the Year for "She Ain't Pretty", and Best Video for "She Ain't Pretty".

The album was certified Platinum in Canada by the Canadian Recording Industry Association on October 31, 1990. To date, it is the band's only Platinum album.
