Jacqueline Marie 'Jackie' Evancho (born April 9, 2000) is a young soprano from Richland Township, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who gained international fame after a performance for America's Got Talent. Evancho sings in the 'classical crossover' style of singers such as Hayley Westenra and Sarah Brightman. She studies singing with a voice coach, and also plays the violin and piano.

On November 1, 2009, Evancho released her debut album called Prelude to a Dream. The album features mainly covers of songs such as Andrea Bocelli's 'Con Te Partiro' and 'The Prayer', Josh Groban's 'To Where You Are', Martina McBride's 'Concrete Angel', and a cover of "Amazing Grace" among others. Schubert's 'Ave Maria' heard on the album is not the original song, which is set to a secular text in German, instead, it's an arrangement of the Roman Catholic setting of the 'Hail Mary' prayer in Latin. The album debuted on The Billboard 200 at #121 on the chart dated August 28, 2010. It also debuted at #2 on Billboard Classical Albums Chart.

On August 10, 2010, on America's Got Talent, Evancho performed O Mio Babbino Caro by Giacomo Puccini. The aria is also on her debut album. She received a standing ovation after her performance, and was awarded a trip to Universal Studios in Florida for receiving the most fan votes from the submissions to the show from Y.o.u.t.u.b.e. She was then voted into the semifinals by viewers.
