Plot
In this mind-warping action thriller, Baby Doll (Emily Browning), a girl
slated for lobotomy in a 1950s-era asylum, leads a group of young female
inmates in an attempt to escape both their mental fantasy worlds and the
actual institution where they are prisoners. To accomplish her plan, Baby
Doll must steal five objects -- but is the man who's trying to stop her
real, or a figment of her imagination? Zack Snyder (Watchmen) directs.  

You Will Be Unprepared.
