Sandra D. Mitchell, "Biological Complexity and Integrative Pluralism (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Biology)"
Publisher: Cambridge University Press | ISBN 10: 0521520797 | 2003 | PDF | 260 pages | 1.03 MB

This collection of essays by a leading philosopher of science defends integrative pluralism as the best description for today's complexity of scientific inquiry. The tendency of some scientists to reduce all theories to a few fundamental laws of the most basic particles that populate our universe is not appropriate for the biological sciences, which study multi-component, multi-level, evolved complex systems. This book will be of interest to students and professionals in the philosophy of science.
