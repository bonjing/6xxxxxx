TRUE iso. (There is something circulating on other sites that says "DVD RiP" of this film, but it's not. That one is a crappy-looking bad-audio 640x480, and is missing the last chapter.) 

THIS IS A .ISO OF THE DIRECTOR'S CUT 31 DVD. 

Can someone who is good at making DVD rips please make a true good looking (and sounding) DVD rip of this and upload? Thank you!
