Thank you for replying.. 
I don't think a lot of people have home theatres so they don't know about the rarity of your uploads
Please do it if you get the chance :)"

,TheExponentiel,2011-07-02T02:52Z,"and the first from the original lineup since 2000's Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water..... Its not TRUE!!! Wes Borland was back in 2005 for the Unquestionable Truth and then he quit again to only come back in 2009.. Its not a big deal but.. Also Gold Cobra is the sixth studio album... See the Wiki!!

ps. I understand that your probably not a big fan thats why you didnt know that!!

Bring It Back!!!"
