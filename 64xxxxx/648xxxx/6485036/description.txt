Hal Hartley's retelling of the same story in three different cities, New York, Berlin and Tokyo, with accompanying foreign languages.  The subtitles are permanent, and only in Non-English situations. 

A drawback, on this, the only known DVD version of the film, is that it is in 4:3, and there is a debate as to whether it is open matte or pan & scan.  Apparently this was approved by Hartley, though I can't find a proper reference.

The only known bit of Hal himself acting, playing the boyfriend, Hal, of his future wife, Miho Nikaido. Some Butoh-esque dance sequences.

The stories go through a bit of scrambling, so don't expect the same exact formulation in each.  The words get used over and over again.  Especially the word "No!".

Flirtation aplenty. Some classic Hartley dancing, dialogue, and lavatory philosophizing.
