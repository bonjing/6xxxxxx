You gotta keep the entire 4:3 picture,don't cut the head and bottom. Its a mess in the CG sequences. The Fullscreen version was meant to be seen that tall in a 4:3 screen. Why did you chop off the head and bottom? Please re-do it in a "" 4:3 "" format GOT IT ??  And don't chop off the head and bottom just to make it look like widescreen. I've got a 4:3 TV and I want the entire image of  The Lost World:JP DVD you got,not a cropped version. PLEASE CORRECT THIS BIG ERROR! And take your time , don't rush."
