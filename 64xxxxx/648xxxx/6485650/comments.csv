""The center of the Milky Way (between the constellations of the Archer, the Scorpion, and the Snake Bearer) is about 5 degrees away in the sky from the path that the Sun takes (the ecliptic), so the Sun is always at least 5 degrees away from the center of the Milky Way, and the line through space from the Earth via the Sun to the center of the Milky Way always has a bend of at least 5 degrees in it."""

[V],joshua13,2011-06-23T18:40Z,"I'd have to search for it. it's on the web ""google and you shall find""

btw I don't mean any criticism of the uploader. All sharing of books has value. Thank you Djofullinn.
I'm just a little annoyed at all the people who hear things and never check on facts, (like FOX news) Many 2012 enthusiasts do fall into that category so this made me think of that."
