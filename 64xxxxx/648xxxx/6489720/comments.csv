,k3nd00d,2011-06-24T05:57Z,At least her step dad took a bullet in this version.
,k3nd00d,2011-06-24T12:57Z,"I made another encode of this cropped to 16x9 (1.77) aspect ratio. It looks great. Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6491955

You may prefer this non-cropped version (but everything is very small on small screens), or you may prefer the cropped version I linked to (things fill up small screens a lot better in the 16x9 format). Your choice. :-)"
