Wives and Daughters was Mrs Gaskell's last and most mature work, an absorbing and illuminating tale of scandal, honour and romance. It was first published as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. The final chapter was left incomplete when she died suddenly in 1865.

The story revolves around Molly Gibson, only daughter of a widowed doctor, living in the provincial village of Hollingford in the 1830s. When Mollyâ€™s father marries again, the innocent young woman acquires a stepsister â€“ the lively and worldly-wise Cynthia. Affection quickly grows between the two very different girls, but secrets in Cynthiaâ€™s family background begin to create difficulties.

* This is an excellent production from the golden age of BBC radio drama; the nine-hour running time really does full justice to the novel. The charming incidental music was an early work by Oscar-winning film composer Rachel Portman.
