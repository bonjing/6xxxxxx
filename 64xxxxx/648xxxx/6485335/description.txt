Earlier this year, Rise Against put out their excellent sixth album Endgame, which further solidified the Chicago quartet as the premiere agit-punk combo in the land.

They just released the second single from the album, â€œMake It Stop (Septemberâ€™s Children)â€â€”a track written as a reaction to the rash of teen suicides in the face of homophobic bullying last year, including Rutgers University freshman Tyler Clementi and Indiana high school student Billy Lucas.

To address the grander theme of bullying, Rise Against reached out to Dan Savage, noted sex columnist and founder of the It Gets Better Project, which has become a crucial program to help bullied teens of all stripes cope with their abuse and remind them that life is worth living.

The result is a powerful clip that tackles these issues in a real and inspirational way.
