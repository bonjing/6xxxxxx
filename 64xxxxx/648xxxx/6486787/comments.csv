,hengenissen,2011-07-01T21:03Z,"Actually its ""Welcome reality"", but thx for uploading and I'm lookin forward to hearin it!"
,Justin.Isley,2011-07-10T15:29Z,"this is a fake release, all those songs were already released. and its MISSING a SHITLOAD of songs!
download if you havent heard those songs yet, fine.
but i have those songs from the single releases. and i'm waiting for the whole album release in july

and dumbass. its dubstep not electronic

welcome reality will be an album, not an EP FAGGGGGGGGGGGGG"
,typhonx,2011-07-11T21:50Z,"Justin.Isley, you are a moron.  First, it's a promo release, like they send out to music shops and radio stations in advance of the full release.  And second dubstep IS electronic music.  It's called a SUBgenre.

Dumbass faggggggggggggggg."
