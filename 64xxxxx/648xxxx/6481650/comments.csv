:P"
,sqlife,2011-06-20T06:20Z,23000+ leechers. Lol.
,dolboebb,2011-06-20T06:31Z,спасибки!
,powers987,2011-06-20T06:32Z,Anyone know if this version was nuked like last weeks was?
,PiSquared,2011-06-20T06:52Z,Such a slow DL... or is it that my anticipation is so high?
,XericXshowtimeX,2011-06-20T07:39Z,"worthless leechers. there is over 4 times more leechers than seeders. the point of this site isn't to take, its to share. SEED THIS for fucks sake."
,Reviewer,2011-06-20T07:41Z,"This is real, not nuked. If your download is slow, either wait until the traffic slows down in a day or so. Or try one of the other 5 uploads until you get the download speeds you want.

Common sense.....


Now we just have to wait a year until season 2....."
,solarom,2011-06-20T09:10Z,"Thank you so much, uploader!"
,mikelfann,2011-06-20T09:17Z,thankyou!!!!!
,husdude,2011-06-20T09:25Z,they should have had more episodes in a season :(
,PiSquared,2011-06-20T09:32Z,"A: 9
V: 9

Comment:  Wait to watch this after the entire series is done, however many seasons it takes.  Waiting a year between seasons will torture you all."
,chotra,2011-06-20T09:43Z,seeed!!! this is so slow...
,DriverAus,2011-06-20T13:53Z,"Thx!
