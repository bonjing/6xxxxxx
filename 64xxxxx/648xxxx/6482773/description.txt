They're out there....
Waiting. Watching. Unseen by normal eyes, but all too visible to Slim MacKenzie, a young man blessed - or cursed - by Twilight Eyes.

They're out there....
Lurking in the darkest shadows of an eerie, moonlit carnival. Feeding their twisted needs with human suffering - and fiendishly plotting the downfall of the human race.

They're out there....
But don't scream. They'll hear you.
