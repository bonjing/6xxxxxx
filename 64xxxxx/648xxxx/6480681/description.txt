Release Notes:

While the band's last record,Folklore and Superstition, was a compelling tribute
to brotherhood and history, the new album is the summation of a year in the life
of the band - every emotion, triumph, loss, romance and everything in between -
it's all here on Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea.

First single "White Trash Millionaire," pairs Robertson's soulful delivery with
the urgent and infectious rhythms of his fellow players. Sure, this is Southern
rock at heart; but the concept is universal: just take what the world gives you
and make that work. "This album is the culmination of all of the everyday ups
and downs life throws at you," says the band. "Sonically, you'll hear some of
the meanest sounding guitar riffs we've ever laid down, and at the same time,
you'll find ballads that will tug on your heartstrings. We wanted the album's
intensity to match that of our live show."
