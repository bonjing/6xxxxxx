,Wopdedoda,2011-06-21T19:26Z,"Finally someone who understands x264 > xvid/divx. I have a question though, why do you do a H264 AND an x264 release when they're identical quality and the x264 version is half the size? Just seems like a waste of bandwidth. Great uploader, Thanks for everything, especially Restrepo. "
[T],MitZep,2011-06-22T07:29Z,"@wopdeda the h264 is mp4 with higher bitrate and better quality suitable for big lcd/led screens and has better compatibility with diff players...
the x264 is mkv more suited for pc and for people who have low bandwidth"
[T],frapper101,2011-06-23T07:07Z,"The Audio is out of sync (from the source 720p@7Sins)
Using MKVMerge remux it...Delay the Audio by  7110ms and it is fixed. or use VLC (j,k)
Cheers Uploader..thanks :D"
