Nevertheless, thanks for sharing. :)"

the peaceful ones have a non-interfernce policy. the ones who live for war don't fight infants. many people actually claim to have seen the ships/them. While I'm definitely NOT a believer, we should at least consider wether perhaps the reason we ask where are they? is because every time someone shouts there they are!! - We refuse to believe them. Evidence may be weak in most or perhaps all casesm but I suspect no amount of evidence would be sufficient. The prospect of ridicule, closed minds, and more stand in the way of any convincing skeptical scientists. In any case it is very possible we are wrong about what we should look for as evidence of ET civilization. We really know nothing about the subject "
