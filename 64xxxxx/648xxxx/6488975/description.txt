St. Louis bluesman Henry Townsend only released a handful of recordings from 1929 through 1981. St. Louis Blues Ace compiles material recorded in the '80s in St. Louis and the Netherlands. Switching between solo guitar and piano, Townsend composed all 15 titles, five of which had been released briefly on the Swingmaster label while the remaining ten are being issued for the first time. Townsend is one of the original early bluesman who remained true to his unique lyrical vision and has over the years showcased his musical ability alongside Big Joe Williams, Roosevelt Sykes, Robert Nighthawk, Sonny Boy Williamson, and Robert Johnson.
