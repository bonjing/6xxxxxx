My guess is your GPU can't handle this resolution...

Awesome upload!

Best regards,

Audio and video quality is very good! (But who needs 1080p full-HD for a simple ""old school"" cartoon?)
All three movies have the original English audio. However - as mentioned in the ""small print"" - not all movies have (English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Spanish and Dutch) subtitles."
