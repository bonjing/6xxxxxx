,torntpnk,2011-07-09T18:21Z,"as always, i purchase the artist albums as soon as i find them that i download, i think this was the fastest album i purchased since i started to download lol."
,KevanGC,2012-01-23T04:10Z,"@torntpnk If you buy it, why would you want the torrent?"
,Synthony,2012-01-28T07:50Z,"@KevanGC Maybe he downloads before buying so he can preview the album -- make sure it's worth his money. From a legal standpoint, that's the correct way to pirate media. xP
I do the same sometimes -- for example, I preordered Korn's newest album, The Path of Totality, but downloaded the torrent because the CD was released to stores before the preorder bundles were mailed out."
