,kwhiggs8,2011-06-25T13:19Z,"I'm having a problem with this.

Every time I double click AliceMadnessReturns.exe, nothing at all happens. It loads for a couple of seconds, then of all of the sudden, it stops loading.

Is there anything that I could do to fix this issue?"
[V],gansuk,2011-06-25T14:04Z,"you have to run the alice2 to start the game, the alice1 exe wont run itself it has to be selected from the alice2 menu."
,kwhiggs8,2011-06-25T14:54Z,That's exactly what I am doing. I'm running AliceMadnessReturns.exe on Alice 2 and it still won't boot up.
,McDowelstick,2011-06-26T04:22Z,"@kwhiggs

Alice Madness Returns is a PhysX supported game. 
When you try to run Physx games without (or with outdated) Physx drivers installed, they will behave in the manner you have described above."
,siqueirah,2011-06-26T04:59Z,"I give up !
I've tried skidrow release, skidrow crack, skidrow crackfix, theta crack, proper release + crack and nothing !
After I double click alicemadnessreturns.exe I get the message:
""Alice: Madness returns has stopped working and bla bla bla..."""

Which OS you use X64 or X86

Install Vc redist 2010  x64,x86

Install Vc redist 2008 X64,X86

Install Physx latest version

Install latest driver of GP card

Install the Latest Direct X

Install the C++ liabray class 


I have same problem in Dirt 2, 
It says Dirt2.exe is stopr working and in details is says app.crash 

Now I can Run Dirt 3 without any problem.

But at that time I am not update my GP driver and thats why its was crashing every time."
,siqueirah,2011-06-26T16:09Z,"I use Windows Seven Ultimate x64 and I really think everything is updated but I will re-update everything just to check and then I come back here with the results.
Thank you for your help."

,DangerDan43257,2011-06-26T16:44Z,"maybe your antivirus is killing one of the tools they use to rebuild the game? i had that prob with there cod release, i turned off my av until the game was installed then back on, game started up after that."

,Dr.DivZ,2011-06-29T09:01Z,Game works fine and is in english. Game is fun to play if you like a break from all the guns and zombie killing ;) Extracting took some time so be patient. It extracts to about a 9.6 GB folder. Run Alice2/Binaries/Win32/AliceMadnessReturns.exe To Play. This also contains American McGee's Alice from 2000. Another great RIP. Thanks Kaos Krew and gansuk.

Damn that took a while to decompress.
No viruses, trojans or problems.
And antivirus is still on.

BUT! It did ask my firewall to unblock EA connection.
Fuck them!
I'll pay for their stuff when they release the rights to Thrill Kill!"

Simple. ... :-)"
