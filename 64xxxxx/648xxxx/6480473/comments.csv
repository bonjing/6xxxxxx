,castiboy,2011-06-19T22:29Z,"season 10 starts broadcasting on September 25 2011.

fishy stuff, at best it's season 8 dvdrip or season 9 tvrip.

in any case, i'll go find a more trustful source..."
,the-bum,2011-06-20T04:26Z,Well its at kmart
,nightobreed,2011-06-20T10:20Z,Castiboy this has been out on dvd in australia for about a week now thanks for upload but will wait for some one to convert to avi 
,jshityeah,2011-06-21T10:56Z,"downloading now, if this is real ill comment again when done and possibly convert them to avi or mkv or something..."
,robbdog21,2011-06-23T09:35Z,*sitting at my computer waiting*
,jshityeah,2011-06-25T09:01Z,"i reckon, whoever you are, can you please start seeding a bit more? "
,JetxBlack,2011-06-27T07:17Z,cheers shall seed coz its slow as hell at the moment haha
,bigfourie,2011-06-28T06:31Z,"i see you can buy season 10, so might be legit 

please post if you are done downloading"
,bigfourie,2011-06-28T13:43Z,"this is not season 10 ALL BE WARNED this is a old season that has been edited

UPLOADER DIE IN A FUCKING FIRE!!!!
"
,tdmk1,2011-06-28T13:59Z,"Yep, this is not a genuine season 10 DVD set - so glad I helped seed this to the tune of almost 20x ratio (>200GB's of upload) - oh well..."
,hypokill,2011-06-28T17:00Z,"Just signed up to let you all know this is the genuine UK release that you may have seen for sale. There is a lot of confusion about family guy releases in the UK as we seem to be held back from seeing the current releases in the US.

There is more info from UK customer reviews on amazon.

http://www.amazon.co.uk/product-reviews/B004LROJYQ/ref=cm_cr_dp_all_helpful?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending

So i thought i would let you all know as this is exactly what i was looking for after seeing it being released in the UK. "
,n0_pAnCaKeS,2011-06-30T09:53Z,"Legit Season 10 DVDrip

,Kax2,2011-07-02T09:17Z,"Looks like season 8 to me

First disc holds the following episodes:

Business Guy
Big Man on Hippocampus
Dial Meg for Murder
Extra Lage Medium
Go Stewie Go

,pk14777,2011-07-03T18:57Z,very nice 10A 10V  i will compress and put it up as a avi in a few days its 100% real thank u Anonymous :)
,smiffy23bolton,2011-07-06T11:40Z,"this is the real deal, AWSOME MATE THANK YOU, it even has the dvd menu, its just like buying the original from asda lol

GENUINE SEASON 10!!!"
,ToyMachine0,2011-07-06T21:53Z,"This IS NOT season 10! I have downloaded and viewed all three disc. This is season 8 with the first three episodes from season 9 on disc 3. I don't know if they just skip season's in other countries or what but season 10 does not premiere until September 25, 2011. Look at the wikipedia for episode guides."
,referhead,2011-07-07T18:01Z,"this looks like VOLUME 9. its confusing because in the states each DVD is released in VOLUMES, overseas is seasons.

i could be wrong tho, just what it looks like to me"
,referhead,2011-07-07T18:04Z,"this is what is says on wiki about the season 10 release

This three disc set includes the remaining 12 episodes of Season 8 and the first 3 episodes of Season 9 (""Business Guy"" â€“ ""Welcome Back, Carter""), excluding Something, Something, Something, Dark Side but including the banned episode ""Partial Terms of Endearment"". Special features include commentary on six episodes, deleted scenes, animatics, and more.[8] Also available as a special edition featuring alternative cover art with a bonus t-shirt and script from the season.[9]"
,martyn666,2011-07-10T00:51Z,"castiboy< i am samantha martyns partner, you are totally wrong family gut season 10 started a month ago on bbc3, where have you been?!"
,martyn666,2011-07-10T00:54Z,"bigfourie, that is an evil thing to say to the uploader, depending where you are from some seasons like season 9 gets called 10 and 9, 8 ect, im samantha martyns partner, i think u r so vile to say such an evil thing to wish an uploader dead for nothing, grow up your fucking pathetic."
,martyn666,2011-07-10T01:00Z,hey toy-wateva ur name is are you stupid or something season 10 has been on bbc3 for the last month so fuck knows where your getting september from.
,socrates63,2011-07-10T05:52Z,Thanks for the letting us know Bigfourie 
,TheEnlightened,2011-07-12T02:48Z,"Ok guys, this is NOT the actual Season 10 of Family Guy but it is Volume 9 to those of us in the States. So it's quite clear that the UK & Australia get these Volumes or Seasons ahead of the US. As for the quality? They're great, totally uncensored, & fun to watch. Great job for whoever uploaded this! But if you're looking for the complete Season 8 in AVI form(As these are VOBs) just download it from here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6390128/Family_Guy_-_The_Complete_Season_8_UNCENSORED_%5BDVDRip%5D"
,TheEnlightened,2011-07-12T03:07Z,"So like I was saying, this is Volume 9 which starts with Season 8 Episode 9: Business Guy & ends with Season 9 Episode 3: Welcome Back, Carter. It also includes Season 8 Episode 21: Partial Terms of Endearment but it doesn't include Season 8 Episode 20: Something, Something, Something, Darkside. 

@martyn666

We don't all live in your country so please get more informed as the actual Season 10 of Family Guy doesn't premiere for those of us in the States until 9/25/2011."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-19T16:57Z,"Its FAKE its not Season 10 the uploader is a retard.
@nightobreed Fuck off you dumb shit.

,BrettasaurusRex,2011-07-23T07:12Z,"Season 10 Is currently available at JBHIFI In Adelaide, Australia.

I should know, I just spent $35 buying it for my Best Friend as a gift.

For a new DVD It's really cheap, Just buy it instead of sorting through fakes online."
,RareNinja,2011-07-23T18:59Z,"released on legit dvd as season 10 (UK) however, UK season 10 Is US Season 8-9. its weird the way its done but its cuz ages ago family got stopped in the US for a lil while when over here it didnt so the seasons are messed up between countries.... p.s. it make both people who say is s10 & isnt s10 right"
,now192002,2011-08-05T23:50Z,"I'm a little disappointed with this. After downloading and de-imaging them, I realize that it only has one audio track, meaning the commentaries were not ripped with the image. Sad face :-("
,si.mcnally,2011-08-11T10:27Z,"RAR format really annoying, episodes aren't seperate after unZip. Any chance of a normal file? Thanks for uploading tho"
,DemonicOverlord,2011-09-09T23:39Z,@TorrentJezuz you fucking retard season 10 has been releasing otherwise it wouldnt have been released on DVD! get your facts right you rucking dumbass. honestly some losers these days...

,keir1000,2011-10-02T20:26Z,"why the arguing,check episode list on wiki,the first two episodes of season 10 were shown 25/9/11 and 210/11,the season 10 you've brought is just from our season 9,its just released different that's all."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-10-17T11:08Z,"Season 10 aired the first episode September 25 2011.
Family Guy airs all the seasons episodes and then few months or so later they release the DVD.
This is not the new real season 10 just like what @RareNinja said"
,TorrentJezuz,2011-10-22T03:03Z,"The guy that said its available in Aus is a liar.
And all the rest i can tell you are POMS most likely because Family Guy was stopped for a bit so now everywhere else in the world sees this as Season 8 but you see it as season 10.
So many trollers on here, feel sorry for them because they have no life or friends."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-10-22T03:04Z,"NOT SEASON 10 !!!
ITS SEASON 8 !!!

Those of you who actually thought this was season 10 should know season 10 will air from sep 2011 to may 2012. This is season 8 part 2 and the first 3 episodes of season 9.  "
