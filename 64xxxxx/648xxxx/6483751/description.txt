"El Sereno"

When a horrific mass murder occurs at a 
primarily Hispanic office, the detectives 
immediately begin investigating the remaining 
employees, as well as their clients. After 
arresting a potential suspect, the case comes to 
a sudden halt when a claim of racial profiling 
is made against the unlikeliest of sources. 
DDA's Dekker (Terrence Howard) and Stanton 
(Megan Boone) are forced to navigate through 
tricky waters in hopes of proving their case.

D-I-N-O-S-A-CTU-R a dinosaur. Guess someone
is still waiting for their shitty  1click
to be updated. *Sigh*

Enjoy :)
