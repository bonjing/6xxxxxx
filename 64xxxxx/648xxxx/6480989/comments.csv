,VitualWorld,2011-06-20T13:49Z,"I only got part 1 to part 4, but if there more people that request those parts, I will upload them."
,azer000,2011-06-20T15:43Z,"Yes, please upload them, because in Belgium, part 3-6 won't be released. "
,jackalope77,2011-06-29T05:09Z,These are PAL format apparently.  Darn i was really looking forward to watching them.
,VitualWorld,2011-06-29T19:28Z,"Really? It should be region free.
It's an option I can check within my dvd ripper."
,Orsm_Torrents,2011-06-30T04:31Z,"can you please upload these torrents but in and iso format, that would be awesome thanks."
,VitualWorld,2011-07-02T13:59Z,"Ok, my last comment didn't make any sense.
It only removes the region code, not the PAL/NTSC difference.
So yes, it's PAL.
As soon as I can edit the post again, I will put that in the description.
Thanks for pointing it out :)"
