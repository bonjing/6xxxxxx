[V],DownTYU,2011-06-21T17:43Z,"1080p...
Just noticed the ridiculous mistake at the description.

Video is x264
Audio is AC3
Container is M2TS (BDAV)"
,jenchai,2011-06-21T18:18Z,4gb for 3hr movie each. It has to be ridiculously bad quality.
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-21T18:52Z,"@jenchai

I'm proud of you, you have made the best assumption of the century."
,mantikor777,2011-06-23T07:22Z,"@jenchai - be careful about displaying your ignorance.  M2TS files are much smaller than .mkv - you really can't make the assumption that you make based on size alone.

Thanks for the upload DownTYU.  Downloading now - will comment on quality after I see it."
,soupcip,2011-06-23T21:17Z,"Thanks. For the small file size the quality is amazing. But if you really need top notch go for the 77 gig trilogy. This is good, props to the encoder / uploader , but there is some blocking-noise , especially at faster scenes, so again, this is good , if you need perfection, you'll want to wait a bit longer and finish the bigger sized upload.
For bluray 1080 rip i'd say:

V 8
A 9"
,soupcip,2011-06-23T23:09Z,"I was a bit quick in my judgement. These videos looked ok in the beginning, to me, but as I am watching I'm getting more and more annoyed by the shortcomings. Not sharp, 2 blocky. You'd better dowload a comparable size 720p rip, it will have lots less blocks and noise and will be sharper. Still props to reducing it 2 so small a filesize, but the quality really takes a hit compared to the source. And thats missing the essence in doing a 1080p rip I believe.
So I have to downscale my rating:

V 6.5
A 9 (ratings compared to bluray)"

,heyman1981,2011-07-09T19:12Z,Piff can some do i 4gb ish per movie upload....
,xenoFLASH,2011-07-14T14:32Z,"just wondering, are the elvish subs hardcoded?"
,Vegeta9021,2012-04-28T22:10Z,"LAME, the quality is poor.

Uploader's a noob, this is too rubbish for 1080p, don't get it guys."
