""cr-qgo1y.zip: The archive is either in unknown format or damaged""."

Save your bandwidth, let this pass. Browse over to another release."

The file ""cr-qgo1y.zip"" is corrupted before you upload this torrent.
I triple check this torrent from TBP and other sources. Hash check is OK means that file was damaged before.
