I mean its nice that the download was fast, but still. I didn't download the series to not be able to hear the episodes."
,SwedishDreams,2011-06-23T10:22Z,"I wonder why Havik99 said that. I watched several parts of every second and seventh episode of every season to check if he was right, but I couldn't find any commentaries anywhere. Seems clean to me."

,PJHAIGHT,2011-08-05T02:41Z,"These videos definitely have commentaries on them, I'm a little upset because I seeded this with like a 4.0 ratio and spent all day downloading this. -___- Thanks though anyway!"
,ali478,2011-11-01T18:41Z,"great torrent here, only problem is the second part of the viva la europe episode has no sound at all. It's on S4E2, if you didnt know"
