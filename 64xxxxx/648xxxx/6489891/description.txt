Quantum Superposition: Counterintuitive Consequences of Coherence, Entanglement, and Interference
Publisher: Springer | ISBN: 3540718834 | edition 2008 | PDF | 393 pages | 2.6 mb

Coherence, entanglement, and interference arise from quantum superposition, the most distinctive and puzzling feature of quantum physics. Silverman, whose extensive experimental and theoretical work has helped elucidate these processes, presents a clear and engaging discussion of the role of quantum superposition in diverse quantum phenomena such as the wavelike nature of particle propagation, indistinguishability of identical particles, nonlocal interactions of correlated particles, topological effects of magnetic fields, and chiral asymmetry in nature.
