|   Many of us go through certain musical phases. A couple years ago, while    |
|   electronica was still in my roots, nu metal was my world. At that point    |
|   I, and so many others, felt that an album like Slipknot or L.D.50 were     |
|   the greatest album of all time. It sounds ridiculous, but it's strange     |
|   to think that I was so sure of it back then. It therefore makes it         |
|   difficult for me to decide whether or not my high opinion of Mezzanine     |
|   is the same as my old love for Follow The Leader and such albums. I        |
|   honestly believe that I will regard Mezzanine as one the greatest albums   |
|   of all time for the rest of my life, without a doubt. The rest of my       |
|   life seems like a far cry from the seemingly short five years that I've    |
|   been listening to Mezzanine, so there's really no way of knowing if it     |
|   will retain its staying power.                                             |
|                                                                              |
|   I cannot fully explain the phenomenon that is Mezzanine, nor its nearly    |
|   unequaled critical acclaim. What I can explore is how much of an advance   |
|   for Massive Attack is was, and how it affects me.                          |
|                                                                              |
|   After a brief hiatus, Massive Attack re-emerged in 1998 minus one          |
|   member. Tricky had left for a solo career, unsurprisingly making music     |
|   similar to early Massive Attack. How much of an impact his departure had   |
|   on the band I'm not sure, but some factors must have caused them to        |
|   change so dramatically. Massive Attack rose above their contemporaries     |
|   such as Portishead, with a new style. They had almost said goodbye to      |
|   the indie, soul, and hip-hop influences that drove their previous          |
|   albums. While Protection showed a little electronic flair, Mezzanine was   |
|   when instumentals fully surfaced as a key element of the band. From        |
|   dark, brooding keyboards in the club-scene commentary Risingson, to        |
|   smooth, lush instrumentals in the 50's slow-jam Exchange, Massive Attack   |
|   helped reinvent an entire genre, although an obscure one.                  |
|                                                                              |
|   What is also superior to the previous albums is the vocals. There is a     |
|   smaller input from from the rather annoying reggae singer Horance Andy,    |
|   whose vibrato style almost ruined Blue Lines' One Love. He does appear     |
|   on the opener, Angel, but he sings in a more soft, subtle way. The other   |
|   song of his, Man Next Door, happens to be the only song on Mezzanine I     |
|   find mediocre. It only seems mediocre compared to the greats like          |
|   Teardrop and Group Four.                                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   This brings me to absolute best thing about Mezzanine: Elizabeth Fraser.   |
|   While Shari Nelson and Tracy Thorn are both perfectly decent singers       |
|   (understatement of the year), they always seemed to draw attention away    |
|   from the music for me, except in the case of the 1991 classic Unfinished   |
|   Sympathy. On the other hand, Elizabeth Fraser's voice is just plain        |
|   perfect. It's more than perfect; it's divine. If I believed in God, I      |
|   would imagine it to have a voice like hers. Her singing brings emotion     |
|   to Massive Attack's songs that may have seemed inconceivable before.       |
|   Fraser's ending to Teardrop makes it one of the most moving moments of     |
|   the album. She just adds to much beauty to Mezzanine, and I do not think   |
|   it would it would have made it so far without her.                         |
|                                                                              |
|   Now, Robert Del Naja (also known as 3D) can't exactly shatter glass with   |
|   his voice, but he makes an outstanding contribution as a vocalist          |
|   nonetheless. With the newly-introduced dark atmospheres behind him, his    |
|   amelodic murmurs are often chilling. On the title track, Del Naja          |
|   creates an unnerving depth with the repeated lyrics "All these have        |
|   flaws." On the earlier albums, his talk-rapping was as annoying as         |
|   Andy's singing, but with the right background he makes quite a presence,   |
|   especially on Massive's most recent release 100th Window.                  |
|                                                                              |
|   With the addition of instumentals and more refined vocals, Mezzanine       |
|   manages to create a broad spectrum of emotions. I equate the contrast of   |
|   tones to the contrast between the two main singers. Fraser is meant to     |
|   represent the gentle, motherly yin, whereas Del Naja plays the male role   |
|   of the strong, unyielding yang. After an album of ups and downs, the two   |
|   sides to the dichotomy meet face to face in the final act, Group Four.     |
|   It begins with a creepy, crawling sound, and then an ever-so-dark          |
|   bassline kicks off the song. The use of instrumentals is excellent here,   |
|   casting a sad yet hopeful tone. Del Naja and Fraser take turns singing     |
|   to each other, in some kind of dance of death. Del Naja's lyrics           |
|   represent introversion and isolation, "A flask I drink of sober tea,       |
|   while relay cameras monitor me, and the buzz surrounds it does, buzz       |
|   surrounds." The buzz of the cameras represents a stark artificiality,      |
|   while Fraser expresses the complete opposite. Her lyrics, "Daydreaming,    |
|   admiring, being, quietly, open the world I hear the time of the starry     |
|   sky turning over at midnight," obviously suggest a more warm, open         |
|   embracing of nature and beauty. After five minutes of competition, Del     |
|   Naja says "Flickering I roam," creating the illusion that the song is      |
|   drawing to a close. The very quiet music is pushed forward by a            |
|   crescendoing drum beat, joined soon after by a guitar. As it continually   |
|   strums, you just know that something wonderful is about to happen, until   |
|   everything finally comes to light with Fraser leading the majestic final   |
|   movement. The music keeps speeding up gradually, until you feel like you   |
|   can't take it anymore. It then reaches its inevitable decline into one     |
|   of the most fulfilling releases I've ever heard. It leaves me with an      |
|   impression that the two sides have found some kind of solace, maybe even   |
|   in death.                                                                  |
|                                                                              |
|   Not quite to spoil everything, but to certainly put a damper to an         |
|   otherwise perfect ending, the very last track is an alternative version    |
|   of Exchange, with Horace Andy singing along. I recommend that you leave    |
|   this song off, because Group Four is the true ending to the album. As I    |
|   said, Mezzanine presents a broad range of emotions, most of which were     |
|   brought about by Massive Attack's developments in production. Mezzanine    |
|   is both a classic and a 5/5 album; a classic because of its redefinition   |
|   of trip hop, and a 5/5 for being an almost perfect album in my eyes.       |
|   Mezzanine is hardly perfect, but I would never say that there is even      |
|   one bad song. I refuse to even consider the possibility that Mezzanine     |
|   is a "phase album," like some of my old nu-metal flames. I've never been   |
|   surer about an album that I'll listen to it and love it for the rest of    |
|   my life. It sounds naive, but I guess I just have that much faith in       |
|   Mezzanine. [ocelot-05, sputnikmusic]                                       |
