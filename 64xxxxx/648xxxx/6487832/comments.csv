,eZulu,2011-07-06T21:10Z,thamk you so much uploader this is a briliant anime. 
,Teddikilla,2011-07-10T03:34Z,"It's just you doing something wrong lol. The only problem with this torrent, which I actually forgot to mention is that episode 23 is only japanese audio. Idk what went wrong with that. But it's subtitled and it's only 1 episode so it's not really worth the trouble of reuploading and seeding back 20000% for the audio of one episode :]
Idk what you could have done wrong to download that many eps of each episode,. It's all 26 episodes.
Please seed. For I will not be seeding this anymore, I've seeded it 20fold already :\
Keep this awesome anime alive :]"
,NightFoxe,2011-08-08T01:14Z,"Brilliant! It works wonderfully.

Though, for a moment, I thought I had the same problem as pissedoff11. VLC was titling everything ep 19. They're all different though, so no problem ever.

... and it may seem like a stupid question... but how the hell can you manage to fuck up downloading a torrent in the first place??"
,Teddikilla,2011-08-28T11:10Z,"Idk, my friend seems to do it constantly though. It's pretty fucking ridiculous lol."
,Luckylion,2011-11-26T11:56Z,the videos are just mislabeled (in VLC at least) to show episode 19for all of them they actually are all the episodes
