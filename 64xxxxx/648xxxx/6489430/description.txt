Discovering Advanced Algebra helps all learners develop a strong conceptual understanding of Algebra 2. This text uses data analysis to model pure-algebra concepts, derive equations, solve problems, and build skillsâ€”all using an investigative approach to learning.
The Discovering Advanced Algebra approach improves learning in many ways:
â€¢ Real data, real-life situations, and real-world applications will help you motivate students and show them the importance of what they are learning.
â€¢ The sequence of mathematical experiences aids your students in making conceptual connections between the many topics covered in Algebra 2.
â€¢ Your students will develop and practice skills, such as multiplying and factoring polynomials and solving many kinds of equations in a wide variety of mathematical settings.
â€¢ The text also provides regular opportunities for students to practice and review skills learned in previous algebra courses.
â€¢ Investigations, visual representations, and opportunities for discussion will enable you to integrate multiple teaching modes into your classroom so that visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners all benefit.
â€¢ To help you reach all your students, every lesson has a Differentiating Instruction box with suggestions for modifying the lessons for ELL students, students who need extra support, and advanced students.
â€¢ You can be certain that this diverse approach to teaching will also strengthen studentsâ€™ understanding and retention of advanced algebra concepts and skills.
