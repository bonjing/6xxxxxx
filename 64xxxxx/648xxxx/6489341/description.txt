|   On the seventh day as God rested, he thought. He thought long and hard     |
|   of what to do. He realized he needed some form of entertainment. He, in    |
|   secret, created Mike Patton, Trevor Dunn, Trey Sprunance, Jed Watts,       |
|   Theo Lengyl, and Martin Fosnaugh. God made these folks practice for        |
|   millions of years, until he thought they should make some demos. They      |
|   first made The Raging Wrath Of The Easter Bunny, and while God was         |
|   pleased with this creation, he thought that Jed and Martin were not        |
|   right for Mr. Bungle. So, he created Scott Fritz and Hans Wagner to play   |
|   on their next demo Bowel Of Chiley. He was very pleased with this          |
|   release also, but though that Scott was not right for Mr. Bungle either.   |
|   So Mr. Bungle made another demo for God and right then he knew. He         |
|   needed Clinton KcKinnon and Danny Hefetz and then his band would be        |
|   perfect. They recorded their last demo OU818 and god knew it was time.     |
|   He quickly made Warner Brothers Records sign Mr. Bungle and they made      |
|   their self titled CD. He wanted more and four years more he got it in      |
|   the form of Disco Volante, the band at their most experimental and         |
|   weird. The members of Mr. Bungle fired Theo before they started making     |
|   their next album and this angered God as he knew that Theo had always      |
|   added something great to their sound. Regardless of this, God still        |
|   craved more of Mr. Bungle!! He had to wait patiently for four more years   |
|   until finally they released this album, California.                        |
|                                                                              |
|   When God finally obtained this album, he tore off the packaging with       |
|   glee. He didn't know what to expect. Would it be another album in the      |
|   vein of their self titled days, a ska-circus-metal-weird-freak-out         |
|   album? Would it be as experimental and crazy as Disco Volante? Would it    |
|   be more experimental than Disco Volante?? Or would they go all the way     |
|   back to their grindcore/death metal days? God couldn't think about it      |
|   anymore and popped this CD into his CD player.                             |
|                                                                              |
|   The sounds of seagulls are what came from his speakers, quickly followed   |
|   by the relaxing sounds of violins, steel guitars and other instruments     |
|   he didn't exactly know that names of. (Yeah I know he's God...) This was   |
|   not the Mr. Bungle he knew. He didn't know what to think. Maybe it would   |
|   turn into the Bungle he knew. This was some sort of introduction, that's   |
|   it! Yes! Just to trick you into thinking this album was going to be        |
|   slow. Ha! Fat chance!! It begin to fade out. Good. That song was           |
|   terrible, but now is fast. It's heavy. But not Bungle heavy. He turned     |
|   off the cd as soon as he heard Mike singing. Too calm. This is not         |
|   right.                                                                     |
|                                                                              |
|   He thought he should go to bed. He did, and the next day he came to the    |
|   CD with a different point of view. He turned the CD on again. Bracing      |
|   himself for what was about to come, he just listened. There were those     |
|   damn seagulls again. It didn't seem to bother him as much this time. The   |
|   seconds those relaxing instruments came on he knew. Yes, this was the      |
|   same Bungle. He loved it. He listened to the whole thing. Through the      |
|   jazzy None Of Them Knew They Were Robots. Through the haunting             |
|   RetroVertigo. Through the spastic Air Conditioned Nightmare. Through       |
|   everything. He listened to it again and again and again. He flat out       |
|   loved it.                                                                  |
|                                                                              |
|   You see, Mr. Bungle go everywhere. They are most definitely not afraid     |
|   to experiment with different instruments, and give many layers to their    |
|   songs. Goodbye Sober Day has been rumored to have used 40 separate         |
|   tracks to make the final song. Mr. Bungle journey from genre to genre      |
|   within one song, within seconds you go from listening to tribal chanting   |
|   to metal. It all happens so smooth, and never comes off as forced. What    |
|   is on this album cannot be put into one single genre, and I don't think    |
|   anyone will ever be able sum up Mr. Bungle with a single word, and this    |
|   album portrays them at what many see as their best.                        |
|                                                                              |
|   Every song on hear is completely beautiful in their own way, and all do    |
|   take time to grow on you. Every song has enormous replay value, as there   |
|   are many new things to discover upon each listen. I still can listen to    |
|   a song, which I have practically memorized and be amazed by finding a      |
|   new instrument hiding deep within the mix. This music is fun and           |
|   unpredictable.                                                             |
|                                                                              |
|   It is their last album, and they have officially disbanded even though     |
|   they do continue to all make music in other projects, they will never be   |
|   able to touch the music they made when they all came together, as when     |
|   their minds combine and they play their instruments together, there is     |
|   nothing that they can do to beat the emotion, talent, and sheer            |
|   creativity that they made. I believe that the best word that you can use   |
|   to sum up Mr. Bungle and this album is remarkable. [TheMisterBungle,       |
