|   Kurt Cobain did not hide his love for the Pixies in any way. Had it not    |
|   been for this band, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" may never have been          |
|   recorded. Another college rock favorite, Bob Mould, made a deliberate      |
|   Pixies rip off song with "A Good Idea," off of his watershedding Copper    |
|   Blue CD.                                                                   |
|                                                                              |
|   For as influential as the Pixies were, they never really had an album      |
|   that fully realized their talents. They came close with Doolittle, but     |
|   there wasn't a classic album in their collection, like Daydream Nation     |
|   or New Day Rising.                                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   Thank god for "greatest hits" collections. Sure they can be cheap ways     |
|   to pour a little more dough into a band's band accounts, but in the        |
|   Pixies case, it's also the perfect starter for anyone who was facinated    |
|   by the influence that the Pixies had on other bands, but were not old      |
|   enough to catch the band live or hear them on college radio stations.      |
|                                                                              |
|   Death To The Pixies his you square in the face with the first song,        |
|   "Cecilia Ann." Between Joey Santiago's dynamic guitar skills and Black     |
|   Francis' (formerly Charles Thompson, now Frank Black) backup guitar        |
|   attack, it's fair to say that the Pixies were not content with remaining   |
|   a cult band. Their sound was big, and they had the songs to make it        |
|   big.                                                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   The furious assault of each of the musicians were matched by the stern     |
|   sense of melody. As pulverizing as "Planet Of Sound" is, the bass line     |
|   by Kim Deal throbs clear as a Beatles bass line. If there was a perfect    |
|   "Pixies" song, it would have to be "Wave Of Mutilation"; in under three    |
|   minutes, you get a towering guitar intro and a chorus that's practically   |
|   impossible to shun off after the first listen.                             |
|                                                                              |
|   After the breathless "Wave," a pretty spring-like song, "Dig For Fire"     |
|   comes on. It's a nice contrast that shows the strong songwriting skills    |
|   of the band. And it also marks a turning point in Death To The Pixies.     |
|   From then on, the songs grow more experimental, to the point of where      |
|   you can tell what songs were Kim Deal-influenced and what songs were all   |
|   about Black Francis.                                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   That's not to say that the earlier songs had their creative warzones.      |
|   Thankfully, Death To The Pixies does not follow a strict chronological     |
|   order. The second has many of the songs on the first disc, but instead     |
|   the live versions of the songs are performed. The live versions of some    |
|   of the songs are radically different than the studio recordings, not so    |
|   much as the sound quality, but the tangents the band hit when they were    |
|   playing these songs took them on different roads.                          |
|                                                                              |
|   With such a talented lineup, it was inevitable that each member wanted     |
|   to go their seperate directions. Unfortunately, each of the artists made   |
|   that one great solo album or solo project album and then either faded      |
|   into obscurity (Breeders anyone?) or were in bands that basically let      |
|   the musician have their own say(Frank Black). And as history shows, it's   |
|   usually nice to have a Keith Richards or John Lennon to keep the Mick      |
|   Jagger and Paul McCartney's of the world in check and vice versa.          |
|                                                                              |
|   For anyone who is interested in how college rock evolved into what is      |
|   was in the early '90s, there is no closer necessity than Death To The      |
|   Pixies to purchase. Find out what songs you like the best and pick up      |
|   the album that has most of those songs on them. Be cautioned however,      |
|   you'll never look at Nirvana in the same light again. [Sean McCarthy,      |
