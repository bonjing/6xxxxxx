Unfortunately, this is the only 1080p copy that's even remotely synched with the audio. And that's not saying much, because it's still about a quarter-second out of synch."
,scurvypirate1234,2011-07-03T02:31Z,"To fix the audio sync issues, when you remux, introduce a 150ms delay in the audio track. It's almost a perfect sync.

It appears that all the currently available copies are from the same source file, as they all have delayed video tracks. Why no one thought ""hey, maybe I should fix the audio sync"" is beyond me, instead of just changing formats, adding additional audio tracks, subs, etc. You're all just polishing turds and should be ashamed of yourselves."
