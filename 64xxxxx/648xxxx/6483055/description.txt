IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Green Lantern 2011 

Ok we were going to hold fire until we got the line audio,but considering we're 100% sure when we will 
have it,we decided to release this for the time being.
Hope to get line this week so .....until then.

Right video,we were kindly given the source files which were ok but need alot of TLC.The video was filmed at
angle and the borders all round were all slanted etc....the video was washed out and was badly interlaced.
Also contain 5 lines of subs which were hardcoded in russian.
Now work done....first thing was pull the video level and change the perspective,which left us a video with pretty
much straight borders which then were cropped and then resized the video to give it a better AR.
After than we deinterlaced and it still had some faint line in parts so we had to recall it and blend aswell to remove all.
Then we did our normal stuff of tweaking the rgb colours,chroma,brightness,contrast,sharpness etc...
And finally we made a subpack for the non english subs and hardcoded them in yellow.

Audio we had to use the p2p release as only english audio out at the time of making this.So that needed resyncing to the video
and then cleaning up,in which we used a light noise filter and changed all the EQ on it.

Overall not too bad for a cam at all and more than watchable.....all being well TS will be released soon and we'll also add the after credit
scene then to it (as we forgot this time oops ).

Enjoy folks :)
