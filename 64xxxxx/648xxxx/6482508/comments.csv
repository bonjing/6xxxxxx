niggapoison, you and everybody else were stuck at 97%, so it is not possible for you to determine if it works."
,Baudouin,2011-06-21T08:39Z,"File successfully downloaded, and ghost2/profile2 folders copied where they have to be.
New profile appears in profile list, but get message ""profile cannot be loaded"" when I select it. My other profiles are OK.
PS. I work offline with update 1 and skidrow patch installed."
,nofixedip,2011-06-21T08:53Z,"alibaba2010, you are just an idiot, no response necessary."
,nofixedip,2011-06-21T09:11Z,"Baudouin, This was made without update 1 maybe that's the problem. The brand of patch should not be an issue.

I'm downloading the update now, I'll install the update this week and test it myself."
,alibaba2010,2011-06-21T12:03Z,Sorry..............

Both my own personal profile and this John Doe work ok. Sorry it didn't work for you but I cannot duplicate the problem."
