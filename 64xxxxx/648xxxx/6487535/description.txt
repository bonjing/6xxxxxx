So this is Windows 8 M3 Build
7989.
I installed this into VirtualBox
and it worked fine. Going to
install it later to the real hard
drive and see what happens.
Not much has changed that is
actually (in my opinion) useful
however they have added the
Roaming option in the CP and
also so various other little visual
tweaks.
If you need help I lurk in the IRC
so drop on by and if I\'m not
there leave me a message here
and I\'ll respond.
Edited for links:
Ok so here are the links to the
RedPill activator both the article
and the direct link to the
download page.
