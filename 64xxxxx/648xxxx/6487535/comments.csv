 Speed wise I was comparing this  to Win 7 which takes over a minute,these times would be quicker if did not have dual boot and logon set-up!
"
,grizzmo,2011-06-23T13:20Z,or a pre alpha maybe?
,Free-Sharing,2011-06-23T23:11Z,When i run it from win7 it showes as win7 installation. WTF! Is it cose i run it from win or its still old setup?
,grizzmo,2011-06-24T12:38Z,a pre release bug?
,nevise,2011-06-24T16:33Z,Ok this is what you will get with this release. First i noticed was very very slugish performance of windows it self particulary windowses. When i tryed to move them they were stutering like in game. Drivers vice nvidia 275.33 is incompatibile (which is latest at the time of this post). When i install it desktop composition is disabled (aero is disabled) and can not be turned on as many other features that u can normaly turn on/off thus making it impossible to play games because every game reports driver incompatibility. Audio realtek and nvidia mobo drivers are working so for time being vga drivers are only problem (donno if theres issues whit ati drivers). Redpill is working and i wish it didnt. I hope they dont make this new ribbon default in new win8 cose it sucks at least for me. I didnt installed it from dvd but from win7 on to other partition. That might be the cause of stuttering but i doubt its cause of driver incompatibility. There you have its up to to decide to try it or not.
,MadZalmanModder,2011-06-25T04:37Z,can we get some checksums for this iso?
,alnawaris,2011-06-25T13:41Z,this is win 7 not 8 WTF mate check your uploaded i instal it it is win7 x64 bit

,bert16,2011-06-29T04:43Z,"Can you install it over Windows 7, or is it like upgrading from XP to Win 7 which can't be done directly? Also, are the memory requirements higher or what?"
,gouravdon,2011-06-30T21:14Z,when I start installing it says windows 7
,nevise,2011-07-01T13:18Z,"How more can u be fucking dumb all of u thats say ""its win7 installation"" Read previous fucking comments. Yes its fucking win7 installation but once u fucking install it its fucking win8 but it doesnt make any difference because it works like shit on nvidia gpu and might even on ati."
,j2progeny,2011-07-01T15:28Z,"LOL!

the booting time depends on your unit specs...
the more speed it has with the better specs u have...

YES! this is W7 with numerous upgrades..
And all Operating systems works on specified computer... but not all computers can be installed with different OS..."
,csabaxb,2011-07-01T22:58Z,"It's install like windows 7, system say it's windows 7 64 bit, install some virtual keyboard, but not let me to install any program. Have 64x2 Amd, but not work for me. Uninstall."
,Dodge34,2011-07-07T04:31Z,"Every people that claim to say its windows 7, technically, its still Windows 7 but with the features and hard work of Windows 8 integrated in it, and its not made to be used as main OS, its too early to use it as main OS, driver compatibility is one of the reason not to use it as primary windows, its just for testing, not for using for games and such."
