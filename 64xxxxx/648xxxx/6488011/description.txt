Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  
music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTES: Hour 1 ends kind of funny.  Glenn went on so long he couldn't do the live commercial.  That actually happened a couple of days ago as well, but he was able to catch himself and throw it to a break. Today they just cut him off.  Then, when coming back from the break he didn't talk throwing it to the next hour.  Only the theme music plays.  I've left this all in so yall could hear it.

Also, the quality is still shitty after a couple of weeks now (since the launch of GBTV), so I'm guessing this  is the new reality.  Oh well.
