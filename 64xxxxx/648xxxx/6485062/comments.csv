,thcfreak666,2011-08-23T17:25Z,Fake !
,MasterPhisherman,2011-08-30T05:08Z,What evidence do you have to back up your claim that this is a fake?
,aamirmand,2011-08-30T11:09Z,Its just the lite version... lol.
,MasterPhisherman,2011-08-31T05:28Z,@ aamirmand. its not the lite version if you read the instructions.
,henwiie,2011-09-03T18:03Z,"This works all well and good, but you can't run the damn game. Is there something special you have to do?"
,MasterPhisherman,2011-09-09T20:18Z,@henwiie Are you getting an error message? If so can you post it?
,Xinthose,2011-09-24T01:59Z,It works perfectly.  Thank you much person friend.  God Bless.
,henwiie,2011-09-26T19:30Z,@MasterPhisherman the error says: Error creating stand-alone: cannot find valid runner data.
,henwiie,2011-09-26T19:37Z,"I got to work, I didn't realize you needed to download the gamemaker from this torrent, I was using my own lite version I had downloaded. You should make a comment somewhere telling people this MasterPhisherman. But thanks anyway!"
,dgcash,2011-10-31T00:56Z,"When I try to unzip the file using the method described in the readme.txt file, it asks for a password.  What am I doing wrong?"
,LorenzoTheComic,2011-11-25T07:16Z,What's the password to the archive that I have to extract?
,ocachobee,2011-12-18T19:22Z,"I sort of new to this but not really, I opened the %appdata%\GameMaker then opened up the rar file, but don't know what exactly to replace the file with."
,TheScorpionKing131,2012-02-07T09:22Z,"Thanks, working!~
Just one thing: why does the program say ""GayMaker"" instead of ""GameMaker""?
Would be nice if you changed that ;)

@ocachobee
You have to replace the ""Game_Maker.exe"" inside ""Upgrade.zip"" with the downloaded Game_Maker.exe.
Just drag the downloaded one into the Upgrade.zip archive"

Everything installed fine and when I ran previously created games that used pro only options they ran fine.  I also tried making a simple game that creates an ef_effect on global left mouse press (effect creation is pro only) and that compiled and worked just fine."

I've run into a puzzling problem now, though:  I started working on a new project and when I tried to run it I got an error that simply says ""Failed to the run the game"".  There's no reason or explanation at all given by the program.  It also set off my AVG the first time but it no longer does now if I try to run it again without having changed anything."
,toddtj,2012-03-02T07:28Z,"3/3

I'm not sure if any of this is really significant but I thought it might be worth sharing.  If anyone has any idea why the game failed to run please say so.  I guess I'll just try saving and re-opening and/or starting with a new file.  I hope this isn't some sort of corruption business that may hit me again after I've spent hours on the code."
