,digs5446,2011-06-24T13:41Z,"this does NOT have DD 5.1 audio.  it is PCM 2.0 stereo.  i know this because i ran the file under MediaInfo (furthermore the bit rate is 384 kbps), and also my receiver confirms it as 2.0 and defaults to Dolby Pro Logic :(

so my question is, why is this file set significantly larger than the other upload by the same user, which was apparently supposed to be the only 2.0 version???

fwiw the video quality is superb, 5.8 Mbps"
