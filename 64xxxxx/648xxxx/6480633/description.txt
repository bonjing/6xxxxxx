A rare film made by actor David Carradine, starring himself as the scruffy drifter and Barbara Hershey as the weird young woman wondering around town and has no real purpose.... anyway this is a good film to check out if your a David Carradine fan.


NTSC Format.

no subtitles were included on DVD....sorry
