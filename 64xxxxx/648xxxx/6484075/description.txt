The sixth season begins a year after the end happenings of the fifth with Dean living a happy life with Lisa and Ben. Sam returns to the world of the living and teams up with Dean, who leaves his new life behind. Sam has been working under Samuel in order to hunt and capture alive Alpha monsters (first of the gene pool). Castiel is barely helpful anymore because the Heaven civil war has taken it's toll. It is discovered that Samuel is on Crowley's orders in exchange for his daughter back. Crowley wants the Alphas in order to locate purgatory, a vast collection of souls that could be used for power. Castiel brought back Sam without his soul, and Dean implores the help of the Horseman, Death, in order to retrieve it. Death puts a wall up in Sam's mind so that he will not remember hell. The old Sam returns with no memory of the past year.
