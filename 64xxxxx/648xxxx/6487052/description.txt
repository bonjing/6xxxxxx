Joe Jackson [born David Ian Jackson, 11 August 1954, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire] is
an English musician and singer-songwriter now living in Berlin, whose five Grammy Award
nominations span from 1979 to 2001. He is probably best-known for the 1979 hit song"Is She
Really Going Out with Him?\", which still gets extensive FM radio airplay; for his 1982 hit,
\"Steppin\' Out\"; and for his 1984 success with \"You Can\'t Get What You Want
[Till You Know What You Want]\".

Along with Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, Jackson was a part of the trio of English artists
who challenged the punk scene and brought a New Wave sound to the United States[citation
needed] in the late 1970s. He was popular for his pop/rock and new wave music early on
before moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical
hybrids.
