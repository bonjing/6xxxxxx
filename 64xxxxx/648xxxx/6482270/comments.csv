[T],dada_sh,2011-07-04T13:39Z,"@ /EmBoLa.be/ thanks for your confirmation & seeding help... 

the below should answer your question ;-)
When Thomas Edison worked late into the night on the electric light, he had to do it by gas lamp or candle. I'm sure it made the work seem that much more urgent.

,zero1zero,2011-07-04T15:22Z,Thanks for the upload but it would have been better if you didn't make the license file part of the .zip so we could just download the license instead of the whole thing.
,icy1230,2011-07-04T16:53Z,Will this work for 64 bit?
[T],dada_sh,2011-07-04T19:11Z,@ /icy1230/ yes it does you simply download the 64 bit from http://www.bitdefender.com/world/Downloads/ and register using the serial provided in my torrent. 
,moviez4free,2011-07-08T21:45Z,"The Download was Excellent and clean but please assist me with the updates. I dont know why but i am being shown a message that says "" Update failed"". It doesnt always happen, yet happens sometimes though !!Please say me what to do.

Thank you for the download
Regards,

[T],dada_sh,2011-07-09T11:40Z,"@ /moviez4free/ the update feature requires a working & stable Internet connection and a proper configuration of the Bit Defender update settings: Unstable connection is the main reason for update interruption but thereâ€™s nothing to worry about 
The software will keep trying to update itself every hour 
Meanwhile go to update section & insure the below server settings 
1st  http://upgrade.bitdefender.com/

,veer1989,2011-07-11T16:20Z,"hi, Bro...
I'm using WIndows 7 - 64 bit...
I downloaded ur BitDefender Antivirus Pro 2011 torrent...

My problem is when i download Bitdefender 64 bit trial from the http://www.bitdefender.com/world/Downloads/..... system restarts automatically after it is downloaded, then set-up never starts... this happened two times....

Where does the downloaded installation files goes (In C: drive or which drive), which i downloaded?

please help me.... "
[T],dada_sh,2011-07-11T17:56Z,"@ /veer1989/: 
1 - per default IDM save your downloaded file in C:\Users\computer-name\Downloads\ there you can find the .exe file 
2 - or go to search & type: Bitdefender a list will appear & your file will show, ""voila"" right click on it - cut - and paste into any folder you desire or desktop & from there also you can start your installation. do not forget to Run as Administrator"
,veer1989,2011-07-12T15:24Z,"@dada_sh,
first setup was successful, but when after formatting my pc,

Then i installed...
After setup is completed... 

it says, the application has failed to start bcoz its side by side configuration is incorrect. please see the application event log... or use command sxstrace.exe for more detail.."
[T],dada_sh,2011-07-12T17:38Z,"@ /veer1989/: 

1 - Your problem relates to MS C++ problem. Go to control panel/programs and features, does it show Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 x64 as being installed?

2 - You can try & fix this by uninstalling the current version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and downloading and installing the 2008 version that comes from the Focus support website here:  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=ba9257ca-337f-4b40-8c14-157cfdffee4e 

Let me know if this fix your problem"

any suggestions??"
[T],dada_sh,2011-07-15T12:20Z,"@ /veer1989/... nice 2 hear that your problem been solved welcome buddy.
@ /p4prachi/... welcome mate!
@ /bengtsn/... now you know where to search before spending your â‚¬'s keep visiting ;-)
@ /zee123456/... Your error message stated is a bit strange. I advise you: 
1 - Uninstalling your BitDefender Antivirus 2011
2 - Reboot
3 - Reinstall & apply the correct license (included, copy ~ paste: preferable)
Just to be sure before i replied to your message... Iâ€™ve uninstalled mine & reinstall it & use the license & it worked perfectly 
4 - Now is your turn to try ;-) confirm back please if it works."
,hotz123,2011-07-20T18:13Z,Thanks a lot dada_sh downloaded it just yesterday and can confirm the key works perfectly fine.. got 576 days.. Hoping to see more awesome torrents from you soon.. 
,hotz123,2011-07-20T18:19Z,@zee123456 I too encountered the same issue in the beginning but then what i did was enter another random key to make the program think it was the key then reinsert the same key (make sure the internet is on while registering) then it worked like a breeze after that.. Hope that helps.. (I had my internet on when i was doing da stuff i mentioned earlier but somehow the software was not able to connect to the server i guess)
,exsavior10,2011-07-22T04:29Z,i love you for this!! 567 days of license! fuck yeah! :DD

,W00TZY,2011-08-09T02:34Z,"Worked for my 64 bit Windows 7, after installing the 2011 64 bit, uninstalling, and then installing 2012 and using the email and key I used for the 2011.  

I'm not sure if it's related to BitDefender but I got a blue screen right after the 2012 finished installing and have been getting occasional blue screens at boot up ever since.  I have only had 4 blue screens on this Dell Laptop ever since I bought it a little over a year ago and I have to think BitDefender is the cause.  I know for certain it's not the fault of dada_sh, but I suspect it's the program itself.  Also, for some reason I cannot get the rescue mode to work.  Whenever I click it, it says it will reboot and then nothing happens.  "
,clutchest,2011-08-11T03:36Z,"@W00TZY, try reinstalling, my 2012 wasn't updating on first install and now after reinstalling it runs perfectly"
