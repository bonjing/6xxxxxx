,loveramore,2011-06-22T22:32Z,How many episodes do you have?
,masgeo,2011-06-23T00:53Z,"36 episodes (I've only uploaded 6 so far.)

The set claims - ""The complete dvd collection features episodes 22 through to 36, never before released in the UK.""

I know there are a lot more episodes than 36, but perhaps they only ever dubbed 36.

I hope this seeding starts working!

,masgeo,2011-06-23T01:04Z,"From Wikipedia:

""The first 36 episodes were licensed to Manga Entertainment and released in English dubbed and subtitled formats on VHS and DVD. Manga Entertainment initially released the series in eight VHS volumes spanning only 24 episodes in 1999 and later released all 36 episodes in five DVD volumes in 2003""

So I do have them all. I'll be uploading them soon. Please let me know if it's coming down okay. I've set my upload speed to unlimited."
,masgeo,2011-06-23T13:31Z,"Hey - I've worked out how to convert to avi's, so I'm afraid I'm going to stop this torrent. I'll put all 36 eps up in one go - saving us all time and space. Might take me a week to do it but I promise I'll have them all up. I'll post a link when it's done.

Sorry about the delay.
