,johnnybgood99,2011-09-13T12:16Z,thank you
,c56789,2011-09-25T05:35Z,sounds awful   only 128kb/s
,Tastetherainbow219,2011-10-04T05:14Z,@c56789 dude it sounds fine if you don't like it don't download it
,Tastetherainbow219,2011-10-04T05:18Z,"@c56789 If it were higher, the file size would be bigger and waste more space.. honestly when I convert it to a lower bit rate I hear no sound difference. The main reason I lower it is so people can fit the whole thing on there iPods/Mp3 players"
,schmitty84,2011-10-26T17:45Z,"Actually, the reason people lower the br is to save space. Such as your case I assume. For those of us with a 5.1 surround we can hear a difference. Especially if we have a good setup in our vehicles as well. "
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-10-30T01:21Z,"@magoozer   Look under ""files"" on the top of the page. It's normally a good place to figure out what you are about to download, unless it's all rar'd up; zipped?"
,TheUnforgiven76,2011-10-30T19:19Z,128kb/s sounds terrible. not worth it at all. so flat and grainy.
