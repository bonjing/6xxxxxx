,meothui,2011-08-19T15:49Z,"Hi LigG, I appreciate all the work you've done for us. Here's just my few suggestions:

-Use level 4.0 or 4.1 because not many TVs and standalone players support above that.

-ReFrames 4 to 5 frames and set it to Constant Quality instead of Target Bitrate or File size. (CRF can be up to 22 if you rip from high quality source). 

-You can keep the file size between 3 to 5 GB. Raising the ripping time and CRF value will reduce the file size while you still can have the quality. "
