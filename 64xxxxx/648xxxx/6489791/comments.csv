I will stop seeding this torrent and create another one and then delete this once I fix the episodes. All you have to do do then is just point the new torrent at the same directory and continue your download. Sorry about this."
,otakuloser,2011-06-25T05:06Z,Update: Never mind... I double checked and there's nothing wrong with the cropping for this season anyway.
