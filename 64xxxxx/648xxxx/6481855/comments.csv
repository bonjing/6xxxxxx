,wck,2011-06-21T16:35Z,"It's a really good show. Dunno what crawled up Leto's snatch but this wasn't a terrible ending. The story didn't have a conclusion so it wasn't all wrapped up with a pretty little bow on it in the end, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It could have been more satisfying but so what? Lots of shows end the season with a cliffhanger."
