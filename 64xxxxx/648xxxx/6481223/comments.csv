Fuck off you loser. You downloaded this torrent from scenebalance and re-uploaded it as your own so get a life you fag."
,TorrentJezuz,2011-06-20T07:04Z,He downloaded this torrent off scenebalance and re-uploaded it as his own because he wants to become a trusted uploader.
[T],soupucia,2011-06-20T09:13Z,"@TorrentJezuz, are you being deliberately stupid? This release is all over the web. He didn't make this release, and neither did I. It's from the group PRESTiGE."
