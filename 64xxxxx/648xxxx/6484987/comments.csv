,cinegoer,2011-06-26T18:48Z,"Zen, pretty good upload. Very high quality at a low size. Can you upload Yi Yi movie?"
,muLineZu,2011-07-04T18:07Z,"Very good quality for the size of it.
Wondered though, why you encoded it at 24.000 fps? As I know a blu-ray is 23.976 fps, and I haven't understood what's the advantage in changing the framerate. One (small) disadvantage I can tell you is the conversion of the subtitle's framerate (that I had to do :-( ...
Nevertheless this doesn't diminish your credits for the good job you've done. Thank you!"
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-07-04T18:32Z,"@muLineZu  Its because the source had that fps :(
