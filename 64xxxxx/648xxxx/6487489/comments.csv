,superxyz,2011-06-26T14:40Z,"Yeah sure, everyone's here waiting on tenderhooks to answer all the retarded questions from fat cunts like you.  Never mind that they went to the time and trouble to upload a 5Gb file, for free, they should be obliged to run a fucking support group for all the fucking wankers that can't unpack a fucking rar file or mount an iso or use a fucking bittorrent client."
,Kojones,2011-06-28T22:42Z,"Superxyz, no need to be rude man. I don't think my question is retarted. But hey, I understand when an uploader won't answer. No problem. In this case I just go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6447765/ADOBE_CREATIVE_SUITE_5.5_MASTER_COLLECTION_[thethingy] where the uploader does take the time to answer some questions."

One problem. The key that was working appears to have stopped working. I now have the option to put in a new key or start the trial. I generated anew key with the key generator, but it didn't work.

Any ideas?"
,Zinedin,2011-08-09T11:32Z,"I hope this shit works. I downloaded a CS 5.5 torrent titled ""ADOBE.CREATIVE.SUITE.5.5.MASTER.COLLECTION.ESD-ISO"" from MAFIAA here at TPB. I followed the instructions and cracked it, I was then able to used it for about one month. Then all of a sudden it stopped working a few days ago. I get a prompt to enter a serial number or start a 30 day trial when I try launching Photoshop. I tried generating a new serial number but the new serial number is not accepted. I used the X-Force keygen.

ADOBE.CREATIVE.SUITE.5.5.MASTER.COLLECTION.ESD-ISO by MAFIAA:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6339368/ADOBE.CREATIVE.SUITE.5.5.MASTER.COLLECTION.ESD-ISO

In desperation I tried getting a different keygen. I got a CORE keygen for CS 5, hoping it will work with 5.5 as well. I got this also from MAFIAA.

Adobe Creative Suite 5 Master Collection Keymaker Only-CORE by MAFIAA:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5522825/Adobe_Creative_Suite_5_Master_Collection_Keymaker_Only-CORE

It didn't work with version 5.5. So I uninstalled CS 5.5 completely. And I used the Adobe CS cleaner tool to remove all remains of it. And now I'm trying to get a different one that actually works.

I see that this torrent also includes the X-Force keygen (""adobemasterkeygen55.exe""). That's why I say I hope this shit works. Since it has the same keygen as I used before, I wouldn't expect it to work. But I will give it a try.

I would actually rather get the CS 5 instead of 5.5 but most that are out there today are CS 5 now. Because most of you dumb asses out there are switching to ""the latest the greatest the newest"" version you can get. That's stupid man! Why switch to new version if the previous version still works?! That's just greedy, and stupid. It's stupid because it's a greater chance that the latest version will get banned by Adobe servers than the old version. Besides, it's not a big difference between CS 5.5 and CS 5. So why bother?

I actually had a very good release of CS 5 with keygen and everything that I downloaded about a year ago. But I accidentally deleted it when I reinstalled Windows. Now I regret not backing it up."
,Zinedin,2011-08-09T11:38Z,"I recommend blocking any Adobe CS version from accessing the Internet. This can be done after installing it. If you want to install updates for some reason, make sure to get them as a standalone installer package. Do not use the auto update feature. That will most certainly ban you from using it."
,Zinedin,2011-08-09T14:16Z,"It won't budge.

""This serial number is not valid for this product.""

I guess I'll have to install Adobe CS 5 instead."

And for me :("
