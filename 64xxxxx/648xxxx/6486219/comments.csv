,ValekVL,2011-06-27T01:02Z,"Im a noob at downloading a DVR. I have a Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300 HDC.
I have scoured the internet looking for ways to download the DVR to save/burn to disc the shows I am able to download to my PC. Can anyone please tell me how to do this in a step-by-step format. 
I have the eSATA cable attached to my computer but the computer does not ""see"" the DVR, and thus am not able to transfer it that way. I have the USB to AV Cable plugged in and am able to essentially record shows by capturing the image from the DVR and recording as it is playing on the DVR. But not able to transfer the files directly to convert them into AVI format so I can Burn them to disc. Is there an easier way to download the files?"
