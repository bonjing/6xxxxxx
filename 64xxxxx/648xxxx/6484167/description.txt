The Color of Friendship (TV 2000)

Mahree Bok lives on a farm in South Africa. Her father is a policeman who cannot hide his joy when activist Steve Biko is caught by the South African authorities. Piper Dellums is the daughter of a US congressman from California and who lives in a nice home in Washington DC. When Mahree is chosen to spend a semester at the Dellums' house, she doesn't expect that her host family would be black. Nor do her hosts suspect that she is not a black South African.

The audio becomes a bit unsynched at the end. All other torrents of this movie that I found are defunked. I downloaded the parts from youtube and combined them. I hope you enjoy!
