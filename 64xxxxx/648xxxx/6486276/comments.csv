[V],globeplus,2011-06-22T14:22Z,"To rubak48 : i have net limitations and what i did was the next thing : i get the file in not too much size file (get luck on that) then i maded a conversion with a nice converter to avi high-quality , this little procedure gived me more bitrate (only) thatÂ´s all , what i mean is that it is not enough , to get the best perfect quality possible with the original we need the Dub plugins codification work correcting borring particles that many times happen on the picture and to make the colours more alive , not the very common unfocus somehow on the screen that it is a kind of normal on the cams , finally the conversion to the flv to the minimum possible bitrate keeping more stable as possible the picture and with the quality , the flv file comparing to the quality avi used to make the conversion , conclusion : stable picture in a not too much size flv file and with the real possibility to with a nice converter get back a great bitrate to watch the movie , what we loose with the flv conversion : basically bitrate thatÂ´s all because the picture himself kept stable more as possible , so with a conversion to an high quality avi or mp4 with a nice converter get back everything as the original getting back the general positive bitrate and this is the main work and analysis about this type of work .

Cheers and nice movie to all of you . "
,mrsam1999,2011-06-23T06:58Z,Globeplus what is your website address ?
,rubak48,2011-06-23T07:10Z,yeah globe i know thanks for xplaining 
[V],globeplus,2011-06-23T10:01Z,"To mrsam1999 : thank you for your interest and that type of thinking make me think that are always users out there that miss my positive work giving more as possible a nice contribution to the file sharing community in the most correct way possible .
For the moment my friendly user after my forum closed without justification few months ago and my blog the same thing last month, the best i can give is my flashgames site link , it is here :
http://globeflashgames.yola
site.com/
(copy or write in succession the link to the clipbord)
and because my slow net under the circunstances that i need to reduce the expenses to the minimum possible , restringes me of working nice new pc games beside the fact that i recognise that are some people out there that donÂ´t mind to give their best positive contribution independtly of the concorrence or not with me , for the moment and i donÂ´t know for how much time i canÂ´t , i need to regularise my life soon as possible and i need something that gives to me an extra cash to make an effort to improve the net , who knows in sometime ?
I have a fantastic project that it will be only possible with a nice net that needs to wait for the already explained reasons but i am considering step by step a kind of new blog or site in a kind of indeferent way without any particular compromise but without work in the new nice pc games but where nice files or topics can be found maybe only  to say bad things about everything or something who knows ? then if he is closed no problem ... Well of course that a site or blog from me at this moment in time must be direccionated for net limitations users without compromise and it will be thinking in net users like me that i can make a positive work in a new blog or site . CHEERS and long live the file sharing spirit on the net ! "
