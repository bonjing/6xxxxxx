In Marvel Comics, creators of Spider-Man, Fantastic Four and X-Men, comes a new hero ... Ghost Rider. Long ago, superstar motorcycle stunt rider Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) made a deal with the devil to protect the ones he loved most: his father and his childhood sweetheart, Roxanne (Eva Mendes). Now the devil has come for his due. By day, Johnny is a daredevil stunt biker ... but at night, in the presence of evil, he becomes the Ghost Rider, a bounty hunter of rogue demons. Forced to do the devil's bidding, Johnny is determined to confront his fate and use his curse and powers to defend the innocent.
