,Capn_Cunt,2011-07-23T00:31Z,"Applekiller felches the elderly, Anyone want the video?"
,joo-loved-it,2011-07-25T19:36Z,"to everybody complaining about dl speed.
nearly 3000 seeders is plenty to get a reasonably fast download.
modify the amount of allowed peers etc. or google it.
stop telling people to seed. if they are reading your comment it is most likely they are already seeding or are about to so telling people to is only making yourself look like a dick."
,lost_and_idle,2011-07-28T17:47Z,@Mydarkstar>>>>yeah use vlc player it plays all types of media ...if you only getting audio i would think you are using windows media or summert else crap
,LeBatteur,2011-07-31T02:28Z,"Bone rocks on every one of his Uploads.. He never puts crap out there, it is ALWAYS the best you can find at the moment .. If you have problems with something ... it wasn't his torrent... Use VLC to play your movies... "
