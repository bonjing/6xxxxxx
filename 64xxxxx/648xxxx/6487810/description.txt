The Avatamsaka Sutra is one of the most influential Mahayana sutras of East Asian Buddhism. The title is rendered in English as Flower Garland Sutra or Flower Adornment Sutra or Flower Ornament scripture.

The Avatamsaka Sutra describes a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms, mutually containing one other. The sutra, among the largest in the Buddhist canon, contains 40 chapters of somewhat disparate topics, though with some overarching themes: the interdependency of all phenomena (dharmas); the progression of the Buddhist path to full Enlightenment, or Buddhahood.

For what it is worth, this is my favorite spiritual book from any tradition.

Please seed, and please check my torrents for other books on Buddhism and other spiritual traditions. Recently, I have been uploading torrents of Buddhist texts in Kindle format as well as large, unsorted archives of Buddhist texts.
