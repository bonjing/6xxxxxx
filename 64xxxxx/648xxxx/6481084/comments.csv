I recently encountered a problem with your torrent. I can connect to the non-legit relms but I want to change the cdkey provided so that I can play on Us east. I need this for my bot that I want to launch. I play diablo on Mac but there are no copies of bots for macs. This is the message that I got. 

Setup was unable to add the following to C:\Program Files\Diablo II

data\\global\sfx\cursor\wavindex. wav

Error 0x00000003: the system cannot find the path specified 

(C:\D2\Tools\DiabInst\Source\MpqUtil.cpp:32)

Intallation Aborted"

You should check the file ""cdkey.txt"" - it's a readme for cd-key refiller. Also you can check this forum: http://www.blizzhackers.cc/viewtopic.php?t=418985 it's a discussion about this refiller. If it won't help - create theme on this forum, it's quite popular and respectable diablo hack community."
