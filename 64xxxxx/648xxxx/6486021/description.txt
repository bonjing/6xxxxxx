     Directed by thrill master John Carpenter, this edge-of-your seat adventure
     stars Kurt Russell as Jack Burton, a tough-talking, wisecracking truck
     driver whose hum-drum life on the road takes a sudden supernatural
     tailspin when his best friend's fiancee is kidnapped. Speeding to the
     rescue, Jack finds himself deep beneath San Francisco's Chinatown, in
     a murky, creature-filled world ruled by Lo Pan, a 2000-year-old magician
     who mercilessly presides over an empire of spirits. Dodging demons and
     facing baffling terrors, Jack battles his way through Lo Pan's dark
     domain in a full-throttle, action-riddled ride to rescue the girl.
     Co-starring Kim Cattrall, this effects-filled sci-fi spectacle speeds
     to an incredible, twist-taking finish.
