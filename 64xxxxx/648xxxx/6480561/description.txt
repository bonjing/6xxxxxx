Storyline: In a post-apocalyptic future, after a virus in 2011 wiped out 99% of the Earth's population, all the survivors inhabit Bregna, a walled city-state, which is ruled by a congress of scientists. Although Bregna is idyllic, people are disappearing and everyone is having bad dreams. Ã†on Flux is a member of the 'Monicans', an underground rebel organization who communicate telepathically and are led by The Handler. After a mission to destroy a surveillance station, Ã†on comes home to find her sister Una has been killed for supposedly being mistaken for a Monican. When Ã†on is sent on a mission to kill the government's leader, Trevor Goodchild, she discovers that she is unwittingly playing a part in a secret coup.This discovery causes Ã†on to question the origin and destiny of everyone in Bregna; and in particular, her own personal connection to Trevor. It turns out that every person in Bregna is actually a clone, created with recycled DNA. With the dead constantly being reborn into new individuals and still bearing partial memories of their previous lives, there has been an increase in the populace's troubling dreams. Recycling and cloning has became necessary since the original virus antidote made humans infertile. Trevor's experiments, and of all his clone ancestors, have been trying to reverse the infertility. Ã†on learns that she is a clone of the original Trevor's wife, Katherine and is the first Katherine clone in over 400 years.
