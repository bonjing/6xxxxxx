1956's Rodan is an Americanized cut of Sora no 
daikaij Radon, which means "Radon, Monster from 
the Sky." It was a big hit on U.S. screens in 
1957. At five years of age, there was no chance 
I'd be taken to see the movie, but its trailer 
left permanent marks on my brain. A prehistoric 
pterodactyl (we 50s kids knew our dinosaurs) 
zoomed overhead with a supersonic scream, its 
draft flipping a jeep end over end. When the 
picture finally arrived on television five or 
six years later, it became a must-see of early 
60s monsterdom. I still have my plastic model 
of the pterrifying ptitanic pterodactyl, now 
repurposed to impale grocery receipts.

The original Japanese Radon is a simple monster 
story realized on a spectacular scale. The 
inhabitants of a mining community are terrorized 
by a plague of giant subterranean insects. Deep 
in the mine, a rock fall separates engineer 
Shigeru (Kenji Sahara) from other investigators; 
alone in a grotto he witnesses the birth of a 
colossal prehistoric Big Bird. Some time later, 
the grown pterodactyl emerges to rip through the 
stratosphere as if jet propelled. We almost expect 
to see a flaming tailpipe sticking out of Rodan's 
rear end.

Interceptor fighters disintegrate in Rodan's 
backwash, while the reptile's low-flying passes 
produce a pressurized air wake that knocks over 
bridges and hits cities like a tornado. A mate 
eventually turns up, doubling Earth's peril: 
"Look! Two Rodan!"

Eiji Tsuburaya's expert special effects are the 
entire show. The attack of the giant bugs is 
suitably moody and the volcanic finish is a visual 
triumph. Rodan is a puppet when aloft and an ungainly 
monster suit when he lands in Tokyo. Even in the most realistic low angles his wings appear to be made of 
vinyl; when he jumps from his perch atop a building 
we see the actor clearly stumble among some excellent miniatures of a railway yard. 

Although far from perfect, Rodan has the innocence and 
wonder of early 50s Sci-Fi. The monster's signature 
cry sounds like a tangle of chicken clucks lowered in 
pitch and re-recorded in an echo chamber. In the Kaiju 
roll call Rodan holds a place of honor between the 
mighty Godzilla and the magical Mothra.
