,tony419,2011-06-22T22:22Z,"subs would be even more awesome, but y cry over free milk."
,tony419,2011-06-22T22:38Z,"so i went to ur blog and noticed that a lot of the movies there are not here; on ur piratebay page, like West Is West and Season of the Witch and The Romantics. Plus there are links to subtitles for each movie on ur blog and no subs here. Are the movies on your blog downloadable via torrents also? Great work BTW and thanx."

,echo873,2011-07-12T03:35Z,what are your x264 flags?
,Lomedin,2011-07-16T02:16Z,"jake16, no offense, but you are an idiot. ""And I love no subs""? What kind of crap is that? If a movie gives the option to load subtitles and you don't like them, you can just disable them. 
I suppose you are not into foreign cinema. Unless you love shit dubbing, of course (something that wouldn't surprise me after your comment).
However, people who want/need them are basically fucked. 
I guess they can be found on the net easily anyway, regardless how much you might have to play with the sync to make them work.
Alas, thanks for the upload (didn't decide to get it yet but yeah)."

,SukisPlaypen,2011-08-21T06:59Z,"@Lomedin, no offense, but your jumping down Jake's throat is waaaay off base. Some vids have subs hardcoded, i.e. always on blocking the bottom of the screen and you can't turn them off. Some of us love vids that do not have hardcoded subs, and prefer separate subtitle files. And (Jesus Christ on a cracker, draw me a map for how you jumped to this conclusion) it's got nothing to do with hating foreign cinema."
