,Sguleba,2011-06-20T07:17Z,"Hi, I'm Brazilian and a  Game Of Thrones fan! I don't understand very well this new ripping method with short files! Can somebody explain it to me? Or indicate me another web pages with some information?
Thanks"

Thanks"" -- Download 7zip (freeware, opensource) from www.7-zip.org. Once it's installed, right click the .rar file in the folder, go to ""7zip"" option, and then ""extract here"". Done."
,nilrib,2011-06-20T07:58Z,Use winrar or something to unrar the files...
,123oliveira4,2011-06-20T08:02Z,"@Sguleba
Cara, isso é um arquivo torrent. Você primeiro precisa baixar um client torrent. uTorrent, por exemplo, ou Azureus Vuze, que também é muito bom. Depois de baixar algum client torrent, você abre esse arquivo pequeno que tem como final "".torrent"", no programa que você tem, coloca para iniciar, ou forçar inicio e espere baixar."
,unpocoloco,2011-06-20T08:08Z,"@Sguleba For years, soon decades, they have compressed the files with RAR, why?
Today bots send the files to or between countless servers and how do you verify nothing went wrong on the way? with the SFV file (Simple file verification) that is generated when the file is compressed at the source.

,naufragus,2011-06-20T08:14Z,yet another release no one will be seeding because its needlessly RARed.  Wait for the the TVTeam version.  
,ImSoJaded,2011-06-20T09:21Z,"If you don't want to bother with outdated scene delivery practices (i.e. movies split into several rar archives), download the official eztv torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6481872/Game_of_Thrones_S01E10_720p_HDTV_x264-ORENJI_[eztv]"
,spacep0pe,2011-06-20T15:24Z,what is it about .rar's that makes it so intolerable it leads insecure children to rant so much?  
,Sguleba,2011-06-20T21:57Z,"I understand Rar method...but file seems smaller than usual, but the regular def is the same size, except the bitrate! Seems curious, anyone know why that is? Look at this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6470355/White.Collar.S03E02.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION

Dimension did a declaration!"
