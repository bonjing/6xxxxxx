1.  If you are connected to the internet more than a few minutes. (How to block this???)
2.  If you have already used this serial number on the same computer with another drive.
Sorry, but I don't have the skills you guys do to fix this.  HELP PLEASE???"

STORAGE CRYPT, here on PirateBay - AWESOME.  As fast as USB Secure, as simple, as easy...  STORAGECRYPT STORAGECRYPT...!!!

If I find problems, I'll let you know."
