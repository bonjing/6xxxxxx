The release date for Japan has not been revealed, and there has been no mention if all 3 versions will be available. Due to the very limited printing of the Limited Edition and the high demand, VÃ¶lkerball sold out and more copies of it had to be produced. Interestingly, the phrase "To Be Continued\" is printed on the 
back page of the VÃ¶lkerball booklet.

Name
VÃ¶lkerball is the German name for the game of dodge ball. Literally it means Peoples' Ball. One could also think that the combination of the word Ball, being a dancing event like English ball or prom, in connection with Peoples and relating to the musical act Rammstein, means Dancing/Musical event of (all) peoples.
