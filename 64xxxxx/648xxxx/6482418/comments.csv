,10011100,2011-06-21T23:50Z,"Verry Nice, Thanks, works fine for me on Windows 7 - 64. Use 7-zip and you will find the 4 iso - files. Open the iso and you will find the 4 DVD's. Burn and install runs smoothly. Keygen and host - patch on DVD 3. 

More comments could be usefull."
,freepascal,2011-06-23T14:14Z,RETAIL! That's what i want. It will be better if there is a Master Collection suite.
,nqwua87,2011-08-10T04:21Z,"Hey.  Just downloaded and now seeding.  However, how do I install the thing?  There is no read me file with instructions, so I am not quite sure what to do?"
,nqwua87,2011-08-10T08:14Z,"OKAY, So I have now downloaded 7-Zip, extracted the files, then burnt the 4 DVDs.
Got the keygen and Patch sorted out.  
Insert disk 1.  Set up starts, enter the serial, and all is fine...
THEN, it gets a fatal error and quits the install.  The fatal error is:
 FATAL: DW020: Conflicts were found in the selected payloads. Halting installation.
Any help would be appreciated"

,nqwua87,2011-08-10T14:10Z,"Alright then,, Figured out the error.. I have Design Premium on the PC also, and wasnt selecting install all.. I ended up choosing to install all the programs, and it worked fine.. Can recommend the download..... 
Final problem for me is, the PC I use at home only has a 32bit windows 7 OS... In disk 4 is the Production Pro CS4 + After Effects CS4.... But the keygen does not have this program in there,, and none of the generated serials work... 
Just using the trial version for now, and can always download those programs later... 
THANKS HEAPS UPLOADER!!!"
,applev7,2011-08-16T08:55Z,I want the serial or crack????
,nijgreen,2011-10-18T18:38Z,"Thanks to all involved, works well, no problems! I`ll just add a couple of tips, I updated mine, which caused a couple of problems, each time you re open one of the Programmes it automatically connects to the internet and cancels the product key! (Saying not valid)
Solution: Use your firewall to block the programmes so that they cannot connect to the internet and just re-enter a new product key (problem solved) your programme will stay activated
If you are not sure how to do this! just Google: ""How to stop a programme connecting to the internet"" I run Windows 7 64bit, Don`t forget to check minimum requirements for these programmes, hope this helps.
THANKS UPLOADER MUCH APPRECIATED."
