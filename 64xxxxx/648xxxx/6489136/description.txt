 Night On My Side is the debut album from Gemma Hayes. With her lazy southern drawl and a beaten and bruised collection of broken-hearted country, Gemma should by rights have grown-up in hick town America, not Tipperary, Ireland. Indeed, with its campfire laments on life, love and escape, Night On My Side isn't a million dusty miles from the dead-beat introspection of Texan cowgirl-slacker Shea Seger's debut, The May Street Project. 
 A solitary soul laid bare, the tender plod of "Day One", fragile hope and honesty of "My God" and "Over & Over"'s drowsy regret are not so much cathartic venting, as late night diary confessions and captured moments. It's not what she says, but the passion with which she says it that makes her songs so phenomenally poignant. Aided by Mercury Rev and Flaming Lips producer Dave Fridmann, she doesn't just tell tales, she conjures full-blooded emotions. The details of "Back Of My Hand"'s unrequited love are irrelevant, it's the sinking feeling that counts. And when the Radiohead strength chorus crashes into "Let A Good Thing Go", and the speaker tearing white noise and guitar overdrive erupt in "Lucky One" they deliver a sense of loss like no words ever could. --Dan Gennoe
