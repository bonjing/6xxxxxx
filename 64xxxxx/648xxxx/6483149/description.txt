While other West Coast jazz pianists during the Fifties and early Sixties cut their share -- and some perhaps more than that -- of albums for a variety of recording firms, Russ Freemanâ€™s output of records under his own name was nowhere near enough to reflect his enormous talent. Thanks to his involvement in the groups of such standard bearers as Howard McGhee, Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper and Wardell Gray, he developed rapidly and when Chet Baker made his first quartet recordings in December 1952, he chose Freeman as pianist, composer and musical director. Freemanâ€™s reputation also earned him a place with the Lighthouse All-Stars, Shorty Rogers Giants and, for ten years from 1955, with Shelly Manne and his Men. 

This CD is dedicated to the memory of Russ Freeman (1926-2002), an extraordinary but too often underrated jazz pianist who deserves a place among the greatest.
