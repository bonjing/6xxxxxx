Subs that sync (thanks to exaulted) by release group (720p versions):

Episode 1: CTU
Episode 2: CTU
Episode 3: CTU
Episode 4: MrMoody
Episode 5: MrMoody
Episode 6: EbP

If anyone have tested the sync for later 1080i releases if would be appreciated.

And a big thanks to KaLaNco69 for distributing the release on TBP ;)"
