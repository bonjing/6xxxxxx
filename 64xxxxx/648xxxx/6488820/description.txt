Plot
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E.F. Bloodworth has returned to his home - a forgotten corner of Tennessee -
after forty years of roaming. The wife he walked out on has withered and faded,
his three sons are grown and angry. Warren is a womanizing alcoholic, Boyd is
driven by jealousy to hunt down his wife and her lover, and Brady puts hexes on
his enemies from his mamma's porch. Only Fleming, the old man's grandson, treats
him with the respect his age commands, and sees past all the hatred to realize
the way it can poison a man's soul. It is ultimately the love of Raven Lee, a
sloe-eyed beauty from another town, that gives Fleming the courage to reject
this family curse.
