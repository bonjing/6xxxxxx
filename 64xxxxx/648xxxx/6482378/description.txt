We would like to invite you to our 21st century Balearic spectacular based on the Disco nights that inspired the music, parties and culture of contemporary dance music. The heavenly Hed Kandi will be partying the nights away every Saturday at Es Paradis from the 4th of June. Welcome to Discoâ€™s Revenge! 

Hed Kandi is going back to their roots for 17 weeks of debauched fun and escapism celebrating the sound and lifestyle that defined the Hed Kandi that we all know and love today. The hands-in-the-air feel good house tunes played by all the Hed Kandi DJs today originated from the classic Disco tunes of yesterday. The Disco era also laid the foundations for opulent theatrical themed events. As well as paying homage to the iconic music, Hed Kandi will reproduce the decadent lifestyle that redefined the Disco scene from one iconic club to another - the fabulous and fashionable, jet set, glamorous and beautiful crowds dominating the dancefloors from sunset to sunrise. 

Discoâ€™s Revenge is the place to party, be sexy and lose yourself in true hedonistic Hed Kandi style we will not only tantalize your ears but also your eyes with Studio 54 inspired roller girls, lavish live shows, exquisite dancers, mind boggling aerial artists and acrobats beautifully co-ordinating a visual feast whilst our roster of Hed Kandi DJs and diva performers entice your dancing feet with their uplifting Disco inspired beats. 

Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, youâ€™ll land amongst the stars
