osx86 leo4all usb image


If you wan't to install hackintosh(leo4all in this case) from usb without the hassle of doing it yourself then look no further.

What this is exactly:
This is an exact copy(.img) of an 8GB usb thumbdrive with leo4all in combination with the chameleon v2 bootloader to be able to boot from it.

What you need:
-semi hacker skillz(basic knowledge of linux, disks and partitions, mac,...)
-a usb drive of at least 8gb(less WILL NOT WORK!!!)
-a linux distribution of your choice (with dd capability) or a program that writes .img to usb
-a pc that can boot from usb
-the requirements for leo4all(normal version)

Install:
-download and extract the zip file
-either write with the .img writing program or issue a dd in linux
-change the bios boot sequence to boot from usb first
-install as you would install a regular leo4all (google = your friend ^^)

enjoy!
