[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/06/23

 
[AIR DATE....]: 2011/06/22

 
[GENRE.......]: Reality/Documentary

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
Six ordinary Australians agree to challenge their preconceived
notions about refugees and asylum seekers by embarking on
a confronting 25-day journey. Tracing in reverse the journeys
that refugees have taken to reach Australia, they travel to
some of the most dangerous and desperate corners of the
world, with no idea what is in store for them along the way.

Deprived of their wallets, phones and passports, they board a
leaky refugee boat, are rescued mid-ocean, experience
immigration raids in Malaysia, live in a Kenyan refugee camp
and visit slums in Jordan before ultimately making it to the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq, protected by UN
Peacekeepers and the US military. For some of them its their
first time abroad. For all of them, its an epic journey and the
most challenging experience of their lives.
