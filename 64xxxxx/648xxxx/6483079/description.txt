Armchair Committee EP2

The result of a few months recording in the band's ramshackle home studio, comes EP2. A marked transition from their first release, EP2 shows them expand on their original formula. The EP explodes out of the gate with the full-on electronic heavy rock of "Shouting 'Fire!' in a Crowded Theatre", flowing through other tracks which include far-ranging influences from folk, blues, alternative rock and electro.

Recorded during the British bands stay in America, EP2 focused on creating a cohesive sense of travel by utilising soundbites from street sellers in New York City to wandering through the woodlands of Lake Crabtree in North Carolina.
