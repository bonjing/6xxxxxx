,graitor,2011-06-22T16:40Z,"Funny I download the March version and then it suddenly says the June version is out not an hour later.

I am curious if I can simply repair my current version of XP, I am getting ""the rebooting"" problem as it seems to be called. "
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-06-22T17:01Z,"many could be the causes in case of a rebooting problem.

the remedy depends upon the explicit message it may subsequently post on the screen...

if it says the ntldr is missing, obviuosly you reinstall, cause you deleted it or moved on another partition.

to cut it short...remove any USB devices... enter bios and verify the HDD priority to be the same with that of the moment you choosed to install the OS...then save and exit bios, start PC again, enter safe mode ( if it lets you) and uninstall the video driver and also latest progs or drivers you remember having them installed lately..then reboot..if this does not help..use a live xp cd...to boot from it, load the live os... browse for the files and save them on another partition and install xp deleting the partition, recreating the partition...formatting"
,graitor,2011-06-22T17:17Z,"I started up Steam and it suddenly restarted while logging me in, hasn't gotten past the windows looading scrolling loading bar since, and safemode wont work either.

Everywhere I've gone basically told me to try and repair it using the disc, and if that didn't work to just reinstall it."
,jersson,2011-06-22T17:23Z,I have Win/7 installed as default and want to install XP as well. (I prefer XP) On my D-Partition I have Recovery installed so where do I install XP ? Or perhaps I cannot ?
,graitor,2011-06-22T17:36Z,"I apologize for taking up more space with a comment, and I'm not even sure what you're torrenting fixed it, however thank you a ton.

All the disks I had bought were faulty, so I had to put this on a USB. The first time I tried to boot from it, it gave me the ""ntldr is missing"" problem(on the USB), I then tried it again and it gave me a list of things I could do, I chose GUI startup or something +restart windows, that seemed to do the trick. 

I am happy to seed for this torrent since it helped me out a ton."

,slayermbm,2011-07-07T04:13Z,"Does this version include wireless drivers for laptops man? I tried Maherz version but I coudn't connect due to lack of drivers. 

My laptop is an HP Pavillion dv2700.

Thanks."
,rknight2010,2011-07-19T07:27Z,"@dspanchal

its 32Bit didn't u read?

- English 32 bits version
- No serial, no activation (provided you burn a CD and install XP by booting from it on a clean partition)
- BUY a new, unscratched CD blank and burn this iso image using 16x speed, not 48x !

Optionally you may choose to install from the Utils Directory, usefull Full version software		"
