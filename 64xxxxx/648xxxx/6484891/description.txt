Tausend Ozeane

Five friends spend their holidays on a faraway island in the sea. On the last day of the holidays, out of the blue, BjÃ¶rn informs his friends that he will not return home but intends to stay in this paradise forever. There is no sign of life from BjÃ¶rn after that. His best friend Meikel is very concerned about the mysterious disappearance - but nobody cares and no one helps him in his search for the lost friend.
