,keerochee,2011-06-20T09:22Z,"no need to add sample, all your rips are great. empire records, eurotrip, 51st state, kung fu hustle (english), ben hur and taking chance, any plans ripping them from blu-ray to xvid 720p? thanks again!"
,mikelfann,2011-06-22T12:08Z,thankyou!
,PsychoLogic,2011-07-04T15:14Z,Kung Fu Hustle is the only one of those I can get a source for. The rest are available in HDTV rips... but they're not great already so I don't want to re-rip them.

,UAofE,2012-05-21T20:25Z,Samples are for retarded people.
