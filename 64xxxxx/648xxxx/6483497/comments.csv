,Mac Genius,2011-06-21T02:51Z,"You have surely read all of this before, but here we go again....
Your uploads are hands down the best ones of 
every current mkv lover & uploader!
however, the standalones in my country get the avi working, not the mkv, I don't think it works anywhere & may be not so soon, so... how do we get this working on the standalone from a PC / Mac?
Looking forward to your answer"

I had a hunch about it, am from across the globe, we do not seem to be getting them soon.
Converting surely does not hold the charm of the file, Thanks much for every kb that you are sharing & uploading & also helping us see it :)"

Gr8 work yify always been your fan. +10 for this"
,martialis,2011-06-22T02:25Z,"dear yiffy,

For movies with subtitles, please include 2 sets of subtitles per language (for example, english).  One for everything, and one for only the foreign dialogue.  Your torrents are fantastic, but constant subtitles are so distracting that I avoid them."
