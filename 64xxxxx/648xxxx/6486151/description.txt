T he human senses are what people use to gather information and understand the world around them. Traditionally, it has been determined that there are five sensesâ€”sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. More recently, however, experts have also added another, called proprioception, or an awareness of the body in space. Sense organs recognize changes in the environment. These changes are called stimuli. Specialized cells called sensory receptors convert the stimuli into impulses that are carried by a network of nerves to the spinal cord and to the brain. Each sense organ has a specific path to the brain. Sensory information is processed in specific areas inside the brain.
