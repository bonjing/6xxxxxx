,ManLemon,2011-06-21T23:12Z,"Excellent! I just finished ep 10 (wow!) and thought it was time to check out the musical score. thanks man :D

p.s. what's the bitrate on this one? "
,Anubis_Seth,2011-06-21T23:47Z,"No Worries ManLemon, This is my First EVER torrent, Glad it's a good one :)

The Bitrate is 256 kbps
Sample Rate is 44.100 kHz

This is by far the best show of its Genre. In my humble opinion it puts Camelot to utter and obvious Shame."
