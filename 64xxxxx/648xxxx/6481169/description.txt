This package includes The Sims Medieval Patch 1.3.13 and the relvant Crack, both found online somewhere. I saw a lot of requests for this and so, uploaded it.

Please be patient, I have a very slow upload speed, but since it's a relvantly small file, it shouldn't take long. Moreover, it's the best I can do, so please no hatin' :).

Instructions:

1. Go to the Patch folder and run the .exe file which should automatically update
   the game.
2. Go to the Crack folder and copy all of the files into the Game>bin folder in
   your installation directory.
3. Enjoy! :)

I have tested this on the RELOADED release of the game and it works fine for me.

I guarantee nothing!
