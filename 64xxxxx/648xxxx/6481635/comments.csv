No real group is using RAR files. 

Again, you should stop downloading, unless you want your ass sued.

advice - go download from eztv."

,najaraja,2011-06-20T05:36Z,"Actually, I haven't had any problems watching any of the eps uploaded by this person.  I think the problem is that PartyOn doesn't know how to use 7-zip or WinRAR"
