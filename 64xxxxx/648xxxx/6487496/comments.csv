,Imrambo,2011-06-28T00:48Z,Works like a charm
,fr334a11,2011-07-02T08:19Z,"IDIOTS,
yes Norton is crap and will call this a virus, it is known as a false positive!

why would you post serials online, now they will be blacklisted
my question is it a true keygen or just displays a list of keys"
,s3ah3n,2011-08-25T19:48Z,"When I ran it I got the 7JQWQ key as well, which suggests the space it generates from is too small. A keygen that uses too few bits of randomness is useless, since M$ can just run it for a few core-hours to generate all the possible keys and blacklist them."
,ausvirgo,2011-09-07T14:44Z,"When I ran it for Windows 7 Ultimate, it only ""generated"" 4 different keys, then kept repeating.

Two of the keys are in the keys.ini file of Windows Loader v2.06, and ALL are in the list posted here by jamaar.

re fr334all's question ""is it a true keygen or just displays a list of keys"", it seems to be just a list of keys, especially as jamar says he extracted the keys he posted without running the program.

Does anyone know of a genuine Windows 7 Ultimate keygen that generates keys that work? The Windows 7 Keygens that I've tried seem to either create a lot of useless keys, or just display a few keys from a built-in list."
,nautica002,2012-01-11T02:02Z,i have windows 7 enterprise n. i dont see a keygen for it. ohh well
