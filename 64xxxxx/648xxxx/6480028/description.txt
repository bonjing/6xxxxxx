RELEASE NOTES

It's about to get really real in here.

Seeing this new official Young Jeezy mixtape gave us a feeling we
haven't had itn a while...it's something we've all been waiting for a
while for. It's a moment we weren't even sure would ever happen. And
that overwhelming anxiousness over the mythical release of Jeezy's TM103
might finally be over. And the trap world seems all better again.

Cuz DJ Drama is back riding with Young Jeezy, and vice versa, so after a
public falling out and feud, Dram and Jeezy are back to make magic one
more time for the record books. For the first time since 2006, Jeezy and
Drama are puttin in work and releasing this epic mixtape appetizer to
Thug Motivation 103.

Featuring a gang of exclusive production from Lil' Lody and appearances
from Gotti, Weezy, Fabolous, Tity Boi and Alley Boy; plus features from
CTE/USDA's Slick Pulla, Freddie Gibbs, Boo, Scrilla and 211.
