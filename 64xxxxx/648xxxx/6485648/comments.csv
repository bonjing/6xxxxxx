[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-23T02:56Z,"The title is just ""Arrietty"", and shame about the lack of English audio.

Any reason for deleting Memento?"
,john depp,2011-06-24T02:51Z,"Hey GoodFilms.  What happened with the quality of 28 days later?  That was so not like you.  I don't mean to be bitchy but could you please post good quality version?  It happens to be my favorite zombie movie.

 Thanks and always appreciate your work."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-24T17:30Z,READ THE DESCRIPTION on 28 Days Later. It looks how it does FOR A REASON. It can't look any better.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-24T17:31Z,and the best way of contacting me really isn't by commenting on someone else's torrent. you can comment on my most recent torrent or at suprbay or at hexagon.
,Hillwalker,2011-06-25T01:03Z,"Thanks for another great upload.

There isn't an English language version available for some time, as GoodFims knows full well."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-25T12:31Z,"Yes, I do know that. So I will go see it at the cinema in a few weeks."
,john depp,2011-06-25T23:42Z,"GoodFilms:  Let's just continue our discussion here.  Well I read the description and you are right:  28 Days Later was supposed to be that way.  

Anyways,how come so many negative ratings for your uploads lately?  Holly some movies are like over -60.  I personally think your movies are fine.  This is a result of your shitty attitude maybe?  

Oh well. cheer up."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-26T23:41Z,"I don't have a shitty attitude.

I am actually a very cheery person.

The negative votes are all from one person who I have a thing with. If someone genuinely doesn't like the quality of something, they say it in a COMMENT.

Have a nice day."
