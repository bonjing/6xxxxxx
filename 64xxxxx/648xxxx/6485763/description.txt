An ambitious mix of jazz, blues, prog and rock, with horns and the electric violin of Jerry Goodman, who would later join Mahavishnu Orchestra. They benefited from an intense promotion from CBS who tried to launch them with Blood, Sweat & Tears, Aorta and Chicago. Their records may sound dated now.
