Here is another of my big, messy archives of Buddhist texts, this one full of texts related to Mahayana Buddhism. (Please note that I have already uploaded a library of Zen and Pureland texts, which are in the Mahayana tradition.) Like the rest of what is becoming a series, these were on an old hard drive.

I can get them up and out more quickly if I just upload them as they are. I hope that some of you who download this torrent will clean up this selection, change formats (there does not seem to be much Buddhist material in epub/Nook or mobi/Kindle formats).

Formats include .txt, .doc, .rft, .pdf, and .html - nothing in .epub or .mobi. The texts are in English. I suspect that most of these come from the amazing free online libraries of Buddhanet.net, but I am not sure.

May all beings be happy, and may all beings who download this torrent help to seed it.

I have also uploaded libraries of Theravada Buddhist, Tibetan Buddhist, Zen Buddhist, and Pureland Buddhist texts. Please check my other torrents for other Buddhist texts.
