If anyone actually does make money with this information, let us know, okay?"
,tickturd,2011-08-27T13:06Z,"I got the ""404 file not found error"" also, but tried the magnet link and it seems to be working."
,SpiderMonkey81,2011-08-31T06:17Z,"I had to use the Magnet Link to but it worked. That's the only thing with this book that works! Thank you for sharing this, now I won't throw away my money on black ink that means nothing. There's about 10-15 links he gives over and over about 500 times.

Thanks again"
,SumeklamKidd,2011-09-02T07:55Z,"Apologies only the magnet link works. This is my first upload, so I must have done something wrong. Also, a few of the pages are blotched I know, but I didn't see the value in spending any more time than I did with the two hours it took to copy and compile it. Enough info intact to get the gist of his scam.

Trudeau is simply a master salesperson, selling ice to Eskimos is his M.O. Took several phone calls and a lot of hassle to get my money back for his book. He even claims he makes no money from this book! What a crock!"
,dvanderl,2011-09-05T19:26Z,"This book is so much trash.  I can't believe any publisher would publish this crap.  Half the websites he gives you require you to pay money just to search for ""free money.""  I am sure that the author and the admins of these sites are in on it all together.  This guy shouldn't be allowed to write books."
,seabpa,2012-01-02T14:58Z,"The New York state Consumer Protection Board warns those who follow Kevin Trudeau's advice to call a toll-free number for information that Trudeau is selling their name and contact information to telemarketers and junk mailers. 

Some of Trudeau's customers have also complained of unexpected charges for his newsletter and discount purchase programs. (10/28/05)

Trudeau's troubles with the FTC continue. The FTC charges that Trudeau ""deceptively claimed"" in infomercials that the weight-loss plan outlined in his latest book is ""easy to do, can be done at home, and ultimately allows readers to eat whatever they want."" The diet actually ""requires severe dieting,"" daily injections of a prescription drug not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for weight loss, and ""lifelong dietary restrictions.""* Read the FTC press release of Sept. 14, 2007.

Kevin Trudeau is the author of Natural Cures ""They"" Don't Want You to Know About and Debt Cures ""They"" Donâ€™t Want You to Know About. You may have seen him in infomercials where he claims, among many other questionable things, that you can't get cancer in alkaline cells and that cancer can be cured by changing the pH of the cancerous cells to alkaline. He has promoted Robert Barefoot in an infomercial touting the value of coral calcium and has erroneously claimed that a JAMA study on calcium showed that coral calcium had cured many cases of terminal cancer (Barrett 2004). Trudeau and Barefoot claim that coral calcium and alkaline water can neutralize blood acidity. However, Gabe Mirkin, M.D., warns:

Anyone who tells you that certain foods or supplements make your stomach or blood acidic does not understand nutrition. 

You should not believe that it matters whether foods are acidic or alkaline, because no foods change the acidity of anything in your body except your urine. Your stomach is so acidic that no food can change its acidity. Citrus fruits, vinegar, and vitamins such as ascorbic acid or folic acid do not change the acidity of your stomach or your bloodstream. An entire bottle of calcium pills or antacids would not change the acidity of your stomach for more than a few minutes. 

All foods that leave your stomach are acidic. Then they enter your intestines where secretions from your pancreas neutralize the stomach acids. So no matter what you eat, the food in the stomach is acidic and the food in the intestines is alkaline. 

You cannot change the acidity of any part of your body except your urine. Your bloodstream and organs control acidity in a very narrow range. Anything that changed acidity in your body would make you very sick and could even kill you. (Mirkin 2003)
Kevin Trudeau's credentials in marketing can't be denied, but there is some question as to his credentials in matters of nutrition.

During the early 1990s, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Trudeau served nearly two years in prison. In 1990, he pled guilty to larceny in a Cambridge, Massachusetts, state court in connection with $80,000 in worthless checks he had deposited at a bank. The sentencing memorandum said that he had posed as a doctor to increase his credibility with bank officials. In 1991, he pled guilty to credit-card fraud in Boston federal district court. Among his misdeeds in the federal case, he misappropriated for his own use the credit-card numbers of customers of the memory-improvement courses that he offered at the time. (Barrett 2004)
In the credit card swindle, he defrauded American Express out of $122,735.68. He also swindled about five grand from several banks, including Chemical and Citibank. The Smoking Gun has posted a copy of the indictment.

Presumably, Nutrition for Life International Inc. (NFLI) knew about Trudeau's past when it took him on as a business partner. NFLI, an MLM outfit specializing in such things as shark cartilage capsules and other equally beneficial nutritional supplies went into bankruptcy in 2003,* but not before m"
,TheGriffinman,2012-01-16T07:33Z,"SumeklamKidd, Kudos to you for posting this!  This infomercial just popped on while I was browsing the net, and, as usual, I research anything that catches my attention.  Of course I expected this is a scam, and the first place I turned to was the piratebay.  You know, snubs their noses at us, we're the bad guys, because we steal.  No one jumps to our defense when we pay to see a movie that turns out to be garbage, like 90% of them are, but let us download a movie for free, and we're horrible for stealing pennies from a billionaire.  And then you have a scam like this...Pirating a pirate.  I sleep just fine at night, my friend, and so should you.  My brother, keep on keeping on! "
,cojon,2012-01-30T14:19Z,"WOW! That downloaded instantly! Thanks seeders.  

I am Dr. J.M. Cook, a (disabled) behavioral psychologist and I will be examining this controversial work for reality.  In truth, it may be accurate.  I say this because as a psychologist i am aware of the ineptitude of Americans. We expect things to fall our way. If we have to work or do something unusual for it, we are inclined to consider it impossible.  I have lived much of my life doing the impossible just because others are so unwilling to.  Through this I have built a unique life.

Now, lets see if there is any actual reality to this book. Fear not, I will report it with reality as my guide. I do not BS. I have found the absolute truth a far better tool.   "
,rubthezz,2012-03-06T11:54Z,"@cojon you are a and I quote ""a (disabled) behavioral psychologist"" and you are in affect stealing a book? Then you go on to say ""I say this because as a psychologist i am aware of the ineptitude of Americans"" Lol wow its simply amazing that there are people like yourself breathing our good air. The only thing you did right was thanking the uploader and seeders in that post. this statement ""I do not BS"" Should read you are full of shit. Thanks for the upload!!!!"
,miked45419,2012-04-14T19:59Z,"Trudeau is right, free money......for him from the schmucks that bought his book(s)."
