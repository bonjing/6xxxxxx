JonDo is the ip changer proxy tool you have to install on your computer. It acts as a proxy and will forward the traffic of your internet applications encrypted to the mix cascades and so it will hide your ip address. It is a Java application, open source and you can download it for free. You may use JonDonym for free, but free mix cascades are restricted in some cases. Full speed and anonymisation features you will get only with a premium account.

JonDo will provide an anonymisation proxy for you, but it does NOT change your system setting. You have to configure the proxy setting of each internet application you want to use anonymous with JonDonym by self. Tutorials you may find in our online help and in our wiki.
