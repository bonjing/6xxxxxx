|   When I heard Underworld's first album (Dubnobasswithmyheadman, not one     |
|   of their attrocious releases during the late eighties), I didn't really    |
|   care much for it. After giving a few more listens, though, it grew to be   |
|   one of the more-liked discs in my collection. There was something about    |
|   their fusion of electronic music and lyrics (albeit stream-of-conscious,   |
|   surreal nonsensical ones) that I really found appealing. They were the     |
|   only group to that point to pull it off with any success at all and it     |
|   prompted me to search out all their subsequent releases and purchase       |
|   them as well. The great thing about them, was that they hadn't             |
|   dissapointed me yet with anything. After releasing the Pearls Girl EP in   |
|   1997, though, they kind of dropped-off the face of the planet to take      |
|   some time off and then record their new disc.                              |
|                                                                              |
|   Over the course of the last few months, the buzz for it has been           |
|   building steadily and I read several different places proclaiming          |
|   (probably before they had heard anything from the disc itself) that it     |
|   just could be the album that breaks electronica truly into the             |
|   mainstream and positions Underworld atop the heap. It was quite a bit to   |
|   shoulder for one group, and now that I've heard the album, I know that     |
|   nothing that I've been hearing will probably happen. It's not that the     |
|   album is bad, it's just that it's not going to appeal to the masses.       |
|                                                                              |
|   I'll even admit that the first time I heard the disc, I was                |
|   underwhelmed. I'm sure it was partially due to my own personal             |
|   expectations, and partially due to all the things that had been swirling   |
|   in my ears. Once again, though, after a couple listens, I've found it      |
|   near the top of my rotation pile. The disc starts out with "Cups," an      |
|   almost 12-minute track that doesn't really get going until about 8         |
|   minutes through. After that, though, the disc follows on cue as some       |
|   excellent work (minus my like/hate relationship with track 7 entitled,     |
|   "Bruce Lee"). "Shudder/King Of Snake" is a 10-minute track in the vein     |
|   of some of their older, pounding work and mellow tracks like "Winjer"      |
|   and "Skym" provide a bit of calm before the blistering of "Kittens" and    |
|   the pounding "Born Slippy"-like album closer entitled, "Moaner." If you    |
|   like the groups other work, you'll definitely want to pick this up, even   |
|   though it may take awhile to grow on you. Just don't expect a              |
|   revolution. [almostcool.com]                                               |
