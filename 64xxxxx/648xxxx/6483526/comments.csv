,Rottenyouth,2011-08-15T11:34Z,"Cheers for the upload - I left it run over night while I was asleep and it took roughly 10 hours it seems, I'll be seeding this entirely.

Loving the uploads Badman, keep 'em coming!"
,GamezandM,2011-08-15T12:29Z,"I just installed World Adventures and I already have Sims 3 and Generations installed. I am using mac and put the crack in the gamebin. But when I open Sims, I get this errorcode: Unhandles page fault on read acces to 0x00000000 at addres 0x00000000. Do you wish to debug it? Whether I choose yes or no, nothing happens. Does someone know what to do about this?"

,Thecloyd101,2011-11-23T22:00Z,"Badman, you are a life saver! Thanks so much this works great! For those of you having trouble opening it, you should open it from the bin folder instead from your desktop. Have fun!"

,ABluChimp,2012-02-20T19:08Z,"what are the serial codes for all of the expansions you have put on, Badman959?
I have used the ones provided by xXBLACKXx for the original Sims 3, Generations, Late Night and World Adventures (this one) but I still need the ones for Ambitions, High End Lot Stuff, Outdoor Living Stuff and Fast Lane Stuff

Am I just being retarded or what?

thanks"
,cooglies,2012-04-17T17:58Z,Say I wanted to add Sims 3 Pets after this. What do I do with the two overwritten files in the Game Bin? Do I overwrite those with the Pets files?
