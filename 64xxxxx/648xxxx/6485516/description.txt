Hello everyone who actually know about this game.

This is a Japanese game where you go annoy people around the Earth; literally, I am not kidding. Using different items you shape shift into humans and annoy other beings as that human. Well anyway, you will figure it out once you play it. It is for the PS2, and if anyone needs an emulator, well, PCSX2 is amazing. Use that.

If something does not work please tell me.

Also, of course, there are no viruses. I do not understand why anyone makes those things. If there is though... Well I have something to check in my computer then because I had no idea of it. Just saying.

Enjoy, and thank you.
