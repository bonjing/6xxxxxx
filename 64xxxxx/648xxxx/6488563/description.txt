There are women that drive the passions of man,
that speak to those emotions most central to
their being. This release is dedicated to our
celtic Queen Guinevere, the Queen of the board
on which we play.

We wish you all the best and hope that you will
have a great time enjoying our services.

Special greetings to some of our friends at ..
