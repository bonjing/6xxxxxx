,MySacrifice4Freedom,2011-06-26T17:02Z,"Just thought I'd add this, I believe the Spoken languages are: German, Russian. (The Russian dub is poorly done, the German audio can still be heard and at times drowns out the Russian dub. It's like having two people talk at once.) Does anyone else have this problem?"

In this case, at least they left the original audio (German, it's originally a German movie) intact in a separate audio stream, often enough they simply overdub in Russian and destroy the original audio."
