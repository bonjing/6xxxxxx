Release Notes:

The Harrow & The Harvest features ten new songs recorded
at her own Woodland Sound Studios in Nashville, Tennessee
and produced by David Rawlings. The Harrow & The Harvest,
"is a new Southern sound," writes Colin Meloy of The
Decemberists, "with the sort of songs you wouldn't be
surprised to hear issuing from some verdant, wooded hollow
in Appalachia; Songs you'd expect to hear hollered from an
Asheville grange hall, all too late in the evening. Songs
with the wry humour of the back porch. Listen to this
record with the lights low. Listen to it on an old radio,
cradled next to your ear.". Welch and Rawlings met at
Berklee College of Music in Boston. Together, they moved
to Nashville, TN, where most of their work together has
been produced. Since then, they have influenced and
inspired new generations of country and folk singers,
songwriters and players. They have earned the slavish
admiration of many of the most lauded and loved voices of
the Americana milieu, and had their songs recorded by the
likes of Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, and Solomon Burke.
