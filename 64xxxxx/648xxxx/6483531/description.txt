Plot
Based on Rosemary Sutcliff\'s 1954 novel, \"The Eagle of the Ninth,\" The Eagle tells the solemn
tale of Marcus Flavius Aquila (Channing Tatum, G.I. Joe), a young centurion dispatched to command
a small but crucial garrison in Britain. Years before, his father led the Ninth Legion northward,
never to be heard from again. The legion\'s prized Eagle standard was lost as well, the Aquila
family name was tarnished, and Marcus grows up through the ranks of the Roman military determined
to restore his family\'s honor. That becomes more difficult though when he\'s wounded in battle,
honorably discharged for his actions, and sent to live with his uncle (Donald Sutherland) in the
southern town of Calleva. Difficult, but not impossible. With the help of a Celtic slave named
Esca (Jamie Bell, Defiance), Marcus travels north, beyond Hadrian\'s Wall, to track down and recover
the Ninth Legion\'s lost Eagle standard. Marcus and Esca soon find themselves in increasingly
hostile territory, following whatever clues might point them in the direction of his father\'s
last known whereabouts.
