,zedmike,2011-09-11T04:18Z,"Good day TheThingy. i cant find a way to get in contact with you... as i would expect... and i also cant find a way to graciously do this so here: Huge project, doing a documentary on Pirating to submit to the film festivals this season, hopefully. I have always been a huge fan of your uploads, adobe especially. We would humbly ask for few comments if you can.

PS- sorry for the spamming "
