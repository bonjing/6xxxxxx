Searing ambient temperatures, rocky, undulating roads and dust combine to make Acropolis Rally of Greece one of the most taxing on the World Rally Championship calendar with car and driver subjected to a particularly stern test. 
Greece missed out on a slot on the 2010 WRC schedule and its absence was keenly felt, not just by the fans that descend on the event in great number, but also by the drivers. The Acropolis is one of the most iconic events in the sport and winning it earns significant kudos. 
The event has endured something of a nomadic existence in recent years with the base chopping and changing between various locations around the Greek capital Athens. However, its move to Loutraki for 2009, the last time the event took place, proved a hit and the city on the east coast of the Gulf of Corinth will continue to host the rally in 2011. 
However, while day two and three of the event and the permanent service park and rally headquarters will be based in Loutraki, Athens and Kamena Vourla both feature on the itinerary. 
The ceremonial start will take place in the historic Acropolis site in Athens while Fridayâ€™s stages are based around Kemena Vourla, where a remote service will be held. The Greek government is supporting the event, which will be used to promote tourism in the country. 
New for 2011
For the first time, the Acropolis Rally of Greece will have a promoter managing its interests, headed by Greek driver Aris Vovos. Fans are also being encouraged to get involved by voting for potential inductees and selecting the rallyâ€™s new motto through the eventâ€™s official website. The Power Stage will be shown live on television.
