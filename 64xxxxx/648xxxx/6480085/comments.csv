I'll seed for 20x the size."
,ShockDiamond,2012-01-24T13:38Z,"Vader, the only reason the episodes are 100mb each is because they ARE mkv. ;)  Otherwise it would be a 175mb avi.  hehe."

OP - THANK YOU, whoever you are!

ShockDiamond - MKV doesn't play on a standalone DVD player.  Avi and mpeg do.  So, like Vader-- I always prefer something that I don't have to reencode before I can burn.  These, however, I will  most definitely post-process :)  I'll burn them while continuing to seed these original files to at least 110%.

What a great torrent!  THANKS TO ALL YOU SEEDERS!
