All in the Family, Seasons 1 thru 9 Complete

Hi all,

First of all -- many thanks to the uploaders of the first 7 seasons of All in the Family.  Those uploads have brought me hours of entertainment.

What's in this torrent?

The first 7 seasons re-encoded using x264 to be half the size without losing much in quality.

The missing first episode in season 4.

My rips / new encodes of seasons 8 and 9 also using x264 

See: http://www.tv.com/all-in-the-family/show/201/summary.html

Also included are the first two seasons of Archie Bunker's place.
