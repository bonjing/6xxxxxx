Uploaders Comments:
This is a very very good anime i hope you enjoy it. Also Aniplex has announced that the anime will be broadcasted in the U.S. on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block starting June 25, 2011. So i recommend you catch it on there if you don't feel like downloading this. Although I'm sure if you read this much of the description that's not the case. Oh also i will be uploading Durarara!! - Part 02 (DVD set 2) and Durarara!! - Part 03 (DVD set 3) at some point in the future.



Description Of Show:
Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Mikado Ryugamine is a young man who yearns for the city like no other. At the invitation of his childhood friend, Masaomi Kida, he leaves his hometown and enters Raira Academy in Ikebukuro. Masaomi warns Mikado about the mysterious organization of unknown origin known as the "Dollars" and some dangerous people in Ikebukuro to watch out for. In particular: the brawling champion Shizuo Heiwajima and hobbyist information broker Izaya Orihara.

On his first day out in the city, Mikado, remembering another of Masaomiâ€™s stories, sees a jet-black motorcycle being driven by the fabled "Headless Rider." From then on, a series of random attacks and events begins to occur on the streets of Ikebukuro, and a group known as the Yellow Scarves arises as Ikebukuro begins to crumble!
