Venue: Palacio de los Deportes

Recording: AUD
Quality: 6
Menu: NO
Extras: None
Comments: Single cam on the balcony at the very back of the arena. Wide shots are OK but all the closeups shake like crazy. Partially shot on the screen. Blurry, oddly dark, and washed out. Audio is very distant and a bit muffled.
