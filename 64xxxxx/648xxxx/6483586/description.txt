Got this off of my friend and thought I'd upload since all three of the first FEAR games didn't seem to be on here. At least not in a pack or seeded. Scanned it with avast! and detected no threats, and tested on Windows 7 SP1 x64. 

Not much for instructions, just mount or burn the image and install the game. Once installation is finished you will have 3 shortcuts to each of the games respectively, the original took a moment to start for me so just give it time. There is no crack or serial required. 

By the way, I do not take credit for the cracking, I don't know who did it, but kudos to that person for allowing us to play this amazing fps. 

Also the only issue that I experienced was on the original FEAR whenever a checkpoint occurs the game would freeze and go blank for a second before resuming. That could very well be my crappy computer though. I did not experience any issues with the stand alones.
