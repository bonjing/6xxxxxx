,Insomneac,2011-06-21T04:26Z,"This is SO hard to get, thank you."
,thegrimlegion,2011-06-21T06:21Z,"These games scared the shit out of me a few years ago, especially Extraction Point haha. It's gonna be awesome to play them again. Thanks uploader, I'll keep seeding for as long as I can."
,glynn5500,2011-06-21T12:43Z,nice one m8 ! an thnx !
,glynn5500,2011-06-21T19:23Z,0 seeds and 63 peers ! .... 9 hours an only 34% done ! fuksake !
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-21T20:44Z,"@ glynn5500

Calm down, I'm going as fast as I can. There was a period of disconnect because I had to take my laptop (which I'm seeding on) somewhere. Now if you have a 1mbs connection you would like to donate then by all means. Until then wait it out. I will not allow this torrent to die, but my bandwidth isn't the best so just be patient."
,XhameX,2011-06-21T21:32Z,"okay.. i will DL this torren for two reasons.
1. i love this game.

,joshr_chanfan,2011-06-22T08:22Z,"Thanks for the upload, man.  I love this series.  I played  the first game for the xbox and I currently have the second on the pc.  I haven't played either of the expansions, though.  So this is a great opportunity.  Thanks.  Will be seeding.  I'll let you know if i run into anything unusual."
,ShadowRift,2011-06-22T14:00Z,please seeeed guys 
,BaloKeatIIV,2011-06-22T16:05Z,"Hey Thanks sooo much for this man. I can't wait to play it, but right now I'm stuck at 56% and some people really need to seed cause for whatever reason the leaches are not working anymore, they brought me half way but now, its downloading at like .6 kb a sec and eta is over 2 years XDD SO PLEASE SEED. Thanks alot"

,joshr_chanfan,2011-06-22T18:12Z,"Yup, I'm also rockin the 56% right now.  There's a hell of a lot of peers, but ZERO seeds to speak of.  It's certainly going to be a while."
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-22T19:57Z,"@BaloKeatIIV & joshr_chanfan

Sorry my VPN disconnected me over night. Back up now. "
,glynn5500,2011-06-22T21:00Z,drpepperman39 .....i dont know if uve noticed m8 but there still ay no seeda ! and its still on the 56% mark ! thought id let ya know .
,BaloKeatIIV,2011-06-23T01:27Z,"@drpepperman39 No problem. Thanks a lot mate, its back to downloading again at a decent speed so thanks a lot. I'll comment when its finished. :)"
,BaloKeatIIV,2011-06-23T04:20Z,"...Having problems again... basically when I started to download it again, it was at a decent speed of around 300 kb a sec but then once I reached 64% it went back down to only 2.0 to 4.0kb/sec"
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-23T04:46Z,"@ people -

SHUT THE FUCK UP! Its almost a 6gb file, my upload capacity is 100kb/s. For your information I've already uploaded about 8gbs. Don't bitch if you don't seed it to each other or if you're restricting your upload capacity (as I'm sure some are). I know bandwidth isn't the fucking best, but BE PATIENT and you'll get it when you fucking get it. Jesus, I don't have a damn seedbox. But I will continue to seed this forever OKAY?!?!"
,BaloKeatIIV,2011-06-23T05:06Z,"@drpepperman39 I'm sorry man, I didn't mean to make it sound like I was talking bad about you or anything Believe me I'm extremely happy that I'm getting this and I'm NOT complaining at all, I'm just saying what's going on with the torrent. NO ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO COMPLAIN FOR GETTING SOMETHING THAT IS FREE!!!! So again I'm really sorry man, and thanks a lot for even uploading this bro. and again I'm sorry for seeming like an asshole if that;s what it seemed like."
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-06-23T05:43Z,"@BaloKeatIIV

Thats okay. There is nothing wrong with the torrent. The reason that you get slow speeds or periods of disconnect is because I have to take my laptop with me somewhere, and that location may have crap for speed and disconnect happens because I can't seed on the bus lol. "
,joshr_chanfan,2011-06-23T05:49Z,The speed is a bit better now.  I'm almost finished with it.  Thanks again for the upload.  I can't stop drooling.
,BaloKeatIIV,2011-06-23T06:07Z,"@drpepperman39 I understand man, I just wanted to let you know that I am in no way complaining at all. I've never uploaded anything to tpb, but I know that it can get pretty annoying with everyone complaining all the time and also trying to make people understand that you have no control over how fast your connection so yeah :) Thanks a lot for uploading it."
,HBK333777,2011-06-24T05:42Z,Im glad this torrent is here even tho theres only one seeder so far i really want to get the chance to play the first to FEAR games before getting the third and kudos to the person who cracked it :) i will also help seed most days 24/7 seeming as how i just leave it running anyways good luck guys on download and please help seed :)

,WhyBalder,2011-08-02T23:32Z,I am having a problem with this download. I have fully downloaded the torrent and since there is no manual that is reachable since i cant actually open the .iso file. Do you have to use a speciall mounting program or does deamon tools work okey? when i mount nothing happens 
,picouli,2011-08-04T19:21Z,"thanks so so soverry verry much budy great download work like dream you rock

thanksss 10000000million"
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-08-06T05:28Z,"@ WhyBalde

Daemon tools should be fine. I use Virtual Clone Drive because I prefer the simplicity of it. 

Alternatively, if you are having trouble mounting the disk then download winrar and extract it."
,ZombieSloth,2011-08-07T08:43Z,So I installed the game and when I clicked the fear platinum launcher it takes me straight to perseus mandate. How do I access extraction point and the main campaign? Do I have to beat perseus first?
,dgak23,2011-08-08T09:17Z,guys im trying to uninstall the game and im getting an error that says im missing unins000.dat any solutions?
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-08-16T09:59Z,"@ZombieSloth 
After installation you should have gotten 3 shortcuts to each of the games. If they are not there then check inside the program files. 

@dgak23

You could try reinstailling it again then uninstalling it. Or repairing it. But if you don't want to spend the time doing that then you could delete the game from your program dir and (if your picky) then manually remove its registry keys or use some type of reg cleaner."
,CHimYCh0nGa,2011-08-16T21:07Z,"i ll be seeding this 4ever.... These games runs perfect, great torrent.....
THNX A LOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,Skizzorz,2011-08-27T05:48Z,"^wtf? It only posted ""omg."" Lol, anyway as I was saying.. Thank you so much for this upload, bro. I've been dying to play F.E.A.R. one again for the longest time. I love this series. And the fact it comes with the 2 expansions? Amazing. Much love, dude. I'll let you know how they run after I finish d/l'ing @1mb/s "
,magnum2007,2011-09-01T10:09Z,is this 1.0.8 patched...?
,AlexxxG999,2011-09-03T18:45Z,I just made my first TPB account just to tell you how awesome this torrent is. Thank you very much.
,ImEmano,2011-09-12T16:37Z,I dont know why but i dont have sound effects... any ideas how to fix it?
,mrmanly,2011-10-02T05:51Z,"great torrent dude, Awesome job for uploading it thanks:)
so simple and easy! Just mount and install...BAM!!! your done."
,Chris_Yaz,2011-10-12T22:03Z,"I'm sorry but for some reason when i mount it to a virtual driver (whether it is MagicISO or Daemon Tools) it appears the autorun.exe for install but it
just lags without going further with the isntallation.

Any help drepepperman39 ?"
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-10-23T23:39Z,"If you have trouble running the installer, 

actually open up the disc, not just autorun and use the installer there, 

try running the installer as admin,

try turning off UAC then installing, 

or try using winrar to extract the .iso and then installing it. "
,skulldragon,2011-11-19T09:01Z,"All games started fine on WinXP Pro SP3 x86, Intel Core i7-2600K, 4GB DDR3 Apacer, P67A-GD65 (B3) (MS-7681), 2GB AMD HD 6950 DVI..
No SN or crack needed.

But I only played the first game a bit, until I realized, that this game badly wants to be Doom 3 alike - bad flashlight, tries to scare the player, repetitive levels, constant confusion about where to go and what to do. And also, it has repetitive enemies like Half-Life 2 has.
But unlike F.E.A.R., Doom 3 actually does a good job at scaring the shit out of players.

No wonder, why nobody ""shares"" F.E.A.R., it's just not worth it and is absolutely overrated.

F.E.A.R. has been disqualified."
[T],FatFreddy39,2011-11-28T02:38Z,"@People with problems, don't expect me to bother to help you if you can't even bother to list your system specs and maybe some of the issues you are encountering along with what program you are using to mount. 

@Skulldragon

Glad the game worked for you, although you don't have to act like a douche as that comment about sharing seems to make you out as. 

+1 for having a 6950 like me by the way ;) "
,Sunkan89,2011-11-29T01:05Z,Damn im having 24 seeders and downloading at 30 kbs feels like this gonna take forever. Any way thx for the upload this game is hard to get hope it works when im done xD
,Sunkan89,2011-12-01T00:36Z,Works perfect thanks again =)
,Pezomi,2011-12-08T02:13Z,"Scary as hell.

Everything went smoothly, running on a 64-bit windows based laptop fine. 

Thanks for the great, and safe upload."
,tocoprofago,2011-12-09T16:58Z,please seed!!! 30 seeds but my download is 40~50 KBs.... seed more please!!!
,tocoprofago,2011-12-09T17:03Z,Is this game fun??
,blha303,2011-12-12T13:41Z,"Thanks for the download, I'll seed.
FYI, the checkpoint freezing drpepperman39 mentioned is caused by the game restarting the video engine. It's an option in the settings. I'll get more information after I actually install the game and have a look.
The cracking is probably just the no-cd patch you can get at gamecopyworld.
Thank you for a great torrent, it took a while to download but I hope it will be worth it. I have these games on CD but the discs are very scratched. $90 from my local games shop. This was the only FEAR download I could find. Great game, great uploader."
,stargate22,2012-01-07T09:23Z,Thank so much havent played this game in forever and loved it when it came out. lost the game now but ill keep this on my hdd so i always have it. plan on making some maps with this game i download the fear public tools first. :)
,SerSpec-V,2012-01-23T07:08Z,Game is working fine on 7 Ultimate 32bit SP1. Although after 1.5hrs of playing it did freeze while saving a check point. 
,VDmaf,2012-05-03T18:13Z,What a great torrent..and please guys seed. 
,yogdagon,2012-05-27T12:30Z,"thanx, at least the first (which I installed and play) works fine (crashes sometimes, but might not be the game to blame)."
,yogdagon,2012-05-27T12:35Z,"A, (I forgot) a very good game. I prefer this kind than left4dead i.g., because in the latter there' s too many enemies coming at you simultaneously. Personal opinion, anyway."
