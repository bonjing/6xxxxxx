,HippieMagic,2011-06-20T20:42Z,"Thanks eztv.  Yes this is the last show of the season.  I think it covered the entire first book but it makes me wonder if the next season will still be ""Game of Thrones"" or if they will title it ""Clash of Kings""."

""You fucking motherfuckers always download and never seed. Fuck you all. If you enjoy watching the show, make it enjoyable for others, seed so others can download and watch, fucking pricks. FUCK YOU""

This show's episodes by eztv always have a LOT of seeders - right now it's 11,223 seeders against 8,199 leechers, and it's going to increase seeders and decrease leechers even more on the next hours! So quit complaining like a whining and jumpy child, you moron, and learn to wait a little bit!"
,WayneMatt,2011-06-21T08:53Z,"main reason why this is #1, ITS BECAUSE SOMEONE DIED AT EPISODE 9!!"
,ellemarra,2011-06-21T13:50Z,"omfg, what the hell to do know without game of thrones?!
cheers eztv"
,GarudaBKK,2011-06-21T14:31Z,"@all who are sad it's over, just read the books. They are much better than the tv series. And yes, I love the tv series too. I dun even read that much anymore nowadays but trust me, the books are epic.

Besides, come next month there is a total of 5 books to read, finally after years of waiting we can read on, I barely remember book 4 after all those years lol. Cheers, TG"
,dude0014,2011-06-21T22:14Z,"There's gazillion other books to read. Why on earth someone would want to read books which already have an amazing TV show and spoil it for themselves is beyond me.

And yes, I read the Harry Potter series, but that's cause the movies suck"
