So my point is that, most of your uploads have been done by some other uploaders earlier.
If you upload other movies which are not given proper consideration by them, then it will be a great help to all of us.
It's just a request."
,Illidan91,2011-06-21T18:57Z,@above...okk...first of all..u've mentioned at least two names for all movies...and its highly unlikely that all of them encoded d respective movie at the same time.....d point im trying to make here is that its not necessary that every movie have just one version out there.....and also some torrents do die in time.....so its always good to have a new copy of d old movie......n btw sorry for wasting ur time......
,Illidan91,2011-06-21T19:39Z,PS: dont worry...im working on some movies which are not out in small size...(i think).....
,Venadan,2011-06-22T04:16Z,"I didn't mean to offend you.
In case of small rps guys will always remember YIFY,
KICKASSTORRENTS, STYLISHSALH & RIDDLERA.
They have established their presence by uploading different movies
People will remember you if you are working on torrents that are not uploaded in small size by others."
,lwilli2009,2011-07-22T23:12Z,"Not really sure how this works... I mean if you'll be notified of a comment or what, but here goes... I like your rips, unlike others your rips ARE TOP QUALITY and actually look like bluray rips... I only have one small complaint/request... not that your not doing an excellent job already but, the AAC codec... is it small than mp3...? how much bigger would your files be if you made it with mp3 112 constant bitrate instead of AAC 32-28,64 etc...? mp3 112 cbr sounds all the better and your rips would be perfect... the AAC may be smaller but when you turn up the volume it gets distorted very bad...
