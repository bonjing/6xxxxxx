                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The story of Jose and Julie Carles from Bedfordshire, who are the parents of  
 Ellie, Georgie, Jessica and Holly - the UK's only identical quadruplets. The  
 programme follows them in the run-up to the girls' fifth birthday, sharing    
 some of the milestones of their lives including Christmas and their first day 
 at school. A trip to America to meet a set of teenage identical quads also    
 gives Julie an insight into what the future holds. Narrated by Keeley Hawes. 
 
                                 Enjoy!
