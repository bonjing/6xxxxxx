Mind map is simply a visualization tool which helps you think and learn more proficiently. A mind map is a graphic diagram used to represent your thoughts and ideas, tasks, or other items linked to a central key idea or theme. It is used to generate, visualize, structure and classify ideas. Mind maps are used as an aid in study, organization, problem solving, and decision making. Mind Mapping is the most effective, "brain-friendly" way for you to turn your unorganized, linear, fleeting ideas and thoughts into a structured, visual "map". Mind Map represents the best of both worlds by resembling the visual aspects of a flow chart and the organizational structure of an outline.
Mind map is an image-centered diagram that represents semantic or other connections between portions of information. By presenting these connections in a radial, non-linear graphical manner, it encourages a brainstorming approach to any given organizational task, eliminating the hurdle of initially establishing an intrinsically appropriate or relevant conceptual framework to work within.

Most often the map involves images, words, and lines. The elements are arranged intuitively according to the importance of the concepts and they are organized into groupings, branches, or areas. The uniform graphic formulation of the semantic structure of information on the method of gathering knowledge may aid recall of existing memories.

Flow Chart : Flow represents logical direction of your thoughts. Some thoughts require radially outward flow, while some thoughts require linear flow. Mind Map allows you to take the best of these flows and represent your thoughts that work best for you.

Outline : Outline represents hierarchies and relationships. These hierarchies, in turn, represent relationship between parent and child layers. A concept or an idea can be subdivided into smaller sub-concepts and sub-ideas. The main idea of the Mind Map becomes the top or central level subject
