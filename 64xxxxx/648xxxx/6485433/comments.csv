[T],Boo_trance,2011-06-23T21:07Z,"cheers MichielMaf,  yeah sure it's possible, let me sort it ,and once it's done i will upload it for you ok "
,Mika850,2011-06-24T06:00Z,"Hey Boo! First I wanna thank you for your uploads. I love 'em all!
I just wanted to ask you if you didn't recognize that this is the third upload that's broken at the end?
Electro House Session Vol 24:
20-Benzin Im Blut (Alex M.Remix)_Dj Gollum feat.Akustikrausch.mp3 is stuck at 98.3%. The JPG doesn't load at all.
Same with
Summer Dancemix 25, Track 22 and JPG, and
Chillout Session 2, Track 29 and JPG.
Both have parts of some other track at the end.
Most downloaders don't recognize that and keep waiting to get the last bytes. I don't think this is your intention. Please beware those errors in the future if possible. Thanks."
[T],Boo_trance,2011-06-24T13:33Z,"ty mike, i cant see why that's happening to anything youve put.just checked all files straight from the torrent app, they all play towards the end it sounds different towards the end as thats because the way its come through the mix.the jpg's open up with no problem through windows photo gallery ."
,Mika850,2011-06-24T16:38Z,"Yeah, but as you can see, Electro House Session Vol 24 has appr. 2 Seeds/231 Peers. Summer Dancemix 25: 1 Seed/59 Peers, Chillout Session 2: 0 Seeds/61 Peers.
So the problem does not only exist on my side, but also for EVERYONE. If I were the uploader, I would check all files (Ok, you did) and start the upload a second time. You may do whatever you want, off course."
[T],Boo_trance,2011-06-24T19:24Z,"as you can see,electro house 24 : 2 seeds & 9/213 peers: dancemix 25 : 1 seed & 3/65 peers:  chillout 2: 1 seed & 2/63 peers: you say EVERYONE? theres only you going on about it,so untill others get back to me ,just goes over one's head.yes i do check my files on a regular basis .and i will only upload the 2nd time,when they request split files on some of the torrents.ty i will keep that in mind being able to do what i want ."
