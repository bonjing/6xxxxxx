The Dhammapada (translated by Max Muller) is a versified Buddhist scripture traditionally ascribed to the Buddha himself. It is one of the best-known texts from the Theravada (Way of the Elders) tradition of Buddhism.

Manual of Zen Buddhism is by D. T. Suzuki (1870 â€“ 1966). He was a Japanese author of books and essays on Buddhism, Zen and Shin that were instrumental in spreading interest in both Zen and Far Eastern philosophy in general to the West. Suzuki was also a prolific translator of Chinese, Japanese, and Sanskrit literature.

These two texts make a good combination. The Dhammapada is one of the oldest Buddhist texts in the oldest Buddhist tradition. Suzuki's manual is a modern text, introducing Zen.

There are many Buddhsist texts available online for free download, but they are mostly in PDF format. I hope we can get more Buddhist texts in MOBI or Kindle format.
