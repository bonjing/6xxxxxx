::Plot::
 In the 27th century (2676 A.D.), the transport ship Hunter-Gratzner, its crew and passengers in cryo-stasis chambers, passes through a comet's tail while on autopilot; debris from the comet ruptures the hull and kills some of its crew, including the captain. The remaining crew is awakened and docking pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) crash lands on the nearby moon, Hades, also called M6-117, despite nearly dumping the passenger compartment; although many survive, the ship is a total loss. The survivors find the planet to be a dry, dead desert, its orbit around three suns keeping the surface in perpetual daylight. The survivors learn that one of the passengers is a dangerous criminal, Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), who escaped in the crash. Riddick is chased by a bounty hunter, William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), before he gets away. Meanwhile, one of the other survivors is killed while investigating a nearby cave. Johns returns with Riddick, who is accused of the survivor's murder and restrained with chains.
