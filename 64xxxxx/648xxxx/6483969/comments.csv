,H3roChr1s,2011-06-21T14:15Z,Upload F.3.A.R. pls
,asole,2011-06-21T14:30Z,Don't expect crack only because crack is 2 GB.
,xplor3r,2011-06-21T15:37Z,"i don't quite get it ... why all this ... i've finished the game with this version ... the size is 3,7 GB it's on private trackers ... or just google for it and download from mirrors

Alice.Madness.Returns-BlackBox


- the back box version had no errors , i've made a clean install ..also the setup includes also the crack , just install and play ... and also the black box version is made of :

SKIDROW installation files + THETA crack


-- finished the game in 3 days without any errors, it has 6 chapters 

_______

also just to let u all know ...download the SKIDROW version , and install the game and apply the THETA crack to play , in case youy can't download     Alice.Madness.Returns-BlackBox


.... so in this case reloaded wasn't needed ..also remember to install as a clean install , all other saved must be deleted , also the game registries ... best of luck !"
,xplor3r,2011-06-21T15:50Z,"and for thos of u who want a better and working version without any problems for Red Faction - Armageddon ... just google this

Red.Faction.Armageddon.FULL.Cracked-Black.Box

- it has 1,92 gb and it's the full rip of the game , is also multi 8 and only the video were re- coded to 50% ... other than that nothing deleted ... i'm still playing the game , not finished it yet .. but no problems encountered so far ... so in fact Black Box is quite a better group of  game repackers , never had any problems with any of their release ... well bye"
,aguyfromthewest,2011-06-22T08:02Z,"So I've installed the game and found the ""Crack"" folder in the image file, but I'm still confused about what to do afterwards. The readme in the folder states I need to run and unpack the ""7-Zip archive Game.7z"" into my installation directory. So I hafta use the 7-Zip File Manager to unpack the 4 ""Game.7z.001-004"" files? And if so, to which folder in the installation directory? The ""Win32""? The ""Core""? "
[T],dramacore,2011-06-22T10:01Z,thanks
,Feesty,2011-06-22T11:13Z,"@aguyfromthewest, use 7z to open archive (open only the first 7z file) and you will see a folder called game, find the folder called game in the in the directory where you installed alice, and then  extract that folder to the same place as the installed game folder, this will merge will the 2 folders completeing the game, then just copy over the crack and play the game, it works perfect I have been playing without any problems. It took me 2 attempts to figure it out its like the install; installs the framework of the game and the 7z file fills in the missing pieces of game. you can also use your old saves if you had the previous buggy version. hope that helped"
,aguyfromthewest,2011-06-22T22:45Z,"@Feesty 
Thanks for the clearing up of that instructions that helped alot. Now I got my own sets of problems, a couple of files that are supposed to be extracted from the Game.7z file are not successfully being extracted by 7-Zip. These files are in the ""...Crack\Game.7z.001\Game\Alice1\bin\"" directory. The 7-Zip just states that these files weren't successfully outputted or something. And since I can't access them any other way besides 7-Zip, the game crashes when I start a new game. How do I get these files out of the Game.7z crack and into the installation directory? I'm currently downloading the torrent again so see if a new download would fix it. These files include: 

bin\base\bind_pc.scr
bin\base\keybind_pc_deu.scr
bin\base\keybind_pc_esn.scr
bin\base\keybind_pc_fra.scr
bin\alice.exe
bin\cgame.dll
bin\cgamex86.dll
bin\fgame.dll
bin\fgamex86.dll
bin\SndDrivers\mss32.dll

Help anyone?"
,Feesty,2011-06-23T00:30Z,@aguyfromthewest Hmmm worked ok for me but maybe I was wrong maybe you need to highlight all the 7z files and extract to the game foler where alice is??

,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-06-24T16:59Z,"Thanks for the upload, the game works flawless. 

Once you've installed the game, make sure to highlight all the 7z files(no other files that doesn't include the 7z.)

When you've selected those files, exract them to your installation folder. 

Now, copy the crack and apply them. If it happens that you're on Vista or Windows 7, run it as Admin.

I've had no issues so far, I installed the razor version removed it and my savings were still there. 

Once again thanks, this game gets a huge plus for the graphic design. Oh the campaign is around 13~ hours depending on the way you play it"
,pixie__,2011-06-24T20:13Z,"Has anyone else got stuck having to get an EA account? I can't figure it out, and it won't let me launch the game because I don't have a key. Help please?"
,Alice_Cake_GAMMA,2011-06-24T20:37Z,"@aguyfromthewest: I'm having the same problems. I can't even get the game to open, however. Even if I try to open it as an administrator, I get the error message ""Failed to find default engine .ini file to retrieve My Documents subdirectory to use. Force quitting.""

I have absolutely no idea what that means, and I've been using torrented games for years, so I'm not new at this. I've never had so much trouble trying to get a game to work, and I've tried this and SKIDROW's original release with both his and the THETA crack. Both of those led to nothing happening when I clicked on the application to open the game.

I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium on a desktop more than capable of running this game. If anyone has any solution to this, I would greatly appreciate it. "
,aguyfromthewest,2011-06-25T04:07Z,Hey everyone I extracted all the Game.7z files and it works that way. Just to let everyone I'm a healthy ways in and the game works. Framerate issues during intense combat but hopefully a update can fix that eventually.

,alleexo,2011-06-26T10:00Z,i wasn't installing it correctly when that happened though. trying again.
,Rain-Boy,2011-06-26T12:25Z,"Just tried it and the game worked just fine.
Just follow the instructions:

- Mount the image

- Install

- Go to the crack folder open the first 7z file and extract it directly to ""Alice Madness Returns The Complete Collection"" (this will add all the files missing from the installation)

* Note: I tried to extract the 7z files to another place (ex: desktop) and then copy + paste the folder to its respective place; it didn't work this way so it's better to extract them directly to the ""Alice Madness Returns The Complete Collection"" folder.
For me, this took care of the APPCRASH problem I was getting everytime I tried to run the game

- Copy the AliceReturns.exe and the rld.dll to the Win32 folder.

- Play!"

,jkushka,2011-06-26T18:12Z,"Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the answer to the ""GAME DOES NOT OPEN"" problem.

Provided of course that you were capable of installing it correctly to begin with. The following should resolve it.

If you are running Windows 7 SP1 you have the new,
MICROSOFT SECURITY ESSENTIALS (MSE)
installed and running by default.

TO RUN THE GAME YOU MUST:

-Open microsoft security essentials in your task tray
-DISABLE real time protection
-Profit 

-Naturally you should also apply this to any and all anti-virus/malware software you may be running.

You're welcome.

Because of the way this game was cracked the MSE will detect the RDL.DLL as a malicious file and  "
,alleexo,2011-06-27T07:22Z,"yeah, so, i've been trying everything. AVG and MSE both read the .dll file as having the win32/heur virus. even if i turn off my antivirus programs my computer won't let me move the .dll file. i've changed the ownership of all the folders to me, but the problem seems to be with the moving the file from the mounted image in the first place. so i'm not sure what to do about that.

BUT!! I have the soultion, copy them when you are in safe mode.
For Those of you who do not know how to go into safe mode:
-press start
-select the restart computer option
-while the pc is booting hold the F8 key
-now you'll get a black screen with a blue square in it with some options, press esc
-immediately after you press esc, hold F8 again. Now you'll have the option to start windows in safe mode.

,mrskye08,2011-07-13T08:37Z,"hi for those experiencing ""Failed to find default engine .ini file to retrieve My Documents subdirectory to use. Force quitting"" it's because 7-zip was either: 1. not installed properly or 2. the zip files were not unzipped properly. i will show step by step how i installed the game. this is what i've done:

1. mount iso image using daemon (or others)

2. click install and follow instructions of install.

3. use keygen if asked for serial number or use the serials given by uploader. i tried both in my laptop and pc, both works.

4. after installation, go to crack then install 7-zip (click on the .exe file [it's the first 7-zip file], then extract to c:\program files)

*note: the 7-zip program must be present on start menu, programs already, if not, it's not installed properly

5. open 7-zip, right click (windows7) on 7-zip and choose run as administrator. 

* this is very important because if you did not open as admin, it will not extract the files and will show errors during extraction. i don't know how to open as admin in XP, but when i tried to install the game in my XP pc, i didn't have any problems with it, it just extracted fluidly.

6. after opening 7-zip as admin, browse for crack folder again and select ALL the 4-part files. note: ALL 4-part files

7. click extract and choose c:\program files (x86)\ea games\alice madness returns or something like that.

* to know if it's extracted properly: try to see the size of the game. if the game size if big like 8gb it's cool. if just around 67mb, it's not extracted.

8. go back to crack folder and copy the .dll and alice.exe files to system32 of alice game (as instructed from the readme instructions)

9. before playing, turn off real time protection of microsoft security essentials and other antivirus/malware because it will see the .dll file as virus.

10. enjoy the game. :) i didn't have any problems while playing the game. no crashes or watsoever."

I'm a little forgiving here because of the silly 7z thing here where you have to run the 7z program as Admin first by itself (as explained in comments on page 1 here) but if done right this game works 100% fine from this torrent.  I got it and am almost to the last Chapter already so it *does* work."
