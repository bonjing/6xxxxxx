,Sivos,2011-07-01T23:02Z,"It's really stupid that you uploaded this long before the last part could come out, IE the most important content of June (the magic stuff).  Maybe the smart thing to do is to wait for the month to finish before posting these things."
,Bloodwynn,2011-07-02T07:53Z,"Wow... Harsh. The ""magic"" was a suprise dl at the end of the month."
,Favorlock,2011-07-03T16:26Z,"Yes, I'm sorry we couldn't upload the ""Magic"" dlc for you, but you have to realize I do this voluntarily and when I can. In the future I will try to be a little more thorough. However, I will be providing monthly additions to Games4TheWorld for this upload. Thank you for understanding."
,pika1979,2011-07-04T03:34Z,"thank you so much for the torrent! this will come in handy for newer content but i have a small problem. i need two of the older sets that they no longer sell in the official store and missed getting. i know its in this pack but i do not need the other sets and i really don't want to have to uninstall the stuff that i paid for just to install all of the packages. is there any way that you can can get me the ""Full Bayside Set"" and the ""Full Storybook Set""? without all the other sets from that month? I know it may take a while and I am in no hurry. thank you!"
,j_all4242,2011-07-04T06:27Z,"Great upload! keep it up!
I would do this but i dont know enough about it and dont have the time to learn...
thanks to all those who do this and Games4theworld truley is elite!"
[T],Games4theworld,2011-07-05T13:38Z,"Hello,

@TyTy29

Is your The Sims 3 working on its own? If not, you need to crack The Sims 3 itself first, before installing these packs.

@VAGTG

Shouldn't cause any problems, since these are the original package files, nothing cracked or something.

@-ringo-

Did you read the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" ? It described everything.
You might want to watch the installation video I created on Youtube. Search Youtube for: The Sims 3 Store updates June 2011 installation video

@Sivos

Maybe it's a smart thing to just buy the game and packages instead of even taking the effort to comment here?

@pika1979

You should see if Favorlock has them for you, I don't have a The Sims 3 account, so I can't download stuff myself.

@Everyone else

Thanks for all the support! You are the force that keeps us running, so thanks for taking the time to comment! ;-)

,XFMX,2011-07-07T11:08Z,I have a question. I bought the complete sims 3 pack on steam officially. But I don't believe in paying for this stuff. Will I have problems installing these packages to the sims 3 on steam? Do I need to place them in a particular directory? Thanks for the upload. :]
[T],Games4theworld,2011-07-14T00:47Z,"Hello,

@deejis
No, it doesn't.

@XFMX
No, not at all. The steps will be the same for you. Have fun!

Ps. Note that the Riverview that comes with this torrent doesn't work, since it's out-dated. In order to get a working one, please read this: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t1224-how-to-download-riverview-for-the-sims-3-fix#7547

,lolgeorgie513,2011-07-22T16:48Z,"Hey, for some reason the packages arn't working.. All the steps were working perfectly, but when I tried to click on the 'June 2011' package, it said that the file wasn't recognized and I had to choose what to open it with. I tried to choose to open it with sims 3 launcher but that also doesn't work, it just opens up the launcher, no download.. I have a legit copy of Sims 3 by the way. I have to use a disk. "
,Tarson,2011-08-01T03:15Z,"@Games4TheWorld:  This is incredible work you have done here.  Clean and straight forward and entirely free.  You sir, have allowed many a person to play a fun game without having to deal with the viru--er, I mean ""security"" programs EA likes to put in their games.

Not quite as much as you have done, but once I get my internet up and running to its full potential tomorrow, I will be seeding at 20mbps for the rest of the week."
,Colonel213,2011-08-07T11:39Z,hi games4theworld i really like all of your torrents they all seem great. i just wanted to know what is seeding and how does it help you?
,pamellka,2011-08-19T15:22Z,Oh um...So this doesn't have the magic library set? ): Still thanks for the amazing job!

I tried both laying them in the download folder, and laying them in sims 3/mod/package
and creating the cfg file.

But none of that works... just the same old stuff i get from all the other expansions..."
