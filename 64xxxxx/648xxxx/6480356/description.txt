The license for using the material will be the same as for Bergensbanen, Creative Commons BY-SA, which means:

You are free to...

to Remix  - to adapt the work

You can edit the work, color correct it, put on graphics, play backwards, anything, as long as you follow the terms in the license.

Under the following conditions...

Attribution - You must attribute the work in the manner specified by the author or licensor (but not in any way that suggests that they endorse you or your use of the work).

All your derivative works must be marked with the URL to http://nrkbeta.no/hurtigruten. If you make something for the web, the link should be clickable. Videos should have both a clickable link in the text description and this text superimposed at the end:

"Hurtigruten" - NRK http://nrkbeta.no/hurtigruten

Failing to do this, is a breach of terms.

Share Alike - If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may distribute the resulting work only under the same, similar or a compatible license.

Everything you make from our work, must have the same Creative Commons license. Which rules out using other people's work (unless they also are Creative Commons or similiar), because you have to share your work with the same license.

Commercial use

The work is also licensed for commercial use. But again, you have to make your work available with the same Creative Commons license.
