,4X-AXG,2011-07-02T23:58Z,any chance you can upload the uncompressed full DVD9? maybe even including DVD cover? :D
,MarcW10,2011-07-04T06:07Z,"Air Austral is already online at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5587875/Justplanes_-_Worldairroutes_-_Air_Austral Aegean and EMB-190 no sign so far...

And there's no chance whatsoever of the full uncompressed DVD. My upload speed sucks so hard it took me the best part of 2 days solid just to get this one online! "
