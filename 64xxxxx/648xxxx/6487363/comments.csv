Pentagon-Papers-Part-IV-C-5.pdf
Pentagon-Papers-Part-V-B-4-Book-I.pdf

None of them hashed identical as the set I have so they 
may have changed the files again.  I'll download them and 
if it's really a third set I'll seed it too."
,Bluetack.2,2011-06-23T15:33Z,"Whoops again!  I didn't notice that uTorent selected the 
wrong folder before I scanned.  I couldn't force it to scan 
the right one until I moved the other one out of the way.  "
,Bluetack.2,2011-06-23T15:33Z,"Not being able to see a folder if another has a similar 
name is definitely a bug. All the existing files checked out 
OK after I worked around that particularly annoying bug. "
,Bluetack.2,2011-06-23T15:34Z,"Files that appeared to be missing are in a subfolder 
of the main download, separated from the rest."
,Bluetack,2011-07-15T21:05Z,"Don't forget to seed for awhile after you're done downloading.

I'm the only seed right now, asc11 goes offline occasionally.

Ideally you could use ""Force Start"" to start the download
(if using uTorrent ) and then it would seed forever after.  ; )

AALLLL the way to Hell!  (Muahahaaaaaahhhh!)  XD"

chapter directly without downloading the index first:

Aside from filenames the files are exactly the same as these."
