On a trip around the world, every day feels like Saturday. A MAP FOR SATURDAY 
reveals a world of long-term, solo travel through the stories of trekkers on 
four continents. The documentary finds backpackers helping neglected Thai 
tsunami victims. It explains why Nepal's guesthouses are empty and Brazil's 
stoplights are ignored. But at its core, SATURDAY tracks the emotional arc of 
extreme long-term travelers; teenagers and senior citizens who wondered, "What 
would it be like to travel the world?" Then did it.
