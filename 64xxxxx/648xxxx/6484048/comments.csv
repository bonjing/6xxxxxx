,kalbloke,2011-09-09T09:20Z,"mkvGod Thanks yet again for the wonderful work and uploads.
A small suggestion, the title of your torrent  in google doesn't turn up till pretty deep. Maybe the 'US' should be later, like after season 1. In the search if you check on Bitsnoop you are grouped with 'Killing us' Just a thought, hope you don't mind.
Thanks again for the great work!!"
