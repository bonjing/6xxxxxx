,surprisee,2011-07-17T05:10Z,"Could someone tell me what i would need to do to convert this file so that i could copy it to a thumbdrive for play back on a PS3 please?

Tried using handbrake to do this but the ps3 keeps complaining the file is corrupt or invalid format.

Thanks"

,mh505,2011-11-01T16:58Z,"Maybe this is a stupid question - but could someone explain to me how it is possible that a file such as this one, with 2.9 GB, can have can have the same qualtity as one that uses up 10.1 GB?
Much obliged"
,mh505,2011-11-02T14:45Z,"I have now watched this version and must say I'm extremely impressed.  On my 24"" monitor at 1920x1080 I can see no difference whatever to outher 1080p movies that however are much larger in size.
What is the secret?  What SW deilvers this kind of quality and at what configuration?
Appreciate your thoughts"
