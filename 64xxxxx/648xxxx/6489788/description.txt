Mantronix was an influential 1980s hip hop and electro funk music group founded by DJ
Kurtis Mantronik (Kurtis el Khaleel), and rapper MC Tee (TourÃ© Embden). Mantronix
underwent several genre (and line / up) changes during its 7-year existence (1984 /1991),
from old school hip hop to electro funk to house music, but the group is primarily remembered
for its original, heavily synthesized blend of old school hip-hop and electro funk.

That's My Beat is a compilation album by hip hop/electo funk musician, Kurtis Mantronik and
features tracks selected by Mantronik and cited as influences to his work with his hip hop /
electro funk group Mantronix. The album was released on the Soul Jazz Records label in
2002.
