 CROSS-TRAIN YOUR BRAIN A Mental Fitness Program for Maximizing Creativity and Achieving Success When you change the way you think, you can change your life. That's the message and the goal of this dynamic mental workout created by creativity guru Stephen Eiffert. Cross-Train Your Brain shows readers how to break through the constraints of career pigeonholing, tedious routine, and rote learning to recapture the power of their true creative natures. Creativity is not just the realm of artists and inventors. Everyone is born with creativity, and everyone can learn to use it to sharpen their problem-solving skills, improve relationships, embrace change and challenge, and build positive attitudes. The book supplies tools, exercises, and techniques proven to boost mental effectiveness and creative thinking skills. Drawing on the fields of psychology, philosophy, and creativity, the book presents a practical action plan for achieving peak creativity-the first step in creating top-performing organizations. STEPHEN D. EIFFERT (Springfield, MO) is a nationally acclaimed speaker and consultant. In addition, he has developed and presented his innovative Creativity Retreat for companies such as Dial, Motorola, Time Warner, and Microsoft.
