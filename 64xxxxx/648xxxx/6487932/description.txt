Beyonce-4_(Deluxe_Edition)-2CD-2011-VOiCE


Description: 4 is the fourth solo studio album from BeyoncÃ©. The album was recorded over a year between the spring of 2010 and the spring of 2011, while BeyoncÃ© took time away from the spotlight. She engaged in what she describes as simple things, including listening to every kind of music she truly enjoys. The title signifies not only the artistâ€™s fourth solo offering and the day of her birth but it is also a personal gift to her fans who took to their social media pages urging her to name the album for her special number.
