	This is a book about God, metaphysics and human psychology.  This book was written by Dr. Hubert Benoit, who was a man with an extremely rare gift of intuition when it comes to identifying and understanding the nature of God and metaphysics, and that of the human psychological condition, and importantly, how they are intended to interact with one another.  

	The subject matter of this book has already been widely written about and discussed.  However, viewpoints vary wildly as we know, and it is rare to come across an individual who happens to possess a clear and penetrating understanding of the fundamental truths concerning the metaphysical realm.  Here, however, we have such a man in Hubert Benoit.  This is a bold statement, but a person who has had the opportunity to read Dr. Benoit's words will tell you the same thing.  Aldous Huxley himself speaks to this in a letter which he wrote to Dr. Benoit after reading his first book titled 'Metaphysics and Psychoanalysis' where he wrote: "A book like yours foreshadows, at last, for a true science of the psychology of man. Until now we have only had partial glimpses."

	Dr. Benoit was a practicing psychiatrist for over 35 years and also authored the book 'Zen and the Psychology of Transformation: The Supreme Doctrine', as well as other books about psychology and metaphysics.  This book was his final literary work.  Not only is he a man of keen metaphysical intuition, but he is a gifted and highly experienced psychologist as well.  I encourage you to take a look at this book for yourself, it is truly a diamond in the rough that the whole world should have the opportunity to see. 


The Author's introduction from the book:

	The essential subject of this book is our human condition, the possibility of our metaphysical transformation and the understanding of what leads to this transformation. 

	As soon as you begin reading, you will probably be very surprised at some of my views on the genesis of the cosmos, views inspired by Traditional Metaphysics. Mankind is part of the cosmos and shares its genesis. Therefore, the knowledge of this genesisâ€”as you will see later onâ€”projects on the functioning of the human being some extremely unexpected and paradoxical laws that are contrary to current opinion. 

	What is of utmost importance to usâ€”such as we areâ€”is that which concerns us personally, and in particular that which can deliver us from the painful slavery we undergo. 

	I hope that you will not be put off or let yourself be discouraged by the pure metaphysical abstraction that is found at the beginning of this book because this abstraction is necessary to the knowledge and understanding of our condition such as it truly is.
