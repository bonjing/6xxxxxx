,Xanthium1,2011-06-22T22:45Z,"Zen and the Psychology of Transformation by Hubert Benoit is available both on Demonoid and The Pirate Bay.

I recommend this book just as highly as The Interior Realization, which is more focused on the nature of God and metaphysics, whereas Zen and the Psychology of Transformation is more focused on the human psychological condition. However, both books are about all 3 of the mentioned topics as how they relate to each other. "
