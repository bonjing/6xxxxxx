The welcome changes in GCE Advanced level syllabuses during the last few years have prompted the writing of this new Inorganic Chemistry which is intended to replace the book by Wood and Holliday. This new book, like its predecessor, should also be of value in first-year tertiary level chemistry courses. The new syllabuses have made it possible to go much further in systematising and explaining the facts of inorganic chemistry, and in this book the first four chaptersâ€”- the periodic table; structure and bonding; energetics: and acids and bases with oxidation and reductionâ€”provide the necessary grounding for the later chapters on the main groups, the first transition series and the lanthanides and actinides. Although a similar overall treatment has been adopted in all these later chapters, each particular group or series has been treated distinctively, where appropriate, to emphasise special characteristics or trends.
