Do NOT upload porn torrents outside of the Porn categories.

A proper DVD image rip consists of a VIDEO_TS folder typically containing these files in addition to the files that are included in your torrent:

VIDEO_TS.BUP
VIDEO_TS.IFO
VIDEO_TS.VOB
VTS_01_0.BUP
VTS_01_0.IFO
VTS_01_0.VOB

Your torrent contain only the movie file segments.
It left out the index files and the DVD menu files."
