The Lotus SÅ«tra is one of the most popular and influential MahÄyÄna sÅ«tras.

This sutra teaches the concept of skillful means. mostly in the form of parables. It is also one of the first sutras to use the term MahÄyÄna, or "Great Vehicle", Buddhism. Another concept introduced by the Lotus Sutra is the idea that the Buddha is an eternal being, who achieved nirvana eons ago, but willingly chose to remain in the cycle of rebirth (samsara) to help teach beings the Dharma.

The Buddha reveals himself as the "father" of all beings and evinces the loving care of just such a father. Moreover, the sutra indicates that even after the Parinirvana (apparent physical death) of a Buddha, that Buddha continues to be real and to be capable of communicating with the world.

In terms of literary style, the Lotus Sutra illustrates a sense of timelessness and the inconceivable, often using large numbers and measurements of time and space. The number of Bodhisattvas mentioned in the "Earth Bodhisattva" chapter number in the billions, if not more.

The Lotus Sutra also often alludes to a special teaching that supersedes everything else that the Buddha has taught, but the Sutra never actually states what that teaching is. This is said to be in keeping with the general MahÄyÄna Buddhist view that the highest teaching cannot be expressed in words.

The ultimate teaching of the sutra, however, is implied to the reader that "full Buddhahood" is only arrived at by exposure to the truths expressed implicitly in the Lotus Sutra via its many parables and references to a heretofore less clearly imagined cosmological order.

In the vision set out in this sutra, moreover, not only are Buddhas innumerable, but the universe encompasses realms of gods, devas, dragons and other mythological beings, requiring numerous dimensions to contain them. Buddhas are portrayed as the patient teachers of all such beings.

This torrent includes the Lotus Sutra in English in MOBI / Kindle and PDF formats. There are many Buddhist texts available online (check my torrents for starters) mainly in PDF, but I am trying to provide more Buddhist texts in the Kindle format.
