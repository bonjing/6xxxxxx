Thanks."
,geek4real,2012-04-07T20:17Z,"@spruceman:  There are a few apps for Android actually.  Many are paid but the best are worth it.

A free one that I like is Binaural Beats.  It sounds really nice through my headphones, or even when plugging my Android into my PC speakers. (As a side note the developer is really nice too.)  It's here: http://www.appbrain.com/app/binaural-beats-therapy-beta/com.ihunda.android.binauralbeat

When you go to that link, the page also lists many other related apps and I have downloaded many of those.  Honestly, Binaural Beats is the only one I've spent time messing with.  It seems the most serious in its intentions (no fluff.)  It's worth going to the Android Market to see their related apps too.  Their search engine is better, but the website is often slow.

Here is a Website where you can stream White, Brown or Pink noise.  Works great on recent smartphones and computers alike.  Just use your wifi connection so you don't burn data usage.  http://simplynoise.com/

Last, I have noisy neighbors so I use a big box-fan when I sleep.  The older the better.  Mine is from the 1970's and has none of that ""quiet fan"" technology.  It's perfect!  Check out Good Will and Salvation Army stores for these."

I, of course, NEVER do this. :-P"
