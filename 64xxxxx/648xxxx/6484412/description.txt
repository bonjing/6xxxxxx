Delightfully Relaxing Entertainment for your Weary Ears and Soul

Great application for ADHD and Tinnitus sufferers, seeking temporary relief from busy 
minds and ringing in the ears while surfing the web or working on their computer.

Aire Freshener provides ambient sounds, a CD player, simulated wind chimes, and more...
It has many different soothing environments to choose from: Rain, Crickets, Forest 
Stream, Thunder Storm, Rohoboth Beach, Spring Day, Campfire, Waterfall, Wind Chimes,..

Take a brake and relax your mind playing some real ambient sounds.


Install: Extract & Play

The program runs as a icon in the System Tray area of the Windows taskbar.

The Volume option in the menu now works in Windows Vista/7 (I've modified the executable)
If you are running Windows XP or lower, run AFXP.exe (original executable)


Cheers,
