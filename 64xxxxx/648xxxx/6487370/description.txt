[KIS 9 / KAV 9 *KNOWN ISSUE*]
Kaspersky is blocked from deleting Exploit which causes an alert: \"no rights for 
replace clldr.dll\" etc... just ignore it.

[NOT WORKING FOR YOU?]
* Maybe you are using unsupported version of KIS/KAV 
* On Windows Vista/7: try turning off DEP and UAC

[FALSE POSITIVE]
* Kaspersky falsely identifies this exploit as \"Hacktool.Kiser\"
* This is because it\'s used for hacking Kaspersky
* Add to \"Exclusions\" list 
  (wait for Kaspersky alert, then add to \"Exclusions\")
  (Ensure you set Kaspersky to ask before making decisions)


Enjoy & Seed!
