You're bullshit if you don't now how to use these files, so think about it. :)"
[T],CheckOutEr,2011-07-08T11:11Z," NOTE: Extract packed setup files to your desktop, do not extract them to Kaspersky installation directory. After that you will see instructions for every patch. Also remember to disable your Kaspersky AV/IS first! I think that that is the reason why so many n00bs gave me so many minuses. :-P"

YOU SHOULD DISABLE YOUR KIS/KAV FIRST, BECAUSE OTHERWAYS IT WILL DELETE THESE PATCH FILES!"
