Freedom Scientific JAWS v12.0.1158 32 Bit (crack only, includes JAWS download link) (by Glitch)

Hello, this is Glitch,

There are two cracking  options included in this
package.  The first is a patch program that will
crack JAWS.  The second will crack JAWS and also
enable Tandem Direct.  From what I have seen in
the past, the patching program in Option 1 is new
in the world of JAWS cracking methods.  I do not
know for certain, but perhaps this patching
program can crack later builds of JAWS 12 as well.
Of course, I could easily run the test myself, but
what fun will that be for you fellow pirates.  So,
as a bonus level, test this theory out and see
what happens.  :) Smileyface.  Hmm...  Wonder if
this patch would also work on a 64 bit system.
Hidden level?  I don\'t know.  lol

After the torrent download is complete, unpack the
archive with 7-Zip File Manager.  To download the
free File manager, visit www.7-zip.org and grab
the latest version.

The installation and cracking instructions are
similar as in my previous releases.  Once again, I
am not the creator of the crack.  However, I hold
the packaging, batch file, and installation guide
to my name.  The installation guide is included in
the .7z archive file.

Enjoy.

Signed,
Glitch

JAWS (an acronym for Job Access With Speech) is a
screen reader, a software program for visually
impaired users, produced by the Blind and Low
Vision Group at Freedom Scientific of St.
Petersburg, Florida, USA.

Its purpose is to make personal computers using
Microsoft Windows accessible to blind and visually
impaired users. It accomplishes this by providing
the user with access to the information displayed
on the screen via text-to-speech or by means of a
Braille display and allows for comprehensive
keyboard interaction with the computer.
