STOSSEL - [The Trouble with Lawyers 3] - Fox Business Network
2011, June 16, Thursday

Xvid/MP3 AVI - encoded from medium quality ReplayTV stream

----------

The third STOSSEL show to talk about the consequences and collateral effects of the tort system in America. A second contest for the most ridiculous warning label is decided.

[This show appears related but separate from this weekend's FNC Stossel special on lawyers. I'll try to catch that for ya if I can.]
