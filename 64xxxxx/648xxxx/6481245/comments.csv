Confusing me was Stossel's blog on FBN, where he plugged the FNC airing and seemed to write to suggest his program would be looking at this issue from a criminal law perspective. On air, the show was about civil law. (!?)"

On 20110731, the servers providing the ReplayTV Electronic Program Guide data will be shut down forever, stranding me without a schedule. Alternative sources for guide data are being explored by the owner community, but there are some doubts as to the ultimate usability of the units after this date. _IF_ it becomes impossible to schedule unattended recordings with my unit, then the flow of torrents describing this show and others will stop after this date."
