Yabba dabba doo! That modern stone-age family is back and on the big screen in 
this live-action version of the beloved cartoon series. When Fred Flintstone 
(John Goodman) generously loans his pal Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) enough 
money to adopt a child, Barney wants to return the favor. So he helps Fred 
on his IQ test at the quarry... which gets Fred an executive position. 
But what Fred doesn't know is he's the sap meant to take the fall for a bunch 
of corporate con-men out to rook the company.
