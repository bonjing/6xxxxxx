Can't thank you enough for uploading this! :-)

Everything Final Cut wise works fine so far, no problems, simple to install and crack (as with every software from Apple)

But one issue, my Mac App Store now won't let me update or download apps with my account as everytime I try to do so, it tells me to

""Sign in to asdfff2011@mail.ru to update applications for that account.""

Could anyone help me get rid of this and get my App Store and Apple ID account back to normal please?? :/

Thanks in advance, Elliot"
,pwndog,2011-06-23T11:29Z,In my updates I have the updates available for ProKit and Pro Applications Update 2010-02 if I install these will this fix the problem.. or will it make final cut uncrackable?
,Rifive,2011-06-23T12:10Z,"THIS DOES WORK! You just have to update ""Proapps quicktime codecs"" and ""Prokit update"" if you haven't already. There is also an update for Final Cut Pro X that has some more audio stuff but I haven't tested that out yet. If you don't know how to update just go to the apple icon on your computer in the far upper left in the bar and click 'software update' then install the updates mentioned before. I was struggling for hours on how to get this working but then as soon as I tried this it worked instantly."

it's working now
 not sure what fixed but here's what I did:

 1) copy fcpx to desktop, open it and replace the receipt file, then close and move it to applications folder
 2) used cleanmymac to clear all caches and temp files
 3) used disk utility do repair permissions
4) ran software update and installed all updates

,hmoaj111,2011-06-24T00:23Z,@ torrent noob. what you have to do is if it doesnt work or open. you want to re download it. once done dont open it. head over to the appstore and download twitter. once done go to it in the finder right click and show package contents. then take the folder that says MAS recipts or something familiar to that. then go to FINAL CUT PRO X and right click it then show package contents. then paste it in there. it will tell you to replace so accpet. once done restart your mac and you shld be able to fully use FCPX.      Worked for me!!

,lyri8,2011-06-25T19:30Z,do you already have another version  of final cut installed in your application folder  if you do just make a new folder and just name it any  thing like final cut pro 5 6 7 exsetra be because they didn't name the icon final cut pro x its just final cut pro like the old version so it thinks is the same version put i sill cant install out side plugins because you don't actually  install it its just drag and drop i am waiting for a version that you install with a dmg mount file with a keygen os serial because i need to install out side plugins so this is just a toy rite now 
,JohnnyLingo,2011-06-25T21:32Z,I don't have another version. It's something with 10.6.8 because I can't upgrade my copy of Firefox either. Deleted Firefox 4 and problem persists.
