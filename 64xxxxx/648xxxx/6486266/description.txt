Publisher: Focal Press; 1st edition (October 15, 2001) | ISBN: 0240516567 | Pages: 395 | PDF | 8.83 MB

A complete professional 'bible' on all aspects of audio and video compression using MPEG technology. The MPEG Handbook is both a theoretical and practical treatment of the subject. Fundamental knowledge is provided alongside practical guidance eg how to avoid quality loss or the creation of MPEG elementary streams and their multiplexing into transport streams (including the problems involved in synchronizing all of the signals in a multiplex). The clarity of explanation and depth of technical detail combine to make this book an essential and definitive reference work. Gives a comprehensive treatment of significant extensions made available by MPEG4, such as object coding, mesh coding and animation.

Previously titled MPEG2, the book has now been extensively revised to cover the all the latest standards, including a description of the MPEG4 standard and the latest applications of the technology, such as the delivery of compressed audio, video, graphics and interactive capability over the internet and broadband networks. It gives a comprehensive treatment of significant extensions made available by MPEG4, such as object coding, mesh coding and animation.
