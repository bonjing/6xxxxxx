,wowme,2011-06-23T14:00Z,"@homardfrench

What do you mean fixed difficulty, like it had a problem and it's fixed or it's easy/normal/hard and can't change.

Also this torrent is faster than the other two even though it's the least popular, smart people check seeder/leecher ratio and not absolute numbers. Also a test of everyone wouldn't hurt. "
,Mamoon69,2011-06-27T09:25Z,"Why do u upload this RAR that has lots of RAR files in it? Can't you unrar it and make it a single ISO file before uploading it? It is not professional and makes things hard though. 

I'm going for EXTREMEZONE instead. It is the same release but without this retarded RAR thing."
