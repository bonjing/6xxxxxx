Release Notes:

The Bay Area's busiest pop punk heroes, Set Your Goals    
release their highly anticipated album, Burning At Both   
Ends on Epitaph Records. Produced by Brian McTernan, the  
album features thirteen powerful tracks. Back in full     
force, Set Your Goals will keep the momentum going with    
the follow-up to their infectious and dynamic album, This 
Will Be The Death of Us. Duel vocalists Matt Wilson and   
Jordan Brown's flawless delivery on the opening track     
"Cure For Apathy" captures the SYG sound and energy we    
know so well as they trade off singing duties. "Certain," 
a soon to be fan favorite, highlights Joe Saucedo's solid 
bass lines with passionate lyrics and engaging guitar     
solos. Keeping it real for die hard fans, Burning At Both 
Ends has a definitive Set Your Goals sound with their     
energetic, head-bobbing riffs and gang vocals while       
staying completely fresh with sing-along choruses and     
lyrics everyone can relate to. The album delivers with the
fast and hard-hitting track, "Trenches" that showcases Dan
Coddaire and Audelio Flores' catchy melodies and guitar   
riffs. "Exit Summer," brings back 90's hardcore with a    
melodic twist, an irresistible combination. SYG finishes  
the album with "Not As Bad" where Mike Ambrose            
demonstrates his tightknit drumming with crazy fills on   
top of pleasant harmonies - a great way to close out the  
album.
