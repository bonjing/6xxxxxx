 Why is it that some women expect men to "just know" what they want? Or, why is it that some men find it difficult to express their feelings, leaving the females in their lives confused? Here's the book that helps readers communicate their feelings and finally understand what the men and women in their personal lives, as well as in the workplace, are thinking and why they act the way they do. This fascinating book discusses the differences in the way the opposite sex communicates including body language and conversational styles and shows readers how they can overcome communication barriers and improve their relationships. Couples learn how to become sensitive to each other's emotions and figure out if their mate is "in the mood," having a bad day, and more.
