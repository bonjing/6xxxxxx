Kyla Brox is back with her most exciting release to date. 'Grey Sky Blue' is a 12 track acoustic extravaganza, featuring the unique guitar skills of Danny Blomeley and Kyla's luscious vocals. The pair are joined by some pretty splendid guests in the shape of Tony Marshall on spine-tingling sax, Clive Mellor on fiery harmonica and sweet sisterly harmonies from Buffy Brox, among others.

'Grey Sky Blue' is a heady mix of moody, classic blues and moving personal reflection, along with the cheeky lyrics and chunky, funky riff-driven songs that showcase Danny's explosive guitar style so well. From the deep, raw sound of "All Breaking Down" to the intimate "Kasbah" and the jazzy "Since I Fell For You", Kyla's rich voice wraps you up and takes you to a place you won't want to leave.  This is without doubt her most accomplished vocal performance, yet.
