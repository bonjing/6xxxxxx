Guest Stars -- George Gobel, Ken Curtis, and Joe Flynn.


This amusing story is one of my favorites of the 
occasional WAGON TRAIN comedies, with Ken Curtis in a 
small role as a very Americanized, fast-talking Indian Chief.

There was a minor issue with my new cable box with this episode. 
We got 2 phone calls when it aired, and for about 10 to 15 seconds 
each both logos of a phone alert appear on the screen. After I 
saw them I figured out how to turn that off, so it won't happen again.
