,Tagakuro,2011-07-10T18:53Z,"Here is the problem with this game:
I tried burning this game twice... Yes my Xbox is cracked.
The game runs the intro that's for sure, and when you select Campaing mode, and it's about to start the mission, it automatically fails...
DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS... IT FAILS
****** RELEASE....
You'll waste time, Money, and life."
