If you look a bit harder Indycar torrents are not that hard to find.
There are some private trackers that get them all. The problem is that the uploaders with fast connections that get stuff from the private trackers and bring it to the public ones (there are a number of them here) don't seem to be interested in Indycar.

By the way my utorrent also shows (2) as the seeds, but as of now there is still only one ;)"
