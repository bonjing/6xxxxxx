,lalawawa,2011-07-12T02:48Z,"Hey, Mudstomper
It would be awesome if I could download this but you're not on. It would be good if you could. 
thanks"
,Mudstomper,2011-07-12T07:51Z,"lalawawa... download what?

Are you talking about the 32 bit version?

Otherwise theres plenty of seeders, and 1 seeder for the 32 bit version on now.


I seeded the 32 bit version for a few days solid and there were plenty of leechers, guess theres some f*$k wits on this site who wont contribute.... unfortunately my data limit is maxed out for the mo.... I will re-seed it for you in a weeks time if thats what your after?

I'm wanting to get the Vray 2 for 3ds max (64) but ive been leeching for like 6 hours lol and nothing. hmmm. "
,lalawawa,2011-07-13T00:27Z,"Hey So I put all the files in the right places but when I choose the renderer in the render settings I choose vray 2 but when I go and click ""render"", It says,""cannot obtain licence."" Help please!
thanks"
,Mudstomper,2011-07-13T01:31Z,"lalawawa....

This would usually indicate you missed a folder.... Perhaps you didnt copy & replace who knows?

Try again as per the instructions and if it still fails  reinstall & follow these installation instructions from sober11:

""1. Installation Type : Workstation
 2. Make sure your 3D Max directories are correct as shown in the default installation.
 3. Select local V-ray license server on this machine & check Register V-ray menus
 4. Uncheck Install WIBU key drivers, keep uncheck also Register the V-ray License Server (this works for me). Check this in your next re-install if it doesn't work for you.""

I dont think step 4 is critical.

Thats crap about the seeders 11 on now? "
,lalawawa,2011-07-14T01:47Z,Hey So I tried his method and it's working nicely. Thanks man for this and I'm not sure why the seeders weren't seedin before. But all is well. Thankyou!
,Mudstomper,2011-07-14T12:27Z,Cool...good to hear... enjoy.
,Osiris397,2011-07-28T19:53Z,I hope someone can upload Vray 2.0 for Maya.  I don't necessarily want to try to learn Max just yet.

,RevGreen,2011-09-22T06:04Z,"I've been looking to add a render slave to my network, and this requires the running of the V-Ray license server - only problem is, it doesn't look like it will run without the WIBU drivers/dongle.

Does anyone know of a way around the WIBU drivers/dongle for distributed rendering?"
