Vray 2.0 (x64) SP1 (2.10.01) for 3DS Max  2012 

Build 2.10.01 official!!

Please read these instructions before posting you couldn't get this to work, if you still having trouble leave a comment and I will try to help:

Copy & paste vray2012.dlll & cgauth.dll into your 3ds Max root directory e.g.
C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2012 (or where ever you have it installed)
Copy & paste cgauth.dll into C:\Program Files\Chaos Group\V-Ray\RT\bin

Then youâ€™re good to go.

Note: I am the unique seeder so be patient and please seed for a while.
