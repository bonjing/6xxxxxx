Proper Note:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
  We decided to proper the SKIDROW release now, because both the initial
  release and the subsequent crackfixes are sloppy to say the least.

  Their main release, due to a questionable source, contains a bad file in the
  following dir:

  <install>\Game\Alice2\AliceGame\CookedPC\Maps\Chapters\Chapter2\Chapter2_W1

  RLD: 180a8798cab39b869889abee76a93b4a *Chapter2_W1_Bottle1_01_S.umap
  SR : fc3d31968697301eabf68e77192a146f *Chapter2_W1_Bottle1_01_S.umap

  Additionally, the crackfix that followed had severe calling-home problems,
  and firewalling or deleting the files suggested in the nfo of yet another
  fix is not a failsafe solution. The crack wont start when applied to a new
  install.
  
  Our crack works fine and does not call home.

  We present you with a proper release for the archives!
