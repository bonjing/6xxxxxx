This is the original factory Install CD-ROM that shipped in the box with the Creative AWE64 Gold ISA Sound Card.

This ISO Image was originally posted in the VOGONS forums by user "retro games 100" I'm just creating a torrent to make sure this ISO stays alive on the internet for a very long time.

The original VOGONS forums thread where this item was posted is here: http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=28779

There is a single *.PNG file in the torrent titled "Virus-Scan.png", this is a screenshot of me scanning the entire ISO contents with Avast! Anti-Virus version 5.xx with current virus definitions at the time of posting this, so that you can download this file alone before getting the ISO, and showing it's clean.

If you find this torrent useful, please help seed.
