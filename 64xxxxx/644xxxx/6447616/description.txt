                Detective drama series following two officers who
                work in a Manchester police unit specialising in
                murder cases. Rachel's personal life gets even more
                complicated when she reveals to Nick that she is
                pregnant. At work, the team face a particularly
                gruesome case - a mother of two has been brutally
                raped and left to bleed to death in the boot of her
                car. A sharp piece of detective work from Rachel
                leads to teenager Luke Farrell being charged, but
                horrific events start to unravel as a result of his
                arrest. Janet steps up her investigation into her
                childhood friend Veronica's death and meets up with
                an officer who investigated the murder.
