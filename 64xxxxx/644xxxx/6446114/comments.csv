,scottsasse,2011-08-06T01:41Z,"Oh yeah, THANKS for not splitting into 2 cd's like many dip-shit's out there do!! It's 2011, they better learn to use DVD's instead :)"

,ilive4harleys,2011-10-30T15:28Z,"#1> I have uploaded many torrents but they are not here. I sent to the powers that be to find out what I did wrong. I like to try and keep at least a 1:1 ratio.
#2> What I mean, of course, is upload the T_S files and I will grab them and burn it. Just to clear up any misunderstandings.
Thanx much!
