Shogun 2 v1.1.0 Build 3444 Full & Incremental Patch Incl Hattori & Crack

=================================================================

Here you have the full 1.1 patch, which includes the DX11 update.
I have also included an incremental update for those who already
have the DX11 update and don't want to download everything again.
(Tick just the Incremental update file when adding the torrent).

Took some time to find the new update, build 3444, so I thought I
would share my find.

=================================================================

Whatâ€™s new:

Multi-core processor issues solved
Some bug fixes
(Can't find an exact changelog)

=================================================================

Instructions:

1. Extract the patch you want to use

2. Copy and paste those files to your Shogun 2 folder

3. Overwrite all

4. Play the game!

=================================================================

I found all those files and repacked them and uploaded them here
so anyone can take part of them.
