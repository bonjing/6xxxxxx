,Echiman,2011-06-02T05:11Z,Is it workable? no virus?
,eXoflow,2011-06-02T09:38Z,"I have the patch installed and it works. No my AV, Eset Smart Security, haven't reported a virus."
,myroslavmail,2011-06-02T18:26Z,Game works fine with this so at least is not a bad torrent. The only bad side is what those updates do?
,LoLzzz2,2011-06-03T04:16Z,Thanks ... Works Great
,eXoflow,2011-06-03T11:14Z,"@myroslavmail

Well they fixes some crashes and slow loading on multi-cores I guess, maybe not a crucial update but still, they released it so it must do something :P"
,Edelnar,2011-06-04T13:40Z,"If only someone could add Ikko Ikki patch DLC to those updates. New units are already there in patch, but they are unlocked only with Ikko Ikki."
,eXoflow,2011-06-04T14:51Z,"@Edelnar

I will upload it if I find it, but it haven't been released yet though."
,Bad213Boy,2011-06-07T17:34Z,Someone still needs to fix the movies pack file. There's 3 intros that don't work and the Takeda's ending doesn't work.
,Edelnar,2011-06-08T18:44Z,I think they don't work for any clan's victory even with movie pack fix.
,Merlin8989,2011-06-09T09:26Z,"I wasn't sure if this was the patch 1 or patch 2 but due to the file size and the fact that it adds DX11 support, i'm pretty sure this is patch 2.

Here is the official change log for anyone interested:

,Merlin8989,2011-06-09T09:35Z,"Found a more popular torrent if anyones interested:

,eXoflow,2011-06-12T00:13Z,"@Merlin8989

That is not the same update, this is a newer patch. I just compressed it better than the one you linked."
,Merlin8989,2011-06-12T22:03Z,"@eXoflow

damn i already downloaded the other one. What is the difference between the two? Also, why are their patches so confusing? Instead of 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, we have ""patch 2""(their official site) and ""build 3444""? Can someone explain this to me?"
,eXoflow,2011-06-14T00:50Z,"@Merlin

There is no major difference. Only install this if you are experiencing crashes or feel like the game doesn't run as it should, or if you like me, want to be up to date.

As steam is releasing the updates, they don't have proper versions really. Often patch 1 = the first update they release, patch = the second and so on. I can't give you a patch number on this though, between 3-5 I think, cause I've seen numerous other builds released.

For this game, the higher the build number the newer is the patch. Build 3517 has been released but I can't find a crack for it yet, nor a changelog."
,theanith,2011-06-16T22:47Z,It crush when i click on Option to open option menu anyone help plz
,Bad213Boy,2011-06-23T05:25Z,Has anyone fixed the cut scenes yet? Because a lot of the cut scenes were either in the wrong order or they just didn't play. There needs to be a movies2.pack file fix.
,Echiman,2011-06-25T19:07Z,"try here : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6457648/shogun_2_total_war_Movies2.pack

,SambamanPajdoKoma,2011-07-10T10:54Z,"Dude i don't get it. It installed and everything works, but when i run the game loading is still taking a shitload of time. Do i need to reinstall it or anything?"
,Griften,2011-07-10T23:54Z,wheres the ikko ikki dlc? its been a month...
,oblaz,2011-08-06T04:52Z,"New DLC Sengoku Jidai on ali213 site.

,paganompu,2011-09-04T13:33Z,"I'm trying to get this to work with the FLT release. Game runs fine in DX9 mode, but crashes within minutes when run in DX11. My PC is above recommended specs and runs other DX11 games fine. Can anyone suggest anything I could try?"
,cruc1al,2011-09-07T15:50Z,paganompu try monitoring VRAM use with MSI afterburner. I had a problem in Civ 5 DX11 where it would hog up so much VRAM that it caused a crash very soon. Didn't have that problem in DX9 where mem usage stayed well below 1gig.
,sergio_sos,2011-09-25T16:56Z,thank you!
,skycraper,2011-09-25T20:39Z,"works perfectly, thx uploader!"
,azizex666,2011-10-05T09:24Z,Thanks for the upload!
,Bad213Boy,2011-11-26T22:17Z,"***UPDATE ONCE AGAIN***

This download is old and is missing tons of stuff, including the movies. If you want the complete version with all movies and DLC's do a search for:

Total War Shogun 2 v.1.10 + 3DLC RePack by R.G.Mechanics

R.G.Mechanics is Build 4247, so I don't think you'll need to download ""Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack"" patch. Either way, you'll still need ""patch10.pack Build 4358"" & ""3DMGAME-Shogun2.v1.1.0.Build.4358.0.Crack.Fix2.Patch-3DM"".

Do another search for:
 [FSrv] Total War Shogun 2 : Rise of the Samurai + IkkoIkki & SJUP DLC + Latest Patch & Crack

Anyone who's played Build 4247 knows how fucked up the game is. The latest patch, Build 4358, and crack are on the thread 35:

 patch10.pack build 4358
