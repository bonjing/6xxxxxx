Release Notes

A magic explosion in the studio of Doodleus, the Master Doodler, has
hexed his pet bugs into his doodles. Grab the magic pen and help
Doodleus to free them again. Do you have the skill and precision to
handle hundreds of bugs at once? Do you have what it takes to be a
Master Doodler?

In each level you play through a new doodle to rescue the bugs that
have been hexed into it. Sometimes there are lots of them - hundreds
of them The problem is, the bugs have minds of their own and move
according to their own rules.

only help you have is your magic pen, which you use to draw new lines
into the doodle, changing the doodle, building roads, bridges and
stairs that allow the bugs to reach the honey...
