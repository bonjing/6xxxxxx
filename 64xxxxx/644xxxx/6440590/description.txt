Ron Wood had a rough couple years following the publication of his 2007 autobiography, splitting with his wife of over 20 years and entering rehab for yet another time, but you never would be able to tell this based on his 2010 album I Feel Like Playing. Like his previous six solo albums, it has nothing more on its mind than a good time, a studio party where everybody is invited. 
Woods alcohol problems have been well documented but when he is well, he is an artist of the highest caliber. He wrote ten of the twelve tracks, which speaks well for his health. The lyrics are introspective and thoughtful as many of them focus on the problems that have plagued him. He does not give in to his weaknesses but faces them bluntly through this music. There is sorrow, bitterness, criticism, and a little triumph mixed in for good measure. His raspy voice remains an effective instrument to interpret his songs.
