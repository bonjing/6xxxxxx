BOOK INFO:

To leave our planet liveable in the next millennium mankind is forced to find environmentally friendly ways in solving the problems of everyday life. Among others, technologies of producing chemicals, absolutely necessary for maintaining a comfortable life, have to be modified, in some instances fundamentally changed now, or in the very near future.

Developing new technologies requires strong and innovative fundamental research. In order to provide opportunity for crossfertilization the Federation of European Zeolite Associations (FEZA) decided to organise a conference, where researchers from academia as well as industry can meet, exchange ideas, show and discuss research efforts and results concerning the development of environmentally friendly processes and technologies.

The conference, and thus the proceedings are divided into two main parts. The first part contains works concerning the synthesis, modification and characterisation of zeolitic materials as catalyst candidates in environmentally friendly technologies. Works in the second part describe various applications starting from developing highly selective reactions for the fine chemical industry, through waste-water treatment to applying zeolite for formulating bacteria for pest control.
