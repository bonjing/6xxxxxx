,hroth,2011-06-03T09:18Z,"Doesn't work for Windows 7 Ultimate x64 bit.  Tried many, many times, and it keeps telling me to close the application when nothing is running except the Keygen.  It seems to be fucking with the registry in a way that prevents it from doing anything.  Lame."
,hroth,2011-06-03T09:21Z,"I retract my previous comment.  Apparently you can't install Protected Folder along with it.  Otherwise it will not work.  After cleaning the registry with CCleaner and uninstalling PF it worked.  Very strange, but at least it worked.  Thanks Anacondaz."
,mEmOkIrI,2011-06-05T06:47Z,"works great ... rep added m8

,greg0415,2011-06-10T19:34Z,"Keygen doesn't work on my 64bit Win 7 machine
Do you have a working serial that I could use to activate it?
Am facing a similar problem with another software.
Incidentally both yours above and the other  software work just fine on my 32bit XP Pro machine."

,LoveCracks,2011-06-18T19:59Z,"Thx man perfect crack.

Don't know how to patch but now not neccesary.

BTW DISCONECT FROM INTERNET BEFORE INTERRING SERIAL WILL HELP ALOT "
,LoveCracks,2011-06-18T20:00Z,"Thx man perfect crack.

Disconnect before entering serial will help alot."
,Wulf579,2011-06-28T04:26Z,"The problem with Windows 7 64bit is as follows:

System retains serial as long as the program is not shut down, or the system is abruptly turned off (like when you lose power briefly). When this happens, the program reverts back to the ""free"" version when it is restarted."
,SolidMario7,2011-06-29T04:03Z,Yup same thing happens to me as Wulf579. I'm also Windows 7 64bit.
,kaniz2011,2011-10-08T04:44Z,Thanks! :)
,wuanbonebilly,2012-01-31T05:03Z,what u do is disconnect internet connection when activating....then cut pc off...leave internet connection disconnected..restart your computer...when the programs has finished opening...connect your internet connection...it will say for an instant FREE...then it will reset itself...and your program is updated....I DON'T KNOW if when u turn your computer off if it will revert back to FREE.... mine didn't....
