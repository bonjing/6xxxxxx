,aabbaac,2011-06-10T05:26Z,"This is an ok video to watch if you just want the story of it all.
The sound is actually quite good, but the video flickers a lot, and I do not believe itâs on purpose.
I would give this torrent a sound score of 8 out of 10 and a video score of 5 out of 10.
This is more than enough to see the film just to have seen it, but I recommend all to download a dvd/blue-ray rip when they come out for the full experience which is missing from this one."
,aabbaac,2011-06-10T05:27Z,"Oh yes. 
The video/sound synchronization was quite good and I would score that at 9 out of 10."
,krazyfeline82,2011-06-12T04:55Z,Awsome Download Fast... Audio: 9 Video:9 best you can find of the X-Men on Cam. Thanks Crazy-Torrent! Think you can get Super 8? that would be awesome!
