,mbw23,2011-06-06T08:00Z,"oof my ratio hit almost 200% before I had the entire torrent.  time to share a bit more on the upload side, kids.  :-D   thx for the post!"
,wunderfrekk,2011-06-09T06:21Z,Not that I don't appreciate the upload. But can I just raise the question of WHY THE FUCK TO WE STILL HAVE TO HAVE X NUMBER OF RAR FILES IN EVERY FUCKING RELEASE??? The rar shit started back in the days when DC was fun. To work around the multisource issue. Can we PLEASE kill this? Don't tell me checksum issues cause they're already covered in the torrent system...
