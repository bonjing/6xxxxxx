[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-06T01:13Z,"All episodes Bluray rip + all the extras + subtitles. This is being seeded with a 1 Gigabit connection. You automatically get the next piece when your previous piece has been uploaded, so increase your upload rate and this will fly.

Once you have it, seed it.

Enjoy.  "
[T],insinuendo,2011-06-06T01:41Z,"Well done.

Great show...

Can you provide media info?

A/V Bitrate

Audio : DTS?

I'll delete my BB torrents if you do..."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-06T01:59Z,"I hate to sound negative but no, I don't have that information. I've never known how to do it and I've never needed to. It's a straight Blu-ray rip and I downloaded the subtitles from elsewhere.

There's no need to delete your uploads of Breaking Bad in any case. I'm not one of those loons who sees other torrents as competition, let's keep both torrents going and we'll both help keep the show alive."
[T],insinuendo,2011-06-06T02:16Z,Is season 3 the REWARD release?
[V],GoodFilms,2011-06-06T14:26Z,"Similar torrents simply DO reduce the swarms and longevity of both. TBH it would make a lot more sense at this point to just post the third season, as insinuendo has good swarms for the other 2.

The 3rd season is the Reward release, so thanks very much for that. Audio is DTS. You can use mediainfo to find enconding stats.

This is a great show :)"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-10T17:47Z,"Rex, I have some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that I don't have the discs, I have looked and I can't find the audio commentary anywhere, sorry. The good news is that there are more fit birds in Brazil than anywhere else in the world so you can cheer yourself up by going to the beach and have a perv at the birds. Hope that helps. "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-12T21:07Z,"I need some feedback please guys. This is the first blu-ray rip I've done. I'm struggling to get seeders, I've uploaded about 4TB of this so far. 

Is blu-ray just too big for people? Would you prefer HDTV rips or DVD Rips instead of the blu-ray ones? 

I expected this to be much better seeded than it is. Should I not bother with blu-ray's in the future and just stick to smaller files? "
,OzzyllaN,2011-06-15T01:29Z,"Very nice compilation mate, don't worry mate the torrent is great, but there are always people who prefer to watch eyecancer than better quality. Keep up ;)"
,OzzyllaN,2011-06-15T01:29Z,"I forgot to ask, is this uncensored? Will seed afterwards ;)"
,3doxiemom,2011-06-17T13:50Z,thanks for your hours of work for our viewing pleasure!
,Ultraball,2011-06-22T17:04Z,"Great torrent! Thanks Toilet_sniffer_V. Seeding at 2mb/sec.

V 10"
,z1x,2011-06-25T18:04Z,"You did a great job Toilet_sniffer_V!
Picture quality is great and DTS audio is superb.
Though big files it was worth the download.
Worked on my blue-ray player after remuxing with MKVtoolnix, since it couldn't handle embedded subs that were on S1 and S3 (non on S2). The S2 subs are not correctly synced and probably impossible to sync sadly since they don't seem to match. The embedded subs on S1 and S3 works, extract with MKVcleaver if needed, though I never used the subs anyway."
,Tyaigan,2011-06-27T16:50Z,"Thanks a lot for his superb quality rip,

The only huge pain for me it the S2 Subtitles (i'm deaf).

Anyone found the proper subs ?
I think the probleme come from the ""previously in breaking bad"" wich is not on your rip.

Thanks again

B."
,HAL_NINE000,2011-06-28T12:30Z,It is downloading at 7 KB/s!!! come on people!!! Seed!
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-06-28T19:10Z,This is being uploaded from a 1 gig broadband account so if you are getting a slow download rate it must be your settings.
,mancbhoy,2011-07-11T22:55Z,"what settings do you recommend? because im only 4.5kB/s DL & 0.8kB/s UL rather than my usaul 700 or 800 dl speed, i will seed this for as long as you like, if i can just download it, cos it does look great quality"

,falselight666,2011-07-13T03:00Z,"Thanks for the upload, it's much appreciated, i have the Australian region 4 DVD of season 3 and it's missing 4 of the commentaries that are found on the region 1 DVD, Ep. 1 - No Mas, Ep. 5 - Mas, Ep. 10 - Fly, Ep. 13 - Full Measure, i think it's missing a few other extras too but i'm not sure, can someone please upload some mp3's of these missing commentaries, i really want to listen to these before i start watching the 4th season. I'd be eternally grateful, thanks again!!"
,infected_scarz,2011-07-13T17:56Z,"Awesome! Thanks, took me two days to download and I will seed as long I can!"

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-16T22:05Z,"Britney Spears is not in this torrent. Sorry to disappoint any Britney fans. It's 100% Breaking Bad.

Thanks for the heads up re Season 4."
,honored,2011-07-18T07:25Z,does this torrent include spanish audio the the mkv file? didnt see seprate audio file in the extra so i assume its either merged and set to second or third audio or not included.
,GuZiZMAD,2011-07-19T08:30Z,Can we get some more seeders on here. Going by really slow. I'm doing the best I can myself
,rhsjr7,2011-07-26T04:24Z,Seems most of the 'Seeders' are way throttled down.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-08-07T03:03Z,"I've put this back in my seedbox, it's now being uploaded via a 20 Gig line. Please seed at a decent speed."
,Xrick,2011-08-08T23:07Z,Download speed is pretty slow.
,cbakker86,2011-08-18T21:22Z,"Thnx for the upload!

Tip: Please test the subtitles before adding them to the torrent.

The correct english subtitles for season 2 can be found at podnapisi  breaking-bad-2008-subtitles-p793159"
,clint09,2011-08-22T02:27Z,"Great Show 
But This torrent downloads real slow.
Find something else because seeders are seeding with limited upload speeds IMO"
,Ormerus,2011-08-28T17:31Z,IS ANYONE SEEDING?!

,Dirtydogpirate,2011-09-12T08:14Z,"i love yur torrents but answering your question from early on, yes, in general bluray is too big especially for 4 seasons on the show. hdtv is better in my oppie. or dvdrip. love your torrents though, keep it up, i keep like an 8 to 1 upload to down ration or better"
,snapoo,2011-09-26T07:31Z,Seed! Seed! Seed! Download speeds are terrible.
