BOOK INFO:

People working in development of drugs, pesticides, washing detergents, etc., are obliged by law to conduct analyses of the "metabolic pathways" or "maps" for the chemical compounds that they are using or proposing. 
Everyone in these industries or carrying out research toward such products is therefore interested in having a reference on these compounds. 

Key Features
* Covers literature relating to degradation and metabolic profiles of molecules
* Draws together the literature on degradation and metabolism patterns with that on diversified conditions of the environmental systems
* Indicates 3D chemical structures, predicted physico-chemical parameters, logP and the SMILES chemical notations of the parent compounds to assist scientists design the lead compounds for new discovery using computer-aided technology
