Search, Browse and Read Man Pages: Fast and Easy!

Manpower is a man page GUI for Mac OS X. Man pages are the main system of Unix software documentation, offering descriptions of the functionality and methods of the various Unix command-line programs. Man pages are typically accessed in the Unix terminal--but this is cumbersome. It takes a lot of typing to search and read man pages in the Unix console. Manpower provides a simple, elegant three-pane interface that makes reading man pages as easy as reading e-mail.
