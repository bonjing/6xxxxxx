
Take one oversize talent with an ego the size of the chip on his shoulder. Put him in front of a frenzied German audience, and set him loose. What do you have? One of the greatest live albums in rock & roll history. Recorded in 1964 at the same club where the Beatles cut their teeth, Live at the Star Club, Hamburg captures the Killer when he was on the outs as a recording artist.

He just needed an audience, a piano, and a rhythm section willing to hang on to "old Jerry Lee" for dear life. The repertoire is rife with staples of the day--"Money," "Mean Woman Blues," "Long Tall Sally," "Hound Dog"--but the Killer has no trouble customizing them with his pumping piano and insinuating vocals. "When Jerry does something, I do it mighty good," he boasts in "What'd I Say." No argument here.
