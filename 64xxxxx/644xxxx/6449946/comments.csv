,Anmaddox,2011-06-15T08:12Z,"Could I please get a couple more people to seed? My gf and I would rather not wait 4 weeks for this to dl. If it does, well, she might just kill me."

,BowWowNow,2011-06-29T21:51Z,"Excellent, thanks! Just a heads up; Order of Pheonix SRT is not a clean SRT. Does not work in some hardware players."
,BowWowNow,2011-06-29T22:11Z,"Fix: Download Aegissub, install, rename Bla-bla-bla-Pheonix-eng.srt to same but .SSA. Open in Aegissub. Export as .SRT. Good to go."

,flak1969,2011-07-15T04:55Z,"Not sure why the hit and run rate on this movie is so high but if you will accomodate others as others have accomodated you, you'll seed this at least 1:1 when you're done downloading."
,Blackout046,2011-07-15T23:15Z,Thanks!
,hsmwilz,2011-07-21T12:14Z,"come on guys, seed please! and by the way, the video and audio quality seems great! "
,bposaune,2011-07-22T16:59Z,"FYI, Deathly Hallows, Audio is out of sync 2nd part of the movie.  Video is before the audio."
,bposaune,2011-07-22T17:07Z,"FYI, Deathly Hallows, Audio is out of sync in 2nd part of movie.  Video is before audio by about .200 ms.

Great upload other than that.  Best one to download other than the flaw.  Had to download HDLITE's upload of deathly hallows to avoid the sync probelm of this one."
,brbido,2011-07-30T01:26Z,"thanks mann. i really appreciate your up, this is a good definition for my internet, because is very slow and 1080p would take too long to download.

,R3d0x,2011-08-15T22:34Z,"Thanx so much for this. It is by far the best size/quality Harry pack that I can find. Video quality I find especially astounding (sound is great also :)
Hope this group will be doing the part 2 also so I can complete my collection."
,maukasnakki,2011-08-25T11:50Z,Otherwise good but this is bullshit for cinematography lovers! All movies are cropped from 2.40 to 16:9. Would you crop Mona Lisa painting to fit it in to tv?
,millanboy,2011-09-14T16:02Z,"@MAFIAA. and everyone else.
Please seed at least for a little while longer. I've been downloading for several and it's still slow :( "
