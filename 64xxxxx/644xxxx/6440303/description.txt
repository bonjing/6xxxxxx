From Prefix:

New Jersey\'s Com Truise garnered some critical attention in 2010 with the release of his Cyanide Sisters EP, which he offered for free at first. But everything changed when the folks at Ghostly International heard the project and inked a deal with the producer. He added some bonus material to the EP and re-released it on the label. Truise then began crafting his proper debut full-length, Galactic Melt, an apt title for a record filled with space-y synthesizers, glitchy noises, and \'80s-esque percussion.
