so what i did was install the 64 bit version as discribed above, but a roll back on a windows XP 32 bit VM, copied my install directory and the crack over to the VM, unhooked the net on the VM and patched it and made the registration, copied it back over without the crack, reverted my VM and it and registered it with the dat file the crack made and it worked perfectly 
than reverted the VM 

i suggest doing this if you want this to work 

its great for making proprietary USB devices open source "
