                Confidential goes behind the scenes for the epic
                series finale set on the asteroid, Demons Run. We
                discover how the Doctor Who team create the newest
                baddies, turn a small platoon of clerics into an army
                and transform an alley in Cardiff into Jack the
                Ripper's London. Features a day in the life of a
                Doctor Who enemy and in-depth interviews with Karen
                Gillan, Arthur Darvill, Alex Kingston, Frances Barber
                and lead writer Steven Moffat.
