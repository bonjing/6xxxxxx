Notes:
Tested with VLC
This is a very small, lower quality version.
So expect crap video and ok sound.
Meant to be viewed in a small window on a computer. (Double size is the most I'd zoom)
Made for people who have slow internet or have to watch their bandwidth use.
Capped from a SD source.
If you are looking for a high quality version look for one of the scene's HD releases.
