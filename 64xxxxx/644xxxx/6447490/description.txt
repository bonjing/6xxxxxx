Wondered why da hell Tallica could not release the second DVD in the Orgullo Pasion Y Gloria boxset in CD format so that it would be possible to play the concert without watching the DVD video.

Well here you go! Direct ripped from the DVD 2 Concert! Much better than the livemetallica crap version. 

Hear the gig in your car or on your stereo without watching the video.

MP3 format 320 kbps
