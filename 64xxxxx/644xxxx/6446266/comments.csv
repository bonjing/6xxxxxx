,GODdoesntEXIST,2011-06-09T05:05Z,these were stolen from another tracker
[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-09T06:00Z,"Stolen? Actually.. it's called copyright infringement (aka sharing information).
From a tracker that claims 'knowledge must be free', for fuck's sake!"
,malik_bhai11,2011-06-09T06:07Z,"DohDuhDah!,

I am extremly thankful to you for your effort to upload this very useful Torrent, but The number of frekin leechers is way more then seeders which is ofcourse not usual with your torrents.

So please I humbly request to you to Seed the fuck out of this torrent, so the generations to come will use this information. lolz

** SEED SEED and PLZ SEED **

,zzolee30,2011-06-10T13:00Z,"Can't agree with you more ""knowledge must be free"""
,raenkae,2011-06-11T02:47Z,"YES! You are truly an lifesaver dohduhdah. I have had much valuable help from these lectures.

Although i have an request if you would mind. Sadly the courses i need most are his physics-courses in elektronics, namely Physics 3 vol 1-2 and chemistry 1 and 2. I am about to start my study in engineering electronics. But there are some chemistry too, conduits and such.

Really if you can find any of these courses or you can point me in the right direction, need it badly.

REQUEST:
Physics 3: VOL 1 DVD
Physics 3: VOL 2 DVD
Chemistry 1
Chemistry 2

Whatever you can find is good for me. Thanks anyway for a really good torrent, and keep up the good work. Knowledge is very important in this day and age!"

hey - no one has these, i looked EVERYWHERE, thats why i bought them because i needed them - but those 4 courses all together cost me 120 bucks, which is cheaper than the site because i got them on amazon.

i can hook u up with a copy them tho but wed have to work something out, email me at a.delarge23@yahoo.com"
,GODdoesntEXIST,2011-06-11T16:57Z,"when i said stolen, what i meant was that i uploaded this to a tracker that disallows anyone from removing their material to public sites like THIS one. and on top of it, you didnt give me credit, these are my releases, i paid for these myself and you took them and claimed them as yours. You should ALWAYS give credit to the original uploader. I was able to confirm very easily that they were mine - #1 because you cant find them ANYWHERE else, and #2 because i checked all the details on them

this is a tracker, so obviously stealing isnt a big deal, but pirates shouldnt steal from each other. I have no problem with you gettin this from another tracker, even if its against their rules - simply because thats between YOU and that tracker, i cant control what other people do

But it would have been nice to see you not take credit for this, and ALL The other ones that you put on here, which are due to the hard work of others, such as finding the material and taking the endless amount of time to convert it, ect...

I love all your stuff, man, im not trying to give you a hard time. But i put a lot of my resources to bring these to people because they were NOWHERE to be found. And it would be nice if you give credit where its due, on this, and on ALL Your releases"
,indiaman,2011-06-12T18:03Z,"Dohduhdah,you are the greatest uploader.The number of wonderful lectures you have uploaded is phenomenal.Anyone who doubts that should check your uploads.Thanks from a grateful heart.
Could you please upload (also from MathTutorDVD)-
1)Physics 3 ,Vol.2(Capacitance & Magnetism)
2)Chemistry 1 ,Vol.1
3)Chemistry 2 ,Vol.1"
[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-12T19:19Z,"I didn't claim them to be mine anywhere, I simply uploaded them here. Besides, I've stated previously in my comments that all credits go to the creators and rippers. Also, in the past I've mentioned the source for some of my uploads, but then people would complain that I shouldn't mention the source, because that might attract unwanted attention. Also, if you want credit, you should add a textfile in your torrents where you tell people you did the work of ripping it and sharing it. I wouldn't remove such info if it was there.
Just because you'd like to have your name mentioned as the ripper, that doesn't mean that others want that as well, so by default I don't specify where I obtained the material, unless I've ripped it myself. In this case the uploader was EbolaSniper, so credits for ripping belong to him. If that is you, thanks, but I don't think ripping something entitles you to claim ownership of it. I refuse to accept any spurious ownership claims pertaining to intellectual property in digital form. "
,zzolee30,2011-06-23T16:29Z,Can you upload the Pre-Algebra DVD's please ?
[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-25T03:16Z,"The only pre-algebra content I can find on other torrent sites is called ""Fractions Thru Algebra"", and is already included in this archive:

,Pratzy,2011-06-25T06:19Z,"Thanks alot man, that was a good upload.

I'm also searching for 'Math Advantage 2008'
Could you upload it plz?
2008 NOT 2009 or 2010 which suck balls.
Thx."
[V],dohduhdah,2011-06-25T23:14Z,"@Pratzy

Sorry, can't find 'Math Advantage 2008' yet at my favorite education-oriented torrent repository."
,zzolee30,2011-07-01T11:12Z,"Thanks dohduhdah ,I'm also inerested for myself in a ttc course :http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/courses/course_detail.aspx?cid=1720 ,thanks for the great work"
,Pratzy,2011-09-13T20:17Z,"Hmm, that's okay, I've been making good use of your other uploads for sometime now,and I don't think I need more.

Thanks once again for the awesome uploads, you've saved me a fucking shitload of money. ^_^"

,drymoused,2012-03-05T09:59Z,"GODdoesntEXIST: There are few things more annoying that pirates whining about not getting credit for their theft. No one - and I mean NO ONE - cares about the idiotic ""rules"" on that other site. We are breaking the actual laws by downloading these! Do you really think we give a rats @$$ about you and your rules? Get an effing life!"
,JitterFly,2012-05-22T05:44Z,"Just as a note - the fourth and fifth videos on Variation of Parameters in the first folder are in the wrong order. If you watch the fourth one before the fifth, you will be utterly confused. Thought I would share."
