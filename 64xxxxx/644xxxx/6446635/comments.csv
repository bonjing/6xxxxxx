,brianxxx,2011-06-05T17:00Z,LOL! Gotta love the attitudes ungrateful assholes throw around and even worse -  the fact that they do not understand RAR files really shows how stupid they are.

,peejunk,2011-06-10T08:33Z,This release (and all other similar releases) are broken due to the fact that they use Trial installer and that Corel have put another layer of protection -- you're not supposed to have more than one trial installed on your machine. If you have Corel Draw X5 the trial installer from this release will refuse to proceed with installation.
,KengurBGD,2011-09-21T23:27Z,@mafia It ask me for CorelDESIGNERTechnicalSuiteX5Installer_EN.part011.rar if there is no files missing can you tell us in comment what files to rename so this stuff works ?
,KengurBGD,2011-09-21T23:56Z,OK read this: 1. Select All 00x1a/ extract (here) in folder; 2. Select All Part01/ extract (here) in folder; And then install. Warning: You must uninstall CorelDraw X5 before installing this. (You will get it again with Designer) It works! Hope I helped ppl :)
,KengurBGD,2011-09-22T00:12Z,@MAFIAA I know this maybe much but can we expect to get upgrade Deep Exloration 6 CCE cracked in future? Thx again for this fine torrent

[V],Slickinator,2011-09-26T13:44Z,and it all worked fine just extract all the files to another folder and then make sure the new folder is not in the same folder as the files or it will say the file name length is too much just move the extracted files to a diff folder and then extract the last pile of files and your good too go
