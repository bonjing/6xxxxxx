,bigporch,2011-06-06T08:03Z,"Where'd EZTV go!? This is tragic! Their site is down, and looks like their tracker is too 0 seeders 0 leechers?"
,da_300_squirrels,2011-06-06T08:03Z,gr8 upload but retarded seeders...
,bigporch,2011-06-06T08:04Z,Oh wait I take it back it's downloading... but weird that TPB says 0 seeders. But there are seeders. I will be one of them shortly.
,piratelover69,2011-06-06T08:20Z,can anyone pls compress this already...i want the 180mb version
,XmufasaX,2011-06-06T08:57Z,I've been downloading for about 2 hours and am at only 8.6% downloaded. My down speed has been fluxing around 0.0-8.0kB/s and my up has been around 300kB/s. I'm stopping seeding until my down is at least half my up..
,arkhamjoker78,2011-06-06T09:47Z,As usual the EZTV website is down. God knows why those cunts bother running a site its constantly down every week.
,arkhamjoker78,2011-06-06T09:47Z,there are currently 8600 seeders and nearly 18000 leechers

,HouseAtlantic,2011-06-06T10:31Z,"It's like they should make a whole other comment section for people who want to cry about the seeding situation. Patience is a virtue, and I bet most of them don't seed, either. Thank you eztv and ppl seeding! This show Must go on, Love it!!"
,AndroidLove,2011-06-06T11:18Z,"Has anyone downloaded this completely and verified? I know it's an eztv upload but lately I've been coming across a lot of fake uploads on these episodes under false names.

arkhamjoker78 could be aussie in which case you should understand alot of aussies use the word cunt in a completely different context than the rest of the word. here in aus it's lost all meaning. we say wassup cunt to each other like it means man.
