,slavik16,2011-06-02T14:05Z,"hey Martello,

Can you tell me what software can I use to chenge the video bitrate of an MKV file?
For example - to lower the bitrate of this movie from 11mbps to 9.5mbps?

TX"
,Martello,2011-06-02T14:53Z,U can use Handbrake. Quite easy to use. Search for it on Google for some tutorials...
,Martello,2011-06-02T20:07Z,I'm going to set the max upload to 200 kB/s because I want to game online this evening and I hate lag =). I will keep seeding throughout the night though. At around 11 pm I will give max bandwidth =D

I'm sorry I didn't mention the source. It was not intended. On the other hand I find it quite disturbing that you immediately call me a cunt..."
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-10-06T20:44Z,"sorry for being a bit too harsh, is not my way usually but you did drive me up the wall;

""This is a blu-ray rip from the US blu-ray disc. I included the DTS-ES core (24 bit) and Dutch subtitles.""
really? wow, US blu-ray disc! 
And why didn't you then include the Eng, Fre, Spa subs? Oh I see, you're too thick to be able to rip them, right? good job mate"
