Actually with permission of twentyforty Sir, would request you or anyone else to seed Fringe season 3... it was there few days in a tv mega pack BUT I could never complete ... now my plan has chaged to faster speed and upto .5 mbps upload. Will seed back this or other of twentyforty ups.

I have been seeding Fringe 3 since I downloaded it. Don't know why it doesn't show up for you. I see one person connected but he shows .2% so I don't think it's you."

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-07T17:52Z,"Whoever missed to join sceneunderground.org, please do that. 
I would up more (and more) there than on this hostile place which offer no decency to VIP uploaders, allowing all possible lunatics to say whatever they want and whenever they feel ""an urge"".

Frapper formed Search Group ""20-40"" on first page there, so past complaints about ""hard to find your torrents"" become obsolete."
