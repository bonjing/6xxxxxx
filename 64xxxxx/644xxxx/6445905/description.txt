Although George Clinton and Parliament were known for their futuristic, space-age cosmic-slop imagery, they were far from a one-trick pony. Case in point is 1978's brilliant Motor Booty Affair, which found Clinton and the gang diving into the deep and coming back up for air with a collection of aqua-based songs as trippy and otherworldly as anything the group ever created. Anchored by squiggly synths, courtesy of Bernie Worrell, the CD found Clinton's mouthpiece Starchild strapping on his fins and hanging with the stingrays. The slithery and soulful title track ranks as one of the most complex compositions of Clinton's career, and (You're a Fish and I'm A) Water Sign" is Clinton's psychedelic love jones in full effect. Parliament were a group that rarely went wrong, and this H20 funkfest ranks as one of their finest moments. --Amy Linden
