,Shadowtruth,2011-06-09T03:39Z,Thanks for the upload but their are a few problems.  The BATTLEFIELD 1942 SECRET WEAPONS OF WWII key will not take no matter how many times i copy and past or type it in their myself.  Also once all games are installed minus the last one it sends back and error asking for the CD-Rom to be inserted.    I am using Power ISO and never had to burn out a disc...could that be the problem?  Thanks again for the upload.
