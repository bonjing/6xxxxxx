notes:
i know this is a cut show 
reason being due too set list...
i was told never share & no copy
and all that nonsense...but i liberated this
but soon after vampires started poping up also
claiming to have...in which i doubted very much alot fake
people out there....down load sumet then say they have !
crazy people....this is only known source despite rkl's
claim too sdb...do i belive there is sdb ? yes i do
both nights 19 & 20 th have AUD & SDB'S...but is it
gonna go to the public ? truth is no...soon after i shared.
track four was uploaded on too youtube...so you see
even if i have sdb i wouldnt share & stamp as no copy
this music is taken for granted...
also lamely 100's possibly thousands got this now
been shared all over in ever file format thinkable..
yet here i'am AGAIN,why re ripp ? simple never had it in my pc
and secoundly this show deserve's respect hence this notation document.
