,BoonesFerry,2011-06-03T07:23Z,Thank you so much for providing torrents for this series. The first couple episodes were laughably horrible but they grew on me and now I'm hooked. 
,BoonesFerry,2011-06-03T07:59Z,"FYI Cindy25, I read that Episodes will be available online from showcase the day after they have aired.
