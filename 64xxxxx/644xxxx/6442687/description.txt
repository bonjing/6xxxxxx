notes:

OK, 1st of all:

It`s named REPACK, there is non-repacked version on the net [well, at 1 site only i hope], however it has first 10 minutes completely oos. This one is sync [well, for me it`s sync, but i`m almost deaf on right ear so you need to check sample ], so i let this one fly.

Yep, Red Riding Hood had few oos moments, this one does not [at least i don`t hear them ].

V: Russian DVDRip - big THX!
A: IMAGiNE`s cam audio [since there is no LiNE available, get it or leave it & wait for some LiNE]
