,awesomedary,2011-06-07T19:21Z,"my AntiVir shows that the .exe has a tr/crypt.xpack.gen troyan.

[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-08T10:40Z,"Its just a FALSE POSITIVE triggered by your. I am using Eset Smart Security and its detected nothing.

I suggest Update to Eset Smart Security. It is the best AV to use."
,awesomedary,2011-06-08T12:52Z,"alright, ill scan it with another antiVir, thanks but i would love some feedback from some1 who isn't the uploader"

,rcjedi23,2011-06-12T05:17Z,"Ive been looking for this game for a while, can anyone besides the loader confirm a false positive here? I use Avira also and it does pick up a trojan, and i also understand it could be a false positive. Please post if you know anything. Thank you"
,rcjedi23,2011-06-12T05:20Z,"@Hyperdrive25

Where did you get this from btw? You bought it or got it from another site?"
,S.Rose,2011-06-12T13:57Z,"Good Upload. Downloaded fine, false positive on the scan i also use eset nod32 and got nothing. Thanks hyper another great game. just wondering if you bought it or found it somewhere."
,S.Rose,2011-06-12T14:00Z,Sorry for the double. Will you be supporting updates? This game is awesome so far.
,rcjedi23,2011-06-12T19:01Z,"Alright. I downloaded it, scanned it with Avira, AVG and Eset. Avira was the only one that flagged it as a trojan, so it was 1 out of 3. Its good enought for a false positive. 
Thank you Hyperdrive25 for the upload, since ive been searching everywhere for this and its a great game. Ill also be buying it when its released to support the developers. "
,rcjedi23,2011-06-12T19:03Z,"Sry to be posting so much, but id also like to know if you will be supporting updates."
,awesomedary,2011-06-12T22:54Z,"aight, thanks for the feedback, i did find that the trojan was spreading to my windows files though, but mby i got it elsewhere, ;)"
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-06-16T16:22Z,"@awesomedary just download my Eset 5 torrent,
remove your old A.V. and install Eset 5 and apply the trial lock. 

Then retry the game. I guarantee you'll have no more problems."
,motley666,2011-06-21T16:26Z,Use this to scan http://virusscan.jotti.org/en
,fossil98,2011-07-04T22:59Z,I wish people would include version numbers in the description more. It makes it a pain to find the most recent version /w seeds.
,Amegon,2011-07-24T10:48Z,"Sure this is no 'bad' exe. it is a 7Zip exe file. you can unpack it even with winrar without executing. Kaspersky says that unpacked files are virusfree.
Version: Beta 0.9.005"
,orange7,2011-08-07T08:39Z,"Nothing wrong with this! unziped it with 7zip and its been working just fine. Seeding!

Thanks!

P.S. I swear TotalBiscuit is doing the voice acting!"
,Palazar,2011-08-12T13:16Z," Very nice game, recommended!

@Hyperdrive25

 Can you please help with the SPAZ quick fix for tactics panel crashing. Add it to this torrent or upload it somewhere else, because it's only available on this ""impulse client""."
,Twillidan,2011-08-14T15:16Z,@orange7 yes it is TB that dos the voice acting look at his WTF is SPAZ vid
,PGMP1979,2011-08-15T21:32Z,Hmm interesting the official release was today. Is this the beta version or something ? 
,PGMP1979,2011-08-15T21:35Z,Yep its the 0.9.005 should give us a good idea about the game before spending 15 dll on a indie game blindly
,Erbalist,2011-08-20T03:27Z,"I hate how everyones so keen to jump on the false positive bandwagon. Think about this, 98% of legit software is never flagged as a false positive virus. Yet when these crackers take a legit non flagged exe, and (supposedly) simply gut out the copywrite protection, it suddenly becomes picked up as a virus? when it should be the same code as before just minus some drm? I dont think so yhey must have put something else into there, it would be so easy to do."
,Mad_yojik,2011-08-28T13:20Z,"Most likely crack involved adding something, not just cutting out the DRM code, so its not so simple as you think. And all antiviruses are so paranoid that they think every keygen is a trojan.... Not to mention Kaspersky thiks half of my games (especially old ones) are keyloggers =)"
[T],Hyperdrive25,2011-09-18T13:10Z,"S.P.A.Z.v0.9007 PC [Hyperdrive25].exe torrent has been uploaded. So I recommend you download this newer one instead.

Have fun gaming!  :)"
