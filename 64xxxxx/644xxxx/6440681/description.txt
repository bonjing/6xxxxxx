Notes: From Reel Master Recorded FM Broadcast (Aired by FM Tokyo 1972) FM + Audience Sources Mixed & Remastered. Acid Moon gives a much needed overhaul and re-evaluation of the March 6th show. This is the first of the six night tour and the debut of Dark Side Of The Moon in Japan. The label collects together two sources on the three discs: the audience tape of the entire show on the first two discs and the partial radio broadcast on disc three. Sigma is a remarkable upgrade over the older titles.<-(Info taken from hokafloyd.com)
