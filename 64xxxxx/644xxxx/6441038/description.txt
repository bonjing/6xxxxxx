                              Rimfrost Discography
                            ------------------------

The band was founded in the summer of 2002 by Hravn and Throllv. First they discussed to do an unserious project together but in the early fall the same year they started for real! The first songs they ever wrote was a primitive kind of black metal and the lyrics was on swedish.

Luckily they abanded that genre and moved forward to the extrem black/death metal they play today. Rimfrost had a lot of trouble finding the right bassplayer. Hravn and Throllv is the only two original members left in the band.

The three thrones are now fulfilled...

Additional Notes:
On A Journey To A Greater End, the 1st and 2nd tracks are both different versions than those same tracks on A Frozen World Unknown. As you can see, the title track of that album is almost 3 minutes longer on A Journey To A Greater End. This is also the only torrent out there where you will be able to find the Unredeemed Demons demo. There were only 10 copies of this demo ever made, so i was extraordinarily lucky to come across these tracks online. I figured i had to share.

Rimfrost plays black metal and blackened thrash metal. I have always thought that they are the equals of Immortal in every way, and i have seen other people online say the same thing. The band members are all still very young (they were 15 at the recording time of the demo), so im sure we can all expect great things from this band in the future.
