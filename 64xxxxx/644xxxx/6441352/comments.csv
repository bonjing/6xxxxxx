,Gh057man,2011-06-03T04:37Z,@Scorpwanna. Maybe its carrying a virus ... ooooh! :)
,Leonidas123,2011-06-04T16:58Z,eztv you can trust more than your wife :)
[T],scuba-doo,2011-06-06T00:13Z,"pretty sure Gh057man was joking...

the extra 200mb is maybe because this is an HD rip..."
,TheGreatBunghole,2011-06-07T08:42Z,"I am pretty sure that it is a different size because the handle (name) in the torrent before [eztv] may be different, hence- eztv doesn't do the ripping from tv to .avi or mkv, or mpg or watever... he/she is just an uploader who happens to know the best people in the business (I am only guessing) ... seems obvious enough right? The names in the title before eztv change with almost everything eztv uploads, but I love every single thing on here! & You are right, EZTV wouldn't ever have a virus in their torrents :D (but I use linux, so I don't care)"
