,andrewwk619,2011-06-09T21:33Z,"works really great !! no problems with audio or resolution :D but dont you think u could just keep the size the way they are ... u do see a bit of quality loss ... not that its horrible quality all of a sudden ... but i wouldnt mind downloading ur files that work great when they're 8 to 13 gig ... dont we downloaders all have a hard drive ;) 

anyways thank you so much !!! you're really helping me out with this ... and i bet lots of others ...

what is the program called u use 2 convert the audio ??"
[V],r3dcat,2011-06-11T12:34Z,I can recommend Xilisoft Video Convert Ultimate 6 for converting any files. The only SBS files I have had to use something else for were a few that had TrueHD audio which I had to use Clown BD (eac3to) to convert. If you have a problem getting a working reg/crack for Xilisoft Video Convert Ultimate 6 download and use a portable version which is what I had to do cause I found the reg/crack for normal install did not work after upgrading.

,nishanta_07,2011-06-14T09:10Z,can't this be seen in a red blue 3d??
,aholmes,2011-06-30T00:53Z,"@toon1906 Are you plugging the usb directly into the tv, or do you have one of the samsung blu ray players? Although I haven't tried this film yet, others uploaded by r3dcat (thanks a lot!) work perfectly through a usb connected to my blu ray player."
,MJS1973,2011-08-17T00:20Z,"Hi,

I just bought an LG 55LW650S and downloaded some 3d movies to try them out. I play them from my Popcorn Hour A-110 which is connected via HDMI cable.
I also found out that some movies just don't play.
I also downloaded this one, the video plays fine, but the sound is distorted, even though it is AC3.
I have the same problem with some other 3d movies of which the sound is distorted but the picture looks OK."
,6daniels,2011-08-26T21:45Z,Thanks! For everyone who has a 3D tv and gets the error you have to convert the video on your computer. I recommend using anyvideo converter. Convert the .mkv file to .mp4 that way you can even burn the .mp4 file on to a dvd and play it on your tv just make sure to put your tv into side by side mode. 
,haz911,2011-09-10T03:01Z,thank you so much for the movie can u please upload the green hornet 3d and jackass 3d (any but both if possible)

,howyeman,2012-01-27T23:12Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
,iliasbo,2012-03-02T02:47Z,@howyeman i downloaded it but it keeps has this problem. my lg tv doesnt support this file. what can i do? someone help please. thanks
