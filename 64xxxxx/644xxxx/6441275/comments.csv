,netkai,2011-06-02T05:02Z,You can't just upload it and not seed...
,2toast,2011-06-02T15:41Z,"The video locked up twice while playing. Skipping past the lock lets the video keep playing.

Is the video broken or is it just me?"
,GoldenScorpion666,2011-06-02T16:10Z,This video does freeze up at 12:38. Moving past that point did not fix it for me. Uploader needs to fix or replace this torrent.
,stiilin,2011-06-02T16:11Z,"yeah it locks up alright, around 12.30"
,stiilin,2011-06-02T16:24Z,and again at 18.20 hate to say it but this is a rearry shitty rerease lol
,Brenry,2011-06-02T17:00Z,"Downloaded this release here because another member torrent site complained about the glitches.  Getting same deal with this copy.

,tibalt,2011-06-02T17:03Z,"unrar'd version here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6443061

sorry guyz, not fixed, just unpacked"
,johnniebrasco,2011-06-02T20:21Z,"Thanks sceneline! I just checked the the file, and i did not have those glitches, at least not at the same times. I'm using mpc + coreavc, maybe it's a player/codec issue?"
,OsakaHugger,2011-06-02T22:22Z,This was a bad release.
