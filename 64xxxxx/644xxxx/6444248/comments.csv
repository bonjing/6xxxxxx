,hkoraddi,2011-06-03T08:42Z,would there be smaller encoding of this?
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-03T08:45Z,"As written:
"" ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).
             WATCH from 6-8 ft. distance at low-res settings of display. 
             Free physics lesson: quarks are leptons. ""

Basically, free format, no strict targets, smallest footprint possible, sound can be mono (here's not), could be downscaled or upscaled - and - MUST be watched as instructed.

[quark] is around for long time."
