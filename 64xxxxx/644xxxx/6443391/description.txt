In contrast to the large arrangement of musicians on Windemo's Water Story, we are here able to hear the amplified version of what Windemo and Svantesson can accomplish as a twosome. All music and text are written by the two and though most of the CD is played solely by them, contributions by both Joakim Milder and Andre Ferrari can be heard at time.
