Here is the original World of Warcraft with The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, And CATACLYSM Expansions. In order to play you will need to find a private server, make an account and use their launcher or edit the realmlist.WTF file in you wow installation Directory. 

MAKE SURE WHEN YOU LOG IN YOU USE THE USERNAME YOU SIGNED UP FOR THE SERVER WITH AND NOT THE EMAIL ADDRESS!!! If you do you will get an error every time. 
You may need to patch the game, you may not. Sorry It depends on the server

I know it is a big file but hey, it is free download it in segments. They are all in .ISO format so just mount and install.
