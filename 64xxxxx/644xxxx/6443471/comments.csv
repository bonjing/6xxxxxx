,Savvok,2011-06-04T04:23Z,Oh and Please help me seed this.Thanks
,Pokorenou,2011-06-26T11:01Z,Hi where I do sign????
,Savvok,2011-06-26T15:12Z,"You have to make an account with the private server, then when you start wow.exe sign in with the username and password you used on the site/ I am playing on eternal wow. here is a link: http://eternal-wow.com/server/guide/"
,pirateregina,2011-06-28T21:56Z,I was downloading 900kb/s until about 5mins ago now it's 44kb/s -_-. Stop slowing me down! D; or SEED
,Savvok,2011-07-03T04:36Z,"I have been downloading as fast as I can, please bear with me. Thank you."
,Savvok,2011-07-20T19:21Z,"here is a new, up and coming, server. not many people on it but I figured I would advertise it anyway. they need more people so why not try it guys?  http://www.wowmaniak.com/connection-guide.html"
,xidio,2011-07-24T05:07Z,Savvok you're a dumbass. Trial client has everything retail does.
,Savvok,2011-07-24T06:12Z,"okay, trial is just that trial. it has an end point, then you get cut off and if you want to play you have to pay. this bypasses all that. so actually you are the dumbass, and it is funny how both people talking shit have not posted a single torrent. you have no right to even comment, so stop talking shit and learn to share. back off!!"
,stevieb,2011-08-06T04:06Z,nice 1! thanx !! :D
,Savvok,2011-08-06T21:12Z,Your welcome!
,RyanRed,2011-08-10T21:59Z,Woot! Savvok FTW!
,dfett18,2011-08-17T20:10Z,does this work for macs?
,dfett18,2011-08-17T20:11Z,savvok will you send me details on how to run everything?
,Savvok,2011-08-19T09:54Z,@dfett18 what details do you need?
,mahyaz96,2011-08-27T00:42Z,"Savvok,i think they mean the starter edition that comes with the current trial.instead of 10 days,it is not untill you get to level 20.then it ends.I think you can use that to play on a private server."
,Savvok,2011-08-27T04:51Z,"@Mahyaz- Even if that is the case, why come to a torrent and start calling names, and why not notify the uploader of the situation with a thank you for trying at the end? When I read things like some of the above posts, I assume the individual is either trolling, or just trying to start trouble. I believe in respect. you respect me I respect you. thank you for not being an asshole about it though. :) "
,mahyaz96,2011-08-27T15:02Z,What version is this?
,mahyaz96,2011-08-27T22:22Z,"OK,so you can indeed use the trial version to play on private servers,but you have to check what version is and check with the server if you can use that version,so you should download from the official site using a trial account unless you need a specific version"
,Savvok,2011-08-27T23:03Z,"At the time I posted this torrent, the trial was a 10-day basis lol. but the point in this is that this torrent is the .iso images of the discs. So this could be used to make backups to use at a later date if you do not have the actual discs and want them."
,zephy1696,2011-09-17T21:56Z,"ok, ive downloaded it and mounted the first burning crusade iso but idk how to actually install it, when the window comes up saying play, manual, readme, and customer support. whichever one i click on it all fades then comes right back. how do i install burnung crusade?"
,zephy1696,2011-09-18T17:08Z,same thing happens when i try to install lich king too
,Savvok,2011-09-22T09:19Z,"Zephy, sounds like you have it already installed. it should say install, after install of first disc unmount, and mount second disc. try uninstalling wow all together, then re installing it."
