As of today, 2011-06-17, dofantasy, the originaters of this comics series does not list any title under number 246. Nor does a search for ""Vampire Realm"" yield anything.

,tinky23,2011-07-09T00:03Z,"Actually, this IS a Fansadox comic called Vampire Realm.  Since their website doesn't list a #246, I can only assume that they removed it from their catalog for some reason."
