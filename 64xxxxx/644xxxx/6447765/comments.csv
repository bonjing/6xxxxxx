,WOLFGANGTHOR,2011-06-06T23:07Z,"Works perfectly great! Thank you! Aalso at first i was having trouble because it kept saying it was a trial version and that I needed to buy a serial code, but by going to this directory and changing/adding this line to the hosts file made it work

and the line you need to add/change is

can i just ask: will you also be uploading CS5.5 PRODUCTION PREMIUM? (i see you've already uploaded the extra content).

If not, cool bananas, i'll just go with SUITE..."

No sir its not the commercial its the TRIAL ESD from the adobe site....the other link at the bottom you gave is the content AGAIN available on the adobe site.

The COMMERCIAL comes on 3 discs as mentioned above. AND it would ALSO contain the content.

Also the ESD (downlable version) of CSS5.5 is not available on the adobe site for a while yet...ONLY the trial..is.

Not spamming but the site (this one ) is very slow to reg the messages and hangs sometimes so hitting the send does that ...sorry.

gl and thanx for your response.

[V],thethingy,2011-06-07T10:08Z,"gbovs, all right smart ass, post the adobe link to the content, you cant cause you dont get the link till you buy it, also this is esd and only esd and it is clearly available because it's being sold, comercial is 2 dvd's the other is the 32bit support pack thats linked in the description."

,pirbay1958,2011-06-07T14:53Z,"Hi all,
This esd vs trial thing is making my head hurt,lol.Not asking thethingy since he cant be expected to answer all dumb questions but is not the esd just the downloadable version whether it be trial or otherwise?

presuming this is an esd trial version abobe states basically lacks encore (CS5 version anyway) and various after effcts plugins,codecs,and presets.It would no doubt lack functional content titles,menus,templates

Actually looking back at adobe's esd description, https://adobe.subscribenet.com/control/adbe/faqs
it appears esd is some kinds volume license thing but really its what they dont tell you that makes me curious,like some special way of ""managing"" upgrades and possibly any updates ie if not an ESD Account Administrator you cant update?

Anyway this torrent is still amazing value=free=well done thethingy!"
,averti2,2011-06-07T17:41Z,Does it include premiere pro presets ?

links below that I used and were available to all.

To clear things up ESD trial cs5.5 contains limited stuff and is missing codecs and third party plugins req for video output.

The content is the same as you have supplied EXACTLY ........

Have respect for your releases JUST dont like the BS ones. :D

1)The missing stuff in trial is specified here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6447765
relates to Encore (the CS 5.0 v) comes not working and AE missing 3rd part plugins,codecs and presets.One infers other progs are 'complete'...although
2) The 'functional content' you mentioned is the same as thethings in his separate torrent.This(when extracted) however is only over 3GB of FONTS.Where is the other content,Prmiere designer title templates and encore designer menu templates etc?
3)What is the ""genuine full CS 5.5 downladable (?also ""esd"") versions"" ? Are not the ""trial"" versions always there to trial? Are the full versions the trial versions now with the previously missing stuff added...as for paying customers who bypass the trial and buy outright?Even then it seems ""full retail versions"" of torrents in the past are still missing the 'functional content',yet again a separate dload from Adobe and only if you have access.

5)the dload of trials from adobe (to avoid dubious torrents,not relevant to thethingy's),...""make a new email"" ...do they accept yahoo or msn anonymous accounts?Somewhere I read a similar method to yours except it specified extra step something like ""click on dload but then cancel but dont close out page,then hit links (that you also listed).Presumably further covering ass?

Totally echo your respect and appreciation to thethingy,absolutely amazing job.

Hi mate
In a nutshell,  if you have lots of money you pay adobe for the CS5 MC 5.5 if not you download a trial and kegen it and it works MINUS the missing codecs etc etc.  You can download the content as I posted the links above and THEY not just Fonts but templates and presets and lots more, POSSIBLY only 10 percent is fonts..lol

NOT 3.8GB of FONTS thats for sure...

When you log on to update and adobe 'accepts' your CS5.5 MC version ie seriel number...then it automatically downloads the files you need INCLUDING content.......so you CAN do it via a trial.

When you buy it then it comes on 3 DVD (2 of which are dual layer) and its about 13 to 14 gb that you install the other 7gb is only for 32bit systems ...

At the moment ONLY the other packages ie premium and production have ESD FULL downloads available INSTEAD of TRIALS. 

Adobe in its wisdom did not allow anyone to download the FULL CS5.5 Master Collection YET.

Its TRIAL only.

I prefer to log on to the site. 
download what you want.

Adobe I mean :D

But its worth waiting a bit and the FULL package will be able to be downloaded in FULL ie NOT 6.8 but the 13-14 gb.

Up to you.

Good luck and respect flies out to the thingy.

Thanks...have been away for a week.
If understanding correctly you are saying there are 3 ways of getting the full CS5.5 MC content 
	1) Use a temp email/make an account with adobe/they email you the functioning links to downloads (or give you access to their website with the links)â€¦..presumably you would need to supply a 'valid' serial number?
	2) Separately download the trial MC version from adobe,use a keygen and hosts file to make it work,then simply log on via abode updater from within a suite program and content will download automatically (btw this method didnâ€™t work for CS5.0)
	3) Wait till adobe releases the full 13 GB CS 5.5 MC inclusive of all content as an esd (downloadable) then wait for a torrent to apear

	Is that correct?

	Cheers"

thanks mate for ALL your time and effort,I cant stress that enough!.Gbovs also expresses his admiration

The point of confusion is what if any content is missing and how to get it.Apart from fonts which you uploaded separately do we actually know if this MC 5.5 comes with prem pro codecs,presets etc and encore templates/styles etc.The other big one for me is photoshop but would appear no other special content reqired here?

At end of day its no huge deal,more a matter of knowing what is or isnt complete. I dloaded your ADOBE ENCORE CS5 CONTENT [thethingy]
Pasted from  [thanks] and it works perfectly in my W7 64 bit encore CS5.0 so should also work when added to CS5.5 5 (unlike say plugins which may be version specific)

so its just a matter of searching a bit for bibs and bobs but the hard part is not knowing what is or potentially isnt there.This has gotta be hard for you sice if you dont use all the progs you can not be expected to know.You are just passing on the best of whats available and in good faith.Cant ask more than that :-).....and you go to the trouble of being a one man tech support service,doing a better job than adobe staff,I know coz I tried them in previous paid versions of progs....which is why I am here ;-)

All the best man and keep up the good work

For me its mainly Prem pro"
,chrismalla,2011-06-19T12:04Z,"You're right, this torrent doesn't contain any functional content at all (templates, menus, buttons etc...)

The ""functional content"" doesn't come with the ESD. This is ESD.
ESD means Electronic Software Download. You can purchase a Software as a download link from Adobe.
The ESD contains all of the plugins and codecs that comes with the DVD. The trial version is missing some codecs, plugins and presets that comes from parties other than Adobe.
These missing things in the Trial version will be downloaded through an simple update as soon you put a valid serial number.

But now we don't have to worry about these missing plugins etc, because this is an ESD.

As said above, the only thins missing in the ESD is the functional content (templates, menus, buttons etc...)

These things can those, ONLY who have bought the product, download from the Adobe website. That's what is written on thier site;
""If you purchased an electronic download (ESD) from the Adobe Store, log in to your account and download any additional available content or applications for the product you purchased. You can use your Adobe ID and password to access this content for up to three years after the product is released""

This is how you get access to the additional content (functional content);

1. In a web browser, go to www.adobe.com/membership.
2. Sign in with your Adobe ID and password.
3. Click View Order History.
4. Look at the row with your order number and click Download.
5. On the download page, look at the row with the description for function content.
6. Download this content using Akamai Download Manager or Alternate Download Method. 
7. Go to the folder where you have downloaded files from the download page. For example, Desktop\Premiere.  And install. (.exe)

Again, this can only be done by those who have purchased the software.

The functional content should be on the installation disc also. It would be awesome if someone who have purchased the software could download the files and upload them somewhere.

I still think thethingy has done a great job with this. You can't get a better copy than this one. You can update it, it's safe, it's clean, it's ESD! The only thing that is missing, as mentioned, is the functional content, that probably is 15GB+, i dont know.

Now i hope that you all understand the difference between ESD and Trial and whats in it and whats missing!

I still love you thethingy! Your'e the man!"
[V],thethingy,2011-06-19T16:49Z,"pirbay1958, I dont know if there is an additional stuff other than the 32bit support pack or the content already posted, if there is and you can get the file name of it then I can get it and post it, if you search here for cs4 content & resources then you'll see all the extra stuff for cs4, mc cs4 only has fonts if I remember correctly.

,chrismalla,2011-06-20T09:27Z,"@LatinoKillz123

If you got 32bit OS, then all apps are 32bit too. 
But if you have 64bit OS, then there's 2 ""program files"" folders.

All 32bit apps are located in the one marked with ""x86"". Most apps are 32bit yet.

All 64bit apps are located in the other ""program files"" folder (marked with nothing).


Now... you go and replace each dll file in the adobe folders with eather the 32bit dll or the 64bit dll, depending on in which folder you're in, ""program files"" or ""program files (x86)""."

Thanks for explanation. Got it,this ESD MC CS 5.5 version comes complete with all codecs,presets and plugins (and presumably a functioning version of Encore) otherwise missing from Trial version.It does not contain any ""functional content"" (Many GB of predesigned menus templates,predesigned title templates,buttons etc which Adode only supplies separately with proof of purchase (which includes your ""order number"" for purchased ESD)

,burritoooooooooo,2011-06-21T23:36Z,"hey thingy great work on this torrent. 
this is my 1st post, but i've been a long time pirate bay user. 

i installed your version of the adobe master collection cs5.5 and i got everything to work except one thing. 
The dynamic link between premiere and after effects does not work when the DLLs you provided, replace the original ones. 

i've always had this same problem with other torrents and i can never figure it out. 
It simply says that i need adobe production premium to use dynamic link. 
This only happens when i am hooked up to the internet. When i am offline, it works fine. 
When i select to use a proxy server in my LAN settings under Chrome, i no longer have online access; i get the message saying Unable to connect to proxy server. 

i am a win7 user. 64-bit. 
any help is much appreciated. Thanks man"

,lif3isfr33,2011-07-27T00:32Z,"Hey, thanks thethingy. I have a question. I have Adobe CS5 Master Collection that I installed years ago. Been using it for many days with no problems. However, I decided to get CS5.5 the other day. I assumed it would update my old CS5 but, it didn't. Instead it created a new folder in programs with the new CS5.5 stuff in it. So basically now it didn't update, I now have two versions of them and can only use one of the same program at the same time. Bummer.. OK I can tolerate that. But like I do with all my cracked/patched programs I always forward time by adding four years ahead of time. So I put in the year 2018. Opened CS5.5 and it told me I had the trial even after successfully being full in 2011. I read and followed all your steps and edited host. After the prompt that CS5.5 as a trial and asked for a new serial it took none of the new generated serials from crack. So I double checked my host file and it still had :

# localhost name resolution is handled within DNS itself.
#	127.0.0.1       localhost
#	::1             localhost
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

So I read your instructions again and decided to take another route. I replaced all the DLLs you put in one folder. Now after replacing the DLLs with the cracked ones when I open any programs in Adobe CS5.5 it crashes. I really don't know what to do anymore. Seems to me that the serial only last for a certain of time. And testing it by changing the year it proves it brakes down. 

HOWEVER, CS5 that is still on my computer works flawlessly. Every program in CS5 works like a charm even after going to the year 2018. 

Any help?"

2. Do i need to block the apps with a firewall?

3. I've run the apps and they seem to work fine without license errors... do i still need to replace the cracked dlls with the original ones?

I hope you or someone can help!
Thanks alot again!"
,lif3isfr33,2011-07-31T22:32Z,"@Urenotasgood I'm not speaking for thethingy since he is more smart than I am. You can take my advice if you like. (Excuse my ignorance if wrong.)

1. Not OK. If thethingy gave specific instructions you need to follow them exactly. Many people here fail cause they don't read and follow instructions in the txt file. 

2. Block every program you crack unless its retail or cracked. Serials are vulnerable when going online. You have to block them from connecting to the internet. 

3. If you don't get errors, its OK to leave it as it is. I believe the txt file said that if you run into trouble you can always replace the dlls in and out with the new ones or the original. Its for backup.

4. Follow the instructions.

Also, I know I haven't gotten a response to my q in page 4. But, for those of you who are happy with this torr, good. FYI, it expires in a few months. Whatever you do, it will ask for new serial. I personally hate that. So I'm going to wait for a more deep cracked version of CS5.5 or maybe wait til CS6. I'm rolling back to CS5. It seems that Adobe has learned their lessons from crackers. I'm rolling back CS5. Hopefully some other crack that fully activates it comes out. 

Those who don't believe me, just move up a year or two. I went to 2018 and went back and got trial mode. 
**DON'T DO IT, I'M JUST SAYING.**

Anyways, thanks thethingy. Great upload."

Also, @Urenotasgood, you should always follow the instructions piece by piece and double-check each step that you are on. If you do not follow these instructions to the very letter then there is a good chance that the programs may not be activated/may not work properly. If you fail the first time you can always try again though, so trial and error buddy!

1: your av or other security software has changed your hosts

2: you are using a proxy

3: you haven't set your hosts properly.

4: you haven't read the instructions properly and put dll files in the wrong place.

understand that keygens that pactcch the hosts dont do it properly and know that there are many kinds of hosts and dll files, the hosts and dll files in my torrents work and I dont support others torrents so I cant help you if you have used another on or if you have the trial from Adobe themselves, the software here is esd not trial and this works just fine if you follow the instructions.

Dont strat messing with system dates and such as that will mess up the activation.

,misteryam,2011-08-03T05:28Z,"As usual, thethingy, you have come to the rescue!  Thanks for the detailed walkthru and all the work put in!

That said: One of the caveats of the .DLL method of cracking is that it leaves the software in trial mode, but circumvents the activation, the result being that Premiere Pro does not have any (real) HD presets enabled (there may be other caveats with other CS5.5 progs).  Any further wisdom for us here?  I can't open any of my previous projects until those presets come up working!

I fixed the hosts file just fine, but none of the serials work, so I can't serialize it normally, so have to fall back on the DLL method.  I'll try updating via download and see if that helps..."

,misteryam,2011-08-03T06:42Z,"Ok, after trolling thru the comments, i'm having the same issue.  I even refreshed the DLLs so I'd get the trial/serial request again, rolled the clock back, fed in the *now working serial (the date rollback worked for that), but the progs wouldn't run after the initial request for an Adobe ID.  So, I re-replaced the fixed DLLs and it works like a charm - EXCEPT for the fact that I have to set my clock back.  I know my hosts file is fixed properly. I think they [Adobe] have developed a way to trial-limit some serials according to date (?).  It seems only a matter of time before someone as knowledgeable as thethingy comes up with a solution.  To date it seems that the only person like that is ... thethingy

Good Luck!  You have all our support.  Pouring on more of the gratitude I have for you seems like overkill after all the comments I've seen here, but do know that I have it"

You want to replace that with the one in the download. OK recap. You install win 7, you got a host file. Save it with a new name like, hostOG (host original h4x0r) [save as} now you paste the host file you downloaded here into the host file on yer puter. Save as host. Now yer puter will look at the thing it is looking for (host) and say, yo, this sh*t is blacklisted, Ima ignore them be-actches. OK, that was a little street, I faked it.

anyone else with this torrent then know that the dll files work & the hosts works but the serials appear to be grace serials for cs5 to cs5.5 so start the trial and I'll post cs5.5 serials shortly.

if you want you can use the individual app serials as they work fine and you get them from the tutorials section of the forum.

i downloaded the flash builder for php tried to install it but it didn't work but i think that's cos I'm 64bit or its cos I'm running 2 other versions of flash builder
anyway i took the serial number for this stand alone software and tried it in my flash builder cs5.5 master collection version and the 30 day count down went away all good
whilst im here ""theThingy"" is there any chance you could find Flash Builder 4.5 for PHP Premium edition and please keep them Lynda.com stuff coming.
theThingy you are a god to us poor people i would have no chance in this world if it wasn't for you, Have you ever thought of creating a Pdf on how you go about all your tips and trick and how to do the things you do that none of us can?

Thanks for the upload - I downloaded it a month or so ago and it has been working perfectly.
Yesterday though I was on a cable connection and Acrobat asked for a serial number.
As the hosts were already set up I followed your instructions for replacing the .dll files.
All programs in the suite still work apart from Acrobat.  It will open but then asks to be reinstalled as some components are missing or damage.  
What have I done wrong and more importantly - how do I go about fixing it?

Someone please help out. I've uninstalled and re installed this thing so many times my head hurts. Every time, I either get the prompt to start my 30 day trial or everything works except adobe pro which is something I need the most.

I renamed my hostfile as back up. I used the hostfile given. I did the CMD prompt thing. I rebooted, checked the host file, installed. All while off the internet. I only install photoshop, illustrator, dreamweaver, indesign, and pro X. After install I reboot with the internet connected and I get hit with the 30 day trial. If I use the DLL files instead adobe X pro doesn't work. Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? This sucks so bad. I know its something I'm doing and I have no idea what."

The keys are invalid for me as well, just use the .dll swap listed under method 2 and register as a trial. The .dll swap worked for me and hasn't prompted me for a serial key."

So I just did the best thing I could. I installed with internet off and then I blocked all connections adobe updater makes with my firewall on my anti virus. Works perfect now.

Overall I would give this a 7/10.
If I knew what I was doing with the host file thing I probably would have given this a 10/10 but I tried it 10 different ways nothing worked. Thanks thingy. "

Anyone who doesn't know it yet this CS5.5 will expire in a few weeks/months no matter what. So enjoy your time now. And for me, entering new serials here and there is annoying. For CS5 its permanent.

,Catalynn,2011-11-27T07:37Z,"I only wanted to upgrade the Acrobat from 9.4 to 10, but since I was not able to properly deactivate it from the CS5, I ended up installing the whole CS5.5 The install was a breeze, everything works flawlessly. If you did not figure it out already, there are 2 files in the torrent, it is a split, 2 part, self-extract RAR archive. You need BOTH files, in orders to extract all the files properly, just press on the .exe file.

For anybody that wants to upgrade from CS5 to CS5.5 those are the steps I took (Windows7x64 Ultimate):

1)	Edited the hosts file as instructed, adding additional lines of blocks. I should mention that since I had the CS5 installed, the hosts file had 127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com blocked already, just added below the other sites provided by TheThingy.
2)	Tried to just run the setup file, hoping that will detect the existing software and removed it, but after about 5 minutes the install crashed with an Error7.
3)	Went to Control Panel â€“ Programs and Features and uninstalled the portion of CS5.5 installed at step 2, then CS5, next the X64 patch for Acrobat 9 and lastly the Acrobat 9.4. After removing Acrobat I was asked to restart the computer.
4)	After restart, I went to the setup file in the Software folder and run it as administrator.
5)	When asked for the serial # I used the XForce Keygen to create one instead of using the ones provided by TheThingy. They probably work, but I figured since they were exposed may get blocked eventually.
6)	When everything got installed I restarted the computer, however I was not asked to.
7)	After restart I opened Photoshop x64 and run the Updates (under Help) to bring all the apps (except Acrobat) to the latest versions. 
8)	Opened Acrobat (10.0.0), and run the Updates as well. The update failed a couple of times due to some writing permissions of some temp files. Located the upgrade patch file in the folder C:\ProgramData\Adobe\ARM\Acrobat_10.0.0 and installed it manually. I got the same type of writing errors I was getting from the updater, but a simple â€œretryâ€ every time I was prompted did the job (the updater was rolling back all the changes every time there was an error, no option to â€œignoreâ€ or â€œretryâ€). After the patch is installed you will have the latest version of Acrobat (10.1.1)
9)	Restart and installed the 3-rd party plugins for the Acrobat. Also activated Color Finesse 3 under After Effects. Prompted to enter a name and organization, no serial number needed.

TheThingy provided you with way more information than needed, just in case you may run into additional problems. If you follow the instructions, all you really need is to edit the hosts file and a valid key.

I hope this helps, and last but not least THANKS TheThingy for this awesome post!"

Copy DLL to all proper folders (Each Adobe Program must have a DLL file copied to its Program folder)

After all DLLs are copied, Run PHOTOSHOP

,leelocka,2012-01-12T23:47Z,"Hi, pretty much a noob, but I've been downloading and hacking Photoshop since it was 7.0; and i cannot figure this one out.  but this is the most hosted torrent and looks like the most legit one (ive got most of the UL's out there).  Someone help plzz....

First problem: First off, in your IMPORTANT SO READ FIRST FILE:  found the LAN settings button under the connections tab in internet options (another question, do these steps have to be done for all browsers; or is the internet options one place that is just accessed through each browser?) Anyway in LAN settings  1. Do I uncheck 'automatically detect settings' 2. Under the ""proxy server"" box, my ""address"" box is blank, is there supposed to be something here? the ""Port""  blank says 80, is this correct? 3. ""Bypass proxy for local..."" is checked; under ""Advanced"" are all the ""Address"" and ""Port"" blanks under ""Servers"" box supposed to be blank?  Under the ""Exceptions"" box, in the text field ""*.local"" is entered.  I entered 127.0.0.1 after a semicolon so it looks like this: ""*.local; 127.0.0.1""  When i click ""OK"" it says the proxy server blanks are empty and that this prevents internet access? Whats going on? 

Second problem: The hosts file.  I watched the video.  In the video you just add activate.adobe.com after ""#    ::1     localhost"" in the hosts file.  The written instructions say to add all the text that is in the""hosts.txt"" in the ""HOSTS SETUP"" folder of the DL.  Do I add both?  Could you paste text of what the correct hosts file looks like?  I am so confused, I know Im just missing some minor details.

Also, When I click the ""Set-Up"" application.  Do i install with serials? (they weren't working, tried a few, it IDed the serials as ""not correct serials"" immediately after pasting....) Or just install trail then other steps.?"

I do have a question however, and its in regards to Adobe Acrobat X Pro. The file size is 2.1gb in the install checklist, which is approximately 4x as large as the downloadable trial from Adobe at around 465mb. Its the same with the other single-program torrents on the site.

,rdb9028,2012-02-21T22:40Z,what if you already have the trial downloaded? Whats the process then? I've tried all the serials i've found on here but I can't get it to work. Do I have to uninstall it?
,joao_tpb,2012-02-23T19:49Z,"Hallo girls and boys!

today: 23 feb 2012. Just passed by to show you all my gratitude! This is a great torrent quite comprehensible. After been looking for a long time to a healthy one, got this. By the moment I see 1006 seeders. Let's carry on. Thx a lot Thethingy. "
,Sit3UserX,2012-02-27T16:06Z,"Hello, is this multilingual or English only? "
,aafz02,2012-03-06T20:54Z,"People having problems with some apps not working? I had the same issue, here's what worked for me...

I downloaded this torrent and only half the apps worked, so I uninstalled everything, downloaded the entire trial version again from Adobe and reinstalled it all. I always use Revo to monitor installations so I can remove it properly. 

The trial from Adobe is exactly the same as the files in this torrent!!

I locked down my internet connection with my firewall so nothing was getting in or out, used the serial number in the readme file and same again, only half the apps working.

So I used Zonealarm to allow the apps to access ""localhost - 127.0.0.1"" but NOT access the internet and ALL APPS ARE WORKING!!!!"
,yo1988,2012-03-07T21:46Z,"Thank U very much thethingy for this awsome upload!!!
keep up the good work :)"
,MystiTsu,2012-03-13T19:55Z,My problem is that NONE of the serial numbers are working.  Any ideas?
,Scunthorpe,2012-03-20T21:58Z,"I just registered to leave this comment. 1 million internets for thethingy. Much appreciated!

By the way, tip: There's more to add to the hosts file if you want a full block of Adobe's spy servers. I found it at this site:

http://blog.yaronmaor.net/2010/04/howto-block-adobe-activation-using.html

Or I've posted the full list at Pastebin:

http://pastebin.com/GXX86wcg

Also, the ~6GB size is about the same as the direct download links on Pro Design Tools. I've actually had difficulty with the direct one from Adobe (always an incomplete download) and have successfully downloaded this set from thethingy. I'm seeding it now, but it probably won't be fully seeded for quite awhile (128k upload speed on DSL).

But again, much appreciated; keep up the good work!"
,Azagedon,2012-03-20T22:21Z,"Thanks LHRRecon.
I would like to double that, anyone getting errors that has done the host file correctly:

Reflush dns and copy and paste ANY key but remove the ""-"" before copying!
Like this ""132510029088409417563666"""
,MikeJr84,2012-03-29T02:10Z,"Thanks man!! Your awesome!

LHRRecon.....have a question for you,new to this so hope this is not dumb or didnt look hard enough for a quick fix.
But anyway, followed your directions for install and did option 2, everything went fine but Acrobat X Pro wont work. Everything else works perfectly except for that!
Does step this step....14.c)copy the Acrobat X .dll file (amtservices.dll) from the file on 
your desktop to the folder by sep 14.b)...cause X Pro to malfunction in a way to allow the rest to work? Guessing that downloading and installing just X pro would not work, have a good 9 pro version that i could install, but would that conflict...?
Any ideas would be appreciated!!"

Installed on one computer without success but did not give up and installed successfully in another laptop I had. Got a little bit of info from everyone that posted. Followed instructions. 

1.Turn off internet and disable antivirus

2. Install trial.

3. Follow ""host"" video and do EXACTLY as the guy in the video instructs. 

4. Copy ""dll"" into every application in Creative Suite folders.

5. Reboot

6. Open Photoshop. 

7. Have fun

I did not have to use method 2 and install serials. Do not know if that is a good or bad thing but seems to be working so far. Thanks again thethingy.
