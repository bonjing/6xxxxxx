,pickled_egg,2011-06-03T03:37Z,"Wrong Section.
540p is Not HD but actually slightly lower quality than standard DVD's
I have a 20 year old TV that can display more pixels at 800x600

Nothing under 720p is High Definition"
[T],fachman,2011-06-03T07:08Z,"I told you once before. Section says High Resolution, not High Definition and 960x540 is higher resolution than yours 800x600 or SD 720x480...Get it?"

,pickled_egg,2011-06-04T20:39Z,By your reasoning we can upload standard DVD's here as they are higher resolution than standard TV signals
[T],fachman,2011-06-05T09:05Z,"pickled_egg: SD Television broadcast is the analogue one, so using the term of resolution there is not quite correct but we assume its 720x480 for NTSC and 720x576 for PAL signals ie. the same like for DVD.
SaM: thanx for good words. I think you are doing so good work there you do not need any help :-)"
,b-enterprise,2011-06-05T12:39Z,Not so good
,pickled_egg,2011-06-07T01:49Z,"SD is just standard definition as apposed to HD which is High Definition.
My sky box is Digital but outputs SD.
My PC has an analogue monitor but is HD
My DVD player is Digital but out puts SD

SD & HD have nothing to do with analogue or digital. They are references to Definition which is the same as Resolution
High Definition is the same as High Resolution & we call it HD/HiDef/HiRes
Low Definition is the same as Low Resolution & we call it LowRes/SD

anything under 720p is LowRes/SD
only Resolutions over 720p are HD/HiDef/HiRes

It's so simple even a baby rocket scientist can understand it.   LOL"
[T],fachman,2011-06-07T06:58Z,"I really wonder do you even think before writing something. You are trying and trying set your ""understanding"" of SD as the common understanding, while you do not even bother to check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard-definition_television

I repeat is once more. SD does not mean ""anything lower than 720p"", but only two display resolutions 720x480 or 720x576!!!!
HD from the other case starts from 720p by definition.
540p is something in between. Not quite HD, but definitelly higher resolution than SD. 
So yes you would have right if the section would be for HD, but because the section says High Resolution YOU ARE NOT RIGHT!!!! End of disscussion..."

[T],FrodooBagginz,2011-06-10T01:04Z,"I think 480p and up until 720p is ""enhanced definition""

and for all you Dbags whining about how its not HD.
learn to wiki stuff. 480p=enhanced definition. anything higher than that is considered high definition. theres only one ""enhanced definition.""
and nearly limitless ""high-definitions"".  
duh. lol"
