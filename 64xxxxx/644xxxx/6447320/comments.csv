,junkmail8888,2011-06-17T15:04Z,"Mr. 80zforever, thank you for your hard work in cataloging these treasures.  Ever since a friend pointed out your posts, I've been buying much of the music you list in your torrents.  (For personal reasons, I can never avail myself of ""free music."")

Some of the albums, I simply cannot find in UK or US stores.  Would you be willing to recommend on-line shops to look for such material, preferably places that respect the music enough to categorize it effectively?

Thank you, either way.  Without these lists, I would not have a reasonable taxonomy for the music I enjoyed as a young adult."
[V],80zforever,2011-06-18T10:03Z,"junkmail8888, since you're probably new here, let me give you some info about what i post. I normally post music which is out of print and very hard or impossible to find. You simply can not buy these records even if you wanted to as they were either never released on CD, or if they were, they are very expensive to get. I sometime post music that can be bought on Amazon etc, the reason is that I want the band be promoted and advertised so that people can go ahead get the rest of their catalogue. Otherwise I never post music that can be bought cheaply and easily. If a CD can be had for a buck or two, I won't post it. Anyhow I hope my torrents are a comprehensive source of reference for you and the other and this is why I have been psoting music for years here, but man you simply can not buy most of them, they are just so out of print etc. cheers"
