This DLC Pack AUTOMATICALLY installs patch and crack 1.03
---------------------------------------------------------

Crack has been modified to provide access to bonus items.



Readme:

-------


Ok, this is a repack of all existing Dragon Age 2 DLCs. It contains:


- Black Emporium
- Mage Item Pack
- Pre-Order Bonus Items
- Ring of Whispers
- Rogue Item Pack
- Signature Edition Items
- The Antivan Garrote
- The Exiled Prince
- Warrior Item Pack


Everything that's not in this list is included too, so don't ask - yes, it's there.



IMPORTANT NOTES (yes, important, so read):


* Everything is cracked for you, you only need to press "Install";

* You may (depending on an Act you are playing) need to access your Special Deliveries chest twice in order to obtain Signature Edition and Pre-Order Bonus Items. Which means that you will need to exit the house, and return again;

* In order to have the Mabari war hound in your party, you need to open the character's ability tree, and drag the Summon Mabari icon to your on-screen ability quick-access list.

* Installing a new patch or a different crack WILL disable DLC bonus items, because accessing them requires hacking "DragonAge2.exe" file, and as you know, patches and cracks replace this file.

The usual warning: Comodo, ClamAV, and probably Avira may detect any and all my installers as viruses. I don't know why, and I don't care. There are no 
viruses, and have never been any.


P.S. I did not inclide a patch 1.03 changelog because it's a very long one. Google it.
