Thanks, once again, illiria! I got your page on bookmark lol."
,d0000h,2011-06-06T09:25Z,"Well done, works as advertised. (And what timing for 1.03, I just sat down to start a second run through the game tonight)"
,o_cyanide_o,2011-06-06T11:44Z,"I think a Pink Skull should be in order.
Thanks bro."
,inscythe,2011-06-06T16:23Z,thanks illiria! how did you get the unlocker for the .exe file? i would rather get that than redownloading the entire thing again... would you mind sharing the unlockable patch too? my ISP throttles for torrent... sigh
,melloyello33,2011-06-06T16:26Z,"Thanks, Illiria!

I got your page bookmarked too, just for the record :)"
,illiria,2011-06-07T02:48Z,"@ all

Thank you very much for your support, I'm glad to see the work is appreciated. :) And thanks for bookmarking. Although I don't release most of my projects, due to all the hassle writing long Readme for each.

@ inscythe

I didn't think I'd need the patch again, so I've deleted it after I finished with the repack, but I don't know where to get it - it was sent over to me. All I remember is that it's that ""patchda2forunlockables.exe"" patch, and it is version 1.03. I'm very sorry that I can't be of more help. :("
,gambit51,2011-06-07T10:22Z,thanks again friend thanks for doing it and sharing
,inscythe,2011-06-07T14:34Z,"@illiria

ugh... nvm... thanks for informing anyway. I guess I'll have to get this slowly..."
,athanh8807,2011-06-07T16:14Z,"Thank you, I love you ! :-* "
,Biopass,2011-06-07T22:35Z,"@inscythe

this is only 79mb.. we're lucky we got the patch up with dlc this fast. id be happy its there."
,zasadar,2011-06-08T05:09Z,Thank you.
,inscythe,2011-06-08T14:52Z,"@Biopass

Well, true... It took me about a whole afternoon to get; damn slow. But another reason why I asked for the unlocker is that in case of future updates, there is a chance that the unlocker will work (just like between v1.00 to v1.02).

@illiria: you are so lucky... lol... on the off chance, maybe you can contact the person to send it again to you?"
,illiria,2011-06-09T03:27Z,"@ inscythe

*Sigh* I didn't want to get into this, but since you're asking, I guess I have to reply:

I was told that it is not for public release. Once the creator(s) decide(s) to release it for public, they will. Maybe they have decided to keep it for their site, maybe postpone the public release, I don't know. I was just told not to share it. Use for my release - yes. Share the original - no. I can't tell you more because I myself don't know any more. Let's just be grateful for what we've got, because if I disrespect that request, we may never get 1.04 at all."
,morgul69,2011-06-09T08:55Z,"once again, ty fellow ;3"
,inscythe,2011-06-09T15:42Z,"@illiria

I apologize for bringing it up again. I am really thankful for your sharing it too. I can understand that some of these non-scene hackers are often doing this for hobby; hence, they reserve the right to keep whatever their work in their own discretion and whether I like it or not, I have to respect their decision.

Again, thanks for informing us anyway... ;P"
,shipz2640,2011-06-09T16:44Z,"Thanks a bunch illiria! I've been waiting for this pack for quite some time now as your packs are much easier to install than the other DLC packs, plus it contains the 1.03 patch and crack, which is a plus. Means less work for me. :)"
,silencesummer,2011-06-10T09:30Z,"Yes yes yes!! This was perfect! I was mostly looking for the 1.03 patch, since the game was waaaaay to dark, and I didn't want to have to mess with the config then keep messing with changing the setting in game every time, but getting the DLC along with it was a nice bonus.

This installed incredibly easily, I had the Reloaded crack, didn't have to move, copy, or anything, just run the file, and all is taken care of. "
,spunky_fuffy,2011-06-11T17:26Z,You are AWESOME! :D
,danilo86,2011-06-12T15:17Z,"Thanks man.

,lvcifer,2011-07-06T19:24Z,"Hmm, so I downloaded the previous DLC from illiria with the patch v1.02, but when I go to install this one, Windows says that it hadn't been installed correctly.  I check the game, and it still remains at the same patch version and only 3 DLCs, which are The Exiled Prince, Black Emporium, and Signature Edition Items.

Help would be very much appreciated.  And thanks illiria for the DLC pack!"
,Zarkow,2011-07-11T19:22Z,Thanks a lot for this.
,Paperkut,2011-07-17T18:15Z,"illiria, will do an .exe like this for the new coming Dragon Age 2 DLC Legacy?"

,conorvor,2011-07-18T21:28Z,"hey so im kinda new to all this... whenever i try to open stuff up it says it cant start ""because physxcooking.dll is missing from your computer"" and there seems to be no installing options i can see :s (this is for just the original dragon age II game) also i think the problem MIGHT be running patch.exe , and idk if this is included in the same part of this torrent but i just want it to WORK :P lol, but ya, when i run patch.exe nothing really happens..."
,The_UnKn0wN,2011-07-22T16:04Z,When I install the 1.03 patch with All the DLC;s in it it says I have 2 activate the game... What do I do?

,Preddy,2011-07-26T21:00Z,"We are waiting Legacy from you.
Thank you for your efforts man."
,athanh8807,2011-07-27T05:19Z,"The Legacy DLC was released :>
Can you continue this work...:"">"
,athanh8807,2011-07-27T05:21Z,"Cracks may have to wait......:(
(sorry for my bad english)"
,athanh8807,2011-07-27T05:24Z,"The Legacy DLC was released :>
Can you continue this work....:"">
Cracks may have to wait :(
(sorry for my bad english)"
,illiria,2011-07-27T09:58Z,"I see questions about ""Legacy"" are coming along. I can't say anything about it yet - I haven't seen it. It seems to be more of an add-on than a DLC however, so I'm not sure what structure will it have. What I will do and whether I will do anything at all depends on the release. It may not the same protection and structure as other DLCs.

@ conorvor

Sorry for a very delayed reply. Install NVIDIA PhysX, you seem to be missing some of its files.

@ lvcifer

If Windows says that the pack has not been installed properly it is very likely a problem with Windows. Windows shouldn't even *know* whether it installs successfully or not. If it pops up a message, it means it tries to tamper with the installation somehow. You might wanna try to disable Windows in-built protection such as UAC or whatever. I don't use Vista/7, can't tell for sure."
,PATD1213,2011-07-27T20:08Z,"When did the class packs (warrior, rogue, mage) get released?  I haven't played DA2 since it came out, but I know I have some of these DLCs but not sure if I have those packs.  If they were released after March then I don't have them.

If that's the case SEEED PLEASE! :D"
,adnan4ot0,2011-07-29T14:51Z,illiria - you looked at the new dlc already ? I'm playing it now and a pack with all dlc's and legacy will be great :)
,Gus15,2011-08-04T01:40Z,"Thank you so much illiria! It works almost perfectly!
I just have one bug - all of the characters' hairs are kinda... Transparent. |:
I don't know if it's from this release or from the mods I have here, but I only noticed it after patching. Going to patch again and see what happens, thank you very much for this. :3"
,Gus15,2011-08-04T02:01Z,"Oh, nevermind! Just downloaded another mod and it solved my issue.
Once again, thank you illiria, this was a game saving pack. ;)"
,DAOfan,2011-08-23T22:52Z,"Hello everyone, i just installed this dlc, but when i install de hires texture pack from Bioware the portraits textures and health/stamina/mana Bars are messed, what can this be?, cause if i install only the hires texture pack all works fine, thanks in advance for answers and posibble solutions"
,dstepperz,2011-09-02T23:00Z,The game stops working right after bioware comes up on the intro. Please help
