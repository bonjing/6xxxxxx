[DESCRIPTION.]:
Episode 4 - Mammoth Machines

Two teams of movers race against the clock to relocate a
submarine attack aircraft from Canada to America inside the
worlds biggest cargo plane, and a huge snowplough
locomotive up a mountain.

British Pilot Harry Odone returns to Goose Bay airbase,
Canada to rescue a Fairey Gannet Submarine Attack he had
to abandon here five years ago when its engines failed. Harry
needs to transport the vintage British Royal Navy plane
2,500km on a jumbo journey to New Richmond Airport,
Wisconsin where it will be restored to working condition.

This edition follows the team race against time to lift and load
the aircraft into the worlds largest operating cargo aircraft on
earth, the Antonov-124, to fly it to America.

In Oregon, we also follow leading heavy hauler Chris
Arsenault attempt to transport a 70-year old snowplough
locomotive up Train Mountain to a hillside throne.Moving the
120-ton historic hulk up the super-steep terrain and along
narrow roads is a huge challenge.

Will both mammoth machines survive the perilous journeys to
their new homes?
