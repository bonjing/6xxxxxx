Why do you only occasionally have bill maher's overtime? I always miss it. I know it's available on the website but my connection is so slow it doesn't stream properly."
,spiritualiste,2011-06-05T15:01Z,"Thanks a lot for your constant unique piece-of-art shares...+1...
Special thanks for Chaos...
Live Long and Prosper...
Spirit..."
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-05T15:30Z,"LOL!!! TPB servers may go down again...
uploaders are doing overtime..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-05T16:32Z,"@Yajoo: Sometimes I need inspiration or motive. How silly is that?

Seriously, I can't remember when somebody thanked me for Real Time - three-four times in three years is under the threshold. Regarding that, RTBM ""survived"" only because I like it. "

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-06T06:49Z,"@DownTYU: Sorry, pooped by signalgirl little too much. I started to up on sceneunderground.org. Go there, registration is needed but site is great."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-06T06:59Z,"Thanks folks. As I said above I am upping now on sceneunderground.org. Go there, get user-name (please, use same one or similar in order to be recognized). It is good if TPB upload goes down again.

Frapper101 is top honcho there - so register now, he knows you all.

,Killjoy88,2011-06-06T10:51Z,"@ houruoha - i am having the same problem. My guess is you need some level of activity on the site, maybe ratio is involved. Ill paitently wait for a response from frapper101 before i start clicking any clickable thing i encounter. 

@twentyfory -  i hope the change not only makes things better for your fans, but more importantly, for you. As always thank you.  "
,abj642,2011-06-06T11:25Z,"thanks 20-40 for all your efforts(scooby doo)

,hkoraddi,2011-06-06T13:42Z,who want to find 2040 der just search H264 on top only u will get his torrents enjoy.tv pack is out.......
,abj642,2011-06-06T15:48Z,"@hkoraddi
thanks for the tip"
[T],frapper101,2011-06-06T18:02Z,"@all:
Thanks for joining in...:)
Yes you all the right...members arent allowed to check VIP profiles...that feature is a effort to keep the private space for the VIP releasers.....
The best way to get 20-40's torrent is searching
'TV.Shows.Pack' - for TV shows 
'H264' - for others
The Admins arent included in the stafflist available to the public...
You can PM me from here
http://sceneunderground.org/mailbox.php?compose&id=1264
And 20-40 from here
http://sceneunderground.org/mailbox.php?compose&id=10132
:)
I just hope this change brings in the change which was much needed and 20-40 gets what he really deserves....:D
Thank You fellow REGULARS...:)

@pulpone: 
Members arent uploaders like here (TPB)...hence you had to fill out the uploader application form...we have more than enough reasons to do that...to avoid fakes and virus shit....only trusted people are allowed to upload..so that the genuineness of the site is intact...I took care of ur status...you can upload at SU...Standard Site Procedure bud...cant help....You can reach me from the above link....:)"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-06T19:36Z,"@frapper101
I would like to upload, eventually, Americathon, Hopscotch, and several other fairly obscure movies obtained from various sources--including original gordian knot/xvid encodes--but apparently cannot due to your 2 MB/s bottom limit.  Does that mean I've got to rent a seedbox to upload to sceneunderground??"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-06T19:39Z,"'Twould, frankly be easier--and at this point in time, affordable--to mail a DVD - R to twentyforty and let him do it."
