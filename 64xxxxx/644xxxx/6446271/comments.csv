,mulder00,2011-06-07T12:24Z,"Thanks this game is getting awful reviews, would like to try it before I purchase it..since they don't put out demos anymore...ty for the torrent!

On Xbox Live they just put out the demo for Fable 3 lmao...guess they want people to buy the PC version by playing the 360 version?"

,milad1000,2011-06-17T01:12Z,I can't find BINARIESWIN32HUNTED.EXE HELP PLEASE!
,milad1000,2011-06-17T01:57Z,"CAN""T FIND  BINARIESWIN32HUNTED.EXE? 
Its probably your McCafe or other Virus detecting it as a trojan, had the same problem and deleted my McCafe and installing again. AVG did not detect this as an trojan or any harm. Thanks Kaos."
,Asyriel,2011-06-17T08:19Z,"I have yet to download this torrent, but judging from the other numerous games I have downloaded from KaOs Krew, I would suggest looking for a folder named Binaries, then Win32, then there should be a file named Hunted.exe.

Shouldn't have been that hard to figure out =P"
,Asyriel,2011-06-18T04:09Z,"I just finished downloading the torrent and installing it. Sure enough, I found HUNTED.EXE
right where I thought it would be: 

C:\Hunted.The.Demons.Forge-KaOs\BINARIES\WIN32\HUNTED.EXE

By default, it would be here:

C:\Games\Hunted.The.Demons.Forge-KaOs\BINARIES\WIN32\HUNTED.EXE

Enjoy! =]"
,halo66,2011-06-18T20:03Z,"""If You Have A AMD Cpu Install amdcpusetup.exe
