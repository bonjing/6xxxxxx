""A toxicology report has revealed that Jackass star Ryan Dunn's blood-alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit when he and a passenger died in a car crash.""

""Dunn, 34, was driving his Porsche in a 55mph area when it veered off the road, crashed into woods and burst into flames. Police have said that at the time of the accident the car may have been driven as fast as 140mph.""
(Source: BBC Motoring News )

There are so many people whose lives have been adversely affected by drink driving. Lets hope the message gets to people that drink driving is just a stupid risk that isnt worth taking.

He took someone with him. but this is why things are called accidents, even if the responsible party was a...jackass. do not get me wrong, dunn was my favorite out of the group next to knoxville and weeman. but bad decisions are bad decisions that lave the world with a little less laughter. =["

it is sad to see someone so young and full of talent expire so early in his carrear, there would have ben much more DUNN'ness to enjoy RIP dude..... but

there is NO excuse for drinking and driving.

fck all that live fast and die hard BS, u wanna kill yourself because your to ""COOL"" to take a cab, then do it ALONE, somewear were u cant hurt anyone else."

,no_name_3,2011-08-10T00:57Z,"I particularly enjoyed the comment that somebody left about how ""it will never be the same without you"" in regards to Dunn. Umm...what the fuck are you talking about? Stop acting as if he was some personal friend of yours. Things will ""be the same"" because he was a dime a dozen. I think it's hilarious to see people act as if they knew him personally and are suffering such a tragic loss for his death.
