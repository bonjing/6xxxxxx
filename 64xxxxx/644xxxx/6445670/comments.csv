Thanks anyway! :D"
,Lindane,2011-06-14T10:12Z,"@blitz2212
Why would I pay $300 for an mp3 player that I have to recharge every 6 hours?
The first Gen sounds exactly the same and lasts 5-10 days at a time."
,Shydogg82,2011-06-18T07:20Z,"I agree.  IF you have a GOOD Classic there is no reason to upgrade to a Touch.  Especially if you have an IPhone already.  

Actually, best yet, keep your touch and get a 32 Gig I Phone 4 or wait til July and get a 64 Gig I Phone 4G or whatever its gonna be called.  I can't wait for that one.  They may even go bigger than 64 Gig on the Iphone.  Read about some rumors."
,Shydogg82,2011-06-18T07:20Z,****Keep your Classic......***** Not Touch
