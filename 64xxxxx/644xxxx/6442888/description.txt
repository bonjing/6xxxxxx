This 4CD anthology on Swedish prog 1967-1979 is an excellent package in many ways. In fact, I don't know any similar attempt to give such thorough and precise picture of the prog scene of one particular country, in a particular time limit. Or if I have come across such things, surely none of them have been done so well.
It would be an interesting research to see how many of the bands-artists of this box are undeservedly not (yet) in ProgArchives. I believe there are several! Naturally many of them are very rare and have a limited output (sometimes narrowed down to a single single), but despite that fact, this box is a perfect thing for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the early Swedish prog. Which indeed has a unique character. If that uniqueness is heard already by listening to just a few classics of Swedish prog, this compilation only deepens that idea.
What's very wise of this box, these bigger acts are not given more room than the rest. The goal clearly has been to give as full picture as can be given within four discs. Any imaginable sub-genre is present, be it Psychedelia, Jazz-Rock, Symphonic, Take you pick.
Whereas most other compilations from this part of the Swedish rock era have focused on its political angle, this time we take the opposite route. ItÂ¹s time to let the music do the talking! You will be surprised how well these masterpieces have stood the test of time. Play it loud. Headphones are recommended for optimal effect and youÂ¹re in for a ride.
