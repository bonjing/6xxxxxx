,lovemeloveme88,2011-06-05T20:10Z,I waited all morning on Bones torrent. Then he shuts it down. I was at 40%. If this is fake Froggie you are officially off the best list. I always come to you or Bones. Don't let me down!!

,beton075,2011-06-05T22:45Z,"there are people walking between the cam and tv =(
it is the real full movie , a verry nice cam quality."
,Philonetic,2011-06-05T23:20Z,"@lovemeloveme88 
BONE shut down the other one because the new version is so much better.  I was at 95% when he shut it down but I'm glad because now my first view wont be of total shite.  BONE has also released a V2.

Don't stop seeding people. Fuck a copyright infringement, you aren't allowing people to copy the files from any website you own, it's bullshit. You have to be allowing people to copy whole files directly from you for infringement. Use PeerBlock with iblocklist updated lists and KEEP SEEDING!!! "

,richardpa,2011-06-06T07:43Z,"Decent TELESYNC copy and a steady download... 
V/7 
A/7 
The picture pretty decent but the chroma is pretty dark which oversaturates the picture with colour, thereâ€˜s also some flickering in the lighter scenes, thereâ€˜s English subtitles laid over Russian subs for the areas/cities that are depicted in the movie but thereâ€˜s no subtitles for the Russian language parts. The audio is a bit tinny and echoic, but does seem to keep in sync most of the time... Not a bad copy if your not wanting to wait for the DVDRip... 
Many Thanx to froggie100 and EP1C for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:) "
,martina909,2011-06-06T10:27Z,does this torrent have subtitles on like it says in the description?
