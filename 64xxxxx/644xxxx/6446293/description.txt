The highly photogenic Viktoria Tolstoy is in fact not just 'another pretty face', but actually a brilliant and sophisticated vocalist in the borderland between genuine jazz and smooth pop.
The arrangements with the acoustic piano as the dominating instrument is certainly giving the proceedings a strong jazz flavour. And not smooth jazz rather the cool Scandinavian touch is prevailing. The material ranks from contemporary Swedish composers to rather unknown tunes by the likes of Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, Prince, Stevie Wonder. 
Intelligent and highly delicious.  (Bodhi Heeren)
