,xxBATMANxx,2011-07-30T14:43Z,Holy massive torrent. Awesome collection. Thanks. Will seed for a long time.
,jmzoakley,2011-08-14T18:56Z,"Joshua, you are my hero. I will seed this forever, as long as I have it and the internet.
All comics I've read so far are excellent quality scans.
I will have to transfer the data over to another computer as I'm running out of space on my laptop hard drive, hopefully it will still work/seed ok.
LEGEND! LEGEND! LEGEND!"
,jmzoakley,2011-08-16T18:22Z,Best. Torrent. Ever.
,jmzoakley,2011-08-18T12:30Z,"I'm seeding this on 2 computers now, one of them is on 24/7. Sorry for the multiple posts, but it's not like the internet is going to run out of space!"

,oldmanpoodle,2011-09-30T11:25Z,"Holy fuck... I don't even have the space/time to download this, but you need some sort of award for this. Or at least a complementary handski from an attractive escort."
,aq20985,2011-12-07T22:50Z,"Thank you for such a great collection of comics.

I was just wondering about the first volume of Batman-Hush. I had assumed that it would be a part of your Batman A-Z collection, but, as far as I can tell, only volume 2 is there. If it's not too much trouble, could you please tell me where, in your torrents, to find the first volume?

Anyway, thanks again."
