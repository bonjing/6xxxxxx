WiBit.Net Programming in C++ (2011) - Lesson 19 - LinkedList

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The time has come to put together all of the concepts we have learned. We will create a linked list class fully equipped with all the basic functionality required to create, add, remove, and parse the list.

We talked about linked lists in our Introduction to Computer Programming course. In case you donâ€™t remember, a linked list is a form of a dynamic array. We will be able to created array items at will during the runtime flow of our programs. The list will expand and contract however we want. Using this concept is memory efficient because we will not block off memory that is not being used. So, sit back, relax, and write a linked list class with us.
