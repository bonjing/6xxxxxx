,fr_62vld,2011-06-11T18:51Z,"thanks voor deze film, toppie  "
,packings,2011-06-12T08:23Z,I hate how these days people use telesync (TS) to tag both TS's and cam's... their 2 different things... a real TS looks so much nicer than a cam :/
,maikolis,2011-06-14T17:16Z,"Don't Download this move, i did but this is in english but have some rare subtitles i think is russian or something, and also the video and sound is horrible, i don't know how this is 4gb..  :S"
,panzersiddhartha,2011-06-19T19:40Z,"Packing - Telesync only means that the sound i lined in and not mic recorded. Sure, to do this many people film and take the sound from the projector room, but not all and it is specifically about the sound. I can film something with my iPhone and put original crisp studio sound on it and it will be a telesync. (However, yes, the title TS is over used and also used for any crappy cam with cam sound.)"
,panzersiddhartha,2011-06-19T19:43Z,"And of course, TS2DVD mean Teleync (cam) To DVD. It i filmed in a cinema by drunk Dutch people and then made into a DVD writeable file.
For you who are hung up on the DVD-R = DVD Rip or DVD-ROM, read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R and relax. Most things in the Movie DVDR category are badly filmed in cinema by our Dutch heavy drinking friend. Yes, there should be a CAM/TS category, but for now you will just have to learn to read the title of things."

,Mathijs13,2011-06-30T15:38Z,TS = Cam
,exxazz,2011-07-01T20:34Z,"@NLUPPPER002:
Please stop uploading non-dvd's to the category Movies DVDR. This category is purely for ripped DVD's. 
Instead use the Category Handheld regardless of the intended use. 
The categories are for how the film was captured and not for how anyone intended to watch the movie, regardless of the good intention. 

Thanks!"
,ryogi,2011-07-09T23:42Z,NLUPPER you dumb FUCK stop STOP putting your fucking NEDERLANDS shit load of FUCK in the DVDR section
