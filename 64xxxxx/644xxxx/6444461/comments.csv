""The long and the short of it is that The Flying Dutchman just isn’t a good game. Not only is it not a good game, it’s not a game you should buy. If you have to play a hidden object game you should take your business elsewhere. If you have played the rest and still want more, might I suggest “borrowing” a copy of Highlights for Children from your dentist’s office?"""
