,UncleO,2011-08-13T07:55Z,"Wow.  Even if I turn out to want none of the books in these four ULs, I shall shout your name from the rooftops.

ooops.  What name is that?

Well, would you if you could make one of the expensive gin rummy books available?  Like Michael Sall's?  

real thanks.

(and I wonder why I can't find the non-fiction ULs I saw a couple months ago in several ULs by alphabet)"
,UncleO,2011-08-13T21:52Z,"One of these books is absolutely great.

Empires of the Word.

You like history?  Languages?  Some particular ""ethnic"" group that has ever had a written language?  

There's more of everything here from China to Europe to the Incas/Mayans/Aztecs than you could possibly have imagined aforehand.

Thanks."

,funseeker521,2012-02-09T06:51Z,"@Lynnw98 Do you really think this is your target audience? I just dl'd 200 books. That means I stole $1000 from you, dumdum."
