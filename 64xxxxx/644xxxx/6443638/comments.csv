,abhikrit,2011-06-03T06:00Z,"@ DJ

,nittany,2011-06-03T06:30Z,"LOL at DJAbi7 and SD_rocks.....bunch of idiots.

Buy a player like a WD TV Live if you can't handle DTS, fuck AC3 and AAC.

No bluray rips on piratebay?  Are you serious SD_rocks?  You must be trolling.  If you are actually serious, click on the thing that says ""Top 100"" at the top of this web page and click on highres movies.....tons of HD rips.

When you two noobs figure out torrents, switch to usenet.  Astraweb + Sabnzbd + nzbmatrix = heaven

Downloading this right now at 1.5 MB/sec.....so long torrents you've been good but you're to slow :)"
,abhikrit,2011-06-03T07:19Z,"@ SD rocks... what an ignorant prick you are... asshole... the other RIPS have the source of these kinds of bluray...only then they come out...so how the fuck will you see other rips???


btw... yes the quality of the bluray is not as awesome as it should be...but the bluray of UNKNOWN might be this way..."
,SD_rocks,2011-06-03T12:32Z,"omg u bunch of fucktards!

,maxpayne1991,2011-06-07T20:31Z,"i have one simple question can anyone help me

Why 720p movies are 1280 x 536 or 1280 x 528 e.t.c.
why are they are not 1280 x 720... 
(There are some 720p movies here in 1280 x 720 resolution)"
,morel142,2011-06-08T19:08Z,"Well converting a 20gb+ MTS file to a resonable 5-7GB torrent will result in some image quality..

 It's not called compression and re-encoding for shits and giggles guys.. lol"
,morel142,2011-06-08T19:12Z,"Also, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/720p

Read.. Learn.. or STFU :)

 If you want 100% 1080p with no loss in quality, buy the damn disk.. Download this one, then when a better quality one comes out, re-download it.. 

It's a constant upgrade of your library.. Just start the downloads before hitting the sack. 

Oy, people bitching about free stuff.."

,Gemini86,2011-06-15T21:42Z,"@morel142 & maxpayne1991

It's awesome you're helping people with questions, especially the snide remarks that go with it; and your arrogance implied by those remarks, is great.

It's just a pretty big shame you failed to answer the question that maxpayne was asking, making you the biggest noob on this comment page.

So...
@maxpayne1991
The real answer; 720p movies tend to be 1280x544 because there is no advantage to ripping the black bars on top/bottom of the movie - your monitor or TV can do that for you. The thing to look for is the 1280 resolution, that's what matters. 1280x544 is the resolution you usually get with black bars removed.

@morel
Grow up m8. And please don't troll on subjects you don't have the slightest clue about"
,everlastcro,2011-06-23T14:58Z,"@morel142 idiot it cant be 720p, aspect ratio is 2.40:1 only if u like black bars on top and bottom of the movie"
,yellowboy06,2011-06-24T03:00Z,Appreciate it....
,srockkk,2011-07-03T22:58Z,very good
,shroomblood,2011-07-05T17:26Z,Yeah its funny when noobs like morel act like they know everything and are mean about it.  You are definitely compensating for something aren't you morel?   :D
,LethalRabbit,2011-07-18T00:33Z,"AMAZING quality, thanks so much!!"
,gunturrent0shii,2011-07-31T17:45Z,"seed plz :)

,xseyss,2011-08-14T00:10Z,"great movie
lian nisson is such a bad ass"
,mcordell,2011-08-21T05:22Z,"Movie Quality: 9.2/10 (Ratio's a bit messed up, but it doesn't take away from the experience)

Audio Quality: 10/10

Movie: 6.4/10

Honestly, they could have done SO SO SO much with the plot.  The idea was terrific, but they managed to fuck it up after an hour.  The plot was incredible in the beginning, but after an hour the director got lazy and quickly transitioned the movie into 100% action with no story.  After the first hour or so, it all goes downhill.  As Liam Neeson is a complete badass his acting was amazing and so was the supporting actors' acting.

Why the fuck would they make him an assassin and just suddenly forgot everything?  It would have been so much better if he was actually Martin Harris and he actually had his identity stolen.  But no, the shitty director had to make him a different person under the code name, ""Martin Harris"" what the fuck?  Honestly, it would have been a great movie if he gets his briefcase, goes to the authorities, they detain him and his wife, and then they arrest the people responsible for switching identities with Mr. Harris.
