              Carly Marshall is the mentally unbalanced       
               wife of Hank. He's in the military and          
               responsible for monitoring atomic tests.        
               Carly's antics (she's fun loving) have         
                 forced her and the family (two daughters)       
                 to move from one military base to another.      
                At a new base in Alabama, Carly gets up to      
                her usual tricks.
