,Tainan,2011-06-06T11:50Z,"Hey - Is anyone else getting an ""Online Eurogrand Casino"" pop-up opening up when they click on this page?

Started about a week ago for me and I run some heavy duty anti-pop-up progs.(obviously not heavy enough)

Any suggestions?

Thanks JW."

Using Google Chrome."

Running K-Meleon with Adblock Plus and I still get the Casino popup.  Not as heavy as before though - ABP managed to block all the images so only the skeleton page (outline) is left, but still ... annoying."
