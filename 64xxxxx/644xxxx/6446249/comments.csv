,mediaferret,2011-07-13T20:30Z,"Yes, CD1 has two WAV files, and they are not the complete tracks. Track 8 is nearly complete; track 10 cuts off after a mere ~40 seconds.

To be fair, I have found similar issues on copies of this boxset elsewhere."
,muumtaz1,2012-03-08T17:13Z,any comment on the quality?
