I tried ur direct links and im not able download it without interruption and the worst thing i didnt resume, but starts from from first... torrents are always the best for guys like me having a night plan internet connection... Pls, do upload torrents.."

I am a big fan of all your clear films...but i am sad to notice you are more or less gravitating to direct downloads only. to be frank all your recent releases on piratebay are crappy films. it sucks because some people like me have very slow connections and so can only torrent!

PS-Biutiful..only available on direct download.... "

Like Barney's Version, the video is jerky at the beginning & in some parts of this one
(this happens on the PC & the TV)

great filesize & very watchable though"
