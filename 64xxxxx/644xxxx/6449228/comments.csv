,digrose,2011-06-06T15:06Z,"wait a second........it says ""french horror thriller"" but then the cast consists of Colin Farrell and Keira Knightly and the synopsis sounds like a rom-com??
This doesn't sound like the terrific French Horror Flick I thought it was starring Beatrice Dalle - a bit confusing.  WHICH is it? and surely 448.51MB is a little on the low side????"
