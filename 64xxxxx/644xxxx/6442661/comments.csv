,kartungg,2011-06-02T15:01Z,"Imo, when I saw the sample:

V:9
A:5 (clearly still the cam sound, it's still watchable though)

I'll wait for the version with better audio, thx for the share though razvanripper"

,BoonDockSaiNt30,2011-06-02T18:00Z,A/V= 5/9. The audio is out of sync by a few seconds which is annoying. Thanks for the attempt on the upload.
