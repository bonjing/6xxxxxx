Here are some new(ish) mixes that have been on my hard drive for a few weeks, I hope you like.

Tracks:-
alpha1999s Long Prince Mix - 9hrs of Prince and friends in a continuous mix.
alpha1999s Prince Megamix - 30 mins.
If I Was Ur Girlfriend (alpha1999remix) - Many thanks to the original remixer, I hope you like what I did to your track (sorry I can't remember your name).
Rich Friends (complete) - As far as I know this is the only version without the radio bits.
We All Wanna B Prince (alpha1999remix) - Felix Da Housecats track with more Prince than you can shake a stick at.


If you like it say thanks and seed, if not say thanks anyway.
