    In the third installment of the Photoshop CS5 Extended One-on-One

    series, author Deke McClelland shows how to build, light, and render

    realistic 3D scenes in Photoshop CS5 Extended. Providing a systematic

    approach to scene building, the course explains how to produce

    reflections and refractions, balance the interplay of light

    and shadow, and frame scenes with 3D cameras.

    Exercise files accompany the course.
