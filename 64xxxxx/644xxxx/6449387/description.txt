Innuendo, released in 1991, is Queen's fourteenth studio album and the last to be composed entirely of new material. It is also the final studio album to be released while lead singer Freddie Mercury was still alive. It reached number one on the United Kingdom album charts (2 weeks) as well as in the Netherlands (4 weeks), Switzerland (8 weeks) and Italy (3 weeks). The album was released in the United States one day after it was released in Britain. The album would be the first Queen album to go Gold in the US upon its release since The Works in 1984.

The album was recorded from early 1989 to late 1990. In August 1990, Mercury's HIV was diagnosed as having developed into AIDS, although he was keeping his illness a secret and denied countless media reports that he was seriously ill. The band and producers were aiming for a November or December release date in order to catch the crucial Christmas market, but Mercury's declining health meant that the release of the album did not take place until January 1991. Stylistically, Innuendo is in some sense a return to Queen's roots, with its harder rock sound and strong vocals from Mercury ranging over four octaves. Mercury died ten months after its release. Current estimates at the worldwide sales of the album stand at around 11 million copies.
