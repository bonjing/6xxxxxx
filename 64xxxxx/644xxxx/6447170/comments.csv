,robrub,2011-06-25T12:23Z,"Sound is too low.

I have everything maxed out and it's only good enough to watch while sitting at the desk.

Due to this, Windows alerts are very loud and become annoying."
,Progressychedelic,2011-07-03T23:40Z,"@robrub,
Sir if you are using Windows 7, you can lower the volume of Windows system alerts while the general volume is at the top.

To do this, click on the speaker icon on the notification icons area. Click on the ""Mixer"". Lower the ""System Sounds"". Here you are.

BTW, Thanks mkvGOD!"
,bowhan333,2011-07-12T23:13Z,"so... what do we mean by ""uncensored""? i know that in s01 e01 their is some brief nuditiy, and i am guessing that s01 e07 is when walt says ""F**k you, Gretchen"". am i missing anything else that woul make this ""uncensored""?"
,hatebreeder80,2011-07-16T22:19Z,"Thanks dude awesome show.

,iwkaqw902,2011-07-18T19:22Z,"45 minute episodes.. 720p.. 240mb files?

[T],Robston,2011-07-24T09:33Z,"Superb torrent. Small files with excellent quality. Nice job.

I'll seed forever.

:-)"
,theniner,2011-07-25T01:03Z,"quality good! thanks
VERY SLOW downloading 
I would avoid!"
,Athenatius,2011-07-27T20:02Z,"Great upload! Great quality! I have problems finding the right subtitles. Until now nothing goes sync.(English, French & Dutch)accept for the first season...

Does anybody have the right ones(Season 2 & 3) in En,Fre & Du?
Thanks.."
,Esmad3,2011-07-28T21:43Z,"@ Athenatius: You can modify subtitle files to sync. I use something called Subtitle Editor, don't have dl link sorry, but it is free. The task of finding subtitles (other than english) that fit the exact version you have can be a real chore without a program like this. It enables you to change the timing of subtitles down to the millisecond, and it's easy to use."
,Athenatius,2011-07-29T14:16Z,"@ Esmad3:

Thanks for your reaction! Yes I'm aware of such programs but I was hoping to find the ones already in sync. Until now I was pretty lucky finding them. So now I'm gonna follow your advice."
,Athenatius,2011-07-30T13:12Z,"I cannot succeed with Subtitle Editor/Workshop.
So if there's anybody who has synced subs of Season 2&3 in Dutch & French, I would be very happy.
I did find all the English subs..

Thanks.."
,narcronics,2011-08-07T05:54Z,Not real 720p and a couple of episodes just stop part way through. Get a real 720p HD copy of these episodes instead of wasting your time with this.
,otnemem,2011-08-15T11:06Z,Hope this becomes the new standard. MUCH better than 350MB avi/divx files.

,8o8cr4ne,2011-08-21T21:35Z,"Alright, I've watched the first episode. The quality of the rips has been lowered to achieve the enviable size. Not that that was surprising. To be honest the audio and video is really only a little worse than what you'd ordinarily get through your overtaxed cable connection.

Great upload altogether."
,hahahafr,2011-08-25T05:27Z,"A:9
V:7

Check 102DFF1AB8FFDC6EADF32606E938D64531542A35 for a real 720p, it's also the uncensored version."
,Sopkow,2011-10-10T04:13Z,"Just finished downloading.. I got the VLC media player, but all the shows are just grey blobs aside from the occasional picture.. audios fine. anyone know what im doing wrong?"
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-10-11T12:20Z,"Yay, more overly-compressed poor quality MKVs of a great TV show from ""mkvgod"", lord be praised!

Seriously though, the whole point of getting shows in HD is higher quality right?  These types of tiny rip end up looking worse than the regular 350MB SD scene rips upscaled.  There's a reason proper 40 minute TV show rips are around 1GB... higher bitrate and less quantisation means noticably excellent quality.

(Side note: I downloaded the Dollhouse rips mkvGOD did and they were pisspoor.)"
,sonicbum,2011-10-30T19:31Z,"EXCELLENT!!  Looks great on my 40"" full hd tv!!  I voted for you on this and several other series u have provided us!!! 

THANKS!!!"
,sonicbum,2011-10-30T19:45Z,"OH, BUT U REALLY REALLY NEED TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE EPISODES!!  

IT SHOULD SAY:

EPISODE 01

NOT:
EPISODE 1



THEY GET ALL SCRAMBLED WHEN I PLAY THEM FROM A FOLDER BECAUSE OF YOUR NAMING SYSTEM...  IT PLAYS 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3....

SO, IF U CHANGED THE NAMES TO 01, 02, 03...10, 11....  THERE WOULDN'T BE THIS PROBLEM.."

The sound IS a bit too quiet. But good video quality for 280MB files!"
,SrMLove,2012-06-11T11:17Z,"@sonicbum... your lazy.. stop complaining and just say thank you... the uploader spent the time developing the torrent.. and you think it takes too much of your precious time to redo the titles to ""your preference"". make the torrent yourself if your gonna bitch like that about how its made.

thanks mkvGOD...good stuff as always...."
