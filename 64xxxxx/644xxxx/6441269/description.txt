
Resident Evil - Remake (Remake of the first part) for the PC. The basic concept and story, of course, retained. But apparently now it looks just gorgeous. The mansion has undergone a complete restructuring - both visual and architectural. Remain some puzzles, but most problematic places discarded or simplified.
