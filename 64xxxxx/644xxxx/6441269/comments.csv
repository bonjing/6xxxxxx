,elturbo9077,2011-06-02T06:01Z,like some one said what is this a emulator and iso to mount and what is this part one remake plz reply 
,Cerebral222,2011-06-02T12:07Z,"In your comments you say ""But apparently now it looks just gorgeous."" Is that to say you have never played this?, how do you know there's no bugs loaded on installation?."
,llnation26,2011-06-02T15:45Z,"Game installation is oke, but when i start the game, i got sound but the screen staying black.."
,Izkuzz,2011-06-02T19:09Z,Can we get some screens?
,datagrab,2011-06-02T23:27Z,Works fine dude. I extracted it though. then mounted. dunno y it worked that way. right click run as admin in win 7.
,pirateking22,2011-06-03T03:10Z,"this is not an official release.
i think it is a emulated gamecube version with sharper graphics and the install is in russian but not the game.it works and its a lot better than using a gamecube emulator."
,MAGIC409,2011-06-03T03:15Z,TURN YOUR UPLOAD SPEED UP!!!  im DL at 80kbs on a 12mbps line
,alpha2024,2011-06-03T06:24Z,It works! It's like someone took the gamecube version and ported it to the PC. Amazing!
,rfckillbill1987,2011-06-03T10:03Z,dose this have settings yet for xbox 360 pc controller any one know?
,frisbe,2011-06-03T11:34Z,"I have extracted and mounted ISO then installed game.  When I run it, and select ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"" I get the error - Unable to load DLL :\Resident Evil - Remake\RE.exe->XINPUT1_3.DLL  The specified module could not be found.    I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times with the same results.  Any help would be appreciated."
,danilo86,2011-06-03T15:45Z,"Part 2 have a release date?
Thanks uploader."
,Cerebral222,2011-06-03T16:05Z,"This is an awesome game, works perfectly. If your trying to use xbox controller, use Xpadder with it. If your getting sound but no visual, tweak or update your codec pack (if installing K-lite use the ""lots of stuff"" setting in the drop down list. For .DLL problems normally you just need to update your graphics card drivers before you install the game. Thanks for this excellent & clean upload .BONE. I will seed this for quite some time, my thanks also to you seeders, Cheers."
,llnation26,2011-06-03T17:17Z,"Still no Visual, updated my graphics card etc.. well to bad"
,danilo86,2011-06-03T21:17Z,"Works 100%!

Anyway thanks .BONE."
,mitsosexilium,2011-06-03T21:19Z,it's working for me but it's terribly slow! any help?
,mitsosexilium,2011-06-03T21:23Z,@danilo86  i have quadcore processor and it;s still very slow..
,paparian,2011-06-03T21:50Z,"@frisbe : update DirectX
@llnation26 : match the resolution of the game with screen res.

:p"
,frisbe,2011-06-04T01:11Z,Thx papa.I had the latest version of directx but reinstalled it and it worked but unfortunately I am having the same problem now as llnation and that is after I verified that my screen resolution matched. I can hear the audio but the screen stays black. Will continue to fiddle with it and update if I can get it resolved.
,Ultrakonkret,2011-06-04T03:41Z,"its the gamecube version with an integrated emulator, maybe some better highres textures, runs  in fullscreen at high resolution as good as the dolphin emulated in low resolution window mode..."
,mitsosexilium,2011-06-04T12:47Z,very slow! 
,elturbo9077,2011-06-04T23:01Z,i think that the uploader has not even tested the game on himself thats why no reply and not even a downloader comment to see or how it went on the install 
,jygsy,2011-06-07T22:04Z,"How am I supposed to run part 2 of the game? After starting the game and choosing ""part 2"" I can't continue the game where part 1 ended. And if I try to load the game in ""part 2"" game it then asks me to switch back to ""part 1""."

,Zeiken,2011-06-17T04:01Z,"I personally didn't like this torrent because It ran very slow(like 30-40FPS in my guess) in my ""not even a year old"" gaming computer. Maby it was because I had the grafics setting set up at 1920x1080. I restarted my computer and went on to restart the game and change the grafics setting back to default but launching the application resulted in an instant ""Failed to start"" error provoking me to instantly uninstall this disaster... I'm better off downloading the GC version of this and running it on my Dolphine emulator.(Running GC games on my Dolphine emulator has no lag whatsoever)."

,ovnoglavi,2011-07-17T16:47Z,"Well, the speed is fabulous... I'm downloadig at 155 Kb/s ( thats my top torrent down speed, cause I have 1,5 Mbit/s connection)... Anyway after reading the comments I decided to writte one down... This is a free game!!! You shouldn't beach about down speed even if it's 10 Kb/s... If it bothers you go buy the game!!!
I hope it's a good game and that it works on my PC... 
Thanks a lot to the uploader!!!"

,ValnecK,2011-09-06T17:39Z,"Ok,I solved evrything and for those who are asking how to change disc here is how:
Run game normaly,select Disc 1,than when it asks to change disck do this:
1. Press ALT+TAB and you should see white blank space
2. Than on that blank space select first tab like on normal GC emulator,when you selected first tab,select second line on that tab and now browsing window should open
3. Than from that navigate to C:\Resident Evil - Remake  
4.When you navigated to C:\Resident Evil - Remake   you will see ISO named R1B,open it and enyoj in DISC 2

Sorry for my bad english ;)"

,manic-12,2011-09-30T19:14Z,"This is great.  Its bringing me back man!  I've only experienced one irregular glitch so far.  That being a slight frame rate reduction in the mansion lobby. but only the camera angle facing the east wing double doors. other than that it works fantastically on my high end, late 2010 laptop.  there were a couple of glitches in the original gamecube copy as most of you probably know.  they were still there.  just wouldn't be the same game though without them.

,bjeline,2012-01-04T10:17Z,"Firstly, thanks on this fine release, didn't expect to work :)

The game is running pretty smooth in 1680*1050 with 4xAA and enabled filtering on Ati 4850 & Q6600 @3ghz. For joypad lovers, i'm not sure if it's possible to play it by controller, try xpadder, it might work.

And about savegames, when u use inkribbon in a game, in upper left screen should popup location of the save. Since i have dolpin emulator it saved it on virtual memory card which dolphin uses.

Enjoy"
,bjeline,2012-01-04T13:18Z,"EDIT: just to say it works really fine with controller, using xpadder"
,nedimpirate,2012-01-17T14:48Z,"The game works fine.For those people that dont know how to change to disc2,you have to alt-tab during the game and navigate to dolphin window,then open the first menu(file)and choose the second option.Menu might not be visible but it is there.You can also change some settings in the third menu,such as setting efb copies to texture instead of default ram,it improves performance greatly."
,PirateZigg,2012-02-23T21:43Z,"Game is working perfectly fine, just can't access second disc. I've tried the Alt+Tab method but all I see is my currently running programs. Can someone please help with some simple and detailed instructions on how to load the second disc? Thanks!"
,chewrabbit,2012-03-20T14:08Z,I want to play this game with my ps3 controller any ideas how to do it? im using DS3 Tool for my controller but i cant choose my controller ingame?

and open the Dolphin file. Change the values to look like this - MainWindowPosX = 75
MainWindowPosY = 75
MainWindowWidth = 800
MainWindowHeight = 600
Language = 0
ShowToolbar = True

now you can alt tab and actually see the dolphin software"
