This is a book about unidentified flying objectsâ€”UFOâ€™sâ€”â€œflying saucers.â€ It is 
actually more than a
book; it is a report because it is the first time that anyone, either military 
or civilian, has brought
together in one document all the facts about this fascinating subject. With the 
exception of the style,
this report is written exactly the way I would have written it had I been 
officially asked to do so
while I was chief of the Air Forceâ€™s project for investigating UFO 
reportsâ€”Project Blue Book.
