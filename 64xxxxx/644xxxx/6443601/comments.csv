,Windoze7,2011-06-03T03:02Z,"Don't hate on LulzSec for hacking Sony. Hate on Sony for not encrypting your passwords YET AGAIN!!! LulzSec will not use your personnal info for anything, it was just to prove people that sony did not improve anything since the last 1 month downtime!"
,therealfriday13th,2011-06-03T03:22Z,"I'd have to agree with splint, here.  You're not punishing Sony, you're punishing the customers."

,JoeSSJ3,2011-06-03T03:30Z,"@splint424, and then you would go to prison for the rest of your life over something that's easy to get anyways, having fun with your internet hatred?"
,Altamente,2011-06-03T03:58Z,"@Windoze7 i completely agree with u man. That's what makes me like the LulzSec ""project"", they do this to lol (and make us lol) at the so called ""Big companies"" and how well they protect their customers/users infos, this is like and ""eye open"" for us...
I (in a way) don't understand the drama that people make about hackers and the way they ""expose"" their knowledge... "
,element89,2011-06-03T09:40Z,"@michifolf difference being that there is no important info (as in address, credit card information, etc) on here

GJ lulzsec"
,EAGauss,2011-06-03T11:19Z,Hahaha. Good job :D
,Bowarcher,2011-06-03T11:38Z,"LOL enjoy your jail time for downloading confidential information, faggots!"
,Borgodoc,2011-06-03T11:45Z,"You do realize that hacking Sony isn't affecting Sony as much as it is affecting us, the clients, right? Ok, congratulations, you hacked Sony, proved your point that their security is weak. Why spread all of the info that you gained from that hack, instead of just sending it to Sony as proof that they should make better work out of their security? That would be constructive, and would actually be a help to us, the clients. Now you just fucked the little man again instead of the 'big evil company'. Hope you enjoy it while it lasts, cause the amount of people backing you guys up is rapidly decreasing."
,ReaperPatrick,2011-06-03T13:45Z,Lol sony is PWND
,ajayu1992,2011-06-03T13:56Z,Sony jailed  the ps3 hacker george hotz... and became enemy for more than millons of hackers around the world... now all  their crosshairs is on sony...... SOWNAGE ROCKS !!! (sony will be fucked soon !! :) )
,Jacobred,2011-06-03T14:12Z,"Good release, sony need to sort their fucking security out its not hard to SALT + MD5 a password a few times, yes not 100% but much better than storing RAW passwords, thats what I would expect a small time website to be doing, not one of the worlds largest buisnesses.

Fucking awful, good release gonna steal some codes :"
,Jacobred,2011-06-03T14:14Z,The search function on there.. the input isn't even cleaned. Have fun people..
,Nitrogt45,2011-06-03T14:53Z,Just for the heck of it why doesn't LulzSec or Anonymous hack Microsoft I mean I couldnt play my PS3 for 3 weeks and people that have a 360 are enjoying the fact they have one??
,olavdk,2011-06-03T16:42Z,"Because microsoft most likely, since they're one of the leading software producers, propably has got extremely good security, and is considered impossible to hack."
,lol_davve,2011-06-03T20:40Z,"You only harm us, the users, and not Sony. I don't want people to see my user information. Why are you doing this?"

[T],theLEAK,2011-06-04T01:07Z,"Great upload! A+ or A*


There is one question theLEAK would want to know although the question may seem rhetorical.

Question: How to hell did you get a pink skull?

The most obvious answer theLEAK would think of is that you hacked TPB. But that's just a hypothesis.

Anyways, hope you won't get caught."
,weebay23,2011-06-04T04:53Z,"why would you do this to the simple man?

I know you want to hurt Sony, but you are not just hurting SONY by doing this. You are hurting 1 million ordinary people by making their private details available online for download via torrent.

Why? because Sony deserve it? Do the customers deserve it? 

Yes they trusted their details were safe when making purchases with a big comapny like SONY but it is harsh for you to blame them for that and say tough luck, you shouldn't have, we are putting your information online anyway. They are not well versed in the complexities of online data protection security like yourselves at lulzSec."
,siddhu93,2011-06-04T08:14Z,why do u guys want to do this?..... if u hack please keep it with you. y the hell do you want to share our informations? its horrible to see our infos here in torrent. Sony we Believed you but you let us down :(
,poonjabb,2011-06-04T11:32Z,"lulz you have big balls, fucking big balls!"
,Borgodoc,2011-06-04T13:30Z,"If Lulzsec really had big balls, they would try to make a just explanation about why they just throw 1 million accounts online. But, ofcourse, that won't happen, cause THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION for publishing account info from people that have nothing to do with Sony's bad security. Weak, Lulzsec, very fucking weak. I really do hope you may pay one day for this crime, cause that's all it is, criminal behavior. Lulzsec big balls? I think you might wanna call this big hack a case of tiny balls-compensation."
,Rui_Costa,2011-06-04T14:29Z,"When i think of people like Lulzsec, i think of a spotty ginger kid who is so fucking ugly, his dad has no choice but to constantly beat him. Tbh if i was his dad (which could well be the case) i would beat him too. If his balls had dropped, he could look at porn and knock one out. But unfortunately until his balls drop we have to put up with shit like this"
,thekiller2,2011-06-04T16:05Z,i ant going to download this because i dont want to get caught just asking what do the coupons even do 
,G.i.a.n.t,2011-06-04T18:36Z,How to redeem these codes .. Apparently almost all the login options are closed .. Or am i looking at it the wrong way? 
,tittopi,2011-06-04T21:19Z,"maybe some day somebody will make a movie about LulzSec

i bet it wont be Sony lol"
[T],theLEAK,2011-06-05T15:01Z,"@tittopi


LOL. If it did, Jesse Eisenberg would be in it."
,Doommius,2011-06-05T16:12Z,"@Nitrogt45
you can run homemade software on a 360 by installing Linux on it, thats what Geohotz did, And sony sued him... why you dont hack 360, simple. you understand?? or are you A noob"
,thekiller2,2011-06-05T18:08Z,anyone reply to this are there reedem codes in this torrent file

,arjuna123,2011-06-06T06:31Z,"Quick question, why are you doing this?

I don't really care why, but it would be cool to know"
,fr334a11,2011-06-06T23:14Z,"legit, though this is only one collection of many leaked personal information.  Heck in todays world there is little to say with privacy, though not totally cool about leaking info, i think that the middle finger to sony trumps, 

sorry all those who lost money, demand more from companies that you invest into"

,rastas959,2011-06-08T11:15Z,"microsoft is not impossible to hack. Thecoupons that are included in this torrent wil most likly be unuseable as microsoft keeps a close eye on TPB!

Regardless this info in ths torrent won't dp much harm unless there is personal info in it such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc. but where you live, what you purchased and so on isnt harmful info."
,Borgodoc,2011-06-10T21:17Z,"@ Malefor:
1) Do you really think Sony would have ignored this if they just sent an e-mail with all the compromised info after what happened to PSN? Lulzsec could have just let everyone know they hacked Sony, without releasing all this user info. Your argument doesn't make sense.
2) If they are as good as they claim to be, surely they can send e-mails that wouldn't lead to them, no?

I repeat my point: they claim that this is all a test to make companies improve their security, but why spread all this user info and be so goddamn smug about it? They must really like the smell of their own farts. Luckily, they arrested a few PSN-hackers in Spain today. You're next, Lulzsec!"
,JohnShit,2011-06-12T14:44Z,"Say what you want about LulzSec (you included, @wd123411) - they DID only exploit an SQL vulnerability, but it has cost the evil corporation Sony BILLIONS. Yes, BILLIONS. They don't pretend they used some super-secret 1337 hacker method. If I were you, I would stop blaming LulzSec and start blaming Sony for failing to protect your data and personal information. What if, instead of LulzSec, a criminal gang got hold of it? LulzSec did good - so STFU faggots."
,Portak,2011-06-13T18:35Z," Childish kid games really. Lulzsec found that they -could- do it, so they did. They get to do this from behind a lil computer screen in grandmas basement, or whatever antisocial setting they have, because it's secure. It's alot like pokeing a animal in a cage with a stick.

 If they were mature about it, once they found the exploit, they very easily could have turned it over to sony to fix, but that is not the case.

Ball less little basement trolls really."
,jgem,2011-06-13T21:25Z,"ok, whomever thinks that this isn't cool, here's what I gotta say : THEY did it. YOU can't do it. YOU can't do anything about it. THEY probably powned your ass, and YOU're gonna have to live with it. @LulzSec, AWESOME DL =P it made my day XD"
,_tijs14tijs_,2011-06-17T15:22Z,"According to Markus Alexej Persson, owner of Mojang AB (which you may not hack because the games are great) you do not steal at all.. you make a copy from the database and spread the copy, but the true database is still there so you dont steal.

If you destroy the database you just make an unplanned backup and destroy the real one for security reasons ;)"
,Diazafan,2011-06-26T06:56Z,.... to the bitchers... stop bitching at LulzSec... start bitching @ Sony! It's THEIR ineptitude which has put so many people's at risk.... LulzSec simply made us all aware of this. [rip LS]
