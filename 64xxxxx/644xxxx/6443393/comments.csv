Thanks to the uploader!"
,tricycle515,2011-07-20T18:11Z,"if you don't understand what is a sufficient bitrate for 1080p, you're an idiot for believing, and a blind man for not seeing, that crushing the filesize to a fourth will not compromise the quality.  

while you're at it, why not compress it further to 300MB per movie?  there'd be other morons out there saying v100a100, and 'i hate big filesizes'.

you can't prove an opinion.
you can prove bits per pixel is inadequate.  these here will be soooo crappy, below 0.100.
this torrent would be shot down in a heartbeat on any of the elite private sites for people that are serious and informed about mkv releases."

,TyMod,2011-07-22T23:01Z,"@tricycle5125

A. Your a fag, what type of name is tricycle.

B. They arn't FULL 1080p but widescreen and the bitrate is just fine to produce a perfect image.  Thanks mafiaa

PS: if you think those private sites are so good then get the hell off the pirate bay and join one where ""this torrent would be shot down in a heartbeat on any of the elite private sites for people that are serious and informed about mkv releases."" Maybe its just the fact you know nothing about MKV releases."

2. UNFINISHED/SAMPLE movies HAVE synchro problems, full movies DON`T. This is the
  nature of highly compressed content. The QUALITY of the display depends ALSO
  from the PLAYER you use. There are some buggy players which display those
  movies at the significiant worse quality!! If you have any problemms with your
  video player check ""Instruction for fixing your player problemms"" folder."

,carmine.engraved,2011-09-25T12:59Z,"I've finished downloading this torrent and am now seeding as best as I can (100KiB/s-ish is the best I can do, I'm at a ratio of 2, but plan to keep going for as long as there are more leechers than seeders).

The quality is great and I didn't have sound sync problems playing in Ubuntu 11.04 using mplayer (just the version you get from Software Centre).

I have a very old laptop with an Intel Pentium Dual-Core T2080 processor (which runs at a clock speed of 1.73GHz) and integrated graphics only.  Which is rubbish.  This kind of laptop would be the sort you'd get for something like Â£450 in 2006-7 (and, indeed, I did).  I downloaded this out of curiosity, given the aggressive compression, and was pleasantly surprised to find that my laptop can play it just fine!  So if you're worried about whether or not you can play these 1080p files, if your machine is newer than 2006 or cost you more than Â£450, the answer is, ""Yeah, you can play these files."""

This torrent is kick ass. I'm so glad it exists because the quality is amazing and It's also a small size. Dont believe me? Check the samples. 

The reason it's not looking like the same size is because of FASM Quality Enhancer Bitrate Squeezer. h264 compression method optimized
   directly for lowbitrate HD contents.

Makes the movies amazing and looking like you are right there in real life. I LOVE IT. The best part is? you dont need a blu-ray player to watch these. just use VLC media player"
