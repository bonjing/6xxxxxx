,kaizen61,2011-08-19T16:10Z,@clikaroo - Did you replace the dlls that were installed with the ones in the appropriate subdirectory of the torrent?  I'm guessing you didn't so I will and tell you what happens.  My guess is that is the patch - bit of course I'm just using my head.

,mordokch,2012-03-23T21:17Z,"yeha that's what you get when you strip out the nfo file from a release - no one knows what the fuck to do. I can work it out cos I've been doing this for years, but what about the poor sod who's just getting into it. Anyway yeah - just replace the installed files with the ones in the appropriate sub directory for your os (ie 32bit or 64bit) and your good to go (do that before running the plugins)."
