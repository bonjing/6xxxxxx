This. He did it on TVTeam's also. If your version is good people will acclimate to it and if your versions are consistantly good people will acclimate to them first."

,mytpoole,2011-06-07T11:38Z,this is real love it!
,RobinLewin,2011-06-08T15:20Z,"I just wasted my time down loaded this & while the sound quality is good it's in GERMAN NOT ENGLISH, with Russian subtitles. 

The picture quality is crap!!!"
,shasha2333,2011-06-09T18:50Z,No he just for some odd reason picked the one scene that is in German in the English version for his sample. I saw it in theatres in America and that scene is in German.
,yerisan710,2011-06-11T05:29Z,"Thanks for that ....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A6 A7((((((CAM))))))))....!!!!"
,ByrdeDragon,2011-06-14T14:22Z,"Not much different than epic's version. this has the same flicker, and no English translations for the subtitles. watchable, but I'll wait.

,4G4U4N4,2011-06-15T16:49Z,"Why do so many people upload CAM. I find it unsatisfying (I know I'm sounding like an ass since it is free and all, but WHY THE FUCK DON'T YOU WRITE ""CAM"" ON THE TITLE INSTEAD OF MISLEADING US/ME?!?!?) -_- "
,4G4U4N4,2011-06-15T16:50Z,WRITE CAM ON THE TITLE INSTEAD OF MISLEADING US YOU DAMNED MAGGOTS!
,4G4U4N4,2011-06-15T16:51Z,"WRITE CAM ON THE TITLE INSTEAD OF MISLEADING US YOU DAMNED MAGGOTS!

(TPB has an epic system, I wrote that shit and now it says: You are posting comments too fast, slow down) :D"
,Aurasan,2011-06-16T01:48Z,"um.. is it just me or is it Philonetic posting links to other torrents on razvan's? NOT razvan posting? Maybe randompirate should pull his head out of his ass and DEAL WITH THE REAL ISSUES LIKE ASSHOLES FROM PAYSITES SPAMMING UP TORRENTS? I mean fuck, throw a goddamn captcha into the registration process or something. Fuck.

Thanks razvan!"

,kingjazz,2011-06-19T19:00Z,@4G4U4N4 - seriously?! by now you should know that TS is a CAM version...and if you look at the title...do you see the TS part? ;) :p
