,isaacgar,2011-06-22T00:38Z,doesn't work on new dash and firmware LT+1.9
,rudedog9d,2011-06-23T05:05Z,"@jrkenny5, @PoorSap, @BlackBird_XD - You have to have your xbox flashed to play copied games, they don't just work! You are fine online also if you have the proper FW.

@konicus You kind of people are idiots, anyone looking at the comments is either a future leecher, current leecher, or seeder. No-one who has this and isn't seeding is going to be looking at comments, and your comments are just STUPID because all they do is take up valuable space"

,Powerslave0,2011-07-09T19:18Z,"I have been using iX1.51 with my Hitachi 47D, on an offline console for years, and everything works with the original format.  IT ignores all waves. This all ends for Hitachi users when the XD3G format is finally used with game discs. Hitachi drives are not reflashed with the update, so they will not be able to read them.  M$ is replacing incompatible consoles with free 250GB Slim models. 

I am trying to get concrete information on Hitachi drives and this new format, but no one has any real information about it. I have a 47D, and I am not going to chance it with my Reach Beta disc. 

If anyone has concrete info on what is happening with Hitachi drives and the new dashboard/flash update, please respond."
,Powerslave0,2011-07-11T04:31Z,"...And, the game works just fine on my Hitachi 47D w/Ix 1.51"
,jtmolloy93,2011-07-31T17:28Z,"Game works Fine, For people asking new games released after kinnect dash update will only work on a updated Lt+ 1.9,  Currently AP2.5 games don't work. If you have LT 1.1 then you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THIS.

Passed on Lvl 3 Autofix btw."
