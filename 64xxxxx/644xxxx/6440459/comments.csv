,Der Steppenwolf,2011-06-04T17:42Z,"Just like rest av skidrows Dirt 3 torrents, this one too i loaded with virus/malware designed to turn your computer into a part of botnet. You download shit if you wan't too but don't say that you have not been warned. 
And to you Skidrow: Does your mother still works the streets as before ? Give her my regards and tell her that she still is one of best blowjobers out there."

,PorscheLiebhaber,2011-06-05T05:07Z,"For the love of God, remove the virus and re-upload it, why the previous cracks from SKIDROW were virus free except this one, it's really giving me a hard time!"

,rocco_sifredi,2011-06-07T07:47Z,"it doesn't work ! The crack , though it seems this time virus free (AVAST), is useless. My pc meets all requirements for this game. So how the fuck do you claim that the game works people ? You are either liars all or idiots. Just my opinion, not need to worry...lol"
,olimpas83,2011-06-07T10:03Z,"For me working game with win 7, but not with this update,this how it works for me step by step:

1. installed fresh game
2. updated all drivers (video card,DirectX and G4WL)
3.copied this crack http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6432250/Dirt_3_crack and to play it use play.exe

PS. And like i said before you need to buy this game to get authentication key for G4WL to get saves work."
,PorscheLiebhaber,2011-06-07T18:10Z,"@rocco_sifredi
The crack works for me, but I have to disable my anti virus (Avira) every time I want to start the game and every time I log in Windows! The detected files have ""TR/Black.Gen2 Trojan"" virus"
,redsky141,2011-06-09T07:52Z,"ok guys... im usually really happy with SKIDROWs work... have downloaded multiple files from here and have seeded willing aswell... but as of late i have been having issues with his/her newer uploads... i install, update (if required), copy .dll files and anything else... when i try and run the game... it simply doesnt open... i have had this issues with fable 3 and now Dirt 3 aswell... any help wld be greatly appreciated

redsky141"
,zoelechat,2011-06-16T15:11Z,"@redsky141: got the same problem, nothing happened when i launched dirt3.exe. You have to replace GFWL by a former version.
For example, how i've done: install dirt 3, uninstall gfwl, install dirt 2 (yes 2! uninstall it before if it's already installed), play dirt 3!
Worked for me."
,cull3n,2011-06-18T06:48Z,"I just get, file ""Media1.cab"" broken. Anyone else has this issue and found the solution? I've tried downloading the update twice. So far no luck."
,Banzay27,2011-06-18T14:33Z,"Update changes list right on this page would be hot.
See if it's worth bothering to download.

To those folks talking of having trouble with Skidrow's latest, namely Fable III: I had no troubles with it and it so happens it was the last game I just installed and finished.
More often than not, I bet folks have a cluttered and/or infected OS and/or don't follow the instructions closely enough (even as simple as they are).
Really, I almost never had any problem with big group's releases, such as Skidrow's, Razor1911's and Reloaded's."
,zoelechat,2011-06-18T18:40Z,"@Banzay27
There are known GFWL issues that occurs even with original Dirt 3/Fable III so that's not Skidrow's fault of course!"

,KnuxTheFox,2011-06-22T06:21Z,"One problem I had was my antivirus automatically removed SKIDROW.dll because it showed up as a virus and my game stopped working as a result.  I had already deleted the torrent, so I have to download it again and reinstall."
,Banzay27,2011-06-22T16:21Z,"Seems to work fine. Installed Skidrow release of the game, installed this, played a fair bit - no glitch yet."

sup?"
,Vegasbob,2011-07-08T14:00Z,"I have the original release on Win7 64bit and noticed a few problems. Not sure if it's with release or with game itself. 

1. I already had a G4WL offline account made. Starting a new driver with that account in D3 it would make saves, but the saves were unreadable upon starting game again. Solved by making a new G4WL account from in the game. Saves with this account seem to load fine now.

2. The game seems unstable as hell. I get ""*** Has stoped working"" etc..etc fairly regularly. This may be related to my 3rd problem though which is....

3. I alt-tabbed out of the game once to check something, now the game will NEVER resume complete full screen again, no matter how many settings I change. Set it for full screen in compatibility mode, set it to run maximized and in normal window, tried playing with all the game settings, no go. Closest I can get is full screen with program window bar across top. Any ideas?? Maybe this update will fix this. 

4. Also I have an old Sidewinder game pad pro, Win 7 has drives for it and installs it fine, but the game will not recognize it. I have to set the individual controls to game pad buttons each time I start the game, it will not save the controller configuration for some reason. 

Other than this i'm pretty much loving the game, will probably go buy it soon, hopefully updates work out some of the bugs. "
,Vegasbob,2011-07-08T14:19Z,"Sorry...after reading other comments I felt I needed to add one.

Everyone saying this has a virus. You are fucking morons, if you don't understand why this is giving a false positive to your shitty ass free AV program then you need to do a little more reading on the net and you don't belong here trying to run cracked programs if your brains can't figure that out. Go read some...then come back... Idiots. 

And why why WHY is there ALWAYS some moron asking if this works with MULTIPLAYER? My god. If your here asking that question then you OBVIOUSLY do not know enough about cracked programs to be here. Go away, learn some, come back and try again. Seriously. "
,BGG001,2011-07-23T23:54Z,"Well, even though I own the game, I downloaded this simply because I didn't want to wait for the real update to download, making me leave the game open in the background (plus, if you quit, it continued downloading endlessly via the BITS service). 

So, I can't confirm that the crack works, but regarding a comment about the media1.cab, I can say that the update worked flawlessly."
,the_caesar,2011-07-28T10:58Z,"hey.. great upload..

but the game keeps crashin at random points.. still didnt get to start a race !

installed and updated properly and got really nice rig

any ideas why ?

thx"
,HolyDeath3000,2011-08-09T23:14Z,"I have downloaded many skidrows torrents, and for me they never had not work. For those having issues. First thing you need to realize just about every crack and keygen usually gets deleted by stupid virus scanners. So disable and disable damn windows firewall. I use Commodo Security suite and no issues. 

Secondly for those who don't realize GFWL, its simple you make a offline account. And with any torrent/cracked program you will never be able to go online except for some, like crysis 2 I was able to do multiplayer but chances of that happening with this kind of game its not going to happen. I have yet to find a skidrow torrent not work... Only reason it might not work is due to these main reasons.

1. Stupid anti-virus and firewalls.
2. Your rig isn't good enough. 
3. You need to learn how to copy and paste files. 

These are usually the major issues oh yea that reminds me.

For damn window users disable the UAC b/c that in it self is gamers worst nightmare and even for legit ones i must add."
,gamer.55,2011-08-25T09:38Z,Hey even i am facing the mediacab1 error however that is in my AMD x4 965 (every time i try) machine but the game installed easily in my torrent box running a pentium D........any help???.........runnin windows 7 in both
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-17T14:04Z,"I can confirm that after installing this update the game won't start - no error message whatsoever - in task manager the process starts and after a couple of seconds ends. 
I would really appreciate someone fixing this cause only with this patch you can play in 3D."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-18T20:30Z,"I found the fix to run the game - a guy posted a film on uTUbe - paste: ""Dirt 3 won't start / open / launch / work !! FIX !!""
His solution works for me but I must say Windows Live is the worst bullshit ever created that supposed to make gaming easier."
,Thiemok,2011-09-23T11:40Z,"fuck skidrow. all the shit that i downloaded from skidorw SUCKS!

Extremezone FTW"
,DontPissMeOff,2011-09-24T11:19Z,This is the G4W issue  - nothing wrong with Skidrow's release.
,mathias921,2011-10-06T14:57Z,"The crack runs great! However every time I play on Los Angeles memorial coliseum the game runs in slow motion which most likely is due to a major bug.

This is also the worst lamest track there is in the universe and I hate the whole idea of rallying/racing in California. Fucking whores who ruined such a great series of games with thier ''DiRT, Ken Block, Ford Fiesta, Monster Energy Drink, Baja and California/ Los Angeles propaganda.

If you Codemasters read this I hope your are happy now, fuck you'll at Codemasters for ruining and using Colin McRae's name for justifying such a bad game. Why don't you just call it X-Games 3 with Ken Block!?

To hell with Codemasters, Ken Cock and their sponsors.
Long live Colin McRae, I miss you so much!"
,IceBlack,2011-10-10T18:31Z,"The neccesary .dll's are marked as virusses by my virusscanner (ESET). Seems like real trojans, not gonna update it. Original Dirt 3 release doesn't give those errors."

,Kissen11,2012-01-06T13:41Z,"I hope anyone coul'd help me with an issue.
I've downloaded and tried a lot of different Dirt 3 uploads and there's no problem installing it and it to work.
The problem is that it freezes every 4-5 seconds. So I can't play.
I've tried all sorts of cracks and patches and it still don't work. Lower grafics and so on like someone mentioned. It can't be the computer cos I have an i7 2600K, GTX 580 and 8gb ram.
Any suggestions?
Thank's for the uploads! "

Thank's for the tip.
I have Win 7 with all the latest drivers and I actually bought the original game thinking I would get around the problem. But it's still the same. For now I'm sending mails to Codemasters asking for help. We haven't found a solution yet so we'll see.
Thanks anyway :-) "
