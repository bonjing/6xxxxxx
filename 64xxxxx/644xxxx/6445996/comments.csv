,cheezymadman,2011-06-05T21:20Z,"Audio de-sync can be fixed in VLC. Go to track synch under tools, and put in -5.7 seconds. Haven't watched long enough to fine-tune, but that's the value that it's off at the beginning."
,Revolos55,2011-06-05T23:36Z,The audio syncs back up on its own after a few minutes.

,Popplewick,2011-06-06T12:00Z,"Don't bother waiting for eztv, it's the same version, audio is off on it as well."
[V],ICM369,2011-06-07T00:08Z,Audio re syncs in after 4 mins guys i watched it all the way through last night and apart from 2 tiny glitches in the video lasting 1 second each right at the end it was fine. Once again my apolagies
