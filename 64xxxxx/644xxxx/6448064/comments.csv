,OmniusPrime,2011-06-12T18:44Z,"I'd prefer to ask this in email or something but there doesn't seem to be a way ... I just started Dling these torrents with the first 7, and gave a question: Some of the issues appear to be incomplete, for example the Strange Tales that are supposed to have Nick Fury and Doctor Strange only have the Nick Fury part, and the page numbering would seem to indicate that they were supposed to have the Dr Strange part but it's not there. I know I'm misunderstanding something about what this project is and how it's organized, and I can usually figure that sort of stuff out 8^) but I can't seem to find the other pieces and there do seem to be missing sections of storyline when I do get an issue that has both parts. So what's the blindingly obvious detail that I'm not seeing? 8^) In any case, thanks for these uploads! Brings back memories ..."
,internetmale,2011-06-13T14:23Z,"omnius, iirc he's split the issue up so it'll appear twice in the whole chronology project - once for Nick Fury, once for Dr Strange - because even though the stories were in the same issue doesn't mean they took place at the same point in continuity.

on the later discs it happens a lot with Annuals, they tend to have 2 or 3 'guest stories' with supporting characters etc"
