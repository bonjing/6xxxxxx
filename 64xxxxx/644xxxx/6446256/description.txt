AI Roboform Enterprise v7.3.2.0-TE

AI RoboForm is a push-button web form filler with some serious Artificial Intelligence (AI) inside. AI RoboForm allows you to define your personal profile or â€œusualâ€ responses to a web form. This information is then saved within AI RoboForm, and when you need to fill a form, just click â€œFill Formsâ€ button, and form is filled out. Being fully client-based AI RoboForm can be very fast, it never disables web site functions and AI RoboForm can also work in pop-up HTML windows. The most important feature of AI RoboForm is high accuracy â€“ it fills 95% of all fields correctly.

 INSTALLATION NOTES     

        Install AiRoboForm-Enterprise.exe.  After installation make
        sure all Internet Explorer and/or other browsers and explorer
        windows are closed or else the file will not copy over properly
        (as well as the Roboform Taskbar Icon).  Reboot into safe mode if
        you still have problems.  Copy roboform.dll into AI Roboform's
        installed folder, making sure to overwrite the existing file.  AI
        Roboform is now in the full PRO version with Enterprise features.

        We have included the Enterprise tool with this release so you
        don't need to request it from the homepage.  Its located in the
        PolicyEditor folder.

        Feel free to use the online sync feature, it does work fine when
        you run the setup.  Also make sure to set it up later or a
        taskbar notification will let you know once.  This is also known
        as RoboForm Everywhere which is fully functional in this release.
        Its suggested to use a different RoboForm Everywhere password
        than your master password.  This way nobody will be able to
        decrypt your online database except you.

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
