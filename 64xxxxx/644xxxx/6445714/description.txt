RELEASE  NOTES

NOTE: Watch out for a nice & useful easter egg. )
Hint: Command line version & locked archives...

WinRAR is a powerful archive manager. It can backup
your data and reduce the size of email attachments,
decompress RAR, ZIP and other files downloaded from
Internet and create new archives in RAR and ZIP file
format.

Using WinRAR puts you ahead of the crowd when it
comes to compression by consistently making
smaller archives than the competition, saving disk
space and transmission costs.

WinRAR provides complete support for RAR and ZIP
archives and is able to unpack CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR,
GZ, ACE, UUE, BZ2, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z archives.

WinRAR offers a graphic interactive interface
utilizing mouse and menus as well as the command
line interface.

When you purchase WinRAR license you are buying a
license to the complete technology, no need to
purchase add-ons to create self-extracting files,
it's all included. One price, one payment, once.

You also receive the benefit of a life-time use of
the WinRAR archiver. No upgrade fee to pay. When a
new release is made, simply download and install,
your license is valid for life.

WinRAR is easier to use than many other archivers
with the inclusion of a special "Wizard" mode
which allows instant access to the basic archiving
functions through a simple question and answer
procedure. This avoids confusion in the early
stages of use.

WinRAR offers you the benefit of industry strength
archive encryption using AES (Advanced Encryption
Standard) with a key of 128 bits.

WinRAR supports files and archives up to 8,589
billion gigabytes in size. The number of archived
