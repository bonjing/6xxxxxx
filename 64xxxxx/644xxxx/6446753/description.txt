AFL 2011 Round 08
Western Bulldogs v Richmond Tigers
Sunday 15 May 2011, 2.10pm
Etihad Stadium
Official Attendance: 39,141

Western Bulldogs, still missing big guns Barry Hall and Brian Lake, continue to hold hopes of making the Grand Final this year after 3 consecutive seasons of being losing Preliminary Finalists. They have had a poor start to the season with 2 wins but only over newcomers to the competition Gold Coast Suns (2 wins) and last place Brisbane Lions who are yet to win a game. Richmond Tigers, with Robin Nahas, Trent Cotchin and Jack Riewoldt all kicking 4 goals last week, are in their favourite position of 9th and are coming off 2 consecutive wins but have been plagued by poor starts (they are yet to win a 1st quarter) and inconsistent games all season, being poor one quarter and good the next. Would today be the day the Tigers put 4 good quarters together? Or would the Bulldogs improve and take a step up the ladder?
