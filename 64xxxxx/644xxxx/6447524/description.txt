BBC Queen Days of Our Lives 2of2 576p HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Part 2.
The second half of this documentary sees Queen at the peak of their powers. With the ultimate showman in Freddie Mercury and a string of rock anthems to their name, Queen smashed attendance records with a series of stadium shows across South America. But the band quickly learned that if reaching the top is tough, staying there is the biggest challenge of all. With a loss of focus in the studio, the decline in popularity in North America, increasing internal tension and a desire to pursue solo projects, it seemed as if the band had had its day. Then came the performance from Mercury at Live Aid, and their record breaking Magic tour in 1986. Queen were propelled back amongst the very best. Rejuvinated, the world was once again at their feet, but then tragedy struck and threatened to tear the band apart. Featuring musical performances, previously unseen and rare footage, and intimate interviews.
