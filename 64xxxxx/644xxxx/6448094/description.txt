[excerpted from John Stossel's blog:]

My Fox Business show tonight is titled â€œThe State Against Blacks.â€ That sounds counter-intuitive. After all, government has created all sorts of programs that are supposed to help minorities.

But as I write in my syndicated column this week, the opposite happens.
