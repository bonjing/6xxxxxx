Picture is somewhat blurry but still watchable. Occasional flashes from the camera adjusting during very bright scenes. Otherwise you can pretty much make out the details. Audio is fine, no English subtitles when Russian language is being spoken which is only a few scenes.  Movie however was a bit of a let down.

Thanks for the upload. In my opinion don't download. The cam quality will ruin the experience of a good movie."
