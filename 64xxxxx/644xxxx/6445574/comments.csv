,shelbylab,2011-06-05T17:54Z,Is this SBS or Anaglyph?
,babybluetits24,2011-06-12T16:25Z,so this is 3d ? will it look ok if we play it on a  non 3d tv ? or will it look all funny ?
,shelbylab,2011-06-14T23:12Z,Anyone know how to unpack this? Stuffit expander says the archive is corrupt. I've downloaded it three times with no luck.
,divxclub,2011-06-27T02:57Z,I got 5 rar files and it's been 4 hours now and it's only 40% done .... total unpacked archive is 20+ GB and on my i7 computer should of been done like 4 hours ago so I am still unpacking. Now another thing this is not mkv like usually but ISO image and I really don't understand why. I How this is MKV and not Blu-RAY iso image that I'll have to recode to mkv cause I never done that before.
,babybluetits24,2011-07-01T15:11Z,after using winrar to unrar this it becomes a 21.7gb iso file. normally vlc player can play iso files but it cant this file ! power dvd ultra also doesnt detect this nor does kmplayer so how do we play this on a pc ?
,divxclub,2011-07-02T04:29Z,"Okay. It took me over 6 hours to unpack ISO file and iti is indeed a ISO image of a BluRay. I don't have burner to try it but according to DVDfab it's good ISO of original bluray 3D content. Now does anyone can recode this to MKV 3D so we can actually watch it ? I tried myself but I could not figure some things out like frame size ...should it be 50% that in default or 100% and like other things because I tried DVDfab tutorials and they are not that clear. So if anyone can explain on how to make MKV from this iso I""ll do release myself and release mkv.

Thanks for this iso once again .

P.S.

What's with that 6 hours unpacking ? Did anyone had same problem or it was fast as it should be ? Cause on i7 and 6gb ram with RAID0 it should be pretty fast ....."
,babybluetits24,2011-07-05T04:24Z,this forum thread should help people getting this file http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=97479
,exateit,2011-08-01T15:02Z,"I am also unpacking with Winrar and estimated time to unpack is 6 hours.  I too am also using i7 920 2.66GHZ processor with 6GB DDR3 RAM and bags of harddrive.  I will review once I burn it to 25GB bluray disc.  For playing on harddrive i suggest using PowerISO to mount the ISO file and then play with PowerDVD 11 or WinDVD or ArcSoft Totalmedia Theatre 5.  I am not using Nvdia 3D Vision, i am connected to a 47inch LG Cinema 3D TV, so ill let you know what the results are later"
,exateit,2011-08-02T17:45Z,"OK got it unpacked, just double click on one of the RAR files, inside the RAR file you will see the folder, open that folder you will see the ISO file - drag and drop the ISO file to desktop and it will start extracting with no errors (it takes about 6 hours to extract on i7 processor).

I burnt the ISO file to 25GB bluray disc using Nero.  I played it on my 3D bluray player connected to my 3DTV, it is the real deal it has the option of playing the 3D or 2D version.  3D version is fantastic, picture quality is brilliant and some of the scenes the planes really jump out of the screen.

Thanks a million to the uploader, next time just upload as ISO file, dont bother RAR'ing the file, it does not really make much compression considering it is high definition.  Thanks"
,ofpirate,2011-08-26T11:00Z,"phenom ii 950 quad core htpc with 8gb of 1066: normally takes me less than 5 mins to extract something in the 5 to 10 gb range.. extracting for 2 hrs now and  barely scratching the surface of this thing.. aside from being a completely unnecessary step, there is definitely something seriously wack with this arch!"
,ofpirate,2011-08-26T19:44Z,corrupt unpack.. huge waste of time and resources!
,rathesungod22,2011-09-05T22:10Z,"1 day to Unpack the file, 3 days to convert the ISO to a MKV....and then find out it IS NOT 3D."
,Phillu,2011-09-24T21:03Z,extraction took nearly seven hours - worked fine then - awesome 3D film
,FkCrapple,2011-09-26T19:51Z,"I think this legends of flight torrent was created by a newbie since the entire blue ray disk has been converted to RAR archive. It takes over 7 hours to extract it after you finish downloading (which I am doing right now). So I can't tell if it will work. Next time leaving it as is, or re-encoding to smaller size would be great. thankx!"
,FkCrapple,2011-09-28T19:08Z,Ok don't waste your time downloading this if you don't have a Blu-ray burner (who makes blu-ray anyway nowadays). Complete waste of time. No way to convert to a playable format. Everyone uses MKV SBS files for 3D currently
,DontPissMeOff,2011-10-06T13:03Z,"I don't know how about this torrent, but I downloaded it from 3Dtorrents and this is the most amazing 3D documentary I have ever seen. The quality and 3D effect are superb. Here's a link I used:

Thank you Pirate Bay for creating this 3D category. I hope there will be more films here soon."
,margalo,2011-10-08T16:00Z,i extract it... more than 5 hours to do... it create an iso file zero bytes help please
,full_moon,2011-12-02T05:15Z,"You really need to change format of uploading for big files.  
After 8 hours passing from unzipping, it is just in 45% of unzip!"
