,shadowmorph,2011-06-03T06:24Z,Extraction doesn't work.  Said it's missing a volume.
,primaler,2011-06-03T06:26Z,"I confirm, the torrent's broken"
,PhilLesh12,2011-06-03T06:36Z,missing the actual .rar volume
,PhilLesh12,2011-06-03T06:38Z,"Anyone who has a torrentday account can just restart the download from there, and it will grab the .rar file.

,PhilLesh12,2011-06-03T06:45Z,"I don't know if this works, or not, but I have the complete torrent, it is identical here and on torrentday.

So... I'm going to keep seeding this torrent.  If you restart the download, it may or may not give you my copy of the missing .rar file.

Not sure, but it's worth a try."
,rabbit42,2011-06-03T06:53Z,wtf no rars??? yet this is a rar and is missing a file no less
,PhilLesh12,2011-06-03T07:09Z,"nah, I guess it wouldn't work for me to just keep seeding with a file that isn't in the .torrent hash file.

oh well, this is a good excuse for people to get an account on torrentday.com before it goes private in a couple weeks."
