0. What?/Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
redump.org is a disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to
collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever
released on optical media of any system. This information consists of data
checksums and some additional characteristics of the physical medium. redump.org
also provides guides to ensure the backups used for checksum calculation are
correctly done. Users of the website who follow the guides are encouraged to
participate by sharing their results, contributing this way to the advancement
of the project. Information from different people are compared to ensure the
accuracy of the results and to identify alternate versions of the same game.

They currently have more than 18800 (~5530 PS) disc entries present in their
database.

By submitting information about missing discs to the redump.org database, you
would be helping to achieve this greater common goal.
If you have original black CDs not listed in the PS database or even listed
ones, please go that extra mile and learn their preservation methods.

1. How to prepare?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The discs have been packed using PakkISO which works just like torrentzip.
Simply put, PakkISO is the torrentzip of disc based games. It will create
exact archives of matching files. It runs the data tracks through ECM, and
then compresses with 7z. Audio tracks are compressed using the Monkey Audio
lossless format (.ape). This results in a much higher compression ratio
compared to torrentzip or standard archivers.

You can choose from several programs to use for decompression. They all are
included in this torrent within 'important.zip'.

1.1. PakkISO shell integration *RECOMMENDED* (PakkISO-0.4-setup.exe).[1]

To unpack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'UnpakkISO'.

To unpack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's
folders to be processed, and select 'UnpakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be
automated.

1.2. PakkISO (PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip).[1]

To unpack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into unpakkIso.exe or
use command-line.

1.3. redumpExtractor (redumpExtractor_exe.zip or redumpExtractor.zip).[2]

Simple and intuitive GUI program. More information:

After successful decompression you should have one cue sheet file (.cue) and one
or several binary files (.bin).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#1. Archives will be deleted after decompression; raw files after compression,
i.e. content is transformed from compressed to decompressed state or vice versa.
So it is preferable to make a copy of directory you want to work with and use
that copy instead of original.
#2. External programs needed for this application are available in
'PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip'.


2. How to play?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To play on real hardware (console), first you need to burn the image(s) to a
disc using your favorite disc recording software and good quality blank media:
load the '.cue' file and burn. Make sure your console is capable of playing
backups. Preferred programs are: ImgBurn *RECOMMENDED*, BlindWrite & CDRWIN.[3]

The best way to play the games included in this collection on emulators is by
mounting them on a virtual drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol). Once you have the disc
mounted, just open the emulator and 'Open>CD-ROM via SPTI...' (Xebra) or 
'Insert CD drive' (pSX).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3. Please do not use Alcohol for recording, it is known to have problems with
cue sheet parsing and therefore will produce incorrect copies (virtual drive
function works fine though). 


3. How to update?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included with torrent within 'important.zip' are several '.dat' files to verify
downloaded files, update from previous torrent or audit your collection. Use
them with RomCenter, clrmamepro or other similar ROM manager.
