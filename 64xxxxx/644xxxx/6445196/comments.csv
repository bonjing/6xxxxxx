Wat kan hier de oorzaak van zijn?"
,zossie,2011-06-05T23:01Z,I have the same problem. Film stops in it's last 20 minutes. VLC and media player classic had the same problem.
,NightAlf,2011-06-06T01:28Z,"The end dosen't work. The movie is bad encoded too, so this is not a good download.
Now you know!"
,hauntnut,2011-06-06T01:31Z,"I have to say that this is a pretty crappy-looking BDrip. I'm not sure where this was sourced from, but considering there are no other BDrips out there, I would guess that this is an upconverted DVDrip. The actual Blu-Ray comes out August 16th; hopefully some better rips will come along around that time, because this one is just not up to par."
,sonofdog,2011-06-09T23:13Z,You said it folks. Just got me interested..now I've gotta download another to see the ending.
,vctrt1,2011-06-13T04:48Z,"Movie not complete, missing some 20 minutes from the end..."
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-06-13T12:09Z,"YOU FUCKING MORONS! THIS IS A DVD RIP UPSCALED (VERY VERY POORLY) TO 1080p!

Actually, the ""upscaling"" is more like ""nearest neighbor resizing"", so getting a DVD rip and blowing it up on your HDTV will yield BETTER resolution than this piece of shit.

Fuck you very much for this."
,DrTheFunk,2011-07-28T22:39Z,Don't download.  The end is cut off and the frame rate is horrible
