,Calamakuya,2011-06-05T20:55Z,"Mmm...  About the fast download....   I can assure you it's not that fast.

Took me like 5 minutes just to DL the Sample "
,Calamakuya,2011-06-05T21:11Z,"There's a ""humming"" sound in the background right in the audible range and the speech volume seems a bit low.  

Besides that, everything seem to be in proper order.

Thank you for the upload extremezone, great as usual...  

...and to you leechers, do seed the torrent.  May the TORRENT GOD curse you if you don't."

,Fabour,2011-06-24T02:21Z,"@high.octane You arrogant cunt. If everyone was like you, then google search would be useless as there would be no responses to search results anyway!

@ghostrider666666 R5 stands for Region 5 release. The movie industry release a bog staandard R5 release before the DVD release (lacks all extra's such as comentary etc) to combat bootleg in Russia. R5 line is where the release may have been a genuine R5 but may have been in russia language. So where you see R5 line, it is basically re-dubbed over the existing language with another. Often from TS, TC or Cam copies. Thus R5 line audio quality is generally poor than that of R5."
