Heirlooms is obtained either by honor points you gather from pvp, or from justice points you get from doing heroic dungeons. The NPC for pvp heirlooms is standing deep in the pvp room also known as champions hall. The pve heirloom NPC is standing next to the NPC selling valor points gear in the command center, in Stormwind."
