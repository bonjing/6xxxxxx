,BSol,2011-12-16T05:13Z,"This is a great collection. All the songs are mixed to emphasize the beats and rhythms appropriate to each dance. The way the songs are mixed fits so well with the dances. Superb!

Also, all the tracks have the BPM in the title (except for Jive and Tango for some reason). My only complaint is that some of the songs aren't within IDSF tempo regulations. For example the sambas range from 44-54 BPM (strict tempo is 50-52 BPM)."
