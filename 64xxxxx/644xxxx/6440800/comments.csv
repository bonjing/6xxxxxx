,pjsmoke,2011-06-02T10:39Z,"You should definitely upload more horror movies, but upload the good ones/cult classics, not the crappy slasher or weird foreign movies. 

Examples, of Bluray rips I don't have - Aliens, Alien 3, Event Horizon, The Evil Dead Triology! etc. 

Also, it's not a request as I'll encode my own videos but if a small size blueray rip is available I'll take it."

,duranachampion,2011-07-15T20:46Z,"i have downloaded this. The quality is just tolerable. The low size comes with a cost! This rip is good for those who want to watch once and then delete. But for the collectors, stay away from this."
,renison7,2011-08-29T09:52Z,The Ring Two is not the unrated cut. For guys who don't know the diff. is 20 min.
,strinjim,2011-11-13T12:22Z,"There was a short included with the DVD release of ""the ring two"" named ""rings""...  Has anyone uploaded this?"
