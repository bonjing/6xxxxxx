,themrp,2011-06-14T05:56Z,"Hey thethingy I wonder if you could help me or identify my problem.

I reinstalled this for the second time and Illustrator always gives me a problem.

Last time it always asked for the serial.

This time it will load up, then close out immediately without me doing anything.

I followed the instructions step-by-step, but this one just won't work.

Any help?

Thanks."

,BillyBobsFruitShop,2011-08-03T11:26Z,"Hi thethingy

I seem to be having an issue with the install. At about 10% the Adobe installer is asking me the following:

""Please insert Disk AdobeDesignPremium5.5-English to continue""

Perhaps I have been following the instructions incorrectly but I didn't think I needed to produce a CD.

Could you help?

Cheers

You are a superbadass ;) i dl cs5 design premium but i´m lost to how i should proceed after exchanging the amtlib.dll´s and how to update the apps. furthermore i cannot activate PS 64 bit with the keys given and i cannot find the download on ptb where i could browse the comments for help... can you pm me ?
,tre.fire,2011-10-19T02:36Z,"Thethingy, I'm making my way through the host file setup as per the document in your .exe file. First, I've said it before, but thank you for your work. One thing, though; one job I do is technical writing for software companies (in other words, I have a fairly good sense of understanding for things technical), but I find your instructions a bit hard to follow. One sentence I am stuck on, for instance: ""So now your hosts should be renamed to hostsbackup and now you need to simply copy the 
hosts from this folder and paste it to the ETC folder."" I assume by this that you mean just ctrl+c the hostsbackup file and then ctrl this docuent within the etc folder, is that right?
If you would like, I could re-write this document to make it more clear, particularly for those whose English is 2nd or 3rd choice.
But again, thanks for your efforts."

,c.rapelli,2012-04-01T14:05Z,"thethingy, thanks for your torrent. I pls need your advice. 
I changed my OS from XP to w7 using the same computer. Under XP I had this torrent installed without any issues. Installing it now worked well except for Illustrator. At the beginning, where you can select which parts of the program to install, I had a sign (only) beside Illustrator mentioning that my computer lakes basic requirements (did not have this under XP). I ignored that and proceeded with the installation. Reg Code and all went well. At the end when replacing the .dll I could not find the .dll and so assumed that Illustrator was not fully installed. But there was an .lnk file that I used. It displayed a window that says (something like): continue 30 days trail or register. At the button to register I could have entered the reg cod. I did try to enter the same as I used for the package at the beginning - it failed telling me it is not valid. I also used the other and it failed. 
Now, much later I noticed that the directory structure was much different and had to go down to  to replace the dll. Illustrator now starts but it displays the word ""TRYOUT"" beside the Application name. All other Applications don't do so. Also, after loading Illu it is closed after a few seconds.

thethingy, I sure need to correct this and would appreciate your advice how I can solve that? As written, I am using the same Computer with no changes in HW config except the OS changed. Illustrator is for me the most important part of the whole package.

Otherwise all is clean and well working. Many thanks for all your effort.
Appreciate your help. "
