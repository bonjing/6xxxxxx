[INSTALLATION NOTES]

1. Before installing you will need to use WinRar or a similar program to extract the files.

2. Install the Trial Version, it does not matter if this is a new installation or you have an existing 7.x.x version

3. During the install ROBOFORM should have closed all browser(s) and windows explorer(s) (or will ask you to do so if it fails to, please do this step if needed), once the install is complete it will force open your default browser!! Close it!! And you should note that a "TaskBar Icon" from Roboform is still open at the bottom right corner of your screen (use the show hidden option if not seen (Green monitor with 2 robot green eyes)), !! Right click and chose exit!!

4. Go to C:\Program Files\Siber Systems\AI Roboform\ (or if you are using a 64 bit windows C:\Program Files (x86)\Siber Systems\AI Roboform\) copy the "Patch-RuBoard.exe" file to the folder

5. If your using a 32bit windows, then just double click the "Patch-RuBoard.exe" file, if youâ€™re on a 64 bit then it is suggested you right click on the "Patch-RuBoard.exe" file and select "Run as an Administrator"... the black screen will tell you successful or not.( note: on every upgrade the patch must be re-used)

6. To verify 1st go to your Start menu, then programs (or All Programs) and select the Roboform menu and choose "TaskBar Icon" then go to bottom right corner of your screen and right click the "TaskBar Icon"(use the show hidden option if not seen (Green monitor with 2 robot green eyes)), go to help (near the top with the blue ?) and from the drop down options choose "About...) and it should not say free trial any longer but on the right near the big picture it should say License: Roboform Desktop Enterprise right under the version #.

7. That is it
