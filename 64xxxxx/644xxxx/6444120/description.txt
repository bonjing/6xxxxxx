|Game Description|
+----------------+

Yume Nikki (Dream Diary) is a 2005 independently produced surreal-horror PC game by homebrew developer Kikiyama. The game was created using RPG Maker, but has few role-playing game elements. Players explore the dreams of the fictional character Madotsuki, a female hikikomori who lives at home in her apartment. It is through this that the player is able to view scenes that are recognized as being genuinely disturbing at times, such as being swallowed by a large red sewer-creature, meeting a disembodied head character known only as Uboa (who then transports the player to an endless, repeating stretch of map) and a full-screen rotating image of a girl with five arms.
