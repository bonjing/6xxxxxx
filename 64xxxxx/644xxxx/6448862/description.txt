This OS is for people that have never used Linux before or for people that just want an out-of-the-box working OS without doing all the tweaks and enhancements that everyone seems to do when installing a fresh copy of Ubuntu or other Linux based Distro's.

Changes from 11.04 to 11.04.1 Downgraded Compiz to the stable 0.8.6 (thanks to Giodic) and all packages got updated to there latest versions on May 26 2011
