Plot
Sujit started having mental problems when he was six years after visiting his dad, Ajit, at a mental asylum. Thereafter he kept on getting into trouble, and even ran away from the orphanage. Years later a Musician and Singer, Shyam, found Sujit singing on the roadside, and decided to hire him as a singer in a nightclub. This is where Sujit meets dancer, Jenny, and both fall in love with each other. When they announce their plans to get married, the news does not auger well with the nightclub's owner, Max, an argument ensues, Max draws a gun, and Shyam ends up killing Max. Sujit decides to take the blame, is arrested by the police, he feigns insanity, and is ordered to be admitted in a mental asylum until he recovers. In the asylum he is placed under the compassionate care of Dr. Shalini and about one year later is discharged. He returns to the nightclub just in time to for Jenny's and Shyam's engagement party. Baffled, confused, and angered at this betrayal, he really does go insane and ends up being re-admitted in the very same asylum. But this time his chances of recovery are very slim as he has retreated deep into the inner recesses of his mind - from where he may never return.
