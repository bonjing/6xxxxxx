Sarah Kerrigan is back. Or is she?

On Tarsonis, Sarah Kerrigan was betrayed by her allies and left to die by the people she trusted most â€” but she survived, twisted by the terrifying zerg Overmind. As the Queen of Blades, she controlled the voracious zerg Swarm in a campaign of vengeance and retribution with a deathtoll numbering in the billions. Now, with her powers stripped and her mind finally free from the zerg influence, how much is really left of the woman who once was Sarah Kerrigan? Can her human side be redeemed... or does Kerriganâ€™s fate forever lie within the Heart of the Swarm?
