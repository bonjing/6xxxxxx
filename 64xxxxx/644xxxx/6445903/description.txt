Casablanca (1942) is one of the greatest movie memories ever - with an 
unforgettable story of romantic chivalry such as seems no longer to be
taught to young men in their formative years, Iâ€™m sad to say.

Starring Humphrey Bogart, and the lovely Ms. Ingrid Bergman (would the worst of
the nazi element really have been insane enough to stick this gal in a
concentration camp as is threatened in the movie??) Live and learn eh!
Certainly no sense of chivalry to speak of in that attitude!

This is a 720p movie file in 1.67 GB size (approx 2150k bitrate)
192k audio and with a host of subtitles offerings we found on the net
and elsewhere too. There are some languages we couldnâ€™t find matching subs
for as so we will remain vigilant and post them as thy become available to us.

Its time this movie was in the public domain after these past 70 years that's
its been collecting high prices over.
