,djjaeger,2011-07-02T05:23Z,"What compression software do you use to get these files so small? I have a converter program for changing other video files into .mkv x264, but I can not get them nearly so small. Thanks in advance!"
,Progressychedelic,2011-07-03T23:34Z,Thanks mkvGOD!
,TheGreatGig,2011-07-06T21:25Z,"Thanks for the great upload. I'll make sure to seed it :) Also, Night_89, cheers for the subs link."
,nickstarks,2011-07-20T07:34Z,"Its over compressed, resulting in a loss of video clarity. Better than the tv-ripped office torrent but its a stretch to have this torrent in the HighRes section. ton of pixelation. Still D/L worthy but not highres.. feels like 480 converted to 720.."
,Durhon,2011-08-23T09:02Z,Amazing quality! Great torrent.
,Durhon,2011-08-27T05:27Z,"Watched up to Season 4 there are a few audio glitches in Season 4, mainly with syncing and sometimes there is no audio in one speaker but that is all."

,Ki1l4U,2011-09-14T05:15Z,I wish you had a screenshot so I could see how good the video quality is but if YIFY says you're good then this torrent has to be amazing.
,explosivefrostbite,2011-09-16T12:55Z,"It is a privilege to have uploaders like you and YIFY who put in so much effort to bring in the best of media at a minimum file size so that we can sit at home and enjoy all of this. You people will be blessed by God. For me, you are already Gods of TPB."
,Ki1l4U,2011-09-26T04:29Z,"Amazing torrent but season 4 episode 1 ""fun run"" cuts off the last couple of minutes, I still recommend this download and just get that one episode from somewhere else. Thank you mkvGOD"

,Archie.Bunker,2011-10-04T21:30Z,"I agree with nickstarks.

The video quality is good but it is not high definition. It does not look like a blu ray rip. This looks like a DVD rip. "

,a_hydra,2012-02-19T12:04Z,Thanks for another quality upload! Downloading now.
,CodeX96,2012-05-01T03:32Z,No offense but the video bitrate should be higher and the audio should not be AAC it should be DTS or AC3 but your work your choice but I dont want it thank you very much
,zimmy41,2012-05-10T16:00Z,Bad picture quality due to very low bitrate / high compression. Not really worth it. 
,elgh0st,2012-05-14T09:08Z,"""No offense but the video bitrate should be higher and the audio should not be AAC it should be DTS or AC3 but your work your choice but I dont want it thank you very much""

You don't really get the point of mkvGOD's submissions, do you? The entire point of these rips is to have a smaller file size, so naturally, the video bitrate is going to be much smaller, and DTS, alone, is massive compared to AAC.

And to all you people complaining about the source, can you read? mkvGOD specifically wrote ""WED-DL"" source, so why are you upset that this isn't a BD rip? Christ almighty, you people are fucking stupid."
