i have the lg 42lx6500 and i've been dealing with the same shitty situation now and then ... audio doesnt work or resolution aint right ...
im gonna try ur work and see if the quality doesnt go down to much ... if not ... then ur my new hero !! maybe its to early for a request :$ but is there any chance u can upload ( sharks 3d ) anyway ... ur the MAN !!!"
,andrewwk619,2011-06-09T21:32Z,"works really great !! no problems with audio or resolution :D but dont you think u could just keep the size the way they are ... u do see a bit of quality loss ... not that its horrible quality all of a sudden ... but i wouldnt mind downloading ur files that work great when they're 8 to 13 gig ... dont we downloaders all have a hard drive ;) 

anyways thank you so much !!! you're really helping me out with this ... and i bet lots of others ...

what is the program called u use 2 convert the audio ??"
[V],r3dcat,2011-06-11T12:41Z,I can recommend Xilisoft Video Convert Ultimate 6 for converting any files. The only SBS files I have had to use something else for were a few that had TrueHD audio which I had to use Clown BD (eac3to) to convert. If you have a problem getting a working reg/crack for Xilisoft Video Convert Ultimate 6 download and use a portable version which is what I had to do cause I found the reg/crack for normal install did not work after upgrading.
,andrewwk619,2011-06-12T12:41Z,"ive got the Xilisoft Video Convert Ultimate 6 ... it works, but it only lets me have a maximum of 720x570 video resolution ... i cant pick 1080p even though i'm adding a 3d mkv file with a 1080 resolution ... "
,andrewwk619,2011-06-13T19:08Z,"i've found a different program called ( Mp42Mkvac3 ) ... its very easy since i only have 2 add the file and the program converts it automaticly ... creates a new mkv file with ac3 audio ... works great !! and doesnt take down the resolution :D but thank you so much 4 inspiring me 2 look 4 a sollution once more ... now i can finally convert the 3d movies that didnt work ... and ive got a few :) world cup 2010 last airbender, i spit on your grave, drive angry, tron, dark forest and a few more ... also had it sometimes with normal movies wich probably have dts sound ... thanks again ... and keep up the good work ... its very well appreciated !!"

,zohaad,2011-08-09T18:42Z,"@andrewwk619 thank you very much for the program, I've been searching for nearly 4 days now. I'm downloading it."
,kuklei,2011-10-04T03:24Z,"Audio does not work on my LG 5500 3D TV either. Looks like it has something to do with the double frame rate converted to 47.952 from23.976. I know LG does not play DTS but I can convert to AC3 and Im all set, but this one is already in AC3. Any setting I need to tweak? I am able to play this file perfectly on my laptop but dont like to HDMI it to the TV in order to watch. USB is far more enjoyable. Any suggestion uploader? Thanks"
,kuklei,2011-10-04T16:15Z,"I was able to fix the audio problem that I had with my LG 55LW 3D TV.  As it turned out, my LG TV does not like the 64 bit rate for the audio stream. I used MeGUI to change only the audio channel using ""oneclick encode"" and deselected the option to encode the video. I set audio encode to one of the lowest presets for aften which was 192. It took 8mins and the movie now plays fine. Note: It did not play when I encoded the audio to the preset DVD quality which was 448kbits. Play with MeGUI and try to encode only audio and I think you will be able to make it work."
,kuklei,2011-10-06T00:54Z,"EDIT: Looks like the bit rate alone will not do it, but you must also select to change the sample rate. In this case I chose to re-sample to 48000Hz(48KHz)"
,Ponzu,2011-12-09T08:18Z,"Hi, I am using media server for PS3, and tried to play the movie but ""DATA CORRUPTED""
Any solution for this problem ?"
,howyeman,2012-01-27T21:31Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
