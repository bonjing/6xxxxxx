,Narok_Gull,2011-08-03T13:57Z,"I believe that credits must be given where credits are due and good work should be rewarded. So, if you really liked the content, consider supporting the producers and buy an original so they can continue to produce their stuff. Some have a very good quality and are quite affordable. It's a way to show our gratitude. Take it as a try before buy."

Thanks for this.
I have Spiral Eyes and Hypnotic Fun Vol. 1. Would you like me to upload those?
Also, you wouldn't have Vol. 3 would you?"

I have a problem, Sarah & Catherine downloaded at 800 kb/s. But this one is only downloading at 20. In spite of havign more seeders."
