,herblored,2011-07-11T16:38Z,"OK, so your shitty little picture tutorial only included how to do the easiest part of installing this game. I mounted and installed the game, then the first crack, and the second update. Everything is in the correct folder but why won't the game work without a CD? Isn't that the point of torrenting in the first place? I'll seed this once I get a response..."
