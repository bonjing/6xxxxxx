                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Scientists study the bones of Joseph Merrick, who developed disfigurements from an 
 early age and became well known after he escaped from freak shows to live out his life 
 at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Brian Richards, who suffers from the same 
 condition, Proteus syndrome, follows in his footsteps to discover more about one of 
 the most extraordinary figures of the Victorian era.
                         
                                 Enjoy!
