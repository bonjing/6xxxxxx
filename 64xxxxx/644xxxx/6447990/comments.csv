,Torx8,2011-06-06T08:48Z,so you cracked it yourself then you mean? sorry but i don't believe you.
,steve30x,2011-06-06T10:37Z,So the other demo's were fake? LOL I wonder how come one of the other fake demos was Duke Nukem Forever then?
,MorphzreaZ,2011-06-06T11:30Z,not wurth to play m8s.. demo is like 15min playtime lol..full version in 4 days so :P
,steve30x,2011-06-06T12:24Z,It took me less than 10 minutes to finish the demo 
,Spackfighter86,2011-06-06T14:31Z,"I found a release on tehparadox.com that looks like this and it worked (windows 7 32-bit). the archive with the cracked ""dukenukemdemo.exe"" , ""steamclient.dll"" and ""3DMGame.ini"" in the ""System"" folder. "
,xilonian,2011-06-06T15:32Z,I did not crack this. I merely got it from somewhere and decided to share. The other 2 demo's on here were labeled as fake by some people so I pt up this one. 
,terrorking24,2011-06-06T16:36Z,"not worth playing, it is just 10 minutes gameplay"
,zukke,2011-06-06T21:31Z,Still cool that they finally managed to finish the game... just after announcing it 28th of april 1997 ;) 
,afroebob1994,2011-06-07T17:50Z,Well I'm gonna DL it even if it's short cause I've been waiting a while and I want to at least get a feel for the engine. I'll confirm if it really is legit.
,Endetium,2011-06-08T00:16Z,it works. playing through the demo i get the impresion of the game being just simply good when i was expecting something along the lines of FUCKING AWESOME!!! However it is after all only a demo and the game in itself should not be judged by experiences gained by playing this demo. p.s after you are done with tedious and to be honest rather boring runthrough of the demo the cinematics afterwards will give you the impression of a FUCKING AWESOME!!! game. But yet again they are made for the sole reason of making the game look awesome so the game should not be judged on that basis.
,Sarkasmi,2011-06-08T00:29Z,"Yeah, this one works at least, had no problems :)
(Haven't tried the other ones, as one of them had the ridiculous crack.exe virus in it, that made me not even try it)

Only needed to download and run it. 

And it's not THAT short. I had at least half an hour of fun trying things. 

And to my surprise, it's not only the stadium matchup with the huge boss, as I thought, it also has another level with some monster truck driving and then looking for more gas. :)

It feels like Duke alright. Sure, it's not the most fluid experience I've had on the FPS front, but I'm not regretting my pre-order (from steam, so didn't get the First Access Club code, so thanks for the demo xilonian)

Some of the textures look waaaay outdated, but overall it looks good enough and .. hell, it looks better than it would've looked 12 years ago, so I'm not complaining. 

Can't wait for the full experience.. I bet there's a whole bunch of laughs to be had. I just hope it's not really short, as I'd hope for at least 10+hours after a decade of wait :D

Thanks!"
,wanda_5,2011-06-08T08:14Z,I personally didnt bother to download anything but the game. Works perfectly on Core i5 2500K & GTX 570.
,DannOrly,2011-06-09T00:03Z,Didn't work for me; keeps crashing and I get error report. Not sure if this is a system-side error (as in my PC sucks too bad to play the game) or a file error... 
,DannOrly,2011-06-09T00:15Z,"For the record, I looked into it a bit. I'm getting a ""EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION in module D3DDrv9.dll"" error. Seems a few people are getting this. Some have had success updating their DirectX or C++ or video card drivers. Sadly for me, all of those are up to date on my machine, so it looks like I won't be playing :("
,Sarkasmi,2011-06-09T05:50Z,"""EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION"" sounds like it could possibly be solved by ""Run as administrator""...

Dunno though, I haven't had such a problem. But sometimes some games tend to not work unless ran as admin for whatever reason. 

(Though sure, you might've already tried this.. so sorry if I'm stating the obvious :D) "
,Edmund111,2011-06-09T06:36Z,"The exe file does not open for me.  Stating my configuration is wrong and reinstalling the application may help.  

Any ideas???"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-06-10T00:18Z,"tested, real. works nicely. great game. truly looking forward to the full game. enjoy"
,holzy,2011-06-11T14:09Z,"Works!
But it's still a crappy demo. The full game is better.

Demo is about 10 months old (PAX 2010 in September)"
,showbizkid75,2011-06-11T17:22Z,DukeNukemForever.exe contains a virus
,xilonian,2011-06-11T21:43Z,"Here is an online virus report for the file:
http://www.viruschief.com/report.html?report_id=4f660416a6bd453242bd8d98b82f1a4e361ad62d

Also full game has come out from Razor1911 and Skidrow so why get the demo anymore?"
,Raywriter,2011-07-24T05:47Z,download it here before buying the game http://dukenukemforeverdemo.com/
