After enduring trials that would have crushed any other soul, Goku is now faced with the most important journey of his life. The Dragon Balls have been scattered to the ends of creation! The universe is dense with danger and the Saiyan hero must plunge head first into the peril, for if the seven magic relics of Shenron are not gathered within a year s time, Earth will meet with final catastrophe.
Alongside his friends, Pan and Trunks, Goku will struggle against the most formidable evils yet, be they savage beast with the power to crumble mountains, false gods intent on sacrificing those who believe, or cruel manipulators of science who seek to strip the good of all power. The countdown to oblivion has begun... And before the clock strikes eternal midnight, the most incredible menace to ever threaten existence will rise!
