,Mutha111,2011-06-16T09:15Z,"what kind of a crap is this...they are talking english and I get an english subtitle that is even diferent than what they are actualy saying...its like when hes saying> ``how does it feel to graduate oob``, in subtitle theres:``Oob was it fun``,,,"
,wayngrove,2011-06-27T20:24Z,"@mutha111, you have to change the audio to Japanese.  If you have English subs with English language, you get Funimation's butchering audio with the original Toei Doga Japanese script, translated verbatim to English through subtitles.  To get the original effect, put the Japanese audio on with the subs."
,userdownloader,2011-08-08T02:42Z,sounds gay i need English audio and no subs...ill keep looking
,OnePiecePirate,2012-03-18T04:33Z,"Am currently downloading--video/audio quality is nice. But it seems the opening/ending themes are not included...which I understand well the merits of skipping that. Anyways, thx! "
