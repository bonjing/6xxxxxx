[V],twentyforty,2011-06-03T19:14Z,"Is rating about the torrent or the content?
TPB is full of perfect torrents, they work great.
But - what if someone doesn't like the content, as ""Movie is bad"" or ""Stupid show"" or god-knows-what...

How can anyone know who and for what reason has pressed that ""-"" or ""plus""? In all fairness, no one. Counting on reason is definitely wish too far.

Therefore, humans invented writing, and people could discuss and exchange opinions. Hiding in darkness and hitting with iron pole from behind is what ""Quality"" button is used for.

I know that much.

Most important thing: ""spiritualiste"" is my friend, not because what he say, but because of what he have done and continues to do - setting the tone.

If somebody download my torrent and torrent as torrent works, I gave bytes away by that.
Pure manners imply saying Thank you.
If somebody give you something, isn't it uncivilized to say nothing. Bitching about gifts received is long time joke from dawn of all civilizations. Nobody could not do that, without been ridiculed.

So, if any person is NOT satisfied with quality of gift (oh, it really sounds stupid) - does by ""minusing"" quality performs revenge? Is that bitching about HIS OWN choice? ""I ate brown stuff for free and it makes me sick"" - after ravaging buffet-table?

LOL"
