,tekplyrx,2011-06-03T11:27Z,The zipped parts are incomplete.. there's no main zip part to unzip all the files... the problem with upload in parts. JUST UPLOAD ONE FILE!
[V],err0001,2011-06-03T17:43Z,"tekplyrx is more right than wrong.

This torrent is missing the 19 MB file named  almost.heroes.s01e01.hdtv.xvid-2hd.rar

Technically though, he is incorrect about one thing. These are RARed file not ZIPped files.

For the full torrent, try Torrentday.com. It is a good site and it is going private soon. So do yourself a favour and join now. It is easy to maintain your ratio - just leave your torrents seeding at a low speed, let your bonus points accumulate and convert your bonus points to upload credits!

Torrentday.com is the site related to the TPB uploader named TvTeam. However, unlike TvTeam, torrents come to the site earlier and are far better seeded.

,kevrain,2011-06-05T01:37Z,"Really, to upload and post an incomplete torrent, these green skulls must be freely available in every pack of breakfast wheaties. "
