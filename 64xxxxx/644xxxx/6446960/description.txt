BOOK INFO:

Modern astrophysics has evolved early phases of discovery and classification to a physics-oriented quest for answers to fundamental problems from cosmology to the origin and diversity of life-sustainable systems in the Universe. Future progress in modern astrophysics requires access to the electromagnetic spectrum in the broadest energy range. This book describes the fundamental problems in modern astrophysics that cannot progress without easy and wide-spread access to modern UV instrumentation.
