The soundtrack is mostly in Spanish, with a small amount of English, which is unsubtitled.

A rather bleak picture of a near future in Mexico.  A facade of benevolent social engineering is dangerously close to being exposed as a fraud.  Neo-liberals are running the country, but with a rather mean streak, and, in my opinion, not very liberal.  The homeless take the national spotlight, but is there really any movement behind their movement?

Alex Cox has a brief cameo, otherwise no stars that I can shake a finger at.
