,jsing,2011-06-03T09:08Z,Just wanted to thank you for putting up corrie.... I have been missing it soooo much as the corrie on ITV here in singapore is 4 years old!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Lostinasia,2011-06-03T09:14Z,"Finally got around to registering so I can thanks this guy so much.
I have watched Corrie for as long as I can remember and being able to keep up with it out here in the Far East, just hours after it is shown in the UK - is just the best.
Many people D/L this but not many thank you, for reliably getting this on TPB - on behalf of them and myself - Thanks Dean we REALLY do appreciate it."
