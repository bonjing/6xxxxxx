,kik6666,2011-06-05T14:51Z,"I think that the main character in this film is Jake Mason, father of Darius Mason in RF ARMAGEDDON, Jake also designed the REPAIR ability on the NANO FORGE - or atleast that's what I've heard"

A/10
V/10
Has SyFy logo in bottom right corner and there's the odd SyFy advert here and there, but this doesn't spoil the movie in anyway...
Many Thanx to extremezone and aAF for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"

,lievenazerty,2011-06-05T19:38Z,"Yeah it's just me, something got screwed up by copying to my NAS"
