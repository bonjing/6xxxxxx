This double live album is magic, from the first notes of Shine on You... to the celebrated guitar solo of On The Turning away, from the female backup voices on Money, to the rhythm of Run Like Hell. But this is probably the less interesting part of Floyd's career: big shows, pompous sound, high ideals but minor inspiration are the main characters of these Waters-less Floyds. However a must have. Complete booklet scans included.
