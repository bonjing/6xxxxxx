To the Sea is the fifth studio album by singer-songwriter Jack Johnson, released on May 26, 2010 in Japan, May 31, 2010 in the UK and June 1, 2010 in the United States. The album debuted at number 1 in the United States, selling 243,000 copies in its first week. Johnson said of the album\'s title I guess it\'s a reference to a father leading his son to the sea, with the water representing the subconscious. So it\'s about trying to go beneath the surface and understand yourself. To the Sea was released on Johnsonâ€™s own label, Brushfire Records, with the first single, You and Your Heart, already released on radio and iTunes.  (wikipedia)
