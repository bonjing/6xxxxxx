Review
by Ken Dryden
The first of a series of three albums made by the Great Jazz Trio during an extended stint at the Village Vanguard in early 1977 is one of their best efforts. Pianist Hank Jones, the consistent figure in a group whose personnel changed over time, is accompanied by the outstanding bassist Ron Carter and fiery drummer Tony Williams. What is surprising about the opener, "Moose the Mooche," is that it is an extended showcase for Williams, an unusual way to open a live recording. Next is a superb extended arrangement by Jones of John Coltrane's "Naima" that reveals new possibilities within this landmark ballad. Claus Ogerman's "Favors" is another choice that is off the beaten path, but the trio's thoughtful treatment makes the most of it. Finally, Carter's quirky hard bop vehicle "12+12" leaves the captivated audience wanting more. The total time for this once hard-to-find album (initially issued by the Japanese label East Wind and briefly available in the U.S. on the long defunct Inner City label, before finally being reissued on CD by Test of Time in 2005) is rather brief for a CD, but the performances more than make it worth acquiring.
