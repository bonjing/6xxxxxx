Description......: Through the stories of ordinary people and analysis from the worlds 
		   leading experts, The China Question explores the challenge America 
		   faces as China becomes the worlds second superpower. To understand 
		   the economic, political and moral implications of Chinas rise, 
		   filmmaker Brook Silva-Braga spent over a year traveling both China 
		   and America. On a thoughtful, personal journey into corners of the 
		   Peoples Republic often off-limits to western journalists we meet 
		   ordinary people dealing with extraordinary change, and reflect on 
		   the twists of fate and history that brought us here.
