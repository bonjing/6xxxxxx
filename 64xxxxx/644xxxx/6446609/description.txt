Is Shilpa Ray crazy? You may wonder after the spine-tingling Teenage and Torture, in which she shrieks and sneers stream-of-consciousness lyrics while playing harmonium. Her deranged aura aside, the second full-length from this New York group is a brainy and brawny hybrid, unleashing barbed commentary on consumer culture ("Stick It to the Woman") and female beauty ("Venus Shaver") with storming, bare-bones rock'n'roll powered by John Adamski's brutal drumming. Check out "Liquidation Sale" for a satisfying blast of primal-scream therapy.
