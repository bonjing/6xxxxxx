,wankan,2011-06-05T17:43Z,"One of Mr Chan's more serious films . I haven't seen it for a while .
FYI I just got Vlc(portable) to work properly on my netbook , at last :-) 
More preferable than Gom IMO ."
,wankan,2011-06-05T20:42Z,"Going to have to defer comment as Vlc portable audio now not working properly and back to Gom .
Only took 2 hours for the netbook to shoot itself in the foot :-("
,klimodni,2011-06-06T00:51Z,"Thanks wankan for your comment.
I really have no idea, why your vlc portable got audio working not properly.
any suggestion for my improvement in my next torrent, please?"
,klimodni,2011-06-06T03:23Z,if anyone is experiencing the same problem as Wankan?
