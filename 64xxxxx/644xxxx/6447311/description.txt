Roger Waters - Radio K.A.O.S. (Definitive Edition)

This is an expanded edition of Radio KAOS that was released years ago to the Echoes Pink Floyd mailing list. 
It fleshes out the concept far better by including tracks that were used as b-sides and the When The Wind Blows soundtrack.
It also uses some clever reconstructing of "Billy" towards the end to recreate the dialog used in the KAOS vhs home video and concerts.
