Area - International POPular Group, most commonly known as Area or AreA, is an Italian progressive rock, jazz fusion, electronic, experimental group[1] formed in 1972 by singer Demetrio Stratos and drummer Giulio Capiozzo. They are known for their left-wing adogmatic Socialist and Communist lyrics.

Maledetti is the fourth Area studio album released in 1976, fuses elements of all previous Area works and adds a pile of new qualities. As always, one observes Mediterranean/Balkan/Middle Eastern folk influences and avant-garde flourishing around the band's fusion-esque groundwork, a combination that yielded some very progressive listening. Certain explorations are deepened with the contribution of some other players: boosting the band's already phenomenal music are the performances of Paul Lytton (renowned jazz percussionist, on "Giro, giro, tondo") and Steve Lacy (one of the most hailed saxophonists ever, who plays on three of the songs). Both are big names in free jazz, though frankly and don't know much about them. But they definitely do wonderful things here.
