,GaMeRSKiLLZ,2011-06-03T12:19Z,This game works with PS2 Emulator or not? If its working on PS3 were to download a PS3 Emulator? Thanks in advance.
,tony795,2011-06-03T15:57Z,does this works on 3.41 
,ROKKERO,2011-06-03T20:52Z,"if this game doesnt have the modified eboot just download it!!!! 
and ""GAMER"" get some info first!  you need a hacked/modded PS3 if your PS3 is above 3.55 firmware forget it! and you cannot downgrade 3.56 good luck!!"
,GopherTee,2011-06-03T21:32Z,"In Reply to ROKKERO. You can't downgrade at the current date.  In the future it may be possible.  And it is a given that your PS3 needs to be jailbroken, isn't it?"

,Alexnader78,2011-06-05T11:36Z,"-Fully functional on Kmeaw 3.55, with MultiMan (lateste update V.2).
-DO NOT UPDATE TO 1.01, it will no longer work. If you did update, just go to GAME DATA folder on the XMB and delete the infamous 2 file, then start the game and click ""O: cancel update""."

,chnibi,2011-06-16T18:19Z,hello I've problem game works just fine but in first mission on swamps  when shows cut scene about healing people game start to frizing:/ pls help
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T05:21Z,@gamerskillz this is a ps3 game. There is no ps3 emu and will probably never be 1 considering the ps2 emu is still buggy after 10 years. Get a ps3 with 3.55 fw (3.56+ will not work with this) and jailbreak it. Google knows all.
,glupy,2011-06-19T08:08Z,"the included 3.55 patch did not work for me. use this one if it doesnt work for you too: http://www.theplaystationclub.com/downloads/

scroll down to game patches and click the infamous 2 3.55 one"
,hairyshit,2011-06-30T11:13Z,"Works fine with kmew3.55 and multiman 2.00.01 (external fat32 usb drive), just copy the ""eboot.bin"" file from the crack folder over the one in the ""\PS3_GAME\USRDIR"" folder, do not use the updates because they're designed for 3.56+."
,nikosmr,2011-07-05T20:30Z,Why does it say Type: Games>PS2 if it's for PS3?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

,oddman909,2011-09-23T16:26Z,"Detailed Solution How to get it To WoRk???

things you need=>
-3.55 custom firmware
-rogero manage
-comgenie awesome file manager

-put the downloaded game into external hard drive.(i am not using the FTP method).
-hard drive should be FAT32 (i assume you know how to FAT32 your hard drive).
-attach hard drive into usb port of PS3 and in comgenie awesome file manager go into advance mode , then copy from usbxxxx file with code like BLESxxxxxx to hdd000.

this is how i got mine working. ask me if i missed the something in detail."
