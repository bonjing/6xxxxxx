A space liner, with a large number of passengers aboard, is in difficulties while flying through
the atmosphere of an unknown planet. Amy and Rory have been spending some time on
board in the honeymoon suite and they quickly appear on deck. Amy calls the doctor for help
and the TARDIS soon appears ahead of the ship. However the Doctor cannot save them and
the only other option is to land on the planet below. There the Doctor meets a Scrooge like
figure by the name of Kazran Sardick, the only person that can save Amy, Rory and all the
other lives on the Spacecraft. The Doctor learns that the atmosphere surrounding the planet
is controlled by Kazran who is unwilling to help the liner. The only option to save the ship is
for the Doctor to persuade Kazran to save the liner himself..

courage as never before. Because this is the episode where A Good Man Goes to War.
