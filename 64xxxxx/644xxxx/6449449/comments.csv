,B.KITZ,2011-06-13T10:33Z,Thanks man ..... Highly rated .....
,Smuggles,2011-06-18T15:06Z,My favorite horror movie of all time in a small file and of excellent quality. Thank you so much.
,RickyTheFish,2011-06-24T11:50Z,"I cannot get the video to play - it crashes WMP and Media Player Classic, and it doesn't work in VLC, SMPlayer, DivX Plus Player, or Quicktime. Is there anything else I could try that might work?"
,flipperspit,2011-07-01T21:42Z,Good stuff. Looks and sounds great using VLC for me..
,Fallen_Gri,2011-07-12T19:47Z,I don't know why but after downloading this my explorer has become fucked. I can access any folder except for this one. Every time I click on it or even highlight it my windows crashes. I  can play it fine in utorrent but every time im in explorer it crashes wtf 0_0
,jrallah,2011-07-16T07:15Z,thanks
,paws6,2011-07-16T15:58Z,don't download this shit it fucked up my pc
,TurkishMasta,2011-08-02T03:55Z,"Tried this file with VLC Media player but there is a grey screen most of the time. Doesn't work with DivX Plus Player or Windows Media Player either. YIFY usually has quality uploads, I don't know what's wrong with this."
,santana,2011-08-25T10:14Z,"I have bought the book on which this movie is based. Its awesome! Mr Carpenter was quite fateful to the original story in his film adaptaion. If anyone is interested I will send you a scan of the book. Write to me at biggest.hendrix.fan@gmail.com
I will send scans via email because I cant be bothered learning how to upload torrents.  :P  Maybe one of you will do it after recieving my scans. Peace!"
,xSimpliiFy,2011-10-04T17:27Z,WTF...I have the same problem as Fallen_Gri. My windows explorer always crashes when I open the folder or even highlight it....might be corrupted.
,LmFa0,2011-10-08T11:53Z,"@everyone who's explorer crashes

there is not a problem in the movie, there a problem in your codec software. try disabling thumbnails for mkv format... "
,MarkoOhNo,2011-10-09T03:13Z,"Ugh... mkv file.... Why did I even bother trying. Mkv is a complete waste of downloading time. No burners recognize it and none of the supposed ""converters"" can convert mkv to avi without crashing. Same ol' story here. Deleting, uninstalling my converter, and steering FAR clear of mkv files from now on. Thanks anyway."
,PauloFran,2011-10-09T17:39Z,"Good video/audio quality for the file size.
Excellent movie!"
,endoii,2011-10-15T10:33Z,stop complaining and download the 480p version then! (which has an audio lag of about 30 seconds) lol...
,michaelrwatson,2011-10-15T19:03Z,"I agree w/ MarkoOhNo: MKV files are total shit, and only tards create them. Please use MP4 or AVI instead (or even .MOV for fuck's sake). Thanks. "
,kylea91,2011-10-23T20:23Z,"Funny how butthurt everyone gets about the file type..   .mkv's are playable by WMP, VLC, AND obviously DIVX plus media player.

All you need is the correct codec from one of these softwares, and after that either of the programs will play it without issue.

Your computer might be garb, so don't blame the uploader. 

A- 10
V- 10"
,S0L1DST4SH,2011-10-26T05:29Z,"What I dont get is why anyone would attempt to download something, see its in an undesirable format (to them), but then come back and waste your time commenting on it? ... Kyle91 is right, who still needs to put something on a disk in order to ... well... do anything at all ? "
,vavra222,2011-11-23T23:46Z,"Excellent rip. Good quality and it is so small!
Also my VLC works fine with EVERY format(even corrupted), no crashes, no lag.
Nothing bad happened when i opened that folder containing the movie.
Also mkv format is great because it can contain hi-quality audio and video and can be compressed into small size, you are just butthurt because your PC is fucked."
,rrpostal,2011-11-27T08:34Z,"I love MKV these days. My BluRay player can play it, so I can put great looking video without much space. Of course VLC works fine as well. If you don't use it, that's fine. But it's kind of stupid to claim that it's ""useless"" just because you don't like it for some reason."
,capt.kort,2011-12-10T20:27Z,thanks yify. i liked ur ups day by day.
,TnX-Zitex,2011-12-14T00:09Z,Best movie ever and thanks for Upload
,netnomad25,2011-12-17T21:43Z,"A and V = 9.5 (Had some small problems)
Great Movie!!"
,callmehawk,2011-12-27T22:28Z,"There is no ""book"" there was a short story called "" Who goes there"" that these movies are based on. There are thee films The Thing(now called ""The thing from another world"" after the Carpenter remake of it) 1951,The Carpenter remake and this one. Carpenter's remake was closer to the short story than the original."
,MikeQuest333,2011-12-28T18:31Z,"Thanks for uploading and to those seeding.
