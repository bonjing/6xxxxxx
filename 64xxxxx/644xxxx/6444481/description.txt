Below are screens of green pixel flashes that occur during the movie. This is from the screener source and not something I did wrong. These occur during the movie and are just small flashes.(like a fraction of a second) I had to try and pause the movie to get some screen shots.

You can down load over a 1 gig file like I did and have the same result. Just giving a heads up. Doesn't take away from watching the movie imo. Read comments from other uploads and this is mentioned in the comments but not by the uploaders.
