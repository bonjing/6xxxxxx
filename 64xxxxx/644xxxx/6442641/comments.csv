,InstantStarFan7,2011-06-26T21:56Z,"Thanks 4 the upload, but just so you all know the episodes are mislabeled. I just wanted ""Heart"" and it was ""Folsom Prison Blues."" Just in case anyone is only downloading certain eps they are not labeled correctly."
,InstantStarFan7,2011-06-27T00:15Z,"OK WHICH FREAKING EPISODE IS ""HEART""!?!?! I've download 3 already and none of them are it. Why are they all so wrongly mislabeled? This torrent has great quality but SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,holyfool,2011-08-02T11:44Z,much supa thanxxx!
,Spasmodean,2011-09-10T03:08Z,"Agree with InstantStarFan7; eps are not labeled correctly.  Still, big thanx for the upload, RiddlerA's mkv's don't stream seamlessly to my ps3. These work really well. I just need to spend a bit of time relabelling I guess lol"
