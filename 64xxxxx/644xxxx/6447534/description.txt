February 12, 2010  -"For all those who have Qwest internet service.........I Thank You! I have made the change to Norton Antivirus Online from the McAfee product and am very happy. No more lock-ups, slow file searches and program installation issues. Norton is the best PC Security product in the business, and I am glad to be back in the Norton family.

You have earned a Gold Medal."
