,Cal1n,2011-06-06T22:11Z,"Hi, just a quick question as I've not had this issue before. Running bittorrent 7.2.1 it's not displaying the correct seeders/leechers, rather it's saying 0 for seeds and 1 for peers (to which I can't seem to connect). The torrent's been open for a good 2 hours and I've tried updating the trackers...what gives? Never seen this before :("
,Cal1n,2011-06-06T22:17Z,"Great, I post a polite comment asking a question and you delete it. Fuck you asshole."
,Cal1n,2011-06-06T22:17Z,"^ummm, oops."

,jwatsn317,2011-06-07T13:39Z,"When downloading, its coming in as a .mkv file? anyone else?"
,dapipo,2011-06-07T15:46Z,"@jwatsn317

It's supposed to be an MKV file. doesn't ""720p HDTV x264"" ring a bell? -.-

Anyway... open it with VLC or similar, and you're good to go!"
,HeyYou88,2011-06-07T17:50Z,".mkv is shite, you can't play it on PS3. "
,spot01,2011-06-07T20:21Z,"Thanks again
you can always be relied on for good torrents"
,cheo2010,2011-06-07T22:55Z,Thanks a lot.
,ofb,2011-06-07T23:04Z,"Thanks again eztv, I always look for your ""Game of Thrones"" episode every Monday/Tuesday. Your files always the best quality, and in a single file. Fantastic series!! :)"
,ofb,2011-06-07T23:08Z,"HeyYou88  .mkv is a great format, but if you need to convert it to a different format, just use a free converter program called ""anyvideoconverter"" just google it.."
,nitrox264,2011-06-08T01:17Z,Thank you
,peaver666,2011-06-08T19:42Z,"thx again, you are the king of the king of thrones.

Perfect quality as ever."
,prime311,2011-06-09T03:40Z,Thanks!  And this does work on PS3 I play it on mine.  Might need to switch from mencoder to avisynth/ffmpeg though.  
,meepsmeep,2011-06-09T04:21Z,"You know when over 4000 people have this, but only a tiny fraction seed afterwards...?

That's what we call bollocks, kids."
,SolaceG,2011-06-11T00:14Z,"um yeah whether or not a gaming console can play it isn't his concern. Get a WD HDTV live or be willing to convert. But dont complain here to the guy who gave it to you for free. Fantastic Up mate, ty. "
,ImNoMyth,2011-06-12T19:32Z,"Has anyone else had a sort of lag problem using PS3 Media Server to play this?  I know it's not the file because it plays fine on my PC, but when I stream it to my PS3 the video is almost like it's in slow motion but audio is fine?  I've messed around with Transcoder settings and made sure that I have the latest versions...any ideas?  All other mkv files play fine."
