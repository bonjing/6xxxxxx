[V],thethingy,2011-06-04T07:02Z,"the contend is basically fonts and adobe read me pdf's, nothing special I dont think but if you have the adobe download then this makes it retail. "
,innocentsoul,2011-06-08T02:27Z,"he thingy, could u please tell me if u have any training dvds of adobe premium cs5"
,R2d6.51,2011-06-14T22:50Z,"FYI:

For the benefit of those like "" innocentsoul"" below asking Thingy on what other apps were available; do this to save Thingy & yourself time & 4 future reference.

Simply look under the ""uploaded by"" tag & click the uploaders name & that will take you to the webpage that has all of the listings for what they have available for DL on PB.

 That's what I did for which Thingy has a lot of other great productivity software & training stuff available.

 Thingy is Kudos A++ & all that horseradish.

Saves you & the up-loader significant time answering questions all the time & you wondering & waiting for an answer, don't you think...Duh!"

I got a question, I was trying to get the CS5.5 Web Premium but I can't find it, the only torrent I found on the internet says it's bee downloaded as trial :/ It is US-GB(UK) and I need to know if I download it and apply this content to it, will it make it retail? Also I can use the activations instructions from your other torrents, right?"
