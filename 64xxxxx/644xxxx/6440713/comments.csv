,jt95,2011-06-02T12:02Z,what program launched seven up?
,limon-aide,2011-07-06T09:18Z,"the only thing you have to do is making sure you have the right build and replacing the talk.dll and the .exe (while trillian is not running)

works like a charm, but when can we expect the update to be cracked?"
,Rang3r187,2011-07-20T19:18Z,"@limon, use the v5.0.34 on demonoid. Seems to work the best. ;)"
,freedomdwarf,2011-10-07T12:39Z,"For the sake of a few small ads in a chat window, why even risk this sort of torrent?
Trillian is *FREE* from the official developers - nothing is restricted any more.
Latest build is v5.1 build 11 so this one (or the patch) may not even work for FaceBook, G+ or Skype as they have changed the connection.
And unless you buy a Pro license and opt for the cloud sync your info is NOT stored on their servers! The Ads have been greatly reduced too.
Audio/Video/cam doesn't work on most mediums tho so don't be fooled with false claims."
