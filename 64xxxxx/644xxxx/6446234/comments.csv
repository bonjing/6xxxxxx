,bryan_202,2011-06-05T16:26Z,fake fake fake fake
,kely88,2011-06-05T16:40Z,"Well, the clonedvd is already out for DNF..."
,bryan_202,2011-06-05T16:44Z,fake
,Tuwy,2011-06-05T21:44Z,"I don't know whether this torrent is fake or not (I haven't tried it myself), but it probably is. 

But the important thing is this: Do NOT listen to bryan_202 and absolutely do NOT download his torrent. It's proven to be fake. You get a BSOD once you run his crack.

I repeat: Do NOT listen to anything that bryan_202 writes."
,Sedating,2011-06-05T22:39Z,"Greetings TPB.

I am in the process of running it. I will let you know how it fares. What I have seen so far:

The backsplash for the installer is of Duke holding a warthog's head, and the theme song for DNF is playing during the installation. The language is in Russian, so make your best guess as to what each word stands for."
,Sedating,2011-06-05T22:49Z,"Just completed the first mission (Cyclops in the stadium map). No graphical issues, no crashes, but the core file (RUN_DNFD.EXE) does register as a virus. I'd say it is a false positive."
,Sedating,2011-06-05T23:06Z,Completed the second mission. This demo is running flawlessly.
,bradkilk,2011-06-05T23:35Z,"although the install is in russian, the rest of the game is in english! Thanks NiGHt-LEshiY!!!"
,Otaku7247,2011-06-06T00:00Z,English?
,supernapalm,2011-06-06T00:09Z,"Look, can a trusted or vip confirm any of these are actually real?

False positives are fine but all the ones I've downloaded so far are fake or just has the steam files with no crack and the comments in said torrents saying ""TOTALLY WORKING LOL111!!"" "
,drfunkm,2011-06-06T02:50Z,dont believe bryon_202 he is being troll... THIS SHIT WORKS GREAT!! avast is seeing it as false positive so i ran the file in executable and WALA ENGLISH DUKE NUKEM FOREVER DEMO!

,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-06T08:03Z,"It is NOT a fake, and there is NO virus. It's no-Steam.ru release, which has great reputation in cracked games.
I wish all the best for people, who just give their thanks to us."
,drfunkm,2011-06-06T14:55Z,"thank you NiGHt-LEshiY you were the first person to deliver this working demo cracked to the masses and trust me i was looking hard!

everything is all good big ups to NiGHt-LEshiY and no-steam.ru!

as for the game after waiting this long..... not quite as good as i had hoped, hopefuly the full game is better, i was getting graphical glitches like crazy and the controls feel a bit light, also the guns don't really feel that powerful, we shall see... hopefuly the full game lives up to its name!"
,zukke,2011-06-06T21:32Z,Still cool that they finally managed to finish the game... just after announcing it 28th of april 1997 ;) 
,D4rck_Ghost,2011-06-08T04:36Z,"dam it, downloaded the other 2 torrets of this demo-game and both won't start...hope that is cause i got no steam instaled on my pc

either way i got my original copy of this game already ordered so :P

steam is crap!
 real men buy real games!"
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-08T06:45Z,"@D4rck_Ghost,
_this_ game works on all PCs and you don't have to install anything else (except for MSVC++ Redist, but it's already installed on many computers)."
,bugme48,2011-06-08T12:49Z,"@D4rck_Ghost, install all from folder Redist."
,fascinum,2011-06-09T11:14Z,Спасибо!
,Paradise12314,2011-06-10T15:05Z,"Guys, I have just downloaded this and I can confirm it is clean. I installed it, the installer is Russian but the game is English. NO CRACKS ARE NEEDED. The game plays great also."
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-06-11T08:56Z,"Yeah, the King returns!
Now try our no-steam Duke Nukem Forever (FULL VERSION): http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6461136"
,Raywriter,2011-07-24T05:46Z,Yeah it sucks for people that want to try to demo just download it here before buying the game http://dukenukemforeverdemo.com/
