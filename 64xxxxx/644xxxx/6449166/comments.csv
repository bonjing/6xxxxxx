Roger Federer is always a lot of fun to watch. :)"
,lrotger,2011-06-06T19:25Z,I like the torrent but why are you such a fucking retard splitting the file in pieces? What's the use? Can't you understand we are not living in the 90s anymore? To watch this I (and everyone) have to undo your stupidity and because of that I will certainly not keep your disaster in my disk. I will not be seeding this after it finishes.
