    HTML5 Graphics and Animation with Canvas

    Author: Joe Marini



    One of the most exciting additions that HTML5 offers to designers

    is the ability to draw free-form graphics on a drawing surface

    known as the Canvas. In this course, author Joe Marini introduces

    the technical concepts behind Canvas and shows how to perform

    drawing operations directly in a web page. The course covers

    drawing basic and complex shapes, setting colors and styles,

    adding shadows, patterns, and gradients, more advanced techniques

    such as scaling, rotating, and compositing objects, and how to

    incorporate Canvas elements in a slideshow and an animation.

    Exercise files are included with the course.





    Topics include:



    * Understanding the differences between Canvas and SVG Graphics

    * Drawing shapes

    * Drawing arcs and paths

    * Rendering text

    * Using clipping paths

    * Drawing images and video

    * Transforming objects with the translate tag

    * Manipulating raw pixels

    * Applying a custom transformation

    * Creating an animation or slideshow control with Canvas
