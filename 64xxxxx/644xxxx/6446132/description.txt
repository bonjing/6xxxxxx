Synopsis.........: Produced with the cooperation of leading Civil War historian Winston Groom, author of Forrest Gump, 
		   GRANT AND LEE is a personal look at two iconic leaders of the Civil War. Surprising details reveal 
		   the bold choices and almost godlike power Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee summoned on decisive 
		   battlefields like Vicksburg and Gettysburg that, within days of each other, turned the tide of the 
		   war. This special features a unique perspective, exploring how these men changed the course of 
		   American history.

Proper Notes.....: Let's see...first off, CRiMSON's release has a commercial from 22m40s-22m50s. Their release is
		   also overcropped on the bottom. Last but not least, there are interlacing artifacts throughout the
		   release. Nearly every interview scene has artifacts on the face and hands of the interviewee.
		   You're probably wondering how you could possibly get interlacing artifacts from a progressive
		   source. Personally, I would assume that CRiMSON's release is from an analog source. In the provided
		   screenshot comparison you'll notice that the face on CRiMSON's release is unusually red and blurry
		   in addition to the guy's hand being completely interlaced. If you'd like to check for yourself, the
		   time stamp for those screenshots are 1.15.12 (CRiMSON) and 1.15.05 (DiVERGE).
