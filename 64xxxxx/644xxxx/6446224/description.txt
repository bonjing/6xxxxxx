Quote:
"Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth." Those are the words of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the world's first consulting detective, yet even he finds his skills tested to their limit as he and his erstwhile comrade Dr. John Watson are confronted with the most extraordinary case of their career â€“ the dead are returning to life! Can a plague of Biblical proportions be far behind for Victorian London? And who â€“ or what â€“ is behind the resurrection of these ravenous revenants?"
