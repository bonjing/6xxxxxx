- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

Light and airy, filmic but intimate, delicately arranged but deceptively
powerful, Suck It and See is Arctic MonkeysÂ’ fourth album. Recorded at Sound
City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer and collaborator James
Ford, it has a summery pop feel--the sound of some out of season sun for the
boys, with most of the work done on the West Coast in January.

HAPPY 9TH BIRTHDAY FNT!
