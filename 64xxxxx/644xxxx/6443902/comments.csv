You download the show it with utorrent/ then download the program ""winrar"" to extract the file / then klick on the first ro00  or ro1 and choose extract here and the ""winrar program creates a whole movie in xvid that you can watch with your vlc player or any other player  that can play xvid .  
Good luck :)"
