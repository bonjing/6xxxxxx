Tomb raider Fading light created by Michael Allan (aka Cowboy)
Lara mysteriously finds herself in New Orleans where she soon hears rumour about vast numbers of undead rising. Lara fearing that the legendary heart of Davey Jonesâ€™ has been found searches for the local Voodoo queen, Louise-Isabelle Villette whom she fears has the heart that is said to raise undead.
This project is based on the original ideas for TR4 gold that was designed in the San Francisco office of Eidos by Phil Campbell, Rebecca Shearin, and Gary LaRochelle. Unfortunately the original game was cancelled however the level editor was released instead.
This is a TR4/TR5 style game with very nice graphics & an Angel of Darkness style Lara without the crappy controls. Map Xpadder (Incuded) to suit your game controller.
If your a Tomb Raider fan, I know you will enjoy this game.
NOTE: some graphics cards may not be able to play this game; I used GeForce 210 on one PC, & on another PC GeForce 220, worked perfectly.
Worked on XP 32bit & GeForce GT220 on Windows 7 64bit.
