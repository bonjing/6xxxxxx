... about the release ...

i like how although is on the same engine as TR 4 , the look is more as TR 6 combined with TR 7 ... but the graphics are pretty good  .. if u're a fan u should play this ... thank you man ... and i'll let u know if i find some bugs"
,xplor3r,2011-06-06T18:05Z,"... and i can't wait no more for ...
