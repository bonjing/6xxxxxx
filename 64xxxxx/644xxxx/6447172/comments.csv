,Amjad_1990,2011-06-05T20:30Z,Thanks +1
,ManLemon,2011-06-05T20:32Z,"Thanks man, been reading about this and it will probably never appear on TV in my country anyway. Thanks again for all the work you're putting into these torrents :D"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-06T17:37Z,"IMDB is the same as wiki. They both can be modified by anyone. Its easier and faster to check wiki so I use that. Change it if you don't like it.

[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-06T17:38Z,"And the titles you want are the re-aired titles, I have used the originals"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-07T03:33Z,There are no excuses. This is complete and titled correctly by the original aired titles. Stop complaining and don't download if you don't like it. Or just change the names...all the files are here...no one is stopping you from making the names whatever you want! You are complaining about nothing
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-07T11:05Z,There was no mistake...they are named after the original airing. All files are there! There is nothing to complain about!
,gabe2011,2011-06-07T18:57Z,"Dude shut up paranoia. I don't see any torrent for you so how about you close your ungrateful ass and fuck off, eh? mkvGod is pretty amazing once you think of all the clean complete seasons he has posted for YOUR enjoyment. If you don't want, then search for it somehwere else. 

Plus he already posted that he does tons of files every day, its not like its on purpose. Piss off asshole."
