,maangaster,2011-06-04T20:03Z,i just wanna ask if this game also updates? i heard there's a new chapter called Beach Volley and was released last May..
,xplor3r,2011-06-04T22:46Z,"as far as it is by now it has 3 out of 6 chapters :

chapter 1 - smugglers den
chapter 2 - jungle escape
chapter 3 - beach volley

for chapters 4,5,6 , those are not available yet 
( it says coming soon ) 


.... right now i'm on chapter 2 and stuck on a stage ... anyway , i'll post any info updates as soon as i'll finish the second chapter ( guessing i'll pass the chapter ) "
,Sasha9115,2011-06-05T08:32Z,"I'm new at this and read the comments below but still not grasping it, Could someone please send me a message on how to do the patch please? My yahoo/email is Sasha1822"
,xplor3r,2011-06-05T09:21Z,"@ Sasha9115 

- install the game first .
- after that copy the patch where you have installed the game .
- and now just click the button patch on the patch application .
- now start the game and register the game using the provided serial number .
- play !"
,maangaster,2011-06-05T09:23Z,"@ xplor3r - installed this game but it doesn't have Beach Volley.

@ Sasha9115 - paste the patch on the installation folder then run it.."
,xplor3r,2011-06-05T09:35Z,"If you want my saved game for the first 2 chapters of the game , here it is ... i'm on the third now ... so if you find it difficult you may find this save game usefull .

,maangaster,2011-06-05T12:03Z,"@ xplor3r - thanks!! maybe something went wrong but i re-install it again, it works fine now, i hope there'd be another update for a new chapter.. :)"
,xplor3r,2011-06-05T12:50Z,"well glad u've managed ... also there's a lot a versions with ANGRY BIRDS , but none of them full ... but for those of you here's the full version .

Why is the full version ?  Well , the version that is around the net has only 4 chapters , but the full version has 5 chapters ... so here's my version , just download it from here

http://image.bayimg.com/maikiaadh.jpg

- as a note , if u already have ANGRY BIRDS installed on ur pc , make sure u delete the save game folder ( it has something to do with different versions ... u can also back-up ur saved games ) , example for xp users ( for vista and 7 search for them ) ... just delete the entire ANGRY BIRDS folder from Rovio ... and remember to enable view hidden files option 

C:\Documents and Settings\userpc-name\Application Data\Rovio


Install Notes :

- install
- apply patch 
- register using the key
- play"
,xplor3r,2011-06-05T12:52Z,"@ acer47x

download the full version from here

.. that chapter u ask for is the 5th chapter missing from the regular version of ANGRY BIRDS ... so follow the instructions and u'll have the full game"
,xplor3r,2011-06-05T14:42Z,"and here it is ... my saved game for this version of game Angry.Birds.Rio.v1.1.0-THETA  ... the 3 chapters finished ... i was just playing to finish the chapters ( not getting all the stuffs ) ... for those of you who could't get through over a stage or something , u can use my saved game .

- make sure to back-up urs as well
- u cand add it in  C:\Documents and Settings\userpc-name\Application Data\Rovio
- depending on ur operating system search for your files ( choose to see hidden files )
