,xidio,2011-06-06T21:08Z,"""810p"" how about using the p label correctly.
It only applies to 240, 360, 480, 720 and 1080.
Nothing else."

Read once in your life so you don't need to look like one :)"
,xidio,2011-06-09T22:54Z,"Still, there is no such thing called ""810p"" you simply call it 810.. you dont call the ""1200"" in 1920x1200 as ""1200p"" neither for 1440 or any other."
