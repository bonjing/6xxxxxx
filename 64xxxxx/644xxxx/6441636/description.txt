Hard to find single season tv show from 1969-70 about a newspaper reporter who chucks it all to travel the country on a Sporty, finding adventure along the way.
Good companion to the movie by the same name that was the pilot for this, which is available here as well.  Picture quality will be typical for 40 year old prints with washed out color, but still watchable for those of us who remember it from the first time around.
