Video: Russian DVD-9

Hanna.sovershennoe.oruzhie.2011.DVD9

Audio: EP1C

thx



Encode:

well that was a load of work. The Quality of the DVD was ok.

Added sharpness,chroma,rgb,denoise and brightness.

Audio had a static hiss and noise throughout, cleaned that best as possible. dont wanted to go over and remove more or the audio gets muffled, but its much better know.

Wasnt happy with the sync, was oose on various spots and it didnt meet my hiqh quality lipsync standard.

So i had to do a complete resync of the cleaned track.

Subs also delayed it a lot. The Russian DVD had russian subs for all foreign parts on the disc, so i extracted them to get the original timeframe places for the subs in the movie.

I translated all german parts myself, since i speak german no problem for me at all. 

i took the arabic and spanish translation parts from EP1C      s version, hey i cant speak all languages 

so thx for that parts.

looks very good now



btw i replaced the first 2 mins with the russian effects in the front channels since there is no voice, sounds much better at the introduction and you cant hear the remaining hiss right at the beginning 



Like always my Audio fits on any direct-encode from the dvd-9

enjoy
