,ha-nocri,2011-08-28T13:45Z,"Hey, do you have the new version perhaps (12, preferably MP)? It has a structural equation module that I desperately need.. Thanks so much for the good work."
,rithcee88,2011-09-07T16:59Z,"sorry, I'm not really a tech savvy person, but i can't get it to work. I put the ""static.lic"" file into this state folder, and installed it, but it's still asking for a code and key. any help appreciated, thanks."
,mupp2,2011-09-16T17:17Z,Thanks so much for this SloveniaX! download worked great. can't seem to find the license file... are the links dead??? any help would be greatly appreciated.
,mupp2,2011-09-16T22:23Z,disregard my earlier post. all is good... Thanks!
,SloveniaX,2011-09-17T23:49Z,"@rithcee88: sorry, I've got no clue what you might be doing wrong (install stata first, THEN put the license file in the appropriate folder where you installed it) - as you can see, it works for other people..."
,rottenmilk,2011-09-18T04:18Z,"Tried to run a reg and coefficient table not found, returned 'compiled by Stata 11.2, is too new to be run by this version of Stata and so was ignored'. Any thoughts?"
,rottenmilk,2011-09-18T04:32Z,Disregard my last post. Thanks!
,SloveniaX,2011-09-22T23:22Z,"for anyone that wants the MP version: http://www.stata.com/support/updates/stata11/mac/ (follow the instructions in this torrent, then just do what the website tells you to and you should be fine). haven't tested this in OSX myself (works great in Win though)..."
,gmmsmack,2011-10-05T06:01Z,Somebody must have Stata 12 by now?
