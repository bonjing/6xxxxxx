Storyline: Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy, friendless teenage girl abused by her insanely religious mother, Margaret (Piper Laurie). The girls at Bates High School also harass Carrie, with Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen) being especially cruel.Carrie experiences her first period while showering after gym class, and, due to her sheltered life, becomes hysterical, thinking she is dying. Popular girl Sue Snell (Amy Irving) notices Carrie's horror, leading to the other girls throwing tampons and sanitary pads at her before Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) intervenes. As Carrie becomes more frantic, a light bulb bursts just before Miss Collins tells the other girls to leave. Miss Collins brings Carrie to the principal's office, and while consoling her, the principal calls Carrie by the wrong name, inadvertently emphasizing how overlooked she is. When Carrie corrects the principal and exclaims "it's Carrie!", an ashtray from the principal's desk flips onto the floor. Later, while Carrie is walking home, a neighborhood boy crashes his bicycle immediately after taunting her.
