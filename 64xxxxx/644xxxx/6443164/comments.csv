,DctrEvil,2012-01-30T19:02Z,"Much of his work is modernist-bleeding heart-danielle steele romantic shit. There were maybe two books he has written that would be considered ""readable"", though I don't know about ""good"". He is like a male Rowling. Yes, he should be applauded for his support of TPB...but you shouldn't pretend that his work is good when it isn't. I mean, he insists that his books be translated into spanish, for fuck's sake! Good writers don't DO that!"
,8Infinit,2012-02-02T18:19Z,"I can't tell if DctrEvil is being a troll, but Paulo Coelho's books cannot be compared to romance trash. They are written in relatively simple language, but they are very well done.

As for the language issue: What are you smoking? The English versions are translations from Portuguese! And considering he's from South America, having books translated to Spanish is just plain obvious."
,Justmetoo,2012-04-30T10:55Z,@DctrEvil You are an ignorant imbecile that has no idea what you're fucking talking about. Have you even read any of his books?
