Director's Cut = longer & soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith

Theatrical = shorter & soundtrack by Tangerine Dream

Also, screencaps?"

Director's cut was never released neither in BluRay nor as HDTV

""Universal has released a Blu-ray version of the ""Ultimate Edition"" on May 31, 2011, which carries over all the content from the DVD, including the Jerry Goldsmith-scored ""Director's Cut"" and the Tangerine Dream-scored theatrical version.""
