,Night_89,2011-06-05T08:37Z,"thanks
are you going to re-upload jericho or I should download the one existed?
and if you are going to, when?"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-05T10:59Z,New Jericho will be up VERY soon!
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T12:58Z,"Are you uploading the fixed Mad Men episode [ s2e13 Meditations in an Emergency] that faults out half-way though?

btw, I was really surprised by the great quality, and that must have took days/a week or more to encode."
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T13:01Z,"*days or a week or more to encode the full 4 seasons of Mad Men, and not to mention Deadwood. Either that, or you have a super computer/s to use for your encoding..."
[V],mkvGOD,2011-06-07T23:17Z,"@pjsmoke

I have re-uploaded Mad Men and Breaking Bad and fixed their problems. And yes it takes a while to encode"
,DarkVOX,2011-09-10T02:45Z,"Since it's compressed, is there quality loss?  I remember downloading a Code Geass 720 MKV that was compressed, but it was definitely bitrate starved.  You could see it was all blocky and pixelated."
,spiritualiste,2011-09-24T21:31Z,"Thanks you very very much for your superb encode/upload work...this is TOP quality...
