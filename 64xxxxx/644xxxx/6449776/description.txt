A nice oldschool dance release I found second-hand. The two CDs were rather scratched and chipped, but the only serious impact on sound quality I've noticed so far are some scratchy sounds on track 08 of CD 1.

v2 update: Replaced track 08 of CD 1 with another 320kbps MP3 I found which does not have any corruption from scratches. There may still be some loss on other tracks, though I haven't heard it so far.

Enjoy, and please seed when you are done! :)
