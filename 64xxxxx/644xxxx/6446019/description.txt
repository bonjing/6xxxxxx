Changes coming with this patch:

- A codex entry that helps unlock the Archaeologist achievement is now 
  easier to acquire in the Viscount's Keep during the first year in Kirkwall.

- In many fights, enemies now move less quickly at the start of combat. 
  This slower initial pace makes tactical positioning more useful and important.

- If the force of an enemy attack interrupts a party member's current 
  action, the party member now resumes the action once he or she has recovered.

  need to be told to consume a health potion again if they are interrupted.

- Enemies are now much less likely to explode into body parts upon death.

- Attacks that hit a stealthed assassin are now more likely to disrupt stealth.

- Abilities that apply a silence effect now also cancel the target's current 
  action in addition to preventing the target from using further abilities.

- When an enemy wakes from a sleep effect due to suffering damage, other status 
  effects that were applied by the same ability that caused the sleep effect 
  are no longer removed at the same time.

- Items that bear the property "100% of basic attack damage vs. enemies that 
  attack in melee" no longer harm the user when equipped in conjunction with 
  abilities like Blood Magic or Sacrificial Frenzy that reduce the user's health.

- The items known as Final Thought, Sataareth, Sundering, and Trepanner's 
  Gift now have damage types that match their elemental damage bonuses.

- The items known as Allure's Crook, Corrupted Acolyte's Staff, Defender of 
  the Wall, Void's Hammer, and Volcanic Shield can now only be equipped by 
  the appropriate classes.

- The high dragon's fireballs no longer track moving targets.

- The size of the area affected by an ability is now explicitly described as

  inscribed on his or her old armor now carry over to the new armor.

- It is no longer possible to create more than one Elixir of Heroism.

- It is no longer possible to simultaneously enable sustained modes that 
  are supposed to be mutually exclusive.

- In some cases, enemies would freeze while entering combat. This no longer 
  occurs.

- In some cases, saw traps or spike traps would throw party members back even 
  when the trap was not visible. This no longer occurs.

  items but cannot be opened.

  main campaign.

  follows his master more reliably.

QUESTS (SPOILER WARNING)

- "Who Needs Rescuing" can now be completed.

- "Friendly Concern" is now available after consummating a romance.

- In "Act of Mercy," Thrask can no longer die, which could block completion.

- In "A Murder of Crows," it is now always possible to fight the varterral.

- In "A New Path," Merrill no longer remains locked in the party after the quest.

- In "Bait and Switch," the chest in the abandoned house can now always be opened.

- In "Demands of the Qun," Aveline's guards no longer turn hostile if the player 
  declines to enter the Qunari compound during the day and then returns at night.

- In "Dissent," it is no longer possible to loot Ser Alrik's body before the 
  appropriate time. This ensures that the quest can always be completed.

- In "No Rest for the Wicked," Isabela now always begins the opening conversation 
  at the appropriate time.

  father even if she is not currently in the party.

- In "The Last Straw," Anders now responds much differently if he is a rival.

  supposed to be stunned. This prevents a subsequent issue where the game could 
  freeze after loading the post-campaign save.

- Various minor story-scripting issues no longer occur.

FUNCTIONALITY

- Users with a large number of promotional items were timing out when attempting 
  to log in. This no longer occurs.

  66 resource varieties, including resources purchased from the Black Emporium.

- A codex entry that helps unlock the Archaeologist achievement or trophy is now 
  easier to acquire in the Viscount's Keep during the first year in Kirkwall.

- In the tactics menu, actions that use Items no longer become blank.

- Various minor art issues no longer occur.

  highlighting on usable objects, similar to holding down the tab key. To 
  reduce clutter, however, this setting does not highlight characters.

  Disabling this setting improves framerate but makes it more difficult to 
  highlight characters or objects in some situations.

- The DirectX 11 renderer is now disabled if your video-card drivers are older 
  than version 11.4 (for AMD cards) or 267.14 (for NVIDIA cards).

  to English upon installing a patch.

BALANCE

NOTE: Patch 1.03 introduces significant changes to the overall balance of the 
      game, improving the strategic elements and making combat and class 
      progression more engaging and enjoyable for players. Here is a detailed 
      summary of the balance-related improvements:

- Enemies' basic attacks now apply much less force, which means that party 
  members' actions are not interrupted as frequently.

- The secondary attribute requirement for equipping armor or shields 
  (constitution for warriors, willpower for mages, and cunning for rogues) is 
  now significantly smaller.

- The rate at which rogues regenerate stamina while performing basic attacks 
  has been significantly increased. Rogues now regain 1% of their stamina per 
  hit with dual weapons or 2% per hit with a bow.

- Traps no longer inflict injuries.

- Enemies now gain more health as the game progresses.

- Enemy assassins now have less health.

  a single hit, and boss-rank enemies cannot lose more than 20%.

- Enemy commanders now occasionally throw stun grenades while encouraging their 
  troops to concentrate attacks against a single party member. Previously, this 
  behavior was limited to nightmare difficulty.

  displays values of up to 100%, but characters now suffer 5% damage from an 
  attack even if they show 100% resistance.

  in the codex, instead of only 25%.

- The Rune of Valiance now provides a +2 bonus to all attributes instead of a 
  variable bonus that could rise as high as +7. As well, equipping and unequipping 
  multiple pieces of armor that each bear a Rune of Valiance no longer results in 
  incorrect attribute scores.

- Items that improve the Blood Magic cost ratio now provide 0.25 mana per point 
  of health instead of 1 mana.

- On hard and nightmare difficulties, status effects now persist on enemies for a 
  slightly longer duration.

- On nightmare difficulty, enemies now inflict more damage than before.

  from warriors' basic attacks.

  STAGGER normal enemies instead of 40%.

  within range of the attack who were not targeted directly. The primary 
  target is still automatically STAGGERED, but other normal enemies within range 
  have a 40% chance to STAGGER.

  other rogues and mages within a 10m diameter.

  canceled. The Blood Spatter upgrade now inflicts damage equal to 75% of the 
  victim's maximum health upon explosion instead of 100%, within a 4m radius. 
  As well, the spell description now displays this information.

- The blood mage's Grave Robber spell now affects a 12m diameter instead of 6m 
  in order to make the ability more useful. The One Foot In upgrade now 
  inflicts 100% of the mage's maximum health in damage instead of 10%.
