Not to seem like an ungrateful bastard (which I'm not), but is there any workaround or crack coming for that, please?"
,quirkynature,2011-06-05T15:01Z,"Oh, and thanks rlf-rls. Appreciate the upload."
[T],rlf-rls,2011-06-05T16:03Z,I can't tell but it's possible and this is the last update so i don't think that u find different crack
,ragingdemon17,2011-06-06T14:06Z,@ rlf-rls any difference between your version and chris aksl's version?
,Kirnath,2011-07-25T00:47Z,"Forgive my ignorance, but to which folder do I copy the files to? 

The game is updated but I know I can't play with out it being authenticated through their servers, does this patch take care of that issue?"
,Kirnath,2011-07-25T00:53Z,"never mind, I decided to go with a repack of teh game you can download here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6445669/Dragon_Age_2_Complete_DLC_Re-Pack_(with_Patch_1.03)_-illiria

It includes all the DLC's cracked for 1.03."
