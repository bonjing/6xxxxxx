The entire discography of Bullet For My Valentine, as far back as I could trace it. 

Jeff Killed John Demos:

Jeff Killed John was the original Bullet For My Valentine, with their first bassist Nick Crandle. They were considered Nu Metal and they released only a few songs with the Pynsci scheme label. I believe that these were released from 1998-2002

1. Hostile
2. Bouncy Stuff
3. Eye spy
4. Nation To Nation
5. You
6. Play With Me
7. Broad (Live Video)
(No official Album Cover so, I created one with Photoshop.)
