[T],insinuendo,2011-06-06T22:21Z,"There are few possibilities.

If your computer can handle it, I recommend 
CCCP: http://www.cccp-project.net/
or KMplayer: http://kmplayer.en.softonic.com/

External players are what I prefer for my setup.

I use the OPPO BDP 93: http://www.oppodigital.com/blu-ray-bdp-93/

I also own the WD live hub which is less expensive and works rather well even for high bitrate files (+15 MBs):  http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=330

Hope that was helpful."
