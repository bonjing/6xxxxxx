help me"
[V],globeplus,2011-06-03T14:49Z,"To rockondj : it very easy and a pleasure give me the opportunity to answer that question : just browse the plugins and the bios directorys folders of the pcsxGLOBE tool (only this directorys and the configuration will open automatically after the plugin miss message) and you will see automatically all the plugins and bios available after this little work that only needs to be done 1 time and thatÂ´s it , i will try to even this little work be evitated if it is possible in future versions but it is a pleasure too , have now quickly the updated compatibility list of the PS2 games available at 1 simple click from the interface menu , maybe not the real ideal my friendly user but certainly farway from the end of the world and the graphycs style of the emulator is to cry for it compared to the regular version ...

See you , enjoy the tool and thank you for your comment ."

PLEASE CLICK ON THE LINK TO WATCH . THANK YOU ."
[V],globeplus,2011-06-04T13:32Z,"SMALL NOTE : 

the games start automatically with the play button , it is true but when it is to close the game special using the window mode use the ESC key because with the normal cross at the right top corner the window close but the game can be still running and then meaning a close session or a computer restart because of that , it is like the closing process is not acceptable like that , so again : use the ESC key when it is to close the games , beside this little note for the moment nothing else to report .

Thank you and enjoy the tool ."
[V],globeplus,2011-06-04T21:56Z,"To minilol : it is a pleasure give some help to you , do the next thing because it is necessary to convert the bz2 into iso and for that we need the Linuz Iso CDVD 0.9.0 plugin that is on the CDVD Rom section of the configuration , open the pcsxglobe emulator version then go to the config/configure and on the cdvd Rom select the Linuz Iso plugin then click configure and select your bz2 iso finally select to Decompress Iso on the plugin and click ok , wait the necessary time for the decompression , maybe 5 to 10 minutes maximum i think and you will get the main game iso extracted by decompression from the bz2 , now with this iso you put him on the pcsxglobe folder change the name to game or use the iso renamer from the interface menu and play ...

Just follow my instructions and will get the mentionated game on the essencial iso format to the pcsxglobe emulator on quick start mode , enjoy and i hope this helped you and thank you for your comment ."
,trueteller,2011-06-04T22:31Z,many many thanks for this and one simple question god of war 1.2 is amazingly fast as same as ps2 but burnout take down and revenge has some issues like there is white lines coming on screen and flickering can u please give me the solution thanks in advance and when can i expect the game the hunted the demons forge full rip once again thanks for this  
[V],globeplus,2011-06-05T10:37Z,"To trueteller : hi , it is true that many games for the ps2 emulation on the pc still can have emulation problems or really imcompatibility , so for that consult the compatibility list but it is also true that the progress of the pcsx emulator is beeing great , some years ago if you get 30 to 40% of the games running even with circunstancial bugs you was in luck already , now with the improve of the plugins , we can still have bugs in the games but the percentage of the games running increased positively like 20 or more percent in comparation to the starting years of the emulator and the tendence is that more games can start beeing playable and more bugs in some games corrected , so it is really appreciable the work that it is beeing maded by the plugins guys , thank you to them and keep the good work .

About the the mentionated game (hunted the demons forge) , can be another interesting Betheda Softworks game for the pc,xbox and ps3 , from me i canÂ´t do too much for the moment about games files , still have a slow connection and i still a kind of unstable about my home , i am in an specie of intermediate zone after a real trouble home change with lot of work and worries to a more or less stable not well defined new place and what was possible with all the trouble was to manage a cheap net at least for still beeing alive using the computer ... what i can work when it is possible at this point is small files and useful nice applications or ramdomly tools are enquadrated correctly on the type of file target that i can work for the moment , who does the best possible under the circunstances to give nice contributions to the file sharing community canÂ´t be asked more , anyway i am with attention even with a slow net , i am shore that originals files with worked executables and worked rips can happen for the best pc games so you will still can get the games , from me i am limitated in the net connection but my friendly user with all the heart and spirit for contributing better as possible to the sharing community when i get the opportunity .

see you and keep your wish in playing nice games , i hope you enjoy this pcsx emulator version and thank you for your comment . "
