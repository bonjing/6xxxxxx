I have flown it and it works wonderfully. includes service pack 2.1 with working configurator. no bugs or issues with it. 

to install: 
place FSUIPC in temp folder
remove previous version of ifly
run ifly737-fs2004
extract ifly737ngsp2crack contents to guage folder and overwrite
run ifly737-vc-texture
extract iflysp2.1 rar and overwrite in relative folders
replace FSUIPC and overwrite

that should do it! enjoy
