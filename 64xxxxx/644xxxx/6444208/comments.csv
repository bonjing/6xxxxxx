,AUA521,2011-06-05T00:16Z,thanks dude!!
,kuchuk,2011-06-13T16:11Z,"hey man thanks! I have only one problem. I installed the program exactly as the readme told me, but the NEW mcp textures don't show up in the VC. Any solutions? (old one with orange digits works fine)"
,B58F18,2011-06-13T19:46Z,"@AUA521, your welcome!
@kuchuk, the digits work but the area around the digits is grey right? I just tested it and I have that problem too... O.o"
,kuchuk,2011-06-14T14:56Z,yes mm didn't find a solution yet..
,Marno1243,2011-06-15T08:44Z,Hi Guys. Thanx alot for the torrent but I think I'm dooing something wrong. I have done everything it says in the readme but when I run the plane and turnoff the APU I can't switch to my busses. The lights stay on and then some of the stuff in the plane goes off. Thanx in advance.
,B58F18,2011-06-15T19:41Z,you have to turn your engine generators on prior to turning off the APU
,B58F18,2011-06-15T19:49Z,"oh and kuchuck, I tested it in the 737-700 and the MCP textures showed up. no solution for 800 still."
,kuchuk,2011-06-20T20:35Z,mm yes I noticed! Still trying..perhaps someone with a bit more programming knowledge can check it out?
,Zekehund,2011-06-27T18:31Z,"Is it with both MCP versions??
I know how to fix it. But im to lazy to write both :P"
,B58F18,2011-06-27T19:52Z,"no, just the blue version textures are missing on the 800"
,Zekehund,2011-06-30T10:46Z,Copy the content from the BBJ2 texture folder into the 738 texture folder. Do not overwrite.

,738max,2012-01-28T12:30Z,"Hey guys. I use the plane since Nov 2011, and i had absolutely no problem with it. But when i installed more and more liveries, i got a problem. First occured with the 736, i installed 2 different liveries, which are from ifly official site, and when i selected any of them the plane just didn't worked, it wasn't loaded, just spinned around, i clicked OK in the selector menu uselessly. Ok i thought no problem i can use 737, or 738, and the others, i had 3 738 liveries, all of them worked well while the 736 couldn't. Few days later when i installed only one livery to 737,  i did the same thing as 736, ok no problem, use 738, 739, and BBJ's. I used only the 738 for very long time, without any fu*king problem, today, when i just installed one more livery, which could be the fourth 738 livery, it gone wrong, couldn't load just spinning around. Now i can use only BBJ's. Is there anybody who had the same problem, or anybody who has an idea what the heck is this? (I use Win7 64bit.) And sorry about my grammar."
