,babumoshai,2011-09-03T14:08Z,"u xpect me to download this shit man ?!! 
its 128kbps or lower man ... the file size of each mp3s tells da story lol. "
,Fiamma29,2011-09-30T07:07Z,"Most albums are missing a track or two, but the worse part is that the uploader has included a duplicate of another track in that album to make it look complete! Kind of pathetic... Apart from that, torrent is fine."
,ladytrin,2011-10-14T02:41Z,SUPER!!!
,tshepo_13,2012-01-17T01:48Z,putting the original CD with the deluxe edition is a little bit redundant
,slikey,2012-03-24T05:57Z,"@babumoshai  just cuz the songs are in 128 kbps, does mean they sound awful, may be you need to do some ""research"" on that topic buddy!
torrent is awesome, just like any other torrent from  theLEAK. "
