,pandit734,2011-06-06T10:54Z,Thanks was waiting for this .anyone seeding ?
,tony419,2011-06-06T11:04Z,"Forgive me, i dont know what '480p-R5-LiNE-x264' means, so i dont know how good these uploads are, and frankly i dont bother to find out, coz nothin IMO surpasses the clarity of a 720p brrip at less than 500mb, and the last you uploaded of such quality was The Vengeance Trilogy, which i hugely appreciated. So unless  '480p-R5-LiNE-x264' is better than '720p brrip', it seems you've declined in a bit. Hoping you get back to the best."
,tony419,2011-06-06T11:11Z,"I know your 'work' aint easy, and i shudnt be complaining over free stuff, but it seems ur tryin 2 keep up with current movies. IMO, ppl like me that are aiming for BRRIP clarity yet smallest size possible are NOT looking for current movie, we're willing to wait 4 a month or 2 till current movies are clear, we aint moved by the hype. I dont watch stuff coz its leading the box office,i frankly dont care. If I cared, i would dwld sh/tty quality of some1 else just to be 'current'. Thanx for all the great uploads, n my vote goes to Brrip 720p "

yup its being seeded but i don't know why tracker stats aren't updated"
,theoryTim,2011-06-06T16:44Z,"@tony
Shut up.  Noone cares of your irrelevant opinion on 480 Vs 720.  No use in bashing the uploader over something stupid - don't like it, don't download it you moron.  Have you nothing better to do than complain over free stuff?"
,mkv-cv,2011-06-06T17:07Z,"@StyLishSaLH  Thank u so much for this upload.
I wasn't hoping 4  u to upload the movie so fast.
I don't know if u uploaded 'cause i asked, or else.
But any way thank u so much
Keep the good work

If u could upload:
-The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 2010 i would appreciate it

P.S: Why don't u upload in mkv anymore???"
,mkv-cv,2011-06-06T17:16Z,"@tony419 as u said, u don't know  what 480p-R5-LiNE-x264 means!! So search and stop being stupid.
If u want ur movies in 720p just convert them after u download to 1280x720!!!
Did u understand!!! Stop criticizing!!!   
And sen-seriously no one cares if u are NOT looking for current movies!! If u want Bdrip go to E-bay AS***LE "

,missJiaLi,2011-06-15T07:39Z,"Okay look, i'm not one that likes to jump on people......even via the net. but @ tony, seriously, just go away and download one of those 1.3-30gig torrents if you want some perfect quality crap.

I couldn't be more appreciate of  StyLishSaLH if i tried!!! i LOVE the size of downloads you upload, they're PERFECT for my slower connection! and not a lot of people upload in this size.........which is why i think i'm more prone to tell ppl who complain about quality on these smaller downloads, to STFU!

No many people upload at this size, and i can't stand to see the few who do get bothered in anyway.....especially when a) their quality is LOVELY for the size, and b) THERE ARE TONS OF OTHER TORRENTS IF THE SMALLER SIZES DONT' SUIT YOU! 
Gees!


KEEP UP THE AWESOME WORK AS ALWAYS STYLISH!!!

,shewolf415,2011-06-26T08:27Z,"Bad move Tony! As you can see we look out for each other on this site, any negativity is going to receive negative feedback. And that was pretty passive aggressive In one breath your trying to sound smart and it makes you sound like a dumbass.  mkv is right, common sense indicates to do a search if you really want to know. and secondly you are indeed criticizing. Anybody with any sense can see that. So like all my friends said take your ass somewhere else. And to better things, THANKS! StylishSaLH. for sharing and the hard work you always put into your uploads.  I got nothing but love for you.
