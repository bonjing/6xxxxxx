,jacktarr,2012-01-22T02:09Z,"Thanks for this.  But note, in case it isn't obvious, this is *not* the 1954 Miyamoto  Musashi Samurai Trilogy starring Toshiro Mifune and directed by Hiroshi Inagaki.  For that go to http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4785175/Samurai.I.Musashi.Miyamoto.1954.DVDRip.x264.AC3-[gx]
and
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4811288/Samurai.II.Duel.at.Ichijoji.Temple.1955.DVDRip.x264.AC3-[gx]

Elguaxo doesn't seem to have uploaded the third film.  All three are available in a single torrent (though allegedly with bad video quality) at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4739434/Samurai_Trilogy_I_II_III_-Musashi_Miyamoto_(1954)."

But....

Episode 4 is incomplete.  It is missing all of Mushashi's greatest battle in the rice paddy.

In episode 5, the subtitles (even though there are 2 subtitle files) are incomplete."
