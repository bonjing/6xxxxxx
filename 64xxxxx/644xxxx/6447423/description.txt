Japanâ€™s most famous samurai, MIYAMOTO Musashi (1584-1645), was an unmatched warrior whose innovative two-sword technique left him victorious in over 60 duels. Today, his philosophy lives on in The Book of Five Rings, his world-famous manual on battleground (and boardroom) strategy.

This epic five-film series, based on the best-selling saga by YOSHIKAWA Eiji (over 120 million copies sold worldwide), portrays the definitive account of Musashi, and is regarded in Japan as the best film series adaptation on the life of the legendary swordsman.
