::Plot::
Computer programmer Thomas A. Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is secretly a hacker known by the alias \\\"Neo\\\". He is restless, and driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to \\\"the Matrix\\\" appearing on his computer. An infamous female hacker called Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) confirms that a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) knows the answers he seeks; however, three sinister Agents, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), arrest Neo and attempt to dissuade him from contacting Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo attends a secret meeting with Morpheus, who offers him a choice of two pills: A blue one that would return him to his old life, and a red pill that would allow him to learn the truth about the Matrix. Neo swallows the red pill, and he abruptly finds himself in a liquid-filled pod, his body connected by tubes and cables to a vast mechanical tower covered with identical pods. The connections are severed, and he is rescued by Morpheus and taken aboard his ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo\\\'s atrophied physical body is restored, and Morpheus explains the situation.
