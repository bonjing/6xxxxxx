,munce888,2011-06-17T04:41Z,"Thanks so much, my kids are a great fans of Peppa Pig. Peppa pig is not sold in our country. By the way, do you have subtitles for all series and episodes? It will be perfect if you have them.
Thanks again."
,eeionn.,2011-06-20T18:33Z,"sorry, i don't have subtitles"
,munce888,2011-06-22T05:49Z,"I see. In fact, I can understand 90% of the words. But just miss out some lines. 
Like for Peppa Christmas, when Santa climbed down from the chimney, he said something like ""why are these chimneys always so ?""? Just can't understand the last word. So sometimes hard to explain to the kids. You have any idea what's the last word? Thanks "
,Malkav17,2011-09-23T21:56Z,"Munce888: the word is SUTTY, meaning dusty."
,Spuddy55,2011-10-05T12:31Z,"sorry for being pedantic,  but it's ""sooty"" meaning ""covered in soot"" (but pronounced like sutty)."
