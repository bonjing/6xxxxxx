                An unusual take on the detective genre featuring
                Jackson Brodie, who has served with the army and the
                police, and is now a private investigator. Jackson
                takes on the mysterious case of a girl who went
                missing 30 years ago. As well as helping a grieving
                father to find the man who murdered his daughter,
                Brodie must deal with flashbacks to his own traumatic
                past.
