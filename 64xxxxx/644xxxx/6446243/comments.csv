,MasterPhisherman,2011-06-09T21:36Z,"Umm, i made a mistake in the instructions. on step three on the keygen, scroll down to the option Sony Vegas (32 and 64-bit) and then click generate 5 times."
,st_jo,2011-06-12T08:52Z,"When I try to find the Vegas folder after hitting Patch- the only folder with the .exe file is under Programs Files, not Program Files (x64).
Then, I get an error. Patch is unsuccessful regardless of where I try to put it.
Did I inadvertently install the wrong version? No. It was fairly simple. 
I run Windows7 Ultimate 64-bit."
,st_jo,2011-06-12T09:32Z,"Uninstalled, reinstalled, ""Right Clicked"" to open Keygen as ""Administrator"" then followed the remaining instructions.
It works!!!!!
Seeding now.
Many thanks."

,MasterPhisherman,2011-06-15T19:43Z,"@kamotekamote 

did you run the keygen as administrator and patch the files?"

never mind."
,kamotekamote,2011-06-18T08:03Z,"@MasterPhisherman Hey, i think i have problem when i import media. It has a delay and the program is not responding for like 1min or so on, do you have any solution at this or it is me importing a 3GB video clip? :) "
,MasterPhisherman,2011-06-18T16:30Z,"@kamotekamote Well, 3GB is a large file so it will take a while to import. I don't think it's anything to worry about though. Hey, keep me posted if you have any other problems though."

,agboudreau,2011-06-26T16:57Z,"the registration code that you enter at the end never works for me. it always says that I enter itin correctly, Everything else works fine, the patching, saving HTML, everything... I dont understand why this doesnt"
,MasterPhisherman,2011-06-26T18:32Z,"@agboudreau

did you patch the correct folder? If it's not that then did you patch the folder and then start the vegas90.exe while still having the keygen open with the same activation code that you patched with? It sounds like I'm being picky but it's important for me to know so I can figure it out, as I haven't had that problem before."
,agboudreau,2011-06-27T00:10Z,"@MasterPhisherman

Yes, I did. Im currently just checking online right now, but in a few hours when I get back to my computer I will make 1 more attempt at all this and if it doesnt work, than I dont know what to do. Ill post a second message in a few hours once i know if doing it like you just said makes a difference, but im sure that is how I was doing it before"

,Snowy657,2011-07-02T18:24Z,"So easy when the Instructions are a bit clearer! so here it is...

I suggest Copying and Pasting this to wordPad so you can get to it offline

1) download. If you've gotten this far, you probably have...

*1.5) Disconnect Internet

2) run the appropraite installer and select your directories.

*2.5) Copy and Paste the KeyGen to your Sony Vegas 9 directory ie C:/Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 9.0

3) open the keygen and click generate about 5 times. be aware that this keygen plays loud music.

4) now click patch and find your vegas directory.(C:/Program Files/Sony/Vegas Pro 9.0) when the patch finishes DONT close the keygen!

5) open vegas90.exe. enter the serial in the keygen and click next. DONT close the keygen yet.

6) when you get to the part about personal info, select uk (or really, anywhere except the us to save
   you from having to put too much info)enter in a name and E-mail (it will show every time the program 
   loads).

7) when you get to the part about registering, click register from another computer and save the html
   file wherever you want. You won't need it again.

8) after you save the file, click next and enter the registration code from the keygen and you're done

9) enjoy and seed.

By the way, this keygen is good for a lot of sony products. use it well...

Hope this helps a bit better :)"
,MasterPhisherman,2011-07-02T18:29Z,"@ above 4

did you run the keygen as administrator?"
,MasterPhisherman,2011-07-02T18:31Z,"@Snowy657  Thanks for doing that, truly. My instructions were unclear and I didn't realize that until I had so many questions asked."
,PBAdversary,2011-07-04T18:37Z,"@ MasterPhisherman

I must be missing some big part here...

After I downloaded the 64-bit version I didn't know how to run the keygen as an admin so I just dragged it from the WinRAR folder to my desktop. From there Ive been running it as admin but whenever I try to patch sony vegas 9.0 it says that there was an error in patching the file(s). What am I doing wrong?"
,PBAdversary,2011-07-04T18:38Z,oh and also I can't find the file that's .exe
,MasterPhisherman,2011-07-07T16:23Z,"@PBAdversary Try Snowy657's instructions, which are more detailed, and see if that fixes anything. If not, let me know."
,WhyNevaWork,2011-07-31T10:39Z,"When i try to patch the  sony vegas file it goes half way, then it says ""an error has occurred while patching the file(s)!""
