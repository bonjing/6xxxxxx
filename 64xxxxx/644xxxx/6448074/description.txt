Someone has rightly said that there is a fine line between coincidence and fate. Samarth Art Innovative's new Marathi film 'Aatapita' tries to draw this fine line, when Ashutosh (Bharat Jadhav) who dreams of becoming a writer decides to make Nandu (Sanjay Narvekar), the hero of his story. Nandu works in the recovery of loan department of a bank. Writer- director Uttung Shelar who has conceptualized this unusual plot, has however left it to the audience to decide whether the happenings in the film are just a coincidence or it's the destiny of the person. 

'Aatapita' is a simple tale in the day to day life of two individuals, presented in a tricky manner to keep the audience on the hold till the climax, when it finally concludes with a surprise. It's a totally different experience in Marathi films, as such themes are generally observed in Marathi dramas. But, the director has given a better treatment to the plot, using the adaptability of the two excellent actors, who bring liveliness to every scene. Moreover, the dialogues by Prashant Loke, obviously help add a special flavor to the screenplay, which is based mainly on these two characters .
