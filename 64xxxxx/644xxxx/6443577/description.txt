From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes back to the show the president of Solari, Inc., the publisher of The Solari Report, and the managing member of Solari Investment Advisory Services, Catherine Austin Fitts. Fitts, a former Wall Street insider, served as Assistant Secretary of Housing and Federal Housing Commissioner at the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush Administration. 

Alex also talks with NWO researcher, author, and radio talk show host, Alan Watt.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
