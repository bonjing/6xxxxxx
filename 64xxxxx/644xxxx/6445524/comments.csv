TvTeam usually posts it here shortly after.  It may appear soon."

,PhilLesh12,2011-06-04T06:37Z,"on torrentday, click on ""Torrents"", then you'll find the search bar.

,PhilLesh12,2011-06-04T06:41Z,"... oh yeah, you probably need to register before you can search, and you definitely need to register before you can actually download a torrent.  They use private trackers (but they're super fast)."
,rocky4500,2011-06-04T11:15Z,"Thanks Man.
Plz can anyone tell me why thepiratebay.com stopped upload?? you can see latest torrent tab and check time.. Latest torrent uploaded was Y.day at 16:29 GMT..(Depending on you local time)
If you have the same upload problem let's contact the pirate bay administrators together..:))"
