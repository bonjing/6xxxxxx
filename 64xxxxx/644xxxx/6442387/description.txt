The Tamperer featuring Maya was an Italian-American dance music group consisting of Italian record producers Mario Fargetta and Alex Farolfi, and American singer Maya Days. Later, Giuliano Saglia and GianLuca Mensi would join the project. In 1998 they became famous for their debut single "Feel It", a UK number one hit single taken from their album Fabulous. "Feel it" was written by the American team of Steve Gittelman and Jim Dyke and relied heavily on a sample of the Jacksons hit "Can You Feel It".

The album spawned two more singles, "If You Buy This Record Your Life Will Be Better" (based on a sample from Madonna's "Material Girl"), and the Italy-only release "Step Out",
