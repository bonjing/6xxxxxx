It is awesome, you should be able to get 1080p for around 1 gig. groundbreaking. who ever did this could you do the new (2011) thor or maybe pirates on stranger tides. Thanks good work and good luck."

,mkv-cv,2011-06-05T19:06Z,"I think i don't need to speak about the quality. SUPERB! And 480p was the  best choice, so the file would be small.

Now, could u please upload Hanna R5 480p(seems like a good movie 7.5 on IMBD)

Here's the torrent : http://www.kat.ph/hanna-2011-r5-line-xvid-extratorrentrg-t5549309.html
