Black Country Communion is an English-American rock supergroup featuring Glenn Hughes, Jason Bonham, Derek Sherinian, and Joe Bonamassa. The group took their name from the English industrial area where both Hughes and Bonham hail from. 


Black Country Communion showcases the talents of four amazing artists, and the combination of these four talents makes for one hell of a great album! 
Glenn Hughes rolls out huge, thumping bass lines and turns in a vocal performance that proves why the man is a rock legend. 
Joe Bonamassa, young though he may be, plays guitar with the passion of an old soul and shines like few other guitarists on the scene today. 
Jason Bonham is an absolute drum powerhouse, playing with a ferocity that blazes, and along with Glenn's bass, is the unstoppable engine for this band. 
Derek Sherinian is artful in the textures and moods he creates. He shows tasteful restraint, but steps forward when needed. 
Delivering twelve solid tracks of bold, old-school rock and roll, Black Country Communion stands out as a masterpiece and an instant classic!  (Brent Soileau)
