I think I found the solution. I had the same problem when I remembered that I have java 7. installed which is still in beta. I uninstalled and installed the latest java 6 ... the game works now as it should.

SOLUTION: remove java 7 and install java 6... worked for me.

Kind regards"

Why don't you go and carry on sucking noth's dick instead moaning about devs ?"
,ShadowMastr,2011-06-05T00:29Z,"This is an alpha version of game, 1.2a or something like that. You cannot save at the moment.

Soon as I can figure out how to not burn the soup, me, and the house down, I might be able to say it's a good game....."
,killgerard,2011-06-05T17:55Z,to not burn the house is easy just turn off the oven and go upstairs
,Coggs,2011-06-07T21:43Z,"looks like it will be good, so far though meh. Just a wee tutorial then you get shot and time skips forward forever."
