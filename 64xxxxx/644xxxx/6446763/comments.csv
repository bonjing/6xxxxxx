,Borgodoc,2011-06-05T19:06Z,"Exactly what are you trying to accomplish by throwing all of this info on the internet? I can see that you want to take action against corruption in the government agencies and everyone that is connected with them, but putting it on the internet isn't really a good idea if you say you're doing all of this out of ethic considerations. This info might be exploited by, for example, terrorists. If it wasn't for the NATO, you would probably not have the chance to live your fancy life that you have now. F*cking hypocrits -.-"
,thekiller2,2011-06-05T22:21Z,you know what would be epic if LulzSec gave us psn redeem codes it would be very funny if they gave us loads of reedem codes

,y3sy3s,2011-06-06T04:36Z,"hacked this site....

http://www.pinoyunderground.com/

they keep on saying that LulzSec are boastful hackers, UNCIVILIZED! this is the discussion i've read when i open my account on their live chat conversation. 

in the end, i refute and say not to judge LULZSEC, ""THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ON THEIR OWN WAY"" MANY OF US WON'T ACCEPT THAT THEY'RE ALL GENIUS ON HACKING! 

after saying this, the admin warned me not to conspire with LULZSec... but i replied, WE HAVE ALL THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH... "

Fuck NWO"
,LuxLOL,2011-06-06T16:07Z,Nice done ;-)
,Siobhan.Oleary,2011-06-08T06:08Z,"All too convenient that just after Obama's administration declares its military response to hacking of the government related organisations LulzSec begins its operations..

Agent Provocateurs working for government, that's what LulzSec are! Now nothing stops governments to take control of the interwebz.

And Piratebay provides a fantastic point of distribution of all this diarrhoea to Target Audiences..

You just been played very well.....muppets!!

Lies. Every organization like NATO is corrupt. Before civilization man lived at one with nature. Everyone had enough raw organic delicious fruit to eat, everyone had enough exercise and fun, just like all of the other Great Apes in Africa do unless human corperations disturb them. We were living as we were evolved. NATO and ""civilization"" and the police aren't the reason we have some form of federally-approved ""freedom"" and food, we have it in spite of them. The ""terrorists"" are mainly in the White House. How do you that 9/11 wasn't a good thing for example? Maybe the US really was out of control, maybe it deserved it. One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. I recommend you watch Russia Today which really does seem to be somewhat honest. But the companies like NATO and the US government are some of the most corrupt of all, because people don't question them as much.  

Lulzsec, I think that the biggest threat facing us today is the threat of the GMOs... genetically modified organisms. They have the ability to destroy all natural normal foods forever because they will all be infected by the GMOs with how things are looking. There would be no going back from this. I wonder what you might find if you could hack into the files of Monsanto for example and other GMO companies. They are trying so hard to press these foods upon us, and could deny all our descendants the natural food we are designed to eat forever.  "

,dellthinker,2011-06-25T22:02Z,@acilius LOL. Yeah seriously. Honestly I'd put my hacking towards something more useful like bank logins and CC infos that I could use to make lots of $$
