Dear Internets,

It has come to our unfortunate attention that NATO and our good friend Barrack 
Osama-Llama 24th-century Obama have recently upped the stakes with regard to hacking. 
They now treat hacking as an act of war. So, we just hacked an FBI affiliated website 
(Infragard, specifically the Atlanta chapter) and leaked its user base. We also took 
complete control over the site and defaced it, check it out if it's still up: http://infragardatlanta.org/

While not very many logins (around 180), we'd like to take the time to point out that all 
of them are affiliated with the FBI in some way. Most of them reuse their passwords in other places, 
which is heavily frowned upon in the FBI/Infragard handbook and generally everywhere else too.

One of them, Karim Hijazi, used his Infragard password for his personal gmail, and the gmail of 
the company he owns. "Unveillance", a whitehat company that specializes in data breaches and botnets, 
was compromised because of Karim's incompetence. We stole all of his personal emails and his company 
emails. We also briefly took over, among other things, their servers and their botnet control panel.

After doing so, we contacted Karim and told him what we did. After a few discussions, he offered to 
pay us to eliminate his competitors through illegal hacking means in return for our silence. Karim, 
a member of an FBI-related website, was willing to give us money and inside info in order to destroy 
his opponents in the whitehat world. We even discussed plans for him to give us insider botnet information.

Naturally we were just stringing him along to further expose the corruption of whitehats. 
Please find enclosed Karim's full contact details and a log of him talking to us through IRC. 
Also, enjoy 924 of his internal company emails - we have his personal gmail too, unreleased.

We call upon journalists and other writers to delve through the emails carefully, as we have 
uncovered an operation orchestrated by Unveillance and others to control and assess Libyan 
cyberspace through malicious means: the U.S. government is funding the CSFI to attack Libya's 
cyber infrastructure. You will find the emails of all 23 people involved in the emails.

Unveillance was also involved in a scheme where they paid an Indian registrar $2000 to 
receive 100 domains a month that may be deemed as botnet C&Cs. Shameful ploys by supposed "whitehats".

We accept your threats, NATO. Game on, losers.

Now we are all sons of bitches,

Lulz Security
