,wd123411,2011-06-06T22:58Z,"lulzsec children can't stand being out of the news for 10 minutes, so resort to releasing the most boring as shit PHP code known to man? Talk about grasping at straws

Pack of script kiddies capable little more than SQL vulns and not getting laid.."
,fr334a11,2011-06-06T23:19Z,wd123411 is talking about himself...minus any hacking ability

The fun's only starting to begin."
,NuvoPirate,2011-06-07T09:49Z,"Great. Please upload more SDK, etc.

It allows home brew, hackers/tinkers to make their own games and learn about these platforms, etc.

Really console developers are dumb to hide these things.
If they were free and open for people play with it would only be to their benefit.

It would help push the limits of the systems, stimulate creativity, help fledgeling game programmers to learn and make a demo for possible employment, etc."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-06-07T10:03Z,"Hey Mark, have you thought about maybe getting off your ass and doing something?  Climb a tree that's not related to you, go for a jog to get rid of your flabby man-boobs, read a book to reach a level of intelligence beyond that of the average American...there's millions of things you could do that's just as entertaining and healthier than sitting on your ass playing a stupid game all day."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-06-07T10:05Z,"Hey LulzSec, what are they chances of tossing together your own PSN for users to play on then redirecting Sony traffic to it?  Including an update with hacked firmware to allow homebrew?  I mean...theoretically speaking of course."
,R0z3_0f_J4D3,2011-06-07T11:51Z,Problem:  I think someone's trying to block torrent downloads.

,un50und,2011-06-07T17:36Z,"Note to downloaders: this archive contains a web site. the files are nearly all PHP which is not really source code at all. Its a bit like HTML with some perl and javascript thrown in. There is no C++, java or csharp, just 2 or 3 .c files of a few kb. From a technical perspective it is not interesting and completely useless. int *pLameSec = 0; *pLameSec++;"
,nerdberry,2011-06-08T10:42Z,"i love the picture on this 

'SONY,
hacked. again'

trololol"
,MPHX3kk0,2011-06-08T19:41Z,"@un50und

it does have php code in it..just nothing too interesting.

also, your C usage disappoints me.
go learn a useful language."

,gartland1,2011-06-09T19:59Z,"dont be dicks with what i am about to say

,M0SHP1T,2011-06-09T20:17Z,"@LulzSec if you really wanna fuck sony make a mod so you download and play games for free.

Less people buying games = less money for sony 
Less money for sony = Sonys downfall..."
[V],BoWLiN,2011-06-10T09:20Z,"Keep up the good work lulzsec!

That'll teach sony for bashing hackers.

:)"
,JohnShit,2011-06-12T14:42Z,"Say what you want about LulzSec (you included, @wd123411) - they DID only exploit an SQL vulnerability, but it has cost the evil corporation Sony BILLIONS. Yes, BILLIONS. They don't pretend they used some super-secret 1337 hacker method. If I were you, I would stop blaming LulzSec and start blaming Sony for failing to protect your data and personal information. What if, instead of LulzSec, a criminal gang got hold of it? LulzSec did good - so STFU faggots."
,Portak,2011-06-13T18:53Z,"  It amazes me, I mean really. You ""Lulzsec"" find an exploit, use it, then say your a ""security team""? You are really nothing more than the new version of old script kiddies. Grow up for fucks sake. "
,GianlucaL,2011-06-13T20:33Z,Lol that pic
