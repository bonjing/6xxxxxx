,EchoCat,2011-06-07T01:04Z,"@psynwinny this was uploaded on the 6th, as of now they haven't released the June pack, rather this is all the packs that were there at the time."
,eavg,2011-06-07T14:24Z,"yes they did release them, them retracted them on the 3rd.  But there is a torrent out there on another torrent site that does indeed have the new june 2011 store items."
,tlcasselman,2011-06-09T05:26Z,"Question. How Do I add these. Do I just copy and paste to a specific folder in my Sims 3 Installed Folder or is there more to it then that.

I've downloaded/Installed BB and Riverview with no problems but I'm unsure about how to install* the .package files."
,tlcasselman,2011-06-09T05:35Z,"My comment isn't showing up :P

I've installed BB&Riverview with no problems, I'm unsure about the package files though. 

Do I copy/paste them to a specific file or do is it done another way?"
,aeroll30,2011-06-09T10:03Z,Go to http://www.modthesims.info/ to learn how to install the files with .package extensions ....
,YLEN,2011-06-12T14:40Z,"thanks! great stuff..

,YLEN,2011-06-12T14:43Z,"thanks! great torrent..
could anyone upload the original, not packaged items?"
,sharanelia,2011-06-13T16:12Z,"What program can I use to extract all the separate files from the .package files to selectively install only what I want from each .package package? Will the program you used to package them do? If so, what was that?"
,bazul00,2011-06-14T19:33Z,"Works Great!! Thx, but is there a way that i can delete some of the items, like if i dont want one of the clothes items?? "
,Teato0o,2011-06-16T01:42Z,"Just making sure, this IS from the official store, right? No fan-made items or such...? ._.

Once again, just making sure, even though I think it is obvious it isn't. =P

Hopefully...."
,Teato0o,2011-06-16T01:47Z,"Oh, and another thing, this contains ALL of the store items?? Because I don't quiet get what you mean by  ""Sims 3 Store UPDATE xx - MM YYYY""


Yes, I am a noob torrenter."
,Limsleia,2011-07-02T02:07Z,Thank you for a thorough and well organized pack. For those who are having trouble with installing there are good guides on modthesims2 dot com. Yes for sims 3.
