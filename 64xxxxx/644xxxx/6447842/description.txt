Seasoned veterans of the Arizona Metalcore scene, Loren Battle have captured the national spotlight with the release of their 2 Full Length records â€œWords Begin Warsâ€ which has such underground hit's as Remember The Archer, 3 Ft Funeral, A Hero's Nightmare & "Learning To Live With Open Wounds" featuring Heres To You, The Protester & Deer in The Headlights. Loren Battle is without a doubt one of the fastest rising unsigned bands in recent memory. Independently selling over 5,000 copies of both records and having over 40,000 hits on their Cover of Lady Gaga's "Paparazzi" and reaching 1 on the MySpace Metalcore charts on numerous occasions, Loren Battle shows no signs of slowing down. With tour plans in motion for the majority of 2011, and a new full-length in the works, expect to see a lot more of Loren Battle in the near future.
