The kantele, a mix of harp, hammered dulcimer, and zither, is Finland's national instrument, and Loituma show the range of its possibilities on this album. Ranging from the traditional, like "Leva's Polka" (which was released as a Finnish single and hit the charts), to the modern, the band covers a musical territory that encompasses the atmospheric with Marti Pokela's insidious "Marshaland" and "Three Things of Beauty," whose words are adapted from Kalevala poetry, and bring to mind an acoustic Cocteau Twins. Originally formed by two singers who later moved to Hedningarna, Loituma produce a lovely balance of vocal and instrumental pieces that offer unalloyed joy while introducing American audiences to the light magic that is the kantele
