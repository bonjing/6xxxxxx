[b]Summary:[/b]

There are a lot of crap MicroXP out there, and this isn't one of them.
This is a quality release.
No need to activate.
All significant speed enhancement are built-in except for swap file.
Feature-wise, this copy has almost all the features of original XP Pro.
Automatic Windows Update works. 
App Compatibility now exceeds retail copy.
Why install this copy instead of retail? No need to activate, malware-free, much faster, more secure and requires less ram than retail copy.  
Can I use this copy to fix my friend's computer?  Yes, this is a high quality release.


[b]Instructions:[/b]

Make sure you "Force Recheck" the torrent once it is stopped and burn on a slow speed, select verify option.
Burn on any media you want with imgburn, nero, poweriso etc...
Install is automatic, just configure your bios, choose where to install and everything else will be done for you.

[b]Supported Languages:[/b]

Arabic, Armenian, Chinese (Simplified only), Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi,
Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Vietnamese

Only the main regions for the languages are supported.  
All options in "regional and language options" work, and in accordance to the included languages above.
   
[b]I don't want to install XP on C Drive?
[/b]
You have three options.
Make sure only one storage unit is connected to computer prior to loading XP Setup; optical drive doesn't count.
1. If you see another partition, select that partition.
2. If there are no partitions, then you must create two partitions.
    By default when you go to make a partition, XP gives the maximum size.
    You need to reduce this size so that you can make a second partition.
    Now create you second partition, and select it to install XP onto it.
3. If there is exactly one partition, it is probably taking the whole hard drive, and you need to delete then create two partitions as discussed.

[b]Ever heard about MicroXP 0.82? [/b] 

I am not the author of the product and happily so.  Anyways it installs in half the time because it only has about 20% of the original feature set.
What does that mean for you?
 
  -Many applications including drivers will not install correctly or at all.
  -Many errors
  -No Security Policies furthermore security policies impossible to implement
  -Administration not possible e.g., password protected account cannot be enforced
  -Sharing of Hard Drive is automatically on by default
  -Windows Firewall isn't included etc
 
In summary, that you can only use it on a offline computer and only for gaming.
Can't be a good author if sharing of entire hard drive is on by default.

[b]What is MicroXP Pro 0.90 good for?[/b]  Everything, and improves security, speed and ram over retail.  It has about 90% of the feature set, yet is three times as small as original iso. That other 10% are features that can be forgotten, or for which a new version of the software exist.  Further below I list the removed components.


[b]Using Windows Update, and word about Application Compatibility[/b] 

I previously stated that Windows Update and WGA checking apps like Security Essentials require XP to be activated in order to function.
I am happy to report that I was mistaken and have tricked XP into thinking it is activated even though the activation component is absent from the release; lol.
Window Genuine Advantage is a backdoor.  It's a two-face program.  On the one hand, it will give its assessment of whether windows is genuine (properly licensed) or not, but
on the other hand (as it regularly contacts Microsoft) Microsoft can give its own assessment, deem it ungenuine and instruct the app to de-activate windows or certain features.
On MS update, it is currently known as KB905474, but future versions will come out; perhaps with a different Knowledge Base number.  The point is, we don't want a backdoor on pirated
copy of XP.  Here pirated means (created from retail version, but unproperly licensed).  The genuine advantage is suppose to be access to exclusive MS apps and certain XP updates. 
But the program itself falsely identifies Micro XP Pro as genuine.  To add to insult, it comes to this conclusion with licensing component fully removed from XP :)
But remember even if it marks XP as genuine, it is still a backdoor for Microsoft.  Yap, I've tricked XP into thinking it's properly licensed even though licensing component is removed :)
Conclusion:  If your going to use install MS updates, don't install KB905474 or anything "Windows Genuine Advantage".  Not installing this may prevent you from installing updates from Internet Explorer.
                    However, you'll still be able to update XP with Automatic updates.  In short, I garentee Automatic Updates.  Also avoid update KB955759 (as the component is removed from XP).
	        Alternatively to Automatic Updates, you may install and use Microsoft Baseline Security Analyser 2.2


Finally, with regard to App Compatibility, one could argue that it is impossible to have better app compatibility in the wake of removed components/services.
My counter argument is simply that next to no apps utilise the components/services I remove therefore unaffecting app compatibility
AND
I include a MS compatibility update; for software that failed to work out of the box for XP SP3 retail.
Therefore, Micro XP Pro 0.91 has superior app compatibility than retail.


[b]Recommondations[/b]

	[b]General[/b]
            Read the "Using Windows Update" section.
        	Remember that windows is best protected by Virtualization or Anti-Virus products and Firewalls, not by security updates.
	If you wish to use themes, you must first enable it.  On the Desktop, click on theme.bat
	Do not turn off "file and printer sharing" firewall exception if you intend to do such an activity or your software uses the "computer browser" service.
	
	[b]Core Dependencies[/b]
	Many apps, require a specific .net framework, flash player, java or visual c++ runtimes.  
            Downloading and installing .net frameworks AIO x86 via desktop shortcut is a MUST.  
            For games, you need to update directx via desktop web installer. 

	[b]Malware Protection[/b]
	Virtualization is best; Returnil Virtual System Pro and Deep Freeze are great products.
	Basically when you restart your computer, all changes to your system are undone; infect me trojan for upon restart you are gone.
	Anti-virus products are garbage in comparison, but still offer some protection.  I can easily make viruses to evade AVs.
	The best free product is Avira Personal for Antivirus; highest pro-activate and manual scan detection rate of any free AV product.

	[b]Firewall Protection [/b]
            Firewalls have one purpose; to control the flow of information.
            An computer intrusion itself is merely used to acquire intel; how is your computer vulnerable?  Can I remotely install information stealing software?  Can I wardrive off your network?
                                                                                                  who are you? How can I profit off the intrusion.  No profit or gain potential, next computer.
            A program seeking to relay a message over the internet is either a legitimate piece of software, or a trojan that recorded your keystrokes, took screenshots and wants to relay that
            information to its master.
            Windows Firewall only provides limited inbound or intrusion protection.  It provides no outbound protection, but it barely has any effect on the speed (latency) of the internet.
            Comodo Firewall provides the greatest inbound and outbound protection, but it can reduce browsing speed.  
            Zone Alarm Pro fails many outbound aptitude tests, and tends to be buggy.

	[b]Utilities[/b]
	Install glary utilities and use all of their utitilies including 1-click maintenance and registry defrag.
	Install beachbit.  Cleans windows best.  Make sure to Uncheck free disk space AND memory dump; bsod logs.
	If using magnetic storage, defrag hard drive.
	For backups, use EASEUS Todo Backup Home.  Note: All partitions must be NTFS or of FAT type.  So if you're duel booting linux look elsewhere.
	Don't use internet explorer, use google chrome for browsing AND opening pdfs.
	For video, use VLC.
	Problem deleting files in use?  Install Unlocker.
	For archiving use 7zip, Peazip, Universal Extractor.


Below you find in depth information about this release.  
I remove components and services either because they present no benefit, little benefit or a security benefit.
