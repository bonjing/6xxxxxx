,Euph0ria,2011-06-27T05:57Z,"The HDTV Logo is clearly visible in Indiana Jones-II-Temple Of Doom [1984]-720p-BRrip-x264-StyLishSaLH at 29:55 in the upper right corner ""WOWOW"" Definitely NOT BluRay ripm nor near a quality BluRay quality encode. Original HDTV artifacts are evident in the encode which leaves the video quality mediocre at best. 

I would definitely avoid StyLishSaLH posts if they're this misleading and don't waste your bandwidth on sub-par quality video because of deception by the poster.  If he didn't rip and encode from BluRay as stated, it shouldn't be here."
,ssj792,2011-06-28T14:22Z,@themohawkboy did u find a solution? Same prob here.
,ssj792,2011-06-28T14:23Z,@StyLishSaLH unable to play first and last what could be the prob?
[T],StyLishSaLH,2011-07-07T16:27Z,"@ Euph0ria
Never meant to mislead bro.
The source (Indiana Jones Quadrilogy 1981 2008 Bluray 720p x264 aac jbr ) I used was stated bluray, hence I gave the label bluray rip.
I didn't mean to deceive anyone. You people know me. I'm trying my best to give encodes to you.
Pls accept my apology if it wasted ur bandwidth. Sorry bro."
,thrillerrock,2011-07-18T18:39Z,"FIRSTLY THAX FOR THE AWESOME SERIES OF THE INDIANA JONES AND U R THE BEST UPLOADER WHO PROVIDE GREAT QUALITY WITHIN SMALL SIZES,AND U DONT NEED TO ASK FOR SORRY TO ANY PERSON U HAVE TO JUST IGNORE THEM,ONCE AGAIN THANX FOR THE UPLOAD."
