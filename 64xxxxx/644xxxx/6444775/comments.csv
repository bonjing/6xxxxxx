hey man, can u upload house M.D. Season 7 in small size like as you uploaded fringe season-3 "
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-03T15:09Z,"Sorry, I can't, House wasn't show I encoded before - I just did few last episodes as a favor. I PACK only episodes of shows I followed through, and that happens only occasionally Sorry."

@twentyforty
how many resolution standards are there?
before meeting you Ive seen 360p,480p,720p,1080p
I used to rip dvds in 360p...for avi
and 480p for avc
Now a hell of a lot of 'em"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-03T16:06Z,"Basically, none. In broadcasting you have 480p, 720p and 1080p, and these are HD standards recognized by industry.

""Ripping"" never followed such standards. But - to make life ""easier"", some terms were borrowed, and we now speak about ""pee"" numbers.
It is a guidance only, because encoders, who are not part of the Scene (Scene-groups) as myself, haven't sworn to obedience, as to some rules to follow.
My own frame-size formats are here, every day. in long header, who obviously most people hate to read.
""[lepton] family = frame-size 368-624 width x -2 (depends on AR) pixels, 
             16:9 or 2.35:1 aspect ratio
             ONLY for PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file, however, 
             some portables accept these format (TIP: upgrade firmware).
             WATCH from 6-8 ft. distance at low-res settings of display. 
             Free physics lesson: quarks are leptons.      
      272p = frame-size 480x272 pixels, 16:9 aspect ratio, playable on all kinds
             of MP4 capable devices/players/playback systems
      352p = frame-size 624x352(272) pixels, 16:9(2.35:1) aspect ratio, 
             playback ONLY on PC/PS3/Xbox/standalone mp4 capable players. 
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file,
             unless file is made iPod 5.5 and newer, iTouch or Nokia compatible.
             It's ""crossbreed"" then with now abandoned 360p (TIP: upgrade firmware). 
             NOTE: Cheap LCD displays doesn't like this format.      
      480p = frame-size 704x400 pixels for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV) or 704x304(320)
             for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.       
      576p = 848x480 pixels for 1.77:1 [16/9] (""normal"" wide screen AR)
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.       
      720p = 1216x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR)
             hardware intensive
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.""..."

can u pls look into  below movie for future encode

If twentyforty doesn't wanna do this

,jamydoug,2011-06-03T21:51Z,@twentyforty: thanks for d movie sir!! u hav been very kind!! :)
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-03T21:54Z,"@hardik_860; Thank you. I cannot accept new requests, I am simply saying too much behind, currently 9 movies wait for free slot. I am sorry, but wouldn't be fair. When I searched for 1080p HTDV ts I have seen many small m-HD and other encodes, just as DownTYU have suggested."
,hardik_860,2011-06-04T03:00Z,"d reason i asked it out bcoz of my broadband,couldn't have resume support from it......so only download torrents.
thanks for opinion.....
will download dvdrip....as u suggsted...."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-04T07:13Z,"@hardik_860; Therefore I suggested use of jdownloader (on youtube are dozens of guides)  and choosing file-hosters which servers support resume for free users (MF, MU, DUL and couple of others).
But, torrents are best indeed, but if some title isn't available by torrent - man should exploit other possibilities too."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-04T14:06Z,"Upload on TPB is ""broken"" for anybody from yesterday afternoon CET. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-04T15:54Z,"Same answer as always:""Telling your enemies what would be your next move is like planning a defeat. Your friends trust you and need no early warnings"".

Sun Tzu? Nope, me...

On thePIRATEbay, with so many enemies, it would be stupid. That would be feeding their web-crawlers with information What they exactly should look for.

And - last five movies are downloaded 3882 times - but number of seeders is mostly 27 (always same people).

Rest (majority) are fucking bastards and I give shit about. 
99.9% are pure Hit&Run.

You can use that e-mail given and know what you should expect.
"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-04T17:27Z,"Upload is still broken. Let use this quiet, Christmas-like time, feeling warmth around [sarcastic tone needed] to remember: 

"">twentyforty at 2011-06-03 19:14 CET:
Is rating about the torrent or the content?
TPB is full of perfect torrents, they work great.
But - what if someone doesn't like the content, as ""Movie is bad"" or ""Stupid show"" or god-knows-what...

How can anyone know who and for what reason has pressed that ""-"" or ""plus""? In all fairness, no one. Counting on reason is definitely wish too far.

Therefore, humans invented writing, and people could discuss and exchange opinions. Hiding in darkness and hitting with iron pole from behind is what ""Quality"" button is used for.

I know that much.

If somebody download my torrent and torrent as torrent works, I gave bytes away by that.
Pure manners imply saying Thank you.
If somebody give you something, isn't it uncivilized to say nothing. Bitching about gifts received is long time joke from dawn of all civilizations. Nobody could do that, without been ridiculed.

So, if any person is NOT satisfied with quality of gift (oh, it really sounds stupid) - does by ""minusing"" quality performs revenge? Is that bitching about HIS OWN choice? ""I ate brown stuff for free and it makes me sick"" - after ravaging buffet-table?

LOL"""
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-04T17:35Z,"I basically seed everything I download (up to 4 non-forced seeds--aggregate upload ceiling seems to be about 70 kB/s)--until I decide to consolidate my HDD--whether 20-40's or someone else's.  When it reaches ratio of 1.11/1 (desktop), or 0.77/1 (netbook), the individual upload ceiling of 6 kB/s kicks in, but it still seeds"
,abhikrit,2011-06-04T18:18Z,"hey mister twentyforty.. i guess you are full with your requests, but just put it in your consideration & you can encode it whenever you are free with the other requests, you are my favorite encoder, love your work so much.

You are NOT the problem.
None of 27 men.

That's the point I'm trying to get through.

One small favor only: start seeding after I stop (48h or 2-4 days). There is no point to be active next to my servers."
,rajmxxx,2011-06-04T22:24Z,Thank you piratebay for everything. My Internet pack just expired. From now onwards i won't be able get through your torrents. Really feeling sad. Hoping to see you again in future... rajmxxx

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-05T09:10Z,"@rajmxxx: Do not despair. Open some free e-mail account from some place where you can access Internet and post it here.
I am sure that few of people here (few of your countrymen too) can send you few bucks needed.

We are small community, but we help eachother.

@puplone & hkoraddi: I wasn't welcomed there. Let me remind you both that cronies of uploaders that have migrated (""expanded"") here and together with their uploaders came here to shit on us.
What site allowed all Shaileshes of the world to  say anything they want - but issued ME a warning (for ""bad"" behavior) when I refuted their nonsense. A site which name reveals pretty much who comes there. 

I call only one place ""my home"" and defend that with teeth, piece of brain and few cyber-claws left."
,murzar,2011-06-05T11:07Z,"Hey! This is my very first comment on tpb, even though i've been using it for almost 3 years.

A huge fan of you twenty-forty. I initially found you to be a rude 'SOB' :p Unlike the other uploaders, you were so aggressive. But lately, after all the shit that has been happening, the 'judgement' has changed. It shows.. what a sin it is to judge someone else in the first place.

Your currents actions, can be alluded to the way one should live their life. For one, your hard work. I commend the efforts you put at doing this. It was only after I tried encoding did I know that it wasn't childs play.

It is this nature of yours, your generosity, for people you have not met, some of them I wonder even appreciate you or not? It annoyed me first when you lashed out at people who complained about your 'quality'. Not anymore, because it is YOUR work.. and there shouldn't be any jackass to tell you the way to do it. I know this because I'm a writer and even though I'm open to criticism.. it is the 'jackasses' that give me a problem.

You're a fighter.. what people might consider as 'arrogance' is actually a stand that you take against everything that is the bad part of sharing. I never seeded before.. in all these 3 years, there wasn't a single torrent that I seeded back.. it was only after I stumbled upon your page and read your screams of rationality did I understand that true point of torrents. It's almost like living in the society.. where everyone contributes and shares for the betterment of it. From you, I learned my lesson to share. And I do so now.. it might not be much, just around 2 kbps (I share 10 torrents at once) but I know i'm making a difference.

I am not exaggerating.. but I think I learnt, in these last couple of months, how exactly we're meant to live in a civil society from you.

The only reason I've even bothered to write this is because.. first, I think you deserve to know that people care about what you do. I don't think there are words that exist to even define the immensity of the respect I have for you. and second, it looks like after you it is yify who is the next target. And I hope that like you, people like us give him the strength to survive this ordeal.

God bless you. You rock."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-05T16:07Z,"@murzar: Thank you murzar. Your writing is not just plain beautiful - but true. Aside other things you deducted yourself absolutely right - I should say that I never understood two opposite mentalities: one is phlegmatic, ending in extreme lack of empathy of especially Scandinavian people and other one is fighting to the point of insanity, even if you're proved dead wrong.
I see extremities in action and I cannot be somebody I'm not - I fight for my work as any man should do if he gives everything he have.

Regarding YIFY and few others, aside from personal burn-out (what no one admit too easy) that stupid, self-harming trend was initiated by new uploaders and their fans, forgetting the reality where torrents are already under constant attack from Hollybolly beast and whole P2P dies off on slow, agonizing way.

What suits better most ""humans"" than helping in that evil, performing collective 'coupe de grace' (French: ""mercy killing"").
Knowing that number of insane people raises above one half of human population, what else we should expect?

That part (big, ""inner"" problem) I touched two days ago, deliberately vague, explaining how most of the independent encoders migrated to uploading on file-hosting services, where they earn, not give money away, getting few Thanks but few heavy slaps too. 24-42$ per 1000 downloads is enough money in some countries too go after anyone who ""take bread out of their mouths"". 

That is one of newest ""origins"" of vicious attacks toward few veteran uploaders. Some would go away from this mess, and common downloaders would initially think ""So what, let find some other water-hole"".

And that is the problem: one day sheep would try to find water - but all holes would be ""contaminated"" or empty - and then, would  nostalgically tell stories about ""good old times"" - not mentioning that signs of incoming dark future was in place, back then, but the ignored them altogether.

Blessings to you and ones you love."
