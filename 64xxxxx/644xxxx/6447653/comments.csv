[T],MelloYello,2011-06-06T00:08Z,It was between IMAGINE V3 TS and EP1C Repack TS.  I chose IMAGINE as my source because they had the extra scene during/after the credits that I considered to be important to the next sequel they do.

[T],MelloYello,2011-06-06T03:28Z,Imgbay doesn't seem to be working right now.  So my screens  aren't working.  Also the reason no one's pictures of movie poster or dvd covers are showing.  Superbay forum also seems to not be working.
