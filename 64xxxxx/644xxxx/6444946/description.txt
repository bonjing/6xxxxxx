volume two [2011]

You see there was a time when Lion had lost his roar. Crocodile was snapping at all the animals in Tinga Tinga and ruling over the Waterhole. Lion could do nothing about it, he had lost his roar. Then one day Flea tells Lion that if Lion dares to enter the Great Cave of Tinga Tinga maybe he will find his roar. Lion plucks up courage and confronts the Great Cave. He roars with all his might, an even bigger roar comes back... But Lion stands strong. He roars again and an even bigger roar comes back. Lion's very own Echo! He has found his roar! From that day on Lion always roars with pride, showing any beast who's the real King of Tinga Tinga.
