In 2005 Andreas Pettersson signed with Universal to release the critically acclaimed Gullin on Guitar (Universal-Sonet). This CD is a tribute to the famous Swedish baritone saxophonist Lars Gullin whose impact on Swedish jazz cannot be overemphasized. However, Andreas Pettersson decided to rearrange these famous compositions to make them sound a little different and up-to-date. The concept Gullin on Guitar turned out to be a great success, by some journalists even called groundbreaking and Andreas and his quartet travelled extensively all over Sweden.
