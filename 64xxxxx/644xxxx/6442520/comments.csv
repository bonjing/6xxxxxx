,redjadevideo,2011-06-02T18:08Z,this is in .mobi and .epub format - NOT .pdf
,cur37ious,2011-06-02T20:17Z,"Doesn't say it's in .PDF.  If you want to read it (and you SHOULD), download an .epub reader like Calibre (which also handles .mobi files, among others)."
,halfacluemaybe,2011-07-23T02:01Z,"Thanks for the download!  Stoked to read this.  Works well on my PC, but was unable to get it to work on my Nook.  Does anybody know if it's possible to get .epub files downloaded as torrents to work with e-readers?"
