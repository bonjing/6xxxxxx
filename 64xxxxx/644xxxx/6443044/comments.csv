,2010kaiser,2011-06-26T12:43Z,"Nothing wrong with the torrent esty69!

1. Run the install .exe
2. Un-tick the launch at the last step of the install.
3. Disable your AV.
4. Run the Patch. (show it the file path C / Program Files/ Fix Cleaner.
5. Launch Fix Cleaner.
6. Run Serials.
7. Copy / Paste.
8. Register.

Done!!!!

Nice up Anacondaz!!  :)"

,TBONE2010,2011-09-24T10:40Z,"Worked fine for me following 21Kaiser's instructions. (Cheers) Also, it fixed my 'Windows Update' error. Thanks Anacondaz!"
,AmandaT,2011-10-01T22:27Z,what do u mean by UN-Tick?
,Exphailure,2011-10-20T19:36Z,"I've downloaded several things like this and never got a virus notification. Upon scanning this with AVAST! it does indeed have two virus... my goal is to make my PC run better, not risk ruining it. No thanks."
,Drejkt,2011-11-05T00:09Z,When I open the KeyGen or the patch AVG free is also telling me that they both have a Trojan and make me move it to the vault. Doesnt look very safe to me..... Do you think kaiser could maybe be the one created the virus and is LYING so you will install the trojan? What does the pink Skull and Crossbones next to the uploaders name mean? Anyone know?
,Drejkt,2011-11-05T00:21Z,"Wait..... Kaiser..... I see in step 3 you suggest disabling your Anti Virus?? Doesnt that seem like an inherently TERRIBLE idea?? Oh yea, just disable your anti virus and youll be able to install the viruses successfully on your PC. Why are people so mean?? I cant wait till they die."
,cybernetcoldfusion,2011-11-12T20:56Z,"Have none of caught on yet...the virus is a fake...if u get a pop up just clean it...the program still works I tested all kinds off here this site...just ignore the virus and clean or what ever...All mine work and my AWESOME pc kicks any trojans ass!! ha ha ha...piratebay...you rock...YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok, bye!"

,cybernetcoldfusion,2011-11-12T21:01Z,"Just do what it says remove and clean it later the main thing is download the program first...after that then run the anti virus to remove it...babie trogees or what ever...I have had 3 tripple back doot worms on my pc and my pc killd all of them... don't worrie about them...
