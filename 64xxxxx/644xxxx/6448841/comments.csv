More Cepstral Voices to download: 

On this page ( https://www.cepstral.com/downloads/) you will find links to download fully-functional Cepstral Voices for Apple Macintosh OS X, Microsoft Windows, and i386-Linux. The trial period is not time-limited; It never expires. 

However, a voice will interject reminder messages into the audio output until you purchase a valid license key for it. (which you fine in the folder for this torrent) If you would like to listen to a sample of each voice before beginning your trial, visit the Demos page.... 

Register/validate the new added voices is easy: MAC OS X  System Preference then under ""Others"" you find - Cepstral Voices - use the code from the text file. "
