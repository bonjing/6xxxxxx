Narrator 2.1  from Mariner Software enables you to take text to speech. Using the rich voices already in the Mac OS X system, Narrator allows you to paste your text into the window or import an RTF, .txt or .doc file into Narrator and your letter, story â€“ any text â€“ is brought to life using voice synthesis. You can choose different voices, rates, pitches, inflections and volumes for each character you assign, giving your text a wide range of expressiveness. There are also silent read-along options for stage directions or for you to read out your own parts. And if you need more characters, you can get additional voices and in several languages.

Cepstral Voices for Mac OS X v 5.2

Is superior to the voices that ship with OS X. I like sending text to the speech system while I do things around the house. Highly recommended! in this folder you find 5 additional voices with registration code (see txt.file)
