Movie - God awful!  

According to the pic George A Romero ""Cant wait for Zombie Undead""! Well hope you thought it was worth the wait George! So poorly acted the children at my 3 year old nieces play group would have put in a better performance!  Wholly unoriginal and boringly predictable! If you like Zombie movies avoid it like the zombie plague itself!"
