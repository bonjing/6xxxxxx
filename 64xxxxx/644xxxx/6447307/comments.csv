It's better than a CAM."
,IngesFingers,2011-06-06T08:30Z,"Mmm... well, it's not awful, but I'd only give it 5 for video as it was obviously PPV formatted for the kind of primitive TV aspect that was the norm a decade ago."
,lambofgodman,2011-06-06T17:52Z,As always great work and thanks so much.
,RedKing13_ca,2011-06-07T04:20Z,Do they not have HD PPV?
,spifkitten99,2011-06-07T11:47Z,"I don't get this about ppv releases.

It's pay per view. Who would pay to watch a movie in such quality?

First it's cropped to 4:3. Then it's stretched to 16:9. And the the picture quality is horrible.

Why?"
