,phoenix5794,2011-06-03T02:16Z,"Yes, yours are the only ones that works. All of the others have issues.
Great torrent - thanks."
,gundum584,2011-06-03T02:17Z,"why is it detecting this as a trojan?

,raxielz,2011-06-03T02:20Z,"Hey in all honesty, if this didn't have the THETA tag, i wouldn't even have downloaded it. i was waiting for this to come up xD"
,JTvC,2011-06-03T02:23Z,Worked like a charm! :)
,gundum584,2011-06-03T02:23Z,Why is it only showing one comment?
,Don_patch,2011-06-03T02:26Z,"im sorry, but I downloaded it and it is a Frostwire torreny. No clue how to get past this point though"
,the-astro,2011-06-03T02:28Z,hm...
,the-astro,2011-06-03T02:31Z,"I really don't like the ""TR/Crypt.XPACK.Gen"" with his keylogging tendencies on my pc :/ weird I ddin't get a warning like this on the 1.0.2 tho...uploader seems legit so don't take my word on it, I'm just a little paranoid about those things..."
,the-astro,2011-06-03T02:35Z,"damn comments won't show up, I have to post so I can see them. :/"
,Thunder1909,2011-06-03T02:40Z,"Yeah man, great release, this is one of the few reliable cracks out there."
,Hoeupsit,2011-06-03T02:47Z,"You have many reasons to upload this and I'm glad you did. Personally, I prefer to wait for THETA releases as I know they work. "
,miguelsz3,2011-06-03T03:12Z,"Your virus scanners are detecting ""False Positives"". It's cuase Theta started using a custom installer and that's making virus scanners go mad, but rest assured it's safe. :3

(I even installed it on my pc.... though I suppose that does very little..... Since the uploader's word rarely counts?) "
,miguelsz3,2011-06-03T03:20Z,"Awww you pirate lads and lassy are sweet -0-

P.S.
@Don_patch
Whatchu be talkin bout bro? 
I made this torrent with Bittorrent not frostwire...... Soooo how ye be doin?!? @.o"
,pwnjangles,2011-06-03T03:41Z,Great upload thanks so much...Also what's the song's names in your loader? their so fuckin' badass.
,Xx_ucantwin_xX,2011-06-03T06:26Z,Don't ever get discouraged by other uploads i will always get yours because i know it is legit and working perfect. Thanks for upload
,Prodigeee,2011-06-03T06:58Z,"I know it probably does but, if you move from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 does it keep your saves? Also if I bought the game off steam would there be a way to transfer my saves from this to steam?"
,Firedog118,2011-06-03T08:38Z,"Brilliant upload, works brilliantly, just like the other versions you uploaded, thanks :D

@Prodigee
It should do, but just be safe, go to (if you're on windows)
""My Documents\My Games\Terraria""
and back up the files inside it, then install the new version."
,Telenim,2011-06-03T08:48Z,"It's fine sandboxed, every file after unpacking scans safe."
,ryuzaky7,2011-06-03T11:11Z,is stopping at 99.4 wtf? why i want to download it soo badly wth just happenend is not loading more than 99.4 with bitcomet lol

,Jaex2k,2011-06-03T11:24Z,"Keep uploading these, miguel, you're the only one I'm downloading these updates from :-)"
,multicebe,2011-06-03T14:57Z,Doesnt start. When I click it shows the computer working mouse and then disapears and nothing happens.
,QuantumMonkey_,2011-06-03T15:17Z,"Thanks, and for people whose anti-virus software detected it as a virus, it's because of the crack by THETA, don't worry, it's safe."
,the-astro,2011-06-03T15:34Z,"this is good, I take back all my doubtfull comments :) "
,miguelsz3,2011-06-03T16:28Z,"@multicebe
.....Hrmmmm, it sounds like you have a common problem, have you installed Microsoft .NET Framework 4 and Microsoft XNA Framework 4? If not then the game will crash when starting up ...."
,sssu1,2011-06-03T20:05Z,"Thanks, was waiting this to get to play on my friends (who has the steam one) server. :)"
,BLV3-B34RD,2011-06-03T20:21Z,"Thank you, miguelsz3 !!!
Because of you, I can play games with my son."
,Duhya2,2011-06-03T22:41Z,You should post a link to where Theta releases these on the next torrent.
,miguelsz3,2011-06-04T02:47Z,".....Hrmmm, Pirating.... Making the world a better place :3"
,SplendidTutorials123,2011-06-04T03:22Z,Thank you for uploading these. Sorry there are too many stupid people that think this is a virus. You are awesome.
,TRStrsTRS,2011-06-04T15:18Z,When i was unraring the two files a virus was automatically deleted both times...
,miguelsz3,2011-06-04T16:22Z,"It's a false positive, just turn of your anti-virus software and then unrar it."
,Xsyiaris,2011-06-05T00:24Z,"Just saying , but after scanning this file...
It say's its infected with trojan."
,miguelsz3,2011-06-05T01:06Z,"It's becuase of Theta's custom installer....... Though now that I think about it... Why did theta start using a custom installer anyway? Im sure people already know how to apply cracks if there downloading from torrents right??? Hrmm...... and what's the point of making a custom installer that makes virus scanners go nuts!?!? Meh.... whatever... all I can tell you is that it's safe... If you dont install it then fine, and if you do be happy -0-"
,KalChoedan,2011-06-05T19:35Z,I have the same problem as multicebe - app thinks for a bit then shuts down with no error message or anything.  Have verified updated .NET and XNA.  Win 7 64 bit.
,miguelsz3,2011-06-05T23:42Z,"@KalChoedan 
Hrmmm there are multiple reasons for the crash on start-up and if it's not Xna and .Net then it might either be some issue with your soundcard or it could be something with your config.dat file being corrupted and all.... Delete it in your 
My Documents/My Games/Terraria folder
and try to run the game agian..... If that doesnt work then there isnt much of anything else I can do. Sooo if it doesnt fix your problem....... Then im sorry...."
,ncc46537,2011-06-06T13:59Z,"Anybody able to find an ATI Radeon Xpress 200m series standalone driver installer?
Need to update the drivers on a friend's laptop, but their network card is fried and they don't want to get a new one...
I've looked, but all I can find is the ATI Catalyst software, which requires an internet connection."

,miguelsz3,2011-06-06T18:00Z,"@fgsfddss 
Yes, online works there is no protection on servers as of yet so cracked games can easily connect to official servers.... Of course it requires alot of trial and error sense you have to find servers that'll actually work for you.... =/"

,bilzinki,2011-06-09T18:40Z,"i installed this torrent today after turning off my anti-virus then i went to the toilet when i came back my computer had froze so i turned it off, when i turned it back on it started up fine and then a few minutes later it froze again, that kept happening untill i ran my laptop in safe mode and uninstalled this torrent , i not sure if this happened because of what laptop i have but i have a sony vaio so if u have one i wouldnt recommend installing this"
,miguelsz3,2011-06-09T19:22Z,"Hrmmm, that's odd that shouldn't be happening I wonder why?..... Are you running the game itself when the computer freeze's or does your computer just freeze in general after installing it?"
,mo654,2011-06-09T21:51Z,1.0.4 is out is there cracked version 
,miguelsz3,2011-06-09T22:07Z,It isnt out yet....... It should be coming out Friday (June 10) though =/

,Ryucosu,2011-06-10T00:27Z,"Yeah my kaspersky Dectecs a Trojan as well but HAVE NO FEAR FELLOW PIRATES! its the installer i did a bit of research and the uploder is correct. also for those whos computers freeze Do CTRL ALT Deleate, it will show hundreds of multiple programs the same one opening, it happend to me to. well i dont know how in the fuck to fix it but it went away after i fiddled around with the program and my kaspersky and it works now... miguelsz3 your torrents work they are not infected good job for giving quality torrents. also the new update 1.4 comes out tommarow make shure you get it, and to be on the safe side turn off your internet connection after downloding the torrent, i do this everytime just in case of a working trojan."
,Ryucosu,2011-06-10T00:31Z,"ooo yeah miguelsz3 theta is not being trusted as much as before and there are internet rumors of them traceing IP's of pirators/ Installing malewhear, not saying THIS torrent has it but if confermed (probibly by geeknews or Anonymous, Thank god for them) please take down any torrent you uploded that contained ANY content from theta. could be a rumor but id rather not have a whole internet community up your ass because you tryed to help a gamer out lol"
,miguelsz3,2011-06-10T02:46Z,"Thanks for the support Q.Q

Anywho if I do find out that the rumours about Theta are true, then I'll definitely delete these torrents. Cant go about screwing people over now can I? =/"
