The Cars - Move Like This 2011 (mp3 320kbs)ICM369

The Cars' last burst of glory came in 1985, when the song Drive was used 
at Live Aid to soundtrack a videomontage of famine victims. 

They split up a few years later, and leader Ric Ocasek said there was no 
chance his band â€“ one of America's definitive new-wave outfits, whose 
brittle synthpop has influenced a good few 21st-century acts would ever 
reunite. 

Inevitably, though, they have, bassist Benjamin Orr died in 2000, but the 
other original members are on board, and they've turned out an album that 
picks up where the last one left off in 1987. 

As before, the songs find the spot where brash garage-rock and bleepy 
modernism arrestingly intersect, Ocasek then applies robo-geek vocals, and 
off they go. 

Though they engage with 2011 now and then â€“ the jittery Blue Tip concerns 
the pernicious effect of the media â€“ Move Like This mainly works as a reminder 
of (or introduction to) their past.
