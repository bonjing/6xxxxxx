Alt metal outfit Cave In originated in 1995, in Methuen, MA, when Stephen Brodsky and Jay Frechette got the idea to start a band in the vein of some of their favorites: Failure, Unwound, Snapcase, etc. With Brodsky on guitar and Frechette's vocals, they added bassist Justin Matthes, guitarist Adam McGrath, and drummer John-Robert Conners, and recorded some early demos. Split 7"s with Gambit, Piebald, and Early Grace followed before Cave In got a chance for its own, courtesy of Hydra Head, which appeared in 1997. Matthes departed after the Hydra Head release and was replaced by Andy Kyte, but he didn't last longer than an East Coast tour. Frechette also left, making room for Dave Scrod, who didn't last either. Cave In next tapped Caleb Scofield (Strike 3), who worked out as both the bass player and singer. The early singles-comp Beyond Hypotermia appeared in 1998, followed by the proper full-length Until Your Heart Stops and the Creative Eclipses EP. Cave In issued the critically acclaimed Jupiter in 2000 before signing with RCA in 2001 and premiering with 2003's ambitious Antenna. In 2005, Cave In returned to Hydra Head for Perfect Pitch Black; a year later the band confirmed that it was going on an indefinite hiatus (but not breaking up) as its members explored other musical avenues.

The sign of quality in a Cave In record is whether its title refers to death by cave-in or not. Beyond Hypothermia and Until Your Heart Stops were brilliantly crushing albums that expanded the boundaries of metal and hardcore, bringing in radical rhythmic shifts, elements of psychedelia and much more. Later records journeyed into the cosmos, adorned with titles like Jupiter, Antenna, and Planets of Old, and were substantially less heavy, and less rewarding, than the band's earliest work. White Silence seems to return to the cave-in/snowed-in theme, and while it's not a full-on metal assault in the vein of Beyond and Until, it's still a terrific record. The music runs the gamut from the almost Deftones-ish "Sing My Loves," which never feels eight minutes long, to the grinding hardcore of "Vicious Circles," one of the hardest, most aggressive songs the band has ever recorded. "Centered" is a jagged burst of noise-rock, while "Summit Fever" combines distorted vocals with a huge, almost classic rock riff. The album concludes with three pastoral, indie friendly, acoustic-guitar-dominated songs in a row. Cave In has always been a multifaceted band, but their stylistic range has never been as thoroughly explored as it is on White Silence.
