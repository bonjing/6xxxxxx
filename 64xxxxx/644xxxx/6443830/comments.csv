A/8 
V/8  
Good quality picture and audio, the picture has been bordered down to a 16:9 format and thereâs the L1/LI watermark thatâs in the righthand side bottom corner. The audio is pretty clean for a PPV, All in all a really good copy and is certainly worth the download if your not wanting to wait for a DVDRip... 
Many Thanx to IFLIX for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
