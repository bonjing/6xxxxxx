Notes:

 - Reseed/mirror; not my encode. Couldn't find it here, found it elsewhere, here it is. If the audio is indeed stereo, it would be certainly simulated.
 
 - Won 1934 Best Adapted Writing Oscar, also nominated for Best Director and Best Picture.

 - Please make sure to seed as much as you download and do your part so that free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
