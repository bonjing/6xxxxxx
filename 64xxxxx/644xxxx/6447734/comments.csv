Thought I'd try this one (has external subs , you know my problem :-) ) .
For some reason it freezes at 57 seconds with slight burps of audio .
So I extracted the audio and video (has subs in the mkv file as well) and muxed them into a Mp4 file and it plays fine apart from an A/V synch delay . For example , right at the beginning when he gets out of the car and closes the door there is a C: 17 second delay from where you hear the door close and then see him close it .
I don't think it's my netbook .
Just thought I'd let you know .
Cheers ."
