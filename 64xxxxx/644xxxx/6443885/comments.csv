It's happened a lot lately on TPB :("
,gratefulforthis,2011-06-03T02:00Z,Scrap that...it's an https issue. http works fine :)
,gratefulforthis,2011-06-03T02:11Z,"Dude...any chance you can dish out more bandwidth on your new torrent.

Went from 200kb in the first 2 mins to now struggling at 40 :("
,gratefulforthis,2011-06-03T02:18Z,"Me again! Ha!

I'm currently uploading faster than I'm downloading this from you. Obviously that's not going to last.

20kb down...30 up!

Why are you strangling your own gig? lol

Is there an issue or is it just the way it goes?

Getting 600kbs on another download."
[V],SaM,2011-06-03T02:48Z,this is seeding from 2 servers one at 20 MB/s  and the other one at 5 MB/s
,gratefulforthis,2011-06-03T02:52Z,"Why upload a new file when the 8 people who have 100% aren't even giving anything out?

Deleted and moving on.

,Swanee1,2011-06-03T08:58Z,"'gratefulforthis', I would suggest that perhaps those who have 100% have probably already uploaded more than the 100%. For example, I have only downloaded 30mb but have already uploaded more than 50mb of this same file."
