Thanks :)"
,stormvader,2011-06-02T16:04Z,"This is an old crack that works for a while then you get blacklisted!!
Use BOX 3.1.3 Trial Reset instead"
,wullie7362,2011-06-02T19:03Z,"@stormvader

If you don't like it don't download it!"
[T],faren73,2011-06-03T01:44Z,@Sync77 then you will likely be dead by sometime tomorrow. This is probably the S&P crack that screwed everyone up months ago. when u do get blacklisted you will be left with no real-time protection at all!  uninstalling and retrying will not do you any good! i think i had to reformat to get norton on again
,stormvader,2011-06-03T08:06Z,"@faren73 is right It is the S&P crack
I got the blue screen of death when I uninstalled Norton!!!
Luckily I had backed up PC with Acronis"
,FridayToker,2011-06-03T09:33Z,"@stormvader73

Why did you download it if you knew it was the S&P crack?
I downloaded this from another site 4 weeks ago and it's still working fine."
