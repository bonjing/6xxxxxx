Documentary about the city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, having as model and inspiration the previous Berlin: Die Sinfonie der GroÃŸstadt (1927).

During the 1920s and the 1930s, the German Walter Benjamin wrote about cities. He was born in Berlin, but felt in love with Paris. In 1927, Walter Ruttmann directed the fantastic "Berlin: Die Sinfonie der GroÃŸstadt".

Surprisingly, Brazil was tuned with Europe and was the unique country in Latin America that produced modern movies about and influenced by the metropolis. In 1926, it was released a documentary about Recife. In 1928, Humberto Mauro directed his "Sinfonia de Cataguases", ("Symphony of Cataguases") a short inspired in "Berlin: Die Sinfonie der GroÃŸstadt". In Porto Alegre, it was produced "A Princesinha do Sul".

"SÃ£o Paulo, Sinfonia da MetrÃ³pole", directed by the Hungarian Adalberto Kemeny and Rudolf Rex Lustig, is the most famous and important Brazilian documentary totally inspired in the German classic. The film begins with the dawn, with the city "waking-up", ending in the sunset, showing the dynamics of a big city and its dwellers. My vote is eight.
