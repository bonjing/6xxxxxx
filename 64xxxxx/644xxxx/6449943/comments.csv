,elessarGObonzo,2011-06-06T22:33Z,"upload a better description rabir. what's longer and harder? lengthened maps, enemies with higher armor/stronger weapons? what New Effects? what about the graphics? new guns toned down to older flat textures...?"
,Armstrong14,2011-06-07T00:07Z,"He says ""hahahahhahaha"" because it is fake. If you believe this torrent (the bloddy game was JUST ANNOUNCED TODAY), you are a moron and shouldn't be downloading torrents."
,Armstrong14,2011-06-07T00:08Z,"He says ""hahahahhahaha"" because this is a geniune FAKE. If you believe this is a real torrent of the JUST ANNOUNCED Halo remake, you good sirs are 100% morons."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-06-07T03:02Z,"doesnt say Halo Anniversary. seems more like mod bullshit. come on rabir, enlighten us."
,rabir,2011-06-07T07:24Z,"Well, if u think it is fake, just dont download noob...
NAd the answer for elessar:
-Yes better graphics
-Bigger Sp maps, with new enemies (Brutes, H2 Hunter, ETC.)
-Better exlosion effect, better firing effects (new graphics)
And the all of the guns have new graphics, and there is only H2, and H3 weapons...

And its not fake, i made this mod... With the CMT's SP maps, and halo modders created MP maps... If you dont belive, just try it..."
