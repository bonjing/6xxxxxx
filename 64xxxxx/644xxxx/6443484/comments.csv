1112?"
,aerotoystore,2011-06-11T03:48Z,"Okay, so I have been a user of JV for a long time. My current install of JV has been in place for a few years now. I am well versed in installing JV using cycle 0901, 0906, and so forth and so on. So why is it the coverage key code provided for full worldwide is not working, and thus I am receiving the following message:
Invalid coverage key entered: 030KO05915. Please re-enter this key.

Any ideas?"
,aerotoystore,2011-06-11T03:49Z,"I should add that I currently have cycle 1110 installed using the typical serial which is floating around. Anyone actually have success installing this? If so, list the coverage keys please."
,aerotoystore,2011-06-11T05:50Z,Can anyone confirm if the coverage codes are applicable to Serial Number VNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F
,aerotoystore,2011-06-11T17:00Z,"Okay, strangest thing ever. I try installing today with Coverage Key 030KO05915 and all of a sudden it works. So, I can confirm that at least the full worldwide coverage key works, and I suspect the other two coverage keys work as well."
,aerotoystore,2011-06-11T17:02Z,"Much thanks to the uploader for this, and to those who provided the coverage keys. I'm not sure why I couldn't get it to work yesterday, and why all of a sudden it decides to cooperate today. Anyhow, thanks for the upload!"
