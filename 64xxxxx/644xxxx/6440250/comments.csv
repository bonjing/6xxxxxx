,schrade,2011-06-13T22:52Z,"I keep getting this problem:

org.lwjgl.opengl.GL11.glViewport(GL11.java:3199)
 zombie.f.b.b(Unknown Source)
 zombie.GameApplet.gameLoop(Unknown Source)
 zombie.b.run(Unknown Source)""

I Also have the latest Java 6. Not Java 7, Going to Java 6 was a suggestion as to how to fix the problem but didn't work for me. Can anyone please help? I really want to try this game."

This is a pre-alpha game, crashes are something that you will always have. Although this version is already outdated, so maybe try a newer version."
