,AMoveFan,2011-06-13T07:22Z,this question isn't being asked about your upload aoloffline but I have tried a 1080 p I have a Galaxy 430 graphics card and I can play most 1080 p flawlessly but I tried playing unknown 1080 p and it's only 1.90 gb and at really random times little squares pop up I guess that would be tilling but would anyone know how to fix this or is it the uploaders falt and I am using VLC player Gom can't handle 1080 p at all.
