From Wikipedia:

City of Evil is the third studio album and first major label release by American metal band Avenged Sevenfold. The album was released on June 7, 2005 under the Warner Bros. Records label. Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, City of Evil contains a more hard rock and classic heavy metal sound than Avenged Sevenfold's previous two albums, which showcased a predominantly metalcore sound. The album is also notable for the absence of screaming vocals. M. Shadows worked with vocal coach Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and Chris Cornell, for months before the album's release to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having the tone".
