These Vinyl rips were recorded on a Denon DP-45F turntable using an Audio Technica AT120E cartridge. The preamplifier was a Cambridge 640P. Sound card, an ASUS XONAR Essence ST (Windows 7).
Recorded using Audacity 1.3 Beta. Pops, Clicks, and Noise removed using iZotope Rx Advanced 2.01 software.
iZotope was easily the most important part of this process. Some of my vinyl is fifty years old. All were recorded using 32 bit float at 96 kHz sample rate, then ouputed to 32 bit 96 kHz WAV files, then edited with iZotope. The edited WAV files were then converted to 24-96 FLAC files and 320 bitrate mp3 at 48 kHz sample rate.

This is A Lot of work folks!

 History

The two sessions mark Powell's fourth recording date as leader, following on from the February 1950 session for Jazz Giant.

The three takes of "Tea for Two" at the start of the CD release recall the classic 1955 LP release of The Amazing Bud Powell, which opens with three takes of "Un Poco Loco". Although the three versions here don't display the cumulative explorations of the "Un Poco Loco" takes, the sheer velocity and attack on each is remarkable.

Powell's composition "Parisian Thoroughfare", a "classic bop vehicle",[1] has been recorded by several other artists, most notably Clifford Brown in 1954 (Clifford Brown & Max Roach), with Bud's brother Richie Powell on piano.

 Release history

The album was originally released as the 12" LP Bud Powell's Moods (Mercury / Clef MGC 610), and later re-released and re-titled The Genius of Bud Powell (Clef MGC 739, Verve MGV 8115).[2] Confusingly, another album containing different sessions (from 1954 and 1955) was subsequently released as Bud Powell's Moods (Norgran MGN 1064).[3] Confusingly again, in the late 1970s Verve released a double LP also called The Genius of Bud Powell, coupling the single-disc Genius with Jazz Giant, and also a follow-up double LP called The Genius of Bud Powell, Volume 2, containing sessions from 1954-56.

On the CD release, the additional version of "Tea for Two" marked "take 5" (aka "compilation take") had previously been released in the 50s on a V.A. compilation called Piano Interpretations. The version marked "take 10" (aka "78 take") had appeared on 78/45 rpm singles and on the 10" LP Piano Solos #2.
