,Philonetic,2011-06-05T22:55Z,"Don't stop seeding people. Fuck a copyright infringement, you aren't allowing people to copy the files from any website you own, it's bullshit. You have to be allowing people to copy whole files directly from you for infringement.  Use PeerBlock with iblocklist updated lists and KEEP SEEDING!!! "

,samosa81,2011-06-05T23:53Z,first i want to say thankyou to EP1C. i havent seen it yet but i expect it will be better than nothing so i cant complain. i really want to see this at the cinema so i might just have to do it. but im too eager to wait until orange wednesday! mehh ;)
,viduplode,2011-06-06T01:53Z,is it just me or is this downloading reallyreallyreally slowly? its going like 1kb/s
,jjf3,2011-06-06T02:00Z,"I don't know why ppl are saying that there are shadows of ppl in this screener. There isn't! T

he only complaint I have about this one is that there are weird flashes that happen at the beginning of some scenes and during these flashes the picture gets somewhat pixelated. 

If it wasn't for that I'd actually rate this an 8. But it has to stay a 7 for video. The only audio complaint I have is that some of the scenes do not have subtitles when they are speaking in Russian, not sure if that was the movie or not though. "
,roy_thetaz,2011-06-06T11:42Z,same as the 700 mb one..
,prisciltje,2011-06-06T13:43Z,thanks
,some-young-guy,2011-06-06T14:58Z,"@ Cassack, Peer block only blocks the anti P2P trackers, but if the internet account has a monthly data transfer cap, over seeding may be a problem, and if exceeded, service may be terminated for a year.  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6264370/uTorrent_IP_mask is a torrent the same as peer block.

@ Poogle Moogle2, your dad should have sprayed you all over your mom's face you fuckin plug."
,some-young-guy,2011-06-06T15:05Z,2.4 MB/s is my download speed.  That is extremely fast

,BerciK1515,2011-06-07T20:11Z,"Nice quality.I can't find polish subtitles, 
But i can speak english very well :D 

God bless english teachers :D"
,Phathead117,2011-06-08T12:39Z,Does a wierd black flashy thing which gets really irritating.. however apart from that great quality for a cam though will be looking forward to the dvdrip.
,BostonRippah,2011-06-11T21:55Z,"As far as cams go it is very watchable, audio is clear and synced. The only problem is the English subtitles are difficult (not impossible) to read over the foreign subtitles. However this does not occur too much after the beginning of the movie.
