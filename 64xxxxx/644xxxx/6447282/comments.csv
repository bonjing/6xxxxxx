avira flagged it on my pc and norton flagged it on another

uploader should delete it and repack it"

I'm not sure what DLL you're even talking about, but I scanned them all again and they come up clean. I also scan all my releases to my satisfaction before uploading. It is a false positive and not malicious, so nothing to worry about. Nothing turns up when scanned with Norton, NOD32 or SUPERAntiSpyware"
