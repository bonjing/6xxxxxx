Anand was a well-known, well-respected doctor. One dark and stormy night, he met a young woman at the side of the road. He gave her a ride. She asked to be dropped off at a graveyard. There, she disappeared singing a love song, "Naina Barse." Anand began to hear that song more and more often. His mother arranged a marriage for him. His bride was the very woman he dropped off at the graveyard! Woh kaun thi? (Who was she?)
