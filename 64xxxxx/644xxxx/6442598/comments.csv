Discovered: February 19, 2010 
Updated: February 25, 2010 4:33:47 AM 
Type: Trojan 
Systems Affected: Windows 98, Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows Me, Windows Vista, Windows NT, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000 Trojan.Gen is a generic detection for many individual but varied Trojans for which specific definitions have not been created. A generic detection is used because it protects against many Trojans that share similar characteristics. 

Trojan horse programs pose as legitimate programs or files that users may recognize and want to use. They rely on this trick to lure a user into inadvertently running the Trojan. Often a Trojan will mimic a well known legitimate file name or pose as a particular type of file, like a .jpg or .doc file to trick a user.

Distribution of Trojans on to compromised computers occurs in a variety of ways. From email attachments and links to instant messages, drive-by downloads and being dropped by other malicious software. Once installed on the compromised computer, the Trojan begins to perform the predetermined actions that it was designed for.
