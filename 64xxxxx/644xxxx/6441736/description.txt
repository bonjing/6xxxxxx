The Wall, Pink Floyd's 1979 concept album about a rock star's mental breakdown, is a towering monster. It was inspired by then-bandleader Roger Waters' own mental collapse at the end of the Floyd's tour for the Animals album. The Wall tells the story of a rock star named Pink and his downward spiral into madness, and all the things in his life that led him there: his father killed in the war when he was only a baby, being smothered by his overbearing mother, subjected to abuse at school, and later, the pressures of his rock-star lifestyle and the breakdown of his marriage. Quite simply, The Wall is a rock masterwork, and arguably Roger Waters' greatest achievement as a composer.
