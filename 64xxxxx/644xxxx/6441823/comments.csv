   Thanks for getting these out! Cool..."
,unrelent,2011-06-04T07:52Z,"My pleasure.  Thanks for all you do over at sebaygo's place.  Just FYI - 10:30pm or so is about as early as I will be able to up Rivero as his show airs during my work shift.  So far though, his files have been available at renseradio when I get home.

Keep listening!  Knowledge is Power."
