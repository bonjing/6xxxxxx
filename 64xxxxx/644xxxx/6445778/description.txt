A Hamilton, Ontario-based electronic pop group, Junior Boys began as a duo with its duties split between Jeremy Greenspan and Johnny Dark. Influenced by a number of music sectors -- including arty synth pop, minimal techno, U.K. garage, and contemporary hip-hop.   Dark opted to leave the group (he would go on to release solo material and form one half of the duo Stereo Image), but former Warp employee Nick Kilroy heard the songs and became interested enough to start the KIN label with Junior Boys as its first artist.
