,.EzDL,2011-06-02T17:35Z,"@selbyftw, no prob, i can rip them in better quality but the size will be higher. enjoy."
,AndyM11,2011-06-02T18:21Z,Flv? What the hell is that? Why would you do that.
,AndyM11,2011-06-02T18:25Z,Delete my comment? DUDE why did you upload this in FLV. YOU are an idiot.
,.EzDL,2011-06-02T19:04Z,"@AndyMD11, Your a retard. a FLV is a very common file type now. Download VLC Media player and watch it with that.

VLC MEDIA PLAYER PEOPLE"
,MrRubiiks,2011-06-02T19:57Z,"Its great thanks mate, idk why @AndyMD11 complained about FLV, is a good type of file for torrents

,SyKoPeTe,2011-06-03T13:08Z,Cheers! You should get green skull for this. Not seen anyone else upload. thanks.
,kidjersey,2011-06-03T17:00Z,"First off, thanks for the upload. I live in the states and have no way to get this otherwise so I appreciate it. However the .flv is a pain. Could you please create it as a 350mb avi? Thanks"
,.EzDL,2011-06-03T19:19Z,"@KidJersey, Np, i will convert and upload another torrent as an AVI for you."
,fraserfinlay777,2011-06-03T22:03Z,"Picture gets a bit too stretched out when using full screen but not really a big problem.

V:8
A:10

Good upload and really good file size but could you please upload the rest of the series in avi? I would appreciate it!

Thanks Uploader! +1"
,somebodyelse222,2011-06-04T22:22Z,"Thing is, my DVD player will play Divx/Avi, but FLV is only playable on the computer - that's why I prefer avi. 
Despite that, I'm totally appreciative of the uploaders' work, so will say 'thank you' whatever the format. I can always convert it afterwards..
Thank you!!!!"
,SyKoPeTe,2011-06-05T04:48Z,Yer i agree. I normally watch via my xbox (usb) so was unable to do so but i got to watch it is main thing. avi would be more suitable though.. cheers.
,longjohnshane,2011-06-05T04:58Z,"Its all well and good to say ""VLC Media Player people"" but many people don't live at their computer. A lot like to throw it on a TV thats why they prefer .avi. Thats all. 90% of people on earth already use VLC but thanks for the tech support.

Uploader- Great job, lovin this trashy show btw! :P"
,longjohnshane,2011-06-05T05:00Z,"Also I use xilisoft, cos it converts many different thing, its not freeware but you are at Pirate Bay *hint hint*"
,kalas-claes,2011-06-06T19:08Z,"Wow, this is the only public rls of E02 (except the newly uploaded avi-make cause of a few faggots complaining) and yet most people complain.. Thank you uploader, I don't live in the UK and can't watch GS so this is really the last way out for me.

And again, to all the bloody fools, if you can't get this any other way, force the format to 4:3 and set it to touch the window from the outside and voilĂÂ , it's just like TV as per usual..

Also, if you don't know how to play FLV files you shouldn't be allowed to own a computer. "
,.EzDL,2011-06-06T23:17Z,"@kalas-claes  No problem. Do not worry, i will be uploading every other episode for everyone to watch who's not able to watch it in the UK.

Just check on here the day after it's aired in the UK, So the next episode i will upload will be mid day on wednesday :).
