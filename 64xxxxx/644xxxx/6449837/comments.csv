,Tom1042,2011-06-07T11:41Z,"thanx for uploading in dvd format, much easier to burn a copy,  don't listen to the idiot above ! And keep up the good work, disregard unegratefull people like: xllegendsniperx"
,marthafar,2011-06-07T14:43Z,"The provenance of this a far from clear. The name of the torrent includes the phrase ""PPVRip2DVD"", which might be understood to mean ""Pay Per View rip to DVD"". However, the ""Read before Playing"" text file included with the torrent implies the source is a cinema cam scam (""Dit is een upload van Dutch Movie Theatre""). So which is it: a cam or a PPV rip? To make things a little more complicated, there is a similar upload, made about 6 hours later, which is exactly the same file size but describes itself as a ""promo"". What is the relation between these two uploads? Is one a rip or copy of the other? Some clarity would be appreciated. And can we also have a standardised form for presenting provenance please? Tak."
,marthafar,2011-06-08T15:34Z,Caveat emptor: this release has hard subs!
,LeTsGeTsPeeD,2011-06-13T16:06Z,"this is not dvd quality, it's like a ts2dvd not a ppvrip2dvd"
,marthafar,2011-06-14T13:46Z,"@LeTsGeTsPeeD: At first I would have said the same, and would have expected a sharper, cleaner, image. But it is still very watchable. I found the hard subs more of a distraction than the quality of the image. There has been a recent flurry of Source Code uploads; they all seem to be derived from the same source, which would appear to be this release."
