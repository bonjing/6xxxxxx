For the best news watch Aljazeera English and maybe you will understand the world. "

Some I don't care for, like Glen Beck. Oreilly seems like a pretty nice guy with interesting guests. I wish the commercials were edited out.

I've seen some interesting stuff on Al Jazeera English, but not much is uploaded here. If you have access, why don't you upload programs you find interesting instead of disparaging those you disagree with."
