,nickgf,2011-06-04T19:36Z,"Hi,

I'm applying the Fix right now but when I put in the 2 files from the Generations folder into the Generations game folder in C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin folder, I didn't have to replace anything. The application in there was: TS3EP04, and the one I put in was TS3W. Should I delete the TS3EP04 application?

Thank you in advance!"
[T],Games4theworld,2011-06-04T21:05Z,"Hello,

@nickgf

That's because you should copy the crack not to the Expansion's game directory, but to The Sims 3 base game's directory, which is - like written in the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" -: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Game\Bin


TO EVERYONE ELSE:

Thank you for your support and please KEEP seeding, since there are also people who want to have this game as much as you wanted to have it.
Also, IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, please refer to our Forum, instead of commenting on this page. I'm already having a hard time answering all posts on the Forum. Thank you.

1) When I first boot up I get an error window, essentially saying ""You have modded this game illegally, and it may not work properly."" I click ""Continue"" and it boots up the game fine, and I'm currently winging around testing everything. It doesn't seem to effect the game, but should I be worried about this error? What can I do to fix it?

2) If I were to purchase this expansion, will I be able to copy/paste my saved game into a retail version or will it... know... of my dirty deed? 

Thank you again for this wonderful upload! It installed quick and easy and runs wonderfully!"

It's normal-ish, and okay for that error to pop up, so no worries. :-)

I am still curious about if I can back up my current town should I buy Generations and if it will work when I paste it into the official expansion, but I'm just assuming it will work. A save game is a save game!"

True, the game has lots of bugs, but that doesn't take away the fun. You can still enjoy the game. Most people won't even find the bugs very annoying.
