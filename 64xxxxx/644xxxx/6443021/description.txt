FUBAR WinFuck 2011
------------------

New application in the FUBAR-series!

This one will fill up your monitor, memory and Windows-kernel with useless windows!
Lots of them, as many as your computer can handle. And a few more... :)

Whenever any of these windows are being closed, Windows will log off immediately!



Here is how you remove it:

Boot up in safe-mode.

Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe), and browse to this key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Run
(on Windows XP, the last key will be "RunOnce")

Delete the value named FUBAR WinFuck 2011.
