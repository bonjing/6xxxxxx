"Weâ€™re introducing a wide new selection of graphics including maps of Japanese castles, civil war military commanders and supernatural monsters, along with Shinto priests and samurai. Compatible with the full version of RPG Maker VX, these new graphics will add an authentic Japanese flavour to the worlds available in RPG Maker VX.

The most attractive features of this new graphic material are the additional monsters. Weâ€™ve replaced the standard slime and dragon monsters with civil war military commanders, ninjas, demons and head spinning ghosts to provide you with a set of authentically Japanese characters.

There are over 200 new maps, monsters, main characters and face graphics to choose from in this new collection. Everything you need to create an authentic historical Japanese adventure is ready for you. This addition is perfect for those of you who already own a copy of RPG Maker and want to do more with additional themes and graphics."


This pack contains everything just the way I downloaded it. It contains all the new graphics for RPG Maker VX, including samurai, magical creatures, and army characters and sprites.
