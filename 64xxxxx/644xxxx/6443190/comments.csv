,boniac,2011-06-04T04:50Z,"Cinavia workaround:
    Go to your sound settings
    Select audio output settings
    Switch from HDMI to optical digital (even if you use HDMI)
    Select every setting there is, then SAVE IT.
    Once its saved, it will take you back to sound settings, select audio multi-output and turn it ON.
 working on 3.60 fw"

,xenosaga01,2011-06-06T23:56Z,"SaM, the movie description is wrong. It was his daughter, not his niece."
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-06-07T06:33Z,"explain to me...if it's in english, why do you need english subs wajid_pk???...

anyway...overall i thought the movie was pretty decent. although at times predictable. 

good guy, a part of some kind of order/brotherhood what have you...saves mankind or country or city....the powers that be thank him and caste him and his companions aside never to be heard from again. 

until...low and behold their job wasn't as finished as they thought....they're called upon again to save us all...

explosions here...bodies there...forbidden love blah blah blah....

honestly...who didn't see any of this coming???

A - 5, a bit loud at times. had to turn volume up and down periodically.
V - 7, a little dark in places. but that's to be expected from a theater. they intentionally run things darker.
M - 8. like i said before....decent.  "
,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-06-07T06:34Z,sorry...thanks for the upload SaM and whoever else. :-)
,Bevanda12,2011-06-07T13:14Z,quality is very good but move it self is crap if you ask me they stole half of lines from other movies lmao

,bobajob29,2011-06-07T20:58Z," something interesting i found out today, cinevia can not be picked up in dts soundtracks apparently (at least the ps3 cant pick it up), could be a way round that blasted cinevia after all ;)"
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-07T22:08Z,"@CarlosSpicyweiner 

""a little dark in places. but that's to be expected from a theater. they intentionally run things darker""

This is R5 = Region 5 (old soviet), where movies often originate from and are distributed just as screeners, without the watermark on, and in near DVD quality. This is NOT a CAM!
Just so you know if you didnĂ¤t, or maybe just misspelled or thought wrong for a sec =)"
,jasim00002,2011-06-14T17:09Z,"thanks b4 watching ,,, just downloading now :)  "
,Mixtress,2011-06-14T18:48Z,Simple Cinavia workaround....  It's called a media player.... $20 at you local computer shop.  Less than a DVD....
,iampunie,2011-06-17T02:44Z,Hey sam if u can upload Jodhaa Akbar it would be Great
,SoundBarber,2011-06-21T23:48Z,"PS3 & CINAVIA work around:

Â­audio will be 2 ch. Stereo ONLY. (surround not available)

1. Go to Sound Settings
2. Audio Settings
3. Select Optical Digital
4. Check all Boxes*
5. Save settings
6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

*All you may need is the top 3 boxes checked. "
