Grayson Capps first discovered music in Alabama where he was born and raised. His father and friends would sit around the house getting drunk, telling stories and strumming acoustic guitars. Theyâ€™d run down songs by Hank Williams, Tom T. Hall, Glenn Campbell and Woodie Guthrie to name but a few. The idealism of those Cannery Row experiences would come to define his outlook on the world.


Couldnt find a decent Grayson torrent, so I took matters into my own hands. 

This collection includes all of his albums so far. Properly tagged. Bitrate 192 kbs.

I'll keep this one alive for a couple of days, then it\'s up to you all. 

If you enjoy the music, support Grayson Capps and buy his albums.

Cheers!
