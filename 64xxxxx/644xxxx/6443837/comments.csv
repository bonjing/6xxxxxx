,frisbe,2011-06-04T11:21Z,Just to get these completed is going to take a month with the initial seed rate. Need a better download rate so we can get some seeders or I think it will just be abandoned.
,shikibane,2011-06-04T17:59Z,@frisbe well i apologize the download is so slow. My upload speed is crap but i cant help that if this torrent dies it dies i was just trying to upload the series for people. 
,frisbe,2011-06-04T23:58Z,I understand completely. Great series and I grabbed your first volumes and really don't want to see these abandoned before we can get some seeders but yeah...doesn't look good atm.  Thanks for uploading the volumes though as it is an awesome anime.
