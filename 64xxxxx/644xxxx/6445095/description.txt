NOTES

Our releases are always virus-free. If you think you found
something suspicious, it's a problem of your security
software. All those antivirus systems will never be too
smart, so don't complain. And always remember that we are
not responsible for modified releases

We aren't stealing releases. We respect hard work of other
people and always indicate original authors of releases
We have permissions to use their files

We are doing all this for fun and knowledge only. Always
remember to support the developers if you like the product
and its quality
