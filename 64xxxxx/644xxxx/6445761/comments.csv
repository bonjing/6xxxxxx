Go to the control panel, choose Sound. Under the Playback tab, left click your speakers and choose properties. In speaker properties choose the advanced tab. There you can change your sample rate. Change the sample rate to 24 bit, 48000 Hz (studio quality) and then click apply.

Now you ll have sound. "
