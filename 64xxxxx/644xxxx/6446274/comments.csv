[V],DownTYU,2011-06-05T17:43Z,"I really recommend TPB mods to get rid of the rating system...its of no use.

2 seeds and 7 minus"
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T18:02Z,"People are probably commenting on a preview of the video. You don't have to finish the download if you use Media Player Classic for example. 

The rating system is just as bad for all the +1 given to videos that have only been uploaded very recently. "
,pjsmoke,2011-06-05T18:06Z,"People are probably only previewing the video as you can do that with Windows Media Player Classic for example, so you don't actually have to complete a download to preview the quality etc.

Also, God help me if this is a doulble post..."

What abt Unknown 2011 ???
@Minuses
Whats wrong with u people
YIFY provides the best quality for least size his uploads are always 10/10
so stop this non sense and give some RESPECT to the uploader and if u cant dont come over here"

,GrimmCro,2012-01-27T12:33Z,"@ DownTYU

The rating system should stay in place.  I have no doubt this guys' releases play on VLC, but I run my movies on KMP.  This is I believe third movie I've dld from YIFY and the result is the same.  KMP freezes.

I'm sure the up is great since some people like it, but I'm too used to KMP so I won't put a plus on this."
