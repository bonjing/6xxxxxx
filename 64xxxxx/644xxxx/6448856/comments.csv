,sparker781,2011-06-06T17:23Z,What's the a/v like?
,richardpa,2011-06-06T18:39Z,"Decent PPVRip and a fast download...
A/7
V/7  (Has the usual LI/L1 watermark in the righthand side corner)
The pictures in 4:3 format but still looks slightly cropped at the sides, there's also a slight flicker on the image now and again. The audio is slightly tinny and echoic in parts, but all in all a decent and watchable copy...
Many Thanx to froggie100 and IMAGiNE for the decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
,richardpa,2011-06-06T19:13Z,Apologies to froggie.. The LI/L1 watermark is only on the sample and not the main movie...
