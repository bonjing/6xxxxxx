                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Damson in Distress: Manager Wayne claims he cannot bear to work with assistant Marta 
 any longer, forcing owner Jonathan to intervene. The hotel's sows receive a new male
 companion, and a husband-and-wife songwriting duo check into the hotel, hoping to 
 draw inspiration from its surroundings - but a bout of snoring shatters their tranquillity.
 Last in the series.
