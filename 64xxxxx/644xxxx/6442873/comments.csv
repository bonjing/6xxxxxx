Because seeding is just as illegal as uploading it in the first place.
It's not illegal to download data but it is illegal to share it and upload it... the more you seed the more liable you are when they finally crack down hard on us pirates :D I do seed for a certain time out of courtesy but be aware that it is the same as uploading the media in the first place.

Just make the most of torrents while they last because it aint gonna last forever.. just look at limewire or frostwire more recently....."

,CarlosSpicyweiner,2011-06-03T23:47Z,"@AnderEL, 

for your benefit as well as the rest of mankind's, i am going to point out how stupid and immature you are based on your spelling alone. i will list the following mistakes as i see them. granted i myself am not a master of grammar. feel free to belittle me as you all see fit. 

1. first sentence. ""Video its okey 7/10"". two words misspelled its lacks an apostrophe. the context it still wrong in your use of it. the word okey is spelled o-k-a-y. also needs a period at the end of the sentence. 

2. ""audio as usual on a r5 barly okey 5/10"". ""on a"" should be written as ""on an R5"". barly is spelled b-a-r-e-l-y. okey, we've already covered that one. again, no period. 

3. ""keap in mind im comparing to dvd qualety so to compare to other r5"". ""keap""...k-e-e-p. ""im"" not even a real word. it's spelled i(apsotrophe)m...like this...i'm. ""qualety""...q-u-a-l-i-t-y. in essence the whole sentence is wrong in structure. no period.

i'm not even going to touch the last sentence. AnderEL, for the love of god and all that is holy, please take some english classes so you don't look/sound like as much of an asshole out here as most of the people who also cannot write in plain english. granted i'm guessing  english isn't your first language, but you could at least try. "
,LarryInColumbus,2011-06-04T00:17Z,"@Havick007
It is not illegal to download or upload files in the US.  

When you purchase music or a movie, what you are purchasing is a ""License Agreement"" which is a special contract.  Your purchase is consideration which enters you into this contractual obligation.  In the ""License Agreement"" you agree not to distribute copies to others.  If you set up a disk burning operation and sell them, then you are committing fraud which is illegal because you are knowingly making a profit from someone else's intellectual property.

If they could bust people for downloading then they would do it.  The music industry is run by foul soulless creatures.  They want paid everytime that you sing Happy Birthday to someone.  The only people that they go after are the people who do not know their rights (like you).  They just want to get a few example cases out there to make people believe that they have the upperhand but the bottom line is if people understood what they are doing, their business would be ruined.

Thank God for Piratebay and others who know how to fight them."

Since you're a member of the internet spelling and grammar police, go ahead and take your nightstick and shove it up your fag ass.

Are you fucking serious? You take the time and effort to dissect a post on TPB when no one really gives a fuck? Maybe AnderEl is not English so it may be an attempt to translate. I was able to read it and sure the grammar was not perfect but look at which site you're on! You must have some form of OCD or extremely anal retentive. But with no doubt, you're a complete loser. So do everybody a favor and get the fuck out."

,avatar2012,2011-07-04T09:46Z,"I think end77 just wants to point out that minorities are usually the first to get killed in movies. NIce rip - v=8/s=8. Movie might seem predictable to the old, but fresh to the young ~"

,kirinketsz,2011-07-07T05:53Z,sync sucks...has something wrong with the audio. doesn't play on windows media player but it will on divx.....and when it plays on divx....the audio cuts off in the movies and you have to turn off the audio and restart it every min....been running across alot of these types of issues lately with videos
,kirinketsz,2011-07-07T05:54Z,but!!! the video was clear.... it was only an audio issue

,HappyNCinnamon,2011-08-24T05:25Z,"Fantastic copy. The dark portions are clearly visible and the quality of the visuals is good throughout. It's no BluRay, but it's not quite a DVD quality rip either. The sound is perhaps a little off due to either a really poor choice in theatrical scoring with whiny-sounding horns or it could just be that the soundtrack isn't as high of quality as the video track copy, but this is the best copy out from what I can tell.

I give it the following numbers:

V:9.5  /  A:8   /   M:7.5"

,Mr.pm,2012-01-09T08:15Z,i get a v but what is m?
,stopb,2012-02-12T06:53Z,"Cinavia on this video.
Someone please take it out.
It will take to long for me but if you cut out anything not in the human hearing range you should cut it out.
Theory 2 remove 2 frames per 29 frames. (Different sections not in same order.)
Or take it out one section at a time."
,whiterussian74,2012-03-07T23:11Z,"m: value stands for overall Movie rating. Whether people fell it is a 0-10 for plot, effects, cinematography, directing, etc."
