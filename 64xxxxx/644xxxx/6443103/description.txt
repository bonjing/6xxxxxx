Dozens have been killed since Monday, when artillery explosions and machine-gun fire shattered a tenuous cease-fire that lasted less than 48 hours. We get a report from Iona Craig of The Times of London, who is in Sana'a.

- "Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, And Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon"

A prominent Wall Street analyst predicted this week that not a single top executive at Goldman Sachs will face criminal prosecution for the company's role in causing the financial meltdown of 2008. "I think there is a genuine sense out there that there are two sets of rules: One for big and powerful institutions that are deemed to be too powerful to fail, and the rest of us, Main Street," says our guest Gretchen Morgenson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning business reporter who has written extensively on how the U.S. government has failed to prosecute any of the top figures who played a role in the economic crash. Morgenson and Joshua Rosner are co-authors of the new book, "Reckless Endangerment: How Outsized Ambition, Greed, And Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon."
