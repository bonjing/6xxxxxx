thank you very much..copy is good..im not an expert but Video is 9 and audio is 9..very good copy..thanks again. We'll seed as long as i can.."
,jahnee,2011-06-03T15:41Z,is this a shitty movie? for the low IQ audience? should i waste my time watching? 
,jb59,2011-06-03T18:38Z,"bro upload fast 5 soon....
thanks in advance"
,blusniffer,2011-06-04T03:59Z,"@ninjaman00420 yeah it doesn't play on ps3 due to the cinavia protection. It's an audio watermark that normally just cuts off the movie audio making it unwatchable but the cinavia stops the whole movie playback with priest.
By end of 2011 all BD players will have cinavia copyright in them so the geeks will have to get their finger out and try to get past it.lol

But it's almost perfect/unbreakable!"
,ridedawave21,2011-06-04T04:23Z,"hey this is perfect can u get paul, your highness, sucker punch , or source code dvd copy??? i know probably not but  fast five thor lol

,morel142,2011-06-07T17:50Z,"Oh they'll figure a way around the whole copy protection watermark thing..


 Anything you can get onto your PC can be altered enough that the hardwired copy protection can't ID..  Just give um time.. lol"

Thanks a lot extremezone :)"
[V],.BONE.,2011-06-13T14:59Z,@tester4u its not cam
,Woogy,2011-06-17T03:38Z,"@: those giving this 10's. Really? You all thought the quality was that great ? score of 10s would suggest it couldn't be any better quality wise.
For me it was grainy/pixilated and washed out with sub par sound

A= 6
V=7
M=3

Its watchable enough quality and I don't think watching a better quality rip could improve the movie enough to make a difference. 

"
,SoundBarber,2011-06-21T23:49Z,"PS3 & CINAVIA work around:

è¶³audio will be 2 ch. Stereo ONLY. (surround not available)

1. Go to Sound Settings
2. Audio Settings
3. Select Optical Digital
4. Check all Boxes*
5. Save settings
6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

*All you may need is the top 3 boxes checked. "
,woo10jw,2011-06-26T01:04Z,"I'm new to pirate bay. Downloaded this video (4 files:1-.png, 1-.nfo, 1-sample .avi, 1-1.4gb .avi)  and all I got was black screen, no video, audio-yes.  Using Ubuntu 10.10 and opened with VLC player. Used Handbrake to convert file to .mp4, got the same thing no video just audio. Can anyone tell me what I'm not doing right."
,woo10jw,2011-06-26T04:29Z,"UPDATE:
The file did play in 10% screen size, anything above, the screen went black NO VIDEO, switch back to small screen video appeared. Tried the file in VLC windows 7, worked fine. Rebooted went back to Ubuntu 10.10, the file opened and worked fine. Excellant video & audio
I think the Bermuda Triangle move to central USA temporarily "
