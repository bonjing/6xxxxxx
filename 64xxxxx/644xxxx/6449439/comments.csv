Liam Neeson does it again with an excellent performance.  Plot is strong and thrilling.  If you enjoyed Taken, you will enjoy this.

As for the issue about muxed video, I have used this codec for years problem free.  www.cccp-project.net. "

,KEN-EL6,2012-02-20T06:23Z,Thanks a million for your AWESOME uploads! it's very much appreciated. Great quality!! My only concern is why some of the movies like this one and Moneyball play at 1.5x speed when on my PS3? Is there a reason for this and is there a fix? Please help. Thanks again.
