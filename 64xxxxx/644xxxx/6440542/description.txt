In Mojo, Charles Waring described it as a mighty impressive first album and claimed she combines strong vocal melodies with infectious hook lines and delivers them with a soulful fervour. He also compared her with Carole King, Laura Nyro and Phoebe Snow, while acknowledging there are elements of gospel, doo wop, Americana and Motown. Birch has got a great voice and the depth of feeling she injects into her performances imbues her songs with a genuine soulfulness. Solidly consistent, the set is packed with memorable moments, including Fools, Nothing But A Miracle and Mirror Mirror.
