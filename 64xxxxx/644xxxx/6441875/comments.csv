,CLewis9800,2011-06-28T20:35Z,Make sure you close All browsers and the taskbar icon! it worked for me. Many thanks Anacondaz for sharing the program.

Even with all the browsers closed, the task bar icon closed, you keep having some functionalities closed, with a warning about expired trial, just the same as if there was no crack. The only thing I'm still checking, id if the 10 login limit was overcome. "
