Bachelor Girl was an Australian pop band, formed in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in 1992 consisting of singer Tania Doko and writer/instrumentalist James Roche. Their debut single, "Buses and Trains", was an international hit, but subsequent releases only impacted Australian charts.

The band split in 2003 after the release of their second album. A third album had been recorded, but was not released. 4 tracks from that abandoned project were released in 2011 on the compilation album Loved & Lost: The Best Of Bachelor Girl. Tania Doko stated in interviews that the band didn't feel there was enough material from their two albums to fill a greatest hits album, and decided to use cuts from the previously unreleased third album.
