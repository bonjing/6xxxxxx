The cams are descent but the color just robs you of the whole movie exp. from the scene where Chow is asleep and the monkey is licking his sack you can't see what the monkey is doing' or why its so funny' when Stu wakes up with the tattoo you can't really make out the awersomness of the tattoo' when their at the strip club and the tranny turns around you can't see why they all about puke' you can imagine but can't make anything out' when all the guys walk into Alan's room you can barley make out all the cool stuff on his walls you can barley make out his insane collection of wwf toys ' the list goes on' most of the BS hollywood puts out is garbage this movie is GOLD' Funniest movie i've seen all year'

Stop trying to be all internet macho, nobody gives a rats behind if you can talk tough on the net and lip people.

It's not in the wrong section.

I guess most of you who are moaning are thinking about the Hi Res section, now if it was there that would be a problem.
Ok so the quality is crap, shit in...shit out, but didn't TS2DVD give that away??? Any avi file converted to DVD fomat will be bloated, get over it.
Oh and Ozzytron, DVD stands for Digital Versatile Disc not Digital Video Disc.
