When Irene takes a position at a hotel deep in the woods of the Austrian Alps, she soon discovers the girl she replaced vanished without a trace. Is there a murderer on site, or are there even darker forces at work? Jessica Hausner's follow up to the critically acclaimed 'Lovely Rita' draws the audience into a disturbing journey through mystery and anguish, empowered by a very personal vision of terror. (Artificial Eye)
