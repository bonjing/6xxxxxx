CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Presents 15th Priest R5 lololol

Sources:
Video: Russian DVD-5

Audio: Line from EP1C
thx for Syncing, its spot on!

Encode:

Video:
Well still was a lot of work to do, R5 Video was very nice, just the typical darker scenes are dark, all daylight scenes are very good.
I had to cut the movie again in parts and do light and dark scenes differently to gain best possible Viewing-Experience.
Added sharpness,rgb,denoise and brightness only when needed

here a live comparison between DVD and my Version

Audio:
Wanted to use EP1C Audio directly but i wasnt satisfied. Something sounds a bit strange. I hear Voice only from the left speaker and all the effects on the right speaker. Also slightly hiss and noise troughout, and on 4 scenes i can hear russian voice at the same time as english. Looks like the rears have echo of voice in that scenes.
So i had to make my own audio out of that.
I cleaned the hiss and noise and fixed the voice and removed that russian echo voice from the rears, and made my own 5.1 audio.
Now everything is coming out of the speakers where it should be.
Overall a perfect release now.

Like always my Audio will fit on any direct DVD-Encode.

Also added cover and label at the bottom since i read its appreciated.
enjoy

PRIEST, a post-apocalyptic sci-fi thriller, is set in an alternate world -- one ravaged by centuries of war between man and vampires. The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.
