Are you fucking kidding me? Little kid, you shouldn't be on TPB because you're too damn young. 

Seriously, what is ""awful"" about this movie? This was probably the best action/horror movie that I've seen in a very long time. Rare good movies such as this don't come out often. 

Is that all you can say? Terrible script? Lol. You try writing a fucking script and we can all criticize you. Asshole. 

Excellent movie. 9/10

Haven't DL'ed the actual file yet... just found this asshole's comment pretty annoying."
