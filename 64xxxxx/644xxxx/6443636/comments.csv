@ IDLU

PS3 & CINAVIA work around:

è¶³audio will be 2 ch. Stereo ONLY. (surround not available)

1. Go to Sound Settings
2. Audio Settings
3. Select Optical Digital
4. Check all Boxes*
5. Save settings
6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

*All you may need is the top 3 boxes checked.

TVTeam can't do everything (tho they come close! )"
