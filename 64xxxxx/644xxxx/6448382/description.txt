Twenty 4 Seven was founded in 1989, when Dutch producer Ruud van Rijen hired rappers Tony Dawson-Harrison, Hanks & Jacks, and MC Fixxit to front a new dance project. To set Twenty 4 Seven apart from other similar groups, van Rijen decided to hire female singer Nancy Coolen. The combination of traditional rapping with female choruses proved to be a success, with their first single, "I Can't Stand It!" reaching #7 in the UK Singles Chart in 1990.[1] The next single, "Are You Dreaming", did similarly well, reaching #17 in the United Kingdom.[1] In mid-1990, Street Moves, the project's debut album, was released.

By 1990, rappers MC Fixx it and Hanks & Janks had stopped contributing to the group altogether, and by 1991, Dawson-Harrison left the group after a dispute with van Rijen to front Captain Hollywood Project, his already successful solo project. After Dawson-Harrison's departure, Twenty 4 Seven remained dormant for several years.


In 1993, Twenty 4 Seven returned with "Slave to the Music", which charted impressively throughout Europe. The band quickly followed with "Is It Love", "Leave Them Alone", and "Take Me Away", the latter charting at #5 in Israel. In late 1993, Is It Love, a full length studio album, was released worldwide, and was accompanied by a worldwide tour with stops in Europe, Australia, and Africa.
