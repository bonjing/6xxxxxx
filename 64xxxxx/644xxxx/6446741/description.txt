by Ken Dryden

Eldar Djangirov, who was already a promising pianist at a very tender age, was
able to immigrate along with his parents to the United States in order to better
develop his amazing talent. After he appeared on the nationally syndicated radio
program Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz at the age of 12, he was already
displaying formidable chops for one so young. After two earlier releases for the
small D&D label, he recorded his major label debut in early 2004 for Sony
Classical. Already able to play at furious tempos normally associated with
greats like Oscar Peterson and the late Art Tatum, especially in the stunning
opening rendition of "Sweet Georgia Brown," he sometimes has trouble restraining
his ability to show off his technique, nearly overwhelming Bobby Timmons'
soulful "Moanin'" at times. Better are his reserved but refreshing approach to
"Nature Boy" and the superb original ballad, "Lady Wicks." Bassist John
Patitucci and drummer Todd Strait provide excellent support for the young man on
the trio tracks (especially in the introspective take of "'Round
Midnight"). Tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker is added on the Latin-tinged
original "Point of View." Like all players who demonstrate tremendous technique
at a young age, critics will be watching Eldar Djangirov with great interest to
see if he successfully builds upon his amazing gifts.
