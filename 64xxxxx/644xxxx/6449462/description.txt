Hi,

Thanks to the web, now is probably the first time a human can travel through all available music world wide. In principle I do not totally agree with the used methods but I simply could not resist the opportunity and built a MP3 Pop (plus) Database for my granddaughter called \"The day before you came\". So I\"m a freeloader.... and its time to do something back.

While collecting I came across a new wave in music called Indie (from independent). The technique has grown up and large machinery (and companies) to organize the pop-business is no longer needed. This had and will have some impact, for instance in location (studio to home) and sound (studio - privately used equipment). That means more time to concentrate on the music and more time to concentrate on the words. Like it was when Pop (world) Music started to make an impact.

Unavoidable I came across some tracks that are simply too much for my ears only. 101 of them are gathered in a kind of Personal Top 100+1.

The collection is called \"Play in Reverse\" because this song from Lex Land sais everything I want to say about this new sound. This song has become my new \"Yesterday\".

The beautiful lady at the front, I found on the internet. She shows what I see. I\"m 99% sure she personally does not have any problems being associated with the music. If she does I\"ll change it.

Enjoy,
