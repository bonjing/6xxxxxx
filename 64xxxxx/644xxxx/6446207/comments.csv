Thx for the release"
,Pookie67,2011-06-08T05:42Z,"Not true here. Blocking internet access and clicking the ""Activate"" button only produces an ""ERROR 4 - WINSOCK CANNOT CONNECT TO SERVER"" error. That, and all previous 17.00 versions had an ""Offline Activation"" button in this Activation window that would produce the two ""User Codes"" and generate the two ""Activation"" codes. Simply blocking the internet doesn't seem to force this offline process in my case, and i'm trying it on two different computers. "

,jamaroney,2011-06-11T16:13Z,"Correction. Since the file didn't work in Windows 7 64-bit, I assumed the virus indication was authentic - it wasn't (a common thing with keygen files). The problem is that the Keygen worked only when I ran it under a virtual 32-bit PC. Then all was OK. 

Pookie, what worked for me was to go my network connection in Control Panel, right-click and choose ""disable"" (do this before starting UltraEdit.)"
