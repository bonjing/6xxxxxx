,AMoveFan,2011-06-12T06:18Z,I haven't watched a blue ray dvd itself in a blue ray dvd player for a while but just out of curiousty I have a full hd tv 1080 p and it does 240 hrz but my question is in real dark scenes every now and again there are like dark spots Im guessing maybe those are pixles ? but I see those every now and then would you see that if you were watching the actual blue ray dvd in a blue ray dvd player or is it because I uploaded it it's uploaded really nice but like I said just in the dark scenes is where I notice it so is it normal that i'm seeing this ? not on 1080 p uploads mostly 720 and Thanks for for the upload .
