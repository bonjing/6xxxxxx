,XPditif,2011-06-21T00:02Z,"I don't think I will, or if so, it will be in a long time: I'm currently seeding Gintama and I haven't the cash for another harddrive (mine are full). A guy already ul a 360p season 1 mkv torrent if you want. Plus I'm just a repacker, if want it that bad, you might find what you want on filestube. Good luck. ;)"
,cktonline,2011-06-27T19:48Z,Even I am almost out of Hard drive space & also my download speed is just 512 kbps so it will take a lot of time if i'll download a 720p version. Anyways thanks for this one.
,Kikee_31,2011-06-29T09:26Z,"thanks so much XPditif!!=) really appreciate the UL.  Im only DLing ep 1-8, already have the rest.  im getting pretty decent dl speed too, 5-600kB/s. usual max 4 me is 800kB/s so this is better than what i expected for the seeds. I'll b back with A/V stats 4 any future DLers, (get the feeling that ur top quality though). Thanks again!"
