The tracks "Glasgow Kiss" and "Damage Control" have been played during the G3 tour, and are featured as openers to the 2005 DVD and live album, G3: Live in Tokyo. For unknown reasons, "Curve" is split into two separate tracks on some releases of the album, with the majority of the song on track six and the latter portion on track seven. On these editions, "Lost Without You" and "Animate-Inanimate" form tracks eight and nine respectively. The correct track listing, without the aforementioned anomalies, is shown below.
