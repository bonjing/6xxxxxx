MarilynManson has posted a video teaser of his band's upcoming new material.

A 26-second clip, believed to be from the follow-up to 2009's The High End Of Low, was posted on the group's official website.

The video has the title "I am among no one (excerpt from an undisclosed song with an unreleased title)".

The frontman also posted a message on the redesigned site with the heading "Rapeture". "Christianity. Manufactures. Yesterdays. Killers," it stated. "Brave Now World. Don't ever believe what you read, especially if you are illiterate."

It concluded: "We do not walk among them. I am among no one."

Earlier this year, drummer Ginger Fish quit Marilyn Manson "to see where my life, and the knowledge of my availability, cares to take me". 

Manson signed to UK-based indie Cooking Vinyl last November and will reportedly release material on his own Hell Etc. imprint.
