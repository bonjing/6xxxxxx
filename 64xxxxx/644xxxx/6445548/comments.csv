  but i do get your point ..you feel left out of the picture.. so maybe you should get a ticket and see the world and realize that you are only a very very very small piece of it and NO you did make the USA, you just sit and point your lazy finger at it and blame it for your lack of courage!

Even in a Democracy, individuals can't do a whole lot about things if the government doesn't want them to be able to.

All I mean to convey is that not all Americans are like what the world thinks we are.  We have smart, dumb, mean, nice, brave and pussy people, just like anywhere else.  Just because our government does things that we don't necessarily agree with doesn't mean all Americans are douche bags."

---------------------------

That's a gross and frankly stupid generalization of the American colonials.  Puritans were merely one group of people, and not even a particularly large one.

But because you have little actual education of the history aside from what you've picked up on hearsay in random pop culture media, you apparently think everyone who went to the colonies were Puritans.

Well, that's ignorant and completely wrong.  Washington, Adams, Franklin, Jefferson, Hancock, Rutledge... the list goes on... I can't think of even a single man who signed the Constitution who was a Puritan.
