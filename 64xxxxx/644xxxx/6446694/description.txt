POtHS - Gospel Music - 13 - Hillsong Chapel - Yahweh - DivX

New from Hillsong Church, Hillsong Chapel is a series of intimate and devotional arrangements of popular songs led by Hillsong UNITED and Hillsong LIVE worship leaders. Recorded live in the churchâ€™s chapel, Yahweh, the first installment in the series, contains organic and contemplative versions of such top Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) songs as â€œHosanna,â€ â€œFrom The Inside Outâ€ and the No. 1 CCLI song sung by an estimated 40 million people every week in church services around the world, â€œMighty To Save.â€  Thirteen songs in all, including the title track â€œYahweh,â€ the project draws from a catalog of albums that have sold over 11 million copies.

Although having never recorded an â€œunpluggedâ€ version of their songs, Ben Fielding, Annie Garratt, Jad Gillies, Joel Houston, Jill McCloghry, Reuben Morgan and other Hillsong team members crafted the brand new arrangements in response to churches around the world asking for acoustic versions of their popular anthems.

â€œIt is our role as worship leaders and musicians to help create the most inspiring and inviting atmosphere for worship within our churches,â€ says Ben Fielding. â€œ I like how our senior pastor, Bobbie [Houston], describes this as â€˜setting the table.â€™ A full 10-piece band in a room with 30 people is likely to be setting the wrong table... and while most of us would see the error in that scenario, the reality is that we are all faced with re-thinking how we arrange our songs and how we can better musically approach our church environment.

â€œEarlier this year, we gathered in our Chapel, a small and much-loved glass and sandstone building on the back of our church property, for a night of worshipâ€¦ To hear some of my favorite songs, â€˜unpackedâ€™ and played in a way that  made sense in that context and to hear the voices of the church drown out the band, was something I'll never forget. This night was all about encountering and worshipping God, though beyond the night itself, our hope is that this project will help our team and other local church teams approach our times of worship with an even greater sensitivity and creativity.â€

â€œHillsong Chapelâ€™s Yahweh is perfect for smaller gatherings, personal devotions and will help resource churches wanting more intimate worship expressions of songs from Hillsong LIVE and Hillsong UNITED,â€ adds Bryan Ward, EMI CMG Label Group Director, Product Marketing. â€œChurches love the music from Hillsong Church, but are not always able to reproduce it in their local worship settings.  The music from Hillsong Chapel provides another option for these churches to share these inspiring songs of praise.â€

In addition to the new arrangements of theses songs, the Yahweh CD includes all the song chord charts that worship leaders can use to reproduce the music in their local church services.  A companion, full-length DVD featuring all the songs on the CD is also available and was filmed as 300 worshippers filled the Hillsong chapel.

01. Hosanna
02. You'll Come
03. Run
04. The Time Has Come
05. Saviour King
06. Yahweh

JESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.

Born of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.

RAPtURE (My transportation outta here).

The Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)

In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...

"And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.

"Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)

This is what is coming and more. If you do not believe in The Rapture and Jesus, you will need to Study The Below Survival videos.
