[T],insinuendo,2011-06-03T02:06Z,"3D is ok

34D-3D=Better"
,BlueOpal,2011-06-21T20:03Z,"How do I get this to work on a computer? VLC, Windows mediaplayer, Cyberlink PowerDVD 11 and Stereoscopic Player didn't want to start it. Tried it by adding it to daemon tools but no luck. Any program that can open it?"
[T],insinuendo,2011-06-26T14:33Z,"You can extract with Power ISO

,yellowFellow89,2011-09-07T21:16Z,"This is a iso file, just so you guys know. Cant get it to work because i dont know how to. Why didnt you just make it easy, with left and right picture and an easy file to play? This shit is really shit."
,yellowFellow89,2011-09-10T01:26Z,"Ahh. got it too work! tried in daemon tools at first, but that didnt do it! But Power iso did! "
,mangyan,2011-09-15T15:45Z,"Thanks for the up. I got one question though, do I need to burn all these files into bluray disc in order to work on 3d TV?"
,bdfseed,2011-09-17T22:52Z,"To The People Who Donât Know What An ISO Is. It is a dick image. burn it to a disc, mount it or extract it. is that to hard for you to do.

@yellowFellow89 YOU ARE FUCKING RETARDED, ITS AN ISO TO MAKE IT EASYER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT N00BS LIKE YOURSELF. "
,fortpb,2011-09-18T03:43Z,its not side by side by any chance is it?
,juanpcm,2011-09-18T09:33Z,"Its just a regular video, its not side by side... I cant make it work in 3D, what am I doin wrong?? Great quality tho! Still, I only downloaded cuz it said it was in 3D... Any help plz?  thanks!"
,yellowFellow89,2011-09-25T00:28Z,"I do know what an Iso file is and i am not a retard. You try with daemon tools and i am sure you will write the same. "" i cant get it to work"" Because i tried allot and played with the settings for some time. And if you are so smart and computer wise please tell me how to get the 3d to work on my tv. 
Btw. You got some serious anger management to fix. Its amazing how angry and upset some people can be just over 1 comment from a noob as me haha! Think you need to get out and a new world will be available for you, you will probably be pissed on with that attitude. If that is really who you are? Or maybe you are just a little kid with a big mouth using capslock and using strong words as fucking. -_-* That is cool and so badboy.
well well, back to the torrent discussion.
I do not believe ISO is the best file for noobs like myself. I find the side by side AVI. files much easier to use. Just plug the drive in my tv and play it right from there. 
But i do need to thanks the uploader because there are not many 3d uploaders yet and we need all of them. 
Only problem is, this is not easy and i have not found a way to play this in 3d with sound. After searching the net i downloaded the nvidia 3d player. This do work but i got some sound issues. Guess i will figured it out sooner or later. I just got a bluray burner last month so i will try to burn this and play it in my 3d bluray player. Fingers crossed! I want some bikini babes in 3d! Just gotta watch out for my girlfriend not storming the mancave when i play this!"
,arrrrgggg,2011-09-28T17:57Z,"Thank you for the post!

ps: Dear S-3D fans! Can you answer to my survey for my master thesis at

,jonmobrien,2011-10-07T18:37Z,"So, it has been over 4 months since this was first uploaded, with some thousands of completed leeches, yet not one single person has come back to verify that this torrent actually does contain 3D content. I've downloaded it and my media player plays the BluRay ISO file flawlessly, in vivid bright rich 2D. It is a beautiful 2D film, so thanks to insinuendo for that. But is there 3D content? If this ISO is burnt to a BD disk, will a 3D-BD player produce 3D content where a media player doesn't? Not one person has apparantly tried it and reported back. bdfseed claims the iso format is for non-noobs, but fails to give any guidance on how to convert into into a 3D-playab;e format. Given that (a) not many people have BD burners - noobs or not-noobs, the only way I can see to watch this download on 3D TVs is to (i) use software to mount the ISO image accessing the VOB files; (ii) use software to extract from the VOB files a left.mkv file and a right.mkv file, and finally (iii) use software to merge the two 1920x1080 left and 1920x1080 right files into one half-sbs 1920x1080 mkv file. All up, assuming you already have all the software, know how to use it all, don't make any mistakes on any of the settings, have a fast modern computer, it will take about 20-30 hours of CPU processing to get a 3D-watchable file. Truly for non-noobs! But seriously what a waste. Just seed a half-sbs file in the first place so everyone - noob and non-noob alike - can watch it straight away without days of transcoding. (b) Even if you have a BD burner - who wants to burn a BD disk needlessly anyway??? Before DivX chips were included in DVD players we had to spend hours transcoding avi files to TS_Video DVD+RW discs to watch our TV shows. Then they put DivX into DVD players and now we only had to simply burn avi files to data CDs or data DVDs - fairly simple by comparison. Then they added USB slots to players, and even to TVs, and then released networkable media players so we never had to burn a disc again. We could just watch our DivX avi files copied onto USB sticks, or later simply through a SAMBA network share! With that and mp3 players and smartphones, I've never needed to burn a disc again! And I've never looked back. If someone got the latest movie DVD and seeded an iso image of that DVD they'd be laughed off the Pirate Ship. If someone got the latest music album can you imagine if they seeded a CD ISO??? There are 60 other 3D seeds here, that is 60 other seeds that can just be downloaded and watched straight away on our 3D TVs. And then there is this one."

The most interesting thing tho is - given that the original BD disc is a 25GB disc, just what is this 11.66GB ISO an image of? Was the left and right extracted and this is an image of one of the perspectives? It does seem to be a high quality 1920x1080 2D video."
,skys2011,2011-11-07T21:01Z,I use Elecard AVC HD Suite to watch it after I mount the ISO with magicdisc(free). Used DVDFab to convert it to MKV format to watch using Nvidia video player or other 3D players
,JMit,2011-11-24T01:57Z,It works with PowerDvd 11 but It plays so choppy I cant watch... its like 0.5 fps
,xx.Morph.xx,2011-11-27T13:38Z,"Cheers for the upload, Burnt to BuRay with Cyberlink Hi-Def suite, loaded into my old Fat 60Gig PS3 & sent to LG 3D TV via HDMI 1.3 & Voila swimsuits in 3D ;-). 
Only skimmed through a couple of scenes & it's not the best 3D camera work (probably post production IMHO) but as the OP says Girls Swimsuits 3D....."
,luispic,2011-12-28T15:15Z,Anyone knows if there's a chance to use a media player like WDLive to watch this .iso in 3D? or is it only for PS3 and/or BlueRay disc Players? thanks!
,OmniusPrime,2012-01-07T16:33Z,"@morph: I burned to a BD-RE, put it into the same model PS3 as you have, tried playing it on my Samsung D7000 series - I get the warning box that it requires a 3D player/TV, and it won't play in 3D. Is there some setting on the PS3 that you  had to change? BTW, I can play other 3D files DLed from here, as well as both SBS and over/under from my DVR (though the O/U is a bit choppy). I don't have any commercial 3D discs to experiment with yet."
