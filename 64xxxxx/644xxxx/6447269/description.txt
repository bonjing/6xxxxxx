Synopsis.........: In 1994 Oregon became the first state to legalize physician-assisted 
		   suicide. At the time, only Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands 
		   had legalized the practice. 'How to Die in Oregon' tell the stories 
		   of those most intimately involved with the practice today -- 
		   terminally ill Oregonians, their families, doctors, and friends -- 
		   as well as the passage of an assisted suicide law in Washington State.
