,senseinai,2011-06-02T01:53Z,It immediately asks for the english data disc ... so how can this be used?
,Guinnnevere,2011-06-02T03:04Z,The English data disk is with the 2.0.1 version of this app: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5964255/Nuance_Dragon_Dictate_2.0___2.0.1___English_Data_Disc_Mac_OSX_By
,tuvokk,2011-06-02T05:28Z,"Thanks, polisdavid, you always upload great stuff!!!

There seems to be no International version of Dragon Dictate as an upgrade to MacSpeech International. But there are non-English versions of Dragon Dictate, such as Dragon Dictate in German, it would be really nice if someone could upload them."
,Redgrass,2011-06-02T16:57Z,ver 2.5 is in beta and has significant improvements - recommend wait for 2.5.  Otherwise very useful upload > thanks

,bacon546,2011-08-22T04:00Z,"I've installed the update and now it only asks me for the license key. What should I do, reinstall?"
,9s,2011-10-05T20:47Z,"Thanks for this!!  Receive ""404 - Not Found"" when clicking on link for Data Disk, however.  Is it still available?"
,drumrobot,2011-10-12T04:10Z,Does anyone have a license key file to use when upgrading to 2.5 (which seems to be a lot better)?
,lbcamera,2011-10-26T22:28Z,"Would you by any chance have an english version for PC?

Thanks"

,supsee,2012-04-28T23:55Z,"Thanks. This has to be one of the most incredible pieces of software I have ever used. Even though I don't have one of the pre-defined accents so the accuracy is not 100%, being able to command my Mac without my keyboard/trackpad is amazing."
,Ziza,2012-05-28T11:25Z,Any chance you could crack v2.5.2? 2.5.1 and earlier hog CPU and crash repeatedly with Lion. Thanks.
