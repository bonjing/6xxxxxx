you should know that the game has MODS(modifications) which totally alter the skills for all the classes.

The best MOD for Diablo II is undoubtedly Median XL MOD developed by Brother Laz. 

To install this mod first download it directly from the official site: 
http://modsbylaz.hugelaser.com/download.html

To install this mod first make a copy of the Make a backup copy of the patch_d2.mpq file located in the Diablo II folder and replace it with
the patch_d2.mpq file found in the mod. 

Alternatively you can just rename the original  patch_d2.mpq to patch_d2ORG.mpq, and then copy paste the mod's  patch_d2.mpq.

To uninstall the mod just replace the  patch_d2.mpq with the original // or just delete the patch_d2.mpg and rename the patch_d2ORG.mpq back to its original filename:
patch_d2ORG.mpq.
