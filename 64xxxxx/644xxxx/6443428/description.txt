    HTML5 Web Forms in Depth

    Author: Joe Marini



    In HTML5: Web Forms in Depth, author Joe Marini details the

    latest enhancements for client-side forms found in HTML5. Using

    real-world examples, the course showcases the capabilities of

    the specification's new attributes and form elements, such as

    displaying default placeholder text, setting required fields,

    capturing email addresses, and presenting calculation results

    within a form. The course also demonstrates mobile device

    support for HTML5 forms and shows how to modernize existing

    forms while maintaining backwards compatibility for older

    browsers. Exercise files accompany the course.

    * Autofilling previously entered data with autocomplete
