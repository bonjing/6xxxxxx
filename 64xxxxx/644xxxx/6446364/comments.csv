,cudds,2011-07-07T06:05Z,sorry but there is a trojan attached to this program ..... you need to check your programs before you add them 
,norttikasa,2011-07-30T13:46Z,"cudds !!!

There's trojan in ur pants. Almost every virus program detect crack etc as a trojan, that everybody  does not  loading PIRATE products.
So dont worry, there is no virus..."
,balboa1976,2011-09-21T22:13Z,"Hello misterbig009,

Can you please tell me if I would need permission from you to download this torrent?  Each time I attempt to, it tells me connection was refused.

Thank You Very Much"
,Seed_Demon,2012-01-18T06:54Z,"@Bailboa1976 - If you are getting a refused connection error it is most likely you are trying at an unusually high traffic period, simply keep trying or try again later on if you haven't gotten this yet.

That error is not permissions related but instead, most often is the SQL server having too many connections open at one time (which could also be your own connection taking too long to connect and keeping the connection open longer than allowed) for which most servers will respond by refusing additional queries...since this is a PHP based site using MySQL databases, this is a normal response to a hung connection or too busy at one time. hope this clears things up for you!
