Synopsis.........: Over the course of a ten year revolution in Nepalnearly 40% of the 
		   guerillas who joined the rebel army were women.  WOMAN REBEL follows 
		   the story of one such woman, Uma Bhujel (army codename Silu) from 
		   the jungles of revolution all the way through to the halls of 
		   Parliament. Having been propelled to join by witnessing gender 
		   inequality in her childhood, Silu fought on the opposite side of the 
		   war against her brother.  However, it is ultimately peaceful protest 
		   by Silu and her party that bring about the upheaval of government 
		   that they seek. Set against the backdrop of Nepals tumultuous 
		   history over the past 10 years; WOMAN REBEL promises to be a unique 
		   and personal portrait journeying from revolution to peace.
