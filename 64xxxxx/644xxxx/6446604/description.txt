On The First Days of Spring, Charlie Fink mourned the absence of ex-girlfriend/ex-bandmate Laura Marling while the rest of Noah & the Whale churned up a sympathetic mix of folk and sad-eyed indie rock. Released two years later, Last Night on Earth finds the band recharged and redirected. â€œHe used to be somebody, now heâ€™s someone elseâ€¦ and it feels like heaven,â€ Fink sings on the opening track, a tribute to transformation that doubles as the albumâ€™s mission statement. Although released during the golden days of Englandâ€™s indie folk scene, Last Night on Earth reaches far beyond the genre, relying heavily on keyboards and leaving the acoustic riffage to Mumford & Sons. Some of the basslines are synthesized instead of plucked, and some of the percussion is programmed instead of played. At times, the band appears single-minded in its determination to turn over a new rock, and the album suffers whenever Last Night on Earth focuses on presentation -- the polished production, the overdubbed handclaps -- instead of content. But those moments are few and far between. Noah & the Whale sound genuinely happy to be exploring a new direction, and tracks like â€œTonightâ€™s the Kind of Nightâ€ fuse the Arcade Fireâ€™s chest-swelling anthems with smart, radio-ready sensibilities. On â€œWild Thing,â€ Fink proves he can still wring some serious mileage out of melancholy, too, delivering a Matt Berninger-like vocal over synths and lonely guitar lines.
