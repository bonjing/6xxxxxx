,Andy-RoOo,2011-10-11T05:42Z,Can anyone tell me how to switch between audios? I just can't bare the easy-going original music : (

,ironymon,2012-01-17T13:24Z,Give this man a skull.
,xXforiamdeathXx,2012-02-23T05:35Z,Is this in English dubs??
,BrokenStatue,2012-04-12T07:20Z,"Ok, I'm a little confused. Is this the funimation remastered? Or is it from the original Japanese video with English dub?"
,jonranssj,2012-05-07T00:37Z,"This is a good torrent, however it is worth noting that the audio is MONO. The torrent description states that it is STEREO. It is not. However, you you still get 3 types of audio, which includes the original Japanese dub and BGM."
