BOOK INFO:

THE FIRST BOOK WITH ONE FOOT ON THE COFFEE TABLE, AND ONE FOOT IN THE
CLASSROOM
Joe McNally, one of the worldâ€™s top pro digital photographers, whose celebrated work has graced the pages of Sports Illustrated, Time, and National Geographic (to name a few), breaks new ground by doing something no photography book has ever doneâ€”blending the rich, stunning images and elegant layout of a coffee-table book with the invaluable training, no-nonsense insights, and photography secrets usually found only in those rare, best-of-breed educational books.

When Joeâ€™s not on assignment for the biggest-name magazines and Fortune 500 clients, heâ€™s in the classroom teaching location lighting, environmental portraiture, and how to â€œget the shotâ€ at workshops around the world. These on-location workshops are usually reserved for a handful of photographers each year, but now you can learn the same techniques that Joe shares in his seminars and lectures in a book that brings Joeâ€™s sessions to life.

What makes the book so unique is the â€œtriangle of learningâ€ where (1) Joe distills the concept down to one brief sentence. It usually starts with something like, â€œAn editor at National Geographic once told meâ€¦â€ and then he shares one of those hard-earned tricks of the trade that you only get from spending a lifetime behind the lens. Then, (2) on the facing page is one of Joeâ€™s brilliant images that perfectly illustrates the technique (youâ€™ll recognize many of his photos from magazine covers). And (3) you get the inside story of how that shot was taken, including which equipment he used (lens, f/stop, lighting, accessories, etc.), along with the challenges that type of project brings, and how to set up a shot like that of your own.

This book also gives you something more. It inspires. It challenges. It informs. But perhaps most importantly, it will help you understand photography and the art of making great photos at a level you never thought possible. This book is packed with those â€œAh ha!â€ momentsâ€”those clever insights that make it all come together for you. It brings you that wonderful moment when it suddenly all makes senseâ€”that â€œmoment it clicks.â€
