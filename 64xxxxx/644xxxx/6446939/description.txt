BOOK INFO:

Intended for wire-bonding and flip-chip packaging professionals and for scientists and engineers working in the field of mechanical microsensors, this practical monograph introduces novel measurement technologies that allow for in situ and real-time examination of physical processes during the packaging process or during subsequent reliability tests. The measurement system presented here makes possible measurements at formerly inaccessible packaging interconnects. For the first time it becomes possible to describe the wire-bonding process window in terms of the physical forces at the contact zone instead of the applied machine settings. This is significant for a deeper understanding and future development of these packaging processes. Applications of the sensor in the field of wire bonding and flip-chip characterization are also illustrated. The reader will gain much insight into the important field of interconnection technology in semiconductor packaging.
