,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-02T15:46Z,"RE: Franklin & Bash
Agree it was pretty corny and cheesy.  

Hawthorne series is much better, though it generally has too much soap opera-like tension to make it truly enjoyable.  Will probably avoid as well."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T15:46Z,"Thanks.

@tylr: Both MC and Breach are new encodes - one day ""old"".

@spritualiste: Unbelievable! I deleted it from server - last night  I hit ratio 100 and decided that Hit&Runs fucked that one too long enough."

[V],DownTYU,2011-06-02T17:45Z,"@twentyforty

I've been thinking of caching twenty forty encodes and provide direct download links when needed.

Thus problems can be avoided.
What say?"
,snair1591,2011-06-02T17:47Z,"thanks alot for Breach,Michael Clayton and Too big to fail.cheers. :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T18:05Z,"@jamydoug: LOL no! It would be one step smaller - 576p, OK. You've seen how many heat I took because of BL, but some BluRays are simply visually so badly produced (contrary to opinions of newcomers) that bigger format can give nothing in return - just take your money (trough traffic you would pay one way or another).
Guys who have downloaded B a r r y L 8 GB and my 1 GB encode in all fairness must admit that mine is not 800% uglier (that would be utter rubbish to claim).
Also - doing some title upon request does imply few thing and let put it nicely, because I am sick of arguing, you not have been quite up to the task and responsibility.

Don't get me wrong - but I always put my opinions on first place and decide what and how would I do something.

352p is NOT bad or ugly choice - but it is simply a format that doesn't suits   your playback system.

You can get nice start in text above, use Google and go from there.

Saying ""please, do not make 352p"" sounds wrong and act like kick in the balls of guys who need two days for download of single 352p. 

I repeat - you don't like it - but you can afford bigger one. Most people can't - and are ready to take small trade-of in quality (especially on 15-17"" CRT display) and you should have some empathy for them."
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-02T18:23Z,"@twentyforty

First of all, just received Glory & red riding hood trilogy...
Awesome quality thanks...

Second, there is not much difference between any encodes as long as quality is constant and enough bitrate
The only difference between 352p and 720p
is 352p is smooth and 720p is sharp.
But if said that the bluray sucks then it is not necessary to have it in 720p.

Withnail and I is a 108 min film,
Now the ball is in twentyforty's court...
Whether he could make an exception and make a low sized 720p rip...as the source is not well off it won't matter."
,DMVIN,2011-06-02T18:44Z,thanks for too big to fail
,jamydoug,2011-06-02T19:12Z,"@twentyforty : am absolutely sorry sir!! din mean anything disrepectfully u or anybody!! was just my tht..

anyway thanks again for d movie n req ur forgiveness.. for my harsh words abt quality ...:( "

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T19:23Z,"@DownTYU: Ultimately, it comes down to bytes per pixels. As resizer I use 64-tap spline - better one is not invented and probably wont be - even Avisynth developers still ask around for someone who can explain how it works. Details are not lost - if bytes per pixels value is high enough (they cannot go anywhere, LOL) - but - bigger frame-sizes better correspond with someone's playback system and ultimately - vision of the person who watch.

On less than year old prevalent displays (both TV and comp. monitor) with sizes up to 19 inches, there is no difference between two frame-sizes IF the same value for bytes per pixels is used in encoding.

Situation has changed dramatically last 14 months, when LCD displays achieved massive production and affordable pricing.

Are they better? Good? They are more practical, smaller, consume less power - but better in terms of video quality, even LED backlighted ones? Answer is simple No, not yet. It may hurt people, but that is the truth.

You got 40"" LCD not long ago and I have Toshiba 42"" most expensive LCD money can buy ten feet away (in living room, where I doesn't go at all). As computer displays I run 23.5"" LED LCD from LG and Samsung 17"" CRT and I can switch them through Belkin switch). I MUST have them both, to verify encodes in different ""environments"" and I can say and repeat again - LCD suck balls - it is big, thin, nice looking - but that's it. 

Point being - encodes look better on CRT one, period. All troubles low-bit-rate encodes have, by nature - are exaggerated by technological immaturity of LCD. Banding, pixelazations  in flat areas, et.c..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T20:02Z,"@DownTYU:

""I've been thinking of caching twenty forty encodes and provide direct download links when needed.""

Direct download links are out of the question. Only possibility I even encouraged is to make torrents and use PUBLIC tracker site for uploading.

I wont become BoB or million of so called ""uploaders"" to file-hosting services (Wupload, Filesonic, Fileserve and many many others) because they pay to uploaders 25 - 50 dollars per 1000 downloads.

I could be very very rich man by now - but I would not sell ""my soul to devil"".

Public tracker sites  and torrents are true last standing bastion of  true file sharing.

I see every day on Forums how sheep keep saying ""Thanks for sharing"" to uploaders to RapidShare or wherever... and it makes me sick...
Sharing? No - these guys upload Scene or P2P group's encodes and MAKE money - they provide service, a profitable one. Out there are so called ""uploaders"" who  proudly speak about up to 1700 USD profit per month. Yes, they have expenses - but - they are covered,  at the end.

I ask for respect only. And less harsh approach. I really do best I can, whoever thinks otherwise - can go someplace else and at least, leave me alone with my friends.
I don't need popularity, I ask for respect."
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-02T20:21Z,"@twentyforty

Thats so true.
Any vid worked as a charm in CRTs.
But nowdays its like a trend to buy LCDs. 
Here in my city you will have look through rock to water before you find anyone selling CRT monitors."
