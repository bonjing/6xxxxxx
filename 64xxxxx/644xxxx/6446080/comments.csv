Patch first the program using aimersoft dvd creator 2.5.2.15 patch which is included in the dl. 

before anything else, install the program itself and close it after the installation..
1. unzip aimersoft dvd creator patch
2. patch it and search for aimersoft.exe in the folder where u installed the program..
3. a message in the box will prompt u the patch is done..
4. you can now use the serial provided in the dl..

and its done!


happy Burning and Blessed Be!!"

,Dval29001,2011-08-03T09:05Z,"This is what I get when trying to extract the patch from the .RAR file


patch.rar: Invalid or corrupt authenticity information

Hard to patch something that doesn't even make it out of the rar file. Let alone can even be used while inside of it..."
,hanoii,2011-08-05T05:15Z,"I guess it's safe, isn't it? Anacondaz, can you confim? I saw you uploaded quite a bunch of torrents so I trusted you. My AVG reported a backdor but I saw that changes across other antivirs, so I went ahead and executed anyway. Hope it was safe, I needed this.

It works as expected."
,FamilyMan82,2011-08-23T01:17Z,"Dont try this one. the so called ""patch"" is a Gen 32 Trojan. Better luck next time."
,bhaiyan,2011-09-05T12:28Z,"This is not a Virus first stop your Antivirus (Realtime protection)
1) unzip 
2)install setup
3)use Patch
4)register with keys
5)turn on your antivirus
Enjoy it
Its 100% safe and working i am using it
thanks 'Anacondaz'"
,Maverick_RIDDLE,2011-09-12T08:17Z,i have installed the patch and the serial and e-mail arent working for me.. what now? id really like to have this program.
,dajmidivx,2011-10-06T01:32Z,"This shit works fine until 82% of encoding, and then crash everytime. I tried installing it in C and in D partition and no luck. Using windows 7 64 bit. I tried encoding about 5-6 times and it always crashed on 82% It seems that it have some pirate protection by that way. Has anyone here actually made some DVD .iso or DVD with this??"
,kas722,2011-12-16T06:33Z,Can someone tell me how to patch please?
