I used the best source available. This source is top notch. I had 2 different sources and the other one I had the audio had a hiss sound throughout. The audio on this is 100% better with no hissing sound at all.
Source was a 1.68 gig file. Nice Quality 1/4 the Size!!!!!

I could of made it smaller but I didn't want to skimp very much on the audio bitrate. I used double the audio bitrate than I normally would for a regular DVD min encode. Turned out great with no loss in sound quality.
