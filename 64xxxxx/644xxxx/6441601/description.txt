Children of the Secret State - North Korea

Children of the Secret State' is an investigation into North Korea, considered by many as the last Stalinist dictatorship, a idden and sealed country riddled with propaganda and saturated with hostility to democracy and the West.

"North Korea, a country of 22 million. Up to 3 million of its people have starved to death in the last 10 years. More than 40% of North Korean children now suffer from chronic malnutrition." 

Joe Layburn and the Hardcash team discovered a young North Korean, known by the pseudonym 'Ahn Chol', who has been filiming undercover so that the world can see what is going on in his native land: the country where his parents both starved to death.

His devastating footage shows some of the estimated 200,000 street children, mainly orphans, foraging for food in the mud and the gutters, ignored by the adults around them and ignored by the state which claims they are at its bosom. Joe embarks on a state-run tourist visit of North Korea, revealing vast unoccupied hotels, empty boulevards and countless monuments of Kim Jong II, the county's leader.
