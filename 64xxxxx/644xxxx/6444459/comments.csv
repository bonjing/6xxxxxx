my powerful computer with a 1 gigabyte graphics
card unless I turn the details way down. You can
easily finish the game just by avoiding the
enemies. You start with 9 lives and 1 weapon but
that's more than enough. Your weapon has 6
shots with 20 clips and that is all you will need.
All things considered, it's a pretty good effort
for a game designed by just 3 people."
