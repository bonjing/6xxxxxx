This happens a lot. Family Guy is a full episode off every time, and American Dad is an entire season off (we're on season 7, not 6).

It's kind of funny, really. A quick look at thetvdb.com tells all. :)"
,Coren,2011-06-26T20:56Z,"It's actually the fourth produced episode of season 3, and the fifth episode from the season shown.  25 and 26 were part of season 2, regardless of when Cartoon Network elected to show them (and have been on the internet for five or six months).

On another note, why is this episode so big?  It's like 4 times the size of a normal ep."
