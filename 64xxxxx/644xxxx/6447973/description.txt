 The Killers' great gift is that they -- and in

 particular their frontman, Brandon Flowers --

 have utterly no recognition of the ridiculous.

 More than that, they're drawn to the ridiculous,

 piecing together sounds that don't belong

 together, reaching far beyond their grasp, aiming

 for profundity and slipping into silliness. All

 this weighed the band down mightily on Sam's

 Town, their convoluted Americana theme park of a

 sophomore album, all false fa ades and paper-thin

 pretension, but on its 2008 sequel, Day & Age,

 the Killers shrink the canvas and brighten their

 palette, opting for a big sound over big themes.

 Since the Killers are at their core poseurs and

 not prophets, style over substance is the right

 move and Day & Age has style for miles and miles,

 exceeding even their debut, Hot Fuss, in its

 stainless steel gleam. If anything, Hot Fuss was

 a little too monochromatic in its obsession with

 '80s synth rock, a criticism that can hardly be

 leveled at Day & Age, a record that stitches

 together sounds with an almost blissfully idiotic

 abandon. Anchored in dance-rock though they may

 be, the Killers no longer sound like mere

 disciples of New Order and Duran Duran:

 emboldened by the left turns of Sam's Town, no

 matter how misguided they may have been, the

 Killers will try anything, goosing "Losing Touch"

 with growling saxophones, creating a Strokes

 disco for "Joy Ride," flirting with worldbeat

 la Vampire Weekend on "This Is Your Life,"

 dancing the bossa nova on "I Can't Stay," and

 riding a tight soulful rock & roll groove on "The

 World We Live In," bringing it close to a mad

 fusion of Steve Miller's "Abracadabra" and Hall &

 Oates' "Private Eyes." Like before, it's

 impossible to tell if such improbable

 juxtapositions are intentional or accidental, but

 given the overall tightness of Day & Age, it

 feels as if the Killers do indeed mean to create

 these odd, often pleasing, pop pastiches. And the

 emphasis damn well should be on the sound and

 melody, for Flowers remains a downright goofy

 lyricist, whether he's misinterpreting Hunter S.

 Thompson on "Human" or recounting an alien

 abduction on "Spaceman." Ridiculousness is much

 harder to stomach in words than it is in music,

 but the nice thing about Day & Age is that not

 only is Flowers' voice relatively buried, the

 Killers are unwittingly comfortable with their

 ludicrous, outsized pop, which turns the album

 into terrifically trashy pop. Not the serious

 rock they yearn to be by any means, but these

 fashionable threads fit them better anyway.
