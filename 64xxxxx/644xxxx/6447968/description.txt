 Everything is big with Rick Ross. Triumphs,

 blunders, singles, videos, and everything else he

 does is huge, but having the audacity to call his

 third effort Deeper Than Rap is extra risky,

 especially since it's his first effort since

 being "exposed" as a former corrections officer.

 That's poison in the gangsta rap game, and while

 there's little here to sway the haters -- and

 certainly nothing "deep" -- the rapper's ability

 to steamroll over all of his shortcomings, along

 with all of our preconceived notions, is simply

 remarkable. In a sure trilogy of albums, Deeper

 Than Rap is the surest, kicking off with a decent

 50 Cent diss and closing with a "Run with me or

 run from me" ultimatum that's gutsy enough to

 feature harps and castanets. While that's enough

 fuel for the haters to burn the whole place down,

 anyone willing to ignore Ross' iffy relationship

 with street cred and his incredibly narrow

 subject matter (money, women, victory) will find

 Deeper is the superstar, gangster weekend album

 done right. Boss of them all is the grand

 "Maybach Music" with T-Pain, Kanye West, and Lil

 Wayne all in top form. Same goes for the cut's

 production team, the J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, who

 are also in charge of the slippery and swaggering

 "Magnificent" with John Legend, plus the

 Caribbean-flavored highlight "Yacht Club."

 "Face," with Trina, is the street cut of note,

 and "Usual Suspects" places in the album's top

 five, although Nas' loyal fanbase will find his

 contribution rather ordinary. Redundancy is an

 unsurprising and ignorable issue thanks to all

 the hooks and slick beats, including a batch from

 the returning Runners. Even if this isn't much

 "Deeper" than the average Three 6 Mafia album,

 the glitz and guts of Deeper are a big step up,

 making Ross sound like a Miami-fied version of

 Young Jeezy.
