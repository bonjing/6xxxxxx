Use recent Transmission: 
1) DHT rocks. So if you can't connect to tracker, this does not matters at all - DHT will do this for you. Just wait for a few moments and it will kick in :)
2) In Transmission 2.31 there is finally support for UDP-based trackers has arrived (and the only trackers alive were UDP-based ones). Enjoy!"
