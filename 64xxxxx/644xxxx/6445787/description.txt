This is a full copy of The Curse Of Monkey Island (Monkey Island 3) for Mac OSx (Intel Only). What differentiates this copy from others is that it works as a "native" Mac OS application. Although it uses Scummvm to run the game, it will launch like any other application, even if it's not in your application folder. You will also not be promted with the Scummvm boot screen. 


The following files have been removed from the original CDs:
DirectX install
Windows Installer
Windows Launcher (including Curse.exe)
You will not be asked to change CD during the game.
The game files have NOT been shrinked, edited or touched at all, hence the huge size.
