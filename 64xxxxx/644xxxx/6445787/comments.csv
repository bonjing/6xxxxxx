Thanks for the Up, much appreciated!"
,denpaotoko,2011-06-14T18:42Z,"This is the UK-version. Hence, english only. Shouldn't be a problem for you to replace the files in the app-bundle if you want other languages though. ;) "

,morbid519,2011-11-06T19:00Z,"I looked on the scummvm website, and it said I needed the the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files to run it, and the game comes with comi.ai, curse.go, and Makefile. Is there a way around this?"
