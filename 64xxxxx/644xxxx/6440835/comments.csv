Another thing, I know people say this a lot, and they never mean it, but I have been looking forward to this game forever, and I will in fact be buying this for PS3 when it comes out, being that I want the trophies and I want the actual game in its case, but yeah, I'm super stoked to play this.

So far the game plays well. The only real issue I've seen is in the cinematic movies, the subtitles are falling off the bottom of the screen and sometimes they get stuck when someone is talking to you so the subtitles no longer match the words.

,Poweruser123,2011-06-04T23:42Z,"""Yeah, I've always wondered how come some games come ''already installed'', how does this work? ""

Any game can be distributed this way really. 

The main reason why retail games have install routines is because the data is compressed. The installer expands the files and stores everything in the correct place. Another reason is to create any registry entries that may be necessary for the game to run, as well as automate other things like installing PunkBuster and the latest DirectX runtime.

This torrent contains a version of the game that is uncompressed, doesn't automatically install any dependancies and is designed to run independantly of any OS/registry settings. "
,ithurts,2011-06-05T17:18Z,"100% legit 
No installer, just decompress & play.

 3. Now to play the game! Use the dxhr5_win7.exe The games graphic configure program pops up. Do what changes you want there if you think you might have little issues when playing. Then Click The OK button. Now the configure program wont come up again after you do that. So when you want to play the game again. Just Click the dxhr5_win7.exe and enjoy!"

,DopeShowVal,2011-07-16T18:12Z,"This game works perfectly. Not the full game but more than a demo by far. Remember it is a leaked beta. 

For the people saying this is fake:
If you don't know how to use game torrents, follow instructions, or quit whining about your own stupidity, just shut up and go away.

You can se a perfect example of someone just trying to start trouble, or make others think something is wrong with a torrent in the ""Atari emailed me"" comment. Atari has nothing to do with this game, so would not be contacting anyone. If you can't learn to sort through the comments and see who is an idiot, and who sounds like they actually know what they are doing, you might as well give up now on this site.

As far as this game being a non installed version. Whats the problem? Would you rather have something sit there and have to install for 20 minutes, or would you rather just extract some files, move some files and play. Once this DL completed I was playing inside 5 miniutes. 

I also had great speed, approaching 1.8 megs a sec. Thanks seeders!"

I get to the settings screen, not paying attention that the screen refresh rate was set to 85, not 75. I launched impatiently and was cock-blocked by a black screen of ""Out of range"".

Now obviously, my monitor can't support that refresh rate. My problem is that there is no way to open the settings tab before launching the game again.

I tried deleting the folder and i couldn't possibly know where the game stores it's settings files. I managed to find some in my Application Data, but that didn't help at all.

Pretty rare problem, isn't it? Would appreciate help on this."

,Orphan_Soul,2011-08-12T20:41Z,"Some people seem to be having problems installing this game so here is how i did it:-

Once downloaded move it into a seperate folder just so you can keep an eye on what is happening...extract it to the same folder...once that is done extract the 'crack' to the same folder and overwrite when prompted.

Now double click on the 'win7' exe....you got this new icon in the folder from the crack....play and have fun :).....the game doesnt install in the normal way like an ISO

Remember there are some bugs in the game because it is a beta and people will experience different ones...its just life and how things work out...for instance my aiming reticule sometimes isnt visible and another one is that once i am holding a weapon i sometimes cant put it away. Doesnt spoil the game though for me...its a small price to pay for the sheer joy of been able to play.

Huge thanks to Amputate for uploading this game :)"
,Orphan_Soul,2011-08-12T21:05Z,"@ Syn.wtf

You say you almost meet the specs needed apart from your CPU...that is where your problem lies.

Most modern games are CPU heavy...if your CPU is below spec and also couple that with a bare min spec graphics card you will run into problems and no amount of tinkering will solve it.

You could have the best motherboard in the world and the best graphics card but if your CPU is as dumb as a box of spanners it doesnt matter how much the rest of your system tries to tell it what to do it is incapable of doing it because it isnt brainy enough.

By the way im not having a dig at you im just trying to explain that you are asking your pc to do something it just hasnt a clue how to and never will...time to open the wallet and upgrade my friend :)

the game works, its not a corrupted rar and it's not an iso file, its simply 2 .rar files, one containing the game and one containing the crack files, extract the game file and then extract the crack files, then replace the original files from the extracted game file with the crack files, then double click one of the .exe files and start playing, no installation required.
