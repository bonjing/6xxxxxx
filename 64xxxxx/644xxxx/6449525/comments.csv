,drako314,2011-08-22T07:50Z,"Very good, the only thing that i would mention is that on some episodes it does flash green and go pixillated, usually only in the end credits. But hey who watches the credits(this is using VLC media player) other than that very nice well done and thanks so much for the upload!"
