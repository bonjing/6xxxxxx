How Linux Works What Every Superuser Should Know-viny

How Linux Works describes the inside of the Linux system for systems administrators, whether they maintain an extensive network in the office or one Linux box at home. Some books try to give you copy-and-paste instructions for how to deal with every single system issue that may arise, but How Linux Works actually shows you how the Linux system functions so that you can come up with your own solutions.
After a guided tour of filesystems, the boot sequence, system management basics, and networking, author Brian Ward delves into open-ended topics such as development tools, custom kernels, and buying hardware, all from an administratorâ€™s point of view. With a mixture of background theory and real-world examples, this book shows both â€œhowâ€ to administer Linux, and â€œwhyâ€ each particular technique works, so that you will know how to make Linux work for you.
