,danielhavok,2011-08-28T19:27Z,Hi r3dcat! Can you start uploading more 3D movie titles Please? I have a Panasonic p50st30 and all your IMAX tiles work great on my tv but for some weird reason all of LigGeorge's uploads dont want to work on mine. They stutter and have no audio.
,opt80,2011-09-26T16:41Z,I HAVE AN LG 3d. LiG's copy not workin  4 me too.
,teamonz,2011-11-23T10:42Z,"could you please upload it with frame rate less than 30 FPS
my LG 3DTV doesn't support this frame rate"

,AllzCool123,2012-01-02T14:37Z,Always give VIDEO SAMPLE. Seems terribly undersized for 1080p. SBS 720p is ok around 4GB but SBS 1080p has to be at least 7 GB or more since you effectively have 2 blu-ray movies (1 for each eye) stuffed in one file.
