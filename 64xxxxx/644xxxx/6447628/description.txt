Description......: By forensically analyzing war records and real testimony, SURVIVING D-DAY reveals that the difference 
		   between life and death for American soldiers hung on such details as what they ate for breakfast, the 
		   interpretation of a weather forecast, or the design of a buckle strap. Yet despite ingenious and 
		   creative tactical devices and strategies, the most powerful weapons of warfare were still leadership 
		   and bravery. The special tells these incredible stories -- many told by Omaha Beach veterans 
		   themselves -- to examine this historic day and reveal who survived... and why.
