Book Description from Amazon.com


Standing over the autopsy table gives you an unparalleled perspective on every element
of the autopsy procedure. Remarkable details of disease and injury appear right before
your eyes, presenting a complete picture that leads you in the direction of death. Now,
those striking images have been taken from the table to the text in the only full-color
guide to all aspects of the autopsy.

Forensic pathology is a visual discipline, making images essential to properly explaining
the critical process. Featuring over 500 full-color photographs, Color Atlas of the Autopsy
provides unadulterated access to every probe of the autopsy procedure. As the only atlas
to focus on autopsy protocol, the book introduces the process and principles of the
procedure to uninitiated professionals who interact with the pathologist before, during,
and after the autopsy.

This incomparable guide presents an astonishing visual experience that goes beyond
a demonstration to demystify the autopsy.
