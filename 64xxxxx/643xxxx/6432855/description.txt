This is a record full of atmosphere and beauty, dark shadows, flickers of light and wind both ethereal and haunting. Blending classical and eastern European folk influences Clogs are like a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered, shelved upon a dusty old shelf forgotten by time and place. This album in particular has an 'otherness' to it, that intangible quality that completely creates its own universe, pictures and emotions. Stunningly evocative music for those who don't need a photograph to see real beauty.
