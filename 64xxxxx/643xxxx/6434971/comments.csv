,g0dsize,2011-05-30T18:57Z,"Decent little game for $15, and worth the $15 for the co-op mode alone.  Has a few bugs, but patches will fix those. Been playing it for a week or so, and it's a fun diversion. 

Downloading this as another copy to play over LAN.  Will report back once it's installed.

@PcBiga -- extremezone is a VERY trustworthy uploader, and SKiDROW one of the best groups out there -- I wouldn't sweat any false positives on their uploads."
,devrindare,2011-05-30T18:59Z,"thanks for upload

,Cogollito,2011-05-30T23:31Z,"If you want a nice D&D PC game to play on Lan, get NWN2. This ""D&D game"" is so hack n slashy that doesnt even deserve to have Dungeons & Dragons in his title."
,byers,2011-05-30T23:58Z,"@Cogollito NWN2 is garbage. Obsidian is terrible. If you want a good D&D game, get Baldur's Gate 2. Everything else is a step down."
,prikosnoveni,2011-05-31T00:12Z,This one has nothing to do with games like Baldur's Gate or even NWN. This is just a boring hack & slash piece of crap that's been done countless times before.
,Cogollito,2011-05-31T01:18Z,"@byers

You're right, Baldur's Gate is a hell of a game. But NWN can be really inmersive."
,reyasl,2011-05-31T09:38Z,is single player or another crap mmorpg online pay to win or pay to play..
,DitoLangAko,2011-05-31T09:48Z,seed please i want to play this game

,calurian,2011-05-31T15:13Z,"this game works perfect some dll missing but you can download on google, i love this game thx"
,Taldon39,2011-05-31T20:04Z,"As an old AD&D-Fan, this is a no RPG. It is only HackÂ´n Slay. ItÂ´s build like D&D online, but not as good as the Online-Game.

Thanks for the Release SKIDROW, but a negativ Vote from me for the Game."
,paraalpha,2011-05-31T22:35Z,i'm not getting any sound effects outside of the intro woman's voice.  Any suggestions?
,paraalpha,2011-05-31T22:41Z,I'm not getting any sound outside of the womans voice in the intro.  Anyone else?  Any suggestions?
,vzarnlcaf,2011-06-01T00:11Z,"SOUND PROBLEM FIX (for me anyways)

If your having problems with no sound and running windows xp, try the following.

Click start >>> Run >>> DXDIAG >>> SOUND >>> Move the acceleration slider from full acceleration to Basic acceleration.

Fixed the problem for me, goodluck"
,Kaupo,2011-06-01T02:27Z,"Kind of epic ULing the 2% I have gotten with 400 and DL is stuck at 50.
and no my UL rate doesn't affect DL rate it has to be about 800 to start to affect DL speed.
ppl sure don't like to seed it seems"
,creschlan,2011-06-01T09:17Z,On win vista and uper just open the game with win xp sp3 compatibility and sound will work.
,Esmad3,2011-06-01T11:27Z,"this is a fun little game, and this version works online. All you need is a GameSpy account"
,ejester,2011-06-01T19:54Z,"Just curious if this is just me - because I can't seem to find anyone mentioning this problem...

I can't see the stats on any of the items.

I also can't remap any of the keys in the game (mouse/keyboard).

I can live without remapping - but not being able to see any of the item stats is a major game breaker tbh.

Any screenshot / video I see of peoples inventory screens, it always just shows the item highlighted and the item stats appear in a box at the bottom of the screen.

That box is blank for me. Please help me understand what I am doing wrong."
,clonies,2011-06-01T20:22Z,The game doesn't start. Fail!
,clonies,2011-06-01T20:25Z,I just installed the game and copied what was inside the SKIDROW folder to the game folder. Anything else I need to do?
,foreverkiller,2011-06-01T20:59Z,"Download quickly and smoothly - installed patch as required - no viruses // Decent little dungeon-crawl, though fairly short (was at lvl 9 before finishing the game) - a few bugs such as texture graphics on some armor and weapons but nothing major.  Certainly, it could have been a far better developed gamem though it could have been far worse as well.  Fun factor 6/10"
,stogi1knobi,2011-06-02T03:08Z,Is this Diablo style play type of game?
,Lithiumn,2011-06-02T04:30Z,"Worst game ever lol. Rating 4/10.  The torrent itself though went perfectly smooth, easy download and as always I appreciate the upload.  However this game is terrible.  I thought, hey maybe atari is making a comeback lol, but this game would have only been acceptable in the days of Playstation 1.  The controls are easy to learn, the game's interface is very lacking, kind of annoying if anything.  The graphics tab, does almost nothing.  The graphics at best are outdated and the game doesn't want to run smoothly despite this, though I noticed very little fps difference from low to high.  There are of course fixed characters, which would have been fine considering you at least get to pick your feats, but not from the average D20 based pc game even, it's a poor imitation of the D20 system, and if you're going to download a few gigs for some enjoyment out of a game, I would suggest Dungeons and Dragons online, as it's free, and actually put together.  This is a poor excuse for a port and I'm sorry if any of you downloaded this.  This is a game for children and consoles, Not the pc.  Even on a console I would have a hard time reconciling the fact that I payed money for this very lacking adventure game.  Fable 1 is more complex, please please please if you are a game enthusiast and over the age of 16 Do not download this game.  You will be deleting it shortly thereafter if you do."
,Stormbow,2011-06-02T16:38Z,"REMEMBER PEOPLE!  There is a REASON this game was RELEASED with a $14.99 price tag!  (The game is garbage, overall.)  Don't expect anything fantastic, and don't forget you're stealing it for FREE.

You get what you pay for...and often much less than that when Atari is involved.  (Need I remind anyone of Temple of Elemental Evil at release?)"
,effepirat,2011-06-02T21:04Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!
lol, because this game is total SHIIIIIIT!
all i wonder after trying this, is HOW did they POSSIBLY obtain the D&D licence to make this putrid stinkpile?
then again, maybe its worth the laugh.
so DL if you wanna laugh at something horrible. :)"
,Nerd4ever,2011-06-03T02:56Z,"I've been playing games since forever, but this game made me think about retiring from gaming. And those dwarfs ""sounds"" at the first 30 minutes of the game? what the F was that all about? made me wanna gag every time I hear it. I was excited about this at first when I read about the title on Gamespot.  I Was really hoping for a Planescape Torment, Arcanum Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, Baldurs gate, Icewind Dale experience. Shame on you Atari for releasing a game like this one. Thank goodness for Witcher 2 now that's the game I can happily my $$ on.

All and all its a really bad game.. Thanks for the upload though.

Thank God for TPB atleast I can try the games first before spending $$ on it."
,vood2322,2011-06-03T12:32Z,"I don't care what rating the game got, as an old gamer my heart starts racing when I see Dungeons and Dragons in the title lol"
,Akrnines,2011-06-03T14:12Z,"It's not a bad game for what it is, but it could've been alot better with a few minor changes.

I didn't finish it, though."
,SUY45H,2011-06-06T11:01Z,Says It has Stopped Working.. Any idea? :(
[V],matimike,2011-06-08T07:40Z,"works perfectly. thanks again for another quality release/upload SKIDROW/extremezone

i dont know what some people are on about i like the game and am having fun with it. real simple if you dont like the game dont play it."
,DouGh74,2011-06-09T06:19Z,is the crack included?  please let me know! I'll look in SKIDROW folder for one.  appreciate it! 
,Ikharus,2011-06-12T21:41Z,"I found the game decent, minus the horrible lacking of customization, graphics settings (for lowering or heightening) but so far, about 10 feet into the game I'm already finding problems.
It's difficult to position yourself correctly to pick up or use anything, like the lever, you have to be exactly in front of it, and there are several bugs...

Right at the beginning I finished the first quest and the dwarf guy is all YAYAYAY THANKS and it just sits on his face and doesn't bring me back to camera, and I can see I'm being attacked by the sounds and stuff. If it's that early on I doubt there was any testing on this at all."
,666Loke,2011-06-18T03:47Z,"Thanks.
The good news is that the rip works excellent, joust mount it, install it and move the SKIDROW files.

The bad news is that the game is really crappy. It is so stupid that I got a headache. But if you think that the first Diablo was too complicated both in mechanics and story you might like this game.
1/10"
,SUY45H,2011-06-21T08:38Z,What's The Serial? :(

,HOOKERSnBLOW,2011-07-14T09:09Z,Just think of this as a bad Diablo clone and you wont be dissapointed
,HOOKERSnBLOW,2011-07-14T09:11Z,O snap! Thanks Extremezone!!! 
,jkrkiss,2011-07-21T05:32Z,I am being an idiot or is there something  I am missing? I mounted and installed. Then copied over everything in the SKIDROW file. It will not start. I don't even get an error.
,realawesomedude,2011-08-13T21:41Z,"@vood2322 

you''re right and i hope that ppl have some trust in years off producing and making games in what it is today many games are actual based on the concept dungeon and dragons so if ya dont like it you should play cod or c&c and not rpg because RPG IS MADE OF D&D YOU FUCKING ASSHOLES 

MANYthnx extremezone 

ppl just dl it dont listen too those shooting and strategy-gamers that have no love for rpg "

Spent the little time needed for that well written review and you'll save a lot more time you'd have wasted on this game.
Such a shame. The box art looked promising."
