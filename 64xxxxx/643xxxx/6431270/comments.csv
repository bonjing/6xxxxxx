The best way is to buy a hdmi cord and hook your computer up too your tv' now for those of you that don't have a hdtv' or just think thats way too hard just' go up to the pirate search type in dvd converter click application then download a dvd converter' after that you will be able to rip the movie or whatever to a disk and watch it in a normal dvd player. I understand the point of using of ps3 is to not use disk' but on movies thats protected by 'cinava' I can't find any other way to watch em' besides what is stated above.  I understand that some of you think this is stuff that everyone knows but its seems like it not, from all the 'it won't play on my ps3' comments' "

First, if you believe EVERYTHING wikipedia tells you and it's your go-to for info then you need to get your head out of your ass!

Secondly, a Telesync is copied from the original film reel. Either from a direct copy from the reel itself or a high quality camera taping from the projectors booth. Then the audio is added in synched up to the video. Hence the term 'synced'. 

Anything taking by some noobs camera, phone, I-pod or whatever from his seat in a theatre is a cam. Learn your definitions before you go and and flame someone you douche. Your link to Wiki even proved you yourself wrong....

""The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera's own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronisation which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. A TS can be considered a higher quality type of cam, that has the potential of better-quality audio and video

The reason why true telesync movies are so much harder to get now is that movie theatres have taken steps to insure that projection screen operators can not copy movies so easily.

So this is a cam copy not a telesync. This file is mislabeled and you sir are not only wrong, but your own argument proved you wrong. 

Epic Fail!!"
,tippeetom,2011-07-14T17:50Z,"im not going to sit here and slate noobs, everyone has to start somewhere but i am sick to deaf of reading shitty comments from these sad cunts who have no idea how long it takes to capture, process and upload a film, or the risk they go to get these copys. you cant moan about shit thats free, get a grip. i bet all these sad fucks are the ones who dont seed! Thanks TvTeam, keep up the good work and thanks to all seeders
Peace"
,spifkitten99,2011-07-16T05:56Z,"Zethar, are you fucking retarded?

Don't open your mouth, when you are that stupid.

TS (telesync) is NOT copied directly from the reel.

TS is a CAM with AUDIO form a line.

How the fuck can you be stupid enough to think that this is anything from but a cam?

And you know what, wikipedia is an EXCELLENT goto place for information. Only uneducated noobs like you always have to say how wikipedia isn't a good source, while it is actually a really really good place to go for information. You have to understand that it's usersubmitted, and have your common sense with you, and not take it as ultimate truth, however, it is an excelent place for info.

All the bullshit you just wrote has no relevance at all.

This video is a CAM. ALL TS video are cams. Cams with the POTENTIAL to be better than a regular cam."
,spifkitten99,2011-07-16T05:58Z,"Zethar, I know read beyond the first line of your comment, and realize I 100% agree with you. My bad for raging without reading what you guys are arguing about yet. Yes, this file is clearly just a CAM, and not a TS."
,spifkitten99,2011-07-16T06:01Z,"tippeetom, you are the sad fuck for reading comments, when you are sick of them.

It has no relevance how long or whatever it takes to do this shit.

This video is SHIT quality.

It has no relevance that it's free. The comments are also free. Why are you bitching about them? Such a typical idiotic thing to say by people like you. Free or not has no relevance. The video is shit."
,Wheezy,2011-07-16T17:41Z,"@spifkitten99
Seems a bit hypocritical to be going off at tipeetom for his comment by saying he is a sad fuck for reading comments, when judging by your previous comment, you clearly didn't bother to read Zethars comment at all. Then proceeded to run your mouth about how he is wrong....and then back track because you realised you were wrong.
TS is what Zethar said it is, a copy from the actual film reel, i can give you url examples of a proper TS compared to this cam.
Don't get me wrong I have downloaded this with the knowledge it was poor quality. I feel no need to comment on the quality, if you are smart enough, you should just know by now you aren't going to get a decent copy of a highly anticipated new release. I went to the world premier of Star Trek at the Sydney opera house and the tech they had to stop people filming was beyond a joke, night-vision, watermarks in the film and audio, confiscated all mobiles before entering and bag searches with metal detectors. This just goes to show the lengths they are going to to stop early leaks and piracy."
,killerg83,2011-07-17T11:14Z,"Zethar, you are indeed a epic fail.  A TS is a cam synced with NON cam audio, i.e. recorded from another source. 
You my ill informed brethren are talking about a TC, TeleCine, it is a TeleCine that is taken from the film reel.  Before slating others actually know what you are on about.  The film IS A TS, i.e. a freaking cam, its not mislabelled, you are just ill informed..."
