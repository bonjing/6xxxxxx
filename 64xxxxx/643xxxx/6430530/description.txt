[W4F PRESENTS]: Monster.Moves.S05E03.Titanic.Trains.HDTV.XviD-W4F

 
[RELEASE DATE]: 2011/05/29

 
[GENRE.......]: Documentary

 
[DESCRIPTION.]:
An intrepid team race to rescue two rare Churchill steam
Locomotives, hauling them 850 miles across Turkey before
shipping them back to the UK.

Saved from the scrapmans blowtorch, these ancient engines
were originally sent to Turkey by Winston Churchill.

The locomotives are no longer able to run under their own
steam, and too heavy to truck across Turkeys mountainous
roads. So the British team of steam enthusiasts have to hitch
their way across Turkey on a series of freight trains.
Navigating the single-track lines proves challenging and
theres the constant risk that these massive but fragile beasts
could disintegrate beneath their feet.

Will the team reach the docks in Turkey in time to load the
lumbering locomotives onto the cargo ship for their sea
journey back to Britain?
