[V],aoloffline,2011-05-29T21:07Z,:-) This is the extended version..There are good english subs available but not for this...Someone has to add the extra lines...
[V],BOZX,2011-05-29T21:13Z,.
[V],GoodFilms,2011-05-30T06:03Z,I think it's generally best waiting till there is a subbed version.
,blahstar,2011-05-30T06:08Z,"What's the best quality version to download at the moment? This or just wait a bit longer for a 1080p rip? Is this movie filmed with a poorer quality camera, since all the clips I've seen aren't razor sharp?"
[V],meech,2011-05-30T19:23Z,This is a great release for all the Japanese piratebay users out there...and for any linguistic majors who may have studied Japanese.  Too bad for the rest of us.
,devochkan,2011-05-31T21:17Z,please someone. direct me to the subs. this films looks unbelievable!!!! thanks for the upload.
,blahstar,2011-06-05T08:03Z,"Any update on the English subs?
What about splayer and it's auto sub search feature?"
,zmajcekBo,2011-06-05T10:23Z,"Some subtitles for this release are on podnapisi dot net (Japan, Chinese), there were English ones too, for a day, I saw them, but aren't in the database now, I guess there were issues with them."
,luis17se,2011-06-06T06:40Z,"@zmajcekBo:
You are right. I downloaded them but they were just gibberish ... probably a fail attempt from Chinese or Japanese to English using an engine translator ... Still hopping someone knowledgeable in those languages will bring a solution for us :-)"
,zmajcekBo,2011-06-06T08:35Z,"@luis17se
I wouldn't say that. For I downloaded those (now deleted) English subs, and compared them with then added (13.Assassins.2010.m-720p.Bluray.AC3.x264-EliteCoder), they have the same (seemingly quite good, reasonable) text and timemarks -- that work and cover approximately 90% of this long cut (watched it just yesterday). So that some 10% are left untranslated. A big of a deal, but then not that big of a deal maybe (with this film in particular I mean)."
,luis17se,2011-06-10T05:32Z,"@zmajcekBo:
We were talking about different files obviously. I downloaded the subtitles you mention, a good solution for the time being, thanks."
,mufuti9,2011-06-10T12:00Z,"It is a big deal!

There is no complete subtitle available as of yet,all the available subs are missing about 18 MINUTES.

Many key scenes  are completely lacking any translation and important parts of the story will be missed. "
,zmajcekBo,2011-06-12T15:54Z,"@mufuti9 Let's consider it fortunate, the film is over-dialoged."
,VelvetMirror,2011-06-16T20:44Z,"This seems a really great movie, hopefully the subtitles will come along soon. 

I would recommend meanwhile Ichi the Killer, another movie of the director of 13 Assassins (Takashi Miike). "
,liq456,2011-06-25T15:55Z,here are the working subs http://subscene.com/english/13-Assassins/subtitle-445614.aspx
,liq456,2011-06-26T04:32Z,sorry the subs i posted are messed up too.
,RiCkY82,2011-07-18T18:48Z,"These subs work for me with this release, it's all correct in sync and nothing missing so far: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6535558/13assassins.srt
