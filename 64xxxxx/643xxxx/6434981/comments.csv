try to increase size{700-800mb} of your encodes that will result in, increase in bit-rates.
i mean no disrespect.
thank you"
[T],ILPruny,2011-05-30T20:01Z,"I make small encodes because i need more free space on hdd, i have many 1080p files so i cannot keep 700mb stuff.
Makin 700-800mb would be very easy for me but i dont need that."
,gaaraisgod,2011-05-30T23:03Z,"Nah, there's plenty of 700MB releases out there. This is what we need more."
,nataline,2011-05-31T04:27Z,"Pardon my ignorance, but what is the difference in the sizes. Im new at downloading on here and not always sure when too and when not too download. So far ive had decent luck. Thanks for any info."

,krisrogers1818,2011-06-03T23:22Z,"@nataline  there are different needs and suck for movies::: for a bluray video aka 1080p it should be in the higher file size like 1.2-1.7 gb

now for a reg avi of a video it would normally be about 500 mb - 800 mb

for mp4 ` quicktime formats it will be less like 300 mb -500 mb"
,crossx77,2011-06-04T16:29Z,"apple016 - Your a baffoon, an MP4 encoded in x264 will only be a small file but better quaility than an AVI file!!!

Know your facts before you start giving out advise!"
