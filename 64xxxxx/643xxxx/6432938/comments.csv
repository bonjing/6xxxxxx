,da_os,2011-05-30T23:14Z,"muchas gracias! for this and all la liga torrents. always more fun to watch in spanish. 

@muhu88: you must be a man u fan.."
[V],Nepotu,2011-05-31T01:53Z,"@da_os: For you and others like you i take the effort to upload these torrents. I've said: ""For the FC Barcelona's fans!"" Who don't need spanish, go to see other championships. But you are a really FCB's fan. Sorry because not every match I've found in spanish. But I think that La Liga is better with his own language.
@muhu88: Open your mind! If you aren't MU fan. :)"
