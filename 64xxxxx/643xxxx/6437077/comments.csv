[T],rjaa,2011-06-14T15:48Z,"no virus this is virus free 

scanned with Norton 2011"
,CHAOS1972,2011-06-18T03:55Z,"Funny.... It say's ""serial"" but it includes a ""patch""

Also i have the latest Avast and it is snatched away before it can even be run. 

Also on VirusTotal it gets 26 fails out of 42!!
Including NORTON!!!

That's pretty bad... 

I got this one, 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6433569/MakeMKV_1.6.10

And it works and does not make my AV go wonkers.

Just saying as i know a lot of things throw false positives. 

I have game trainers that make my AV go nutzo!!"

,Doshiou,2011-10-26T21:06Z,"I'm willing to trust a ""Trusted"" account. But what is the point in claiming it's virus scanned? You offer no proof, and... Norton, seriously? You don't seem even remotely computer educated.

Anyway, spammers will be spamming sub-human scum. No need to reply."
