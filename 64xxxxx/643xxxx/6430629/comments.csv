[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-29T03:57Z,those screen caps are of no use.  699x291 resolution.
[T],IceBane,2011-05-29T11:57Z,"the resion i have to do that for the screens. 

1. some sites i upload to dont do thumbs and others dont do the larger image so i had to try and have a middle ground. 

2. also i did that for bandwidth issues. when i first started doing 1080p people where complaining that the pages would load slowly. 

i am working with some of the sites so i can start to use thumbs but as of right now, thy are not working right. "
