,rayomand96,2011-05-29T21:35Z,neonrainbow i really appreciate your torrents but the mkv format just does not play in most players would request u to switch back to the mp4 format

@ rayomand96 - You just need to download the right codecs! Try Media Player Classic! It plays everything! Also VLC or Divx player! They are also pretty good!

,downhillrider,2011-05-30T11:03Z,I think he was talking in terms of playing on the PS3 or 360. neonrainbow usually ups mp4 w/2channel audio so we can use them on those 2 consoles. I hope this isnt a change from that.

,rayomand96,2011-05-30T22:33Z,"@ downhillrider.... Thank you for understanding
@ MoviesR101.... bro downhillrider is right whats the use of downloading a 720p file if u have to watch it on a pc or laptop, it makes more sense to watch it on a 52 inch LCD therefore the mp4 file is better"
,d.reaper,2011-06-05T18:27Z,"@rayomand96 I agree,but  not a prob if you hook your pc to your tv...I have played 1080p from my pc to my tv."
