,Affar2k,2011-07-22T13:29Z,"Finally, a DTS release"
[T],thetorrentlord,2011-08-23T02:47Z,This is mislabeled. It is not in English. It only has English subtitles. Thanks for letting people D/L something that they may not want since it does not have an English soundtrack. Please try to get your facts correct in the future. Or if you have an English soundtrack upload it and we can re-mux it ourselves.
