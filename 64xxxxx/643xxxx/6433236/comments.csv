[T],FatFreddy007,2011-05-30T22:54Z,"No usar VSO ConvertXtoDVD v4 porque les quitara el menú. 

Para quemar el DVD lo tienen que hacer con NERO, si quieren generar un archivo de norma ISO lo pueden hacer con DVD Shrink que es un software gratuito o también lo pueden hacer con CloneDVD2 seleccionando todo el contenido incluyendo los idiomas y seleccionando (mantener el menú), de esta forma generan el archivo de norma ISO o también pueden quemar el DVD."

,MoviesR101,2011-06-02T23:30Z,"@ xway - This is easier to burn to Dvd! You can use CopytoDvd and it will burn this TS Folder straight to the Dvd! With an Iso File you have to open the file 1st and then you can burn it to a Dvd! This save you 1 less step!

@ Seedkey - This particular movie has movie previews at the beginning? Usually your movies do not have previews at the beginning, is there a file I can delete so that when I burn and play this movie file, It goes straight to the 2nd menu?"
,MoviesR101,2011-06-02T23:39Z,I think I figured out what files to delete! Thanks!
,MoviesR101,2011-06-03T07:46Z,"I deleted 2 of the files and then the TS folder size was 4.06GB. So I burned that to a disk and tried to play it and wouldn't play? I thought I had figured it, but I didn't? Seedkey can you help me?"
,willnava,2011-06-05T22:47Z,men can you upload THE DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004)?? thanks
[T],FatFreddy007,2011-06-10T16:30Z,"@MoviesR101: you have to use CloneDVD2...select everything except advertising. 
that region is your player? R2?"
,MoviesR101,2011-06-11T21:14Z,@Seedkey - Thanks For The Information and All The Great Uploads!
,realtor388,2011-06-16T20:27Z,Wondering if anyone knows why when I try and watch this movie and others with vlc player all I get is sound and no movie
,zmonstr,2011-06-17T06:58Z,"I cant figure out why it there are multiple ts files, the movie stops and I have to click on the next one and then the audio is in SPANISH fo 3 TS files then resumes english at the last file. I admit I'm not computer savvy but I havent had problems with bit torrents like this. Any suggesations for someone whpo has DL this movie and REALLY wants to watch it!!!!"
,MoviesareFree,2011-06-21T15:59Z,"@ realtor388 - Download Media Classic Player(4MB)! It's is the Best player and it is on TPB and I am one who still seeding it!

@ zmonstr - With this file, you can burn straight to Dvd with CopytoDvd found on TPB! The audio and the sub titles are in English, French, Spanish! So I am not sure why you said the audio switched from one language to another? This particular download has previews at the beginning, it does not go straight to the menu! You can download clonedvd2! It will allow you to copy everything minus the previews! I asked the same question a couple of lines before your question!"
