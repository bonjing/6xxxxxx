,torretadon,2012-05-07T22:56Z,"The audio is great and the video is quite good! For anyone wondering, this isn't HD quality but is definitely good given the file sizes.

Thank you uploader and seeders."
,Lovykar,2012-05-08T16:02Z,@thedude1979: Because it is in .mp4 and not .avi format. :) 
,AshlyRRR,2012-05-20T20:59Z,"WARNING: I got an email from my ISP for copyright infringement! That said, I don't wanna discourage seeding, but now I watch all Sherlock EPs through sherlock.vyrantstudios.com (HD stream, you just need to register). Gotta look for alternatives, sadly."
,AshlyRRR,2012-05-20T21:04Z,"Let this be a warning - you might receive an unpleasant email from your ISP! They're probably tracking Sherlock torrents seeing as I got one for ""copyright infringement.""

,tp3813,2012-05-31T17:02Z,"it may well be nice upload, but at present speed will take ages to find out! Incredibly slow, with over 100 seeders speeds like 0.7-3.5 kB/s...how can that be?"

,tp3813,2012-06-02T18:36Z,"Re the slow speed despite 100+ seeders, dont know much about technical side of torrents, but friend tells me its to do with Seeders/Leechers ratio   which at present is 102 (1064)...this correct?"
,torque96,2012-06-14T03:34Z,"Thanks again.
