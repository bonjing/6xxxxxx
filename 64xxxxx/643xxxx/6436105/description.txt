This is a fan collection of the best MGS2 tracks. It is not the lame soundtracks from the cutscenes, but rather the in-game music you hear, including the VR missions and the Snake Tales. It is made up of bits and pieces of 4 collections I have found on The Bay and Demonoid. I have just amassed them for your convenience, I hope this collection impacts you the way it has impacted me. Please, enjoy and seed forever.
