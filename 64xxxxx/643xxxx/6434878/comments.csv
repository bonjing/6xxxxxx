,flaudus,2011-05-30T23:10Z,Hello-nobody2007-Thanks for any comment-It is crappy if you pay for it-not much better if you do not but it does work.From what I have read this one was open source and D.W added some scripts to it and changed the name to xtorrent and put a price on it-open source should be free
