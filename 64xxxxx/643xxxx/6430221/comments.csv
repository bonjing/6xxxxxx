,fredfan,2011-10-09T17:17Z,".MKV file...NOT a DVD-R.  The English and Portuguese subs are included in SEPARATE .srt files.  Nordic soft-subs are already integrated into the file. Good luck retaining the 5.1 surround sound in any (very difficult) attempts at conversion into a soft-sub DVD format.

Couldn't ANYBODY put out an English soft-subbed DVD-R format of this film?  Must not be enough interest, I guess."
