SSD Life Pro 2.1.29

SSDlife is a small and intuitive SSD diagnostic tool that helps users obtain comprehensive information about their SSD drives and take timely action if any problems are detected. If you take SSD's seriously and have replaced hard drives with SSD units, don't forget that their life expectancy is considerably shorter than that of regular hard drives. So if you want to know the approximate time frame for the swap, SSDlife will be a perfect choice.
