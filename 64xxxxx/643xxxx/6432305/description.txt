     Under cover of darkness, while an unsuspecting city sleeps, an alien life
     form begins to sow the seeds of unspeakable terror. Donald Sutherland,
     Brooke Adams, Leonard Nimoy and Jeff Goldblum star in this shocking,
     first-rate suspense thriller that literally chills the blood.

     One by one the residents of San Francisco are becoming drone-like shadows
     of their former selves. As the phenomenon spreads, two Department of
     Health workers, Matthew (Sutherland) and Elizabeth (Adams), uncover the
     horrifying truth: Mysterious pods are cloning humans - and destroying the
     originals! The unworldly invasion grows stronger with each passing minute,
     hurling Matthew and Elizabeth into a desperate race to save not only
     their own lives, but the future of the entire human race.
