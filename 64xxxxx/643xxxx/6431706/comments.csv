[T],burgundyranger,2011-05-29T20:18Z,"Sorry for the glitch. I've been seeding both versions for the last six hours. But I think, somehow, the tracker attached to this torrent was different than the one I was using with my client.

But the other tracker has been added and I think all will work itself out now. I am showing upload activity on both versions."
