Yan Baray - Visions From Another World (2011)

YAN BARAY (born Jan Baruca) is a Slovenian musician, guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Yan was born in a family of musicians. As a child he observed his father on stage (also a singer and drummer), and his interest for music grows since then. So, Yan started his life with music. First he learned drums in a music school for two years, but very soon he knew that drums are not the right instrument for him. At the age of 13 he started to play the guitar and soon after started to perform as a guitarist and back vocalist in various local groups and some great Slovenian musicians. He studied sound engineering in Trieste â€“ Italy. In the years after finishing the school he produced songs and albums for various local musicians and groups. In all this time he got weary of doing music only for others, a great wish to create his own music, something authorial was growing inside him. So the songs of his first album were created, they are a reflection of the society, inner changing and personal growth.
