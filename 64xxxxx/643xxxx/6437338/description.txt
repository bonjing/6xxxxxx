Nufsoft Nature Illusion Studio Pro 3.61.3.89

Nature Illusion Studio allows you to apply various effects such as water, weather, or sound effects on any image to emulate various natural phenomena. With the combination of both visual and sound effects, you can produce very realistic animated nature scenes such as waterfalls, lakes, or seas. Finally you can save your creation as screensavers, executables, animated GIF's, or AVI's and share it to your friends.

Make photo live
A photo restricts your excitement from holidays spent at the seaside or near a waterfall to flat, two-dimensional images. Nature Illusion Studio lets you go beyond these physical restrictions and make a self-made animated scene, which can bring the original spirit and excitement of the holiday back to life.

Realistic natural effects
All visual effects have been recreated with accurate physics, so ripples on the water or subtle movements of the air look and behave just like they might in the physical life.

Share to others
The best thing is that you can share your excitement with others. You can create a screensaver and present it as a gift to your beloved or friend, publish it on your website and let your guests or customers download it for free.

Superb result
The end result is a superbly lifelike and atmospheric presentation that can be saved as a screensaver, a standalone executable, an AVI or animated GIF file and distributed to other people, who can admire your creation.
