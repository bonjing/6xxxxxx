Lust for Life is a 1977 album by Iggy Pop, his second solo release and his second collaboration with David Bowie, following The Idiot earlier in the year. As well as achieving critical success, it was Pop's most commercially popular album to date, and remains his highest-charting release in the UK. The title track gained further exposure two decades later when it was featured on the soundtrack of the film Trainspotting (1996).
