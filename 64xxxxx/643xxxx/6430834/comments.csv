No errors just not able to mount NTFS. Running Intel Mac Pro with Lion. Can go into prefs disable and enable check but that's it. No ntfs partitions populated and all the checkmarks on the right are grayed out. I can see the partition in Disk Utility and the partition works under an XP virtual machine."

Nice quality NTFS-writer easy to apply, and the torrent works fine.

Enter macmofo. I found it in SERIAL BOX 11-2011 with the Serial and did not use the keymaker."
