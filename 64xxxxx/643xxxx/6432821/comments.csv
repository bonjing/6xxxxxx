Everything uploaded by The.Buzzsaw for [Buzzsaw Tv] must be at the least slightly rare or hard to find, under-rated at time of release/debut, and recieve a average voted score between 9.0 and 10.0 from six hard to please Buzzsaw Tv critics and myself. A Televised show, Music Video or Movie that receives a 8.9 or lower is rejected and never mentioned again. I suggest watching Bullet, Blood In Blood Out, and all the Trailer Park Boys."
