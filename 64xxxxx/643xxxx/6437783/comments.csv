,annabelle31,2011-05-31T15:34Z,"Audio quality isn't all that great, perhaps due to overcompressing or using a crappy encoder.

I was looking forward to listening to this, but it's hard to concentrate with all the 's' and 't' sounds distorted.

A bit of a disappointment, but I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, as they say. Thanks anyway!"
,SON-of-ZORQ,2011-05-31T19:32Z,"I agree it's not top quality, though I haven't noticed anything I'd call distortion. It is, alas, the best I could find. My contribution is simply to divide it into parts. Trying to find the start of a story in a six hour long file on an mp3 player is too irritating."

Why Stereo on a woice recording?

Why so low sampling rate, that you canÂ´t listen to it at all?"
