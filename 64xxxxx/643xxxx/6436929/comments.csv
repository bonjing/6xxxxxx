,groove420,2011-06-01T02:19Z,"First off, I'd like to say thanks for these, I truly appreciate being able to get these in 1080i format.   
I regret to mention that I believe this up is flawed compared to the previous six.  When there is motion/panning the picture is not smooth, when there is fast motion, the picture becomes blocky/grainy.  The KMPlayer and MPC exhibit the same issue.
Your previous 6 ep's do not have this issue.
Anyone else notice what I'm describing?
Suggestions?"
,idrone42,2011-06-05T21:57Z,lol
,KaLaNco69,2011-06-07T14:45Z,"""groove420"" - Cheers for the info.

Probably difference is the release group, first 6 were ""CtrlHD"", this is ""ALANiS.""

None of these are my releases, I'm simply re-distributing them - Haven't even got around to watching half of them yet lol!

My question is, What happed to ""CtrlHD"" capping 1080i and encoding?

Episode 8 1080i is a different group again!? ""TrollHD""?, which I shall be uploading soon......"
