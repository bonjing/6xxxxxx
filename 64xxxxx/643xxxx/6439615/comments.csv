,Kamikaze2196,2011-08-17T00:11Z,"How come the crack does not work for me? I have coh, opposing fronts, and tales of valor. When i just hade opposing fronts and company of heroes at 2.301 it would work, at 2.602 it didnt work. So then I downloaded tales of valor and did a complete reinstall of coh and opposing fronts, patched to 2.500 then installed tales of valor. then updated to 2.602 and it still does not work. Everytime i load the game it says to insert my opposing fronts disc which has been mounted on my virtual drive. Then when I click continue it says wrong disc inserted. I tried mounting all, mounting the image one by one, nothing worked"

I FOUND A FIX ON THE OTHER TORRENT! I LOVE LSD!! 

0-LSD-0 at 2009-05-16 18:18 CET:
For those of you having trouble unlocking ALL of the factions, from the original Company of Heroes, and opposing fronts, like Saxondale was having, i've finally found a solution.

1. Uninstall EVERYTHING including save games etc. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS FOR IT TO WORK!

2. Install the Tales Of Valour game as normal, and apply the included crack.

3. Go here:http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor.shtml#CoH:%20Tales%20of%20Valor%20[ENGLISH]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image
And download the file archive.
Now extract it, and mount all three of them in this order.
COHOF
COHTOV
COH

4. Start up the game and click on the little padlock. Enter these serial keys.
COH original (1):1111-2222-3333-3444-dbf3
COH Opposing Fronts (2 & 3): 4825-03cf-668e-1765-fd43

And that's all. Good luck!"
,us01,2011-09-21T05:49Z,"Works!

Download all 3 games, have serials for each, then patch them all to latest 2.602., then use crack for tales of valor.

Sadly online doesn't work, i cant even create an account. But it work single player and maybe even lan.

I was thinking of buying COH, but now having tested it out once again, i wont, the AI is retarded, cheap, so thats that."
,SilentMajority,2011-10-05T01:17Z,"How exactly does it work? Installed original CoH without cracks, installed CoH OF again without cracks, patched from 2.100 to 2.500, installed ToV, patched to 2.602 and applied the 2.602 crack.

Result No cd error

I uninstalled everything (but not saved games), tried it again and it doesn't work!!!"
,Vegasbob,2011-12-24T03:00Z,"Ok this is how you have to do this. 

Install all 3 games in order with serials provided for that game from whoever you downloaded it from. Remember the serial #'s. 

Use patches 1 at a time to go from 2.500 up to 2.602, don't use any crack files on game before this yet. 

Once you have the game patched up to 2.602 THEN apply this crack file to game and start the game. 

Once you start the game it will ask you to verify the serial #'s and media for the first two editions of the game  

IMPORTANT!!!: You MUST mount the http://m0006.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_company_of_heroes_tales_of_valor.shtml#CoH:%20Tales%20of%20Valor%20[ENGLISH]%20No-DVD/Fixed%20Image image files WITH ALCOHOL 120. DO NOT USE DAEMON TOOLS! The disk protection still detects Daemon Tools running but I got it to work and authorize with both of the first two disks mounted on Alcohol 120. Once you mount the first image for CoH original that should unlock the first set of missions. Once you do it with the 2nd image for CoH:OF it should unlock the 2nd two sets of missions and the ones after that should be unlocked already from the install of ToV. 

Each time you start the game after this it will ask you to insert and validate the media for CoH:OF. You do NOT need to have that image mounted, just click continue and after a few seconds it should just goto the main menu screen and then you can play the game. 

I figured this out from looking around at the various different image downloads and older sets of instructions to get this game working. I'm glad I did because it saved me a 30 mile trip and digging thru a storage locker for my original disks to play this game again. :D 

Hope this helps others get the game working for them. "
,sderek01,2012-04-24T06:12Z,"Heres mini images for all three games if you want to update the game. Mount them with daemon tools or alcohol and the games will always boot up without cracks.
