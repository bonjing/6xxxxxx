Stone File Undelete 1.2.128-BEAN

an application that allows you to restore deleted files from NTFS disks.

Data/file is invaluable for you, especially when you lose an important file, photo, video or some other files by mis-delete. Stone File Undelete will help you to restore the files even after you have permanently deleted them!

It is very important to make sure that there is not any other application writes to the disk or partitions before you run Stone File Undelete to restore your files, because even a small file change may overwrite the file you want to restore. And for the same reason, please always restore files to another disk or partition. Do not recover files to the same partition they were located.
