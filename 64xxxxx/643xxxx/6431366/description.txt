Star Trek New Voyages/Phase II's conclusion to the two parter: Blood and Fire.

They may create them every 2 years it seems, but the episodes really aren't that bad to be free for us to watch.

I downloaded this episode from their own tracker and torrent. It was in the H.264 mp4 format which plays fine if you have your video setup correctly. But it's a pain in the ass if you don't. So I took it and converted it over to a nice avi file in XviD format (the average for TV RIPS/DVDRIP episodes) for those that don't want the H.264.
