In every age, science and technology have played an important role in advancing human civilization. From architecture to engineering, communication to transportation, humans have invented and developed extraordinary wonders. Architecture is a key element of every culture. From the earliest huts, humans have been building a variety of structures in which to live, work, and play. Sometimes we take our buildings for granted, but architecture impacts both the functionality and aesthetics of our world. Engineering and art come together in architects' designs to create some of the most amazing and beautiful structures that have ever existed. 

In this book, we'll explore seven wonders of architecture, from the dizzying height of the Eiffel Tower, to the love-inspired Taj Mahal, to the heated competition that resulted in two of New York's tallest buildings. Along the way, we'll see advancements in materials, technology, and construction techniques, and we'll learn the stories of how and why these architectural achievements became important to the world.
