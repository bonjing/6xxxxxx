Audio format: OggVorbis VBR

Self-titled 3rd album from this Richmond, VA trio (keyboards, bass, samples, guitar, vocals). "From the beginning strains of chains dragging across a Co2 canister on 'Phantom Channel Crossing,' Labradford have infused the album with sampled and real time percussion traces, at times faintly delving into actual syncopation.
