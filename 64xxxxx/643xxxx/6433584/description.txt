Midnight. A siren echoes through the night sky.

A blood-red sea engulfs the land surrounding the village of Hanuda and drawn
towards the sound the villagers begin to wade into the water emerging soon after
as the Shibito - the living dead.

But there are ten survivors. At different times over the next three days they
will each suffer unspeakable terror; only by piecing together their experiences
can a reason for the nightmare be unearthed.

They will gain the ability to 'Sightjack' - to see through the eyes of others.
They will rely on instinct and fight to survive. But there will be no heroes.
There is no hope.

The Forbidden Siren is calling...
