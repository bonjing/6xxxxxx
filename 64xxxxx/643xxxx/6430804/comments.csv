,carlozone,2011-08-10T17:59Z,will not work on windows 7 ultimate! just brings the fc portables logo up  then says it's stopped working!
,Pueo,2011-08-12T21:59Z,"Under XP media edition SP3 it worked 2 times and now all that happens is the FC portables logo comes up then goes away without the app running. 

I have tried unpacking the zip again but same results. 

I like the portable but now I'm just open to suggestions"
,sk84uhlivin,2011-08-13T04:17Z,"This doesn't work to my knowledge. I clicked the .exe and it brings up the logo, but no program. Some people are saying to put the .exe into the Data folder, but then when launched, it just makes another Data folder within the data folder."
