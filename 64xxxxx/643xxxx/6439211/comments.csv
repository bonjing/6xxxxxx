I am a big fan of all your clear films...but i am sad to notice you are more or less gravitating to direct downloads only. to be frank all your recent releases on piratebay are crappy films. it sucks because some people like me have very slow connections and so can only torrent!

PS-Biutiful..only available on direct download...."
,coolaid88,2011-06-05T05:29Z,the audio does not seem to work! any one else have this problem??
,MsR1,2011-06-27T21:40Z,"Hey Kickass 
{:) also one of my all-time fave movies}

i've gotten some great d/loads from u already and tnx for this one.  it's just started d/loading but i'm sure the quality will be great.

Question:  what's the difference between direct d/loads & torrent d/loads...i'm still kinda new to this whole thing.  also how do you get subtitles externally for a d/load?

MsR"
,shmang,2011-07-06T07:44Z,"Thanks Mr Kick-ass, This is a great download.

And thanks to all those who are seeding, It took just 8 minutes to download.

If only all torrents where as good as this one"
