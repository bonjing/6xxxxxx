The movie starts with a couple of old dudes torturing a young hot girl. Then the movie develops in a story of a girl and a guy having to enter inside of the house of this two sickos. I won't spoil anything so don't worry. I'm here just to tell you, this is the most entertaining Argentinian Film ever. This film has a Tony Scott taste but mixed with Edgar Wright. Just pure style. An awesome style.
