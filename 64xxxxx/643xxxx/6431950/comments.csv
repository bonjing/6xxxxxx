,tavery80,2011-05-29T19:28Z,Rutroh...I'll upload 1980 next.
,clunkerBT,2011-05-30T02:51Z,"awesome!

what is the source of these, by the way?  personal scans, or the cover to cover drive, or ?"
,tavery80,2011-05-30T09:19Z,Cover to Cover drive
,LesbianCloud69,2011-05-30T20:06Z,Simply awesome.
,LesbianCloud69,2011-05-30T20:06Z,I have the C2C drive - How are you ripping them?
,tavery80,2011-05-31T02:10Z,"It was quite tedious.  You can only do one issue at a time.

1) Set-up a protocol to print to PDF file.
2) Covers are separate files within the file structure, so save them individually.
3) Save the actual magazine.
4) Assemble the PDF, magazine + covers, with Acrobat Pro.
5) Move on to next issue."
,tavery80,2011-05-31T02:20Z,"Say...anyone who has the C2C drive, is the pictorial of Charlize Theron missing from May of '99?  Any other missing pictorials?

Chances are, they didn't get digital rights secured for hers, and possibly others.  If I could get someone to scan those exact pages as decent jpgs, I'll insert them into that issue.

NOTE to anyone nice enough to scan them - use a sheet of black construction paper as a backing instead of the white top, to prevent bleed through of the next page."
,LesbianCloud69,2011-05-31T15:16Z,"I have every paper copy.
Tell me what you want and where to send it.
I'll scan it today."
,LesbianCloud69,2011-05-31T15:21Z,"Sorry for spam - I am missing on the C2C 

Pages 130-138.

I'll go to the safe and get the issue out."
,tavery80,2011-05-31T15:38Z,"Send the jpegs to:

nathanblandidge@yahoo.com

If possible, don't forget the black backing for bleed-thru prevention...thanks!"
,LesbianCloud69,2011-05-31T16:09Z,Done.
,chuckufarley,2011-06-01T23:58Z,"My head just exploded.
I didn't realize this was so much work for you tavery80... and LesbianCloud69's scanning missing pages... *boom*"
