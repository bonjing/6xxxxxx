,scottsasse,2011-06-27T00:52Z,"For me the first 25 minutes were SO BAD that I almost turned the movie off!! But it got better and so did the acting. I did still have trouble getting past the tattoos being his main ""disfigurement"" . In this day and age Hollywood has the capability to make an actor zombie ugly!! This movie could had been much better if only they had tried. In spite of all this I did still enjoy it and the plot was good. My ratings: A=7, V=9, Movie=5"
