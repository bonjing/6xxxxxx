About the Band: Itâ€™s funny really, that a band with so much talent would be called GoodLuck. Because itâ€™s not really luck thatâ€™s got these three musos to where they are â€“ igniting South African night skies with their jazzing beats- itâ€™s more like a blend of serious sums of talent, plenty of soul and a helluva lot of passion.  And their next plan? Taking over the dance floors of the world!
And theyâ€™re not far off. Because this band is seriousâ€¦ serious about being themselves, playing from the heart and having a good time. And thatâ€™s really why theyâ€™re here.  With a sound that blends electro beats with the distinctive sounds of sax, drums and keyboard, their music just makes you feel so good!

This is my first Torrent as it is the first time I have seen something that I have that is not yet on TPB. So let me know what you think or if you need anything else :) Also, Don't forget that if you like the Artist support them and buy the album, these guys deserve it :)

P.S. I have got some of the worst internet in the world. Have patience, I will seed for as long as it takes but it will never exceed about 20kbps upload from my side unfortunately. Good things come to those who wait....
