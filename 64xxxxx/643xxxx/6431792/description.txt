Deluxe three CD edition includes Directors Cut plus remastered versions of The Sensual
World and The Red Shoes. 2011 album from the British songstress. On Directors Cut, Kate
revisits a selection of tracks from her albums The Sensual World and The Red Shoes, a
process that presents a fascinating portrait of an artist in a constant state of evolution. She
has re-recorded some elements whilst keeping the best musical performances of each song
â€“ making it something of a directorâ€™s cut but in sound, not vision. All the lead vocals and
drums are new performances, some of the tracks featuring guests including Steve Gadd,
Danny Thompson and, on backing vocals, Mica Paris. Three songs have been completely rerecorded,
one of which is â€˜This Womanâ€™s Work.â€™

============================================

" For Some Years I Wanted to Revisit a Selection of Tracks from the Albums
' the Sensual World ' and ' the Red Shoes '.
Keeping the Best Original Performances from the Musicians but Stripping out the
Tracks,
Adding New Scenes and Textures before Sewing It All Back Together,
It Has Become Something of a Director's Cut but in Sound-Not Vision.
When It Come to Singing Those Songs Again, It Was like
Trying to Open a Door with the Wrong Shaped Key.
So I Changed the Key and the Door Began to Open ..."

The Red Shoes [Remastered]

 
http://leetleech.org/images/88777958682136542156.jpg

I always felt the sound of the original version of' 'the red shoes'
was a little edgy due to the digital equipment that we were using at the time.
Everyone was under pressure back then to work in the digital domain
as it promised so much with the lack of tape hiss and it's supposed clarity.

I remain a devoted lover of analog and was delighted to recently
come across the backup mixes of this album on 1/2" analogue tape.
It seemed like the perfect opportunity to make this truly remastered
version part of this collection.

Thats a good point you make..but i think you might find...Bjork,Madonna and Lady
Gaga..have all said in the past that Kate Bush was a big influence on their careers and thats
a great honour for Kate,it just goes to show what a fantastic artist she is and how original
her style was and is.Kates legacy to the music world will live on for many years to come and
im sure many young female artists will be influenced by her music and style for many years
too.......Kate is a legend ...
