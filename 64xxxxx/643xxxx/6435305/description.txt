Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  

music played during the commercial breaks.


NOTE: Doc Thompson in for Glenn Beck & Crew...


I always have a problem saying "Happy Memorial Day" due to the true purpose of the holiday.  So, to all of those that have served and given their all, as well as their families... thank you so very much.
