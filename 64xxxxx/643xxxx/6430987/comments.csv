You need an account, to play this..

""Thepiratebay"" stands for pirated games, so games, which also work without having the origin, e.g cracks or something else, but this is just a minecraft version, for which you will need an origin. account."
,Drkpl8,2011-06-12T17:41Z,"doesnt work, you need a account for it!"
,GLMC,2011-06-15T11:28Z,"click play offline!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

,SeasonOfMists,2011-06-16T03:31Z,It keeps crashing on me...
,crazy_horse1989,2011-06-16T18:56Z,"Well, I don't know why, but I got a virus from this version of minecraft. I love all the mods, the elevator, spc, planes and speedboat, but I managed to infect my computer with an ad.rotator and had to waste a couple of hours to scan all my files. Am I the only one that this sort of thing happened to?"
,GLMC,2011-06-18T08:53Z,you got a virus from this version or this torrent?
,crazy_horse1989,2011-06-19T15:46Z,"I think it was from Minecraft.jar, but yeah, from this torrent. And it's a shame, as I REALLY love these mods."
,harde1,2011-06-19T17:47Z,This is 1.4 if u dont have account
,GLMC,2011-06-20T09:45Z,if you want i can release a 1.6.6 after i virus scan it? do you want 1.6.6? with mods?
,crazy_horse1989,2011-06-20T14:13Z,"If I could've cleaned the infected files from the .jar, without having to delete the whole application, everything would've been roses. That would be awesome if you could release a clean version. Oh, and my antivirus was nod32 when it detected those ad.rotators."
,crazy_horse1989,2011-06-20T14:21Z,"Oh, and if you could throw some core mods in there, that would be awesome. Most important, SPC; I won't ask for planes, since I know that mod's a bitch to get it working."
