Fleeing a botched robbery, Harry(Robert Downey Jr) evades the police by ducking into a movie audition for a hardboiled film and impresses the producers with his emotional outpouring of regret about the robbery and the subsequent death of his accomplice. The producers think he is a method actor giving an audition, hire him for the lead role and fly him to Hollywood.
There, hes introduced to private investigator "Gay" Perry van Shrike (Val Kilmer), who is enlisted to help Harry prepare for his role in the movie.At a Hollywood party, Harry encounters his high school crush, Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan), whom Harry has known since childhood. They leave for Harrys apartment, but the budding romance is squashed when a drunken Harry accidentally sleeps with Harmonys friend instead.
While working with Perry, Harry stumbles into a conspiracy of kidnapping and murder involving a high profile heiress. Circumstantial crime scene evidence could incriminate Perry in the murder, and someone who knows Harrys habits seems intent upon framing Harry for the crime. At the same time, Harmony, who believes that Harry is really a detective, implores him to investigate the death of her sister; Harmony believes that her sister was murdered by someone trying to kill Harmony, but Perry insists it was suicide. As events related to both crimes escalate, Harry, Perry and Harmony team up to investigate.
