Like My Favorite Highway and Friday Night Boys, the Downtown Fiction are a melodic emo-pop band hailing from the suburban outskirts of Washington, D.C. Formed during the summer of 2008 in Fairfax, Virginia, the band originally consisted of high-school students Cameron Leahy and Eric Jones. Classmate David Pavluk joined several months later, handling bass duties and singing backup for frontman Leahy. A healthy following on MySpace helped the boys land a contract with Photo Finish Records in 2009, and the band spent the latter half of that year working on new music. By early 2010, theyd made their iTunes debut with Best I Never Had, an introductory EP that helped them land several summer tours, including the Bamboozle Road Show and the Vans Warped Tour. A second release, The Double E.P., arrived later that year, followed in 2011 by the full-length Let's Be Animals.
