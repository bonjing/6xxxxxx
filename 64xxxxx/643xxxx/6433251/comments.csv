Fuking 20 mins into movie the audio mutes with the cinavia code 3 and is no different to the other torrents of this film on PB!"
,moshster,2011-05-30T10:31Z,"Cinavia cannot be defeated.  It's an audio watermark that is on ALL versions of this movie, theatrical, DVD, DB, PPV, broadtcast TV, any format that carries the movies audio will have Cinavia.  Possibly foreign language, non English, may be Cinavia free."
,rsl87,2011-05-30T19:58Z,Hey moshster you seem to know alot about this cinavia bs.. will someone be able to upload this movie without the protection when it comes out on actual bluray? Or are we basically just screwed lol?
,moshster,2011-05-30T23:19Z,"@rsl87 - I think we're screwed with any movies that have sountracks with Cinavia audio watermark.  Until some clever person figures out how to filter out the Cinavia water from the audio I don't think there is a workaround.  I haven't had the time to analyze the Battle LA audio in waveform to see if the Cinavia is visible in the sample; after all they must either be using sub-sonics or frequencies above human hearing.  It might be possible to then filter out these frequencies.  A lot of effort though, easier to just view movie using a laptop with HDMI connection to surround sound processor."
,blusniffer,2011-05-31T02:31Z,"I've been using both the fat ps3 and now the slim version to watch BD's and hundreds of blurayrips for years and only had this cinavia warning twice in all that time.
It puzzles me as to why this protection is even used as it appears so rarely.
I know PB is free but saying it will play on a device when it won't pisses me off and is no better than a faker!"
,moshster,2011-05-31T08:24Z,"@blusniffer - Cinavia is a new DRM technology.  From 2010 onwards it has become mandatory for all new Bluray players.  It is now being adopted by movie studios so we will see more films using Cinavia going forwards.  It is even possible that Cinavia can be mixed into the audio of older movies, but this is unlikely because many older movies are already on DVD without Cinavia."
,ROKKERO,2011-05-31T17:01Z,cinavia kicks in around 20 min!!  good quality but you do lose the audio! 
,moshster,2011-05-31T20:18Z,Some movies it is 20 mins interval other it can be more frequent.  Also some movies it can stop playback completely; it depends on the player device and the status codes embedded in the Cinavia signals.
,blusniffer,2011-06-01T04:25Z,"According to sites (wiki,blu-ray.com etc) for a protection to be used less than 20 times in almost a year isn't much to fear.
Also Transfering movies to BD is an expensive business so i doubt universal and the other big guns will spend tens of millions re-printing old movies with a protection watermark!"

The studios have been waiting for the DVD/Bluray standards bodies to mandate Cinavia on the hardware.  Now that this has been mandated, the studios will use Cinavia.

The process of adding Cinavia is actually very cost effective and easy.  All movies are remixed when transferred to consumer video formats because the dynamic range of the audio for a theater is different to that of the average home.  During this remix process Cinavia can be added without any extra cost or time.

In time it is possible that Cinavia might be added to surround sound processors which means that even if the media player does not have Cinavia, the surround sound processor could enforce the DRM.  My advice, don't give up your current sourround sound processor just yet.

My PS3 was my preferred media player in my home theater, but now it's a dual core Atom based Acer Aspire 3700 with nVidia GPU connected via HDMI to my Onkyo THX surround processor.  Now I find that the PS3 is very noisy compared to the almost slient Acer Aspire and the Windows Media Center user interface is much nicer :)"
,Gaz1882,2011-06-01T15:14Z,"@Moshster, Thanks for the info, although there is a cracking rip of The Green Hornet on here. It's been made ready for the PS3, and worked a treat, so hopefully these guys know ways round Cinavia already."
,blusniffer,2011-06-03T08:45Z,"I'll stick to the opinion that since cinavia was created in 09, given the mandatory insertion into bd players in Q1 10 with only 3 blu ray releases that year and 3 so far in 2011 having the watermark inserted, i'll take my chances!"
,User897,2011-06-04T08:27Z,"This is GROSSLY OUT OF SYNC when converted to DVD via ConvertXtoDVD.

THANKS FOR THE WASTE.

Looks like I'll have to stick to the damn R5 I already have."
,xyreaux,2011-08-19T06:33Z,"In order to bypass a Cinavia watermark, all you have to do is change your audio settings from HDMI to the next setting.  Your PS3 will still use your HDMI like always, but it will disable the Cinavia feature and keep it from muting the audio.  It's such a huge fail when you know how to get around it."
