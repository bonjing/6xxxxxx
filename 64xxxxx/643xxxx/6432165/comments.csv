,mkmacabre,2011-05-30T00:31Z,Is this actually episode 8?
,midurix,2011-06-09T14:30Z,"yes, this is episode 8. Season 1 goes from 1 to 10, but for some reason online it is only 1 to 9, which is wrong, then season 2 episode 1 online is actually the last episode of season 1, so it messes everything up. Instead of rectifying the problem, they just keep uploading with the wrong episode number."
,mkmacabre,2011-06-12T09:13Z,"So basically, we are missing episodes 7 and 10 from S2!?!

Season 2

02x01 - Shrunken Head
02x02 - Rock Star Embalmer
02x03 - 3 Little Piggies
02x04 - Rock Star Embalmer
02x05 - Romancing the Bone
02x06 - Edison's Monstrous Creation
02x07 - The Horaffe
02x08 - Piece of Mind
02x09 - Hedgehog Homolog
02x10 - Love Stones"
,mkmacabre,2011-06-12T09:17Z,NB: I believe 02x02 should be entitled - RAISING THE DEAD.
