I hope you enjoy the songs as much as I do. Avenged Sevenfold is the best band I've heard in a great while. If you like the songs don't forget to buy the album and if they tour in your area I HIGHLY recommend going. They have an amazing live show! I've been a loyal fan for 6 years now and I'm hoping that some of you will be too. Don't forget to comment with thoughts or questions about the upload and if you have requests for future uploads I'll do my best to satisfy them. Thanks for stopping by!"

,biggkat97,2011-08-20T22:22Z,if we can get discography free from TPB the why would we BUY the album 
,wrlitzr,2011-09-15T22:24Z,"@biggkat97 you make a good point, but even though I can get just about any form of media for free I still go buy official copies if it's something I like. I'm not saying everyone has to do that, merely suggesting it for your consideration. "
