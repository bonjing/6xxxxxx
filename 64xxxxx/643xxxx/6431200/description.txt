Alestorm - Back Through Time LIMITED EDITION CD 2011-DAA_INT


The Seven Seas were obviously not expansive enough for Captain Chris Bowes and his crew, as their quest for booty takes them Back Through Time. Catchy melodies and fanfare call out from the shipâ€™s stern, along with a number of other authentic instruments including violins, accordions and diverse horns. To add rampage to the mix, metal riffs attack on deck to complete this Fiddlerâ€™s Green of irresistible singalong anthems and party songs. If the old wives tale holds true and the third album decides a bandâ€™s fate, Alestorm can look forward to glorious and rumguzzling times ahead.
