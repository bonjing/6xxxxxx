,slunk76,2011-05-31T06:35Z,Will this version play on PS3?
,slunk76,2011-05-31T06:39Z,Will this work on ps3?
,t_amante,2011-06-01T00:16Z,"Why dont you people who keep asking if this will play on your ps3 read a little bit about cinavia protection? If you do so, you'll know that it's a sound in the movie itself that trigger the cinavia. So, it doesn't change anything from one rip to another. If one have cinavia, they will all have. 
So, it WONT play on your ps3. "

,S.Knight,2011-06-15T08:40Z,"Don't worry about cinavia... Just stream from your PC to your PS3 to your TV via  a network and your good... If you do not own a PS3 and a PC... Too damn bad. PS3 makes for easy streaming to TVs in your home. 

Good Upload! Thanks."
,BK666BK,2011-06-15T21:42Z,"Thanks, fastest download Ive seen out of them all and the only one with english lang/sub. Downloading now, will seed after."
,Christofer_Lynch,2011-06-15T23:47Z,"I know that there's ways to find subtitles and things for movies but I was wondering since most uploaders don't put hard-copy subtitles into movies (for like scene transitions and foreign languages which would normally put in there standard anyways).

So the question is, either can you upload a movie with foreign subtitles hard-copied, or can you download subtitles from a site that only has the foreign parts translated, and not every single other word in the movie that's English?"

,snowbirds,2011-08-06T04:43Z,"What no one seems to notice in the comments, and what FXG fails to disclose, is that the top and bottom of the movie have been cropped off.  

This is an incomplete screen of the movie.  That is why everything looks like a fucking close-up...

Jeez, am I the only one who notices this shit???

,Encal,2011-08-21T23:39Z,"Thanks! Movies distributed by FXG always have my preference, because of the English subtitles!"

not going to assess this flick. It's like a 3D shooting war game. Everything inside is shoot, shoot, shoot! Anyone fond of wargame will certainly find the training exercise. :)"
,DACreech,2012-03-12T05:20Z,"A:9 V:9 M:7   I think the Cameraman must have the shakes or something!  Camera seems to constantly move which distracts from the movie.

Thanks for the upload!"
,benenya,2012-05-19T07:30Z,"@ t_amante
Don't be such a fucking douche. This copy works on PS3 just fine. If YOU did any real reading, YOU would know that cinavia is predominantly on Blue ray and digital copies not a DVD rip. If people want to ask then let them ask. don't be a CUNT. Get out of your mother's basement and do something productive. "
