The film lampoons the legitimate documentary Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed With Madonna outside the United States and Canada). In the original, pop superstar Madonna allowed cameras to follow her around for a no-holds-barred peek into her life during her Blond Ambition Tour. In this spoof, Brown plays Medusa, a controlling, hyper-sexual blonde bombshell who has allowed a documentary crew to follow her on her "Blonde Leading the Blonde Tour."

The film, about one hour long and originally produced as a Showtime television special, goes to great pains to recreate costumes, sets and situations that occurred in the original documentary.

In an interview with celebrity columnist Michael Musto of the Village Voice, Brown recalled how Madonna first reacted when saw the film:

At first I heard she really liked it. Then I heard she didn't like the scene where I rolled around on my dog's grave. She'd rolled around on her mother's â€” like that wasn't offensive enough? Then she didn't like the scene with the dancers suing me, because that really happened to her." â€ 

Shortly after seeing the film, Madonna sent over a half-finished bottle of warm champagne as a dubious gift, to salute Brown's deadpan impersonation. Brown's reaction upon receiving the gift was surprising:

It was really expensive champagne, but it had Madonna spit in it! 

According to Brown, she drank the bottle.
