please do not honor his memory by uploading
files with corrupt audio tracks.

the audio track is way off (desynced)  and full of pops"

,rigorkrad,2011-06-01T00:50Z,i tried it with both my pc or mac and i got the same results. maybe i am in america and its the 25 fps that s causing me problems?  and when you mix 25 fps video with a mp3 (which you are supposed to use aac) i always seem to have problems playing the stream back and keeping it in sync. for me muxing mp3 and any kind of video always causes the video to be descynced.
,fewgtg,2011-06-01T09:20Z,Maybe the problem is in the player you're using. Try VLC
