NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Hangover 2

Ok here we go with our version of hangover 2 and what a nightmare it was,but all good in 

the end so we think anyways lol.

Right first of the main body of the video is from a nice 720p cam and was dam good but had 

lots of camera movement and missing a few seconds between change overs,no more than a few 

secs at a time.

Now for them secs,instead of leaving them out ,we've replaced them with cinedubs video all 

29secs in total.

Right work done ....well firstly we needed to cut the 720p into 11 pieces and rotate,crop 

and resize each part differently aswell as the normal contrast,brightness,sharpness 

etc....

But by doing this the AR was off on some parts and bang on with others,so we've gone with 

a AR which is pretty decent for all parts.

Also after doing that we then needed to cut cinedubs video for the missing scenes and 

resize it to match the same AR and video stats as the rest so we could append them 

together..

Audio is some sweet line which we synced and for the cinedub parts we used epics audio as 

it was already synced so.

Anyway have to say it came out dam nice considering the source so enjoy this one funny as 

fook film
