,spifkitten99,2011-06-09T10:57Z,"Audio is out of sync.

Encoding is poorly done.

There is no excuse for that. It's really too bad, because the audio is actually very good, but just out of sync, and the color and contrast is actually quite good for a cam.

But some idiot messed it up, when encoding it.

It makes no sense. How hard can it be? The fact that it's a cam, means you'll have poor quality picture and audio. It does not mean you should do a poor job of encoding it. There is NEVER an excuse for audio to end up out of sync, and never an excuse to encode it so poorly. Jerky motion and at some times flickering as if deinterlaced with the wrong field order."
