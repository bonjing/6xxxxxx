The Cay also known as the Quay is a children\\\\\\\'s novel written by Theodore Taylor. The Cay, Taylor\\\\\\\'s fictionalized account of the boy on the raft, took only 3 weeks to complete, and has become perhaps the most beloved of his young adult fiction novels. It has seen worldwide sales in the millions. Taylor based the character of the boy in his book on a childhood playmate. The novel was published in 1969 and dedicated to Martin Luther King, Jr. The story is primarily about the relationship between Phillip and Timothy, and Phillipâ€™s efforts for survival on the cay. In the opening chapters of the book, the main characters display significant difficulty in being able to tolerate and work with the other, partly because of young white Phillip\\\\\\\'s racial prejudice against the elderly black Timothy. The two characters learn to overcome their disdain for the other, and develop strong bonds of friendship by the end of the novel. However, at the end of the book, Timothy dies while protecting Phillip.

The book was adapted as a one-hour TV drama in 1974 with Alfred Lutter III as Phillip, James Earl Jones as Timothy, and Gretchen Corbett as Phillip\\\\\\\'s mother
