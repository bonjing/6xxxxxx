,frisbe,2011-06-02T08:17Z,Getting the error - No input file specified when clicking download. If you use the magnet link it brings up 0 files.
,micknil,2011-06-02T12:11Z,Getting the same message as fribe
,spellweaver,2011-06-02T19:04Z,"I don't know why it's showing 5 seeders, I removed the torrent yesterday after TPB disallowed it (I don't know why).
If I could share these, there are 30 dvds all retail and no subs.

I made the torrent using utorrent, and seeded straight away, I then tried 3 times to upload it to TPB, each time it kept saying a different error, last attempt it said torrent was already being uploaded by another user, so I deleted mine. 

If it's a series requested, and you want the full amount (all dvds) I could have another go and possibly rename it.

,micknil,2011-06-02T19:46Z,Yes we want it!
,spellweaver,2011-06-02T21:40Z,"ok micknil, just as soon as my latest uploads are up, i'll put the first 5 discs up, look for title OFAH, gonna see if I can upload them that way.
Pity my HDD isn't big enough to put the whole 30 dvds on and upload, but patients is a virtue, they will be coming next, should be by the weekend.

,spellweaver,2011-06-05T09:30Z,"For all you people waiting patiently for this tv series, I am at present unable to upload to the Piratebay.
If any of you have access to Demonoid, I have started putting them up there, so as not to confuse the two sites, I'll wait until demonoid have got the the first batch before I put them up here...that way hopefully both sites will get 100%.
Sorry about this (not my fault), but please be patient, they will come....all 30 dvds.

Regards
Mike"
