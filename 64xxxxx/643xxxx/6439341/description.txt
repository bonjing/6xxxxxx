Uploading this classic british comedy, if these go well, and people want the whole 30 disc collection, I will gladly put them up, otherwise, I'll not share anymore of these, instead I'll share something else.

All comments are welcome, good or bad, I just ask people to refrain from abusive language, it's very soul-destroying and disheartening.  Remember, we take time and put in the effort to share these, if you don't like them, don't take them.

As a member of the Films_UK team, I am sharing the whole dvd, nothing removed and they are all ripped using dvdfab.

Hope you enjoy them, please seed as soon as you can...for as long as you can.
