At a minimum it will include the melody line in either treble or bass clef and chord names.  I have seen fake or 'real' books with do include treble and bass clef parts. 
Note that the chord names will usually be an interpretation by the transcriber (unless written by the original composer) of the melodic structure within a bar of the combined notes played by the instruments and could be based on a particular performance, especially in jazz arrangements since free interpretation and improvisation common within a piece.
