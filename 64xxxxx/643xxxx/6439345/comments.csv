It's a very B movie"
,rtghrtyzx,2011-06-02T18:10Z,The leading characters are based on Leela and Amy Wong. A shame they left out bender....

A/V are fine.

Movie is pretty bad, watchable though. When the main actor is a stunt woman by trade, you know what to expect."

,gillcash,2011-07-01T22:31Z,"So very sad. Facts all screwed up...
Scene supposedly happening in Antarctic - but talking about polar bears? And Baffin Island?? That's in the Arctic! Geez!
Watched about 15 minutes and couldn't watch anymore. A scene where they have to practice dancing for a strip club? Really?
Do NOT waste your time on this mov. (I can't even call it a movie!)"
,jpdeveau0,2011-08-22T05:28Z,Terrible movie. Couldn't even afford to film with a real helicopter .. its CG. lol. Graphics bad. Story bad. Acting lame. Accents terribly fake. Bad. Bad. Bad.
