Engelbert Humperdinck - Greatest love songs

Anyone can merely sing a love song. But it takes audacity and fearless bravado -- and the sterling pipes to deliver them -- to turn a mere three-minute paean to l'mour into something approaching operatic pop aria, which is what former rock 'n' roller Gerry Dorsey turned international pop superstar Engelbert Humperdinck has done with remarkable consistency since the mid-60's. This anthology deftly underscores the point, kicking off with his breakthrough "Release Me" (the record that broke The Beatles string of #1 records in '67), then ranging across another eleven emblematic tracks from his early successes with the Parrot label. His powerful baritone occasionally tips his longtime admiration of Elvis, its deceptively effortless phrasing rooted in Humperdinck's own first instrument, the saxophone. Spiced with Latin rhythmic touches ("Take My Heart") and drama Italiano "Love Me With All of Your heart," A Man Without Love," Rota's love theme from Romeo and Juliet, ) these are the templates for the Big E's enduring romantic oeuvre.--
