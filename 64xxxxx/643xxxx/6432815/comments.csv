,SilenceWillFall,2011-06-14T23:38Z,"Thank you so much, this rip works perfectly! All you have do is be patient with the uninstaller (which actually only takes about 10 mins, so it's really not that bad!)
Slight glitch with the classical music but hey it works. Thank you Kaos "

However my WASD keys don't work and whenever i try to reset them and hit W or A my keyboard enters as 6 or 7 or 8 or 9. I'm sure this is computer doing this though, NOT the torrent. anybody have any ideas???"

,crazy_pickle,2011-07-15T06:21Z,Can anyone explain to me why the installer is reading decoding for more than an hour straight?
,crazy_pickle,2011-07-15T06:25Z,Can anyone tell me why this thing is saying Decoding for over an hour?
,JRJ-000,2011-07-16T00:38Z,Did you try both ways installing it?  You can unrar it or use KaOs's installer. I unrared first and click unpack. Had no problems.
,GRUMPYPA,2011-07-20T09:11Z,Thanks again for another great. CHEERS!!!!
,Vediovis,2011-07-20T23:19Z,"used the installer, opened game.exe. , got valVe intro then it stops with error:

Cannot find

,unknowndivincity,2011-07-25T14:13Z,"thx man dis totally works !!!!!
"
,Scribblur,2011-07-26T01:18Z,"I used your installer and everything went fine I thought, I went into the folder and found only one .exe with the Portal2 logo, but when I click on it I get the Valve screen (excited...) then the Powered By ...(oh shit its legit...) then I almost ripped my cheeks I smiled so wide as the title screen came up with Portal 2...then it just shuts down and sends me back to my regular screen! Please help me, I am a nooB as i have seen it put and am admittedly clueless in what to do next, any assistance would be amazing and appreciated.Thanks."
,Scribblur,2011-07-26T04:02Z,"ha, I just keep refreshing hoping somebody has posted a reply.maybe tomorrow..."
,JRJ-000,2011-07-26T22:03Z,Did you try unraring and installing it?
,sazr,2011-07-26T23:06Z,"@Scribblur theres a number of reasons it may not have worked, did you only have a portal2 exe and no other files? did it takes ages to rebuild or just a few seconds?
if i remember right this game fully decompressed  was about 8 or 9gig do you have enough space? probbly needs a gig for decompression anyway do you have that? do you meet the system requirements? is your antivirus over sensitive and deleting something it shouldnt be wile installing? or like JRJ-000 said did you try unraring it yourself rather than using the installer and double clicking ~unpack~.bat?"
,Scribblur,2011-07-26T23:45Z,"So I tried installing it both ways, it took a while to unpack everything, it has a bunch of other files and folders in the Portal 2 folder, I have disabled my security settings during install but it all comes to the same...once its installed i open the folder, see the exe application with the little portal logo, then after a second or three on the Portal 2 title screen it shuts down . i have looked around for other torrents but this one seems the best I just can't get it started."
,Scribblur,2011-07-26T23:48Z,"also i do meet system requirements and have plenty of memory so I just don't get it. I had similar issues with Portal 1 and solved them by completely uninstalling everything and downloading the whole torrent again and installing manually, so I am going to try that again just to see. thanks for answering and trying to help guys"
,Scribblur,2011-07-27T01:10Z,"okay so the full delete,download again, manually install also failed to resolve issue. Apparently the game just doesn't like me, and I strongly sense Glaados is behind it all, nothing else makes sense.oh well."

I have noticed that after it is completely done installing and I press a key to continue as prompted, the text ""batch file not found"" will briefly appear before the unpacking box closes.

,SekogashNaVrvot,2011-09-06T03:28Z,"i have some trouble with the game, it has instaled and all but my screen says: input not support.
i think this is because it is set on high resolution, though i have a 16' screen so it doesn't support more than 1024x768...
does anyone know of a way how can i change the resolution of the game without turning it on, or any other possible problem?"
,MYKEL100,2011-09-22T22:12Z,When I ran the game I got a warning from my security saying Process dec2.exe as been halted because it attempted to hijack a running process. The address of dec2.exe is in the portal2 folder in the main folder but is invisible and I dont mean hidden. Ive never had security issues with kaOs stuff before other than the FPs in the launcher but this is another matter alltogether. I cant find any mention of dec2.exe anywhere so presume its getting past most security. The game runs fine but I'd be wary because processes that hijack legit ones wont show in your task manager and someone as gone through the trouble to hide it very well.

,publicstaticvoid80,2012-06-13T18:53Z,"DO  NOT DOWNLOAD THIS 

The sound doesn't work! Or at least most of it. The only audio that works is the blue robot's voice at the beginning. Nothing else. Game runs fine but without sound it's completely useless. 

The install size is about 400MB smaller than it's supposed to be. Did you remove all the sounds from this? If so, WHY?! For 400 frickin' megs you gutted the game? What's the point if there's no sound?"
,publicstaticvoid80,2012-06-13T19:40Z,"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
DISREGARD ABOVE COMMENT, IT WORKS

So it turns out that you absolutely must use the provided Installer.exe and you absolutely must leave the default install location as it is, because otherwise you'll get the missing sound problem. Why you're given the option do it differently is beyond me, but at least it works now. Also, make sure you let the decoder run its course, even if it looks like it's not doing anything (though it should be obvious since it eats up lots of CPU).

As for stability I haven't played it long enough to have it crash yet, will post if it does."
,19dragonz,2012-06-16T04:59Z,Is it working fine?
