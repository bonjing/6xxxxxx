MBR Regenerator v3.9.1 - The Professional Activation Fix Tool

MBR Regenerator is a tool to solve several problems with activation
Multiple loaders, and patches on the system, prevent programs like loader work, leaving messages, not the original Windows constantly appearing
And this program does not replace the function of a loader, or similar, it is not an activator, only clean the system for the installation of a new activation method ...

- Key Features
-> The Master Boot Record (MBR), is restored to its original state, preventing any loader inject slic and cause conflicts with other programs, preventing the proper activation
-> The system is reset, a new trial key compatible is installed, then return untouched on the system32
-> Loaders who inject SLIC will be permanently deleted, allowing a clean install of another loader (note with Slic Toolkit)
-> Archives WAT/KB971033 essential activation files, are restored completely to the original state, if you can not uninstall other methods of activations already installed
