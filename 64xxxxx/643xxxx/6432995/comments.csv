,benhenry6969,2011-06-21T17:23Z,I'm at 61.1% - Could someone please seed for a little bit so I could get to 100?  Even if it's just for a day or two - I'll leave my computer on as long as I need to.  Thanks a lot!
,Gomezz34,2011-06-23T02:11Z,"Just to let you all know, especially ddfuji, I have been uploading it.  Pirate Bay says 73 leechers, but Bittorrent says 417.  Plus, it is a pretty big file.  I am hoping that eventually some more people can get this file, then it won't take as long.  My upload speed is 150 kb/s, but for 417 people of a 10gb file, it could take a while.  But it will be worth it because the videos are good quality."
