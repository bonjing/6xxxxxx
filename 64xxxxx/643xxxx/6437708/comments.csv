,killy69,2011-06-01T06:00Z,do not recommend. this video has bugs 
,richardpa,2011-06-01T14:24Z,"Decent DVDRip and a steady download... 
A/8 
V/9 
The audio is slightly out of sync but I used VLC at +0.100âs ( the setting +0.200âs looked ok as well) and that brought the audio back in line, apart from that the rest of the movie is fine...       
Many Thanx to ExtraTorrent for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)
5 files in torrent:"
,grathiam,2011-06-01T14:29Z,"Thanks to the uploader...best horror flick in years!!!
Excellent copy.
The very minor audio sync problem is hardly worth correcting in VLC."
,tyghjd,2011-06-01T20:29Z,"Why the fuck dont the lazy uploaders add some subs!?!?!?

Instead thousands of users has to search around for them.. Fuuuuck.."
,rtghrtyzx,2011-06-01T22:10Z,Why dont cheap leechers instead of ........you get it. Have I seen this movie before? Its sounds familar.
,Frice,2011-06-01T22:53Z,"""Also, if anyone else was wondering, apparently there aren't supposed to be any subtitles. You're supposed to see things from the protagonists' perspective. (They don't get subtitles, so neither do you.) It's still pretty easy to figure out what's going on, though. ""

Called post-modernism, where you see the story through the eyes of an individual rather than through a traditional story-teller setting.

Oh and stfu about the subs already, the above quote confirms it is part of the movies style to omit subtitles, try reading emotions / cinematic cues.

Sounds like alot of movie nubs complaining though, because they are just that, nubs."
,guitarman696,2011-06-02T22:42Z,wont play audio at all on ps3
,useitright,2011-06-03T19:57Z,"I would like to say thank you, and that I have never had a problem with any of your files.  Keep up the good work."
,beerman100,2011-06-04T10:12Z,Same here. No audio when played thru ps3. Thanks anyway.
,parasites,2011-06-06T22:40Z,This played fine with VLC. But when I burned it to DVD it was way out of sync. Anyone know how to fix this. Thanks for the up Sam.
,rubak48,2011-06-20T21:01Z,nice
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-06-22T20:27Z,here are Romanian subtitles [ Subtitrarea in Romana ] :                                                    http://subscene.com/romanian/The-Shrine/subtitle-450534.aspx
,owenpie,2011-07-11T05:41Z,@penfold22 --- THANK-YOU! I was wondering if there were supposed to be subtitles but understand the director's intentions.

Great horror flick.  Unpredictable, well written."
,fuzz407,2011-08-21T00:55Z,not a bad flick. Just make sure you do the audio resynchronisation compensation fix for VLC player to sync the audio to the video
,Mat2001uk,2012-02-01T01:06Z,"Thanks richardpa, I was going to point that out as well."
,RichiiJm14,2012-04-30T03:02Z,Scary i guess. ... hope my cousin loves it!
