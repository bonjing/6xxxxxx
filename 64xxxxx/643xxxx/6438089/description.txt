======= DESCRIPTION ==========================================
The date is January 1, 2001, and you're in charge of things.
That's right you get to run your own state however you'd like, 
trying to build a powerful land for the future. The 3rd 
Millennium presupposes that the world will be divided into 
five massive countries and 31 states. See if you can pass 
social reforms through government, run for grander offices, 
create new taxes, hold summits, and much more.

====== NOTE ==================================================
I've only been able to run this game in a simulator running
Windows 95. Windows 95 will NOT work!
