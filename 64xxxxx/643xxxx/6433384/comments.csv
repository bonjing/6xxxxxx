,Evilution,2011-05-30T10:33Z,"metrOjedi: Whine about a new torrent being slower to download than you can upload much? current seed/leech ratio is 3/10, im uploading at 3.5+ MB/s, it was noway near as fast to download, do we all have any reason to whine when we get the show outside of USA this fast? I know i donÂ´t!"
,sanzhey,2011-05-30T11:14Z,Thanks eztv for uploading this great show and thank you all for seeding n i promise to seed as long as i can too. Cheers.

,krozar,2011-05-30T15:06Z,Reminder: never download an [eztv] torrent that isn't ULd by eztv. Someone is trying to get fakes here on TPB.
,Chesterton,2011-05-30T15:16Z,"Many thanks for uploading, but just a warning:

This has the end titles cut off. All the previous episodes I've downloaded have had the titles intact.
Sounds trivial, but it really is jarring, the loss of the closing music.

Also, one of the previous posters is correct: the audio sync is a bit dodgy.

Still grateful for the up, though!

,PingPang,2011-05-30T15:28Z,"@Chesterton

Como siempre muchas gracias a eztv por compartir este gran trabajo.

,everbleed,2011-05-31T01:32Z,"Thanks for uploading. I have to agree with Chesterton about finding the lack of end credits a bit jarring. Love hearing that music at the end and just sitting back and letting the episode soak in for 20 seconds or so.

Minor gripe though. Great upload otherwise."
,Daggi_92,2011-05-31T04:56Z,"There, quiting now after 41 in ratio. I haven't seen it yet, but cant almost wait! Thanks eztv!"

,HippieMagic,2011-05-31T22:08Z,I haven't seen this one yet but I wanted to thank you for always being on time and always having a great quality torrent.  I have downloaded every episode from you and even went out and purchased the books as a result of this show.  I just wanted to say thank you since I have no access to HBO this is my only method of seeing the episodes.
