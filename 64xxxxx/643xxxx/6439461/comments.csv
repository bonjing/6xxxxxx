[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T14:56Z,"@sadhu: OK, 4 and 5 tomorrow."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T15:05Z,"@jamydoug: I would do Withnail but 21 grams was requested and encoded couple of months ago - so, it can't be done again. Remember, I had hard drive crash in March and 1TB of encodes have been gone. Maybe someone else has it and is willing to seed old torrent, but I can't remember what frame-size was it."

[V],DownTYU,2011-06-01T17:21Z,"@tintinintibet
If ur reading this
Bro, I've been seeding for 24 hrs now (took a five hr break)...
If you're downloading something else in the back, stop it and complete this one.
And if your bandwith is 2kbps maybe you shouldn't download movie files.

@jamydoug
21 grams is in 352p not 720p"
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-01T17:31Z,"MrSuperGeek has just upeed a new torrent,
If possible someone do the same with him.

I can't coz he may do the same to me."
,steeevo_j,2011-06-01T18:52Z,"Oh man, Cherry 2000, classic SciFi & my favourite Melanie Griffith movie!

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T19:24Z,"Thanks folks!

@steeevo_j: Azrielle reminded me this morning asking for that movie on some other thread. I  said ""I remember watching it, but can't recall was it good or not""... Ahem, searched but DVD cannot be found anywhere (these were times of VHS) - but, I've found DVDrip and sent links to azrielle's e-mail. If you want 700MB super-fast MU  links, drop me a mail on address above, because this is tiny tawny plain re-encode."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-01T20:34Z,"Thanks for Angel Beats, Endgame, and Cherry Re-enc."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T21:49Z,"@DownTYU: I understand your frustration, I caught myself thinking ""Why? He would never finish"" but then I realize few things: people are never born at place of their choice, he/she already picked my torrent because - it's smallest out there and - I remember, very often, myself back in 1999. when I bought first modem and dial-up line and needed a week for download of some short clip my friends and me exchanged from time to time. Not so long ago, just seven years back I needed frikkin seven days"" for one movie, still on that 2.4 kB/s dial-up.

Now, we, I, can help to people less fortunate then us."
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-01T21:53Z,"@tintinibet

I will seed again tomorrow.

Go for COMBO 500/UL 750 scheme if possible."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T21:55Z,"@tintinintibet: I would seed, very very slow, from nephew's line, but you would get your movie. Be patient."
,believenu,2011-06-01T22:15Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing. Scooby dooby doo to you! the children (mee too)say thanks. "
[V],DownTYU,2011-06-01T23:21Z,"@tintinintibet

Seeding till the world ends :)

I'll give breaks from time to time...
Don't worry I'll be back"

Spelling corrected, sorry!!!

Pyaar se!!"
,froglog,2011-06-01T23:55Z,Thank you for Angel Beats & Cherry 2000
,silveroakleaf,2011-06-02T03:29Z,"As always, thank you!  Going to try out Scooby Doo.  Sorry, I HAD to adblock the blob picture.

Got a question, how many torrents do you keep going (seeding) at any one time?"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T08:50Z,"@silveroakleaf: Was

and now is - four movies. I don't have money, that server (as in pictures) cost 35 bucks per month.

TV shows are on different server with TWO slots only, and that forces 48h rotation of daily TV packs."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T11:45Z,"Just  a thought Jon and me pondered last month:

idea that 20 people commit silly 2 bucks per month and SAVE yourself troubles and LOT of their own money chipping in for dedicated TV shows server where TV packs sit for a month and could be seeded fast as hell all month long. 

We would eliminate worries of slow people completely and I am sure that each member of our small community will benefit from it. As you know, I can't even eat properly with my 0.76 Euro per day and four mouths to feed."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-02T15:38Z,"@twentyforty
RE: dedicated (private?) video server idea
Was wondering when you would do something similar (or migrate from tpb to something like 1337 or kickass).
Can't contribute until July time frame.  Otherwise willing."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-02T16:31Z,"No, not private, in fact I would rather avoid any direct involvement. One guy simply step up, must own PayPal - and collect donations from supporters, then pay provider as I instruct.

... and anybody do have 2 fucking bucks, even myself, and it costs less than anyone give from home by seeding.
