       Based on the franchise that has sold more than two million copies   
       and won the hearts of gamers worldwide, Patrician IV will           
       challenge players to rise up the merchant ranks to become the       
       leader of a burgeoning shipping empire during the late Middle Age   
       in Northern Europe - a time where success in trade could be as      
       rewarding and influential as the power bestowed by noble birth,     
       religious position or political clout. Patrician IV's authentic     
       supply and demand-based trading system allows players to grow       
       their business and head out to the high seas to form trading        
       routes with other Hanseatic cities negotiating better prices for    
       the buying and selling of goods. Sea battles keep the pace          
       action-backed, as players combat pirates and enemy players.
