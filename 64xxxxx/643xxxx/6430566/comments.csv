,Fireskrit,2011-06-04T04:04Z,"Wow, no harm meant to the people seeding whilst still downloading this (like myself), but who the fuck do you think you are to download a file this big and not seed a fucking bit? About 4 people who have the file 100% and have uploaded what? Near 160mb you say? I'm at 68% and have uploaded 14gb worth. Stop being fucking selfish and help the others still trying to download this amazing anime. ffs"
,c674980,2011-06-04T14:42Z,"Fireskrit, it's not always that easy - I live in a country where we have DATA LIMITS - Not only do they count the downloads towards that, they count the UPLOADS. Exceed your limit and that's it - 64k for the rest of the month.
A big torrent like this really eats into your 50GB limit.
That being said, I always try to leave things up until I'm at least at 1:1 - even if I have to stop it and put it up again next month. Maybe I should make that 2:1 "
,c674980,2011-06-05T13:11Z,"Quality is OK and definitely in English - I just watched the first 10 Episodes.
I've watched most of it with subtitles, but this is definitely easier to concentrate on. Does lose some of the Japanese feel, though. The story is always changed slightly for us westerners."
,modernhacker,2011-06-18T18:20Z,excellent download speed 600kb/s i plan on seeding this for awhile when i get done downloading
,AGuyCalledGooby,2011-06-19T18:05Z,"Hey guys, kinda new here but as soon as I finish downloading this torrent, i will be seeding for a week. Bleach all the way! :D"
,modernhacker,2011-06-19T18:22Z,@Aguycalledgooby good thing other people are seeding i had to increase my uploading speed because barely anyone is seeding glad to hear you planning on seeding even if it is for a week it still helps
,malikideath8,2011-06-25T03:19Z,yo why is it not all avi some of them fron 10 are mkv and season 7 and 9 are mkv but all the others are avi why is that need to fix it if u can 
,Septitais,2011-06-25T15:39Z,"@malikideath8
Because the encoder thought its better this way. The vlc media player can play mkv files or just download some codecs for your current video player. Anyway, I have uploaded 850 Gb so far and after it reaches 1 TB, I'm going to upload a new torrent with better quality and the new 11th season included. I've noticed that there are 1 or 2 episodes damaged, so the more reason to reupload this torrent.
Thanks to all the active seeders =)"
,birdmanosr,2011-06-27T01:23Z,"I greatly appreciate the fact that you uploaded this. I love this series. But, what would make it better is if people would seed this."
,Asraz236,2011-07-02T14:05Z,hey awesome torrent!!! dudes i come to the seeding rescue i seed for 2 weeks at least once i am done :)
,lucasius7,2011-07-08T07:25Z,"Thanks Septitais for this awesome torrent. I'm @ 80% and have uploaded 32gb. Will seed for a very long time. Can't wait for season 11! Not into subs, so again thank you."
,Anmaddox,2011-07-11T09:41Z,"@c674980 Then you guys are stupid enough not to use onions or peer block. If you guys used that shit, you wouldn't have 2 worry bout being limited to how much u can download or upload. Fireskrit has a fucking point. If you have a torrent online that is this big, then you need to make sure that your computer or system is prepared to fucking handle seeding. If I have 2 wait weeks to download this torrent, then I will be pissed off."
,Anmaddox,2011-07-11T09:43Z,"@malikideath8 The reason some of these files are mkv and not avi is because mkv is a blue-ray file format. i usually find that the video quality on these files are better, but the audio is all over the place."
,Anmaddox,2011-07-11T09:52Z,"Come on guys. Could somebody please seed? It's telling me that I have 2 wait 20 weeks for the torrent to finish downloading, and I'm only torrenting seasons 4-10. Could somebody please help me out?"
,Klint0,2011-07-17T06:56Z,"Gonna be seeding for a bit. Just spent literally 50 hours downloading this thing. Seriously stupid, so in lack of others seeding I'll do my best xD"
,fbdrgn,2011-07-17T21:43Z,"your torrent sucks ass, especially around the time rukia is almost executed.. none of the files work all the way through, your a terrable person for putting these on the ionternet and i hope your computer blows up and leaves you lonely"
,Septitais,2011-07-17T23:47Z,"@fbdrgn
Works fine on me, just checked. Try using a different video player."
,WinerZ,2011-07-22T02:09Z,SEEEEEEDDDDD im like 50% there and there is almost no one seeding any more.
,Bemyfrnd,2011-07-22T05:08Z,Please seed Im stuck at 90.9%
,Bemyfrnd,2011-07-22T05:11Z,Awesome torrent +1 Please seed Im stuck at 90.9%
,Horseband,2011-07-24T06:20Z,"@Anmaddox Do you seriously think that PEERBLOCK is going to help mask your Download/Upload usage from your ISP (Internet Service Provider)? I am in awe that you could call him stupid and provide such a ridiculous statement after .

NO program on your computer can hide your download/upload usage. You are connecting to your ISP and everything you download or upload is going through them. There is no way around a ISP Download/Upload limit because your ISP keeps track of EVERYTHING that happens on your connection."
,Horseband,2011-07-25T05:35Z,"Video quality is all around good and the best I've seen online for Eng Dubbed Bleach. Video resolution/quality is different for each season and ranges from 480p to 720p (Season 9 being 720p and the best quality from what I've seen).

The quality of the video/audio overall is great for the size of this torrent. I suggest anyone who wants to watch Bleach in English download this torrent.

BTW, Don't listen to some of the idiots above, this torrent is basically flawless. All episode are the correct length and I have experienced no episodes cutting off or ""half working"". "
,Bemyfrnd,2011-07-27T09:55Z,Thanks for this torrent +1. i'm looking forward to season 11 to 15 please upload it :) 
,pirate_n7,2011-08-03T10:55Z,Please seed. The ratio of seeders to leechers is horrible. I only need seasons 9 and 10.
,gamer1997,2011-08-10T02:00Z,"someone please seed, getting a kick ass speed of 0.8 KB/S"
,rohan_ravan,2011-08-12T15:29Z,wow ... what a great torrent and not a single fuckin seeder !!
,persha,2011-08-23T08:21Z,"Good anime... not the best but still i enjoy watching it.
About seeders... a lot of people limit their upload speed and that's bad thing to do, share your download so others can download torrent faster. So far I uploaded 7 Gb in about 1 hour, even less than an hour, and will be seeding until I watch episodes 132-151... so leechers will at least get 25+ Kb/sec each, and for some, that's already a lot of speed. :) Don't be greedy, share your download! ^_^ "
,Bemyfrnd,2011-08-25T10:40Z,+1 awesome torrent i will seed it this month :)
,Bemyfrnd,2011-08-25T10:43Z,+1 awesome torrent i will seed it this month :D

,XxG0dsM1stake-_-xX,2011-10-04T23:56Z,"@septitais when do you expect to have the reupload uploaded? I'd much rather download it than waste my time downloading this one, especially when it could come out tomorrow or the next day. I'll seed to a ratio of 10 + as well!"
,DannyDemonic,2011-10-07T20:25Z,40 Hours into this download... And I've uploaded twice the file size. Seeding for as long as I can once this finally finishes. >.>
,humanxlemming,2011-10-08T06:40Z,"SEED how the hell can it be so hard to seed one torrent, I'm going to seed the hell out of this when it is done!"
,prionkor,2011-10-09T10:58Z,"If you are a low speed connection you can download smaller sized episodes form here http://www.animea.net/forums/showthread.php?t=45960&page=1 

Episode size 40MB to 70MB. Cheers!"
,DannyDemonic,2011-10-09T17:31Z,"Also, Septitais, in your next upload of this torrent, can you make them all the same format? I'm getting annoyed that I have to change seasons 7 - 10 into AVI files."

,ez100,2011-11-17T03:03Z,"for most part they are okay the watermarks get pretty annoying and alot of the episodes the sounds goes to shit, but not bad effot"

If I ever re-upload this torrent, it will be some time in end of July.
Will include seasons 1-12 dual audio with 720p.

@DannyDemonic
Use VLC Media Player and there wont be a need for conversion."
,VyxenMynx,2012-06-04T06:40Z,"@Septitais: I hope you have uploaded as you said in previous comment. I am currently DLing and will seed at 100kbs for a while before watching, since i am also watching it streaming in Japanese. The 100kbs is also while im DLing. Dont know if that makes a difference or not...  Thank you for this torrent, tho."

,jpg101,2012-06-07T19:03Z,oh sorry. it's ok. just got confused because files are not in alphabetical order. but episodes 82-91 are there. :)
,Drakosed,2012-06-14T23:37Z,"V:5 A:4 and the adult swim logo is in the bottom corner. Maybe im just a stickler for quality, but this is not a good torrent in my book. poor quality and its very quit. The audio is poor at best and the video is downright sloppy. i give you props for trying, but its not worth the time downloading."
,Drakosed,2012-06-14T23:44Z,Excuse my last comment. that was my little brother being a retard. i like the upload. thumbs up from me. my little brother wouldnt know good anime if it smacked him in the face. sumimasen
