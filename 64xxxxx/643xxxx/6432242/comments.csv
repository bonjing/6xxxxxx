,Leib,2011-05-29T20:42Z,"Wow people, there've only been a few posts before yours answering your questions about HD coming. You couldn't have gotten this far in life without reading SOMETHING, don't be so lazy. and Thank YOU VERY MUCH SAKCuk for another job well done. BTW, I only watch on my computer, so the smaller files are perfectly adequate and also don't take so long to download as HD."
,digimike50,2011-05-30T03:43Z,"Superb! Thank you! The internet is AWFUL in Thailand, so as Leib said - smaller files are better for me (as well) and yesterday downloaded quickly. Many must agree, as already there are 469 seeders and 777 leechers! Cheers!"
,0wizard,2011-05-30T05:11Z,"thanks for the smaller post. this is about the limit for source material for my series 2 tivo. it will probably show in the proper aspect ratio, as well.
