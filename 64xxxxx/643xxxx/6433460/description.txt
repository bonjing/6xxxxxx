Storyline: A trained American Hitman, Joe has four rules: know when to get out, erase every trace, take no interest in people outside work, and ask no questions. He goes to Bangkok for a month-long assignment, to kill four people for Bangkok ganglord Surat.He hires pickpocket Kong as his go-between, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Target details from the Bangkok gangsters are delivered to Kong via a nightclub dancer, Aom, with whom Kong becomes romantically involved.Joe's first execution is done in traffic with him riding a bike. A little girl is in the way, so Joe rides round the block and stops in front of the car, where he shoots the target with a machine pistol. During his getaway, he gets a graze on his arm and goes to a chemist shop, where he meets Fon, a beautiful deaf-mute who sells him his pills.His second target is a ganglord and sexual predator who buys young girls from the North and sells them for sex. Joe sneaks into the penthouse, but cannot find him. Joe ventures out to the pool and finds the ganglord and Joe drowns his target in the pool.He asks Fon to dinner the next day. She shows him some of the gentle beauty of life. Fon asks no questions, but when Fon's mother asks about Joe's work, he says he is a banker.
