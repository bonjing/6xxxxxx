These are the first demo songs of the band with the first singer - Simon Pribac. Even if these songs weren't on any official CD, they are well known to hardcore fans even today. These songs were supposed to be the first package of 6 songs to be on the first cd but the second package was never recorded.

Tracklist:
01 - Spider
02 - Proleter
03 - Vsak dan
04 - Pedofil
05 - Kanela Bar

2002 - Xavier demos
These are the second demo songs which feature the new singer of the band - Maksim Vergan for the first time and are - as in the first demos - part of what is should be - the first CD that would come out. It didn't. Some are early versions of official songs that would be recorded in the near future, some are old songs rerecorded for quality purposes and vocal changes.

2003 - NajveÄja Prevara 21. Stoletja
Finally the first official album surfaces. Recorded at studio Rose Nova Gorica, also by sleeping in the studio the band manages to get things done properly this time. It felt victory as you could finally not just listen, but touch your music.

2005 - Sodni Dan
The second album gets done and you can hear the difference as the band progresses and gains experience not just by playing live but also gains effectiveness during recording sessions. More "rocky" as the first album and definitely more enjoyable.

Tracklist:
01 - Kupid
02 - Belo
03 - Srebrna Krogla
04 - Halo Zemlja
05 - Oz

2005 - Remixes
There are 2 remixes of the song Belo. One featured a compilation of dance remixes Called DJ Time 11.  They were never part of official albums.

Tracklist:
01 - Belo RmX
02 - Belo RmX DJ Time

2007 - SreÄni Izbranci
The third album is definitely rocky and ska/reggae is hard to hear in this piece of art. But this does not mean that this is a bad cd. The band evolves through the years and gets as they say "back to the rocky roots" and keeps on rocking from its mystical intro to the end in hard riffs and fast rocking melodies

Tracklist:
01 - Intro (Vzlet)
02 - Feniksov Let
03 - SreÄa

11 - Radio
12 - Kocke (SreÄni Izbranci)

2009 - Stockholmski Sindrom
The last official album (for now) finally says goodbye to trumpet and saxophone and concentrates on hard rock riffs and strings. This is the best Pudding Fields album, still not overproduced. Easy to sing and to remember, these tunes won't get out of your head.

Tracklist:
01 - Stockholmski Sindrom
02 - Vsaka NoÄ
03 - Danes Ni Å e ÄŒas Za Smrt
