Cristina Branco is presenting her new record, released in Portugal on February 28th, named "NÃ£o hÃ¡ sÃ³ tangos em Paris", rising immediately to the 2nd place on the top selling records.The international release of this record took place on April 19th, with a different name - "Fado Tango". Branco was originally drawn to jazz and forms of Portuguese music before finally opting for fado after being introduced to the music of AmÃ¡lia Rodrigues by her grandfather. Branco studied the poems from which major fado lyrics are taken. Branco continues to work on her fado repertory, accompanied by CustÃ³dio Castelo on guitar and as composer.
