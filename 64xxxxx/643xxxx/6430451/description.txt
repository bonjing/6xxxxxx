Ashes of American Flags was produced and directed by Christoph Green and Fugaziâ€™s Brendan Canty and shot in five quintessentially American venues: Cainâ€™s Ballroom in Tulsa, OK; Tipitinaâ€™s in New Orleans, LA; The Mobile Civic Center in Mobile, AL; The Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, TN; and the 9:30 Club in Washington, DC. Mixing live concert footage with band interviews, it takes the viewer behind the scenes of Wilcoâ€™s 2008 US tour capturing both the expansive experience of rolling across America in a tour bus and the intimacy that happens night after night between the members of Wilco and the music they make, and between the band and their fans who come to experience it with them. While playing at a number of film festivals, Ashes of American Flags was awarded the prize for Best Cinematography at the Big Sky Film Festival.
