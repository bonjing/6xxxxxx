,cujimmmy,2011-05-31T19:05Z,whiteylion85 you have no idea what your talking about. scenebalance uploads Tons of Quantity but no Quality. Never seeds and is the biggest waste of space on the Pirate Bay.  Sell-out is 100% correct. In my opinion this Uploader should be demoted back to the ranks and lose the Skull.
