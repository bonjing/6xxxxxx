Personnel:
Steve Cheseborough - Voice, Guitars, Harmonicas, Percussion and all other sound

A consummate performer and a respected authority, musician/speaker Steve Cheseborough takes the acoustic country blues off of old 78s and brings it to life.Singing and playing a shiny metal guitar, sometimes adding touches of harmonica or percussion, Cheseborough (pronounced CHEZZ-bro) re-creates the music of 1920-30s blues legends such as Blind Boy Fuller, Charley Patton, Robert Johnson and Bo Carter. 1920s-30s-style acoustic blues, sounding eerily like an old 78 record, but without the scratches.
