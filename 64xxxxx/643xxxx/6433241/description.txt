You may know that one in four women will become a victim of domestic violence, but did you know that research shows that one in nine men will too? Violence against men is rarely talked about and under-reported. Dr. Phil continues his campaign to end the silence on domestic violence with two couples willing to open up about their abusive relationships. Can these women learn to control their tempers before something tragic happens?
