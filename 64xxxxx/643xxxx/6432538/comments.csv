,tyde588,2011-05-31T06:44Z,"How do you convert a DVD to an 700mb .avi, divx, or any other format for that matter? What program/s are the best for accomplishing such a thing? I want to convert my personal collection of dvds & bluerays to digital media."
,ph33rlus,2011-05-31T11:09Z,"@tyde588 - No simple answer. Google it for tutorials, it's much like cooking, heaps of ways to do it, some are good some not so much but there is no short and simple recipe."
,Ian_Iguana,2011-05-31T12:10Z,"yea..from what i've read, there's always alot of tweaking & playing around with the programs so ya get the best quality possible with minimal filesize"
