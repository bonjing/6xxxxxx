DVD RIP Description
Since its 1990â€™s broadcast, Carl Gorhamâ€™s multi award-winning animated sitcom has achieved cult status. Now released for the first time on DVD-RIP and including all six episodes from the first series (DVD 1 of The Complete Stressed Eric Collection)

Eric Feeble is 40, a divorced father with two kids and a crippling mortgage. His son is thick, his daughter is allergic to everything and his au-pair is an unreliable waster. The successful and wealthy Perfect family, who live next door, provide a constant and irritating reminder of what his life could have been. At work, a series of stress related illnesses have seen him demoted from Sales through half a dozen offices to the dark, dank wastelands of the Data Department, next to the Gentlemenâ€™s lavatory. Through it all Eric battles on, a man whose very survival each week against impossible odds makes him an ulcer-growing hero for our times.
