Until you release 5.1, you won't be as big of a releaser as you could be. HDScene puts out 5.1 and they're very popular, even though your video quality is superior. 
If people are going to download a 700MB movie, they're not going to mind another 75-150MB or whatever it takes."

,Kb1325,2011-05-30T09:32Z,"@ Xd,

Do you look at his other rips? How much seeders do you see? They all have a reasonable ratio and lots of seeds which should show Yify is pretty popular. Sometimes it's good to sacrifice one quality of a movie over another (I haven't had any problems with sound on his uploads). Why don't you start ripping movies and uploading, or even better yet.. BUY THE MOVIE?"
,Kb1325,2011-05-30T09:35Z,"Thanks for this trilogy by the way, and in a reasonable size! Been looking for this in mkv :)

Could you maybe consider doing The Scorpion King? Been looking for that one for awhile now. Thanks if you can!

,Wesley_Gibson,2011-05-30T10:03Z,@YIFY: Could yo do Hall Pass http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480687/ Thanks! :)
,s4shekher,2011-05-30T10:41Z,@xD1337x i m totaly agree with u... YIFY u can do it..... i m a big fan of ur uploads.... pls code 5.1 sound to ur uploads
,xD1337x,2011-05-30T12:51Z,"@s4shekher - At least someone has some sense around here! :P

@Kb1325 - You haven't had any problems with the sound because you obviously watch this on your TV speakers or your computer speakers.

Having a 5.1 surround system and having the sound only come out of 2 speakers is annoying."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-30T13:46Z,"@xD1337x

nope , yify should keep the file as it is, and he could ADD AN 5.1 EXTERNAL AUDIO TRACK in his torrents, whoever needs it will mux it with mkvmerge."
[V],IndexTrance,2011-05-30T13:50Z,"@ xD1337x

If you don't like the 2.0 channels, then download a bigger file who contains it .. Do you really have to complain about something that YIFY have done all along? Or even better, start encoding yourself and then you'll see how much time and effort he is putting in his releases .. Maybe time to grow up and stop busting balls for something thats totally free .. "
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-30T14:20Z,"@IndexTrance

Finally someone with a sense.

@xD1337x

The thing is that you haven't earned this upload.
All of this is free, if it doesn't suits you click away and there are lots of options."
,ajey_94,2011-05-30T14:33Z,^^ LOL!! i totally agree with IndexTrance..u r getting it for free..just shut ur arses and accept it or LEAVE IT

,Kb1325,2011-06-01T06:25Z,"@xd,

You are right, I don't have a 1000$ home entertainment system in the living room.. But these videos are being given to us for free so either deal with it or move on.

@ heart_hacker, 

As I and others have said, if u have problems with the audio not being 5.1 then download from other sources.. Not that hard. Lol"
,Tatletz,2011-06-01T10:46Z,"Thank you YIFY, great work as usual  : )"

,majikmann,2011-06-28T12:44Z,Hey is it just me or does Mummy Return not have the subtitles when they speak in another language? The other two movies are fine... 
,bond015,2011-07-11T23:52Z,In which player can you watch these movies? I only get audio on Windows media and nothing on Divx?
,shadowkillaa,2011-07-14T06:35Z,"V = 7.5
A = 9

Very decent quality for such a small size. 
Thankyou YIFY"
,majikmann,2011-07-17T22:17Z,do you guys have the translation when the they're speaking another language??
,bearclaw01234,2011-09-21T11:31Z,"YIFY, why did ye not include the Captions for when they speak a language other than english??  since the movie was made WITH the captions included."
,bearclaw01234,2011-09-21T11:33Z,"without those captions, it's only like watching half of each of the movies!  without the captions ye miss half of the story!"
,prashantaswani,2011-10-05T12:51Z,"gud quality in all the 3 movies. . .
gud work"
,Xorakka,2011-11-08T06:35Z,"Nice Quality YIFY..


However like several others I am disappointed by the absence of the subtitled dialogue that actually was part of the movie.

It would have been very simple to include a subtitle file that had the non english dialogue.

Was very annoying watching the movie, then rewinding and turning on English subtitles, just to see the ancient egyptian."
,Ki1l4U,2011-12-11T19:50Z,"Hey for anyone that wants it I'm manually editing the subtitles line by line so that it only includes the non English subtitles so you know what there saying when they talking in Egyptian or other languages, already done with the first movie I'll post a link when I'm done with the other two."
,cwd791,2012-04-20T11:47Z,"Hey Ki1l4U,
I don't suppose you have those subtitles for the non-english parts? 
Because I've searched the net and cannot seem to find them for any rip of these movies (though I've only really looked for Mummy 1)..
Any help would be greatly appreciated."
