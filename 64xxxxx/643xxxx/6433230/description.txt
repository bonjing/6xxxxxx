Who uses Design Premium?
Graphic designers use Adobe Creative Suite 5.5 Design Premium to design and develop content for a wide range of media, including print, web, interactive, and mobile devices.
Graphic designers are versatile professionals who apply their visual communication skills to a rapidly expanding array of projects. With the explosion of new media and devices, from the Internet to smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and Internet-enabled televisions, designers face tremendous pressure to continually adopt new tools and learn new techniques to efficiently and consis-tently deliver high-impact content across a wide variety of media.
Design Premium eases these challenges by providing a set of integrated tools for editing images, creating vector graphics, laying out print and web pages, authoring digital publications such as digital magazines and eBooks, crafting interactive designs, delivering content for mobile devices, and more.
Designers also face obstacles to preserving the integrity of their designs when collaborating with technical colleagues such as developers. Communicating design intent to web, interactive, and application developers can be challengingâ€”designers and developers speak different languages, and important nuances of designersâ€™ vision can be lost in translation.
Design Premium enables designers to express their vision directly using robust tools that draw on their existing skills and donâ€™t require them to master writing code. Now designers can preserve the quality and integrity of their designs much further into the development process, handing off content without fear that the final result will look very different from what they envisioned. And for some types of projects, designers can even finish the work themselves.
