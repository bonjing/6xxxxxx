The style of this Artwork is based on my first musical roots or something like that, however these are the meaning of, it's all about music â€œRepresenting all Motherfucking Gangsters across the Worldâ€ as the Tag of the 234th Edition. Pump up the bass and the volume as well, you will get enough clarity, I will promise you.

â€œAn Constant Life changes, is a paradoxical variable, relativity of your own perspectiveâ€ - â€œEquilibriumâ€
