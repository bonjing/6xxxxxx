These days, nobody would seriously complain about the lack of anonymity tools. Besides an impressive number of ready solutions, there are purely system-level methods of maintaining online privacy. A savvy system administrator can easily configure various traffic â€œroundaboutsâ€ and â€œdetoursâ€ to conceal its source and make backtracing virtually impossible. However, all these methods usually require a great deal of knowledge and are virtually inaccessible for regular users â€“ investigators, market researchers, NGO workers and others who need reliable anonymous surfing tools. If you are skilled enough, but are not quite thrilled by the idea of having to go deeply into an entanglement of protocols, gateways, hubs and routing tables, you should check out Mask Surf Professional. Looks like it may appear just what youâ€™ve been looking for!

Mask Surf Pro is an easy to use anonymizer based on a highly complex technology called Tor.

Mask Surf Pro makes good use of the array of encrypted Tor tunnels and distributed servers and offers you a level of protection youâ€™ve never imagined.

The professional edition of the application is geared for advanced users that need more control and flexibility than regular surfers. It features an ability to select the country that the software will use to emulate the userâ€™s location, which makes it possible to go around geo-specific browsing or access restrictions. Users can also specify alternative anonymity tests to be used by the application and switch between them to ensure that no real IP address is being recorded by the visited resources.
