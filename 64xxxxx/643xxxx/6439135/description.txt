SysTracer Pro 2.4 (x86/x64)

SysTracer is a system utility tool that can analyze your computer finding your modified files, folders and registry entries. Also SysTracer shows information about services, drivers and applications that are configured to run at computer startup. Each scan of SysTracer generates an overview image of your system stored into a snapshot. Recording the snapshot usually takes a few minutes depending on your system complexity.

If you want you can choose to scan only files, registry or applications, in order to speed up the recording process. By comparing snapshots from before and after a new program installation or execution, you can determine which files or registry entries were added, changed, or deleted. You can create as many snapshots you may want, and you can compare anytime any pair of them, having the possibility to export differences to HTML list.
