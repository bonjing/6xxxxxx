Definitely worth the small DL and should be part of everyones arsenal of system utilities. Although there are probably other programs out there that do similar things, its nice having a small-sized program like this that allows you to take snapshots of your registry/directories/files/software/drivers/etc all in one click, which can be ""compared"" to another snapshot (for example, at a later date) to see the differences between the two (such as what changes installing a program made to your registry, etc).. Check it out.
