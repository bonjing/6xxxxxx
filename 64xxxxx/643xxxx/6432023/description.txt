The Secret of Using Psycho-Cybernetics to Change Your Life

Discovery of the "self-image" represents a breakthrough in psychology and the field of creative personality. The significance of the self-image has been recognized for more than a decade. Yet there has been little written about it. Curiously enough, this is not because "self-image psychology" has not worked, but because it has worked so amazingly well. As one of my colleagues expressed it, "I am reluctant to publish my findings, especially for the lay public, because if I presented some of my case histories and described the rather amazing and spectacular improvements in personality, I would be accused of exaggerating, or trying to start a cult, or both." I, too, felt the same sort of reluctance. Any book I might write on the subject would be sure to be regarded as somewhat unorthodox by some of my colleagues for several reasons. In the first place, it is somewhat unorthodox for a plastic surgeon to write a book on psychology. In the second place, it will probably be regarded in some quarters as even more unorthodox to go outside the tight little dogma â€” the "closed system" of the "science of psychology" â€” and seek answers concerning human behavior in the fields of physics, anatomy and the new science of Cybernetics.
