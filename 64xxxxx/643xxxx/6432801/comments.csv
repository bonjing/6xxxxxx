Funny that you use the word ""crutch"" pot IS a crutch, like crutches, it helps the sick. I don't think I've ever heard of successful treatment of illness with booze though, so that doesn't qualify huh? You'll find a great many studies using pot to treat a variety of issues from chronic migraines, arthritis and even schizophrenia.

Praise to one of the most universally useful products on earth."

""Yeh.... gimme a half-pint of Knotty-haid and a cuppa ice. I got this buzz that just won't let up and I GOTTA get sober before I drive home.... so, uh....throw a half-pint o' scotch in and we're good ta go.....!""

Humans have a right to adjust the way they feel as long as it does not have a negative effect on those around them. The use of a substance for the purposes of what certain substances DO (i.e.; sensory stimulation, pain control) becomes an incurable disease (addiction) when the cessation of use has adverse consequences on the..... (this is where there's a problem in correct identity).

If someone is injured or suffers pain-inducing disease to the extent that severe pain exists months later and there is no physical means of eliminating that pain (i.e.; third-degree burns, skin grafts, bone grafts, neuropathy, neuroma, bone disease, reflex sympathetic dystrophy) and opioid analgesics are the only solution, the PATIENT is in the exact same straights as a USER. It is incorrect and damaging to continue to make substance use a moral issue. That's right, I said ""use""..... humans become accused of substance abuse when it's actually being abused by the substance.

Rehabs are, as a result of the ""morality"" issue, ill-equipped to handle chronic pain victims whose use, need, and/or access to analgesics (that just HAPPEN to be addictive) has been compromised.... so what to do with someone whose pain is severe but outlasts the period dictated as ""acceptable""? Doctors cut them off, thinking they're helping society.... what is actually happening is they're punishing the patient. True, because opioid addiction is what it is, and if the patient's requests for refills occur after pain has subsided, it is possible the patient is using the opioids to offset the horrific withdrawal.

People who are asking for a little spare change and who are labeled as ""junkies"" may ACTUALLY be trying to offset the sickness. They may be WAY up on tolerance and can't begin to afford the dose adequate for euphoria, but even a small amount of the drug can buy them a couple hours of ""feeling normal"", but deep in their souls they want the entire nightmare of addiction to be over.... patients with long-term chronic pain are in the same exact shape..... a mess, and such that it is often self-perpetuating because of the absolutely incorrect morality aspect. Go to an emergency room while on the threshold of alcohol withdrawal and get a benzo to help you feel better and keep you out of seizures. Go to the ER with withdrawal from pain meds and the next thing you'll see is the curb outside as the wheelchair dumps you...."
,monsveneris,2011-07-24T20:26Z,"and OOPS I did drift off topic with my above (fist-ever) post.... yep, it is baffling that in my entire (so-far successful) several years in recovery from hardcore drug addiction, 99% of those who tell their story begin with alcohol as the first-ever substance, and it is very rare that marijuana was the first, and often never even mentioned as an issue in their substance (alcohol is a substance) use history....
but to those who endured the post, thanks for putting up with the frustrated writer :)"
