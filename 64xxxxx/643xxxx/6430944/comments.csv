And the uploader says no .rars. big fuckin deal. Winrar is free. I downloaded the files. unrar'd them. And am watching the prelims as we speak. Stop whining and learn how to use a computer, dumb fucks. There are no viruses here, its not fake. You just have to be a little less retarded than some of these douchebags to know how to utilize the files. LOL at dumb fucks."
