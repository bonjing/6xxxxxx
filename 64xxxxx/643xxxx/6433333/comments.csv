,Irieles,2011-05-30T07:52Z,"Lame..!! Password protected, and to get the password you have to ""complete an offer"" at some random website. If I wanted to do that, I could have just done a google search for this, and done it that way. In fact, that's the reason I decided to start getting the torrent instead...

And yes, I created an account just to tell everyone that.

Have a nice day :)"
,bizkit13,2011-05-30T08:35Z,Thanks your the best
,Fapfapnaprepeat,2011-05-30T08:43Z,I wanna have your babies
,gerfmarquez,2011-05-30T08:55Z,"I enjoy this show, and would support it by watching it on TV but it does not broadcast the same day in my country and don't like having to wait and watch tv advertisements that is why I pay my cable company for,  they should be fine just with all of its customer's  monthly bill instead of having to put  4 minutes of tv commercials every 15 minutes that cuts the inspiration."
,fire711,2011-05-30T09:34Z,"@irieles go hang your self loser, this isn't password protected and it works absolutely PERFECTLY. Once Again thanks eztv!!"

,arkhamjoker78,2011-05-30T09:45Z,Irieles... COMPLETE UTTER BULLSHIT. Just the fact you needed an account to dribble that bullshit proves your nothing but a troll.

,mancbhoy101,2011-05-30T11:16Z,"thanks for the upload, but whats going on with the EZTV website? is it just me who cant get on it or is down?"

,rofoofighters,2011-05-30T12:06Z,"ARE YOU GUYS RETARDED?????? What Irieles is saying is  that he downloaded it from somewhere else and it was password protected, so he : ""decided to start getting the torrent instead...""

Sometimes I really do wonder...."

,aradiel,2011-05-30T12:53Z,@knoxius usually the web version is released after it airs. It was released early last week for the holidays. Expect the web version of 8 to be available after the scene version next week.
,kkkiwi,2011-05-30T13:48Z,Best fucken TV show ever man!

,hahq,2011-05-30T19:00Z,much appreciated ;)
,Halibuty,2011-05-30T19:39Z,"All these positive comments and not one person posting the password?  Do you really think I'm stupid enough to turn on scripting on some website I've never heard of?

There are other ways to get the file, sad to see eztv switch to jew mode."
,97adbkaj7,2011-05-30T19:56Z,"@knoxius
Well, what irie wrote didn't make much sense did it...

If you go to a certain torrent and rant in the comment section 
""Lame..!! Password protected, and to get the password you have to ""complete an offer"" at some random website. If I wanted to do that, I could have just done a google search for this, and done it that way."" 
it's taken for granted you're talking about the torrent the comment section is actually for.

To end with "" In fact, that's the reason I decided to start getting the torrent instead..."" doesn't really make his point clear, that he wasn't even referring to this torrent.

Either way, his bs is irrelevant for this torrent and it's appreciated to keep comments clean and only mention relevant things, or to say thanks.
Nothing else here matters.
Maybe your cat just shat on the carpet, but we don't need you to tell us about here.

Get it?"
,97adbkaj7,2011-05-30T19:58Z,"@Halibut
Wtf are you talkin about?
1st of all you can shove your racism up your anus.
2nd of all if you have never heard of tpb than get your head out your anus.
3rd of all, this torrent isn't pw protected."
,dzikus,2011-05-30T20:52Z,great show !!!
,steinmayer,2011-05-30T21:45Z,"Hey guys, when I try to open the RAR file it asks me for a password, does anyone know it? Please! I'd really apprecaiet it."
,amartini,2011-05-30T22:12Z,"Are you all blind? this one keeps going out of focus! not the quality we are used to from ez, something fishy here..."
,mizhop,2011-05-31T00:00Z,"I have to agree with the out of focus comment... it wavers like there's heat in the vicinity, and there's not.  Highly annoying... and unfortunate as well as unexpected for what I'm used to seeing in EZTV's work.  But thanks for the up anyway! Still perfectly watchable, just very distracting.

,Snedde1,2011-05-31T00:23Z,"One of the best shows out there!
"
,tom_appleford,2011-05-31T00:34Z,Thanx eztv

,Rzi,2011-05-31T00:44Z,yes this goes out of focus all the time definitely worse than past releases but it will do for me. not going to dl the 720p. 
,rickcerri,2011-05-31T02:19Z,"whats the PW, i have a mac, maybe thats why i have to put a PW?"
,mikelfann,2011-05-31T09:33Z,thankyou!!!!

,M4RKU5.,2011-05-31T15:41Z,"Dont listen to mizhop, video is well over a 5, more like 8"
,rofoofighters,2011-05-31T16:19Z,"@dnivie123 

There is NOT ""now password"" , there never was a password and never will be, ""STOP TROLLING YOU FAT UGLY PIG DOG, I HOPE SANTA COMES DOWN AND SHITS IN YOUR EGG NOG""

btw the password is ""THERE IS NO PASSWORD STOP TROLLING"""
,AbleArcher,2011-05-31T17:13Z,"Just like the fucking idiots who fall for the free tooth whitening / 6 pack belly / Â£600 per-hour from google crap I am sure people will fall for this shitty 
fucking fake arse torrent.
And all because there are lots of 'great reviews and feedbacks'
Well they are all created by the same crooked fucks who uploaded this bullshit torrent. 
Password protected and you have to fill in some bollocks surveys or whatnot. Even if you got the password this torrent most certainly WILL NOT be Game of Thrones EP07 so don't waste your time with this shash.
And flame me all you like, one of my most satisfying ways of passing time is being abused by con artists that I have sussed out and shared with the world.
PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. PASSWORDED FAKE. 
Up yours cunt. "
,atlas81,2011-05-31T18:01Z,"I've logged in just to tell AbleArcher that you are a moron. 

It works fine, quality is not the best, but no password required. Reported. 
"
,Dadub,2011-05-31T18:23Z,"Hey guys here is a point of note:

When I dled the show the first time I also got a dumb rar with a password.

After some investigation I found out the reason was that the ""magnet link"" address was probably tampered. 

If using ""Download This Torrent"" link you will get the usual avi, but when using the ""Magnet Link"" the dl starts with a rar.

So please use the ""download this torrent"" link if you have the same problem. I need some people to check for me as well so if you can please reply to this comment with feedback. Thanks"
,AbleArcher,2011-05-31T20:36Z,"atlas81:

I am a moron, indeed I already know that. You pubeless pederast.

Don't ya see how st ooo pid it sounds when you say 'reported'
REPORTED?
Reported to who motherfucker?
Henry Kissinger?
Joe Mccarthy?
Oprah?

Tsk. Keep sending those reports boy, your winter nights must just flyby with all that important stuff you have to do.

In fact - REPORTED - there ya go jismgurgler, i've reported you back.
And when Joe Pesci reads what you've been upto on the piratebay he is gonna come get you woohoo!!!

What a plum."

,Sparqz,2011-05-31T21:54Z,"DO NOT USE THE MAGNET LINK IT IS LINKED TO THE INCORRECT TORRENT!!!! Wow, caps ftw right there.  ""The Download This Torrent"" link works fine and I can a-test to that because i watched this episode, really good btw. love this show, not bad quality either.  Make sure you dont use the magnet link please, after testing it I can assure you that it is fake and odd, because I've never seen something like that before."

Thanks eztv and AbleArcher you crack me up, I would say pull yourself together before you comment but, you'd be the only one then! @Dadub, was going to mention that myself, looking at my screen right now there are also 3 misleading ads that say 'Download' Hope no one else falls for that trick. @jetbear2002, I wouldn't concern myself too much, our gov doesn't get anything done. Although if it helps protect rich corporations, that carries more weight with us. What happened to gov protecting us instead of every crybaby millionaire"
