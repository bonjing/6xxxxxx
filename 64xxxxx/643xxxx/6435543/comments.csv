I've not been able to find any 1080p releases of Macross Zero or Frontier with eng Subs so hacked these. If you DL them, through any of my torrents, please check and report back any synch errors here."
,XenoJoker,2011-05-31T00:13Z,This torrent will go live by 1st June 2011 at the latest - need high bandwidth to seed this properly so should sort it by the 1st.
,octanehammer,2011-06-26T00:47Z,"@ XenoJoker many, many thanks for bringing us Macross heaven.  Especially DYRL, been looking for a remastered version.  However I seem to have missed subtitles for 'Macross HD Remastered Tokuten Disc - Macross Special Initial Broadcast'.  Did I miss them or are there subtitles available?

Again, many thanks.  It was better than Christmas.  :)"
,XenoJoker,2011-07-06T12:09Z,"@ octanehammer: np - my goal is to bring heaven on earth! for macross fans anyway lol!

I must have forgotten to check the special broadcast version. Just checked it now from my original seed files and your correct, no subtitles exist for this release (as far as i know). I will have to port them over from the normal episode 1 and 2 releases. Will include this fix in the next release. Thanks for catching this one. Any more issues including subtitle synch problems please post here."
,nuboo,2011-08-29T01:20Z,"Thank you so much for putting this torrent up for all of us! But let me see if I understand.
Some time ago i got BangUchiha entire macross collection before it got closed, and i think it was 36 episodes.
All in original audio. So this has that in addition to more of the series including lots of other goodies of course.

But i heard from some people that the continuation was very bad, but is this not true for the non-american version?
Thanks for any response!!!!"
,XenoJoker,2011-09-23T15:32Z,"@nuboo thanks for the post.

As a good starting point u can go check wiki for the following:
The Super Dimension Fortress Macross (created 82')
Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross (created 84')
Genesis Climber MOSPEADA created 83/84')

The US adaptation (termed Robotech) was a mish-mash of the 3 jap series above. Therefore its never had good continuity.

Of the 3 jap series the second and third only ran for a season and consequently were adapted for continuing the Robotech mish-mash export.

What started it all: The original work is the 82' series by Studio Nue (+others), which has several further series (see torrent). They all form part of the macross world (except for The Super Dimension Fortress Macross II: Lovers, Again â€“ which is officially classed as a parallel universe story - also included in torrent).

Regarding the Macross continuation, the Macross universe expands over 50 yrs of story from 2009 to 2059. It is made up of distinct series/movies most of which are sequels but there has been a prequel ova aswell. See here for macros chronology info:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macross#Series_chronology

In some cases a series has been redone as a 2hr movie which understandably can have a different edit and even new material added to it. But the overall story remains intact.

The macross tv franchise has the TSDFM, Macross Plus, Macross 7, Macross Zero, Macross Frontier, etc series collections. Within each series collection continuity is fine. But between these there can be gaps which I believe and expect are intended as they take the story in a different direction and can be based 5 or 10 yrs after the other series with new characters.

I personally don't class that as bad continuity but expanding the macross universe. See it as Star trek but over 50 yrs thanks to some serious alien technology injection to jump start our exploration of space lol."
