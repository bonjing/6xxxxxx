Hope all you Macross fans are ready for some serious Macross goodness "updated!"

This is the long promised (and hopefully long awaited) updated release of the "Macross Uber Collection Complete" torrent originally located here:
 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5809156/Macross_Uber_Collection_Complete_-_Jap_with_Eng_Sub_50gb

This one is cleverly named "Macross Uber Collection II" :) and any future updates will follow this naming convention.

NOTE 1: This collection is in Jap with some Eng audio but full Eng Subs. 
NOTE 2: There is NO Macross music/CD rips contained in this torrent, just videos.
NOTE 3: Nearly all of the updated content is taken from RapidShare (spent some $Â£$Â£) using links from http://www.macrosshare.com.
Note 4: I have made 1080p version's of Macross Zero and Frontier (taken from Rapidshare) and combined them with Eng subs taken from Thora's 720p releases
Note 5: Please take time to rate quality of this torrent at The Pirate Bay. Original torrent was 50GB approx, this one is 90GB approx - so some serious updates included

Download Options - (I assume you have already had the realiszation that Macross is the best Anime out there - better than much of the crud coming outta Hollywood these days! AND SO want to be hit with all the macross goodness in its original form with english subs :))

Option 1 - New to Macross
Just download this torrent in full to have the complete Macross video collection

Option 2 - Already have some Macross (NOT from my old torrent)
If you have some Macross videos downloaded in the past, you may want to compare your downloaded material to whats in this collection. But i advise you to replace it with this one, as much of this collection is new or encoded in x264 (mkv container) with better quality compared to other stuff out there - (i checked).

Option 3 - You downloaded my old torrent (see link above)
This release replaces most of the videos in the original torrent with higher resolution ones and adds MANY booklets and dvd covers (there were next to none in the original torrent) and i have renamed everything! so if ur updating the old collection, simple option is to delete it all and download this new one, else if you kept the original torrent's folder structure intact (and not bothered about my re-naming of files) then ONLY DOWNLOAD and REPLACE or ADD the following folders from this torrent:

1 Macross > 1A Macross > Gallery (Add this new folder - only DVD covers and content is new)
1 Macross > 1B Do You Remember Love (replace old folder)
1 Macross > 1C Macross Flashback (replace old folder)
1.1 Macross II > Macross II Covers (Add this new folder - only DVD covers are new)
3 Macross 7 (replace old folder)
4 Macross Zero (replace old folder - FIRST EVERY RELEASE @ 1080p with Eng Subs)
5 Macross Frontier (replace old folder - FIRST EVERY RELEASE @ 1080p with Eng Subs)

Original torrents release notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK got tired of tracking down all the Macross Movies and OVAs so made this large collection to make your life easy - but its a large download (i know!)
Made this torrent after weeks of searching the net and compiling the best available (English sub/audio version) downloads for all the macross anime.
Files are avi/divx/xvid as far as i recall with mkv containers in most cases. Use K-Lite standard codec pack 630 or later to play all of these with no problem.

Note: There is another large Macross collection torrent out there made about 3 years ago (~ 2007) which did not have Macross Frontier.
Some of the comparable files were also of lower quality probably to save the file size.

In (release order) the collection has: (* denotes Jap with Eng subs / ^ denotes 640x480 res)

None of the robotech junk which was hashed together from Macross and other anime by US broadcasters.
None of the movies or episodes are split across multiple files, each is contained in a single file

The Super Dimension Fortress Macross - full series*^
The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love - movie*^
The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012*^
