In the space of 60 seconds a body processes one quadrillion atoms of oxygen, several trillion molecules of carbon dioxide, and the untold products of digestion. After forty years, 90% of the atoms in our body are different. So are you still the same person? Science writer Michael Hanlon takes us into the depths of this and other scientific mysteries, exploring the oft-asked questions of young and old alike. In witty, engaging prose, Hanlon asks:

â€¢ Does your dog have a soul?

â€¢ Will we ever be able to live forever?

â€¢ Are we getting smarter?

â€¢ Is science really ready to discount the possibility of ghosts?

Science may not have all the answers (yet), but while taking us on this grand tour of todayâ€™s scientific conundrums, Hanlon reveals the complexities behind the mysteries that persist, and shows us that the answers may be coming sooner than we think.
