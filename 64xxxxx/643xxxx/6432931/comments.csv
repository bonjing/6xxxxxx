the cult of greed and self-interest. yay.

funny how no one ever mentions that rand spent her life bullshitting, then used an alias to have her medical bills paid for by the state at the end of her life. Her reasoning? Well, the medical bills would have ruined her! I mean, everyone else is just being lazy and greedy, but when it's rand....well, it's only reasonable, because the bills would have ruined her! 

such a fraud.... such a bankrupt philosophy.... such a shame to see 33 freakin' people seeding this garbage.

go and hung yourself, Ayn Rand is one the most genius thinker of her Age, i wonder why ppl like you hate her with out understanding Objectivism, dumb a** loser, go get life! "
,Barkingspyder,2011-11-29T20:30Z,So getting back money that was forcibly taken from you is wrong?  As usual the anti-Rand folks never get the facts right.  Just like watching a Michael Moore movie.  There may be some truth to it but it's edited together in such a way as to pervert the real meaning into something completely different.
