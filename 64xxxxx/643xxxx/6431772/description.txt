Microsoft Office 2010 in English with a 32 bit version Dutch Language Pack.



Instructions:
-Mount the .iso file with the Office 2010 collection and install it.
-If you want it in Dutch, just instal the Dutch Language Pack after installing Office 2010 itself. 
-I don't activated it and there is no activator inside, so if you want it activated; just download an activator. I don't have problems with a non-activate one, so that's the reason why I don't put a activator in the torrent.
