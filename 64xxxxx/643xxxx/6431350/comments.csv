,phish1999,2011-06-03T19:47Z,"Thanks for the tunes, McLuv. Phish is a favorite group of mine. With ever-rising ticket prices, I cannot go to as many shows as I hoped to, or as many as I once did. Fortuntely, SBD recordings are circulating, and I can sort of re-live the experience of being at the show. This sure beats the AUD recordings of yester-year (wow, those sucked!) - Soundboard, all the way babyyyyyyyy."
