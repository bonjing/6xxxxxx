,tiltswitch,2011-05-30T09:45Z,"chris can u xplain how to use the fix it as it doesnt seem to work...iv heard u need ppf o matic?

cheers for the upload"
,kirre34,2011-05-30T12:55Z,Is this game any good? Worth wasting a DL on?
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-30T17:40Z,"found it, doable with image editor
1. delete XBOX360TOC_xxx, leave XBOX360TOC.txt from folder DFGAME
2.from folder COOKEDXENON delete COALESCED_FRA.bin
3.copy COALESCED_int.binand rename it COALESCED_FRA.bin
4. save

Sound&menu are now in english."
,Demonarma,2011-05-30T18:10Z,Which program is needed to open the stuff to change language to english?
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-30T19:24Z,"after install look at folders , you can find these files there."
,Demonarma,2011-05-31T00:01Z,"Awsome. NOT I do see any program to ""install"" at all. Complete guide would be great."
,PaksMunn,2011-05-31T11:31Z,"I could really use a detailed guide, because i dont understand anything chris-aksel is sayng."
,Demonarma,2011-05-31T13:20Z,"When you post any torrents and there is something missing please make/give link to guide. Otherwise it's not shit worth and you don't deserve ""Blue Skull""."
,tiltswitch,2011-05-31T14:13Z,"the patch is easy enuff but the english fix is doin my head in,iv tried 5 iso editors and still cant open it properly"
,treetall,2011-05-31T16:41Z,"So... is there a FREE iso editor out there that does this or are we all scr*wed till someone else puts a new torrent up?
"
,treetall,2011-05-31T16:57Z,So can anyone link to a free iso editor? Or a program on Pirate Bay?
,tiltswitch,2011-05-31T17:05Z,"screwed i think,the english fix is for jtag onli from what i can gather..."
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-31T17:46Z,"Now , take this magicISO.
https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5249187/MagicISO_Maker_5.5_Build_281_%28serial%29

There is serial for it also.

Now open the game .ISO file with magicISO , here is tutorial HOW TO EDIT FILES IN .ISO
http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-features.htm
After you have edited the files in there SAVE.

Files what you need to edit.

1. delete XBOX360TOC_xxx, leave XBOX360TOC.txt from folder DFGAME
2.from folder COOKEDXENON delete COALESCED_FRA.bin
3.copy COALESCED_int.binand rename it COALESCED_FRA.bin
4. save

Now burn it & play."
,treetall,2011-05-31T18:26Z,"OK, apparently I am a total noob... every time I try to open the image in mISO, it recognizes it like a video. And either if I click cacnel or OK, it just shows 3 folders, video, audio and systemupdate. 

What am I doing wrong? 

And I am still wondering how to patch the thingy... 

But thanks for trying :)"
,Pauluz88,2011-05-31T18:41Z,You can't change the ISO it will brake the signature. Wait for an English ISO update/fix.
,tiltswitch,2011-06-01T08:12Z,"chris its for jtag onli i think iv tried magic iso and some files are locked,il read the tut uv linked but to be honest doubt its gonna work"
,tiltswitch,2011-06-01T08:16Z,"@treetall u need ppf o matic to use the patch fix,its free and once installed takes about 2 secs to do...just google it."
,treetall,2011-06-01T13:16Z,"OK, thanks all... I was able to patch the image, but when I want to import it into mISO, there are problems. 

Either it just shows video,audio, sysup... or it says the file is too large. 

I tried even in properties to set an XBOXimage ans it still sas the file is too big... 

Which is funny, since it is 7 gig and the max in the program is supposed to be 10gigs. 

meh, I guess I'll have to wait a bit too"
,tiltswitch,2011-06-01T13:38Z,"i kno it doesnt if ud read all the comments ud c that,he was sayn he still havin trouble applyin the patch"
,tiltswitch,2011-06-01T13:43Z,read all the comments from where the fix for english lang originated and that fix is for jtag it works for jtag defo due to the way all files are opened within the jtagged machine...wether u can open the files to edit in an iso reader is doubtful as i have tried atleast 9 now
,TheHFH,2011-06-01T16:43Z,Could you guys upload RegionFree version or the NTSC i have been wait alot for this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My console don't run PAL

,Ddarkprince,2011-06-01T19:12Z,"If you only can speak english dont!!!! download this,

As for the rest of you, who gives a fuck about languages, why not take a look and see if its any good, graphics, mechanics and so forth."
[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-06-01T22:33Z,Going to upload NTSC version now..
