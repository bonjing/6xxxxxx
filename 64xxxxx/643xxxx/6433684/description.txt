Missing Persons - Mental Hopscotch [promo].VOB


Very HQ very rare promo music video. "Mental Hopscotch" is a song from the self-promoted EP Missing Persons.

Missing Persons is an American band who plays a blend of New Wave music and pop rock. The band was founded in 1980 in Los Angeles by guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, vocalist Dale Bozzio, and drummer Terry Bozzio. They went on to add bassist Patrick O'Hearn and keyboardist Chuck Wild. Dale's quirky voice and heavy makeup made the band a favorite on MTV in the early 1980s. 
Her revealing outfits played a pivotal role in moving the culture of music videos towards that of overt sexual exhibitionism.

In 1980 the band made its first record, a 4-song EP entitled Missing Persons, in Frank Zappa's brand-new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen studios; the recording was financed by Cuccurullo's father. The band toured, promoted the EP, appeared in the movie Lunch Wagon, and became a must-see band among the Los Angeles live music crowd. "Mental Hopscotch" was a #1 record on local radio station KROQ, and the self-promoted EP sold 7,000 copies.
 
Two years of hard work led up to a signing with Capitol Records in 1982. With label support, the re-released EP sold another 250,000 units, and the new full-length album Spring Session M (an anagram of "Missing Persons") went gold.
