PaceMaker is a plug-in for Winamp player that enables independent control of the sound tempo, pitch and playback rate:

Tempo control speeds up or slows down the music tempo without affecting the music key (pitch)

Pitch control changes the music pitch (key) without affecting the tempo

Speed control changes the music playback rate as if a vinyl record or an audio tape were played at a too high or low rate.

PaceMaker version 2 also features a Vocal Removal capability to suppress original singing voice, which is useful for practicing singing or karaoke.
