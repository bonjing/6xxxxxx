[color=aqua][b][size=6]Storyline[/size][/b][/color]

Raj, Yogi and Vikram - best friends, business partners, serial womanizers and happily married! Happy, because their lovely wives have no clue that their husbands cheat on them with every pretty young thing they can lay their eyes on. This picture perfect world is rocked when Raj's wife, Sanjana begins to suspect her husband and hires the suave private detective, Kishan, to tail him. Kishan's built his reputation as a man who saves marriages by getting erring husbands to mend their ways. In this particular case, however, his overwhelming attraction towards Sanjana means he may not be acting in her best interest! What follows is a crazy cat and mouse game, with Kishan trying to catch the husbands with their pants down literally and them attempting to just stay outside his grasp.
