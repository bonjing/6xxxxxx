NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Jumping the Broom

Right,we were kindly given this silver and have been sitting on it for a while hoping to get 

some line,but it never happened and isn't looking good ...so we decided to release what we have.

The video was dull,interlaced badly,lacked colour and contained a bit of camera movement...the 

audio was and is the worse part.Is like your old cam audio....hollow with lots of laughing The 

video we cleaned up and make it look 100x times better and would have made a decent TS,but hey 

ho you win some,you lose some Audio we left the original track on the silver and didn't touch it 

at all ....just remuxed back to our rip.

Enjoy folks....
