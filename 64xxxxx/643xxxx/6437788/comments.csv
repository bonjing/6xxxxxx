Do you have any plans to upload Captivate CS5.5 or the new eLearning Suite with CS5.5 updates?

Thanks in advance."

,jordzen,2011-06-05T09:33Z,"hi thethingy...  newbie user here. 

where can we see what is contained in this torrent? is this CS5 suite (includes premiere, photoshop, etc etc?) or is it something else?

thanks"
,jordzen,2011-06-05T09:52Z,ok sorry i realise now that its content only. have you not uploaded the master collection itself? i see that you linked to another user's torent - is this one ok?? 
[V],thethingy,2011-06-05T23:32Z,"jordzen, posting it in about an hour"
,skapegoat,2011-06-05T23:38Z,"hey i have some questions cause i extracted but i got no exe to run it and there is no plugins/fonts folder anywhere so i cant get on at all 
help would be very nice right now thank you"

^^^master collection"
,pirbay1958,2011-06-07T02:29Z,"Hi All and Thanks to thethingy for all his great work.Maybe my download was corrupted but all I got was a 2.69 GB extractable file when extracted yielded 3.75 GB of hundreds of FONTS in dozens of languages.None of the functional content like designer menus for encore or designer templates for premiere etc were present.
btw in my experience NO previous versions of the actual adobe programs or mastercollection torrents have ever contained this functional content,even ""full retail version"" torrents.
a)is everyone just getting FONTS in this torrent?
b)does anyone know where there is real functional content to download?
c)as a workaround I am still using functional content saved from CS2 days so if you have kept your old cs2 progs just tranfer it across to cs5
cheers
Sam"
[V],thethingy,2011-06-07T02:54Z,"pirbay1958, this is what it is, fonts and more fonts, I posted it in a separate torrent cause people think its functioning for some reason when that stopped in cs4, all you get is fonts for cs5.5"
,pirbay1958,2011-06-07T04:19Z,"Hi thethingy
again thanks for all the uploads and for clarification about this one.

I have not been able to get ""Functional content"" since CS2 days.I always wondered why it was not available as a torrent.Apparently there is over 13GB of content (not just fonts) on the CS5 (and presumably CS5.5) installation disc for mastercollection.

This should include for example predesigned title templates (.prtl files) to be placed in Program Files>Adobe>Adobe Premiere Pro CS5>Presets>Templates. A similar situation would apply for Encore predesigned menu templates (.psd and .em files) which should be placed in (according to the default location seen under ""Edit"" (within encore) >Preferences>Media is   C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Encore CS5\Library

anyway thanks again"
[V],thethingy,2011-06-07T04:44Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5353064/ADOBE_CS4_EXTRA_CONTENT_AND_RESOURCES_%5Bthethingy%5D

that's all the cs4 stuff, there is actually a couple of things in that other than fonts, but as far as cs5 goes you only get 1 extra download after purchasing and this is it, except the 32bit support pack that's just after effects and pre pro cs4.

bear in mind this is what you get for master collection, premiere pro cs5.5 might have different content so Ill check and post that along with the other contents if there is more than just fonts"
[V],thethingy,2011-06-07T04:49Z,"pirbay1958, Apparently there is over 13GB of content "
,pirbay1958,2011-06-07T10:32Z,"@thethingy
yes this is what I've read also.

 It also stands to reason that CS5 would have had a similar amount of content,and not just fonts. CS5 paying customers must be using menu templates etc they get on commercial discs or download. In CS5 torrent programs in say in encore these so called Library folders dont exist.You need to create them and populate manually with whatever stuff you have at hand.....meaning the content was absent from trial versions and torrents.In a way a clever way for Adobe to limit the functionality of their programs and make it harder for hackers.

The content is on adobe website but of course you must sign in and presumably have proof of purchase before downloading.

Anyway if content is obtained its a simple matter to create and stick it in the right folder and the programs run perfectly. I know because I have done this with old CS2 content.

If no CS5 content is forthcoming thanks for the link to CS4 stuff,may try that

Once again so many thanks for all your effort and time,really quite exceptional,cheers

,pirbay1958,2011-06-07T10:44Z,"For the record in Windows 7 and works on my pc the file locations are

CS5 Premiere Created  titles (.prtl files but not title templates)
are stored in the project itself, not in separate files as was the case in CS3 and earlier.

CS5 Premiere Designer title templates (.prtl files) 
Program Files>Adobe>Adobe Premiere Pro CS5>Presets>Templates.

CS5 Premiere User title templates (.prtl files) 
Users>Name>Documents>Adobe>Premiere Pro > 5.0 >Templates 

CS5 Encore Created menus (not templates)
Psd and .em files will be saved with project files

CS5 Encore Designer menu templates 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe Encore CS5\Library 

CS5 Encore User Menu templates

 Users\Name\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Encore\5.0\Library

NB You may need to manually create the Library or Template folders in these locations before populating them"

But one question.
Does this have the warp stabalizer?
Because i could really use it for my videos."
,LatinoKillz123,2011-06-18T23:10Z,"And btw.
Does it have to finish seeding in bittorrent before i click on set up?
Cause i cant find setup."
,Mr.mofo,2011-06-20T14:39Z,"Forgive my ignorance, but what does this torrent do?

I have the master CS5 suite installed (core) and it works perfectly ... is this an upgrade from CS5 to CS5.5? 

... and if so, does one just have to launch the .exe to upgrade?

How does it work? What does it do?

Thanks."

this torrent as name implies is NOT CS5.5 Mastercollection which is here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6447765
