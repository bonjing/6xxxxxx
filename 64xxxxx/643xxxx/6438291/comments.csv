Can't download."
,creek75,2011-06-01T01:13Z,"@panze75: Well, I have 8 peers downloading from me at the moment *and* I checked the links here from a second machine. Might I suggest you try uTorrent if you have not already."
,creek75,2011-06-01T01:15Z,@panze75: I see your problem. Use the magnetic link. If your client does not support MLinks then switch to uTorrent or make sure your browser lets the links through.
