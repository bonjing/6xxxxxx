Sneaker Pimps - Becoming X

This is the now rare original 1996 release *not* the terrible remixed version released after Kelli left the band.

I tracked this down after a long search - I lost the original many years ago.

If you like it then try to track it down for yourself, too. However, don't expect to find this superior version in the shops - only the poor (in my opinion) remixed version can be found there.

3. 6 Underground
4. Becoming X
5. Spin Spin Sugar
6. Post-Modern Sleaze
7. Waterbaby
8. Roll On
9. Wasted Early Sunday Morning
10. Walking Zero
11. How Do


Note: You can usually tell the "bad" version by it having a 12th track, but that's not always the case. Be careful when trying to get an original for your collection. The original 'Circuit Board' cover design was used on a later remixed release - I think they tried to fool people into buying it as the original one.
