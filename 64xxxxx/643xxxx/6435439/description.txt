Considered one of the best
lyricists to emerge in the wake of
the Notorious B.I.G and Tupacs
deaths, Jay-Z carried the flag of
hip-hop narrative skill. His
Roc-A-Fella family had already
created a solid reputation based on
Jay-Zs 1997 debut. As his fame has
grown, so has his tendency to bring
more R&B production elements into
his work, creating a club-friendly,
danceable version of east coast
gangsta hip-hop that hasnt
diminished his reputation as a
preeminent force in rap. Perhaps
even more importantly, Jay-Z has
become a powerful music impresario.
In his role as president/CEO of Def
Jam in the early 2000s, he fostered
the careers of popular R&B singers
Rihanna and Ne-Yo, and marriage to
superstar Beyonce has further
endeared him to fans.
