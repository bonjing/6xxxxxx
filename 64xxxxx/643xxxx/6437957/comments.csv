,laned130,2011-11-22T15:05Z,"Thanks Pdid, that was really informative! I don't approve of the way dcd asked the question, but it is a valid question, and your reply just lowers you to his level!

There are actually some of us out here, who have always been curious... so if anyone knows?"
,Kinbakubi,2011-12-13T02:47Z,"Politely @laned130 and more condescendingly at @dcd018 for being such a twat about an extra 50kb file that you can uncheck for download... 
English subtitles are handy to include for at least a few reasons, the major one being for people that cannot hear. Yes, I imagine more than a few deaf people watch pirated movies and probably greatly appreciate anyone that includes subtitles. Matching them up is a real pain afterwards. 
They can also be handy for people learning English. I went to college with a guy from Chili that used them to learn from on the TV. 
Personally, I can hear just fine and butcher my native language quite well but even I have used them when I need to keep the sound down and putting on a pair of head phones would seem obviously rude. For me they are just a perk in a pinch but I can see the inconvenience it would be to not have them when you HAVE TO HAVE THEM. 
I will gladly download an English .srt anytime one is included."
