Laura Alice Rossella Pausini better known as Laura Pausini (Italian pronunciation: [pauËˆziËni]), omri, (born 16 May 1974, Solarolo, Province of Ravenna, Italy) is one of the most famous and successful Italian singer-songwriters worldwide. She signed to Warner Music Group since 1993. Dubbed the "Queen of Italian pop" by entertainment news outlets, Pausini is famed for her soulful voice and romantic ballads. She is also known for multilingual music productions that span five languagesâ€”her native Italian, Spanish, English, Portuguese and French.

Pausini debuted at the 43rd Annual Sanremo Music Festival in 1993. Her first place victory in the competition's New Talent division helped launch her music career in Europe. She tapped the hispanophone and lusophone markets in Ibero-America with crossover recordings. Since 1996, she has concurrently released Spanishâ€“language companion editions with her vernacular studio albumsâ€”"a practice that [has] come to define her career and compound her success". In 2001, she recapped eight years of success with a greatest hits album, issued in the two customary editionsâ€”Italian and Spanish. Following an English-language crossover attempt in 2002, Pausini returned with the galvanizing studio album Escucha (2004). The recording garnered a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album in 2006.

As of March 2009, Pausini maintains worldwide record sales in excess of 60 million. In 2004, with Pausini's sales tally at only 25 million, Allmusic's Jason Birchmeier considered this "an impressive feat for someone who'd never really broken into the lucrative Englishâ€“language market".
