Shigali takes possession of one piece of the Naag Mani from the Mandir of Naag Dev, but must locate the other one in order to be most powerful sorcerer in the world, and continues torturing the Senapati to force him to reveal it's whereabouts. Ten years later, Anjana is all set to take her kingdom back - but faces many obstacles - including endangering the lives of her sisters, Madhu and Rani, and her mother - who continue to be captives of the shape-shifting Shigali - who has no plans of surrendering this kingdom to anyone.
