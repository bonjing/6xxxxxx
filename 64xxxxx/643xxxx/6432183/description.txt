The Inbetweeners Series 1-3 boxset follows the often misguided footsteps of four friends, Will, Simon, Neil and Jay, as they try to navigate their way through sixth form, with their hormones running riot.

None of our heroes are exceptional, all are distinctly average: Will is constantly trying to raise their social standing, Simon is a hopeless romantic who is obsessed with schoolmate Carli, Neil is sometimes so slow it's more like owning a pet than having a friend, and Jay is a borderline sex pest constantly bragging about imaginary sexual experiences.
