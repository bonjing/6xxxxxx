Dirty Gold is Lincoln and John Ballif and Grant Nassif. Their music is inspired by the sounds of the 50s and 60s, eclectic global finds, and drippy guitar lines. Lincoln handles the vocals and lead guitar, John is the keyboardist and rhythm guitarist, and Grant is the drummer. The band started during the summer of 2010, but did not officially form until Grant joined in November. Dirty Gold signed to Autumn Tone Records in December, 2010. Dirty Gold released its first EP, ROAR, on April 11, 2011.
