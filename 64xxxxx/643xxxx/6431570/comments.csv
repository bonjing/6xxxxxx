Naah, it's not long and slow, it's beautiful! :D

Tarkovsky said that he usually makes the beginning extra boring in the first 20minutes so people can get away, so if one enjoy the beginning, it'll be better. And he usually filmed longer then necessary to avoid loosing too much stuff due to censoring.  An awesome director.

I'll seed long and hard. "
