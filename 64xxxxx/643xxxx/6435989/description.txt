I did somehow get it to work,I sort of took a trick from a forum to make dirt 3 dlc cars work and tried it with this

First open GFWL marketplace by itself and create a account

then go to games and download tinker(a free game)and install- you might as well download all free fable dlc again

once you got that, start tinker and set it to log in automatically with your legit account and then close tinker

Then go and open fable 3 and it should sign you it to the real account,but then it will want a key,ignore it by just 

hitting the home button and it should leave you logged into the account but you will be offline and fable 3 should be 

starting

you will have to start a new game but it the dlc will show up and the acheivments work too



If it keeps crashing the game just keep trying it,it took me a bunch of times to finally load up fable

also log out of GFWL marketplace before you start fable


unrar these files then move the folder to
owner/appdata/local/mircosoft/xlive/DLC/4d53090a/00000002 

I'm not sure if this will work but the free dlc works with this method so far.I have to beat the game to find out if this dlc works so I'll update everyone if it does
