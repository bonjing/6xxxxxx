,dkhere,2011-05-31T15:31Z,"@20-40: You mentioned that you will block the people who use 'uTorrent lower
than 1.8.3'.. Why is that?? Because i know some of my some friends who doesnt even know what 'version' means, especially girls..."
,dkhere,2011-05-31T15:39Z,"@20-40(from the above description): I know that we should all seed but there are some people like me who have only limited bandwidth for limited time... For me, i will get only 150kbps and that too from 2-8am IST... So i only give the upload speed upto 10kbps...
So what i would like to point out is please dont ban those guys doesnt know anything about torrents(including me)..."
,dkhere,2011-05-31T15:40Z,And thanks for the Scooby Doo cartoon...
,rojenatgmail,2011-05-31T15:52Z,@twentyforty I know I haven't commented in a while.. I have been regularly DLing and seeding and just wanted to thank you for work..
,rojenatgmail,2011-05-31T15:55Z,@20-40 I also wanted to ask if you're going to up Thor(2011) SCR or up anytime soon..
,Fangular,2011-05-31T16:10Z,"That's strange, dkhere, becasue every woman I know knows what the word 'version' means. Maybe you should hang out with a smarter crowd??"
,dkhere,2011-05-31T16:43Z,"@Fangular: :D... Lucky you, but i think its better to hangout with a bit less intelligent girls..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T16:53Z,"@dkere: Because 1.8.3 is highest version number which hackers modified to suck others dry and give shit to others.  ""Normal"" 1.8.3  and that patched/fucked 1.8.3  from Leechers Pack hardly can be differentiate. And as third - I am not alone: most of leechers-fuck-off-aware private trackers banned practically all torrent-programs which are ""tainted"" with ANY history of hacking and malfunctioning.

BitTornado is quite better replacement for older uTorrent and efficient as the sun. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T17:21Z,"differentiate = differentiated

Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T17:25Z,"""guys doesnt know anything about torrents""

Don't worry, therefore is written down in understandable form.

In short, I block leopards for bad behavior, not because of the spots."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T17:28Z,"@tpsk: Next week, Fantastic Four Duology. It cannot be sooner, because I have right now 14 torrents on waiting."
,t.trikiti,2011-05-31T17:59Z,thanks! thanks for each tv show!
,dkhere,2011-05-31T18:03Z,"@20-40: OMG! I didnt know that... Will check mine right now...
The problem is most of us dont read the description...Thanks for replying..."
,believenu,2011-05-31T18:19Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing.
I have all episodes of game of thrones 1-7 from you. would it be easier for me  to upload under believenu for everyone who missed or wait till you are able to do again.  "

[V],DownTYU,2011-05-31T18:53Z,"@tintinintibet

I have 99% of the file, when its done you will be able to play the file.

Sorry I remuxed the file ....you will be able to play the movie"
,jmac85,2011-05-31T19:19Z,"Crap, I don't have Avengers Eps 19-21...I must have been asleep! I'll try Scott & Bailey. Thank you for this pack and your continued patience with all the morons of the torrent world. [+1]"
,jmac85,2011-05-31T19:26Z,"Also, would anyone be interested in the original Danish version of 'The Killing'? Called Forbrydelsen. I have all 20 episodes of Season One (not my encodes) and can post it to FileServe. They're x264 encoded, 700 kbit video, 96 kbit AAC, 640x360 res, 25 fps. All are about 310-330 MiB.

Not trying to offend anyone or step on toes here...please say so if I am and I'll forget I ever had the idea."
,Castiell,2011-05-31T19:35Z,thank you for all your uploads man.. if its not too much to ask is it possible to upload the shows as a whole season?? cos u provide one o the best picture quality and am jus not able to find a show as a whole.. thank you..
,jmac85,2011-05-31T19:37Z,"Adding to my previous comment:
They also are in MP4 container and have hard-coded English subtitles. If I get more than a few bites and no objections I'll probably do it.

Sorry to hijack this thread."
,DMVIN,2011-05-31T19:58Z,thanks
,the_shroud,2011-06-01T04:38Z,Thank you for BK
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T07:19Z,"Nope. Explained thousand times:

""     720p = for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV and movies) frame-size is 640p or 1120x640
             (because of my own limit of 1400 MB per encode)  
             or 1216x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR),
             hardware intensive
             NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.
             Official 1280x720 frame-size is - simple - and - plain - WRONG.
             90% of encodes follow that wrong ""standard"" for years,
             what leads to unimaginable volume of ""squashed"" objects and people.
             Look any circular, well known object, not people, because human eyes
             can easily be tricked.
             Look at examples
             1280x720
http://bayimg.com/PaEOfaADH
             and my 1216x720 (I go even as ""low"" as 704 pixels, if needed.
http://bayimg.com/pAEoHaadh
             Use own eyes, please.  ""

in every Long header, daily.

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T07:21Z,^^^^ Wrong thread. Sorry.
