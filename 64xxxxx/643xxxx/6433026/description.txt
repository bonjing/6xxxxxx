     So this film is bigging itself up for being shot in one       
     continuous take and having Gremlin Zack Gallican in it...        
     Looks fairly shit to me but hey its only 1hour 10 mins long      
     so gonna kill some time if ur into shit acting and 'novel'       
     budget horror films (whilst watching the docus on the dvd        
     it would seem that it was intended to have this look...)         
     Dunno why this turned into such a rant - not really got        
      anything against this film - Enjoy :D
