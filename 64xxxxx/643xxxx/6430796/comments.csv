,dkl415,2011-10-09T19:10Z,"I downloaded the torrent no problem, and am trying to transfer it from my desktop to laptop. I have ~300gigs free on my external hard drive, but when I try copying the files, I get an error message that the .xml file is too large to be transferred. Any suggestions?"
,claycad,2011-10-14T14:55Z,"@dlk415 you are probably copying the file onto a hard drive that is formatted in FAT32. On FAT32 formatted drives you can only copy files that are 4GB or smaller. You can reformat the drive to NTFS on windows, but reformatting erases everything on the drive so back it up first. You could also zip the file in such a way that it breaks it into parts so that each part is less than 4GB then copy each part to the external then copy to laptop then unzip and recombine each part (assuming your laptop has an NTSF drive, which if its running windows it probably does. If you have a Mac you could probably do the same thing, but I don't know much about mac file systems."
