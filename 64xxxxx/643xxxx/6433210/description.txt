Notes:

 - Reseed/mirror; not my encode. Used to be here long ago, I found it elsewhere, so I've brought it back. Won 1941 Best Art Direction Oscar. The audio bitrate is a little low, but it's still a good enough encode to be enjoyable.
 
 - Please make sure to seed as much as you download and do your part so that free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to at least 101%, no torrent would ever die.
