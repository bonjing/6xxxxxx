*******

Really? what gives you this impression. Is it because some CRAP piece of software wasn't allowing u to d/l? 
Or (most likely),

U got your panties in a bind cuz u couldn't watch this and decided to make a fool of yourself by planting the word FAKE !  for every1 of us with a hint of brain matter to LAUGH AT U!"

,Axel_D,2011-06-13T03:54Z,"@BlaTaN

Considering what networks I see blocked I wouldn't get so high on my horse if I were you... just a thought... /Sony and similar >.>/
150 peers connected and the speed is somewhere 30-80 kb/s ... definitely looks like a botnet >.>

There are several points one should realise before acting all 1337 and stupid: Recent events have proven that hunting for users helps... users and customers may protest, but no one really cares. Also... monitoring torrent activity doesn't have to be the fault of the uploader OR the tracker... anyone can do it... and I'm rather sure that uploads like this one with 1000 +/- peers are more interesting than those with fewer ones. So please grow up and shove your e-penis somewhere. "
