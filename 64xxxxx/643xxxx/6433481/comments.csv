NFO:
PoleSmokers is proud to present the 2011 PokÎ¸mon Distribution Cart!!

To bring in the new year, we decided to give all of our fans a nice and early present.
We bring none other thanâ€¦â€¦the 2011 PokÎ¸mon Distribution!!!!!! As everybody already
knows, GameStop has parterned up with Nintendo to bring you THREE Shiny PokÎ¸mon!!!!
Well, here is the cart that they use to distribute them with. Below are the dates.
Just set your DSâ€™ system time to be within the range, and your DS will be set up to
distribute PokÎ¸mon to other DSâ€™s!!!

So after looking into this a bit, I noticed two things. The first, is that the dates that
GameStop/Nintendo give, are off by one day (their ending dates). Here are the dates you
need to set your DS to in order to be able to distribute the PokÎ¸mon (in MM/DD/YY format)

Shiny Raikou: now* â€“ 01/10/11
Shiny Entei: 01/17/11 â€“ 01/24/11
Shiny Suicune: 01/31/11 â€“ 02/07/11

*For the Shiny Raiku, todayâ€™s date worked just fine, but a date in 2006 did not. I do not know
the full range, but youâ€™re fine through the 10th.

The second thing I noticed was that there are actually FOUR Shiny PokÎ¸mon on here!!!!!
This was not announced with the GameStop/Nintendo promotion, so it is an extra gift
for the new year. I can only assume this will be to hype up the Black/White releases.
So, without further adieu, I give youâ€¦..

Shiny Celebi: 02/27/11 â€“ 03/07/11

Happy New Years from your friends at PoleSmokers."
