Please inform me if there is a problem!"
,Orbnotacus,2011-05-31T22:55Z,"Well this is the only torrent I've come across that when I click download, it takes me to an error 404 page (not found) and I'm sure you, like everyone else uploading the ""complete"" season 7, is NOT including the SEASON FINALE!!! 2hr special the aired last night!!! (the 30th) SOMEONE UPLOAD E24!!!"
,Orbnotacus,2011-05-31T23:49Z,"Ughh... disregard my previous comment... FOX needs to get their shit together... On THIER website it said 2hr House season finale playing the 30th... and of coarse, now it doesn't... my bad..."
