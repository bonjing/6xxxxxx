,mak_wolverine,2011-12-21T18:31Z,"Thanks to ""FatFreddy69"" for such a nice torrent. 5 stars!!! Thanks for the ""mkvmerge"" tool for muxing the audio and video. After downloading your torrent, I was shocked to see the audio not working for Prince Caspian, but after getting the tool in your comments section, I was relieved and things worked out nice!!! Really good quality.  5 stars for you!! :)"
