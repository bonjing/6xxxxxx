Neuxpower NXPowerLite 4.3.1 for File Server

NXPowerLite for File Servers attacks file bloat at the core, reducing Microsoft Office and JPEG file sizes by up to 95%. It analyzes the content on your server and replaces any bloated files with smaller, optimized versions. And, as optimized files don't need to be decompressed or rehydrated, there's no negative effect on system performance.

Files remain in their original format, retaining all their attributes and visual content integrity â€“ they look and function identically to the originals, but are much smaller!

Configuration
Select which folders and file types to optimize, choose your settings and schedule when the software runs. Older files can be optimized using more aggressive settings, for even greater savings.

Mode
Choose whether to analyze or optimize. In 'Analysis mode', NXPowerLite will produce a report showing current storage usage and expected savings. In 'Optimization mode', NXPowerLite will optimize your files, replacing the originals with the optimized versions.

Status
Start, stop or pause the current job with a single click. When running, this section also displays current progress and estimated time to completion. Information is broken down by file type, so you can see which of your applications are generating the most bloated files.
