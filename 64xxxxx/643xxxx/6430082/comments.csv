,apple016,2011-05-28T22:44Z,"dude one simple thing im missing ur lilbit low size uploads.
im so f@&ked."
,_Dux,2011-05-29T16:50Z,"I agree with apple016, is there any chance you'll do another one of those good old low size/excellent quality uploads?

Don't get me wrong, the ~2GB quality is supreme, but there are so many rippers who are doing movies in that size and very few who do it in low size but with good quality..."
,apple016,2011-05-29T19:47Z,"im not saying that reduced size to 400-500 mb.but 800mb -1.3 gb will be good. 
ahhh whatever its just a advice."
[V],prashant22,2011-05-30T06:33Z,guys i appreciate ur advice but i m really sorry i will be only doing the bigger sized encodes..but i'll try to upload some small ones randomly...
