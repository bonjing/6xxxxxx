,Koopasa,2012-02-04T05:45Z,This torrent is being watched for pirating. Received an email notice from NBC Universal. FYI
,sanitysama,2012-05-24T11:23Z,"as of right now and despite the misleading amount of seeds, there is no one seeding this torrent who has it completed at 100%. don't waste your time here. it's a year old. ignore this hash code. this torrent is dead."
