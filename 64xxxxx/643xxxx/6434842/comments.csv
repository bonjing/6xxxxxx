,Zanda777,2011-07-04T13:39Z,"@Neo

Get over yourself, the movie isn't out on DVD yet, you could wait till then and surely you'll have to quality you desire. Otherwise quit whining."
,serenidad_777,2011-08-22T00:19Z,"This move is quite funny. However, the picture and sound is not that great. This movie is a recording from a movie theater.  a woman stands up in it at least twice. Sorry I will not be seeding this one. I always seed, but I can't. "
