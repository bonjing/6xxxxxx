Rampage is a 1987 movie directed by William Friedkin. It was filmed in Stockton, California, in 1986 and received nationwide American release in 1992.



Plot :



Alex McArthur plays a serial killer named Charles Reece, who commits a number of brutal mutilation-slayings in order to drink blood as a result of paranoid delusions.

Reece is soon captured. Most of the movie revolves around the trial and the prosecutor's attempts to have Reece found sane and given the death penalty. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity.

The prosecutor, Anthony Fraser (played by michael Biehn), was previously against capital punishment, but he seeks such a penalty in the face of Reeces brutal crimes after meeting one victims grieving family.

In the end, Reece is found sane and given the death penalty, but Fraser's internal debate about capital punishment is rendered academic when Reece is found to be insane by a scanning of his brain for mental illness


Legally :


Rampage delves into the subject of legal insanity, so often the default defense in modern-time gruesome crime trials. Alex McArthur plays an outwardly normal guy who goes on incredible killing and mutilating sprees until (and even after, when he escapes for a short time) he's captured. When he comes to trial, the liberal DA (Michael Biehn) is torn between his own leftist leanings and the reality of the heinous crimes for which the accused is being tried. He must argue for the death penalty. 

Influences:

Charlie Reece is loosely based on the real-life serial killer Richard Chase.[1] The crimes that Reece commits are slightly different from those that Chase committed, however; Reece kills three women, a man, and a young boy, whereas Chase killed two men, two women (one of whom was pregnant), a young boy, and a 22-month-old baby. Additionally, Reece escapes at one point, murdering two guards and later a priest, which Chase did not do in real life. However, Reece and Chase were similar in that they both had a history of mental illness and an obsession with drinking blood. Like Reece, Chase was also sentenced to death, but he committed suicide before the sentence could be carried out.



Its a great film, not for the downhearted, viewer discretion advised.
