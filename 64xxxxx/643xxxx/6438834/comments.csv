the quality is awful."
[T],winto_bungle,2011-06-18T18:52Z,@aJrenalin - nonsense. this the is best quality of the album i could get. ONE track (apple orange) is 83kbps for some reason but all of the others the minimum is 169kbps with the average being about 171kbps. i just checked them all. why do some people feel the need to lie about something that has cost them fuck all?
