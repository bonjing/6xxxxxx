Description

CreaVures is a platformer set in a magical forest. You play as five different "CreaVures," tiny mythical creatures that each have a unique natural ability, to be used alone or in tandem to solve platforming puzzles. Ultimately your CreaVures must travel deep into the dying forest to gather essence and restore the light.
