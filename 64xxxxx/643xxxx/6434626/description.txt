Gundam Musou 3(ã‚¬ãƒ³ãƒ€ãƒ ç„¡åŒ3 Gandamu MusÅ SurÄ«, Known in its US release as Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3 ) is the third title within the Dynasty Warriors Gundam series. Unlike the first two titles, this game strives for a cel-animation motif and is created to look more like the anime series. Visuals are completely revamped with brighter and flashier effects. The producer remarks these measures were taken due to fan response, hoping to create a title appealing to more Gundam fans. It was developed by Koei and published by Namco Bandai, and the sequel to 2008's Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2. [1]
