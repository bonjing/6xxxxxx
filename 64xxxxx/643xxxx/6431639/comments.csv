,Pinkbits101,2011-05-30T10:43Z,twentyforty.. thanks for your tireless efforts on here. I am ashamed for doing this to you for the last 2yrs hitting and running but i had no choice. i just wanted to write here and tell you keep doing what ur doing cause everything you do on here is worth it. the reason i hit and run is cause i was paying over $100 dollars for 10gbs on usb bs plan which my isp was rorting. thanks again for keeping me entertained and im sure for many more times to come. i have always had a account here to login but i never use it cause its just way too easy to hit and run here but for everyone that uploads and seeds i thank you very much. pls keep up the good work. This should be a testament to all you faggots out there that hit a minus on this awesome bloke. my one and only comment on this site and this is dedicated to you twentyforty..and no i wont suck your cock! LOL peace bro!
