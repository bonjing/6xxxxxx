One of the most anticipated treats on the BBCâ€™s holiday broadcast schedule is the return of Upstairs Downstairs, the Edwardian era miniseries that ran and ran on Masterpiece Theatre. The new three-parterâ€”which premieres in the U.S. in April on MASTERPIECE on PBSâ€”takes up the story in 1936, a bumpy year in British history. Parlormaid Rose finds herself back at 165 Eaton Place serving as housekeeper to its new owners: Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppardâ€”yes Tom Stoppardâ€™s son) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes, MI-5, Wives & Daughters). Reprising her role as Rose is co-creator Jean Marsh (Sense & Sensibility), who won an Emmy for her work in the original series. This time around series co-creator Dame Eileen Atkins (Cranford, Gosford Park) also has an onscreen part to play: as Hallamâ€™s formidable mother, Maud. Per Radio Times, even Wallis Simpson will swan through the action. Fingers crossed that BBC will commission more.
