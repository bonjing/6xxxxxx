,testor1140,2011-05-30T23:42Z,"theres only 3 episodes in whole series?
perhaps ""Season 1"" more accurate?"
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-05-31T00:49Z,No dipstick. There is no plan to make any more than the 3 produced last year so it is right to refer to it as a complete series.
,boredfist,2011-12-13T21:28Z,"This is complete series SIX (The brits tend to call them ""series"" instead of ""seasons"".) and it really has only three episodes.
Series 1-5 are from the seventies and can be found as a different torrent."
,solitarybelle,2012-02-05T08:16Z,Actually.. they are planning on doing a 2nd series this year.
