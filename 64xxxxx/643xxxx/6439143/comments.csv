,LucidMind,2011-07-12T01:07Z,"I'm having the same problem, none of the fixes suggested have worked. Can anyone help?"
,Werewolf80,2011-07-12T20:15Z,"Thank you for sharing...awesome 

now i just have to learn more about this version..

it works for me. 

I disable The update service and update servicemanager.

But the Update manager is starting every time u start the CS5. i guess u dont need to disable that. Disable Only Update service at startup will be enough. Do this before u enter the serials...

i hope this would help...."
,LucidMind,2011-07-12T23:37Z,"Thanks Werewolf80 , but can you tell me how to disable it? Thank you xx"
,JohnnyAction,2011-07-16T15:51Z,Worked for me.  Thanks.
,Creshendo,2011-07-18T01:59Z,"When the extended trial window pops up and i enter the serial that works fine but the next part is the problem. Why the hell does it keep asking me to enter my adobe id? Even when i do it says it's unable to start my subscription. 

How do i get past that bullshit? "

,Sagiy20,2011-07-22T01:47Z,"Hey, everybody,

No need for anything more then just the right serial key!
And the program itself of course.

Download the trail, 
then use this:

Name: tam/CORE Serial: 1330-1934-1867-1573-8406-7682"
,ryanwm,2011-07-22T14:03Z,"@Sagiy20 
THANK YOU! that solution worked, it works fine for me now :D thank you thank you thank you! :) "
,ricco318,2011-07-23T07:22Z,none of the above worked for me
,kkiizzuu,2011-07-23T19:59Z,"Doing everything right but after i enter coode it keeps asking for account ID and when i enter it says invalid n cant continue ,  anyone know the solution ? x.x"

,jellyrcw11,2011-07-29T20:10Z,"Okay everyone listen 
1st go to 
http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop
And download Photoshop

Next: 
When it acts you for the serial code use the one provided by Sagiy20 

And CLICK SKIP on the making an account part

Now just wait for it to download and you're done simple as that "
,guitargraham,2011-07-29T21:38Z,There is no repeat NO skip option. Why have you got a different screen to every one else.
,guitargraham,2011-07-29T21:41Z,Werewolf80 it would help if we knew how to disable the update manager.Why put on solutions and dont explain?do you think we are all psychic?
,KriticKilled,2011-08-04T04:31Z,"I did exactly what jellyrcw11 and used the name and serial Sagiy20 gave and it worked perfectly.

You have to create an Adobe account though.  I just used an old email that I never use and a fake name for it.

Thanks for y'alls help you two."
,skribent,2011-08-04T21:08Z,Sorry. But sagyi20 serial code don't work anymore
,Leviathan454,2011-08-05T06:20Z,Try this: 1330-1363-1206-9398-1328-8912
,skribent,2011-08-05T19:51Z,Thank you Leviathan454! I think this time it worked for me all the way to Denmark.

,Bromandude,2011-10-08T09:16Z,"What am i doing wrong?
I go to the adobe site, i download Photoshop. I login to my fake Adobe account. Then i put the 
""1330-1934-1867-1573-8406-7682"" code Saigy20 posted. It installs, but when i open it it says trial is expired and wants a new code. Codes i put ask for Adobe account and do not work.....What is the Name ""Tam/Core"" Thing Saigy20 said? Where do i put that.
