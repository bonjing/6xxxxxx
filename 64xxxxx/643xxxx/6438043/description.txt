Pep Squad (1998) 
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0131534/

Written and directed by first-time filmmaker Steve Balderson, Pep Squad is a colourful, shocking and generally amusing comedy set in the brutal realm of modern high school. The mania begins as soon as several girls are nominated for prom queen, with one notable exception â€“ the hateful and despicable Cherry has not been nominated, and man, is she angry. Cherry takes to murdering a handful of the candidates, while a trio of relatively â€œnormalâ€ teens finds itself embroiled in a web of unrelated kidnapping, murder and basic teenage mischief.

Beth, Julie, and Scott have the school principal bound and gagged in their basement, the result of the vile educatorâ€™s licentious advances on Beth. Unfortunately, a truly bizarre prom queen candidate named Terra (Scott refers to her as the worldâ€™s most absurd person) has witnessed the crime, and promptly blackmails her way into the twisted proceedings. Julie decides to hire Cherry to kill Terra, partially because Cherryâ€™s been murdering people left and right, anyway and partially because Cherry hates Terra. (Several of the movieâ€™s more entertaining moments come as profane and insane screaming matches between Cherry and Terra.) 

On a technical level, Pep Squad is quite impressive â€“ especially considering the relatively meagre budget the filmmakers had to work with. As a director, Balderson keeps things moving along at a brisk pace and youâ€™d be hard pressed to find another low-budget movie that crams in as much off-kilter colour as Pep Squad does. For the most part, the cast is a pleasant surprise as well; Brooke Baldersonâ€™s rabid performance as Cherry could sear the paint off your walls (thatâ€™s a compliment), and the lovely Summer Makovkin (as Julie) delivers a smart, sexy performance as well. The highlight of the cast is Amy Kelly as Terra, an actress who seems to think sheâ€™s playing Divine in a John Waters-directed biopic. Kellyâ€™s performance is strange, obnoxious and over-the-top hilarious. 

If you were under the impression that topics like pedophilia, kidnapping, mass murder, and teenagers blowing each other away with shotguns are â€œtoo realâ€ for comedy, then itâ€™s too bad that nobody told Steve Balderson. Pep Squad rockets from shock to jolt to outright assault, never once pausing to apologize, and the result is a solid little â€œsick jokeâ€ of a comedy, one that would never be released by a â€œnormalâ€ studio (seeing as how the big studios generally like their black comedies to come â€œalready evisceratedâ€ a la Jawbreaker or Teaching Mrs. Tingle). 

Much like those really nasty jokes you reserve for only your closest friends, Pep Squad will probably be most appreciated by those with an open mind and a penchant for sick humour that knows no boundaries. If this movie doesnâ€™t offend the living hell out of you, I bet youâ€™ll have a ball with it.
