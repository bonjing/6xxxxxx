I've attempted to increase quality, but without help from people from VTV, EZTV or similar, I'm unable to replicate their quality."

,vespadelus,2011-06-01T15:19Z,"Yep, quality is fine. Much better than the pilot! Thanks mate."
,thefly42,2011-06-06T14:28Z,Quality was great. The effort to improve it is much appreciated. No need to try to improve as far as I am concerned.
