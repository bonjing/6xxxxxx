TI RomPack

This is an almost-complete collection of ROM files for the TI-8x/Z80 line of Texas Instruments graphing calculators, for use with a compatible calculator emulator.

The following is a list of the included ROM files, their version numbers, and filenames.

TI-73

ti73.rom

TI-82
ROM Version: 18.0
ti82.rom

TI-83
ROM Version: 1.07000
ti83.rom

TI-83 Plus

ROM Version: 9.0
ti85.rom

***NOTE: The only missing model is the TI-84 Plus. However, the TI-84 Plus Silver Edition is basically the same (except the Silver Edition has 3x more memory).
Functionally, they are virtually the same.

To use these ROMs, you will need a TI-8x/Z80 emulator. I recommend TilEm, which is capable of emulating all of the above calculator ROMs.
***NOTE: Currently, only TilEm is capable of emulating the TI-84 Plus and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition.

The Windows version can be downloaded here:

The Linux version can be downloaded here:

Follow the included directions in the TilEm package's README file.

Another popular emulator is Virtual TI. It can emulate all the above, except for the 84 Plus series (see above). Additionally, it has some problems with flash memory emulation on the TI-83 Plus. Download it here:

Have fun with these ROMs...
I believe this is probably the first torrent of calculator ROMs.
