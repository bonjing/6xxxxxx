,lazarusperik,2011-06-01T16:04Z,"Win32.Vitro is quite dangerous trojan virus. Just like trojan Vundo and Zlob, Win32.Vitro can be obtained by visiting various noxious websites. Mainly, Win32.Vitro is promoted on websites that offer free online movies. In order to watch those movies visitor has to download certain video codec. However, it's not a real video codec, but trojan Win32.Vitro. Once active, Win32.Vitro performs various misleading actions. It downloads and installs additional malware and spyware without user's permission. What is more, it advertises rogue anti-spyware applications such as Antivirus 360 and System Protector. Win32.Vitro must be removed at earliest stage, because removal delay will cause even more damage to the system. "

Once you've signed in, there will be a little search box in the top left corner, click on it and type Hunted. Press enter and it will open a new window in the middle (or at least change the existing mirror).
Once you do THAT find the ""Hunted: The Demons Forge"" room and enter it. Once you're in on the top left corner you will see a question mark (?).

As with most RPGs, this game is very linear, and the gameplay functions are somewhat easy to understand after you play around with them for awhile.

The game may seem to not start, but it's actually loading. I suggest going away somewhere (maybe cook something) for 10 minutes and come back. By then, the game will be up and running and you'll be excited with your bowl of who knows what the hell you decided to make. 

Happy pirating."

Ignore the n00bz on here screaming about how the game is shitty.  I've seeded regardless of issues for a couple weeks now and uploaded the game 3x over.

I did read your specs, and the point I was making is, that YOU had something wrong with what you were doing, because my computer could do it easily, and it's a 2+ year old cpu.
And Crysis 2? Really, your bragging about that? The game was easy as shit to run on high.

I've played a few hours and must say I'm a bit disappointed. The whole thing is pretty cliché, including the characters and their personalities, and I expected more from Bethesda. It's not a bad game, but it doesn't really present anything new, either. Overall, I'd give it  6.5 / 10"

Please take time to read the notepad document that is provided with the ISO files. It clearly says to find the crack within the 2nd disk and copy it into the game directory. There is NO password being asked for anything and the only problem you may run into is a false positive virus indication. Mcafee users won't have any way to work around it and will have to shut off Real-time scanning so that the exe will work.

If your getting a prompt asking for code it means your EXE file was quarantined by virus protection. Don't be stupid. Research. Green skull means uploader is good."
,GR3YSTONE,2011-07-02T07:53Z,"A second note to anyone with EXE problems because of McAfee, there is a second crack that can be found by using google and searching ""Hunted demons forge no cd"" and selecting the link provided by GameCopyWorld - and that isn't blocked by virus protection. The notepad document within the rar file is in german but the EXE is a Multi Language crack that works for the english version too. Enjoy."

Avoid the crack on the second disc and get one from somewhere else."
,willpants,2011-07-05T20:06Z,"Actually I'll correct that, I do know why the installer is infected, and that's because the uploader didn't even know it.  The vitro virus is polymorphic and it only becomes visible to the virusguard when it tries to inject one of your exes.

Commercial virusguards like Mcaffee and Norton don't catch this thing.  Avast and AVG do.

And before you talk about crappy free virusguards.  I have a friend who has had two ruined windows installs because of this thing.  Everyone who used the crack that shipped with this torrent are infected whether they know it or not."

Dont be stupid, it's common knowledge that all the paid virus softwares gets updated first, your free AVG, Avast or whatever you use adds new defs sometimes weeks after I got them.
Stop thinking your freeware is the best only because you use it, freeware is shitware.

I'm using F-Secure, only time I had a virus was back in 94 when I discovered I had Win95.cih, and once in 1982 but that was completly harmless.

The 2 protagonists are all the game's got going for it, in my opinion. They're not flawless, and lack depth because of the game's overall plotline and structure that doesn't allow it, but they're well voiced and very likable. Feels like they're wasted on this."
