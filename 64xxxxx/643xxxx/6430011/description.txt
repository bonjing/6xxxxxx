Six albums, 2000-2008, by unique dark electronic project, yendri. I pulled this off another site, it was almost extinct, took forever to complete, but some kind seeder brought it back to life long enough for me to snag it. 
I want to keep it going myself here now.

One album seems to be very poorly ripped, nothing I can do about it, it be listenable, just has a little static on the bass.

Now go buy the new album or she will put pins in my voodoo doll for posting this!
Actually I don't feel completely evil, those old albums are almost impossible to buy anywhere.
