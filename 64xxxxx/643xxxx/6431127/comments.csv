,ilkrisbo,2011-05-29T10:14Z,thanks for uploading ufc 130 in high definition thanks :)
,Bessarro,2011-05-29T14:39Z,"thx dude but that barley passes for hi-def, and the framerate is poor"
,HoM3R,2011-05-29T14:52Z,"Its a hd rip from internet stream it looks like but doesnt look like 720p quality.
Does look better then the normal avi rips though! thanks"
,scrp,2011-05-29T15:47Z,low framerates on this one.
,cres222222,2011-05-29T18:07Z,"No offence to the upper (thanks for uploading and being part of the community) but this is not a great rip.
Media controls of the ripper are on screen throughout the whole event, framerate is low and not well encoded. 

You would be better off with a good 1.4GB AVI rip than waiting for this 6.5GB rip"
,ujio,2011-05-29T18:43Z,Is AAF gonna release this in 720p? if so ill wait for that
,banman,2011-05-30T17:46Z,"Very very big size, and really bad picture quality. The sound sounds like a radio in a card box. A really bad piece of work. Unfortunately"
