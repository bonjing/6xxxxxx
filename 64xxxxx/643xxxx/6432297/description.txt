                Series about a murder investigated by both sides of
                the line, cops and criminals, and the opposing
                methods they use to solve it. But the real line is
                the morality within each character and how far they
                will go before they cross it. Jay Wratten's
                insistence that Bob Harris is responsible for his
                uncle's murder causes problems for Bede's new
                business deal. Meanwhile Gabriel struggles to placate
                his ex-mistress and Gatehouse shows he'll go to great
                lengths to find Glickman.
