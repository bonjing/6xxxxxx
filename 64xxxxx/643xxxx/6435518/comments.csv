,pirateYoho,2011-07-31T06:19Z,"cyberpirate - u seem to be ok :) still waiting for the first guys comments about quality ..haha!

im in budapest and a guy just walked up to me speaking a foreign language and showed me this huge gash in his arm, the dude really needed a hospital and stiches but he just wanted to use my phone to call his friend, and he was just wrapping his arm in some old dirty shirt (as if that was really going to help the 4inch open wound that was leaking fat and muscle out of his skin) i called his friend for him and his was happy with that.. and i shook his hand and walked away.. felt weird about it, wouldve liked to advise him about the need for medical attention but he didnt speak english.. 
  what a crazy world!  oh yeah thanks for the up!
 helpin' people helpin' people  ..love the modern day pirates!"
,Jonathan0007,2011-08-01T02:26Z,"first: DANKE!

second: episode 14 & 16 are from Season 3, not Season 4.

The two missing episodes are however available on this platform, downloading will need only a couple minutes."

,mrug1512,2012-04-17T20:19Z,"Why downloaded files are named as  ""xxx.avi.part"" ?

Are they full episodes or just quick browses? 

I just renamed files to loose "".part"" and when played "".avi"" -- they play only highlights of episode and not full episodes.

 I see good ratings above for this torrent quality, Is it something missed on myside ?"
,MrEdTheHorse,2012-05-04T15:48Z,Jonathan0007 is wrong.  Episodes 14 and 16 are correct for this season.  Download with confidence.
