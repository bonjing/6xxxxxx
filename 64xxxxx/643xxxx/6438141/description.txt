The More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

Part Seven

What's This?
     It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.

This seventh alphabetical installment is: As-Bh (Skipping Batman, which is next)

Here's some things that are not new to this series in this torrent, but I have not commented on them previously.

	In this set we have a couple of titles DC published as CMX. These were manga translated from the Japanese. As we proceed though this project you will find that some of the CMX titles are scans of the CMX edition, but many are scans of other english editions or scanlations from the Japanese originals. Lots of CMX is apparently unscanned. Scanlations are comics that were scanned in one language, and then had the text replaced with another language using photoshop or the like. This is all volunteer work. It's true the translators sometimes lack sufficient fluency on both languages, and apparently don't always have it proofed by a native speaker of the new language to check for grammar, correct word usage and order, and the like. So sometimes the english in these is a bit odd. But I can't thank these hard working people enough. This is a lot more work than just scanning, and creates something that can't be bought. Naturally this is not done if a commercial translation exists. The scanlations I include were done before CMX. It's not only manga that has been done, but it is probably all that will appear in this series unless I can find some scanlations of some of the DC-Humanoids titles that are not scanned.
	Now a word about stories from the UK series 2000AD, which is not published in the US. DC made a deal to publish collections of some of these. These are mostly if not entirely unscanned. However the same or similar collections are published in the UK and I will hopefully track those down as a substitute for the US editions. I can't guarantee what I find will be the same content as I have no access to the US versions. So far it looks like I can find large sets (often compiled by scanners from 200AD) that are likely to be more than the US versions, or sets of the same title I hope are the same.
	Lastly, I want to mention Zudacomics.com This was DC's short lived web comics effort. Some were cancelled midstory, Some were never more than the beginning of a story to be voted on by the readers. Winners got paid to make more. I include all that I can find in this series as I do everything else DC.
	
	The next three torrents were planned to be titles beginning with Batman. This is not always the same as titles that say Batman on the cover. There are some titles that begin with something else when you look in the indica.
	I am considering combining these into one large torrent. That would be about 44gb. Thoughts anyone? Should I go for one Batman torrent or 3 or 2??


Today's offering: As-Bh (Skipping Batman, which is next)
DC vs other companies related work should be labeled on each folder. No label means DC. Hopefully I go them all correctly labeled.
