              Release Information





System Center Service Manager 2010, a new addition

to the System Center suite of products, delivers an

integrated platform for automating and adapting IT

Service Management best practices to your

organization's requirements.



Service Manager provides built-in processes based

on industry best practices for incident and problem

resolution, change control, and asset lifecycle

management. Through its configuration management

database (CMDB) and process integration, Service

Manager automatically connects knowledge and

information from System Center Operations Manager,

System Center Configuration Manager, and Active

Directory Domain Services.



By orchestrating and unifying the knowledge across

the System Center suite, Service Manager helps IT

continuously adapt to new business requirements

while reducing cost, lowering time to resolution,

and helping to align IT to the business.
