,D3M0N1NMYH34D,2011-05-31T03:30Z,Didn't work for me.
,bglamb,2011-05-31T19:06Z,"So this has been broken down into a 30 part rar, and then each of those has been put into its own zip file?

Did you let your f-cking cat upload this or something?"
,jermonio,2011-06-01T12:34Z,"There's a missing or corrput rar file! When I try to extract I get a winrar error window saying that I need volume ""xxx"".r00 and even if I try to rename it manually, it keeps asking for the missing rar."

,Mantisa,2011-06-01T19:13Z,"Yeah I got the same as @Jermonio.
What to do?"
,Metalsand,2011-06-02T09:13Z,But wh....why would you zip the rar files?  There is no more file compression...
,dmunchyld,2011-06-02T23:50Z,"The trick here is to select all zip files, right click and extract THEN find the .rar file and extract it. Job done. Thanks for the up!"
,quetoop,2011-06-03T15:09Z,"Thanks for the upload, it works but, why use the 30 part compression? Its really confusing and kinda pointless."
,Trinexx56,2011-06-03T18:58Z,You are a turd for double-compressing this.
,Septagram,2011-06-03T20:03Z,"Wow, this is the fucking best way to upload I've ever seen... OMG, Captain Obvious just had a heart attack :D"
,joolsie,2011-06-07T14:15Z,It keeps telling me i need a specific amount of volume D: help please?
,Turcca,2011-06-12T11:16Z,"Installs great, tutorial works. But when I'm starting a campaign, it hangs while loading the first map, at

,mw2pro123,2011-06-20T07:50Z,"thanks dude, your torrents own as allways"
,nikrusty,2011-06-24T10:17Z,"yeah funnily when using WINRAR, you gotta right-click select all the zip files and then uncompress them and then you have to uncompress the rar files (by selecting any one). Not the uploaders fault but plain silly design!"
,ogrexg,2011-07-05T22:15Z,I hate complaining about free stuff but the uploader needs to learn how to zip files properly. Other than that thanks...
,ChokoMon,2011-07-06T19:51Z,Can play @internet or @Hamachi ?

,a1s,2011-10-09T04:06Z,"Rars *inside* zips? This isn't ""scene"", this is Trolling. With a capital T. I'd like to inform you that I will not seed (anymore). Good day."
,b34rh34d,2011-10-18T23:03Z,Could someone explain to me why there are 41 RARs which all look to be exactly the same thing? I've had this before with other games and only ever needed to extract the first one... so what's the point of the other 40? Sorry if this is a noob question. Thanks
,107558,2011-10-23T22:50Z,"no, you have to select all of the initial zips, right click and select extract HERE, then you select all the new rars, and do the same thing, and when you run the instal (unl-frsy.exe) select a new folder to instal the game into. really not that complicated."
,107558,2011-10-23T22:52Z,"oh, and nice speed on the torrent, game works great :D. nice job, i appriciate people like you."

,CaptainTannen,2012-01-07T08:28Z,Why in the world did you compress it like that?
,Omariio,2012-01-16T00:10Z,Why hide the rar archive in zipped parts? No needs for it really.
