Deep Purple survived a seemingly endless series of lineup changes
and a dramatic mid-career shift from grandiose progressive rock to
ear-shattering heavy metal to emerge as a true institution of the
British hard rock community; once credited in the Guinness Book of
World Records as the globe's loudest band, their revolving-door
roster launched the careers of performers including Ritchie
Blackmore, David Coverdale, and Ian Gillan

Deep Purple was formed in Hertford, England, in 1968, with an
inaugural lineup that featured guitarist Blackmore, vocalist Rod
Evans, bassist Nick Simper, keyboardist Jon Lord, and drummer Ian
Paice. Initially dubbed Roundabout, the group was first assembled
as a session band for ex-Searchers drummer Chris Curtis but quickly
went their own way, touring Scandinavia before beginning work on
their debut LP, Shades of Deep Purple. The most pop-oriented
release of their career, the album generated a Top Five American
hit with its reading of Joe South's Hush but otherwise went
unnoticed at home. The Book of Taliesyn followed (in the U.S. only)
in 1969, again cracking the U.S. Top 40 with a cover of Neil
Diamond's Kentucky Woman

With their self-titled third LP, Deep Purple's ambitions grew
however; the songs reflecting a new complexity and density as
Lord's classically influenced keyboards assumed a much greater
focus. Soon after the album's release, their American label
Tetragrammaton folded, and with the dismissals of Evans and Simper
the band started fresh, recruiting singer Ian Gillan and bassist
Roger Glover from the ranks of the pop group Episode Six
