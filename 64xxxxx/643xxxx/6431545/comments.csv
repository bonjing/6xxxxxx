Thanks very much for all your hard work in bringing this to us. I really appreciate it. However, and I don't know how to put this more gently, this is the worst picture quality I have ever seen on a movie that is this size! 

A: 10
V: 5

Also, the subs for the Romanian (?) spoken bits at the beginning are not subtitled, and that's a BIG problem!

The 2.17GB version here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5822507/Bram_Stoker_s_Dracula_1992_BDRip_720p_x264_AAC_-_honchorella_(Ki

Looks much, much better AND has the Romanian properly subbed.

Unfortunately, I am not savvy enough to tell you exactly what needs to be changed. Once again, the work is appreciated, but I can not, in good faith, recommend this torrent to anyone.

Best,
