                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Gordon's Great Escape sees Gordon traveling to India to learn more about      
 Indian cuisine. The second series saw him travelling to South East Asia.      
                                                                               
 Gordon travels to Thailand where he finds out how to create some of the
 country's most delicious different dishes. He also meets up with the 
 country's version the WI as they compete for the acclaimed title of Best 
 Fish Paste. He then goes on a diving trip for giant oysters in Krabi and 
 at the end of his week long stay he appears on Thai national television 
 in a cook-off against Thailand's most popular celebrity chef.
