This is my first attempt at ripping ps2 games. I just got pcsx2 and decided to try it out with a game I have. Once it was confirmed to work I decided to be nice and share it with the world. It really is a great and classic DBZ game. It is an NTSC (North american) rip and it hasn't been modified in any way so I don't know if it will work in modded hardware or not. If you try burning it please post a comment as to whether or not it works on hardware! Thanks and enjoy! Don't forget to seed seed seed!
