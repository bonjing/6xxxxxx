                           DESCRiPTiON 

 O'Driscoll/Hardwick Dominic Littlewood explores how investigators are closing in 
 on a person who allegedly swindled the state out of more than 40,000 by forging 
 documents. He also explains how a 44-year-old man was diagnosed with kidney cancer 
 and had to give up work, but was able to get help to support his family
                         
                                 Enjoy!
