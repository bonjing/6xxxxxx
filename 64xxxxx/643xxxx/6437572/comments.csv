,PsychoLogic,2011-06-02T14:56Z,"Turns out the audio in this rip is fucked.  I'm going to re-rip the audio from a new source and upload an additional .ac3 format file, and a re-rip. Sorry to anyone this has affected."
,jaded3825,2011-06-03T05:21Z,"i burned it, watched it and was just about 2 comment on that issue. office space has a similar issue (dialogue comes out of all front channels). i will be waiting for the re-rip w/ gr8 anticipation. thank you for on top of things."
,jaded3825,2011-06-03T05:23Z,"oops, i meant thank you for being on top of things,lol."

Should I up a straight audio file as well? Will be a smaller download but will require muxing at your end.

Someone over at Demonoid pointed the audio issue out to me. Otherwise I never would have realized as I simply don't have enough time to watch all of them."
,jaded3825,2011-06-07T18:21Z,"@ psychologic: r u referring 2 ""office space""? if so, would u pls upload like u u usually do. i m not not sure what u mean by ""Should I up a straight audio file as well"". sorry i m a newb and not really proficient with all the technicalities. thanx again."
