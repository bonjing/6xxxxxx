The Real Heroes Of Telemark - Ray Mears


In 1943, four men parachuted onto a Norwegian glacier, equipped with only the most basic equipment. Their mission was to prevent the Nazi regime from building an atomic bomb. Wilderness expert Ray Mears describes this gruelling campaign, showing how these men's ability to survive in extreme conditions influenced the outcome of World War II. The Telemark campaign was an example of the bravery and skill of the Special Operations Executive. This is their true story.
