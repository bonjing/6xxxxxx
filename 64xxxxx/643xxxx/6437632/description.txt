Honesty is the key word of this documentary

All those who have seen Brazilian film "City of God" will feel illuminated to learn that this highly original documentary film was the inspiration for it.If a violent film like "City of God" was appreciated for being an outstanding fiction film,NotÃ­cias de uma Guerra Particular would also be regarded highly as an honest visual document about everyday violence which takes it toll on the residents of Favelas in Rio de Janeiro,Brazil.The film is multidimensional and we get to hear many views of people from all walks of life.We hear what police,drug dealers,drug addicts and Favela residents have to say. There is hardly any blame game which takes place in this film as Katia Lund and JoÃ£o Moreira Salles do not take sides.They show us images which are true to themselves.These are some of the images which might shock us but they were shot in order to reveal the hidden truth behind abominable drug trade in Rio.An excellent documentary film for those people who appreciate Brazilian cinema and are aware of serious films like "Pixote a lei do mas fraco","Ã”nibus 174" and "Tropa de Elite".

Seeder Review:
If you want to watch a bullshit fiction movie, watch "Tropa de Elite", that's not even close to Rio de Janeiro reality. This documentary is 'naked truth', even being some years old. The new Brazilian government is trying to fix brazilian society, but a cambial war is molding a brand new Weimar in Latin America. The US 'War on Drugs', to finance Dictatorial Governments in Condor Operation (60's), show's it's long term effects in this movie. You can clearly hear from the chief of police from Rio de Janeiro, that when they started to apply the law to everyone, including the land owners, they were no more invited to 'thursday's dinner' with the 'society representatives clubs'.
