2011 WRC Rally Argentina


Argentina, which first hosted a round of the World Rally Championship in 1980, is back on the WRC trail after a year 

away in 2010.

Based in Villa Carlos Paz north of the capital Buenos Aires, the town lies on the banks of the spectacular San Roque 

Lake in the south of the Punilla Valley close to the city of Cordoba.

The event is popularised by its jumps, water splashes and the lunar landscape of the high altitude El Condor stage, 

not to mention the tens of thousands of fans who line the route, and who are considered some of the most 

enthusiastic on the planet.

Although they are flowing in nature, the stages in Argentina are renowned for being slightly slower but more 

technically demanding than some of the other tests drivers experience in the WRC.

The surface is also quite sandy, which increases the risk of punctures because of a greater likelihood of rocks 

being pulled into the road by the competing cars. Because the road surface is softer, ruts can form following the 

first pass.

Argentinaâ€™s Southern Hemisphere location means the rally will take place just before the start of the countryâ€™s 

winter from June to September, which will increase the challenge facing the crews as they negotiate the testing 

terrain in colder and wetter conditions.
