Like My Favorite Highway and Friday Night Boys, the Downtown Fiction are a melodic emo-pop band hailing from the suburban outskirts of Washington, D.C. Formed during the summer of 2008 in Fairfax, Virginia, the band originally consisted of high-school students Cameron Leahy and Eric Jones. Classmate David Pavluk joined several months later, handling bass duties and singing backup for frontman Leahy. A healthy following on MySpace helped the boys land a contract with Photo Finish Records in 2009, and the band spent the latter half of that year working on new music. By early 2010, theyâ€™d made their iTunes debut with Best I Never Had, an introductory EP that helped them land several summer tours, including the Bamboozle Road Show and the Vans Warped Tour. A second release, The Double E.P., arrived later that year, followed in 2011 by the full-length Let's Be Animals.
