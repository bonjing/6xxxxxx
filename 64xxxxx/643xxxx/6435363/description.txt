From the Infowars web site ::

During this Memorial Day encore broadcast of the Alex Jones Show, Alex talks with constitutionalist Alfred Adask about a 60 Minutes hit piece demonizing patriots as domestic terrorists; the former governor of Minnesota, author, and television show host Jesse Ventura; former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives for Georgia Bob Barr; and former Congress woman Cynthia McKinney, who recently visited war-torn Libya.

Today's broadcast consists of all previously aired material.

    Alfred Adask -- Tue., May 17
    Jesse Ventura -- Tue., May 10
    Bob Barr -- Thr., May 26
    Cynthia McKinney -- Wed., May 25

The two most recent interviews I know are still well-seeded, etc., but I am not sure about the two earlier ones, so I will edit today's broadcast and upload it as a torrent and to a couple of file hosts. I will have one file per hour segment rather than dividing the show on half hour breaks as I normally do with a live week-day program.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
