,poon!!,2011-05-31T22:27Z,"You don't need any password. 
I just unpacked it, and I didn't have to type any password. 
The image was working right away after I opened it in VmWare. 
Thank you for this Image iMSDL"

,mrhozer,2011-06-07T10:50Z,"Thanks for the upload! but I have a problem that I don't know how to fix: 

I get the following error after I open the vmware lion image in the vmware workstation, ""The CPU has been disabled by the guest operating system. You will need to power off or reset the virtual machine at this point.""

I did the patch first, and got no errors. Do I have a setting off or something? I've gone through all the settings and can't find anything that would disable a CPU. 

I'm running AMD Phenom II 965 CPU, Win 7 64bit. Any help would be greatly appreciated, Thanks."

,BvvM,2011-06-07T22:31Z,"... for those who cannot wait for the official DL to arrive via 'SW Update' ... 

OS X Lion 10.7 Developer Preview 4.dmg (11A480b) 3.46GB

PS: Thanks to iMZDL, this image works perfectly (100% stable) on Win7x64 with VMWare 7.1.4 using the tools/method of Albert Nietsnie, as described here:

http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=220750"
,BvvM,2011-06-08T01:38Z,"Instructions to update this VM_OSX_Lion_DP3 > DP4

1. Download the DP4 torrent from link in above comment

2. free up 8GB diskspace on the HDD where the VM resides, as it may expand considerably if dynamic (which is the default)

3. shutdown VM_OSX_Lion_DP3 and in VMware settings, activate shared folders, so guest VM can find the downloaded DP4.dmg

4. also in VMware settings, ensure your VM_OSX_Lion_DP3 has at least 2GB of RAM allocated, or the update process will fail

5. now start the VM_OSX_Lion_DP3

6. In VM_OSX_Lion_DP3 Desktop, enter the host VM shared folders and mount the DP4.dmg (by double-clicking on it)

7. A window entitled 'Mac OS X Install ESD' appears ~ double-click on 'Mac OS X Lion DP4', then 'continue', 'agree' + 'install' on relevant HDD, with admin password, if any

8. the installer will initially estimate about x4 times longer than it actually needs (15min), then reboot the VM automatically

9. On reboot, a generic Mac OS X installer screen appears ~ let it churn away, estimated time = 0.5x(reality)

10. when finished, reboot is automatic 

11. Enjoy the illicit pleasures of VM_OSX_Lion_DP4

12. ehmm... never talk about Fight Club?

13. Profit!"
,appkking,2011-06-08T17:19Z,"I'm on a AMD Turion II Dual-Core Mobile M500 2.2 GHz 64-bit w/ 4gb and constantly see the vmware & Apple logo seemingly before Lion boots then I'm dropped back into windows/vmware player.

Any ideas why? tried the vmplayer unlocker but says cannot find files (as im on 64bit); vmware log is at http://pastebin.com/iYVA7nQJ"
,BvvM,2011-06-08T18:21Z,"@ appkking,

It is normal that VM boot fails on your machine, as I'm pretty sure Albert's Unlocker method (which this image uses) only works on Intel CPUs with the 'VT' hardware virtualization feature enabled in BIOS.

There are a couple of potential solutions however:

1. Cubez' further patch to the vmware.exe to eliminate the check for VT availability is worth a try, but make a backup copy of the target file first to restore it if the patch does not work. If it does, you can still use the OP's image - http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=256745

2. Donk's hacked Darwin.iso bootloader method will boot SL on AMD, but I suspect there is no support for Lion with that yet and there may not ever be - http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=172474

Good Luck!"

,1st_mate,2011-06-19T13:19Z,"Thanks iMZDL tested and working on Ubuntu 11.04.

A few steps to note though on linux host:

1. You must set the executable flag on the linux_32 or the linux_64 files before running them as root using SUDO to patch Vmware to allow OSX guests - Tested working with Vmware Workstation 7.1.4"
,1st_mate,2011-06-19T13:22Z,"2. You need to install the graphics driver inside OSX in order to use normal display resolutions.

,1st_mate,2011-06-19T13:39Z,"3. To enable 3D acceleration in linux you need to install ""driconf"" from Synaptic Package Manager. Once installed you will have a new menu item called 3D Acceleration, open it and then under the tab 

""Image Quality"" set

""Enable S3TC texture compression even if software support is not available"" to YES.

I hope this helps someone, I wasted hours figuring this shit out. peace."
