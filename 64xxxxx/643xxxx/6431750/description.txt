Gamera - The Giant Monster was an obvious attempt by Daiei, 
one of Japan's leading film companies, to cash in on the 
general popularity of giant monster movies in Japan 
(and their marketability abroad), a genre up to then 
completely dominated by rival Toho, purveyors of Godzilla,
Rodan, Mothra, et. al. Gamera - The Giant Monster is 
structured much like the first Godzilla. The Cold War heats 
up near the North Pole and when a Soviet MIG fighter is shot 
down, its nuclear payload spectacularly explodes, unleashing 
the frozen-in-time Gamera. As the monster makes the usual 
beeline to Tokyo, scientists and the military can find no way 
to stop the creature. A subplot introduces lonely, motherless 
Toshio (Yoshiro Uchida), whose torturous conflicts at home over 
a pet turtle lead to the boy's complete and dangerous obsession 
with the destructive monster.

The first Gamera movie isn't as enjoyable as those that followed, 
partly because it's less original, following Godzilla's 
well-trodden path of destruction so closely, and because the 
subplot with Toshio is more irritating than affective. In its 
original Japanese version, it's clear the boy is basically 
pathetic and delusional, and the approach is uniquely Japanese 
in a manner that doesn't play well at all to American viewers.

But it did lay the foundation for the series' lasting impact. By 
1965 Toho's monster movies were already in decline, shifting away 
from the mainstream appeal they once enjoyed toward an audience of 
primarily teenagers and, later still, children. Gamera director 
Noriaki Yuasa and screenwriter Niisan Takahashi wholeheartedly 
embraced this trend rather than fight it. By the third entry, 
children became the central characters and the movies were told 
from their innocent perspectives rather than neutral adult ones. 
Rarely do movies do this, even children's films about children - a 
few exceptions to this rule are The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, Invaders 
from Mars (both 1953) and The Railway Children (1971). Takahashi and 
Yuasa clearly empathized with these characters and, certainly in Mr. 
Yuasa's case, retained a childlike sense of wonder apparent in their 
work.

Instead, the first Gamera movie is interesting in other ways. It was 
the only series entry in black and white, giving it a unique look that 
also helps hide some of its deficiencies in terms of the visual effects. 
But even these are often good and always inventive. Where Toho was by 
the mid-'60s scaling back on its effects, and where rivals like Toei, 
Nikkatsu, and Shochiku would cut corners and/or show limited imagination 
on its eventual kaiju eiga, Daiei's early Gamera films had an original 
look and the obvious effort is there onscreen.
