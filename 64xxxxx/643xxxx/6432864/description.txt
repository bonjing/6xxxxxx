Review
"Intended for commercial growers, the guide is a rich source of information for anyone who aims to harness the power of photosynthesis, perhaps especially serious gardeners. Metric conversion tables, fertilizer application methods, and tips for shipping and packaging round out a volume that strikes a perfect balance between robust content and lucid presentation." (American Reference Books Annual, 2008)

"It certainly provides the user with a wealth of current information on vegetable crop production and marketing in a well-organized and clearly presented manner." (HorTechnology, July-Sept 2007) --This text refers to the Plastic Comb edition.
