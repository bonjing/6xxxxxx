Astronomy Cast, as you'll hear many times from now on, is 'a fact based journey through the cosmos'!

It is a fascinating weekly show that covers almost comprehensively, yet simple to understand various aspects of cosmology  from stellar objects like massive black holes, to tiny objects like strings in string theory. 

Some mp3 filenames and tags are added (or corrected) to keep consistency of all shows. These files are marked with asterisks * in titles.
