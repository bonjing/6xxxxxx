  Game information :
  ==================
   For the first time, the research ship RSS SOLARIUS has successfully
   travelled through the Great Nebula of a distant galaxy on its way to
   the OUTER RIM. The humanoid REYS - designers and builders of the vast
   SOLARIUS carrier ship - thus tackled their first major project since
   the Galactic War. The SOLARIUS is approaching the first unknown
   worlds of the OUTER RIM with its scientific instruments, research
   units, eagerly inquisitive officers and highly motivated team. The
   reason for the War, its end, and the mission of the carrier ship can
   be described in a single word - Might! Might based on a technology
   that has endured since the depths of prehistory. Wars had been fought
   over the coveted technology and unparalleled knowledge left behind
   by the Ancient People. They also left a trail behind - a trail leading
   to the OUTER RIM, which Crimson, an agent of the REYs ILB secret
   service, suspects is the source of the technology.
   
   You will experience the mission of the RSS SOLARIUS from the viewpoint
   of Max Adamski, officer of the ALPHA landing troop. Adamski is a
   veteran of the war against the antlike, bionic SLAKZ, and is on board
   because of an regrettable error. As Adamski, you will take control and
   assume the responsibility for the units, equipment and personnel of
   the landing troops. Your actions will be decisive for the success or
   failure of the mission. Adamski is thinking back - the difficulties
   began as the planet \"Paradise\" came within range of the scanners...
