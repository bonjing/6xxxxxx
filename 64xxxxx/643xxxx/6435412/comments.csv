,paragon9,2011-05-31T21:16Z,"went to see paul kossoff on the liverpool empire when he was playing for 'back street crawler'.........during the concert he collapsed and fell forward flat on his face and guitar, a terrible sight and one which i will never forget.........needless to say the concert ended abruptly as paul was carried off the stage. it wasn't long after that he died................a sad loss."
