Terry Gilliam - Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas [+Extras] (1998)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669

â€œWe were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold.â€ It is 1971, and journalist Raoul Duke barrels towards Las Vegas to cover a motorcycle race, accompanied by a trunkful of contraband and his slightly unhinged Samoan attorney, Dr. Gonzo. But what is ostensibly a cut-and-dried journalistic endeavor quickly descends into a feverish psychedelic odyssey and an excoriating dissection of the American way of life. Director Terry Gilliam and an all-star cast (headlined by Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro) show no mercy in bringing Dr. Hunter S, Thompsonâ€™s legendary Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas to the screen, creating a film both hilarious and savage.
