Sorry I remuxed the file ....you will be able to play the movie"

decent Bluray rip & filesize
(1216x704 is an odd resolution though)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T07:22Z,"Nope. Explained thousand times:

 "" 720p = for 16:9 aspect ratio (TV and movies) frame-size is 640p or 1120x640
 (because of my own limit of 1400 MB per encode) 
 or 1216x528-544 pixels for 2.35:1 (movies/theatrical AR),
 hardware intensive
 NOT Handhelds/iPod/QuickTime/PSP/Zune/clones compatible file.
 Official 1280x720 frame-size is - simple - and - plain - WRONG.
 90% of encodes follow that wrong ""standard"" for years,
 what leads to unimaginable volume of ""squashed"" objects and people.
 Look any circular, well known object, not people, because human eyes
 can easily be tricked.
 Look at examples
 1280x720
http://bayimg.com/PaEOfaADH
 and my 1216x720 (I go even as ""low"" as 704 pixels, if needed.

 Use own eyes, please. ""
