,OpiumStoned,2011-06-18T00:41Z,"Your torrent gave me a bad file i think.. Each  time I try to open my ""Downloads"" folder it give me a message saying ""Windows explorer encountered an error"" I had to download another file because your's is impossible to delete...."
,iamchipdouglas,2012-02-15T05:37Z,"

FYI I use PeerBlock (I know it's not perfect) and, after having downloaded probably 1000+ torrents, this is the first one that got Comcast to send me a copyright infringement letter. And no, it's not random: they specified Happy Gilmore. DL away but fair warning on this one--it's being watched."
