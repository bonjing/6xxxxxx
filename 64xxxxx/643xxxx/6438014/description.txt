 Vampires, John Croix is left to die in a forgotten region of the desert. It is here where
 an unspeakable evil exists. Now, by no choice of his own, Croix will come face-to-face
 with the most terrifying creatures of the night. Still a man, but possessing all the
 strength and power of a werewolf when the moon is out, Croix becomes a reluctant hero for
 mankind when he learns that his wife may still be alive. Croix sets out on a mission to
 rescue his wife - venturing deeper and deeper into the Vampire's lair- in his quest to
 save her before she is lost to the world of the undead forever.
