,ilovemedia,2011-06-20T17:13Z,"djluv, you are the best. just a request to you to try CBR instead of VBR; and use ""Stereo"" instead of ""Joint stereo"".

Yes it will increase the size of the rip, but it gives exceptional quality when played in anything but computer. It has been a while that I'm recoding your rips (the best ones here) into CBR and stereo.

Those extra MB arn't going to kill ya. What say :)"
,mohin_md,2011-08-17T12:41Z,yeah.. agree with ilovemedia...try CBR instead of VBR
