,Cichy1993,2011-05-30T16:41Z,I resolved problem with autosave. You must create another Administrator account in your windows. I new account run dirt. DONT MAKE OFFLINE PROFILE IN WINDOWSLIVE. It should work without it. If not Try with OFFLINE PROFILE. Good Luck Have Save :)

,GaMeRSKiLLZ,2011-05-31T19:02Z,"Hi there. First things first this crack its working but u must do some things before make it working in save progress of Dirt 3. U must download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6419471/Dirt_3_SKIDROW_-_Crack_Only and after downloading stop ur antiviruses for a moment untill u copy all files from SKIDROW crack into ur game location, then start ur game as usual make an offline account of Game for Windows Live. The will save ur game progress (Play one game in campaign) . After saving ur game progress ... exit the game and Run ur antiviruses will detect ur viruses from SKIDROW files. The Re-Install the game and copy the files from this Dirt 3 crack from this page and it works saving the progress of ur Dirt 3 game. PS: it worked for me ... seriously. Hope its working for u also. -->EnJoY"
,wcedric,2011-06-02T20:41Z,if you want to save the game you need to make an offline account. You need to click it somewhere in the text. Then it works
,ZeroCast,2011-06-04T01:25Z,Will this crack work if I apply the new update or are we going to need a new one like usual?

,mccoy77,2011-08-02T11:42Z,Use this crack if you get steam error application load error 5:0000065434 when you try loading dirt 3. It is important to use play.exe when loading Dirt 3 for this to work.

,KnuxTheFox,2011-11-02T00:21Z,"I actually bought DiRT3, but don't have a dvd drive IN my computer, however the game will not run without the disc.  I'm here because I want to have a way around that, since I don't want to have my external dvd drive hooked up to my computer every single time I want to play DiRT3.  Will this work for a legit copy?  I'm already registered and have a save file on LIVE."
,imgandhi,2011-11-13T05:20Z,"@knu

Yes, as long as your CD key is valid, the crack is unnecessary.

1) Download the actual game file, search Dirt 3 and it will be the first file with the most seeders (about 700). 
2) Install Power Iso , again search,download and install
3) Use Power Iso to ""mount"" the image of the file, this will allow you to run the setup without the physical DVD.
4) Install the Game as you did and enter your serial.

Enjoy = )"

,Kissen11,2012-01-06T14:35Z,"I hope anyone could help me with an issue.
I've downloaded and tried a lot of different Dirt 3 uploads and there's no problem installing it and it to work.
The problem is that it freezes every 4-5 seconds. So I can't play.
I've tried all sorts of cracks and patches and it still don't work. Lower grafics and so on like someone mentioned. It can't be the computer cos I have an i7 2600K, GTX 580 and 8gb ram.
Any suggestions?
Thank's for the upload! "
