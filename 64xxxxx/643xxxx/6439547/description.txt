It's June already? The year is going by too fast.

Well, there are over 69 tracks here again. I know originally that was intended to be the limit. But with so many tracks to choose from and coming in every month now (over 400 this time) I find it very hard to narrow it down to such a small number. So I'm not going to worry about the 69 thing anymore (TWSS) AND I'm doing a second playlist for the leftover tracks (not rejects, those go in the recycler) called "Tasty Leftovers", so watch for that. It'll be called:

Indie 69 Tasty Leftovers June, 2011 (various artists)

So watch for that if you want more. Could be a few days. But let me know if you want it in the middle of the month. Someone suggested that, but I want some feeback about it.

If the whole point of this is to help new music get heard, it seemed stupid to toss so much good music every month or leave it in a folder, un-shared.

So I hope you enjoy this month's selection and what's to come.

I'll see you in July.
