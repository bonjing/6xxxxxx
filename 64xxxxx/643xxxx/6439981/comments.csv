""Our reaction has been to encourage the file sharing. The ethical argument for and against file sharing is very complicated, however, if the file sharers have the filmmakerâ€™s blessing to pass it around, there is unquestionably no injustice done. The fact is we own all the rights to Ink and the file sharers absolutely have our blessing. It would be a lie and naive to say that itâ€™s not benefitting our film exponentially. Weâ€™ve made a link available for those fans that want to support us in our battle by making a donation and we have Blu-Rays, DVDs, and other merchandise available for the most serious fans. This is a 100% independent film with no studio, no distributor, and no big money so trust me when I say we need all the help we can get."""
