                Take Two.
                Series going behind the scenes of Doctor Who hangs
                out with the stars in the 'Tent of Fun' and takes a
                look at how filming with doppelgangers can mean
                double the trouble. We discover whether playing The
                Doctor has given Matt Smith an insight into another
                world, while writer Matthew Graham takes a journey of
                discovery and sees one of his most powerful new
                characters coming to life. Featuring interviews with
                Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill and Sarah
                Smart.
