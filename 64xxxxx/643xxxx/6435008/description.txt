The 2000 solo album from James Michael, at the time a record producer and he that would eventually be the vocalist for the amazing band Sixx: A.M.. It's a light-sounding pop-rock album, but lyrically darker than a lot the stuff with a similar style. That was a helluvan alliteration. Anyway, I don't recall ever seeing a torrent of this one on TPB, so here ya go.

If you like it, buy the album!
