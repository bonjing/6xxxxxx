The Malay Chronicles: Bloodlines (2011) 
I enjoyed watching it even if I did not known the actors"
,sonofdog,2011-06-01T22:50Z,"V/a good. But it is clear that this is a foreign investment intended to titilate us westerners. It turns out to be Malasia.

Who knows whether it is Pirates of the Carribean, Harry Potter, Sinbad, Apocalypse Now or Enter the Dragon? I began to get pissed off about its plagiarisms. 

Respect! They clearly worked hard and possibly spent too much money.

I can always forgive if I see quality......not here!

It tries to be all these things and more but only disappoints."

,Frice,2011-06-03T20:49Z,"lotsa mean comments but let me be a devils advocate here and say this:

remember the ambiguously gay volleyball scene from topgun? the one with the song ""play'n with the boys"".

Well if you thought that was halarious then this movie is that all the way through. I just had to post this after a japanese guy, a indian guy and a roman guy all were hugging and smiling on the beach and looking at one another up and down. one peg away from gay porn and it made me down-right rofl frequently.

so if you take movies way to serious and probably yourself, then this movie isn't for you.

otherwise its a b-movie classic as the high production values lure in mainstream audiences to the bad acting and terrible plot holes, oh and theres alot of random battles."
