Lego Racers is a racing video game developed by High Voltage Software and published by Lego Media, released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Color, and PlayStation on July 31, 1999. The player races various characters made of Lego in custom-built go-karts based on the Lego Racers product line in an attempt to become "the greatest Lego racing champion of all-time"

In Lego Racers, the player assumes the role of either one of several pre-built Lego characters or a custom-built driver. The player can use virtual Lego, including pieces of Lego headwear, heads, bodies and legs, to construct characters, and can then build a custom car, using Lego bricks to build upon one of several designs of chassis.
