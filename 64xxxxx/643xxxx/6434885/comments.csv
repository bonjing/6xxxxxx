No it doesn't. Since they use Fairlight No-CD and Fairlight haven't made a no-cd for the new patch. Just download the ali patch and use on top of this :)"

,Sivos,2011-09-29T05:22Z,"Whoever complains about this taking forever to unpack, then just go buy the game.  It's really annoying when people want to complain about something they get for free because of how long it takes them to get it.  Do you really have nothing better to do than to play video games all day?  I really don't care if you're from Aus paying $200 per game or from the states paying $60, stop complaining about stuff you get for free!  Go buy the game and support the companies if you want to complain so much.  Keep them in business and just whine to them."
