To go along with the \"Awake & Aware\" series, this is the first volume of \"Home Schooling\" DVD\'s i\'ve put together from educational videos gathered from around the internet...note this version is meant for children between 3-8 (though never too late to start, and it\'s fun for \"adults\" too;) ...please enjoy and spread around to your friends and family...peace :)
