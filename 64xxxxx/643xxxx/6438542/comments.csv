,topk,2011-05-31T23:04Z,I don't understand a certain moment... Cracked games almost never allow to play co-op or multi-player - this game is intended for co-op. So what's the deal?... Is it actually cracked so that we can play co-op?
,Indigozy,2011-05-31T23:09Z,Can you pleas upload the crack separately  ? I downloaded the full game already >.
,kaz050,2011-05-31T23:14Z,if im right Co-op is for 2 people on 1 pc like gamepad/kb n m
