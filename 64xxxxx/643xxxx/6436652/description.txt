More is probably the least-noted studio album in Pink Floyd's history. This is not very surprising: these thirteen tracks were written and recorded for Barbet Schroeder's 1969 hippie-film of the same name. Pink Floyd was still very much a band in search of its sound, so More is extremely experimental; also this was the band's first effort at composing a full film score, and the Floyd were composing directly to scenes in the movie. The result is that there are as many bizarre fragmented moments as there are actual songs. 
However, despite all the failings of this record, the band managed to capture several moments of kaleidoscopic beauty (above all the two cult classics Cymbaline and Green is the Color), and Roger Waters reveals here his blossoming songwriting talent with remarkability.
