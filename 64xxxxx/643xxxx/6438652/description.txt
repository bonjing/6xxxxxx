The veteran composer Robbie Robertson, lead guitarist with The Band during its "classic" era, teams up with longtime friend Eric Clapton to compose a batch of highly personal new songs. Robertson sounds fantastic backed by the rhythm section of bassist Pino Palladino and drummer Ian Thomas (except on track 8 where drumming ace Jim Keltner steps in). Guest musicians include Steve Winwood, Tom Morello, Robert Randolph, and Trent Reznor.
