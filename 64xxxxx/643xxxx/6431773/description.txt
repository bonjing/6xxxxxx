United here for the first time are the rare fragments of music which have come
down to us from Ancient Greece. We have added the only surviving musical fragment of Imperial Rome: four mutilated measures from a work by Terence. It is as if nothing were left of the Acropolis but a few scattered bits of columns and a pair of ruined capitals.In effect, though admirable testimonies to Hellenic culture survive in the architecture and literature, nothing remains of its music, the performance of which was a veritable institution in Greece, but these sparse fragments miraculously preserved in a few papyrii and marbles and in other documents copied in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Baroque era. These have been included in the recording in order to render them the importance they deserve, despite the fact that certain musicologists discredit them asapocryphal. This then is the panorama of the music which was practiced on every occasion, and which formed an integral part of daily life in Ancient Greece.
