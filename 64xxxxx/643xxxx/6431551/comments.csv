Don't know, it might just be my computer that couldn't handle the encoding, or else theres bad frames thoughout the movie."

,kris12486,2011-06-20T06:51Z,"Hey pluto, you are the best. I just now reconized your tallent. I have one question for you or anyone out there. Everybody talks about seeding, well I have alot of things downloaded, so how do I seed. "
,scottsasse,2011-06-27T01:29Z,"@ kris12486, Whenever u download a torrent you are seeding! Unless you remove, delete, stop or pause the torrent. When you look at your u-torrent or bit torrent page while downloading take notice of both the up and down speed. The up speed is what you're seeding to others at the time. But the most important part is your ratio which lets you know what % you have seeded. For example if your ratio is 1.00 then you have seeded the same amount as you downloaded. Any good person will seed until at least a 1.10 ratio. However a true pirate will shoot for 2.20 or more!! Hell, I have torrents right now that I've seeded to 52.63!! Also after your download completes torrents should automatically continue seeding. Any questions you can e-mail me at DrWynnScott@gmail.com or click on my user-name and leave it as a comment on one of my torrents. Love and Respect, DrScott"
