So well made.
It would be cool if you add info for modifying boot cd to add/remove stuff.
Yeah I could hack it, but would be nice to just have a simple explanation of how all the parts link together.
Only one problem. You should keep all the old backup utilities. For example Acronis makes great partition imaging software, but their file formats are not compatible between versions. Also it seems you've excluded Norton Ghost from the new version.
So instead of having to keep the old Hiren boot CDs, it would be cool if all the old Acronis versions were included, as well as a ghost version that can read old ghost files."
