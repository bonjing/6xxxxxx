Notes:

 - The video is a little more grainy than I would have liked because the DVD could have been done much better: originally filmed in Cinemascope 55 (2.55:1), rather than pan-and-scanning or making the DVD 16:9 to preserve the vertical resolution, instead the entire frame was stuffed into a 4:3 window (the black bars on the top and bottom were over half the size of the frame.) I cropped this away as best I could and restored the 2.55:1 aspect ratio.
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for up to several days until there are enough other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
