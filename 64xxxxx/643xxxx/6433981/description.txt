This is a superb novel with a genuinely compulsive plot. The story of Vera Hillyard and her sister Eden is brilliantly unfolded through the reminiscing of their neice Faith, remembering the twists and turns that lead up to a shocking murder. The identity of the murderer and the victim is revealed in the first chapter, yet I was left shocked and stunned by the final pages. The author completely recreates the fine line between love and hate and the dangers and compulsions of obsessive love. England during World War II is the nostalgic yet oppressive setting with stifling middle class family life providing the key atmosphere of the novel. By the end of the story I found myself truly believing in Vera, Eden and Faith as real characters with feelings, motives and the desparate tie of family relationships. Nothing is ever clear cut and simple and the terrible price of love is paid at the end of the story.(K.Smith)

I have read several Rendell/Vine books, and this is one of the best if not the best. Not only is the mystery at the centre of the novel totally baffling, but the style of writing is original and highly effective. Just when you think you know what'll happen, there is a shift or a surprise and the tension increases even more. The final pages are almost unbearably uneasy. All the characters are memorable yet realistic. I'll never forget what an impact this book made, and I'd advise everyone to read it. (AC)
