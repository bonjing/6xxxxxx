,DMWill,2011-06-01T08:33Z,"very cool, thanks a ton man.  from the looks of it the Preview and Power Stage are not included.  however the file sizes are larger; is this because of the source or is the coverage longer for each day?"
,rethawro,2011-06-01T12:14Z,"@DMWill it's HD version. btw channel onehd cut away 10 min from day 1 report. My usual rip source failed this time, so i have to upload hd version, maybe later this week i upload preview and power stage if it'll be possible."

,skbd,2011-06-03T15:03Z,The quality of the video is really bad considering the size of the files.
,TVpainter,2011-06-05T20:18Z,"Crap .... thanks for the effort but ..... Day 1 video sucked! Outa sinc, jumpy slow motion, grainy.
I'm trashing these and getting the AVI's.
Again, thanks anyway."
,rethawro,2011-06-05T20:53Z,@TVpainter video actually is really fine. there's problem with playback HD video on your computer according symptoms. Try to unload your processor.
