,slicknick610,2011-06-02T00:33Z,Thanks for posting the first motos. I am surprised more people arent downloading them. They were all begging me for them.

Thanks for your work too, it's the only way for me to watch the amazing us riders."

,mxfanboy,2011-06-08T22:38Z,"I've made another version through Safari, and freezes disappear. I post this version soon."
