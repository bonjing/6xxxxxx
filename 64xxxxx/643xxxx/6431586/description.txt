Kara Gunes was formed in 1997 in Ankara (Turkey). They were early on seem to be a rock band within the influence of Anatolian pieces, who were depicting self journey of the human being in their early pieces and criticising the system and daily life routine. After a few years later they have left Ankara and traveled around Izmir, Istanbul, Antalya and many other cities, performing with various musicians. Scene of the group was varying with the attendance of local musicians and influence of local culture.
With settling down in Istanbul in 2004, a new musical journey has started for the group members with also the participation of traditional instruments such as santur, ney, kemenÃ§e. Since then, during these four years, they became one of the leading musicians performing around Istanbul, representing street culture. They have also took part with the video collectives such as "Baris iÃ§in 100 Kisa Film, Red 1111 Vicdani Red Belgeseli, 25+ , Videa" Kara GÃ¼nes keep on their journey at two different platforms as street and scene.

On the streets, they are performing Anatolian folk poems, traditional sounds, own compositions and improvisations with various acoustic instruments that they have gathered around a wide region; such as santur, kemenÃ§e, ney, twelve-string guitar and percussions (tef, bendir, darbuka, cajon); while on the scene they show up with a different formation including electric instruments.

As apart from their street performance, besides the traditional poems and improvisations, scene performance also includes rock, reggae, dub compositions of Ã–zgÃ¼r YalÃ§in, who is one of the founders of Kara GÃ¼nes. Kara GÃ¼nes don't have any published recordings while they have 5 demo recordings which they have been distributing around the audience during their street performances.
