The subtitles aren't showing up, in fact it won't play in Divx Player(just my player of choice), it plays in WMP but while the ffdshow launches, neither Halli or Vobsub pops up to take care of the subtitles.  In fact, I didn't see any actual files for the sub in this release, just the index files for the subs(.IDX) and I don't know whether I'm just missing something or if someone forgot to include the .ass(or other associated subtitle file) in the folder."
