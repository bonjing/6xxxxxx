Seeaann,
You will need WinRar to complete the extraction. After installing it, select the ten zip files (so they are all highlighted. Make sure the .nfo and the .diz files are NOT selected) then right click on one of the zip files and select 'extract here'. When WinRar asks if you want to overwrite a file just click 'yes to all'. You will then end up with 10 rar files, and you can delete the original 10 zip files. Right click on one of the rar files and select 'extract here'. You will then get a 'setup.exe' file and a 'crack.zip' file. You can now delete the rar files."
