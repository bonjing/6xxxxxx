###  [color=green]Storyline[/color]  ### 
    
Valerie (Seyfried) is a beautiful young woman torn between two men. She is in love with a brooding outsider, Peter 
(Fernandez), but her parents have arranged for her to marry the wealthy Henry (Irons). Unwilling to lose each other, 
Valerie and Peter are planning to run away together when they learn that Valerie's older sister has been killed by 
the werewolf that prowls the dark forest surrounding their village. For years, the people have maintained an uneasy 
truce with the beast, offering the creature a monthly animal sacrifice. But under a blood red moon, the wolf has 
upped the stakes by taking a human life. Hungry for revenge, the people call on famed werewolf hunter, Father 
Solomon (Oldman), to help them kill the wolf. But Solomon's arrival brings unintended consequences as he warns that 
the wolf, who takes human form by day, could be any one of them. As the death toll rises with each moon...
