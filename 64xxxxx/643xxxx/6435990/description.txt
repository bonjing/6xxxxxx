The Ting Tings â€“ Weâ€™re Not The Same

The way that we are
The way that we are

Were never the same
Were never the same

Were ready to go
Ready to go

Its always the spark
And were running wild

This is not the same old song
Itâ€™s not the same old life
And we are not the first but we were making its out

Yeah were not the same, Oh
Were not the same

Its always the spark
And were running wild

Oh were not the same

Boom

The way that we are
The way that we are

We maybe
We conditioned

We are never the same
Never the same

But itâ€™s not just a time diference

We are ready to go and
Ready to go

And I just need to set the tone

Yeah, were not the same
Oh, were not the same No

Its always the spark
And were running wild

Oh, were not the same
Weâ€™re not the same Oh
Weâ€™re not the same Oh
Weâ€™re not the same Oh
Weâ€™re not the same
