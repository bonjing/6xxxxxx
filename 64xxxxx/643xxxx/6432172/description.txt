The Space Giants aka Ambassador Magma - Live Action DVD Video 1 of 3 (1966-67)
Episodes 37-52 of 52

A little boy blows a whistle three times to call a 50-foot gold robot to fight monsters, two times to call his silver robot wife, or one time to call their rocket boy son.

Probably ripped from Japanese Laserdisc with English broadcast audio dubbed over.  Almost entirely in English, with some Japanese and silence.  Excellent video quality.  Compete with episode menu.
