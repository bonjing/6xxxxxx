
MC Lars' 2000 album Insectivorous, from when he was still known as Lars Horris.

The 'Remedial Electronic Subversion' track (#15) was originally that song, about 7min30sec of silence, and then a live performance of the Insectivorous title track. I removed the silent section and split the two songs into separate tracks, otherwise leaving the files unchanged.

MC Lars' early album Insectivorous had been floating around the Internet in MP3 (see http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5482796 for the MP3 version). It was recently rereleased by Lars, with a FLAC option available, to celebrate the success of the Kickstarter campaign used to fund the upcoming Lars Attacks album.

The Insectivorous FLACs are what you shall find here. Enjoy that, and my other Lars torrents.
