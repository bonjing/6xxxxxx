A show which I would love to see added is:
""Damage Done: The Drug War Odyssey""

""After 30 years of the War on Drugs, illegal narcotics have gone down in price, up in purity and availability, and way way up in demand. The heroes of this film are veterans of the Drug War, and they urge us to consider ending drug prohibition both at home and around the world. They have had a complete revolution in their thinking: now they are working to end the War on Drugs. Find out what happened to change their minds and how they became truly radical cops.""

I've searched everywhere but can't find it

If you see some professionally made video, specially with plenty of special effects, obviously requiring quite some budget to produce, beware. There is pretty good chance it is disinformation, specifically created to keep you in a state of delusion, thinking ""oh, something is done about all this evil stuff, great!"".

Not so.

Here is how it works, which is PRECISELY described in the Protocols of Learned Elders of Zion:

These evil ZioNazis controlling the media in any conceivable ways has three levels of information outlets. One of them, official is what you see on major media outlets. They are also puppets and they also feed you the ""carefully selected chicken feed"", but it looks as something real.

Then, they have puppets posing as some kind of opposition, and that is what you see in most of so called alternative media production, some kind of dissidents or ""antis"".

Those ""antis"" are also puppets and they only tell you those things they were told to tell you, in order to create an illusioin, things that are already known even to a five year old. But it looks like the ""opposition"" opinion, and many of you will be caught in it thinking it is something real.

Look carefully and use your mind and ask: what do these things really tell me and what do they really change as far as what I know or see?

So, the bottom line is: unless you STUDY the ""Protocols"" or ""100 main laws of Shulchan Aruch"", you are likely to be a victim of a scam to zombify you all and create illusions in your mind, or rather delusions, as you will pretty much inevitably be deluded into believing something that is just a bate, a trap, thinking it is reality, ""democracy at work"" and you name it.

Otherwise, plenty of you, if not most, will be feeding on this lowest grade crap called ""chicken feed"" without realizing that its end goal is to lead you to slaughter either way you cut it.

And that is precisely how they keep you enslaved, wasting your life feeding on utterly meaningless chicken feed that in reality changes nothing.

Unless you study the very foundation of it all, the very roots of it, the mechanisms, the organizations, tools and methods of zombification and global domination, the banking system, the Federal Reserve scam, you are doomed to oblivion."

1) Remember: the span of attention nowadays is between 1 and 3 seconds. If someone can not see something of his interest, chances are he is going to push the ""Next"" button, and so your information never reaches its target.

Create DETAILED Table of Contents

2) If you write something, or publish some existing work, make sure to add a DETAILED table of contents outlining every single issue of significance in it.

3) Make paragraphs short (span of attention issue). Long paragraphs take long time to read and understand. Who has it nowadays?

4) There is no need to worry about the ""fancy looks"" and ""killer pages"". It is all just a fasion trap, or, rather, crap, meant to keep you busy with special effects while there is no content of any value to even mention. So, make your pages clean, simple and easy to read.

5) Avoid dark backgrounds and ""kinky looking pages. That simply makes your stuff hard to read.

6) Do not crowd pages with all sorts of irrelevant stuff, unless the only reason you are doing all this is to get some ""rating"" from Google, poor you.

7) If you do not see some book that is significant and revealing some important things and you happen to have it in a paper edition, scan it and use the OCR software to convert it to HTML format with detailed TOC.

8) If you happen to have some book in .RTF format, take your time to convert it to HTML format. It significantly helps in all sorts of ways.

9) On your site, make navigation simple and provide a short summary for each title of a book or article it contains. Again, nowadays no one is going to spend minutes digging up some stuff they are interested in, especially if you make it hard for them to read thing and obscure the information with special effects, textual, visual or otherwise.

10) Create torrents instead of merely posting things on your site. Your site may go out for a number of reasons, but torrents, if your information is valuable and of interest to others, will survive.

11) Try to cross-link or cross-index your information as much as possible, so when you refer to something outsite the page, all the readers have to do is to click on a link and they are there. Again, there is no much time to waste nowadays.

And beware of the ""crap"" principle. Do not publish some crappy information just because..."

,sparx101,2011-07-09T22:10Z,"Here is a couple of torrents with REAL information, written by the world's best researchers and REAL alternative authors, most of whom spent their entire lives studying it down to the last dot and comma.

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6463014/
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6368388/

Study, and not just skim over it, every single word of it if you can.

Again, do not waste your time on ""oh, look at what bad guys are doing, how horrible!"" type of things.
Instead, try to understand the FUNDAMENTALS of NWO, and ZioNazism and not just its manifestations in all the hyped up productions of ""WOW"" type.

Once you study the fundamentals, ideology, principles, power of money and gold, you can predict everything that you will be chasing forever in all these ""WOW!!!"" torrens feeding you crap that changes nothing in reality and informs you of nothing of REAL significance, leading you into the nowhere lands of zombies and biorobots.

There is no time for that now. Every minute counts...

Genuinely important and valuable information needs to be spread and distributed like a wildfire, because what is left on the clock to ""the end of times"", if you know of it, is big funken ZERO.

Your chances are the slimest they have ever been in the entire history of the mankind. Because the evil the likes of which you could have never imagined, and even in your wildest dreams, can be triggered any moment now. Just about all it takes is for the president to hop up the stage and announce...

Tadam!

The Martial Law is in effect. The constitution is suspended and FEMA has all the extra-legal authoritis, overriding even the government power, and ANYTONE labled as a ""terrorist suspect"" or ""the enemy of the people"", just like in Russia during the communist rule, is to be shot upon site, in broad day light, without any court proceeding, or to be imprisoned and gassed and burned in the ovens in the FEMA concentratioin/death camps, just like in Germany during the WWII, that have already been built, and their bodies are to be buried in the mass graves in specially built caskets that can hold at least 3 bodies each.

Comprehende?"
