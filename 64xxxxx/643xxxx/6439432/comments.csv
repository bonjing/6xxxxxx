,Masonchan,2011-07-15T15:16Z,"Im downloading this torrent and i finished downloading episode 1 and the other 2 files that say season 6 episode 1 and there is no audio 
What do i do???"

,instantzeug,2011-08-21T20:10Z,"Some sentences seem to be missing in the audio track and only appear in the subtitles.

For instance:
Episode 5 at 23:24
Dean says ""I can get it"" - you can even see his lips saying that, but I cannot hear it.

Episode 6 at 0:43:
""Nobody's tried it since God knows"" (several sentences missing)

Has anyone else noticed this? Maybe the files contain only some of the channels which were intended for surround sound?"
,ccrucio,2012-03-02T21:35Z,"could you upload season 4, 3, 2 and 1 in 720p?"
