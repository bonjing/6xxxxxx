[V],C3NTURiO,2011-05-30T11:21Z,"@kelzoo see tino64's comment above. 

Also (if you mean this) sometimes there is no DLC folder under XLIVE folder. just copy it from the rar archive.

@lamja25, nothing more. just copy the folders to proper locations. cars will be available instantly."
,martiniboss,2011-05-30T23:40Z,THX MAN! hey what about vip cars is there a way to download them?
,Dhatz,2011-05-31T11:46Z,"vip have some code, i believe it can be cracked, but after the failure that ME2 DLCs can fail authorising and crack didnt get rid of the authorisation, its at least unsure."

,Int_Auto,2011-06-05T13:40Z,"This appears to unlock the ""VIP"" cars, in fact the ""VIP"" label was removed in the 1.1 patch. They are now simply referred to as cars unlocked with ~""The 'G4WL' Free Car Pack..."" Imagine that ;)"

,psmuller,2011-07-24T04:57Z,"It really works, you need to search for some folds becaus windows folders are different in each version, but its not impossible. It unlocks the vip cars, dont add any new one, as ive seen. No viruses."
