This book is 166 Pages long including the small English-Swedish, and Swedish-English dictionaries at the end of the book. I hope you enjoy it, because it took me about 1Â½ hours to scan it all. But I figured it was worth it, because someone can always use it :)

If there is a problem with it in any way, let me know in a comment, I check the comments often. If you want to see a picture of the cover before you download it, I have the pic of the cover on my website here:

I do have one other book that helped me learn Swedish too, entitled: "Collins Phrase Books: Scandinavian- Norwegian, Danish & Swedish"

If you want me to scan that too, then let me know, and I will :)
