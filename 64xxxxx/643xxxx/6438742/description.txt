├óΓé¼╦£Born Again├óΓé¼Γäó is Black Sabbath├óΓé¼Γäós eleventh studio album, released in 1983. The album was recorded during the summer of 1983 at The Manor Studio in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, England. A major criticism of the album is its production, which Iommi and Gillan have both said is abysmal. Gillan went as far as blaming Butler, who co-produced the album, for the awful sound quality. Former Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne said in a fall 1983 issue of Circus magazine (article: ├óΓé¼┼ôIs Sabbath Turning Purple?├óΓé¼┬¥): ├óΓé¼┼ôBorn Again is the best thing I├óΓé¼Γäóve heard from Sabbath since I left the band.├óΓé¼┬¥
