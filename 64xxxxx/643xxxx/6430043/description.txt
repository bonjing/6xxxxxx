                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Get the lowdown on the latest mind-reading, metal-bending,                    
 shape-shifting X-travaganza with First Class writer Jane Goldman,             
 director Matthew Vaughn, and cast members Nicholas Hoult,                     
 Kevin Bacon and Zoe Kravitz. As usual, 35mm backs the chat with               
 an awesome array of clips.                                                    
                                                                               
 As their alter-egos square up to one another in mega-prequel                  
 X-Men: First Class, James McAvoy (young Professor X) and                      
 Michael Fassbender (young Magneto) have an altogether friendlier              
 discussion about their roles and the perils of making a blockbuster.          
 They've even got the scars to prove it!  
                                     
                                 Enjoy!
