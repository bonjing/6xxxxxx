                New detective drama series following two officers who
                work in a Manchester police unit specialising in
                murder cases. DC Rachel Bailey, DC Janet Scott and
                the team take on a new case - a young Turkish woman
                has been killed, and her murder made to look like
                suicide. Rachel finds out that the woman's husband
                was having an affair, and takes a risk when it comes
                to interviewing the man's mistress. Will her
                high-stakes approach get results? She also uses her
                police privileges to carry out an investigation into
                her own ex - and is horrified to discover that he is
                married with two children. Meanwhile, Janet agrees to
                take another look at the case of an old school
                friend, Veronica, who was abducted and murdered when
                they were children.
