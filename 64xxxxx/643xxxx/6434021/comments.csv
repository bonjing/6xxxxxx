[V],twentyforty,2011-05-30T17:33Z,"Read  what vampirat said about petdogs. My Trilogy is 500 MB deliberately bigger, but it doesn't satisfies them. They even ""instructed"" me NOT to do same titles and to look what their new.boy has already done and I can encode the rest.

I thought you have seen that ""warning"". LOL. Silly dwarfs from godforsaken country."
,abciscrazy,2011-05-30T19:17Z,"@20-40
ya.. my mistake > Red Riding Hood torrent
(it said 8 seeders.. at 1st.. thought it would get slow... but didn't...)
thanks for doing 352p 350mb RIPS. 
1+

wow... +680 here.. impressive :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-30T20:28Z,"When I seed, I seed with 25400 kB/s (big letter ""B""). That's fast enough for you, perhaps. TPB Statistics doesn't show real numbers, from 2007. onwards."

Superior quality, as always
Thank you "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-30T21:23Z,"So what happens to ""orphaned"" torrents such as B a r r y  L y n d o n?  Is there some kind of ""torrent crawler"" that picks them up and lists them on other torrent sites?  I notice that it is still showing 8 seeds and 13 peers, and is still uploading from my desktop to someone at xxxxxxxxxxxxx.net.cable.rogers.com"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T09:01Z,"Whoever wants to FINISH my B a r r y L y n d o n 480p can drop me a note (e-mail is long header in TV packs) because I still have file on seeding server.
Same applies to ones who have miss it or wish not to burn 8 GB on same, grainy, ugly, UN-restored, ridiculously low quality of that title. I repeat - there is NOTHING wrong in none of the both versions - just Blu-ray is - bad."
,MrSuperGeek,2011-05-31T16:21Z,"Here is the the better version of 'Barry Lyndon' from the AMAZING Blu-Ray restoration, of one of the most beutifully shot movies of all time... who knows maybe even ONE the best Blu-Ray restorations ever released... obviously at 7.9gb not a tiny recode for the iphone crowd!!!

,atak_sanjpera,2011-05-31T17:14Z,I support. Its bad to post diverting links. If I really want another copy; I know how to search.
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T18:32Z,"@vampirat: I hope that some of you, who have witnessed how many times that idiot, not idiot - that MrGeek/FUCKER (that's right - he ruined my torrent) spammed my B a r r y L y n d o n 480p with 5000 CLICKS on ""minus"" - would visit SuprBay Forum and visit and post there a complaint.

@MrSuperGeek: You are idiot. 480p cannot be played on any handheld device. And - rip and encoding of both Sinners and myself are from absolutely same DISK. There is no other.


@MODERATORS: If you want to see who has voted 5000 times ""-"" and spent whole night doing that on one torrent I've deleted - here is the guy - in full glory: MrSuperGeek

,MrSuperGeek,2011-05-31T19:11Z,"Ha Ha... I did Press the minus once coz you am a tard (seriously who would press + or - more than once cept a saddo) and who in their right mind would make up the kinda paranoid BS contained in your comments cept very insecure idiot who talks crap about movies... also judging from your previous comments you know very little about aspect ratios, oscar winning cinematography and or blu-ray restoration... and even less about ""1976""  Stanly Kubrick... I'm not really convinced about your reading skills either or your ability to search TPB for a decent Blu-Ray movie rip... I am begining to realise that there isn't much point trying to reason or communicate with people who take themselves so seriously and you need to to get over yourself...  as you am very much out of your depth isn't you!!!"
[V],pluto999,2011-05-31T19:21Z,"OMG 5000? thats like what 30*5000 seconds atleast!

and whats with this one 878 and only 8 seeders?

anyway the moderator should ban certain IP's 

how are you doing btw?"
[V],pluto999,2011-05-31T19:25Z,"@MrSuperGeek: dude if this guy was infront of you and you started talking shit like this, I promise you would have peed in your pants!

Doesn't Know? What do you know huh? How much experience do you have huh? If you think you know everything, think again!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T21:00Z,"@pluto999: I am as usual, my friend, except This, when I need to reupload same torrent three times. This guy topped all - he haven't even downloaded my encode (cleared on now deleted torrent) which gathered 5035 minuses from geeky-cheeky and he have not the balls to admit it. For worse, he constantly speaks utter rubbish - not knowing what in fact he has been saying. LOL

3 Pages of Comments - of people who tried to calm that guy down. And - nothing, he continues, but now, when ""Rating/voting"" system is fixed, he cannot play same game as the last time. Let see would mods intervene and erase rabid users and their comments without  ANY merit.

This encode is better than majority I have encoded lately and you know that rip cannot be better than source - which in  this case - sorry Stan - is mediocre. Un-restored and one ugly BluRay (and geeky-cheeky speak rubbish)..."

,banukaknight,2011-06-01T02:48Z,MrSuperGeek got a super small Weiner 
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T12:04Z,"Yeah vampirat, I remembered that too. And wrote several comments how evil people can work together.

This guy, on my BL thread (re-upped) blatantly promote Warner Bros. leading people to buy original disk instead of downloading my rip. 

This IS something against whole idea behind TPB.
On any other torrent site ANY user, blatantly or not, for even slightest attempt to ""lead"" people to actually buy disks or tickets - would be banned.
Veterans still remember my words that TPB would self-implode because site failed badly to let go staff members who have joined the forces with enemies of this site allowing them to even have a voice here."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T12:19Z,"I agree with Adapa, not completely, in his answer:

""We can't stop it, only you can, by starving them of the attention they are seeking. Ignore them and they'll get bored and go away.""

Only thing I disagree with is that he would not go away. If they don't get attention - they resort to increase of frequency of venting out and heighten insults level.

Only time when they were stopped is when they were banned and comments were erased, as never existed. Some loonies come back, some not - but they ALL re-think their approach. 

People must feel the consequences of being evil - otherwise they would never change.

Ostrich-strategy is WORST strategy possible."
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T12:45Z,"he = They (people  like this thingy above-small birds making big noise)

Sorry."
,argentosuk,2011-06-08T01:01Z,Thanks for this.
,willwowtf,2011-08-21T00:08Z,Movies sound good. thanks for for all your work.  And for doing something you don't have to do that helps me.  Be Well.
,cybertpb,2012-04-13T05:58Z,"Some one please seed. there aren't any seeds, and the I am stuck on 70% through all 3 files.
