Any possibility of getting Spawn 205 and 206 since they were never uploaded and now 207 is out?"
,grecian722,2011-06-01T15:33Z,"Thanx, I appreciate this, also can somebody upload the current ""Farscape"" series? I semm to be missing it, as I am new to this. Thanx again"
,phaaze,2011-06-01T23:21Z,"I did scan both Spawn 205 and 206 before I did 207, but since this was only a few days ago they didn't longer apply as 0-day and thus is not included in this package.
They can be found with a simple google search:
Spawn 205 (2011) (phaze-DCP).cbz
Spawn 206 (2011) (phaze-DCP).cbz"
