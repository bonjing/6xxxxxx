Dungeons & Dragons: Daggerdale is an action role-playing video game developed by Bedlam Games and published by Atari.[2] The game includes both single and cooperative multiplayer modes and is set in a Forgotten Realms environment.

Bedlam stated that Daggerdale is a video game that uses real-time tactics combat, questing, character development, exploration and a pick-up-and-play feature. Two modes, campaign and freeplay, have been announced. Single and multiplayer modes also exist for the game, including split-screen multiplayer. While some gameplay elements were borrowed from Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, developers stated that this was only the linear part of the game and that the gameplay was inspired from Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes.
The game makes use of the four main D&D character classes: clerics, rogues, wizards and fighters, as well as the four main races, dwarves, elves, halflings and humans. Some customization of the characters is provided as a player earns experience in the game, and character progression advances as per a limited set of 4th Edition Dungeons and Dragons rules for both class and race. Further customization is achieved through loot and equipment drops. Character level advancement is currently limited to level 10.
