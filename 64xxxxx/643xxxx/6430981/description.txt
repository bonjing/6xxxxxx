ART PEPPER SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD
Label Original Jazz Classics 
Original Year 1977
Format:Flac


There was a feeling of relaxed satisfaction on the bandstand during the final night that Art Pepper's quartet recorded at the Vanguard, a sense that Pepper and his inspired rhythm section had captured something important. It can be heard in George Mraz's powerful bass support on "You Go to My Head," in the patented Elvin Jones 6/8 flow of a most memorable "The Trip," in every bar of solo and support from Pepper's favorite pianist George Cables, and most commandingly in the leader's final solo on "Cherokee" (played on tenor sax, though not credited as such on the original album release), with its brilliant tag ending based on "The Theme." Pepper's original "For Freddie" is also added as a bonus track.
