,QborT,2011-06-01T17:57Z,"This rip again is another RC with line audio.  Your source ""BECKS"" is a joke (not a reliable P2P group).  Every single release of this movie has had line audio.

The retail release of this movie is July 12.  A proper retail version won't be released for atleast another couple weeks (most likely near the middle or end of June).

It is a shame that TEHDOWNS pulls this labeling bullshit.  Makes it very hard for new users to get decent copies without wasting their time and bandwidth.  "
,brummie69,2011-06-02T10:29Z,"Sorry QborT, what is your argument in plain English. For the average Joe, this is a good copy. Is there audio issues that my TV isn't good enough to detect (I have only played the first few mins) after I burnt it to DVD."
