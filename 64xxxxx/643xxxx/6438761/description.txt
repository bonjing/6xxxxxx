RELEASE NOTES:

SiSoftware Sandra (the System ANalyser, Diagnostic and Reporting
Assistant) is an information & diagnostic utility. It should provide most
of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your
hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software.

Sandra is a (girl) name of Greek origin that means "defender", "helper of
mankind". We think that's quite fitting.

It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to
go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the
user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can
get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers,
sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, PCI, PCI-X, PCIe
(PCI Express), database, USB, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.

You can save/print/fax/e-mail/post/upload or insert into ADO/ODBC
databases reports in text, HTML, XML, SMS/DMI or RPT format.

This version supports multiple sources of information gathering including:
remote computers, Virtual Machines (VMs), PDAs, Smart Phones, ADO/ODBC
databases or saved system reports.

All benchmarks are optimised for both SMP & SMT (Hyper-Threading), up to
32/64 CPUs depending on the platform.

Enjoy another fine release from HERiTAGE
