'Songs Lost & Stolen' is Bella Hardy's third album and a step up from her previous releases (though they were also good records). Comprising of 100% self written new songs this time around,'The Herring Girl' nevertheless sounds like a classic trad folk tune passed down through the years, while 'Walk It With You' is a lovely country ballad performed as a duet with Kris Drever. The album is produced by Mattie Foulds of The Burns Unit, and, just as with their 2010 debut album, he's done a great job. Highly recommended stuff.
