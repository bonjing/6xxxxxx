Here are six albums from the great 80s UK guitar band Felt. They are all the CD re-issues. As follows:

Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty
Forever Breathes the Lonely Word
Ignite the Seven Cannons
Me & a Monkey on the Moon
The Splendour of Fear
The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories

Enjoy and remember to seed! A word of thanks in the comments section would also go a long way to encouraging me to continue uploading.
