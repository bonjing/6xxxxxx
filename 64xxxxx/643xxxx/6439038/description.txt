[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Source: Imagines Video + Audio thx

Encode:

Imagines Video was very nice to begin with.
The first 8 mins have the right aspect, after that all faces are eggheaded and the video is skewed a lot till the end of the movie.
Had to cut the movie in pieces and corrected almost all parts in aspect and skewed the video as needed to have a straight video.
I didnt really crop anything, just resized the video and added a small border above and below to remain source resolution.
While playing in fullscreen you will notice after the 8mins that the visual black borders get a big more till the end, but thats unnoticeable, since they are not moving around constantly.
Faces are now not eggheaded or skewed, i have done the best possible, took me around 10hours to do that.
I played with colours, brightened darker scenes a bit and completely overworked the audio.
removed hiss,noise,scratches, and resynced some minor syncerrors in the -150ms to +150ms range at 5 places.
also at the 2min mark right in the intro credits the video was away for 30sec, cutted that secs out, no need for 30secs blackscreen.

I am sure Imagine spent already couple hours on doing the video in the first place me afterwards again couple hours to fix the issues.
after all a watchable version now.
hope you enjoy the endproduct.
