,addiction1010,2011-05-29T20:53Z,"Tested this on Ps3, Slim and old with updated firmware. It DOESN'T by-pass the cinavia!!! Still only getting 20mins then audio cuts out!!. I endoded to dvd and played through dvd-player and works with a HD Upscale. But HD on ps3 is a no no."
,blusniffer,2011-05-30T10:30Z,"I got the cinavia too, 3 of these pricks obviously just spotted "" no cinavia-ps3 ready "" on another torrent and thought they would upload in their own name without even checking it.

Waste of bandwidth!"
,moshster,2011-05-30T13:45Z,"Cinavia cannot be defeated.  It's a watermark in the audio, not some encryption that can be cracked.  Expect to see more Cinavia in the future as this is a bullet proof system to protect content.  Just got With It is anonther movie I've found is Cinavia protected."
,ROKKERO,2011-05-31T17:02Z,lose audio around 20 min! good quality but it's useless without audio
,blusniffer,2011-06-01T04:30Z,Sites also state the green hornet and due date have the cinavia watermark but both the bdrips i DL here work fine on ps3??!
,DittoHeadster79,2011-08-12T12:21Z,"Just turn your PS3 clock an hour ahead or something like that, when Cinavia kicks in...by doing so the movie plays fine again about 20 minutes. ThereÂ´s a little clicking during the movie, but donÂ´t bother me too much. "
