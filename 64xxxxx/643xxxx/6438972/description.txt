Trying to compose a commercial set on request for internal use.. no joke.. well this set is everything but not commercial.. here is a Underground House in a Progressive spiral session.. or something like that..
235th Edition is also based on the theorem of the 234th Edition..  I have got some feed back, and I have to say..

â€œThe why of an Answer is the reason of the Question itselfâ€ - "Understand"  Nelson Branco 2009 .. as we can see my perceptive is different.. but.. â€œThe why of a Question is the reason of the answer it selfâ€ .. would make sense but why would I ask me that..?
..Make your choices, the perceptive of Life.. it's yours..
