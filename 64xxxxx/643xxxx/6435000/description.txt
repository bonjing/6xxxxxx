It's finally here! The complete discography of master musician Devin Townsend's 4 Devin Townsend Project CD's. In here, you'll find Ki, Addicted, Deconstruction, and Ghost. The last two are leaks, not due out until mid-late June. But! The piece de resistance are a few bonus tracks from Ki that didn't quite make the cut. One is a more typical song, "Synchronicity Freaks." One is simply Devin testing out some new Fender gear. The last, "Oodles of Noodles," is a 15 minute long jam session. All worthwhile additions for a hardcore fan like myself (and hopefully you).

Of course, if you like these albums, by all means, go out and buy them! Devy relies on sales to keep putting out these awesome tracks, and I want him to keep at it for as long as he can. I know I'll be buying my own copies of the ones I don't have yet, here's hoping you do too!

Anyway, enjoy!
