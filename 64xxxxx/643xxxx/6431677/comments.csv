,abhikrit,2011-05-29T13:39Z,thanks a lot mister twentyforty! 
,abhikrit,2011-05-29T13:41Z,"i have a question twentyforty, the hall pass you ripped, the 352p version, is it watchable in a laptop or pc? because the pc version is not mentioned in the file name? or should i go for the 720p for pc & laptop viewing?"
,abhikrit,2011-05-29T13:43Z,"i mean i read it in your RED RIDING HOOD.. the 352p version, iphone etc were only mentioned."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T14:29Z,All files are playable on PC. Only 352p can be made compatible. Read please a Long header on TV pack torrent - carefully and many times.

Thanks a lot for sharing your ÂŤunique-piece-of-artÂť work. We (your regulars) understand the time and love you put on your shares and that's what makes your gifts so appreciated...
Live long and Prosper Twentyforty."
,abhikrit,2011-05-29T14:46Z,ok thank you
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T15:33Z,"Yeah, word ""compatible"" there means ""make playable on more devices"" not ""less"". Hall Pass 352p is not iPod/nokia compatible, but both Red Riding Hood and Hall Pass 352p are playable on PC/Mac platforms, especially if they're on normal CRT monitors and no-flat-screen TV sets."

,t.trikiti,2011-05-29T18:23Z,"cool, Thanks! (what's wrong with all the minuses?)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-29T20:22Z,"@TT: Shitters were banned and that made them really mad. Don't worry, they already have applied for new handles and are eager to come back - maybe they would learn English in between..."
