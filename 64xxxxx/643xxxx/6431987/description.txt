Product Description
One of the reasons we share our lives with dogs is to enjoy their company â€“ while they help us loosen our grip on this no-nonsense, career-driven world. Once you and your canine pal have serious training (for obedience, basic good behavior, and so on) under the belt, you can take the edge off by injecting the whole training process with some fun tricks and games.

Tricks and games are open to dogs of all sizes, shapes, and ages. Every dog can learn to do something theyâ€™ll enjoy. A Poodle, for example, can learn to dance. A retriever needs to fetch. Bichon Frises love their parlor tricks. Huskies want to pull a sled, herders love to herd, and so on. As for you, the dog owner, you  need to be sure your pooch knows whoâ€™s in charge. You need to be the trainer, not the trained, before you and your dog can move on to tricks and games.

Dog Tricks For Dummies makes trick training fun for you and your dog. You can teach simple tricks, like wagging the tail on command, and more complex ones, like fetching a soda from the refrigerator. This handy guide also shows you how to
# Use basic commands such as Sit, Stay, Down, and Go.
# Teach good manners: Potty in one place, settle in one spot, pick up toys
# Identify your dog's personality: Eager Beaver, Comedian, Bully, and more
# Keep injuries at bay with a health plan
# Teach jumps (and when not to jump)
# Have fun in the snow: Sledding, skijoring, and tunneling
# Go hiking, backpacking, or carting with your dog
# Train your dog to run an agility course
# Play Frisbee and flyball
# Participate in pet therapy and at kids' parties

Sharing your life with a dog shouldnâ€™t be a militaristic venture, selfishly designed around what you want your dog to do. Owning a dog is about joining two different species, two different spirits, in a way that will make the world better for both.
