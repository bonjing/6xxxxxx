Representatives from the Church of Scientology in Bournemouth and Poole are coming to give a talk on their side of the popular story. The talk will be about the lives of the â€˜everydayâ€™ people in the church and how it affects them and will hopefully address many of the questions we have about the church and its place in society.

There will be a question and answer session at the end where the representatives will be happy to answer any questions you may have, donâ€™t be afraid of asking! We will also hopefully be getting a demo of an E-Meter.

We would really like a broad range of views represented in the audience to generate some interesting discussion and comparisons and therefore we encourage members of any of the religious societies or unions in the university to come along.

As always, after the meeting, we will relocate to the Stagâ€™s Head where I am sure discussions will continue. We always enjoy the informal discussions that happen afterwards in the Stagâ€™s so if you havenâ€™t joined us there before, we would encourage you to do so, its always great fun.
