Recent recipient of the lauded "Best Newcomer"
mantle in DJ Mag's 2010 awards, joint head of
the Numbers empire, and all-round good egg,
Jackmaster heads up his first commercially
available mix CD, 'Fabriclive 57'. It's a
proper party session, heavily informed by an
abiding love of '90s dance classics and
underground American funk, coupled with a
penchant for the most virulent emissions of
the current UK scene. These are all BIG
records, starting with one foot in the '80s
electrofunk of The Fantastic Aleems 'Release
Yourself' before stepping into the Juan Atkins
fix of 'Big Fun'. He's got you by the short
and curlies at this point, segueing a path
through the likes of Model 500's 'Night
Drive', Armand Van Helden's deadly mix of Kim
English on 'Nite Life', Anthony Shakir's
'Plugged In', an exclusive Martyn joint
'Alldayallnight' and the bubbling SocaXFunky
of Geiom's '2 4 6'. In the mid section he
cruises through Jook 10's London House anthem
'Emotions', Larry Heard's 'Sun Can't Compare',
Addison Groove's 'Make Um Bounce' and Davina's
Mad Mike-produced piano Houser 'Don't You Want
It', to an outstanding run of CLS's 'Can You
Feel It', DJ Deeon's 'The Freaks' and The
Outlander's 'Vamp' for the hardcore House
heads. The final flush features some priceless
classics, from UR's 'Jupiter Jazz' to Thomas
Bangaltar's 'What To Do', onto AFX's
heart-swelling 'VBS.Redlof.B' meshed with
Skepta's 'Doin It Again' and closing to the
tear-jerking strains of Radiohead's anthemic
'Idioteque'. As you can gauge, these aren't
obscure joints, but the DJ magic lies in his
intuitively programmed drops and pacing,
making for a party mix you'll reach for over
and again. Respect also for not just pulling
out a cache of whites and exclusives, instead
opting for a classic selection that'll no
doubt introduce a ruck of heads to important
dance classics, and still sound good a decade
from now. Bigup
