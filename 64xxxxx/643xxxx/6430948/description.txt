This is my band, Annabel Lee and this is the only album we ever released because of the untimely death of our guitarist and primary song-writer.

We were from Albany and have some amount of street cred around here in the unerground/alternative scene.

Enjoy.  Everything is in .ogg and there is no cover art.  I guess you'll have to suffer.
