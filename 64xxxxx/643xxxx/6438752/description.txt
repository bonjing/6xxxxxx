              Plot.................: In the world of MIDNIGHT, it is a time of overwhelming
 darkness. After three ages of scheming and war, the dark god Izrador has finally defeated
 the heroes and armies of the free races. Now, he rules the world of Aryth with an iron
 fist. Enslaved under the Shadow, the race of men leads an oppressed existence, and the
 elves and dwarves have retreated to distant forests and mountains, where their desperate
 resistance is slowly succumbing to the unyielding might of the Shadow. Investigating the
 disappearance of a legate priest, the infamous Mag Kiln has been ordered by the church to
 travel to the small Erenlander town of Blackweir. There, he soon becomes entangled in an
 old mystery and begins to uncover not only the forbidden legacy of the town, but the
 malevolent, prophetic force that grows within him. MIDNIGHT CHRONICLES is the epic
 narrative that tells the tale of two legendary characters -- one for the cause of good,
 the other for the cause of evil. This is the story of their rise, their struggle, and
 ultimately their fate, as their destinies become intertwined with that of the world and
 the dark god that occupies it.
