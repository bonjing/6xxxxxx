Borderlands is an original First Person Role Playing Shooter that combines the intuitive reward systems of action role playing games and the frantic-paced shooting combat of first person shooters. The game features a groundbreaking content generation system allowing for near-endless variety in weapons and item drops. Borderlands allows for 4 players to share the same game experience simultaneously online in co-op gameplay. Players can freely join or leave each other's games at anytime, or choose to play in the full single-player mode. These features, along with a rich and deep fiction that touches upon the mysteries buried beneath the surface of a danger-filled planet, combine to form a breakthrough experience that challenges the conventions of modern shooters.
