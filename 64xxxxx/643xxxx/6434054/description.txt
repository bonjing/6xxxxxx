Sherlock Holmes and the Running Noose
by Donald Thomas
narrated by John Telfer

This is a reupload of a torrent of mine which had one mp3 for each CD but now will be one mp3 for each story so that each mp3 has the title of the story instead of something like Running Noose parts 1 through 8.. I am doing this with a few Holmes torrents.
I've managed to remove all the 'end of CD 1' and 'start of CD2' announcements for this one as well.
I will add that I didn't take the old mp3 files and edit them. I have the CD set so I just started from the start again - making wavs and editing those in Audacity.

About the book...
Six new tales of crime presented by Dr Watson from the documents of Sherlock Holmes, which follow on from The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes. What were Holmes's views on Dr Crippen? What happened when Oscar Wilde visited Baker Street to seek advice? How did Holmes reveal a loving husband to be one of the most dangerous psychopaths of modern times? And just what horrors await Holmes in the darkened slums of Waterloo Road?
Relating Holmes' part in real-life crimes of the day, Donald Thomas brings the Great Detective to life once again, displaying Holmes at his most determined, inventive and downright devious.
