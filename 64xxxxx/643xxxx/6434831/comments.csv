all trackers say : no one has already got and finished it...
i'm just wondering a question about you bro :
what's wrong with you ?
run in super seed bro and give a suffisant up speed as well...
if you want to seed,you must give at least 50-75 ko/s real...
and unfortunately i seriously doubt you give so much...
even i know and guess you make multi-seed as well...
but don't fall in absurdity bro !
follow my tip :
go in your torrent client and set your up speed to ""0""--->  0 means : unlimited !!!
or set to 75 % of your maximum real up speed so.
seed is the thing,but if you seed bad,that's not cool bro ! you understand what i mean ?
seed with a correct speed and not at a speed of turtle then.
don't cap so much your up speed then.
try ! ty for understanding
regards"
