Mac OS ROM 2.5.1

This Rom allows you to run Mac OS 8.6 (The Earliest OS you can run on this model without the need for emulators)
BUT it is specific to only a G4 400Mhz PPC AGP Graphics "Sawtooth" (The Graphite Tower)

Having said that, it may work on the 450mhz AGP too.
WHY 8.6, you may well ask, the answer is I have some games that only run OS 8.6
You have NO idea, the depths and dark corners of the net I trawled to find this ROM.

To Run 8.6 you need:

OS 9.x
OS 8.6 retail OR Mac OS 8.5.1 AND Mac OS 8.6 Update (Free From Apple.com)
Wish I Were... (A Mac Control Panel to change the Gestalt ID of the machine)

Partition a space on your hard disk or external hard disk for Mac OS 8.6

i)    Install a copy of OS 9.04, or 9.2 or 9.2.1 or 9.2.2
ii)   Intall Wish I Were... On the Mac OS 9 Side.
iii)  On the OS9 side Run Wish I Were...

as it will cause an error.
