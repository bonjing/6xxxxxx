,Slorv,2011-05-31T20:03Z,Thank you - I'll try with vMac
,rspeed,2011-06-01T13:30Z,"vMac only works with a Mac Plus ROM (as it only emulates that one machine). The PowerMac G4 is a completely different architecture. You can use this ROM with SheepShaver, however."
,kewpidstunt,2011-06-02T11:04Z,"I'll second rspeeds' comment.
The very first G4 PPC AGP 400mhz machines shipped with O.E.M CD's 8.6, but very specifically with it's own ROM (version 2.5.1) Hence I had a hard time finding it.

On another note and off topic, (and no I am NOT trying to promote anything or any site)

If your into old games and anything assocoated with abadonware 6k and/or PPC.

www.macintoshgarden.org has a HUGE archive of all this stuff and it all FREE !!!!!!"
