Whomever put this together, please jump under a moving bus."

,honoramongthieves143,2012-01-03T02:04Z,"good god. this is horrible. 1TWISTED, you are a liar, and probably the OP. None of these games will install except for the Detective Agency crap. There are no cracks, and most of these are not even BFG games. I'll be honest, I only tried to install the first 12, but after sifting through hundreds of RAR files, I got sick of it and gave up. Thanks for trying, but this is a ridiculous post. Please don't do this again."
