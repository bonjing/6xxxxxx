This is the 1959 recording of Verdi's la Traviata with Victoria de los Angeles as Violetta.

la Traviata is my favorite opera and I have many recordings of it (old and recent). This is my favorite performance, the cast is superb and EMI did a great job with the digital remastering of this set in the mid 80'.

I hope you will share my enthusiasm for this performance and it's up to you to keep it alive if you like it as I do. 

I will keep seeding for a limited time as I need to take my laptop with me.
