Music by Tallis and Byrd, the two towers of early English music, sung by the superb Kings Singers.

The King's Singers first learned their Byrd and Tallis in much the same way that Elizabethan singers had: by singing in the daily choral services of the famous choir of King's College, Cambridge. The original six were all undergraduate choral scholars at that College, from which the King's Singers also take their name. (two of the present members were boy trebles there). The choir at King's, by statute of its founder, Henry VI, employed exactly the same number of boys and men in Tallis's and Byrd's day that it has now: sixteen boys and fourteen men. The numbers of singers on this recording may therefore be much more typical of the composers' original performance expectations, and the lack of boy voices would reflect the circumstance of many liturgical occasions of Tudor times.

What one articulate fan on Amazon said:
â€œThe King's Singers are one of the best small vocal ensembles in the world today. With beautiful, strong, clear voices, they sing new life into some of the loveliest melodies of the two wonderful English composers. Their voices seem perfectly suited to this music, and indeed their performance itself is essentially perfect--I cannot find a single significant fault with anything on this recording. The quality of singing is absolutely first-rate. In particular, the sound of the male contralto is wonderfully pure. If you like Byrd and Tallis, then you are in for a wonderful treat with a purchase of this CD. If you are not very familiar with the composers, or the Singers, then I am sure this CD will make you quite a fan of both! This is very, very lovely music.â€œ
