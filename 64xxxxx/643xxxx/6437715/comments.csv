[T],V100,2012-02-21T12:27Z,"Very nice documentary with with a lot of docudrama. Has quite a few errors. ie- Claims Pickett's charge ""was well thought out, had a reasonable chance of success""...claims cannon fire would vaporize men. (artillery fire doesn't covert targets to gas just bits and pieces)...Leaves out activity on Little Round Top, Devils Den, The Angle...in exchange for a few personal stories, screaming and gore. Covers activity on Culp's Hill and McLaw well. Quality OK though lots of pixels at times. Thanks"
