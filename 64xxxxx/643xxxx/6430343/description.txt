Sunk

From BBC Radio 4. Written by Mike Walker; Full cast dramatisation; Directed and Produced by Gemma McMullan.

A drama to mark the 100 year anniversary of the Launch of Titanic (31st May 1911).

This is the fascinating story behind the 1943 Nazi propaganda film, Titanic, which was up until then, the most expensive German film ever. The film was commissioned by Goebbels with a view to discredit British and American capitalists. Ironically, this production became a symbol for the corruption and 'sinking' of the Third Reich itself.
