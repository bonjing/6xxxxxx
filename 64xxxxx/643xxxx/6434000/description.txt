This Skin Pack contains 10 skins for PowerDVD 11:

Black, Fluorescence, Gamut, Glowing World, Kopimiiiiii, 
Quattuor, Smokin, Space, Stream of Light & TPB


Changes between the default and the modified skins:

- Replaced the backgrounds* and removed the Feature Icons (logos)
- Changed the autohide delay from the tabs to 1 sec (default = 3)
- Removed the adds (New DVD Release section) from the resume page

* The backgrounds are created from wallpapers by Kol, mX-Steel, 
PerfectHue, DigitalBlasphemy, psdGraphics, & Beaker


Install:

Extract the Skinpack to the skins directory (PowerDVD11\Movie\Skins) 
and run the batch file of the skin that you want to use. The skins 
apply per user account, so each user can apply its own preferred skin.
You can switch back to the default skin by running BlackSatin.bat


Cheers,
