I am uploading a .dmg (or commonly used on macintosh systems) file rip of Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick. For Mac users all that needs to be done is you need to:
1.open disk utility
2.Find the .dmg Ubuntu file and burn it to a blank dvd
For Windows Users:
1.Download a program called transmac

2.Burn the .dmg Ubuntu file to a blank dvd
Thanks for downloading and please message me if you need help or if the torrent is screwed up.:)
