Soon to be the worldâ€™s largest economy, China is attacking on every front, with every available weaponâ€”from protectionism and currency manipulation to cyber attacks and espionage. Around the globe, China is also doing whatever it takes to capture crucial resourcesâ€”even if it means promoting nuclear proliferation by the worldâ€™s most dangerous regimes. Inside the United States, Americans are being injured or killed by the Dragonâ€™s dangerous exports: poisoned food, spiked drugs, toxic toys. Meanwhile, huge U.S. corporations have allied with Chinaâ€™s state-owned enterprises to destroy American manufacturingâ€”and, ultimately and ironically, destroy themselves. 



Itâ€™s an incredible and incredibly shameful story, and Death by China tells it all. But understanding the reality of Chinaâ€™s assault on America is only the beginning. Leading economists Peter Navarro and Greg Autry offer a complete plan for surviving the global power shift China has already engineeredâ€”and halting the Dragonâ€™s onslaught before itâ€™s too late.
