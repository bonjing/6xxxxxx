you're welcome~"
,joaoavp,2011-05-31T21:30Z,"First of all thank you for uploading this, but I think there's something wrong. Here it says the file has 37mn 45s but it actually only has 16mn 35s and ends in the middle of the song ""Hair"". Could you upload the full version?
Thanks again."
,Fonzzz,2011-06-03T00:11Z,"I watched this live at my GF's house.  The last song, ""Hair"" was cut off to go to local programming as per the norm I'm afraid on GMA's concerts...
Uploader: thank you for this!  Do you have more of it (the first song performed where she enters the stage via a zip line and the interview)?  It would be awesome if you could upload all of it.
Also, I did find and see the uncut ""Hair"" songs somewhere else, probably youtube..."
