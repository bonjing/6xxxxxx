,Rockstar-1,2011-05-30T21:05Z,"Was wondering if this can be used along side a legit version of ArmA2:CO?...sorry prolly a dumb question, but hey I'm really high right now...:)"
,TryAgainLOL,2011-05-31T06:55Z,"It should be fine. Here's what happens, when DLCs are installed on existing ARMA (with exe from website):
- 2 new directories are created: BAF & PMC
- registry enrty with new CD-key is added
- new shortcut is created to OA exe with parameter -mod=BAF;PMC
This CD is not cracked and it's checked only at install. So only problem could be with multiplayer, when going online and generated CD-key is not found in  DB. But IMHO multiplayer should still work fine from old shortcuts that do not activate DLCs. 
But still, if there is problem with multiplayer, you can uninstall DLCs afterward (shortcut for this is created), and both directories and registry entry will be removed."
,zooloo75,2011-06-05T22:16Z,Can someone confirm if this actually fixes FADE?
,TryAgainLOL,2011-06-06T04:53Z,"This won't make it go away, if it's already triggered with Arma 2 or OA, but it won't trigger it like SKIDROW release does. FADE triggers on tinkered files or bad serial. SKIDROW release is completely messed up. This is just a clean copy + correct keygen.
To avoid Arma 2 enabling FADE, use iTWINS (tested) or maybe Reloaded (untested) release with themabus' keygen, but don't use self-made custom images that might include cracks in installation. Patch it to latest version.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4974069/Arma.2.CLONEDVD-iTWINS
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6405788/ArmA_II___OA___RFT_multi_keygen
For Operation Arrowhead use FairLight release.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5662702/Arma_2_Operation_Arrowhead-FLT-[tracker.BTARENA.org].iso
If you have those releases installed but got FADE after patching, it's because CD-key posted on web got blacklisted - use this keygen to change KEY in registry (lower generated value is for registry; upper for installation). You won't have to reinstall this way.
I got all 3 installed like this for myself and some buddies, all using keygen and patched up and got no FADE. It can even be played in multiplayer: locally with bots, on LAN or throught Tunngle."
,TryAgainLOL,2011-06-06T05:10Z,"If you want somebody else's experience, look for needlefeet comment at the bottom of the page 4 of SKIDROW torrent."
,zooloo75,2011-06-06T06:58Z,"I have Combined Operations, I paid for it, legal, keys all that.

I am torrenting this one. I torrented the Skidrow crack version, it has FADE. I am going to try this but I keep getting securom errors of 2500, even with ACID cloaking both DTLite and A52."
,TryAgainLOL,2011-06-06T12:22Z,"I make 2 Alcohol virtual drives and 2 DTL, run ACID and Securom passes at least on one of them. On which ones, it looks somehow random to me. Maybe you could try changing virtual drive letters and rebooting. Currently I have G/J for DTL and Y/Z for Alcohol and setup works from all of them. 
My PC and those others I installed it on had Win XP SP3."
,zooloo75,2011-06-06T16:24Z,"Ok, 2 dtl, 2 a52, all of them cloaked, yet I still get the 2500 error for emulation... :\"
,shayour,2011-06-06T18:45Z,"Well, i follow the steps but ... When i want play, it say to me : 

wrong serial number, and i dont undestand why.

I mount the dvd on 3 daemons disc, 2 on alcohol.  I use autorun to install the game.  Next, i use the keygen to bypass the security.  I use the arma 2 rft keygen. all my drivers are cloaked by acid.

Install is done.  I click on the icon to launch the game, there is one file error, not a big problem, i have the screen with bohemian and then, the message : bad serial number.  Drivers still cloaked.

What i do wrongly ?

ps : i havent others arma extensions, nothing."
,shayour,2011-06-06T19:51Z,"ok, i've find the solution.  Very simple : dont use the auto, but the setup icon for reinforcements.  That work now.

Still a problem, i cant patch the game, wrong cd in the driver :/  If anybody have a solution ..."
,shayour,2011-06-07T01:16Z,"And finally, does not work.  I can play without problem until i log off the game.  When i want play a second time, serial number is bad."
,TryAgainLOL,2011-06-07T13:38Z,"zooloo75, I found one PC that would get 2500 from SecuROM no matter what too. Turned out DVD regions for virtual drives had to be set. It can be done from Alcohol options dialog. Also it had newer DTL version which couldn't be cloaked with ACID, so I uninstalled it. Don't know if it matters, I did it before finding out about regions. After all that installation runs from all 3 Alcohol virtual drives I set up there H/X/Y. 
But don't forget to run ACID. If installation was executed without ACID cloaking drives and now returns error 5023 even with ACID running, you have to use SecuROM Removal Tool.

shayour, I tried standalone Reinforcements and it worked fine. It installs and patches (1.58 to 1.59) and had no problems with files or serial. This is the key that I used: 
H5RV-C17HF-E2J5P-0ELHZ-YXERZ 
89c2cde0 b1702e59 09cffe1d df7e34
Maybe your download got corrupted. You could try to rescan it with torrent client."
,zooloo75,2011-06-07T19:11Z,"THANK YOU!!!!
I got the installer running now! Hopefully there's no FADE! Will write back once I test this."
,zooloo75,2011-06-07T19:29Z,"HOLY SHIZ!! This actually works!! I have ArmA2 Combined Operations - Legal, bought etc.

I installed this as DLC, and it has NO FADE!! AND IT WORKS IN MULTIPLAYER! You are the best!

I am of course going to buy this once it hits retail. The only reason I am torrenting this is because I went to Gamestop, and they said it won't come in until some date or something. BUT the game has been out for like ever...

So once it's in stores, I will buy it. BIS are the only devs who care for the PC community, and I will support them."
,zooloo75,2011-06-08T05:25Z,"Ok, same problem again. 2500 error.
I need to reinstall RFT because of an error I got when I decided to try and change my OA key.
I get something about header decryption fail or something when I start up Arma.

So now I have to reinstall RFT and I'm getting the error again. H,X,Y are set to region 1, they are cloaked, and I run the setup and it detects emulation software."
,zooloo75,2011-06-08T17:17Z,"Nevermind, got it to work again.
Kind of a hit and miss deal with bypassing the 2500."
,Bkp666,2011-06-13T20:54Z,Can someone please explain the way of installing this better?

,TryAgainLOL,2011-06-14T09:17Z,"Please make sure that the regions for the virtual drives are set in Alcohol settings. This definately matters for some PCs.
Relation to the drive letters is weird one, sometimes it works with ones, sometimes with others, you could try changing those. Maybe it's just that ACID has a custom cloaking mechanism and it changes along with the drive letters?
Also you could try disabling real physical optical drives in Control_Panel/System/Hardware/Device_Manager. Apparently SecuROM identify some real devices as emulation software.


If nothing works, maybe something gets posted on Alcohol forum (those advices are from there) and hopefully ACID will get updated soon - current version is half year old already.

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Bohemia Interactive Studio
and change the keys for all ARMAs to use the same language settings (second key in the keygen is for registry). Or just reinstall them. Also maybe narrow languages down to a less general setting, though I used default too and didn't have problems with it."

,Sivos,2011-09-09T00:19Z,"Alright, took me a while to get it working, but this copy works perfectly and yes, it is FADE FREE.

First, use Daemon Tools Pro, much easier to work with.  Create an SSCI or IDE drive (I used an SSCI) if you don't already have one.  Mount the image and follow the steps.

Use H5RV-C17HF-E2J5P-0ELHZ-YXERZ for the serial (just confirming that this one works, if your keygen worked then great).

After the game is fully installed (may take about 5 to 10 minutes) start the game and test it.  IF YOU GET AN ERROR saying the addon didn't load or if you get the one that says ""Bad serial used in setup,"" simply run the game in Administrator and everything should work fine after that.  There was a time where I was able to get on fine the first time with no error, but every other time after that I kept getting it.

This copy does work, it's a fast download for its size and despite what TPB says, there are a lot more seeders.
