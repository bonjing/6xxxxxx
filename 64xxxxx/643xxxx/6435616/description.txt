The DÃ¸ is a French/Finnish indie pop band founded in Paris in 2005. The band is Olivia Merilahti (singer and musician) and Dan Levy (multi-instrumentalist). The duo has been backed on stage by three different drummers (JÃ©rÃ©mie Pontier 2007-2008, JosÃ© Joyette 2008-2009, Pierre Belleville since 2009). Their first studio album A Mouthful topped the French charts in 2008, making them the first French act singing in English to reach that position.

Both Ways Open Jaws is the second album by French indie rock band The DÃ¸, released in March 2011.

Mezzic gave them a good review of 8.5 out of 10, saying \"The follow-up to their debut A Mouthful has the band dive further into their freak-pop explorations, still striving to produce better music\" and that \"their sustainable collaboration has carried itself over to a promising sophomore album\".
