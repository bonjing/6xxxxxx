Obviously uploaded tv teams torrent word for word but if you'd taken the time to check it on a ps3 u would discover the title's bollox!

Won't play with audio on a ps3 guys!"
,moshster,2011-05-30T13:47Z,Thanks to Cinavia PS3's days as a media player are numbered.  A decent NetTop and Windows Media Center is the way forward.
,blusniffer,2011-05-31T02:46Z,"I kinda agree but cinavia has been around since 2009 and many forums say if it hasn't been used effectively (causing audio loss)by distributers in this time it won't be even although it was a requirement for BD players to have it.

And as i said on the other torrent, i've watched hundreds of BD's and have 2Tb's of rips but have only seen it twice, the 2nd being Battle LA."
,blusniffer,2011-05-31T02:55Z,"Even wikipedia only list about 20 movies since jan2010 with the cinavia watermark inserted. WTF have it in the device's firmware in the first place since 09 if so few movies are going to use it.
Probably used by film companies/distributers to make the movie look a little more succesful on paper as we have to pay to see it +it looks like a few flops have it, The tourist, wolfman,due date battle LA!  lmao"

,DittoHeadster79,2011-08-12T12:23Z,"Just turn your PS3 clock an hour ahead or something like that, when Cinavia kicks in...by doing so the movie plays fine again about 20 minutes. There´s a little clicking during the movie, but don´t bother me too much. "
