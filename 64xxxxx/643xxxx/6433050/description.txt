Who knew that models use hemorrhoid cream to combat eye puffiness? Diane Irons knew, that's who. She's a model herself and has compiled a bunch of little-known but definitely useful beauty tips. Her advice ranges from the unusual (play classical music at mealtimes and you'll eat less; add aspirin to shampoo to combat dandruff) to the downright wacky (use mascara to touch up hair roots; use antiperspirant on your feet in summer). Hey, if it works, it works! She's also included tons of diet tips, including 50 recipes that check in at 200 calories or less per serving, as well as lists of herbs and supplements to aid quick weight loss. With many of the tips geared toward women on the run, this book is like a Hints from Heloise for the glamour set. --This text refers to the Unknown Binding edition.
