,vbtoons,2011-06-08T01:38Z,Mahalo Adnan1102- You made my day... after trying so many others for 4 months now. 
,nosreg100,2011-06-09T14:30Z,"This really works, best of the best, 100%"
,segadomcast,2011-06-11T13:44Z,"Followed all instructions, but it broke my installation of office somehow :x  I'll try it all again tomorrow after a clean uninstall, I kept crashing and office was saying something about default template changed."
,954blade,2011-06-11T16:05Z,Thanks.
,segadomcast,2011-06-12T03:05Z,"downloaded a different release of office 2010, wiped out all registry settings for office and tried again, worked this time.  Not sure how it broke my original install (my first release worked fine before this activator)  I assume the first release I got must have been adjusted in some way and it was a conflict between multiple forms of a crack.

Either way, thank you for this quality release :)"
,DownloadError,2011-06-12T22:36Z,"wtf is trojan win32/Meredrop ?

Is it the hack or is it some trojan in trhis share?"
,dielaughing,2011-06-22T11:17Z,"I am determined to get to the bottom of this now. I have a PC choked full of cracked software, and I couldn't figure out what was blocking my access to many web sites w/o the use of Tor, the IP randomizing Firefox Browser.. now I just did a fresh install of Windows, only a few apps have been installed, and just 1 of them is coming up hot in AVG saying it's a Trojan horse, AutoKMS and KMSEmulator, which are a direct result of a crack I downloaded for Microsoft 2010, which came in a WinRaR file named: OTK2010V201 and so now, I'm having the same problem as before, web pages are denying me access, and in doing a Google search for this supposed Trojan Horse, I'm not really finding much. If I dig up more truth to this I'll come back and post, but for anyone wanting to be cautious, be aware of what is happening to me in using the 'Office Toolkit 2010.exe."
,ozc,2011-06-28T23:40Z,"@dielaughing 
most likely you're being routed through a proxy. Most likely created by this toolkit. Boot into safe mode with networking and download malwarebytes. Install and run it. "
,i_kills,2011-07-17T15:00Z,Totally Works bro thanks!
,fhaffar,2011-07-17T18:40Z,Works perfectly well....thank you Adnan1102 and JZK
[V],neil1966hardy,2011-08-20T18:19Z,"I was starting to get worried before I found this.

180 days had expired and my 2010 Microsoft Office was only giving me 30 more days.

Tried several activators and none worked until I tried this gem.

Just open the application. Hit the EZ-Activator which is the green button on the picture at the top of the page and within 20 seconds your trusty Office 2010 will have another 180 days of good service!!

Thanks adnan1102 you are a megastar!!!!!!"

,superjy,2011-09-04T14:37Z,"Works great. Just opened and pressed 'activate'.

Disable any antivirus for install (Office KMS software and general cracks set them off all the time).

I scanned the system afterwards with avast! and no threats detected! Cheers!"

,Preky191,2011-12-24T23:19Z,"AutoKMS.exe is a false-positive.  It is NOT a trojan. If you dont trust it, you can remove it but after a while you will need to reactivate Office manually. If you want to know more about AutoKMS.exe check around some forums or articles:

,onyxchen,2012-01-09T19:52Z,"should i delete the toolkit and fix the changes its made to the registy after ms office is activated??
love the fact that microsoft gave me the key."
,craigbrian,2012-01-31T11:57Z,"Works like a charm just be sure you have Microsoft Office 2010 Trail installed.

It CAN'T come pre installed on your computer. and if it does DO NOT HACK IT tell you install the trial

you can get a free Trial key from Googling ""try Office 2010""

If your getting errors update you .Net Framework files you may have to download it manually

after you install it RESTART your computer. "

THANK YOU.....

to anyone else who had problems to start with.

Turn your Anti Virus off for 5 minutes and rerun the software... It makes all the difference...
