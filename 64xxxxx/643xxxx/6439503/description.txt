This book gives new graduate engineers, as well as experienced engineers who need a refresher,
a leg up with their on-the-job training.

Review
"Ashby takes a very practical approach, including a chapter on using tools, and he doesn't leave off on how to use soldering irons. He encourages the strenuous use of people as well-especially of field-applications engineers, which I didn't know existed until I became one upon graduation."
- Rick Nelson, Chief Editor, Test & Measurement World

"This softcover book is aimed at those of you who want a refresher course in electrical engineering or those of you who need to bone up on the subject but don't have the background in it." - Melanie Martella, Sensors Magazine

"One of the best parts of the book is what is termed 'Touchy Feely' and is based around recognising different types of people and how to relate to others, especially your managers and co workers. There is lots of great advice, the first implied bit is recognising who you are and having the honesty to admit it." - Barry Kirby CEng MIET, The IET
