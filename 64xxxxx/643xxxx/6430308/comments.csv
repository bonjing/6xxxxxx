,Tamarind777,2011-05-29T19:59Z,"This movie deviates significantly from the Biblical record. This shows a large group of people, perhaps upward of 500 being, saved from the cities, which would contradict God's statement that He would spare them if 10 righteous were found. Not very Biblical at all. The Bible says only Lot, his wife (who looked back and turned into a pillar of salt), and his two daughters left the city."
