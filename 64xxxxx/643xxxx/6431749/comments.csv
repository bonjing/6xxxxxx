,jenchai,2011-09-26T00:05Z,Can anyone please upload BluRay of Modern Family S02 and Big Bang Theory So4 now.
,manamee,2012-01-19T06:58Z,What's the difference between this one and your other Big Bang Theory Season 4?
,Breslin,2012-02-03T05:31Z,Anyone know where I can find the first 3 seasons like this?
[T],thetorrentlord,2012-02-27T04:39Z,"@manamee: WEB-DL has no logo and was purchased on-line by someone. 720p should mean from an HD TV source (Over the air) and not overly compressed like some of the junk now being posted here in the HD section, but that is another rant for somewhere else. there are certain standards agreed upon by the scene as to what the compression and BPS should be to qualify as a 720p representation. Hope this helps."
,slimshd,2012-03-15T19:59Z,can you upload other seasons of big bang theory ???..coz its grt to watch in hd and web dl version
,lattari,2012-03-30T03:57Z,I suppose there is no chance of getting subtitles for this. Thanks for the upload though
