Also known as Matango, Fungus of Terror and Attack 
of the Mushroom People, is a 1963 Japanese tokusatsu 
movie. It was directed by Ishiro- Honda, written by 
Takeshi Kimura based on the story "The Voice in the 
Night" by William Hope Hodgson (an adaptation credit 
is given to Masami Fukushima and Shinichi Hoshi, but 
Kimura threw out most of their contributions), and 
had special effects by Eiji Tsuburaya.

---------------- TRAILER -----------------
------------------------------------------

The movie has developed something of a cult audience 
over the years; partly due to its bleakness and unusual 
themes, particularly when compared to other Japanese 
films of the same period.

The film was never released in mainstream American 
theaters, but probably did have limited exhibition in 
Japanese-American communities on the West Coast in its 
original language. When it was released by American 
International Pictures in 1965, it was directly 
syndicated on 16mm color film to television as a TV-movie 
bearing the title Attack of the Mushroom People (the title 
is, in fact, placed directly over the original title 
painted on stone, part of which is cropped out of the 
image). With the advent of home video, used TV prints of 
this dubbed version found their way to well-established 
public domain dealers such as Something Weird Video, making 
it available for home viewing in Beta or VHS formats. It was 
at this time that it began developing its cult following and 
its reputation as an unusually disturbing film.

(Filming locations were Hachijo-jima and O-shima,Japan.)

    Encoders Note:
     
      There are a number of torrents floating around
      of this film, yet the best one has 5.1 but it is
      encoded in Italian, so now English speaking viewers
      can now enjoy this classic in Digital Dolby
      surround sound. I increased my normal file size to 
      ensure that video is of the highest quality. - Enjoy!
               
      Production & Distribution Logo's have been removed due to
      video size constraints. Black borders also have been removed 
      to improve Bit/Pixel quality.

      (If your player is having problems displaying the correct
      aspect/resolution then you need to step up to KMPlayer, the
      only player superior to VLC & Media Player Classic!)
