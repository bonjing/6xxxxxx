This is a must see.

@twentyforty

Will u do FF4 in 720p plz plz

@tininibet

99% leeching"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-31T19:28Z,"F4 next week, DownTYU. I know that you prefer 720p but most people who come here for years cannot burn 1.34 GB on my 720p. They are in need of smaller encodes. I wish that I can do both versions, but regarding your ""Have you asked yourself why twentyforty have few seeders"" - you can assume what answer I would give. 99.8% Hit&Runs and no  sharing at all is the true reason. My encodes are not the best, not the smallest - but decent, and of constant quality. And any Multi_Giga 720p hit few hundred seeders just like that."

> Your encodes are well over 'decent' quality. I honestly don't notice much of a difference between 1.1 GiB encodes of 720p shows and 350 MiB encodes of the same show. They may be a little 'blockier' or 'pixelated' and have slightly less deep, true blacks, but the difference is slight. 100% watchable on any HD display/TV. This has good ratings and I've yet to see it, so I'll grab it. [+1]"

,MrSuperGeek,2011-05-31T22:26Z,"More childish gobblydegook... remember Y'All google is your friend... as I said before an Oscar for cinematography and lenses by Zeiss tweaked by NASA... also try this from the blu-ray review ""Barry Lyndon was and is a soft, lavishly lit film that sometimes obscures detail in misty light and insatiable shadow. To that end, the only thing about Warner's 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer that should come as a shock to filmfans is just how wonderfully intact it all is. While the film itself is softer than most, detail abounds. Grain has been preserved, fine textures are in surprising supply, many a brightly lit closeup is near-revelatory, edge definition is true to the source, wide shots are beautiful and painterly, and delineation is excellent (which is quite a feat in and of itself). Through it all, John Alcott's gorgeous palette proves its mettle, fleshtones remain lifelike and beautifully saturated, and black levels are deep and absorbing. Primaries aren't overbearing, nor are they meant to be. Spectacular blues and greens bask in the sun and rich, savory hues wash over every candlelit interior. Moreover, the encode itself is notably proficient. Significant print damage is nowhere to be found, artifacting and banding never invade the proceedings, aliasing and crush are held at bay, and noise reduction hasn't been applied. Only the slightest hint of intermittent ringing, exceedingly minor telecine wobble and a few fleeting flushed faces interfere with Warner's immensely faithful catalog presentation. Barry Lyndon has, quite simply, never looked better"" also if you wanna learn something...you could do a search on 'How the stringent demands of a purist-perfectionist film-maker led to the development of two valuable new cinematographic tools.'"

,MrSuperGeek,2011-05-31T23:04Z,Also if you look carefully at the cover pic... can you see Barry Lyndon is a 'PG' so some of you younger commenters would do well to watch the film with an adult... preferably one able to help explain some of the more adult themes contained within and around this movie!!!
,formerly_azrielle,2011-06-01T04:57Z,"@mrsupergreekstyle
thepiratebay.org/user/MrSuperGeek is MY friend.  Of the 5 (count them-FIVE!) torrents you have posted (all of them FLACs--not a video encode at all), the most seeders listed is 3; More telling, really, is the number of Leechers--a pretty clear indication of DEMAND for your work.  MAX is 1, with two at ZERO.  I guess perfection is overrated, what?

Moreover, twentyforty wrote ""My encodes are not the best, not the smallest - but decent, and of constant quality.""  The last 4 words are all that needs to be said, really.  ""...and of CONSTANT QUALITY!""  Which is all that needs to be said.  

Except that I have been downloading twentyforty's torrents on an almost DAILY basis for the last year and a half--AND I HAVE YET TO FIND EVEN ONE THAT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP!!!"

What size would your DVD treatment yield of Cherry 2000, http://dvd.ign.com/articles/037/037517p1.html
and
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092746/
?
As the first link suggests, it deserves a far better IMDB rating than 5.0 (I watched it so many times that the used VHS rental that I had of it died a slow death).  A version of it exists on TPB at ~700 MB/8 seeders which I am attempting to download, but I've gotten spoiled by your encodes (see above). Whether Yay or Nay, Thanks."

When you have the respect that twentyforty has, then you can comment and we may listen. Until then, keep your opinions to yourself.

@twentyforty ""My encodes are not the best, not the smallest - but decent, and of constant quality."" I have to disagree sir, I would beg to amend to  ""My encodes are the best for the size and are ALL of the highest quality."""
[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T08:01Z,"@azrielle: I remember watching it, but long long ago. I cannot recall Cherry as good nor bad. I don't have DVD and I cannot get one.
Just check the mail, fire up JD and get rip in no time."

I agree with Adapa (TPB  Administrator), not completely, in his answer:

""We can't stop it, only you can, by starving them of the attention they are seeking. Ignore them and they'll get bored and go away.""

Only thing I disagree with is that they would not go away. If they don't get attention - they resort to increased frequency of venting out and heighten insults level.

Only time when they were stopped is when they were banned and comments were erased, as never existed. Some loonies come back, some not - but they ALL re-think their approach.

People must feel the consequences of being evil - otherwise they would never change.

[V],twentyforty,2011-06-01T18:04Z,"@vampirat: I suggested to all to load new torrent and finish the download of movie.
Movie is absolutely the same.
Of course, hash is changed, but it doesn't matter.
Ones who would not spot a lack of seeders and refuse to see what's going on and do as I suggested, I can't care less.

Chance has been given, to download movie in three minutes - and remove burden of seeding from you. Therefore, I suggested to anyone who wants to seed and keep some torrent alive, because he deeply like the movie, to start to seed after I am done, usually 48-96 hours, because it is waste of resources, be shoulder-to-shoulder with seeder who can go (if needed) 27 400 kB/s."
