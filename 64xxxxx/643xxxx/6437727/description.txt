Jacques, Brian - [Redwall 18] - High Rhulain-viny

The otters of Green Isle have been subjugated for so long that they can only trudge on and cling to once-fresh hopes of being saved by the prophesized High Rhulain. Meanwhile, Tiria Wildlough, a youthful ottermaid at Redwall Abbey, dreams of becoming a warrior. When a badly injured osprey arrives at the Abbey, seeking help for its wounds and bringing tales of enslaved otter, the warrior-in-waiting makes her move.
