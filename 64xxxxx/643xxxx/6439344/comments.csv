I respect that u are uploading great classics, but while you're doing that, some movies were released in DVD and Bluray. Such as:

Elephant White
Hall pass
Just go with it

And others, so please try to upload them.
Thank you "

bro.
I'm having little time. if you see my last post in fb, you may get answer. :)
being working on requests, I may not be able to do all new releases. Kindly excuse me. but I would do if those are good. even if so delayed, lol
Hope you all got the answer. 
take care bros :)"
,Venadan,2011-06-03T13:35Z,"@StyLishSaLH
A small suggestion.
most of the uploaders are doing hollywood movies.
Why don't you take the other path?
Concentrate on the jewels of other languages.
Korean, Chinese, Brazilian, Italian, Mexican, Japanese, even Indian also.
It's just a humble suggestion.
It's your privilege to do whatever you desire."
