THIS IS THE FIXED TORRENT. I killed the original. Sorry for my screw-up.

FRINGE- SEASON 1- Fox TV show  H.264 .mp4 (file size = 420MB on average)

I took HD broadcast versions and converted them to H.264 MP4 files using Handbrake with a target size of 420 MB.  The files have a suffix of .mp4   These episodes have video dimensions of 960 x 544 and look great on my 42 inch HDTV.    They can be played on most all iPods, iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs or in iTunes but you may need to change the suffix from .mp4 to .m4v.

Since I converted these I figured why mot save you the trouble and share them.  I haven't watched all the episodes but sampled 20% and found no problems.

As always, feedback is appreciated.  If you see any problems please note them and I'll try to fix.

Season 2 & 3 of Fringe will follow AFTER I see good seeding on this torrent.  PLEASE continue to seed so I can devote my bandwidth to uploading season 2 and then season 3.
   
There are no subtitles or alternate languages.
