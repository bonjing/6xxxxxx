@Robinhoody you click through it like any other download and it WILL start and save wherever you chose to save it, don't mind the 0byte thing, its just how many (if not all) magnet links work :-)

AMAZING album guys, I would buy this if you have a concert locally in a heartbeat, the fact you gave it to us all free is beyond generous, THANK YOU!"
,dark_illusions,2011-05-31T05:52Z,download link takes me to a 404 error yahoo search page and the magnet link brings up a download box but theres no torrent to download its empty

But for fucks sake I'm a GIANT electrofag and I couldn't help but listen to this all day at work. And by flying the black flag by putting this out for free they got my respect from the start. These ladies have something going."

,WiR3D-kNiGhT,2011-06-03T14:13Z,"This is sum good shit, and With a set of Denon AH-d2000's that i just bought its a good thing to listen to.
I consider myself a fan of all types of music, i like this, think the vocals should be a bit more prominent tho"
,daddypop,2011-06-03T23:54Z,"These guys know what is up... Janes Addiction cubed. lyrics are poetic and abstract. Dont know who is singin but he sounds exactly like perry farrell. the band is incredible too. all together very tight. These guys have what it takes to go far. Only thing I would criticize is the name of the band. these guys are way better than the name portrays. I like the INC. but ""Dope Stars""? They can do better than that. Maybe Dope Star Inc.  "
,3ch0null,2011-06-12T21:19Z,I love it! approved quality.
