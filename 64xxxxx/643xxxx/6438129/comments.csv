so here all of you are -

,TheEmpathicEar,2011-05-31T23:59Z,I noticed you uploaded both the Plus Pack and Main Program for v6857 [but not AddOns]. Will these work with the AddOns pack v6696?
,brianxxx,2011-06-01T01:01Z,"It actually Does but it Doesn't. Example - If you create Recovery Media and boot into Full mode it is the correct version. If you boot into Safe Mode it boots into the previous version - 6696.

Each ADD-ON package is updated as well so yes it functions but could make problems you will not see coming. Be warned. lol"

In the past, when I got this here at TPB, the upload included all three: Main Program, Plus and AddOns.

I am not sure if was * nikita200 * though."

This time the issue is different from Acronis"

Thx for replying. But, I don't understand what you mean?

Does the AddOn package have to match the Main Program and Plus?"

I don't know when Acronis leak the new Addons."
,TheEmpathicEar,2011-06-01T13:25Z,"I understand now. Thx for being patient! And, thx for the great up!"
