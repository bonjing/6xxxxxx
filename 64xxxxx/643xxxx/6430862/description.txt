Past Masters is a two-volume compilation album set by The Beatles which was released in 1988 as part of the issue of the bandâ€™s entire back catalogue on CD.[9] Compiled by the noted Beatles authority Mark Lewisohn, this collection of many of the band's biggest hits as well as rarities includes every song released commercially by the band that was not available on the Beatlesâ€™ twelve original UK albums or the Magical Mystery Tour LP.

The majority of the Past Masters set consists of A and B-sides from the band's singles, including single versions of songs that appeared in a different form on the band's albums. Also included are the full contents of the UK-only Long Tall Sally EP, two German language tracks, a song recorded for the American market and a track released on a charity compilation album.

The â€Past Mastersâ€ name had previously been used by EMI for a series of three unrelated reissue singles.
