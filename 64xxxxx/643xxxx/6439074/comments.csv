,mjyumping2,2011-06-01T06:44Z,"No cracks (.exe overwrites) not needed
Cracks should not be applied to use this Mini Image. So if you already Applied the crack, reinstall the sims 3 and don't apply the crack again."

Thanks"
,aishakeys,2011-06-05T21:51Z,How do you install this not many intructions im using magic iso.
,mjyumping2,2011-06-06T13:48Z,"No ""copy paste cracks"" should be applied when using this technique.
If you don't want t use this anymore(only if), u can always put on the cracks back.

Someone is Complaining about ""they should mount the mini image everytime they play the game"". well, that's true. And there's a technique that everytime you Open your PC, the mounting software automatically mounts the mini image. 

Here's How:

for Daemon tools:
*Right-click on the Daemon tools icon on the system tray.
*Choose 'Preferences'.
*Under General tab, check the ""Auto start"" and ""Auto Mount"" Check Boxes.
This will auto-mount the last mounted image.

,misshanz,2011-06-08T06:17Z,But what if I have other P? which also have been cracked? Can I still use this?
,misshanz,2011-06-08T06:17Z,"EP* expansion packs. I have only 1, which is Late Night."
,mjyumping2,2011-06-10T16:09Z,"@misshanz
don't you know that when you got the Original Version of The game and all of it's EPs, you only need to insert the last EP that has been released by EA?
As I have said, this simulates the Dvd pretending that the dvd is inserted, because that's the Disc check by EA.

@misshanz
You only got LN? Why are you looking here? No, this only works for GEN, because the dvd of GEN is differ on LN's."
,xavierterro,2011-06-20T00:36Z,This is great!
,MasterBattousai,2011-08-01T07:24Z,Mjyumping2 if I installed The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle 2011 plus the Generations EP by .BONE. and the only patches I used where the SUPERPATCHER from http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/175477.page and the The Sims 3 Ultimate Bundle NO-CD Patch.exe do I need to unistall the game and not use the patches to be able to use your mini image to be able to update?
