Click on FILE/Options/Disable header removal compression...
Nothing wrong with the audio. 
The later versions of mkvmerge are the problem.
Version 4.0.0 is way better, less problems, more compatible with xbox etc. "

Question... Are all the mkvonly releases like this? I've started downloading them (because they're friggin sick), but I haven't gone through and reviewed them. Will I be able to run the .mkv file through mkvmerge again and apply the ""proper"" settings, or will I have to re-download and start again?

To anyone who says the quality isn't worth it, you obviously don't ""get the picture"" ;P"
,minjigga,2012-01-07T07:25Z,"Actually there is something wrong with the audio.

If you listen to the track by itself, you still hear that messed up portion Zacno was talking about.

Also, tried your fix, no happy happy joy joy.

Its in the audio file itself, not mkvmerge :(

I'm gonna try downloading a 720p copy with dts and extracting the audio from it.. don't know what else there is to do."
