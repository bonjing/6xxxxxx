,capoeira4u,2011-06-27T19:10Z,"Someone help pls, I'm stuck in demo mode.  Even though I'm pretty sure I've done everything correct, I can't type or paste the new serial number.  I can click inside the text box, but I can't type or paste anything into it.  Here's how I installed it:

>turned off wifi > completely uninstalled previous version > restart > installed this new version > restart > blocked Little Snitch UIAgent > opened preference in order to register...but can't type"
,wimr,2011-07-02T23:21Z,When it expires you must take another serial nr.  from Little Snitch 2.2 32sd31xl30-732gu-hdd2p3l2fx
,wimr,2011-07-02T23:30Z,Use this serial nr. 32sd31xl30-732gu-hdd2p3l2fx
,wimr,2011-07-09T17:39Z,"The number I gave expires too.
Just try this number 32RN3CWNU0-73DKZ-7CS48M55EA
This number does the trick for me."
