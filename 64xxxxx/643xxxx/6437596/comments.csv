,sell-out,2011-05-31T13:58Z,"look at your torrents from the last week, 75% of your torrents are getting left incomplete,many people are getting nothing from you,people are getting fed up with your lack of seeding so sort it out,this one im trying to get from 7 days ago has stopped at 67%

,srisuk,2011-05-31T16:16Z,I'm having no problem at all downloading lots of great movies from this seeder. Maybe you should check your internet connection. 
,cujimmmy,2011-05-31T19:07Z, scenebalance uploads Tons of Quantity but no Quality. Never seeds and is the biggest waste of space on the Pirate Bay.  Sell-out is 100% correct. In my opinion this Uploader should be demoted back to the ranks and lose the Skull. 
,shmeghead,2011-06-01T08:16Z,"Yeah, I gotta agree. Lots of good torrents, but very few complete. If they want a green skull SEED."
