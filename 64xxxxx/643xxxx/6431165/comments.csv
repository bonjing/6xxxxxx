,cranyonrye,2011-05-30T03:17Z,"Thanks a lot for the upload torrentzone...jahnee MMA is fake and Choreographed anyone with half a brain knows it is.  If you want real fighting stick to Boxing, though there's sometimes a little too much love there too."
,applehack,2011-05-30T05:29Z,"THANK YOU UPLOADER! The quality was perfect. UFC 130 was great!

,rickyno1,2011-05-30T14:45Z,"cranyonrye, you are being sarcastic, right? Choreographed? i think you will find thats pro wrestling my friend"
,Finitless,2011-05-31T02:51Z,"fuck you rickyno1, honestly it's people like you throwing around these categorizations that make us all hate each other. I don't give a damn where you heard Americans are bad people, you don't have to bring that bullshit onto the internet where everyone should be treated equally. Sure jahnee was being idiotic, but how the hell does that make you assume that he's American? How many Americans have you actually fought to make the assumption that Americans can't fight, you ignorant piece of shit. How about stop being so fucking judgmental based off of whatever media that's manipulating you. America's a bully country. We know. But you don't have to corrupt every single decent place you can find with your hated towards a WHOLE COUNTRY. Think about whatever ethnicity or religion you have. Now make an educated guess at how many people may be like you that also live in America. WE'RE NOT SO DIFFERENT AND NOT EVERY AMERICAN IS LAZY AND FAT. Quite making uneducated conclusions and live to better everyone around you."
,saltriver,2011-05-31T04:17Z,thanx man.love mma
,Citizen87,2011-06-01T06:25Z,"cranyonrye ...you must be smoking crack or something, UFC is not fake... it's based on Brazilian  Jiu Jitsu, which when necessary can be deadly... Wrestling like ""WWE"" is fake... and Boxing... yeah sure they can fight an all that, but half the time they're taking pay offs to take a dive anyway... "
,yhcranA,2011-06-01T11:14Z,"""...Oh and i bet your american lol."" So, Ricky No. 1, what does that mean? Based on your inattention to spelling and punctuation, I'm going to guess you're not American...or even English for that matter? (See what I did with two of the three meanings and spellings of the word ""your"" there? Neat, huh?) Let me show you what it should look like, please: A) ""Oh, and I bet you're European. Lol."", or B) ""Oh, and I bet you're Canadian. Lol."" There, see? I certainly hope it's not B. That would give a person no excuse, aside from poor schooling, for being ignorant of how to write properly in English. Before you gallop around running your mouth on the Internet (brave occupation, i might add), perhaps at least brush up on proper spelling and punctuation. Just a tip, kiddo. Cheers!"
,yhcranA,2011-06-01T11:22Z,"Lol. Nice, Finitless. Rickyno1, I'm curious...is that Ricky No One? Or Ricky No.1, and if so, what precisely are you number 1 at?"
,darksfall,2011-06-03T23:11Z,"If anyone thinks UFC or MMA is fake then they seriously need to do their research or at least participate in the sport, these guys are fighters pure and simple, many of them have fought in other sports like kick boxing, boxing, or other MMA events like cage rage and battle arenas, so try and use your brain before you accuse them of being fake.
