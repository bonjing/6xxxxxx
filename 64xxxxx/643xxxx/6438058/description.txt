Release Notes:

Along with Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder reluctantly became a celebrity and an
alt-rock spokesman when his band, Pearl Jam, hit the big time in the early '90s.
But things didn't come easy for Vedder. With a tumultuous home life as a
youngster, he turned to surfing and rock music as a teenager -- most notably
such classic rockers as the Who, Neil Young, and the Doors, as well as such punk
bands as the Clash and Minor Threat. His residence alternated between Chicago
and San Diego, as he formed his first real band in his twenties, Bad Radio. With
the band not breaking out of local status, Vedder befriended ex-Red Hot Chili
Peppers drummer Jack Irons, who in turn gave Eddie a demo tape some of his
friends had given him (in hopes of finding a singer). Vedder quickly put lyrics
and vocals to the tape, and mailed it back to Seattle (it turned out the band
consisted of ex-members of the Seattle-based Mother Love Bone, guitarist Stone
Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament).

Gossard and Ament were floored with the results, immediately inviting Vedder up
to Seattle, where he soon landed the gig. Shortly after lead guitarist Mike
McCready joined the band (plus a revolving door of assorted drummers), the band
signed with Epic Records. Originally called Mookie Blaylock, the group changed
its name to Pearl Jam, and their debut, Ten, followed in the fall of 1991. With
the Seattle scene (Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, et al.) exploding on
the charts, airwaves, and media, Pearl Jam picked the perfect time to issue
their debut, which eventually outsold all other Seattle bands, and made Pearl
Jam one of the biggest groups of the '90s (other hit albums followed: Vs.,
Vitalogy, No Code, Yield, and Binaural).

Vedder also became involved in numerous politically charged causes -- his band
took Ticketmaster to court over high ticket prices, and he supported
presidential candidate Ralph Nader, environmental causes, and his pro-choice
stance. He also made special appearances at numerous concerts of bands he
admirers (Bob Dylan's 50th B-day bash at Madison Square Garden, the Tibetan
Freedom Concert, Who/Pete Townshend gigs, etc.), and played drums at live shows
with the band Hovercraft (his wife's band). With his hard-hitting and often
confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became
one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock. Despite all the accolades,
it wasn't until 2007 that Vedder released his first solo album, Into the Wild,
the soundtrack to the Sean Penn film of the same time.
