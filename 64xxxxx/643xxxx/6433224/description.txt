After his last visit with Alexandra, Dr. Phil vowed he would not speak with her again unless she agreed to enter rehab for what he believes is an addiction to prescription pills. But, because heâ€™s committed to the well-being of her three young children, he sends recovering addict and former Dr. Phil guest, Brandon, and his mother, Debbie, to stage an intervention in an attempt to save Alexandraâ€™s life. Is she ready to hear what her family has to say?

â€œIâ€™ve been hearing all of you say, â€˜Why are you wasting your time on this Alexandra?â€™ The why is simple: There are three innocent children involved here," Dr. Phil says.
