Sunglasses Modeling
Video Tutorial for modo 501

This new series of video tutorials by master modo modeler Adam
Ohern is ideal for designers or anyone interested in hard-surface
modeling techniques in modo 501. It starts at the very beginning
covering everything from the overall modo user interface to the
most commonly-used tools and techniques for hard-surface modeling
and rendering in modo. A rapid prototype of the glasses are
produced as part of the tutorial

Step-by-step instructions walk the viewer (that s you) through
the process of modeling and rendering a pair of whimsical sport
glasses from reference images and using a head mesh as an
underlay. Every step is fully-documented and repeatable, and each
video progressively introduces modo tools and techniques in an
understandable (not overly lengthy) session. modo files are
provided for each phase of the project so you can start at any
stage of the project

In addition to the emphasis on modeling and basic rendering
techniques in modo, there are two "bonus" videos that lead you
through advanced rendering, and printing an inexpensive rapid
prototype of the glasses at the Shapeways website
