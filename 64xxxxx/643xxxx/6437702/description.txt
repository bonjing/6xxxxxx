In the fourteenth Redwall novel by New York Times bestselling author Brian Jacques, the clan of Sawney Rath kidnaps one of Redwall's own-a baby otter who they believe is destined to become their Taggerung, the warrior hero of ancient legend. But as the young Taggerung grows, he rebels against his destiny and goes off in search of the place he was born-a home he can barely remember. Tagg is pursued by a member of Sawney's clan, out to destroy the deserter and claim the title of Taggerung. Is the otter the Taggerung after all? And if he is not, who is he?
