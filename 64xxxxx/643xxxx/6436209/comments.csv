,danibo77,2011-07-05T20:18Z,"Way to slow download, and NOT entirely worth the wait..."
,danibo77,2011-07-05T20:18Z,"The first one is decent, while Revenge of the Fallen is not the best rip.. it even has letterbox black bars over and under..."
,danibo77,2011-07-05T20:20Z,Not too happy with the video-quality. For 8 GB I expect more than I get from a 4 GB release and this was not it.
,danibo77,2011-07-05T20:21Z,"Decent, but nothing more!
(had to break the text to actually be allowed to post it..)"
