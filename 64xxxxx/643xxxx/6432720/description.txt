Star Trek New Voyages/Phase II: Episode 1x06 Enemy Starfleet

Surprised me with this episode, it actually came out the same year as episode 5!

I downloaded this episode from their own tracker and torrent. It was in the H.264 mp4 format which plays fine if you have your video setup correctly. But it's a pain in the ass if you don't. So I took it and converted it over to a nice avi file in XviD format (the average for TV RIPS/DVDRIP episodes) for those that don't want the H.264.
