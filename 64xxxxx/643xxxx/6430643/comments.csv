,shores,2011-05-29T02:53Z,Thanks! These uploads mean a lot to me!
,VeritasB,2011-05-29T03:16Z,Fucking legend.
,VeritasB,2011-05-29T03:53Z,"BS Spam in an F1 torrent? Fail. 

Seed mofos, seed! Muahaha, I've opened my upload to unlimited, and it's going slowly, does no one want the qualifying or what?"
,VeritasB,2011-05-29T05:04Z,It seems like the other 3 seeders who got this afterwards have closed their upload. Wish we could find out who these people are and just block them.
,VeritasB,2011-05-29T05:26Z,2 seeders dropped? Pricks.
,yaksox,2011-05-29T05:52Z,There would be more seeders if the file size wasn't so big. Truth is HD isn't that popular. Few people have the bandwidth to d/load this.
,VeritasB,2011-05-29T06:20Z,"That's not true at all mate, look at some of his other uploads of the past races in HD, some have 300+ seeders."
,yaksox,2011-05-29T07:57Z,"I guess you're right. I'm getting better rates now and am upping plenty. The germans get thiers up faster, but I guess it airs on telly earlier there."
,srr37,2011-05-29T19:31Z,"all these HD races are having framerate issues on all 3 of my pc's ( vlc)- any thing i can do besides buy a newer one lol? 

thanks for the ups"
,srr37,2011-05-29T22:46Z,"ya, i'm surprised cuz I watch other 1080p with no problems."
[T],V100,2011-05-30T06:14Z,Thank you
,FyiMfer,2011-05-30T12:45Z,"LOL @yaksox ""HD isn't that popular.""  I don't have incredible bandwidth and I still go for 1080p any chance I get"
