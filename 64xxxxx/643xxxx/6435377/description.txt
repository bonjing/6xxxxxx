       I Hate My Tattoos                                                 
       Over one third of all Americans currently sport at least one      
        tattoo. But what happens when you come to hate the markings
        you've permanently etched into your skin? On this episode of
        True Life, you'll meet three young people desperate to get rid
        of the tatts they feel prevent them from fulfilling their
        potential.
        Larry is now sober after years of abusing drugs. He believes his
        ink will keep him from getting a decent job -- so Larry's mom
        has agreed to pay for their removal as long as he remains clean.
        Will Larry be able to fight his destructive urges -- or will his
        addictions prove too hard to overcome?
        Ali was devastated when her fiance left her -- and now the sight
        of his name on her arm is making her skin crawl. Ali wants to
        get the tattoo covered up but is learning that the process isn't
        a simple one. Will Ali find a way to hide her ex's name -- or
        will she be forced to live with this painful reminder of her
        past?
        Jayson's fiancee wants him to get his tattoos lasered off so he
        can land a higher paying job. But Jason is terrified of the pain
        involved and is having second thoughts. Can Jason endure this
        excruciating process so he can build a more solid future with
        his wife-to-be?
        The mistakes of their past are indelibly inked on their bodies.
        Will they find a way to wipe the slate clean? Find out next on
        True Life: I Hate My Tattoos.
