Arriving four years after This Is Forever showed just how closely She Wants Revenge could follow the post-punk and synth pop rule books, Valleyheart injects the bands sound with some much-needed ambition and eclecticism. A concept album about the San Fernando Valley and the turbulent relationships of its denizens, this set of songs proves once and for all that while She Wants Revenges influences may be from New York and England, theyre undeniably a product of Los Angeles.
