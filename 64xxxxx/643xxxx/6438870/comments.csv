Thanks.
If anyone like to download fast go to properties Max upload rate set 50kB/sec There you set go to sleep and after download keep it running.Copy all the files in another folder and than extract it.
Use Blank DVD-R, Use DVD Decryptor Go to Mode click ISO then write. Set Max Write option at 4x. There you have burned DVD."
