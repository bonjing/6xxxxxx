I am uploading Xubuntu (Which is kind of like regular Ubuntu with a different interface and is usually ran on lower spec systems) 10.10.
All you need to do is burn this .iso Xubuntu image to a blank dvd and you will be good to go. 
Check out my other linux distros and please seed!
NOTE: I AM ALWAYS SEEDING EVEN IF THE TRACKER SAYS THERE ARE NO SEEDERS I AM ALWAYS SEEDING!u
