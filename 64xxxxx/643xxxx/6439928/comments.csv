,bucsab12,2011-06-04T23:50Z,"Thanks dada_sh for the great upload.

I was able to install the file and everything went well with the registration but whenever I'm trying to download something I get the following error in firefox: ""Cannot transfer the download to IDM ERROR 0x80004002"". I looked for a solution but couldn't find anything that would solve the problem. Did it happen to anyone? 
Thanks in advance."

,luckygab,2011-06-06T17:18Z,nice job...DLing it now..hope it works for me..
,bucsab12,2011-06-10T22:42Z,"Thanks dada_sh for the response. 

I have tried to use the two uninstall files under the IDM directory. After using the one that uninstalls the program, the ""idmmzcc3 "" folder did not appear under the roaming directory. If I used the other uninstall file (that you have created), there is a ""idmmzcc5"" folder but after deleting it and reinstalling it still did not work and showed the same error. Maybe I am not configuring the software to work correctly but when I go into the options under the downloads tab all the browsers are marked. I was able to download the program from the official IDM site and use the serial you have provided and it works great. Not sure what I am doing wrong though. Thanks again for the help."
