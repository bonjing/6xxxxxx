,extradry,2010-12-02T06:15Z,thanks for the upload it's a good movie. now all we have to wait for is paranormal activity 2!!
,Netarangi,2010-12-02T09:15Z,"""Download and find out"" lol wtf kind of comment is that? The whole point of them asking is so they don't need to waste their time downloading it"
,vinay749631,2010-12-02T09:38Z,always good from your side
,jackblackstudio,2010-12-02T11:18Z,"Netarangi you work for some shady newspaper? I like how you selected the quote ""Download and find out"" while totally avoiding the end where SAFCukO09 says ""..... yes real"". Either learn to quote or learn to read the full comment. Anyways thanks to the uploader. Great movie."
,lakedima,2010-12-02T12:10Z,"@Netarangi

maybe SAFCukO09 said that because this is his torrent and anything other than ""Download and find out"" would be meaningless to say????"

,Zero236,2011-01-28T09:06Z,"thanks SAFCukO09, another quality DL"
,idizzle,2011-04-17T04:04Z,"Its real, but the video quality for a DVDrip is quite atrocious. 

V/6
A/9

There are quite obvious square throughout the compression. I suggest you download the FXG version, his encodes are usually really solid."
