I've been waiting desperately for someone to upload Golden Sun and 999!
You are truly an awesome person!"

i'm not sure if i can put the link on here but if you google (9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors AP Fix 1.0) it should come up with the filetrip website to fix the Freeze on the First Puzzle of 999. not sure if it fixes any other freeze in the game though."

It is as you say Sonic and Golden Sun seems ok (only tried a few minutes each) but 999 freeze randomly, it is really sad it seems like a really good one I hope someone's gonna put up a patch or something to fix this issue.

,Gekkie11,2011-01-09T22:14Z,Tried 999 and Golden Sun. 999 freezes all the time and Golden Sun doesn't even start so this shit is crap.
