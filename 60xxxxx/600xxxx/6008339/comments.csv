,ama332,2010-12-03T18:12Z,"Heard great things, really looking forward to this one. Thanks as always!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-03T18:36Z,"Thanks. Believe it or not - that's my fifth encode of The Town. Previous four was too ugly to be released. Impatient P2P groups meanwhile ""poisoned"" the Net with six-seven bad encodes.

@himansu_007: I have done all while ago (on mininova) and I would try to find living copies, but chances are slim to none.
And - request are ""frozen"" indeed till Xmas."
,muhu88,2010-12-03T19:42Z,What about the quality is is better than FXG?
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-03T19:56Z,"@himansu_007: Found all. However, they are all 272p (iPod compatible) - and I would not be doing new encoding of these. So - if that's acceptable I can put them all together in future 272p I plan for the weekend."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-03T20:08Z,"@muhu88: For a month fakes floating around, one is tagged FXG.
Diamond is good, for sure. Just 1 frikkin GB bigger."
,himansu_007,2010-12-03T21:15Z,It will be great
,megodtoo,2010-12-03T21:49Z,"Thanks twentyforty, that saved me from downloading a 700MB file. Thanks for saving my bandwidth. All your releases are Good Quality. :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-03T22:13Z,"@megodtoo: You saved even more. Ever single The Town XviD totally fell apart more times - anyone can watch from 1h55 - 1h56 when Hamm say ""We are national organization."" and how video - in all encodes except Diamond's - completely fell apartin next seconds... 

This is because of stupid need ""to be first"" and therefore P2P nowadays use 1-pass encoding to save the time.

That goes on cost of us - suckers, and I would never understand why so many people burn so many terabytes every time, downloading total shit and came here to voice their frustrations out."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-03T22:16Z,"err.
Ever = Every

apartin = apart in

Sorry."
,megodtoo,2010-12-03T23:24Z,"twentyforty, cheers. Your postings are always sort after by myself and of course others. May I ask what software you are using to convert? I have a Twin TV Tuners in a laptop...And use a 2 pass to cut Windows MTV Recordings in size and cut Commercials and Covert to MPEG4 file (.mp4) with MCEbuddy 1.1 beta1. This does not always work well. And  does not convert to MKV. What do you use for that please?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-04T08:19Z,"@megodtoo: I use my own, and my toolchain is too simple to be of any use for public - it's completely command-line based.
Many people followed my advice and got HandBrake. It's open-source, free, very good and - has GUI. Cross-platform (PC, Mac, Linux).  Just Google. (and I do not know too much about, this is not a right place)."
,Fangular,2010-12-04T13:08Z,You're a *legend* 2040 - thanks so much!
,megodtoo,2010-12-04T14:24Z,"Cheers
Thanks"
