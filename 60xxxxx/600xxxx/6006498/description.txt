Discouraged Ones (stylized discÃ¸uraged Ã¸nes) is the third full-length album by Katatonia released in 1998.

While most of the band's previous efforts included distorted or screamed vocals, Discouraged Ones, and all of the band's subsequent releases, feature almost exclusively clean vocals, mainly by Jonas Renkse who also makes this release the last time he plays drums for the band. This is also the last Katatonia release with Mikael Oretoft.
