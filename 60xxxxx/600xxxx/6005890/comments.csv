,dlectro,2010-12-22T12:05Z,"I'm on a MBP 2010, VLC Mac, Predator 1: seeking is very slow.
Seeking in much higher bitrate videos work fine.

Also there's no Hungarian audio in it (despite as stated)!"
,dswift00,2011-02-27T17:30Z,"I only managed to DL ""Predator"" and noted lots of missing ""images"" causing audio sync issues - evident in mencoder and tsmuxer.  Not sure of the quality of the others.  First appears at downed chopper and frequently from there on.  [snip][h264 @ 00ff4054]reference picture missing during reorder
