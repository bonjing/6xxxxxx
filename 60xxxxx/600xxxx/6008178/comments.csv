,lebang,2011-01-03T17:58Z,Disney XD UK aired only 8 episodes. GF 3 in France has 19/26 eps but they probably have holiday brake or something. In UK eps 1-4 were aried in July and 5-8 in September. I think that they will broadcast more episodes in January.

,cosminbh,2012-06-12T14:35Z,"i wonder too when the rest of the episodes will come preferably in english but i wouldn't mind them in french with english subs.
I really miss the old days where Fox Kids/Jetix was avaible in my country.I really hate Disney Channel they have only stupid shows."
