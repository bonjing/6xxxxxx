,Joker-Face,2010-12-19T03:01Z,"Audio/Video is amazing. However, once burned to a disk and viewed on a PS3 or other player, a loud screeching runs through the entire movie. "

If you use VLC you can choose to disable the subtitles.  Otherwise delete the .srt file and they'll be gone!"

,Malachi05,2011-02-03T23:32Z,Not sure what everyone is talking about here.  The torrent is perfect.  A/V 10s
,KEITH864,2011-02-04T07:46Z,"Quality is not fucking perfect fuckheads. There is a massive green line going diagonally through the screen.

Trust me don't download unless you want to watch it with the big green line."
,ursak,2011-02-07T04:21Z,"Using sharks codecpack for win 7 and playing the move in windows own standard mediaplayer. No green lines and superb quality for such a small size.

So don't listen to KEITH864. If he's telling the truth, then the problem with the vid has to do with his config or his computer is broken."
,smithwigglesworth0,2011-03-08T15:28Z,Didnt Work for me .. When I opened. It was just a black Screen
,yankijoe,2011-03-10T11:44Z,Tkx i dld in undr 17 mnts
