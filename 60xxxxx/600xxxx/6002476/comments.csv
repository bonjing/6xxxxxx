,theshowstopper34,2010-12-01T21:49Z,"Works absolutly fine. But this is the old Snes version, not the new updated one thats out in the UK shortly.  Still worth a look though.  "
,SpitvenoM,2010-12-01T23:53Z,"@theshowstopper34  unfortunately nintendo didnt feel the need to update any of the backgrounds or anything else in the games they left it exactly the same as the super mario allstars on the snes so you would be better of using snes9x and downloading the rom of super mario allstars + world, much smaller file size and you get super mario world aswell. Having said that i am still downloading this lol thanks SOSteam for the up."
,theshowstopper34,2010-12-02T01:59Z,Oh i didnt realise!  already have the snes version.  Couldn't resist seeing what the 2010 version was like!!
,TaZeRz,2010-12-02T07:14Z,theshowstopper34 - This is it buddy this is what the new super mario all stars is basically a SNES port I don't know what your expecting.
,Strikefear13,2010-12-02T07:47Z,"Can you link to this ""remade"" one from the UK? As far as  I know every version of the anniversary collection comes with the same old copy of All-Stars."
,karliboy,2010-12-03T11:13Z,dont get too excited chaps! it is just mario all stars old snes version on the wii. nintendo are taking the piss! might as well get the snes rom
