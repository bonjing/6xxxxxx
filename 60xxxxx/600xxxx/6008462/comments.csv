How is this A=9???
Did you even watch the movie before commenting you prick?!
The audio is from a cam mic.
This is the original info about the audio:

AudioEncode:
wbz audio is a bit dull but has the clearest voices without sounding too metallic.removed hiss,hum,noise and ran it trough a speech filter to loose some dullness.corrected most of the oose parts of the audio which are within the first 10 mins up to +-500ms.its still a mic but its hearable.wanted to do a 5.1 mic but it is not possible, the effects are too loud and the mic goes under.tried to lower the gain of the rears to get them in relation to the front, still sounded worse then letting the mic like it is.enjoy"
