    In Richard Miles's epic story of civilization, there       
    have been plenty of examples of the great men of          
    history, but none came close to the legend of Alexander  
    of Macedon, known to us as 'the Great'. Uniting the       
    fractious Greek city-states, he led them on a crusade      
    against the old enemy, Persia, and in little more than    
    a decade created an empire that stretched from Egypt in  
    the west to Afghanistan in the east.                      
                                                               
    But it was Alexander's successors, the Hellenistic        
    Kings, who had to make sense of the legacy of this       
    charismatic adventurer. By knuckling down to the hard     
    graft of politics, taxation and public works, they         
    created something far more enduring than a mere legend    
    - they built a civilization.                             
                                                              
    Richard traces Alexander's battle-scarred route through    
    Turkey, Syria and Lebanon to Egypt and ultimately to      
    the western Punjab, Pakistan, where he discovers         
    fascinating traces of a city where Greek west and         
    Buddhist east were united in an intriguing new way.
