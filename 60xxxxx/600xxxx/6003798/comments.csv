No offence to uploader, its better then nothing, so thanks!"
[T],despo1ler,2010-12-02T21:01Z,"none taken :) but do pls try and remember that these episodes are recorded from broadcast SDTV while youtube clips are probably web downloads in HD, I'm sure once the show is released on iTunes someone will buy the 720p version and upload it for sharing, until then all I can do is forward the C_P releases as the become available."
,chitchatid,2010-12-10T08:12Z,"i first watched the 1985 series in 2006. i had bought its dvd collection recently. imdb said that it had 4 seasons. the first season was inaccessible (wrong copy). i am planning to rip it and seed it.
imdb said that there was the movie 1986, armada (series), cybertron (series), the movie 2007, the fallen 2009. the cybertron has its torrent.
some years back, there was voltus v (voltes v) series.
my question is:  do you have any idea about this 70's show? tq anyway"
