,Amlamlaml,2010-12-04T00:54Z,Help urgently !!!!! Where can I download Startup.dll
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-12-04T01:07Z,Huh? ^o)
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-05T23:45Z,"I got the same thing. Followed instructions as given and when I go to launch the app, error comes up:

""LoadLibraryEX Startup.dll failed with error 193"""
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-05T23:48Z,"Also noticed the instructions are little different than the header on this downlaod page.
If you look below, it says
INCLUDED:
| * Setup (Adobe Premiere Pro)
-Instructions-.txt with torrent says
INCLUDED:                                                     
| * Setup (Adobe After Effects)
don't know if that make for anything, or if maybe a wayward copy/paste is giving the startup.dll error."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-12-06T01:29Z,You got 64-bit right?
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-06T15:33Z,"Yes, I have 64. Everything else that comes with Premier open np. I uninstalled and reinstalled following instructions (just in case i do something noobish), same thing. Only Premier gives ""LoadLibraryEX Startup.dll failed with error 193"" "
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-06T17:58Z,"Don't know if this has something to do with it also, but both times the installer open, it says it has detected a pending reboot. (I clicked 'ignore'.)"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-12-06T21:17Z,"You might wanna restart your PC then, but try googeling the error :)"
,Beach_Ape,2010-12-08T01:04Z,"BOOT CAMP !!!
Your response almost made me cry. I had alreay been through that. BUT!!! You did clue me - Reboot! (even though I thought I did this) Mystory:
I did not want the CS5 Master Suite (My God - summon the Gods to pull my weed). YOU had just the Apps I wanted individual. I downloaded 4. That's what screwed me. Here's what I did:  I boot after each blocker, then again after each launch to check. Start with Premier first (4 good luck). Maybe too many boots but this shitkicking has me fine.

@Amlamlaml
there will be no Startup.dll file - Follow instructions precisely (Cyberpiraten is best - no brainer installs), just reboot - OFFLINE."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2010-12-08T09:02Z,"Alright, I'll upload a new torrent, this time is should work for ya ;) "
,Pylio,2010-12-09T04:26Z,"So, did we figure out the solution to the ""LoadLibraryEX Startup.dll failed with error 193"" because I get the same thing. Tried rebooting after running the Activation Blocker, it removed the message that said ""detected a pending reboot"" but still gives me the ""LodLibraryEX Startup.dll"" even staying 'offline' througout the process. Did you say you need to upload a new torrent to fix it CyberPiraten? If so, when do you expect to have that available, because I look forward to this piece of software greatly :) 
Thanks for your selfless hard work."

WHen launching the program it tells me that the amtlib.dll is missing. Again, I followed the directions exactly as they are written in the instructions.txt file. I copied the hack dll and placed it in the top root of the premiere folder. And when I did so, i chose the option to replace. Does this dll need to be somewhere else to ? Note, google just gave me a million other bullchit websites to download the same dll. ANy help would be appreciated. There are so many variations all over the place I would love it if someone actually downloaded this torrent and found a working solution to fix it."
,ryaaaan,2010-12-24T08:10Z,"hey Cyberpiraten. great torrent! works fine, except for one thing. it seems that other sequence presets aren't present when the program starts up. i can see all of them if i go to C:/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Premiere Pro CS5/Settings/SequencePresets, but when i try to start a new project, i only have options for DV (24P, NTSC, PAL), DVCPRO50, DVCPROHD, and Mobile & Devices. anyone else having this problem? i have a Canon DSLR, so i'm trying to get into the Digital DSLR presets. any advice?"

,Testudocc,2010-12-26T21:51Z,"""4l3x21"" got it right, although in a bit unclear way.
So here's the instructions in plain english for us who require that...

(0. Install Premiere as per torrent instructions. Upon launch you get the error 193.)

1. Download the torrent
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6021456/ADOBE_CLEAN_INSTALL__amp__ERROR_TOOLKIT_v4_[thethingy]
2. Run the ""installer"" - i.e. extractor. You end up with a bunch of folders.
3. Got to subfolder '\Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit V4\ADOBE CS5 APPS\CS5 LICENCE RECOVERY\DLL FILE\64bit'
4. Copy the 'amtlib.dll' file to 'C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro CS5' or where ever you have Premiere installed.

Deed done.

Note that the dll file from this torrent's ""crack"" folder is some 800 kb, whereas the *working* one you just copied is 1,243,576 bytes.

Worked for me - should work for you too!  8)"
,Larslayer,2010-12-29T00:21Z,"Hi! thanks for this torrent! But I'm having a problem with opening the program.

,Kalderash,2011-03-27T08:07Z,"So I had this wonderful program before and installed it and it worked no problems. I had to wipe my computer due to my system registry getting all screwed up. Not because of Premiere. Another reason. Long story short I reinstalled this the same way. Used the blocker and input the serials.

 It all installed fine. Only problem is now when I start it up if my internet is connected it says invalid serial code. Enter a valid one. I have used all of them. Easiest way to avoid this is to just click remind me later and unplug the internet. I'm sure at one point it won't allow me to do that and will just block the program from use until I enter a valid code though.

 Last time this was installed this never happened. It is a bit of annoyance because I don't like having to be disconnected from the internet to use this program. 

Anyone know a way to resolve this dilemma? Thanks."

First make sure your Folder Options is set to show hiden files and system files or you will not see SLStore folder

-Make sure your Internet Connection off
-dont replace crack ( amtlib.dll) in Adobe Encore CS5.1 (usually found in C Programe Files Adobe.)
-Delete all files in SLStore dir and all files in SLCache dir both to reset serial. 

SLStore & SLCache Windows 7:
CProgramDataAdobeSLStore
C (x86)Common FilesAdobeSLCache

- Start Adobe Encore from usually found in C Programe Files Adobe ( depens on your Installition dict)

- Enter serial key

- After entering a vaild key and, as soon as your Encore is working, Replace your crack (amtlib.dll either 32 or 64 bit) into Adobe Encore CS5.1 installition Dict

,IdButtonmasher,2012-06-18T09:22Z,"Hey this Torrent Is awesome and it works 100% And i made an account just to tell people how to fix the problem when they get ""LoadLibraryEx Startup.dll failed with error 193:"" cause i figured it out haha

If you followed Stealthsamurais advice and use the  ""Adobe Clean Install & Error Toolkit V4"" but still getting the error like i was. I found out a solution by simply fucking around and playing the ""what if"" card. basically the reason why it works for some people and it doesn't work for others because you need a crack based on your system. whether you're using 64-bit or 34- bit. Me using 64 bit. I copied and pasted the crack from CS6 64 bit and pasted it in CS5 main directory and Voila. It works. so if you're using 34 bit. Try that and see if it works as well. 

So i don't think you guys need to download the Toolkit, just follow the installation instructions here and when it comes time to replace the crack. Replace it with the system you're using. Hope it helps. Good day
