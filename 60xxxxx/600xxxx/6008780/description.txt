On the final track of 2007â€™s Pictures, a cover of Leonard Cohenâ€™s In My Secret Life, Katie Melua sang of missing a loved one. Three years on, she opens this fourth album with Iâ€™d Love to Kill You: â€œIâ€™d love to kill you as you eat / The pleasure would taste so sweetâ€. Sheâ€™s said that The House may shock fans whoâ€™ve followed her since her 2003 breakthrough, and such lyrical wickedness might imply sheâ€™s been through quite the stylistic sea change.

As if. The House is as box-ticking of design as even the most fair-weather of fans should expect from an artist whoâ€™s never pushed at any creative envelope. At their worst these arrangements are lazy to the point of absolute stupor, as lively as a well-fed fatso snoozing in front of the Queenâ€™s Christmas speech. This should allow Meluaâ€™s voice to shine through, but she can sound racked by tracheal rigor mortis, a whisper escaping where a little more of the wow factor that first attracted the ears of Dramatico boss Mike Batt would have improved proceedings.

Batt, for the first time on a Melua album, makes no appearance (save for a single co-write) â€“ in his place William Orbit produces, and former Robbie Williams collaborator Guy Chambers contributes to several songs. This new line-up hasnâ€™t led to a considerable shift of dynamic, many songs contentedly shuffling at a mid-tempo pace. This is meant as no slight: Melua is the kind of artist who responds to demand, rather than one who writes to challenge her audience. As such The House is largely a success â€“ those boxes, ticked. But itâ€™s disappointing that sheâ€™s not edged that little further from her comfort zone given the promise of surprises.

Highlights are apparent, though. The Flood, the albumâ€™s lead single, is a polished arrangement that reins in the temptation for bombast and is better for its restraint. Red Balloons, a co-write with Polly Scattergood, is so delicate the listener might want to hold their breath for its duration, for fear that exhaling would shatter its frail form. And when Meluaâ€™s vocals convey real intimacy and vulnerability, such as on the closing title-track, she engages the listener with a rarefied grace.

When Melua reveals this sensitive side sheâ€™s amongst the best artists in her easy-on-the-ear field, and she could yet surpass several of her own idols. But The House contains enough forgettable filler to suggest sheâ€™s some way off delivering a career-defining canon classic.
