,crunkwitdadrank,2010-12-02T17:46Z,Love your work HD great quality. I was wondering what software you use? so i can compress some of my movies that you dont have up on here. Like if you use a special program or converter?
,afkuser,2010-12-09T13:36Z,"Why make this so complicated?  Re-encode it, provide the mkv file, then people can play it."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-09T19:00Z,"How is it complicated? - people can play it directly from the iso, or mounted on a virtual drive, but they can't burn an MKV to play, can they?"
,rjaime,2010-12-11T11:53Z,"no use downloading this if you want to watch it or stream it from your pc to lcd. you can not even mount it with daemon tools to watch it directly from the image or to copy the bdmv file..
Better dowload the mkv files!"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-11T13:50Z,"Why can't you mount it on a Daemon Tools virtual drive? Everyone else can.. and Alcohol's virtual drive... and PowerDVD's virtual drive. By the way, BDMV is a folder, not a file, and why would you want to copy it? I think you're a little confused."
,Sgt-Sandstorm,2010-12-12T18:35Z,"Okay, for everyone using Daemon tools, just do this!

1. Mount the Image
2. Right click on the trey icon and choose Mount'n'Drive Manger
3. Right click on the icon Device 0: Knight.and.day and choose ""File Explorer""
4.  Navigate to BDMV -> STEAM
5. Drag and drop the file ""00000"" to your desktop
6. Play the film you just extracted.

HD-R-US, I'd advice you to add this to future releases, as I find your way of doing it extremely annoying/impractical

Anyways, Awesome quality!"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-13T01:48Z,"@Sgt-Sandstorm - Perhaps that is because you too are making it difficult for yourself?

You don't even need to extract it - you just mount the image file, browse to the BDMV/STREAM folder, and play the 0000.m2ts video file from there - Childsplay."
,Sgt-Sandstorm,2010-12-13T09:27Z,"No, I could not, every time i tried mounting it, it automatically opened it up in ImgBurn.

so there really was no other way for me, sure I could have played it once I found it by using my method, but why go through all that every single time?... 

Of cause it could just be me or my pc that's set up wrong, but that was the only way for me to explorer the files on the iso.

(and for the record, I'm not dumb with a machine, and I've never had problems like this before with any other *.iso)

Anyways, still exceptionally good quality, thanks for the upload :)"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-14T06:50Z,"You're welcome for the movie - glad you enjoyed it, and thanks for your feedback.

I think it's obvious that you aren't dumb, and yes, probably your machine is set up to open image files with an image burning application if clicked on or even automatically, but once the image is mounted on a virtual drive with Daemon Tools, if you browse to the 00000.m2ts file on that drive, by using ""open file"" with any hi-def capable media player, or by using windows explorer, right clicking the file, and left clicking ""open with"" (your media player), there shouldn't be a problem, or any need to extract the image.

,Johnny575,2010-12-14T23:29Z,"I can play this one on PS3 if I run the AVCHD in multiAVCHD and enable filesplitting at 4GB and disable menus.

I have been playing around with multiAVCHD recently, and it's pretty awesome. No more mkv2vob. I can now just run MKVs in multiAVCHD and copy the AVCHD-folder to the root of an USB stick or HDD, and it gets recognized as a Blu-ray."
,Screamokid,2010-12-15T06:05Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5926846

That's what I was looking for, it's not about file size or whether it can fit onto a DVD, it's about being 1080p with the BD quality. Sure enough it'll take longer to download, but it will be worth it."
,Screamokid,2010-12-15T06:20Z,"Btw, your aspect ratio is wrong.

Yours (16:9): 1920 * 1080
DVD/Blu-ray: 2.4:1 - 1920 * 800
Original: 2.39:1 - 1920 * 803."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-15T11:18Z,@Screamokid - it has become obvious from your comments on numerous of our releases that you have no clue what you are talking about. I would stop before you make yourself look even more of a fool than you already have.
,defendingthecross,2010-12-20T18:37Z,"U people are wankers! the file can be found in mount_drive:\BDMV\STREAM
.. its an m2ts file can be played in mpc, vlc etch
 I played with my bd player without any pain in the ass!

Cheers to uploader.. HD-R-US you rock!"
,defendingthecross,2010-12-20T18:40Z,"@Screamokid   from which planet you get this information. Full HD is 1920 1080. this is real one.. 
HD-R-US your are my saviour"
,sexycarol,2010-12-21T23:47Z,"hey guys, i was wondering why can't i play this movie on my computer! i've tried so many times, i even registered for that Roxio thing, and it doesn't work, and im getting kinda frustrated
please, anyone know how i can get this video to play?
oh, and when i play the video on miro, i get another movie playing where i left off."
,grinnellja,2010-12-23T01:18Z,So I can't just download this and upload via flash drive to a PS3? Coz that's what I do with all my torrents
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-23T06:06Z,"@sexycarol - As detailed in the torrent's release notes, and with the files that you downloaded, you will need to mount the image file on a virtual drive, or extract it.

@grinnellja - A PS3's USB port will only recognise FAT32 formatted drives, and FAT32 has a maximum filesize limitation of 4Gb, so your only option with files that are larger than that is to transfer/stream them from a media server."
,boomerz,2010-12-24T13:13Z,just downloaded the movie!! awesome quality!! thanks HD-R-US!! you rock! merry Christmas!
,wedvn,2010-12-24T20:38Z,"If you cannot mount (like me/unknown reason). Then extract it using Winrar.

Play the file 00000.m2ts"
,wedvn,2010-12-24T20:42Z,"btw: very good quality. Thanks, HD-R-US"
,11011,2010-12-29T07:50Z,"hey so i get the whole providing the movies in this format because it is useful to the most amount of people, but I dont know about the rest of the ppl but when i try to play the 00000.mt2s thing in VLC player there is no indexing of the frames of the total runtime of the movie...i was wondering how I could go about converting the provided file to a .mkv for myself using the included index.bdmv file that is on the .iso...any help would be appreciated!

Thx
-11011"
,11011,2010-12-29T07:53Z,"EDIT 

okay so it turns out that it is indexing the frames because i can seek, however i have no time frame reference. so if i ever wanted to stop the movie and close the player, I have no way to get right back to the time where i stopped the movie...hope that additional information helps.

-11011"
,Sparkess,2010-12-29T23:36Z,"Well, other than the fact that I had to mount it, then manually open it in MPC. The audio loses sync with the video in multiple parts in the movie and the frame rate seems to bomb in other parts, also causing audio to unsync. The video quality is no where near 1080p. It's about the same quality as Youtube High Quality setting. For it being a 4.36gb file, this is one shitty download. I downloaded a 750mb version off the site and the video and audio never lose sync and it's higher quality. "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-04T12:42Z,"
11011 - The .m2ts video file itself is the same format as any other blu-ray/AVC/AVCHD file that you will find. You don't need to convert anything - like ISO, MKV is just a container, so you can just re-wrap the file/s with MKVtoolnix if you so wish, but there is nothing to gain in doing so.

Sparkess - For you to see a 750Mb movie as being higher quality than a hi-definition movie your monitor must be as low quality as the rest of your hardware which is also causing your audio/sync issues. The audio and video are both ONE track, so how can they only be out of sync at certain times? duh... upgrade your hardware, or only download movies that are compatible with the crap that you are playing them on."
,pirater19,2011-01-12T17:31Z,"I have to admit, I was kind of iffy about the format at first. However, after I downloaded it, I was able to mount it with no extra software needed on my Mac, and then played the .m2ts file in Mplayer OSX Extended (which I already had) with no problems at all. The quality was also superb. Thanks for this!
One thing to note though, is that as stated before by 11011, my player did not tell me what part of the movie I was on, it simply said how much time had passed, and then the scrubber area had little diagonal lines running through it, which meant I could not skip around to other parts of the movie (I could seek with the arrow buttons, though, at least backwards). I attempted to rewrap the raw .m2ts into an .mkv just now out of curiosity, but that ended badly, resulting in a file that opened but did not display the images except in blocky forms.
However, it does work for what it does."
,sky_24,2011-01-28T22:16Z,i've been trying to burn it on to dvd like the way you said but keep on getting an error msg? should i say no to the audio thing that comes up befor it trys burning the files??
,sky_24,2011-01-28T22:59Z,i've burntit on dvd disc trie it on computr and nothing plays it! any help.......
,sky_24,2011-01-28T23:10Z,"ok i've burnt it on dvd disc exactly the way it says in the info box... but when i tried playing the disc on my computer nothing plays it.. tried VLC, WMP, KMPlayer, Power DVD.... ANY HELP Would be appreciated tnx"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-29T08:29Z,"sky_24 - You were playing another one of our movies with VLC Media Player yesterday, because you posted a subtitle question on that page stating so - This is precisely the same deal, and as all of our releases are burn tested several times before being uploaded, if you are getting errors, you have changed something since yesterday, or it's bad media. By the way, as stated in the release notes, you didn't need to burn a disc to play the movie on your computer."
,sky_24,2011-01-29T11:32Z,"i have no problem playing the mt2s file on my computer.. its just that when i burn it on dvd, no dvd player plays it tried it on x box still no result..

great quality uploads btw :)"
,insoc_cr,2011-01-31T16:32Z,"Thank you for yet another great conversion. The audio and video quality it's excelent, just shy from a Blu Ray image and way, way better than a DVD."
,insoc_cr,2011-01-31T16:34Z,"By the way, I love the format you are using. Not only am I able to watch the movie on my PC using powerdvd but also on my regular home theater via my blu ray player. Thanks again."
,demister,2011-02-02T15:34Z,"I'm a newbie to this and it's the best copy I have seen yet.Easy to burn with imageburn (as stated) and wrote onto a DVD+RW 4.7GB,Played back through my PS3 and I would say I can't tell the difference between this and a blu ray copy.Keep up the good work.5* "
,luka3rd,2011-03-20T23:48Z,"Hi! Great, great upload!
First time I downloaded HD movie and watched it on my BD player! I really enjoyed!
I love to have remote and all those commands I used to when watching DVD's and BD's...
Thanks! Keep up the good work!

P.S. To downloaders:
Follow the info on ""how to use it"" and no problem!"
,elric92,2011-06-13T22:50Z,"Downloading now. Expect that I might have to fiddle a bit. I want to watch the movie through Windows Media Center, since I have a remote control for it. Will come back and comment after I have downloaded and determine whether it is an easy thing to do or what steps I needed to take to get it to work easily in WMC."
