Everyone who cares about popular music knows and loves the classic songs of Gerry Goffin and Carole King. Between 1959 and 1967 the couple wrote some of the most enduring hits of all time, including 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow',  
'Take Good Care Of My Baby', 'Goin' Back', 'The Loco-Motion' and 'It Might As Well Rain Until September'. Those songs have been anthologised hundreds of
times - maybe thousands. Now it's time to shine the spotlight on other great G & K songs that haven't always received the attention they deserve. 
This collection blends hits and hard-to-find classics, focusing primarily on the latter but also including the original versions of songs that will have many listeners thinking, "I didn't realise they wrote that!" 

Many of these tracks are completely new to CD, and several have never been reissued in any format in 40 years.
