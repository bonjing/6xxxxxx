Allaboutjazz introduces the album with the following sentence "Ulrich Drechsler
asks and answers the question: how can the saddest music in the world be
delivered with so much hope?" and I think that couldn't be more accurate. This
is mainstream jazz with an open mind, and Drechsler makes something unique out
of his debut album. His bass clarinet indeed touches upon the extremes of human
emotions, between sadness and hope, between melancholia and joy. Again, I will
take Myriam Alter's album "If" as a reference : a chamber-like atmosphere, a
lightness of touch, carefully crafted compositions, excellent interplay,
beautiful melodies, a sense of fragility throughout, and a sadness, sadness,
sadness, .... just listen to "For Andy", or "Graceful Touch", "OSK", it will
make you break to pieces when listening to it. This is jazz with an interesting
mix of European urban folk or street music with an American blues feeling, very
much in the vain of Gianluigi Trovesi or Tomasz Stanko. The band members are
truly excellent, with Tord Gustavsen on piano, Oliver Steger on bass, JÃ¶rg
Mikula on drums and Peter Ponger on piano on two tracks. Great music.
