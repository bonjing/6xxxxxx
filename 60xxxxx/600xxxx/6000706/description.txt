portrayal of the legendary king of the wild frontier. There's never been a folk hero quite like Davy Crockett, and you'll see why when you watch him 'grin' down a bear, battle an Indian chief in a tomahawk duel, and fight for freedom at the Alamo. Disney's popular action-adventure inspired millions of children to sport coonskin caps and sing 'The Ballad Of Davy Crockett', which topped the nation's hit list for 13 weeks! As Walt Disney himself proclaimed, the story of Davy Crockett, with its entertaining blend of drama, humor, and adventure, will always be a colourful reflection of the frontier spirit.
