,dan_bb,2011-01-06T00:39Z,"hello all :) just to let you all know this torrent works perfectly :) if you dont update. its very awkward to update and crack it.  i only tried once and fucked my install up, so i did a clean install.  
i saw previous comments mentioning about playing via lan.  iv used hamachi with 2 friends to play against them in a 3 way deathmatch.  no trouble at all with hamachi so im going to assume that it works via normall lan, as well as vlan.  
iv been seeding for the past 8 hours at 400kb/s and will continue to seed untill i reach a ratio of 20, or the 10 of janurary 2011. whichever comes first :P
happy hunting guys :P"

Those of you that say it's not an easy install should really learn computer basics; after you extract it you have to double-click on setup.bat and then press ANY KEY. That's it, no cd keys, no clicking, no placing cracks, nothing. Seriously, a preschooler could figure that out.
