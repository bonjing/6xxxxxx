,TechnicsJunkie,2010-12-03T03:56Z,"Time zones are different across the world though eh?

and ez is a VIP member and I've been downloading his tv torrents for like 2 years solid almost with no problems"
,AlfredYLeVolcmp,2010-12-03T04:23Z,"My bad.  I just checked the last episode and it was also created at 8:20 PM.  As far as timezones go, there aren't any places airing the episode earlier than 8:00 EST."
,ashlee87,2010-12-03T05:56Z,There is nothing suspicious about eztv. His video's are ALWAYS legit.
,greyhouse,2010-12-03T06:23Z,I second the comment above mine. eztv rocks!
,chief_petty,2010-12-03T12:12Z,"Just my 2 cents. I have never had a problem with a *legitimate* eztv upload 

Always check for the VIP status {green skull'n'crossbones}

beware of anyone who claims to be eztv but doesnt have the VIP status"
