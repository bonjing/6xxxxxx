ALL Soundbanks that Tixi-j package  and ""Reason Refill Pack [14.4Gigs]""(that i got error trying to unzip) contain is all included here. And everything is NORAR/ZIP!! thank you for sharing :)"

,jolie1887,2011-09-21T14:01Z,"All the sub folders are empty whenever I try to access one of the soundbank files from Reason. 

Am I doing something wrong? I'm not going to bother re-DLing it because it already took forever the first time.

,coledude,2011-10-04T20:36Z,Jolle- That's probably because the patches aren't for whatever synth/sampler you're attempting to open them with. For example if you try to open a folder full of samples with a Thor it's not going to show you any because Thor can't open samples. But if you use an NNXT or something you'll be able to open them.

,rael408,2012-01-03T01:24Z,so the faulty soundbanks from tixi-j were deleted or replaced?
,jolie1887,2012-01-08T14:21Z,"Ah, ok."
,1337chaos,2012-01-29T04:24Z,"Anybody else having the problem where Reason 5 can't find the sound files within the refills? I have to do a manual folder search, and then it finds them no problem, but I have to do that for every single instrument in almost all of the packs. Any idea how to fix that?"
,Etarip_o0,2012-02-21T16:10Z,"@1337chaos

Have you set your soundbanks folder as ""favorites"" in your reason filemanager (where you open songs and sounds)? i have no problems with any of the soundbanks and my reason 5 find them with no problem.

Im thinking of making a new set of packages with reason soundbanks that is alot smaller to hopefully solve the leeching problem. Plus i have a few more soundbanks now and continuing looking for more ""full"" banks that have genuine sounds as there is so so many crap banks out here that more or less sound like any other bank. its in progress. thanks:)"
,1337chaos,2012-03-05T20:18Z,"@Etarip_o0

I have just tried setting them as favorites. Still says ""Some sounds for this patch are missing. Opening it will let you locate them."" At the bottom on 90% of the patches. After opening, it asks me to locate the files. I choose the folder where I opened the patch, and it finds the files instantly. But I have to do that every single time I open it."
,Etarip_o0,2012-03-09T23:21Z,"@1337chaos

sounds wierd but i think it could be that once you started making a track, it saved your locations of the sounds and later on you moved soundbanks around maybe to another location or renamed some folder. so what you have to do is reload all the sounds in a track and save it to save the new locations of your sounds and wont have to do that locate sounds every time you load that track. ofcouse you will have to do that with every track you have problem loading sounds in to.

hope that solves your mystery :)"
,Etarip_o0,2012-03-09T23:35Z,"explained in a easier way:

1- Load track/song -->
a- if sound locator pops up just do

2- skip locate sounds and reload them manually
inside the track build and save your song.

3 reload song to check, if locator still pops up
try reload different sounds, save. reload bla bla
and go back to first used sounds and save.

4- if still not work, check favorites and maybe consider reinstalling reason.

5- save sounds in your song (under file). the tracks takes more space but you should not get the same problems as all sounds used in track will be stored localy in the build. can be very handy if not using to many wav and sample files :)

play safe out there :)"
