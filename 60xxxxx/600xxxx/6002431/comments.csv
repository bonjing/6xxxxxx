,kgaurav76,2010-12-02T06:35Z,I think macrium reflect is best free alternative of acronis True Image.
,ekarth22,2010-12-03T04:44Z,"If you've Acer Aspire series of laptops, don't use Acronis, the boot image doesn't work properly, instead use BESR from norton or Ghost 15"
,omc1977,2010-12-06T23:50Z,I say fuck W7 I use it but I don't trust it.
[T],TrettioSju,2010-12-30T16:36Z,"I have used Ghost many year, and after a few hours look at this, I will be happy to change.
Didn't find any bugs, and it works like a dream.
Well, I have not checked up everything, but make a backup on-the-fly and restore from CD works perfekt. Looks like it is to trust."

Windows XP is a piece of shit, you obviously don't know a damn thing about computers and probably have an old piece of crap.  Windows 7 is a huge improvement if you're on a good PC."

,some-young-guy,2011-02-19T15:34Z,"Imagine this, you wipe your drive with DBAN and there is nothing at all that remains. On your external HDD, you have an Acronis TIB file that has imaged your complete machine. Do you have to reinstall your OS, then your drivers, then Acronis just to be able to migrate your backup, or is there a method one can use to imprint the backup image onto the wiped HDD?

I successfully converted the TIB to ISO with IMGburn, downloaded WinRAR but cannot locate the process to convert the ISO to an EXE, or a program I'd need to split the 60GB TIB/ISO file up to burn those frags discs,

Does anyone have a work around? Acronis sure set the stage for users to greatly depend on their product for all aspects of cloning. "
,some-young-guy,2011-02-19T15:43Z,"BTW, I can't attest for the stability of each because, well let's face it, it's Windows, but I just upgraded from Vista SP@ to Win7 Ultimate.  I find XP extremely difficult to quickly navigate, and VIsta and 7 allow you to easily bounce around from any explorer folder by expanding the file trees on the left pane.  Plus also to really hone in on the tweaks of Vista/7, there is Yamicsoft Vista or 7 manager.  I've yet to locate an XP manager.

Im sold on Vista, but am so new to 7 that I can't yet comment, but so far I'm impressed."
,Bob__Dole,2011-02-21T07:03Z,"Win7 is for noobs that never learned how to use a computer well with XP.  Once you learned XP, you had found the quick ways to do things, had nailed down security holes, and had no reason to switch OS except if you were stuck with equipment from an OEM that had it preinstalled and you were too lazy to switch.

That doesn't mean there is anything wrong with Win7, no it will be fine once it has a couple of service packs the same as was the case with XP.

Bottom line - use whatever you want but ever since Win2k got us all away from Win9x, if you have a big problem using a version of windows that has been around for a decade, you are an idiot."
,justmealwatts,2011-09-06T04:34Z,"Thank You!!!  Installed and registered on 2 personal computers and works perfect. Running XP SP3. Boot CD, clone HD, backup and restore have worked for me. I will rate this torrent an A+++++"
