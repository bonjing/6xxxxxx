,TheChosen1_,2010-12-03T22:59Z,"Alright, thanks for this 720p release.But is 1080p release of CHD avaliable or is it going to come out in these days? -jonny- u r the best by the way..."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-03T23:32Z,You're welcome. I do only 720p.
,abhikrit,2010-12-04T04:01Z,"@ jonny.... you made my day... i have been searching for a decent 720p of matrix bluray... & finally here it is.. i wish the video bitrate was a bit higher...

& would you upload BOURNE TRILOGY in Bluray? HD DVD you uploaded is nice but i will prefer bluray.. thanks for all the awesome blurays... love them.."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-04T11:10Z,"HDDVD is the same as BLURAY, so get my existing HDDVD torrent. And the video bitrate on this is great. Enjoy."
,abhikrit,2010-12-04T12:00Z,"okie then.. will get it...

& thanks again for this...!!

& by the way, will you upload THE TOWN (EXTENDED)? "
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-04T12:36Z,"The Town has already been uploaded. A quick search wouldn't hurt.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6010289/The.Town.2010.EXTENDED.720p.BluRay.x264-CBGB"
,abhikrit,2010-12-04T13:06Z,yeah i know...i meant a release from a different group...anyways..dont bother...!! 
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-04T16:17Z,Why would you want a release from a different group...
,abhikrit,2010-12-04T17:01Z,coz i like having bitrate above 5000kbps...& it has lesser.... but can you tell me whether it matters much? does the video looks the same below 5000...??
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-04T19:57Z,You shouldn't be questioning anything above 4000kbps
,bmxv,2010-12-04T21:58Z,Damn it! Please don't just download the first movie. And for the love of -jonny- please seed!
,duvel5ever,2010-12-05T12:24Z,"It seems that a lot of peers (like myself) are stuck with their download at 93.2%. The last bits are coming through very slowly cause there are only few seeds.
So, please, when your download finishes, keep on seeding some time so that these 'last bits' also become more widespread."
,the forsaken,2010-12-08T11:59Z,Please Seed where all stuck at 98.8 %
,the forsaken,2010-12-08T12:01Z,Please Seed where all stuck at 98.8 %

,the forsaken,2010-12-08T12:32Z,Please Seed where stuck at 98.8 % Thnx
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-08T14:55Z,The problem is people cut-n-running. A number of people have completed the download.
,mantrain,2010-12-08T22:26Z,"Sounds familiar! People just don't understand the concept of uploading as well to keep a torrent healthy. There are 16 trackers all reporting 1 seed and around 1,000 leechers. Damned if I can get a connection to that one seed for the last pieces so I can throw 500kb/s back into the torrent for a few weeks. Ah well, it'll finally complete I suppose."
,reine12,2010-12-16T13:17Z,"Just one question: Wy 720p and not 1080p? Doesn't more or less everyone have high-res screens these days (1920x1080)? I'm watching all my movies on a 100"" screen with a full-hd projector, so it does make a difference. "
,reine12,2010-12-16T13:19Z,...and no I'm not ungrateful it's just a question!
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-16T17:52Z,Want 1080p? Buy the disc.
,mizhop,2010-12-17T21:50Z,"Outstanding quality!  Thank you johnny, and all the seeders!  Yes, it took awhile to DL, even with great bandwidth, but it was worth it.  Will and always seed to 1:1."
,markus0369,2010-12-20T05:26Z,http://deliciouscake.wazdat.com/img/thematrix1999_smith_humansarevirus.jpg
,reine12,2010-12-20T12:59Z,"I would have hoped for a more serious answer jonny...of cource I can buy the discs, but I just want to know why you convert them into 720p."
[V],meech,2010-12-22T16:50Z,"Personally, I prefer 720p torrents.  The reason being is that I stream these files from my computer to ps3 to t.v.  1080p is just too bitrate intensive to stream smoothly (even more so when audio is DTS)...even with a i7 p.c./wired network.  So I appreciate and only download the 720p releases.  And besides, I can only see a minor video quality difference between 720 and 1080.  Yes, there is a difference, but to me it is not worth the extra hard drive space nor network bandwidth when streaming.  I couldn't say for sure, but I think these might be some of the reasons that 720p is so popular in the torrent scene.  720p is after all, still High Def."
,toastie01,2010-12-23T23:35Z,"C'mon people, seed please. EEEEE-hey!!!!"
,iycgtptyarvg,2010-12-28T22:38Z,Thank you Jonny... much appreciated.
,tankd0g,2011-01-04T05:04Z,"I'm seeding this thing but I could not get any of the movies to play, not with my hacked O!Play or with vlc and CCCP.  Not sure what's up."
,tankd0g,2011-01-04T05:08Z,"Nevermind, just forced a recheck and I have corrupt files."
,seedlove,2011-01-06T11:13Z,No subtitles. :'(
,seedlove,2011-01-06T11:15Z,This one haz subtitles: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5827462/The_Matrix_Trilogy_Complete_-_BRRip_-_m720p_-_x264_-_MKV_by_Ridd
[V],-jonny-,2011-01-08T11:12Z,"They are ENGLISH movies, but if you want subtitles, get them!! http://subscene.com/filmsearch.aspx?q=matrix
That other torrent is utter shite."
,Kniffy,2011-01-08T17:16Z,"Almost non-existent seeding speed

,coolzed,2011-02-07T21:41Z,"I will seed 2 Mb/s for a week now if I can finish it, but I'm seeding it at that speed for the moment. I wish I could upload faster but I have already capped 30 Mb/s up for ""The Town"". Sorry Guys, but at least I seed GOD DAMMIT! "
,vander92,2011-02-14T09:59Z,"Good lord! I feel like a high-roller with my sweet 10kbp/s! Either the rest of the world hasn't discovered cable/adsl(2) equiv. or I smell a festering 13 year old who's afraid of capping their plan and going without WoW for a week (:0) and has cleverly altered their upload speed to 'sweet fuck all'.

Wanted to say thanks, especially when I know how it feels when no one appreciates our 

uploads, as my torrent, has uploaded over 100GB, and no seeders left anyway, everyone left 

immediately after they finished, and no one even bothered to say Thank you .. (thinking of 

stop seeding it soon, if it will not change..)

Just because it is ""free""  you do not need to be rude and such a douches, especially to 

those of us who give up our free time and put effort in to give you these things for free!
So thank you!

Hope this can get more people to understand that just a little THANK YOU! can make a big

Will still download and seed regardless though. "
,pacocrowley,2011-08-08T04:29Z,"@VYCanisMajoris

The aspect ratio of the movie is 2:40:1, you can't fit that in 1920x1080 or 1080x720; that's why it's 1280x534."

,TheAre1973,2011-09-22T21:56Z,VYCanisMajoris - This is of 720p HD Class. The movie itself is more narrow then true 720p. At 532p this just means the format is not 16/9 and maybe a bit more narrow but what is important is that it is 1280 which is across and that determines the HD Class of whats known to be a 720p movie.
,IAMASITUATION,2011-09-28T07:37Z,i don`t know about other countries but in Canada we have to pay for the speed of our internet and the amount we use so it is a little hard to seed at a high rate or the bill skyrockets
