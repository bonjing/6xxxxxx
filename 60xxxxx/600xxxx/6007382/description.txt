0. ABOUT

redump.org is a disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to
collecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever
released on optical media of any system. The goal is to make blueprints of the
data on console and PC game discs. Redump.org also provides guides to ensure
the dumps are correctly done. Users of the website who follow the guides
correctly are encouraged to share their results to help build the database.
Multiple dumps of games with the same serial number by different people are
collected to ensure the same results are gathered, which help correct any
incorrect dumps in the database as well as to help recognize alternate
versions of the same game. 

They currently have more than 16500 (~5100 PSX) disc entries present in their
database.

By submitting information about missing discs to the redump.org database, you
would be helping to achieve this greater common goal. If you have original black
CDs not listed in the PSX database or even listed ones, please go that extra
mile and learn about their dumping methods.

Their guides on how to dump discs properly can be found here:

1. UNCOMPRESS

The discs have been packed using PakkISO which works just like torrentzip.
Simply put, PakkISO is the torrentzip of disc based games. It will create
exact archives of matching files. It runs the data tracks through ECM, and
then compresses with 7z. Audio tracks are compressed using the Monkey Audio
lossless format (APE). This results in a much higher compression ratio
compared to torrentzip.

You can choose from several programs to use for decompression. They all are
included in this torrent within 'important.zip'.

1.1. PakkISO shell integration *RECOMMENDED* (PakkISO-0.4-setup.exe).[1]

To unpack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'UnpakkISO'.

To unpack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's
folders to be processed, and select 'UnpakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be
automated.

1.2. PakkISO (PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip).[1]

To unpack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into unpakkIso.exe.

1.3. redumpExtractor (redumpExtractor_exe.zip or redumpExtractor.zip).[2]

Simple and intuitive GUI program. More information:

After successful decompression you should have one cue sheet file and one or
several binary files.

[1] Archives will be deleted after decompression; raw files after compression,
i.e. content is transformed from compressed to decompressed state or vice versa.
So it is preferable to make a copy of directory you want to work with and use
that copy instead of source.
[2] External programs needed for this application are available in
'PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip'.


2. PLAY

To play on real hardware (console), first you need to burn the image(s) to a
disc. Using your favorite disc recording software and good quality blank media:
load the '.cue' file and burn.[1] Make sure your console is capable of playing
backups.

The best way to play the games included in this collection on emulators is by
mounting them on a virtual drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol). Once you have the disc
mounted, just open the emulator and 'Open>CD-ROM via SPTI...' (Xebra) or 
'Insert CD drive' (pSX).

[1] Please do not use Alcohol for recording, it is known to have problems with
cue sheet parsing and therefore will produce incorrect copies (virtual drive
function works fine though). Prefered programs are: ImgBurn *RECOMMENDED*,
BlindWrite, CDRWIN.

3. AUDIT

Included with torrent within 'important.zip' are several '.dat' files to verify
downloaded files, update from previous torrent or audit your collection. Use
them with 'RomCenter', 'clrmamepro' or other similar ROM managers.
