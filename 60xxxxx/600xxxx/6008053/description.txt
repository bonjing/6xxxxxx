Even though eac3to fixed the gaps, the original audio wasn't in synch. I managed to find NTSC DVD and synch the audio from it.

Johnny is a lonely middle-aged man who gets a job in a restaurant owned by a greek family. There, he meets Frankie, a woman who doesn't seem very happy with her life, and he falls in love with her. The problem is that Frankie feels really lost in her monotony, so he can't convince her about his feelings... Written by Chris Makrozahopoulos
