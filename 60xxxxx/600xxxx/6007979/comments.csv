[V],webchella,2010-12-03T19:41Z,"This agree with you, but the problem is not sharing, the problem is much used esque in this life to take him down, and not share anything, so I prefer to give it to 100 that None of them greetings and thanks to you."

[T],NoggintheNomad,2010-12-04T11:08Z,For some reason I can't get the keygen to work. Any ideas?
,skryabym,2010-12-04T11:09Z,how can i use the keygen ?? somehow i could not open the keygen..
,bsedore,2010-12-05T01:29Z,Does someone have the code or a working keygen? I can't get it to open.
,pinkupallu,2010-12-08T21:53Z,"Don't bother download!
Keygen doesn't work"
,pinkupallu,2010-12-08T22:02Z,"You can get the Keygen from here:

,Mikeer,2011-01-03T01:00Z,"Yep, keygen downloads broken. Either follow the link posted before or go in to the package and chmod 777 everything"
,raki-chan,2011-01-17T11:35Z,"I have one key, If you need, you can use it!
1118-0497-5921-8734-9742-0242
Does Adobe want to block that key?
Use your Firewall to prevent it!"
,akicita,2011-01-17T21:47Z,"raki-chan, that worked flawlessly! Just be sure to use Little Snitch IN ADVANCE (that is, between installing the software and entering the serial) to block all connections from Acrobat Pro. Then adding the serial worked with no problem at all. "
,koalazoni,2011-02-11T21:42Z,Sweet ! Thx !!
,watchd00g,2011-02-23T11:20Z,"The key still works, but for just in case I blocked acrobat with little snitch .."
,bERTUZ_69,2011-03-08T16:59Z,It works! You only have to find a good serial and it's OK! :)
,PHGuedes,2011-03-11T11:00Z,KEYGEN DOESN'T WORK. WASTE OF TIME!
,losdelrock,2011-03-25T00:33Z,"Did you realise, from the terminal, you can cd into the package app, browse to ""Mac OSX"" within the app.

Then sudo CHMOD 755 the obvious file...

Voila.

Hey, after 4 months, I'm really getting into the Mac."
,Rainb0x,2011-03-31T00:16Z,"Just curious if anyone wants to give me a hand. What is a good solid Firewall out there for a Mac ? I know its off topic,but any help would be appreciated."
,elin482,2011-04-02T17:07Z,"Everything about downloading, installation and keygen worked just fine, 
BUT I cannot make this version convert conventional .doc, .docx or .pages or .xls -files to pdf? Only plain text and a whole lot of media formats?

Furthermore, I found no ""Multilingual""? Just English, but that's no problem! The lacking conversion capabilities is though.

Maybe it is my own fault, but reading the Acrobat Preferences about fileformats confirmed that Acrobat couldnĂÂ´t cope with MsOffice- or iWork-files?

Anyone who got the same result or know a workaround? Or perhaps another torrent?"
,dogant,2011-04-04T17:23Z,@elin482   You can convert .docx .doc and .xls files to pdf in office 2007 and 2010. It is built into the office suite.
,geejay2215,2011-04-07T04:56Z,SOMEONE PLEASE PUT ACTIVATION CODE HERE!!!

,glabor73,2011-08-23T11:09Z,"to raki-chan:
Thank you for the Serial. It works perfectly!"
,scabdizzy,2011-09-07T05:51Z,"Man, I can't even get to the registration page before the program crashes. Is this torrent still the original one you wrote or has someone written some jacked up code into it?"
,pacosf,2011-09-14T11:22Z,Thank you! Thank you!  Fast d'load and working great using raki-chan & akicita's advice! Bueno!

,diovivente,2011-10-09T14:02Z,"So I downloaded it and when I go to open it, I never get a prompt to put in the key. Instead it fully opens for about 10 seconds, then quits and a program called Adobe Application Manager starts to open, then crashes. Anybody know what's up?"
,telvet,2011-10-12T01:12Z,"Has anyone tried this with the official updates? -Does the program work after updating to 10.1.1?
Thanks"
,lkadar,2011-11-11T09:00Z,Excellent. Many THANKS!!!
,frdlr,2011-12-19T06:17Z,"Thank you very much for the torrent!. The keygen didn't actually work, so I downloaded the one from here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5963838/Adobe.Acrobat.X.Pro.v10.0.Multilingual.MacOSX.Incl.Keymaker-CORE and it installed perfectly."

,KitPistol,2012-02-09T03:48Z,I'm having the same problem as scabdizzy and diovivente. Is there a fix to this?
,seventhfirst,2012-02-26T00:18Z,this shit really worked and so did creative suite 5 just pay attention to detail.  Most people struggling are trying to hard to figure it out!  Thanks Alot Big Dog! 
,Justmetoo,2012-03-05T17:18Z,"This worked flawlessly. The download was super fast, the installation smooth and the key provided by raki-chan did the magic. Protected it using Firewall against Adobe.....end of story!

Thanks to all contributors. Long live TPB"
,pinkluxe,2012-03-23T03:13Z,Keygen doesn't work. It just bounces in the dock and eventually quits.
,kayton13,2012-06-06T02:44Z," Key  1118-0497-5921-8734-9742-0242

Stop auto updates. 

click on acrobat menu -> preferences -> select updater -> click on never download or install updates."
,brussell,2012-06-07T07:23Z,"works fine with the serial # given above. You can let lil snitch give the first request back to adobe, but DEFINITELY NOT the second. That one checks the serial #."
