Toy Story 3 is a 2010 American 3D computer-animated film. It is the third and currently final feature-length film in the Toy Story series.[4] The film was produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. Lee Unkrich, who edited the previous films, and co-directed the second, took over as director. In his place, Ken Schretzmann is the editor. Toy Story 3 was also the first of only two films to be released theatrically with 7.1 surround sound, the second being Step Up 3D.
The plot focuses on the adventures of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and other toys dealing with an uncertain future as their owner prepares to leave for college. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Joan Cusack, Don Rickles, Estelle Harris, John Ratzenberger, Wallace Shawn, Jeff Pidgeon, Jodi Benson, R. Lee Ermey, John Morris, and Laurie Metcalf all reprised their voice-over roles from the previous films. Jim Varney, who played Slinky Dog in the first two films, and Joe Ranft, who portrayed Wheezy and Lenny, both died before production began on the third film. The role of Slinky was taken over by Blake Clark, while Ranft's characters and various others were written out of the story (Wheezy, Etch, and Bo Peep, for example, are mentioned in the beginning as having been sold). New characters include voice-overs by Ned Beatty, Timothy Dalton, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeff Garlin, and Michael Keaton.
Toy Story 3 was released worldwide from June through October in Disney Digital 3-D, RealD and IMAX 3D. The feature broke Shrek the Third's record as the biggest opening day North American gross for an animated film unadjusted for inflation[5] and a big opening with an unadjusted gross of $110,307,189. It is also the highest-grossing opening weekend for a Pixar film,[6] as well as the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film to have opened in the month of June.[7]
The film is currently the highest-grossing film of 2010 in the United States and Canada, and the highest-grossing film of 2010 worldwide. In July, it surpassed Finding Nemo to become Pixar's highest ever grossing film at the North American box office. In early August, the film became Pixar's highest-grossing film worldwide and surpassed Shrek 2 as the highest-grossing animated film of all-time worldwide; in late August, Toy Story 3 became the first ever Pixar film and animated film in history to make over $1 billion worldwide. It is currently the 5th highest-grossing film worldwide of all time.[2][8][9]

[edit]Plot

Andy is packing for college and his toys, who have passed a long time not being played with, feel forgotten and abandoned. Andy decides to take Woody with him to college and intends to store the other toys in the attic. A misunderstanding with Andy's mom results in the other toys being thrown away, making them think they are no longer wanted; they escape and decide to climb in a box to be donated to the Sunnyside Daycare, along with Woody.
Andy's toys are welcomed by the numerous toys at Sunnyside, and given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (a.k.a. Lotso), Big Baby and Ken, the latter of whom Barbie falls for. All of the toys are quickly enamored with their new home, leaving steadfast Woody alone to attempt to return to Andy. However, Woody is picked up outside the school by the imaginative but shy little girl Bonnie. She takes him home and plays with him along with her other toys, who are well treated, happy, and readily welcome Woody. Woody is elated until he hears about Lotso from Chuckles. Lotso, along with Big Baby and Chuckles, were once accidentally lost by their original owner. The three found their way back to their owner's home, but Lotso saw that he had been replaced. Though Chuckles realized the truth, an embittered Lotso convinced Big Baby that they were abandoned, and used Big Baby's size to help him take control of the toys at Sunnyside in the fashion of organized crime. Worried for his friends, Woody hurries back to the daycare and finds that they have been put on task to be played with the rambunctious, toy-abusing youngest toddlers. They are also are kept under guard at night by Buzz whom Lotso has reverted to a demonstration state wiping his memories, restoring his original "Space Ranger" persona and allying with him.
Woody rejoins his friends and they work out an escape plan involving the garbage dumpster. In the process, Buzz is accidentally reset into a Spanish-speaking mode during an attempt to restore him to normal. The toys reach the dumpster, but are headed off by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody explains to Big Baby that Lotso has lied to him and that his owner still loved him, whereupon Big Baby, Ken and the other Sunnyside toys turn on Lotso and push him into the dumpster. However, Lotso manages to pull Woody in with him just as the garbage truck collects the dumpster. Woody's friends board the truck to rescue him, during which Buzz is hit by falling trash while saving Jessie, finally returning him to his old self. The toys find themselves at the local landfill and are soon pulled onto a conveyor belt leading to an incinerator. They help Lotso to reach an emergency stop button, but instead he escapes and leaves them to be burned. Believing they are at their final moments, the toys join hands, but they are rescued just in time by the squeeze toy aliens using a giant crane. The toys return to Andy's home, while Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver and is tied to its front grille as a decoration.
At Andy's house, Woody climbs back into the box with Andy's college supplies while the other toys resign themselves to the attic. Woody has a last minute inspiration, and leaves a note to Andy on the toys' box. Andy, mistaking it for a note from his mom, takes the box to Bonnie's home, and gives her the toys to play with. Bonnie recognizes Woody, laying at the bottom of the box, to Andy's surprise. Andy is initially reluctant to give him to her, but eventually does so, and then spends some time introducing her to his old toys and playing with her before he departs. Woody watches Andy's car while it disappears into the distance, and quietly says a last "So long, partner". Woody and the other toys find themselves wanted and played with again, and learn through notes passed in Bonnie's backpack that Barbie, Ken and Big Baby have turned around the life of all the toys at Sunnyside for the better.

[edit]Cast notes
Non-speaking characters include Bullseye, Totoro, Monkey, and Buster, Andy's pet dog
Several other characters (such as Bo Peep, Etch and Wheezy) appeared in flashbacks.
The character of Slinky appeared to be in limbo after the death of his original voice actor Jim Varney in 2000, shortly after Toy Story 2 came out. Stand-up comedian-turned-actor Blake Clark was chosen to replace Varney in the role. After Clark was cast to play Slinky Dog, the producers later discovered that Clark and Varney had coincidentally been close friends, making the transition a lot easier.[11]
[edit]Development

According to the terms of Pixar's revised deal with Disney, all characters created by Pixar for their films were owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retains the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retained the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. But in 2004, when the contentious negotiations between the two companies made a split appear likely, Disney Chairman at the time Michael Eisner put in motion plans to produce Toy Story 3 at a new Disney studio, Circle 7 Animation. Tim Allen, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, indicated a willingness to return even if Pixar was not on board.[12]


Promotional art for Circle 7's Toy Story 3, displaying the storyline of the Buzz Lightyears being recalled; this story was later shelved.
Jim Herzfeld wrote a script for Circle 7's version of the film. It focused on the other toys shipping a malfunctioning Buzz to Taiwan, where he was built, believing that he will be fixed there. While searching on the Internet, they find out that many more Buzz Lightyear toys are malfunctioning around the world and the company has issued a massive recall. Fearing Buzz's destruction, a group of Andy's toys (Woody, Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Jessie, and Bullseye) venture to rescue Buzz. At the same time Buzz meets other toys from around the world that were once loved but have now been recalled.[12]
In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter in charge of all Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its version of Toy Story 3 was shelved.[12] The character designs went into the Disney archives.[13] The following month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney was in the process of transferring the production to Pixar.[14] John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment.[15] On February 8, 2007, Catmull announced Toy Story 2's co-director, Lee Unkrich, as the sole director of the film instead of John Lasseter, and Michael Arndt as screenwriter.[16] The release date was moved to 2010.[17] Unkrich said that he felt pressure to avoid creating "the first dud" for Pixar, since as of 2010 all of Pixar's films had been commercial and critical successes.[18]
During the initial development stages of the film, Pixar revisited their work from the original Toy Story and found that although they could open the old computer files for the animated 3D models, error messages prevented them from editing the files. This necessitated recreating the models from scratch.[19] To create the chaotic and complex junkyard scene near the film's end, more than a year and a half was invested on research and development to create the simulation systems required for the sequence.[20]
Instead of sending Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger scripts for their consideration in reprising their roles, a complete story reel of the film was shown to the actors in a theater. The reel was made up of moving storyboards with pre-recorded voices, sound effects, and music. At the conclusion of the preview, the actors signed on to the film.[21]
Dolby Laboratories announced that Toy Story 3 would be the first film that will feature theatrical 7.1 surround audio.[22] Thus, even the Blu-ray version will feature original 7.1 audio, unlike other movies which were remixed into 7.1 for Blu-ray.
[edit]Marketing

The film's first teaser trailer was released with the Disney Digital 3-D version of the film Up on May 29, 2009.[23] On October 2, 2009 Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were re-released as a double feature in Disney Digital 3-D.[24] The first full-length trailer was attached as an exclusive sneak peek and a first footage to the Toy Story double feature, on October 12, 2009. A second teaser was released on February 10, 2010, followed by a second full-length trailer on February 11 and appeared in 3D showings of Alice in Wonderland and How to Train Your Dragon. On March 23, 2010, Toy Story was released on Blu-ray/DVD combo pack which included a small feature of "The Story of Toy Story 3". Also, Toy Story 2 was released on that day in the same format which had a small feature on the "Characters of Toy Story 3". On May 11, 2010, both films had a DVD-only re-release which contained the features.
Mattel, Thinkway Toys, and Lego are among those who produced toys to promote the film. Fisher Price, a Mattel Company, has released Toy Story 3 with 21 3D images for viewing with the View-Master viewer.[25][26] Disney Interactive Studios also produced a video game based on the film, Toy Story 3: The Video Game, which was released on June 15, 2010.[27]
Toy Story 3 was featured in Apple's iPhone OS 4 Event on April 8, 2010, with Steve Jobs demonstrating a Toy Story 3 themed iAd written in HTML5.[28]
Pixar designed a commercial for a toy, Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear, and formatted it to look like it came from an old VCR recording. The recording was altered with distorted sound, noise along the bottom of the screen, and flickering video, all designed to make it look like a converted recording from around 1983.[29] A Japanese version of the commercial was also released online.[30]
On Dancing with the Stars' May 11, 2010 episode, the Gipsy Kings performed a Spanish-language version of the song "You've Got a Friend in Me". It also featured a paso doble dance which was choreographed by Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani.[31][32] Both the song and dance are featured in the film.
Sneak peeks of the film were shown on Disney Channel. One sneak peek was shown on Cartoon Network in the United States on June 10, 2010. On June 12, 2010, Disney Channel held "Toy Story Day" in which the first and second films were shown along with more sneak peeks.

In the UK, it broke the record for the largest first day ever for animated feature both on DVD and Blu-ray in terms of sales revenue. Additionally, on its first day of release on iTunes it immediately became the most downloaded Disney film ever.[36]
[edit]Reception

Toy Story 3 has received universal acclaim. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 99% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 246 reviews, with an average score of 8.8/10.[37] The critical consensus is: Deftly blending comedy, adventure, and honest emotion, Toy Story 3 is a rare second sequel that really works.[37] Among Rotten Tomatoes' Cream of the Crop, which consists of popular and notable critics from the top newspapers, websites, television, and radio programs,[38] the film holds an overall approval rating of 100% based on 37 reviews.[39] Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 92 based on 39 reviews.[40]
A. O. Scott from The New York Times states: "This filmâ€”this whole three-part, 15-year epicâ€”about the adventures of a bunch of silly plastic junk turns out also to be a long, melancholy meditation on loss, impermanence and that noble, stubborn, foolish thing called love."[41] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A, saying: "Even with the bar raised high, Toy Story 3 enchanted and moved me so deeply I was flabbergasted that a digitally animated comedy about plastic playthings could have this effect."[42] Gleiberman also wrote in the next issue that he, along with many other grown men, cried at the end of the film.[43] Michael Rechtshaffen from The Hollywood Reporter also gave the film a positive review, saying: "Woody, Buzz and playmates make a thoroughly engaging, emotionally satisfying return."[44] Mark Kermode of the BBC gave the film, and the series, a glowing review, stating that Toy Story is now "the best movie trilogy of all time".[45] Writing her review for USA Today, Claudia Puig gave the film a complete 4 star rating writing "This installment, the best of the three, is everything a movie should be: hilarious, touching, exciting and clever."[46] Lou Lumenick, film critic of The New York Post, wrote "Toy Story 3 (which is pointlessly being shown in 3-D at most locations) may not be a masterpiece, but it still had me in tears at the end."[47] Michael Phillips gave the film 3/4 stars writing that "Compared with the riches of all kinds in recent Pixar masterworks such as Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up, Toy Story 3 looks and plays like an exceptionally slick and confident product, as opposed to a magical blend of commerce and popular art."[48] Orlando Sentinel film critic Roger Moore who gave the film 3 1/2 out of 4 stars wrote "Dazzling, scary and sentimental, Toy Story 3 is a dark and emotional conclusion to the film series that made Pixar famous."[49]

In addition to the tracks included in the soundtrack album, the film also uses "Dream Weaver" by Gary Wright, "Le Freak" by Chic, and Randy Newman's original version of "You've Got a Friend in Me" that ends with the verse, "And as the years go by, our friendship will never die."
Also, tracks "Cowboy!" and "Come to Papa" included material from Newman's rejected score to Air Force One.[120] The song "Losing You" from Newman's own album Harps and Angels was also used in the first trailer for the film.[121]
The Judas Priest song "Electric Eye" was used in the temp score for the opening scene of Toy Story 3.[122] The aliens are cranking the tune in their sports car. But the song was ultimately replaced by another piece of music.
