,raindr0ps,2010-12-03T00:41Z,"The real name of this booklet is ""PC Errors Solved! Get Help for 100s of Error Messages"". Look around, you may have already downloaded this 2 years ago when it was first uploaded. That torrent now appears dead and it's nice that it has been uploaded again. Nice booklet, useful info. Thanks, MANTESH!
