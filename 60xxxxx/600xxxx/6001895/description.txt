"Last Christmas" is a song bypop duo Wham!, released on Epic Records in 1984, on a double A-side with "Everything She Wants". It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo. The song has been covered by many artists throughout the years.

"Last Christmas" was recorded in 2007 by Cascada. It was released on iTunes in November, 2007. The single had only a Digital release but 6 days later it was released on the single/EP "What Hurts the Most" which was the first single from their second album.

In the UK, despite it being a B-side track, the song is regularly played throughout music channels during the festive season.

Cascada (pronounced /kÉ™ËˆskÉ‘ËdÉ™/) is a German eurodance group active since 2004. They are most famous for their songs "Everytime We Touch" which won them a World Music Award in 2007 as well as becoming the group's first number one single, "What Hurts the Most" which reached the charts in 2008, and "Evacuate the Dancefloor" which became their first UK number one single in 2009. So far the group has sold an estimated 14 million copies of their three albums, and 36 million singles worldwide. Cascada consists of the German-born English singer Natalie Horler, and Record producers DJ Manian and Yanou. Cascada was originally founded as "Cascade", but the name had to be changed due to trademark conflict with the musician Kaskade.[citation needed]. In 2010 Cascada was announced as the second most downloaded dance artist of all time only being beaten by international dance producer David Guetta.

The worldwide lead single, "What Hurts the Most", was released in late 2007 and early 2008, along with its B-side, a cover of Wham!'s "Last Christmas". It became Cascada's second best-selling single in the United States, certified gold. On June 30, 2008, it was announced that the second single for the United States and Canada was "Faded" which appeared only on the North American version of Perfect Day. "Because the Night" became available as a digital download in Europe on this date and received a physical release on August 4, 2008. The last single was the album's title track, "Perfect Day", released in North America on February 17, 2009.

In the United Kingdom, a platinum edition of Perfect Day was set to be released on October 20, 2008, which was to feature the American tracks and a DVD with live performances from Clubland Live 2008, Horler's favorite Cascada music videos, an exclusive interview with her, a photo gallery and an acoustic performance of "Another You" in the studio with Yanou on piano. There was no further word about the album being released, and it was later cancelled.
