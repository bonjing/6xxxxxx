The Weekend (2007)

Over the course of a single weekend, various teenagers discover that, perhaps, they don't yet have it all figured out: Benjamin thinks he's going to marry his hesitant girlfriend, Marty pines for the unattainable Rachel, rich kid Jacob throws elaborate parties and sells drugs, and the underage "cool" Donny blackmails his "nerdy" older brother to tag along to Jacob's party.
