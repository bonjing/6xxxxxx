ReleaseNotes:

Donovan's music works well in this live performance. Great American Music, an ironic label for thismusician, put out this disc with generic comments about Donovan's live performances. Without knowing exactly where or when these were recorded, the quality of the recording is strong. The softer earlier songs that open the disc with "Catch the Wind," "Colours" & "Universal Soldier" are lovely acoustic renderings. Donovan is in good voice for his hits "Mellow Yellow" & "Sunshine Superman." On "Wear Your Love Like Heaven," one of my favorite songs in his catalog, Donovan gives an offhand performance, dashing the song off.

"Jennifer Juniper," "Lalena" & "Atlantis" shine as Donovan seems to enjoy each song in performance. "Cosmic Wheels" has a stripped down unplugged arrangement. "Trucking Your Blues Away" is a sweet acoustic boogie while "Love Will Find a Way" is a lovely track with flute. "Sailing Homeward" from Donovan's exquisite Essence to Essence set floats like a meditation. "Live Troubadour" is a good strong volume showing off Donovan's skills as a live musician.


Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
