    Wallace and Gromit have always taken their safety into     
    their own hands, and in this episode of the science       
    series they consider other inventors with the same       
    philosophy.                                               
                                                               
    They tell the tale of 1940s Hollywood starlet Hedy        
    Lamarr, who had a side-line in inventing, and who        
    devised a radio-controlled 'secret-communication'         
    system for steering torpedoes to help allied forces in     
    the war, the technology of which is featured in all       
    modern bluetooth systems.                                
                                                              
    We look at the most futuristic surveillance drones and     
    the history of spy technology, first developed using      
    the humble pigeon in WWI. In the USA, we look at the     
    fascinating history of spacesuits, while in the UK we     
    reveal the life of eccentricinventor Arthur       
    Pedrick and his helpful cat. Arthur owns hundreds of      
    patents, from explosive underground bomb shelters to     
    cat flaps, and sometimes a mixture of both.               
                                                               
    Ejector seats from past to present are revealed in the    
    UK, with some nail-biting tales of high-speed ejection   
    from the lucky pilots themselves, and finally Wallace     
    and Gromit take a look at some less successful health      
    and safety nightmares.
