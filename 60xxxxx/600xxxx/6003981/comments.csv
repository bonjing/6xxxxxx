[T],solstars,2010-12-08T15:46Z,I do not crop anything.  Cropping sucks and is obvious when done.  I capture with a Happauge HD Capture device.  The KOTH episodes were captured at the affiliate from the direct network feed.

As cheesy as the special effects look in the original, compared to the updated version, it is still better. I will change the file extension from .mkv to .mp4 using mkvmerge. Thank you uploader."
