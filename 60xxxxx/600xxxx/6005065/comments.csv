For a size of 3.5 GB, quality not the best. A few spots are out of sync. Thought this would be a better copy than the one I have, but no way."

So go buy it.  Where's your contribution, other than whiny comments?  Go make your own rips, learn how to create a torrent and put some booty on the table for the rest of us.  Leecher comments mean nothing to me so keep them to yourself.  Unless you're an uploader, for all I know you're DRM/anti-piracy.  The file plays fine on my end.  Are you viewing it on your machine with a VLC?  Stand alone player?  WMP?  Burn it to a DVD and try again.  It's most likely a bugged player."
