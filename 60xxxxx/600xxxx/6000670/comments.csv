,Wotter,2010-12-01T02:38Z,Thanks for the fast release alex.
,r3d_1,2010-12-01T02:52Z,yea im surprised how fast that was...does it come w/ a crack?
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-01T02:58Z,"if this works, than thank you thank you thank you thank you THANK YOU!
i've been re-searching S.M.B as often as possible, this is the first game I've ever actually tried to get the SECOND it was available...im seeding for a LOOONG time, and gonna buy this :)
btw, does this come with the steam exclusive Crab-head skin?"
,timmytissue,2010-12-01T03:12Z,"says he has steam protection, does that mean i have to make a new steam account to be online with while i play this? i have alot of games and i dont need to have them all jacked"
,timmytissue,2010-12-01T03:15Z,"dontknow where my comment went, someone tell me if playing this will get my steam banned..."
,Netarangi,2010-12-01T03:23Z,"Yes does this come with the head crab? Was wanting this and Deathspank on release. Deathspank was much faster I must say.. But still, this on release date is A+++"
,Wotter,2010-12-01T03:28Z,"just finished downloading, but the unrar process doesn't seem to be working properly (might just be me though)"
,Adnrw,2010-12-01T03:36Z,"I've downloaded it.
But it wont extract the exe?"
,Wotter,2010-12-01T03:36Z,Game is working great. thanks again alex.
,Wotter,2010-12-01T03:37Z,"adnrw, same happened for me, you have to highlight all the .rars then click extract here.
then just highlight the 1st of the new set of .rars and click extract here."
,Adnrw,2010-12-01T03:44Z,"@Wotter
Ahh thanks. It's done it now. :)"
,bongripper,2010-12-01T04:43Z,"anyone know about Steam banning issues?

and is this the same release as the THETA release?

thanks in advance."
,The_Fugie,2010-12-01T04:51Z,This isn't buggy at all.
,bongripper,2010-12-01T04:56Z,"yeah my comment disappeared too.

anyone know more about Steam banning? What if Steam's not running when you play SMB?

and is this a different release from the THETA release?

thanks in advance."

[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-01T05:24Z,"For everyone who is having problems extracting try this, because yes, i realized the way it was RARed is a bit confusing. (Thanks to Wotter who helped a few with this problem)

1. Select all the rar files

2. Extract to a different folder

3. run the unl-smbr.exe

4. Select where you want the game to extract


as for any other questions

- I do not know if you get the Crab-head

- I would recommend you make a separate Steam account if you decide to play while using steam.

- I dont know much about the THETA release, but apparently it crashes alot."
,911lol,2010-12-01T05:31Z,"I keep getting the error message ""need the following to continue extraction unl-smbr.r00""
?? can anyone help pleasei cannot find this rar"
,unique223,2010-12-01T05:53Z,"I think I'll wait for a release that won't lose me several hundred dollars if I become slightly forgetful, thanks."
,ryanppax,2010-12-01T06:03Z,ive extracted everyting fine but when i run the supermeatboy.exe i get a whitescreen and it says window shad to close program. what is wrong. ive also installed the c++ thing you listed
,bongripper,2010-12-01T07:59Z,"I have the latest DX and C++ package, but when I run the .exe I get ""Super Meat Boy has encountered an error and needs to close"".

Haven't been able to get it to run once. Any ideas?

Thanks."
,Netarangi,2010-12-01T08:18Z,"You don't need Steam installed for it.. It says the protection was Steam, not that you need it. You will not get banned for playing this."
,Netarangi,2010-12-01T08:19Z,Game doesn't work for me. Double click the .exe and it comes up with the send or don't send screen.
,munzyman,2010-12-01T08:24Z,"What do I do with the .zip files?

I need a full walkthrough pleeeease :)"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-01T08:58Z,"for those of you who cant even run the game, it seems to be a directx issue. Try re installing directx, specifically 9.0c.

@munzyman

1. Select all the rar files

2. Extract to a different folder

3. run the unl-smbr.exe

4. Select where you want the game to extract"
,KillingDeath,2010-12-01T09:02Z,"Where is the unl-smbr.exe
Because I can't find it anywhere?"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-01T09:45Z,"If you're having trouble with this release, try downloading the THETA release: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6001616"
,BxCc,2010-12-01T10:56Z,"ive been downloading torrents for a while but never connected a pirated game to steam.

is it possible to connect the game to steam"
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-01T16:06Z,"k, so I've played some of this, it works, and is really great. I don't find much buggy except in the replays, if you destroy a wall while playing the wall stays up during the replay and it appears as though you are going through walls (no big deal though).
as for getting banned, I don't think you would, but if your paranoid just exit steam before running, problem solved.
those having trouble installing, you need to first highlight ALL of the rars, and extract them...you then extract only one of the rars in the folder that you just extracted from the first bunch of rars. You then should have a folder containing the .exe, install with that, and you should be up and running.
911lol, that should fix your problem (i had the same thing)"
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-01T16:07Z,"to be more specific, 911lol, the reason your getting that message is cause you are trying to extract what is inside the first bunch of .rars by selecting only ONE of them...you have to select them all, and THEN extract."
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-01T16:09Z,"BxCc, you can put it into your steam library (I don't think there are any risks in doing so, maybe someone can confirm whether there are or not for you, or google it), but that would not make it so that you have things like steam achievements...it would be in there as a non-steam game, so really there's no point, unless you want to have a list of all your games organized in steam."
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-01T20:07Z,I can confirm that this does have the Crab Head steam exclusive
,gorunt,2010-12-01T23:27Z,"There's a bug where Meat Boy looks like he's running really fast in place when he's just standing. Graphic or Game-play issue?

This causes Meat Boy to not jump when I want him to unless I rapidly press the space button. I can still run, but no jumping makes this game unplayable. HELP pl0x!"
,Uyoku,2010-12-02T00:11Z,I'm having problem with World 3 boss - he's not visible at all.
,doiselldrugs07,2010-12-02T00:40Z,"has anyone gotten the replays to work? for me, the saves have ridiculous timestamps (in the 1000's), and if I even go to the replay menu than it makes the game freeze/crash"

,TTSoul540,2010-12-02T12:23Z,"Hi I did just about everything asked in the instructions but I get this error message ""SuperMeatBoy.exe has encountered a problem and needs to close...."" I tried adding it as a non-steam game and still did not work. Is there a particular file or software missing maybe?"
,heroin99,2010-12-02T14:14Z,"@boomman Blame the release groups for this archiving system. 

There are 31 zip archives so that its easier to download and in case one of the archives goes bad, it can simply be replaced. Mind you the release groups do not use torrents.

Most of the p2p uploaders first unpack the release they get from newsgroups (and direct-dl sites) before torrenting it. Seems like alexisthebest didnt unpack. 

All in all, stop complaining boomman, at least you get this shit for free. You can easily unpack by selecting all archives -> rt click -> then click ""unrar/unzip here"" or simply by unziping the first part. 

Thanks alex and Unleashed. Good game."
,zorome,2010-12-02T17:13Z,"WTF??? Quoting our honourable member:

THIRTY ONE ZIP ARCHIVE EACH CONTAINING APIECE OF RAR ARCHIVE, WHICH UNPACKS TO ANOTHER ARCHIVE, WHICH UNPACKS THE ACTUAL GAME.

WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy????????????"
,boomman,2010-12-02T17:52Z,"@heroin99
If you care so much about people with broken HDDs that can waste information, why it is not a single archive with restore information?! It achieves exactly the same effect, but less space wasted on HDD!"
,Nissehultss,2010-12-02T20:14Z,"When i try to launch it it says ""Missing XINPUT9_1_0"". Help?"
,Nissehultss,2010-12-02T20:19Z,"My comment just dissapeared. Once again: When i try to launch the game it simply says that i cant find a file called ""XINPIT9_1_0"". Anyone help?"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-02T23:22Z,"@heroin99

Yea, it was packed into one Rar and i unpacked it and made the torrent, didnt realized i needed to upack that too untill after the torrent had many people downloading. 

Sorry bout that.


@boomman

Relax dude, my bad on the archiving, but heroin is right, the release group made it that way, i just upload it.

If you're having trouble, just get the THETA release which is just a simple exe to extract the game."
