The update files go in .minecraft\bin

There is a windows installer for those who don't already have minecraft. You can use it just to update too.
If you want to get the files in it to do a manual install, use 7-zip or winrar to extract them and put them in "username\appdata\roaming\.minecraft". If you have xp its "username\application data\.minecraft".

I don't have linux or osx so I don't really know where the files go if you are using a linux os or a mac.
