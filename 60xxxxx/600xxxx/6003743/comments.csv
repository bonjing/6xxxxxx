,narfdude,2010-12-02T04:24Z,@cameron0ne the updater that comes with yours still has to download the files. mine is an installer with the files already included. you shouldnt advertise your torrent by posting stupid comments.
,lildon,2010-12-02T04:31Z,"we were talking on your other torrent. I posted my system spec on my other comment.  I tried it on my laptop and it worked just fine, but my laptop is broken beyond repair and i managed to get it to work for about 3 minutes and minecraft worked.  I open it up and log in then click play offline and get the Mojang Specifications screen and it freezes there. i really want to play this game....
Is anybody else having this problem?"
,narfdude,2010-12-02T05:39Z,"@lildon i think i found the problem. your graphics controller only supports opengl 1.3. minecraft requires 1.4. you still might be able to get it to work though. check this page for more info and update your drivers.

,lildon,2010-12-02T17:39Z,"well i went there and found my graphics controller and download the update. when i go to install it says it cant be installed on this system. i guess i'm just out of luck then :P
Thanks for taking the time to try and help me though."
,Digital55,2010-12-02T18:25Z,Thanks again narfdude for a speedy upload. Really appreciate it. Thanks!
,hugo123889345345,2010-12-02T20:09Z,Thanks.
,narfdude,2010-12-03T00:11Z,@lildon there's a chance you could have downloaded the wrong drivers. that could be the reason they didn't install. it might be easier to use a program like driver genius to get the drivers. it is here on tpb. I recommend the one uploaded by hellboy.
,kontinyu,2010-12-03T01:40Z,"thank you very much!
keep up good work!"
,Lithianlord,2010-12-03T04:56Z,"So how can I make a server for this client version? Me and a few guys want to play Lan, but unlike in the 1.2.2 we want to actually be able to hurt eachother and mobs. "
,0Angerisagift0,2010-12-03T19:31Z,Thanks for all the updates. Your torrents so far have been superiour to the other uploaders.
,narfdude,2010-12-03T23:04Z,@ Lithianlord It's really easy to setup. Just download the server from minecraft.net and run it. There is a modded server that gives you a lot more control. Nanoentity usually uploads a nicely packaged one with plugins and other stuff. The plain modded one is at http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=1012&t=23340.
,krndude24,2010-12-17T02:51Z,"Wait.. how do i run this? the shortcut keeps opening 
Minecraft_name_alt.jar"
,narfdude,2010-12-17T21:48Z,@krndude24 sounds like you need to install java. install it and try again.
,krndude24,2010-12-20T00:59Z,oh i can just click download from the minecraft site and use that to open it. thanks for the download/help!
,robororor,2010-12-28T10:42Z,It says I need to log in online at least once to be able to play offline...help pls
,kweakness,2011-01-19T06:51Z,"hey. i just downloaded it. And i got it all. its just after i click ""play offline"" it crashes and gives me this.

what can i do to fix this???"
,narfdude,2011-01-20T00:43Z,@kweakness i've seen that error before. i'm not really sure what to do to fix it. the main thing you can do is update java. tell me if it doesnt work after you do that.
,Ponyo123,2011-02-04T07:36Z,"I suck with torrents, so hear me out.
I Try to Login with Empty Credentials, ""User Not Premium"" Error.
Using credentials ""Outdated Launcher""
Exactly what do I do here?"
,narfdude,2011-02-06T04:54Z,"@Ponyo123 you do know that ""empty credentials"" means you leave the login boxes blank right?"
,Ponyo123,2011-02-06T05:54Z,"@narfdude
Yeah, I know.
I tried with, and without credentials, neither way worked. 
I was just giving examples. I'm not really sure what to do here. I'm not updating or anything, I'm just trying to install the game. Or do I need like, a VERY ORIGINAL version of the game, then go update it?
HELP."
,Ponyo123,2011-02-06T06:04Z,"@narfdude
Sorry, the first one should have said ""User not premium"" error was using credentials, and ""Outdated Launcher"" was without using them.
I tried both ways, to make sure I didn't do anything wrong."
,narfdude,2011-02-07T06:06Z,"@Ponyo123 delete the ""lastlogin"" file and try again. If that doesn't work, try anjocaido's launcher/updater. you can find it here on tpb."
,Ponyo123,2011-02-07T07:17Z,@narfdude
,Ponyo123,2011-02-07T07:20Z,"@narfdude
It still wont work, and sorry about that last post. It keeps telling me ""Login Failed"" now. The launcher updater I found is a cracked installer, and IT is telling me that this certain file can't be downloaded and it can't be installed and has to exit. I'm not getting an ""Out Dated Launcher"" anymore, It's ""Login Failed. Play online once, to enable offline"""
,Ponyo123,2011-02-07T07:26Z,"@narfdude
Sorry bout so many posts, just trying to resolve my problem. I've got it working to the point where it just asks for my username and has the ""Force Update"" thing. Either if I click it, or not, it starts then says ""Failed to start. The file C:\Users\Blah\AppData\Roaming\minecraft\bin\lwjgl.jar Could not be located."""
,narfdude,2011-02-07T23:10Z,@ponyo you are really having some bad luck with minecraft. manually install it and use minecraft_name_alt.jar to start it.
,nightelff,2011-03-02T20:16Z,Thankyou works fine
,neofusion,2012-04-15T19:55Z,"LOL this is not Minecraft 1.2.5... This is the  Alpha 1.2.5, you know BEFORE they even had a beta out. look at the date: 2010-12-02 02:47:37 "
,DipKins96,2012-06-22T00:00Z,EVERYONE BEWARE THIS IS ALPHA 1.2.5 NOT THE FULL RELEASE.
