,jon4fun,2010-12-02T22:17Z,"@ All - I know there are all sorts of rules about placing links in torrents so to be on safe-side you'll have to do some typing.

Read the December 2 issue of the Huffington Post and EVERYONE then click through and at the very least sign the petition. 
I would ask US citizens that you personally, tweet, e-mail and snail your congress and senate on top of signing the petition.

This may bea US law but it will effect everyone, everywhere.

Thank you
Jon"
,jon4fun,2010-12-02T22:35Z,"@ All - related to my comment above and again not wanting to put any external links directly onto TPB.
Please go to Huffington Post and do a search for [stop the internet blacklist] or [David Segal].
There are lots of articles 2nd Decmber is just the latest.

Thank you
Jon"

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-04T11:12Z,"Thanks.

@nikoHD: Do you mean Classic Doctor Who? With William Hartnell? Namely, link doesn't work ( not .or but .org).

No, I cannot. Sorry. But I can send you a .dlc for jdownloader (fileserve, 11.24 GB, not my UL) as reply to your e-mail. It's up to you. BTW, Torrent on demonoid for complete Classic Doctor Who is still alive."
,nikoHD,2010-12-05T02:19Z,Hi again 20/40 i meant the new one with David Tennant as the doctor and Billie Piper as rose.
