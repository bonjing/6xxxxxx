Became anxious with looking for good torrents and patching data under mac os, finally here it is...
...Fully playable out-of-the-box version of HEXEN 2 for Mac OS X!

Based on Hexen II: Hammer of Thyrion (port for unix, mac etc) but with added .pak's from full game version, patched by 1.11 patch
Before playing (took from readme inside):
* You need SDL.framework in your /Library/Frameworks folder.  Get:
  http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.13.dmg and copy SDL.framework
  from that package into your  /Library/Frameworks  folder.

Includes Mission Pack - Portal of Praevus. For playing it just start Hexen 2 MP app and in "New game" menu select "New missions". Includes new character - demoness which is also playable.

More info can be found in ReadMe file and on official HoT web-site.

On button P all-mana-all-weapons cheat is bound.

Happy solving quests and killing angry bosses!
