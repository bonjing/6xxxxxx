Summary:
During the Cold War, Soviet agents watch Professor Henry Jones when a 
young man brings him a coded message from an aged, demented colleague, 
Henry Oxley. Led by the brilliant Irina Spalko, the Soviets tail Jones 
and the young man, Mutt, to Peru. With Oxley's code, they find a legendary 
skull made of a single piece of quartz. If Jones can deliver the skull to 
its rightful place, all may be well; but if Irina takes it to its origin, 
she'll gain powers that could endanger the West. Aging professor and young 
buck join forces with a woman from Jones's past to face the dangers of 
the jungle, Russia, and the supernatural.
