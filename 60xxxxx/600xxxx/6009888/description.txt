Release Notes:

Found this online with the help of some friends. This is in RAW form, did nothing to the video and the audio I re-synced because it was oos. I wanted to convert this and get it out, I know the video aint the best, but this is how I got it, so groups that want to do something to make this pretty here it is to play with. I will be shortly coming out with a v2 of this encode fixing any problems and uglyness it has. Enjoy //iNK

iNK is currently a free agent looking for work, if you got any audio problems on a release and would like iNK's audio touch, give me a email at: digital.ink@live.com or MSN add me.

PS: If you need this audio track sent directly to you for your encode, contact me.
