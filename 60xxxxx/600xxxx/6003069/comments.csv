I have downloaded and installed, and am following the directions in the txt, however I am unable to get the keygen to load. I am fine getting up to this point, but when i type java -jar Keygen.jar , i am getting a message java is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file. I have added the directory of java.exe to the environment variables but this problem still persists. Any suggestions? Thanks"
