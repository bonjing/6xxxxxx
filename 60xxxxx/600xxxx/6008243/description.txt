Fact: 1/3rd of all external hires are no longer with the organization after 2 years. What can you do about it? In a word: onboarding; although poorly understood, subject to narrow definitions, and with limited best practice understanding or management rigor. Consultants Mark Stein & Lilith Christiansen have worked with leading companies on it, and theyâ€™ve synthesized their work into a ready to use system. With Successful Onboarding, you can:

* Rewrite the employer-employee compactâ€”to everyoneâ€™s advantage
* Reduce time-to-productivityâ€”while increasing the level of productivity and retention
* Make improvements at the systemic levelâ€”with gains realized with regularity
* Enroll new hires in your companyâ€™s strategic plan

Successful Onboarding provides a business case, a systemic approach to the entire process, and instructive inside stories from Apple, Starbucks, Netflix, Microsoft, Baird, Bank of America, John Deere, and dozens of other industry leaders..
