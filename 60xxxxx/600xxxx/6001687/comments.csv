,TheSarj,2011-02-01T06:57Z,"@albatronix

Where does it say it's an image file?
I see ""DVD Rip"". That tells me it's ripped from a DVD because I'm not a moron!!"

,srennie,2011-03-17T22:04Z,Thanks a bunch! Why are people so impatient and insensitive to each other with their messages? It seems pointless to me...
