,Lemberg,2010-12-04T11:46Z,"Are Conan's viewers still supposed to have respect for the show after this? I know fast forwarding is an option - I watched about 20% of the appearance of the first three guests, but it was still saddening to see how low the vibrational state of the states has sunk. A 20 minute long segment showing a homeless man begging for change would have lit up my day more than the nonsense of the first three guests.
Nealon saved a bit of the damage done, but was given very little time in comparison.

I feel bad for Americans - so much of what they've stood for in the past has gone down the drain; education, health, conceptions thereof and consequently what passes for entertainment is at a faster pace gradually losing the spark it may once have had...

By the way, does anyone else miss the little skits in between guest segments that they used to do on the Late Night show? Wasn't ""The Interrupter"" and other random personalities they used to introduce night after night far more entertaining than the internet-related ""news"" stories in these extended monologues?

Greetings from Finland."
,reyer87,2010-12-04T15:16Z,"I agree with you, the odd skits and the ""low - budget"" segments they used to do was what made the show fun to watch. Still , I think moving to TBS along with Andy was a good thing, they still have this weird ( in a funny way ) chemistry between eachother. 

This whole Chevy Cruize give-away thing is a shame to the whole show, just feels wrong. It's nice they're giving away stuff but it's becoming more Oprah and less Coco if u know what I mean.

I miss the interupter, yes. Also Triumph, Masturbating bear, Noches de Passion, Jordan Schlansky among others. Conan isn't as random as it used to be, which was what made the show so much more fun.

The episode with Harrison Ford was amazingly awkward and weird, just like it's supposed to be!  "

big fan of eztv!"
,MAKO-89,2010-12-08T18:28Z,"Agreed, where is the December 6th show? And soon the 7th...
I can't watch the show from teamcoco.com, since I'm not from US. Only the small clips work, but not the full episodes."
