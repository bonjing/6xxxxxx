Rosetta Stone V3
Turkish (L1, L2, L3) (ISO)

When I acquire the Audio Companions, I'll post all as a complete package.


      ======== Note ========

These are ISO files, not executable applications.

Some people download these files with no idea how to run them.

An application (separate) is required to use these data files.

Also, this is not a bulletin or blogging site.  Please make your comments

relative to the posted torrent.


For Windows OS: Suggest using MagicISO's MagicDisc (Freeware)
