,chucktg69,2010-12-04T05:47Z,"Hey man.  Love that your back.  Can't find a couple of audiobooks that are new.  I am hoping you can.  Douglas Preston - Fever Dream, and Clive Cussler - The Spy.  Would appreciate it very much if you could get a hold of them for me.  I have several books in my library by other authors.  If you have any requests just send it my way."

,Zman999z,2011-04-06T02:32Z,"Thx for sharing.
Any one know where i can get Turkish language pack for  macs.  Tried to use this one, keep getting 'This language content requires an update of Rosetta Stone'.  Any information is appreciated. "
,jkp114,2011-06-01T03:39Z,"Thanks for the upload! But I am on a mac and have rosetta stone v.3.0.5 I think downloaded... I was super excited to use this, but when I tried to install it says that there was an error and advises me to contact customer service.

I am assuming this is because this torrent is not for Macs.  Is there anyway you could also do a mac version, or does anyone know where I can find one??

Thanks again!"
,jkp114,2011-06-01T15:56Z,"Nevermind, I got it to work but downloading a newer version of the Rosetta Stone application.  However, I am having the same problem where After Lesson 2 it is locked without activation.  Does anyone know how to change this?? Please help!"

But when i mount these and try to add the language level, it says Update Required, and just goes back to home.  Im really desperate to use this, PLEASE HELP! ramorris2008@yahoo.com"
,Cloudy-7,2011-12-22T20:54Z,"@ramro2002
Chances are you need a newer version of RS to run these programs (like with the 4&5 levels of languages).  I suggest going to something newer. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)  This one (looking through the comments, as I'm just downloading it now)  seems to run German 4&5, so it should be able to run these.  Other than that, I don't know what to suggest.  (Also, make sure to completely unistall your RS before loading this one.)"
,Melody-Mell,2012-01-08T23:30Z,Hey guys...! am not the best in computers.. but i got the crack and the V3 RS.. i installed the main program but it launched..?? do i uninstall it re-install again and  and how do i over write it???
