Dr. Phil sits down with women who say they want big changes before their big day! First, Sarah says she won't marry her boyfriend, Eric, until he has his vasectomy reversed. Will he cave to her wishes? Then, several contestants from the new E! show, Bridalplasty, answer to Dr. Phil and their critics as to why they donâ€™t want to tie the knot until they completely transform their bodies! Plus, Irene says she won't marry Jake until she sheds 40 pounds. What will Dr. Phil say to help these brides-to-be walk down the aisle?
