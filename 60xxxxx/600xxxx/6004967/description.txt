Black Rain is a 1989  American action-thriller film starring Michael Douglas, Andy GarcÃ­a, Ken Takakura, Kate Capshaw and Yusaku Matsuda. The film was directed by Ridley Scott.

The story is centered on two New York City police officers who arrest a member of the Yakuza and must escort him back to Japan.

This film illustrates the stereotypes of American and Japanese cops and gangsters. The film was nominated for Oscars in Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing.

PLOT

Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) is a skilled motorcyclist and a tough veteran New York City police officer facing possible criminal charges; Internal Affairs believes Nick was involved with his partner who was caught taking criminal money in a corruption scandal. Nick is divorced  from his wife, who has custody of their two children. Nick also has financial difficulties due to alimony and child support as well as other concerns.

While having a drink at a local Italian restaurant/bar, Nick and his partner Charlie Vincent (Andy GarcÃ­a) observe two Japanese men having what appears to be a friendly lunch with some Italian gangsters. Nick is increasingly suspicious of the group until another Japanese man enters the restaurant with several armed henchmen and seizes a small package at gunpoint from the leader of the Japanese group. As the man turns to leave, one of the Japanese men at the table says, in Japanese, "The Oyabun [Godfather] will not stand for this." The leader of the Japanese group chimes in, "As always, such a troublesome child." The Japanese man finds these remarks insulting and he slashes the man's throat, stabs another in the chest, and then walks out. Nick and Charlie follow immediately and, after a short chase, arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick.
