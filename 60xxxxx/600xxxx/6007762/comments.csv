[T],BON-DUQA,2010-12-03T19:51Z,"How to burn HD DVD/Blu-Ray movie after ripping it to harddisk with AnyDVD HD
AnyDVD HD can't burn HD DVD/Blu-Ray disc. To burn them you need HD DVD/Blu-Ray burning software and HD DVD burner or Blu-Ray burner. The latest version of Nero Burning ROM supports both HD DVD and Blu-Ray formats. You will also need a blank media like BD-R, BD-RE for Blu-Ray burner and HD DVD-R for HD DVD burner.
