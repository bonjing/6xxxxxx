Caprica - S01E18 - Apotheosis

Good news. During the included Inner Space wrap up show they mention that the SyFy Channel in the states has ordered a new Battlestar Galactica based show called "Blood and Chrome". So, even though they killed this fantastic show perhaps the new one will be just as good. Let's hope !
