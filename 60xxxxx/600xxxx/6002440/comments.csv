,Thalinor,2010-12-02T04:02Z,"Thank you chillibean!  I am from the US and we ended up getting screwed by sci-fi (err ""sci-fy"" or whatever bullshit they now call it) with these last few shows.  Its a shame the cocksucker who now runs the sci-fi channel likes it in the ass so much, they had to replace this and the other great shows they used to run with bullshit like wrestling.  Saw an ad last night while watching SGU they are putting some bullshit reality TV people as guests on another sci-fi show?  Thats all this bullshit channel is truing into.  Not the sci-fi channel that it was 10 years ago.

Anyway, thanks again.  BTW Amazing seed rate!  I am pulling 300kb/s with one seed!

I will seed too for a few days.

Take care, Be safe.  TY Again!"
,IngesFingers,2010-12-02T04:03Z,"Don't waste your time... this torrent is going nowhere. 10 sodding hours now, nobody seeding and everyone else restricting their upload rates.
And the series' wrap up show? See two fat Canadian trekkies blathering on about nothing in particular. Waste of time!"
,IngesFingers,2010-12-02T06:20Z,"...and when, at last, the download completes, we find the quality of the video to be utter shite!
Really, DON'T waste your time with this bollocks folks!"
,chillibean,2010-12-02T06:47Z,I laugh at the troll .. ha ha
,truthy,2010-12-02T18:55Z,"thx for sharing,

now that I've finished watching the entire season I have to say: what a disappointment. it's a good thing that this show was cancelled. it had great potential but turned out quite boring and weird in my opinion - hopefully blood & chrome will be more entertaining, with less bad plot and a little bit more action."
,TheTrekhippy,2010-12-02T18:57Z,"Hi, thanks for trying.  Not sure what you used for a codec, Chillibean, but Media Player Classic with Full XP Codec Pack and FFDShow won't play the video, only the audio.  And No, the problem is not on my pc, I have just gotten the latest show from eztv and it plays fine."
,TheTrekhippy,2010-12-02T19:04Z,I am confused about how these comments are disappearing.
