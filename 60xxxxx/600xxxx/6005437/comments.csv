When this is downloaded all the songs are tagged with ""Zelta"" as the artist.

Also, I don't see any of these albums in his discography on Discogs.com.  Are these mainly bootlegs of the concerts?  The sound quality is terrific so this seems unlikely.  But no album names match.

And who is Zelta?  Last, what does Geet-Zelta mean?

Please excuse my ignorance of Hindi.

Thanks for the upload!  Great quality."
