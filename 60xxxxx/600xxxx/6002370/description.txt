An Introduction to Neural Networks
Publisher: CRC | ISBN: 1857285034 | edition 1997 | PDF | 136 pages 


Though mathematical ideas underpin the study of neural networks, the author presents the fundamentals without the full mathematical apparatus. All aspects of the field are tackled, including artificial neurons as models of their real counterparts; the geometry of network action in pattern space; gradient descent methods, including back-propagation; associative memory and Hopfield nets; and self-organization and feature maps.
