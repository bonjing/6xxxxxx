,lokdownmaniac,2010-12-04T20:17Z,"Replay Manager is buggy.

Try playing in Windowed Mode, ryanppax, if you're still having trouble with Meat Boy running in place.

,Strikefear13,2010-12-05T14:20Z,"I haven't had a single problem with this game until World 4.  Some of the moving platforms will randomly kill me when I'm standing on them, usually when passing under low ceilings above.  Anybody else have this issue? I can't beat a couple of stages in world 4 because of it.  4-2 was the first issue I had."
