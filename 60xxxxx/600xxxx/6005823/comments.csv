,Mr_Gamer,2011-02-08T10:04Z,"I LOVE it when pepole upload 720p MKV-Files

Actually, I don't get why pepole download the 350mb versions, since the comparative quality per megabyte is SOOOO much higher in the 720p-Releases."
,shanow2010,2011-03-09T20:28Z,10/10 thanks. :)
,darkscale,2011-03-12T15:05Z,"@Mr_Gamer: probably because not everyone has tons of bandwidth and/or HD-space like you apparently do? And also if you plan on dumping it to DVD, you can't fit as much on because DL discs are hard to get a hold of these days, and pricey? And not everyone has BD-burners either."

The girl playing Zoe Graystone is god damn fucking sexy and cute as hell."
