Well, here it is, John Bedini's legendary â€œG-field generatorâ€ from the early 1980s in all its glory running on the bench and putting out more power than John is putting in.

And ejecting a stream of freezing cold air from its interior, where one would â€œnormallyâ€ expect heat would be produced and dissipated.

In this DVD John Bedini, painstakingly traces the â€œG-field generator'sâ€ pedigree and history all the way back to the late Professor Raymond Kromrey, and John then presents the theory, the circuit diagram, what to do, and what not to do.  Watch, too, how John shows the motor running under load with the circuit only completed by a strand of wire the diameter of a human hairâ€”an impossibility with conventional EM energy.

Is this fanciful talk?  Well, John's manufacturing and production team was rapidly infiltrated and destroyed,  and M.I.T. bought up the last remaining twelve operational units from John, never to see the light of day again, so you can draw your own conclusions.

Also included is the archival footage from the celebrated 1984 â€œTown Hall Meetingâ€ with Bill Jenkins, in which John springs this technology on an unsuspecting world.

This DVD is truly historic.
