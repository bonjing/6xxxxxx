Also try: Microsoft .NET Framework 4

That should fix it."
,Wraithix,2012-03-21T04:19Z,"Hey there.

Just now checking this game. Noticed you said you patched it to 1.2 but at the bottom of the screen it says 1.03.

Is there something that needs to be done? Just trying to get the best experience out of it."
