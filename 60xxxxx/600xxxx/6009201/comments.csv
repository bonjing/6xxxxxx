LimeWire Pirate Edition is free, open source software based on the final beta version of the popular LimeWire filesharing application. After Lime Wire LLC stopped distributing its software in October 2010, a horde of piratical monkeys climbed aboard the abandoned ship, mended its sails, polished its cannons and released it FREE to the community to help keep the Gnutella network alive.

LimeWire Pirate Edition is pure P2P software; it does not depend on any servers operated by Lime Wire LLC or other companies. It does not include any adware or spyware, and it cannot be remotely monitored or shut down.

Features:
Based on LimeWire 5.6 beta
All the features of LimeWire PRO:
Turbo-charged downloads
Optimized search results
AVG Anti-Virus
Built-in torrent search
No toolbars, adware or spyware
No connection problems"
