IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Skajlajn.2010.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA ......Thanks mate :)
AUDIO:Skajlajn.2010.D.DVD.ELEKTRI4KA ......Thanks mate :)

This R5 is a fairly good source, but we did do our normal work to it of increase brightness, lowered contrast, sharpened, changed the rgb eq and crop and resized. Turned out pretty good... The audio was just muxed of the 5.1 Studio Audio back to the encode. :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
