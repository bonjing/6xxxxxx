########## GL ERROR ##########
@ Post Render
1280: Invalid enum


Can anyone help me please? I'd like to get this game to work before i purchase it.

,rezor664,2010-12-02T01:00Z,Is there a way of playing online?
,narfdude,2010-12-02T01:11Z,@rezor664 yeah. click multiplayer and enter the ip of the server.
,lildon,2010-12-02T01:37Z,"a command promt doesnt usually open up, but with this new version i downloaded, it did.  I have tried completely unistalling java before and it didnt work. Also, i have run the classic mode in the browser and it worked fine.  I didn't think it was a problem with minecraft because tons of people are playing it...I know this computers specs arent amazing and neither is the video crad, but it should be able to run minecraft.  Ive run other games that are 5gb and over in size.  I doubt im doing something wrong because it's pretty simple. Heres my specs:

Windows XP Home Edition
Intel(R) 82865G Graphics Controller
Intel Pentium(R) 4 CPU 2.80 GHz
512 Mb of RAM

Im not sure a screenshot would help because its just a black screen, but i will see what i can do."
