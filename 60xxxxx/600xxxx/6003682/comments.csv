,GothDude,2010-12-03T12:09Z,"HI mate

great upload would love to see all the DBZ movies in HD however would prefer to see them in Japanese with English subs.  Not having a go cos the upload is spot on otherwise mate"
,JUSTlN182,2010-12-03T23:36Z,"The first 10 movies are already on tpb in 720p by either Horrace or an anonymous user and all of the movies have the option of Japanese or English sub and dub except for the last 3(Bio-Broly, Fusion Reborn, and Wrath of the Dragon).
Hope this helps!"
