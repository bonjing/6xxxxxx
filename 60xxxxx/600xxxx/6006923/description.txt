"China"

After reading an article about China growing 
as a global power, Michael (Golden Globe 
winner Steve Carell) decides China must be 
stopped before they take over the US. 
Everyone in the office complains about 
Dwight's (Rainn Wilson) building standards 
and Pam (Jenna Fischer) threatens to move 
Dunder Mifflin to a new building.

Enjoy :)
