,Skidpalace,2010-12-09T01:09Z,"Video quality is great, but I am a bit of a noob when it comes to compressed video files.  
I cannot seem to get multi channel digital audio out of this file.
I am playing this with Win 7 Media Center through HDMI to a Pioneer 1120K receiver.
It only shows as ""Stereo"" or I can use one of the simulated surround modes.
Any help?"
