Thank you! No errors this time! Every song in perfect quality."
,Imperator42,2010-12-04T06:17Z,"Yep, definitely sounded better this time around. Enjoy. :)"
,antuan10,2010-12-18T08:22Z,"Could someone  please upload this same album but with the EXPLICIT lyrics, and still in FLAC, becouse ""We R Who We R"", ""Sleazy"", ""Crazy Beautiful Life"" and ""C U Next Tuesday"" are Censored, and in the remix of Animal it seems that the song is cut or has an error, please someone get the album and uploaded here in The Pirate Bay and put in the title FLAC and EXPLICIT VERSION."
,Imperator42,2010-12-21T17:04Z,I'm not sure were exactly the uncensored version is. Not *too* bad though.
,Retro-Dance-Freak,2011-03-01T20:29Z,Thanks!!!
