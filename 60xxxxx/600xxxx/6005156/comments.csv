,Netarangi,2010-12-02T19:51Z,"""If you get the leaderboard error when exiting, download this and use the .dll"". You want me to download 970MB just for a 200KB file? WTF you idiots"
,jimmythemunkie,2010-12-02T22:51Z,is this 4 DeathSpank - Thongs of Virtue or just DeathSpank?
,OmniNegro,2010-12-02T23:10Z,"The torrent poster is well known and trusted.

And from the additional notes we can clearly see this can be applied to the thongs of virtue release, but I am uncertain of the original. (I did not know there was a difference.)

@Neterangi

They did not say that this entire release is for the sub ~300 KB steamclient.dll file. The update doubtlessly does quite a bit more than that. And you are quite free to entirely pass on this posting.

The changelog is a bit vague. But would you rather they focus on fixing the issues or telling you what they already fixed? The answer seems obvious to me.

Good day to everyone. Be well."

""The answer seems obvious to me.""

@OmniNegro Instead of trying to sound intellectual, and coming off as an idiot.. focus instead on posting something that helps, or at least makes sense, or better still nothing at all :)

If you can't see a major discrepancy btwn the nfo and the filesize (esp. given the size of the game, which is not 1.3gb, but 1gb), you need 2 learn some sh1t

This can only be the whole game - patched"
,klord2010,2010-12-03T06:15Z,Just shutup and download. They updated their data package too.
,klord2010,2010-12-03T06:15Z,They did same thing to their previous game. all the .gg files. :P
,klord2010,2010-12-03T06:18Z,"Ah, this IS the previous one. My bad."
,OmniNegro,2010-12-03T21:36Z,"@psychomantis98

I do not believe I called anyone an idiot. And I know how to spell. :)

I did indicate that I am unsure exactly what this does.

Ah well. Let us not turn this into a mud slinging contest. I concede. Be well everyone."
,hitman585,2011-01-05T22:35Z,damn it didnt know it had another update with this size i just finished the first and wanting to play the 2nd... well im happy thats it free and thanks for all ur effort guys dont know what i possibly can do other than seeding XD 
,papayrus,2011-01-07T08:21Z,So is this the full version or just an update? Want to know because I dont have any other version of this now and I want to know if I nedd to install the main version first. I know the file size is big and it is most likely the full version but just want to clear things up for sure.
,papayrus,2011-01-07T08:22Z,I spelled need like nedd sorry but dont want some tard coming in and telling me to learn how to spell. Also whats the difference between this and the Thongs of Virtue version?
,madchanson,2011-02-03T06:38Z,"i tried downloading this, left in for 2 days. i come back and its still 0%  0.0"
,jedimarkus,2011-08-06T18:19Z,Anyone know where i can get this game for Mac
,greylion,2011-09-10T20:57Z,"@ madchanson:
Dunno what you're doing wrong, I got this downloaded in a few hours. Maybe allow your torrent client through Windows' firewall?
@ papayrus:
This is just an update for the Deathspank Skidrow release, not a full game."
,FearDz,2011-10-25T22:55Z,"Don't download this file....

Just delete only the C:\Users\AppData\Local\SKIDROW folder and play DTOV fresh ."
