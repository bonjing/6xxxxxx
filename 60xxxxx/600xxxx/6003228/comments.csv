,1TWISTED,2010-12-02T14:25Z,"thanks,.. nice job,.. well done,.. ; )"
,shakex5_bakex5,2010-12-04T08:30Z,Good job. Perfect patch.
,LittleMrJ,2010-12-20T04:44Z,"This torrent is genuine, works perfectly.
I found only one problem: I have to apply the crack patch every time I load the program, but this is an easy one-click operation, so no big deal.
THANK YOU!"
,LittleMrJ,2010-12-21T20:29Z,"Correction: The reason I had to apply the crack patch every time was because I did it with Finale open... Be sure to apply the crack THEN run Finale.

Excellent torrent, the industry standard for notation & music publishing. This is fully upgradeable, & at the time of this post Finale 2011b upgrade is already out."
,kellan6,2010-12-26T09:18Z,Norton found a trojan in the patch file once mounted/burned. Thought I should let you all know!
,aestier,2010-12-28T03:32Z,"This seems to be a very common problem with cracks and patches. Does anybody know, if it is really a trojan?"
,mortos3,2010-12-29T05:17Z,"No, It's not a trojan. The program suspects it of being bad because of its behavior. It is a program that is designed to modify another program, after all."
,mortos3,2010-12-29T05:18Z,"I mean that cracks/patches are obviously made to modify other programs, so of course they are suspected by Norton, etc."
,teck11918,2010-12-30T11:19Z,How do you open the files man??? 7 zip says its broken. help?
,LiKWiDCAKE,2011-02-05T18:25Z,"Um... Many of the functions are missing, including the ability to put in rests, which, call me crazy, but that seems to be kind of an important feature to have."
,cstaff18,2011-02-16T05:04Z,"Thanks a bunch! It took me a while to complete because norton stole your patch from me and I hadn't realized what happened, but i turned norton off and re-extracted the patch from the iso with 7-zip and pulled everything off. Couldn't be happier!"
,omgkillmepls,2011-02-19T22:34Z,Don't update or Finale will be unauthorized and you can no longer save.
,makidomyo,2011-02-28T04:34Z,"I'm having trouble copying the crack from the ISO file, it's giving me an error when I try to copy it anywhere (including the folder where Finale is installed).  I'm currently running Windows XP.  Help!!!"
,NobeardTomo,2011-03-18T05:26Z,"I try putting the patch in in every way shape and form I can imagine in getting it to run, but it says its not the right version for this computer, when finale 2011 is.  it says the patch is for a 32 bit system, but finale is for 64."
,NobeardTomo,2011-03-18T05:41Z,"Fixed my own problem. If you experience this problem its probably because you didn't follow directions to a ""T"".  If you have Power ISO (I recommend you DL this torrent if you don't) open things up untill you see the folder labeled ""REBEL""  inside it is the patch  copy and paste that file into the Finale 2011 folder.  If you have trouble from your firewalls like I did, turn off ALL forms of protection, and then once the patch is done and you can operate Finale 2011 freely, you may turn your protection back on.  Happy composing friends!"
,tck1981,2011-03-30T23:04Z,"Finale is working, but not activated. I cant copy the file, have tried to turn of the firewall but it wont copy! please, can someone help ? "

,pato205,2011-04-06T03:39Z,"Just a few questions here... so I unrar-ed the r-mf 2011 (which there are like 30 for some reason), and I installed the demo version of finale, and then it says (for windows): ""Copy the file patch_finale_2011.r2.exe from the REBELS folder on the DVD to the folder..."" I can't find the patch, there is no rebels folder and I have no idea what the DVD is. Plz help me! (I'm using a 64-bit computer with windows 7 on it, if that helps)"

,pato205,2011-04-13T21:54Z,Never mind. sorry for the noob error. I fixed it.
,Lordmike3,2011-04-14T04:57Z,"wow, rar files. what the hell. all i want is the crack"
,gregbr,2011-04-17T17:25Z,AVG says the patch is a trojan (Generic20.AQXT). Does anyone know if it is really a trojan?
,tcf601,2011-04-29T01:06Z,"Works perfect, the only issue im having is the ARIA player is distorted. Also, I can't playback old files from 2K9, it cant locate the instrument patch for some reason.  To fix this I just set playback to MIDI.  Works flawlessly though. Scanning is 96% percent accurate when importing :D"
,syquest,2011-05-06T02:08Z,"Thanks but I only need the patch for 2011b...
Does anyone could send the patch_finale_2011b.r2.exe file ?

Best !"

,lente323,2011-05-10T05:41Z,I had the same problem as pato205 if you could help me figure this out I'd be grateful. 
,notverysuperdean,2011-05-13T10:51Z,Thanks so much rebels! I never would have had the money to put in this if i had to pay for it. :)
,rulerdude,2011-06-12T20:03Z,"Thanks for posting this! According to other comments, it seems like it works. Down at about 470 kb/sec. Will be finished in bout an hour."
,jclark5093,2011-06-23T23:29Z,"Anyone else having the patch trigger as a Trojan? I haven't gotten a virus from software in ages, and I don't want to start that again!"
,gislenealmeida,2011-06-28T17:31Z,"Thousand of thanks, Rebels!!! It worked perfectly in my PC!! An advice for those who are having problems on installing it: you have to turne off your antivirus or the instalation procedure will not work!! After you install Finale, turn on your antivirus again! "
,TheBariClariDude126,2011-07-04T07:46Z,I've been using finale for 4 years and it is the best software out there. SUCK IT Sibelius! 8D
,JrvUnleashed,2011-07-12T03:30Z,"Sweet, been looking for this. Downloading at 3.5mb/s. God I love trackers. "
,toastpenis,2011-07-13T02:02Z,MSE says Trojan. no thanks.
,JrvUnleashed,2011-07-13T18:47Z,"Dude, everything works in this except for exporting to audio file, which is broken and creates a corrupt audio file. What's up?"
,mrbajista,2011-08-24T08:16Z,"Works great, except one request:  Crack doesn't help if you update to 2011b.  Is there a crack to fix this?"
,ademshkij,2011-08-24T21:16Z,"So I've downloaded, and installed, all functions are working. However...when copying to paste the patch in the install folder, it tells me I do not have permission to access it. So...can't copy it, move it, access it, or do anything at all. If you un-mount (as error message suggests) then it asks for a disc. Solutions? 30 days are about to run out."
,mrbajista,2011-08-25T04:06Z,@ademshkij: Disable your virus scanner.  That worked for me.
,rimato,2011-08-25T19:53Z,"Having same problem as most, I can't copy/paste, or move the patch_finale_2011.r2 file to the Finale 2011 file to patch. Do I need to do something system-wise to make it work? It says I do not have the appropriate permissions. Also, My firewall is off and so is anti-virus."
,kuffuor98,2011-09-12T23:08Z,Please I need help! My finale is locked because of authorization and i dont know what to do !
,iso_top,2011-09-23T09:44Z,"I had the same problem, not being able to do anything with the pach_finale_2011.r2 in Vista Home premium (64), however it worked perfect in Windows XP, so i solved it by booting to XP (i have duel boot) and did the operation from there, (to the Vista drive). I then rebooted to Vista and everything worked  lika a charm! No corrupt audio files for me. I did however notice that the Garritan Ambience was missing (could not add any reverb). Solved this by placing a garritanambience.dll file in the VST folder.
A big big thanks to Rebels!"
,geotho,2011-10-24T23:15Z,"Highly appreciated for your work Rebels.Thank You.A message will come whenever I  close the application ""layered hidden window"" finale.exe-Application error in my XP.Please someone could help?"
,TigStripe,2011-10-28T01:24Z,"I have tried everything under the sun to get the patch to work on this, but with absolutely no luck.  Sorry, iso_top, but not all of us are running two different OS on their machine.  I'm pissed off at this torrent, and I want to know how people have been accessing a file that won't even let me take permissions."
,geotho,2011-10-28T14:07Z,authorisation code not found.patch worked perfect.
,cubitusz,2011-11-12T16:43Z,Windows anti malweare on Windows 8 detects the patch as Trojan:Win32/Dynamer!dtc. are you really sure it's safe? I wouldn't try
,acidmic,2011-12-13T18:49Z,I can't get the trial for 2011....only 2012....am I too late?...or just not very smart?
,gfunk12,2012-03-29T12:02Z,"WTF?! I can't get the f'n patch file to open. I've tried everything. Like others, it says I don't have permission to open it. M'fer!! I appreciate you guys trying to get us some good apps, but can you please answer this issue. I'm f'n frustrated to the hilt. "
