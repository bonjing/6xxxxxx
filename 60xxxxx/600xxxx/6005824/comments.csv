i am not taking requests, that ship has sailed

if there is a next it will be white men can't jump ntsc"
,Crawler25,2010-12-02T21:17Z,"I've downloaded some of your movies in the past and just wanted to say thanks. Your movies always work and are of good quality. Not going to be downloading this one cause I already have it, but just wanted to say thanks again."
,I3iggy,2010-12-03T06:26Z,I'll be seeding for a while. I love your stuff! The lack of seeders on tpb piss me off too... what other site(s) you use?
[T],ctang,2010-12-03T22:17Z,i upload on private sites
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-04T04:46Z,"dude its been a while , thanks for the movie and may i ask which ""private sites"" ."
[T],ctang,2010-12-04T05:15Z,mostly bithq
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-04T10:12Z,"ur soo lucky dude , two sites i wish to get an invite from thedvdclub and Bitme . "
[T],ctang,2010-12-04T18:35Z,im also on thedvdclub but it really isnt that good...not that many people on it so not a lot of traffic per torrent
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-05T10:34Z,would u like to trade? lol
[T],ctang,2010-12-05T20:40Z,trade what?
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-06T07:37Z,"like u don't know , nevermind skip the subject "
[T],ctang,2010-12-06T19:24Z,"if you mean an invite i dont have any yet...you need to be a power user (i think) on both sites to have any and im not there yet...sorry 

-ctang

agantbay: agreed!!!"
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-06T20:47Z,"oh man i all most got a heart attack when u said the sign up was opened which wasn't ""invitation code needed"" , anyways if u guys are saying the site's not any good den which site is out there which is about ""dvd r"" movies and doesn't need an invitation code . very hard to find a private tracker which doesn't need an invitation code for sign up . "
[T],ctang,2010-12-08T00:34Z,"you should check out ilovetorrents.com...it seems to be a fairly decent site (at least when compared to tpb)...if you compare it to other private sites then it really isnt that good...its not a bad site so worth the look...you do have to maintain a certain share ratio >.7 i believe at all times

,keleieke,2010-12-08T03:43Z,"I donât usually write in these, but this IS a momentous occasion; hopefully the band is getting back together.  And that was a smart move your recent comment on Seedkey."
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-08T11:20Z,"ctang 

tht site really anit worth it TPB rules seriously , if there is a site about ""keeping a ratio or get banned"" that is not a problem let me know, i am seeder i seed what i get to a 1.2 ratio at best . Invitation sites have one problem ""invitation codes""."
[T],ctang,2010-12-09T02:08Z,"i havent found a private site yet that doesnt keep a ratio for you...i like that a lot...to be honest with you, if tpb had that feature it would be the best torrent site on the net

-ctang"
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-09T17:57Z,"ctang 
  dude the only reason i am searching for other sites is because you guys are gonna stop uploading to TPB ""if no seeds are present"" . It was because of Djfred i knew the awesomeness of getting a movie in Full DVD , then after a while in TPB he quit , then came u and mike , mike stopped a while back now and then u seem to be slowly leaving cuz of those private sites . Almost forgot tater44, the dude seems to have left too ,how sad . Man really this makes me feel that TPB is becoming empty slowly slowly . its seems that i will have to fly back to Britain to watch a movie .

@agentbay 

i totally agree mate ."
[T],ctang,2010-12-09T22:15Z,"thats the only reason we basically have all left is the ratio thing...that and you cant upload on tpb using a seedbox bc the seedbox doesnt allow it...it takes me around 4 days to upload 1 DVD9 on tpb when it takes me half that time to upload the same to a seedbox and have unlimited bandwidth with it...i can from the seedbox upload around 40GB a day!!! when you think of that, what is the draw to tpb...to be honest with you, there isnt a draw...at least not for me...i used to get satisfaction form people downloading my torrents from here but now i get tons more from the private people because they SEED BACK or get banned...i dont care that they are forced to seed back, they still are seeding...take this for example, i am downloading Tron (80's movie) currently at 4.5mbps to the seedbox and it was uploaded April 10, 2009...you wont find that on tpb

at least with me, MM and tater on the private sites, it has really allowed SK to blossom!!! props to him :)"
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-10T08:49Z,"so u guys are actually ""moving"" from TPB to private sites , is Bithq only the private site u guys are uploading to or there are other sites . But does it matter i can't get an invitation code for any invitation site , i am telling u dude its really hard to get one , if u have any suggestions on how to get one please let me know . Thanks "
,Metal1Dead,2010-12-10T08:58Z,"btw u can't use a seedbox in TPB, thats strange i though SK is using a seedbox that is why his torrents are freaking fast . nevertheless u should also put in mind one thing that this is a public tracker so unregistered user won't have right to leave a comment either to thank u for ur work [ i know lazy ppl] . But in private trackers u need to be registered to get a torrent and so . i think u get my point . "
,Gratesse,2010-12-12T11:05Z,Can you please seed The Great Outdoors (1988) NTSC R1 [ctang] CADDYSHACK NTSC R1 (1980) [ctang] I'm at 99.0% since 11/7...I will seed as long as someone wants it
[T],ctang,2010-12-12T22:56Z,i dont have either of those...sorry man
,punisher_latin,2010-12-19T02:00Z,"Hi ctang Hello how are you, by chance the film will have driven, with Sylvester Stallone?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0132245/"
,idkwtf75,2010-12-23T12:13Z,"Thanks for the upload, always appreciate your work. Do you happen to have the last Harry Potter? ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""? I can only seem to find it in PAL format and/or MVK and certainly not in full DVD if I do.

Thanks so much!!"
,damagedmc,2011-01-12T02:48Z,"Night of the Living Dead 3D, year 2006, can you get this 3d version please. Thank you. You do good work please keep them comming."
,keleieke,2011-01-16T21:38Z,We have seeded this for months and deserve another bone ration.  Please ask the other Legionnaire's to do the same.
,bholmers,2011-02-21T08:05Z,Any chance of anyone having a ntsc dvd of Lion King 2 Simba's Pride?? Been looking for it awhile...
