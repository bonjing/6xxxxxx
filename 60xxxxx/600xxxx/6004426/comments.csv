ne chance of IAM LOVE in small size  ?? "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-02T13:22Z,"@htctouch: I have to make a room and deleted huge source immediately. It is 16/9 screen format, and as 272p movie would be 450-500 MB in file-size - not an substantial save, right?"
,bender1110,2010-12-02T16:37Z,thx for i am love - could 700mb be enough for 720p? or over 1gb for sure?
,froglog,2010-12-02T17:01Z,Thanks again
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-02T17:11Z,"@bender1110: I think that 720p could be decent looking ONLY if the duration of the encode is under 105 minutes and aspect-ratio is 2.35/1. If aspect ratio is 16/9 (1.77-1.85/1) maximum duration of the candidate would be 95 minutes. 
Many, many call me crazy for that... 

Number of b-frames rise up to 12, reference frames up to 8, cabac must be turned on, encoding speed drop-down significantly - and - such encode lose wide compatibility or acceptance by these factors alone.

However - many hard-core small-size H264 encoders knows that some movies can be compressed even more and go against aforementioned - in past year many encoders produce pretty regularly 720p sized 500 MB - but, with definitely various outcomes.

So, therefore I do not advocate insanely small 720p - there is no actual reason to encode 720p where 480p fits perfectly. Again, IMO."
,tylr,2010-12-02T19:09Z,"two very interesting points..

*  a newly requested movie, being uploaded in such short notice

*  u(20-40) typing down some stuff to prove ur point
^^^ IMO i think what he actually meant was a OK on compromise on quality as long it is in a ""small size""

speaking of which, consider doing any of these movies?
Mean Streets (1973) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070379/
Michael Clayton (2007) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465538/
..a reply wud be appreciated..

...4got one thing, THANK U for doing my req.. earlier"
,tylr,2010-12-02T19:13Z,"+1 in movie reQ
Pumping Iron http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076578/"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-02T20:34Z,"@tylr: I meant pretty much what I wrote, different thing is how and if my answer would be understood.

Regarding requests - they are seriously frozen till Xmas, however I will look into all placed in that period, and maybe will do few, I don't know how cookie would crumble.

Of these - I can surely say that ""Pumping Iron"" is out of the question, early Scorsese-DeNiro is not available and M Clayton was done back on mininova and it is only one of your requests within the picture."
,tylr,2010-12-03T02:48Z,"ok.. i get ur point
