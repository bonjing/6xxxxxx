,Yurn2,2010-12-01T21:48Z,"Is there any possibility of your rips being uploaded to DDL file hosts, or even a secure private bittorrent tracker? PirateBay is just to insecure for me, and probably many others, to use now, particularly with the owners being fined making PirateBay headline news and bringing it bad publicity.

Thanks."
,pinkpetal,2010-12-01T22:39Z,"@Yurn2 HolyRoses' ups have NEVER, EVER had anything malicious, viral, or infectious. I happily d/l anything HR has to offer because I know the quality will be second to none. There are things you can run your d/l's through such as a ""sandboxie"" but, as far as HR goes, you don't have to worry. "
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-02T15:59Z,that would take a lot more time for me to do.  you can upload them there if you like.  I post on public torrent site to make files available worldwide easily.
,never2ool,2010-12-05T18:08Z,all salient chat but DOES IT PLAY OK?????
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-05T19:41Z,it plays ok.
,Yurn2,2010-12-06T01:41Z,"@pinkpetal: I mean insecure in that the MPAA and RIAA and organizations with reasons to stop illegal transfers of their ""property"" actively connect and harvest IPs off Public trackers like PirateBay. I do block peers based on IPs that are known to be those organizations, but that method is only as good as the IP list so you can see with so many IPs to block, some may and do get through as a result of not being on the list."
,Yurn2,2010-12-06T01:41Z,Having these files on a big Private BitTorrent tracker would be ideal because it is a fact that people do get fined for sharing especially on (or via) such publicly accessible sites like PirateBay.
,Yurn2,2010-12-06T01:46Z,"Dunno why but my comments aren't coming through, anyway, the main reason I avoid PirateBay (PB) is organizations actively track IPs connecting via PBs public tracker."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-06T07:46Z,"piratebay doesn't run a tracker anymore.

disable the trackers you don't like."
,Yurn2,2010-12-07T01:32Z,"Oh, ok. The point I am trying to make is publicly accessible trackers are dangerous to use. because copyright holders have no problem identifying and fining those using them. I know a lot of people who'll not use PB for that reason. Alot of those who do use PB for getting stuff just don't understand the risks and have no other alternatives anyway. Many users are minors anyhow, so they would not be penalized.

PB is the only place I know of for well done iPod compatible rips, which is pretty much the only reason I'd use it, but considering the risk of fine and/or being banned from my ISP I won't use it."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-09T01:33Z,"rent a seedbox, use a proxy vpn service, one of them should work."
,drclay777,2010-12-14T22:40Z,"Holy Roses,

I have been looking for the manga movie ""Fist of the Northstar"" would you happen to have access to it and if so could you upload it as a handheld torrent? I would reall appreciate it."
,chtorren,2010-12-20T07:17Z,"Hey holy roses nice uploads for portables.
