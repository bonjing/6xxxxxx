No Rars or ISO files, this torrent is strictly .mov files and exercise files. 

At the time of writing, this training does not exist anywhere on the torrent sites, so I downloaded the multi-part files via the file upload sites, unrared it, and turned it into a torrent. Team JGTiSO is the original group that released this.
