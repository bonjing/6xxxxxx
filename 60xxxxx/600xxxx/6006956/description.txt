"Homesick to my Stomach"

Todd's (Ben Rappaport) feeling homesick 
for all things American until he learns he 
will be able to watch his favorite 
football team, the Kansas City Chiefs, 
play on television. Unfortunately, he gets 
side lined with a bad bout of food 
poisoning after eating street food but he 
refuses to miss the game, regardless of 
how sick he is. With Todd out of 
commission, Rajiv (Rizwan Manji) gets his 
shot at being manager and takes his 
responsibility to the extreme.

Enjoy :)
