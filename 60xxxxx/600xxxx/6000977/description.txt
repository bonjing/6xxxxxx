I found different DVDs on here, took the best quality videos and re-encoded so they are pure 16:9 files, instead of being embedded in 4:3 files with black bars.

Videos have been cleaned up, look really good.

The audio has been replaced with CD Audio for best quality. All videos are normalized and equal volume.

Video = MPEG-2 29.97 fps NTSC Progressive 16:9 (two videos are 4:3)

Audio = Source CD Audio, encoded to .ac3 48 KHz 224 kbps 

Enjoy!
