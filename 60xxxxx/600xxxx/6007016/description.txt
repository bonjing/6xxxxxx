Talk Talk - Such a Shame [Toppop 1984].VOB



Very HQ rare tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988.

"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.

"Such a Shame" is a song written by Mark Hollis for the English band Talk Talk's second album It's My Life (1984).

It was released as the album's second single in 1984, and became a big hit in continental Europe in 1984 and 1985, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries, and becoming a number one in certain territories (their second number one single after the remixed version of their song "Talk Talk" which topped the South African charts in 1983); but strangely this single was largely ignored in the UK. In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. "Such a shame" was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.
