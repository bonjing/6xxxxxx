,clemenza7,2010-12-07T04:34Z,"after installin jpvw and activating it, i can't do any updates.
once i finish installing the updates, it asks me to activate again but the serial number is changed from: MIE1-11PV-KLKR-KLCT to: VIW1-P1K8-TRZ3-J6LD (site code: FDTF- DTCG).

What can be done about this?"
,warloot24k,2010-12-08T04:43Z,"clemenza7:

Uninstall jeppview, then install it again, using cycle 01-2009 first, then after activating using R00D-KCAB, you can install the latest update.  Try it."
