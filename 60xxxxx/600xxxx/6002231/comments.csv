You will need to do few things before getting started with squid.
Open your squid.conf FILE #its ocated here---c:\squid\etc\squid.conf with notepad.
You will need to add these lines..

dns_nameservers [your gateway!]
visible_hostname localhost

thx for rating this -1 :)
and yes i m brownyboo.
see these blogs for more help!

15 people are not seeding this for not-so-working-proxy :p1~~~ okee!"
,robonaut-2,2011-01-31T09:54Z,"For people interested in getting squid new versions.
If u use squid for only simple caching purposes then u shud not bother yourself much. 

--linux based system already hav squid 3.2 BETA
--sadly there is only squid 3.0 for windows available which is still in beta stage.
there is not much development going for windows platform :(."
,count0nz,2011-04-12T02:33Z,"Nice work - Works well...
3.0 is not bad Realy 2.7 is the Norm on Linux and 3.0 is Stable on Windows.

I'll keep seeding this as long as i can."

Many thanks for uploading this. I went to the official page and got redirected back to the same page, with no executables. Hopefully this should work, I will seed..."
