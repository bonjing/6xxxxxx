As a solo artist and a member of Nickel Creek, Chris Thile has garnered a significant amount of acclaim, both for his prodigious bluegrass technique and his willingness to take musical risks. 2006's HOW TO GROW A WOMAN FROM THE GROUND, thefollow-up to 2004's surprisingly daring DECEIVER, shares many of the progressive tendencies of its predecessor, though it is more focused and song-oriented. On delicate, airy ballads ("Stay Away"), choral blues ("If the Sea Was Whiskey"), Celtic-flavored reels ("O Santo de Polvora"), and covers of Jimmie Rodgers and the Strokes, Thile demonstrates impeccable musical instincts. Naturally, the playing shines, not least on the album's several lightning-paced bluegrass jams.
