"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" is a Christmas song by John Lennon, Yoko Ono and the Plastic Ono Band. It was recorded at Record Plant Studios in New York City in late October 1971, with the help of producer Phil Spector. It features soaring, heavily echoed vocals, and a sing-along chorus. The children singing in the background were from the Harlem Community Choir and are credited on the song's single. The lyrics were written by Lennon and Ono, while the melody and chord structure were taken from the folk standard known as "Stewball".

Although the song is a protest song about the Vietnam War, it has become a Christmas standard and has appeared on several Christmas albums.

Sarah McLachlan led off her 2006 Christmas album Wintersong with a cover of this song.
