,stangace,2011-03-23T23:15Z,"not bad, took about 24hrs total to download, w/ DL rates being pretty pitiful half the time (less than 200kb/s)

I've all ready seeded it out at least once so I'll keep it up for a while longer to help the dl rates a bit, since I've been UL'ing at around 300kb/s+"
,hiroman17,2011-03-31T10:17Z,"Well you got all the episodes and extras in one day although i had to search them for about 3 weeks and download them whit 20kb/s for 2 weeks so i think you had better conditions then me m8 and it is not in me power it is in seeding i seeded it about 500 gb and still seed so it will not die soon =]
