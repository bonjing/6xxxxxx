Do you have ""Perfect Dark Zero"" PAL or RF ? If so please try to upload it as i cannot find a well seeded torrent online."
,moparneon,2010-12-08T01:02Z,yes i cant get any games that anybody wants via gamefly. Just give me a week and i should have both games up and tested through abgx.
,neilley,2010-12-09T10:59Z,AP25?
,moparneon,2010-12-10T03:04Z,no i ran game through abgx and it passed. ap25 is only found on newer games like fable 3 and need for speed hot pursuit and maybe future games. I run all games through abgx and if they need to be patched i will do it.
