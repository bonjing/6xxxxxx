Digital Tutors Understanding Object Transformations in InDesign CS5

Well get started by learning how the basic selection tool can be used not only to move objects but to resize, scale, and rotate them as well. Next well learn about a number of other, more specialized tools that InDesign includes for transforming objects. From there well learn how to fully utilize the transform panel as well as a variety of ways we can duplicate objects. During this course we will learn to view transformations as actions that can be repeated singularly or in a sequence. Well also learn how to transform and fit images within their frames. To wrap things up, well learn how to apply effects to the corners of our objects as well as to the various levels within an object. After completing this course you should have all the knowledge you need to transform any object within InDesign.
