 Game information:
  =================

  Set in the sleepy village of Little Riddle, the main aim of the game  is to
  follow clues to find the guilty party.  Along the way you'll also encounter
  a variety of different and challenging puzzles which help you move  through
  the peaceful world of Little Riddle.

  You play as one of the four members of the Blue Toad Detective Agency. The
  game can be played solo, or with up to three friends.

  As one of the detectives you move around the village by selecting locations
  on the map.  Choose your venue wisely - will  you meet the Doctor  and hear
  his flimsy  alibi?  Or  unearth the  Station Masters  motivation? Each stop
  provides an  opportunity to meet a  different villager and question them on
  the minor misdemeanours taking place in Little Riddle. 
  
  With each step of the investigation a  puzzle is played to help a  villager
  or get further clues about the  case.  But pay attention,  you will also be
  questioned by the Chief  Inspector about events  that take place after each
  chilling incident.

  Whodunnit?  At the end of  each episode you  will be asked  to choose  your
  suspect  before  they  are  revealed  and  exposed in  all  their  criminal
  capacities! 

  Will your powers of deductive thinking and reflective reasoning make you a
  star detective?
