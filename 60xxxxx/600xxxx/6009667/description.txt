december 3rds update, of cables, as wikileaks was down today due to dns shenanigans and the subdomain that hosted the .torrent file wasn't mirrored as well (note to wikileaks: magnet links) , combined with the fact that that torrent that they posted  wasn't actually the the right torrent, I had to comb through the site and figure out which cables were new today, I believe it is just these 3, if you need the rest of them, you can down load yesterdays torrent here
