The Hollywood Reporter's review said about the score:

"The production is a strong one. No one can do this sort of thing like theOops, composer Alexandre Desplat is French. Oh well, in this instance let's make him an honorary Australian."

And Variety's review:

Another repeat collaborator, production designer Eve Stewart, re-creates both royal digs and Logue's wonderfully disheveled atelier, while Alexandre Desplat's score gives the film an appropriate gravitas.
