,Ghw16xxx,2010-12-05T17:53Z,"I've renamed the torrent as ""The King's Speech - Alexandre Desplat"". I hope it will be uploaded now. I'd appreciate feedback. Perhaps someone can provide me with a step by step approach to uploading. Can't shake the feeling that I'm doing something wrong."
,Ghw16xxx,2010-12-05T18:07Z,"That should be ""The King\'s Speech - Alexandre Desplat""."
