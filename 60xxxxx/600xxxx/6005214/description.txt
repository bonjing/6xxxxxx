The Cornwell Estate is a series drawing on Phil Cornwell's early, real-life experiences. It creates an account of life on a fictional housing estate, told from the perspective of four of Phil's creations. 

Each episode follows the fortunes of one of the characters as they negotiate the ups and downs of estate life and battle with authority, ex-wives, old friends, NHS surgeons, record companies, estate busybodies and meals on wheels.

www.comedy.co.uk Review: This was a rather unique radio comedy, in that it was also available in visual form via the red button (see our video section to watch these TV episodes).

Looking back, the series was quite enjoyable with Phil Cornwell showing superb character skills (each week's character was completely different from the last).
