Alex welcomes to the show Joe Seehusen, president and CEO of Liberty Guard. Mr. Seehusen served as the Deputy National Campaign Manager of the Ron Paul 2008 Presidential Campaign Committee, the National Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer of the Libertarian National Committee in Washington DC., and as a senior executive in several for-profit service sector corporations. He will talk with Alex about the FOIA request filed by Bob Barrâ€™s Liberty Guard organization to discover whether the Department of Homeland Security has been keeping tabs on the Drudge Report and other prominent media outlets.

Alex talks with Michael Braverman, the producer of Jesse Venturaâ€™s Conspiracy Theory. 
[1st three-fourths of hour 3]

++[I hope you will listen to Braverman's interview and I'm hoping Ventura's show tomorrow night will be powerful. For what it's worth, I have been personally boycotting all Nestle products for over a year.  
Nestle water brands include: Arrowhead, Calistoga, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Poland Springs, Zephyrhills, Nestle Pure Life, Montclair, Vittel, Acqua Panna, Contrex, Perrier and San Pelligrino.]++

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
