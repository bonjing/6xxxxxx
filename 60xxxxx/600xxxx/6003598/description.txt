Peter Shaffer's magnificant play. Its plot enlarges on Alexander Pushkin's work 'Mozart and Salieri' itself based on rumours recorded in Beethoven's conversation books & current in Vienna at Salieri's death. But this was just the vehicle. Shaffer's great achievement was to conjure up Vienna & Mozart, and to make Mozart's art seem fresh minted.

This is the National Theatre's production. The Criterion Theatre's production used a slightly different version of the text.
