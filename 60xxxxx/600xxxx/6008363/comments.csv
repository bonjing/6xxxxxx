,Arawn13,2010-12-11T19:39Z,Great download until cinavia copy protection kicked in and stopped playback on the ps3. 
,dave412,2010-12-14T07:48Z,"Im new to this whole blu-ray HD rips. But if it says 1920 x 1080 is gonna be in full-screen or will it have the black bars on top and bottom.

I downloaded your Grown Ups rip and that was the same resolution but had no black bars, but this one seems to have them. Thanks"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-14T09:09Z,"Hi, Arawn13. Yes, unfortunately Cinavia protection isn't removable by re-encoding at this present time, and will be apparent with all movies produced or distributed by Sony Pictures from here on, but the movie can still be streamed without issue on a PS3.

Hi, dave412. It will depend on what aspect ratio the movie was filmed in. All of our 1080p/720p releases will have full screen resolutions of 1920x1080, or 1280x720 respectively, because that is a requirement for AVCHD, hence why the letterbox/black bars are added if they are needed. Some screens have a Pan & Scan/Zoom facility, which means you can lose the black bars, but of course, it then means that you are not watching in true 1080p/720p, and that you are losing an area of the video picture on each side of the screen.

I hope this helps."
,dave412,2010-12-14T22:50Z,"Cool Thanks, I had downloaded the Grown Ups and that was full screen and then downloaded this one and it had the letterbox. so i though I got the wrong file or something. Thanks for the help and awesome quality.

Also this .iso format is awesome if anyone needs something so they can play it on their TV get one of these http://www.wdc.com/en/products/homeentertainment/mediaplayers/

Constantin Film verschickt massenhaft Abmahnungen an private Filesharer im Internet und fordert 800 Euro Schadensersatz. Die Telekom und andere ISPs sollen anhand von IP-Adressen die Kundendaten herausgegeben haben."
,yzftat,2011-02-22T00:00Z,This is awesome copy quality wise only problem if burnt to DVD and played on PS3 it mutes sound after 30 minutes or so (stating illegal copy)......gonna have to try different version
,phresh_5,2011-03-11T06:11Z,"To make it work on a PS3, once the cinavia warning comes up....  Goto your time settings and forward your time by 30mins.

Now the file should play again for another 20-30mins.  Then just change the time again by 30mins.  Repeat."
,Kakarot69,2011-03-13T00:04Z,ic people commenting about playing on a ps3 after burning with the sound protection but what about playing on a standard bluray player does the same issue happen?
