Product Description

Learn
The basic concepts of this controversial theory
How string theory builds on physics concepts
The different viewpoints in the field
String theory's physical implications

our plain-English guide to this complex scientific theory

String theory is one of the most complicated sciences being explored today. Not to worry though! This informative guide clearly explains the basics of this hot topic, discusses the theory's hypotheses and predictions, and explores its curious implications. It also presents the critical viewpoints in opposition to string theory so you can draw your own conclusions
Understand the "theory of everything" â€” grasp the key concepts and importance of the theory, and learn why scientists are so excited about finding a theory of quantum gravity
It all comes down to physics â€” discover how string theory is built upon the major scientific developments of the early 20th century
Building the theory â€” trace the creation and development of string theory, discover its predictions, and see whether accurate conclusions can be made
Take string theory for a spin â€” explore the core issue of extra dimensions, the implications for cosmology, and how string theory could explain certain properties of our universe
Boldly go where no one has gone â€” see what string theory has to say about possible parallel universes, the origin and fate of our universe, and the potential for time travel
Hear from the critics â€” listen in on the heated debates about string theory and weigh the alternatives being offered

Open the book and find:
The questions string theory attempts to answer
Easy-to-follow examples
Explanations of Einstein's theory of relativity, quantum theory, and particle physics
The successes and failures of string theory
Fascinating bits of string theory including strings and branes
Ways that string theory can be tested
Discussions of loop quantum gravity and other possible alternative theories of gravity
How the theory may relate to cosmic mysteries, from the origin of matter to black holes
