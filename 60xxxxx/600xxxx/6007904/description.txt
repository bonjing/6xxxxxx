Published cables until Dec 03, 2010. There are 30 more cables in public now, but the Wikileaks domain where they are hosted is not available once more. :(
This dump is from http://cryptome.org since torrents on Wikileaks are down.

They keep uploading new torrents, please switch to those when downloading torrents is working again.
