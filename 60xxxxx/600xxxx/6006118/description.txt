              Get ready to soil your plants! A mob of fun-loving zombies 
              are invading your home, and your only defense is your      
              arsenal of 49 zombie-zapping plants. Use peashooters,      
              wall-nuts, cherry bombs and more to slow down, confuse,    
              weaken and mulchify 26 types of zombies before they can    
              reach your front door. As you battle the fun-dead,         
              obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog and a swimming  
              pool add to the challenge. And with five game modes to     
              dig into, the fun never dies!
