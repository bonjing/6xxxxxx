The Trip 1x01 The Inn At Whitewell HDTV 720p x264 FoV 


Steve and Rob's first stop is the Inn at Whitewell in the beautiful Trough of Bowland.

After a journey where they discuss Rob's hunger, how to write reviews, originality and Steve's landscape-complementing music choices, the pair arrive at the hotel where they are told they will be sharing a room.

Later, during a wine-fuelled lunch, Steve and Rob try to outdo each other with their impressions of Sir Michael Caine, both spanning decades and emotional ranges.
