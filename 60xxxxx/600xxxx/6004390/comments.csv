,wishUluck,2010-12-02T14:49Z,"Nice... three torrents with NL subtitles, none with English ones..."
,Sleppmegin,2010-12-03T03:04Z,"Just as long as its not like that FAKE shit i dl not long ago from the bay, torrent was named:
Devil.2010.DvDRip.SAS_1337__.AVI.5996654.TPB

It played a short clip from the movie then wanted me to BUY a freakin media player !!! called coral player or something ! Assholes who dare up stuff like that &%(

Anyways atleast now thats said, I was unable to find back the torrent here on the bay, it might have been removed by now. (I hope)"
,Sleppmegin,2010-12-03T03:06Z,"Oh and yes, would it kill somebody to bother giving us ENGLISH subs ? Well at least its not half bad since they at least speak English :J"
,Sleppmegin,2010-12-12T01:12Z,"Sucks ! 

It doesn't say shit about the subs being hardcoded.
And quality was quite quite bad imo. About what i would have expected from a 700mb release instead... "
