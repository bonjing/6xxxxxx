In A Myofascial Approach to Thai Massage, the author takes a radically different approach to Thai Massage by redefining the sen lines in myofascial terms. He provides a coherent system illustrating the function and benefits of Thai Massage through its actions on the myofascial network, lymph and blood flow. In addition, the author questions some of the more dubious moves in Thai Massage; looks at the 'spiritual' aspects of Thai Massage in terms of presence, attention and the therapist/client relationship; takes a unique view of Thai Massage and opens the way for further exploration of massage in the myofascial field; and includes some examples of working with clients to illustrate the themes. Although specifically about Thai Massage, content covers many aspects of the therapist/patient relationship - well explored in psychotherapy but surprisingly little covered in massage courses.

To support the therapist:
- the book includes references to anatomy, physiology and therapeutic processes such as neuromuscular technique and covers massage and relaxation and the techniques and relationship skills that make good massage.
- the author has distilled the techniques, discarded what he considers dangerous or disturbing for the patient and concentrated on understanding the techniques and ways of working necessary to promote complete relaxation for the client...................
