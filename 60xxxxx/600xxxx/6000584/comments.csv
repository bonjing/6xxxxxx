I've tried with the add-ons checked and then with the add-ons not checked. 

Any suggestions? Am I the only one with this unexpected roadblock? Thanks in advance.
"
,armenlac,2011-01-21T18:47Z,"OK, its installing now, sorry for the false alarm.

I fixed the issue by copying everything from the USB flash drive to the hard drive and installing from the hard drive instead. I guess there's a bug in the original Adobe installer preventing you installing from a USB flash drive, even if the target is a hard drive.

If I'm successful in getting everything working, I won't post again.

Thanks CyberPiraten."

,gpag1,2011-03-07T01:22Z,"Actually, Games4theworld is wrong about all of CS5 being 64 bit only.

Only two programs in Creative Suite 5 work solely in 64 bit architecture.  Premiere Pro and After Effects. So indeed, you have to have 64-bit to use this torrent, but the other programs in CS5 except Premiere Pro are still supported by 32-bit and 64-bit."

If you want to ublock your host you need to go into your host file and remove them manually. 

I don't rememer the location in my head and i can't check because i'm at my macbook pro atm.  But you can find the location of the host file inside the Activation blocker :) 

@ninjalogical 
Reinstall After effects, install as trial. 
Run activation blocker. 
Run Adfter effects, use a serial. 
You enjoy it. "

Well, it works perfectly, no viruses, malware, or crazy tentacle porn videos. The first time it asks for a serial, I put in the codes, got rejected, got sad, then realized that the ""install as trial"" option was below it...
Victory! Afterwards, it was all smooth sailing from there.

Just a word of advice to all yen'z would-be video editors out there... This program has a learning curve as steep and big as my ego. A few videos on youtube will help you un-fuck yourself though.

Turn internet back on
