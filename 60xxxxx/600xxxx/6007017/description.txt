Talk Talk - Such a Shame [Musikladen 1984].VOB



Very HQ rare "Musikladen" tv show promo performance. "Der Musikladen" (German: the music shop) was a West German music television program that ran from December 13, 1972 to November 29, 1984. The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.

A normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.

"Such a Shame" is a song written by Mark Hollis for the English band Talk Talk's second album It's My Life (1984).

It was released as the album's second single in 1984, and became a big hit in continental Europe in 1984 and 1985, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries, and becoming a number one in certain territories (their second number one single after the remixed version of their song "Talk Talk" which topped the South African charts in 1983); but strangely this single was largely ignored in the UK. In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. "Such a shame" was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.
