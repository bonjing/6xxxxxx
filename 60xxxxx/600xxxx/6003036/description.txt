This is the Star Wars Radio Drama: The Empire Strikes Back, joined together into one chapterized file.  I have edited the intro and outro from the middle episodes, so that the whole thing plays out in one long performance.  The first intro, and final credits remain.

I have formatted the file as a chaperized m4b, or audiobook, so when you drop the file into iTunes, it will appear under books.

Enjoy, seed, and support the publishers!

Thanks!
