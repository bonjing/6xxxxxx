A member of a richaristocratic family, Lara Croft is a "tomb raider"
who enjoys collecting ancient artifacts from ruins of temples, cities, etc. worldwide,
and doesn't mind going through death-defying dangers to get them. She is skilled
in hand-to-hand combat, weapons training, and foreign languages - and does them all
in tight outfits. Well, the planets of the solar system are going into planetary
alignment (Which occurs every 5,000 years), and a secret society called the
Illuminati is seeking an ancient talisman that gives its possessor the ability
to control time. However, they need a certain clock/key to help them in their
search, and they have to find the talisman in one week or wait until the next
planetary alignment to find it again. Lara happens to find that key hidden in
a wall of her mansion. The Illuminati steal it, and Lara gets an old letter
from her deceased father telling her about the society's agenda (Her father
was also the one who hid the key). Now, she must retrieve the key and find and
destroy the talisman before the Illuminati can get their hands on it.
