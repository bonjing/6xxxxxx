Need some professional credits for the end of your latest film?

Windows Movie Maker not looking as professional as you'd hoped?

Credit Maker is a simple but professional program made by an individual who saw a need for such a program. You control fonts, images, and basic layout. Quick and easy render to AVI.

Even though the file is small, that is no reason not to seed! Please do so as long as you can.

Torrent includes .exe installer and readme. Enjoy!
