I know you didn't make the film, but yeah lets get real here. There is no such thing as a teen who is a MILF."
,ponei_rebelde,2010-12-02T02:56Z,i totally agree with Snackrificer
,kimjongwil,2010-12-02T03:04Z,"yea, just like how rambone showed a woman with a machine gun in the jungle on the cover but i don't think she saw any actual combat in real life - or how poke-a-hot-ass showed puritans and native americans, but as far as history can tell, there weren't digital video cameras back then. 

overall tho, i agree, terrible title which is really stretching the definition of Milf to an unacceptable level."
