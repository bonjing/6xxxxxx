,agentgates,2010-12-03T13:13Z,"Hi, thanks for the upload.

Guys, if anybody can contact them please tell them to release those cables first that reveal criminal activities because the only way to decrease the legal pressure on themselves if the public moves to their side.

For instance:
1. The London bombings and MI6 involvement (7-Jul-2005) [multiple murder]

2. The 2006 police rampage in Budapest. Beating and shooting hundreds on street on national day. [crime against humanity]

3. Joerg Haider, Austrian leader car ""accident"" (11-Oct-2008) [murder]

4. The Polish plane crash in Russia (10-Apr-2010), very likely pulled off by the KGB [multiple murder]

To the latter, search on youtube for the following 2 videos:

,TaxDaRich,2010-12-03T15:57Z,"I think that Wikileaks should update their page so that it reflects the current .CH domain name instead of the old .ORG one because there are dead links that point to .ORG ...such as todays (2010-12-03) torrent file...

Today's update is not working (yet)... (If you try to download it you actually download the main Wikileaks page instead of the torrent)

DO NOT FORGET TO SUPPORT THE WKILEAKS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND! There are lots of us who can spare a little money. We supported TPB when they needed it. Now lets show some love to Wikileaks!
