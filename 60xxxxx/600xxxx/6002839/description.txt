Discover is a science magazine that publishes articles about science for 
a general audience. The monthly magazine was launched in October 1980 by 
Time Inc. Discover was originally launched into a burgeoning market for 
science magazines aimed at educated non-professionals, intended to be 
somewhat easier to read than Scientific American but more detailed and 
science oriented than magazines like Popular Science. Discover was left 
largely alone in its market space by the mid-1980s, but nevertheless 
decided to appeal to a wider audience, including more articles on 
psychology and psychiatry.
