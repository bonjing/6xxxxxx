,ggbaird,2010-12-03T10:48Z,@extremezone - what happened to one single file? You never do the 2 cd garbage?
[T],extremezone,2010-12-03T10:54Z,"yeah they messed up with this movie (previous bad ""dvdrip"" sources) and when i see so much spammers/mpaa promoters/retarded comments about an out of sync/pixelated and freezing release(NYDIC encode) giving 10/10 then all my torrent appetite is gone so...will see if same stupid groups will break other movies as they did with this (22.000 downloaders for a bad dvdscr? huston we have a BIG problem)"
,KevMovieMan,2010-12-03T14:01Z,"Hate to be the bearer of bad news though, if this release or any other is too bad for u then u have another option.... wait for the EXTENDED Release due within the next couple of weeks. DIAMOND is usually on the ball with their rips anyway so unless someone is fakin somewhere DIAMOND rips are generally always worth a DL,"
,KevMovieMan,2010-12-03T14:03Z,"@ggbaird 2 CD Files are not garbage, if you can't figure out how to join them with VDub or whatever u shouldn't hate, sometimes when looking for specific movies you'll only find them in that format and will have to make due if you really want it. Joining the files is very easy anyway, use google for step by step help and u'll get it in the 1rst shot."
,nnj,2010-12-04T00:28Z,No need to use a program to join files. Every video player has Playlist capability. Just throw the two files in the playlist and it will jump from 1 to 2 automatically. You might not even notice it.
