,jettj12,2011-08-13T23:37Z,"Pro tip: do a little copy-paste and copy the contents of the ISOs to the hard drive of your pc, then put them in RARs. Saves EVERYONE alot of disk space, and saves seeders alot of bandwidth."

,skiskate,2011-09-30T04:25Z,Im having trouble with this. Some of the files work and are about 4 episodes long each. But the rest of them are unreadable. I cant figure out how to put this on a disk. I have already uploaded over 250 GB so i think it should be working faster now. If anybody knows how to fix this just please please please help me
,superlx,2012-03-06T07:00Z,Please SEED! We're at 97% right now.

,Haru_of_Water,2012-04-29T00:46Z,"To let anyone know these are image copy archives, which if you tried to rar these it would do very little."
,thecole56,2012-06-05T05:16Z,Any chance of getting a seed or two? Thanks
