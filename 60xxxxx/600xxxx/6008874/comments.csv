,sam_smooth,2010-12-06T15:19Z,def. need some seeders for this awesome torrent!!!
,JoeKaneJr,2010-12-06T16:46Z,"The torrent is only two and a half days old, and already people are complaining?

Listen, folks.

This torrent was created on Friday evening. If there's only seeder (that's me), and five hundred of you trying to download it, of course it's going to be slow. Try having some patience."
,JOR23,2010-12-08T07:41Z,"MUY INTERESANTE , SE VE QUE ESTA MUY BUENO , ESPERO QUE SIGAN ALIMENTANDOLO"
,lang10000,2010-12-09T21:09Z,"It's too bad these aren't broken up into smaller groups of languages. Seems sort of a waste of resources to download 20 Gig when you only want one language (Polish advanced, in my case)"
,JoeKaneJr,2010-12-09T23:51Z,"Hi lang10000,

Which programme are you using to download your torrents? Most (or all) of them allow you to download just the files you want. There's simply no need for most people to download the whole 20GB."
,lang10000,2010-12-10T15:11Z,"@JoeKaneJr: Yeah, I figured that out, thanks thouh. Using Transmission, BTW. Still no seeders today :-/ Yesterday I had some decent speed for a while, but now there's no seeder at all, so I'm sitting at 0.0 KiN/s download. I see there are a couple other peers out there that have 90+ percent, but they're not accepting connections."
,JoeKaneJr,2010-12-10T21:01Z,"@lang10000: The list you're looking at doesn't contain everyone in the swarm, just those you're connected to at the moment. 

The people on 93% must be accepting connections because they're all missing the same 7% of files."
,jantrance,2010-12-21T19:07Z,"Thank you so much for uploading!!!

I'll download the whole package even if i only need french. I do this for all others who also want all the other languages!

Happy seeding!!!

Have fun and thanks!"
,jakesender21,2011-02-08T00:51Z,"Je t'aime JoeKaneJr!!!Merci beaucoup.
Ana behibak JoeKaneJr!!!Shokran.
I love JoeKaneJr!!!Thank you very much."
,jakesender21,2011-02-12T03:21Z,"You will always be remembered Joe Kane. Your torrents were the first I downloaded when I decided to learn another language. Your generosity 
will not be in vain. So seed people! Don't make Joe Kane wake up from his sleep and seed this one for us."
,guichtorrent,2011-02-22T16:22Z,"Thanks Joekanejr for this great torrent!

Do you know where can I find these torrents for French native speakers?"
,hookguy,2011-02-25T00:55Z,thanks so much for this!
,Gamaman,2011-03-11T21:56Z,"So cool, and spot on with the commentary at the top, lol! 

H.A. used to run a discussion board for fans of the materials, and when, at the invitation of the moderators, users began putting up better course material than they were coming out with (I'm looking at you Japanese) they shut the site down.

I'll dig through and post what I have from that time.

Think what could have been if Thomas had shared his methods, how different teaching could have been. Maybe he did meet with too much resistance, originally; I may never know.

Thank you for keeping this going. You have done a great service. I'm sorry to hear about Joe Kane 'Sr'. Glad his wishes are being fulfilled."
,Robsond76,2011-05-08T18:42Z,"@JoeKaneJr

I dont comment much around here, a shy pirate i am. But, spetacular torrent, and your efforts are very much appreciated. Cheers to Joe!"
,BigRed777,2011-06-11T19:45Z,"In the infobox it says ""The courses for native French speakers have been moved to a separate torrent."" But i can't find that torrent. Does it really exist?"
,JoeKaneJr,2011-06-25T11:15Z,"@bigred777 Yes, I forgot to create a separate torrent for the Francophone courses. I've had a little hard drive accident here, so there's no possibility of doing it now; but all of the Francophone courses I had, I got from other torrents. Hopefully they're still available for people to download.

@Gamaman I remember the old MT forums well, but I don't remember the Homebrew courses being any good. Maybe I didn't see the superior ones you've described.

@all Thanks for your comments, hope you've all been studying hard!"
,ShadowNix,2011-07-15T19:55Z,Thank you! 8D
,azguy,2011-07-17T07:29Z,"Figures.  TPB acting up right now - not downloading at all.  And I need the vocab and builder courses for German ASAP.  Heh.  

But kudos for this torrent!"
,thegoodcat,2011-08-10T00:04Z,"Can Anyone Seed Please
This is an awesome torrent "
,mister_v,2011-08-29T17:46Z,"Man I am so so grateful for this torrent. Despite not being thus inclined, I would nonetheless consider sleeping with Mr Joe merely to express my gratitude for such a bounty of knowledge. 

Cheers Mr Joe! May you have a thousand sons and may all your wives be nubile, obedient and absolute filth in bed. "
,IWantFreeMedia,2011-12-09T03:44Z,Listened to German Beginner and its good quality. I have just finished German Advanced although the quality is sub par. I will report back on the builder and vocab when i get there. Thanks a lot though! 
,cambulix33,2012-01-21T08:31Z,"The quality of the French, German, Spanish and Italian advanced courses is sub-par because Michel Thomas was a very old man by that point and his voice was fading.

You'll get the same quality if you buy the CDs."
,tpmoita,2012-03-17T06:12Z,"Hi there! First of all, thanks to Joe Kane (both of them). You're the man!

Listen, I've noticed some of the materials have some imprecision. Being a Portuguese native speaker, I'd be willing to hand notes on pronunciation and usage.
I'm also naming all the tracks with all the new words a track contains. And in addition, and this is of course a huge enterprise, I intend to start making review materials from the original courses in GarageBand, just like the available ones in Spanish, French, etc.

Anyone interested in any of this?"
,tpmoita,2012-03-17T17:49Z,"Just one more thing. The review materials would be of all unavailable languages, not just Portuguese (this could take months or more, of course). I'll do it for myself, but if you're interested, I'll start with the most popular ones.
And another bonus: good image quality covers for every course."
