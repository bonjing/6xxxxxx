lol"
,Chainik1989,2010-12-02T02:33Z,Thanks a lot bro!
,asainhooker,2010-12-02T04:39Z,"anyone else think that Chloe might be infected by some sort of ancient virus rather than a virus by the unknown alien race? 
since Rush isn't infected and if memory serves he was take by the aliens before Chloe so it'd be likely he'd be infected too. It seems to me that Chloe knows way to much about the destiny for the virus to be alien. 
I hope the episodes continue to be as good as this one and a few others so far this season I really enjoy this show  "
,zib3ntins,2010-12-02T11:59Z,"Thanks eztv!

I think Chloe is infected by the virus from those aliens that took her. Who knows what are they... My guess is as good as yours. I actually really think that its bad idea for the show that cloe is infected this way... I dont like it. Its played out pretty well, about that leutenants feelings(matt or whatever his name was), but idea itself is pretty awful... Show itself probably only lasts cos of how actors play their roles, sound effects, different pauses between talking and between actions. And stuff like this. The storyline itself seems pretty vague to me..."
,dax15,2010-12-02T14:37Z,"Agree with asainhooker, chloe has definitely got an ancient virus, its too convenient to be an alien one...I cannot stand rush and matt would be just as effective if he stood there and said nothing :) lol I am struggling with universe its very dark...its hard to relate to any of these characters but I do enjoy it! it is the inconvenience of the destiny that makes me put tongue in cheek but then again the show had to progress didnt it....awesome upload excellent quality thanks heaps"
,digimike50,2010-12-04T04:27Z,Many thanks!
,name2long,2010-12-05T00:18Z,"personally, I think this is the deepest stargate yet; researching the evidence of intelligence prior to the formation of the Universe in the form of patterns in background radiation. And then a (real-life) paper is published about background radiation having echoes of things from before the Big Bang potentially embedded within it. Weird!

Thanks for all your high quality uploads, eztv. I wouldn't be able to watch the show otherwise (I have stuff going on on Tuesdays and Fridays, and I haven't gotten around to building a GNU/Linux DVR yetâ€¦ and I'll be damned if I watch the shitty videos on Syfy Rewind or wait 30 days for Hulu to put it up)."
,name2long,2010-12-05T08:04Z,"Incidentally, I think that if it's a virus, it's been genetically engineered by the ship so that it does the changes that an ancient repository would, but sustainably. 

But I don't think it's a virus. I think the ship is altering her DNA directly, and whatever is in Chloe's bloodstream is the method by which it's doing it. The Ancients sent a ship by autopilot 7 billion light years towards the edge of the Universe. Don't you think they could build something so simple as nanomachines?"
[V],def35,2010-12-06T01:20Z,thanks for the upload
,jason16424,2010-12-08T23:28Z,Where is episode 11? why hasn't anyone uploaded last nights episode?
,basiltea,2010-12-09T00:35Z,"For everyone who asked, there was no new episode last night (7 December) and it looks like there won't be a new one until at least January: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286039/episodes"
,jason16424,2010-12-09T07:03Z,"@basiltea

Damn looks like you are correct. 
Thank you for the link, last weeks cliff hanger was killing me x.x 

Geesh, what a wait until we find out what happens!"
,wagnerfx,2010-12-09T20:54Z,"ezvt please tel me stargate universe s02e10 is the last movie?
tvm"
,EpyxZ,2010-12-11T19:11Z,"It is not the Aliens NOR a virus. It is Destiny (well i suppose it could be considered a virus) you have to remember that when they were attacked and her and ely (no idea on spelling) went to the lower part of the ship she got to a certain section and passed out, when she came to her wound from being shot was healed and she was acting fine. 

Destiny needs a Pilot for its mission and is creating one. "
