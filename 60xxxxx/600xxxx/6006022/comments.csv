thanks for sharing man!"
,iShare_,2010-12-02T22:22Z,hey.. there's no seed?
,mite_jan,2010-12-03T02:26Z,"robinhood i want to ask you is this your ""crack"" or someone else
this ""crack"" actually does something it shows you that you have 30 days trial after 30 days are gone
but you can't apply any theme after 30 days 
don't get fooled people this torrent it's same like you've downloaded from windowblinds from stardock (THE CRACK DON'T DO NOTHING - ACTUALLY IT IS NOT A REAL CRACK)
when you install windows blinds and apply this ""crack"" just set your date 30 days forward and try to apply theme and tell me if it works ... let's be honest here Robinhood there is no such thing like crack , patch , signature or whatever for any version of windowsblinds 7
ENJOY YOUR 30 DAYS PEOPLE"
,ekarth22,2010-12-03T04:43Z,"i recommend people to use Aston2, instead of windowsblinds, as Aston2 is less bloated than windowsblind.

,Failure_Is_Not_An_Option,2010-12-03T08:38Z,"Anyway, even if it doesn't work, i will enjoy my 30 days.

Thanks RH."
,mite_jan,2010-12-03T16:10Z,"@Failure_Is_Not_An_Option 
haha Enjoy your 30 days

too bad i have tons of premium themes for windowsblinds which looks marvelous but i can't use them
does anyone knows (if exist) some similar programs so i can import WB themes
if someone succeeded installing WB fully working after those 30 days on WINDOWS 7 64BIT write a note how he did it
only thing i can remember after 30 days passed is change your time in those 30 days which the program was working ...(stupid solution)"

@ekarth22 hmm never heard of Aston but i will try it

,mite_jan,2010-12-03T22:12Z,"i've got an idea but i don't know if this will work
you don't need even cracks or patches for this
install windowblinds 7 and write down the date when you installed it . Use windowblinds till it expires and the day it expires change the date you've installed it
so the only thing you need to do is change your day after every 30 days when it expires
WHAT DO YOU THINK GUYS ? "
[V],RobbingHood,2010-12-04T19:24Z,"@aaryan4

I saw that you started uploading yourself, and left you a good luck message at your BitDefender torrent.

If you would like to have both your arulkarthik account and torrents restored then try asking
for help at the forum. Just explain clearly what happened, and maybe a TPB Mod can help you. 

Good luck"
,morrig,2010-12-05T13:00Z," For all those thinking of the 30 day trial and then set clock back 30 days,think about your security updating and System Restore etc ,it is really not a viable solution.And with Win 7 most of what WB can do is easily replicated with Themes andVisual Styles any way.

[T],SnowCrash05,2010-12-05T19:41Z,Thank you matey!:)
,mite_jan,2010-12-05T23:50Z,"@morrig
are you comparing that Windows theme installer with Windowblinds?
there is no way to compare it and it is also risky patching those dlls
i don't also system restore will get f**ked up becouse when you chose a restore point it tells you what would be the changes so you will remember 
i don't even care for the date on the computer but untill there is real crack i am planing to do that ( after every restart Continue and after every 30 days change the date)
it doesn't work with windows 7 64bit ...for the 32bit i am not sure"
,NerdsterX,2010-12-17T23:08Z,"Here is the working patch for WindowBlinds Public 7.2 [URL=http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6046935/WindowBlinds_7.2_build_297___Trial_Reset_{SnapplerX}]

,Silver--Fox,2011-04-29T03:25Z,"I dunno if I did something wrong or not but I had a total and catastrophic failure of my Windows Explorer thanks to this torrent.

I couldn't open Explorer, I didn't have any menu bars, I couldn't start or end processes, my computer barely functioned until I got a working version of the program thanks to my saved FireFox tabs."
