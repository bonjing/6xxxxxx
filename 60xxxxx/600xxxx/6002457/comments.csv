@spiritualista: Early in the morning I putted one in download queue, but removed afterward, doing the math and seeing that I can't make it on time. Sorry, but I would suggest download of 720p 'cause girls don't deserve less.

@CAPRIKA: I have the last one, ep. 18. I would encode ep.18 during the night and put in tomorrow's TV Pack. Caprica S01E18 Apotheosis:
Daniel, Amanda, and Zoe race to stop Clariceâ€™s master plan and save thousands of lives before Caprica is changed forever."

Have you ever come across the origional Dr. Doolittle?not eddy murphy one . I would like to d/l copy of it if anyone knows where I can find it. hard to explain the great giant sea snail to littles without reference. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-02T08:06Z,"Thanks.

@believenu: Original, good one with Rex Harrison from 1967. is the only one that counts. I have one, but on TPB might be still alive torrent from 2008...

So, you can wait a little or do TPB search - or I can send you links for direct-download for jdownloader (1 GB dual-audio version tough). Send me an e-mail and I will reply, if you want, of course."
,believenu,2010-12-02T14:57Z,thank you so much twentyforty. I will e-mail tonight when littles are asleep so it will be twelve hours or so from now. for others this Dr. doolittle is so cool for kids and nice holiday show . find and seed as well.
