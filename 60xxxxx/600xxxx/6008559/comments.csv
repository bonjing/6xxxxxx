,iippola,2011-01-16T15:02Z,"There IS english DTS audio, russian is default but english IS included as secondary track. Dont be afraid of the filename either :) its legit."
,CamTron118,2011-01-21T20:27Z,"Ahh shit, your right, Iippola. I was pissed because if you play it in VLC, there is one language- English. But it plays the Russian over the English. Tried it in Quick time, and there the two languages both are... I take it back, GoodFilms, I take it back! *Bows*"
