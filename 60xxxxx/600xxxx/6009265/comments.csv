,JUSTlN182,2010-12-04T19:32Z,I just put this up so it'll start off kinda slow cause I'm the only seeder and there's about 200 downloaders..

,castiboy,2011-01-03T15:06Z,"looks okay from those screenshots... though a bit too contrasted (way too bright colors), and specially a bit too compressed: 1.19GB is too small for HD content...

now why did you not include japanese?
i've never watched DBZ in english and i'm not gotta start now :/

thanks anyway...

i wonder why the guys who ripped the 2.18 versions of the first 10 films with multiple audio tracks never did the last 3 D:"
,castiboy,2011-01-03T15:08Z,"about file size, given as it's only 45 min it shouldn't be a big deal (i've only watched the screen captures anyways), but it's still quite a loss in quality since it's coming from blu-ray..."
,JUSTlN182,2011-01-07T01:47Z,"@ castiboy the bright colors is not because of the rip, it was actually the settings on my player when i took the screens.. i forgot to change them"
