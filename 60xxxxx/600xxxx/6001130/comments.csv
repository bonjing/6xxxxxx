,KHaley,2010-12-01T08:52Z,I really want to download Season 3. Do you think it will be fixed soon?
,dlmImagiTECH,2010-12-01T17:37Z,could you please fix this soon.
,dbdragstar,2010-12-03T00:58Z,please seed. i have uploaded 6.7 GB and only downloaded 4.47
,KHaley,2010-12-03T15:25Z,"So I have good news for those who are having trouble downloading this cuz the link is broke. I have Frostwire for downloading music and Vuze for downloading bittorrent. What I did was instead of clicking on the green arrow I clicked on the magnet next to it which made it start downloading it in Frostwire and from there I moved it from my Frostwire library to Vuze where it seemed to download faster. After that I erased it from Frostwire , closed out Frostwire and let it continue to finish downloading with Vuze. Now I have season 3....hope that helps people.  "
,kawmir,2010-12-03T16:18Z,The magnet link works perfectly through uTorrent too for anybody who doesnt use Frostwire or Vuze so i presume it should work through BitTorrent too hope this helps
