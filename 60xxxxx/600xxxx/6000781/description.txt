"Burt Rocks"

Burt gave up on his teenage dreams of being 
a rock star because he was a parent. Jimmy 
feels so guilty for ruining his father's 
dream that he gets Burt a second chance to 
relive his rock fantasy with his music idol, 
Smokey Floyd (guest star Lee), at the 
upcoming Grocery-Palooza concert.

Enjoy :)
