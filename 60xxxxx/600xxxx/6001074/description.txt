Meat Loaf Live in Washington is a great audience recoring. Sound is ok and picture quality is ok but the angle and the show are great. This is from February 1994 and Meat sounds great. The setlist is superb and the band fantastic. If you compare this to Miami and Oslo this one has the best quality. A great treat. Enjoy
