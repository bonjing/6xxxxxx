"Sam Beam is a man who needs no introduction. Over his eight year career he (or rather his stage name Iron & Wine) has reached the point in his career where he is nearly synonymous with the modern folk genre. He plans to change this with his new album â€œKiss Each Other Clean.â€ While 2007â€™s â€œThe Shepherdâ€™s Dogâ€ was a departure from the acoustic styling of his previous two albums, I have the oddest feeling it will be remembered as the â€œBringing It All Back Homeâ€ of Iron & Wineâ€™s career. With â€œKiss Each Other Cleanâ€ Iron & Wine is going electric, and as witnessed by the opening track which was released last Friday [November 26, 2010] itâ€™s going to be fantastic.

The songâ€”â€œWalking Far From Homeâ€â€”has the magnificent lyrics weâ€™ve come to associate with Iron & Wine, but with the added benefit of a polished backing instrumentation rarely seen among most musical acts today. It, much like the previous efforts of Iron & Wine, embodies beauty."
