After ushering in the era of pop-metal with their 1986 blockbuster Slippery When Wet and its hit singles â€œYou Give Love a Bad Name,â€ â€œWanted Dead or Alive,â€ and â€œLiving on a Prayer,â€ Bon Jovi wound up transcending the big-haired â€˜80s, withstanding changes in style and sound to become one of the biggest American rock bands of their time, selling over 120 million albums worldwide, and sustaining their popularity well into the new millennium. As the times changed, so did the bandâ€™s sound. They slowly peeled away the arena rock guitars of the â€˜80s, occasionally scoring on the adult contemporary charts and sometimes singing country music without ever rejecting hard rock, a move that illustrated how they never abandoned their roots and became second only to Bruce Springsteen in defining the sound and spirit of New Jersey rock & roll.
