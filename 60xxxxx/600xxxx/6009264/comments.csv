Ok, The plot was ""borrowed"" from War of the worlds, Body snatchers, Independance day and some other similar movies, but still OK.

There were some questionable moments and some stuff that never gets an answer, but just use your imagination and it is ok.

,benign.psychosis,2010-12-12T08:27Z,"Thanks for the upload. Thought it was going to suck, but it did not. Had good pacing, not too long, not many slow parts, great CGI, pretty women, the guy from scrubs, and organic type alien robots that make you disgusted...

To all of the pseudo intellectuals who complain that it isn't a good movie because it has no plot, doesn't make you think, etc... go read a fucking book in front of someone if you want to pretend to have half a brain. Some people are able to just enjoy an action/cgi movie for what it is and don't feel the need to smoke a cigarette while wearing a beret to talk about artistry and faggotry.

I actually thought the ending was kinda cool - left a slight bad taste in mouth at first, but then turned into a shit eating grin.

I'd be surprised if it wasn't intended to be the prequel for a video game."
,Trexian66,2010-12-12T21:58Z,"@Shraria- No I would go as far as saying 80% of the bad reviews are people that watched 5 mins of it then expressed their opinions or those that did not even watch it and go along with others.

No plot? then i guess Sci fi movies are not for you. Because they are all the same really. Aliens come, aliens try to exterminate. But because the humans did not prevail here you think it has no plot? There will clearly be a skyline 2 if you had not noticed. 
It was done far better than war of the world Plot and film effects.
And when did personal preference become a case of low or high IQ ? 
Not every genre of movie is for everyone and if you like alien invasion movies and did not like this one, i suggest you watch it all this time :)  "

,saph27,2010-12-26T14:20Z,"I hated the ending of this movie so much i came up with my own, here it is:

Right before the big alien ship comes to gobble them up and the US Military is fighting off the intruders, another race of aliens descends upon the planet. This new race, with highly technological advances rather than mostly biological advances of the intruders, come down and start shooting the intruders with lasers and cool shit and blow them up. The intruders are burnt to a crisp just like a ant  under a magnifying glass, and as they fall to the ground they shatter.

The highly technological race that just saved our ass continues to chase off all the invading armies and sets up a perimeter above our atmosphere to defend us of continuous waves of swarms. As they form a grid around our planet, they fire high powered lasers and other weapons that the human mind could never conceive. 

Once the invaders have been completely irradiated they explain to us who they are and that they are peaceful and that they have been at war for centuries with the aliens that attacked our planet. They help us rebuild our planet and offer some of their technology so we too can learn to use it as they have and defend ourselves again if the moment arise. 

We become allies with these ""Protoss"" in order to defend ourselves from the ever advancing ""Zerg""

the end.... Do i hear a sequel???? "

Opinions are not facts. And it would do well to further the image of ones intelligence not to state their opinion as such.

Now I rather enjoyed this movie.  I can handle that there was a lot of unanswered questions.  Even though the ending was rather abrupt and left me feeling disappointed.  I still liked it.   
The over all situation of the movie has an epic feel to it, something that could of been expanded on but was not. Instead it is only filmed from the point of view of a couple of ordinary people trapped in this situation.  If anyone of us where in their shoes I doubt we would have gotten any answers at all and would have been long dead before having the chance to understand what the hell was going on.

Thank you raymondhome for this upload.

subtitle/translation is a bit off

story.... i personally think it sucked

but nevertheless, thank you for uploading and sharing it."
,mw2gam3r,2011-01-29T22:57Z,"loved the movie. i personally like sci-fi. 
anyone played the game Crysis or Crysis Warhead? you know when you have to fight to the alians. if you did you probably know what i mean"
,okeefe58,2011-02-25T13:15Z,"are u babies effing kidding me? as far as movies go, this was a much better than average sci - fi. I think some of you may be spoiled. a bad movie would be something on the sci-fi channel 9 times out of 10, and the low production stuff there. this is not one of those movies. what are you expecting these days. shove your finger in a light socket if you need more. but then again, I'm one of those old guys, ""in my day, we had gumby monsters that moved at 10 fps, AND WE LIKED IT!"" video 10, sound 8, movie 7-8 - much better than some of these comments"
,auracool,2011-03-02T05:52Z,"hell yeah! like the light socket finger comment!
i am a sci-fi/horror fanatic myself and i like the older flicks. just think, the original exorcist movie was banned from lots of places...star wars used to be top notch effects and they used models/puppets, not animatic machines and 3D cgi. suck it, enjoy what you have you spoiled brats, and have a nice day ;-)"
