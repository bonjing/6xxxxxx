,Rilriia,2011-02-27T14:10Z,"ChattChitto, thank you! As always another high quality upload.

The serials work fine. If you're having problems, you're probably making a mistake trying to run them."
,chamee,2011-03-03T16:25Z,"Is this kind of a installer really necessary? My Comodo internet security partially limited it's functionality, and as I ran the setup it wouldn't let install certain files. Ended up dloading another torrent, but thanks anyway!"
,karel43,2011-03-11T13:59Z,As always thanks works always great.
,kneel23,2011-03-26T18:24Z,"look if you are downloading torrents and running some weak gay bloatware security app and then complaining about keygens or installers setting it off, you are a moron and your computer should be taken away from you.
The installer works, and is silly, i agree, not necessary. An install and TXT file suffices.  Also you people actually like the music? its horrible! some guy talking in french. not good at all. anyway at least it is functional thats all that matters.  But yeah horrible music."
,kneel23,2011-03-26T18:28Z,Also a note to anyone who had Winamp 5.+ installed already - you can just use the installer and your current serial number will work - no need to re-register.
,konejo7,2011-07-08T00:48Z,Muy buen trabajo funciona perfecto!!
,Juggalo4Lyf3,2011-10-10T19:02Z,Thanks for this one Chatt. Much appreciated by all.
