Can\\\'t get this one on CD for some reason - their catalog is a mystery to me.  This is a decent record as well Carl Wilson & Michael Love (the Beach Boys), and Peter Cetera (Chicago) sang guest vocals on the track \\\"Vaea (Va-Ya).\\\"  Legendary pop producer Jeff Barry (Neil Diamond, the Archies, the Shangri-Las, the Monkees) made the record - arguably a weird pick, and you can hear it on the record, but I think they were trying to get commercial on this beast.  just make it a billboard for the band in one last-ditch effort for glory.   

this is their second & final record as far as I can tell, and they just started to come into their own on this one.  In the days of labels giving bands sometimes 3 or 4 records before dropping them, it makes me wonder if the band just imploded sometime around then, or if nobody liked them.  If anybody has any insights, I\\\'m vaguely curious.
