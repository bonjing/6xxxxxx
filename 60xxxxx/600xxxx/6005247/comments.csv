,mega_man,2011-02-03T23:23Z,"Correction ""No input file specified."""
,mike18xx2,2011-02-04T11:56Z,"Look at the Seeders and Leechers, and then ask yourself again if you really think it's a problem with the torrent, or a problem on your end."

,nittany,2011-04-01T00:59Z,"excellent torrent, watched 20 episodes or so all work great"
,nittany,2011-04-05T05:51Z,"Had a few problems with some of the episodes, nothing major.  Some of the episodes want to skip/stop playing on my Popcorn Hour A-110 and also in VLC player.  

For example, at the 9:56 sec mark in episode 80 it skips ahead in VLC player and freezes when I play it using my Popcorn Hour.  There are several episodes that do this, but it's not that big of a deal, of the 100 or so episodes I've watched it has happened maybe 6 times or so."
,nittany,2011-04-06T07:32Z,"Forget my previous comment, I forced utorrent to do a recheck and alot of the episodes were only at 99.5% or somewhere around there. That is why I was getting problems with some at certain parts. All fixed now. "

-- There is nothing wrong with this torrent."
,PrincePwn,2011-09-20T04:20Z,The torrent is 404ing for me too.... above poster is a total faggot.
,mike18xx2,2011-10-24T07:32Z,"The problem is with PB's server -- the torrent file is apparently fucked up and un-downloadable because it's sitting on a bad-block on the drive or in a corrupted directory.

-- There is nothing wrong with the torrent itself.

...Google http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6005247/Dragonball_Z_01-291_ENG_JAP_Remastered_UNCUT_DVDrip_H264_VORB_db and DL the same torrent from any of a dozen other torrent sites."

,pjmcmahan,2012-03-04T05:04Z,Can Anyone possibly confirm if this the original English audio or the Funimation dub? Another Torrent had 2 english and 1 Jap track and I was wondering wich english track this file contains?
