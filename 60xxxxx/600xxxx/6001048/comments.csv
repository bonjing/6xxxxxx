Do you usually play HD-vids on your computer? If not, then you might need to download codecs that support HD-material. I use CCCP - Combined Community Codec Pack, which is a bunch of codecs that lets you play HD smoothly, with proper hardware at least =) The codecs get integrated with WMP so thats what I use, works great!"
