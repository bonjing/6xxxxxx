The Big Sleep (1946) Theatrical Release

Director: Howard Hawks

The Big Sleep is a 1946 film noir directed by Howard Hawks, the first film version of Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel of the same name. It stars Humphrey Bogart as detective Philip Marlowe and Lauren Bacall as the female lead in a film about the "process of a criminal investigation, not its results." William Faulkner, Leigh Brackett, and Jules Furthman co-wrote the screenplay.

In 1997, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed this film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant," and added it to the National Film Registry.

1940s Hollywood produced a plethora of stylish, film noir thrillers but, in your humble narratorâ€™s opinion at least, none beat 'The Big Sleep' for overall coolness and entertainment value. The film is based on Raymond Chandlerâ€™s 1939 novel and features his hard-boiled private detective Philip Marlowe (Humphrey Bogart), who becomes caught up in the affairs of aging millionaire General Sternwood and his two beautiful daughters. Hired to investigate who is blackmailing Sternwoodâ€™s younger daughter Carmen over unresolved gambling debts, Marlowe swiftly realizes (as do we) that the whole situation is much more complex than he initially thought.

In terms of plot, this film definitely could make a claim for being one of the most convoluted and bewildering ever written. However we soon realise that the actual storyline is of supreme unimportance. There are lots of deaths, an exciting shoot-out and something about drug addiction and (less overtly!) a pornography racket. But what the film really focuses on is the smouldering chemistry between Marlowe and Vivian Sternwood (a wonderful Lauren Bacall) who is Carmenâ€™s older sister. The innuendo-ridden, wise-cracking dialogue between them works a treat. As the central character, Bogart plays his world weary private eye persona to wryly sardonic, whiskey-drenched perfection. Add a brooding soundtrack by Hollywood legend Max Steiner and unexpected bursts of humour (the number of women throwing themselves at Bogie throughout the film eventually becomes a bit much!) and you have a fabulously escapist, seductively sleazy tale. Go see.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
