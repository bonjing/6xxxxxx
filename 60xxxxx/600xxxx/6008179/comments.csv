,referhead,2010-12-03T17:59Z,is this legit? seems very unlikely that this would be on here already. since it dosent release on dvd till dec 21. and wont air till after that.
,Hilpi75,2010-12-03T18:39Z,"so i guess like the title says, It' a trap!!"

,YxKiLL,2010-12-03T20:33Z,"It was announced in March 2009 that the cast of the show had read through an early draft of the script under the working title, Episode VI: The Great Muppet Caper. The second working title, We Have a Bad Feeling About This, was a reference to the recurring catchphrase that is used in the Star Wars films. The settled-upon title is a reference to the line by Admiral Ackbar in the film, which became an Internet meme."

,Melbournian,2010-12-14T10:33Z,"Yes, this is legit."
,wordofpass,2010-12-15T15:49Z,"@ Danford

Because if VLC can't read a file properly it has a habit of showing another file. (Hence why any file name *.!ut will play Toy Story 2 for me, which is bizirre.)"
,gnetix,2010-12-19T20:32Z,"Yep, real deal! Good quality too. Thanks YxKill!!!!!"
,Joey_the_Lemur,2010-12-21T06:43Z,"Video quality is 90% out of 100. Surely watching it on Fox on Demand will make the quality 100%, but I sure as hell am not gonna quibble about an insignificant loss in quality. Well, done, YxKiLL!"
