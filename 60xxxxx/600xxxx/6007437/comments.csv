DO NOT USE: Updates modem firmware to an unlockable 05:15:04""

look at the photo in this torrent as a proof. look at the modem firmware. it said 05.11.07. do you have any idea what that firmware version was originally for? 05.11.07 was originally for firmware 3.1.2. does that look like my iphone modem baseband had been updated?

,bigdaddyelove69us,2010-12-04T14:59Z,can you make one for iphone 3g
,bambong,2010-12-04T16:35Z,"yeah, IPhone 3G would be nice...."
,Fallen_Gri,2010-12-18T08:08Z,will this work with 6.15 BB?
,imheliocentric,2010-12-23T13:00Z,"can only be used if you have the GS Old Boot Rom; if you have BB 6.15 then using this firmware would be moot -- damage already done. The whole purpose of this firmware is to NOT have to upgrade Baseband while upgrading firmware, only capable on the 3GS Old Boot Rom model. "
,schuaa,2011-01-16T00:06Z,"After a little work I was able to install the new firmware, but now I am having a lot of trouble updating Cydia. It keeps crashing on me. Any advice? I already updated the folder using DiskAid."
,schuaa,2011-01-16T11:14Z,Never mind. Just don't use DiskAid. Use WinSCP to update Cydia.
,artem89,2011-01-19T12:37Z,"Hi, I had a problem with my Iphone 3GS with BB 6.15.00, error 1015, it was stuck in recovery mode so I tried to restore with this one, just downloaded it and placed in C:\Users\Your user name\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPhone Software Updates, (under Windows7) renamed it like original FW, put Iphone in DFU mode launched the Redsn0w 0.9.6rc8 chosed the original apple FW 4.2.1 and after just clicked on ""Pwned DFU mode"", turned iTunes on and clicked on ""recover"". And done with no prob but when Iphone starts Cydia doesn't work. For that I restared Redsn0w mentioned before, chosed original apple FW clicked on Install Cydia, put Iphone in DFU mode and it's works.
Accualy Redsn0w says that your Iphone is tethered but with this custom FW it's not, you'll get a fully untethered jailbreaked Iphone 3GS !!! 
Ultrasn0w 1.2 which you can find on Cydia unlock BB 6.15.00 well. Maybe this can help someone :)"
