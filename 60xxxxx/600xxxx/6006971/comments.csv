I saw your contributions, two cheesy repacked games, wow, don't waste your time or ours."
[V],big_dad_e,2011-03-21T04:50Z,"These rips are made with burning to DVD in mind which is why they are larger file size and @320 kbps audio, not to be viewed on a bugged machine with a cheesy player and outdated codecs.  The avi container is good compression w/o loss and Regional friendly."
,Cacknoob,2011-04-17T03:25Z,is this the extended version ?
,k0no,2011-05-22T12:12Z,"i can back the other guy up:

for a 3GB file, the video quality is dreadful.

just by comparison, i get roughly the same quality from a 700-900mb file. this film has probably been compressed at some point.

the film is great, but 3GB for such a lossy video file is not great."
,k0no,2011-05-22T12:14Z,"oh and just for context - i'm running a high end machine, with latest 64bit operating system, latest video codecs, massive GFX card with up to date drivers for everything. on a 30 inch HD screen.

trust me, if the quality is suspect, i can tell. it's not anything to do with my computer or anything else."
