Synopsis
Antoine, an unsuccessful writer, is taken aback when his girlfriend, Solange, leaves him for another man.  Usually, it is he who ends a relationship, not his partner.  In a fit of pique, he decides to take his revenge, not against Solange, but against all womankind.  Jean, an ageing book dealer, suggests that Antoine should avenge his wounded male pride by seducing a woman selected at random and then, once she is in love with him, coldly dumping her.  He should also keep a diary of everything that happens in this adventure, since, Jean assures him, such a chronicle would be well-received by one of his publishing friends.  To lure his victim, Antoine places an ad for a secretary to type a manuscript.  The woman who responds to the ad is a rather ordinary looking young woman, Catherine, who lives alone in a small apartment.  Frustratingly, Catherine apparently has no interest in Antoine and resists his obvious attempts at seduction.  Antoine is certain his scheme is going to fail...

Film Review
Christian Vincent won critical acclaim for this, his first full-length film, which takes a subtle and intensely ironic look at the psychology and politics of the male-female relationship.  At first sight, La DiscrÃ¨te resembles the films of Eric Rohmer, a director who continues to exert an influence over other French film directors, Vincent included.  The characters in the film reveal themselves more by what they say than what they do, and their experiences constitute an allegory or moral tale, something which prompts us to reflect on both the perversity and generosity of human nature.  

Vincentâ€™s films have some of the poetry, wit and insight of Rohmerâ€™s films but generally lack the spontaneity, and they are also more melancholic, introspective works â€“ not that that is in any way a bad thing.  

Vincentâ€™s lead actors, Fabrice Luchini and Judith Henry, work together perfectly, bringing out every scintilla of irony in the filmâ€™s well-crafted script.  Luchini has a particular penchant for playing self-obsessed intellectuals and is perfectly cast as a latter day Don Juan who is laughably oblivious to his own failings.  Henryâ€™s character is no less interesting and the young actress â€“ who was comparatively unknown at the time â€“ brings a complexity to the part which contributes greatly to the filmâ€™s depth and humanity.

As is typical of French drama, the film unfolds slowly, is heavy on dialogue, and uses shades of ambiguity to prevent us from seeing too much too soon.  For those who can appreciate this style of intelligent, understated drama, La DiscrÃ¨te offers both a rewarding and thought-provoking cinematic experience.   For a first film, its director shows an extraordinary degree of maturity and self-restraint, masterfully gaining his audienceâ€™s emotional involvement and delighting them with a tale which is as entertaining as it is poignant. 

La DiscrÃ¨te was one of the most highly nominated films at the 1991 CÃ©sars Awards Ceremony.  There, it garnered no less than three awards â€“ for the Best First Original Work, for the Best Script and for the Most Promising Actress (Judith Henry).  The film also won the FIPRESCI Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1990.
