Andy Irons
Andy has been under a lot of scrutiny since his return to the world tour this year. All we can say is when you watch his part in High Five, youâ€™ll be reminded of why he is and always will be one of the worldâ€™s most radical surfers.

Wade Goodall
We canâ€™t get enough of his shredding so we sent our camera-dogs after him. When you see some of the stuff heâ€™s got, youâ€™re gonna hope heâ€™s already signed on for High 5 The Sequel. But letâ€™s take it one step at a time here and see why his peers call him one of the best freesurfers on earth.

Eric Geiselman
If we donâ€™t say so ourselves, this is Ericâ€™s first proper video part. Heâ€™s one of the first guys to have flips and Kerruptâ€™s on lock, and he bangs out more than his fair share of advanced and impossible-looking tricks. Call this Ericâ€™s coming out part(y), even though heâ€™s already been in the game for years.

Fergal Smith
The Youtube sensation is our dark horse. We basically let him film the whole winter in his own backyard and didnâ€™t see any footage until it was all compiled. We were blown away by some of the slabs this knight tames, and you will be too when you see him from the inside and outside of some mean cold north Atlantic drainers.

Andrew Doheny
Is Andrew aka â€œDroidâ€ Americaâ€™s next surf superstar? Yes, thatâ€™s why weâ€™re giving him the opening section of High Five, and thatâ€™s why every surf magazine and filmer is on his nuts right now. In the past youâ€™ve only gotten a taste of what this kid is capable of, now youâ€™re gonna see the whole story of a kid transitioning from grom to full-blown man-shredder.
