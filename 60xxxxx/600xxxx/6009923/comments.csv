It came out perfect for me.  I suggest you download it again."
,erroneus,2010-12-05T12:43Z,"I downloaded the other one instead.  I have never had a torrent get THAT corrupted before.  Perhaps there was a seeder that was interfering, but usually, those get detected and booted.  When the download completed, it ""verified"" just fine.  

Anyway, I wonder who I could ask to capture these episodes not on ""first airing"" but later when they don't have all that ""cartoon network"" crap all over it?  It's fine to have the first/fastest release, but I would prefer the cleanest/best release."

This is the 720p version, it has higher definition that the 175mb version ... so it will kick ass in your screen, i highly recommend trying this one, you wont go back to 175mb clone wars downloads :) "

They had less cartoon network spam and somehow showed more wide screen. But the audio was always bad. Anyone know? "
