mattyboi1995 NOTES
I made a small script to re-size and sharpen then i dropped into vdubmod. In vdubmod i increased the contrast, saturation & brightness. I then added a de-noise filter on a low setting, after that i slightly changed the colours with a RGB EQ. I done a 2 pass encoded. Finaly i Muxed imagines line audio.
