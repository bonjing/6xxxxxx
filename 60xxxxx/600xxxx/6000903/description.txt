      The following video is a look into my private practice of my religious freedom which is my endowment from my Creator defined in the â€œDeclaration of Independenceâ€. Religious freedom is the primary endowment in the â€œDeclaration of Independenceâ€. â€œThe American Church of Religious Freedomâ€ is the name of my church and Cannabis is my sacrament for life.
        I  believe that Cannabis  is the temple of God in the plant kingdom and I believe that Jesus dwells in Cannabis and communicates through the THC neurotransmitter 	

     American freedom through the religion defined in the Declaration of Independence,; I have called this religion"The American Church of Religious Freedom" (http://www.theamericanchurchofreligiousfreedom.com). The primary freedom given by God in his endowment is religious freedom and whatever lifestyle a citizen has is their religion. There are no rules in the Church because all members will live by the basic rule of right and wrong. What helps humans is good; what hurts humans is evil. All citizens by their citizenship will stop evil and promote good will. Cannabis is the most holy of all plants because it is the temple of God in the plant kingdom Jesus dwells in cannabis and communicates through the THC neurotransmitter to neuroreceptors in all vertebrates, Cannabis protein is the only complete protein in all of the plant kingdom and so it is the same protein as meat protein. Cannabis protein is the "body of Jesus" that all humans should eat as their meat so their bodies can become as God's body is. You may download my video here:
