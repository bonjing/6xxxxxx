If anybody is unhappy with someone else's happiness when that happiness speaks for a better way of humanity getting along, then guess who is the asshole. All I've got to say to that type of negative, self-centered, anti-freedom consciousness - Be happy and you will be well. Oh yeah - and smoke some reefer and chill out."
[T],FaeGiN,2011-02-09T09:30Z,"Wow. The ONLY reason this has been downloaded so often is simply that it has cannabis in the title and, for me especially, the title seems so damned outrageous!
HOWEVER: This is an absolute piece of fucking garbage. It begins with some real shit quality (A webcam, one of those cheap shit ones that takes pictures consecutively, so not actual motion, more like old animation or jumpy annoying cheapo webcam!) and all you see in front of this fucking cam is a weird looking waster kind of dude. What you might call a hippie. But this one looks burned out. He says NOTHING of any worth. Nothing inspiring or beautiful, interesting or thought provoking.
He basically sits there on his ass getting stoned, coughing like he has some kind of Dickensian 'ague' and we are somehow supposed to be interested in this?! (His coughing is just pure disgusting...yuk)
This opening sequence literally lasts over 20minutes. Nothing happening except what I just described. The guy isn't even easy on the eyes so this is hard to watch...
Then when he DOES start talking finally ... woooah! I never heard such fucking stupid, fantasy shit in my life!
This guy believes he talks to god and jesus and erm aliens and erm... he smokes pot. a lot. All the time. Let me clarify here though - I usually might find this kind of guy funny or interesting but this guy, he has no redeeming factor like 'interesting' ... he really is just sitting looking into the camera talking bollocks and not a funny talking bollocks, no way, just pure bollocks.
He is a fucktard.
You want to watch this 'movie'?
This is like a youtube vid of some stoner hippie twat trying to get attentiopn, but instead of a 10min yt clip, he decided to opt for the feature length, con trick of entitling it as if it was a real movie.
It isn't.
If it was I would decide here and now never to watch another movie in my life.
thankfully its only one sad hippie cunt. I can avoid that easily enough.
:)
Hey timelyone FUCK YOU for making this piece of shit and FUCK you for your pathetic attention seeking.
AVOID!

[T],timelyone,2011-02-25T01:46Z,"To FaeGiN - Sounds like you have issues. Why did you bother watching my video? In the beginning I let everyone know what to expect. Obviously you are one of those unhappy people that don't get high. Your unhappiness is written all over your comment. Obviously you are jealous of my joy. The reason I put this video out on the internet is because I know that what I have to say needs to be heard. It really irks fools who are ruled by their own foolish thinking, to see someone who is not fooled. I am free of all of the bullshit that rules you. It is the bullshit that rules you and your fellow unhappy people that I expose in my video. I am 67 years old, have had a Master's Degree since 1968 and have had more experiences on the streets of life than you could even imagine. As the primary witness to the UFO phenomena described as the ""Phoenix Lights"" I am known worldwide in the UFO community and my sighting has been verified as recently as February 2010 in the National Geographic Channel TV special titled ""UFOs Over Phoenix"". 
   I am not looking to change anybody's mind about anything. I am just going to be truthful about the most important thing of all - the existence and reality of God as the basis for our lives within the context of the Declaration of Independence. According to that document our entire democracy rests on the belief that God created us and God endowed us with ""certain unalienable rights"". If you say you donâ€™t believe in God then you disavow your unalienable rights which are tied to the endowment of the CREATOR. If you do believe in God then you should pay attention to my video because it is showing you the proper attitude to have towards God and towards your own freedom."
[T],timelyone,2011-02-25T01:47Z,To FaeGiN - fuck you very much for your comment
