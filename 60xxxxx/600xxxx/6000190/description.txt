Source IFLIX

thx

Video: 688x400 @bitrate 1400 2pass

Audio: AC3 2.0 Stereo

Sample: Yes included

Encode: this is a PPV thats not 4:3, but quality is not as nice as all previous that were 4:3. 

little unsharp but still a lot better than the dark cam thats out a while and stereo audio. 

its watchable

will do till the R5

watch sample before you make a comment

corrected aspect, tried 702x something but looked odd so i tried it with 688 now the heads are right.

added sharpness,brightness,chroma and corrected some rgb colours. cleaned audio from hum,hiss and noise as best as possible

enjoy
