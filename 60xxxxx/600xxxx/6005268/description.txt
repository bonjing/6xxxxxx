VMware Workstation v7.1.3-324285

VMware Workstation - a program that is designed for workstations, enables a computer to emulate a standalone working environment of the operating system and work with him as with the conventional system. Using this method you can install different operating systems and applications for them, go online and engage in daily tasks, but with somewhat slower speeds. The benefit of this method is the ability to test various software under various operating systems, while not causing harm to the current system, installed on my main computer, as well as some test hardware solutions.
