In Tantric Sex for Busy Couples, Diana Daffner offers readers a modern approach to intimacy based on ancient techniques. Combining age-old tantric teachings, the peaceful exercise program of tâ€™ai chi, and meditation, the book shows couples how to energize their relationship. The basic exercises include â€œSolo Stillness,â€ which helps readers embrace the inner self; â€œConnected Pose,â€ a way for couples to simply be together; and the â€œTantra T'ai Chi Trilogy,â€ a tri-partite system for moving sexual energy throughout the body. 


The author's foundational tantra t'ai chi exercises help readers prepare for the sexual practices described in the book, with things like yin and yang ceremonies of sexual massage for both partners and â€œPeaceful Passionâ€ â€” a sexual union that requires neither a high sex drive nor a Viagra-inspired erection. Throughout these practices, readers are encouraged to maintain a sacred, respectful, loving, and ceremonial attitude toward their partner and, in the process, transform a relationship into a love affair........................
