JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS (1963)


Jason and the Argonauts is a prime showcase for Harryhausen\\\'s talent, it is a colorful adventure that takes full advantage of Harryhausen\\\'s \\\"Dynarama\\\" process. Inspired by the Greek myth, the story begins when the fearless explorer Jason (Todd Armstrong) returns to the kingdom of Thessaly to make his rightful claim to the throne, but the gods proclaim that he must first find the magical Golden Fleece. Consulting Hera, the queen of gods, Jason recruits the brave Argonauts to crew his ship, and they embark on their eventful journey. Along the way they encounter a variety of mythic creatures, including the 100-foot bronze god Talos, the batlike Harpies, the seven-headed reptilian Hydra, and an army of skeletons wielding sword and shield.
