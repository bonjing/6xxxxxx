David Quantick presents a lighthearted guide to music, in which not every fact is a truth.

In the first two series The Blagger's Guide aimed to provide an encyclopaedia guide to rock and pop. 
Entries on artists, movements and places as diverse as Sheffield, Folk, Stadium Rock, Stax and Madonna all featured.

The third series switched to looking at The Classics - Beethoven, Bach, Tchaikovsky and music of that ilk.

Series four, lengthened to eight episodes, returned to the topics of rock and pop. 

Series five David Quantick looked to teach us more about Country music.

Series six David Quantick looks at the mystical, magical and misunderstood world of jazz

ww.comedy.org Review: [quote]It's hard to describe Quantick's presenting style, we guess we'll have to settle for calling it 'unique', but in a good way. 
He has a fantastic way with words that makes any topic interesting (even classical music)![/quote]
