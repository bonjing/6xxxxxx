Genre: Documentary


Description:
Mary Rodwell is Australias leading authority on extraterrestrial 
phenomena, her son Chris Rodwell is a vet, a man of science and 
self-confessed alien skeptic  their relationship has reached a critical 
point and something has to give.

Marys beliefs led to the breakdown of her marriage and left a 
teenage Chris with some emotional scars, so the topic comes with 
baggage. Packing nothing but an open mind, Chris has agreed to 
enter Marys world via a road trip traversing Australia in order for her 
to attempt to convince him that the truth really is "out there" and 
that aliens exist, or she must never discuss the subject with him 
again.

Mary plans to leave no stone unturned in her efforts to convince 
Chris. They will meet a host of colorful characters from alien 
contactees to skeptical scientists. They will take part in a heated 
debate with university professors, put key witnesses under pressure 
with polygraph tests and scour the country for concrete evidence of 
extraterrestrial life.

Along the way they will argue until they are blue in the face about 
who is right, and for Mary, this really is her last chance to prove to 
Chris that she hasnt gone loopy and that there really are other 
beings in the sky above. This is the search for the truth to save a 
relationship.
