,paragua,2010-12-01T21:36Z,does the rock Band microphone works with this game?
,sikci,2010-12-01T22:00Z,"question is whether your mic works with PS2 usb mic input module. dunno dude, but question isn't game dependent."
,mrhas1984,2010-12-14T19:36Z,"hi there,

i'm probably missing something really obvious here, but i can't patch these iso files with esr patcher to use on a PS2 with FreeMCboot

esr patcher just shows some udf error and is unable to patch, the discs won't work on the ps2 with freemcboot without being patched

does anyone know what i should do?"
,sikci,2010-12-16T16:06Z,"*mrhas1984: i'm not familiar with FreeMCboot but if u try to patch this ""isos"" remember, they are actually .daa files renamed to .iso because of TPB upload error. So if your procedure works on other real isos, than: 1. rename this files to .daa suffix, 2. open in poweriso, 3. convert to real .iso and than try to patch. Hope it helps."
,drcangrena,2010-12-21T22:47Z,"hi, 
why i can't burn images to disk, it show's me that :""The file format is invalid od unsupported"".
i've tried burn with nero, imgburn, poweriso.
can anyone help me pls?"
,sikci,2010-12-22T22:03Z,*drcangrena: As mentioned in description these files were renamed to .iso because TPB doesn't support .daa suffix files. Rename those .iso files to .daa than burn with poweriso. You can burn this isos or .daa files only with poweriso!
,mr_mufy,2011-07-15T17:21Z,"Hi.

I have to say that, changing the Extension of the ISO files to .daa not mater.

the only thing needed to work this files with the ESR it's the convertion.

So if you need to play this files with the ESR patcher, you need to convert them to and ISO files Valid.

Attention: No just save like an iso file, but a conversion."

,olimpas83,2012-02-10T18:29Z,"Anyone can post is it works, cause for me 1 iso not working then i converted, :("
