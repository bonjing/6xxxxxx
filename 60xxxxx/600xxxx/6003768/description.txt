Intrepidarchaeologist Lara Croft has made perhaps the most
important archaeological discovery in history: an orb that leads to the
mythical Pandora's Box. Unfortunately, the orb falls into the hands of
Jonathan Reiss, an evil scientist who deals in killer viruses and hopes
to sell the secrets of the box as the ultimate weapon. Recruited byIntelligence to get the orb back from Reiss, Lara recruits
Terry Sheridan, amarine turned mercenary (and her former love interest)
to help. The two embark on an adventure that spans continents in an
attempt to regain the orb...
