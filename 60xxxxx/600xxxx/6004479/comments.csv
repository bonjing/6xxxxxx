ty

OFF-TOPIC : my fav bollywood movie would be... Rang de basanti (very brilliantly done) & DEV D (i'm very serious here... ) ;)
3 idiots was good... but it'd hav been better if they made it like original book IMO (5 point someone) ... waitin for ""3 mistakes of my life"" movie adaptation .. thats my fav chetan bhagat's book.. :D"
,DSIN,2010-12-02T10:10Z,LOL prashant : he is very indian iam sure :)

,jarman007,2010-12-02T10:45Z,"@prashant
i think i told u once
i am from delhi

@dsin
what do u mean by ""very indian"""
,akindayimcan,2010-12-02T11:09Z,"just checked SS and sample great quality as usual...

@prashant22

can u write your next 3 or 5 uploads if it is possible...because i always waiting your rips and i want to learn what i am waiting for :)="
,DSIN,2010-12-02T11:21Z,^ kinda like indian to the core  :D
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T11:38Z,"@jarman
sorry dude i must hv forgot..

@akind
i dont know exactly what will be coming next
bt after 3 idiots it will be step up 1(2006)

also i didnt like the quality of this one so i will re do it...i tried encoding it 2 times and i didnt liked the quality..so i will do this one with bigger size aroung 1.1 or 1.2gb...."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T12:13Z,"@mzk
I didn't said that..I said that if I'll do a 1080p then my pc will go boom..
3 idiots, avatar, titanic r some movies which I'll do in 720p despite there length...in which avatar will be very hard to do because of its resolution...

In my list there is red cliff its also 3hrs bt I'll do that one in 480p..it will take much less time.."
,DSIN,2010-12-02T12:25Z,"LOL mzk ... not me...i only see very good lookin(in terms of plot) movies...& 3 idiots was the last bollywood movie i watched :D
(yes i haven't watched a single bolly movie this year) LOL

@prashant : thanx for not cutting credits man... :D u haven't done that in ages now...
very much appreciated... :D"
,sup3xtian,2010-12-02T14:04Z,"hope your release of 3 idiots dont have any watermark or something on the screen coz Riddlera release have, just hoping you dont have different source, 

anyway, im starting to like your uploads specially with your 5.1 audio channel. More powers :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T14:44Z,"@DSIN
ya it has become a habbit now..

@sup3xtian
just checked riddlera's sample...r u talking abt the ""DDR"" that comes up for 2-3 secs...
well sorry to say bt my source is also ddr's release...
bt there is nothing to worry because that watermark is just for 2-3 sec..."
,jarman007,2010-12-02T15:15Z,"@prashant

what software do you use for encoding"
,himansu_007,2010-12-02T17:21Z,"Yeah remove where not necessary but intact where necessary like iron man2 or any movie with extra shoot

if its saves much space...
Rest is up 2 u... "
,sup3xtian,2010-12-02T17:46Z,"aw men, thats all i can say :D, well just keep the 5.1 audio channel comin. Cheers."
,DSIN,2010-12-02T18:01Z,"My vote is for keeping the credits... many ppl want to keep complete movie (including credits).. for collection.. & acc. to me credits r very important.. 
& prashant rips r superb quality... same as (if not better than) kickass... so y giv ppl a reason not to dload .. ? & 50 mb really means nuthin in a gb movie :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T18:21Z,"@jarman
megui..

@mzk
fear and loathing in las vegas coming soon...

abt the end credits there were a lot of people asking to keep them on on demonoid, ahashare and here also...so i will be keeping them...even scorp has also started to keep them i think the reason must be the same as mine...
end credits only save 20-30mb of space..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T18:23Z,"@all
i will be doing this movie again i hv already got two -ve points for this..nd i m personally nt satisfied with the quality...its nt good...
"
,prank0007,2010-12-02T18:46Z,"An Ultimate Dance Off.......Movie
surely not to be missed


I go with @DSIN to keep credits.like for eg i found many songs used in this step up 3 movie weren't on the soundtrack too.got thru credits only.got somewhat from google but not all.
some hav extra footage or so...if not a big loss is happening then its ok to keep credits...:)"
,prank0007,2010-12-02T18:59Z,"i hav dl many rips of step up 3 from others too.urs is still in middle.....
In many rips dance scenes(crowd/fast moving sequence) r blurry n normal scenes luks HQ.
except a 480p rip of Dita496(1337x) also on tpb is best....of 1.82 gb rather than goin for more higher size"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-02T19:50Z,"@prank
ya bt i m sure 1.2 gb will do good...this rip of mine is nt that bad the dance scenes r good...bt nt satisfying.."
,dr_pritam2006,2010-12-03T12:29Z,"@prashant

,DSIN,2010-12-03T12:54Z,"^ its taking a lot out of me to not rant abt ""how bad watching hindi dub is ?"" & that ""dual audio is nuthin but waste of 100-150 extra mb"" :-X "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-03T13:07Z,"@dr_pritam2006
