The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.   
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark  
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root  
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and       
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do   
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene  
started in the mid eighties.                                   

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back  
n contacting us as soon as possible.                         


twice the fun   / double the trouble
