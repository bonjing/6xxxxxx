Ally (Emmanuelle Vaugier) is a smart young career woman who needs a
new job. Samantha (Cynthia Gibb) is a busy Beverly Hills advertising
executive/mom whose too-well-mannered kids need some fun in their lives.
And Danny Donner (Dean Cain) is the tough-guy owner of a chocolate
company who wants a major ad campaign immediately. Could it all
somehow lead to the Christmas that changes everyone's lives forever?
Richard Ruccolo, Sierra McCormick, Jared Gilmore and Sarah Thompson
co-star in this surprising comedy about little white lies, big holiday
wishes, and a woman who may just find love in the most unexpected
places by becoming A NANNY FOR CHRISTMAS.
