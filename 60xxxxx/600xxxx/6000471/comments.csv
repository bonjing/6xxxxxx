Looks like a possible cam?
Thanks though!"
,dthompson2692,2010-12-01T09:22Z,I skimmed through the movie. I think that the audio is okay. The picture quality is acceptable. The audio is in sync so its still okay to me. Its better than a cam and would be worth downloading if you really wanna see it. My vote is A8 V7
