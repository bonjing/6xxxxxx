,amr_elawwam,2011-09-15T10:58Z,can someone confirm serials are working ?
[T],armadillo1984,2011-12-29T14:14Z,"amr_elawwam, the serial work for me. If none of the serial works for you, try to obtain one in www_serials_ws.

yerisan710, the idea of this program is to portabilize any software. For example: if in your work you not have administrative rights in your PC, you cannot install any software. The portabilized software do not need administrative rights and is packed in one single file. Because this, if you not have admin rights, you can run any portabilized software, and because is packed in one single file, it can run from any media (hdd, usb pen drive, cdrom). "
