Family Guy was always in the crapper, it is at least watchable.  Some episodes i've seen are great too, it's just too many of them are not funny for me at all.  Although I do like American Dad, which has made some great stuff.    

I've watched the first 2 so I want to finish the star wars thing off.  

Perhaps someone whom isnt an ass clown could recommend some of the best episodes and restore my faith in family guy.  

I'll check back on this comment thread over the next few weeks.  C if anyone can give me some guidance and not too many insults.  "

,nikawat,2010-12-19T04:04Z,ya family guy is boring now the first season was good but from there it went down hill fast
,kelv1969,2010-12-20T22:38Z,"I used to like Family Guy a lot, but must admit that Peter Griffin's character is just too annoying now. I prefer the episodes that concentrate on Brian and Stewie. I think Seth should have done a 'spin off' with those two in a weird alternate dimension, instead of that Cleveland Show crap! Who wants to see a load of cartoon black people in a sitcom? It's like a cartoon version of the cosby show. Bloomin awful."
