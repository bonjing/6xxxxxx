,sexpanther,2010-12-04T22:03Z,"I'm with Mcluvin75 - can't get this to work.

Now it's entirely possible that I'm just retarded when it comes to the 7z archives, but it seems that no matter what I try to extract I'm coming up empty.

Is it me or is it the upload?"
,narfdude,2010-12-04T23:34Z,update your winrar or get 7-zip beta.
,sexpanther,2010-12-05T06:07Z,"yep, i'm a tard - updated to the most current 7zip and extracted no problem - thanks!

and thanks for the up!"
