,johnnyapplec,2010-12-03T12:46Z,How can we insert chapters using your script?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-03T23:04Z,magically!  Trying to make life better for ATV2 users.
,Cespur,2010-12-04T01:01Z,"HR, you don't know how much I appreciate you including the chapters into the movie. Thank you so much!"
,ultimagic,2010-12-04T10:36Z,"hey dude, how did you insert metadata. i use metax but it doesn't have purchased date and purchased by."
,Cespur,2010-12-04T13:19Z,"MetaX is slow and buggy, use Subler. It's fast, easy to use and has more option than MetaX. Saving the new file only takes about 2 seconds, instead of the 5 minutes of MetaX."
,zefjan,2010-12-06T02:26Z,Great rip like usual. But this movie has cinavia not payable on the Ps3. Streaming and downloading to the HD do not work. Any ideas?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-06T07:28Z,"watch on pc, xbox 360, popcorn hour, apple tv, wdtv."

Thank you for the amazing work !
It's great to have MP4 / M4V files that can work directly in iTunes for the Apple TV (2nd generation).
Just one problem: your movies take forever to load on my Apple TV, and I am talking minutes, like 5 or 10 minutes, while all my other files (including HD 720p large file movies) work perfectly and right away. Can you think of any reason ? Any special settings ? I have a good high speed wifi connection, and again, all my other files (converted with handbrake or airvideo, or even other large mp4 downloads) work great. Only your files won't load immediately... Very strange. Thanks anyway for your great work, I hope to fix this problem soon, I'll look at my apple TV settings again, I don't think the problem is coming from my computer, wifi connection, or itunes. "
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-08T06:16Z,something regarding the atv update you did.
,tonito11,2010-12-09T15:34Z,"wow you were right, I reset my ATV to factory settings, did the upgrade again, and now working fine.
Thank you, can't wait for your new releases !"
