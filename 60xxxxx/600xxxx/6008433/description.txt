If you are from the Kansas City area then you have heard of this band.  They play their hit single \"You\'re A Risk\" on 96.5 The Buzz frequently.  They will be opening for night two of \"The Night the Buzz Stole Christmas\" in Kansas City on December 8th, 2010.  They will be performing with My Chemical Romance, A Day To Remember and Innerpartysystem.  This is an up and coming band who\'s single is extremely hard to find, so I\'m sharing the wealth.  Enjoy.
