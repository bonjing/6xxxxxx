Rock & Gem Magazine. Full Collection 2010.

English | PDF | 12 Issues | 403 Mb

Since 1971, Rock & Gem has been the leading magazine for lapidary and 
mineral hobbyists. Not a trade journal or a scientific dissertation, 
it speaks to the average rockhound, providing the right blend of 
entertainment and information. Armchair hobbyists and diehard diggers 
will find something to enjoy in each issue.

Enjoy.
