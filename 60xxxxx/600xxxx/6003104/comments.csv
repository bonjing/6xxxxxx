[V],Mbb15,2010-12-01T21:16Z,I tested this and have alot more performance now :)
,C-Element,2010-12-01T21:24Z,"Nice Friggin Job Mbb15, been waiting for this.  U DA MAN   "
,r2007uk,2010-12-01T22:14Z,This is insinuating online play .... ?
[V],Mbb15,2010-12-01T22:23Z,"dont expect online play from scene groups, if it is done its most times by p2p people"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-01T22:24Z,Thanks .
,iycgtptyarvg,2010-12-01T22:32Z,Great! Thanks.
,fuuuuu,2010-12-01T22:33Z,"What the fuck, this update only made the game perform worse for me.
I had framerate drops and occasional hiccups before, but it was playable overall.
Now my framerate is constantly lower then it should be.

Any way to down-patch to update 1?"
,r2007uk,2010-12-01T23:11Z,"perhaps i misinterpreted(sp?):
-Server browser bug fixes and tweaks to populate faster and do full refresh less often  
-Fixed crash when viewing leaderboards
as 'online' associated features :"
,RMJ13,2010-12-01T23:15Z,This is REAL!  unpacked it is 24.8   the CORRECT SIZE! 
[V],Mbb15,2010-12-01T23:24Z,"Im not hacked anymore so everything from me is real again :), if you see me uploading movies it is 99% fake"
,Ahroo,2010-12-01T23:44Z,"I actually bought this game. Tried this patch but my cpu still runs at 100% in camapaign and multiplayer. I still get the studder and freezing in both also.

I run at native resolution 1920 1200 with 50 to 90 frames on 

win 7 64 bit 
Gpu 8800 gtx 768 mb overclocked
Cpu 2 cores at 3.2 
6 gigs of ram

It's absolutely ridiculous that's this game wont run right for me no matter what I do. I've tried everything. I either need a quad core or more to run without studders or wait for another patch. Anyway thx Mbb15 for the upload."
,ice02,2010-12-02T05:44Z,This patch had no effect on mine..The game still lags and lots of in-game sound stuttering..
,shauwy,2010-12-02T14:00Z,Ice02 me too don't resolve any probleme with this f.....k game  again some many freeze in game and sound probleme treyarch FAILS again because treyarch are NOOB its activision the best for cod not this bitch of treyarch but thanx Mbb15
,r2007uk,2010-12-02T16:03Z,"my game runs fine even when dragged onto my hdtv thru connection with only the 1st update applied

y'all just need better computers "
,RMJ13,2010-12-02T16:25Z,"It is not Better PC,s NEED better game coders!

did not fix the Lockup issue with XP! the only game that locks up my XP pc! No issues on 7"
,eriks14042,2010-12-02T18:12Z,"i don't see any difference,except ZOMBIE mode is now working :) thanks alot,hope there is a multiplayer mode for zombie mode soon aswell"
,shauwy,2010-12-02T18:46Z,r2007uk SHUT UP because you do not know what you're talking asshole
,KEEVVY,2010-12-02T19:18Z,"This looks just like update 1. And why it will be 2&3 in the same pach. Hoever it's working excelent on my laptop,even the alt+tab works excelent know, so may be it's 2&3."
,OnlySolus,2010-12-02T20:05Z,"Pretty weird I have a pretty damn decent pc just like most people and game runs perfect, with and without updates (using W7) :)
Only I have a Ati card though (I prefer nvidia but it came with a good ati so I keep that for now) maybe it just don't work well for people with Nvidia cards (I had a laptop with Nvidia and had lots of problems with games because of Nvidia even though I pref it over Ati lol)"
,KEEVVY,2010-12-02T21:04Z,"The shield version worked perfect,only some glich to the final mision, bu I was ebel to finish the game on good condition on a hd3450,but after I put this on the pc the game became a lot lagy, and after the second restart on the laptop became lagy al soo. I will give it more tries but if it fails again I will reconsider to return to shielc & skidrow pach 1."
[V],Mbb15,2010-12-02T21:23Z,"if you still can't run this game after the update you really need a new PC, I can even run this on my notebook"
,KEEVVY,2010-12-02T22:33Z,"I can run the game fine with shield and skidrow update 1, but not with this. And if this proces starts shoing up in task manager: ehyzua.exe that meens that something malicious is in this update."
,shauwy,2010-12-03T00:59Z,Who say that thy could not run it? just that there still had those damn freeze so do not understand it all wrong since made it a problem with the sound because the sound card by disabling the freeze disappear (Intel Core 2 Quad 3 GHz 4GB ram Gainward GTX 260) is my config? let me laugh for a game as ugly Treyarch are donkeys optimization issue is all.
,karun0109,2010-12-03T18:32Z,"epic win. Game was unplayable on X2 550 BE with HD 4850 before this update, did a new install and installed updates 1 2 and 3 and is now playable. Great work guys!!!! love the game though not optimized well for PC but still great."

,Poketamonsta,2010-12-08T10:31Z,"*RELOADED is not as good as SKiDROW and never will be. Their crackfix didnt work and it is horrible.
*After the installation of Blackops (without updates), i found the game laggy at some places.
*After update 1 the lag was smooth..not all at once but little bit each time.
*After update 2 and 3 the lag was gone but buttons like ""main menu"" and ""multiplayer didnt work in game (i cannot switch between multi and solo in game, i need to close the process and start the .exe)

SKiDROW is epic would love it if you could crack nfs hot pursuit...the job by RELOADED is terrible"
,Poketamonsta,2010-12-08T10:32Z,*Also multiplayer doesnt work...but thats fine with me...alterops is under construction

,GamerDude76,2011-06-22T03:23Z,"Ok, I know that people have been asking OVER and OVER about, ""WILL THIS MAKE MP WORK?"" But none have actually ever asked about LAN MP. That's what I'm wondering about... With the unpatched version that I am using so far It's trying to connect to the main servers and I know that that isn't possible and is being blocked on purpose. But have ANY of the patches actually made it where the main server connecting has been blocked so at least LAN Mp/Zombies works? Thanks for any useful answers."
