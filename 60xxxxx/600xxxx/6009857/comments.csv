,jarman007,2010-12-04T08:56Z,"hi
i am downloading this .....will comment on quality later


i would suggest u should keep a sample of the movie in the torrent.......i think more people will follow u if they download the sample and find it good.........many people hesitate to download whole movie from a new uploader
so try to keep a sample


by the way ......nice collection of movies :D"
