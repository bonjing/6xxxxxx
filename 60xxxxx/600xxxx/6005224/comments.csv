,torrjr,2010-12-02T18:21Z,Thanks for this.   (um should I be concerned that the .torrent file for this is 800k?  Why is it so big relatively speaking?)
,Clisig,2010-12-03T22:30Z,"Don't know why, the sound is OK but there is no video or blurred screen. Has to download the 1.1GB 720P one. I have tried KMplayer, even Elecard MPEG-2 Video Decoder but nothing changed. The snapshots look amazing but what a shame half a day waiting pops."
,marcelock,2010-12-05T11:57Z,"I can not play this file!
Has no image, only sound ...
What software or plugin I have to use?"
,west188,2010-12-05T12:24Z,I also can't play this file - download a other torrent instead!
,gatre1203,2010-12-06T21:39Z,VLC player could play this file \:D/
,danse82,2010-12-10T22:21Z,"Also cannot play this file on Windows Media Classic or Window Media Player - sound only, no video.
It's ok on VLC... so lame"
,khatkar,2010-12-20T16:20Z,plays very nicely with vlc in ubuntu..................
,r0807,2011-04-20T09:41Z,Get your heads out of your asses and download VLC.  Good luck trying to get anything to play a .ts file 
,ninline,2011-11-30T23:01Z,I use VLC on Linux and Mac.  It plays damn near anything.
