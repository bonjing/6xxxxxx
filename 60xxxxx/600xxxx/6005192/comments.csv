Sorry, man, but I'm temporarily shutting down my TV4iPod operation. My personal life has gotten a lot busier and I just can't get the episodes out on time. I'm concentrating, instead, on Mov4iPod (Movies 4 iPod) It's just too hard to get the episodes out in what I think is a fair amount of time. It I get my internet upgraded to speeds above my current 33 kb/s, I'll resume the operation."
