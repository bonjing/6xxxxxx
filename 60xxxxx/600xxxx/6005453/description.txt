Without a doubt this is one of the best teen high horror TV shows ever. 



NO EXAGGERATION !!!!!!


This is the one of the best episodes of the season.
If you don't like this show, you may be in serious need of medical attention.
Either that or you have already sold your soul to the devil

It's true !

You should see Jenny in the costume with the black angel wings.. Oh my gosh golly !

PS.. 
sure Jenny is cute.. 
but I like Hannah better.. 
Curtis got sooooooooo lucky in this episode.. 
Just watch and you'll see.. 
Don't get a hard on..
