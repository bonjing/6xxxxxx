Fleetwood Mac - Big Love [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Big Love" is a song by Fleetwood Mac, that appeared on their 1987 album Tango in the Night. The song was the first single to be released from the album, reaching number five on the U.S. charts, and number nine in the UK. The single was also a hit on the American dance charts, where the song peaked at number seven.

"Big Love" was written by Lindsey Buckingham, and was originally going to be part of his third solo album which he began working on in 1985, but the project became a Fleetwood Mac album instead. The song epitomised the stylised production techniques used on the album, with its provocative "oh - ahh" male/female vocal exchange. Though many assumed the female "ahh" to be Stevie Nicks, it was actually Lindsey Buckingham performing both, created by way of his voice being sampled and altered in the studio to mimic that of a woman.

This stylish and innovative promo video for "Big Love" was reported (by Mick Fleetwood himself) to have cost half a million dollars - a considerable amount for a three and a half minute clip, even by today's standards. The video was filmed in part at Kimberly Crest, a beautiful Victorian mansion in Redlands, California which is often used for weddings and social events.
