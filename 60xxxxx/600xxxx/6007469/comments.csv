,Wndrsnite,2011-01-20T13:23Z,Awesome torrent mate! The only decent quality one I've seen anywhere! Speeds are pretty nice too. Hope you'll upload season 6 when it comes out in DVD in April.
,jayslay2000,2011-02-13T12:06Z,Good lookin plz dont forget about season 6 in april my dude
,chandlerboy,2011-05-07T19:29Z,"Well, April has come and gone. Season 6?"
,wissamitter,2011-05-09T11:45Z,"Do you see the DVDs posted on the internet anywhere? Or maybe they grow on trees?... It takes money to buy the DVDs and maybe the uploader already did his/her fair share with the first five seasons don't you think? 

""Thanks uploader we really appreciate your efforts. If season 6 is ripped or not we'll still like to thank you greatly for your efforts for buying and ripping this wonderful classical show.""

This is the least the uploader deserves to hear instead of people whining about where is season 6...

Keep checking from time to time for season 6 and it'll will be up soon."
