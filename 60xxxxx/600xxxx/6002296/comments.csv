,Grubenplatz,2010-12-01T14:15Z,Why post something and NOT seed it?
[V],err0001,2010-12-01T14:19Z,"It is being seeded at about 200 KB/sec.

Wait an hour or so and there should be plenty of seeds."
,DeltaPan,2010-12-01T14:35Z,"Demonoid is showing seed/peer at 2/165 and 4 other trackers showing zero seed/peer, DHT shows 0/15.

So answer is, TPB is scraping a tracker other than Demonoid, likely publicbt or openbittorrent and scraping those will show zero seed/peer so that's why the stats on page show no seeder.



But load it in your client and you'll see Demonoid is source and swarm is building from there, if you edit torrent in client a delete all other trackers except demonoid, you'll connect at 2/165 seed/peer but you don't need to edit as clients will autoselect, i am now connecting to 49 peers but no seeds yet on demonoid at decent speeds as catching up to those half complete, many peers are already halfway at %50 complete via demonoid and swarm cascade will not be long.

Peace. : )"
,DeltaPan,2010-12-01T14:44Z,"Ah, now i see TPB is scraping Demonoid from earlier when it was 1/23 seed/peer, so it's just TPB taking time to update stats from tracker to appearing on page.

,zepplin10,2010-12-03T11:06Z,"Finally, we can send this series back to the soil.  Horrible terrible tv show.  GOOD UPLOAD, thank you Err."
,LordReserei,2010-12-03T23:46Z,"I thought this was an awesome episode and the last ten minutes made me sad to the core at how there's not going to be anymore Caprica. 

They should've really continued with it, at least waited until how this episode did. 

Anyone know the ratings? "
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-07T12:08Z,"@LordReserei,

I don't know what sort of ratings this had, but they obviously were low enough for SyFy to cancel it.

They should have done more marketing of this show because if people knew it was a prequel to Battlestar Galactica, a lot more people between 35 and 45 would have watched it.  That was the only reason I even started watching it, and it did take 2 or 3 episodes to get into it, but after the last few episodes, I definitely want to see how the story continues towards the eventual war between man and machine.

What's funny is that SciFi Channel used to have almost every NYC bus stop covered in ads for their specials and upcoming series.  I guess the new name also means new marketing tactics. (which is, don't spend a dime, and cancel anything that you don't spend a dime on.  Pretty soon, they'll just be a channel of syndicated crap.)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-07T12:17Z,"@LordReserei,

...and oh yeah...  It is still possible to get this series restored.

If enough people send emails and letters to SyFy, they might figure out that it really was a popular show.

There's a significant gap between the metrics they use to measure a show's viewership and the modern day reality of a popularity of a show.  

Nielsen ratings?  They were vaguely correlated in the 80's.  Now there is nothing real about nielsen ratings.  a few hundred people with boxes that monitor what they watch on TV?  And that's supposed to extrapolate out to millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of viewers?

Really?  I guess they haven't heard about this series of tubes, you know, those interwebz all the kids are smoking these days."
,u0rns,2010-12-07T13:41Z,"Great show, shame its all over :("
,BoonesFerry,2010-12-08T09:03Z,"Syfy revealed theyâ€™ve ordered a prequel pilot called Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome, which will replace Caprica next season if it gets picked up."
,Rugburned,2010-12-21T06:00Z,"Be carefull guys, they are watching this torrent.  I got a letter from my ISP for downloading this.  I guess Its VPN's for me from now on.."
,axilleaszz,2011-02-16T11:15Z,thanks
