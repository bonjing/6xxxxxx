British 24 minute lasting animated film Lost and Found (2008), directed by Philip Hunt, has been voted audience\\\'s favourite in the 20th edition of Animafest, the World Festival of Animated Film, held in Zagreb, Croatia, over the first six days of June 2010, making it the only \\\"absolute\\\" winner of the festival. Namely, while all other awards were given within a particular category, award for the best film in competition according to the audience\\\'s votes has been cross-category voted, taking into consideration all animated short subjects shown in any of numerous competition, as well as overview programs of films produced between the application deadlines for the last two short-film editions of the festival (held in 2008 and 2010), including Grand Competition, Grand Panorama (quality films that haven\\\'t qualified for the Grand Competition), Student Competition, Student Panorama, and Films for Children competing in four different, age related categories, for 4-7 years, 7-10 years, 10-14 years and 14+ years old children.

As described in the festival\\\'s catalogue, film is \\\"a magical tale of loneliness and friendship, based on the award-winning book by Oliver Jeffers. One day, a boy finds a penguin on his doorstep and decides to take it home - even if that means rowing all the way to the South Pole! ...\\\" Not limited to the program it was presented with (Films for Children Competition 7-10 years old), this simple, yet enchanting story has immediately attracted my undivided attention, easily deserving my spectator\\\'s vote as well.

As if opposing its generated ambiance to its preexisting ambient, i.e. its emotionally moving, initially quiet, ultimately heartwarming tale vs. harsh, cold climate of Antarctica (main scene for its action), this animated short has been pleasing audiences all over the world and winning awards ever since its Christmas 2008 release, following nicely in the footsteps of its precious picture book original. Among others, it has already received BAFTA (the British Academy of Film and Television Arts) Children\\\'s Award for Best Animation in 2009, and Children\\\'s Jury Award in Chicago International Children\\\'s Film Festival the same year, before winning the hearts of the international audience gathered at Animafest.

Although voice-over narration might appear superfluous, because the pictures already tell the story and transfer messages quite clearly, the turning-point notion on how \\\"it\\\'s hard to say good-bye to someone who has become part of your life, specially if you haven\\\'t noticed it happening\\\", communicated in narrator\\\'s (Jim Broadbent) calm and pleasant voice, remained echoing in my mind for a long while, as a reminiscent of this little gem I\\\'ve been delighted to watch.
