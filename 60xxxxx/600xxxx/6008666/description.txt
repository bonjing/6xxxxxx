FEATURED IN INDIEDB'S TOP 100 INDIE GAMES OF THE YEAR 2010!


Description	


This is the retail release of First Fantasy, there has been many (and I mean MANY) fine tweaks from the beta. All the bugs mentioned either by email or in forum posts have been rectified and it should run fine.

Take your time to read the manual if you need to know anything - I don't like tutorials in games so there's nothing holding your hand when you begin.

I also hate grinding. Which is why I've kept it to the minimum. Although if you're one of these masochistic Koreans - You have the choice to increase the encounter rate; Something which you'll be rewarded for with a SUPER SECRET ENDING.

Fixed Varian city castle bug where the bookshelf spontaniously combusted.

From suggestion: I've added the feature to sleep in any of the Posidon's Curse ship beds.

Corrected issue with floating text not updating properly.

Changed The Great Cliche's room change point due to a game-breaking bug where if you parked the ship right next to The Great Cliche, you couldn't return to it.

Fixed issue with the Trilly and Surge cutscene not properly updating the cutscene end flag.

Girl in Varian City is no longer confused over her gender.

Edited dialogue between Trilly and Surge during the Catacomb cutscene.
