However, I have a problem. Never happened before, but I can't get this movie nor a few other Esperanza Gomez movies you uploaded to play. It always comes up as a black screen.

If it does come up, it's permanently paused. I can move the slider to view different parts of the scene, but it's always freeze framed.


I can't get it to play on media player classic, VLC, Realplayer, Windows media player, or Quicktime.

I would greatly appreciate it if somebody could help"
