"Mixology Certification"

When the study group convenes to celebrate 
Troy's (Donald Glover) birthday, they 
realize he is actually turning 21 and 
decide to hit the bars! While Jeff (Joel 
McHale) and(Gillian Jacobs) ingest 
a few too many cocktails and get silly, 
Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) gets busy 
pulling down incriminating photos of 
herself that are posted at the bar. Annie 
(Alison Brie) embraces the identify on her 
fake ID, while Abed (Danny Pudi) delves 
into conversation with a fellow sci-fi 
nerd. When Senor Chang (Ken Jeong) finds 
the fresh remains of a birthday cake in 
the study room, he vows to find the group.

Enjoy :)
