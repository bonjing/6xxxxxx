Allmusic Review:
Released in 2005, Christmas in My Heart is the fifth studio album from German singer Sarah Connor. Its 12 tracks include festive standards ("White Christmas," "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas") and English-language versions of German seasonal classics such as "Tonight's the Night" ("Oh Du Froliche") and "A New Kingdom" ("Leise Reiselt der Schnee"), all performed in a contemporary pop style. Produced by regular collaborators Kay Denar and Rob Tyger, it also includes an original composition, the title track, which features guest vocals from Naturally 7's Dwight Stewart.
