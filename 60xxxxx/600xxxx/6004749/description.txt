GERRY MULLIGAN & PAUL DESMOND BLUES IN TIME
Original Released: 1957
Label: Verve
Format :Flac



So busy were the saxophonists Paul Desmond and Gerry Mulligan in the mid-1950s that it took three years finally to get together to make this classic 1957 recording. Accompanied by Mulligan's regular, piano-less, rhythm section of bass and drums, the sweet-sounding altoist (Desmond) and the wonderfully lyrical baritone player (Mulligan) prove to be a great team, on the same wavelength yet able to keep the music spontaneous and exciting â€“ as the title track, in particular, shows.
