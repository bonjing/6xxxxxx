Yea, sorry, they arent releasing just the patch. Both the THETA and Unleashed releases are the game with the patch installed.

and there are still MANY bugs. but the legit versions have the exact same problems because it's the game itself, not the releases."

Tnx, I had the same problem. Just creating the UserData map myself worked fine. :)
Great game."
