  This story is inspired from the life of   
  Paritala Ravi from South India who was    
  assassinated in January, 2005.            

 Paritala Ravi was arguably the most feared   
 individual ever in the history of the blood- 
 ridden faction politics of South India.      
 He was a prime accused in innumerable murder 
 cases and also survived numerous             
 assassination attempts, the most brutal of
