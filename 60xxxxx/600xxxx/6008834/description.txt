Have you ever played a game of zombies and all of a sudden someone starts flying through walls? Well now you can be that guy plus much more. Ive looked at the other torrents available and this one definitely has the most mods. All you need is a flashed Xbox and burn this to a dual layer disc. No other modding needed. There is a word document included to show you what buttons does what and how to change menus
Here is a list of what this can do:

Special clan tags
turn zombie spawn on/off
Tenth prestige
compass
ping monitoring
God Mode
Demi God mode
No-Clip (Fly)
UFO
No Target
Give All
Drop weapon
Remove weapon
Give ammo
Coop Scoring
Low Gravity
unlimited ammo
unlimited sprint
laser sight
low zombie gravity
Lower player damage
Super Double Tap
Super Sleight of Hand
Long range melee
Long range Revive
long last stand
Super Bowie Knife
Slow/Speed up Time
Paintball Mode
Shoot to Revive
Explosive Rounds on down
Explosive heads
More Points per revive
Player Speed
Clip size
Freeze Players

Again there is a word document included showing you what buttons do what and how to get to them. But be warned. If you are not the host of the game you will only be able to use All guns and noclip and god mode. Anything else will kick you out if you dont host.
