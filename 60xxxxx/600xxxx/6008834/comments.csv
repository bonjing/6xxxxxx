If you are not hosting the game you will be kicked if you use other mods. You are however able to host a online zombies game and use whatever mods you please and others can share mods such as low gravity."
,Otaku073,2010-12-04T03:47Z,also the initial seeding wont be really fast. I have ATT internet and averaging about 35kb upload so far. Once i get my data out you guys can take over with your faster internets lol
,Chow69,2010-12-06T00:29Z,Seed you ungrateful bastards!!!
,Chow69,2010-12-06T00:32Z,btw thank you Otaku for this awesome torrent. If only our Canadian ISPs didn't cap our fucking bandwidth usage. I only get 60gbs a month. I'll seed as much as I can though.
,Otaku073,2010-12-06T00:43Z,dang that sux man. Everyone stopped downloading earlier today because im the only seeder until someone completes the torrent and while i was a work my roommate turned off my torrent but its back up.
,Chow69,2010-12-06T00:45Z,Thanks man. Highly appreciated :D
,Otaku073,2010-12-06T00:51Z,No Problem. If the torrent ever stops downloading dont freak out. Its probably because one of my roommates paused my torrents while i was away cause im lagging there xbox live seeding this. Just keep your torrent up and ill turn it back on.
,Chow69,2010-12-06T06:41Z,"lol just outta curiosity, Otaku are you using a Mac?"
,Otaku073,2010-12-06T14:04Z,lol no
,jj423,2010-12-06T15:42Z,is there any way you could do this with black ops???
,Otaku073,2010-12-06T16:22Z,"@jj423
mabey im looking into it. Id like to try it with black ops as well cause flying outside the map lets you see so much more with how the map works that your not supposed to see. Oh another thing i forgot to mention. When you fly outside the map with noclip make sure your god mode is turned on when you land because the outside of the map kills you instantly and restarts that game unless your god mode is turned on. And if you want the Special clan tags turned on such as making your name colorful or move you have to be set to Tactical button layout. Most of the mods are on the tactical setting"
,bezzlebub666,2010-12-06T17:23Z,thanks man ur fuckin awsome

,Chow69,2010-12-07T02:37Z,Don't bullshit people like that you idiot. It's only been uploaded for 3 days. That does not equal a week. Stop being such a pussy seed like the rest of us decent people
,Otaku073,2010-12-07T04:08Z,this has only been posted for 3 days man and everyone is at 83% and downloading fine. Just keep your torrent up. Once there are more seeders other than me it will go alot faster. I should be done uploading to people tommorow
,tonybj,2010-12-07T20:04Z,I got a problem when burning it. I got the latest iXtreme version. I burned the game to a DVD+R DoubleLayer 8.5GB. It succesed but it couldnt lock the cd/disc. When I put it in my console it just say open tray. Please tell me what I did wrong??
,tonybj,2010-12-07T20:07Z,I got a problem when burning it. I got the latest iXtreme version. I burned the game to a DVD+R DoubleLayer 8.5GB. It succesed but it couldnt lock the cd/disc. When I put it in my console it just say open tray. Please tell me what I did wrong?
,Otaku073,2010-12-07T21:31Z,what do you mean couldnt lock?
,jj423,2010-12-07T23:40Z,"this is sooo fuckin cool!! i cant believe this actually works!! i just wanted to tell you, you fuckin rock! especially if you can do this to cod black ops!!"
,Otaku073,2010-12-08T00:12Z,no problem man. Just follow the directions on the word document i game you. theres alot of button combinations to lear
,Chow69,2010-12-08T00:54Z,Crap I haven't unlocked Nazi Zombies yet though. The campaign is all screwed up. One the second level there aren't any soldiers. Is there a way for me to download a gamesave to my 360?
,Otaku073,2010-12-08T02:54Z,with the newest update from xbox live you dont need to unlock zombies
,Chow69,2010-12-08T03:50Z,I only got the silver membership. I did update the game though (so it said) Dunno what happened though. Looks exactly the same. Is there a way to delete the game data or update?
,xBrider,2010-12-08T18:53Z,"What does it mean by ""you have to have a FLASHED 360""? I don't know what that means."
,xBrider,2010-12-08T18:57Z,Oh and also too... how can i become a seeder? I don't wanna be another ass hole just using you guys to download and not give back!?
,jj423,2010-12-08T21:13Z,"there is only 1 open zombie map, it wants you to buy the otheres!!! for 2000 points?!? forget that shit.. is there a way to open the other maps without buying them? also, whats the word on that black ops copy like this? lol"
,Otaku073,2010-12-09T00:11Z,"@xBrider
a flashed xbox is a xbox with a modded drive that allows it to play burned games. To be a seeder you have to complete the torrent 100% and keep your torrent running and uploading data. That is a seeder

@jj423
You dont unlock the other maps the're not on the disc. You have to download the other maps in a expansion pack on xbox live marketplace. I think theres a way of downloading the maps and transfering them to your hard drive but im not sure. I think since your getting a free game i can throw out 800 microsoft points for a map. i Think the 2000 point one is all 3. The third one is my favorite which is 800 last time i looked at it"
,Metalmayhem,2010-12-11T09:23Z,Does this work with hot-swapping??
,Otaku073,2010-12-11T16:14Z,idk i dont do hotswapping. I think its much easier just burning it to a disc and put it in
,jj423,2010-12-13T15:05Z,"there any chance you could get this for sniper ghost warrior? i know there is on already, i just cant find it anywhere!!"
,acr250rider,2010-12-13T18:11Z,"Hey thanks for the ul,But do you need jtag to play this mod if you do thats sucks but if you don`t than it is not working for me! followed button layout instructions nothing happens!Maybe I`m missing something don`t know but thanks anyway!!"
,Otaku073,2010-12-19T04:14Z,"@acr250rider
You have to be on tactical button layout for most of the mods. Also this doesnt work on multiplayer if thats what your trying. This is nazi zombies only or campaign"
,sr_240sx,2010-12-21T05:17Z,I can't get this to work i think they released a update that makes the mods not work just like GTA 4 modding
,sr_240sx,2010-12-21T05:39Z,I got this to work i had the game installed to my hdd the none modded one and forgot to delete it before playing the modded disk. Thanks a ton for the upload its so cool works great no jtag needed.
,mas789456,2010-12-25T20:21Z,"srry total noob at this
so you just xtract the files and then put them together with magic iso right?"
,Otaku073,2010-12-25T22:24Z,i use winrar to put them all together and use imgburn to put it on a DVD DL disc
,pleaseseedme,2011-01-05T01:44Z,"EVERYONE READ

This mod will ban you from xbox live, even if you play offline. "
,jj423,2011-01-07T18:27Z,"pleaseseedme is full of fuckin shit...i use this mod every day and havent got banned....as a matter of fuckin fact, i was just online using it like an hour ago!, so take your fake ass spamming comments and stick em the fuck up your ass bitch.. bottom line...it works just fine"
,prophets1997,2011-01-11T15:07Z,"Thanks Man!
im downloading now and its really fast :D.. 
im sure it will be amazing to play!"
,prophets1997,2011-01-11T15:08Z,"@Xbrider

a flashed xbox means you can play copied games and burn them to a disk, you can either flash it youself or send it off to a company to flash it for you (thats what i do)"
,prophets1997,2011-01-12T01:53Z,"Hey, does this mod have split screen?
thanks"
,sr_240sx,2011-01-14T20:37Z,"@prophets1997
i have played this with the mods in split screen 
so yes it does."
,iptracker,2011-01-15T14:52Z,"Am i wrong in assuming that the NAND stores ban flags and these can be sent to microsoft as and when they wish? and that you have modified the iso of this game? So it probably works but there IS a chance that you may get banned and as for the comment stating that you have played this iso loads of times and not been banned, A ban is not instant it can happen months after playing a MODDED game even if you have the newest firmware available which is LT + as the server can tell that the iso of the game you are playing has been modified and not just copied which you CAN get away with with the newest Firmware until a new update comes out to quash it and we have to start all over again, please feel free to curse and moan or answer properly  as you wont get a reply from me as i dont rise to hot heads who cant be civil and talk like normal people just fly off the handle and spit their dummies out."
,jj423,2011-01-23T16:29Z,"@iptracker...i know your not talking to me faggot, and no the nand does not store the flag, then ""secdata.bin"" file does, so maybe you should know what the fuck your talking about bitch. and as for the banning, if your on the latest firmware ""lt+"" and iso patch the game through abgx, it is NOT detectable...do your homework before you come on here trying to act all smart and shit, it just makes you look stupid when you talk about shit you know nothing about...."
,charincol,2011-02-01T13:01Z,"jj423 is harsh but he's 100% right. I also have played a similar modded WaW Zombies disk with friends over Xbox Live and my secdata.bin is clean.

Yes, there is always a chance of being banned for playing something like this. Hell, there's a chance of being banned from Xbox Live just for playing on Xbox Live if someone at Microsoft makes a mistake and inadvertently bans your console by mistake, and there would be nothing you could do about it. However, the chances of being banned from playing this are no more than any other backup.

Now if you modded the default.xex file in an ISO of any game and went on Live with it, then you're toast!"
,stolenbmx,2011-02-01T19:16Z,really nice works fine ran threw abgx and worked like a charm but do you have a v4 iso with mod menus and what not an upload would be greatly appreciated because youube uploads are full of spam and viruses
,stolenbmx,2011-02-02T06:30Z,can you make a v4 one with the new mod menues and forge and evrything else?
,LosPeebles,2011-02-02T23:33Z,What do I need to do to get this to work via hot swap? 
,jj423,2011-02-08T00:13Z,"if any of you want the absolute newest best patch availible go to www.tah4t.com, and get it there, its awsome!! its 15 bucks for a pre modded ready to go disc. sign up in the forums as well, tell em jj423 sent ya!"
,jesty9,2011-03-02T01:03Z,"hey, just burned the disc, having trouble actually doing it, i follow the directions but im wondering if i missed some essential part to make it work."
,iiGhostzX,2011-03-07T10:39Z,"can someone inv me for a modded zombie game so i know it works? my XBL GT is: unoobishh
