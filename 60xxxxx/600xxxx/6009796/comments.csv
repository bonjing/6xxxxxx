,wayneking,2010-12-06T19:24Z,"Thanks for the EXELLENT UL as usual hiest.

It's kinda hard to believe that some studio exec' was willing to plough that amount of cash into special effects for this script.  What an absurdly terrible movie!  Worst of 2010 imo."

Bunch of trolls spamming comments such as ""no closure"" etc etc guess the idiots never read books as you can't read them start to finish in one hit!"
