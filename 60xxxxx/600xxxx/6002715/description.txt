ABBA was a Swedish pop music group formed in Stockholm in 1972, consisting of Anni-Frid "Frida" Lyngstad, BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Agnetha FÃ¤ltskog. Throughout the band's existence, FÃ¤ltskog and Ulvaeus were a married couple, as were Lyngstad and Andersson - although both couples later divorced. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, and they topped the charts worldwide from 1972 to 1983.
