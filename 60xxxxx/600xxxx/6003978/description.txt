Summary: 
The story has a young woman (newcomer "Noonaa" Neungtida Sophon), who's obsessed with South Korean TV dramas, and a young guy ("Ter" Chantavit Dhanasevi from Coming Soon). He doesn't get the whole Korean craze but signs up for a package tour anyway because he's lonely. And so he meets the girl and the pair have all sorts of wacky adventures while travelling around South Korea.
