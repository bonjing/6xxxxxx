Allmusic Review:
Released as an exclusive at Target stores for the holiday season of 2007, the year between Taylor SwiftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2006 debut and her 2007 breakthrough Fearless, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection balances SwiftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pop and country roots quite well. She contributes two originals - Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christmases When You Were MineÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christmas Must Be Something MoreÃ¢â‚¬Â -- to a collection that features the classics Ã¢â‚¬Å“Santa Baby,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“Silent Night,Ã¢â‚¬Â Ã¢â‚¬Å“White Christmas,Ã¢â‚¬Â and Wham!'s modern-day standard Ã¢â‚¬Å“Last Christmas,Ã¢â‚¬Â giving them all crisp, cheerful arrangements that are suitably seasonal but also faithful to her bright country-pop.
