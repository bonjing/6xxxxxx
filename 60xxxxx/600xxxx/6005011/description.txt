A complete collection of Megas XLR Seasons 1 & 2, formatted in M4V, ready for iTunes, or whatever else requires it.

Also includes the much sought-after soundtrack (go ahead, find it somewhere else, good luck!).  Unfortunately, some of the soundtrack files aren't the best quality, but I work with what I got.
If you happen to want just the soundtrack, you can grab it from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6005029

Enjoy!
