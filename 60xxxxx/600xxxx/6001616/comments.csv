,paidbydeath,2010-12-01T19:32Z,"I got the USB controller to work, for anyone having the problems like I was, just use this guide.



1.  Download the xbox 360 controller emulator at http://code.google.com/p/x360ce/down...4.zip&can=2&q= 
2.  Extract the zip into your game directory (eg: C:\super meat boy..)
3.  Run the executable and configure your keys. This is pretty easy. Note that I had to actually set the D-pad directions to my D-pad 1 directions. Be careful to keep these set because the D-pad binds will be reset every time you open the utility. 
4.  ""Fake Mode"" in the options must be set to Normal. 
5.  Copy the xinput1_3.dll that it creates in the super meat boy directory. Rename the copy to xinput9_1_0.dll 
6.  Save your profile (click Save at the bottom) and exit the configuration utility. 
7.  Start the game. 

There you easy as that, have fun!

Cheers."

It does work in Win 7 64x just right click the exe and go to properties and on the compatibility tab check the Windows XP SP3 as well as Run as administrator check boxes. Without doing that the game seems to crash after a few levels of gameplay.

Oh, also if the installer says cannot find ""blank"" then just delete the installer and re-extract it from the torrent again. It worked for me."

Everything else seems to work fine, its just that last level in the game where the final boss doesnt show up in the level itself."
