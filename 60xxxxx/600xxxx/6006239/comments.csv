Thanks!"
[T],trialNerror,2010-12-03T01:27Z,"It's either E25 or E24 - depending on where you look.  
Some sites say 24, others say 25.  
I say 25 because this is continuation of the (Mostly) Complete Season 6 where the last number was 24 in the list.  
I DO include the Halloween Special as an episode whether or not other sources do or not and so each are numbered according to order of date aired.
Thank you.
Please come again."
