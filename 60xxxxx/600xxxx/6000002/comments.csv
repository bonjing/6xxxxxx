Great Forums

A Pirates Book - 
One man crew, so help is GOOD! but only when he/she can get to them. Whoever runs that site knows a shitload about everything. lol. They don't care about pirated games, you just can't link anything to them. A MUST site to checkout. Seems their American based. So, he/she has some balls :P

Cocky and arrogant. But they do help. Have to register to see anything.... not good. AND DON""T SAY YOU DOWNLOADED A GAME! If you get your panties in a bunch easy.... not for you.

Other than that.

THIS IS A COMMENT SECTION! FOR FUCKS MATE!"
,apollothedog,2010-12-11T15:06Z,"and quite saying ""seed"" like it's a magic word. Chances are, NO ONE DOWNLOADED THE GAME AND CAME BACK TO SEE IF THEY STILL NEED TO FUCKING SEED!

But, do remember to seed at least 2:1 or even 4:1"

,pb185,2010-12-23T19:31Z,"Works perfect with Drivekey 2. No soft mods. 
Burnt image with imgburn at 1x speed and worked instantly. 

Only issue to note is that the loading times are probably 2-3 times longer than i would expect, however, really isn't a problem.

Thanks for the up!"

When you use DVD-R discs the Wii can only read them at 3x speed compared to it reading original game discs at 6x, hence why you are finding loading times longer. USB loading is the way to go, as USB drive playback speeds exceed the standard 6x of genuine disc speeds.
Some games glitch or have speed issues with DVD-R discs"

,vpaz,2011-01-01T12:31Z,"I have a modded Wii from last year or so, Just downloaded and burnt this game but it says I have to update to play it. Do i press OK and continue update, or will this brick my wii or such? If not do I just not play this game or is there another way i can update it?"

,thuerrsch,2011-05-12T21:17Z,"Thanks a lot! Runs just fine from HDD on a soft-modded Wii. And in German too, so it seems this is the multilingual (EN-ES-FR-DE) version."
