Integrating Titles with Footage in After Effects

In this series of lessons well learn how to composite a text title into background footage. This is a common task for show openers or to add extra information into your shot.

Well begin this project by importing our background plate and creating the text well integrate. Then we'll track the background plate and attach our text to the track. Well then learn about the uses of pre-composing and how to combine various effects to make our text look more three dimensional. Well then learn how to take elements from our background and layer them into our text to create the illusion that the text is in the scene. Well finish by doing a quick colour correction and render out our finished shot!
