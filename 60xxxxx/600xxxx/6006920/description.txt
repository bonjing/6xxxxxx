ReleaseNotes:

Jason Aldean is an artist that quite obviously puts a lot of energy into his performances and his music in general. He is a great cross of country and rocker, perhaps a cowboy rocker, with a brand and style of music that gets you energized while also perhaps smacking you in the gut a bit.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
