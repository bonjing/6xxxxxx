- Leaked Cables Reveal U.S. Pressured Spain to Drop Case of Cameraman Killed in 2003 Attack on Journalists in Baghdad

Leaked U.S. embassy cables from Madrid reveal the United States pressured the Spanish government to close a court case brought by the family of a Spanish cameraman JosÃ© Couso. Couso was killed in Baghdad when an U.S. Army tank fired on the Palestine Hotel, which was filled with journalists, on April 8, 2003. Three U.S. soldiers have been indicted in Spanish court for Couso's death. "I am outraged," says Javier Couso, the brother of JosÃ© Couso. "I can't believe my government conspired with a foreign government â€¦ it seems we are citizens, or at least a small province, of the empire of the United States."

We speak to the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who says describes our current moment as one of exceptional poverty and is calling on President Obama to hold a bipartisan meeting on hunger and poverty.
