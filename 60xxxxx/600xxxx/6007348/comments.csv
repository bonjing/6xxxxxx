,danielmiro,2010-12-03T16:27Z,it works?? Anyone??
,danielmiro,2010-12-03T16:28Z,Since yestarday all my CS5 got busted.. No active anymore... =P
,48441095,2010-12-03T18:29Z,It really works!!! Thanks a lot. Love your work!
,48441095,2010-12-03T18:30Z,"Same... since yesterday, my installation was also giving the Serial number prompt. I have to admit... this method is a bit laborious in the sense, there are a ton of folders to go into and replace the file. But, once you do that, works like a charm!!!. 

Oh.. did I say already I love your work!!!. Thank you so much!."
,shapeinfiltrator,2010-12-03T23:34Z,"Same problem here, nice quick upload........"
,protwitness,2010-12-04T01:14Z,"Fixed the trial problem that happened yesterday, thanks!"
,treeelee,2010-12-04T07:58Z,Worked perfect thanks a bunch Anonymous!
,treeelee,2010-12-04T07:59Z,worked for me thanks!!
,RoyalPhyton,2010-12-04T11:38Z,Thx Work super fine !!
,robf92,2010-12-04T13:59Z,"This works perfectly, I agree with the other comment, it can be a paint to find and replace all the files but its worth the work :)

I wonder if a BAT file could be written to find/replace them instead."
,chimuy,2010-12-05T02:48Z,"the ones that are not working for me are those i can't find the amtlib.dll file, but even i found the one for indesign it still doesn't work. does anyone have the same problem?"
,treeelee,2010-12-05T03:34Z,"chimuy  one or two of them are in the support folders and the others when you go to c;programfiles are just down below, they are in alphabetical order bro! just look down to you see it "
,pirate_noob,2010-12-07T17:25Z,"Ok, got the Trial warning so I installed your .dll files. 
Works in Photoshop x64, but x32 crashing now when I open a .psd file in it. Does not crash if opening a .jpg. Weird! Any ideas?

Also, Illustrator is in Tryout mode and wants to connect to internet 1rst before opening. When I do not allow, it wont open. Was going to just reinstall Adobe but am afraid it now wont accept the key I have used already."
,foogama,2010-12-12T04:58Z,"registered just so that I could comment: works like a champ, thank you man!!

Just remember that in some directories the file is in a sub directory called ""support files""

(using Win 7 x64)"
,jproof,2010-12-27T10:35Z,i think I love you... thanks so much... works perfectly!
,majida905,2011-01-08T17:58Z,"This one doesn't work for me, but I found an other one here which is ok:
