,Yurn2,2010-12-08T10:39Z,"Hey HolyRoses, just a note on a personal finding. I know that these rips are for a PSP, iPod and Zune, however I have found that most play on a regular Xbox (has 64MB RAM) with XBMC installed. The few that don't are ones using the Sony PSP format profile. Base Media profile appear to play fine."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-08T23:51Z,"yea i tried it on xbox with xbmc as well a long time ago.  it will play 480p with the aggressive psp settings i was using a long time ago for testing, but it will have issues, slow down, etc."
,skeletorr,2011-01-13T01:57Z,Thanks HR.
,TxJag,2011-01-13T19:02Z,I lol'ed at all of the pop culture stuff they threw in there. It was what made me laugh the most haha.
,B0rNP1rAt3,2011-01-24T04:27Z,"Umm, I don't get it. Can someone please explain to me the difference between unrated and extended edition? Are they the same or not?"
