I tried adding it as a non-steam game and still did not work. Is there a particular file or software missing maybe? "

Update your DirectX

and make sure you have

Microsoft Visual C++ 2008

Some people just have trouble running it.
you can also try the THETA release, but you might have the same problem."
,klord2010,2010-12-03T06:37Z,Update 2 is already out there. This is stupid beta testing. :/
,TTSoul540,2010-12-03T07:09Z,"@alexisthebest

Yea I am running Windows XP with Direct X 9.0c. Should I update and get Windows 7 or something for Direct X 10? BTW i have Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 but it still doesn't work. "
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-03T07:33Z,"@klor2010

Yea, there's no cracked release YET but i'll be sure to keep an eye out for it.

yea. It pretty much is beta testing -_______-

@TTSoul540
Well i use XP and it works for me. Maybe try re installing directx."

Oh, well, THETA released cracked update 2 already. Only if you knew where their home ground is... :-)"
,willaim12,2010-12-03T12:40Z,"Many thanks for the upload â€“ I just wish I could get out of â€œThe best resolution is 1280 x 1024 x 75htzâ€ - and then giving me the black screen of death!
So I donâ€™t want to sound stupid, but how do you do this on Win XP Pro : - â€œGo to Library, then Right Click on Super Meat Boy and go to Properties â€œ Cos for the life of me I canâ€™t figure out what you mean! Cheers ïŠ

,klord2010,2010-12-03T14:11Z,"Create a ""shortcut"" and add those option.

e.g.)

from
""X:\Games\Super Meat Boy\SuperMeatBoy.exe""

to
""X:\Games\Super Meat Boy\SuperMeatBoy.exe"" -option1here -option2here -blahblah

to (practical one)
""X:\Games\Super Meat Boy\SuperMeatBoy.exe"" -1024x768

keep in mind that only list options are working. Ive checked their exe and found that there's no such a thing like -1600x900 yeah dev guys are lazy or something. D:"
,Landazar,2010-12-03T23:52Z,"This version actually worked for me.  All the others were freezing at when i finished level 3!

Thx!"
