,NitLions,2010-12-05T04:07Z,"hate to post cuz I hate lysergic acid, what a dumhead!! Don't tell another man how to work his scales, thats rude. Just because u have spent so much time in your parent's basement nerding yourself up doesn't mean u r right!! Dude probably wasn't expecting very much from an R5 and was surprised that it was exactly what he wanted it to be for quality. So he dropped a 10 on it, don't be a dumface anymore cuz its why u don't get laid. Girls don't wanna go to a movie with a guy and listen to u complain about how its unrealistic and how the director should have used a different type of special effects blah blah. Seriously, listen to me bro. Its why u don't have a sex life. Hope for your sake u listen"
,iamhelix,2010-12-05T08:01Z,"i agree his 10 out of 10 is most likely correct becasue the title says its a R5 you idiot. if it said it was a DVD rip and had crap res then you would have a point, but when it comes to R5's and Cams and shit like that its really a matter of opinion. go flame somehere else.
You people who are so picky about other peoples rating are idiots, we can tell how good a rip it really is by the amount of people who give it good scores you never trust 1 comment alone. 
And who givex a shit if its wrong anyway no one held a gun to your head and told you to download it. 
This site has so many cry babies, you almost act like you are paying for these rips or something, "
,mcjiralo,2010-12-05T23:25Z,thanks
