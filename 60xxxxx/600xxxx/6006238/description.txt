             Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is considered to be the next step in the

             detection and removal of malware. In our product we have compiled

             a number of new technologies that are designed to quickly detect, 
    
             destroy, and prevent malware. Malwarebytes Anti-Malware can detect 
   
             and remove malware that even the most well known anti-virus and  
     
             anti-malware applications fail to detect. Malwarebytes   
             
             Anti-Malware monitors every process and stops malicious processes  
   
             before they even start. The Realtime Protection Module uses our   
    
             advanced heuristic scanning technology which monitors your system  
   
             to keep it safe and secure. In addition, we have implemented a    
    
             threats center which will allow you to keep up to date with the   
    
             latest malware threats.

             Use our keymaker to register the application. Close the keygen       

             before trying to register!
