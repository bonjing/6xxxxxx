,LJE111,2011-01-29T08:19Z,"I got a Notice of Claim of Copyright Infringement from Sony on this dl (via comcast). 

I canâ€™t figure out why I keep getting hit. Maybe itâ€™s because I was briefly turning off my PeerBlock when it wouldn't allow me access to a safe website. (I always paused all dlâ€™s when I did this.) After two warnings within a week I no longer employ this practice. Now I open PeerBlock and allow only the site I want access to. I never disable it entirely if I am downloading. Hopefully this will help as I am on my 4th warning. (If you want to know how to allow access to specific sites you know are safe, but PeerBlock is designating the IP as a threat, you can go to PeerBlockâ€™s User Guide/Allow Lists.) Also, I am checking for updates more frequently than the default setting of once/day. 

If this doesnâ€™t help, then I may have no choice but to limit downloading to when I am not browsing on my computer. (Also thinking of changing my Internet service provider - beginning to think I am on a â€œlistâ€.)

The other thing I noticed is the copyright infringements have all been on movies that I have downloaded either BEFORE the official DVD release date or within a couple of days after its release. Could it be Sony, Fox, etc is looking only for P2P dlâ€™s of recently released - or about to be released - movies?

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated.

Hope this helps someone who might be having the same problem.  Thanks!"
