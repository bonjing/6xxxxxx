Use LAME encoder as a starting point not iTunes and if you have the bandwidth use 320Kbps and always ensure all the ID3 tag information is included.

Thanks for your efforts so far, look forward to a better quality version."
,OneTwoWilliams,2010-12-04T16:36Z,"I kind of did it for myself, I like to keep tracks below 5mb cos I have so much music and only have PC speakers so have no need for high quality music

I only uploaded when I noticed to my suprise there were so many non genuine versions of the album and only one offical without split tracks

but thanks for the advice, if I get time I will encode and upload at a higher quality"

,sleeeepyhead,2010-12-12T03:37Z,"Obviously not the highest Quality but all the tracks are SPLIT like they should be!

Thank you very much OneTwoWilliams :)"
