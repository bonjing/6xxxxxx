HOWEVER many tracks sound like they were just re-encoded at 320kbps from an originally lower quality version.  The bonus track even sounds like it was re-recorded, speaker-to-mic.

SO if you care about audio quality, I would not recommend this torrent..."

4. Just Drop Dead
5. Let It Go
6. Shot
7. Relentless
8. When It Rains

11. Poison Ivy
12. Until The End
13. Fool's Game
14. Press Your Luck
15. Actin Dumb*
16. Outro

*This is the only one i don't know the real title but it's close enough. This one is very poor quality."
