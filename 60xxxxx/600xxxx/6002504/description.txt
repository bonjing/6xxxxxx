Time Capsule

The designers go back to the future this week. After meeting Iman at the National History Museum, they each select a time capsule containing items and accessories from a specific year. While going back in time to get their inspiration, the challenge is to create new, fashion-forward looks that incorporate that timeless pattern, plaid.
