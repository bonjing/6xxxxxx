Shostakovich\s masterpiece is given unusual treatment - actors perform a real movie on screen, while lip-synching to the singing of Vishnevskaya et al. Czech director Petr Weigl specialized in this technique; most of his work suffers from an overblown eroticism, but in this case it perfectly fits the story. I find this version more satisfying than filmed stage performances. I don't always feel that way - I find Helen Field's (staged) Turn of the Screw better than Weigl's, or any of the genuine movies... I'll post it some day.
