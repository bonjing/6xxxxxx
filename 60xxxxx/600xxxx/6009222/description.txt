RAZZ records 2009 - Produced by Geoffrey Leigh Tozer

this old recording was supposedly released without the approval of Beth
it is concidered an illegal issue, as she claims the rights to these tapes herself
last thing I heard was that they were taking actions against the producer
but, nevertheless, this is beth harts first cd/album.

we are treated to a forerunner project which includes 
a bluesy "Just Call Me Up" and an aching "Can't Hear the Word" 
Add in an early take on "Am I the One" and a pop-funk cover of 
"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" and this becomes a must-have album 
for fans and one which promises to make new converts as well. 

some of these songs were done on star search for those who remember her.
some of the songs sound a little dated, however; they all sound like Beth. 
its very cool to be able to hear this early material and see how similar it is 
to what she's doing now. even a couple covers done like only she can. 

i uploaded this torrent to tpb some time ago, but it got deleted right away, so I am trying again...
also check out her performances when she won the 1993 star search -lots of videos on youtube

go beth!
