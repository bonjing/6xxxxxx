Anvers
Martin loses his job as a result of the financial crisis. Together with his wife, Jasmijn, and their one year-old child, they are forced to move in with Jasmijnâ€™s parents in their flat in Antwerp on a temporary basisâ€™. The love between Martin and Jasmijn rapidly deteriorates. Martin seems to be living in a world of his own and refuses to lower himself into signing on at the employment office. He wanders through town and hangs round near the flat where they used to live. He finds a happy family there. Martin canâ€™t accept that they have the happiness that he couldnâ€™t have and decides to destroy their happiness just like his happiness was destroyed â€“ in his view. When Jasmijn finds out they arenâ€™t eligible for a new house because Martin never signed on at the employment office, it means the bombshellâ€™s been dropped.
