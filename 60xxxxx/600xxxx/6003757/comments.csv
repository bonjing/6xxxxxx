,diskpat,2011-08-10T16:56Z,"quality of this film on my pc is brilliant, but i cant get it to play on my tv, which is a la lx6900, i have had other films that have played ok.
any suggestions"
,diskpat,2011-08-18T16:29Z,"tried everything, could not get it to work, then came up with an idea!!! used CONVERT X TO DVD. i lost a bit quality, but hell with that it played great, the screen has the 2 black lines top and bottom, but better than nothing. so if you stuck. try it. hope somebody finds this usfull."
,fun2sh,2011-08-20T02:14Z,"diskpat , I had same problem with avatar   but converted it by freemake video convertor without loosing quality. it takes time but I think you can give it a shot"
,cinjaxon,2011-09-20T19:33Z,"I don't know if it's just me, but one of the videos (left side maybe?) is about exactly 1 frame ahead of the other side. It's fine within a shot, but whenever the camera switches to another shot I see one frame of a little jump every time. Anyone else seeing this?"
,diskpat,2011-09-21T17:51Z,"thanks FUN works great, can now watch in perfect quality. i d it with all my films now."
,crwdjm,2011-12-04T13:37Z,"Thanks for the download.

However the audio on this download is very scratchy and unlistenable.  I've got all the good gear, ie Latest lg 65 inch 3d tv with lastest lg blue ray 3d player.  Have got seveal of these big 3d files to work but far too many are failures.  Anyone know if theres something I can do to fix the audio on this?

Thanks"
,lorenzzo_deangeli,2011-12-13T15:24Z,"cinjaxon i notice that too, my mother didn't. That one frame is ahead of the other. I had the same problem with cloudy with a chance o meatballs i downloaded a another file and was fine! 
 What to do in those situations? I can't watch like this, it makes me fell a little sick. And i found just one other Christmas Carol in sbs 3d but is in mp4, not mkv!"
,Vittorrio,2011-12-15T23:11Z,I've had the same problem with Cloudy with a chance too. Anyone had any luck in solving this? Not sure I want to try Christmas Carol if it's going to suffer the same. It took me right lout of the movie everytime there was a scene change in cloudy
,lorenzzo_deangeli,2011-12-19T16:43Z,"i found both movies fixed christmas and cloudy but both of them are in a movies pack 3d. there are too of them from this guy RoSubbed-FL, i don't remember where found those torrents but i downloaded just the movies i wanted and they are perfect for watching. i can try to post the torrents here but i don't know how. but i'll try anyway.
