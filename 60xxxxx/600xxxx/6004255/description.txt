2001 Ten Songs About You   CD  Go! Beat 589 094-2 


At times it's hard to listen to Ten Songs About You without wondering whether this is the work of the same Ben & Jason well known for so many subtle acoustic-led tracks. The third album from the North London duo is far more lavish affair--gone are the bare guitar strums and hushed vocals that at one time found them being labelled "acoustic Radiohead". Tracks such as "Wild Things" and "See You in My Dreams" have been polished to pop perfection, while "How The Hell Do I Explain" with its lush rather than subtle string arrangements and sweeping piano accompaniment aligns them more towards Elliott Smith (appearing with his backing band) than part of the so-called "new acoustic" movement. Acts such as the Kings of Convenience and Turin Brakes may have drawn their influences from a similar array of folk/acoustic guitar legends, but Ten Songs About You merely takes those sounds as its starting point with the onus clearly on the songs--and Ben & Jason are fantastic song writers. The result is a much more focused album and while Ben & Jason may claim that this is also a less personal album (despite the title hinting otherwise), fortunately for us, it is no less an emotional one.
