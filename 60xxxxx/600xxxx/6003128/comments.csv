,Skipid,2010-12-04T04:21Z,"Doesn't work for me.

I mount with Daemon tools and when I click setup I get some message in Russian, and then I get the in-game setup menu, but I can only choose to exit or view the readme file.

Any ideas on what I'm going wrong?"
,TheBigHase,2011-01-10T17:48Z,Yep same here! All in Russian and the install window only has two options and nothing more. Is this fake? Could someone give an answer!
