BTW...thanks again for keeping the promise for Friends series in Dec...I am quite sure it will be of great quality.....my suggestion would also be to upload it as one huge torrent (at the same time allow downloaders to choose which season/episode they want..not sure if that is possible) but knowing you as much as I do...I think you will do that to keep everyone happy :)"
