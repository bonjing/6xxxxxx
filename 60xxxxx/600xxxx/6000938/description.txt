Merry Christmas II You is the thirteenth studio album and second Christmas album by American singer Mariah Carey. The album was released on October 29, 2010 and features four original songs, all-time Christmas classics and a re-recorded version of her 1994 Christmas hit "All I Want for Christmas Is You".

"Oh Santa!" is the lead single from the Christmas album. The song is written by Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Carey herself. The song premiered on AOL Music on October 1, 2010. It has been sent to radios and made available for digital downloads since October 11, 2010. The music video was directed by Ethan Lader and was filmed at the start of October 2010. The music video premiered on Carey's official website on November 2, 2010. "Oh Santa!" debuted at number one on Billboard's Holiday Digital Songs chart, giving Carey the top two spots on the chart. The original 1994 version of her hit Christmas single, "All I Want for Christmas Is You", sits at number two.
During an interview with USA Today, Carey confirmed that she had recorded the video to "O Come All Ye Faithful".

After the cancellation of Carey's thirteenth studio album/second remix album Angels Advocate, speculation began to shift onto an alleged Christmas album. Fashion photographer David LaChapelle told The Times on April 24, 2010 that he shot the Christmas album's artwork, thus confirming that Carey was indeed planning to release her second holiday album. It was revealed that long-time collaborators for the project include Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox, JohntÃ¡ Austin and Randy Jackson. Roger Friedman of Showbiz 411 said about the album, "Anyway, Mariah's Christmas album is said to be very lush, with lots of strings and no hip hop. A lot of it is said to be 'live' and there's an orchestra. So let's chew on that news, and calm down about the other. And believe me, she won't be announcing anything at Radar Online owned by the National Enquirer. That won't be happening!"

It was later announced that Carey had worked with Broadway collaborator Marc Shaiman, with Carey saying that he was her favorite collaborator since her days with Walter Afanasieff. During a press conference in Seoul, South Korea, in August 2010, Island Def Jam executive Matt Voss announced that the Christmas album would be out in November 2. Several days later, the album's title was revealed. The II represents the follow-up to 1994's multi-platinum Merry Christmas album. An accompanying DVD will also be released. Three track titles have been passed around the web; Bryan-Michael Cox confirmed through ustream that a track named "Oh Santa!" had been recorded. This will serve as the album's lead single. The song premiered on AOL Music on October 1, 2010.

In its opening week in the United States, the album debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200 with sales of 56,000 copies, surpassing the opening week sales of Carey's previous holiday album Merry Christmas of 45,000 copies, and making Merry Christmas II You Carey's 16th top 10 album. The album also debuted at #1 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it the second Christmas album to top this chart,[34] and the Holiday Albums Chart. In its second week, the album sold 30,000 copies, falling to #12 on the Billboard 200, and also fell to #2 on the Holiday Albums Chart.
