LOL NOTCH releasing new versions like every damn day, that's why i dont bother posting the release until its more stable.

AND a note.
Pretty much every single SMP server is broken, the server i play on its been down for few days now because all the mods/plugin developers cant keep up with the updates."
,NanoEntity,2010-12-03T23:50Z,"Oh and About your auto installer, its nice and all for new people.

But i still prefer zip/rar :)"
,narfdude,2010-12-04T00:38Z,"Yeah, it gets hard explaining to people who aren't really that good with computers what to do to with the zipped updates. Thats the main reason I made it."

,Dozey,2011-02-24T14:07Z,"Hey narfdude, I've noticed that you've been helping lotsa people and was wondering if you could help me? I've tried many times downloading different torrents on tpb, but always get stuck on the Mojang specifications screen, then having to end the process to close. I've also tried using anjocaido's updater but that gets stuck at the same place. Any help would be appreciated :)"
