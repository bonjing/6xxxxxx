Minecraft 1.2.6

The list of changes can be found on notch's blog: http://notch.tumblr.com

Donations can be given at http://nekio.com

The update files go in .minecraft\bin

I won't be making a full installer anymore for regular updates (mostly to save bandwidth and space). Meaning, if there is a significant change
to the games files, I might make one. If you would like the entire game, download an older version and apply this update.
