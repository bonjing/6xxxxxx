Tight ties do more than just keep someone in place. For Nyssa Nevers the rope is like a lover. It embraces her and gives her the strength she needs to endure. She relies on it. It makes her feel safe and secure in ways that no person could, even when someone is stripping away her dignity and control. Whether PD is breathing down her neck, groping her body or just whipping her until she is wracked with sobs, as long as her lover is there she knows she will be alright. And when PD leaves her there, abandoned in the cold, dark room, the rope is what supports her for what promises to be a very long night.
