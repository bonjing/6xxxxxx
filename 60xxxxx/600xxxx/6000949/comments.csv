[V],rambam1776,2011-05-19T20:11Z,"UPLOADERS NOTE  This torrent is a direct rip from the one on Demonoid, most thoughtfully upped by thedolphin13. It had not made its way to TPB yet, so I am just passing it along to increase exposure. I did not rip these myself. As of the up date, the complete DVD series is only available in PAL. These are ripped from TV, offered as is.

Read, would ya?"
