,SimpleSim0n,2010-12-03T05:35Z,"You're a complete moron polisdavid.

The instructions on this disk image don't even jibe with your stupid torrent title. I didn't need the registered preference because it a fake anyway. The program is cracked dummy!

HAHAHA what a newb you are. How the hell someone as stupid as you even got a skull is beyond me."
[V],polisdavid,2010-12-03T08:11Z,"SimpleSim0n.

I see you're the noob since you haven't upload a single torrent!

If you don't want the software, and it doesn't work for you, then just delete it, or don't download any of my torrents. I don't appreciate asinine comments like yours - PISS OFF - simple simon says..."
