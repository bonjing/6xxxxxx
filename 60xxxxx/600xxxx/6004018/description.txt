Talk Talk - It's My Life [promo].VOB



Very HQ promo music video. "It's My Life" is a song by the synthpop band Talk Talk. Written by Mark Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene, it was the title track on the band's second album in 1984. The song was released as a single in January 1984, then again in 1985, and a third time in 1990 when it finally became a hit and reached number 13 in the UK. In 2003, it was covered by No Doubt whose version also made the UK Top 20.

There are two versions of the video for "It's My Life." This first version, envisioned by director Tim Pope as a statement against the banality of lip-synching, consists almost entirely of footage from wildlife documentaries, interspersed with shots of Talk Talk lead singer Mark Hollis standing in the midst of London Zoo, with his mouth pointedly shut tight and often obscured by hand-drawn animated lines. 

The single reached number 46 in the UK charts, but did better in other countries: number 31 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one in the U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, number 30 in Canada and Netherlands, number 33 in Germany, number 32 in New Zealand, number 25 in France and number seven in Italy.
