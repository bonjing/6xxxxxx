,Zeratuhl,2011-04-10T16:31Z,"Way too low bitrate, severe block artifacting, brightness appears to be encoded in the 16-235 range rather than 0-255 yielding washed out colours and horrible contrast as well as no blacks. There also appears to be numerous broken keyframes.  If you're gonna encode shit in this low a bitrate then stick to 720p. 1080 res is just shooting yourself in the foot, especially with fail settings like the one used on your encoder.
