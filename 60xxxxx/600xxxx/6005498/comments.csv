You just need this new kernel (software) 
http://www.r4ds-r4i.com/pages/R4i-Gold-Kernel-Download.html

It's the newest one

1: First format your sdhc card (the little black one) 
2: Then put this kernel on it (the link i just say)
3:Then put any games on the card
4: Play and have fun for free

Cheers
