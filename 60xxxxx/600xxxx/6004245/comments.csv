@LaurieP
Here's a side-by-side comparison I did so everyone can see what I'm saying:

http://www.freeimagehosting.net/uploads/7c6201998b.jpg

I downloaded NYDIC's release, Absurdity's release, and Diamond's. Diamond's is the best out so far of the three. Absurdidty looks like he used the same source as these guys... Diamond's isn't perfect, but its better than the other two. I've REALLY been waiting for this one and I wanted to enjoy it as much as I could, so I wasn't willing to settle on the quality (if I could help it).

For 500MB more, you get a much better release... I'm the type of person who will go to further lengths to download high quality VBR music instead of 192-320kpbs CBR, because I think it sounds better. So take my opinion as that of someone who is pretty picky when it comes to quality.

PS... just trying to save people time so they don't download all three like I did... Not trying to bad mouth anybody's work or anything... *cheers*"

Audio was clear, but halfway through went out of sync. Fixed it easily by pausing and resuming in Windows Media Center on Xbox. So it may have been my system.

This doesn't deserve to be called a dvdrip. The video quality is BAD. The logos in the beginning of the movie are pixelated. The corners of the letters are jaggy.. Download another release, because you won't be able to enjoy this. (And I'm usually by no means that picky when it comes to quality.)

Seriously -- why is this the most seeded of the versions? It would have been considered to be a mediocre release ten years ago. Now.. it's just bad.  "
,jpmabrey,2010-12-15T04:01Z,"99 percent of the time RAYMOND has great rips.  I've never had trouble with one of the rips until this one.  I don't really know what happened, but the video is not that great, and the audio cuts out halfway through the movie.  I mean, I appreciate the upload and all, but this is definitely NOT a raymond quality release.  Anyway...it's STILL FREE.  So what if you wasted a disc or watched it halfway through....GET OVER IT.  It's free.  Did I fail to mention it's free?"
