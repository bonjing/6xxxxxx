You condemn green energy on cases like this alone? You call green energy hypocritical on cases like this alone? Losing birds to windmills is minor compared to the heavy metals released into the air and concentrating in marine life thanks in large part to coal burning. 

People who defend wind power need not be those silly granola caricatures that proponents of fossil fuel production stand up as their straw men. Wind power is a practical and readily available solution to energy production, one that can off-set the tragedies greater than a bird hitting a mill blade caused by fossil fuel based energy production."
,sinepgib,2010-12-06T02:24Z,What a wonderful torrent. What a shame someone had to defend wind power by attacking coal. People want nuclear fission. People want to finally develop nuclear fusion. People are not short-sighted. Green governments are no better than the regime of Adolf Hitler in their ideology.
