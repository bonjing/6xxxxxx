Tommy James and the Shondells - Crimson and Clover [Ed Sullivan 1969].VOB



Very HQ rare Ed Sullivan Show promo performance. The Ed Sullivan Show is an American TV variety show that originally ran on CBS from Sunday June 20, 1948 to Sunday June 6, 1971, and was hosted by New York entertainment columnist Ed Sullivan.

The program ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8 to 9 p.m. ET (originally from 9 to 10 p.m. ET, until March 1949), and is one of the few entertainment shows to have been run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades. Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; opera singers, popular artists, songwriters, comedians, ballet dancers, dramatic actors performing monologues from plays, and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville, and although vaudeville had died a generation earlier, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.

"Crimson and Clover" is a song by American rock band Tommy James and the Shondells. Written by the duo of Tommy James and drummer Peter Lucia Jr., it was intended as a change in direction of the group's sound and composition. The song features a tremolo effect on the guitar and an ending section with a tremolo effect on the vocals.

"Crimson and Clover" was released in late 1968 as a rough mix after a radio station leaked it. It spent 16 weeks on the U.S. charts, reaching number-one in the United States and other countries. The single has sold at least 5 and a half million copies, making it Tommy James and the Shondells' best-selling song. An extended version was released on the eponymously titled Crimson and Clover, and the song has been covered by many artists such as Joan Jett.

In 2006, Pitchfork Media named it the fifty-seventh best song of the Sixties.
