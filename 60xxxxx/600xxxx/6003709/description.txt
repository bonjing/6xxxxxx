Talk Talk - Dum Dum Girl [promo].VOB



Very HQ promo music video. "Dum Dum Girl" is a song from It's My Life, the second studio album by Talk Talk, released in 1984.

It was a Top 5 hit album in several European countries, thanks to the big international success of its singles (notably "Such a Shame"), but it only reached #35 in the UK Top 40 chart. In the US, the album just missed the Top 40, reaching #42.
