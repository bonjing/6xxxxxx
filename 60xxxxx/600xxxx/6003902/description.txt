The film traces the journey of Om Shashtri, an  
American citizen of Indian origin, who loses all
his wealth overnight to the global recession &  
has been asked to vacate his home by the bank   
unless he pays up $100,000 within 30 days.      
Seeing no other option Om comes to India to sell
a  small piece of an ancestral property. But    
within days of landing in India he is kidnapped 
by a 'recession-hit' underworld gang who think  
that he is still a millionaire.
