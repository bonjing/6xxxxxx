it stopped in the middle of the fight haha"
,chaiyont,2010-12-04T11:26Z,"The first few clips are pretty interesting - no rounds, no gloves, and no rules! 

And yes, the tape runs out before the end on the abbott vs oleg taktarov fight. I would have like to see that - Taktarov has the coldest eyes I've ever seen."
