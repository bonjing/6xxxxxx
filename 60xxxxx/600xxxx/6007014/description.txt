Talk Talk - Such a Shame [promo].VOB



Very HQ rare promo music video. "Such a Shame" is a song written by Mark Hollis for the English band Talk Talk's second album It's My Life (1984).

It was released as the album's second single in 1984, and became a big hit in continental Europe in 1984 and 1985, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries, and becoming a number one in certain territories (their second number one single after the remixed version of their song "Talk Talk" which topped the South African charts in 1983); but strangely this single was largely ignored in the UK. In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. "Such a shame" was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.

In this music video the band performs the song with instruments. There are also recordings of telephone boxes, houses, cars, trees and a bank in one sitting by a projector shown.
