Richard Patrick (Filter) and the DeLeo Brothers (STP) formed a super group in 2006 called "Army Of Anyone". While doing a promo tour for their self-titled debut album, one of the bands stops was at the now defunct WBCN-FM in Boston, three weeks before the official release date.  This is the result of that stop.
