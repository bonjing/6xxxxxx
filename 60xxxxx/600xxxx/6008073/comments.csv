,kroken5,2010-12-13T22:58Z,Do I need to keep the *cue* file mounted?
,Squalid,2010-12-15T17:46Z,"hehehe Dranzel, you are trying to mount a small part of a winrar archive. did you think there was 35 cds and you'd have to mount them one at a time? 
try extracting the contents of the archive and mount the result with daemon tools ;)"
,Squalid,2010-12-15T21:22Z,"well, it's not a .rar archive, but us open in>winrar and extract, then mount cue/bin"
,m4st4w1ll,2011-01-11T02:00Z,This isn't cracked so you can't save.
,quarthinos,2011-01-15T03:02Z,It's telling me the .bin is corrupt.  Are you using some funky compressor that 7zip doesn't understand?
,light24bulbs,2011-01-17T02:22Z,quarthinos: you might try right clicking your torrent and hitting force recheck
,fai-kwan,2011-01-28T11:15Z,"@Squalid I've tried your method, it just says incorrect command line or something..."
