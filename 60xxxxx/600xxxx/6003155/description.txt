The newest incarnation of James Levine's incomplete Mahler cycle; 10 cd's with all the symphonies he recorded (in London, Chicago and Philadelphia); the Second and the Eight are missing; a Tenth is included though; there are no booklet or liner notes inside this box; I included the scans of all the artwork, as usual; the music files are flacs made with eac; cue sheets & logs are included too; happy listening!


Enjoy and Seed!!
