Rock cover of Mariah Carey's song All I Want For Christmas Is You performed by Chicago rock group, Authority Drive.

While rather new to the scene, Authority Drive have been together in some capacity for over 8 years. As Authority Drive, they feel they have perfected their brand of alternative/pop rock and are challenging themselves to bring it to the masses one person at a time. This song is a perfect sample of their sound as they bring their energy to the song without losing the feeling or trampling the holiday nature of the tune.

You can check out Authority drive at any of their websites

Merry Christmas!
