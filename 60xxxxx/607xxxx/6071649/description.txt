These are my backups from my original release of Final Fantasy VII.They are working and 100% complete. Ripped, compressed, tested, and uploaded by me. You wont find this torrent anywhere but here.

I tested each disc using two methods. The first was epsxe 1.7.0. The second was the swap trick using a slim ps2 (backup burned at 4x). I didnt run into a single issue. All the discs worked great. If you have any questions at all, feel free to comment. And if you can, please seed. This is a wonderful game and needs to be shared with the world.


**Read Me**

First, extract the files.

For Epsxe:
1)Click File
2)Click run iso
3)Select .img from the disc you want to play

Burning:
1)Pick a burning program (alcohol 120, imgburn, etc...)
2)Insert blank disc
3)Burn no faster than 4x

You can use the burnt game with epsxe (Run Cdrom) or a playstation. The playstation will need to be modded or use the swap trick. Check google for more specific instructions.
