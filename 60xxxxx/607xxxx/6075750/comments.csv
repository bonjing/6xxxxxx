PC version"
,motley666,2011-01-01T17:17Z,"It doesn't work, there was no pc version, i think it runs emulated but i've only managed to go the menus by pressing ""enter"". Then i press all buttons and it doesn't start."
,waragsham,2011-01-01T17:58Z,"@motley666

you only use 4 buttons D,X,A and backspace

D for enter
X for Jumping
A for sliding
backspace for Previous menu
and for a higher jump hold up arrow and X for jumping"
