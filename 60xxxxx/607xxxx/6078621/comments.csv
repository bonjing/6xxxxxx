,ro4eva,2011-01-30T22:28Z,"LOL HDLiTE your releases are perfect except for one thing.  Your subs (the English ones at least) half of the time are either missing or are so badly synced they could cause someone to develop A.D.D.

For anyone downloading this release (which as usual has top notch audio/video like all HDLiTE releases), grab these English subs instead if you find you're not happy with the ones included in the release:
