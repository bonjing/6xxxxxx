Real World Adobe Illustrator CS5

Real World Adobe Illustrator CS5 is the definitive reference to Adobes industry-standard vector graphics software. With an easy, engaging style, author and past Illustrator product manager Mordy Golding takes readers through all of the features of the program, explaining not only how to use the multitude of features but also why and when to use them. This edition has been thoroughly updated for Illustrator CS5 and includes techniques on using the new perspective tools to draw, move, scale or duplicate objects in perspective. This edition also covers the refinements to Illustrator's drawing tools, such as its Stroke panel and brushes, including the new Bristle Brush for painting, as well as the Shape Builder tool, which makes it easier to merge, break apart, or modify objects. The multiple artboards that were introduced in CS4 are easier to manage in CS5, with a full Artboards panel
