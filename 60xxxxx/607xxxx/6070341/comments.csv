yes - that would be great!
You can't really see the difference in picture quality.
Probably not even hear the difference to a 448 AC3..."

Well I do see a difference. You must have a crappy setup to claim this.

Actually, I want this rip to be even bigger, 6.5Gb DTS rips are the best for 720p."
,coolash007,2011-01-07T21:08Z,"@FEDORTPB33

it will work, once you convert it using converter Mkv2vob, which u can download from internet."
,DontPissMeOff,2011-01-08T13:24Z,"@ sskapse
Could you tell me, why you would like to watch it compressed? Can't you download DVD rip?"
