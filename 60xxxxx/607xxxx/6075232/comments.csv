,dnelsonn,2012-03-22T05:41Z,"the quality of this torrent is AMAZING. but i'm having troubles with the audio. just 5 minutes in and there is missing audio, and the video continually glitches. not sure if it's the torrent or just my computer. overall still an awesome torrent even for the time it took to download"
