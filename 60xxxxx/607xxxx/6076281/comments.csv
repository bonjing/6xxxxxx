""I have BluRay,so you can choose between 500 or 700 MB. I don't rip BluRay to 272p anymore (only as pair to bigger release) - so, say: is it OK?""

Sorry it took me so long to answer - I was at a friend's place and she has a very dodgy internet connection. But I would be happy with any format or size you choose - whatever you think is best.

And thank you so very much - am very excited to see this movie and I greatly appreciate it!

And HAPPY NEW YEAR!!"
