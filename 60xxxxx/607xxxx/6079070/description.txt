Two people take off into the bush with a map, a compass and a head start. The
tracker is on horseback, armed with a local guide and an arsenal of forensic
skills. The prey have 36 hours to reach a finish line some 40 kilometers away
without getting caught. How they escape is up to them.

Wow! Season 5! Mantracker ramps it up with wilder prey and tougher terrain for
even more adventure! We return to Big Bear, California, and Grand Cache,
Alberta, but we also travel to the slopes of the Mauna Loa Volcano on the Big
Island of Hawai'i. We scale the Cariboo Mountains of British Columbia and tackle
the fierce forests of Temagami, Ontario, as well as stopping in for a chase or
two with our old friend Phil in Elliot Lake.

The match-ups this year are all about tough; but it's not always visible on the
surface. We've got brothers and sisters, best friends and band mates, even a
mother and son! Some got their training in the army, others from the street, but
they all come up with new and imaginative ways to trick the tracker.

The prey are out for glory ... and Mantracker is out for blood!
