,dawnthief,2011-04-30T20:06Z,Dude - please upload season 6 episodes
,wnysteel,2011-06-29T22:31Z,would love season 6 when you get a chance. it just finished i believe.  thanks!
,k3nd00d,2011-07-07T09:53Z,Season 6 has not even started yet!
,k3nd00d,2011-07-07T10:14Z,"OK, looks like season six has been airing in Canada on OLN. I don't have access to OLN and can't yet find any random episode uploads anywhere. I'll keep looking out for them, maybe they'll come to Sci Chan soon."
,k3nd00d,2011-07-07T12:50Z,"I found this in an article and it is talking about Mantracker on Science Channel. ""Season 6 of Mantracker is set to premiere  fall of 2011."""
,k3nd00d,2012-04-17T16:49Z,"I have Season 6 except I am missing eps 3, 8 & 9 (of 12 eps). Not sure if I should put them up individually or all together as a partial Season 6 single torrent. Thoughts?"
,k3nd00d,2012-04-17T16:50Z,"Or, I could wait until I find the missing 3 eps."
,K4YM1K,2012-05-02T00:25Z,"The episodes ripped from the Science Channel are kinda retarded, in that they censor every frikkin thing, even when someone says 'crap'
It's WAAAY better on OLN, they don't even censor the word shit."
