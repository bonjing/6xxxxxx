Notes:

ATB will be dropping the sixth edition of his extremely good mix compilationseries before 2010 is out
Three discs full of the finest electronic beats hot in the record box of ATB at the moment for you to enjoy

Running short of a mix compilation to get your New Years Eve party going with a boom this year?
Well, make sure you nip out to the record store during the day because ATB has the ideal solution
His mix compilation series has been running a few years now and will be notching up its sixth edition before 2010 is out
Not only a highlight of the DJ skill that ATB possess it s also an expression of the music he plays out all over the world in some of the
biggest clubs on the planet
His last compilation came during the Summer with his Sunset Beach DJ Sessions which portrayed the more relaxed side of ATB
His mix series is far from it but a throttle journey through the very latest trance and progressive at ATB s disposal

He's really spoilt you with his new mix as he's got three discs to entertain you with
Featuring new tracks form himself and records from the likes of The Thrillseekers, Bjorn Akesson, Oliver Smith, Sneijder
Ferry Tayle, Andy Diguid, Juventa, Dash Berlin and Filo & Peri
Have a look at the tracklist for yourself below and I think you will agree it s very impressive
It s a super way to end the year and an even better one to start the new one
