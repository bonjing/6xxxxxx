,movieguy123,2011-01-03T00:08Z,"Hey HolyRoses Thanks for putting all the movies you do on here. I just got the new ipod touch 64 gb and I am loading it with all the movies you've uploaded. I know you probably get asked to put movies on here, and I was wondering if you could put seasons 2, and 3 of ""merlin"" on here (for hanhelds). Cause I can't watch them off netflix.
-Thank you."

I connect my PSP to an LCD tv to enjoy your uploads when I visit my gf, so... as the PSP is capable of 720*980 playback it would be nice to be able to convert some of my movies to mp4 to take with me ;)"
