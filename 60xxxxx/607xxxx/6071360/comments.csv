,msmmpts,2010-12-29T16:07Z,Is it dvd rip?
,msmmpts,2010-12-29T16:18Z,why are the comments not displayed?
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T16:58Z,"The comments can take a little time after beeing writed to beeing showed with normality , this work is about the clean of borring particles alojated on the background of the screenplay , a xvid converted cam or original cam at the time of the recording donÂ´t get the correct filters to turn the recording free of screen particles , with the dub plugins correctly applied that borring particles are cleaned from the screen , then you get the same picture but without the borring particles with a better clear viewing to watch the picture ."
,msmmpts,2010-12-29T17:14Z,When will the HD and dvd quality released?
,beatles9999,2010-12-29T17:52Z,I really don't see much difference wait for the r5/dvdrip
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T18:15Z,To beatles9999 : wait... just wait and i am waiting with you .
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T18:27Z,"The true is that me or all of you didn´t mind to get real dvd-rips faster as possible from the nice movies but that is not easy as that to happen special all the time , the best possible is nice recorded cams maybe with correct plugins applied to help the viewing that´s all , certainly maybe in sometime better copys can be available to download but it is always an uncertain time to wait for that , so to watch at home better as possible this is the best way under the circunstances for undetermed time .

Cheers . "
,namorax2,2010-12-29T19:17Z,this guy is so fake........
,cerealwriter,2010-12-29T21:22Z,"The quality is still sub par, regardless of all the hard work put in by globeplus. No difference for me between this divx codified file and the rest of the Potter cams that have already flooded the web."
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T22:19Z,"To cerealwriter :  sorry , i can´t agree with you , you really feel the nice clean picture , what you can say is that the video is not a DVDrip maded from a movie DVD bought from a store , but for a codified cam the picture is really acceptable . "
,RareNinja,2010-12-30T10:36Z,same shitty cam copy.... dont waste ur time
,bonzai37,2010-12-30T13:52Z,"Globe

Even though you did some work to it you still should put cam in the name.

,PrettyNPink,2011-01-15T16:18Z,"to all these people complaining, stop whining and if you want to be sure, google the film first and check if the dvd is released or not. then wait for some saint to upload it for your lazy asses.  I don't see why you u keep complaining for free movies like this??? for someone like me, who misses the film a lot after when i watched it on the cinema, i have to get this copy just to watch it again at home.  If you want a great copy, wait for the DVDrip. don't download this and quit yanking. oh, and btw, give globeplus a break, at the least he didnt CLAIM it as a DVDRIP in the title, right???  its' your presumptious dumb asses that mistook it for a dvdrip.  stupidity begets stupidity.

btw, thanks for the upload. i have to give credit for a small file and it's more than 2hrs of film.  better than other uploads that take 1.4gb of my precious HD space."

,akaismac,2011-01-22T23:00Z,"cheers mate !
what in God's name is wrong with u ""pirates""? complaining about an extraordinary effort done by an individual who doesn't need ur approval but just loves the spirit of sharing. it's P2P **ckers, anything shared in here is pure unnecessary effort
so take it or leave it and if u can't do anything better SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GO ROT SOMEWHERE ELSE & better would be to go see it in cinemas where u can find the quality u're looking for !!
GLOBEPLUS: Thanks man, good quality enough for me
doesn't mean i won't download the dvd release once available but this is great ;)
Cheerio !"

Sound is too low - I have turned up the pre amp and the local volume.  Most donwloads have low volume but this one is a real test of ones hearing.
