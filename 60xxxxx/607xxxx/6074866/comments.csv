@frapper101: I am encoder too, 'quick-reaction' uploaders just do torrents - 5 seconds max. and I need a day for encoding. As matter of fact - this one is second encoding, I wasn't satisfied withe quality of first one - and I done it again...

Therefore, quality cannot be beaten. In 700 MB category, of course."

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-31T16:27Z,"@kkiran020630: Nope... ""dude"" was called motherfucker regarding Spartacus (was my semi-regular show) as many times as for all other torrents combined. 

""Dude"" knows who the Spartacus fans are.

""Dude"" also have learned that calling ""dude"" someone who should do a favor - is most likely doomed to fail."

,laurah2727,2011-01-04T09:02Z,Thank you very much for this download.  I have never had a problem with any of yours till now.  After I have converted CD1 and CD2 and put them on a disc - CD1 is terrific.  CD2 is not.   At the start of CD2 you can hear someone speaking but the movie does not move forward.   I even went through the chapters and there is no sound throughout the movie.  Can someone help me please.  Thanks
