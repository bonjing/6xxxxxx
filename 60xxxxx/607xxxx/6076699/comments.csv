Just one question. 
I think mp4 container is better and recognized by most media players and devices. 
Why mkv container ?
Thanks for the encode.
Downloading.........."
[T],frapper101,2011-01-02T13:54Z,"job of containers is d same
ya i do agree wit the fact dat .mp4 has more recognizing devices as compared to .mkv
but yes i will be using mp4 container for small size tv series
wud b avoidin it 4 movies though...
:)
P.S: mkv definitely sounds beter than mp4 LOL"
[T],frapper101,2011-01-02T14:03Z,"may opt for the change in d container if it is desired by sumbody (not all but a specific upcomin encode)
