Developed in Berlin by UK electro/techno producer Vector Lovers, DR1 is a synth that is designed to provide a rich and powerful sound. With a back to basics ethic, the DR1 control interface is intuitive and simple, and free of clutter. Dual Lo- and Hi-pass filter pads and resonant oscillator phasing generate fat electro bass sounds and synth leads.

Inspired by, and tested alongside, vintage analogue hardware (from Moog, Octave, Polivoks) the DR1 doesn't claim to emulate a particular synth but has its own classic sound - proven live on club sound systems (at Arena Berlin and The Loft in Barcelona) and on recent output from Soma Records and DS93 (the vinyl-exclusive label of Techno pioneers The Black Dog).
