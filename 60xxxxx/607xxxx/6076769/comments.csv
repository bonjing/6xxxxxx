Unless you use the activators included in the folder after installation?

I am asking this because I want to know if I can use the ISO only for the installation with no activation process during installation."

The In All Of My Operating Systems The .ISO File Has The Activator In It, That's Make Things Alot Easier So You Don't Haft Too Back Up The Activation Program On A Clean Install ;)"

Same problem was with me a long time back and I worked out that if you burn with maximum speed none of the windows installations discs work properly but if try with a lower speed(X4 or X2), it is sure to get burned at the first go itself!"

,j2progeny,2011-06-08T16:14Z,"i did not try having a bootable disc out of this but rather run the ISO file and upgrade the existing OS even if you have Vista installed or other previous versions of OS in your pc/laptop... in this way you can update your OS with the use of the internet... Usually it will say ""DO NOT TURN OFF YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION"" throughout the whole upgrade and installation... 
When it goes to asking with the serial keys - just cancel it and proceed without entering the serials... (You can activate this copy of windows after installation with WINDOWS VISTA ACTIVATOR that can be downloaded here also in TPB).
after finishing the installation you will find out that the copy of your windows that is good for 30 days only or simply the trial version... there are two things how to make your OS genuine. all you have to do is do one of the following:

1) download here at TPB the WINDOWS VISTA ACTIVATOR and run it to make your OS geniune, but remember that not all WINDOWS ACTIVATOR are working most of the time, so you should check out all of them... to find out if it's working is to check the windows information system if it has been activated, but if not then try another one... be patient...
 ***most of the antivirus will regard the activation tool as virus even though it isn't... just ALLOW it.
2) another way to make your windows genuine is to download REMOVE WAT or Windows Activation Tool Remover software. this will remove the program that identifies your windows OS as either genuine or not...

try these 2 ways to find out GENUINE COPIES with your system too...

*** i would also recommend using the WINDOWS SECURITY ESSENTIALS as your antivirus cuz its lighter and user friendly too especially to those who download softwares or games that have CRACKS included..."
,j2progeny,2011-06-08T16:21Z,"in addition to what i have posted earlier.. you may download updates to your system without having problems with the piracy thing...
and even if it makes your OS NOT GENUINE, you can run the WINDOWS ACTIVATOR or run the WAT REMOVER to have GENUINE copies again and again..."
,j2progeny,2011-06-08T16:27Z,"@ mikelopez

you have to download another WINDOWS VISTA activator to remove the tower thing that you are saying... just run the activator... will ask you to restart the system and you will notice that it will disappear and even make your windows copy genuine... you can also use this activator to make your windows copy genuine if later in time the microsoft would identify your copy not genuine... HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU"
,j2progeny,2011-06-08T16:51Z,"to everyone who posted here, hope this will help your probelms somehow guys.....

fresh INSTALLATION or UPGRADES from older versions will most likely make your DRIVERS not to function properly because some drivers like the Ethernet, Videocard, Soundcard, etc have compatibility problems with diffferent OS...

in order to fix these problems you have to have the DRIVERS cd/dvd. these are usually available along with the whole package as you buy your laptop or PC.

or

you can download your DRIVERS to your website... i mean www.hp.com for HP, www.lenovo.com for LENOVO, etc... all you need to know is your unit model and serial number to find the correct Drivers for your unit...

or

you can download DRIVER GENIUS or DRIVER SCANNER softwares (available here at TPB) to help you find automatically your computers DRIVERS.

***it is important that atleast you have the ETHERNET driver at hand cuz this is the most important driver for you to access the net."
,j2progeny,2011-06-08T17:02Z,"i suggest not to DL all the programs that were uploaded here but rather only the Windows Vista file.. uncheck the others but you can upload them if you want...
some files here are not working anymore like LIMEWIRE... BEARSHARE is not worth it cuz they most of the have virus on their data base, i would rather choose frostwire instead...

if you want only to download the OS just check the Windows Vista file...."
