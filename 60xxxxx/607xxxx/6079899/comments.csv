,the_modem,2011-01-13T01:40Z,"i know that 2500 books is a pain for a list, but maybe sections? fiction, non fiction, biology, sci fi, ect ect"

,divingbuddy,2011-02-05T20:01Z,"The booklist is provided as a separate file - I downloaded it first, checked the list, liked what I saw, then downloaded the collection.  Cheers!"

,bouyboy,2011-02-17T00:15Z,I'm going to put these on a nook. Do they need to be converted? Or can I just install in the nook and read?

,Dr.Blake,2011-08-06T01:41Z,how well does this work with the nook? i know some formats are more ideal than others
,goofbox,2011-08-22T02:14Z,you are amazing thank you!!! 
,Volomon,2011-08-30T19:46Z,I understand why books are missing that are not released what I don't understand is why books are missing that are already released in the series or is the series tag wrong about book X actually being book X in a series and rather just book X on the universe.  For instance World of Warcraft books or Warhammer books saying book XIV of Warhammer.
,RoyTheBrit,2011-11-27T16:26Z,How do you download this and open with Calibre-ebooks?
,neiltomo2000,2011-12-06T10:23Z,"awesome, thanks. oh when using calibre instead of adding them all individually, add books. select the folder where they are all stored and search .epub
then just shift select all and add :-)
this might only work on Mac im not sure about pcs sorry."
,zoffix,2012-05-31T01:08Z,"That you so much, for this awesome download!"
