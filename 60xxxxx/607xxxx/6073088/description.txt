West Coast Seattle Boy - The Jimi Hendrix Anthology tracks Hendrix's remarkable journey from little known R&B sideman to international stardom through an unprecedented assemblage of previously unavailable recordings. 

This long-awaited career-spanning box set is not a collection of existing Jimi Hendrix albums but instead 45 unreleased Jimi Hendrix live and studio recordings including demos and alternate versions of songs from Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold As Love, and Electric Ladyland. West Coast Seattle Boy includes Hendrixâ€™s never before heard version of Bob Dylanâ€™s â€œTears Of Rage,â€ solo acoustic recordings of Electric Ladyland favorites like â€œLong Hot Summer Nightâ€ and â€œ1983 (A Merman I Shall Turn To Be)â€as well as never before heard live performances from Berkeley and the legendary Band Of Gypsys Fillmore East concert on New Yearâ€™s Eve 1969 combined together with such new Hendrix songs as "Hear My Freedom," "Hound Dog Blues," "Lonely Avenue" and more. 

The crown jewel of Legacy Recordings' monumental Jimi Hendrix catalog project, West Coast Seattle Boy - The Jimi Hendrix Anthology is the first Hendrix collection to bring fans access to a comprehensive treasure trove of previously unreleased recordings -- including demos, alternate takes, live concert jewels and more -- from all phases of the artist's recording career (1964 -1970). 

West Coast Seattle Boy - The Jimi Hendrix Anthology offers the most complete collection of Jimi's pre-Experience R&B performances (including his singles with the Isley Brothers, Little Richard, Don Covay, King Curtis and more) to ever be officially anthologized while bringing together the most comprehensive and revelatory set of unreleased, fully realized songs, never before heard live performances, alternate studio takes, acoustic and electric demos and other rarities drawn from every chapter of Jimi Hendrix remarkable life and career. 

West Coast Seattle Boy - The Jimi Hendrix Anthology includes the 90 minute DVD Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Child, a new documentary directed by the Grammy award winning Bob Smeaton (Beatles Anthology, Festival Express, Beatles: The Studio Recordings). The acclaimed documentary tells Jimi's incredible story in his own words. The documentary features some of Jimi's greatest performances as well as rare and never before seen footage and photos. Jimi Hendrix: Voodoo Child also includes--for the first time everâ€”examples from the Hendrix family archive of the late guitaristâ€™s personal drawings, postcards home to his father, song drafts, sketches, and lyrics. Jimi's interviews and private writings shed new insights within the extraordinary life and career of the greatest guitarist of all time.
