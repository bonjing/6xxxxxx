such an awesome transition between the drawn-out repetition of their earlier albums and the more succinct sounds of their later ones. strikes the perfect balance between eminently mellow instrumentals and vocal-driven passages. standout tracks would be 'it's all about us', which shows the amanset's gorgeous, wordless genius at its best, 'weather report', one of their sharpest, catchiest numbers, and 'the golden band', one of the softest, most delicate pieces in their discog.
