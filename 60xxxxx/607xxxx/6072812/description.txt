This is the third graphic novel continuing the story of Joss Whedon's Firefly/Serenity series.  I couldn't find a torrent for it on this site, so I found it elsewhere and I'm posting it here for the convenience of you, my fellow downloaders.  Enjoy, and keep writing letters to Fox to bring back Firefly!

The comic is in cbz format, and I have included in this torrent a handy-dandy cbz reader program that you can DL if you want.  If not, simply change the extension from cbz to zip and decompress as usual.
