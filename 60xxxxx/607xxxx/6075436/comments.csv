Patch works and program starts, but DVDFab does not see my source drive, but it does see the Target drive when trying to back up DVD's and BD's.
I uninstalled this and reinstalled the previous version 8.0.6.5 which works perfectly.
Somebody please verify this issue.  "

Correction to my last post. It won't open my DVD drive.  You are correct.  It Force Closes whenever I attempt to do so.  Must be a bad ""crack""."
