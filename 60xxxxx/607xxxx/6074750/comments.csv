,OGuy,2011-03-26T15:46Z,"Hey, I'm having the same problem as ""lolftw432"" was, but I can't seem to get rid of it.
Any help?

Much appreciated, thx."
,OGuy,2011-03-26T16:21Z,"Oh, I got it fixd as well.
So, everyone else possibly encountering the same problem:

1. Do as the instructions say.
2. But don't just paste the crack files into the AVS4YOU file. Open that file and find the AVSvideoeditor-file and paste the video editor crack there and AVSscreencapture-file and paste the screen capture crack there.
I made an err and just dumped both of 'em into the main folder.

So there, and huge thanks to KK for uploading this, I'm so relieved ;)"
