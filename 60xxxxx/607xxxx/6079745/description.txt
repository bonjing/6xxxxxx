Notes: Gordon Smith has been around the UK blues scene for closer 40 years now, having originally made his debut on the legendary Blue Horizon label. Smith is regarded by some as the finest British acoustic blues guitarist. Described by John Peel as 'The foremost white blues guitarist in the world', Gordon is also one of the country's greatest blues vocalists. High praise, indeed, but richly deserved, as Smith's album aptly demonstrates. The 14 tracks are all covers, and the composers will be familiar to anyone with more than a passing interest in prewar blues. The selection of tunes is a good balance of the well known with the not so well known, and encompasses a range styles. Smith does all the singing, guitar and slide playing, and adds some nice unamplified harp on St.Louis Jimmy Oden's 'Going Down Slow'. The only other musician who appears is Bernie Pallo who contributes accordion to a rousing rendition of Leadbelly's 'Goodnight Irene'. This album confirms Smith's status as one of the hidden treasures of the British blues scene, who deserves wider recognition.
