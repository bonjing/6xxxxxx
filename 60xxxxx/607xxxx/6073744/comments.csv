,ROYALSPIN,2011-03-26T07:23Z,Thanks for this.For some reason my Firefox browser is all messed up which was caused by a security flaw by non else than Adobe so after I did my update I was no longer able to download certain files.The download manager is a joke.So going direct ?-I like.This is one reason why peer to peer will never die.
