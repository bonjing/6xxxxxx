Notes: Born in Washington, John Cephas was raised in the Virginia town after which he's nicknamed. He played for house parties with his cousin, the formidable, unrecorded David Talliaferro, until the '60s, when he became a civil service carpenter. In the mid-'70s, Cephas re-emerged, working with pianist Big Chief Ellis. They were joined by singer and harmonica player Phil Wiggins in 1976, and when Ellis died in 1977, Cephas and Wiggins became a duo,since when they have toured the world. Wiggins is a self-taught player, who developed his style working with street singer Flora Molton. Acutely conscious of the need to keep tredition and heritage alive, the two men have worked with prisoners and addicts, and in educational programmes. Cephas serves on the board of the National Council for the Traditional Arts.
This was recorded at Cephas home, but the recording quality is first-class, and both men are keen to display their instrumental accomplishment and a broad, largely traditional repertoire. Cephas immediately establishes himself as a terrific guitarist; occasionally he stumbles, but this is a mark of adventurousness, rather than a problem. Critics on autopilot describe Wiggins playing as call-and-response; in fact he plays a busy, arpeggiated version of melody line both behind and between Cephas vocals. On this disc he's hyperactive, and although his ability is evident, it's a relief when the treadmill occasionally slows down.
