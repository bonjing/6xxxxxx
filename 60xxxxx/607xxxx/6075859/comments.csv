,tonnyco,2011-01-03T02:10Z,I THINK YOU NEED TO CONTACT AT&T IN  ORDER TO ADD THE 360 MAC ID  IN YOUR ACCOUNT.
,pleaseseedme,2011-01-04T03:39Z,"Running it through abgx360 shows that you will be banned from xbox live without a doubt, if it even runs on a flashed xbox. Hope no n00bs tried to play it. Looking in the .ISO, I find Application.DAT, IpTVClient, and default.xex. Internet Protocol Television (IpTV) Looks like the main data."

I don't think your word has a lot of crediblity. Mine doesn't either lol But if you haven't run it through your xbox how are you to say that you will get banned."

This is not a hack, or homebrew. This is the AT&T install disc. It doesn't connect to xbox live. It connects to the AT&T IPTV network.

This isn't a hocus pocus magic act.

THANKS FOR A SOLID UPLOAD"
,apwhitelaw,2011-01-17T16:20Z,"@pleaseseedme    It's not like it's a regular game so it's not gonna get a good check through abgx360. Anyways this is kinda useless considering you still need the receiver, etc. which come in the $100 package."
,mudajama,2011-01-18T01:35Z,It works but somehow you need to get uvesre to regognize the box as a stb.
,sirluck,2011-01-25T15:54Z,"Of course you must  be a uverse subscriber for this to work.  You must have the correct signals.  If your home wiring has an ethernet jack near the xbox, you just connect that to your xbox and you will be able to get both xbox live and uverse through that single connection.
You do NOT need the hardware in the kit (adapter, remote control) if you have an ethernet jack according to http://www.att.com/support_media/images/pdf/uverse/p3_Xbox_intsallation.pdf
That said, I haven't actually tried this yet."
,sirluck,2011-01-25T17:37Z,"Okay, tried it...didn't work.  The software installed fine (I just burned an iso onto a CD using ImageBurn and the 360 recognized it fine and ran the install).  Once you try and initate, it attempts to authorize your machine for the Uverse network.  Uverse looks at the MAC code to decide if that hardware has been registered.  It will say the hardware needs to be provisioned and to contact customer service.  When you call them, they will tell you that you have to buy the hardware and have it installed by a tech so you end up paying for the hardware and installation fee anyway.  They could authorize your xbox over the phone if they wanted to, but they won't.  In the end, this is a waste of time."
,WhomRU,2012-03-11T03:45Z,I can Say that I installed the app and got the message that my client was unprovisioned. I called AT&T Uverse and acted dumb and said I installed from the disk provided and got this message. they transferred me to tier 2 support which just reset my account to recognize a new xbox for provisioning. No $99 fee for me. Thx so much guys.
