[T],MelloYello,2011-01-04T07:19Z,"@DeadQueen  Are u serious?  It is a Screener.  Says in it's description.  You the Academy Awards?  They are in March.  These are sent out people who vote on the Oscars.  Why else do you think we are getting to watch copies Screener copies of True Grit, The Fighter, Black Swan and I'm sure others.  These movies haven't even been out a month yet.  ""For Awards Consideration ONLY"" is exactly what it means.  These are leaked copies.  Now you know Noobie."

It would only confuse him more if not corrected."
