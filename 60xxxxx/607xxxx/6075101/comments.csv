,schmim64,2011-01-01T14:26Z,yea it's legit.  Sorry it's so big.  But it does contain literally every picture and video from her site.  I even had to lower the quality of the videos a bit to make it smaller otherwise it would have been more like 20gb.

,schmim64,2011-01-02T13:39Z,yeah hmm
,schmim64,2011-01-02T13:57Z,It's some kind of glitch on piratebay from the looks of it.   h t t p (colon) (2 forward slashes) bit  (dooot) ly  (forward slash) eIOMPL  
,schmim64,2011-01-02T13:58Z,^ can download the torrent there
,schmim64,2011-01-02T18:16Z,"or just click ""magnet link"" instead of download torrent"
,pstrnutbag44,2011-01-02T18:24Z,Appreciate the help. Magnet Link isn't working for me either. You said something about a glitch with what looks like a work-around underneath. How do I do that?
,pstrnutbag44,2011-01-02T18:58Z,Got it! Thanks!
