Encoder's Note's
Ok, so imagines copy was a ts but it was mislabled.
(if you dont belive me ask any imagine encoder)
I watched a bit of imagines and its not great, it had loads of noise, it was dark,
the colours looked a bit off & it looked a bit blurry.
So i dropped it into vdubmod, i de-noised it then i increased the brightness,
contrast & gamma.
After that i changed the colours with a rgb eq & sharpened it.
Now i know that doesnt sound like a lot, but it made a big difference.
It still has a bit of noise, de-noising anymore would of made it look even more blurry.
Beetween de-noising & increasing the gamma i have lost a bit of detail.
I left the audio untouched as im no good with audio.
Well my encode is watchable, if you cant wait for the r5 (or better) then grab it.
Also imagines copy wasnt complete it had a few bits missing so mine is the same.
Not every1 will prefer my copy to imagines, here is a screenshot comparison beetween them  http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/15623
Without your mouse on the image its imagines, with your mouse on the image its mine.
To change frames click on a number just above the image.
With all of that said, Enjoy another Kingdom Release.
