This is the navigation DVD 6.62A update for Honda.  This was out in late 07 for the 08 model year and it should work on Civic, Fit, Element and CR-Vs.  Not sure about other Honda models.  It was up before once but now it's gone and since I was making a backup DVD of mine, I decided to share it because I know there are some people that don't have a navi disk at all.


How to burn disk:

Use WinRAR to unpack files onto a folder

If you don't already have imgburn or an iso. burner program, go ahead and install imgburn.(program supplied)

1. Insert a blank dual layered DVD in your dual layer burning drive

2. Open imgburn and choose "write image file to disc"

3. Click on the "browse for file..." folder icon, choose the MDS file(not the iso.) or simply click and drag the MDS file to imgburn  

4. Choose a write speed of 8x or under 

5. Click on write icon and wait til dvd is burned

6. Test out the navi DVD 

7. Enjoy!
