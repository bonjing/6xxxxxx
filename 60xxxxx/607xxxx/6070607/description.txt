 Due to the commercial underachievement of Aerosmith's 1973 self-titled debut, the 
 young band was nearly dropped by their record label. But a rigorous touring schedule helped strengthen their songwriting and tightened their playing even further, so after Columbia wisely decided to back the band again, the classic, Get Your Wings, was released. It didn't prove to be the sudden commercial breakthrough that Tyler and company hoped for, but it did go gold one year after it's release and set the stage perfectly for 1975's Toys in the Attic, which would propel Aerosmith into the rock & roll stratosphere. Comparing Get Your Wings to the 1973 debut is like night and day; it sounds almost like a completely different band -- the playing is more aggressive, the songwriting succinct, and singer Steven Tyler had almost fully perfected his instantly recognizable yowl. But the sleaze and grit remained -- "Same Old Song and Dance" combines a nasty blues groove with a tale of a drug deal gone bad, both "S.O.S. (Too Bad)" and "Lord of the Thighs" are straight-up rockers, and "Seasons of Wither" remains the band's most haunting ballad. But the best known song is their cover of "Train Kept a Rollin'," which would soon become a perennial showstopper in concert. Get Your Wings also marked the first time that producer Jack Douglas worked with the band; he would remain on the controls on nearly all of their future '70s hits.
