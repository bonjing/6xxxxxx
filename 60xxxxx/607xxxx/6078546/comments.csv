i just downloaded some of your old movies ,
and your movie's qualities are far better than other uploaders.
thanx man.
keep it up. "
,billylopez,2011-01-06T13:58Z,"thankyou again Mr. KickASS

I haven't watched it yet, but I'm guessing the quality is as awsome as all your other torrents'

And I can't thank you enough, for going to the trouble of adding the spanish subs....
Your work is so much appreciated, not just by the pirate community but especially me"
,arixs,2011-01-06T18:53Z,"Thanks dude... I don't understand how people go on about downloading 720p rips that go into like 2 gigs....

Could you please rip 'The Terminal'? I really loved that film...

,Phoenix-III,2011-01-07T07:21Z,"Hey thank KickAss...

The tragedy is when i see a dvd rip,I quickly download a 700 mb normal resolution version only to see a few days later you have a 720p rip ready..

XD"
