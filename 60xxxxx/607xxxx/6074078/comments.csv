,mojobaby27,2011-01-21T16:10Z,"thanks for this one. great quality video=10 and audiio=10. All subtitles can be turned on/off. From DVD.
I was having trouble backing this one up from my own dvd (all others work fine, but this one has some new copy protection - on US DVD).
So this was a great find. thanks again"
