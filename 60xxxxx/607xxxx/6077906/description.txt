495 Super Mario World (SNES rom) .IPS hacks.  All you have to do is download the rom, \"Super Mario World\" (USA version only!) from  http://www.theoldcomputer.com (click ROMS on left hand side.)  The most simple method I found was to rename the .IPS hack you want to play, for an example: \"MGU.ips\" to, \"Super Mario World (U) [!].ips\" (the same filename as YOUR Super Mario World rom.)  This method worked for me running Windows XP x86 with emulator Zsnes.  An alternate method is to use \"Lunar IPS\" from the official site, \"  http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/  \"  Enjoy
