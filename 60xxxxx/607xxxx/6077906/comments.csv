what did you do for these, rip the freaking site? xD
well, anyways, epic amount of IPS files"
,bluecar5556,2011-04-07T09:46Z,"Yes, the site was ripped manually.  When I have time and find an automated program that will duplicate the original SMW rom into the uncompressed folder of each .ips and change the rom's file name to match the corresponding .ips, I will recreate this torrent.  Any suggestions on such a program?  "
