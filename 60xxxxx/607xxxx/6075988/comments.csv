,usr098,2011-01-03T10:02Z,"Command to mount all these cd's in Dosbox:

imgmount d ~/Games/wc4/cd1.iso ~/Games/wc4/cd2.iso ~/Games/wc4/cd3.iso ~/Games/wc4/cd4.iso ~/Games/wc4/cd5.iso ~/Games/wc4/cd6.iso -t iso

(replace the path ~/Games/wc4 with your own of course)
Now you can switch cd's by pressing CTRL+F4"

,KimanuTHEGREAT,2011-01-14T19:43Z,"usr098, how do you switch cd's in the dosbox? When I complete Disc 1, I tried the CTRL+F4 to switch cd's and I may not have done right, so could help me get to the next disc please?"
,usr098,2011-01-17T15:44Z,"kimanuthegreat: Press Ctrl+F4 one time and it will cycle the next cd. Then press any key to continue the game. Dosbox will not give any feedback about cd chaning but it works.

(cd's have to be mounted with the imgmount command I wrote earliel) "
,usr098,2011-01-17T15:52Z,"Random observation: When you make your first time configurations, save & EXIT, then run wc4. If you save & run the game it may run very slowly. Happens to me at least."
,Funkeety,2011-08-15T11:18Z,"i'm sorry you said cd1.iso, but the files on this torrents is 7z, is that will be okay if i write iso as the extention?, sorry i'm a noob.... :D"
,usr098,2011-08-28T11:51Z,Funkeety: 7z is a compressed archive like zip or rar. You have to extract it first. Inside you have the iso. Google 7zip. Imo the best archiver.
