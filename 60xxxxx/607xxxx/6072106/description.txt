PLOT:


Jake Russell, the friendly police chief in town so small initially worries about outsider heiress Cassandra 'Cassie' Nightingale, who moved into the house held to be haunted by the 'grey lady', and opens a weird shop full with attributes of occultism, soon causing the rumor she's a wicked witch. After Cassie kindly helps his brave son Brandon (and his sissy sister Lori) with a dog, bully Kyle -abused by his own poor dad- and their own fears, Jake soon makes friends with her, even romantically interested. Yet the 'chief' is professionally obliged to handle a flood of complaints and harassment started by the mayor's mean wife, her busy bodies-bunch and teenage brats. Finally Derek Sanders, Jakes's only deputy, hits on Cassie's hidden background.

Catherine Bell (Army Wives) stars as Cassie, a bewitching woman who moves into a mysterious mansion in a small town.Soon, she opens Bell, Book & Candle, a curiosity shop full of candles, lotions, etc., and is enthralling the children of the local Police Chief (Chris Potter), who believes that she is a witch (but not a bad one!).But not everyone in town is appreciative of their quirky new neighbor, and it may take a little bit of magic for her to truly become part of the community.
