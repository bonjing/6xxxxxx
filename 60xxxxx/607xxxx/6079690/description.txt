In Our Own Time is the compelling story of the Bee Gees career. From their roots in the North West of England, through their early
career in Australia, their return to England and international breakthrough in the late sixties and then on to global superstardom with
Saturday Night Fever and beyond. Alongside the success there is the heartache of the tragically early deaths of first their younger
brother Andy and then later Maurice.
The story is told in their own words through in depth new interviews with Barry and Robin Gibb and through extensive interviews
with Maurice filmed shortly before his death in January 2003. These are lavishly illustrated by live performances, TV and film clips
and home movies of their early days.
In Our Own Time features clips of many of their greatest hits including: You Should Be Dancing , New York Mining Disaster 1941 ,
Massachusetts , Run To Me , Jive Talkin , Stayin Alive , Night Fever , How Deep Is Your Love , Tragedy and You Win Again
and their collaborations such as Guilty with Barbara Streisand and Immortality with Celine Dion.
