    Since his wife's death, Arthur, a peculiar and severe surgeon,           
    cloisters his teen daughter Lucille inside a strange mansion.            
    Desperate, Lucille tries to commit suicide and ends up with her face     
    completely burned and bandaged. Arthur, with the assistance of his       
    aunt, prepares a weird skin graft in order to give back Lucille a        
    face, a face that resembles his beloved and deceased wife. To take       
    care of her, the father then hires Joan, an attractive nurse with a      
    somber past. Lucille and Joan start a forbidden and passionate love      
    affair.
