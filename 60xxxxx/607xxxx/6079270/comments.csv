I used to watch it with my 2 step brothers one is 5 years older then me and the other is 10 months younger then me and we used to pretend we were the three ninjas when this movie and the first once came out lol. Im 23 now and I miss the good ol days...

I was shocked too! I used to watch this when I was much younger.... (now I'm 12) Maybe when I was 5! I really liked it so am going to watch it again. 

Great torrent too.
