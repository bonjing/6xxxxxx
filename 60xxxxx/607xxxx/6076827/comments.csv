,wulfy1978,2011-01-02T15:56Z,"It's a good thing you got it for free mariuspmg.  Great upload cyberpiraten, 3.164 upload ratio and still gong!!!"
,zoly15,2011-01-03T10:59Z,is it possible to upgrade??
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-03T12:24Z,"From the old version? It's suppose to be posible. 
But i recommend to delete the old version and install the new. "
,zoly15,2011-01-03T14:20Z,THNX Cyberpiraten! And what about the newest (14.0.2) update? Will it work?
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-03T14:30Z,"It's suppose to work :) But I can't guaranty anything...

Anyhow, enjoy! "
,lee0123,2011-01-04T05:46Z,"Does this ms office come with an uninstaller?

the other torrents didn't have uninstaller feature with them."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-04T08:07Z,"Nope, i don't upload uninstallers. "
,mariuspmg,2011-01-04T23:41Z,"@wulfy1978: It was a comment on the product, not the upload, if you get it!?"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-05T01:51Z,"@mariuspmg
I got iWork ready to upload, I´m just waiting at TPB to clear the hashes..."
,pirater19,2011-01-08T21:42Z,"Wow. I have no idea how the hell you did it, but after it installed, it said it activated no problem and never asked me for a serial number or anything. I also upgraded fine, opened up Excel, and it works perfectly. 
Thanks a lot!"
,geezalino,2011-01-09T05:02Z,its asking me or an activation key..did i miss something?
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-09T09:14Z,"UnInstall, reboot, try again. 
It is not suppose to ask for activation so you must have done something wrong.

Good luck :)"
,jdylan423,2011-01-11T06:54Z,"Thanks for the upload. I am having some trouble getting accounts to save in Outlook. Has anyone had trouble with this?

,mm2010,2011-01-11T12:32Z,Do you know if this is avaliable in Swedish? Are there language packs for mac as there are for Windows? Thanx for the upload!
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-12T09:06Z,"I think I'we heard about languagepacks for Microsoft Office on Mac, so you might whant to take a look ;) 

On the Outlook, I think thats a bug in the app. 
Try google."
,Rccm112,2011-01-17T06:19Z,"Work perfectly...thanx! I just have one question though. 

Is it safe to update to 14.0.2??"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-20T17:59Z,Should be.

There is no application set to open the document “Microsoft Office 2011 Retail [Mac]-[CyberPiraten].dmg.part”.
