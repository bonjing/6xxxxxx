Yuri-ly got me!  This doujinshi features Vivio and Einhart.

F91 commissioned me for a script of this manga, and another person was supposed to edit.  F91 eventually ended up editing it himself, and I gotta say, he handles the cleaning of images pretty darn good!

Many thanks to F91 for commissioning me and for doing an awesome job editing.
