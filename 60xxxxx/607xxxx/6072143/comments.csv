Expect them in next week."

I have now totally decided to limit all my archives to lossless filesets, with the much lower costs and availability for media storage... I just can not justify obtaining and saving anything but the true fidelity of the music itself. I really can not understand why people would want to continue to have music in a degraded state of quality, it might could have been explained to me about 5-10 years ago becuase of the storage question and quick availabilty of them to be obtained, but now (because of high-speed internet and media costs) neither of those reasons seem to hold much validity. I actually decided that quite a few years ago myself. But, you probably should go ahead and upload that fine music for anyone else that might wish to get it from you. Thank you again for sharing such great music and such excellent quality for all of your lisings."
