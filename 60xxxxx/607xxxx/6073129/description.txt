Tale of a Vampire (1992) - Julian Sands, Suzanna Hamilton

Set in South London, this surreal and atmospheric low-budget film takes an interesting approach to the vampire genre by focusing almost exclusively on the emotions of its tormented central character: reclusive, intellectual vampire Alex (Julian Sands). Alex chooses to prey only on criminals and street derelicts, devoting more of his time to pursue a greater hunger for books on the occult, a passion surpassed only by his tragic love for a beautiful woman whom he lost to his ancient rival, the vampire-hunting Edgar (Kenneth Cranham).Alex's past returns to haunt him in more ways than one: as he enters a tenuous relationship with a quiet, morose librarian (Suzanna Hamilton) whose sad-eyed beauty reminds him of his lost love, the still-vindictive Edgar -- now a vampire himself -- returns to settle the score by abducting her. Though leisurely paced, this seldom-seen sleeper is driven by excellent performances, gorgeous photography, and a simple but compelling script that artfully combines subtle chills with bittersweet romance (including fitting excerpts from Edgar Allan Poe's "Annabel Lee"), all draped in a fog-bound Gothic ambience of dripping candles, billowing curtains, and crumbling stone pillars.
