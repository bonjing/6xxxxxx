,spacemanspiff407,2011-01-19T23:14Z,"video is fine, audio kinda sucks tho. i guess its watchable if you don't much care about audio, but it bothers the crap out of me. sounds more like it was recorded with a mic than ripped from dvd/bluray.

works fine in both vlc and wmp. i have klite codecs tho. "
