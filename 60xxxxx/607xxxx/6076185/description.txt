Converted for you from ntsc DVD to 720 X 480 DivX 1000k video, 192k audio

This is a lovely movie from Denmark I saw here at a movie theatre some years ago.

Unfortunately, the 1hr 43 min NTSC version has no Danish audio to offer, 
however the English audio is supremely done in any event, along with French
and Danish accents as appropriate along the way.

We have included an optional srt subtitle for French 

This is a movie about the coming together of two great humanistic cultures
of the Irish spirit of Denmark and the spirit of France too! Isnt that a treat!

Should a woman who is kind and wants to be generous feel it sane to spend
her entire endowment of finances that may have lasted for ages - spend
this on a single meal for a community that has showed her some care in return?

How should they feel about such an honour and treatment during the course
of the evening?

Oh well, some folks may be overly impuslive however as long as its in the
right spirit, that should be enough I suppose. And then again, theres
no holding back on the Irish spirit no matter how much coached one might
be to practice reticece instead - for some or other supersition - at best!

Enjoy this feast of scenes of culture in a small European community
with all it has to offer the spirit and soul
