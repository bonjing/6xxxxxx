She really believe that ""God"" gave her ""Talent"", her ""Gift"" and she's ""living her dream"". It's nice that at least she is - even though she base on irrational assumptions. There were moments when I thought it is 'personality cult' of some kind (worship syle). I get the feeling that her environment keeps her in this imaginary beliefs about her self and her attributes - meaby even about her ""Destiny"". She has her personal brain wash ;D"

dramat she's just a singer/star and has her OWN thoughts. So do you and your able to believe them. We all see the news about stars and many are way out there in their ways of thinking but it doesn't make them wrong or brain washed.
anyway have a great new year everyone!!"

I've dl'ed it for myself :) I think Beyonce is a Beautiful girl and it's pure pleasure to watch her. I like her music as well. I was refering to concept of ""God"" itself and her (Beyonce) attachment to it. It is curies to watch documentary like this - it makes you realize that it all depends on what you will belive in, to what you'll convince yourself to. ""How"" you do it or based on ""what"" - it's not that important - it doesn't even has to be true. Beyonce is best example of it. And it's neither good nor bad. It's just precious lesson about ourselfs :)"
,Dramat,2011-01-05T13:58Z,"It is separate matter that her entourage facilitate and support her 'superiority complex'. 
I remember that during some interview one of her associate corected press reporter that Beonce is ""Super Star"" - not just ""Star"". I've looked and Beyonce face and she instantly agreed with it with serious facial expression. ""I have a Gift from God"" she said. "
