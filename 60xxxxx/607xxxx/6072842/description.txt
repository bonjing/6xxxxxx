Description


Introduction:
Wolves and hunters don't get along well in most situations, that's something you can be sure of in Vertra's "Hunter and Wolves" game. The hunter shall be surrounded by an encirclement of conspiracy. Only when the player can properly grasp the skills of balancing can the hunter escape through these rings of peril.

Instructions:

A hunter is savoring a successful capture, unknowing that a bigger pack of wolves are in camoflouge nearby viciously planning their revenge. The path home starts becoming difficult. As the hunter starts being ambushed from all directions, he realizes that his only hope of survival depends on escape through the player's sense of balancing the phone. now it is your job to help him to avoid the wolves and save the hunter's life as long as possible. More and more wolves will come in to challenge the hunter and ...you !

Tip A - Your only hope of survival is escaping, so try to do it with strategy. Use the gravity sensing mechanism to dodge the attacks of the red and black wolves. Red wolves react slightly faster, ever striving to surround the hunter.

Tip B - During the game there shall be three items to help escape. Some can help fight off the wolves, some can make the hunter run faster, and some can temporarily turn the hunter invisible, making the wolves lose their tracking abilities.

Have Fun!
