,warvibe24,2012-01-19T03:52Z,"I am very new to this site.  Can someone tell me what the difference between ""get this torrent"" with a magnet beside it.   A pose to the ""get this torrent""  with no magnet. "
,Ulobject,2012-01-21T08:01Z,How does the extended version differ from the normal one?
,driftBR,2012-01-26T02:05Z,"A: 8 V: 9

Best video quality I've seen for such small file size. But has no 5.1 audio."
,driftBR,2012-01-26T03:02Z,"SkiaDrakon is right, video skips 1sec few times but I'd still recommend this rip.

I just don't understand the reason naming it 720p while it's 544p."
,j0nnyboy,2012-01-29T03:28Z,thanks. looks great. 10/10
