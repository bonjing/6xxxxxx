A.Hole.in.the.Moon.1964.x264.VOi

Considered to be the first surreal movie made in Israel, and the film to start the "new Sensitivity" wave, this is one of the most important movies made in Israeli cinema history. Directed by Bohemian front man Uri Zohar, this film was revolutionary at the time of release and still stands on its own today.

The plot revolves around two delusional individuals, who somehow find themselves in the middle of the desert, where they decide to open a film studio and film the events of the new land they are building.

Jazzy-Psychedelic soundtrack, terrific supporting cast featuring most of the prominent actors of the time, and a surreal experience reminiscent of Fellini makes for an unforgettable experience.
