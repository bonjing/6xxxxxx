This album is alot more toned down and refined than I thought it would be when I first heard the album single "Presents".  Songs like "Developing Active People" and "Modern Day Saint" showcase this bands songwriting talent, however their are too many songs fronted by the female vocalist that frustrate me with their lyricism which falls flat out on it's face.  This is one of those albums that is enjoyable for a few listens, but ultimately falls out of memory in a couple weeks time
