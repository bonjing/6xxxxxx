,dlarrym1111,2011-01-01T01:16Z,"I AGREE, Thanks for an unexpected bonus for NEW YEARS!! TvTEAM always uploads top notch stuff. THANKS. I haven't got it downloaded but will comment when it does. 

JUST for the record:

Can't speak for everyone, but I am anxious to see this. The original movie has JOHN WAYNE, Robert Duvall and many other big time mega stars of hollywood and was to me a CLASSIC and of the caliber of films like:
 THE WIZARD OF OZ. I can't imagine that any director in his right mind would even consider re-doing THE WIZARD of OZ or TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, GONE WITH THE WIND, or A STREET CAR NAMED DESIRE, CASA-BLANCA, WHERE EAGLES DARE, THE GUNS OF NAVARONE w/ Gregory Peck, Anthony Quinn, David Niven or  PAPILLION w/ Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, I heard ramblings of a re make of BULLITT, another Steve McQueen Classic.  I could go on and on. I guess I always considered TRUE GRITto be in the same class and era as these other great FILMS. There has been a huge amount of redoing of older movies in the last 10 years or so. I guess its a matter of time.

TRON is being re made and is coming out very very soon. (the orig. came out in 1982 or about that time).

THE HITCHER, originally with RUDGER HOWARD was re made with SEAN BEAN as the bad guy. I heard that BLADE RUNNER is being remade (GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY, it is CLASSIC RIDLEY SCOTT and one of my all time favorite SCI-FI films. Next thing you know, they will re make 2001 a SPACE ODESSY by STANLEY KUBRIK or THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE. 
I am curious to see this TRUE GRIT and what they did with it, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit nervous of all these re makes of films that do not need any remaking. If it isn't broken, the why ""fix"" it??? HAPPY NEW YEARS ALL!!!"

It's sad how ignorant some of these people are.

First of all this isn't a remake. This is a retelling in the classic Cohen brothers style of an old story.

If you're comparing Jeff Bridges to the duke, or even this movie to the 'original' then you clearly are missing the point. You should go study films a little more before coming here talking shit about a triumph of a film.

This movie stands on its own as an instant classic. If you knew ANYTHING about 'The Duke' you would know that he would tip his hat to this incredible film."

Dude... first of all, a retelling of an old story in any way whatsoever, coen brothers or not, is technically... yes, a remake, douchebag. Second, I dont think anyone needs to study film in order to form their own opinion on the depth of the characters portrayed, in contrast to their original counterparts, but since YOU are obviously an expert in theatrical arts, why don't you jump down off that high horse for a minute and tell us this big point we are all missing. Oh and did you and the duke used to hang out on sunday or what? Or are you arrogant enough to think just watching old movies and maybe a couple of  interveiws with john wayne, and you can speak on what he would and would'nt like? All you've done is make yourself sound like an arrogant ignorant douchebag. cheers! ;)"

This isn't a remake of any movie, and that isn't an opinion. It's an adaptation of a book. The film was made to be a more faithful adaptation of the book, not the 1969 movie. You should learn to check your facts before you speak kids.

Movie 6


Thanks so much for this, TvTeam.  It is much appreciated."
,StanlyManly,2011-01-13T06:36Z,"By the way, I watched this on a 42 inch TV.  Perhaps the video quality would be much better on a smaller TV or a computer."
,globe6956,2011-01-15T05:11Z,fast and easy...thanks
,oakmario,2011-01-15T22:07Z,"For a 1.37 GB download, the video quality of this movie is terrible. The audio is good, but the video is so poor, I didn't even watch the movie. High pixellation, jaggies and stutters one fast moving scenes. Looks awful on a 50"" plasma 1080p TV.

This is not a DVD Rip. I'm not sure what it is, could be a CAM of a TV or something.

,ShipWreckMMG,2011-01-17T08:45Z,"dude why do you keep uploading shitty cam videos and labeling them as screeners? WE CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE DOUCHEBAG! uploads are always appreciated, especially new releases such as this and your ""The Fighter"" upload, and yeah there are people who do not mind watching cams and ts's... but label them correctly.

,tattooman420,2011-01-17T16:13Z,PLEASE DONT BE A NOOB>>remember how torrents work u 3770 idiots do realize if you all seeded instead of leeching and after u finish download let is seed for a couple nights IT WOULD finish a lot faster and u would be giving back a little.....19.163.217 seeders on tpb 9.667.768 leechers) 3.491.004 torrents. u all realize not a one is on this web site i have seen the user numbers go from 12 million to almost 29 million but only 3.5 million torrents? about 10 million leechers???wtf dont people teach and help noobs literally over night damn dl speeds could jump way up think if almost no one leeched?holy shit u got to give to take;i have no torrents but i seed a finished file for a month every night think of what could happen in a year or so if those big overall numbers were in favor of leechers every site u went to say 100 seeders per 900 leechers it would take forever to download but say all 900 leechers decided to upload also at the same time instead of 3 days to dl it would be done in 2 hours...syyr 4 the long comment......just a pet peeve!
,King_of_Kings,2011-01-18T04:29Z,"@tattooman420  If there weren't any leechers, there would be no downloads AT ALL.  Leechers  seed while they leech, but they're not counted as seeders until they have the full file."

,joejohnson1236,2011-01-24T20:16Z,"I agree with others - when did CAM's become Screeners? many people think it is a DVDSCR when it says SCR, but it is not. Label it as a CAM, dammit!"
,mingrady,2011-01-25T04:01Z,"I appreciate your noble effort to share your files with the public, I really do. But please, pretty please with sugar and cream on top, please don't mislabel your files ""SCR""(screener) when actually it's a grainy cam. 
"
,scalefreak,2011-01-25T16:22Z,"I am amazed at how stupid most of you are. It is a scary thought to think that many of you are legal holders of a drivers license. This is NOT a screener....it's a shitty cam. And this dumb ass system you guys use for rating things is about as useless as tits on a Vulture. If something is crap quality, it is crap quality...if it's great, it's great...whatever happened to 'it is what it is'. It's like giving a half dead horse a 7 out of 10 because it's based on him being in the category of half dead....wtf is that? I'm still laughing at how many people said this was a 7/7 or higher. WOW! It's nice to know that I could still have a career in selling lemons as apples.

,chapter81,2011-01-28T00:35Z,"I agree with NitLions. There's gotta be a pattern, a default reasonable rating behavior. 

I agree that every MOVIE is rated as a MOVIE. From bad quality to great quality. If it's a CAM, a SCREENER, whatever it is, I'll be aware of the loss in quality. But I need to know GENERALLY what the movie looks like. It used to be like this a long time ago and now some retarded people are rating ""based on a screener"", ""based on a cam"". If a CAM will never get CLOSE to a Blu Ray Rip, the maximum note is 3. Bad CAM? 1. Great CAM? 3. "
,chapter81,2011-01-28T00:42Z,"So now let's rate it in the retarded way:

As a TS:

As a CAM:

As a SCREENER:

As a BRRip:

As a DVDRip:

,zezant,2011-01-28T21:46Z,"can anyone explain to me what is seeding?
i understand that it helps to quicken up ours download speed and that is where my knowledge of that ends."
,mr_evil13,2011-01-29T04:00Z,hey
,12efr3shing,2011-01-29T16:28Z,"@zezant 
Seeding means uploading the data for other users even after you're done downloading, and not fucking off like most people do! Benefit of having more seeders is that you will have more amount of complete data to download from..

Leeching refers to uploading and downloading the data simultaneously! Leechers can only upload the data they are done downloading. So, if there are only leechers, you might not get the part of the data you are looking for, if they haven't done downloading that part yet."
