,ireallyamabum,2011-01-06T23:17Z,"Warning! If you are a day older than 8 this is not for you. Horrible acting, terrible script and also pretty much a really bad copy of the first one. Same cars, same prison and yet they say in the movie that this is the first time in history something like this has ever happened. wtf. i hope this bankrupted some poor hollywood asshole producer. "
,thechad2k8,2011-01-09T23:06Z,^^ isnt that because its a prequel?
,ohrton,2011-01-29T03:46Z,i can't skip very far ahead or choose scenes past halfway or so. vlc closes.
,ohrton,2011-02-03T11:35Z,it works. i was transferring it on my ftp with encryption it screwed up another movie too. i transferred without encryption and it worked.
