ONE PROBLEM - after installing everything, i open Magix, it asks to install soundpool libraries, i say ok, and once they're installed, i get a popup from Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library, saying there's an error, and an abnormal program termination. i click ok, and magix closes.

what the FUCK do i do."

,molly_dog,2011-08-31T04:11Z,"My last comment puked out so I'll give you the abbreviated version.....

I have hunted a workable d/l of this software for just over a month, staying up till 3-4 am every night. I can't even begin to tell you how many torrent sites I visited nor how many copies of v 15, v 16, v 17 I have d/l'd, tested, got PO'd, uninstalled d/l'd another, lather, rinse, repeat.

This is absolutely the real deal. NONE of the other files I d/l'd would get you beyond basically the Trial Version. You may not get nagged for a SN every time you launch but there were none of the advertised 3500 sounds; VitaKeys and VitaSax; BeatBox2; Revolta, etc..

Yeah, this file is almost 4 GB...mine d/l'd in under 20 min with RR Turbo. The instructions on how to make this work cannot be any more explicit...simply Install; Copy & Paste a folder; type all 1's or like I did, make up a 30-digit SN; register and install all the content then make some music! 

That's really all there is to it. The uploader, who is my personal hero of this 10 minutes, did everything for you. Thank you so much, trialanderror! There is no error! You hit the nail squarely on the head with this one!"
,molly_dog,2011-09-05T20:04Z,"Just an addendum to my previous gushing...Whenever I run the program, everything works as it's supposed to. In fact, you can go insane trying to decide which loops to use! Then I messed around and d/l'd a Sound Pool DVD and found myself with roughly 15,000+ instruments, drums, bass, on and on and on!

While the registration part works to unlock the whole 9 yards of the program, the registration/SN, not surprisingly, does not show up on the Magix web site...(I was just hoping but not expecting!)

The only other SNAFU I've encountered is a ""Runtime Error - [PGM name] - Early Program Termination."" As long as I don't click on ""Okay"" the PGM runs fine. Soon as I click on the button, though, SPLAT!, PGM gone. Just a tip, downloaders.

This is my first dance with creating electronic music and, at 50. I'm not as quick as you ""young whippersnappers"" out there 8-D.! I'm looking for every piece of documentation I can find. I've already created several songs that are, like me, waiting for my MIDI/USB keyboard to arrive in order to have melodies.

So once again, for those of you wondering whether to d/l ~4 GB, this one is definitely the real deal!A few quirks and eccentricities aside, get this file or buy it from its developer. That's the only other way to get the true full app!"

,ankiF,2011-09-27T18:29Z,Hope to see soundpool 18 soon :) Thanks!
,shazwagon,2011-09-28T13:32Z,"Thanks for a great upload! 

However, I have a problem. I had first installed the same program (Vers. 18) from this site. I uninstalled it later when the Crack did not work. 

This one installed and registered fine. But each time I try opening a sample from the program I get a message saying that the so-and-so sample 'has been deleted or moved'. I installed this version in a separate hard disk than the previous one.

Any help? Thanks in advance!"

,skyydragonn,2011-10-09T06:07Z,"Okay, several people ahve mentioned the C++ visual runtime error. After some google-fu I've found that it is not a specific problem with MAGIX itself but Windows. There are some optins regarding possible fixes posted in a thread asking about the problem. These suggestions come from a (supposed) email recieved by MAGIX tech support.
HERE IS WHAT THEY SAID TO TRY----------------
We would recommend that you proceed as follows. De-install the program, and if you had a trial version of the program as well, de-install this as well.

Delete the installation.ini file(s) as well. This is located under

Windows Vista und Windows 7:
 C:\ProgramData\MAGIX\[Program name]\installation.ini

Windows XP:
 C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\MAGIX[Program name]\installation.ini

If the folder Program Data is not visible, then you must first choose the option of show hidden files and folders.

You can do this under Control Panel, Folder options and tick under view hidden folders and files choose display all files and folders.

Now restart your computer in Windows Safe Mode, and install the program as administrator.

When you then run the program, do so as administrator

 Thank you for contacting Magix Support.

,mfmedia,2011-10-15T18:05Z,It worked! Thanks!
[T],trialanderror,2011-10-20T08:42Z,"@molly_dog: Thanks for the positive feedback.

I'm not a programmer myself, so I just pick some useful pieces from the web, complete, simplify and document them as good as possible. There is a crack for v18 MX somewhere on this site, but it didn't work satisfyingly, so I'll stay away from releasing a full package of the new version until there is a working crack. I had a peek into the new version and I frankly was not too delighted. Most of the features are very similar with a few new ones, but also lacking some from the 17 version like the jazz drums and sax synth. For getting started, v17 should be more than sufficient.

By the way, those of you who experience errors, may want to give the upgrade functionality of the program a try. It fixes some errors."
[T],trialanderror,2011-10-20T08:44Z,"I mean update, not upgrade. Sorry, english is not my first language."
[T],trialanderror,2011-10-20T20:12Z,"Okay, so I found a way to make version 18 MX work. Grab it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6759069"

,buzzhighyear,2012-01-07T14:34Z,i have installed it and it still doesnt work. I have tried everything and it wont just work. Its not the first time i have problems installing Magix. Anyone with an idea?
,mizzcrazy,2012-01-11T03:40Z,I only joined PB to say a huge thanks to trialanderror for this awesome torrent. as an ageing rocker then i'm not so techie clued up as some but the instructions from both the uploader and comment posters here made it a smooth experience. you guys rock !
,skulldragon,2012-02-10T02:29Z,"Works great, no viruses. Yes, this actually works. Crashes sometimes, but.. works.

The weird random program/preset jumping in some VST really pisses me off.. But, save your favorite preset outside and then load it in the Instrument editor again, then it won't jump to another preset.

Can anybody tell me, where can i get more presets for MMM?
""There are thousands of free VST plug-ins online that can be downloaded directly and used.""
But somewhy, I only managed to find 5... and even those are 3 years old...

Btw, you don't even have to activate it online, you can activate it offline too - when it asks for activation code, just enter random numbers and it will activate!"

For those, who have problem with serial number:  if you have Windows 7 try to install crack files in *C:Program Files (x86)MAGIX (not in *C:ProgramDataMAGIX - it's a common mistake :) )."
