Jo Jo Gunne
Bite Down Hard (1973)

Jo Jo Gunne was a rock group formed in Los Angeles in 1971 by Jay Ferguson (b. May 10, 1947; Burbank, CA) (keyboards, vocals) and Mark Andes (b. February 19, 1948; Philadelphia) (bass, vocals) after they left Spirit. They added Mark's brother Matt Andes (b. California) (guitar, vocals) and Curley Smith (b. January 31, 1952; Wolf Point, MT) (drums) to complete the lineup, signed to Asylum Records, and made a self-titled debut album containing the Top 40 hit "Run, Run, Run," after which Mark Andes left the band and was replaced by Jimmy Randall (b. February 14, 1949, Dallas). (Andes went on to be a member of Firefall and Heart.) The group continued for three more albums with more personnel changes, but did not maintain the commercial momentum of its debut and broke up in 1975. Ferguson has made solo albums and scored movies.
