No special settings with CFG loader.  Kind of interesting custom your own character gameplay. Definitely create a profile before you waste 2 hours of playing, making no money like I did lol.  You'll wanna pimp out your ISO and buy some badass light cycles.  Enjoy.  Definitely a 4/5 rating for this game.  Haven't played evolution for pc but it feels like it's got to be more fun than that shitty game."

,macLife04,2011-03-18T05:12Z,"Game actually is crap. Movie is good though. 

Regards to Quality of torrent, the game starts to get blurry after a few minutes in. Never had this problem with any other games.
