Vice City is closely based on Miami, Florida.
Vice City is a fictional city in the Grand Theft Auto series, based on Miami, Florida. Two versions of the city have appeared in different generations of the series: The Grand Theft Auto rendition is geographically very similar to Miami. The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City rendition (also featured in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories) is composed of two mainland islands, with five smaller ones in between. This rendition of Vice City draws significant inspiration from the 1980s culture of Miami.
Located in the Florida Keys, Vice City enjoys a subtropical or near-tropical climate with year-long sunny weather, occasional strong winds and rainfall. It is also suggested in Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories that the city is exposed to hurricanes, as is Miami; early in Vice City, bridges are closed to the public as Hurricane Hermione is believed to be approaching the city. Similarly in Vice City Stories, Hurricane Gordy is believed to be approaching the city.
