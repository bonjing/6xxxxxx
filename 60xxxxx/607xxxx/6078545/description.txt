When asked about this tour Reb Beach answered:

"Jamie Walters was THE funnest tour I ever did. It was just Jamie and I, first class all the way through Europe. Jamie and I became great friends and we wrote the song "You" together. With the exception of Kip Winger, he is probably my favorite person in the world (meaning "male person")."
