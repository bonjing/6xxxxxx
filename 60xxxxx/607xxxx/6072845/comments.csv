BUT for god's sake, PLEASE INCLUDE THE SUBTITLES with your films where they're crucially required to translate foreign dialogue. 

This is being neglected more and more, and it means people have to tediously trawl across the net to find properly synced subs."

Annoying thing is everything is subtitled, even the English speaking - but its still better than not knowing what the Russian means!"
,michaelrwatson,2012-04-08T11:21Z,That's no better than nothing. This was ripped by a moron. Shit.
