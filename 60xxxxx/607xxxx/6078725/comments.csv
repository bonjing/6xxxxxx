,wufta,2011-01-03T09:09Z,quality is awesome.  i'm really impressed by visual crispness and sound.  thank you for providing this for those of us that were too broke to get there and have too crappy of a computer to stream the show live :(  luckily my computer can play .flvs and .avis ok still. 
,phish1999,2011-01-03T16:49Z,Thanks for the upload. My computer was inoperable and I was incapable of actually watching the video stream live. HarpuaFSB on YouTube has also been posting some great videos of the New Year run.
