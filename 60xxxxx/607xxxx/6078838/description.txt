Jewel - Woodstock 1999

The previous file I had on here was out of aspect ratio, as was the original I had got it from.
This DVD has the aspect ratio corrected, as well as the "better" audio that my previous .AVI download had featured.
The songs each have their own chapters for easy selection. There are 4 menus with audio and video previews.

Chapters:

1) Near You Always
2) Deep Water
3) Hands
4) You Were Meant For Me
5) Jupiter (Swallow The Moon)
6) Life Uncommon
7) Foolish Games
8) Down So Long
9) Race Car Driver
10) Down
11) Love Me Just Leave Me Alone
12) Who Will Save Your Soul
