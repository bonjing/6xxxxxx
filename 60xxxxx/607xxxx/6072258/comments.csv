open the program a few times (sometimes even a few dozen times) and it WILL open and WILL work. you dont need a ""fix"", because it works fine. the glitch has always been there, since this came out. though since beta, it happens alot more. unsure why honestly.
but yea, just open it a few time an it will work eventualy. annoying but working :3
though if you dont need to update at the time, i suggest getting the ""hd texture pack fix"". open that up, and click ""test minecraft"". it will 'bypass' the annoyance with the crack"

      Bad video card drivers!      
      -----------------------      

Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.

No you're not. You need proof that you and the rest posting about this are moron? ok luckily i've found this copypasta:
There you earn ""points"" by completing ""surveys"" and if you get 200 points they claim that you'll be rewarded with a Minecraft account.

However, those surveys aren't free and you are charged in your mobile bill. It's necessary to have a mobile phone to complete the surveys and reply a text message with a passcode.

The surveys varies by country and in many countries (almost all countries from Africa, Latin America and Asia) the mobile phone bill can exceed the minecraft account price after the second survey (price is US$12* per month for those 7-points surveys). So to (possibly) get a minecraft account, you'll need to spend more than U$:320.00 in surveys (assuming only 7-points surveys). In Anglo-America, Oceania and Europe it's also very expensive, but not as much, I don't have a precise number because it seems to vary a lot on these continents, but let's say something like US$:150.00.
*-That number is rounded and varies a little: LA:US$:11(Brazil:US$:10, Mexico:US$:14), Africa:(Southern countries:US$:11, Northern:US$:12), Some Poor Countries in Asia:US$:13.

Not to tell that in some of those countries if the guy doesn't pay the mobile bill he can be arrested and in almost all of them he will lose all his financial credit (credit cards, leasing, health insurance, mortgaged things, etc.).

Also, in South Africa and Brazil there are many people suing (or trying to) the guys (company =/) responsible for that website and most of them claim that even after spending 300+ US dollars with those surveys to get 200 points they didn't get their accounts.
NOTHING IS FREE MOTHERFUCKER IF YOU WANT A ACCOUNT BUY THE GAME"

,Twick00,2011-05-25T04:42Z,I laugh at people who need a reason to play games. I play for fun and nothing else. Anyone else asking what the point of this game is should first ask themselves why they play games. If you play to show off then this game isn't for you and you aren't a true gamer.

,cybersteel8,2011-06-18T00:23Z,@megapixel - it's okay it does that for me too. I think it somehow realises it's cracked or something... or that you don't have an actual account with Minecraft because it thinks you may have logged in at another location

,monkeykidx5,2011-06-30T02:17Z,do I have to force update every time I launch this? the reason I ask is because when I try to mod this by putting some mods in the folder and minecraft files and launch the game afterwards(by pressing force update) the cracks and mods go away and the files reset to the original ones.

To all the people who are complaining about us not buying the game, a question: Why the fuck are you on a Pirating website? 

You either came on here to: 
1. Pirate games 
2. Show others that you're ignorant and idiotic. 

If we want to buy a game, then we can, but don't tell us to - we can do whatever the hell we want with our money. Minecraft is a great game, and I probably will buy it, but that doesn't mean I'm going to listen to people tell me how to spend my money, you wouldn't like it if we told you to pirate games instead of buying them, would you?
