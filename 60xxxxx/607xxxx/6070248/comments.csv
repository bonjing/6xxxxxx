What the fuck are you taking about?!!!"
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T02:59Z,"Ok guys , it is like this : i uploaded movies before and i have a movies site , i do the correct analysis on the originals then i apply the correct plugins to get the best clean picture as possible that is possible to get from the original , for movies no symbol at the end of the word , just GLOBE , tradicionally my codifications are maded in a nice bitrate in divx but xvids can always be a possibility depending on the original , the divx get a reliable clean of the picture for a nice bitrate and have a few options on the codifications , many other codecs can make a good work but for avi and watching in private or on the net in websites , the divx have a perfect structure and for example in many video streaming sites you need the divxweb plugin to watch the streaming movies , many others possibilitys for codification exists but divx certainly one of them , go to my movies site and enjoy a movie while waiting this download .

enjoy ..."

,bonzai37,2010-12-29T13:27Z,"@namorax2 

You're the douche bag. You attacked an ULer without even DLing first. How the fuck can you say it's fake if you don't DL first?"
,derek31a,2010-12-29T13:48Z,"Well, unlike some I have d/loaded it and this version of Tron is one of the best out there - well done u/loader.
Me, I'll wait for a proper DVd quality rather than a very good cam so I won't be watching it.
Again, don't criticise without downloading, it makes you look like a pillock.
By the way - V=7, A=7"
[V],globeplus,2010-12-29T17:25Z,"To derek31a :  you can give 1-1 in audio/video quality if you want but one thing is for shore : you must give even less to the other possibilitys to watch the movie with more particles alojated in the screen background , the cams or converted xvid cams donÂ´t have the correct filters at the time of the recording ."
,friendsjaggu,2010-12-29T18:28Z,any screen shots

,zissyfou,2011-01-19T17:52Z,"No subtitle file. 

Why are users indicated texted languages when there are no subtitles? Please stop doing this. "
,technosailor,2011-02-24T05:07Z,I'll also wait for the DVD/Blueray rip or original to see this movie.
