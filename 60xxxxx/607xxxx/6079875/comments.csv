Good encoding."
,Daijobou,2011-01-28T22:40Z,"Heads up to anybody reading this:

I just got a copyright infringement notice from Fox.  They are definitely tracking this.  I downloaded this torrent on 1/7 and they sent me a notice today indicating that I had been flagged on 1/24.

I always run PeerBlock and keep it up to date.  This is my first slip up in hundreds of torrents.

BE CAREFUL!"
