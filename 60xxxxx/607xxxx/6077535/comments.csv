,atrael777,2011-01-15T07:47Z,"Works great....... till I hit 255 games in the library. Now its telling me I cant search the database anymore because my trial version is expired. 
When I check my license info it tells me ""Your game collector pro license has been validated successfully""

Think the crack doesn't work properly. Any help?"

Be careful how many games you add at any one time. If you add more than 25 at a time, it causes problems. I had this same issue because no one ever told me. If you keep it under 25 a day, you shouldnt have any problems. Only way to fix it now is to start over. You have to delete your current collection, uninstall, reinstall, and start all over. You cant just reinstall and use the same collection file because you will just have the same problem again."
