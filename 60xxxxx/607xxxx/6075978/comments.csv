,jennoula1972,2011-01-01T14:56Z,Please help me seed guys! This is the first time ever I uploaded a torrent and I'm not all that familiar with how it works! :-)
,rhflem12345,2011-01-02T02:35Z,You need to seed it first before anyone else can.
,jennoula1972,2011-01-05T10:54Z,How can I do that now that I've uploaded it?
,rhflem12345,2011-01-06T02:30Z,"Put the film in whatever folder you usually have your downloads go to. Keep it there. Then open the torrent in your torrent program,(utorrent,Transmission, Bitorrent, whatever you use)."
,jennoula1972,2011-01-06T10:54Z,"OK, done! Thank you! It will probably be seeded soon! Sorry for any inconvenience..."
