                    The Blue Geranium.                       
                    Miss Marple tries to stop a court hearing when  
                    she discovers important new evidence about the  
                    'Blue Geranium' murder case. Months before,  
                     Marple is attending a tense gathering at a  
                     village golf club when the dead body of a  
                     strange young man is discovered. Soon after, a  
                     wealthy and unpopular local woman is found  
                     dead in bed. Did she really die of shock when  
                     the geranium in her wallpaper turned blue? Can  
                     Marple stop the trial in time before the wrong  
                     person is found guilty of murder?
