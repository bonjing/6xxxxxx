[B]Jack Crawford (Jason Statham) is an FBI agent who discovers that a hit man named Rogue (Jet Li) is back in San Francisco after 3 years of complete disappearance by Rogue's trademark titanium shells with depleted uranium slugs. Crawford knew Rogue from his past experience that Rogue killed Crawford's partner Tom Lone (Terry Chen) and his wife and daughter and set their home on fire.

Crawford wants justice for his partner and vows to kill Rogue to get even. In the mean time, Rogue skillfully incites a war between the Triads and Yakuzas in San Francisco for no apparent reason. Rogue seems to be working for the local mafia Chang (John Lone) while he kills his son-like man in Triads and skillfully manages to let him believe it's done by the Yakuzas and tips the man's brother about a man working under Shiro (Ryo Ishibashi), leading him to his location of a tea house where the rival gangs fight while Rogue sits in a winow picking off anyone coming out with a sniper rifle from both gangs.

Rogue is a very good fighter, an excellent liar and is skilled at vanishing abruptly. He works for the Japanese Yakuza while still workin with Chang's Triad and kills Chang upon the Japanese mob's orders. But he didn't followed the mob's full order by not killing Chang's wife and daughter as he previously promised Shiro.

Crawford finds out Rogue had actually changed his face by plastic surgery and found the surgeon who done the same and confirms his current identity of Victor Shaw (Jet Li). By his watchmen, Crawford manages to get snaps of Rogue killing Shiro's assassins and assisting the wife and daughter of Chang into a car. Crawford gives these snaps to the Shiro who finally turns up in San Francisco cleverly lured by Rogue using a pair of priceless gold horse statues (one of them is a fake of the other) from Japan. Shiro orders his men to torture Rogue to find out where Chang's wife and daughter were hidden but Rogue escapes and kills the Shiro's men and sets off the bomb he had in the other suitcase killing almost everyone except Shiro to whom he starts a sword fight. This is where the plot gets its twist, Shiro asks him why he's doing this and Rogue replies that it's because of a killing the Shiro had ordered. Shiro wondered which one of the many orders and it turns out to be the killing of Tom Lone and his family. Telling he shouldn't have ordered to kill the women and child Rogue sets on a skilled fight which at last the mob was not able to hold and reveals another stunning truth that it's all because Crawford let it happen. This makes another interesting twist and after learning the fact, Rogue kills Shiro by beheading him.

The Wife of Chang receives a package with a letter saying "Make A New Life" from Rogue with the original gold horse statue in it. Shiro's daughter, who had returned to Japan, receives the same letter (in Japanese) with a suitcase, which revealed to contain Shiro's head.

Rogue calls Crawford to set a meeting at the first known place for both of them and Crawford sets a sniper and visits that place to kill Rogue. Rogue and Crawford fight furiously and at one end when they're close to face to face, Rogue reveals he's actually the partner of Crawford, Tom Lone (Terry Chen) who's supposed to be dead but manages to survive and killed the real Rogue and made a plastic surgery to make him look like Rogue to avenge his wife and daughter's death. Crawford recognized the eyes of Tom Lone and apologizes for what happened, and asks if he could ever forgive him. Lone then says Tom Lone is dead, and that he is now Rogue. The FBI agent assigned to shoot Rogue/Lone attempted to target him, but Crawford jumps in the way, and Rogue shoots him in the back, killing him.

Rogue drives away in his car with the suitcase full of money that the Triad had given him earlier in the movie, and the movie ends [/B]
