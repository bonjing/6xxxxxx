REAL?   FAKE?   VIRUS?   INSTALLATION PROBLEMS?

If anyone could comment on these it would be great. I'm not opening / installing an exe file unless i know it has no viruses. Most antiviruses are useless with things like this. I use McAfee but it wont tell me if there is a virus in an app / file until its reached the virus... E.G. if there is a virus in the end part of the installation, McAfee doesn't pick it up until the end part of the installation."

My opinion, dont waste your time.
