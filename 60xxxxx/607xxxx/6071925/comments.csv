,profcon,2010-12-30T01:44Z,"7Zip CANNOT OPEN THE FILE.
Unsupported Compression Method. "
,babybluetits24,2010-12-30T07:00Z,will this get windows updates ? need far more info for operating system releases thanks

Try WinRar 3.93 - opened and extracted it just fine.   (Yes, I got the same error message with 7Zip 4.65) 7Zip is up to 9.20, BTW.  Maybe we both need to update things a bit :-)"
[V],peck1234,2010-12-30T08:01Z,"Yes this OS will get all future XP updates via Internet Explorer...  

"
,DarthBubba,2010-12-30T08:01Z,"Opens fine with 7Zip 9.20 - the current version.

Also, thanks for the upload peck1234!"
,DarthBubba,2010-12-30T08:26Z,"@Peck1234:

Does this version include SATA drivers?"
,ionutbreana,2010-12-30T22:25Z,"are you nuts? you took firewall and system restore?
and security center? Maybe I sound a little stupid but theese features that you consider useless are actually very usefull!!!!!!! Considering that 90% of the people who own Windows OS does not use a third party application for firewall! Sorry to say this, but this torrent is not safe!!!"
[V],peck1234,2010-12-30T23:12Z,"Considering 99% of people are behind a router makes firewalls in esense USELESS.  This release is intended for advanced users who actually know how to use a computer.

Dont like it? Dont download it?  Go ahead and feel safe with you norton 2011 and windows firewall.  But you need to understand that some PC users actually know what the fuck they are doing and dont need all the extras.  "
[V],peck1234,2010-12-30T23:35Z,"And also just so you know. Everything that was disabled  can be re-enabled via services.msc. (even the firewall)

daca nu stapanesti bine un sistem de operare mai bine plimba-te. de ani de zile lumea se chinuie sa carpeasca un windows care e plin de gauri de securitate ca un cascaval si tu tzipi ca e dezactivat firewall-ul care oricum e de cacao si system restore care de fapt iti restaureaza virusii dupa scanare. mai pune osul si citeste forumuri de specialitate ca la capitolul asta nu ai habar.

,bdelange,2011-01-10T19:54Z,"Hello, first off thanks for the upload! I installed this, but when my machine boots it goes though the windows setup but then stops at the ""insert SP3 disc"" I've tried burning sp3 discs, but it doesn't do anything. Ive also tried a different copy of Win XP, but it wont let me set it up, just boots and stops at the same scree. Any help would be great! Briandelange03@gmail.com  "
,komandanti,2011-01-14T07:43Z,its asking for serial key! I am installing on VMW if it matters.
,marflo,2011-01-21T05:48Z,Will it work on an old Dell latitude CPx pentium 3?
,CharFace,2011-02-19T18:13Z,"Perfect.  I am in your debt, sir.  FYI I threw this OS on an IBM Thinkpad from 1999...  466 Celeron, 256MB RAM, 6GB HDD...  you get my point.  It installed in all of 45 minutes including the partition format, and it is once again a useable laptop."
,tommyd_13,2011-04-28T11:42Z,"A great piece of software...... BUT......

its only for american keyboard layout.  what a shame.   would have been sweet.

you went a bit toooo far with your shedding "
,KirkBauer,2011-06-05T19:55Z,"Just a note; while it will update through Internet Explorer, with modern versions of Windows Update you need to activate the Background Intelligent Transfer Service in services.msc - you do not need to activate Automatic Updates, though."
,Mr_Shiny_Monkey_Pants,2012-05-10T21:32Z,is it bootable???
