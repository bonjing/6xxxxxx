nPA - neuer Personalausweis

(new German identity card)

Beginning in November 2010, German ID cards are issued in the ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1 format and contain RFID chips with personally identifiable information including a biometric Photo and, if desired, two fingerprints. 

This package contains both software and scanned information from the kit which is available for holders of the new ID card. This kit comes with the Basisleser (basic card reader).
