Produced by the award-winning maranGraphics Group, Maran Illustrated Guide to 
Yoga is a valuable resource for all readers, regardless of age or fitness level. Instead of 
describing the myriad ways to perform each pose, Maran Illustrated Guide to Yoga shows 
you the best way, while the full-color photographs and clear, step-by-step instructions walk 
the reader through each pose from beginning to end. Thorough topic introductions and useful 
tips provide additional information and advice to enhance your yoga experience and help meet 
your individual needs. Maran Illustrated Guide to Yoga is packed with essential information 
including warm-up poses, breathing exercises, seated poses, chair poses, standing poses, 
bends, relaxation poses, practice sequences and much more. This book is an invaluable guide 
for beginners who wish to familiarize themselves with the basics of yoga without having to 
participate in classes, or as a refresher course for individuals wishing to become reacquainted 
with yoga. Maran Illustrated Guide to Yoga costs less than the price of one private yoga 
lesson and will be a permanent resource that can be accessed at any time.
