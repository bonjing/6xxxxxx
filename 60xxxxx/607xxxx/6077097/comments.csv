[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-01-21T10:06Z,"@delboy81

You need to enable your hidden files/folder.
Tutorial is here - http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/1521/how_to_view_hidden_and_system_files_and_folders_in_vista/

After that you will see that folder in C:/"

,me-only,2011-01-30T16:06Z,"Hi guys heres Possible solution for a failed install:

this wouldnt install on my laptop, but installed ok on my tower, dispite following instructions to the letter, but I think I worked out why, kinda stupid really, 

um I was lame enough to leave the laptop connected to the network while doing the install, during which I noticed it downloaded an update, - OOPS!


on the tower, which works btw, I disconnected the network and installed as per instructions,
but skipped the flash 10.1 install at the end, I got a bit suspicious of this as it wants to install it even though i have it allready installed... hmmmm


deleted the /48 folder and created a fresh new empty one to be sure,

copied the .dll over and ticked the read only flag in the property sheet and hey presto it works

 but for the life of me cant get it to go on laptop, I suspect the update bunged something somewhere,  may try it in a VM as a stopgap
