[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-03T16:30Z,"@astralJ5: Thanks for the appreciation! But you are trying to induce your truth to other leechers! This , of course, won't work for you because of your enourmous  lack of PC knowledge. Show me your best rip. And  are you wondering why H264+AC3? It's a bet with myself...  Others managed succesfully the same combination. Happy New Year!!!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-03T16:40Z,@astralJ5 - and something more: tested on some decent PC's with  the proper software installation[codecs and mediaplayer] and on a Tv with mediaplayer[software included...Samsung LE32C550] and works flawless. Not tested on PS3[I don't own one of those]...Cheers...Try some better jokes !!!
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-03T23:03Z,@astralJ5:  ...and obviously...the proper video driver...etc... I don't care about vicious comments...If it's anything good  in this upload..this torrent will last.... Again: HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYBODY !
,astralJ5,2011-01-06T14:02Z,"the timecode was messed up. best solution is moving to mac and fcp and get everything right with  manual keyframing and manual framerate after u chkout the source structure, rather than some premade applications. with ps3 u need to keep the file under 4.29gb and itll work like this should, didnt test it after the timecode structure message i had...Anyway i know u wanna b nice when u share so gj, and shiny dayz! if the file works then i been just whining here anyway. so peace and out."
,astralJ5,2011-01-06T14:43Z,"h264 or m2ts brings both hd videos both is good when u look at finished frame u might even choose the m2ts instead. the target filesize matters, a mac plays well m2ts vid which has 30mb/sec videorate with over1mb/s audiorate on fullhd frames rate 25/s and its still huge compressed vs uncompressed file. mp4 is just one part of bluray format and pcm stereo is the orginal sound source in all movie sound recordings which is mixed into multich file, so if there are no multiple mics theres no idea to screw it up with some horrible result of surround output, pcm stereo is natural and orginal and thatswhy it brings the best and purest sound, aac only can make it worse wo several directional mics."
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-07T23:32Z,"@astraJ5:thanks for your speech-lesson. Take a look at the rips of secret_myth, lifechanger, GreatMagican, Gopo. They all use mp4 and with very good results. I understand that the rate compression is much better with m2ts  still having an impresive datarate for both video and audio. But this is not a competition AND THE DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT ""this guy have no idea of encoding video, the file wont work in any computer or player. "" And that coment of yours was more than unfair an  malicious. Show some results and not just ....teach us !!! ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions "" ...Cheers my ""noble"" friend !"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-01-08T00:48Z,"24 fps is for Film / 24P / High Definition [23,976] says video timecode calculator for windows. There are stand-alone apps for timecode calculation but there are some other all-in-one [pre-made you said] very good video converting apps[and freeware !] that do that automaticaly. THE FINAL FILE IT'S OK for me and for many others AND PLAYS JUST FINE with or without the correct timecode. I can calculate it for you manually [or with windows timecode calculator] but I don't see the point. For the fun it don't have to be so complicated. By the way the sound it's AC3 in this one! Bye bye ...maestro."

,astralJ5,2011-03-17T13:40Z,"when somebody brings u something yes worship it!

OR...you could...

-try to improve, try to reach the perfect, use what is given to you(=your brains, ears and your eyes) and
have your own free thoughts and release them out as a words, yes..its called free opinion..
-would it not be cool if you yourself could do/reach the things youve wanted..? ..then whynot get creative..find ways..

if you find this or anything else in your life satisfying then good for you, in this case with this file i dont, so excuse me. i live in a country what is not ruled by communists, here we can speak freely.. im sure when you get old enough u will drop those sticks and stones from your hand and realise others than you should also b counted. Pray God he let u discover that someday.

In life could be just like in music: 
""Music: a huge spent of precision to obtain...the vague."" Andrei Pleşu

Thanks for the good advice...Part of those I was aware of, but hardware  limitations made me to accept the challenge ...like this !!!  I'm speaking about video encoding..  About the others believes of yours....they look alike with mines excepting the fact that I have another religion... I hope one day I'll be as good as you wish me.. All the best for you too....and GOD BLESS YOU !!"
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-04-01T14:24Z,"@astralJ5:

And something more: nor the Bible neither the common sense have nothing in common with your so called freedom of speech. Don't forget that first you think and after... you express yourself[as a human beeing]. So ...first free-will !!!

About the obvious positive -thinking pre-made speech..it's OK ...but life is different...But I have my ways whereever and...whenever I'll live. And obviously I evolve from sometime[you don't know me at all]. 

And last , but not  the last one, communism is an anachronism [for me especially], and you can't touch nobody with a word like that !

Once again I wish you all the best in your great democracy...GOD BLESS YOU !!"
