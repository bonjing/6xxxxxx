After Bob Marleys recent split from the oringinal 3 Wailers, Bob had to come up with some way to get him back on track. 
So by joining together his wife Rita Marley and Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt known as the I-Threes and an American Guitarist Al Anderson he made his new Wailers with Familyman and Carly Barret still on Bass/Percussion. The band was now named, 
"Bob Marley & The Wailers." 

And about 10 months later they produced Natty Dread releasing October 25th 1974. 
The album was not a huge succes unlike it is today, as the likes of Queen releasing Bohiem Rhapsody and Abba firmly in the charts, did not give Bob Marley a decent chance. 
Natty Dread however was still a solid albym. 

The album kicks off with the groovy Lively Up Yourself, Bobs humour brings the song alive, along with Familymans amazing bass playing. 10/10 

The second song No Woman No Cry is a studio version of the legendary live version, nethertheless the song still is a very decent effort. 9/10 

Third brings the inspiring Them Belly Full(But We Hungry) it is a rebel on how the rich greedly flash there money while the poor poeple are shunted to one side and left there to starve. 9/10 

Forth brings Rebel Music(3 O'clock Road Block) this is a very well produced song with a strong reggae feel. Bobs talking about his ambush in London. 8/10 

Fifth brings So Jah Seh, which was one of the singles, a very underated song, written by Rita Marley and Willy Francisco. 10/10 

Sixth brings Natty Dread a brilliant song, a catchy beat, talking about life in Trench Town. One of the many highlights of the album. 10/10 

Track numer seven brings Bend Down Low originally produced 1968 with Lee "Scratch" Perry, it is a very well thought of love song. 9/10 

Number eight sees Talkin' Blues an absoulute gem, its very nice to see Blue's with Reggae said Chris Blackwell. Another highlight of the album. 10/10 

Track nine Revoulution is probably the albums best, and is the most hard hitting song. Another excellent song written by Bob. 10/10 

And finaly number tens Am-A-Do is a rare Bob song which originally appeared on the Talkin' Blues album. I must admit the song is addictively catchy, and sometimes you may find yourself humming the tune. A great way to end the album. 9/10 

All in all Natty Dread is a collection of classic songs its a pity that some of these songs arent as well known as they should be, and i cannot believe none made Legend. 

Feel free to buy any over Bob Marley albums as they are equally as good as this one.
