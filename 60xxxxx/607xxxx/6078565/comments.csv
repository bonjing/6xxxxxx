I find it is true what they say noting in life is free i was paying zero $$ but i payed for it with time, sad to say but i stop working on the website it was too time consuming, it was truly mission impossible to up keep with a full-time job. 
As form 2011 i'll be taking requests on facebook or gtyouth.tk, let put this way no requests! no upload!! "
