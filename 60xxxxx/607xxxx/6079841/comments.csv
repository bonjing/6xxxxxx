I know requests are frozen, but I have to ask this: are you going to do ""V - Season two"" starting on this 4th? It's one of my favorites. If you have plans to include it in your TV Shows Pack, I'll wait for your torrent. Otherwise, I'll have to search for other sources - which I haven't done for TV torrents since I discovered you in PirateBay :)

Thanks a lot & God bless you!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-03T21:55Z,"@etowhid: Thanks, happy 2011. to you.
""V"" was my regular show and - stay as regular one. Don't worry. I have lost interest in watching after four-five episodes but I would continue to encode and up V without second thoughts."
,silveroakleaf,2011-01-04T01:21Z,"I know you don't watch all you up, but thanks for upping ""V"" even though you stopped watching it.  Just another great example of your magnanimity!"
