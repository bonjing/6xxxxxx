                    The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side.    
                    A touch of Hollywood stardom arrives in St Mary  
                    Mead when actress Marina Gregg and her young  
                    English film director husband, Jason Rudd, take  
                    up residence at Gossington Hall. Curious locals  
                    gather for a reception hosted by the glamorous  
                    couple but Marina's new role as lady of the  
                    manor seems to be under threat when an   
                    excitable fan dies after drinking a poisoned  
                    cocktail. But for whom was the fatal concoction  
                    really intended?
