,mtadesse,2011-03-09T14:37Z,Me too there is an error in the WinRar files when I try to extract the folder is empty...
,mtadesse,2011-03-09T14:42Z,"I got it to work. What has to be done is the folder name needs to be shorter. I just put 
Tron Evolution Battle Grids (2010)
and I also shortened the WinRAR file names. I dont know why but it works

Later 4 u's"
