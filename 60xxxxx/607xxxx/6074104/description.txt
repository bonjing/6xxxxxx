I recently bought some DJ equipment and this is the first mix I've recorded with it. I realize that there are some sloppy transitions in here, and some terrible use of effects, but I've had the stuff for less than a week so I'm still figuring everything out. These are some of my favorite songs from the past year or so, and I thought they mixed well together. After I got to the 6th song I wanted to keep going so the last few songs were kind of improvised when it came to mixing.
