,Jesper1230,2011-01-04T17:03Z,"it is small because it is a file and it is the main file that creates them other files, plus there are no plugins in it."
,Eliittihemuliperkele,2011-01-18T20:44Z,"@Hizze1337

Open the server properties file with notepad;

hellworld=false


Change false to true and nether portal works"
