This move is full of retarded camera shake close up fight scenes, predictable plot, and Asian victims like all his other crappy movies. When you waste your time watching this shit listen for how many times the phrase ""White Boy"" is used, lol. Don't waste your time on this one there is a reason this garbage didn't make the theaters.

I will say:
V9/A9"
