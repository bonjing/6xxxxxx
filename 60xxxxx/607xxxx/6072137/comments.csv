,paulspain,2011-02-14T09:29Z,"This has so many trojans freezes your pc with messages that you are infected unable to do anything to pc unless you go into safe mode and use your virus cleaner, very very bad. Please trust me I am not into infecting pc for fun."

,dentonpirate,2011-03-18T06:23Z,"I like that this popped up when I searched for ""Linux"". I like the fact that Limewire Pirate Edition exists and I like the idea of open source taking over, as it inevitably will. 

I hate to beat a dead horse, but copying makes two, stealing leaves 1 less. Thats all Im sayin on that subject.

All this being said, I think the RIAA can file all the injunctions it wants. I will upload and seed this file to every torrent organization I am a part of and will also email every pirate and/or monkey I know to do the same. 

Its not like this can ever be truly stopped. There are too many people that know too much about too many things to let this bullshit from the RIAA and others to really even effect the users ability to download whatever song or move he/she desires. You can google for the torrents, it begs you to click. 

Fuck closed source, its a dead industry....

,djh101,2011-07-09T23:29Z,"Back before Limewire went away I was getting my songs one at a time. Since I was forced to start getting music from torrents I've just been getting entire discographies. Silly RIAA...

Note that I still do buy CDs that I believe are worth buying and encourage people to continue purchasing CDs, if only occasionally. 8)"
,Samuelthemad,2011-07-10T16:27Z,LimeWire Connecting...
,dazedknight,2011-08-14T06:19Z,"Why on earth would anyone take chances on this crap when they can download uTorrent, Tixati, Vuze, Frostwire or Bit Torrent at no cost, and no chance of viral infection?

Tixati FTW"
,PaceyPimps,2011-09-14T19:27Z,Ares has more users now works perfect and it is free now for OS X Lion there is no good program. Limewire Pirate still works but no users anymore and Frostwire 5 sucks 4.21.8 is the best but will not wok in LION but still there are better results in Ares
,Sivos,2011-10-21T09:49Z,I think paul is either a troll or doesn't know exactly what a trojan is.
