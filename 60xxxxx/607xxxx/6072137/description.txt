LimeWire Pirate Edition (LPE) Nov2010-Piratical Monkeys

LimeWire Resurrected By Secret Dev Team. Last month, the Gnutella-based 
file-sharing client LimeWire was effectively outlawed after a U.S. federal 
judge granted a request from the RIAA to shut the software down. Now, not 
even a month later, LimeWire is back as good as new. Not only has a secret 
dev team reanimated the hugely popular client, but they have also made a few 
significant changes which make it better and more streamlined than before.

Download from:

LimeWire Pirate Edition is free, open source software based on the final beta 
version of the popular LimeWire filesharing application. After Lime Wire LLC 
stopped distributing its software in October 2010, a horde of piratical monkeys 
climbed aboard the abandoned ship, mended its sails, polished its cannons and 
released it FREE to the community to help keep the Gnutella network alive. 

LimeWire Pirate Edition is pure P2P software; it does not depend on any servers 
operated by Lime Wire LLC or other companies. It does not include any adware or 
spyware, and it cannot be remotely monitored or shut down.â€

Based on LimeWire 5.6 beta

Not a program that I like to use!
But I took the precaution of downloading all three releases by Metapirates!
All three versions within RAR file for Windows,Mac and ubuntu/Debian:
LimeWirePirateEdition.exe MD5
LimeWirePirateEdition.deb MD5
LimeWirePirateEdition.dmg MD5

Only tested the windows version... Hope the mac & Linux versions 
work for those that want it!
varns666... Works great on Linux Mint.
