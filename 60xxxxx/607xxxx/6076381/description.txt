Henry Johnson: The Union County Flash
Label :Trix
Originally Recorded:1972
Format:Mp3@320

The album was recorded by Trix Records founder Pete Lowry in 1972, about two years prior to Henry â€œRufeâ€ Johnsonâ€™s passing, at the relatively youthful age of 66.  Johnson was apparently recorded upon the recommendation of his friend, harmonica player Peg Leg Sam, who joins him for two numbers here.  Hearing the music on this CD makes me so thankful that Pete Lowry, much like George Mitchell in the same period, was not quite ready to assume that the country blues were dead, for the South Carolinian Henry Johnson was a major musical find, every bit in the class of such stellar country bluesmen first recorded in the LP era as Mance Lipscomb, John Jackson, Shirley Griffith and Bill Williams.
