Previously to this I installed Creative Suite Master Collection in the same way: pasting code in the textbox of the host. 

I know nothing about this and as I am now intending to install Lightroom I have few doubts:

When the textbox opens has already the code I pasted when installing Creative Suite Master Collection in between 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255  broadcasthost .

Am I suppose to add this Activation Blocker anyway or I will make a mess if I do? Where should I add it if I have to?

Don't know if its because of lion, but when i open the hosts file, it says that it's locked. And i've tried to find out how to become root user, but i can't find any guide that i can use. Also, i tried just typing sudo passwd root in terminal, but the file's still locked when i eventually enter it. Do you have any idea what to do?"
,Klindten,2011-07-30T13:19Z,"@macrookie
You need to download a torrent client like Tansmission, vuze and what else they are called (google would be lifesaving for that problem). Once you've downloaded the the files, the .dmg-file will be in the folder, don't worry. There are very good step-by-step instructions included. If you have lion installed, i sense that you might have a problem installing the crack, but hopefully, someone will come up with a solution very soon.

Hope it helped.:)"

Got to step 4. Then it asked for a password. Didn't know what to do, so I went to step 5 and pasted the info in different ways three times.

Don't think I was supposed to do that. Can you tell me exactly what to do now.

Thanks!"

Am I supposed to press enter after this?  

Then, for the activation blocker info, it says paste between Localhost and broadcast host but I don't see those anywhere.  Is that still while in Terminal?

Finally, in step 8 it says to run Photoshop and enter Serial.  Is that supposed to be lightroom?  

I know others have done this with no problems and so this is really my issue but any help would be appreciated.

Thanks!

Hey Cyberpiraten great job uploading this and other releases."
,newport_john,2011-11-03T16:55Z,"works perfect, much easier than I thought when looking at the instructions. The Lion code worked too.

For those as clueless as I was, the ""terminal application"" is in your Mac utilities folder and opens up a DOS like prompt.

When it asks you for a password in the Terminal application, just type it in -- it doesn't show your typing - at first I thought it wasn't working, and got an error message, but then i just typed in the password and hit enter and it worked.

I chose the second to last serial number and it worked.

Also, once installed, the program automatically updated to the current LR version."

Does this work for Lightroom 3.3 or should I add the 127.0.0.1 localhost and the rest of the blockers?

,pelukkas,2011-12-22T04:15Z,"@cyberpiraten. Hello, thanks for the upload i just have a question I have previously installed CS5 and I also used an activation blocker through the terminal to install it.  If I paste the activation blocker for light-room, will it affect my photoshop? I certainly do not want to delete my photoshop activation blocker. Thank you for your time."

You do not have appropriate access privileges, To view or change access privileges, select the item in Finder and choose File > Get Info.

Anyone have any advice? I'm the only user on the computer, all the settings in the get info are set to read & write."

,Jchristo4,2012-02-15T15:38Z,"Guys how do I pass through the Terminal part?

I've followed the steps on the description given above

@ no.4 (Open Terminal and paste the following ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts"")

I did that but nothing appears.. for me to paste in between the following @ no.5

Is there anything I should press after pasting ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts"" ??

PLEASE HELP!"

Hey! This looks awesome! Just one quick question, when I go to paste the second text, it has opened another window, in text/edit. Is that where I paste it and save it? If so, when I go back to terminal, I enter sudo dscacheutil -flushcache from there? After the first stuff? I tried all this, when I try to run the app it just brings me to the installer over and over... Help please :)"
,mycaverlynne,2012-06-27T07:25Z,Scratch that! I got it working! Is it bad that I never got asked for a serial # though? @cyberpiraten
