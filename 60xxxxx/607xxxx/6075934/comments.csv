,Z0jiru5hi,2011-01-01T21:57Z,"ooch, you're right. Uhh I did convert it to PDF, but I had decided not to upload it. Now that I think about it, I guess I will. "

On Linux, .djv is usually supported out of the box(Ubuntu, Mint, Debian etc.)

BTW, though you might not believe me, I first downloaded the .pdf but for the sake of speed of rendering I'm downloading .djv
