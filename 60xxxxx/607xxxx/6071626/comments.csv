,ugesh22,2011-01-21T16:53Z,does this software support window 7
,Frost58,2011-01-22T07:26Z,"Umm, it ain't that hard.
Open the disc and go here:
\CRACK\Serial.txt

It's that simple. I'll admit that I had trouble at first, but found it pretty fast. And that location is:
\CRACK\Serial.txt"

,hasbeenhonshu,2011-02-24T08:49Z,"Thank you for a great application and a fantastic job of bundling a very professionally sound torrent. As a speaker/reader of the English language I am pleased that you used this language in an unbastardized form so that I could understand what you packaged and get the app up and running.

Speaking about Roxio Creator Pro 2011 - it is fantastic - and in comparison to the 20-something video editing programs which I have tried out this one might actually work. The interface is intuitive and I converted a .wmv and a .avi file to DVD successfully without reading any instructions or getting done by a tutorial. I am sick of getting screwed by video applications and wanted to make damn sure that the advertisements are not a pack of lies before I buy any more dysfunctional software. I already have enough junk editing software to keep a fire busy for hours.

Thanks again kentucky-kid for a job well done."
,Higgety,2011-03-05T05:17Z,"So everything worked perfect, except for when I got to step 4. I tried to install version 1, but when it asked me to select the folder from where I installed Roxio from it said ""Wrong folder selected."" I literally tried every different Roxio folder there was, but it still didn't let me. So i tried version 2 and it worked great except now the interface is all in Russian. Does anyone know how to change the language or install version 1 of step 4? Thank you very much!!"
,tonym2112,2011-03-15T04:12Z,"when you mount the image, don't run auto setup...open to view files...the serial key is in there"
,mindee820,2011-03-16T00:15Z,Same issue with everything changing to Russian after installing version 1 from folder 4. Any fix known?
,Mesohappy,2011-03-18T02:48Z,"Hi KK
Like others Will the russian go away. As I checked properties I saw the russian being the in the profile. We are thankful for the program but I`ve stopped until we get some direction.
Could you maybe explain what is happening. IS there maybe somethings not to load. After I finished step 3 download I had left thumbs in russian and the screen GUI in english. clicked got error so went to file 4 even though I was concerned about the russian. Comrade can you help out a brother in need.
Thanks "
,xshiftyxmcgeex,2011-03-19T23:19Z,i am yet another on perplexed by the russian... what's the deal???  how does one get full english again???
,ineedtonutt,2011-03-22T17:46Z,"For those of you like me I had the russian language issue as well. After searching and searching google I never found anything to help with a solution.

I finally ended up going to uninstall it but I hit repair instead. I repaired all the way up to where it cannot find CP.MSI and then I canceled. Win7 asked if I wanted to uninstall under recommended settings or if it uninstalled correctly. I canceled once more. Roxio said I needed to reboot. I selected reboot manually later. I ran Roxio and I'm back in English. 

So far everything seems fine. This may save some time from uninstalling and reinstalling all over again without installing folder 4 so  you dont have the russian language.

Do we even need to install folder 4?"
,1162_55,2011-05-03T07:08Z,"I entered the serial #, & this what came up:

,pontoon,2011-08-30T11:00Z,Thank you very much.
,RedDog007,2012-03-08T22:50Z,I thank you for your hard work in getting this software to us. I am getting an error that I am not sure how to fix. I am getting d3dx9_33.dll is missing from my computer. I have done the updates in the Folder 4 but in folder 1 I cannot get 1 and 3 to run. I select the folder that is defulted and says wrong folder. I am lost and been looking for a good burning software. I have Nero 7 Ultimate that I bought but that does not work with the file formats today. Thank you for reading this.
