"Revolution Baby" was the debut single by Transvision Vamp and was originally released in 1987 when it only managed to reach #77 on the UK Singles Chart. After the band's breakthrough in 1988 with the release of "I Want Your Love", "Revolution Baby" was subsequently reissued, this time reaching #30 in the UK and #24 in Australia. The sleeve design differed radically between the 1987 and 1988 issues as did the track listings.
