,vicbirdi,2011-10-30T02:33Z,"I'm new to pirate bay. Download Ghajini which I couldn't open becoz it was a MKV file.  So I had to convert it to .mpg file using a program called""Any video converter"".  The quality is but the audio doesn't seem to match the video. I'll be copying into DVDs which can hold only 4.7GB, and this movie was close to 7GB.  I have download few movies from pirate bay, but most of the time it's the wrong file format.  Any suggestions which type of file is compatible in all DVD players?  "
,anandlakra07,2011-10-30T18:20Z,"@vicbirdi hey... don't waste time and space converting the file format! instead use this vlc media player (google search it) it can play a wide variety of video and audio formats, including your mkv video format. By the way, mkv is a awesome video format."
