COUNT BASIE THE COMPLETE ATOMIC BASIE
Label Blue Note 
Original Year 1994
Format Flac


This 1957 release features Neal Hefti's arrangements and the ever-exciting sound of what became known as the Second Testament Basie Band (the first having featured Lester Young, Herschel Evans, Dicky Wells et al). The album opens with a fiery version of "The Kid from Red Bank"; other highlights include "Whirly-Bird" and "Teddy the Toad." As usual, Count Basie's stride-inflected piano style and the brass section's sudden, sharp stabs help define the band's sound.

The Complete Atomic Basie isn't just about screaming high notes and blistering scale flourishes though; subtlety and dynamic variety characterize several charts. We hear this best in the reeds' lilting swing on "Midnite Blue," and in the quiet, mellow groove of "Li'l Darlin'"; the sparseness of the latter's arrangement highlights the often-neglected guitarist Freddie Green's inimitable strumming. One of Basie's finest albums, The Complete Atomic Basie is a swinging gem.

Recorded at Capitol Studios, New York, New York between October 21 & 22, 1957.
