,Millvalley,2011-01-05T07:31Z,"Thank you for sharing this great torrent qwersd. Question: some of these files will transfer to my Kindle, others will not - is it possible that some files have DRM protection? When viewing Kindle files on my PC the book shows up - but it is not listed on my Kindle home screen. Any advice???"
,pupuhd,2011-01-05T15:54Z,"Excellent, thnx"
,nondaras,2011-01-06T23:04Z,THANK YOU
,jamadi,2011-01-08T01:38Z,"Thank you for the fine collection. It looks promising, as I am in the process of downloading it.

I don't see why Calibre's 'Add books - multiple items per directory' option won't work, though...

Just one note to those who are adding this much items to their kindles for the first time:
After you add the books, Kindle will start indexing the content of these books, 2-4 minutes for each. I wouldn't surprise if this particular collection shall need two days to complete the indexations. During this indexing process, the Main Menu may become sluggish. However, you may continue reading with no problems.
If you'll have a computer available, I don't see a point of overloading your Kindle with thousands of books. Keep them on Calibre and sync when needed.
Thanks for the collection once more."
,xxx---Mem---xxx,2011-01-09T03:46Z,Is there a list for what books are in this? I only have slow adsl where I live so would be cool to know what books are in this before I think about downloading :o)
,wulfy1978,2011-01-09T18:22Z,@xxx---Mem---xxx : click the number of files on top and it will display the contents of the torrent.
,xxx---Mem---xxx,2011-01-10T10:52Z,"Thanks a heap Wulfy :o) 

I had a look through but heaps of non interesting ones so won't bother downloading."
,Hermy919,2011-01-10T22:51Z,"This was an EXCELLENT torrent. The complete book list is included - it's so huge it's in an Excel spreadsheet. There were tons of great books in this torrent - including books by G.W. Bush, Laura Bush, Ayn Rand, Anne Rice, tons of classics, Dean Koontz, Stephen King... I mean, 2500 books that were rated five stars. If you can't find 50+ books in this torrent that you wouldn't love to read... I guess you aren't reading quality books anyway. GREAT torrent"

,MJS1988,2011-01-31T21:28Z,"Thank you for this qwersd, It's a great torrent.

To those who are having problems mass adding these to calibre. In the left hand corner select the option to add books from directories, including sub directories (Multiple books per directory) and open up the MOBI folder, when that folder opens you should be able to see folders titled by the authors names. Make sure NONE of the folders are selected (highlighted) and click open. After that the books should automatically start adding to the calibre library. Hope this helps."

I also uploaded them to my iPhone to view in Stanza and same thing.

Do you need the actual Kindle for them to view correctly? Seems like it's worth it for the $140 then."

,wthorne2,2011-04-17T16:37Z,"I downloaded this torrent to my Mac using utorrent and opened it in calibre. Went through the book list  and thought this was a great find.

Martin & Robert B. Note that each name ends in a period. This is an illegal file name for Windows. These files were most likely created on a MAC. Once created, you can move them around the drive they were created on but you cannot delete them and will get an error ""Cannot delete File: Cannot read from the source file or disc"" I found this website helpfull in removeing these 2 folders. I imagine this is going to be a problem as more different phone OS's appear with there own character limitations different form Windows. A note to Mac users, if your going to make a torrent and share files...please remeber that Windows reserves certain charaters for use by the OS and are not allowed in file names"

,HighSeedRatio,2011-10-06T17:48Z,"Lots of comments but no-one commented on the quality. It's barely OK. All books are missing paragraphs. In the middle of a word or a paragraph it just cuts off. You get the gist of the book but it is still very annoying especially if down the line the story refers to something that you didn't read because it was deleted.

I wonder who bothered to edit the books like this and than post them and to what purpose?"
,sv504,2011-10-27T14:09Z,"@LynnW98 - no, we're not interested in you making money on illegal copies of ebooks. Here at least they're free."
,Cookie29,2011-11-03T01:31Z,"@HighSeedRatio - I've read about 25 books out of this torrent, and while there might be the odd misspelling or random capital letter (very very infrequently, I might add) I have yet to encounter a book missing entire paragraphs or sentences, and none of them are so bad that you only get the ""gist"" of the book. I may have a lot more to read, but if it were as bad as you're trying to make it sound, then surely I would have run into it by now. So far, I have been incredibly pleased with the quality of this torrent."

,Dektep,2012-04-15T12:12Z,"Does anyone know a good forum for discussing torrented ebook quality?  If you go on any ebook forum and even mention torrent they all go high and mighty.  Some torrented books are so good I guess that they are from te original retail, stripped of the DRM, but other were probably scanned, then OCR'd and are absolutely filled with mistakes.  I've done this myself in the past, so I know fof the problems that can arise, but I just want to be able to discuss torrented book quality.  Like for example I have two copies of Angels and Demons mobi, one has the illustrations, the other doesn't.  But if you didn't know there were supposed to be illustrations you'd never know."
