These are the books from the Kindle Library that were rated five stars. If you have already downloaded the Kindle Library torrent there is not much new here so I would recommend saving your bandwidth.

If you haven't checked out the previous versions of the libraries I will explain. I have gone through and opened each ebook and rated the quality. These are the books that are retail or close to retail (indistinguishable) and included in both libraries.

Many Demonoid members have requested a separate torrent of just the highest quality books, so here it is.

Things you should know before downloading this as opposed to downloading the library:

It will take longer to add books to Calibre since each book has to be added individually. As opposed to the "switch library" option which will load much quicker.
Books will be missing from series because not all books have been released as retail.
