Following the band from Stealin Horses to Wishing Chair, one is continuously astounded by the quality of their work. Their harmony and vocals are exquisite, while the tempo is upbeat, one can detect Celtic and Native American roots. This album is a must have for anyone who loves vocals and harmony. Kiya Heartwood and Miriam Davidson blend so well together that the album is a pleasure to listen to. I am very much looking forward to anything else they might produce. Not only does the mucic have a good message, but it does so in a relaxing manner.
