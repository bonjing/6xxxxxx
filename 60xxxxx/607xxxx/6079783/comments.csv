,JetFever,2011-01-03T21:22Z,"Bloody .mkv files. I have a 2.8ghz processor and I still can't play them, it'll play a little bit in a reduced-size window but then it stops and forget all about full screen. Ah well, thanks anyway for the upload but everyone should know that unless you have an extremely high-end PC you may get a less than perfect experience"
,streetthug,2011-01-04T01:10Z,@JetFever: dude what you tellin is wrong man... use lc player for the best experience man... in my 10yr old laptop it runs perfectly with full clarity dude...:)
,JetFever,2011-01-04T10:30Z,"lc player huh? ok, i'll give it a try, thanks dude!"
,JetFever,2011-01-04T10:39Z,"Oh, hold on, when you say lc player, do you mean VLC player? coz I use the latest version of that already. I think that .mkv is a wrapper and can contain different types of video and I have some 90mb .mkv files that play fine in VLC but I think that a lot of them such as this 598.05mb file requires that your video card has some hardware acceleration and this is where I'm getting stuck with my cheapo dual-head card. I can play most any video file but not h264 or some .mkv (any scOrp file) ... oh well :-("
,muthineni,2011-01-04T11:13Z,"thnk you for the movie and thank you for the uploading all scorp rips regularly.
every regular movie downloader would prefer scorp over all others anyday :) will seed after.

and guys i dont know wat processer u need but vlc plays all mkv even  in age old systems.. if it doesnt ur system is useless. simple"
,JetFever,2011-01-04T11:44Z,"I can appreciate the love of the smaller file sizes but you need to know that if you do that then you are limiting your audience. Hundreds of .avi files will play on my PC and my windows mobile phone but as soon as I try H264 or scOrp's lovely smaller files they are unwatchable on my windows 7 system (freezing, juddering etc.) and the phone can't play them either. Unfortunately I'm not going to buy a new PC or a new phone just to be able to play H264 or .mkv files :-) This Largo Winch file is just over 600mb on disk, a .avi file will be 700mb so you save 100mb but your file can't be viewed by everyone... swings and roundabouts."

[T],FatFreddy06,2011-02-11T14:11Z,"@JetFever it's all about choice, if you're windows 7 pc can not play x264 them there is something wrong with it. if it's free it's free."
,leechgod,2011-03-05T02:31Z,"i have win 7  ....32 bit OS,and it plays with no problems in vlc,try wmp classic....it even plays perfect in vital player in my xperia x10 :):)"
,TenRapesASecond,2011-06-23T11:26Z,Jet fever avi versions which are 700 mb big dont have 1280*544 resolution but much lower usually very poor
,ramalan,2011-07-08T18:47Z,Watchable. But pixel mush. 720p in 600mb simply doesn't work.
,michaelrwatson,2011-07-18T02:31Z,"So this has subtitles for the non-English parts ONLY..? That isn't clear above, and sometimes ""English subs"" are for everything (which is fine if you're deaf but not for the rest of us). "
,rishad007,2012-02-15T20:50Z,"pls move this to ""Highres-Movies""."
,Dropload,2012-03-14T16:12Z,"Pls seed, Im stuck at 44.8% with nothing coming thru!"
