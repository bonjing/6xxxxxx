,Kikee_31,2011-04-28T05:16Z,"Thank you so much for the UL. INSANE DL speed!! took less than 40min. I saw a few back to back episodes of the first season on TV (Showcase channel, in Nfld, Canada anyway) just recently and fell in love with the show. Ive already watched a couple of eps from this DL and the quality is perfect (for my little laptop anyway). Hope they are planning a third season!!  
THANKS again for your UL and to the seeders!!! much appreciated!"

,GooglesPimp,2011-12-06T03:16Z,"@stevesnaz: Use VLC player or download the codec for the audio, you can also correct audio/visual sync problems with VLC, however I haven't came across these issues with this torrent. "
