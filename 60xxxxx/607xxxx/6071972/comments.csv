,tv2rob,2010-12-31T16:43Z,"The most futile, useless, inconsequential, waste of time, ridicule comment on this site: 

Please seed... 

Unbelievable that some will still waste their time writing that..."
,DontPissMeOff,2010-12-31T17:44Z,Don't seed - I don't give a fuck. :)
,deeturtle,2011-01-01T04:57Z,I don't like that half the movie is on cd1 and half is on cd2.  makes it inconvenient to watch and really inconvenient to burn.
,haciendaman,2011-01-01T12:03Z,"deeturtle - you can merge the two files together once downloaded by using something like Windows Movie Maker, although I use Xilisoft Video Converter personally & find it's perfect pretty much every time. You just merge them & choose to save as AVI, Mpeg4 or whatever you want the final merged file to be. Hope that helps!"
,born2b,2011-01-02T00:09Z,Thanks!
,dawdyang,2011-01-04T18:18Z,Extremezone I DL from you all the time knowing I can trust your sourses PLZ PLZ PLZ get a copy of Hereafter Ive been looking daily but nothing. Would greatly appreciate it
,DGR1,2011-01-07T05:20Z,"A 10 V10 excellent job!

,Bit-Step,2011-01-10T03:53Z,"i cant beleive i dl;ed this 

right i mears well save some ppl some time

(if your in the 21 dope smoking demographic)

basically a movie about a horse racing, yet again my eyes have been raped "
,bragazar1710,2011-01-10T09:26Z,thanks.
,strontkegel16,2011-01-12T09:08Z,@Bit-Step: One looks the the imdb page could have told you as much.
,neptune898,2011-01-12T21:04Z,"good, but stop making 2 cd files, we arent in 90's"
,PUFFnKILLERBUDZ,2011-01-31T04:04Z,"I am definitely not new to this site but what I still don’t understand is the movies that are cut into 2 CDs. The file is cut and you have to go to the next one. Not everyone does this, as it is annoying to some people, and I can’t understand why it is done this why. It should only be 1 file for the movie. I am not complaining or bitching, I even rated this as a good quality download, I just don’t understand this method. "
,catpurinn,2011-01-31T08:48Z,"To those bitching and whining. It's cut in half for those who want to burn it. The movie is over 2 hours long. Though not by much, it might still be able to be burned onto 1 disc. 

Can you find ""In God We Tru$t"" with Marty Feldman? It would be greatly appreciated if you can."
[T],ILPruny,2011-03-17T16:27Z,plus zece Extremezone :)
,suspur,2011-03-29T23:52Z,thanks for the movie! 
,Adam_OSFP,2011-05-02T11:56Z,"It's time to abandon Xvid - it doesn't cut it anymore, at least not on tablets and computers. At the same bitrate, x264  is much, much better. The difference is HUDGE! Xvid might be watchable on mobile phones only."
,DrKoNfLiCt,2011-05-03T20:19Z,Extremezone is awesome but 2 CD movie is just retarded...
,serenidad_777,2011-06-02T03:40Z,"You've done it again extremezone, thank you. I don't care that it's on two cd's. It's about the quailty. As I have downloaded from you a few times. And I am still seeding. Again, thanks"
,ddoggg00,2011-09-25T07:29Z,"To catpurinn-

There is no way that this movie is too long to fit on one disc- that stopped being a problem with dvd burners. It was only putting movies on cds that would have required this movies to be on one disc. I can easily put 4 ish hours on one dvd without losing any quality.
