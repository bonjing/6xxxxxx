SUMMARY:
In 2012, amid economic chaos and high unemployment, Americans watch 
by the millions as criminals with life sentences race armored cars on 
Terminal Island. Two-thirds of the combatants die but the winner may 
earn his freedom. On the day he loses his job, steelworker Jensen Ames 
is arrested for his wife's murder. Sent to Terminal Island, he's offered 
an out by the steely and manipulative Warden Hennessey - race as the 
popular mask-wearing (but now dead) champion, Frankenstein, or rot in 
prison. Jensen makes the bargain. As the three-stage race approaches, 
he realizes that the whole thing may be a set up - can an anonymous man 
behind a mask get revenge and win his release?
