,CDLX5342,2011-05-09T12:21Z,"for dual audio it depends on the program. VLC is by far the most accessible freeware video player. If you use VLC just right click while the vid is playing and go to ""audio"" and select track, just change it to the other track to hear HINDI audio. if you play it through your TV it is just under audio options in your menu. Hope this helps! :)"
