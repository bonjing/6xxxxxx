Although some aspects of the ancient discipline of Yoga are currently familiar in the West, the real 
nature and purpose of' this profound science of the soul is still widely misunderstood. And in the East, 
where the discipline was born and reached its peak many centuries ago, much of the knowledge gained 
has since been lost.Gopi Krishna, drawing upon his own experience of Higher Consciousness, has 
re-examined the discipline of Yoga and its psychosomatic lever Kundalini in the light of modern knowledge 
and presents for the first time a clear and comprehensive analysis of this amazing subject. Citing the 
real goal of Yoga and the most effective way to achieve it, he describes the biological and physiological 
aspects of the discipline, the rewards of a successful effort, and the tremendous significance true Yoga 
has for the continued survival and healthy evolution of the race.
