Mary Poppins is as great a movie for most kids as is The Sound of Music
I daresay, and I enjoyed it equally as much as a child myself! In fact it stars
Ms. Julie Andrews equally of course and has a similar storyline to some degree.

Converted from 720p HD bluray sourced mkv to 2GB DivX Avi for a nice download
with with English or German audiotracks at 266k audio bitrate. Includes main
soundtrack selections too.

Lovely British kids in the best example of great spirit, as an example to all!
Great songs for the children to grow up with!


Do enjoy, and happy new year at this launch!
