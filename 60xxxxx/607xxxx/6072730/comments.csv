,Mathlol,2011-02-25T05:23Z,"Two things I noticed:
1. ""Disney HD Cinemagic"" channel watermark is present.
2. character voices only play from the Left speakers.  Music plays on both L/R.  
Overall, a musical with skewed audio is weird."
,ba8y6irl,2012-01-02T23:59Z,I play this on my computer and it's in English and then when I burned it on my dvd player it played in german... did it burn incorrectly?
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2012-02-23T10:24Z,there are two audio tracks - try using your player controls to toggle between them - thank you for downloading - god bless!
