This is a Release of Salt 2010 Deluxe Extended Edition COMPLETE DVD Rip by vladtepes3176
This Release includes:
-700 MB rip to Mp4 of SALT Theatrical version (with the â€œforced English Subtitles burned into the rip for the Russian spoken Dialog)
-700 MB rip to Mp4 of SALT Unrated Directorâ€™s Cut (with the â€œforced English Subtitles burned into the rip for the Russian spoken Dialog)
-700 MB rip to Mp4 of SALT Unrated Extended Cut (with the â€œforced English Subtitles burned into the rip for the Russian spoken Dialog)
NOTE: In the new Deluxe Edition DVD, which contains the Theatrical Version, the Director's Cut and the Extended Cut, we see that:
All three versions have substantially different plots. In both the Director's and Extended Cut, Mike dies by being drowned in front of Salt while Orlov's men keep their guns aimed at her. According to Noyce's commentary, this scene would have earned an R rating for the movie and so was replaced by the scene of Mike's death shown in the theatrical version. Because of the increased violence, both the Extended Cut as well as the Director's Cut lost the PG-13 rating and became "Unrated"[2][3]. Furthermore, in each case the ending is different.
In the Extended Cut, Salt kills Orlov not on the barge near New York, but only at the end of the movie after escaping back to Russia, and she also destroys the ancient monastery where Orlov trained the children as spies.
In the Director's Cut, as Salt runs through the woods on her personal mission to hunt down other sleeper agents, the voiceover heard over the end of the film implies that the new US President is also one of Orlov's sleeper agents.

PLOT: (IMBD) Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent and highly respected by all, including her boss, Ted Winter. Out of the blue, a Russian spy walks into their offices and offers a vital piece of information: the President of Russia will be assassinated during his forthcoming visit to New York City to attend the funeral of the recently deceased U.S. Vice President. The name of the assassin: Evelyn Salt. Concerned about the safety of her husband, who she cannot contact, she goes on the run. Winter refuses to accept that she is a mole or a double agent but her actions begin to raise doubts. Just who is Evelyn Salt and what is she planning?

MEMORABLE QUOTES:
Evelyn Salt: What is your name? 
Vassily Orlov: My name is Vassily Orlov. Today, a Russian agent will travel to New York city to kill the President. This agent is KA-12. 
Evelyn Salt: The KA program is a myth. 
Vassily Orlov: Don't you want to know the name? 
Evelyn Salt: You're good. You can tell the rest of your story to one of my colleagues. 
Vassily Orlov: Salt. 
Evelyn Salt: Yes? 
Vassily Orlov: The name of the agent is Evelyn Salt. 
Evelyn Salt: My name is Evelyn Salt. 
Vassily Orlov: Then you are a Russian spy.

REVIEWS: 
Kirk Honeycutt of the Hollywood Reporter said that, "While preposterous at every turn, Salt is a better Bond movie than most recent Bond movies, as its makers keep the stunts real and severely limit CGI gimmickry"
 Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars (his maximum), saying "Salt is a damn fine thriller. ... It's gloriously absurd. This movie has holes in it big enough to drive the whole movie through. The laws of physics seem to be suspended here the same way as in a Road Runner cartoon."

PLEASE SEED! No LEACHERS! This is nowhere on the net, with all three versions of the film, with the proper â€œburned inâ€ â€œforcedâ€ English subs for the Russian speaking parts of the film, so youâ€™ll actually know what the hell is going on in the film, along with all the extras ripped from the DVD. 
Help get this going! SEED TILL U BLEED! 
Cheers, Happy New Year to Everyone! Grab someone you trust, watch and ENJOY! vladtepes3176
