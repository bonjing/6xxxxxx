I dont know what exactly the problem ur having 

Maybe its compatiblity issues!
what OS are you using??
WIN 7 ? then right click and run as administrator!

Try this site 
http://www.dreamaquarium.com/troubleshooting.html

Do a uninstalling completely , reboot , clean registry , reinstall and run!
make sure ur comp doesnt have any malware or adware issues ... 
use malwarebytes to scan and remove malwares!"

Just a heads up, the extra tanks aren't animated. So they they don't really go well with the animated fish. The default tanks look much better. "
