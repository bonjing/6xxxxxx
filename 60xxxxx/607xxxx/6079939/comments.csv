,condem78,2011-01-04T23:39Z,"@thethingy, sorry about that, it was the way i worded it, what i meant was that currently im running your 32 bit ver of win 7 ultimate and all of them are working sound but the 64 bit ones, but i do know that they have been working all good on other comp that is running 64 bit win7, sorry i did seem to word it wrong in that they wont work with 64 bit but i do know that they work on 64 bit as they are running sound so truly sorry and didnt mean to offend if any was caused!;-)"

5: Deleting the Value ""TrapPollTimeMilliSecs"" In SubKey""SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\RFC1156Agent\CurrentVersion\Parameters"" Had Fault

tried to right-click open and open in command prompt.  Any help here would be greatly appreciated, these plugins are real good.

Running Windows 7 Pro 64bits.  thanks!"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-08T13:35Z,"matthill4569, might be cause its 64, just use regedit to delete the key, if its not there because its a 32 one then ignore the error........."
