I cant play them iv tried VLC, Plex, and quicktime just wondering if anyone else has had problems. the rest work good tho    "
,Nevodaniel,2012-06-15T14:10Z,I fucking love you. I wanted to buy this however they never made the DVD's. I will download and leave comments. Thank you for such a wonderful Torrent! xD
,Nevodaniel,2012-06-16T20:43Z,"Okay, so unfortunately, this isn't as good as i expected but nevertheless, it's hard to find these episodes anyway. The Quality is watchable, the Sound is okay so don't expect too much from this torrent. Two of the episodes don't work (they have an invalid file format), and some Episodes have issues with parts of the videos so they freeze and you have to fast forward to play it again. So overall, its a nice torrent, thank you so much for sharing however because there is no other better version of MasterMinds online (to torrent or download or even purchase), this really is the best one so far. :)"
