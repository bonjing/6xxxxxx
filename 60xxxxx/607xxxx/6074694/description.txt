Storyline: The movie is based on the infamous "Stanford

Prison Experiment" conducted in 1971. A makeshift prison is set up in a research lab, complete

with cells, bars and surveillance cameras. For two weeks 20 male participants are hired to play

prisoners and guards. The 'prisoners' are locked up and have to follow seemingly mild rules,

and the 'guards' are told simply to retain order without using physical violence. Everybody is

free to quit at any time, thereby forfeiting payment. In the beginning the mood between both

groups is insecure and rather emphatic. But soon quarrels arise and the wardens employ ever

more drastic sanctions to confirm their authority.
