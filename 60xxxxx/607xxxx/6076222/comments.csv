quite impressive for the file size. you dont miss the ""missing"" bitrate"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-02T12:39Z,"video 0.09/10
audio 0.008/10

size-compared  to BluRay

video 2.5/10
audio 2.1/10

size-compared to other 720p.

Smaller. Quality is unbeatable, compared to anything in file-size category.

Point being, it's not fair (and sort of stupid) to compare and judge (rate) the quality without:

1. putting the things and personal judgment in real context
2. reading the supplied .nfo
3. knowing the fact that 720p stands for ""pixels"" only. Standard categorize video - not the sound. People are used to Matroska, for no reason at all. Modern mp4 has everything needed. At least here - where people saved a fortune downloading my small-sized stuff for years.

Only 4.2% of computer users have multi-channel audio capabilities, only 0.11% of computer owners have downloaded  a movie from P2P network and only FRACTION have downloaded mp4 ever and only fraction of fraction have - downloaded from me...

If you get something you have not expected - it is, undoubtedly, because of neglecting three points mentioned in lines before."
