     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      The story of the rise and fall of the former Scottish
      Socialist MSP Tommy Sheridan. Convicted of perjury for lying
      about a sex scandal, the film interviews Tommy Sheridan just
      before his conviction, shows the police video tapes of Tommy
      Sheridan's interrogation and speaks to the people linked to the
      trial that gripped Scotland.
