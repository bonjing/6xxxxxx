[V],joshua13,2011-01-04T16:03Z,"it doesn't matter what we say to idiots who blame jews for everything, and/or think they secretly run the world.  Irrational emotions like hatred will not be eliminated by rational arguments. Anything I might say will be dismissed as zionist lies, ignorance, whatever. A closed mind is the hardest thing to open."
,swangpo,2011-01-04T17:08Z," Voltaire turned repeatedly and angrily against Jews who he believed to epitomize such ""tyranny and bigotry."" Jews, he complained, ""are ... the greatest scoundrels who have ever sullied the face of the globe ... They are, all of them, born with raging fanaticism in their hearts, just as the Bretons and Germans are born with blond hair. I would not in the least be surprised if these people would not some day become deadly to the human race ... You [Jews] have surpassed all nations in impertinent fables, in bad conduct, and in barbarism. You deserve to be punished, for this is your destiny"" (Gould, 91). "

Philostratus, an ancient Greek author, believed that Jews ""have long since risen against humanity itself. They are men who have devised a misanthropic life, who share neither food nor drink with others."" (Cf. Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, I, iii.) The great Roman historian Tacitus (A.D. 56-120) declared that ""the Jews are extremely loyal toward one another, and are always ready to show compassion [for their fellow Jews], but toward other people they feel only hate and enmity"" (Morais, 46).
