Thanks"
,mdiggity,2011-01-04T05:29Z,Thank u for ur awesome uploads... I do have a quick question though... I watch on my Sony blue ray player and it will not play the .m4v files.  Someone told me that I can very easily save the file as a .mp4.  Is it possible to do without re-encoding the entire video?
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-04T06:25Z,Rename to .mp4 in that case
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-04T16:23Z,Damages starts 1/5/2011 on DirecTV channel 101.
