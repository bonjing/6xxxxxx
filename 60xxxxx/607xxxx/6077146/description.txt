The Alan Parsons Project was a British progressive rock band, active between 1975 and 1990, consisting of Eric Woolfson and Alan Parsons surrounded by a varying number of session musicians.
Behind the revolving lineup and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Woolfson was a lawyer by profession, but also a composer and pianist. Parsons was a successful producer and accomplished engineer. Almost all songs on Project's albums are credited to "Woolfson/Parsons".

**** [Greatest] CDRips 2011 [Bubanee]
Will be CDRips from myself or other known 'Private Uploaders' 
There will be NO TRANSCODED MP3s in any of these Collections.. 
These Collections will not be proper albums due to the fact that most 
'Greatest Hits' contain not only the greatest hits but other added Music to 
round out the album.. 
My aim is to remove the Music or non popular songs of that particular 
Artist/Band and leave the good stuff! (Hope my Judgement is good, hey.. lol)
So some will contain not many songs where others will contain more! and 
remember they will be once only CDRips, nothing but the best. Because that's 
what you deserve.. 

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
