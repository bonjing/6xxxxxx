***This is a re-edited version of the film, done by me***

Star Trek IV Squid Version, beta version 2. 


Captain Kirk and the crew travel back in time to locate some *giant squids* and travel forward into time where they will tell the probe the hell it needs. 


(There are a few things I'd rather change about this edit, but it is watchable).

This is the h.264 mp4 rip of the DVD found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6075658/STIVSV_-_Star_Trek_IV_Squid_Version

***Bonus now with English subtitles***.
