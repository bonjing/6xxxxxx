I rely heavily on subtitles or CC in English so I can keep the volume down fairly low.  It's so hard to find torrents with English subs, so I really appreciate it!  Now if only some of those leechers would seed.  Right now I'm not getting anything at all. :("
,zoneone,2011-07-29T17:50Z,No subs here... and the audio sounds a bit weak... I think I'll try another torrent to compare with.
