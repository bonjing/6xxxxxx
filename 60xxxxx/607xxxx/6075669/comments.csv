Sound sucks to. But still thanks for the torrent."
,AriGold45,2011-01-09T03:10Z,"It's really not that horrible of a version.  It's a little grainy, and the audio has a slight echo from being recorded in the theater, but it's really not that bad.  

Being that it's an MP4 and only 212MB, I'm assuming the Uploader intended this to be played on a Smart Phone or a portable video player such as the IPod Touch.  In this case, the film would be very watchable, with headphones and a small screen.  

On the other hand, I don't recommend watching this on your computer, especially if you have a large flat screen, as I do.  I don't think it would be such a terrible movie once you converted it to .vob and watched it on a television, but to each his own.  

It's not like the movie is extremely dark or the audio is extremely quiet, it is simply a bit grainy.  If this one's not for you, wait for a better TS or Screener.
