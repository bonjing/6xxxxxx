Frances O'Brien is back in the library. Melvil Dewey is turning in his grave.

Frances Oâ€™Brien, devout Catholic and panic disorder sufferer, is back in charge of the library. And breathing harder into her paper bag than ever. Her daughters are out of control, her marriage is on its last legs and Nada, her Muslim colleague, is being touted as the N.B.L. (Next Big Librarian).

Christineâ€™s return to the Childrenâ€™s Library isnâ€™t helping either. Sheâ€™s hot, single and seven months pregnant. Great. Now thereâ€™s no escape from Frances thinking about being a motherâ€¦ and a loverâ€¦ and a Librarian.

Starring Robyn Butler, Roz Hammond, Bob Franklin, Heidi Arena, Stephen Ballantyne, Nicole Nabout, Keith Brockett, Kim Gyngell and Wayne Hope. With special guests include Vince Colosimo, Noni Hazelhurst and Hamish Blake.
