You tell 'em RELOADED... ;)

Thanks for the upload :)"
,Fox_Almighty,2011-02-20T03:26Z,"FYI, even with this patch, the in-game is still very buggy... certain locked stuff don't want to open even when you have the key for them, I can't hand Lovis his scrying Stone for some odd reason, charms and enchantments cannot be used at all, things like that. And it makes the gameplay very frustrating."
,RockDeviI,2012-02-11T14:02Z,"When i start the game, it crashes after the opening scene where the guy runs after the dragon.. i dont even get to the character creation, does anyone know how to fix this? "
