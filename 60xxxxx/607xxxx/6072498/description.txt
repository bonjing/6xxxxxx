Casting Crowns - Until The Whole World Hears LIVE

In an unprecedented six-year span with nearly 4.5 million career album sales, a GRAMMY Award, an American Music Award, 23 Dove Awards and 8 chart-topping radio singles, Casting Crowns remains focused on discipleship through music. With lead singer and songwriter Mark Hallâ€™s 18 years in youth ministry, the bandâ€™s message remains rooted in the student services he has led on a weekly basis since 2001, at Eagles Landing Baptist church near Atlanta. The songs start as messages for his 400 teenagers and their families. With boldly honest, hard-hitting lyrics, the band continues to challenge, strengthen and pour into the body of Christ, giving listeners a fresh, relevant perspective on loving God and loving people.

Living life with a kingdom focus, a reaching-out, loving-the-world-like-Jesus-does purpose â€“ thatâ€™s the focus of the bandâ€™s fourth studio album titled Until The Whole World Hears. Millions of fans wonâ€™t be disappointed as these seven gifted musicians continue to speak truth into todayâ€™s culture through this new 12-song collection.
