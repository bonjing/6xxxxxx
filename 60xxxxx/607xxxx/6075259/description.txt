Comments :
They call him "Handsome" Harry Sweeney. At 52, the Vietnam veteran has kept 
his rugged good looks. Everyone likes Harry, an electrician by trade who loves 
to sing but for some reason he never lets anyone get too close. He's been 
divorced for a long time, has a son whom he rarely sees, and, although he's 
engaged in a long-term flirtation with the waitress at the diner, seems destined 
to remain alone. One day, Harry gets a call from a former Navy buddy, Tom Kelly, 
whom he hasn't seen in some thirty years. On his deathbed and terrified of going 
to Hell, Kelly convinces Harry to seek forgiveness on his behalf from a comrade 
they betrayed long ago, David Kagan. At first, Harry wants nothing to do with 
Kelly, Kagan or the remnants of his murky past. But guilt and memories have a 
mysterious grasp on Harry, and he finally relents, driving down the East Coast 
to call on his old comrades. As he confronts the three other men involved in a 
long-ago crime...
