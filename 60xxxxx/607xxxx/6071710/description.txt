Dannyâ€™s ready to go on a blind date when the doorbell rings, and he finds a sexy, but older Carolyn. Thinking that he was going out with a peer, for a moment heâ€™s confused. Explaining that she is his date, Carolyn pushes her way into the house, and talking a mile a minute, starts wandering around, and asking a ton of questions. Realizing that he better just accept the fact that heâ€™s about to go out with a cougar, he suggests they head to the restaurant. Opening the door to head out, she immediately closes it, and in no uncertain terms lets him know that sheâ€™s not interested in going out for dinner. This cougar is hunting! Sheâ€™s found her prey, and now sheâ€™s going to taste him!
