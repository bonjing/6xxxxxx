so is there a crack file??????"
,Bandi_t,2011-01-28T23:18Z,"@Boomzor: after installing the game, BEFORE you start the game, you need copy all the files from the crack folder and copy them into the gamefolder on the harddrive(C:), Program files( or where-ever you install the game). once you clicked to copy the files into the folder your computer is going to ask if you want to replace the files. Click 'yes' on all of them and your done. you can now start the game and enjoy your cracked COD, have fun. :-)"

,whippy6,2011-08-03T06:03Z,"Thanks allusde.. It works..Initially I installed into a different drive/directory with directx and it gave a ton of problems primarily steam related errors (steam_api not found , exit info in steam api .. bl bla ). Tried a lot of things but no luck.
So i uninstalled and reinstalled into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that comes during setup then copied the Skidrow crack mentioned earlier. That did the trick.. pc config, core 2 duo 1.8Ghz,2 Gb RAm, Nvidia 7300 Gt card, WIndows XP +Sp3. So not even a gaming rig. I play at 1024x768. Laggy  but managed to  complete the first mission without any problems.(crash , black screen, etc)
For some reason I think its tied into the DEFAULT DIRECTORY that pops up during setup.. Hopefully the updates would solve the lag..BTW a folder PLAYERS is created in the once any mission is completed.. A backup of that before running the update may help "
,koei126,2011-08-03T22:47Z,"Ok seriously people, you are all asking the same damn questions over and over again. Heres an answer to 90% of these fucking things. First, get an iso mounting program (daemon tools lite), mount the iso, then use an archive software (winrar), open the damn iso, extract the skidrow folder. Copy the files from the skidrow folder, then paste them over the files in the main game folder (example, C:/program files/cod). some of you may need to restart your computer, or allow firewall permissions. I still havent figured out how to enable zombies, and there IS NO ONLINE PLAY SO STOP ASKING!!!!!!!! Oh, and the last bit, is SEED YOUR FUCKING TORRENTS!!!! Also as a side note, any dll you may be missing can be found by typing it's name on google and just downloading it from one of the hundreds of dll sites for free."

,absolutbad,2011-09-07T02:50Z,"This doesn't work. The uploader is fucking with you. There is no ""crack"" folder. He then sends you to Skidrow's torrent which does not work either. As a matter of fact they are the same upload except no crack folder on this one. After you install the game and overwrite the original exe's with Skidrow's you are able to see then intro and then the game just hangs. Don't waste your time."

,Pauper,2011-10-29T06:36Z,"Ok, first of all ,,
THERE IS NO SKIDROW ( or crack ) FOLDER !!!
Second ...
@koei126 You OBVIOUSLY have NO IDEA what you're talking about, ( i.e. if you ""Mount the ISO"" then you  DON'T NEED Winrar to 'extract' anything, THE ISO is ALREADY OPENED ... that's what 'mounting' it does, it OPENS it ) so why don't you drop the smart-ass attitude and KEEP YOUR LITTLE SCRIPT KITTY MOUTH SHUT, you retarded monkey !!"

,wonderbo,2012-01-29T23:46Z,"Its unbelievable how many retarded comments there are for this torrent. Why does it seem that this game sparked a mass movement of noobs to pirate bay?

Anyway, I bring to you the dumbass's guide to downloading this torrent!

1) DOUBLE Click ""Get This Torrent"" not SINGLE click, DOUBLE CLICK. 

2) Click ""yes"" on any message that it gives you. For now I'm going to assume you are using uTorrent.

3) Wait for the game to download

4) When it finishes download DO NOT CLICK STOP. Let it seed so we can let other people download this game at a reasonable time.

5) Download PowerISO, MagicDisk, or Daemon Tools. 

6) Go to your downloads folder

7) Mount the .iso file using the ISO manager you downloaded earlier (Daemon Tools, etc)

8) A prompt should pop up asking you to run the setup.exe file. do it

9) Install the game

10) Run the game by DOUBLE CLICKING the Black ops icon on your desktop

OH NOES! Does it say d3dx9_43.dll is missing?? Google the file and click on the first link. Then click ""download""

Move this file from your downloads folder to the folder that Black ops is in (Which should be C:\Program files\Activision)

Try again.

OH NOES! I NEED STEAM TO BE RUNNING?? No. 

1)Click this link: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5946234/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_CRACK_ONLY-SKIDROW

2) Extract the file by using 7zip or winrar. If you do not know what these are, please shoot yourself. You do not belong on Pirate Bay, let alone on this planet. 

3) Move all the files in this folder to the same location black ops is in (C:\Program Files\Activision\Black ops)

4) Replace all of them. Click on ""Replace and Move"" if it promps you

5) Run the game by double clicking the icon on the desk top.

Remember:
ZOMBIES DOES NOT WORK
MULTIPLAYER DOES NOT WORK
WHEN IN DOUBT, RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR

Yes, go and cry that multiplayer in ""Famas of duty, AK74U rapid fire ops"" does not work. If you want to play multiplayer, actually buy the damn game or get an xbox so you can use your Famas and AK74U rapid fire again. 



Thank You. "
