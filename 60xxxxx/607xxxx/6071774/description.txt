Urabamba is the name of the river which winds at the foot of Machu Picchu, the last stronghold of the Incas against European conquest. So it is altogether fitting this river should have lent its name to a quartet of Peruvian musicians who are devoted to the preservation of the music of Inca culture. Like a river, Urubamba flows with a natural ease and strength which suggests an indomitable culture. It is...a source of continual fascination with its alternately stately and martial rhythms, its sometimes festive, sometimes wistful, sometimes absolutely mournful air....Urubamba is best known in Europe and North America for its contributions to a pair of Paul Simon recordings. Simon first met the band...in Paris in 1965. They gave him one of their albums, and it so intrigued him that he wrote the lyrics to one of their melodies which became Simon and Garfunkel's "El Condor Pasa." Later, they accompanied him on "Duncan" from his first solo album, and on his 1973 concert tour....It was during this time that Urubamba was recorded, using the traditional Inca instruments: la quena, flutes of varying length and pitch; la antara, the panpipe; la charango, the guitar-like stringed instrument; and la bombo leguero, the massive willow and goat-skin drum....Listening to it, one feels that he has penetrated to the heart of a lost culture....Like the music of the Appalachian mountains, these Inca melodies are a high, lonesome sound which reach out beyond the time and place of their creation--whether seven or seven hundred years ago--to speak to everyone who hears them today.---Dave Marsh
