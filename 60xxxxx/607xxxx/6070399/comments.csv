,grbavac,2010-12-29T10:25Z,Is this game compatible with win. vista?
,Philonetic,2011-06-06T23:21Z,"Wow I can't believe this torrent is still alive somewhere.  I'd love some feedback on the mods package and anyones troubleshooting experience.
And just so everyone knows, this is NOT the ""Ultima"" version, this is the FULL version, able to be modded etc.  I've changed the package a little since the old days, Saints old high res patch gives false positives on some antivirus.  I've got a new package with a no-false-positive high res patch and some other updated goodies, I'll make a torrent of it this summer sometime."
,Philonetic,2011-06-06T23:22Z,Cheers RoRo
,Philonetic,2011-06-06T23:23Z,I'll seed this till next windows =)
,Chamberneazy,2011-06-16T07:49Z,"Okay so am new to this and all the steps I understand, but step 4.  Do I stick the whole ff7_opengl-0.7.9b folder into the “c:\program files\square soft, inc\final fantasy vii” section?"
,Chamberneazy,2011-06-18T19:45Z,"I found out the step i was having trouble on. but now when i start the game it goes black till i hit the esc key which takes me to the ""new game"" screen.  After i click on new game my screen goes black and nothing that i have tried will get me pass it. I have windows 7."
,Philonetic,2011-06-19T21:44Z,"The black screen, video codecs.  Install k-lite codec pack and the included TrueMotion2.0, if that doesn't solve it, try running the game in different compatibility modes."
,Chamberneazy,2011-06-20T07:26Z,I installed both k-lite codec and trumotion 2.0 and now the game goes black for about 5 seconds and then kicks me out.
,Philonetic,2011-06-22T01:33Z,Did you try running it in different compatibility modes?
,Chamberneazy,2011-06-25T07:38Z,Yeah i tried it even with different compatibility modes. should i try downloading the hd mod?
,Chamberneazy,2011-06-25T07:57Z,okay right after i wrote that last comment i tried to start the game and now it all works like a charm. thank you for all your help.
,Shadowloo,2011-07-08T01:23Z,"Well, i have a little trouble with the install.
It loads yhe screen for the install, but when I hit the INSTALL button, it send me to the desktop, but doesn't start the download.

Anyone can help me?"
,kkiizzuu,2011-07-13T07:49Z,"Hello ,  I got such a problem that i dont find the file “ff7inst.exe”   at the beginning to start installing . Any ideas ?"
,kkiizzuu,2011-07-13T07:59Z,"I dont find the “ff7inst.exe”  file anywhere , any ideas? :s"
,Philonetic,2011-07-13T09:09Z,"@Shadowloo Not sure what you mean.

@kkiizzuu You need to mount the image (cd) file with a program like ""Power ISO"", then install from the virtual cd-rom.  This is all in the readme.

You can also rename the image files to .iso"
,kkiizzuu,2011-07-14T20:30Z,"Ok i made it iso file and now when im trying to burn it on disk it says ""selected disk image file isnt valid""i got DVD+R disc 8.5GB  also tried with CD but nothing :/"
,Sneil29,2011-07-16T22:55Z,"Doesn't work.  followed instructions word for word(aside from step three which has zero instruction on what to do with that file) and I get an error upon load up the the program has to close.  Whatever, I was really looking forward to this too. "
,Sneil29,2011-07-16T23:04Z,"Didn't work for me.  Don't know where my last comment went, but as I said, step three had no info on what to do with said file.

I installed it all word for word, mounted disk1 afterwords, load up the exe and the screen goes black then I get a windows error saying I need to close the program..."
,medicca,2011-07-18T11:55Z,"When I mount with DAEMON tools, it asks me if i want to run set-up. I click cancel.

I open the folder containing the install files and I open ff7inst.exe as told using admin settings.

The mouse cursor changes to the loading cursor. 

After 5 seconds, nothing happens. I go to the task manager and it tells me setup.exe is running, but nothing otherwise.

Any clue?"
,PetersVR,2011-07-21T20:05Z,"Im new at this, so i dont know the steps, if someone can go over them that would be great.

 played this game when i was a kid but ended up unable to play during the years, ill never get rid of my first copy, but i want to play again bad, anyone who can help?"
,tang982,2011-07-22T02:52Z,"When I try to start the game it says ""Please insert FF7 game 1, 2, or 3 and try again."" What should I do?"
,tang982,2011-07-22T17:41Z,I got that fixed but now its stuck on the insert disc 1 screen......... even after i mounted it
,jacz,2011-07-25T08:26Z,"confused how do you download the pack.  I get a tiny file from ""download this torrent"" and download managers from the download and play now links.  what am i doing wrong?"
,Philonetic,2011-08-06T05:21Z,I'm on the latest Windows7 x64 Auto-Act and it's running like a champ
,revelationmrt,2011-08-28T05:24Z,"I'm having an install issue too. After i click the warning high graphic popup during installation, i go straight to the desktop. :( installation stops right there. "
,11770,2011-09-19T09:37Z,"i had installed the game as the read-me says, but afterwards asks me to insert disk 1 2 or 3 whats wrong with it?"
,11770,2011-09-19T20:55Z,"IMPORTANT: for those of you like me that recieve the insert disk message when trying to run the game INSTALL THE HD MOD, then add the values to the registry when it prompts and configure the ff vii sound also within the ff vii stuff then run it from the ff vii sound menu. 
I HOPE I HELPED  have fun XD"
,11770,2011-09-20T23:38Z,"also, if you can't play the remixed songs, switch your ""sound output"" to the ""out_wave.dll"" and configure it to use your speakers in the ""ffviimusic .exe"""
,Alias22732,2011-09-22T04:42Z,"I have the same problem as medicca, where I click on FF7inst and run as admin and everything but then the cursor just changes to the loading thing and nothing happens. Any help anyone?"
,MugenHeadNinja,2011-10-08T06:09Z,if anybody still comes here still PLEASE SEED there is 0 seeders on and ive been downloading for weeks and im still at 0% please seed people i beg you all this is the ONLY working final fantasy 7 pc game that works and thats not Ultima Edition and has 30 seeders (but like i said they arnt on which is why i have 0 people seeding)
,timjcedar,2011-10-16T18:13Z,I still cant get this to run need help Pls
,k0ticgood,2011-10-18T12:37Z,"It's already been mentioned twice in the comments, but no one has replied, and I have the same question. Step 3 in the readme is totally useless; it just confuses me. Are we supposed to just leave the folder where it is, or do we have to copy files into the ff7 game directory? There are no instructions in step 3, it just says mod provided."
,throm,2011-10-21T22:18Z,"Download works great! One question though, anyone know why the music mod included with this doesn't play the chocobo riding theme? It's in the FF7 music folder, just doesn't play."
,moongewl,2011-12-05T18:42Z,"I installed and the game will run, but the graphics are completely screwed up. Parts of the screen are red, green, or black, and the resolution seems messed up as well, but I wouldn't swear to it. I'm guessing I screwed up the installation of the OpenGL mod, but I don't know how since there's no explanation of how you're actually supposed to install it."
,moongewl,2011-12-05T18:50Z,"Nevermind--After more messing around with the configuration, I got that cleared up. Incidentally, I *think* you just have to copy the OpenGL files into the main FF7 folder. I did that and then moved the OpenGL folder and its contents into the FF7 folder, which seems to have not broken anything."
,Philonetic,2011-12-21T20:29Z,"Alright so this mod package has somehow gotten all screwed up.  The creator of ReMix and all of the comments on the release page say it doesn't work very well and nobody has tested a full playthrough.  Soooo, for those of you having sound problems, crash errors, black screens, CD issues, etc.

I've uploaded an Original mod pack with all the mods separated and the old original readme's included, you can find it here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903748

You can find my alternate mod package with the newer creations here - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6903757

Don't stop seeding this torrent!  It's hard to find the non-ultima version."
,Primon9,2012-01-24T15:42Z,"This is just my opinion, but I found it much easier to get the original psx version and run epsxe with filters and high res textures on.  The problem with this PC version is the usual problem when trying to port something from any console to PC: getting it run on windows right.  It may not look as nice as the HD mod, I haven't seen it, but at least it will work..."
,Philonetic,2012-02-23T13:11Z,"It is easier to play the PSX version, but you won't have the HD FMV's, models, avatars, etc.  If you don't like it you don't have to comment, go play your PSX.  For some of us it's worth the effort."
,AngelusMrmA,2012-02-25T11:25Z,"I followed the instructions, step by step. Installed the game with all of the mods described, with HD mod the last. Reinstalled twice, and always the same error.
I get the black screen (game tries to start) which closes after 2-3 seconds.
Running a 64-bit Windows 7.
Anyone had the problem? If so, how to solve it?"
,chia14,2012-03-16T17:57Z,"Also same problem as Alias22732. >.<
Is there anything you need to do before installing the game?"
,DonnyM1,2012-04-09T13:57Z,"Not working. :'(
I followed the instructions word for word, then when I mount Disc 1 on Daemon Tools Lite and open the game, I get the New Game/Continue screen, and when I press New Game, it just goes black and stays that way.
I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit.
Please help?"
,Philonetic,2012-04-28T06:49Z,"Guys, STOP USING THIS MOD PACKAGE, IT'S OUT DATED -

,Navcaru,2012-05-23T01:30Z,"I have to bring attention to a certain unanswered question and issue with your read me text.
k0ticgood is right, step 3 is not clear at all, are we to run the config file? extract it? Cut & paste? Answers please!"
