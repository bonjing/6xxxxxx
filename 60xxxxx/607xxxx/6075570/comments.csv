Best rip for this movie, ever. Not hardcoded subs, which just makes this perfect. Go for it and seed."

I was stupid to erase it because of the file and the last 30 dead seconds after the credits (30 seconds of a black screen) I couldn't take off. Please download this rip, I've tried all the other ones and they have drops, english dubs, hardcoded subs and similar."
