[V],twentyforty,2011-01-01T16:07Z,"There were two, both were in theaters in 2009... And - there would be no more Best of 2010, one movie is 'voted' as the best, and one was second best."
,r-0987,2011-01-01T16:14Z,"you can drop the lower size verson of this movie if you want! sorry for the requests but i can't find a suitable size for this movie - Big [1988]

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094737/

could you upload it or give me a link!"
,X3MEX,2011-01-01T17:11Z,"now its 1gb for a single 720p rip, it keeps getn better n better, :) not a fan of these genre though"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-01T17:40Z,"@r-0987: In Google enter

[divx] Big (1988)

and you'll get hits on Page 1 (go QSS, it's good, I checked right now).

Learn to Google, I feel stupid for doing this instead of you. Anybody can Google, right?

@X3MEX: It's 2 hours long movie. It is actually smaller than it would be if calculated needed bitrate was followed through blindly.

I just encoded Texas Chainsaw Massacre - 1h34 only, 720p as this one - but  1.37 GB. 

People do bitching about the sizes - straight from their ass, generally."

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-01T18:49Z,"@dark_defender: Only 272p is compatible (as stated). Other formats are to big for ""i"" family and relatives.
I do not advise nor recommend to re-encode my files, but to get high quality inputs.
However, people reported nice results with HandBrake (use iPhone presets).

Maybe other people would suggest something else, but I cannot."

Thanks and Happy New Year
Got this one already great movie, always worth another watch. 

As for Ipods/iPhones. yes Handbrake does well and allows croping of widescreen movies to 480x320 to exactly fit screen resolution"
