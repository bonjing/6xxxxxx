,ChocoboDreams,2012-03-27T21:46Z,"I'm stuck at 96.2%. :/ If anyone can seed, it'd be very much appreciated. I'm going through hell trying to get KOTOR working on Vista, and from what I hear, the best of PC version works fine. I'm more than happy to seed once I've gotten it, though I doubt anyone other than me is actually looking for this torrent. :P "
