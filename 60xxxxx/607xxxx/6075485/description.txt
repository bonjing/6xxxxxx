"Come on Wishbone, whats the story Wishbone...."

You remember him, the little brown and white puppy who used to delight us with versions of his favorite stories featuring him and made for children.

My fiancee asked me since i seem to be able to find any show, could i find that show for her. After extensive searching on the net, I was able to find these rips of them. MP4 rips, a couple of them have some screwed up audio and picture from being recorded straight from satellite. Theres only one other torrent i seen of this and it was only 3 shows and no seeds. I'll seed indefinitely so please help and seed as well to keep this alive
