,solodad7,2011-07-07T05:59Z,this is not quicktime pro you ass
,end0fdayz,2011-08-18T05:52Z,"To solodad7, this *IS* PRO. You must install the program FIRST. After it's installed, open quicktime player, and do this:

1. In the menu, click ""Edit"", ""Preferences"", ""Register"".
2. A new window will open. Copy the info from the text file into the ""Registered To"" box, and the ""Registration Code"".
(You don't have to fill in ""Organization"").
3. Click ""Apply"", ""OK"", and you're done.

P.S. Thanks, kentucky-kid! Hats off to you for this. :D"
