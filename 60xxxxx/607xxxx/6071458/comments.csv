20 shows on one DVD - now that's what I call ""compressed"".  But it's perfectly watchable.
V = 6 and A = 7"

But I seeded for 3 days and pumped in 30 GB and filled up 8 other Seeds.  As soon as they got the video in their greedy little hands they immediately stopped sharing it.  I can't pump in another 30 GB and get a cease and desist letter from my ISP.  It seems unless you have a hundred or more downloaders then the torrent just dies because 90% grab it and delete it. "
