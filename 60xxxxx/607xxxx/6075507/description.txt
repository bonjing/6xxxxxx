This is a Pre-Installation Enviroment running the Windows XP Home kernal.  You burn it to your CD, and then you can run your computer off of your CD/DVD ROM.  It contains a great program that I have added called EASEUS TODO BACKUP, which can back up an entire hard drive (or partition), and can restore it by completely erasing the boot drive and just restore the contents, unlike some backup software, which generally runs off of your boot drive, and when you restore, oftentimes files are not restored because they could not erase the old file as it was being used.
