,keleieke,2011-01-22T03:26Z,Thanks for turning me on to funky Cee-Lo.  I like the Colbert's Live better than the official video.  You doin' ok?
,jackalope77,2011-01-22T22:13Z,"Hey keleieke: Youre welcome, Colbert was the first time I heard of CeeLo myself, but i really liked that performance so I thought id pass it on.  Doing alright, thanks for asking, just havent had the bandwidth to upload much lately.  Been downloading a ton of stuff and its hard enough seeding all that back without ULing stuff of my own.  But I do have a couple that are ripped and ready to UL, so maybe I will get back on track soon."
