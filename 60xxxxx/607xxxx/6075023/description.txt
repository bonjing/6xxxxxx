Books include how to, analysis, and research for ecological and food growing systems. 
I recommend NOT downloading the whole package, but selecting the books you desire as some books have two versions: A complete PDF (of higher quality, potentially for printing), and one that is OCRed (but not proofread, hence \"UNEDITED\")
