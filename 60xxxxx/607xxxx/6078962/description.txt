Henryk Szaro was a theater director and screenwriter and also fond of adapting important oeuvres of Polish literature; due to his Jew heritage (he also directed films in Yiddish), he died at the Warsaw ghetto.

"Mocny Czlowiek" was one of those adaptations that Szaro liked so much; this time the film was based in a controversial novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Przybyszewsky, known as "the discoverer of the human naked soul", a literary reflection that it is not exclusive of that time or country. This can be seen in the plot of the film that depicts the story of Henryk Bieleck ( performed by the Russian actor Herr Gregori Chmara ) who is a mediocre journalist that, dreaming of fame and glory, doesn't hesitate to lead his ill friend Jerzy Gorski, a writer, to death in order to appropriate his unknown manuscript. It's the perfect way to achieve success without effort for Bielecki.

The film is very interesting for many reasons. The first one it is the present importance of the story, that is to say, the pursuit of fame and glory without, if possible, by the sweat of the brow (about this, the aristocracy are experts in the subject). It is a common subject in those silent times and even more in this longhaired times. Hypocrisy and immorality is present to such an extent that the main character doesn't care if he finally achieves what he wants. That's not to mention that his wife, Lucja, shares more or less the same opinion, in spite of the fact that she discovers the fraud. She only wants that her lover will love her until the end of times. Problems appear precisely when Bielecki falls in love with Nina, a beautiful and idle woman, and that will ignite the wrath of Lucja. It is an interesting reflection, certainly, on the humanity and the sense of justice that only appears when one's is cuckoldedâ€¦ In its technical aspects, "Mocny Czlowiek" its a remarkable film, using a vigorous film narrative (camera movements or dissolves and over impression shots) for the developing of the story. What struck this German Count is the editing of the film by Szaro, thrilling images and dramatic intensity that ends Bielecki's farce in the farce of a theater, in what it is a curious and bizarre premiÃ¨re.
