You're no idiot, of course. You know that nearly everyone in America is doing yoga--including Madonna 
and Oprah--and that it is said to reduce stress better than virtually any other activity. But when it comes 
to finding the time and energy for a yoga session and getting a much-needed aerobic workout, you'd 
rather meditate in front of the TV. Don't vegetate--invigorate! The Complete Idiot's Guide to Power Yoga, 
by master yogi Geo Takoma, combines the healing poses and stretches of traditional yoga with an exhilarating 
workout that requires as little as 20 minutes a day.
