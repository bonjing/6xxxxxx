And i think its a False Positive (i hope :S) well it should be since the infected file is the patch."

,tripper511,2011-01-27T01:08Z,"Worked great! Was able to install over my older cracked version of Diskeeper.  For anyone having problems I made installation instructions:

Diskeeper Pro Premier 14.0 Build 913 Installation 

Instructions:

1) Choose x86 folder for 32 bit operating system
(if you don't know what bit version you have then you most likely have a 32 bit one).

2) At product license screen choose ""I purchased and downloaded the software"". Then click next.

3) On next page check the box ""Additional options is license cannot be found"". Then click next.

4) Check the box ""I cannot find the License File and want to install Diskeeper as trialware"". Then click next.

5) Click next on the next few pages then click install.

6) After install is finished run the patch program.

7) That's it. Enjoy!"

Pour les français, il suffit de charger la version démo 30 jours sur le site de diskeeper et d'appliquer simplement le patch fourni ici.
Ca fonctionne très bien."
