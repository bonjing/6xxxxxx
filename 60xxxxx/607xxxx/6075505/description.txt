Diskeeper Pro Premier 2010 14.0 Build 913 (x32-x64)

New DiskeeperÂ® performance software 2010 will make your PC(s) faster, more efficient, more reliable and last longer. And use less electricity too! How? All computers suffer from fragmentation â€“ where files are broken up and scattered all across your disk drives. This makes it take longer to read, write and save files. Plus since your PC is working harder than it needs to, more wear and tear occurs. Diskeeper with new IntelliWriteâ„¢ fragmentation prevention resolves this by preventing up to 85% of all fragmentation from happening in the first place. Any remaining fragmentation is quickly eliminated in real time thanks to Diskeeperâ€™s InvisiTaskingÂ® technology. With new Diskeeper 2010 your computers simply run better than new all the time! Your computers will run faster with Diskeeper 2010 installed. Youâ€™ll enjoy using every aspect of your systemâ€”from downloading to accessing files to surfing the web with greater ease and efficiency. 

Leave hang-times, freeze-ups and other fragmentation-based crashes in the dust.


File fragmentation on your computerâ€™s hard drive is one of the most basic reasons for slows, hangs, crashes and system errors. Left alone, it will bring your computer to a halt. Fragmentation is continual and with the number of todayâ€™s applications, peripherals, and file sizes, it accumulates hourly. No manual defragmenter will prevent this. Diskeeper 2010 is the only defragmenter ever built that defragments in real time without requiring a schedule. Your computer will run faster with Diskeeper 2010 installed - period.

Available in Diskeeper 2010, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance.

InvisiTaskingÂ® technology offers true transparent, background processing technology allows Diskeeper 2010 to defragment your computer in real-time, completely eliminating the need for cumbersome maintenance operations. Free up gridlocked resources and let your computer hum along at peak performance. Diskeeper 2010 Professional enhances the reliability and performance of your computerâ€”automatically! 

Diskeeper 2010 I-FAASTÂ® file optimization technology accelerates file access times to meet the heavy workloads of file-intensive applications. Utilizing a specially formulated technology, I-FAAST closely monitors file usage and organizes the most commonly accessed files for the fastest possible access, boosting file access and creation to speeds above and beyond the capabilities of your system when it was new, up to 80% faster.  

High-power computer systems require high power-defragmentation engines. Only Diskeeper 2010 includes the advanced technology necessary to eliminate large volume fragmentation found on big and busy computers. The remarkable Terabyte Volume Engineâ„¢ (TVE) technology. TVE is the only defrag technology with the necessary horsepower to eliminate the rapid fragmentation build-up that occurs in high-traffic volumes that handles millions of files.
TVE was initially developed for the highest capacity servers but has now also become essential for the high end power user. Large databases, CAD programs -- Diskeeper 2010 handles the biggest jobs fast and thoroughly. The greater the number of files and fragments on a volume, the more dramatic TVE's benefits will be. Nothing compares to TVE's ability to eliminate enterprise level fragmentation. In a class of its own, TVE makes real-time power computer defragmentation a fact.

Diskeeper 2010 Professional FEATURES:
* New! IntelliWriteâ„¢ fragmentation prevention technology. IntelliWrite prevents up to 85% of the fragmentation every system suffers from. It intelligently writes contiguous files to the disk so system resources are not wasted creating fragmentation. The results? A whole new level of system speed and efficiency beyond what can be achieved with defragmentation alone.
* InvisiTaskingÂ® technology â€”Available in Diskeeper 2010, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance.
* Real-time defragmentation â€”Handle fragmentation as it occurs, providing maximum speed and performance at all times!
* Uncompromising file and free space defragmentation â€”Defragment in the most extreme hard drive environments. Diskeeper 2010 eliminates fragmentation even on disks with as little as 1% free space or files split in millions of fragments.
* "Defragmentation Intelligence" enhancements â€”Diskeeper monitors and analyzes each drive, then chooses a defragmentation strategy specific to the needs of that drive. Every drive is defragmented using the best method possible.
* I-FAASTÂ® 2.0 (Intelligent File Access Acceleration Sequencing Technology) automatically boosts access speeds for the most commonly used files.
* Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) Compatibility mode â€”Diskeeper works intimately with the automatic backup system already on your PC. VSS compatibility mode means Diskeeper does not damage your ability to recover lost files and does not take up valuable free space with necessary file information.
* Automatic online directory consolidation boosts antivirus scans and back-up speed.
* Native 64 bit operating systems support.
* BOOT-TIME MODE safely performs MicrosoftÂ® recommended defragmentation of critical system files.
* Network Management Support â€”control Diskeeper settings and functionality via Diskeeper Administrator edition or Group Policy.
