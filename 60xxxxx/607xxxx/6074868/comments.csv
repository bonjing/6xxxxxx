,nitrogun,2010-12-31T20:20Z,"Each time I look at comments you are annoyed. Can't blame you though. 
Happy New Year, and thanks for all your time spent. I watched Adam yesterday, quite enjoyable, in spite of there being no car chases, explosions or shooting involved....
Keep well my friend"

,azrielle,2010-12-31T23:46Z,"This is a horrible movie!  The video quality and audio is, as usual, superb, but the plot STINKS!  It is more depressing than Sheri S. Tepper's novel The Gate To Women's Countryl--and that is saying something.

,bigbandbilly,2011-01-01T07:20Z,Thank You
,bigbandbilly,2011-01-01T07:25Z,I mean thank you for the up load . I am truly sorry for others whom don't yet understand how you work'
,bigbandbilly,2011-01-01T07:37Z,I mean thank you for the up load . Also I am sorry for the ones that don't understand how you work. They complain too much without understanding what you go through.I also don't understand 100%.But I do appreciate . I Would not want to do what you do. I imagine it's very time consuming .
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-01T16:35Z,Big Thanks to all of you.
,azrielle,2011-01-02T03:34Z,"To be fair, though, I downloaded it and watched it because of Keira Knightley alone, and didn't read the ""Sci-Fi/Thriller"" part until later.  I will try not to make the same mistake in future, twentyforty.  I seeded it for about 20 hours, then deleted it--too depressing for the limited space on my hard drives."
