A freak storm left our posse of social outcasts with super powers; Curtis
can turn back time, Kelly can read minds, Simon can turn invisible and
Alisha can send people into a sexual frenzy with just one touch.
Then theres their two dead probation workers (one is buried under the
local environmental monitoring station; the other stored in a freezer
in the community centre). And finally, unbeknownst to the others,
Nathan is trapped six feet under in a coffin, immortal and very much alive.

But its not just the ASBO Five who were affected by the storm. With the
super-charged local townsfolk going the way of Gotham City, this series
sees our gang faced with a whole new world of weird and wild characters.
And who is the masked, hooded stranger who seems to be watching their every move?
