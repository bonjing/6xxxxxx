                          FAMILY GUY ITS A TRAP


In this spectacular and offensively uproarious final chapter,

Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia must travel to Tatooine to free Han Solo

by infiltrating the wretched stronghold of Jabba the Hutt , the galaxy's 

most loathsome and dreadful gangster. Reunited, the Rebels team up with a

tribe of Ewoks to combat the Imperial forces on the forest moon of Endor.

Meanwhile the Emperor and Darth Vader conspire to turn Luke to the dark

side, and young Skywalker is determined to rekindle the spirit of the

Jedi within his father. The Galactic Civil War has never been more 

outrageous, as the Rebel forces gather to attack the seemingly

defenseless and incomplete second Death Star in the battle that will

determine the fate of the galaxy.
