A/10
V/10
Plot: Takes a look at gay and straight love among the new millennials. Everything from secret crushes to homophobic attitudes are revealed by the rambunctious students taking Drama and Dance from Loris. None of the teens are what they seem at first glance, with gay hearts lurking behind tough exteriors and straight kids expressing themselves in very queer ways.
Decent movie too...
Many Thanx to TvTeam and TASTE for the Great rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:)"
