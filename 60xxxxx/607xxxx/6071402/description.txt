"When you deal with me, Claire, think icon."

Pat is the glamorous face of an American soap opera; Margaret, a waitress in a motorway cafe in Lancashire. Sisters who've not seen each other for 27 years. Brought together in the glare of a popular TV show, they have no choice but to seem thrilled. But a darker past lies behind their reunion.
