,redvanilla,2010-12-31T18:08Z,"@twentyforty: Greetings and best wishes for you and your loved ones! I hope life begins to treat you better then it seems to have in the last years.
As always: Thank you for your dedication, for keeping up the hard work, in spite of all the nerve-killing people and thanks for sharing your knowledge - it makes a ( positive ) difference!

Best wishes, redvanilla"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-31T19:08Z,"@redvanilla: I wish you all the best, be healthy and wealthy in years to come.

@all: Seeding started again. 

Be fair to others. I have the file already, right?
So, you don't screw me up - but you screw ALL other people up -  who find just dead torrents even if they're two days old.

Ever stumbled on dead torrent before? Hundredths of times, I bet.

Seed just a little. Give back. Share the bytes I gave. As long as you can - hour, two, a day, a week. Sharing is caring.

DO NOT Hit&Run. Do not. Do not invent excuses. Do not.

Do not  be like that.

Just look around yourself. Is the world good place right now? I doubt. Are you surrounded with caring, good people only? I doubt that too, unless you are blind.

Are all people equal?

Be better than Others, do not make their rules valid.

Happier and better 2011 wish you 20-40."
,jon4fun,2010-12-31T19:12Z,"Happy New Year 20-40.

@ ALL H&R that ruin it for everyone - FUCK OFF AND DIE you miserable shits!

@ 20-40 - Your the one thing that can be depended upon, H&R shits break the rules and everyone looses out. I, personally, think your solution is the only possible solution.
Thanks for keeping us on the straight and narrow.

@ ALL true 20-40 fans (that means you seed) Happy new year.

Cheers
Jon"

,tylr,2010-12-31T19:13Z,920p ? a new frontier this year?!
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-31T19:36Z,"Look up.
""(resolution loosely in 1080p category)""

FYI, in Europe we have 1440x1080 as counterpart to NTSC 1920x1080 (USA, Japan) but video is - anamorphic what make thing even more complicated, especially in terms of obeying the rules regarding ""p"" categories.."

,karen219,2011-06-06T00:53Z,"There's no rules about ""hit and run"" stated on the site. Infact downloading this way is illegal in most of the world, do you think people that illegally download really care following rules set by you guys?! 

I'm not saying no one should seed etc etc. We need seeders. I'm just saying.. I don't always seed."
,raoul63,2011-06-14T16:17Z,"Great quality yet only stereo audio (AAC), not 5.1.  Not a problem, I'm just putting more info here."
