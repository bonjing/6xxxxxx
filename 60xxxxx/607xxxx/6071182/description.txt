The Yoga Adventure for Children is an illustrated manual for teachers at primary 
schools and yoga teachers who wish to create children's classes. Featuring 80 
drawings of poses, the book playfully acquaints children with yoga stretches and 
postures and the philosophy behind the practice. Blending yoga, play, dance, music, 
drama, and drawing, the book requires very little preparation before use. Parents too 
can share The Yoga Adventure for Children with their child at home. Practicing yoga 
together offers an opportunity to both parents and the child to laugh, play, and have 
fun together. Many yoga positions are inspired by animals and stimulate suppleness and strength, 
and all aspects of yoga are included in the games: relaxation, breathing, concentration, 
meditation, self-awareness, and visualization. Concepts like karma, chakra, and the 
elements are explained and developed without too much confusing detail. The games 
in this book can also be used to increase children's concentration and self-esteem, 
and to stimulate them to express more creativity, imagination, and better social skills.
