[b]Biography[/b]

Moonsorrow is a pagan metal band formed in Helsinki, Finland, in 1995.

The band call their sound "epic heathen metal" and try to distance themselves from the term "viking metal" as much as possible,
as the vast majority of their lyrics do not concern Vikings, since they are Finnish, not Norse.

The group's earliest formation consisted of cousins Ville Sorvali (vocals and bass) and Henri Sorvali (guitar and keyboards; 
also keyboards for Finntroll, Barathrum, and session member of Ensiferum) who released various demos that were much more characteristic of melodic black metal than future releases.

Their debut album, Suden Uni, recorded in early 2000, was released in 2001, along with TÃ¤mÃ¤ Ikuinen Talvi ("This Everlasting Winter"), a re-release of a 1999 demo. 
Suden Uni ("A Wolf's Dream") combined Finnish paganism and folk elements.[citation needed] After recruiting Mitja Harvilahti and Markus EurÃ©n, Moonsorrow started playing live, releasing Voimasta Ja Kunniasta ("Of Strength and Honour") in late 2001. 
However, the real takeoff for the band is generally held to be[weasel words] their 2003 release, Kivenkantaja ("Stonebearer"). 

In 2005 the band followed it up with their fourth full-length album, VerisÃ¤keet ("Blood Verses"). 
The album was also their first to use ambient sounds such as birdsong and crackling fire in between tracks.

In January 2006 the band played their first US show at the Heathen Crusade Metalfest in Columbia Heights, MN. On March 7, 2006, Moonsorrow announced a 2-album contract with Spinefarm Records, and that their next album was slated for release in late 2006. 
On June 19 it was revealed that the upcoming album would feature guest vocals by Thomas VÃ¤Ã¤nÃ¤nen, the former vocalist of Thyrfing; Viides Luku - HÃ¤vitetty ("Chapter five - Ravaged") was released in January 2007. 
The album contained only two tracks and displayed more overts influence from progressive rock

An EP called Tulimyrsky was released in 2008. 
The EP is over one hour long and contains one new song (the title track), two remakes of old songs, and two cover songs. 
It was released worldwide by Spinefarm Records, and in May the German label Drakkar Entertainment released it in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

In Fall 2010, Moonsorrow entered the studio to record their sixth full-length studio album, with a tentative release date in February 2011.
