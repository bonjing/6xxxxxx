,LittleFang,2010-12-30T15:18Z,"Hi 2040.. it doesn't say not to request, so am going to ask you for something, but please forgive me if the timing is wrong!

I have been searching for 'A Christmas Tale' (2008) - the French movie starring Catherine Deneuve for years now (it would need English subtitles, obviously). But all the files I can find are massive.. except for one. But that one is still big  - 1.4GB - and also a .rar file, which I've had very bad luck with in the past. 

I don't know if you have access to this movie, of course. But if you do, I would be extremely grateful if you could work your 2040 magic and upload it! Apparently, it's meant to be a great film.

Anyway, thank you for listening - and thanks again for all your amazing work on this site. You're a uniquely brilliant uploader and like many others, I'm very grateful for everything you do."

@LittleFang: I have BluRay,so you can choose between 500 or 700 MB. I don't rip BluRay to 272p anymore (only as pair to bigger release) - so, say: is it OK?"
