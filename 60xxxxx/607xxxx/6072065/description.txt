Dan Snow blows the lid on the traditional Anglo-centric view of history and reveals how the Irish saved Britain from cultural oblivion during the Dark Ages of 400-800AD.


1) A New Civilisation
He examines the demise of civilisation in Britain after the collapse of the Roman Empire and looks at how Ireland became the cradle of a new European civilisation.

2) Salvation
He follows in the footsteps of Ireland's earliest missionaries as they venture through treacherous barbarian territory to bring literacy and technology to the future nations of Scotland and England.
