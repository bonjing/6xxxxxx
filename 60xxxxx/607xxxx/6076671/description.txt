Set  in  the richly detailed Mage Knight universe, players take on the
role  of one of five guardians, warriors sworn by oath to seek out the
heart  of  evil plaguing the land and stop it no matter what the cost.
Guided  by  the magical and mysterious race known as the Solonavi, the
guardians  embark  on  an  epic journey to rescue their world from the
hands  of  an  army  of  pure  evil  determined  to  bring  about  the
Apocalypse.  As  the  forces of Chaos rise, a creature of unimaginable
strength  and  destructive  power  is  born  to  lead  the  enemy: the
Apocalypse  Dragon,  a  seemingly unstoppable five headed monstrosity.
In  order  to  face  this threat players cannot go it alone, they must
rally  support  from all of the factions of the land and recruit brave
heroes  to fight for their cause. The future rests on the shoulders of
these  noble  adventurers,  and the battle to end all battles is about
to begin.
