[T],Totenkruez,2011-05-31T07:29Z,"The files should be fine. I've extracted and tested them on 32-bit Win XP. Before extracting the files, make sure your download has finished. Some torrent clients don't mark incomplete files, making you think it's ready when it's not.

If you don't know how to open .001 files, right-click it and select ""Open With..."". Then choose something like WinRAR or 7-Zip. It should extract fine."
