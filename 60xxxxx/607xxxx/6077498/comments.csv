-----------------Need Some Help-------------------
I have an AVI file with dual audio. I want to remove one audio from it. What software should use. 
Tried to google but didnt find anything useful.

@frapper and prashant
You suggested to use MKVmerge, thanks for it but it convert the format to MKV.
Yes, we can change the output format but one problem always persist.
When i play the file in K-Lite, there is no audio, in both format. But works in vlc.
