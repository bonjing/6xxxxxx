This film a talks about the truth that the name of the Prophet peace be upon him his name (Muhammad) in the Torah, or what is called the Old Testament, and which denies the people of the book all of us this truth, but the his name, peace be upon him clear in reading, both voice or draw the Hebrew letters. 
 Please, be deducted from your time 18 minutes and 31 seconds to see the film and look at the obvious fact, and I think it would be minutes of light that show you the way to the correct way to worship God alone.
