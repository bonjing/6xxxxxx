But the flac part makes it uninteresting for a lot of people to download it.

FLAC is a nice file format, but it isnt really easy going for WMP etc. I recon.

Anyhoo, DL'ed it and will seed for a few weeks!

Thanks :D!"
,jhuesos,2011-05-15T00:53Z,"Thanks for the comments. You are right. Next time I will put in the name FLAC/Loseless.

And I've already had the other album. Maybe I will upload it.

Cheers"
,rjamesbe,2011-06-01T11:09Z,Don't listen to the flac haters.. People who appreciate not only the sound but also the quality do like to listen to loss-less music. Besides that you can easily convert flac to mp3.. So thanks for uploading in the best possible quality!

Then you can use VLC or a better player than WMP... (that sucks)... OR, you can download and then reencode to ex mp3 320kbps (or lower)...

jhuesos: Tnx for a GREAT upload... don't stopp uploading Flac... *HUG*"
,Mendelson,2011-09-26T21:06Z,FLAC is the only way to go. MP3 just won't do it. Thanks for uploading this in FLAC :)
