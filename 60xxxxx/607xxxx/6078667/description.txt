Hello rjordan21 
This is your comment on ACDC - Ultimate Paper Sleeve Collection (19 CDs Bot) 

This sounds fantastic. Thanks again Webchella. A word of caution though. This ISO file contains unlabeled folders and files of FLA files. I had to manually change the ext to FLAC for them to play AND rename everything as well. I used the free version of Power ISO to extract the ISO file so maybe that had something to do with it. If anyone else has had a different result with this torrent I'd love to know what you did. In the end the BEST sounding discography on cd I've heard. THANKS AGAIN!

Can't you upload ACDC - Ultimate Paper Sleeve Collection (19 CDs Bot) with the remaned files already in the Flac version? I have download it and it would save me a lot of trouble to change to Flac and rename it... Cheers mate.

I added Black Ice to complete the Discography.
