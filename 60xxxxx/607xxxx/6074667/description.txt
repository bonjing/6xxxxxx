My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Episodes 1-10. All video files are .flv converted to .mp4 format to minimize file size while maintaining great quality. Also included are a few songs and a .txt file to help you find other fans.	


Future torrents with more episodes could include .mkv, but I need to some clear evidence as to the difference in quality in the form of pictures, etc, so I can justify the larger filesize. I myself have compared screencaps from the .flv and the .mp4 and it fools flood detection software, so I'm skeptical but not set on the current file type. I just need evidence to change it.
