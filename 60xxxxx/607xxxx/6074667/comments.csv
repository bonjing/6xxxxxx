the only difference between the three is that mkv can also incorporate soft subtitles, multiple audio tracks, and i think a couple other things. since you aren't using any of that it doesn't matter.

although since you are only concerned about file size, mkv will be the same file size if the same settings and codec are used, and personally i prefer to have .mkv files (i'm sure most others are this way) but it's up to you really.

also i'd like to thank you a lot for this torrent, this show is amazing."

,Doc Lithius,2011-01-29T03:06Z,"Just so everyone knows:
Video Codec: avc1 (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC)
Audio Codec: mp4a (MPEG-4 AAC LC) @ 48000Hz  160 kb/s tot, stereo

This is according to to the GSpot codec information appliance.  That aside, the audio and video quality are both quite good!  It's a 16:9 ratio and there aren't any noticable video fuzzies or jags, so I'm pretty darn satisfied myself.  Thanks, chemical_art!  The bonus goodies are pretty cool, too."
