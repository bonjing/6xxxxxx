,Dr.BIG47,2011-01-05T06:59Z,"If you use Bit-torrent have a look at this video on youtube:

How to create a torrent in Bit-torrent

To upload a torrent you have to have an account on thepiratebay.org. 
After you make a torrent go to your profile and look for (Upload torrent) then click on it. After you click on (Upload torrent) browse for your torrent, give it a name, give a category, give it a tag or two, give it an Image tag, and last but not least give it a Description. Most of these chooses are not needed. 

Sorry for the misspelled words if any."
