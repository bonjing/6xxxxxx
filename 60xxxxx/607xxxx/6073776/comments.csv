,Ozzy_fan,2011-01-18T01:29Z,"Hey FXG_TEAM, 
I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan
