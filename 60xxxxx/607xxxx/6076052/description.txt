this is version 3.1 of the linux distribution designed for the blind and visually impaired. included are the 32 and 64 bit versions of live cd, usb install and dvd install images. I am posting these files as part of a single torrent to make it easier to distribute to as many users as possible.

I previously also posted version 3.0 for the same reason.I also happen to be blind and use an LTS version on my G3 powerbook portable computer. This version fixes some issues that occurred in 3.0 and has broader support for more modern hardware.

I request that all persons that have all of these files please also seed to speed distribution of this OS to as many blind users as possible.
