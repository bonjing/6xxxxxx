"Lucky One" is a 1994 single by Christian music singer Amy Grant. It was released as the first single from the House of Love album in the United Kingdom and the second single from the album in the United States. After the moderate success of Grant's previous single, "House of Love," which made the Top Three of the Adult Contemporary chart and the Top Forty of the Billboard Hot 100, "Lucky One" was chosen as the next single. It performed slightly better on the Billboard charts than its predecessor, reaching #5 on the AC chart and #18 on the Hot 100, and is currently Grant's last single to reach the Top Twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 (two singles have since missed the top twenty by only a few spots, one in 1997 and one in 2003). However, "Lucky One" took the #1 spot on the Radio & Records Mainstream Adult Contemporary chart, and #12 on the CHR/Pop Tracks chart.

House of Love was Amy's follow-up to her quintuple-platinum it 1991 release Heart in Motion. Although House of Love sold less than half of what its predecessor sold, it similarly combines pop music with Christian values. "Lucky One" was the album's biggest hit at #18 Pop and #2 Adult Contemporary in the U.S.A., followed by the title song and a remake of Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi." "Say You'll Be Mine" also was a UK Top 50 hit.

Some of the album's other tracks garnered more notice later on when covered by other artists. "The Power" (written by Tommy Sims and Judson Spence) is featured on Cher's 1998 album Believe, and Vanessa L. Williams had an AC hit in 1997 with her cover of "Oh How The Years Go By."

In 2007, House of Love was reissued and digitally remastered by Grant's new record label, EMI/Sparrow Records. The remastered edition is labeled with a "Digitally Remastered" logo in the 'gutter' on the CD front.

    * Copies of this album sold in Europe and Australia feature the additional track "Politics of Kissing."
    * When it was released in 1994, House of Love was the biggest initial release in Christian music history, shipping almost a half million copies on its first day alone.

Grant has won six Grammy Awards, 25 Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, and had the first Christian album ever to go Platinum. Heart in Motion is her highest selling album, with over five million copies sold in the United States alone. She was honored with a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2005 for her contributions to the entertainment industry.
