Isobel Campbell & Mark Lanegan - Live At The Barbican (2010)






Isobel Campbell (born on 27 April 1976 in Glasgow) is a Scottish singer, cellist and composer in the indie and rock genres.




Collaboration with Mark Lanegan

Isobel toured with Mark Lanegan in 2007 in support of their album Ballad of the Broken Seas.

In April 2004, Campell released an EP with former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan, titled Time Is Just the Same. They would later release a single entitled "Ramblin' Man" for their collaboration album Ballad of the Broken Seas. Campbell wrote and recorded the majority of the album's tracks in Glasgow, with Lanegan adding vocals in Los Angeles. The album was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. Lanegan and Campbell played four UK concerts in January 2007, with the London date being moved to a larger venue as a result of high demand for tickets.

In 2007, the duo recorded a second album together, entitled Sunday at Devil Dirt, which was released on 5 May 2008. Three singles from the album have been released so far: "Who Built the Road"(7'), "Come On Over (Turn Me On)" (7') and "Keep me in mind sweetheart"(Cd, 12'). The five new tracks of the "Keep me in mind sweetheart" EP were later added as bonus tracks to Sunday at Devil Dirt.

A third collaborative album with Lanegan was released on August 16, 2010 entitled Hawk. The pair will tour to promote the album, including a set at All Tomorrow's Parties, 10â€“12 December 2010 (Bowlie 2) curated by Belle & Sebastian.
