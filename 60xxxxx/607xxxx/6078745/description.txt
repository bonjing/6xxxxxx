Life on Mars tells the fictional story of Sam Tyler (John Simm), a police officer in service with the Greater Manchester Police. After being hit by a car in 2006, Tyler awakes in 1973 and finds himself working for the predecessor of the GMP, the Manchester and Salford Police at the same station and location as in 2006. Early on in the series, it becomes apparent to Tyler that he awakes as a Detective Inspector, one rank lower than his 2006 rank of Detective Chief Inspector. As part of the Criminal Investigation Department, Tyler finds himself working under the command of Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister).
Throughout the two series, the central plot centres on the ambiguity concerning Tyler's predicament of it being unclear to both the audience and the character whether he has died, gone mad, is in a coma or has actually travelled back in time. However, the final episode of the spin-off series Ashes to Ashes, aired 21 May 2010, revealed that the Life on Mars/Ashes to Ashes world is purgatory for dead and dying police officers. It is explained to be an overlapping parallel world where the police officers go to accept their fates before moving on to the afterlife. This explains why some of Tyler's actions in 1973 have a direct effect on the future.
