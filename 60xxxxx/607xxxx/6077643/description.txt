         Oklahoma is making its fourth appearance in a BCS bowl        
         game over last five years, and the Sooners are 1-3 in         
         four previous Fiesta Bowl appearances; Connecticut won        
         five straight games to claim the Big East championship        
          and qualify for first-ever BCS bowl game.
