,Tsuris,2011-01-28T11:50Z,"Had some small problems getting the right settings for .avi xvid, note for ev1, De-interlacing and High Quality engine don't play nice (and De-interlacing is the only way I got it to make a ""non streaking"" image....so nix the engine...use de-interlace), it adds a rainbow type band to the bottom.  That having been said extreme kudos to deephole, had a program that ran fine on xp, it had serious trouble on 7...thanks :)"
