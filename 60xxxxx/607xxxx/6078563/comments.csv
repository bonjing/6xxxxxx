Nice movie!"
,zekeisaszekedoes,2011-08-18T00:12Z,"Nicely done, excellent quality for the size of rip and age of film.  It's a classic... modern directors should take note of how two actors and a few simple camera shots (the Starling/Lecter confrontations) can be more powerful and enthralling than all the CGI shots you can cram into a 21st century movie."
