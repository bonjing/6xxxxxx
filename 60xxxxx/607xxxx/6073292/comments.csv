,ss9417,2011-02-06T04:28Z,"Note that this will only work on USB loaders that can boot different .DOL files. Step by Step (I use Usb Loader GX):

1.Go to ULGX and load MEtroid Prime Trilogy

2. When promted click Defualt.

3. Make a SAve account.

4. Restart your wii and load ULGX.

5. Instead of clicking Default, click the metroid game you want to play.

6. Enjoy! Note that this will save to the account you made in step 1."

,Devilus,2011-04-07T18:32Z,"Please seed, this is taking forever!"
,crispykiller96,2011-04-10T16:29Z,3.2kbps Nice :-)
,pcty,2011-05-09T23:23Z,"I can't extract the iso! it says that :
    ""Total path and file name length must not exceed 260 characters"""
[T],dramacore,2011-06-04T17:43Z,"to fix a the 260 character limit you could update your OS, or just make the file name shorter, don't extract the folder inside the rar either. just extract the shortened name .iso file to a root area like z:\

,HectorJ13,2011-07-15T23:57Z,Can more people seed this.
,nderyst,2011-08-16T00:44Z,"please seed, around 40 kb/s

:/"
,nderyst,2011-08-18T01:53Z,"thx, don't forget to launch it from a different .DOL file like ss9417 said."
,NicholasNihili,2011-09-14T06:01Z,"@Dramacore

Your advice isn't making much sense to me. I cannot rename the ISO while it is still inside of the .rar and regardless of where I extract to, the error arises.

I'm currently using Windows 7 and have scoured Google for a solution to the problem, but I cannot find one.

Would you please give me a step-by-step instructional guide on how to do this so I can finally enjoy one of my favorite games on the Wii?"
,xCryonic,2011-09-20T06:00Z,"I accidentaly broke my disc a few weeks back, thank you for this torrent!

Altough it's really slow to extract all the parts takes abour 4 hours and 47 minutes to extract all 8 parts.

Thanks anyways!"
,Davidhogan_3,2011-09-20T13:18Z,"Has anyone actually extracted this, and if so how???? I can extract it at all"
,NeonYouki,2011-09-21T02:51Z,6 Hours to extract this archive???  Are you serious?  I have a quad core proc with 4 gigs of DDR3 ram on my machine and it takes 6 hours to extract it.  Why put the isos on the torrent instead of an archive?  It'll take longer to extract it than it did to download it.  You could also add the archive and the contents of the archive to the torrent so people can choose to download the archive or the content.
,NeonYouki,2011-09-21T21:58Z,"OK, yesterday I have a read error at 88% of extraction of this archive and it failed on part 8 after over 5 hours.  I'm redownloading part 8 to see if it was just a download issue.  If not, I'll see if WinRAR can repair it.  When I get it extracted, I'm going to make a proper torrent without the archive and seed it for a few days until enough people have it.  I'll post the link here when I finish it all if I can get it extracted."
,NeonYouki,2011-09-22T20:38Z,"OK, it was just a download issue with part 8, but it still took 6 hours to extract.  After days of work downloading and extracting this archive, here's the torrent with the archive extracted.  This will NOT work on Dolphin Emulator.  Even the work arounds yield 20FPS instead of the 60FPS that the stand alone games yield on the same machine.  (FPS = Frames per sec.)

,bodHbod,2011-10-19T02:59Z,Will this work with Neo Gamma?
,War4more,2011-10-22T20:09Z,Great Game
,113425505,2011-10-29T03:11Z,"i donloaded it and extracted fine

,miguelbolas,2011-10-30T14:04Z,"what is wrong with this torrent?
6 hours to unrar!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,usrmd,2011-11-19T06:01Z,seed please ;)
,Keithuk,2011-12-04T02:35Z,"It took 2 hours to extract the rar.

It plays great in my 4.3E with USB Loader GX.

Cheers webchella."
,searchfin,2011-12-25T23:22Z,"6 hours to extract this? You guys are hilarious. Especially the guy with the ""quad-core."" Took me all of 10 min on low priority to extract this game. Yes, I have a quad-core too. And no its not oc'ed."
,Jacobus21,2012-02-27T18:36Z,Thank you very much.
,wryme,2012-06-27T00:58Z,"Yeah, I don't know what's up with this archive but it's taking much longer than usual to unrar. It's been like 30 minutes and it's not even a quarter way done. Usually an archive of this size would only take a minute."
