NOTE: this requires Mac OS X, Subler, ffmpeg, and a brain.

SUBLER Auto Chapter

        -h : This (help) message
        -v : Display version
        -f : MP4 file to add chapters to
        -w : Do the Subler write and delete chapter file
                (Default: create chapter file only)
        -c : Integer value in minutes to assign chapter markers

-------------------------------------------------

Designed for usage with ffmpeg to determine duration
but could also probably work easily with mediainfo.  To
work with mediainfo you may need to change the matching line
for Duration.

Open script and modify location of ffmpeg and subler as needed.

If you don't have ffmpeg and don't know how to modify it to run
with mediainfo then change line 55 and uncomment:

#open(DURATION, "cat $file |");
and comment
open(DURATION, "$ffmpeg -i \"$file\" 2>&1 |");

and then pass it a file that has the following data line in it

Duration: 02:47:00.00,

Values can change.
