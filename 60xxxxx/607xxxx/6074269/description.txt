      The Countryfile team heads north to experience winter on the
      Hebridean island of North Uist. Matt Baker meets the family who
      are setting up home there after moving six hundred miles from
      Cornwall, and he heads to a ceilidh to learn some traditonal
      Scottish dancing. Meanwhile, Julia Bradbury finds out about the
      extreme weather that hits the island in winter; John Craven
      barters his away through North Uist, swapping some of his local
      produce with some traditonal Hebridean food; and Ellie Harrison
      goes hunting for some of island's most elusive creatures.
