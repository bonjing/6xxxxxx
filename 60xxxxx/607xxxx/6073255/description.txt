St. Philips Choir/Angel Voices/Libera
Song Title: Sing For Ever [TRACK08](1988)
Release Date: 1988
Label: BBC Enterprises Ltd/EMI Music

Sing For Ever is the 8th track on the first album, Sing For Ever, produced in 1988
by the St Philip's Boys Choir.
The period when they were called the St Philip's Boys Choir roughly equates to the
1980s. The change of name to Angel Voices came in 1990, around the time of the 2nd
album release. In 1998 along with a departure from fairly traditional church choir
music, there was the latest change of name to Libera.
