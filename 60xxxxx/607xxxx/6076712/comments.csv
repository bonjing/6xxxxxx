,cojon,2012-01-27T17:55Z,"Thingie; thanks for the many *SAFE* torrents. It is a bit tiresome chasing off the the miscellaneous pieces of malcontent code that attempt to find a home on my machine after hitchhiking about the Internet.  So I find your uploads to be 100% reliable and safe.  Your instructions are first rate, well written and accurate, and I will say that I have never had one fail to install. All I need do is follow the instructions. 

Thanks again, Dr. J.M. Cook  "
