Hi this is a pretty hard to find film I looked for it for ages I requested it herebut no one filled it so I'm filling it myself thanks to TheDarkHour for letting me know where I could find it.

Anyway the film is a Doco with kenny and spenny about 5 years before they made the show kenny vs spenny which I am a fan of. The Doco is about them trying to pitch a script in hollywood.
