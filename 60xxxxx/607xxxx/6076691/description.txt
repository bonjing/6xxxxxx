Players take control of Naughty, a brown bear with a bit of an
attitude. It's shown early on that everyone else on the Island makes
fun of him and really doesn't want him to join in on the fun. Things
take a dark turn when the narrator, who is the perfect stereotype of
those seen in kids TV shows, announces to Naughty that he should do
something about these mean bears. There's something just a bit
disturbing about being talked to like a child and told that guns are
naughty and should be used to "punish" the island's inhabitants.
