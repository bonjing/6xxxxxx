Digital Tutors - Creative Character Exploration - Aliens with Photoshop CS5 

In this series of lessons, we will be focusing on how to quickly generate character ideas based on an initial shape.

Well get started by examining each individual shape to see which character features could be associated with the different areas of the shape. Next well lay a foundation of quick, loose, pencil-like line work, flushing out some of the details of our character. During this phase, we will learn a variety of different ways to draw the features and forms that relate to a alien type characters. From there we will refine our line work with more confident inked lines. Finally well look at a quick method of applying colour in the form of cell shading to our character concepts.
