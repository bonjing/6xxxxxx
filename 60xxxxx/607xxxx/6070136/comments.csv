,davidsask,2010-12-29T09:44Z,This is not a good torrent! It took me most of day to download and upon opening there is NO sound people. I tried VLC as well. I should have known better than to go with this ripper as always has problems! I hope the other ones out there are better and people comment on them.

Great quality and good movie.

V = 9
A = 9
M = 7

I prefer one complete movie though, instead of two seperate 700MB parts, so i just joined them and shrunk them myself and it still has great quality for a single small sized movie :p"

How do you do that? I have a mac what would i use?"
,murrambingi,2011-01-23T17:39Z,"@greensbottom,
I dont know about mac, but you need a video converter (a good one) but i do mine in a secret way using 4 different programs so i can render them alot faster instead of waiting hours i only wait about 40mins-1.5hrs"
,ericv1984,2011-02-04T19:12Z,"@ murrambingi
You use 4 programs and it still takes you that long? I only use 1 program and it takes me about the same amount of time."
,ericv1984,2011-02-04T19:13Z,"@ greensbottom
Google it."
,ericv1984,2011-02-04T19:20Z,"@ greensbottom
