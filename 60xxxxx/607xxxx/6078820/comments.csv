,berket31,2011-02-20T01:59Z,"Thanks for uploading the movie ""In the blink of an eye."" It really made me think of eternity after our life here on earth (or after the rapture). I sincerely hope that you too are Christian and have accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior .. how could you otherwise have uploaded this movie?
I'll think about your financial situation as well ...
Moreover, I hope it's okay if I upload the same movie, but this time with Norwegian text. I have found a way to do it, but I've had problems with the upload .. maybe something wrong with the port on my PC.

For so much God loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life. John's Gospel, Chapter 3, verse 16 (from the Norwegian Study Bible)
Could wish I spoke your language, but I know a little English *
* google translator is a kinda good tool XD"
