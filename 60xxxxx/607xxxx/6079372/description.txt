He is a multi-talented musician, DJ and producer, a vegan who doesn't drink or take drugs and a Christian with a degree in philosophy. His name is Richard Melville Hall but to most of us he is simply known as Moby. And even if you think you're not familiar with his music, since every track of his 1999 album Play was licensed for commercial use, the chances are you'll be humming along in no time. 

This comprehensive documentary traces Moby's life from his childhood in affluent New England and teenage years in punk bands right through to his beginnings as a techno pioneer in New York and subsequent global stardom. With unprecedented access to all aspects of his life, the programme includes excerpts from personal home movies (including a rare sighting of Moby with long hair), interviews with relatives, close friends and contemporaries. 

Combining intimate scenes from his Hotel world tour with on-stage performances, Moby talks frankly about his upbringing, influences and beliefs as well as the music which has shaped his life.
