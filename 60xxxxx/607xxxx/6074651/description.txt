Hitting the airwaves in 1965, this family-friendly TV series was set three decades ahead -- and in space. In 1997, John Robinson (Guy Williams), his wife (June Lockhart), the couple's children, and Maj. Don West (Mark Goddard) are sent to start a space colony that will relieve an overpopulated Earth. But a stowaway agent for an enemy government sabotages the mission, sending the ship off course and leaving the crew fighting to survive and get home.
