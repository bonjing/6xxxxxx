A.C. Gilbert figures out a way to keep Christmas alive after the war threatens to take it away in his name. 

The Man Who Saved Christmas is a heartwarming drama based on the life of innovative inventor and toy maker A.C. Gilbert (Jason Alexander, The Grand, Seinfeld), a man with a belief that playing helps children learn, imagine, and dream. With the support of his loving wife, Mary (Kelly Rowan, The O.C.), A.C. and his brother Frank run a successful toy factory. But when WWI breaks out, A.C. is under pressure to let the U.S. Government turn the factory into a munitions plant. With some help from his son and a little holiday magic, A.C. rediscovers his holiday spirit and convinces the U.C. Congress that what America really needs is a little Christmas joy.
