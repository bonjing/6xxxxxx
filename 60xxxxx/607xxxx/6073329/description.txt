Synopsis: 
Suffering from acute kidney failure, Uncle Boonmee has retreated to the countryside accompanied by a couple of relatives and his Laotian care-giver. At dinner one night, during the course of ordinary conversation, the ghost of his dead wife appears and his long-lost son returns home as a monkey spirit. Surprised at first, Boonmee welcomes and absorbs their presence during his last days, 
trekking with his family to a mysterious hilltop cave - the birthplace of his first life.
