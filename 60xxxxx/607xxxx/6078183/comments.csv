,rene1881,2011-01-23T16:14Z,:-( does'nt work for r4 with moonsell tried many of your nds games without luck - can y fix it or give me some help
,Ahoy-me-matey,2011-03-04T02:56Z,"Hello Simmyboy. Your DS Games almost ALL work on our R4's when they have the current firmware loaded. (R4i V1.33b & R4i SDHC RTS V3.2) 
Thanks heaps for all your work - I know your downloads are always virus free - there is no way we could ever afford to buy more than a few games at the price they charge. If games were cheaper I'd do the right thing and buy them.

Rene1881 - Provide more info about what R4 card and what version software you have on it and do any games work at all and what error you get etc?"

Thanks."
