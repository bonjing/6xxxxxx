By Christopher Porter

Pianist Anders Aarum, bassist Mats Eilertsen and drummer Thomas Stronen (him
again) create a beautiful quiet storm on Absence in Mind (Jazzaway). Don't start
thinking this is an Anita Baker record: The music is soft but intense, like a
gentle shower that precludes an outright storm-but the trio never gives in to
thunder. The title Absence in Mind should give you an idea of what this band is
about. (Hint: Think of a crusty jazz bromide.)

"Viveza Criolla" has strange buzzing sounds from the bass, which sounds like
paper is jammed under the strings. "Avanti No. 1" starts as a quirky meditation
before falling off the shelf. But my favorite tracks are "Donkey Shot," "Around
the Kernal," "Mon Cherry" and "Day-dream," which have more a Brad Mehldau/Keith
Jarrett/Tord Gustavsen feel and demonstrate why Aarum and his group are ones to
watch.
