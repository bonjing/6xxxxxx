,Phatfish,2011-01-06T01:00Z,"A/V - Good

M - I haven't read the book but after seeing the movie I can imagine that it could be a great book.
However it doesn't work at all as a film. Although it wasn't totally terrible, it was pretty pretentious and had lots of strange pauses in between almost every dialog and scene that  didn't make any sense at all and made it painfully slow to watch. "
