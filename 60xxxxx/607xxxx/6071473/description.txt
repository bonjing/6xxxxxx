   Based on a short story by Aleksandr Grin, (the 'Russian Poe'),      
   Morgiana is the story of twin sisters, Klara and Viktoria who live  
   a life of decadent opulence, somewhere in the late 19th century.    
   Klara is auburn-haired and beautiful, whilst Viktoria is wicked,    
   sadistic, bursting with hate and jealousy - and who hatches a       
   terrible revenge by slowly poisoning her more popular sister. As    
   the poison takes hold, Klara begins to lose grip on her sanity...
