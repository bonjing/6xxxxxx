"Man's Greatest Achievement." This was the entirety of the note we wrote down in the official RiffTrax screening room log book for Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny.  

If "Man's Greatest Achievement" doesn't do it for you, then perhaps the actual tagline from the Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny movie poster will: "What a Story!"

You will have to ignore, of course, that Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny barely contains a story, let alone a coherent thought.  But you'll be willing to let this pass, since it does contain pigs, gorilla suits, paper mache birds, soiled Santa costumes, child endangerment and, of course, an Ice Cream Bunny.

What is an Ice Cream Bunny?  We're not quite sure, and the movie doesn't really bother to explain.  Evidently he has a fire truck with an air raid siren, and lives at a place called Pirates World.  We also know that we are strongly in favor of ceding all power to it and letting it enact whatever foul agenda it desires, just as long as it lets us take a ride through Pirates World in that sweet, sweet fire truck.

It's one of the strangest and most baffling pieces of outsider art that Mike, Kevin and Bill have ever riffed, and we were only 65% kidding about that "Man's Greatest Achievement" thing.  Please join us in experiencing: Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny.
