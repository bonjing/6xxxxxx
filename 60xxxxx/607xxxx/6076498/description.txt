Formerly a space rock/shoegazer band, Bowery Electric have headed steadily towards a highly atmospheric trip-hop style culminating with this album called Lushlife. While not as exquisite as Beat and, for some, apparently quite run-of-the-mill (except the single Freedom Fighter, the only song with guitar), Lushlife has the rare quality of being solid on almost all of the songs. Best listened to while driving around the city late at night.
