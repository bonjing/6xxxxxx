When I opened this in VLC,  it states it is ""Tiesto: Club Life 196 [#1]"".  I was puzzled as to what happened to #2,  like you usually share.  
So,  I checked the file size and realized you no longer split them.  I prefer this,  as I am always playing #2 before #1 in the playlist and it really irks me.
Thank you again for the great quality and awesome torrent.  I will certainly seed till I'm @ 4:1.  Peace."
