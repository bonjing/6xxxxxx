,Jimstalk,2011-01-02T02:19Z,"Airbus X is one of the most realistic payware addons ever made for FSX.I dont know what the fuck is wrong with you but im absolutely sure that you re one of these guys who spend their whole day in front of a screen.At least read your posts.You just said that airbus x is crap??!!Im afraid that your brain cannot cooperate with your fingers


THINK BEFORE TYPING YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!

,vittupaa1980,2011-01-04T09:55Z,Does this plane need joystick to fly or can i fly whit this whit mouse and keyboard
,lorum,2011-01-04T14:06Z,"vittupaa198

No you have to use car steering.

Of course you can use the mouse and keyboard "
,Espana25,2011-01-04T18:45Z,"@Jimstalk ,Well thanks for the instructions provided buddy....but i am so sorry i don't have a hardware throttle such as a joystick or some other i want to make it work with the keyboard assignments is there a way for that ,i would really appreciate some help in this thanks."
,straks,2011-01-05T23:32Z,Yea its realese version bcuz it has the spoilers bug so 1.0? same that was there around august but thx anyway ;) beside the addon bugs it works perfect ;)
,Espana25,2011-01-06T02:08Z,the only thing that i dont like about this addon is that it doesn't go with the simplicity to the date i remember there hasn't been an aircraft addon for FSX or FS9 that didn't actually had a control associated with the keyboard function.
,spyboter,2011-01-06T23:25Z,"Hi
Thats an Add-on i`ve been waiting to be uploaded for some time, but now I`m facing a little bit of trubble with it.

Can anyone help me to solve this problem?
Thanks already"
,smith231,2011-01-07T22:21Z,anybody got the 1.22 update? this is definitely below ver. 1.22 (i think also below 1.20)!! any help getting the update will be appreciated!
,olufsen01,2011-01-09T09:04Z,The throtle on the asirbus is not like all the another jets. So read the manual :)
,olufsen01,2011-01-09T14:11Z,"but the plane any way is garbage!!!

,Cruzu,2011-01-09T18:22Z,"YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S VERY SIMPLE!"
,Beowulf1211,2011-01-11T10:33Z,"this is the ONLY version that works! follow the instructions carefully.
If your having problems understanding the VC autopilot, read the following.
Left-click mouse- activate button
right-click mouse- de-activate
mouse WHEEL- turn the dial!!
thats it!"
,Beowulf1211,2011-01-11T21:26Z,"sorry...wrong thread.
