     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      On 2 January 1971, 66 people died while leaving the ground
      after the traditional New Year Old Firm Derby. This came to be
      known as the Ibrox Disaster. This documentary movingly tells the
      story of the terrible event from the perspective of survivors,
      bereaved families, rescue workers and players who took part in
      the game. First shown in 2001 to mark the 30th anniversary of
      the tragedy.
