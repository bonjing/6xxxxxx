,citizendonny,2011-01-02T18:52Z,"rambam, we could be waiting a long time for volumes 2 and 3. this was posted on the link you said in your last comment. As documented in the first volume, Twain indicated that his wish was for the second volume to be published 25 years after the first, in 2035, and the third and final volume to be published 25 years after that, in 2060."
