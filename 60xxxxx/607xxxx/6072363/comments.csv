I don't know of any Malware, but it's pissing me off that this torrent has been singled out from Demonoid and has been deleted. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS FUCKING TORRENT !!! So you can shove your infections up your ass, and Demonoid site bots, DIE! I spent 2 whole days collecting all of these and I am so happy to have them.. it's been an epic torrent for sure, so people who just want to take a dump on something they can't take any credit for are moving in to try and ruin a good.. no, a GREAT thing.. fuck off Nazi scum! About 1000 people have my torrent and love it and that is just under a weeks time. You're just jealous it wasn't you who found it! There are all kinds of tools to tweak your Windows 7 set-up.. and just like a keygen throws false positives up I bet so did this, because this is the biggest collection of themes and the tools to make some of the themes that there is!"

,dielaughing,2011-01-14T02:12Z,I really hate it when someone finds something of pure awesomeness and tries to shit on it.. loser.

Fuck you are awesome man!!! thanks a ton!!!"
,navaneet,2011-01-23T07:58Z,"I know everybody's praising you for this torrent. But I am very disappointed with this torrent. You just can't click the theme and go directly to what it looks like in the photo. You have to click other things separately like there is some gadgets(separately), Sounds(separately), Designs and almost everything except the wallpaper is separate-separate files that you have to install in your system. Which I think will mess up your system only.

For me, I'm Very Disappointed with this torrent !"
,MrGRiM01,2011-01-30T15:32Z,"All these themes are from my site and you do not have permission from the artists or me to post them here, all you have to do is register free at vitualcustoms.net and you can download any of these theme with full support from the artists and myself, there is no reason to be downloading a torrent from this guy who for all you know has added any sort of malicious content.

There is however one of my paid premium themes in this Pack called Toxic and I have it along with 2 other themes in my shop to help pay for the site so we can keep it going and keep bringing you more great themes from our talented community, so you are directly hurting our community by downloading this torrent.

Dielaughing, you are a scum bag son of a bitch thieving little bastard and I hope you rote in Hell you little fucking cunt."
,MrGRiM01,2011-01-30T15:53Z,"You have been reported asshole, I hope they ban you as well."
,MrGRiM01,2011-01-30T17:16Z,"You have been banned from Virtual Customs now too dielaughing, so good luck downloading any of my great new themes in the future cock sucker.

,MrGRiM01,2011-01-31T05:04Z,"Yeah register at my site virtualcustoms.net and get support from the artist, why are you asking this idiot who just stole a bunch of our themes, do you really think he can help any of you with your problems."
,copyrightscopier,2011-02-01T14:23Z,Just awesome!! Thanks a Ton man!!
,hroth,2011-02-15T04:03Z,Thanks a lot!  I've been looking for a good collection like this for a while.

,gile_82,2011-03-13T09:44Z,"how to instal this? can help anyone?
win7 32-bit system."
,dielaughing,2011-03-13T11:36Z,"Yep! I did steal these themes.. they didn't cost money and are not copyrighted, totally free to download (I just bunched em all up into one pretty little package) and so I did just that. I found one hell of an awesome pile of custom stuffs that Windows was just too pink to create on their own, and I am sorry I stepped on your toes dood, but ask me if I really care?! And that was my old PC, my newest one cost 4 times that one, which I just sold to a guy on the other site of the island.. you're a cleaver bastard, finding my ex girlfriends name and all.. but really though, do you just want to come over and make hot monkey love to my fist in your face 'cause you're not impressing me with all that piss talk. Ya, you made awesome shit. I took it. Get over it. If any of the downloaders want support, I told you point blank where to go get all the geek support you could ever want.. become one of them for all I care. Torrents are a beautiful thing.. you can't put a leash on them, and they flow, beautifully, like water.. so drink up and smile :D (and like I can't figure out a back door to your silly little club.. right! not even Demonoid could block me forever.. it's called http://www.hide-my-ip.com/"
,dielaughing,2011-03-13T11:50Z,"MrGRiM01, Fat lotta good you've done for TPB community.. not even one torrent.. you just stay one your side of the geeks squad and I'll stay on my little pacific island.. MrGRiM01 Report away.. suck a black mans embalmed penis and eat it too."
,tacklebox666,2011-03-13T11:57Z,why you people bad mouth torrents when the yare good are you jealous or just stupid. stupid people shouldnt own computers lol
,x_PseudoAnonymous,2011-03-15T14:51Z,"in order to install, download universalthemepatcher and patch the required files (which will differ depending on your operating system). once this is done, reboot the machine and begin a) placing themes manually into c://windows/resources/themes or b) automatically install the ones that contain a .exe installer.

,jakeerwil,2011-05-04T07:38Z,how to install this themes any instructions how to install this great themes.....
,dielaughing,2011-05-17T01:06Z,"it's totally easy, just dump the contents of every zipped package of files/folders into the directory c://windows/resources/themes and yer good.. but B4 doing that you need the 'Universal Theme Patcher', and I'm pretty sure I've included it in the torrent. Just use it, it's self explanatory. It's a little tedious unzipping all 107 themes, but man is it worth it. The creators on over at 'www.VirtualCustoms.com' are artistic geniuses! They may hate me for sharing these on here, but they were all free and are not copyrighted, so we're all good to go. I recently did a little project which is taking all of the really cool looking desktop backgrounds from this torrent (the high resolution jpg's) and I assembled them into one folder, 'cause one thing that kinda sux about this is which ever theme you choose, the only desktop backgrounds you'll see are the ones that are part of each individual theme. So I've created a massive folder of the most wicked wallpapers, all from this torrent. You could do this yourself, but since I've already done it, and renamed all the pics, might as well get it from me. Then put it in My Pictures or some place, and manually change the settings for the theme you like to pick the contents of this folder of pictures... screensaver it too if you like... there's 261 wallpapers and they really give off a WOW!!! Effect to passer byes.. Cool..? Right on!"
