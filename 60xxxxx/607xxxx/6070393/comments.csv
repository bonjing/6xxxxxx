,Monkeymusic,2011-01-15T01:00Z,"Some help to you all

1. To install, go to Rosetta Stone V3\_Setup and double click Rosetta Stone 3.4.5

2. Now copy the file in the crack folder to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3"" or ""C:\Program Files\Rosetta Stone\Rosetta Stone Version 3"" if not 64 bit
and delete the original file at the same time

3. To install a language, mount the iso with a program like poweriso

4. go into rosetta stone and click install a language, it will find it and install"

,thisisobvious,2011-01-18T01:25Z,"SOLVED, if anyone else has the issue described above, here's what I did to fix it:


Enable Windows Firewall, add exception for the Rosetta Stone INSTALLER, also I copied ""RosettaStoneVersion3.exe"" to the installation folder, so I could add an exception for it right away. Not sure which one did it, but it worked. Now I think you can disable Windows Firewall again if you wish."
,thisisobvious,2011-01-18T01:32Z,"One last tip, the issue was just that Windows Firewall has to be enabled for the install. If you have it disabled, it cannot write the exceptions, and the installer will determine the install to have failed because of that. You'll need it enabled for both the base program install and the speech installer."

Use Virtual Clonedrive instead. It is an overall better program with an easier interface, and I can guarantee that it works in this particular case. If that doesn't work, re-download the torrent."

,straightflushin,2011-02-17T04:20Z,"Yeah, I can confirm that updating only the language packs is totally fine. Just use the 3.4.7 crack/application here on The Pirate Bay along with these language packs, and update as you please.

,straightflushin,2011-02-17T07:03Z,"Ok, triple post.

Install the 3.4.7 application, apply the crack, then install a language of your choice (You might have to restart to get Rosetta Stone to recognize that the virtual drive has mounted a disc). After installing, it'll ask if you want to apply an update. 

Pick ""Yes"", and then Rosetta Stone will say it needs to restart. It won't come back on even though it says it will, so start it again. AS SOON AS IT IS DONE INSTALLING THE UPDATE, CLOSE OUT AND RESTART YOUR COMPUTER. If you go any further than the home page, you're fucked. 

After you restart, it should be fine, and you can continue using Rosetta Stone with the newly applied update."

,Dscosnach,2011-03-04T08:53Z,"hey just in case any one is having trouble with the application in this torrent 
you can use this app its the one i was running before i found this language pack
-------------------------------------------------------- http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5210152/Rosetta_Stone_3.4.5___Crack(VasiaZozulia)

now once you install it and then switch the cracked files make a desktop shortcut and restart your pc just be safe 
at this point when you run it the are no languages loaded into the program and you will be asked make a non registered user account so that other people in your household can use the program and log there own progress 

as far as the language packs go i downloaded all of them from this torrent and it too me for ever but i can say they work, you just need to know what your doing

first i download power ISO it super easy and fast to get started its all user preference whether its daemon tools or any other virtual cd drive program
-----------------------------------------------------
http://download.cnet.com/PowerISO/3000-2646_4-10439118.html?part=dl-10439118&subj=dl&tag=button

install power iso with the default setting and you are set

go to the file location of your desired language in your computer once the download of this torrent is complete
right click the first language level 
example
----------------------------------------------
English (American) - Level 1.iso
----------------------------------------------
 and you should have a bar that says
""PowerISO""
hover over the ""PowerISO"" bar and select the option to ""Mount Image to Drive...""
select ""Mount Image to Drive...""
And that all there is to mounting the ISO files
"
,Dscosnach,2011-03-04T08:54Z,"so now when you open up your RosettaStone program from your desktop and it asks you load a new language and it will recognize 
the mounted file 
""English (American) - Level 1.iso""
 as a physical disk  

to load your language file you can go to the upper right hand corner of the Rosetta Stone home screen to the middle icon in between the ""?"" and the minimize screen button
select the ""add or remove languages"" option
then ""+add a language level""
then select ""continue"" 
it will search for the language file you mounted in PowerISO
now ""> Install selected language"" 

repeat these steps for every preceding language and level you want  this all loading new languages should take less then 5min "
,fignose,2011-03-04T14:41Z,"Nice upload KaRaKteR, works fine for me!

What I did to install (with Windows 7):
>Download torrent
>Run Rosetta Stone 3.4.5 (in the _Setup folder)
>After installation close, then run Rosetta Stone Speech Installer
>Copy RosettaStoneVersion3 from the crack folder and overwrite the installed version (defaut in program files>Rosetta Stone>Rosetta Stone Version 3)
>Run the program. It prompts CD insertion. Mount the language and level (I used Alcohol 120% for this) then continue. 

It seems straight-forward from there.
Thanks again for the upload!"
,Elzarynn,2011-03-07T23:36Z,"Error #2120

I might have possibly found the fix for that. In my case it was coming up because I did not understand how to use the ""RosettaStoneV3.exe"" file in the Crack folder. I was just double-clicking on it, expecting it to start installing.

Well, here is what you are actually supposed to do: 
1) Install using the ""Rosetta Stone V3 > _Setup > Rosetta Stone 3.4.5.exe"" from your torrent.
---The program will install to folder ""C: > Program Files > Rosetta Stone > Rosetta Stone Version 3""
2) Open folder ""Rosetta Stone V3 > _Setup > Crack"" from your torrent and select RosettaStoneVersion2.exe. Copy the file (Ctrl+C_.
3) Open folder ""C: > Program Files > Rosetta Stone > Rosetta Stone Version 3"" and paste the cracked .exe there. Double-click that, or use the shortcut that appeared when you installed it.

Anyway, that worked for me. So far, I haven't had to activate any of the language packs, so it seems to be working, and I haven't had any more errors. For me, the problem was that everybody assumes that everybody else knows how to use a crack like this. We forget that every crack is someones first.

If this works for you, you can thank me by SEEDING. :)"

,Progy,2011-09-26T20:44Z,"Okay, I'm new to this sort of thing. I have it downloaded, have the crack, and it works and everything. How do you burn all of it onto a cd/dvd?"
,Ruhe000,2011-10-06T09:33Z,"Dear Leechers, 
Fuck you!
Yes, I mean it.

This is a great torrent guys, lets not spoil it by not seeding or limiting upload speed (4.1 kb/s!!!!) Please seed!!"

,Amon69,2011-10-27T11:52Z,"@big1mike7 if you have PowerISO, then it's really simple all you got to do is burn the languages onto cd, or mount from the folder where they are stored. If you still need help let me know."

,CaptainBigP,2012-01-29T01:48Z,"Big props to mister uploader. I do have some thoughts to share though, concerning Rosetta Stone. Some of you might have experienced the annoying bug of the software not being able to read the disc drive, virtual or hard. I came to this conclusion: I have been using a couple of mounting software to work this issue out, none worked. I have tried some workarounds suggested by people on this thread as well as around the web. None did the trick. As I am myself a software engineer, I have decided to share my hypothesis with you guys. I hope it will help future downloaders. To make a long story short: keep restarting your computer and try again loading the language packs in memory, using a mounting software or a real life CD/DVD/BD. I have some serious experience in software programming and maintenance and this king of behavior led me to draw some deductive solutions to common syndrome. One of those is the too much annoying ""random"" behavior. This is caused in 95% of the time by what we call an uninitialized variable. This means that the software behaviour is dependant on the state of the memory BEFORE it has been loaded. Hence, since it isn't our duty as torrent downloaders to fix the code of some 500$ software, the easiest workaround is to flush around memory and make it change as much as you can so you can finally obtain a good combination of memory state bits leading to a correct behaviour of the software. I finally was able to load install the language packs after 3 or 4 upgrades, with the same virtual mounting software I was using when it failed, namely daemon tools. So don't bust yo balz too much on trying to find an answer concerning your software environment, as it is unlikely to be the cause of the problem, in my humble opinion. Cheers, fellow torrenters!"
,CaptainBigP,2012-01-29T01:54Z,"Sorry guys, here is a short list of expressions that need to be replaced in my previous statement:
""3 or 4 upgrades"" for ""3 or 4 system restarts""
""king of behavior"" for ""my experience"" (really, how did this happened?)
The rest is just due to my bad english. Peace!"
,Dr.Hex,2012-01-30T21:34Z,"i installed , cracked , installed a language , prompeted never to update . then nuthiing happens the program blanks .. i restarted and its still like that ... what am i doiing wrong"
,Dr.Hex,2012-01-30T23:08Z,sorry for my stupidity .... just had to restart :P
,stickolous04,2012-02-23T02:33Z,Has anyone tried to download and run this torrent on Ubuntu? I've tried following all the steps that everyone has said. I think i messed it up a few times so I've deleted and re-downloaded the torrent three times and it's still not working. I'm sure it's because Ubuntu and Windows run differently but i'm not sure what to do at this point. If anyone could help that would be AMAZING!
,joynerjoyner,2012-03-07T04:39Z,"@stickolous04 it's most likely not going to work because the way Windows and Ubuntu install and run programs are different. i would suggest installing Wine on your device with Ubuntu and taking it from there.

here is a beginner's guide to it: http://wine-reviews.net/wine-reviews/tips-n-tricks/a-guide-to-wine-on-ubuntu-for-beginners.html"

I'm running Rosetta Stone under Fedora Linux distro and it's same as Ubuntu distro. I used PlayOnLinux (which uses Wine) to install it. Before installing it you need to mount it to some place, for example:
type in Terminal (as root user):
mkdir /mnt/Rosetta/         "
,qwertzo99,2012-05-07T20:57Z,"^^
Piratebay comment algorithms sure suck. It cut out most of my comment. Anyway, since I'm not gonna type everything again, Just use PlayOnLinux (which uses Wine)."
