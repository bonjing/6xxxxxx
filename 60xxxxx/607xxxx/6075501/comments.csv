Would those files play on ""iPod Classic""...??"
[T],MelloYello,2011-01-01T10:44Z,Hey great job on.off.on as always.  Have you any idea when Let Me In (U.S. version) will start showing up?  I thought I read it will be out on DVD Feb. 1st so I'm thinking any day it will be on Pirate Bay.  Keep up the great work.
[T],MelloYello,2011-01-01T10:45Z,Oh forgot. Happy New Year!
