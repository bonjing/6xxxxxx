This is a file from madinaharabic.com which indexes their whole site, so that you can learn arabic offline. I highly recommend this, it's very easy to learn. Note this is classical arabic/pure arabic not street arabic etc... e.g. the difference:

hadtha baytun - This is a house (classical arabic)

hadth bayt - This is a house (in street arabic [colloquial])

This arabic is the arabic of the Qu'ran (classical arabic)
