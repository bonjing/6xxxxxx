,ynkhmer,2011-01-03T06:05Z,thanks for uploading!!  10/10 for all the bonus tracks included :)
,Jack_Raiden,2011-01-03T22:22Z,"Thanks OverdriveA, scarm10, anonymous, mom, seeders. Very nicely done! Greatness from Daft Punk. If only the studios could put the ENTIRE OST+ together like this. (Also: No trojans/viruses! lolwtf)"
,Montei,2011-01-04T07:48Z,can't get it to start downloading. Using a macbook pro snow leapard.
,Montei,2011-01-04T07:55Z,nevermind as soon as i said anything it started downloading. it just finished
,1nteresting,2011-01-04T23:13Z,"Wow. Great upload, thank you so much. They put all the music in so many places, it's a pain. I mean, I can't even buy the second disc because I'm from the U.S., and who knows where you can get the Nokia trackâŚ"
,Jellyb0nes,2011-01-06T06:39Z,"Doesn't it annoy anyone else that they have to butcher an album for the purpose of capitalizing off of it? I hate having 5 different bonus discs, especially if there's only one or two tracks. I get annoyed when you have to re-organize bonus material in itunes yourself. They should have just released everything the way Daft Punk would have arranged it."
,Torium,2011-01-10T17:17Z,excellent!
,ultamanl,2011-01-13T21:42Z,thnx for the complete-edition!
,joshokie,2011-01-15T19:25Z,"Wow, thank you so much for all the extra tracks. "
,tecker,2011-01-22T04:54Z,Can anyone explain what the 'score' files are? I dont see where they came from.
,MarzEz,2011-01-24T12:20Z,"This is just epic.
Thanks for providing the DL!"
,AlienInferno,2011-01-27T18:57Z,Can't get this to start downloading.  Strange.  Any help?
,ventper,2011-01-28T02:05Z,"after watching the movie online 2x, went to the theatre for 3D.
AWESOME! now i'm enjoying this badass soundtrack thx to you overdriveA. 
many thx to your efforts, and the efforts of; Sutanshu, scarm10 and Daft Punk for their creation, wonderful in spite of corporate marketingfuckupgreedasusual.."
,dac1949,2011-02-01T02:39Z,thx very much! Great work!
,melinator95,2011-02-06T08:22Z,"Amazing...
Numberings a bit of at some songs but I put everything in 1 album so it works out perfect

Really fast 2 ;D"
,puppyup,2011-03-03T16:42Z,"By the way, the track that is played when he's at Flynn's at the beginning is from Journey and called ""Seperate Ways""."
,Skeeter21,2011-03-09T05:23Z,thanks overdrive great work
,scottiedoesntknow,2011-03-16T20:12Z,how come i keep getting 0 seeders

,reach,2011-03-28T22:07Z,Perfect. Thanks user!
,Powerslave0,2011-04-05T03:02Z,"These are WAY over modulated.  Did someone edited them and ramped up the volume?  I have the original sound track, and they are no where near as loud as these MP3s."
,bubunapirate,2011-04-16T09:15Z,"Thanks very much for the complete collection :D

I'll keep SEEDING ...."
,ultamanl,2011-04-16T10:22Z,"@Powerslave0 : Damn.. i just noticed it that too.. earlier i tested with normal volume, but once i crank up the volume it sounded pretty bad (low fidelity) :S

Audio quality = 5.5"
,drumrobot,2011-04-18T03:34Z,"Great music, and the quality seems to be pretty good (perfect at normal volumes).
On a side note, Daft Punk is awesome--this is the perfect movie for them.

Thanks for the great upload."
,takyirklosov,2011-04-18T08:42Z,"Absolutely beautiful.



5 out of 5 potatoes"
,greenbeard2000,2011-06-11T23:21Z,OverdriveA respect and thanks
,kockunge,2011-07-10T16:30Z,"the music is better with the film, first of all, its ""backgroundmusic"" but lots of the tracks are really similar. Without the film, it gets kind of boring and repetative to me. And I listen to Plastikman!"
,kockunge,2011-07-10T16:32Z,...and u havent made different folders fo the different discs!! so the tracks are all scrambled!!
,HiroPro2,2011-10-17T22:56Z,"Mp3 101 !!!

(1) Encode using LAME (itunes is CRAP using Fraunhofer encoder boo!!)

(2) Set encoder to VBR (variable bit rate) as LAME was engineered for this. CBR is CRAP and in all honesty a VBR altpreset standard at -V0 is as good as a 320 CBR !!!! and file is WAY SMALLER!!!

(3) SET IT TO JOINT STEREO NOT ""STEREO"" and if I have to explain don't ask because you have no comprehension of what the setting actually does or the maths/technology behind mp3!!!

owhh and LEARN how to use GOOGLE and RESEARCH ripping music PROPERLY you 320 CBR Fraunhofer RETARDS!!!

PS dBpoweramps is FANTASTIC ripping software! "
,hugefootlong,2011-11-01T20:12Z,"Daft Punk are amazing and there music should be available to all,no exception,,music is art and art is for everyone,,thank you so much for helping us discovering Daft Punk,,Perhaps later I will purchase an album and post it on TPB... "
,Unknown16,2012-01-07T15:58Z,"Sounds like Mass Effect's OST and Bladerunners. If you've ever listened to ME's OST compare ""New Worlds"" to Tron's ""The Game Has Changed"""
,misamoa,2012-03-08T21:31Z,Que buena!
,pekimaki,2012-04-09T09:28Z,txanks a lot
,orsadam,2012-05-17T10:07Z,"If you want to pump it out loud on a good sound setup get the FLAC version. This is perfectly good for what it's supposed to be, MP3"
,AWESUMNESS,2012-06-18T05:53Z,"Sounds is ok, however it could have been a lil bit more sharper"
