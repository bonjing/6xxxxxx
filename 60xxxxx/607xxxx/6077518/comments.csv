In short: account creator must be same person who verify it **correction about making hangame account by Yakuza**"

,LordBastor,2011-01-11T12:42Z,"To actually play the beta you need a hangame.com account, which frankly isn't that hard to get. Koreans sell them for about 10 bucks a piece and it is worth it to test out the game. The issue with making one yourself is that you need a korean KSSN (personal ID number) and a korean phone number for confirmation. 
Thanks for the upload since downloading the game from korea takes a LOOONG time."

,fanana2,2011-01-13T17:07Z,"I see so many people at 100% that don't seed.

It would be ok if this was a normal torrent but its 22 damn GB of data.

Seed for fuck's sake.

Leave it open seeding while you're asleep...
Ok you got the client and you're in the game but think about all these people that wanna play too.
Would you like it being in their place waiting for some cunt to stop being a selfish faggot and seed the game?

Even seeding at 50 kbps will help.



As for the accounts issue.
There's countless sites that sell them online for a few $$"
,LordBastor,2011-01-13T17:18Z,"The issue is that we can't seed not that we don't want to. I mean this isn't the installation directory it is the game directory and it is patched up by the loader. So if i try to seed I have to de-patch the game which honestly I have no idea how to do.

The game itself is awesome tho. I will download the torrent again and use it to seed "

,reed199,2011-02-14T19:50Z,"So, let me just explain something to the few that will read it. 

Tera's OBT session is over, It's retail now. There are only two way's of playing the game. The Client from the Korean website and this torrent. You can use this OBT to update and play retail. The Korean download will take you a week at best.

Barely anyone is seeding and normally I wouldn't really care. If the game is going to receive any decent number of English speaking player's we need this torrent to get more seeder's.

It's simple. If you're reading this then don't cap your upload rate, Seed as often as you can, and when you're at 100% keep seeding. This isn't a movie where you can go look for another torrent. Right now this is the only torrent available. I am one of the few at 100% that actually stay's to seed. Do whatever you can to help.

If you ever actually do get to play retail. A community of English speaking player's has formed on Mystel."
,Delfistyaosani,2011-03-27T22:41Z,Interesting when hacked servers will appear? Or will it be possible to play some time as trial after european release?
,allexffs,2011-03-28T16:06Z,"cmon, seed people, we need to get more english speaking players in this game!! im seeding all i got here. im on 30/30 connectio, seeding at 3 mb/s"
,Delfistyaosani,2011-03-30T19:36Z,"So lazy, RARing at normal decreased size to 17GB, I'll update, RAR at best mode and and try to seed from a few points (sorry guys home upload is 1Mb/s, ADSL sucks anyway...)
Thanks for release BTW, hope Gildor will add GPK support to UMODEL soon"
,call_me_nobody,2011-08-21T20:31Z,"1: Download of tis beta complete.
2: got error that xsystem.dll (fixed by downloading it)
3: Got error that porteauthforclient.dll is missing (that dll is reported as a virus and malware and no other way to download it)

Conclution?
This game is not usable, i recommend waiting for the real deal that comes spring next year."
,Philonetic,2011-08-31T22:26Z,"No longer valid, this client will not work."
,Zulwarn,2012-04-11T22:13Z,"Don't download this

First This totally in Korean
Second this doesn't work anymore
Third Huge Size not even compressed a bit
Fourth Unreliable.
Fifth Since it's not released for both Europe and US there ain't much English speaking people out there and Cracked servers to play. so it's totally hard to find people. so 
WAIT TILL NEXT YEAR so you can find plenty of Cracked servers and the people  , and a better repack small size version.  "
