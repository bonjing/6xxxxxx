,zzyzyc,2011-01-22T23:56Z,"SilverSurfer, are you a pimpled 14 year old living in your parent's basement? Why use such stupid language in a comment? Come on, grow up and speak to people like a human."
,zaroba,2011-01-30T14:22Z,"zzyzyc, you might want to do some growing up yourself given the insults."
,AVonly,2011-04-07T07:24Z,"Ok...I need to get this off my chest. 

1) A DVD Screener is a DVD! Jesus Christ, how many times does somebody have to post ""I donâ€˜t see a difference"". A DVD screener is usually an early copy of the movie, a copy given out to reviewers, a copy given to academy award voters etc... 

2) Stop yelling at the spammer...he/it/they arenâ€˜t fucking listening! Do you think that the bot/low paid chinese worker who posted that comment comes back to read what you fucking people write? And if he/it/they did, do you think he/it/they would give a fuck what you people think? 

3) The ONLY reason to put in a comment is for audio/video commenting...I donâ€˜t care what you thought of the movie, I donâ€˜t care for your retarded comments, I just want to know (based on DVD quality) what the movie looks like, PERIOD!"
