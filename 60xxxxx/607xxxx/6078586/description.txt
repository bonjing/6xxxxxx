Encoder's notes:
I've cropped 24 pixels from both top and and bottom of the frame (black bars), hence the resulting 1:86:1 AR (no stretching afer resize was done). Very poor blu-ray transfer (see review at blu-ray.com). I did the best I could to remove the mosquito noise and haloe from the source while preserving detail using some filters that really slowed down the encoding process to less than 3 fps for a total encoding time exceeding 24 hours. See source vs encode screenshot comparison --as always, take it or leave it.
