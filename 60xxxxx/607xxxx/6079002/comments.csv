,mozbius,2011-01-07T07:28Z,"Quality:
Audio= 6-8 (some time will sound poor some time decent)
Video= 6.5 (very dark, blurred edges)

Feels like a very old VHS... Like seeing through greasy glasses... Personaly I'll wait for a better quality release so not to waste the viewing of what looks like a nice movie with nice special effects."
