,pizzicato_,2010-12-31T20:23Z,"this is a /very/ amateurish re-editing of Star Trek IV, starring squids (for the sake of my partner, who is afraid of whales, and loves Star Trek, and had not seen only this film on account of this fear). 

I will ignore all comments about how lame it is, or how I ruined your Star Trek experience. But I do welcome constructive comments for re-re-editing.  "
