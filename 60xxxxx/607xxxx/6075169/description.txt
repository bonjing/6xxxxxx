The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty, is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. The opera's official premiere was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on 31 December 1879, where the show was well-received by both audiences and critics. Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the Opera Comique, where it ran for a very successful 363 performances, having already been playing successfully for over three months in New York.

The story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic finds out, however, that he was born on February 29, and so, technically, he only has a birthday each leap year. His apprenticeship indentures state that he remains apprenticed to the pirates until his 21st birthday, and so he must serve for another 63 years. Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.

Pirates was the fifth Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and introduced the much-parodied Major-General's Song. The opera was performed for a century by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Britain and many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide.

It has received several modernized productions, including Joseph Papp's 1981 production on Broadway, which ran for 787 performances, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical, and spawned many imitations. Pirates remains popular today, taking its place along with The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.

Trivia 

In Act II, there is an extra song ("My Eyes Are Fully Open") that is not originally from "The Pirates of Penzance." It's a modified version of a song from William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan's "Ruddigore". The inclusion of this song 

required Kevin Kline, Angela Lansbury, and Rex Smith to sing one of most dizzyingly rapid songs in the entire Gilbert and Sullivan catalog.

In this version several lines of dialogue and song lyrics have been changed to be comprehensible to an American audience. Thus "Can it be Custom House?" becomes "Can it be the Coast Guard?"

Towards the end of the film, the pirates and police interrupt a production of "H.M.S. Pinafore" (also by William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan).

Pirates of Penzance was shown on a Los Angeles television movies channel - SelecTV - simultaneously with its theatrical release. This was only the second time that something like this had been tried - in 1956, Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version of Shakespeare's "Richard III" had its U.S. premiere in New York City and its television premiere on NBC on the same day. Like "The Pirates of Penzance", "Richard III" was also a box office flop, but unlike the former film, "Richard III" won universal acclaim from the critics, became a film classic, and was not boycotted during its theatrical run.

A boom on the Pirates' ship carries the friendly label "Watch Your Head." This is visible during the "I am a Pirate King" number.

Although the chorus consists of British performers, they are all lip-synching to the American singers from the original Broadway production.

The film's failure at the box office had nothing to do with the reviews, which were often quite positive. The real problem lay with Universal's decision to release the film simultaneously to SelectTV and to theaters. Theater owners were so angry that they boycotted the film; in the end, a grand total of 92 theaters agreed to show it, and it enjoyed a long run at only one of them (in Washington, DC, where it became a cult success and played several weeks).

Estelle Parsons was the only member of the principal cast of the 1982 Broadway production (Kline, Smith, Rondstadt, Azito, Rose, Parsons) not to appear in the film. She was replaced with Angela Lansbury for Ruth.

The Broadway production of "The Pirates of Penzance" by William S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan opened at the Uris Theater in New York on January 8, 1981 and ran for 787 performances. The musical received four Tony Award nominations for acting including George Rose and Tony Azito who both recreated their roles in the movie version.

Linda Ronstadt was nominated for the 1981 Tony Award (New York City) for Actress in a Musical for "Pirates of Penzance" and recreated her role in the film based on this production.

Kevin Kline won the 1981 Tony Award (New York City) for Actor in a Musical for "The Pirates of Penzance" and recreated his role in this production.

Reportedly, during casting for this movie, John Travolta lost out to Kevin Kline in getting the lead role of The Pirate King.

Sir Arthur Sullivan's original orchestrations, nearly always used in stage revivals of all of Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas, as well as in the 1939 and 1967 film versions of "The Mikado", were completely discarded and rewritten for the 1982 revival of "The Pirates of Penzance" and this film version of it.

Tony Azito as the Sergeant of Police in the 1980 Broadway revival of The Pirates of Penzance, starring Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline. His performance earned him a Tony Award nomination and a Drama Desk Award, and he repeated the role in the 1983 film version. Azito went on to perform at Radio City Music Hall, the Mark Taper Forum, and in the abortive American National Theater company at Kennedy Center. After playing Feste in the NYSF production of Twelfth Night (1986), directed by Wilford Leach. His last Broadway role was in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, also directed by Leach. While in the road company of The Mystery of Edwin Drood, both of Azito's legs were badly broken after being struck by a cab. It would take a couple of years for Tony to get back on his feet. He went on to perform in a summer stock revival of "She Loves Me" in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, and in productions of Tom Stoppard's "Travesties" and the musical "Amphigorey."
