$tache Money (The Anti-Critic)- New Album Pick of the Week -

Throughout the year, I\'ve compiled a New Year\'s Playlist of the 2010 Tracks that either:

a) give me chills or
b) make me say: \"holy shit, this is amazing\"

Cutting this list down to Thirty-Three Tracks was simultaneously excruciating and exhilarating. The result of my pleasure and pain is a compilation of Thirty-Three Tremendous Tracks that I truly love. My hope is that you\'ll take the time to appreciate the genius that I\'ve found in each of these works and they will bring you the same life they bring me.
