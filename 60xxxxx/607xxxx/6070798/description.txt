Frances O'Brien, devout Catholic and panic disorder sufferer, runs a very tight ship as Head Librarian at the Middleton Interactive Learning Centre. Her life unravels when she is forced to employ her ex-best friend, Christine Grimwood - now facing criminal charges - as the Children's Librarian.

Suddenly long buried feelings, that Frances has suppressed since she last saw Christine nineteen years ago, rush at her like a truck. She must do all she can to contain her menacing past and concentrate on the biggest event of the Library calendar year - Book Week.

Written by Robyn Butler and Wayne Hope. Featuring Robyn Butler, Roz Hammond, Heidi Arena, Stephen Ballantyne, Keith Brockett, Bob Franklin, Kim Gyngell, Wayne Hope, Josh Lawson, Nicole Nabout.
