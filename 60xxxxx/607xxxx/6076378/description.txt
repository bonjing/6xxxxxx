Before heading out on the open water, plan your voyage with HomePort â€” marine trip-planning softwareÂ¹ that lets you plan and organize routes from the convenience of your computer.

Use your existing BlueChartÂ® preprogrammed card, or transfer the preloaded mapsÂ² directly from your chartplotter to an SDâ„¢ card. Then simply plug the card into your computer\'s card reader to start planning your voyage.

Navigating waters with no visible landmarks or shallow shorelines can be a daunting task for even the most experienced navigator. With your existing BlueChart data together with HomePort on your computer, youâ€™ll have the ability to view map details such as underwater hazards and hidden obstacles and plan a route to avoid them.

HomePort also offers features such as depth profiles, distance and bearing measurements, and tidal predictions.
Manage Your Data

In addition to managing waypoints, routes and tracks, you can store information from past voyages right on your computer. HomePort also will help you create point-to-point routes, determine fuel usage and estimate your travel time for each leg of your route â€” saving you time and money.
View Marine Charts

Itâ€™s easy to browse and view chart detail on your computer screen and mark waypoints and other points of interest. When finished, send the data to an SD card or proprietary Garmin datacard to load into your compatible Garmin chartplotter or sounder.

HomePort is compatible with BlueChart, BlueChart g2 and BlueChart g2 VisionÂ® navigation charts. Currently, it is only compatible with WindowsÂ® operating systems.

Â¹HomePort software does not include map data.

Â²Inland Lakes software is not compatible with HomePort. If using a device preloaded with Inland Lakes software in conjunction with BlueChart g2 and g2 Vision pre-programmed cards, only the pre-programmed cards are compatible.
