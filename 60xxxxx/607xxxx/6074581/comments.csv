,zato1,2010-12-31T09:38Z,"@pupyup: Just click on the files tab, you'll see the subs are .srt."
,stagesmith,2011-01-01T10:35Z,"The English subs are all wrong. They don't sync up anywhere. I even tried resyncing them using Subfix and they really don't match. Something isn't right. I think they may be the subs for the Standard Cut, not the Extended Cut.   Video and Sound are great."
,desuru,2011-01-02T14:37Z,"same problem here with the english subs.  don't match at all.  tried with vlc and quicktime (perian) with problems on both.  

Can someone post the appropriate subs (if the exist?)"
,1happyowl,2011-01-03T05:19Z,Super Video with sharp detail BUT audio is in Swedish and subs are in ?Korean?.  Great viewing if one has seen short version (several times is best) and can follow the plot. Google cant find a true extended version with English subs.  But this was great viewing for a true fan. Thanks for the GREAT Torrent

,puppyup,2011-01-11T13:28Z,"No English subs for the extended cut out there so far. The English subs of this torrent don't match. They are not for the extended, only the normal cut. Obviously some dumbass ripped this without checking."
,markysre,2011-02-17T14:57Z,Thanks a lot

,rylertyr,2012-02-13T15:15Z,"Okay so I'm pretty new at this, but first of all, thank you for sharing this! There's a whole bunch of .par2 files and a .smi file but when I open the .mkv with Windows Media Player Classic (comes with the CCCP codec pack), there's no video, only sound. What should I do to watch it properly? Thank you."
