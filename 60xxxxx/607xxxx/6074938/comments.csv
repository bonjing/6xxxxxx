,Nomadic26,2011-03-08T10:08Z,"Trying to run with USB loader gx on NTSC system... my system blacks out and has to manually shut down and restart

even with settings untouched it should show grayscale and scrolling or something messed up like that.

with normal settings changed, Forced NTSC, vid patch yes, etc.. still getting same frozen black screen.

this work for anyone else?"
