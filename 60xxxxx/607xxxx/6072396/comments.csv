There are absolutely no Cam versions here at all, it's taken me a quit bit of time and research to make this as complete as possible, with the best quality available.

As well, any files from aXXo work on a Philips standalone DVD Player [Divx]. I'll keep you posted once all 18 disks are tested on this player.

If there are any tips on how to make these torrents upload faster please let me know, This is my first torrent ever and I'd hate to keep you all waiting because of something I forgot to do. If there are any problems with any of these files, please let me know ASAP.

If you want to see future compilations please just ask for more. I really do hope you enjoy this compilation as I've done this all for you... :)"
