,skillet92,2010-12-30T19:28Z,"Reduce the bit rate to abt 1750 and rip!

keep it up :)"
[T],frapper101,2010-12-31T01:44Z,"@skillet:
the rip shud be watchable evn at 32', i keep that as a parameter for my encode...in fact it doesnt look bad evn at 42'...the persmisble range i found after experimentin was givin me a size range of 1.5 to 2.5gigs...1750 kbps would hav bought u 400 odd mb difference..i think its worth a extra mile (i say this evn after knowin abt the fact that some g8 encoders rip a whole movie in HD in an around 400mb range LOL)
will b keepin it high enough only for g8 movies
keep an eye on my nxt upload
u may find it interesting and evn contrasting to wateva i jus said LOL
appreciate ur response 
i'll b needin it all d tym
:)

[T],frapper101,2011-01-18T18:13Z,"@McBoingBoing:
U possibly dont knw d meaning of Hard Coded Subs..as far as my rip is concerned i hav muxed the subs not 'HARD CODED' it....pullin ur hair and shoutin WTF wont make the subtitles go away....
If u use VLC
right click>video>subtitles track>disable
Do the same thing for other player if u use them (disable the subtitle track)
If u are still shoutin WTF WTF google ""How to disable subtitles"" many people can provide u wit sum nice answers might help you.
AND FYI no one is dat foolish to hard code english subs wit english audio i do that for my many foreign downloaders who sumtym face problem wit the ascent...

@prax83: thks...i kinda droped the idea of completeing the series but nw considerin d fact u r waitin i will rip and upload them 2...will keep d size between 2-3gb
2 busy wit bourne series nw will up xmen 2 3 4 after dat
