,jfkbusdriver,2010-12-31T23:15Z,"Not working with Windows 7 64 bit.
Patch works and program starts, but DVDFab does not see my source drive, but it does see the Target drive when trying to back up DVD's and BD's.
I uninstalled this and reinstalled the previous version 8.0.6.5 which works perfectly.
Somebody please verify this issue.  

Maybe it's a DVDFab issue.  Every so often they release an version that has a problem.  This is the first time I have seen this issue with this program."
