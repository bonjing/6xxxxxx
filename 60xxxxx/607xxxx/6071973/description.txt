The A-Team is a 2010 American action-comedy film based on the television series of the same name. It was released in cinemas in the United States on June 11, 2010 by 20th Century Fox.[6] The film was directed by Joe Carnahan and produced by Stephen J. Cannell,[7] and brothers Ridley and Tony Scott.[8][9] The film has been in development since the mid 1990s, having gone through a number of writers and story ideas, and being put on hold a number of times. Producer Stephen J. Cannell wished to update the setting, perhaps using the first Gulf War as part of the backstory.[10]

The film stars Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, Quinton Jackson, and Sharlto Copley as The A-Team, an elite army team, imprisoned for a crime they did not commit. They escape and set out to clear their name. Jessica Biel, Patrick Wilson and Brian Bloom are in supporting roles.

The film received mixed reviews from critics,[11] and performed slightly below expectations at the box office.[3] The reception from the cast of the original series, The A-Team, too, was mixed.
