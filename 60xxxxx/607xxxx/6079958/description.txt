 The custom of Natha Pratha states that if for 
 any reason a women wants to leave her husband,
 her father or any other person who supports   
 her, has to pay compensation to her husband.  
 The amount of compensation is decided by the  
 people who hold the judicial post Panchayat.  
 If the said amount cannot be paid, the woman  
 is punished by the villagers for leaving her  
 husband.This punishment can be as degrading as
 stripping and parading her naked in front of  
 the whole village. On the contrary, if a      
 husband wants to leave his wife, he need      
 not give any reason or explanation for doing  
 so.
