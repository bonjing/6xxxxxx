,UK_Squiff,2011-01-02T00:43Z,"When I select aircraft, 'Invalid Licence' pops up..FSX crashes"
,lodestar738,2011-01-02T01:39Z,"I don't understand why, it work's fine on my system, i don't have a licence too. Do You installed from virtual drive?"
,OlaNordmann7,2011-01-02T01:45Z,"Thank you lodestar738, for this updated release! Will help you share this, as soon as I have finished downloading it.

To: ""catshit1"":  please, if you don't have anything useful to say - please shut up instead. 
You are wrong! KLM (or to be correct: AirFrance-KLM) use the Fokker-70 and Fokker-100 aircraft - and they are of significance! Even if you are living in your small ""bubble"", and don't know their history. (I saw your tragic message, in the previous F-70/F-100 release from lodestar738).

KLM-AirFrance is actually the world largest airline, if rated by their income. If rated by flown passenger-kilometer, AirFrance-KLM is the worlds third largest airline (and largest in Europe). Before the merger with AirFrance, KLM was the oldest airline in the world - still flying under their original name."
,lodestar738,2011-01-02T02:47Z,"Thanks OlaNordmann7, please tell me after installing if it works on your's system. This will be very nice plane when VC will be finished"

...

,martronn,2011-01-02T21:19Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4196330/FS2004_-_F1-Digital_Aviation_Fokker_70_100

Maybe its a working crack in here??"
,lodestar738,2011-01-02T21:50Z,"martronn: i tested only on windows7 64bit, but if works on win7 should be work everywere. It's important to mount iso file to virtual drive and then go to virtual drive to folder ""Fokker"" and install from there, after that run update. If you installed this way and still don't work's - i dont know how to help you, maybe some problems with antivirus-if you using AVG, or with windows vista. Try http://digital-aviation.de/forum/"
,Humrod,2011-01-05T15:29Z,Ok pals i use the komu craked digichk4.dll from the old torrent and works ok now. Just install from virtual drive and change the dll.

,azerty741,2011-02-11T18:34Z,everything freezes
,cdzitu,2011-09-02T16:39Z,"Does NOT work! This torrent is a farse! The SP 2.5 isn't cracked. If you use Komu's so-called crack, everything freezes. If you don't, you can't even select the aircraft, you get a Invalid License."
,Gannd,2012-03-12T14:57Z,"Thanks lodestar738. I confirm, this works!!!

I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and FSX.

When I installed this software the first time, my FSX froze as soon I chose one of the Fokker repaints.

I unistalled the software and reinstalled it mounting the ISO file with Daemon Tools Lite.

Just follow the instructions of this torrent to install the main DA Fokker program and the SP 2.5, and after that download:

http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6088730/Crack_DA_Fokker

and replace digichk4.dll into your main FSX folder."
