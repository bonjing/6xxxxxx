,scottsasse,2011-07-01T23:38Z,"THANK you so much!! And it's in FLAC!! Plus it's still seeding strong (I'm showing 39 seeders and pulling about 110kBps). Can't wait to get my Lucifer on *_* and will seed the hell out of this when done. Probably haven't heard this album since I was 15 years old!! Once again, THANK YOU!! Don't know why I had to be the only one to say so. I guess Diamond fans are ungrateful Satan worshiping junkies!! Love & Gratitude, DrScott  "
