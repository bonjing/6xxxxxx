Mary Walsh delivers boyfriend Kevin to a hospital for routine outpatient surgery. But 
when Mary returns to take him home, he's mysteriously vanished. An administrator can 
find no record of him, and a police search turns up nothing. Increasingly frantic, 
Mary's taken to staff psychiatrist Dr. Bensley, who pronounces her unstable. Now she 
must not only find her missing boyfriend, but prove her own sanity as well. When a 
stranger informs her he knows Kevin's whereabouts and demands a $10 billion ransom, 
she has one hour to comply... and her boyfriend's life hangs in the balance. Forced 
to embezzle the money from the bank where she works, Mary soon discovers the shocking 
truth behind the disappearance. Now time is running out and she must take matters into 
her own hands to save herself.
