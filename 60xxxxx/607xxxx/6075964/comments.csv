,jon4fun,2011-01-01T07:53Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

@ All and Sheoll99 in particular - there is no comparison. I'm not having a go or putting you down. Thte 720p you get from 20-40 is NOT directly comparible to standard 720p.
One of the main reasons, there are many, that 20-40 has started to release HIS version of 720p movies is that 'people' don't think it is worthwhile to DL and SEED if isn't 720p format. 'People' are idiots!
