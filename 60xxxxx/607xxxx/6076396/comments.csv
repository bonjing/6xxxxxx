The mods compilation in the archive is broken by last mod (zeRobuRn's MobSpawnerCrafting) that i somehow had it working or fooled myself that i had somehow and discovered later that it doesn't work while fiddling around.

I uploaded the updated and working mod compilation in the below link:

,w0lfshad3,2011-01-01T20:55Z,"Seems to work fine now, only snag it will crash once at first when opening the inventory, but after you reload the world it's stable."
,w0lfshad3,2011-01-02T00:55Z,"You also need to copy mods\zombe dir and contents from compilation to .minecraft dir instead of the minecraft.jar to make Graves mod work, else you'll only find empty ones. The author decided to not do it like everybody else :-/"
,hollowlt,2011-01-02T18:02Z,why I cant hit anything and no damage from mobs? :S
,hollowlt,2011-01-02T19:41Z,can someone upload your minecraft. all directory except your saves.
,w0lfshad3,2011-01-03T19:06Z,"@hollowlt, read the messages above, one of the mods was creating invincibility, go to the link i posted for the updated mod cocktail. Read the thread for the strawberry mods cocktail, i keep it updated:
