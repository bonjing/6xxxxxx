The Long Lost duo consists of husband and wife Alfred (a.k.a. electronic Daedelus) and Laura Darlington. 

In contrast to the avant-electronics and hip-hop aesthetics of Alfred's music as Daedelus, The Long Lost is a union of two songwriters and producers with a penchant for sad sounds and delicate, electro-acoustic melodies -- psychedelic lullabies for lovers and the lovelorn. 
As well as Sa-Ra, Laura has also sung for Flying Lotus. 

The group consists of Alfred A. Darlington (vocals, guitar, bass, bass clarinet, etc.) and wife Laura B. Darlington (vocals, alto flute, toy piano, omnichord, etc.) who are often joined onstage by Amir Yaghmai (violin & falsetto), Jonathan Larroquette (computer machines) and Andres Renteria (percussion).
