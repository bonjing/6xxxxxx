,ShitsheriffYo,2011-01-08T05:46Z,"Hey thanks for the upload. I couldn't figure out how to generate a licence key though. I installed the DAMN NFO viewer but after viewing all the files i couldn't find anything.

Could you bump this with some steps for the lamen ? Thanks!"
,antileet,2011-01-10T18:27Z,Just overwrite the original exe (in the installed directory) with the one in the /Lz0/ directory (in the download folder)!
,ShitsheriffYo,2011-01-11T02:01Z,"Wow.. That was so painless compared to trying to format for 2 days with my OS and then @ 90% it telling me failed.. 
The quick format of my 2TB HD using swissknife took around 30 seconds.. who da man.. ya you da man! Thanks!"
,the_fallen13,2011-01-29T07:59Z,"Can you please elaborate on the steps, please?"
,smokerdalejash,2011-02-05T13:26Z,HOW DO YOU INSTALL THIS
,jjws999,2011-02-20T04:58Z,"This doesn't work, i apply the crack after I install but all it does is stall at the splash screen"
,antileet,2011-02-24T20:01Z,it's not hard AT ALL if you bothered to read the instructions!! just install as normal then copy over the cracked .exe into the installation directory and run as normal...
,MoneyHustle,2011-05-08T23:46Z,A new version is out.
,bomber9299,2011-06-12T22:34Z,"still don't understand how this all works, Its asking for a serial number and don't know how to overwrite. Can someone help? "

,Cmack8586,2011-07-12T00:17Z,why the hell does it keep asking me for a KEY????? ive copied and pasted the lzo exe into the installation folder closed it and tryed to open the program and it keeps wanting a DAMN KEY!?!?!?!?????
,SoxPatsFanInKC,2011-07-21T05:02Z,This is BS. No key given and the supposed crack is just a shortcut for the program.
,TheBatDad1989,2011-07-30T06:53Z,"Hey all, For some reason the exe. keeps getting deleted by my anti-virus software D: even after turning off real-time and making the exe an exception this still happens. anyone know why?"
,chops925,2011-09-26T21:43Z,well shyt...i have a 2tb external hard drive im trying to format to fat32 but when i install this and put the crack in i get read/write error...wuts this...i have windows vista and i read that its not compatible so i tried on an older comp with windows xp and i still get the same error...any know wut this is?
,Kiba-fang,2011-10-29T06:51Z,"i struggled installing at first with that licence thingy but make sure your offline when copying the crack across and then it works perfect 
thanks antileet was so much better than OS formatting"
,sublimetool,2011-12-13T11:26Z,"Finally figured this out... ok so download the torrent... then install the uncracked .exe ""swissknife_premium"" don't launch the program yet... then go to ""Computer/Local Disk (C:)/Program Files (x86)/SWISSKNIFE"" in here you'll find SWISNIFE (application) which is spelled the same as the cracked .exe NOW you drag and drop the cracked .exe WITH THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON!!! NOT THE LEFT, choose copy and replace (overwrite) then launch the program and it should work... hope i helped"
,NeedWeed,2012-01-03T18:08Z,thank you worked like a charm your a star
