Falsely accused of murder, directions to kidnap, wiretapping...
An action adventure of the 24 hours of a problem-solver who has been set up and must risk his life. <hancinema>

Ex-detective and now private eye Kang Tae-Sik (Sol Kyung-Gu) enters a love motel to take pictures of a couple for an unknown client. Kang Tae-Sik is then shocked to discover a bloody slain woman on the bed. Kang Tae-Sik flees the scene when the police arrive and mistakenly believes he is the killer.

A mysterious man then calls Kang Tae-Sik and offers to clear his name if he kidnaps a high-profile lawyer embroiled in a political scandal. Even more mystifying, the caller is constantly aware of Kang Tae-Sik's every move.

Kang Tae-Sik must now use all of his muscles and the bevy of technological gadgetry at his disposal to clear himself and find the mastermind behind this intricate conspiracy. <asianmediawiki>
