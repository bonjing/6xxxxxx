,underchucken,2011-05-16T20:01Z,"Hey, my anti virus will not let me install this program. It says that it is potentially malicious which is weird since I can run key gens without a hitch.
Just throwing that out there, and maybe an explanation if someone has it.
Peace n love"

,corn_bred,2011-07-24T06:37Z,"Everything installed fine, but most movies that I try to copy, it only does half the movie.  Anybody else with that problem?"
,idoubleyou,2011-10-11T05:49Z,"I am having same problem, Copies fine but only burns about half of movie. If i go into dvd-temp and burn the iso it burns perfectly? I tried different versions along with different compatibility settings. I am running win 7, 4 Gigs ram..Plz help if you have experienced this and fixed it.."
,TheGreatBunghole,2011-10-14T01:54Z,"The .exe file that comes with this is a custom-built program that has a button that says install and one that says crack... the crack button opens explorer to a temp directory that holds a readme file that says the SAME THING as the main file at the end. The program installed, then i cracked it, and then started it. It started the first time with an error message ""abc!"" ... that really gives me a lot of fucking info!   Then I tried to update it through the settings menu and it gave the same ""abc!"" error!  Haven't tried to copy anything yet, but from what I read it doesn't fucking work the way it is supposed to!"
