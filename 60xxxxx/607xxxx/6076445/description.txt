These are, in my opinion, the best four BBC adaptations of nineteenth century British novels: Bleak House, Pride and Prejudice, Vanity Fair and Martin Chuzzlewit. If you've seen any one of these four and agree, get the rest - you will not be disappointed.

All are excellently adapted (three by Andrew Davies) and faithful to the delicious language and fascinating plots of the originals without the idiotic "innovations" that the BBC today encourages. All are packed with the best actors in England embodying some of the most memorable characters created in the nineteenth century. Pete Postlethwaite, for example, in Martin Chuzzlewit and Charles Dance in Bleak House will make you squirm with delight. Enjoy!

(nb three come with English subtitles - can't find any for Chuzzlewit - if anyone has any notions, do tell)


Enjoy and Seed!!
