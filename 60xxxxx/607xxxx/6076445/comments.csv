,M_Raina,2011-03-01T01:17Z,Problem with downloading. Only 99.8 availible. Can you seed please?
,Goofball8,2011-03-10T04:17Z,"Is there any chance that you could reseed this torrent?  Like M_Raina, I'm at 99.8%.  I promise to seed for as long as I can.  Great upload, BTW! =)"
,HuffandPuff,2011-07-02T21:28Z,Having all of these in one package makes it so much easier. I cant wait to watch them. Would someone mind seeding though? I'm at 99.9%. I'll reseed as long as I can after! Pretty please with cherries on top?!
,eirini_c,2012-03-20T22:50Z,"Stuck in 99.9% too, and as far as I can see in utorrent there are many peers in the same state. Could you give a push, please? Only 12MB to seed and the torrent will be alive again..."
