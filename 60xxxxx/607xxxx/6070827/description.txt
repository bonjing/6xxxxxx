The much-derided Midlake would appear to be very much the tip of the 

iceberg. Thereâ€™s clearly a revival of a certain type of folk; one imbued with the 

deep green hues of an imagined Sherwood forest and with more than a hint of 

the madrigal and ancient English and Celtic traditions.

All of which are filtered through the singer/songwriter sensibilities of Crosby, 

Stills & Nash and the soft-focus mystery dramas of the Moody Blues.

Oddly, most of these groups come from America, a country with its own folk 

traditions, but in the case of the Smoke Fairies, these maidens are English 

through-and-through, but flecked with a few influences picked up on touring 

travels through the United States.

This duo has it all down pat: a fruity harmonizing thatâ€™s has more than a 

touch of LA singer-songwriter about it, but also something of Enyaâ€™s ethereal 

wordless vocals; an influence that may be unintentional, but would have been 

unthinkable a decade ago.

Thereâ€™s also a stripped-back, almost rural back-porch, bluesy aspect on a few 

tracks (â€˜Strange Moon Risingâ€™ being a good example) and the totality hangs 

together beautifully.

The spare production works a dream, with guitar and bass textures caught well 

and the cymbals deliciously crisp.

The songs seem to be mostly about fleeting unions and partings, and they find 

a way to breathe poetry into what amounts to young lust.

Downbeat, elegaiac and often downright gorgeous, Through The Low Light & 

Trees, like Midlakeâ€™s The Courage Of Others, is easy to unleash oneâ€™s 

cynicism on. On this occasion, I would prefer to give in and submit to the 

charm.
