Two people take off into the bush with a map, a compass and a head start. The
tracker is on horseback, armed with a local guide and an arsenal of forensic
skills. The prey have 36 hours to reach a finish line some 40 kilometers away
without getting caught. How they escape is up to them.

It's the 'Big' Season for Mantracker - from British Columbia's "Big White" to
"Big River" in Saskatchewan. And to top it off, Mantracker rides south of the
Canadian border for the first time in "Big Bear" - the high desert terrain of
southern California's San Bernardino Mountains.

This season's prey has really done their homework - analyzing the successes and
failures of their predecessors - to come up with even more devious and
outrageous strategies to defeat their nemesis.

The prey are looking for glory. Mantracker is looking for them.
