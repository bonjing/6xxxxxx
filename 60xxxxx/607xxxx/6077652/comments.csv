(it was to begin in march, however we just upgraded our download speed too and that was an excuse to change the terms on us as of right now as we are being told). We hope there are other seeds that can assist too."

(the recent decision by the CRTC put an end to unlimited bandwidth - for the moment) In the meantime, please be prepared to share your seed as our speeds are only meant to keep you going while you share the seed. So you're welcome to in, but you will need to be prepared to share. thanks "
