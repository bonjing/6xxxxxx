      On the 15th anniversary of its launch, this documentary
      follows Father Ted creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews as
      they return to Craggy Island on a road trip across Ireland,
      taking them back to some of the key filming locations from the
      series. Father Ted captured a specific Irish humour rarely seen
      on screen and its impact doesn't seem to have faded. The show is
      revealed as a product of a pair of ambitious writers, a
      brilliant cast and the gently confident producer Geoffrey
      Perkins, whose suggestion of turning a one-off mock documentary
      into a sitcom helped make it the much-loved show it is today.
      Ardal O'Hanlon, Frank Kelly, Graham Norton and many others pitch
      in with their reminiscences of the show, the passion it inspired
      and their memories of the late, great Dermot Morgan.
