[V],globeplus,2011-01-03T07:59Z,"Hapy new year and here it is a small plot of this movie :


Megamind (Will Ferrell) is a super-intelligent alien who â€” at only eight days old â€” is sent to Earth by his parents as his home planet is destroyed by a black hole. However, he lands in the Prison for the Criminally Gifted at Metro City, thanks to another infant alien similarly sent from a different planet who eventually becomes a superhero known as Metro Man (Brad Pitt), defender of the fictional Metro City. As a result, Megamind is raised as a social deviant, who is neglected for his destructive intellect, with his piranha-like sidekick Minion (David Cross) as his only friend. Realizing that he is only gifted in causing trouble, and jealous of all of the attention and praise young Metro Man receives, Megamind becomes a supervillain to rival Metro Man, though he is thwarted on a regular basis."

[V],globeplus,2011-01-03T18:02Z,"To murrambigi : you need with urgence to change your glasses or the computer because i watch and i was simply pleased with all the picture and the main work , i can take critics when them justified but certainly you on this case are really exagerating , this is a very good animation movie with an argument with lot of creativity , simply at not to miss to watch in my opinion , take care and happy new year ."
,trueteller,2011-01-03T19:35Z,SORRY TO SAY GLOBE BUT I THINK U ARE SCARED FOR PUTTING SHOTS. BECAUSE BY SEEING THAT NO ONE WILL DOWNLOAD IT AND THANKS FOR  YOUR GAMES THEY ARE AWESOME  
[V],globeplus,2011-01-03T23:35Z,"To trueteller : i understand what you mean but i am fully of work in many things for the moment , already in other movies i maded the scvreenshots and inclusive shooted videos showing the Dub plugins work , it is that i really donÂ´t have much time for the m,oment , i am making research deeply in some websites stuff that it is hard to find solutions but after sometime i am starting to get somewhere but i need to keep going anyway , thanks for the comment and this one is really worthy to download believe me . happy new year ."
,murrambingi,2011-01-04T00:33Z,"@globeplus,

I am not exaggerating i am simply stating the truth in my comment, why wont you show people screenshots or a sample of the cam?
I am a person of quality movies where you are a person of great games, but it is in my honest opinion that this copy is crap, please dont think i am trying to put people off, because i am not, but i have to tell the community if it is watchable or not, in your opinion it is watchable, but by my standard as a cam it is not watchable at all.
And everyone is entitled to their own opinion. "
[V],globeplus,2011-01-04T11:50Z,"To murrambigi : your etic on the appreciation of the picture is really most appreciated , i think you can find yourself with a place for critic at the Hollywood , just keep going with that power of analysis then you improve your chances to a critic place but anyway and this saying please of course give a little discount because this is torrent cam files worked with the better intention as possible and with the perception that if it wasnÂ´t possible better was because really wasnÂ´t possible better and the conscience about the work is the best , about the movie i still saying that is not to loose and the argument and the animation very good . Thank you for contemplate us with your point of view and please still enjoying more accurate as possible the movies . Thank you ."
