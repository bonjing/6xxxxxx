The residents of Los Angeles are awakened in the dead of night by an eerie light beaming through the window. Like moths to a flame, the light source is drawing people outside before they suddenly vanish into thin air. They soon discover an otherworldly alien force is swallowing the entire population. Now our band of survivors must fight to save their lives as the world unravels around them.
