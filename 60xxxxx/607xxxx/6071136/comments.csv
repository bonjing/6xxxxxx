[V],twentyforty,2010-12-29T16:22Z,"Thanks. Surprisingly, I found time to watch this one, three days ago. Good and weird movie."
,tylr,2010-12-29T20:26Z,guess.. its worth the shot!
,tylr,2010-12-29T20:27Z,..although i wish u did it in sizes somewhere around 500mb~
,muthineni,2010-12-30T05:42Z,"@tylr
well then at 500mb it couldnt have been 720p ..isnt it.?
i dont mind the little extra for amazing quality.
i was told that 720p takes lot more time to encode than 480p.. so when the uploader takes the pain of 720p we should be thanking not complaining.
@20-40
keep going dude.. 720p rules"
,nitrogun,2010-12-30T08:17Z,Thanks again
