,RC2314,2011-01-04T01:17Z,"If I knew where to buy it, I totally would. This is one of the best soundtracks for an anime I've heard in a very long time. Any idea of a website that has it for order?"
,T7xil,2011-01-08T03:35Z,"You can purchase this soundtrack from a number of places.

PlayAsia and CD Japan are both large trusted sites. Simply google them and this soundtrack, you'll find where you can purchase it.

Very much worth it."
