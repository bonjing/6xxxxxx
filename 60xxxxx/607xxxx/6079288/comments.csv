,Aqua32,2011-01-03T10:28Z,"...so.

with TPB dropping the axe on young models I imagine there was a mass exodus of posters. Anyone know what the new popular forum is?

I uh, need to get a message to tikibob. Yeah thats it ;)"

,d9less,2011-01-03T11:09Z,I wonder if even her zombie husband gets to see the vajayski.
,superdonkeydan,2011-01-03T11:17Z,I would also like to know where newstar sets are now being posted
,Ioxen,2011-01-03T11:20Z,"Yeah, was going to ask before, any alternative CM torrent sites or forums?"
,jotunhammer,2011-01-03T18:28Z,"I was thinking about opening a website that would not bow down to bullshit... they say CM is ""illigal"" but then so is copyright and other things TPB does and yet its not being banned, they change they rules to ""fit"" better with society...when are they going to change the rules to disallow movies etc...thats my question"
,lodger111,2011-01-03T19:36Z,"Never. I asked a question on the forum to find out when they were going to ban hate speech - which there is plenty of on here, and is strictly illegal under Swedish law.

Guess what? Not going to happen.  Colour me surprised eh?  This was never about the law."
,themushroom,2011-01-03T23:18Z,"Did they actually make an annoucement & give a reason, or did they just start blocking?"

,proud0,2011-01-04T05:19Z,"TPB = totally pacified bullshit. Amazing how they caved to pressure from some undisclosed nature. If CM is illegal in some jurisdictions, the onus to conform is on the user, not TPB, which is just a warehouse of information. It's a shame that those who enjoy CM (which is NOT CP!!!) are now reduced to scrounging granny pix of aged former CM superstars. "
,yarisdude,2011-01-04T16:03Z,If they cared about the law Piratebay wouldn't exist.
,jotunhammer,2011-01-04T17:18Z,"They care about the law? Copyright is also a part of the law, or did the creators of PB get fined until kingdom come just for fun? They broke the swedish law. If the moderators etc of TPB where to go stricly by the law and remove everything illigal from TPB then it would be very empty. They have betrayed the trust they had in spearheading ""sharing is caring"". Im not at all saying CP should be allowed but if you start removing one thign because its illigal then you should remove everything because its illigal or your no better than the politicians who create their own laws to suit their needs. I thought TPB was for everyone, not just a select few."
,jotunhammer,2011-01-04T17:18Z,"sorry if there been double posting, FF was not reacting when I pressed just once."
,hghatrsk,2011-01-05T00:07Z,"The best place to get any of this content has always been usenet. It shows up there before it does on any torrents or image boards 9 times out of 10. With more and more studios using Digital Watermarking (like Newstar / Tinymodel) it's been much harder to share, they're very quick about banning your account.

Well, besides the recent NS/TM leak that brought us like months into the future for the sets of 8 or 10 girls, but that wasn't a person sharing, it was a hack, the threat they put out for him was pretty funny, too."
,Ioxen,2011-01-05T00:32Z,"hghatrsk, thats funny about that leak.
drop some usenet names for me? i know about totty and sierra."
,hghatrsk,2011-01-05T01:18Z,"a.b.gmodels, a.b.newstar, a.b.p.sandra and a.b.sandra.model, a.b.p.vladmodels and a.b.vladmodels, a.b.p.wals, then of course totty and sierra, are the ones i generally monitor."
,yarisdude,2011-01-06T16:25Z,Any good newsreader-clients? Tried a couple but they fail miserabely on large groups.
,darknessv,2011-01-06T18:44Z,how do i use usenet? does it cost? can it be traced? are there any other torrentsites that post new models etc?
