Let me correct you! my user id is itfigure not iyfigure, got it you fkn loser, moron and idiot!!!

hellboy is a VIP uploader, I am not criticizing  his work and effort, I am just saying that the size isn't right, if he can correct it that would be great, it not it is not a big deal.

,ximikecix,2011-04-27T03:09Z,So if i download a video and its a MP4 file I can change it to maker it burn to a DVD and play it on my DVD player

That is correct. Its is relatively simple. You do really need to adjust many settings as the default is usually just fine. Although I often like to us the (advanced) feature for cropping the conversion slightly, but that's just my preference. After pressing the 'convert now' button, you can choose to burn it to 1 or 2 dvds to retain quality. I haven't seen much difference in compressing it into 1 to save on hassle of having 2 discs & swapping halfway though the movie. The decent Bluray rips often come out higher than bought/rental DVD quality. The only somewhat technical part to pickup on is using the edit menu(after choosing your file to convert) to add chapters into your coversion. Its not really that difficult once you figure it out. Best video conversion program I've ever used. Nice up hellboy!"
,DaMoose74,2011-04-27T09:22Z,haha. sorry. 9th word is DON'T. Not do. Oops
