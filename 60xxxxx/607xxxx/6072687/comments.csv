[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-05T07:24Z,I'm guessing you upgraded rather than did a fresh install. It sounds like your current operating system has some update from Microsoft stopping the crack from working. Do a fresh install and you should be fine.

Never heard of Windows 7 Ultimate N. I think it's safe to assume this is the normal Windows 7 Ultimate. 

When you have changed your boot order, you'll probably still need to press any key to boot from CD. Make sure you press any key when asked to do so, you'll need to pay attention when you first switch the PC on."

,Shadysmurff,2011-01-10T10:28Z,"@Sniffer_V 

I did all the instructions carefully except i burned it using PowerIso instead of ImgBurn, because PowerIso automatically detects the ISO file as a Bootable or Not-Bootable and burn it to my DVD-R , which it detected it as a bootable and burned it, and i re-checked the burn if is succuessfull via re-loading the DVD into the DVD-RW rom and it reads it and auto runs the setup.exe, now i go to BIOS and Edited the Boot Device to my DVD-RW rom, and restart/reboot it, and it reads the CD but give me this:

""CDBOOT: Cannot boot from CD - Code: 5"" instead of the ""Press Any Key to load from CD option"" in the command promt or as you call it DOS

,Shadysmurff,2011-01-10T12:23Z,"@everyone

Nvm, i found out the only difference between these two procedures is: (their basically the same)

1.) Given that you already have the OS files in your Hard Drive or the ISO file on your Hard Drive (you just use Daemontools to open the Directories if you only have 1 DVD-RW rom drive) or if you have 2 DVD-RW roms drives(1DVD-reader rom drive & 1DVD-RW rom drive)then you can modify and burn directly onto an empty DVD-R or RW

http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194&s=d886081e8a449e83e8ab73c65e9ffa77

2.) Given that you DO NOT have the OS files in your Hard Drive or the ISO file on your Hard Drive, and if you only have the Raw CD/DVD of the Windows 7 Installer and only 1 DVD-RW rom then this guide tells you to modify and copying /re-building the ISO img file onto your Hard Drive before you burn it into a DVD-R or RW Discs

http://www.unawave.de/windows-7-tipps/code5-error.html?lang=EN"
,Shadysmurff,2011-01-10T16:20Z,"@Eveyrone

NVM, what i was asking, for those people having trouble with:

""CDBOOT: Cannot boot from CD - Code: 5"" 

instead of the:

""Press Any Key to load from CD option""

in the command promt or DOS.

I find this guide is by far the easiest way to fix that problem (considering that you used and downloaded ""Sniffer_V's torrent file (which is an ISO file)"" on your Hard Drive) just follow the guide as i did below and u'll be having Windows 7 on old Mother Boards in no TIME!:

http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194

PS: Download & Install the Daemon Tools Lite (Free) (Google It!) Mount the image called ""Windows 7 Ultimate - 32 Bit (Auto Activation).iso"" so you can view the directories inside the ISO file as to where to pinpoint the ""Source"" in the ""Source Box"" & what that guide is pointing out the directory where the ""etfsboot.com"" file is!

Summary:

1.) After you have Downloaded Sniffer_V's torrent file. (Google) and download &install Daemon Tools Lite (Free Edition).

2.) After installing Daemon Tools Lite, Open it (right click on the bottom right icon bar ""Daemon Tools"" and click on Vitrual Devices > Device Drive 0: > Mount Image > and find the ""Windows 7 Ultimate - 32 Bit (Auto Activation).iso"" where you downloaded it from Sniffer_V's torrent) and select it.

3.) Follow http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194 guide

4.) And Your Done!"

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-20T21:43Z,I've just checked mine and it says it's activated. Did you upgrade or do a fresh install? If you did an upgrade I can only assume you have an update that prevents this crack from working. This has been uploaded thousands of time over several months and no one has said it has stopped working due it not being activated so I'm guessing it'll be OK.

I changed the update-settings so it wouldn't install anything automatically, checked the list for the one you mentioned but couldn't find it there so I updated. There was one that had an unticked box, and after triple-checking that it was not the same number as the one you are not to install, I figured there would be no harm in installing that as well...

If I open Remove Wat again, it just says that the watermark has already been removed... Considering deleting Remove Wat and re-downloading it, do you think that would work?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-31T22:05Z,The only thing I can think of is that there's an update already in your system that's causing the problems. If you did a fresh install then I've no idea tbh. If you did an upgrade then I'd recommend a fresh install so you know that update is gone. Other than that I haven't got a clue. It seems an odd one. Have you checked the comments on the KMS Activator to see if anyone else has had a similar problem? 
,TauraCasanove,2011-02-02T00:06Z,"Sniffer_V, I did do a fresh install (and the text didn't appear until after a day or so..) 

But this is the kind of thing that happens to me all the time, technology does weird shit around me, haha! It's not causing any trouble, the text is just a little annoying. But I can install updates and the program hasn't said anything about it since the black screen-drama that I solved with the Remove Wat, so I guess there's just a ghost or something.

When I installed this OS on my comp and finally got the internet up. There was no KB971033 update on my updates list. I haven't updated anything except ''optional'' updates. Is it already hidden or just hasn't appeared yet? Or have they changed the name of the update to confuse people?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-22T19:21Z,"I installed it recently and it was on mine. Do you have KB976902? Is that unticked? I've just rechecked mine and the original one has now gone and just that one remains. I think they've changed the number so people install it in error. Even if you do though, Remove WAT fixes it. As it's automatically unticked you can still install updates automatically too. Best just to hide it so you don't install it in error in the future. "
,drago36,2011-02-23T20:29Z,"I wanted to ask about this; I've got it set up on my system, but SP1 came out today. Should I bother to install it (since it comes intergrated with KB971033)? Thoughts?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-24T04:17Z,"It's not coming up on my automatic updates but maybe they put them out at different times for certain countries so they don't get everyone at the same time trying to download it.

When it comes on for me, I'll have a read of how it describes the update. If it doesn't mention anything about genuine validation or similar I'm going to install it. Probably worth googling it as you can bet your life someone with one of these has already installed it. If you feel brave enough, let us know how you get on."
,drago36,2011-02-24T19:27Z,"Hey Sniffer_V,

I read that the WAT Update gets installed with the Service Pack, and you can't unbundle those, generally, so there's no way of avoiding it. I've decided to wait it out for now."

,Kristy85,2011-02-27T16:23Z,"Hi Sniffer, can you help me, please?

I've had this on my laptop for the last 2 - 3 days with no problems what so ever, but today I got a popup saying 'you must activate Windows within 27 days to continue using all Windows features'.
I didn't do an upgrade, I did a proper fresh install of it, and I didn't install the Windows update you said not to, so these two things can't be the problem.
Do you know if I'll be able to still use this once the 27 days have ran out, or will I loose it or most of its features?
When I was doing the fresh install a screen came up (where you could tick the boxes) asking about activating and I just left the original box ticked which said something along the lines of 'register online at a later date' or something like that. I didn't want to not tick the box because you hadn't left instructions to do so. I wonder if this is the problem? I really don't want to do another fresh install as its taken me about 3 days to set up and get all my programs and files back, etc.

Hope to hear from you soon, and great download btw :)"
,Kristy85,2011-02-27T16:53Z,"PS: Do you think the update 'service pack 1' could be doing this? It was fine before I installed that; none of these popup messages at all?

Regards!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-27T20:50Z,"Kristy, you did the right thing in not changing any of the tick boxes during install. In 27 days time I'm sure your system will still work fine. It did it to mine when I installed the update I shouldn't have (learnt the hard way) but all it did was change my desktop background to black and have a message in the corner of the screen. I googled it and that's when I discovered Remove Wat.

SP1 hasn't come up on mine yet but someone a few comments up said theirs had and it mentioned the dodgy update. 

Last time Microsoft came out with something to identify all the dodgy versions, it was cracked within 24 hours. You'll have no worries in 27 days time, everyone will be having a go at cracking it.

For anyone else, wait a while before installing SP1, as soon as there's more news I'll update this thread."
,Kristy85,2011-02-28T11:12Z,"@Sniffer

Thanks for that. I've doubled checked all my updates and can't find the one you told us not to install so it's definitely not that (in fact I've got it hidden). However, I believe SP1 to be the culprit; it's the only thing I can think of. I checked my services and startup programs and guess what's there... Windows Activations Technologies. I reckon it was hidden in SP1, the cheeky buggers. I've now downloaded 'removeWAT' and its gone :)

If anyone else is having the same problem just search 'removeWAT' on here, download it, close all programs, run as administrator, and the rest is done for you. Just restart your computer and all should be well.

Thanks again Sniffer for an excellent torrent and for being so helpful. Oh, and ignore the spammers, they're just jealous, and we can all spot them a mile off.

Kind Regards!"
,Kristy85,2011-02-28T11:34Z,"PS: SP1 is definitely the culprit, it includes the dreaded update KB971033 - http://techie-buzz.com/windows/windows-7-activation.html

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-03T01:59Z,"Aboveandbeyond,
No idea is the short answer. If you've installed it and it's working I'd suggest it's probably OK.

Re the updates, the ones to avoid are automatically unticked. You can install the rest. I've installed all the malicious software removal tools and they're fine. When Microsoft release an update that the cracked versions don't like they tell you in the description. If it says nothing about genuine windows, install it."

Don't worry though, go ahead and install SP1 (you need it really for security reasons) and when you start getting the annoying 'activate' popups just download 'RemoveWAT' from here, run it (close all other programs, run as administrator) and viola, popups gone, along with the offending update KB971033.

END QUOTE:

Depends on your computer architecture...
If you got an old comp its probably 32bits=x86, and if it is a new one, it might be 64bits=x64...

So if you got a really recent computer, try x64 first, then x86 if x64 doesn't work, and vice versa if your computer is an old piece of crap, like mine."

This is nothing new and is not related just to this program. XP was the same as was Vista and now Windows 7. Have a search of google and you'll find it's always been like this. If I were you I'd get a blank DVD and put all your important stuff on it and then do a fresh install. If you don't have a partition then make one when installing this, it makes it so much easier in the future for things like this. If you do have a partition, you can do a fresh install on the other partition and you'd then have both so you could access all your files. Use Vista Boot Pro to sort out the dual boot, it's free and works great."

many releases are good for 3 months, and then somehow detect the illegit copy. Are you SURE this will work forever? 

I'm running WinXP from Piratebay, and it went extremely smoothely - do I have to expect any difficulties/additional hurdles that the pirated XP doesn't have?

I really only want to switch to 7 if the release will stay good and stable beyond 3 months.

Can you upgrade from XP? As stated you need to do a fresh install, all your files will be wiped but it works perfectly. 

Someone asked if it will work on here mums laptop? Yes it will, it will be a lot faster than Vista. 

Is definitely 32 bit and not 64 bit? It's got both options which is why it's 3.5 Gb.

Can you go back to XP? Yes but you'd need to reinstall XP, you can't do a system restore.

I have read all 205 comments and it doesnt look my problem has been raised yet.

I tried installing from a usb and the installation failed at some point. An error came up which says ""The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows, click ""OK"" to restart the computer, and then restart the installation"". 

I'm now stuck in an infinite restart loop.

I have tried changing my BIOS settings to boot from usb which goes straight to the above error message. I burnt the program to a bootable disc and changed my BIOS settings to boot from DVD which also gets the error. I even tried using my dad's legit copy of Windows 7... which gets the error message.

Should I just try creating a bootable DOS disk and delete my partitions through DOS and start again?"

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-30T20:22Z,"Mugsy, thanks for reading the comments first. I've not come across this before but I've googled it and the consensus seems to be either a damaged hard drive or a dodgy video card. You don't have a Nvidia GeForce Series 8 card by any chance do you? 

The answer seems to be the same as usual, do a fresh install. I'm guessing you have already tried that. 

One other thing to try is the boot settings. Did you happen to reorganize the boot priority when you installed from the flash drive? With installing from flash you may need to place the Flash drive (USB-FDD) as first priority to get it to boot, then place it after the HD after the first reboot to get it to boot from the HD.

With installing from disk you can leave CD/DVD as first and HD as second the whole time.

If you do not have a 3.25 floppy installed you may have to disable ""Boot from floppy"" in the Bios as well, though I only found that option only affected installing from flash drive.

Edit: there are some HD diagnostic tools out there that will help you troubleshoot your HD as well. 



For those still getting code 5 errors, are you doing a fresh install? If so, what is your current OS and what make and model is your PC? If we know a bit more Google will probably come up with an easy solution. "

Now, I only have an Issue: do I or do I not instal SP1? Is it safe (crack wise) ? Are there any tips or guide to install without losing the crack? I read some of the latest comments and it still not very clear--i appreciate.

Installing this one was easier than installing XP, especially with drivers--everything did byitself.

If you download REMOVE WAT it will get rid of the 30 days activation message. What happens after 30 days is anyone's guess. I suspect it'll be OK and if not a crack will be done within hours.

Re not picking up wireless, it sounds like you need to install the CD you got with the PC for your wireless system. If you can connect to the internet I'm sure it will automatically download them but it's getting you online first. Can you not hard wire the internet via an ethernet port from your PC to your modem just so you can use windows updates and get the drivers you need? If not, download them on a mates PC and burn to disc, USB stick."

these are the steps to do a fresh install

- select your language setting and click install now. 
- accept license terms click on next
- CLICK CUSTOM(ADVANCED)
- delete the partitions on the menu except for the built in recovery of your PC/Laptop if you have one.
- then you will see UNALLOCATED select that and click next

I am running this off my Mac so i am using bootcamp so for anyone with problems installing on a mac, I just wanna confirm it does work. First of all, you will need to download imgburn for anyone having the code 5 error, basically, there is instructions on how to do it here.

http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194&s=d886081e8a449e83e8ab73c65e9ffa77

Perfect instructions, just remember to change the sectors to 8 since it is Windows 7 and they are using Vista.

Once installed, leave the KB971033 update un-ticked (Mine was un-ticked by default) and instal the rest, unless SP1 pops up. Mine didn't come until I installed the first batch of updates. So basically, you can instal all updates apart from KB971033 and the Service Pack 1, might be a crack for it now, haven't bothered looking

If you are getting the ""cannot boot from CD: code 5, there is a way around that. 
First, change your BIOS back to boot from HARD DRIVE, then what you need to do is run the DVD while you are using Vista by going to Start > Computer > DVD Drive. Run the Installation from there (this will probably only work if you do a clean install, this will delete all of your current files)

This is a common issue with Win7 upgrade ISOs and has nothing to do with the torrent.   The fix is simple.   This works regardless if you are using Vista or XP or no OS at all.

Use Google to find a Vista Recovery boot Iso and burn this to a separate DVD.  This ISO is freely avialable so you'll have no issues finding it from proper sites.   Boot from this ( note it will take about 10 mins of screens with just a mouse curser before the drop down boxes appear). Select Recover System, then Update Drivers if it can't find a Recovery system.  This will give you a number of options, so select Command Prompt.  Swap your DVD to the Windows 7 DVD from this seed, change to the DVD drive (eg D;\) and type ""CD Sources"", then ""Setup"" (minus the """" of course).  Win7 installation will begin :-)

,Baskt_Case,2011-05-06T16:36Z,"It works, even on old ass hardware, Athlon XP with 512MB of RAM.

Code 5 means set your BIOS to boot from the DVD drive.

If you still get Code 5, its because your old ass BIOS cant boot this DVD. Its a limitation of an old BIOS. You can try updating BIOS but it probably wont work. If your BIOS is this old, any available updates probably are too.

Install it while running Windows. If you dont have Windows already, go get SmartBootManager and put it on a USB key or CD and then you can boot from DVD.

You WILL have the option to choose 32 or 64.

DO NOT input a key when asked to do so. It will take care of the rest.

DO NOT close the black command prompt window if it seems to freeze on the screen for a while.

I suggest not connecting internet during install time either.

Reboot or Insert Proper Media, or Cannot Find OS, or some other bullshit, just do yourself a favor and install this while running Windows. It will work just fine. You CAN do a fresh install, if you know how to read during the install. If you insist on doing a boot-time install and have failed thus far, well, there are other solutions above. If all else fails and you still cant figure this out, you should probably just be giving M$ your money for a legit copy cuz your too ignorant or lazy to figure out how to use this awesome free gift.

Some tips from me:

1. Do not use daemon tools or something to mount the image, you need to burn it to a dvd!

2. If you get the code 5 error: follow this tutorial : http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=11194 and try it again.

Next click the top link. You should be taken to a page with a picture of the most popular system for Vista and Windows 7, even Windows 7 Ultimate. Presently very 2.01 is newest, but it may be updated at any time. It's called the Daz Loader and most people swear buy it.

Make SURE you only use a Windows ISO from MyDigitalLife, they are clean with no back doors- Also they are traded on BitTorrent. If you use any other ISO you risk losing everything and it's not worth the risk. Daz and his pals have been developing this for well over a year and never sit still long before a new update comes out.

I've finally got SP1 and reactivated.
Magic code is actually reactivation code for this release.
""slmgr.vbs -rearm""
(I've also tried another code ""slmgr.vbs -ato"" which is not for this release tho)

: run ""cmd"" as admin : mind spaces, no quotation mark for any cmd line

For those who hvn't executed ""removeWAT"" but hv installed ""KB971033"" or ""SP1""
1. Remove the ""KB971033"" update via control panel or run this cmd line ""Wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:971033"" => Legit Microsoft Code
2. Restart
3. Run cmd line ""slmgr.vbs -rearm""

For those who've already executed ""removeWAT""
1. Locate hidden ""slmgr.vbs.removeWAT"" in \\windows\system32
2. Change filename into ""slmgr.vbs""
3. Do the KB971033 removal, reactivation as stated

Well, this is what worked for me. So I think it should work for any common situation. If it doesn't work for you then good luck with more research."

okey, so i've downloaded it and installed it. It's working pretty awesome but I found that the windows activation says 30 days to activate . Im like WTF?! I thought it's already cracked?! anyone help PLEASE"
,zakafag,2011-06-13T20:42Z,"YESSS THANK YOU VERY MUCH TOILET SNIFFER T_T OMG OMG THANK YOU!!!

ahh, windows ain't really losing money since they're so big so Idgaf lol 

for any of you guys with the activation code thingy, idk if it just fades after 30 days but I was scared so I did removeWAT. Basically removes all windows activation tools and makes it genuine hahaha thanks everyone :)

for those with a code 5 error, I did some thing which is this. THIS WORKS ALSO WHEN WINDOWS 7 INSTALLATION DOESN'T DETECT YOUR HARD DRIVE! well for me anyways...

Solution from:

http://blog.aproductofsociety.org/?p=13

Exactly this part (go into website as there is a link included for oscdimg.exe):

""
Download Vista SP1/2008 x64 ISO from MSDN, orgrab your CD
Create 3 folders c:\efi-iso c:\efi-exe c:\efi-dvd
Download oscdimg.exe from here* into c:\efi-exe
Extract iso using 7Zip or WinRAR (Or copy the contents of the DVD) into c:\efi-dvd
Start up a command prompt (Start -> Run -> cmd)
Type: cd c:\efi-exe
Type: oscdimg -n -m -bc:\efi-dvd\boot\etfsboot.com c:\efi-dvd c:\efi-iso\server2008dvd.iso""


I've googled a lot, and this one seemes to be only working solution as for now - for me it worked perfectly.

Best Regards.

NOTE: *http://blog.aproductofsociety.org/files/oscdimg.exe 

That is the *here* file where you download the oscdimg.

Basically, what I did was put the windows 7 content (the file here that you are downloading) into the c:\efi-dvd instead of the vista or whatever. Now, after you have followed the instructions, in one of the folders that you made (I think the efi-iso), there will be a RAR (THER SHOULD BE). Now you get a DVD, burn the RAR file to the dvd (suggest using x4 speed as some say to do at a lower speed rather than high speed idk why). Now that the RAR file is burnt into the dvd, that dvd is your windows 7 ultimate. Try it, any queries, personal message my account if you can in this site lol.

Thank You sniffer V, keep up the amazing work."
,4PhaseDelta,2011-07-12T08:33Z,"i see a lot of people are having trouble... i've installed this on two different computers, had no problems either time... i guess i'll just say what i did step by step...

(i have my copy of windows 7 burned onto a memorex dvd+r dl disc, idk if that makes any difference)

once you have the burnt copy, restart your system and it might go straight to the ""press any button screen"" or you might just have to hit F12 or whatever it is to get to the screen that lets you choose different boot locations.  if it says you it cant, which i dont see y it would, just let your system boot normally....

what a lot of people probably haven't tried is just going to my computer>your disc drive> and doing a simple double click...

the Windows 7 disc is already in, its being read as the Windows 7 software, just load it like you would any other disc.  

It should run you through the setup... choose which bit (64 or 86), then let it do its thing... it restarts a couple of times then gets to a point where it says its finishing up the installation (or something like that), while its doing that, the command prompt box pops up and sits there, then goes away after a lil while... tada, you have windows 7, just be patient is all i have to say.  i havent had any problems at all. i have sp1 on both of the systems, but they're still working fine (i didn't install that one update that sniffer V warned of) but he said it may be included in the SP1 update... so im just gona wait it out and see if anything happens, for now, things are working they way they've been working."

Then, after a while, in the dos window, it comes up an error: Could not find ETFSBOOT""
I'm not sure I wrote it correctly, but it's sometihng like that. Maybe another name.

After that, it says ""Installation got an error "", but as it restarted quickly I didn't get to read the whole text.

When it restarted it comes up this ""_"" in the upper left corner and it starts blinking.

Cool right:) Hope I helped someone, at least you two....."

,Spankmee,2011-07-26T08:03Z,"Oh man. This took me forever. For those of you having trouble, go to the first few pages of comments. The guides in the comments did the trick for the code 5 error. 

I don't know why TSV said this: Trusted Toilet_sniffer_V at 2011-01-06 12:36 CET:
This is 32 bit but for some reason it's called X86. X64 is 64 bit which this isn't but for some reason 32 bit is X64.

Click the x86 option when you're installing this NOT the x64. Otherwise you'll get a message during installation that Windows 7 can't be installed on your computer (You bet your ass I flipped when I read that after 3 burned DVDs, 2 days of trying, and a few tantrums).

This is one of the best torrents I've downloaded though. If you don't have a ancient ass motherboard you'll be fine lol (code 5 error). 

Thanks for the torrent, TSV!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-26T08:10Z,"This actually has both 32 Bit and 64 Bit. I didn't realise when I named the torrent. I've recently bought a new PC and I have install the 64 Bit on it and it is working perfectly.

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-07-27T07:50Z,Everyone whose system reverts back to your old OS obviously haven't done a fresh install. You probably have an update that interferes with the crack. You need to do a fresh install and not an upgrade.

No i really know that I used a full install and not the upgrade. But i fixed it know, kinda wierd.

,solo4205,2011-08-16T06:13Z,"@wally999 

You must make the flash drive bootable through the command prompt window with admin rights first, but your bios and motherboard must have the option to boot from usb. Just google ""Install Windows 7 with a flah drive. You will find all kinds of ways to do it, but I like the command prompt way the best because you don't need any special software."
,solo4205,2011-08-16T06:19Z,"@wally999 

O' and the method to make it bootable may also depend on what OS you are running at the time (2000, xp vista, etc.). Also it takes maybe half the time to install through the usb method.

On a side note this OS runs great, but it still gives me the countdown, so I suggest using zloader or something like that. Also when burnt to a dvd it would not load in my desktop. It kept giving me the ""error 5"" script, but it did fine on my laptop through the bootable usb option."

,PSP12052,2011-08-26T17:46Z,"i joined simply to ask this question and to tell my story.

i downloaded the .iso and burned it to a DVD+R and the program i used was CDBURNERXP because im on school computers. this gives me limited acess to install burn programs and i can only run apps off my flashdrive through LIBERKEy. my computer at home got a VERY bad virus that prompted a script to auto formatt my Hard drive the next time i logged on. the only reason i know this is because bootlog.txt, and the fact my computer was formatting for an hour and a half and would not let me turn it off or cancel. now when i turn it on, it sais: your system has suffered a fatal operating error. please contact your HP manufacturer for instructions and trouble shooting (CODE PURPLE).  so anyway i set my BiOS to boot from CD/DVD and it gives me the code CDBOOT:cannot boot from CD error code:5

my problem is that im trying to reinstall windows on the computer and am unable to log on at all.
help me so i can at least use it and its not sitting there a useless piece of wire and plastic yes? 

how the heck do i get the comp to boot from CD without being able to download or install any programs, as i am using a school comp? 
ANY help would be great

BTW i have a new Hp Pavillion Slimline with about a 260GB HDD (Major Gamer) and would love to use it as its the best computer ive ever owned. "

Just wanted to ask you again the same question, is there any solution to this ""driver"" issue?

It's a popup window that tell you to browse for the right drivers, you are unable to skip this step which makes it impossible for me to install w7.

To prevent a code 5 error, I would recommend following the tutorial from Imgburn (link is on page 1 or 2 of comments) to burn a bootable disc from the ISO.  Initially, I burned the ISO image file directly to disc and got the code 5 error when I booted from cd.  I also formatted the entire drive before installing which I think is why I never had any issues with activation.  It is also important to disable windows from downloading and installing updates automatically that way you can hand select the ones you want(not KB971033).

My only question is, and again -- thank you, is there any difference between an installation that is deemed activated vs. one that isn't, but is operable by means of RemoveWAT? I can't help but feel a bit more confident about the installation that has that pretty Microsoft star on it.

I have read every comment on this torrent and I have not seemed to come across anyone with this same issue. Is my download corrupted or something? I am running a windows xp. Thanks!  "
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-12-24T02:53Z,"I'm assuming the invalid .ini file comes up before you get the option for a fresh install. I've not come across this before but I've just googled and I've come across this. BTW Google is a great way of sorting problems out, someone somewhere will have had the same problem as you.



One of the most common issues is Invalid boot.ini file.

This error usually occurs on Windows XP startup with the following error messages:

Invalid Boot.ini

Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

or

WindowsSystem32Hal.dll

The cause for this issue is usually if the boot.ini file is missing, damaged, or contains incorrect entries.
Usually Default boot.ini file looks like this:

[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)WINDOWS=""M icrosoft Windows XP Professional"" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect

OS affected with this problem are Windows XP Professional and Windows XP Home.


Resolution for the problem


Resolution for this problem is not difficult, but for those who face this problem for the first time, it can cause a headache.

To resolve this issue, first start the computer from the Windows XP CD. Then, start the Recovery Console, and then use the Bootcfg.exe tool to rebuild the Boot.ini file.

To perform recovery, follow these steps:

1. Configure the computer to start from the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive. For information about how to do this, see your computer documentation, or contact your computer manufacturer.

2. Insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into your CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive, and then restart your computer.

3. When you receive the â€œPress any key to boot from CDâ€ message, press a key to start your computer from the Windows XP CD-ROM.

4. When you receive the â€œWelcome to Setupâ€ message, press R to start the Recovery Console.

5. If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the installation that you have to use from the Recovery Console.

6. When you are prompted, type the administrator password, and then press ENTER.

7. In the command prompt, type bootcfg /list, and then press ENTER. The entries in your current Boot.ini file appear on the screen.

8. In the command prompt, type bootcfg /rebuild, and then press ENTER. This command scans the hard disks of the computer for Windows XP, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft Windows NT installations, and then displays the results.

Follow the instructions that appear on the screen to add the Windows installations to the Boot.ini file. For example, follow these steps to add a Windows XP installation to the Boot.ini file:

a) When you receive a message that is similar to the following message, press Y:

Total Identified Windows Installs: 1

[1] C:Windows
Add installation to boot list? (Yes/No/All)


b) You receive a message that is similar to the following message:

Enter Load Identifier

This is the name of the operating system. When you receive this message, type the name of your operating system, and then press ENTER. This is either Microsoft Windows XP Professional or Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition.


c) You receive a message that is similar to the following:

Enter OS Load options

When you receive this message, type /fastdetect, and then press ENTER.

* Note that the instructions that appear on your screen may be different, depending on the configuration of your computer.


9. Type exit, and then press ENTER to quit Recovery Console. Your computer restarts, and the updated boot list appears when you receive the â€œPlease select the operating system to startâ€ message."

,bonkai,2012-03-01T01:03Z,"Will this boot from a flash drive or just CD/DVD drive? 

I did download Team MJR's version is this the same one, as it looks like to be the same size, the reason I ask is that I'm having a problem installing their version from USB."
,bonkai,2012-03-01T20:40Z,"Right, I managed to put this version on to a bootable flash drive with Wintoflash and all went well. 

I rebooted went into BIOS and selected the usb to boot from, all was going ok, I got to the point where you select what region your from and then I got a pop up window saying 

 ""A Required CD/DVD drive device is missing. If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD or USB flash drive, please insert now.

Now I have Googled this problem and what rectifys this is just changing USB por which doesn't work for me.

This is the second time I've downloaded Windows 7 which hasn't worked. 

I'm using Windows Vista 32  bit atm and I'm at my wits end of what to do next. like I said I have googled this problem and tried to sort it out so  this is the last resort!

Are these versions of Windows 7 not USB bootable?

Any suggestions would be most appreciated."
,future99,2012-03-03T04:09Z,"@Toilet Sniffer V ...Thanks for the application. I had Vista in my laptop, removed it and did fresh installation of Windows 7  Ultimate. I have also installed it in 3 more computers of my friends. 

I have used it for almost a year now. And hadn't faced any problem so far. I could even update and everything worked perfectly.Thanks to you.

I ran windows update couple of days earlier. It updated most of it....but failed to update the Windows 7 Service Pack (KB 976932). I tried it many times, but keep getting this message.
Error 80004005. 

I would be very grateful if you could tell me how to fix this problem.

Thanks a lot for the application"
,TheJoesif,2012-03-04T12:44Z,"Hey Toilet, I downloaded and installed this about 3 weeks ago and it's worked immaculate up to now, last night I fell asleep with the computer running and it must of done an update and restarted. I have let it do this before and there hasn't been a problem. But when I woke up looked at the screen I saw the dreaded message ""Windows did not pass genuine validation."" and now my home screen is watermarked. Is there anything I can do that can ""activate"" it again?"
