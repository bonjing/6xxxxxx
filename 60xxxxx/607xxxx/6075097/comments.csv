The film's start is cut out, the hiss is louder than the actual audio by a lot, the image is cropped and tiny - and I think this was taped off of Chinese TV or something(analogue), and the TV reception was extremely bad. 
It is utterly unwatchable , even for those who couldn't care less about quality."
