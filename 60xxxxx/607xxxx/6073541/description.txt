New features
Acronis Backup & Recovery Online

The Acronis Backup & Recovery Online service extends the data and system protection functionality of the Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 product to an online software-as-a-service model. Acronis Backup & Recovery Online provides an online, remote secure location for users to store redundant copies of their files, applications and system image backups without having to make the investment in a remote data store. Here is the list of benefits:

Secure offsite data protection and backup of workstations, servers and virtual machines 
Support for file/folder and entire system image backup and recovery 
Support of virtual machines backup to the online storage 
Integrated solution for local and online backup when used with an Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 license

Government-approved AES-256 encryption 
Centralized management and control of your backup policies and schedules for all machines 
EXT4 file system support

Ext4 file system is now supported. Ext4 or fourth extended file system is a journaling file system for Linux. It is possible to back up and recover this file system with Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 now.

Simplified naming of backup files

Now it is possible to name the backups with the archive name for creation of a portable machine on a detachable media or moving the backups to a different location by using scripting. The file name of the first (full) backup in the archive will consist of the archive name. The file names of subsequent (incremental or differential) backups will have an index.

Smart Error Reporting in Installer

If an error occurs during Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 installation there will be provided a link to the Acronis Knowledge Base Web page that contains possible solutions to fix the error, or to a general Knowledge Base page where the user can search for a solution manually if there is no article for this error yet.

Integration with Acronis Drive Monitor

The new scheduling option is now available: start backup as soon as disk health reaches a warning level or a critical level. The hard disk health information is reported by Acronis Drive Monitor which utilizes a hard disk.s internal monitoring system (S.M.A.R.T.). The option is effective only if Acronis Drive Monitor is installed.

Web Help

The Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 help system, available in the product by pressing F1, is now also available on Acronis Web site at http://www.acronis.com/support/documentation/ABR10. Or you can follow the "Web Help" links on the product Web pages.

Support for Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) environments

Virtual machines in KVM and RHEV environments are supported by Acronis Backup & Recovery 10. When the Agent is installed, the virtual machine in a KVM or RHEV environment will be seen in AMS as a physical machine.

Known issues
This section describes issues that are currently known and provides workarounds or advice on how to avoid the issues.

When updating to the new build using Group Policy, you need to create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) instead of using the "redeploy" option for the GPO created for installations of previous versions. 
When upgrading a build of Acronis True Image Echo Backup Server earlier than 8163 to Acronis Backup & Recovery 10 Storage Node, it is recommended that the Acronis Backup Server service is stopped during the upgrade; otherwise the locations may not be imported correctly.

Information for Virtual Edition users
Updating from build 11345

To update from build 11345 to build 12497, you have to remove virtual appliances and deploy new ones, particularly because of the addition of cluster support. (See below the outline of the update procedure.) After that, you will be able to perform updates from the management server in the same way as deployment.

To update Agent for ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliance:

Update the management server. 
Remove the virtual appliance from the management server. 
Delete the virtual appliance from its host. 
Revoke the license used by the agent. 
Deploy the agent anew from the management server (one agent per cluster). 
Reapply backup policies if required. 
More details of the update procedure can be found in the product help system and the Virtual Edition Installation Guide (search for "Updating ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliance", see "Manual update" in this section).

An alternative method of backing up a cluster

Backup of all virtual machines of a cluster with a single Agent for ESX/ESXi may take a significant amount of time. If length of the backup window is important, try the following workaround.

Deploy Agent for ESX/ESXi to each clustered host instead of deploying a single agent to the cluster. You can do so from the management server. Just right-click the Virtual machines item instead of the vCenter group. 
If VMware DRS is enabled in the cluster, disable automatic migration of Agent for ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliances. You also should not migrate them manually to different hosts, in order to avoid the situation when an agent manages a host other than its own. Backup and recovery performance would considerably degrade in that case. 
Create a dynamic group of virtual machines hosted on the clustered hosts. Use the Host/VA criterion for the group. 
Create a backup policy and apply the policy to the dynamic group. Once a virtual machine migrates to a different host, the management server will deploy a backup task for this machine to the agent that manages that host.
