,Bloho_Jo,2011-01-22T15:05Z,Have been looking for Advanced version of these products for almost a year now. Don't understand why no one is releasing them.
,sysop1101,2011-02-04T22:03Z,"bloho, its because Acronis software is INSANELY expensive. Shit it $1000 just for the Standard edition and let's be honest the software is OKAY at best. I can't see an enterprise spending several thousand on Acronis Advanced Server considering how flaky the software is. "
,ngapuhi2,2011-03-05T06:52Z,Installed on xp work station and sbs 2003 server algud Ohh Nikita you will never know. Elton John thanx u  
,john212,2011-03-12T00:39Z,Does anyone have the agent keys for this so they can be managed from the main console?
,ReiFukai,2011-05-03T20:18Z,"yeah all these work great, but if you need to set this up in a network enviorment with more than one system to backup you need to use the remote management console and this option does not seem to be cracked. In version 9.x it was separate from the license manager part of acronis so this feature worked on the cracked version of 9.x.

If anyone knows how to get around this please do tell!
