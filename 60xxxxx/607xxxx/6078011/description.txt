Aisha is a girl with a simple diktat - everyone
business is her business. Arjun is a boy with  
even a simpler set of beliefs - Aisha should   
mind her own business. Caught in the Delhi     
upper class world with its own set of social   
rules, Aisha navigates her world with a great  
sense of style and even greater optimism.      
Aisha will make sure everyone dances to her    
tune. And all Arjun wants to do is disentangle 
that web and get Aisha out of an impending     
sticky mess.
