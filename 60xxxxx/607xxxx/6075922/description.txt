The basis of the game is a team of human marines fighting alien spiders in a wide array of scenarios, usually in dark settings. Each side has 8 classes including a builder class that is able to set up base defences and team spawn points. Every time you kill an enemy you get frags to \'spend\' on a better class. Spider classes range from the lowly 20 health but deadly hatchling to the monolithic stalker that obliterates everything it its path. Humans start out as a grunt and can work their way up to a mechanized unit with dual autocannons. Gloom features all-custom models, maps, sounds and gameplay. This won\'t feel like the Quake II you are used to.

tl;dr awesome fast paced FPS game that\'s more than mindless point and shoot but uses strategy.  Let\'s get some good 40 player games going again!
