,drag0n229,2011-01-04T14:08Z,"There's one confussing screen during the installation process asking for serial key..don't enter any key, jst move through the installation and then use the patch provided.

Thanks ThumperTM.!.worked perfectly"
,nonhocapito,2011-01-12T06:50Z,"Thumper, you are a joke.

This is no way to pack software. Piracy means first and foremost transparency.

Password protected pack = very wrong. What would be the purpose of this? Hiding from me the stupid icons you use?

No instructions = wrong
Donate button = wrong
All-automated patch process = very wrong

WE ARE NOT CHILDREN.

It took us a long way to get rid of the no-question asked installation procedures of MS back in the day. 

You have no clue.

If you wanna distribute software, pack the damn thing in a rar file so that I know what's in it and what I am clicking on."
,theRealKarmine,2011-01-15T23:57Z,pirates....asking for donations?  go fuck yourself.
,manu9982401984,2011-01-27T08:52Z,"It's AWESOME

,iSpyder,2011-02-10T12:13Z,"seriously guys, just open your temp directory.

,IWalkAlone247,2011-02-18T23:12Z,"@nonhocapito

Seriously, dude....give Thumper a break....

From what I've been reading, this thing seems to work, unlike damn near every other Diskeeper version uploaded on TPB. Now, I haven't tried it yet, but I'm about to, then I'll give my own feedback....but if this thing works like everybody else says it does, ease up off the guy...."
,IMUSA73,2011-02-19T17:55Z,"Nice work.. not complaining... scans fine on MS security essentials and installs awesomely... I don't see why the ruckus has to be made... evidentally dude complaining about the way this was packed into one .bin and automated instead of an extracted crack.... if it works...thats the key.. If you knew anything about the interests of releasing something to the scene you would know that pirates have their own styles of presenting their cracks... look at Razor1911 they been doing it sort of like Thumper did for years starting with the c64 days...so that tells you how far back I been in the scene... so speak for yourself....nice work Thumper! (but seriously, Thumper are you a chick? The name is sorta feminine (justkidding))"
,IWalkAlone247,2011-02-22T22:22Z,"Okay....I've had it installed since commenting...

So far, so good...but I only have one question...

I had to go through the free trial option in order to finish installing. I did the patch thing also...will I end up getting hit with that expiration crap and have to uninstall this thing eventually when the free trial runs out....or will the patch prevent that from happening?

Can someone let me know...

Thanx"
,IWalkAlone247,2011-03-11T07:26Z,"Okay...I'm having a problem...

Mine stopped working anymore. Just about every option is grayed out. It was working fine at first, but then I left it alone for a couple weeks and now it's not running at all...

Please help!!"
,alexstron,2011-03-17T17:36Z,superb
,svadilfari,2011-03-19T20:21Z,no instructions no nothin...for the love of fuck 
,Renodil,2011-05-18T07:29Z,What patch? The only files that came with this bloody thing is [INFO].txt the installer and a link to more downloads.
,Renodil,2011-05-18T07:38Z,"Um, never mind. I just noticed the patching options in the launcher. Boy do I feel stupid right now. :embarrassed:"
