From the Infowars web site ::

Alex welcomes back to the show Charlotte Iserbyt, author of The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, a chronological history of the past 100+ years of education reform. Iserbyt served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration. On today's show, she talks with Alex about the secret society of the elite, Skull & Bones. Iserbyt provided author and researcher Antony Sutton with the documentation he needed to write America's Secret Establishment: An Introduction to the Order of Skull & Bones. Iserbyt's father and grandfather were members of the cult. "These secret societies are behind it all," her father told her.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
