Part 4. A Good Christmas
Thirty-five years after sitcom the Good Life first aired, writer Giles Coren and comedian Sue Perkins step back to 1975 to try to learn some self-sufficient skills and techniques. It's the season to be jolly, but is it really possible to enjoy Christmas when you're strapped for cash? Giles and Sue set out to prove that by using a few old fashioned handicrafts and an awful lot of enthusiasm, you can still put the merry into Christmas. They begin by making some very rudimentary home-made decorations and Peter Purves shows how to assemble the famous Blue Peter advent crown. And as they haven't got any cash, Sue joins a local knitting circle and knits Giles a very festive 70s inspired Christmas jumper.
