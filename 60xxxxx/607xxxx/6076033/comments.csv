,acky252,2011-01-01T21:27Z,Whats the quality like people?
,AC_Bandit,2011-01-02T02:25Z,quality???
,doodad,2011-01-02T03:25Z,"The subtitles are in Russian, not English, ergo, unless you speak Italian or read Russian, some of the movie is lost on you. I d/l'd using the magnet link, which only gave me the movie file and not the other 2, so I'll d/l the 1st file in hopes that it's a subtitle file. Oh, A: 8, V: 9. Good upload, partner."
,doodad,2011-01-02T03:31Z,"OK, neither of the other files are subs, so hopefully I can learn working Italian with Rosetta Stone before I watch. That or immerse myself in Cryllic Russian."
