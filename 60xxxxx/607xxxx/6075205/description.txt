Jesus Culture We Cry Out 2007 DVDRip [avi format]

"The testimonies that have come as a result of We Cry Out are staggering. We have received reports of 
people getting saved watching the DVD, people encountering God in a fresh way, people who every morning
 put the CD on and just weep. Our heart was the same on this CD as our previous CD called Everything. 
We wanted to capture the live worship experience happening at our Jesus Culture conferences and release the same encounter. 
We also added a DVD so people could join in the live worship in a new way. Kim Walker, Chris Quiala, and Melissa How do an 
incredible job as they usher this new breed of revivalists into the presence of God."
