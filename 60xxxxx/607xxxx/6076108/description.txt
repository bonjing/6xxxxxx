Wildboyz is a spin-off and follow-up to Jackass, which debuted in 2003 on MTV and moved to MTV2 in its third season. Steve-O and Chris Pontius are the stars of the show, who perform stunts and acts with animals, often putting themselves in situations for which they are not trained. The two are both former stuntmen who were in the hit movies, Jackass: The Movie and Jackass Number Two . They travel to different parts of the globe, performing their stunts in exotic environments while educating their audience on wildlife and local culture. Season 4, the show's final season, made its debut on January 6, 2006, at 9 pm EST as a part of Sic 'Em Fridays on MTV2.

The show ended in 2006, after 4 seasons. The reason for not making a fifth season came after the death of Steve Irwin, on which Pontius and Steve-O commented, saying "If this could happen to him, and he's a professional, we've got to look out for our own safety." Though only 32 episodes were produced, the show easily outran Jackass.
