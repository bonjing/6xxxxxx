 People have a lot of strange ideas about the blues--Believe it or not, there are quite a few folks out there who actually think that Keb Mo' is the real deal! Serious fans of this often misunderstood art form probably already know that Yank Rachell is one of the great unsung heroes of the blues. This collection of his work ranks among the very best of hardcore acoustic blues recordings, bar none. Mandolin, guitar, and harmonica wail as if with one voice, and what an intensely satisfying voice it is! Rachell and his small band evoke both the joy and the pain of human experience, often at the very same moment in a single heartfelt tune. The music is somewhat reminiscent of the pre-electrified Muddy Waters, before his country roots began fading under the harsh lights of Chicago sophistication. For blues fans who are chiefly familiar with the Mississippi styles of Robert Johnson and his followers, the Tennessee-rooted sound of Yank Rachell will come as a breath of fresh air. I like this album a lot better than most of what I've heard of Rachell's recordings with Sleepy John Estes. If you care at all about country blues, you can't go wrong with this one!
