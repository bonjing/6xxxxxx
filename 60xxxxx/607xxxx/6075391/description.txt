To burn a disc by virtue of JetBee simply add files to the required project (Data disc, Audio disc, DVD disc, UDF disc), press 'Burn' button and you'll get a recorded disc with photos, music, video, data or bootable disc of your choice in a few minutes. You can easily burn an iso image, copy disc or save disc image to burn it later, to create an iso image from your files and many more. JetBee supports all popular disc burning devices: CD burners, DVD burners, Blu-Ray burners and HD-DVD burners.

All above is easy to make. It's really worth trying.

JetBee is fully identical in the terms of functionality to Evolution apart from skin support.

NB: Many users are not for software with skin support â€“ JetBee has been done exactly for them.

JetBee FREE â€“ JetBee freeware. But it has some limited functionality (there is not Extras menu, Advanced options, etc.). No technical support and future upgrades are provided either.
