,tonythomson,2011-02-22T03:58Z,Great upload. Can anyone tell me how to change the file format. having problems on WD HDD player . Know it's simple but i just can't figure it. Much appreciated.  
,testor1140,2011-03-13T11:20Z,"Thanks for the upload, however:
110-120MB for a half hour episode is too small.
The video is way too blurry and is, for me, unwatchable."
,c3bhm,2011-04-07T09:19Z,"The quality of a lot of these is all over the place.  Some of them are atrociously poor, where the macroblocking is really distracting.  Small file sizes, which is nice, but with some of them it's just not worth it.  If you're a real fan, maybe look elsewhere..."
,CamTron118,2011-05-21T06:03Z,"a lot of good material on here, but the videos are all taken from other sources, and some are good, but some are extremely compressed and hardly even watchable. Great show, but the quality of this download is not."
,cortez_the_killer,2011-05-29T09:20Z,Thanks YIFY for this. The tagline you put is wrong however it's actually for the show Scrubs.
,handegg,2011-06-05T20:20Z,"Extremely poor quality, honestly the worst i have ever seen, thanks for uploading, but this torrent is a complete waste of everyones time and bandwidth, don't bother with it"
,JASP3R77,2011-10-30T08:23Z,THANKS

,conroach420,2012-01-29T21:38Z,"YIFY what is going on with this download, I hate to speak ill of your work but this is low quality.Your weeds download is great. Is it just my copy thats like this??? this is the funniest show in the world i need good quality"
,Sanyi001,2012-03-23T23:40Z,"Quality: -156 
:O"
,Sanyi001,2012-03-24T03:29Z,the weird thing is that some episodes have terrible quality but only at the beginning and only for a minute or two. Then it's totally fine. But I've only watched season 1 and half way thru season 2
