 Album Info..: 
 
 If you are a fan of AC/DC then you simply have to own 'Jailbreak'. Sure it's short in length, but it is so full of good music that what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. The song 'Jailbreak' is AC/DC at it's best with Bon Scott's unique and edgy vocals. Angus Young's guitar work is phenominal. 'You Aint' Got A Hold on Me' shows where the band is heading with a more melodic rhythm and catchy chorus, and 'Soul Stripper' shows where the band came from, with a really great blues vocal by Bon. Another highlight of 'Jailbreak' is the cover of Them/Van Morrison's tune 'Baby Please Don't Go'. The instantly recognizable guitar hook is great, and AC/DC takes this classic and makes it their own.
