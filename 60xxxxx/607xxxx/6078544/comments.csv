TRY THIS -
IF u already have a activated version installed
go to this link 
http://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=68564.0


and just do a update.... it works!
its the update to the same version!!"
,Jigjin,2011-01-06T10:27Z,"Hi locobot, 

I am also facing the same error as mentioned by TheAslan and sam1483. I have read your reply as well. Previously i have IS v5.0.677 cracked by ashBase.dll upto 2025. So is it possible for me to update from the link given by you ?? 

By the way, in my pc, the cracked AshBase.dll you have given is showing it is for the previous version 5.0.677. How? "

,Jigjin,2011-01-07T16:05Z,"Locobot,

Thank you for your quick reply. The licence key, you have posted above is for pro version not for internet security version. It turned the internet security version into pro version. 

You are really quick to release the 5.1.874 beta. But i dont install the beta version of any programme as i had really bad experience with beta version, in past. :( 

Pls keep up the good job and provide the valid dll or licence key for internet security version 5.1.864. 
Thank you."
,Jigjin,2011-01-07T20:36Z,"Locobot,

Finally it is working. I have tried the licence key from the v5.1.874 beta from the above given link. :) And it is working fine. :)

Big Thank you. :)"
[T],locobot12,2011-01-07T22:10Z,"@jigjin

I'm glad it worked :)

i gave the pro license because i thought u installed pro antivirus!!

anyways everything is good : )
peace!"
,kasumitkhs,2011-01-12T05:52Z,"@sam1483
I'm having the same error as you with that weird error. It happens after I replace the ashBase.dll and then start the program.

Also, the instructions seem to be in Russian?"
