The other is in ""Tweak z28_v.02"" - TrojanDropper:Win32/Dunik!rts. Although this can be because these are crack files, I'm still a little supicious about this one as I've got no confirmation that they're not real viruses."

,EAbakkken,2011-05-31T20:20Z,they are not virues i got a LFS with a keygen and its the Anti virus that are just stupid because i had it  there for a year nothing happend
,Scotara,2011-06-03T12:50Z,Maybe it stole all of your login info?
,ada357345,2011-07-01T18:30Z,Keygen is fake!
,Direz11,2011-08-15T19:09Z,Keygen is working only in Z28 version. Antiviruses report trojan because these programes are editing LFS memory.
,hiiman1234,2012-06-07T17:52Z,"@MikeJK Some antivirus programs say those are viruses because you can change values from this game. Pretty much they are same as cheat engine, but just in simplified way."
