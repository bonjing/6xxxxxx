,pixart8,2012-01-15T16:56Z,"it is disappointing...some episodes go black half way and some lose audio near the end of episodes. YIFY, if you can fix it please do. I am a fan of your uploads and deleted my previous collection of scrubs to save space (filesize 175mb for each episode)."
,Joycedebs95,2012-04-16T17:22Z,THANK U SO MUCH YIFY! for uploading this and How I met Your Mother!!!
,JustSven,2012-05-03T22:55Z,"This looks pretty promising, thanks alot. I'll comment again in a few days once it's done downloading to tell you all how they are."
,zTenCh,2012-06-28T21:34Z,"I thought it looked promising too, but then the flaws appeared, one after the other.

Seasons 6-8 (haven't gotten to 9 yet) only have audio and several other random episodes had the CAVISTREAM-watermark or other issues (ex. loss of video halfway through, as mentioned by other users).

Dear sir, get your act together.



Sincerely,
Martin"
