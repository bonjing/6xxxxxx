Storyline: 

Flashbacks throughout the film show Derek's transformation into a vengeful white supremacist in Venice Beach. Having already been influenced by his firefighter father's latent racism, Derek is driven to action when his father is shot and killed while fighting a fire in a suspected Compton drug den. Eventually Derek becomes second-in-command of a neo-Nazi street gang, The D.O.C., and entices young whites to join. The gang commits acts of intimidation, such as damaging a store owned by a Korean and challenging black players to basketball games to win the court as turf. These incidents go unnoticed by the family until Derek has an argument (involving Rodney King) with his mother's friend Murray who is Jewish. Later that night while Derek is having sex with his girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk), Danny informs Derek that three black men are attempting to steal Derek's dad's truck. Derek runs outside and shoots at the two of the men with a pistol, killing the first one instantly who he shoots in the chest. The second man, one of the black basketball players, Derek shoots and wounds and a mad Derek vows to "teach him a lesson" for trying to steal the truck his father gave him and forces him to put his mouth on the curb, then brutally kills him with a curb-stomp. Danny watches in horror as this unfolds. The police arrest Derek as he smiles at a shocked Danny.
