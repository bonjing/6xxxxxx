This is full of books for studying English as a Second Language (ESL).
I recommend NOT downloading the whole package, but selecting the books you desire as some books have two versions: A complete PDF (of higher quality, potentially for printing), and one that is OCRed (but not proofread, hence "UNEDITED"). 


*ESL Activities and Mini-Books for Young Children UNEDITED.pdf
	OCRed. Title says it all.
*ESL Azar Basic Complete.pdf
ESL Basic English Grammar Azar UNEDITED.pdf
	Both non-OCRed and OCRed. Great basic reference grammar book with exercises.
*ESL Developing Baseline Communication Skills UNEDITED.pdf
	OCRed:
	"Baseline Assessments are now mandatory for all children entering reception 
classes in state schools. The assessments look at the child's personal and social 
development, his language skills, and his readiness for reading and writing. A 
child may be graded from Level I to Level IV in any of the identified developmental 
or skill areas, with Level IV representing the point at which the child is deemed 
ready to embark on the formal education of Key Stage I. "

I will not be able to seed forever (only for the next month or so and periodically afterwards) as I will soon have no more internet, so if you like things here please seed.
