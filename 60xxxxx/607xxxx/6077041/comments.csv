,theheat,2011-01-01T23:26Z,thanx but how bout something like 1.4 gig? thanx again!
,Bytemania,2011-01-01T23:50Z,Can you please upload a torrent that is smaller in size? Thanks
,Fartalot,2011-01-02T00:17Z,"@ theheat  : It's a 4-5 hour event, so it won't ever fit on 1.4GB, you can forget that. But around 4GB is reasonable, I think."
,Bytemania,2011-01-02T00:23Z,seed :))
,samg001,2011-01-02T01:30Z,"I want this. It was advertised as being on a day later than it was broadcast FML.

Will Seed."
,theheat,2011-01-02T01:48Z,"you are right 1.4 is too low, but i think 2 GB is what these events usually come in."
,ocamocam,2011-01-02T04:16Z, 3.7426 GB :)
,sybex2010,2011-01-02T11:23Z,the length of this event is 6hrs and 29min...hence the size
,Fartalot,2011-01-02T11:47Z,"Check this:
