I had some HD issues and lost this from my collection, after searching around the iNet with absolutely no luck i decided this must be pretty rare. I found the original i tucked away in a box and re digitalized it all.  ***iTunes and iPhone ready!!!***

I got this years ago from a concert (i think it was snoop but not sure)

Rare Mix Album also included Video with sticker on it that states (including typo): 

\\\"Bonus DVD Unleased Tour, Videos, Interviews, Performances & News That Deathrow Didn\\\'t Want You To See!!!\\\"

Not the greatest album but its Tupac, its rare and it included the dvd so i hope you enjoy!!
