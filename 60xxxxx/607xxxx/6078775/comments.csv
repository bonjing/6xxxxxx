,lydonit13,2011-01-25T16:42Z,How's the quality on this?  Nine hours of video seems like a lot for a single layer DVD.
,lydonit13,2011-01-26T16:59Z,"I'll answer my own question:
Nine hours would be a lot for DVD-Video, however this download is XviD/MP3.  Quality is great.
624x352, 16:9 resolution, at about 1000Kbps
VBR audio at about 136Kbps"

,Bobthedeadly,2011-04-03T19:40Z,"Great upload. Only problem is that the sixth episode of the series is marked as the second episode. Rename ep 2 to ep 6, and ep 3 to 2, 4 to 3, 5 to 4, and 6 to 5 and then they will all be named correctly. Good quality, fast download. Will seed this one for awhile."

,Kishi,2011-12-23T00:00Z,"I cant calibrate any subtitles to match these videos at first start with -2 secs of delay, around 15min -4 secs and in the end -10secs. Anyone had any luck finding subs? i've already tried changing the subs fps but its still the same."
