INXS - This Time [promo].VOB



Very HQ rare promo music video. "This Time" is a song from Listen Like Thieves, the fifth album by the Australian rock band INXS. It was released in 1985. Considered a breakthrough album for the band, it featured their first top 5 single in the United States, "What You Need." This album also marks their alliance with Chris Thomas, who would produce the band's most successful albums.

The band had perfected a matured sound influenced by Led Zeppelin and XTC, but true to the band's original roots in the Aussie pubs. Listen Like Thieves was highly approved of by critics. In the US this first single, "This Time", stalled at #81 in late 1985, but the band roared out of nowhere with the second, "What You Need", which in early 1986 became a Top-Five Billboard hit, bringing INXS their first breakout U.S. success.
