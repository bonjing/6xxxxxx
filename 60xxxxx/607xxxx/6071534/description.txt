LPs:
 I Don't Remember Now (1979-80)
 Plaster Falling (1981)
 Pop Surgery (1983)

Cassettes:
 Packing List (1983)
 Do the C.A.G.E. (1982)
 At the 4th Street C.A.G.E.(1982)
 Plaster Prototypes (1982)

Includes sleeves and labels.

These are mostly the same files as in my separate Bender torrents. If you've already downloaded one or more of them, there's no point in downloading the tracks again from this seed. Plaster Falling is an exception to that rule, this torrent contains the complete album instead of just 5 tracks.

Enjoy.
