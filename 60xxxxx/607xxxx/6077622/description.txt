She's a rich and refined pairs figure skater whose prima donna attitude has her skating solo. He's a brash, blue-collar hockey champion with a new injury and no future. With nothing in common but their dream of reaching the Olympics, Kate and Doug are each other's last resort. Reluctantly, they join forces, but its not long before the barbs - and sparks - start flying as the unlikely pair skate towards the opportunity of a lifetime: a chance at a medal... and a chance at love.
