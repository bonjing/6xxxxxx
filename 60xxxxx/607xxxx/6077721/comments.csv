GAY PORN!"
,jellax75,2011-01-02T17:07Z,Whats the password?
,ahabdc,2011-01-02T18:02Z,"IT'S A SCAM.  you have to go to some BS website that requires your registration on 100 ""free i-pad""-type links.  FUCK YOU AND YOUR FINALS, LOSER."
,jcrboy,2011-01-02T18:55Z,It's just an AVI file. I've never seen a video file pw protected... you guys are so full of shit... XD
,jellax75,2011-01-02T19:28Z,"LOOK OUT.
The rars ar passwordprotected an the upper insists that you go to specific websites to get a password mailed to you. It is a SCAM to drive traffic to affiliatesites. The upper makes money on FOOLING us."
,JohnHolmesII,2011-01-02T19:41Z,Look Out! I'm from Zuffa and I want to drive newfags away from downloading this! I make up bullshit about passwords and rar files needing a password WHEN THERE IS NO RAR FILE.

I'll comment on the quality once I've finished."
,jcrboy,2011-01-02T22:20Z,"Quality is exactly what you'd expect from a good quality rip. Enjoy the first great fight card of the new year ^_^

Ignore the haters, this isn't a pw-protected rar (which should be obvious from looking at the file manifest)."
,JohnHolmesII,2011-01-02T22:53Z,"I must say that the fight between Gray and Frankie is one of the greatest fights I have ever seen, Frankie's heart is unmatched by anything I have ever seen. The outcome sucks though, I mean wtf were the judges thinking..."

,rampage1875,2011-01-03T02:48Z,"Watching the event now and its perfect not a bad thing to say at all, audio and video are spot on took me a while to dl but i think thats coz there wasnt enough seeders at the time but went ok near the end, but i suppose u cant moan at 200k but thats ok really but apart from that all is good.

,ahabdc,2011-01-03T11:20Z,"do yourselves a favor: if you download this tripe and unzip it -- all you have to do is look at the file type to see that it's a rar -- update your virus scanner shortly thereafter.
this is a bogus file.  there are other ufc125s that work on the bay... this just aint one of em.  "
