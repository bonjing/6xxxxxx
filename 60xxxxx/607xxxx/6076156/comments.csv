http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5291646/Windows_7_All_Editions_-_Activated_x32x64_January_2010%5B_kk_%5D#filelistContainer

When I viewed the jpg link in the details, it seems so ""Windows 7 HomeBasic Activated by orbit30.
I have the same disc which was the ISO I downloaded from Kentucky-kid.
Anyway on some machines when i try to install, when copying windows files, it gives me an error, ""windows has a problem communicating with a device in your system, blah bah blah, remove it and something like that"".
Do you have any idea why it does give me such errors when it installs fine on other machines.

Also after installation and it's booting to the desktop for the first time, it does give an error like this ""interactive login process failed"" then it will restart and come back to normal. Sometimes it won't even come to desktop then BSOD and then restarts again.
This happened to me on an HP Probook 4520s which a friend of mine bought (brand new from the store but I was wondering why it had Linux pre-installed on and with SUSE Linux enterprise edition logo on the laptop when on the Hp website, it's Windows 7 Professional 32bit with windows 7 logo on the laptop."
[V],DibyaTPB,2011-01-01T16:32Z,The thing lies in ur hardware... Some cracks and activators do not work with ur system... In case its not workin i wud advise u to get a clean version and use a loader.. D same problem happened with me when i used the bruteforce activator in my XFX motherboard. I was also worried then... In case its not workin get a untouched version.
,principlemajor,2011-01-01T22:30Z,"Alright, thanks so much DibyaTPB.
It's great hearing from you about the system error problems.

Anyway do you have any Windows 7 (all editions), both 32 and 64bit recommendation for me to download? I need an untouched one. Probably retail edition."
