      River Cottage welcomes the festive season with a Christmas
      Fayre as Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and his team offer up their
      secrets on how to enjoy the perfect Christmas holiday. Santa
      Claus and the Snow Queen will be there, as, of course, will all
      the favourite River Cottage regulars, including Hugh, his chefs
      Tim and Gill, preserves queen, Pam Corbin, and foraging expert
      John Wright. But the food will very much be the star of the
      show. In an evening of traditional festive British foods, look
      out for deliciously different ways to stuff a roast goose; a
      trio of recipes for that wonderful winter root celeriac; Hugh's
      take on a sweet chutney; luxuriously rich Christmas bread; and
      tips for how to fill the perfect hamper with hand made edible
      goodies. They also share their road-tested hangover cures to aid
      the inevitable morning after the night before of pure
      indulgence. The River Cottage team also create their own version
      of a wonderful Christmas grotto, minus the seemingly obligatory
      piece of tinsel, and make their own brand of Christmas crackers.
