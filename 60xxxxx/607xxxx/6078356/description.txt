
All fading and echo effects are used in an organic fashion to accentuate the infectious rhythms; the mixing evolves throughout the pieces to literally form songs. An African feel within the fluidity of the CRY TUFF tracks is reflected in the titles themselves. Among the bonus tracks are three vocal numbers, including "Jah Do That," which is one of Prince Far I's mightiest deliveries--militant, and inspirational.

DUBWISE features the entirety of the original CRY TUFF DUB ENCOUNTER PART 2, with the bountiful addition of eight bonus tracks. Prince Far I's dub productions here, with the Revolutionaries laying the rhythms, are among the most satisfying of the genre.

Personnel: Prince Far I (vocals, percussion); Chinna As Melchezink (guitar); Dirty Harry Hall, Do Drummond Jr. (horns); Tarzan, Snappy, Bobby Kalphat (keyboards); Santa, Sly Dunbar (drums); Bongo Herman (percussion).
