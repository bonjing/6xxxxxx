Matrix Code Emulator is a screensaver based on the Matrix trilogy films. It resembles the green code seen on the computer screens in the movies. You can watch the code or glyphs falling down rapidly through the screen in aleatory patterns. The screensaver displays also well known dialogs from the films but this is optional.



New to the program is that it now features optional quotes from the movie, as well as options for resolutions, and scrolling speed plus multiple monitor display support.



This paid version has customizable messages, trace code bursts with color tinting and cycling. It's really easy to create your own messages: just create a new text file (.txt) and write one message per line. Next, use special characters: the # key starts a comment line which will be ignored, and the * key equals a line break. An example is found on the website. To install it, copy the file in the screensaver's appropriate directory.
