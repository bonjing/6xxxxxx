,limeyguy,2011-01-05T15:53Z,"@ hellboy. I d/l this and everything seemed to be fine. It shows it is registered and that I am using Pro; however, when I try to extract, I receive a message that I need to purchase a key. I did use the email, registration ID and serial # that was provided. Please help and thanks for the u/l.      "

,Vlodec,2011-02-05T23:27Z,"Yep, this one seems to be a dud. The program appears to accept all registration info ok but when I try to extract a file I get a ""For this functionality you need to register"" message.

Shame."
,extremeuser3,2011-02-06T18:34Z,thanks man !
,Watatsumi,2011-02-22T00:40Z,"thanks, works perfectly.

i blocked it in firewall to prevent it from checking the license online and works 100%

for all those lazy asses that complain about the ""For this functionality you need to register"" message: you need to learn how online verifications work before complaining."
[V],Sir_TankaLot,2011-03-06T11:27Z,Thx friend for UL
,YukiHush,2011-04-13T14:09Z,"Thanks, Man! Preciate it!"
,B.Genaaid,2011-05-08T12:06Z,"@ Watatsumi, guess intalling on a stanalone PC should then work too.... nooooo way.
This is not working, because you can block in a firewall the programm to connect, but then you will have the same problem after a while, it wants to connect to its server but it won't and therefore will cease to operate.
Tried multiple solutions and it is a no go (or you must fill me in the details how exactly you made it work, because some info is missing."
,B.Genaaid,2011-05-10T18:53Z,"If you want a working version, try the next one, I tried it, ran it from USB flashdrive (20Mb/s) and filled in the first key and it worked with the first DVD like a charm. (only a little slower reacting)

do not use the install, just the stand alone app. and one of the keys.

PS my PC is still a stand alone not to the Internet connected PC, the same as where I tried this torrents one as I stated here in a previous post. only before using the linked torrent, I reverted with system restore to a point before the first try of this faulty torrent of isobuster.

Good luck to you all

,12uel,2011-07-08T18:58Z,"For all of us who are getting frustrated about this ""functionality"" message, I recommend try using PowerISO instead. I tried it on my 9-yr-old unreadable CD-RW disc that contained pictures, music and some Word files, and it read and extracted those files without a problem. Good luck."
,WideStance,2011-07-24T00:53Z,"This shit doesn't work. And yes my firewall was enabled before, during and after the install."
