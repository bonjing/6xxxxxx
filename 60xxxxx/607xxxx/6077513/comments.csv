A little plot for this movie here .

Plot

As a welterweight from the wrong side of the tracks, Irish-American Dicky Eklund is the pride of working class Lowell, Massachusetts. Living in his shadow is his half-brother and sparring partner Micky Ward. After fighting Sugar Ray Leonard, Eklund plunges into a nightmare of crack addiction, violence and prison. His family's hopes are crushed in the wake of Dicky's decline. Like a real life Rocky, Micky fights on his own terms and pulls his family out of despair with his meteoric rise in the ring. Freshly paroled Dicky finds redemption training his little brother, now known as ""Irish"" Micky Ward, for his Welterweight Championship bout with Shea Neary."

[V],globeplus,2011-01-02T12:45Z,"To minus111 : when ut really justifies , we are in a period without too many new nice pc games and at this time of year that is a little more appropriated to be with some more relax under the new year starting , people in general including me like to watch nice movies , my work on the movies it is very positive too , getting the best picture possible with the help of the Dub plugins and who donÂ´t like to watch nice movies ? It is like having a time for everything in the correct way and generaly speaking the number of users of good movies are normaly very acceptable and without any problems or complications like it happen in games , on the games can be lot of work and the users get problems in specificitys to run the games , depending on the game , on the movies it is just a matter to choose them well and really do the correct work , having the conscience that the best possible work to get the better picture as possible was done and that is enough , only the nice games can be compared in number of possible users to the generality of the nice movies and that with more work and more carefull but i can canalise my useful work if people want to where it is more necessary , thatÂ´s all and happy new year to you .

Cheers ."
