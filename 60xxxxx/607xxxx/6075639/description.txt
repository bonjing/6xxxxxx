Rick Ross embodies the streets of Miami right down to his name and style of his facial hair taken from one of the most infamous street figures in Miami's history. Now Rick is here to tell the story of these streets as only he can with "M.I.Yayo". M.I.Yayo takes its name taken from the slang words for Miami and cocaine and is a groundbreaking documentary about the real Miami, true murder and cash capital of America, told in a manner stylistically similar to the film "Cocaine Cowboys", but this is much more by and of the Streets.
