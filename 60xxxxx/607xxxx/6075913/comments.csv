the video quality sucks... its like vhs quality.

its free, accept it, otherwise buy it when it comes out or go the movies and film your own copy. but be grateful; for those who take the time and risk to make the rest of us happy."
,notherdaysgoneby,2011-01-01T17:40Z,"I'll comment on quality when I get it if I remember. lol. But to say a film that went to the theater like a week ago or so is VHS quality is awesome! Not to mention that if you actually have a good VCR and a good VHS tape. Most likely made in 2001 to 2005, and you watch it on a good CRT TV. The quality is amazingly great. The problem is big business trying to sell the bigger, the better, the now. If you actually use your own eyes you will find that some in fact a whole bunch of DVD's out there look like ass. A VHS tape never played a pixelated looking movie. "
,Highrider407,2011-01-01T23:03Z,"Looking at the screens.... Looks great. I think everyone is use to HD Movies.  It doesn't look like HD, but it is still an amazing copy.

,bago3k,2011-01-22T20:23Z,"I hate the way things holywood inclined, on this marvelous movie presents Micky Ward won a Mexican, where historically we know that that fight was arranged for ward win in Las Vegas, curiously does not show the fight of the few Ward lost, also against a Mexican, just before the fight with neary in which he won."
