While looking for a simple timer to remind me of things to do while on my PC, I came across this little program and its perfect. Very simple to use with many possibilities and options. Use it once and you\'ll have it locked on your taskbar.

Description and features
SnapTimer is a simple, free, portable countdown timer for Windows.

All the timers I tested were too complex for my taste.  I decided to write one that was dead simple, so you could run it, type in a time and hit enter.  The aim of SnapTimer is to get out of the way and help you be productive.  It\'s fast, lightweight and simple to use, but powerful too.

A popular productivity strategy is to use a timer to do mini-sprints of work.  Using SnapTimer I\'ve increased my productivity and reduced procrastination.  It\'s easier to get yourself to work on a difficult task for 5 minutes because there\'s a known end point.
