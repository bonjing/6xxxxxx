This torrent offers you an astounding font collection, with 6,636 fonts gathered by me over the years (some OSX fonts converted to Windows are included).

All fonts are carefully sorted in the following categories:

* Broadway-Poster           
* Fading-Worn-Typewriter    
* Miniature-fonts           
* Monospaced-Courier        
* Sans-Helvetica            
* Scifi-Futuristic          
* Script-Calligraphic-Ink   
* Script-Handwriting-Marker 
* Serif-Roman               
* Stamp-Stencil             
* Symbols-Dingbats          
* Technical-Architecture    
* Unicial-Blackletter-Fantasy
* Unsorted-Semi-Misc       

Plus, a number of professional fonts are included:                          
                         
* Bodoni                    
* Cocon                     
* DIN                       
* Frutiger                  
* Futura                    
* Garamond                  
* Helvetica                 
* Lucida                    
* Mercury                   
* Meta                      
* Rotis                     
* TheMix                    
* Univers               

Each of the above categories is compressed individually and included in this torrent as a .rar file.
I suppose at this point I could recommend a good font manager to sort out this pandora, in which case I obviously would point you to NexusFont. Look it up.

Enjoy,
