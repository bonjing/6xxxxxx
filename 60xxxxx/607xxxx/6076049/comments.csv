We all appreciate the quality of your downloads.

Thanks."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-01T17:01Z,it will be seeded after the remaining 4 hd's i have queued are pushed.
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-01T18:03Z,although i really wish someone else would step up and fill it.
,peterfettes,2011-01-01T22:13Z,"Thank You, HR - Once my download of Whiteout is complete. I'll take on the seeding."
,khurrraam,2011-01-02T18:16Z,"hey holyroses, I would love to help you out, but I have changed the metadata on my file. I'm guessing, it won't work and may corrupt the seeding if I tried to seed it again?"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-02T18:20Z,"no, you would download the torrent and point it to your folder and then force a recheck (its a utorrent option).  You would then get your file rebuilt, only about 1 megabyte of data is changed in yours.  You would end up fetching about 1mb of data from the swarm."
