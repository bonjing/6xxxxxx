,WhizbeeSlug,2011-01-03T12:13Z,Thank you for this! I know that this took a lot of time. I will seed when my download finishes :)
,WhizbeeSlug,2011-01-03T12:21Z,"Hmm...It's gotten to around 4,000 kb (while it still said connecting...) and then it stopped. Now I can't get it to go again.

Will someone please help the poster seed?"
,RareNinja,2011-01-03T12:44Z,cannebts keep getting removed.... complete bullshit if u ask me... stuck at 0.1%... if it was someone who really knew what they were doing there would be a few hundred seeds by now
,azer000,2011-01-03T12:48Z,"When will a DVDRip appear? The dvdrip of Halfblood Prince appeared one and a half month before the actual release, so I hope we'll receive a proper version in a few weeks."
,phunto,2011-01-03T16:14Z,hey what's dis bullshit it has stucked 0.5%..........
,phunto,2011-01-03T16:15Z,pls seed...............
,Hinderlijker,2011-01-03T21:26Z,"THANK YOU SO MUCH, I will be seeding"
,blinksurfer118,2011-01-03T22:24Z,SEED!! Haven't been past 2% if it is a copy of the Turkish one with english audio it's worth downloading so please seed guys
,dumbson,2011-01-04T03:47Z,so a/v quality?
,WhizbeeSlug,2011-01-04T05:17Z,"dumbson, if this IS a re-dub of the Turkish upload, then I'd say that the video is a nine, and assuming the audio is from the XVid, I'd say it's a seven or eight.

I think it's safe to assume this would be the BEST copy if we could get it."
,oldred18,2011-01-04T05:24Z,plzz seed
,oldred18,2011-01-04T05:24Z,im seeding the best i can but ive only been able to get to 4.5 %
,oldred18,2011-01-04T05:28Z,this will be the best copy till dvd rip only if we could get it!
,geno1002,2011-01-04T05:57Z,i got to 5.3% and then it just stopped :/ have the sample to watch over and over XD
,bmdj92,2011-01-04T07:54Z,"C'mon, seed people! Stuck at 6.5% :( Promise to seed when done."

,ma88to,2011-01-04T14:15Z,seeed.... stuck on 8.6%  :S
,jesper300,2011-01-04T14:25Z,"@Sabi96

Your are a great person to sync and put this great copy online, but if you don't seed this torrent will be worthless....

The torrent start with more than 2 mb p/s but stops at 6 procent.

No seeds, people wil walk away. You are warned."
,jenchai,2011-01-04T15:51Z,"So far from the trackers, 15 people has downloaded the copy, but unfortunately, they don't seem to have great upload speed or not seeding anymore. 

Thats a shame since its so early in the download. I wish those people to have it who can upload at like 1 mb/s speed."
,Sabi96,2011-01-04T17:41Z,i keep the seed on 24/7
,bmdj92,2011-01-05T00:09Z,Thank you - I seem to have got a seeder and says I should be done in 2 hours (if they keep seeding). I promise to seed _if_ my DL completes.
,oldred18,2011-01-05T00:15Z,getting a little bit more now.
,bmdj92,2011-01-05T00:15Z,"Nevermind, I stopped at 12% >:("
,WhizbeeSlug,2011-01-05T06:17Z,"I'm making progress, slowly, but it is happening. Seeding goes in and out for me; but I should get it eventually.

Once again, when I do, I will seed."
,Spike_the_Bloody,2011-01-05T11:18Z,ok so I've uploaded more than 4 gb already and I'm stuck at 11% - you can't tell me that there's stil ONE seeder! WTF?
,persianpars,2011-01-05T14:14Z,"i't is making progress at 2kb/s
and im stuck at 21%"
,jenchai,2011-01-05T15:43Z,Everybody stuck at 20.6 %. It seems no new part  available to share.
,asdfg8732,2011-01-05T16:31Z,When will the dvd release ?
,jenchai,2011-01-05T17:28Z,Is everybody stuck at 21.4% or some has progress more like 50%+ ?
,Hinderlijker,2011-01-05T17:36Z,Please stay seeding... im stuck at 21% 
,oldred18,2011-01-05T17:36Z,its taking a while.
,RedFM,2011-01-05T19:38Z,"stuck on 21,3%...(((
I've been downloading for 3 days now.... it's breaking all the records for the slowest torrent..."
,persianpars,2011-01-05T19:49Z,"if we download the english version of IMAGINE for audio
and the new turkish version for video and encode them it would be a lot faster"
,Sabi96,2011-01-05T20:35Z,I did that
,bmdj92,2011-01-06T00:43Z,"C'mon, stuck at 25%. And seeding goes in and out. This is probably one of the better copies out there and only 1 seeder???"
,jenchai,2011-01-06T08:08Z,"@Sabi96

Thanks for uploading this great copy and for the hard work. But it seems like only 28.3% is available right now to most(or possibly all). 

I was wondering what's your upload speed. Cos right now not even a full copy is available to share. And it seems like only 28.3% is been uploaded till yet. And very small percent coming every few hrs. 

At this rate it seems like a week before the whole copy seems to be available to all of us."

,bmdj92,2011-01-06T09:58Z,"Yep - the only seed is going in and out for a percent or two every once in awhile. Nearly every peer here is stuck on 29.2% or so.

At the upload speed - there probably won't be quick download for anyone available for a week at this rate... Unless others who have downloaded this already seed (which I doubt)."
,jojos22,2011-01-06T10:35Z,Allthough it will be my first time im gonna try doing the same as sabi did. When im finished i will be uploading it aswell. Hopefully that way it will go a bit faster for everyone :)
,persianpars,2011-01-06T13:48Z,"jojos22:
which audio are going to use?
thanks a lot any way
and if you can please put english subtitle"
,phunto,2011-01-06T13:59Z,strucked at 31.4 ..............
,jojos22,2011-01-06T18:09Z,"I have no clue if it is permitted to post my link in this post, if its not permitted then sorry for that and you can remove it.

@sabi96
Thanks for your great effort and time :)

@persianpars:
I wont put any subtitles in it, since that way people can put their own subtitle language in them and re-post them or just simply watch it in their language :)

It is my first movie compilation so im not (yet) really into whats best to use and such.
Im just hoping its good enough for all those people that expect good quality :)
Soon we will know hehe.

Anyway the link to my version:

,oldred18,2011-01-06T20:02Z,is anyone close to having this one done
,oldred18,2011-01-06T20:05Z,audio and video is off just a little but thanks for the upload will keep seeding.
,Sabi96,2011-01-06T22:09Z,73% seeded
,oldred18,2011-01-07T03:43Z,anyone get this downloaded yet
,oldred18,2011-01-07T03:54Z,hey sabi96 could u tell me what program you used to sync the audio and video and thanks for the upload by the way.
,bmdj92,2011-01-07T04:37Z,"Yeah, no one is going to get anymore if everyone is seeding only 36%. "
,jenchai,2011-01-07T04:55Z,"Sabi96, whats your upload speed ? Cos if you can upload even one copy, rest of the peer can share it between themselves.

And to those peers with 50% and 70%, atleast you guys can keep seeding till the whole copy is uploaded. Then we could have most peers at 50 or 70%."
,bmdj92,2011-01-07T05:20Z,This one is taking too long. I downloaded the other torrent by jojos22. The audio's a little out of sync - but audio delay will fix that.
,Abhi1302,2011-01-07T12:40Z,stucked at 38.2% ....
,table543,2011-01-10T05:59Z,Now up to 58.4% !
,Abhi1302,2011-01-11T17:53Z,stucked at 68.7!!!!
,table543,2011-01-12T17:03Z,Now up to 78.8%!
,snsosa2,2011-01-13T06:56Z,PLEASE SEEED
,bmdj92,2011-01-13T07:55Z,"It's not the seeders, it's the uploader. He must have a horrible upload speed because he's the ONLY uploader. No one has gotten a full copy yet... Shame because it's probably the best one out there. Better be in-sync too..."
,Sjoews,2011-01-13T09:41Z,"84.9% and downloading with 900kb/s
been downloading for a day now.. 
will seed"
,Sjoews,2011-01-13T09:42Z,went down to 0.4kb/s -.-
,Sabi96,2011-01-14T11:36Z,"Start downloading, 97% seeded!"
,bmdj92,2011-01-14T11:49Z,C'mon - I'm at 97.8% -_-
,jenchai,2011-01-14T15:55Z,Almost there 99.3%. Finally !!!!
,romione,2011-01-14T19:47Z,"Great Video but the audio goes out of sync, thanks anyway for the upload."
,jenchai,2011-01-15T02:10Z,"Great Video. The best out there yet, almost an R5.

Audio: The audio is out of sync for like 1s here and there for like 10-15 mins somewhere in the middle of the movie. Considering the length of the movie - 128 mins, surely 1s delay is not the biggest issue in the world when it has the best video available compared to other dark cam rip.

And you hardly notice any difference in syncronisation. Cos I find it almost fine. The best syncronised version out there yet. 

Sabi96 did a very good job.

THIS is the BEST version out till NOW !!!!"
,PabloMansini,2011-01-15T12:34Z,"people need to seed...selfish twats, im going to seed for another 2 days then thats it..."
,jacobman,2011-02-07T14:42Z,hey does anyone nned help do you want me to seed? tell me how
,r150171,2011-02-13T07:20Z,"it is difficult to enjoy movie viewing this. But, in tits and bits, it gives idea about the scenes contained in the movie. I have Little hope till DVD/BD of film is released on 15th April. A proper output shall be available then. But, till that time, it was good effort from Sabi96."
,evo0lini,2011-03-09T19:37Z,i downloaded it....but how can i find subtitles?
