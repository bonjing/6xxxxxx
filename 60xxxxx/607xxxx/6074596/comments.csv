,FigonaPetter,2011-01-11T13:27Z,"Yo are you member of the Sam community? If you are,you would know me (if you've played DM) :p

Good upload anyway, though I had to chuckle when I read ""latest patches"" ;)"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-11T16:39Z,"@FigonaPetter yeah i play but not dm. i don't care for it's dm. i like other games in deathmatch. why would it be funny that these are the latest patches? if you are talking about the beta patch (1.50) for serious sam the second encounter...that is included too, along with the 1.07."
,FigonaPetter,2011-01-14T14:27Z,"That's just funny in my own eyes, having played from 2002-2008. We were waiting for years for croteam to make some new patches, since there's a problem with the netcode in Sam, that's why ""latest patches"" sounded funny. Glad to hear you play anyway. I hope you tried out some of the cool custom made mods made for it, like 'Serious Violence'. Search on YouTube or Check a clip  on my channel - watch?v=QFHMxusKvoU it's hilarious but it's a clip from DM, it's more funny in SP."
,songco123,2011-06-10T12:01Z,I can't find the crack...
,fritz214,2011-08-14T14:55Z,"I have a few questions....
-does this have the patches
-crack included
-and is this Ripped? or Nothing Removed?
-LAN playable?
-Gamespy Arcade needed?"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-09-23T20:54Z,"has the patches included as stated in title, has the cracks included too as all my uploads do. no gayspy arcade needed, can be played lan and internet...and both at same time. no cracked servers either, you play online as if u bought the game....legit!!!!

NOTHING is removed :)"
