,thespiderbiter,2011-06-30T06:21Z,"this is a piece of crap. dont bother DL-ing. he (the narrator) makes appeals to authority after admitting he himself has no credentials, denounces evolution, claims there are no archeological findings for how the pyramids were built (a flat out lie), and makes other baseless/misinformed assertions.

if you are a rational, sane person with even a standard high school education and have a standard for accepting claims as true based on honest skepticism, and an independently verifiable method based on empirical data, then this film will either piss you off or make you shake your head in shame for even being classified in the same genus as this f**k face. 

see what i just did? i took the ugliest word in the english language and associated it with his identity. he deserves it..... FAIL!!!"

,betengan,2012-03-11T09:52Z,"Well, thanks, if this dude is dismissing the biggest pseudo-scientific hoax in the history of mankind, aka evolution, then he's A-Freakin'-OK in my book! Thumbs up to him. 

How do you like that, fanatic evolutionist f***s, huh? Hehehe. Evolution is a belief, darwinism is a religion, and Darwin is its deity; admit it, turds. Face your sad reality; you're as much of a believer as any religious person, just unaware of it. And the proof is that nobody ever or could ever show you evolution in a lab, or prove it to you using the scientific method; you're simply ""believing"" that it happened, based on what someone wearing a a white coat (instead of a black coat) is telling you. Hmm...that does remind me of a little thing in life we call...""religion"". Hah. =)"
,warefox,2012-06-09T08:29Z,"I found it very interesting.  I don't think you have to agree or disagree to learn something.  For not having credentials, he did a very decent job of putting it together in a broad sense.  Organized enough to make a decent college paper in my opinion.  I did learn some things."
