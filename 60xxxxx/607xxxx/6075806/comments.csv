,tracy1au,2011-01-02T01:48Z,"I am new to this and dont know how to seed ,, can someone plz explain how ??"
,inspmimes,2011-01-02T02:01Z,seeder = has complete copy of the torrent & sharing it with the world
,camo12345,2011-01-02T02:47Z,"Basically, you will automatically become a Seeder once you finish downloading the torrent. While downloading a torrent you are a Peer. And if you download a file and instantly remove the torrent from your client (uTorrent for example), you are then what's known as a Leecher (I like to call them greedy little fuckers who should have their internet access cut off).

So... now you know what they all are, please seed in the future. Even if its just for a few hours, it helps."
,TheeElectricWarrior,2011-01-02T03:23Z,"thanks ez!! sample looks fantastic!! you, whooever you are, have become my all time fav uploader. every show i ever want to see you have ul'd within hrs of its airings....and now movies. you are amazing!!!"
,ljbew,2011-01-02T03:36Z,"@camo thanks for clarifying, I thought that is how it worked.. Yes PPL ljbew always seeds at ratio 1.00 thats is what my 1st comment got out of hand for. There is no way that all the 4175 lechrs (yesterday)could be helping me/u. I always get a movie finished around 17 to 20 minutes on good days.

SciFiBot I realize they take a while but damn it was crazy slow. I was trying to make a point to seed is all. Thanks to all  \\ (⌣د̲⌣) //"
,tracy1au,2011-01-02T05:06Z,"Cheers Camo 12345, I am seeding for all I have downloaded then!! Happy New Year :)"
,Kingslayer513,2011-01-02T11:34Z,"@Tauser11
Yes there is a connection. I have noticed that as well and I believe it is because many people have their bittorrent client turned off during the day so their computer does not run slow but turns it on when they go to sleep to help support the community. This is the reason why its best to start a long download at night when it has the best connection and it will be done by morning.

~Cheers"

Easily watchable but video is a bit fuzzy wouldnt be good if watching on a screen size bigger than 17"". Actually i watched it in 15.6"" and it was OK, watchable but fuzzy.

Good film though, thanks for the TvTeam for uploading!!"
,u2m93,2011-01-02T15:35Z,"a/v is Audio and Visual.

It's a subjective rating for quality of video and sound. Subjective because it is down to a persons oppinion and that may change between people.

This vid is a screener, comes up with a line or 2 of text a couple of times thoughout warning it is for some kind of preview only or something."

Most converters don't even see it and the one I use 99% of the time converts .05% and has to shut down. Same with the other 2 of 10 programs I've tried. Nero seems to be working but it can't remove the letterbox. I hate going through the trouble to convert it for all players and 1/2 of the screen is black. Hopefully someone will take this and use their professional abilities to make something Ultra Video Converter can work with. I've never seen such a problem and I've converted a LOT of movies. Still, I'll keep sharing 4-5 X like always for those who don't go through the tedious conversion process. TY for the upload."
