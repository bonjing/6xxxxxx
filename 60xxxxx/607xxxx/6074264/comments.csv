,fido123,2010-12-31T05:23Z,Great work by the BBC. An excellent watch.  Love Nigel Slater and his TV shows so its great to see how it all began.  (Watch out for his cameo appearance at the very end as the chef at the Savoy Hotel) also another fine performance by Helena Bonham Carter. Thanks for the up.
