                    Adaptation of chef Nigel Slater's        
                    autobiography, providing a nostalgic trip  
                    through everything edible in 1960s Britain.  
                    After tragedy strikes food-obsessed young Nigel  
                    and his family, he is horrified when his father  
                    announces they are moving to the country.  
                    Taking solace in domestic science classes at  
                    the new school, Nigel's cooking soon becomes  
                    the key weapon in the battle for his father's  
                    affections. And when Nigel lands a job in the  
                    kitchen of his local pub, his eyes are opened  
                    to a world of opportunity.
