sounds like it was recorded off an AM radio, using a cheap tape-deck.  Then audio captured at 24kpbs and up-sampled to 256.

Don't Waste Your Time!"

Pretty sure this is a recording of AM radio then burnt to a vinyl record, which was then scratched with a piece of sharp metal, and played on a CD player. Shit!"
