,Frice,2011-01-02T08:35Z,"Thanks for the post. Appreciate the UFC hookup, its getting hard to find.

If you have read this far STOP... 
I am 99% sure there are SPOILERS employed by the UFC (zuffa) to ruin UFC torrents. 
They give away the maincard winner as well as others in order to sour the demand for pirated UFC vids.

You have been warned MMA fans..."
,Frice,2011-01-02T08:38Z,"Not sure why you removed my comment, it was valid as their are losers ruining UFC video's by spoiling the outcomes for the matches.

Thanks for the video though, appreciate the effort it takes."

,phillylicious,2011-01-02T12:45Z,How awesome that NO ONE is seeding. This is JUST the problem we don't need with these rare torrents. PLEASE people! Pull you head out of you asses and START SEEDING!!!
,The.Buzzsaw,2011-01-02T22:17Z,This file is corrupt. It just says error when I try to open the rar file with 7-zip. Am I just doing something wrong?
,enemy2k,2011-01-10T10:32Z,There is always some noob who is complaining about no one seeding when there is tons of people seeding.
