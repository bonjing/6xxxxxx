Any chance you got other unreleased episodes of series 3, ie, S03E28 - S03E50?

Thanks"
,ilsennodipoi,2011-01-30T15:42Z,Can anyone explain what good rar-ing a file like this does? It doesn't make it smaller and the first thing people do after downloading is unrar it and delete the rar-files and thus stop seeding. Also there is the problem that not every system has an inbuilt rar utility.
