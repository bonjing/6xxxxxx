If possible, I would love if the first person who downloads it could comment and let me know if the file downloaded correctly!  And remember to seed!"
,rohit52111,2011-01-30T01:54Z,I tried this and it did not work.....i don't know how to get back my original firmware.HELP!!!!
,rohit52111,2011-01-30T02:05Z,Got it now it is working!!!!
,fablebyte,2011-02-19T11:40Z,The firmware updated to 100% and my nbox switched itself off.  Now I cannot get an image output on my TV.  I've switched it on and pressed the AV button and nothing.  How do you change the video output back to display on the TV?
,dw57481,2011-03-17T18:56Z,"Fablebyte - That depends on what kind of TV you have.  Did you ever figure it out?
Rohit - You said ""Got it now it's working!!!""  I hope you mean the new firmware - I'm so glad to be able to help people who were having the same issue as I was!"

,aptozi,2011-07-10T04:16Z,"Thanks dw57481
 It worked like a charm. Im happy about being able to use the folders options. if you don't mind I would like to add one thing about the install. When to get the firmware .img file you don't open that file you just put the file on the flash drive and go to the file section in the NBox and open it there. 
    I haven't flashed firmware before and I was trying to get into the file like you would an .iso file. Spent hours last night and four or five beers later gave up and went to bed.
 Woke-up this morning and had it running in minutes.
  Thanks again 
            I'm up in age and that old screen was killing me , now I can see what I'll be watching."
,jassc,2011-08-02T02:31Z,"Hi

I have a NBOX V1 with a diferent version, a newer one I think:

The v2010-10-21 it only has English and Portuguese languages.

It's very goog for the portuguese because it's possible subtitles with 2x zoom, with all our characters:

ç à á â ã

But it doesn't changes file organization to be by NAME, not by last date updated.

Do anyone know how can I download my nbox firmware? I mean directly from the box."
,peplox,2012-02-23T23:49Z,This update is fot the NBOX N82..?
