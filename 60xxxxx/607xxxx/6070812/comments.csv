,Raukan,2010-12-29T10:37Z,SEED PLZ! This movie is awesome!
,Oksu,2010-12-29T14:02Z,SEED!!!!
,kikuka,2010-12-29T14:53Z,Spoken language? Rus or original?
,f.kruger,2010-12-29T16:26Z,"no one seeding this at all not even the uploader srhavrav who only has one other file, pretty wierd"
,Raukan,2010-12-29T16:57Z,"Well the seeding is not weird since the torrent hasn't been up yet and it seems legit, the sources he mentions from demonoid are real so... but more people need to seed. So plz when done downloading keep seeding for awhile!"
,kikuka,2010-12-30T09:20Z,"Audio sync not correct. Sound come little early, but vlc can handle that :)"

THNX srhavrav! 

Although as it says in the description the subtitles are TERRIBLE! So now I wonder if anybody knows if there is a way to separate the subfile from the .mkv-file and edit it?"
,Ville888,2010-12-30T17:08Z,Awsome file thanks subs sucks but idc coz im from finland ;)
,xerces9,2010-12-30T23:20Z,"Audio stutters all the time.
Is there a way to fix it?
I use VLC 1.1.5 on Win

Also some good subtitles would be. I have english, but it is also out of sync. Maybe I fix those."
,f.kruger,2010-12-31T18:56Z,"thanks for the up, been waiting fot this :)"
,FLYing_MoNkEy,2010-12-31T20:30Z,"@xerces9 - I believe You do truly have some "" bleebs "" with the sound. I do not know what is this random problem that VLC is giving right now. Try BSplayer and you'll see. ...Also it has been so that this bleebing sound problems has became to VLC just lately and only with some of the latest xvid publications. My best guess is that some codec-compiler, which has just recently updated or released is breaking some standard rules. VLC still plays over 99% of files correct - stick with it! :)

Overall to this release: They say it is good by  audio and video, but I must say that subtitles within this release are quite awful, but they're soft coded and can be turn off. Go and seek for better subs on net! 

Thanks."
,PetejaWille,2011-01-02T13:13Z,"Nice movie but the subs are way off, how can u ppl understand anything just by reading that."
,cosmicelf,2011-01-04T06:55Z,"Great video and audio quality.  Although I imagine anyone who knows finnish and english will find this quite funny.  In fact anyone who can read english will find this quite difficult to understand.  The subtitles are really really really bad.  Please finland friends,  re-sub this film.  I will watch it again. :)"
,cosmicelf,2011-01-04T10:50Z,if anybody finds a sub for this that makes sense and doesn't slide out of sync..  the only ones i've found so far go out of sync by several minutes not very far into the movie.  very odd.
