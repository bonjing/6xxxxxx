IMDB:

In the depths of the Korvatunturi mountains, 486 metres deep, lies the closest ever guarded secret of Christmas. The time has come to dig it up! This Christmas everyone will believe in Santa Claus.

Details:

This file is the result of remuxing the video from the Russian "Santa.na.prodazhu.2010.D.DVDRip.ELEKTRI4KA.avi" with the audio from "Rare exports (original audio).avi" and a set of (google translated) softsubs. Both of the source files were downloaded from Demonoid. My main concern was getting the best video and audio I could, so the subs are (quite frankly) terrible. This should give subbers something to work with for a better release.
