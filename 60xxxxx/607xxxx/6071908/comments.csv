,hansolo77,2011-03-13T02:58Z,"I downloaded this and the English audio tracks in the hopes of being able to play it on my BluRay player.  I muxed them together using mkvmerge and everything fine.  Windows Media Player played the movie fine as well, but my bluray player says its unrecognizable.  While this is clearly a problem on MY end, I was wondering if perhaps somebody knows of another torrent elsewhere where somebody has had success in watching on their bluray.  I should also note that i can watch other .mkv files on my bluray player just fine.  I think it's because this is in 1080p though."

,tpboss,2012-01-14T09:05Z,"The most annoying torrent I've ever dealt with. Yes, quality of audio and video are quite nice. But playback is rediculous. Trying to open the ac3 files are really annoying; having to download a stupid program just to play it. Or, in win movie maker having to match the video/audio together then publish it to a computer/dvd. And you're also downloading an extra 1.x gigs of crap you wont even use. Oh; btw, its hard subbed in english. thank you for that warning.

,bgee5204,2012-04-22T21:16Z,"Thank you for the torrent, which program do you use to put sound back onto video? Using VLC to read it but can't read both at the same time."
