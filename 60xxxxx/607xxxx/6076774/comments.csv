,mac_GR,2011-03-23T01:42Z,"@ Computer-User :

Please my friend tell me , if I just burn the 2 iso disks ..., when I put the second disk ,will the installation continue ? I have a macbook and I use roxio ''toast'' to burn iso files. 

Also I would like to ask : is this a pre-activated version ? 

@ Succeders : PLEASE tell the rest of us what program you used to burn the image files and what happened after the installation ended. did you need a cd key to activate windows ? And some other details as the days remaining to use the software e.t.c

THANKS for your time :-)"

,vundu,2011-05-25T12:03Z,"Please help!!!

After installation when system restarted it doesn't boot but displays a disk read error occurred press ctrl+alt+del to restart

but even after several restart and reformatting and installing windows I'm still stuck at this level

my email id vundoo@gmail.com"
,NeverAround,2011-06-04T00:20Z,"There are 2 isos. Burn them to 2 discs. Reboot the PC with disc 1 in the drive. Swap in the 2nd disc when prompted.

Or, you could try 2 usb drives of 4GB size. 

Search Youtube for the ""How to make a bootable USB pen drive to install Windows 7 onto any netbook, notebook or PC"" video.

Reboot your PC with the USB drive 1. When prompted, swap in the 2nd USB drive. Or if you have a second PC, and not a second usb drive. Repeat the video tutorial to reformat the USB with iso 2 on PC 2, and swap it back into PC 1.

Don't bother with the included cracks in the torrent. 

Just download the ""TimerLock Automated Batch Install Script"" from the ""Mydigitallife"" site, and check under ""latest version""."
