Description

Now you can play Strategery, the award-winning strategy game, for FREE! Strategery Lite features the same exciting gameplay as the full version, with no time limits or ads, but you'll have to upgrade for all the fun gameplay options and to play online.

Strategery is a fast-paced game of world domination, designed and built from top to bottom for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Play against the computer or your friends in an epic battle of strategy and risk.
