[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-03T07:48Z,@m0t0maniac IT WORKS JUST FINE. that error means you need to update your directx 9....next time try googling an error before assuming something doesn't work. better yet look in the contact info.....
,ghost232323,2011-01-03T11:22Z,"HAHAHA!!! I get a good laugh reading about these idiots complaining ""THE GAME DOESN'T WORK!!!"" because they're too thick to understand that it's their stupidity preventing the game from starting/running correctly... If you have a problem with and of the releases, BUY THE GAME!!! I want to personally thank FuCtUpPuNk for this release and all the hard work involved!!!"
,m0t0maniac,2011-01-04T03:09Z,"@ FuCtUpPuNk - Meant doesn't work for me (nothing personal). You're right though, I should have googled it.

@ghost232323 you're welcome, glad you enjoy.

@everyone look in contact info. add me. especially if you are having trouble getting stuff to work, i am usually online."

,wtfronsson,2011-01-08T14:04Z,"not having success with ""FINAL-Y"" mouse aim mod. is it incompatible?"
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-09T07:37Z,"there is a mouse support mod that does work but it's not called ""final y"". i have never heard of that. but perhaps it is the same mod i'm thinking of, you must be using it wrong. when you use the mouse aim mod you must use the exe provided in the mod to run the game, not the exe you'd usually use. hope this helps"
,aaagk,2011-01-12T19:27Z,"Is there something i gotta do about this virus? ""HATRED"" and i mounted the image and all the boring stuff when i click setup nothing happens. It just plain doesn't work so i right clicked and opened then clicked install and it gave me an error? Can anyone help if i'm doing something wrong."
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-01-13T02:03Z,"that isn't a virus, its a crack for the game. you need to disable your anti virus and all that shit. then re-extract the torrent. then mount and install."

,nips122,2011-02-04T06:30Z,hey do u need a better grapihc card for the tecture patch me pc can handle the game perfect but my graphic card isnt great but mangeable
,narnians2,2011-02-07T19:10Z,with that error havem0t0maniac  is that he must download drivers 4 his video card 
,Mrpepperson,2011-02-09T14:26Z,"As I unpacked my game from the ISO, my Avast Antivirus picked up a rather interesting thing, A nice Trojan virus! I'm not saying its actually a virus, but it seemed to move to my Virus chest, which I don't mind all that much, at least it isn't screwing my computer over. I just wanted to let you guys know, be cautious. "
[T],FuCtUpPuNk,2011-02-09T18:50Z,"@Mrpepperson the torrent is clean, and anything ur anti virus picks up will usually be moved to it's chest. im assuming your anti virus picked up the crack/no cd as a virus?"
,asif105878,2011-02-20T18:00Z,"How do I install the Enhanced Texture Patch 2.0? I first installed patch 1.1.0 and ran the game and then extracted 'Resident Evil 4 texture patch 2.0.7z' an put the folders ogg, xfile & xscr in the install folder and ran the game again. In both cases the graphics look the same to me :("

,Canonjac,2011-03-07T11:49Z,"I'me stuck. I've done everything right so far and i just updated the 1.1.0 and the instructions told me to go the the 1.1.0 no cd folder and get the crack but when i open it all there is, is a game.exe and when i click that it just opens up a blank black box.

,Livy.the.pixie,2011-03-21T18:29Z,"For those who use Windows 7 x64, set the compatibility mode for the file ""install.exe"" in the iso to Windows XP SP2 before installing. Otherwise you'll get an error when trying to patch the game to v1.1.0 (it says it cannot find the game to update). Remember, Windows XP SP2. SP3 won't work. After 3 fail installations, I finally got it working."
,Livy.the.pixie,2011-03-22T16:38Z,"Sorry about the previous post. This torrent works well with Windows 7 x64 w/o any compatibility settings. The reason that causes the update failure is that I add a backslash (\) at the end of the destination folder when choosing the destination. If you set the compatibility mode to XP SP2, it may broke your game after the second cutscene.

The graphics patch was awesome. Everything looks good after applying this. For those who cannot notice the changes, you can temporary delete 3 folders in the patch (to Recycle Bin) and then restore them to see. The easiest thing to see is Leon's coat's engraving and the wall in the houses -- they looks better after applying the patch."

,dgkresge,2011-03-31T01:26Z,"@canonjac
copy the .exe and paste it into the re4 folder wherever you installed it (i.e c:\programfiles...)
when you paste it into the resident evil 4 folder, it will say that there is already a file named that, replace it and viola! =]"

,F3rny111,2011-06-26T04:36Z,"Would like to know what software I can use so I can use with a mouse. If not, does anyone know if a xbox360 controller will work, I know it should use only PS2 based controller, but wanted to ask anyways"
,F3rny111,2011-06-26T04:58Z,"Nevermind, found this: http://www.moddb.com/downloads/resident-evil-4-mouseaim-patch-11
It has mixed reviews but it could work. The patch allows the game to be played with a mouse/keyboard set up :)"
,F3rny111,2011-06-27T05:13Z,"So mouse controls suck, so I'm just using my PS3 controller instead. Also, I believe the patch is the one by Albert Garau, but not sure.

,dppendon,2011-09-06T07:55Z,Working great on my Windows 7 Home premium. Haven't finished the game (about 30% progress) but so far no problems and graphics are awesome after the applying the patch. Thanks!
,Silent_Hatred,2011-09-12T14:09Z,Hello im having a bit of trouble with this and i dont know if its because im using windows XP or not but when i try to epdate my game it gives me an error saying that the patch detected no game that needed an update any solutions? :\
,dothackjhe,2011-09-15T08:26Z,"I installed the game on Windows 7 x64, it works just fine. No problems encountered even when patching the game. The only downside I've noticed with the PC version is, when the texture patch is attached, conversations on Leon's mobile device shows lagging mouth movement in parallel with their statements; poor quality videos in between scenes; and lack of widescreen support on some computer's I think. "
,dppendon,2011-09-27T09:40Z,Finished the game w/ no probs on my Windows 7 64bit. You definitely need a PS2 type controller to enjoy this (keyboard control sucks). Then you have to manually modify your controls by editing the Setup Tool located at your installation folder. You can also change your screen resolution in this file (changed mine to widescreen 1366x768). Cutscenes are blurry in the PC version and not due to the texture patch.
,SirRudolph,2011-11-28T09:45Z,"This game has equal content to the PS2/Wii Release, which entails;

WEAPONS:
P.R.L: (Plagas Removal Lazer) -Obtained from completing game on Professional
Hand Cannon: (Infinite Magnum) -Obtained for free from the merchant after 5*'ing all mercenary missions
Chicago Typewriter: (Infinte Thompson) -Obtained from beating the game on any difficulty, 1m pts at merchant.
Infinite Launcher: -Obtained same as Chicago Typewriter

CONTENT:
This game contains Special Costumes 1 (Raccoon Police Department Leon/Pop Diva Ashley) and 2 (Mafia Leon/Armored Ashley). 
Both Assignment Ada and the 5 Chapter Ada Story line.

This PC remake isnt worth downloading without the texture pack included. Or at least applied afterwords. It seems Ubisoft was the one to port it and it was terribly done."

,jaffer,2012-02-01T03:19Z,"Hope this will work on win7 64bit professional with:

So its not HD display.one of those lcd(osd?)ones.
and logitech gamepad(ps2 type without rumble)?
The reason why Im asking this that sometimes I have no problems with antivirus..or adding games on DEP list.But windows itself sometimes shuts no-cd games down with""windows has worked flawlessly(without error or done the right thing)and the program/application will close.ThatÂ´s a rough translation from finnish version."
,jaffer,2012-02-01T03:45Z,Sorry for the second one..But I have had those installation problems with some games.It seems that only way that my pc lets extract some of cracked games is to put hem in C..Not in c/program files or c/program files(x86)and hope the files are not all over the place.Well what the heck.I seed back anyways.Just wondering if the textures are too much for the monitor.Or which folder to try to put it.or can this be burned on to disc?
,jaffer,2012-02-03T07:47Z,Thank you..Had just one crash.I burned and installed exactly as instructed.Weird thing is that I have two separate save files?Another one is when I just click on Desktop icon normally and other appears when I run it as administrator.Which one to use?Kind os odd that I have a save that has been saved on to slot 1 and four..and another which I have saved on four slots?It crashed on another.DonÂ´t remember which one.But I played over six hours straight so might be that.Just to clarify things.Which to use?Too odd to play n two different saves.One of them is in capcom folder save.dat named.But dont have a clue where that another is or has come.
