Chosen for their ability to kill without conscience, a group of killers,
some trained and some who are not, must endeavour the alien race of predators
that have set out to target them as prey. Dropped into the vast jungle of a
distant world, these human predators must learn just who, or what, they
are up against, and that their ability, knowledge and wits are tested to
the limits in the battle of survival of kill or be killed.
