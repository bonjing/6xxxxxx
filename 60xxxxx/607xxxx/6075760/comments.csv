,Phoenix-III,2011-01-02T16:03Z,"goodness me...I thought you'd stopped uploading...

You don't know how happy I am to bump into this torrent...

You never mentioned in any of SLC2009 torrents you had changed your name...How cruel...

Anyway I'm just kidding...

i wish you a Happy new year and thank you for your wonderful work..."

,bandergrove,2011-01-21T19:01Z,"Hey Shankly, thanks for all the great work!  I've been following your stuff since 2006 and I love it. :)

Also, I recently had a huge hard drive failure and I'm trying to re-download all of your mixes.

I've got everything from 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2010, but I can't find anything except the ""Best Of"" from *2007*.  Could you re-up your monthly mixes from 2007?  (Maybe in one big archive?)

Thanks!"
