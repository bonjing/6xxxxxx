The series is set mainly in Hell with episodes based around philosophical arguments between Satan and the somewhat idealistic main human character, Professor Richard Whittingham (James Grout). 

Generally, Satan wishes to prove to the Professor that Mankind is inherently base or flawed with the Professor taking an opposing position. Usually Satan will travel to the human world to display the more contemptible sides of human nature such as snipers shooting old ladies in Bosnia or prostitution in Thailand to a generally horrified Professor. However, the Professor's idealism is usually shown to have some validity as well and more often than not the Professor wins the argument, although Satan always insists he hasn't.
