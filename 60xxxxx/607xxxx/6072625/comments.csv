,makeyoubleed,2011-01-09T00:39Z,someone please seed
,Dante8411,2011-04-08T02:49Z,"I sent copies of the DVDs to someone who claimed he was going to seed, but apparently that didn't work out.
I can try to seed, but my internet is VERY slow, and so it will take a VERY long time."
,bondedbybud,2011-07-16T08:58Z,Please seed dude id kill to have this
,Dante8411,2011-08-02T01:47Z,"My harddrive was wiped a while back. I'll see if I can compose the whole thing again to seed, though."
,Dante8411,2011-08-05T06:10Z,"I'm going to ask everyone else to please seed as well, as my max transfer speed is usually 15 kb/s."
,jerrylee16,2011-08-05T20:17Z,"Hi, do you know where you found this please"
,jerrylee16,2011-08-06T01:01Z,"Also, do you know where the other 2 episodes are please, i only found 11, by the way thanks gor the upload, it's brilliant"
,Dante8411,2011-08-06T19:25Z,"I didn't find it, I bought the DVD online. It's probably one-of-a-kind.
Oh, that's right. I'm missing the last two eps. Those might be lost forever.
By the way, I don't know why, but seeding has slowed down to 5 to no kb/s (no other active torrents), so I'm basically useless now."
,jerrylee16,2011-08-06T20:27Z,"It's okay, I'll seed in your place for now, I've also managed to divide the episodes individually as best as i can if that's okay with you"
,Dante8411,2011-08-06T22:57Z,"Oh, yeah, by all means. I would have seeded the entire disk, but there was just too much bulk for the formatting. I just want to help keep Nightmare Ned alive."
,jerrylee16,2011-08-07T00:42Z,"I actually only saw some episodes online for the first time but i thought it was brilliant, don't mind me asking but where did you buy that DVD from please"
,Dante8411,2011-08-09T23:18Z,"Like I said, I really doubt there are any other DVDs out there. If memory serves, I got this one from a guy named Pepe in exchange for a SNES game online. I really hope that one day Disney releases a series collection."
,mariahd,2011-10-18T07:13Z,"i would like to thank you, because i was seriously doubting my sanity after not being able to find a single other person who knew what the hell i was talking about when i mentioned nightmare ned (besides obvious references to the pc game). 
MADE MY DAY!"
,Dante8411,2011-11-06T19:11Z,I'll encourage everyone who has the eps now to seed. My internet is severely crippled as I live in isolation and cannot seed faster than 10 kb/s.
,Dante8411,2011-11-07T22:57Z,"I'm serious, this NEEDS seeders. It will take weeks for anyone to get the complete thing with only me seeding, and that's without the matter that I turn off my computer at night. These are weeks I spend with my internet even slower than usual."
,Dante8411,2011-11-11T01:32Z,"And now my internet refuses to seed anything. I am ltierally doing all that I can, here. Come on, I know there are others who have the torrent out there!"
,Dante8411,2011-11-17T15:50Z,"I'm so sick of seeing the available copies creep up to 2 and then the second it should reach it, jump down to 1.3. I KNOW people are stopping the second they get it, and it's really making life hard for me. I may just stop seeding myself, because I kind of miss having a functional internet and I'm currently only putting out 2 kb/s. Another seeder could get done in a few hours what I'm lowering my quality of life for for weeks."
,Dante8411,2011-11-18T18:03Z,"That's it. From now on, I'm pausing the seeding whenever it's obstructing me."
,vigilantis,2012-01-13T09:27Z,"Dante are you still here?
Are you still seeding this?
I'd love to have it if possible
Thanks"
,vigilantis,2012-01-14T20:03Z,"Thanks for posting this!
I haven't seen this in years brings back memories
I'll seed it for awhile"
,Dante8411,2012-01-21T22:53Z,"Thanks. Seeding is a big help, because my internet's far too slow to do it well."
,Dante8411,2012-02-13T22:00Z,"Since the new uTorrent came out, I can seed slightly better, but I'm still hardly reliable as the sole source."
