Nightmare Ned is an old Disney series that has been so forsaken that its entirely possible these episodes are all that remains of it.
Since I know pitifully little about video tweaking, you will probably need VLC Media Player to run these files, and they are in clumps of as much data as possible, rather than individual episodes. Theyre also in fairly sketchy condition because the DVDs just a home recording/bootleg.

Bottom Line: This is an awesome old TV series and if you want to watch it, this torrent is your best bet.
