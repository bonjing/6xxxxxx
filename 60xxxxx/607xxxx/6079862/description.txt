Without a doubt The Isley Brothers were one of Motown's underrated but talented acts who turned out to be far more popular here in the UK than their homeland thanks to the tireless campaigning of radio disc jockeys and legions of fans.
Hailing from Cincinnati, US and born between the late 1930's and early 1940's, Rudolph, O'Kelly and Ronald Isley began their careers as many fellow soul singers did by singing gospel in their home town accompanied by their brother Vernon who was unfortunately killed in an auto accident in 1957.
The Isley Brothers offically signed to Motown in 1965 but departed in 1968. Although their stay was brief the sophistication of the music recorded under the wing of prolific production and writing team Holland, Dozier, Holland later established them as one of Motown's finest and most influential acts. 
This stomping 2CD Anthology chronicles all their early hits such as the club anthem 'This Old Heart Of Mine' which charted in US and UK as well 'I Guess I'll Always Love You', 'Put Yourself In My Place' a newly discovered unreleased track 'Sure Is A Whole Lotta Woman' as well as an array of B-Sides, alternative & stereo mixes all restored from original mono LP tapes.
