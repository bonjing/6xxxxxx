,HORRORTEAM-BG,2011-01-03T10:09Z,Is that uncut version or previous Korean cut?

I'm primarily interested in knowing whether the audio is legit 5.1, or a convert from the 2.0 BR rip."
,cinesimon,2011-01-25T22:42Z,"I just downloaded this - there's a watermark in the middle of the image throughout the goddamn film. Luckily it's very faint, but it will annoy most people I believe. 
The audio is obviously converted from 2.0 to 5.1 - if you turn your system from 5.1 to stereo you loose nothing: no effects, no dialog. Meaning, it's not real 5.1 audio, but 2.0 put through a converter.
Thanks for selling my ISP another 4.36 gig, uploader!"
,cinesimon,2011-02-17T05:13Z,Actually I was wrong about the watermark; there is none and the image is good. But the audio certainly IS only stereo converted to 5.1. AKA fake surround sound.
