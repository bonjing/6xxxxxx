This pack includes 100% official Bemanis simfiles from DDR 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd Plus, 4th, 4th Plus, 5th, 6th(Max), 7th(Max2), and 8th(Extreme).  I had thought about including SuperNova, but it alone would've been 500+mb and it has a lot of songs from previous games, however if you're interested, you can download them from www.ddrspain.com, which is the same place I got all these. 

P.S. It's listed as Dancing Stage SuperNova since that's the name of the European release.  It has all the same songs as the US DDR SuperNova.

P.P.S. There were a few songs that weren't right, so I fixed them.  Fixed songs came from www.zenius-i-vanisher.com.
