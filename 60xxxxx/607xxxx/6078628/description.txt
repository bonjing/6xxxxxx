Moy Yat Mini Biography

One of Yip Manâ€™s closest students, whom he was first introduced to in 1957. For 15 years, Moy Yat kept a close 
relationship with Yip Man, living the â€œKung Fu Life.â€ It was at this time that he learned from Yip Man the 
principles and deeper aspects of Ving Tsun. Never far from Yip Manâ€™s side, Moy Yat eventually developed into 
one of his top students.
In 1973 Moy Yat came to the United States where he began teaching kung fu in New York City. Moy Yat followed 
his sifuâ€™s example and used the same method to teach his own students. He instilled upon his students the 
importance of â€œKung Fu Life,â€ the use of the Ving Tsun principles in everyday life. He always said that Ving Tsun 
Kung Fu can best be learned outside the classroom. This is how Ving Tsun, as taught by Yip Man, is learned. 
To his last days, Master Moy Yat lived his life very much in this way, spending his time living and teaching 
Ving Tsun through â€œKung Fu Life.â€

Moy Yat is well respected, as a kung fu teacher and as an accomplished artist. His paintings, calligraphy and 
stone carvings can be seen throughout his Chinatown school, as well as in art shows which were held regularly 
in the city. He also carved some of the Wing Chun Kuit Kuit into stone.

The Moy Yat Kung Fu Family is quite extensive, with students throughout the world spreading the art of Ving Tsun. 
His disciples are teaching Ving Tsun in their own schools throughout the United States and around the world, 
with schools as far reaching as Canada, Brazil, and Mexico.
