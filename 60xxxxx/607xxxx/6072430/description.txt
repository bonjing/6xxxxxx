Editorial Reviews

Off the Record is not a full-length performance of the classic musical Guys and Dolls, but rather a 55-minute documentary about the making of the studio recording by the cast of the smash 1992 revival. Featured are complete takes of such all-time favorite songs as "Fugue for Tinhorns," "Adelaide's Lament," "Sue Me," "The Oldest Established," and "Luck Be a Lady." Especially thrilling are the company numbers, including one of Broadway's greatest showstoppers, "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat." In addition to the music, director Jerry Zaks and musical director Edward Strauss offer coaching on the harder numbers (we thankfully see only two of the first 129 takes of "My Time of Day"), and stars Peter Gallagher, Josie de Guzman, Nathan Lane, and Faith Prince offer commentary on the show and their characters. This video does a terrific job of capturing the excitement, tension, and energy of the studio and is a lot of fun for anyone who enjoys Broadway cast recordings. --David Horiuchi
