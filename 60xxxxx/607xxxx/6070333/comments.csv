Although when following the instructions it says to choose the trial version when first installing. Well this did not work for me as when I pressed purchase it opened the online store. Instead I did this:

1. Disconnect from the internet and run installer.
2. Select commercial license and enter key: 11111-11111-11111-1111X 
3: It will say the key isn't able to be verified and asks you to select the .key file manually by clicking browse and opening the Serial-Keys folder and selecting KIS11-EN By-[Treystar].key

If you have the same issues as me just follow those simple instructions. Great upload!"
