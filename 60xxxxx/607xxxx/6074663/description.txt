Known as "King Larry," Hoover, along with rival gang leader David Barksdale, decided to merge their gangs into one: the Gangster Disciple Nation. In 1969, after Barksdale was killed in a shooting, Hoover took the reins of the Gangster Disciples, which now had control of Chicago's South Side. Under Hoover's rule, the Gangster Disciples took over the South Side drug trade, making more than $1,000 a day in profits.
