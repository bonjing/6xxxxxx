For years one of the biggest problems we've had is who to let test our development versions of the game. People feel left out, leak our files, and generally there's this undercurrent of drama about the whole thing. Even more embarrassing is that we still miss bugs, almost in direct proportion to how big the release is.

So! We're doing things differently now. The next version of Urban Terror is going to go through a public alpha cycle, so anyone who is brave enough to join the adventure will be able to do so.

A Warning, though. This is an Win32 ALPHA build with brand new engine technology, so there will be lots of problems and it simply might not run on some computers. We also do not have our MAC and Linux builds done, or have the passport integration or anticheat ready to go. Stuff is broken and alot of the art is placeholder.

alert Further Disclaimer: This is NOT a replacement for Urban Terror 4.1 and is to be used at your own risk. Your PC might explode, catch fire, and cause your cows to stop giving milk. This is not a stable build ready for league use.

We've set up a forum to gather issues, and our team will be promoting stuff to our internal bug tracker as it comes up. If you like bugs, try this alpha build, read the readme file and follow its instructions.

Consider it an adventure.
