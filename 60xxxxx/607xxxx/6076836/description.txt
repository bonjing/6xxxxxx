      A celebration of the life and times of the actor Gerard
      Kelly, with contributions from his friends and colleagues.
      Gerard's career spanned nearly 40 years starting in 1973 at the
      age of fourteen, moved on to the hapless Willie Melvin in City
      Lights and culminated with the fabulous, outrageous Bunny in
      Extras. Among those appearing will be Richard Wilson, David
      Hayman, Les Dennis, Andy Gray, Jonathan Watson and Elaine C
      Smith.
