,robbers,2010-12-30T10:25Z,"ok, w !!... tf ... :| this is ""Key Party"" ... en francais (that's french, for french)

i have been searching high and low, on more than several occasions (mostly when the frustration-laden ""fuckthisnoise!!"" feelings rise up) for a valid torrent for this movie and have been utterly bewildered by the complete and total lack of its existence on the webs collective databases.

or, to speak 'more clearly' (thank you FZ) there is an remarkable absence of any substantial torrents (ones where there are actually seeders still online) to be had.

i browsed upon this listing today, and not immediately recognizing box covers while running the autopilot-of-life this afternoon, i mindlessly thought to myself, 'i'll see what this actually is later, once it's finished.""

fmylife.

any one got a line on a valid torrent for this one ?? i absolutely hate to get stonewalled on something like this, when it's simply just circumstance. just my dumb, blind (un)luck.

now, all that being said, it's not really THAT big of a deal to me.

i want it because it's been so unattainable for me (i know, lifes parallels abound), and this is like a slapin the face.

it's the principle of it all.

fucking universe (ok, ok !! i'm done)."
