    Upon taking her vows to become a nun, Sister Sarah is abused,            
    brainwashed and drugged into submission by the corrupt clergy. On the    
    verge of death from a lethal dose of drugs, Sister Sarah receives a      
    message from GOD telling her to take vengeance on all those who did      
    her wrong. Armed with God's will and an arsenal of big guns, she         
    dispenses Judgment Day on her former tormentors. When the church         
    hires the merciless motorcycle gang the "Los Muertos" to track down      
    and kill her they soon realize that this SISTER IS ONE BAD MOTHER.
