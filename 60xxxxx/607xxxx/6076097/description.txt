Don't get me wrong, I love Bob Marley. But outside of Jamaica, it seems like all anyone knows of reggae is Bob Marley. With "Burnin'" we get The Wailers, with Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer comprising the band. I always prefer bands to solo acts, and though Bob kept the Wailers name alive after he split with Tosh and Bunny, it was really just Bob and a backing group. With the Wailers, you get different voices (literally and figuratively) and different perspectives. And I always preferred male backing vocals for reggae (as opposed to Bob's later use of female vocals). 

But as for the album -- the songs are great. "Put It On," "Small Axe," "Duppy Conqueror" and "Rastaman Chant" are all favorites of mine, and for those who like the bigger hits, you'll find "I Shot the Sheriff" and "Get Up Stand Up" on there as well. The album is simply a classic, and anyone who claims to like reggae needs this CD in their collection (and should probably branch out from the Marley tree and check out other reggae acts like Jimmy Cliff, Toots and the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, et al.). If you don't have this one, buy it!
