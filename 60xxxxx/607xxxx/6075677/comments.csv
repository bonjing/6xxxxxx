[T],rjordan21,2011-01-01T03:43Z,Incredible posting....... If I read your description correctly though... why would you re-encode MP3 to FLAC?  There's no benefit and a waste of HD space however inconsequential.

I didn't do it to upload it here. I did it all for my personal use, then decided to up the whole works here. Enjoy it."
