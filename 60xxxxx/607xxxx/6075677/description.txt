This is a 15 CD compilation of mostly early U2 interviews. There is one CD from 1987 and one from 1992/93 but the rest are 1986 and before.
They are sourced from different downloads. Some Mp3, some FLAC. This file is all FLAC. I do not do Mp3. 
I put them in chronological order the best I could, altho it is not always possible to determine the exact date. 
There is no music included, only talking. Text files of what is on each are included, except for the first CD. Not sure what happened there.
This is undoubtedly not every interview from that period, but it can certainly act as a base for compiling such a collection. 
I hope you enjoy them, altho you'll be sick of hearing them talk by the end, no doubt.
