,Klazik,2011-03-09T11:58Z,"Just a request to all uploaders of movies:

When you upload a movie and with a link to imdb, could you also put in a link to Rotten Tomatoes? I feel that imdb's ratings are sometimes far off from factual. And to date Rotten Tomatoes has been spot on about 90% of the time.

TL:DR - Post links to Rotten Tomatoes as well as IMBD"
