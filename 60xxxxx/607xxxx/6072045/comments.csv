,myes,2011-01-20T04:38Z,"hi i'm new to this so sorry if it's a dumb question. 1buck50 do you mean not to download the crack that comes from this specific download or the additional crack it suggest you download within the text document that comes with this download?

I'm also asking this because i'v downloaded this and attempted to use the crack within the archicad folder but it does not work. i get 2 buttons to press either a padlock or a circle with a dash through it, the circle shuts the crack down and the padlock lets me choose a file from the computer - i'm guessing this is where it replaces the archicad14.exe file? however when i select this file and continue to click ""open"" it does not do anything or give me further options and in the crack window where it had previously said ""engine is very proud to present..."" it now says ""oops big error""

any help or advice with this would be VERY appretiated, thanks in advance"
,osirisgothra,2011-01-23T06:05Z,"download the other one, if you are looking for x32 version, it works 100%"
,tzuik,2011-02-09T13:44Z,"Sure download the other one, it sends u to a hosting server and when u download it it says it's also with virus. Some backdoor trojan, my Bitdefender discovered it instantly."
,dr-johan,2011-02-19T15:45Z,"So, no crack included, just a text file, presumably with a link.

What a bastard..."
,mrBeastxxx,2011-03-01T20:57Z,this works. follow the link for the crack in the textfile and download it. install archicad an read the text in the crack . copy the crack file to the dir and run it . click the lock and it patches like a charm . 
,kal6,2011-03-12T04:44Z,"Trojan in the crack (you can check it with virustotal, I did it)"
,Helga123,2011-04-22T09:57Z,"mrBeastxxx, could you give an exact description of the process you went through to get the program running, I've tried , but no luck. Any help much appreciated"
,valcsicsi,2011-05-06T16:26Z,"the crack is a piece of shit
could anybody tell, what to do, if i have win7 64bit, i istalled this AC14, but none of the existing keygens works? 
thanks"
,Mudstomper,2011-05-30T04:29Z,"Ok so you guys nearly put me off this but I'm glad I checked it out for myself. 

Confirmed working %100 -Archicad 64 bit on Win7.

Install as per the instructions in the ENGiNE folder contained within the ISO.

Open ISO using Daemon etc
Install Archicad 14, Choose i have a dongle and select wibukey

Download the crack as per the text document... (which I also scanned using ESET and it came back as clean and it worked fine also since scanned my computer which is clean and behaving properly, otherwise just find yourself another one?)

Copy crack to the archicad.exe folder
""RUN AS ADMIN"" in Win7 64 bit , push the padlock button to patch. 

If you don't run as admin it wont find the file otherwise its not rocket science.

Am I right in guessing that some antivirus software read all cracks as a virus? Seems to be the same old post for any torrent that contains a crack?

Thanx kisesizimben +1 from me."
