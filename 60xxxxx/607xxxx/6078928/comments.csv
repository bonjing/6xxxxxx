,porky2017,2011-01-03T03:09Z,they want me to get 1 year subscription..
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-03T10:16Z,What? It's suppose to be 1 year forward? 
,firstfjs,2011-01-03T14:54Z,"Try This: Here's how to keep this software up to date forever, or at least for over a year.
This works for version 11 and probably will work for other versions.
I assume you have NAV installed and have updated it once and it shows a Subscription Expiration Date in the Statistics section of the main window.
1. Open Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access
2. Click on Show Keychains in the lower left corner.
3. Select the Symantec keychain.
4. Select the keys in this keychain and delete them, but do not delete the keychain itself.
5. Open NAV and check the Subscription Expiration Date. It should now say Unknown and should stay that way even after you update.

Make sure to do this before your expiration date expires because this hack may not work after it expires. Also make sure to allow NAV any and all connections to the internet with Little Snitch. NAV noes not phone home to check registration or other nastiness."

,PixelSmash,2011-07-16T17:08Z,"Hey, Just thought I'd Share, if anyone uses LittleSnitch or similar, if you block the outgoing ""connection via curl"" while updating it will continue to download recent updates and enable auto-protect.

My copy expired a month ago and I am still able to update mine. 

Cheers!"
,abtean,2011-07-22T00:07Z,Does not work on Lion no more as it is a powerPC and those types of applications are no longer supported in lion
,spewy,2011-09-21T16:01Z,"Just installed on 10.5, used Little Snitch to block all communication via CURL but allowed all communication via Liveupdate. I had an issue with Liveupdate having errors so I had to manually download a newer version (google it). After that the virus definitions worked and the subscription date has been kept as 'N/A'."
,Loayajailat,2012-01-16T14:27Z,"@Cyberpiraten Can you upload the 2012 version ?
