Encoders Notes:
Well imagine kindly let me have the avi they got sent.
So i made a avs script to crop & re-size.
I dropped that into vdubmod & i increased the brightness & contrast.
Then i lowered the saturation & changed the colours with a rgb eq.
Finaly i sharpened it.
Its not the best screener but i have seen worse.
Some parts can be very good but in others it goes a bit blurry.
The audio is prety good.
Its deffinatley watchable & better than a ts.
Its realy late because i fell asleep while it was uploading to the seedbox.
Enjoy another Kingdom Release
