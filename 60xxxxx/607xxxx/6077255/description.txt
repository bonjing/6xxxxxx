America is an American folk rock band, composed originally of members Gerry Beckley, Dewey Bunnell, and Dan Peek. The three members were barely past their teenage years when they became a musical sensation during 1972, scoring #1 hits and winning a Grammy for best new musical artist. Their recording success was almost entirely throughout the 1970s; some of the band's best known songs are "A Horse with No Name", "Sister Golden Hair" (both of which reached #1), "Ventura Highway", "Tin Man", "Daisy Jane", and "Lonely People".
Some of the band's singles and albums were successful commercially, and they attracted the services of The Beatles' producer, George Martin, for a series of seven albums.
The band suffered a heavy blow when Dan Peek quit the group in 1977, right at its apex, but Beckley and Bunnell returned America to the top 10 as a duo with "You Can Do Magic" in 1982. Continuing to tour, America maintains a loyal fan base and performs over 100 shows per year. 


**** [Greatest] CDRips 2011 [Bubanee]
Will be CDRips from myself or other known 'Private Uploaders' 
There will be NO TRANSCODED MP3s in any of these Collections.. 
These Collections will not be proper albums due to the fact that most 
'Greatest Hits' contain not only the greatest hits but other added Music to 
round out the album.. 
My aim is to remove the Music or non popular songs of that particular 
Artist/Band and leave the good stuff! (Hope my Judgement is good, hey.. lol)
So some will contain not many songs where others will contain more! and 
remember they will be once only CDRips, nothing but the best. Because that's 
what you deserve.. 

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
