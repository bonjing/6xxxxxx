,Lickety_Split,2011-02-06T10:38Z,Episode 10 the hunted is mislabeled and is really episode 11 called playthings. i was watching a few episodes at a time and wondering why when i got to episode 21 opening recap i never seen gordon talk about psychics fighting in a war. great quality though.
,Lickety_Split,2011-02-06T10:49Z,so to be clear episode 10 is missing and episode 11 is on here twice.
