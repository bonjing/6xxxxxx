Tagline: The world was watching in 1972 as 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. This is the story of what happened next.

Storyline:

After Black September's assassination of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972, Prime Minister Golda Meir okays a black-box operation to hunt down and kill all involved. 
A team of five gathers in Switzerland led by Avner, a low-level Mossad techie whose father was a war hero and whose wife is pregnant. 
It's an expendable team, but relying on paid informants, they track and kill several in Europe and Lebanon. 
They must constantly look over their shoulders for the CIA, KGB, PLO, and their own sources. 
As the body count mounts -- with retribution following retribution -- so do questions, doubts, and sleepless nights. 
Loyalties blur. What does it mean to be a Jew?

NOTES: For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
I'll ask everybody to stop with the "it doesn't work","it's out of sync" comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
