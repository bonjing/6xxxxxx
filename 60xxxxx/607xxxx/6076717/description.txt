La Nuit de la VÃ©ritÃ© is situated in an imaginary West African country.

But not everyone is in favor of peace and one can feel the tension. The night of truth starts with a festive dinner, but the village idiot Tomoto always seems capable of ruining the attempts for peace with violence and provocation. Written by spijker_nl
