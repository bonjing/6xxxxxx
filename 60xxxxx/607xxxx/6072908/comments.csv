,ODBC,2011-02-19T13:08Z,"YIFI, first of all, thank you for sharing, and I like many others appreciate your hard work with all this and other movies.

But it must be said that these movies are compressed so heavily and thus pixelated and marred by motion artifacts and blurring, that it is not suited for movie buffs and archivists, but rather for people who have low speed internet access.

Just saying."
,Prayaag,2011-02-26T21:51Z,"Dear YIFY,
 Can you please do the ROCKY movies, all of 'em???"
,ArmyMike2010.,2011-04-09T16:03Z,"As someone knew to PB and torrents, I wanna thank you for what you do. Im getting ready to deploy to Afghanistan and enjoy your uploads. 

Cheers!
Mike"
,columbuzz,2011-04-09T20:04Z,"So ArmyMike.....must be feeling like Rambo already...getting ready to be deployed to Afghanistan....Bravo...good luck with killing defenseless afghans in their own country (did I heard Talibans) on the name of Freedom and Democracy...and btw, keep in mind...Tyrants are not immortals and Tyranny has a short life...!"
,Kb1325,2011-05-22T03:50Z,"I am a fan of your uploads... but 350 mb size for the first 2, those are the best out of this quadrilogy, they should've been more around 500/600MB... But I suppose i'll take them and replace them when another rip comes out. Thanks for ur time spent on these."
,mw2pro123,2011-07-08T20:03Z,"thank you so much, amazing torrent "
,nala123,2011-07-28T10:23Z,thanks!
,abj642,2011-10-09T11:31Z,thanks YIFY
,bhuggawan,2011-10-26T07:20Z,"My thanks to YIFY-group but gotta be honest..this is pure waste to download. The compression blocks are visible through-out.
+1 for small filesize though, might come in handy in some cases."
,MRd3adguy,2012-02-15T21:44Z,"@ Columbuzz

Go suck Allah's cum out of Mohamed's faggot ass. "
,MRd3adguy,2012-02-16T21:31Z,"Besides that if you were up to speed about your Rambo movies you'd have caught the irony of your statement. Rambo was helping the Afghans in RIII. So....I'm sure this guy DOES feel like Rambo. Every terrorist fuck that he kills is helping the ""good"" people of Afghanistan get closer to democracy. Ass clown. Go put your helmet back on. "
