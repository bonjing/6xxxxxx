I love the look of old pictures. You know the ones, stuffed in your great aunt's picture albums with the padded vinyl cover and stuck to the black pages with paper corners and smelling of musty old paper, moth balls and ancient emulsion. Half of them are all creased and you don't know whose in them but the color looks all weird, like, not real like you see with your eyes when you look outside or just around the room for that matter. Time fades the color, changes it, like old Kodachrome slides forgotten in some bottom drawer.

Maya is a genius. Talking to Maya is talking to someone whose lights are all on. She is amazingly intelligent and has the ability to either solve great problems of thought and science, or win a million dollars on Jeopardy. I'd bet on Jeopardy because she seems to like modeling alot more than solving math problems. Personally, I'd enjoy the math more, but that's why I work on my side of the camera. Maya's got some great antique jewelry that matches well with her sophisticated style. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in natural ability, but hey...she's smart. Driving is another matter though. Maya's a genius, but I wouldn't get in a car with her behind the wheel.
