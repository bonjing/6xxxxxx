,gs242656,2011-01-02T20:30Z,The subtitles included in this torrent are not for the Extended Cut but for the normal version and consequently are wrong. Can someone please post or direct to a link for the correct subtitles. Thank you

This torrent is no good to you unless someone can post the correct eng subs, Or unless you speak swedish. "

,dundeekopite,2011-06-13T00:10Z,"this is the link for the correct subs file

,themorningstar69,2011-07-21T22:33Z,"Subscene has the extended subs.  Search The girl who kicked the hornets nest, it brings up like 22 results, one of the english ones that is ""green"" for ""good quality"" is extended version.  Clicking on these will also have the note from provider that these are for the extended version.  I have downloaded this way for the first two extended films from the same site and same person and they work wonderful, sync up and well translated. Downloads a rare file that opens to a 135kb srt.  Cheers everyone"

,mmkremer,2011-07-25T17:07Z,"following the morningstar69's tip, I could find the english subs for this version at http://subscene.com/english/The-Girl-Who-Kicked-the-Hornets-Nest-Uftkastellet-Der-Blev-Sprngt-Luftslottet-som-sprngdes-Millennium-Part-3/subtitle-439585.aspx

the file doesn't have the same name as the movie, but it works like a charm."
