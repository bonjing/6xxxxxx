Notes: Not content to rest on his laurels, and on the heals of his critically acclaimed 2008 release â€œThe Wonky Yearsâ€, and the moving finger style guitar work on his 2005 release â€œClown Riverâ€, Rick Taylor has returned home; to the blues. This gritty solo collection of 11 songs is recorded in the spirit of the 20â€™s and 50â€™s blues masters. It covers the road from Mississippi to Chicago in a stirring tribute to the roots of the music that has driven pop music for decades. With a bourbon stained voice that sounds as if it could be coming through the torn radio speaker of a 1927 Buick, Lucky Room was recorded on vintage acoustic and electric guitars and amplifiers. Close your eyes and you will find yourself sitting at a table in a juke joint, somewhere along Highway 61.
