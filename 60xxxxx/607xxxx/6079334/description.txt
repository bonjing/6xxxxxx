Very HQ rare promo music video. "Last Train to London" is the fifth track from the Electric Light Orchestra album Discovery.

The song was released in 1980 in the UK as a double A-side single with "Confusion". It peaked at #8 in the UK Singles Chart. However, in the US the two songs charted separately, with "Confusion" charting in late 1979, followed by "Last Train to London" in early 1980. It peaked at #39 in the Billboard Hot 100. In Spain the single was released with the Spanish title "Ultimo tren a Londres".

Electric Light Orchestra (ELO) were a British rock group from Birmingham, who released eleven studio albums between 1971 and 1986 and another album in 2001. ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.
