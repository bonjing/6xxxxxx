      Why is the tallest building on earth less than half a mile
      high? Why don't we have mountains as tall as those on Mars? In
      the last of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Mark Miodownik
      investigates the world of the very big and very tall. He reveals
      that, at this scale, everything is governed by a battle with one
      of the strangest forces in the universe - gravity. With help
      from acrobats, levitation devices, spiders, birthday cake
      candles and even some sticky goo, Mark discovers how gravity can
      make solid rock behave like a liquid and investigates whether
      one day it might be possible to build a structure from Earth
      into space, taking us beyond the reach of gravity without the
      use of rocket.
