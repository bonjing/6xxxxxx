Serial Mom (1994)

Director: John Waters

Serial Mom is a 1994 American satirical comedy film written and directed by John Waters, starring Kathleen Turner as the titular character, Sam Waterston as her husband, and Ricki Lake and Matthew Lillard as her daughter and son. Despite statements to the contrary in the movie, the story is completely fictional. Patty Hearst, Suzanne Somers, Joan Rivers, Traci Lords and Brigid Berlin make cameo appearances in the film.

Movies by Waters' creative influences, including Russ Meyer, Otto Preminger, William Castle, and Herschell Gordon Lewis, are seen playing on television sets throughout the film.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival.

Though the beginning of the movie says that everything in it is true, when questioned John Waters said he made it up, as a gag.

The films which Waters made in the eighties and early ninetes, such as Hairspray and Cry-Baby, were slightly less harsh-edged than his eadiest work. In Serial Mom, he harks back in terms of violence to those earliest projects, although in other ways he moves more directly towards the commercial mainstream. Serial Mom particularly recalls Multiple Maniacs, which was inspired by the Sharon Tate murder and featured Divine as a mass murderer who dailies en route to damnation with a perverted nun. No Divine this time, but rather Kathleen Turner as an apparently immaculate mother and housekeeper who, as the title suggests, has latent psychotic tendencies.

As it has in common with his earliest films a tendency towards grotesquely and blackly humorous murders, Serial Mom matches Water's more recent work in terms of being slick and stylish. Turner is good as a sort of twisted Hyacinth Bucket with teeth, and the usual catchy sound track of Water's films adds to the fun. Waters, in some ways a Russ Meyer sans mammary obsession, here largely succeeds in marrying the style of his 1980s and 90s films with the carnal excess of his 70s work if somewhat toned down.

Great (if dark) fun.

When using TPB please read these important notes:
  
01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of 
    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to 
    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust
    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. 
    
02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.

03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause
    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.

04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow 
    apps & malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.

05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is
    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull & Crossbones icon are trusted.

06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously
    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.

07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.
  
08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and
    positive comments.

09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.

10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result
    in getting banned from TPB!
