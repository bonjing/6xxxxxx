Guess it's just another game I'll have to experiment with using PAL->NTSC YFix Patcher by JayteeMaster


Can someone PLEEAAASE upload ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona""? I cannot find that game ANYWHERE; the only one here at TPB is useless, no seeds (occasionally there is one, but it never connects to any of the several peers trying to download) even using magnet link with DHT, Local Peer Discovery, Peer Exchange and UDP all enabled.

Please, someone, anyone...please please PLEASE upload ""NASCAR Dirt to Daytona"" :( "
