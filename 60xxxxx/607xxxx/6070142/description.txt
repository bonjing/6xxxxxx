           The Muppets celebrate the life of their creator in        
         The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson. The special takes         
         us behind the scenes as the Muppets put together an         
         off-beat, but touching tribute to the man whose             
         legacy of love and laughter lives on through the            
         many characters he created.                                 
                                                                     
           Although they're not quite sure exactly who Henson        
         is, the Muppets explore his life by watching classic        
         and rare film clips. As the Muppets learn more about        
         Henson through his work, so do we. Special guests           
         Harry Belafonte, Carol Burnett, John Denver, Frank          
         Oz and Steven Spielberg offer their own remembrances        
         of Henson, who passed away unexpectedly on May 16,          
         1990.

           Most advent calendars end on December 24, but not         
         FLAiR's! Yesterday we released the rare footage of          
         Jim's NYC memorial service, and we just don't have          
         the heart to wrap this up on a sad note. Instead,           
         we give you a bonus day and a bonus title with The          
         Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson.                               
                                                                     
           During the 6 months that had passed since Jim             
         tragically died, there had been a lot of speculation        
         about what was going to happen to The Muppets, to           
         the company (the deal with Disney had fallen through        
         since his death), to the many universes that Jim            
         had created. This special served both to show the           
         fans that his legacy would go on, but importantly,          
         to honor Jim, his life, and his amazing career of           
         35 years. It's in many ways a sad tribute, but at           
         the same time a very sweet and heart-warming                
         retrospective of his life, all the while remaining          
         true to the Muppet spirit, and staying silly. A             
         lot of characters had to be recast in a way that            
         had never happened before, but sadly would happen           
         again just 2 years later when Richard Hunt died.            
         Steve Whitmire, who would take over iconic Kermit           
         (and who shares his birthday with Jim), has later           
         recounted just how nervous he was trying to fill            
         the biggest shoes in Muppet history. As a Family            
         Guy reference many years later would allude to;             
         "..now we have funny sounding Muppets", yet everyone        
         pitched in to show that the death of Jim would not          
         spell the end of The Muppets.                               
                                                                     
           The special ends with a truly massive all hands           
         on deck scene, featuring an impressive number of            
         Muppets, Fraggles and Sesame Street characters all          
         singing Just One Person together.                           
                                                                     
           To also wrap up the many extras we have included          
         during this calendar, we've thrown in one last one          
         for you. Jerry Juhl, the longest serving writer for         
         Henson, the second employee of the company (not             
         counting Jim's wife Jane), and perhaps the single           
         most important person in shaping the character of           
         The Muppets outside of Jim, died on September 26,           
         2005 from a brief battle with cancer. In A Special          
         Tribute to Jerry Juhl, his co-workers and friends           
         are interviewed about his neverending creativity            
         through the decades, as well as his generosity              
         in writing and being. It also includes a clip of            
         the Muppet performance at his memorial service.             
                                                                     
           We hope you've enjoyed this calendar, and keep            
         in mind that while most of the titles we have               
         presented are things that are either out of print,          
         have never been released on DVD or have never been          
         released on home video at all, there's still a              
         plethora of Henson material available for purchase.         
         While we await digital releases, why not check out          
         some of the many other Henson titles out there -            
         you might help fund the upcoming Fraggle feature            
         film!

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.     
                                                 
                    Sit back and join us as we go looking      
                  for the rainbow connection, and remember    
               to check back daily. We'll be listing them     
                       here as we go!
