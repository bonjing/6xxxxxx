What I (and I think I'm not the only one) think is one of the best trip-hop albums after 2000. It has the glow of a "classic" without being cookie cutter trip-hop, it is actually a fully-fleshed evolution with the key word being "atmosphere". The influence of dream pop and ambient have worked as a charm. Their other albums are also highly recommended, although the next one after On Black Peak, The Thrill of Fresh Paint, sounds even less like trip-hop...
There are two different issues of this album, one of which has track 12 Ghost Dance, and another one has instead Bluebird. I've included both tracks.
