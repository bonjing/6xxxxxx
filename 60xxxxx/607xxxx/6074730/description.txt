There's no denying it, this album has everything for the discerning [and even the not-sodiscerning]
listener, from the classics that everyone should recognize, such as BTO's 'You
ain't seen nothing yet', Thin Lizzys 'The boys are back in town' [my personal favourite] and
Steppenwolf's undeniably great 'Born to be wild', all the way up to the more modern classics,
like G'n'R's 'Paradise City' and Stiltskin with 'Inside'. Even if you would never class yourself as
a rock fan, this album has such an eclectic range of rock stylings, that there's bound to be
something there that everyone will enjoy. You want something heavy? Try the Motorhead and
Black Sabbath tracks at the end of disc one. You want something a bit lighter? Look no
further than the excellent Genesis, Kinks or Yes tracks. The only thing which slightly mars this
album for me is the addition of Tina Turner's 'Simply the best'. Whilst I am willing to
[reluctantly] admit that yes, this IS a rock track, I would never say it was one of the best rock
tracks ever made. Still, you can't fault a CD with 37 classic tracks and 1 dud. Thoroughly
recommended to the rock fan and non-rock fan alike.
