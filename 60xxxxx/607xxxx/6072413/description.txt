This is a little slide guitar country jumble that is quite similar to the likes of Oh Susanna, only Tift's voice is not as strong but it's perhaps prettier and less forceful.  She is one of those artists that if I heard singing in the back of the bar, it would draw me right over.  The songs weren't the greatest which was likely her biggest downfall, another small setback was the fact that at times it was too ornate and the music was overpowering her voice.  Tift is one of those artists that I'd love to hear sing acoustic, for her voice is capable of most anything effortlessly.  The end result is an ageless sounding country album that if better written could be a classic, but as is it's a good listen.
