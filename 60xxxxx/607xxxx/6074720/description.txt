Freedom Fields is a music album by Seth Lakeman published twice in 2006. It is his third album as a principal performer. It is named for a park in Plymouth, England, where the Sabbath Day Fight is commemorated.
This edition was released on 21 August 2006 under Lakeman's new record company, Relentless. There are a number of differences between the first and second editions of the album. The track listing is more or less the same, but with a slightly different order and the addition of the bonus track "Send Yourself Away", from his first album, The Punch Bowl. Two of the tracks, "Lady of the Sea (Hear Her Calling)" and "The White Hare" have been remixed. In addition the second edition does not include the bonus disc and the cover design is different from the previous edition.

The second edition charted at #32 in the UK Top 40 and at #19 in the HMV Album Chart on 29 August 2006.
