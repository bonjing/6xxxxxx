,Evil..Muffin,2011-01-19T20:33Z,Yeah you're right. It's very fast.
,Evil..Muffin,2011-01-19T21:40Z,"Ehm, when i start this game i get a weird skull background and these symbols, like éâäàêëèîì and such. Also there is a hitler-sign and a half-naked man. What does it mean?"
,Evil..Muffin,2011-01-19T22:21Z,"Ok i've managed to install it.
Everything looks just fine, exept for...
it's russian."
,Evil..Muffin,2011-01-19T22:26Z,Is there a way to change it into english?
,halfchalupa,2011-01-19T22:34Z,@ Evil..Muffin it means this guy is a fucking racist and to not download his shit. it may be a good torrent but i'll be damned if ima support this nazi fag.
,halfchalupa,2011-01-19T22:44Z,This stupid racist fuckwad keeps removing my comments about his racist programs with swastikas
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-01-21T12:31Z,"There are no rasists' signs. This thing is called ""Kolovrat"", which refers to Slavic peoples. Honestly, I couldn't find it on Nazi's flags, but I could find it on very ancient paintings.
The great part of Slavic history, you should know that.
As for naked man -- he is there for fun. And traditions as well. All no-steam clients from csmania.ru/no-steam.ru have got this man and something like the skull from 2004 or 2005."
,Doomrider1992,2011-02-19T14:07Z,"I've installed it, but I'm getting a runtime error when I try to run it, anyone else have that problem?"
,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-02-21T12:18Z,"Doomrider1992, anything runs normally, maybe you have DirectX or videocard driver broken?
And try to install this: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf"
,stang90,2011-02-27T02:47Z,Thiiiiis is episode 2.... thanks alot...
,herpadr4,2011-03-17T05:11Z,"Hey guys, if you want this in English, just type ""rus"" in the search bar in the overall directory and delete EVERYTHING that comes up. That did it for me and I'm playing it in English now.

Also, if you're having problems starting because of an error, try right clicking and choosing ""Run as Administrator."" Worked for me as well."
,herpadr4,2011-03-17T05:49Z,"Well, after playing a bit I realized only about half the characters speak English.. I tried finding their voice files but I could only find Russian, no English. So if you're fine with enemies speaking Russian, go ahead but otherwise find another torrent."
,Drugoh,2011-06-03T17:06Z,"herpadr4

I don't expect you or anyone else to reply to this, but steam reinstalls the russian files when you open the program. You cannot cancel it either. I basically typed ""rus"" into the searchbar inside the Half life 2 ep1 folder and deleted everything. Then steam reinstalls it when opening HL2EP1, without a cancel option. There has to be something in the folder that makes steam automatically install russian files... I hope someone could elaborate."
,Tomdog420,2011-08-17T21:42Z,"If you want it in English, one of the first screens you come across when installing the game you will see the same old symbols but there is 1 radial button with the word ""English"" right beside it, click on this before proceeding with the install."
,Powermad8,2011-09-03T22:40Z,"Thanks so much man! I haven't played or used this yet but I know it works because all your other ones work. You're the best, thanks for Portal, Half-Life, and all of the Half-Life 2 games!"
,Powermad8,2011-09-04T06:09Z,"Okay, I played this now. It works just fine for me. At first, the menu IS in Russian. This is easily fixed by going into program Files/Program Files (x86)>Half-Life2_Ep1>rev.txt and changing the word Russian with English in the Language setting. After this, Dr. Breen (that guy nobody cares about that's on all the monitors) and enemy voices will still be in Russian, but this doesn't matter because all main character voices are in English."
,Ertsu1,2011-09-25T10:45Z,"it says ""dont have permission to run episodic"""
,Vinneh2602,2011-10-29T00:57Z,Its RUSSIAN!!!THANKS FOR LETTING ME A GAME I CANT UNDERSTAND!

You can use subtitle to translate the russian voice.
(The subtitle is still english)
Open settings, audio, caption, subtitle"
