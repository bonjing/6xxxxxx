Description 
Life doesn't always go as planned...
A powerful, unflinching glimpse into the dark, bizarre world of the pornography industry. George C. Scott gives a strong, sensitive portrayal of a deeply religious Midwestern businessman whose daughter, while on a church-sponsored outing, runs away from home. He hires an oddball detective (Peter Boyle), who learns that the daughter has been making cheap sex films. When the father realizes that he can no longer trust the detective, he decides to hunt for his daughter himself. 
Posing as a porno film producer casting a new movie, he gathers clues with ferocious determination. His treacherous journey gives him a fast, hard lesson in big-city life and a close-up view of the world of porn, its victims and exploiters. Finally, with the help of a prostitute, he locates his daughter. But is it too late?
