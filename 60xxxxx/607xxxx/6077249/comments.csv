,UnseenBean,2011-01-02T18:47Z,"This claims to be a DVD screener rip, but it looks just like a cam job to me. If it is a screener, the rip is terrible. Most other screener rips look clean. This does not.

I DL'd another torrent claiming to be a screener and it looked just like this one, leading me to believe the source is the same.

That said, this copy going around may be the best there is right now, and if you've seen True Grit in theaters and want to see it again without paying 10+ bucks, might as well DL this. However, if you've not seen it yet, I think it's worth seeing in theaters first, 'cause this copy is kinda crappy."
