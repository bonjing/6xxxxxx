I found all your Triple J torrents very helpful as I am a BIG fan and am currently rebuilding (my computer died) my collection of Hottest 100s and Like a Versions.

I was hoping if you could get a hold of the Amaya Laucirica album and provide a torrent that would be awesome and if not I'll keep trying to find a torrent for it."
