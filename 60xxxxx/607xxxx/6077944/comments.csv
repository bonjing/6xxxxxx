A New York City ballet company is preparing for the production of Swan Lake, choosing to cast a newcomer as both the White and Black Swan. Dancer Nina Sayers (Portman) competes for the part alongside several other young dancers, including newcomer Lily (Kunis). Nina lives with her caring but overbearing mother Erica (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who tries to control much of Nina's life."
