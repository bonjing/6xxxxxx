,stilsjx,2011-01-03T02:52Z,"so the music is good, good sound quality, but I have two complaints.  
1.  NO TAGS = FAIL  
2. Saving each song as the album name, track name, track # etc.  creates file names that are too long for windows to accept, which creates truncated file names. = FAIL
Now admittedly, I don't know the first thing about initiating an UL, and I greatly appreciate the time you spent putting this together, but if you're going to spend any time at all, why not do it so it can be the best possible download available?  
I listened to it, and deleted it because I don't want to have to decipher your file names."
,Lithcore,2011-01-04T23:48Z,"@ stilsjx,

I, understand your point man, but that 'FAIL' as you say, goes to the orginal person who made the tracks....... when i got them they ha sno file names at all just nmbers i had to search for the real names, so you wanna BLAME someone blame them... this is the ultimate editon een beta and ghost tracks, if ya dont like it then STFU AND DOWNLOAD THE OTHER VERSIONS.


the Daft Punk tracks are orginal files names, so i dont know what the fuck your on about boy,


enjoy it or hate it, your call,


im just giving the people what they want AN AWESOME OST best one to date,

boo yah nigga !

,okto,2011-02-14T01:20Z,"You up shit with no tags and you have the audacity to act like you did anything?  Fuck you, lithcore.  You can't even bother to properly tag shit before you up it, you've got no place being proud of anything.  

""i create the awesome tron ost packages""
So you put files in a folder.  You're practically the Michaelangelo of warez. 
You didn't DO anything.
GTFO my internet, lamer."
,Lithcore,2011-02-19T01:36Z,"@ okto 

who the fuck do you think your talking to ? you silly little rat fucker,


what you see in this OST is an 'Ultimate Edition' put together by us, can you see anyone else doing this? have you even checked the files? yes there a mess tags all wrong etc this aint our doing blame the orginals.... you DUMB fuck, get an education you n00b,  i could not give a flying fuck if you dont like it or love it, the fact of the matter is, most of these tacks ARE VERY HARD to find, except the orginal OST of course..... we didn't see anyone else uploading all tracks in 1 file so we did it our self, and as we said we are just giving the people what they want an awesome ost,  you call us the Michaelangelo of warez ? LOL oh how i laugh thanks man i need a clown like you, and yes i am proud and i have the right nigga,

so why dont you GET THE FUCK OUT you silly little warez punk

,puppyup,2011-03-03T17:05Z,can you please provide a track list? Zip files suck.
,Abe Froman,2011-04-19T17:59Z,"Never use zip or rar files for music.  If this was just a bunch of lovely mp3s, I wouldn't have to delete it and could seed indefinitely. D:"
