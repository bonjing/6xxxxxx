Thanks in advance ."
,swampmatt,2011-03-18T06:33Z,I heard some talk of a new season produced by scifi channel??? Could this be true? I sure hope so. This is probably the most underrated program ever made.
,Mcflurries,2011-04-10T22:11Z,"Downloaded fairly quickly for 3+ gigs

The episodes are all mixed up, though. Numbered / and/or named wrong.
Gonna go watch each one and try to fix it..."
,Mcflurries,2011-04-10T22:30Z,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(show)
the correct order is here"
,missbinks,2011-05-26T12:22Z,"Just to clarify.
The episodes are not really ""mixed up"", they ARE in intended order, but the titles are incorrect as they follow the FOX order.
Means that, in the torrent, 1x01 The Train Job (pilot aired on FOX) is actually Serenity (the original pilot).

,lowlander333,2011-06-06T06:00Z,"This is shit. I admit I'm spoiled, but you know who spoiled me? Fucking dickheads who label their files correctly. I just wanted to watch ""Jaynestown"" so I downloaded it. But wait...this isn't actually ""Jaynestown."" Another 20 minutes of lifetime wasted.
I DO wish you luck on future uploads, no sarcasm.
Mistakes are part of learning. "
,nicpurdo,2012-01-02T08:56Z,if you check on thetvdb.com you will find that the titles ARE actually labelled correctly in correct order. i ripped them from a dvd and use a meta manager to update titles correctly.
