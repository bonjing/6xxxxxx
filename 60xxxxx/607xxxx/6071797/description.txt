SUMMARY:
Peter Parker has finally managed to piece together the once-broken parts of 
his life, maintaining a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane and his 
responsibility as Spider-Man. But more challenges arise for our young hero. 
Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against Peter; taking 
up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must 
also capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed 
into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman. All hope seems lost when suddenly 
Peter's suit turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his powers. But it also 
begins to greatly amplify the much darker qualities of Peter's personality 
that he begins to lose himself to. Peter has to reach deep inside himself 
to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer the 
darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself.
