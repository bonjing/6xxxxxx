Description

"Wispin is a breath of fresh air in iOS gaming." - TouchArcade.com

Get ready for zany arcade action with a unique "color-matching" twist!

The land of Ether is experiencing a rather inconvenient pest problem! It's up to Wispin and his handy color-changing abilities to wipe out the Blooper infestation and save the day!

FEATURES

- The innovative "Touch Color Wheel" acts similar to a joystick - slide your thumb around to change Wispin's color on the fly. Matching an enemy's color will allow you to defeat it, but watch out for enemies and attacks of differing colors!

- Stylized cartoon graphics and beautiful animations featuring HD Retina display support!

- Two endless gameplay modes, Achievements to unlock, statistics tracking, and Game Center leaderboards!

- Wacky weapons (including bombs, arrows, and CHEESE), powerups, bonuses, and an escalating multiplier/combo system!

- Gameplay that starts slowly so all types of players can learn the ropes, but eventually progresses to be more chaotic and challenging (even for advanced players)!

- Customizable game options including joystick and tilt controls!

- Color Blind and left-handed control support!

- It's fun on a bun!
