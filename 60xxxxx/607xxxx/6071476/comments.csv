,AriGold45,2011-01-09T03:20Z,"Screens look pretty promising.  I will D/L and post A/V scores when I get back... I'm actually walking out the door to see this in theaters.  I'm already downloading another copy of this by the same uploader, but this one looks better.  I hope they're not the same one!
