Camper Van Beethoven - Self Titled continued the band's focusing in on the proto indie rock sound, with touches of country and featured outstanding tracks, such as "Joe Stalinâ€™s Cadillac", and a reverent version of Pink Floydâ€™s â€˜Interstellar Overdrive". Following the third albumâ€™s critical acclaim, the band public notoriety grew massively with national tours with bands such as R.E.M. and 10,000 Maniacs.
