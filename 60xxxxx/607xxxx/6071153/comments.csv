,fakebest,2011-01-24T05:07Z,why has no one mentioned that this release has no subtitles? this should be common sense by now to put them in any foreign movie
,fakebest,2011-01-24T05:11Z,no one has mentioned it because it does have subtitles it is the srt file but as too why it was not integrated into the file as softsub I do not know.
,mufuti9,2011-03-30T04:00Z,"I know why - because softsubs are fucking HORRIBLE!

greatly appreciate the seperate subtitle, allows me to draw them on the VMR surface and also change the size, anti aliasing, font type etc.

also great upload overall, thanks."
