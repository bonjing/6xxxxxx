The Manchu Emperor and his political aides suspect the prominent Chien family of being Ming patriots and therefore assign the task of investigating them to one of their top charges, Wei (Chiang). After proving his capabilities in a series of bouts and showing everyone that he is worthy of the task, Wei sets out the infiltrate the family. On arriving in town he seizes the opportunity to accept the position of teacher to the Chien's spoilt daughter. Although she is known for making life unbearable for her previous instructors, Wei's patience and wiles mean he lasts in the role and the two fall in love. While their relationship steadily continues he continues to probe into the dealings of the Chiens, in particular the father. When the secretive love of Wei and Chi Chi blossoms into marriage, the investigator discovers the full extent of his in-laws rebel sympathies and they in turn learn that he is a Manchu. What follows is a protracted battle between the newlyweds and their family with the promise that, if Wei can win against all of the skilled members, they can leave. The task is only achieved after tragic loss though and the inadequate abilities of Wei need to be improved before he can complete his mission.
