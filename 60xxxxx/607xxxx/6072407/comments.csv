,akindayimcan,2010-12-30T15:19Z,"i am here bro :)=
i have a bravia EX500 too cant play .mkv and i cannot solve subs problem too...

and i need a help too... i want to convert .mkv files to .mp4 but dont want losing quality who know a free program for this ?"
,DevSIN,2010-12-30T16:12Z,"@ akind : For conversion of mkv to mp4 ...
use mkvextractGUI with mkvtoolnix.. extract all files from the mkv file..
then use Yamb(also available free) ... to merge those extracted files..

Note : video format is same in both mkv & mp4 container.. i.e, h264 (x264) .. 

Hope this helps :)"
[T],MitZep,2010-12-30T16:29Z,"use mp4box to mux from mkv to mp4
it will take abt a 1 minute
it is not encoding or converting it is just muxing... "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-30T16:54Z,"@apple
welcome..
n no need of hindi audio that will only increase the size more..and more than that the movie's beauty is to watch it in english only...for example what joker says in english that cant be said exactly in hindi..so all the fun is spoiled in hindi...

@jarman,mzk
welcome...

@hello_rickoo,akind

Will you do American History X? I know there are a lot of option available. But they are either less than 700 mb or above 1500 mb. You can encode it at around 1 GB, if you havnt seen this movie. "

i think ur talking abt this one(interview with the vampire)...
i said before that it depends on source plus the way movie is shot....

this movie is ment to be dark as it is a vampire movie also look at the year 1994..."
[V],prashant22,2011-01-01T11:36Z,i hv improved in encoding since when i ripped love actually..
[V],prashant22,2011-01-01T12:02Z,dont look at the colors and brightness...look at the sharpness and details(mostly of face)...
