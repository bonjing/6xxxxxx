================================================

These is the famous Beethoven cycle from Fleisher, Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. You may want to look into the Ashkenazy set if you're looking for pristine, modern audio, otherwise this set is excellent and well worth a listen (or two or three or four...)

I've inflicted my own tag system (using mediamonkey) on these for which I apologize if they're inconvenient. I've found everyone does it a little different.
