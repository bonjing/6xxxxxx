To rar 11 movies into one is just plain stupid...
My advise: make a new torrent without rar them!

,dove91,2011-01-03T18:12Z,these are not rar'd
[T],metalcore.,2011-01-03T20:37Z,dove91 these ARE rar'd look at the file list!
,dove91,2011-01-03T22:27Z,"ok i was wrong , all i meant to say is you don't need to download everything to get one film "

nothing to criticize here, delivers what it promises. can recommend this.
great thanks to Stun for compiling and seeding this."
