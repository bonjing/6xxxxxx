[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-08T06:28Z,is odd how bluray didn't have dts audio.
,Ezylryb,2011-01-08T07:04Z,Where do you get this release ?
[V],BOZX,2011-01-08T07:54Z,i stole a stolen movie...
,osokinas,2011-01-08T12:18Z,"I heard that official Blu-ray release didn't have DTS audio but Special Edition version of Blu-ray has it! So is it possible to get the 720p 4,69 GB or even 7,04 GB rip with DTS?"
,LaVella,2011-01-08T18:45Z,"for many movies is enough AC3 (DD).
DTS is just wasting space in movies where is nothing special with the soundtrack."
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-09T07:26Z,"i am not complaining about the lack of dts, it doesn't matter to me.  it all sounds the same to my ears, i just found it odd."

,imnangler,2011-01-16T04:57Z,I highly disagree with the negative DTS statement. It is the next progression in dolby digital and sounds so much better than anything else.
