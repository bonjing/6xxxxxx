,jfkbusdriver,2011-01-26T08:10Z,"Running Win 7 64.
After install runs great, able to backup BD movie to BD-25. 
Next day or later on certain functions are limited like BD copy.
In the settings menu (Green check mark) there are no BD options, just DVD options
Also says please register. Only way to fix is to uninstall and reinstall. 
""Check for new version"" is unchecked.

Any ideas?

Thanks!"

This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happens for version 8073.."
