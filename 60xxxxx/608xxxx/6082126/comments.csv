,d3k0,2011-01-04T17:35Z,I hope this isn't some sort of a scam... Zygor's addon looks awesome. I'd love to try it out but I don't wanna lose my acc info :D
,TPBrullz,2011-01-04T23:01Z,"I'm gonna scan this one for virus or altered/alien files later.

In the mean time you can use the other versions that are already in here, me and a lot of other people already tested them for all that."
,TPBrullz,2011-01-05T00:05Z,"No Virus or alien/modified files.

The guides are definitively not up to date (not the latest ones).

Someone (owner or whatever...) just updated the addon and not the guides."
,pirate_12345,2011-01-05T04:39Z,Hey iHugh this is a weird upload.Wotlk guide looks updated but the other guides are older than 1625.Please fix this and upload the official version.
