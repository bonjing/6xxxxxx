,ps3_in_az,2011-10-12T05:45Z,"I'm from Detroit and these guys are fuckin awesome! It is such a shame they are no longer together. Their name is NATAS- Niggas Ahead Of Time And Space, not Nation Ahead Of Time And Space!"
,ps3_in_az,2011-10-12T05:48Z,"If you like these guys, you should check out their solo albums! E.S.H.A.M., T.N.T, and Mastamind comprise the group. E.S.H.A.M. is in my opinion the best of the three, he's been rapping since the times of Grand Master Flash!"
,MileHighJuggalo,2011-10-22T09:57Z,hell yeah! I have the ESHAM and Mastamind discographys up as well! So be sure to peep that shit out! :) Both are fresh as hell
