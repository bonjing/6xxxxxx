Updated : Here you can download the dvd-covers, so you can decide
if you want to download the DVD's

ClassiC Hard Rock is a series of '70-'80-'90-video's (and some new stuff)

The sound is fixed on the clips who needed to be fixed.
Some Video's are poor quality, but mostly good.

So if you download them all, it should be about 1400 video's

So.....ENJOY!!!!
