SUMMARY:
When a green ogre called Shrek discovers his swamp has been 'swamped' 
with all sorts of fairytale creatures by the scheming Lord Farquaad, Shrek 
sets out, with a very loud donkey by his side, to 'persuade' Farquaad to 
give his swamp back. Instead, a deal is made. Farquaad, who wants to become 
the King, sends Shrek to rescue Princess Fiona, who is waiting for her one 
true love. But once they head back with Fiona, it starts to become apparent 
that not only does Shrek like Fiona, but Fiona is keeping something secret.
