EARL HINES ONCE UPON A TIME
Label:Impulse
Recorded in New York, New York on January 10-11, 1966
Originally released on Impulse (9108 ).


Once Upon A Time is, for all practical purposes, a scaled down version of the Duke Ellington orchestra led by pianist Earl Hines. All the major Ellingtonians are present: Cat Anderson, Ray Nance, Jimmy Hamilton, Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves and numerous others. A guest appearance by former Coltrane quartet drummer Elvin Jones comes as an unexpected surprise. This is a far more traditional setting than one would have expected to hear him involved with in 1966. His energy here is infectious and it is worth a listen just to hear him in this context. Although not a typical item in Earl Hines' discography, Ellington fans will certainly love this hard swinging disc.
