,Insomneac,2011-01-11T08:16Z,Does anyone know what the installer music is called?
,Insomneac,2011-01-11T08:32Z,"Sorry for the double-post, it sounds like ""God rest you merry, gentlemen"", but who is the singer?

Thanks Chatt."
,Insomneac,2011-01-11T22:12Z,"Nevermind, I worked it out.

It's Loreena McKennitt."
,no1453,2011-01-12T02:26Z,"Problem on win 7 x64 system: with original msvcr90.dll program starts up, but with cracked one no window appears, and process (viewed in task manager) exits after a few seconds.  Does anyone have any ideas on this?  Tried 4 or five older cracked versions, same thing happens every time.  Searched comments on all the torrents I tried, nothing there.   ???"
,Insomneac,2011-01-12T07:47Z,"@ no1453, try running program as Admin, and try temporarily disabling any anti-virus.

@ Chatt, are you opening registration on your site soon, I want to be a Chatt groupie? :)"
,ajsemenietjes,2011-01-12T15:10Z,Thanks Chatchico & +1 :)
,no1453,2011-01-12T21:37Z,"@ Insomneac, thanks for the idea, I went so far as to uninstall Norton for downloading to applying patch (making sure windows defender was turned off) and making sure I was running as admin, but no luck"
,warrior1988,2011-01-12T22:51Z,@ no1453 try running it in windows xp sp3
,Insomneac,2011-01-13T02:05Z,"@ no1453, try uninstalling the program completely.

Make sure you have the latest versions of Visual C++ from Microsoft.

Then run Chatt's installer as Admin.

If that fails, try a clean boot and see if it runs?"
,Mclectric,2011-01-13T05:06Z,"@ no1453 I have had problems with previous versions of this program as well. And I also have Windows 7 64bit, but for some reason this one installed fine without a problem. I'm not sure what I did different if anything. But this is just to let you know that it can run flawless on 64bit win7.  

Thanks ChattChitto for another great up!"
,seventorrents,2011-01-14T09:14Z,"It stucks and terminates on converting flv to avi, anybody have same problem?"
,seventorrents,2011-01-14T09:16Z,terminates on converting flv to avi anybody having same problem?
,TonyTheCat,2011-01-15T04:22Z,I'd wait for the new version anyway if your having a problem . The new Cinavia watermark encryption is going to be decrypted in the new version . That's on DVD and Blu-ray discs .
,Insomneac,2011-01-16T01:07Z,"@ seven, if you're having problems, try SUPER.

It's free, and converts flv to avi, or whatever you want."
,jr15642,2011-01-16T04:46Z,"I get message ""DVD Copy (Gold)"" option is expired when i run the program. but in the first screen it says ""never expire"" in all fields.  Is there a fix to this?"
,jjcobm,2011-01-16T19:35Z,"Thanks for the software, but I don't think we all need to be looking at nude women while trying to install software, especially if doing it for someone else.  Maybe next version remove it?"
,jjcobm,2011-01-16T19:37Z,"Thanks for the software, but I don't think all of us need to be looking at nude women when installing this, especially when doing it for other people.  Maybe remove her for future versions?  Thanks!"
,Insomneac,2011-01-16T20:26Z,"@ jj, you don't think for all of us.

You seem to be the only one with the aversion to nudity, not that I would call that image nudity.

Anyway, I don't get it, your morals aren't bothered by pirating software, but by an image of a woman?

BTW, you have a choice, if you don't like it, then buy the program."
,west54,2011-01-17T11:09Z,"thanks, 100%"
,jfkbusdriver,2011-01-17T19:49Z,"Hi Chatt or Anyone else,
Please verify this,

Running Win 7 64.
After install runs great, able to backup BD movie to BD-25. 
Next day or later on certain functions are limited like BD copy.
In the settings menu (Green check mark) there are no BD options, just DVD options
Also says please register. Only way to fix is to uninstall and reinstall. 
""Check for new version"" is unchecked.
Love the program and Chatt's contribution, but does anyone know what's going on?

Thanks Guys!"
,Insomneac,2011-01-17T22:00Z,"@ jf,  I've had this happen with other programs.

Usually, I can fix it by running as Admin, and/or Windows XP SP3 compatibility."
,scootergrisen,2011-01-18T10:46Z,Anyone know the title of the music ?
,scootergrisen,2011-01-18T10:48Z,"Ah sorry the answer was already there.
I was looking up instead of down for the answer."
,acemoab,2011-01-19T05:56Z,"Crack works at first, but most features expire in a few days. Same problem on WinXP-x86 and Win7-x64 here. 8.0.6.1 appears to be newest version that does not have this problem. "
,jfkbusdriver,2011-01-21T06:36Z,"Insomneac,

Tried all your suggestions.
I'm still getting ALL the same issues I mentioned.

Any other ideas?"
[V],ChattChitto,2011-01-24T23:41Z,"That's not called nudity/pornographic, It's called Art.
If it was I wouldn't have putted it :)

By the way I am now aware of that problem:
It can be by passed by uninstalling then installing the release. I wanted to release the fix but soon a newer release of DVDFab will be out so I will wait for it. If you need badly for the fix E-mail me and I'll send the small fix to you through E-Mail."
,Torent.Spy,2011-01-28T13:55Z,thanks CC all the best
,Outback6,2011-01-29T17:50Z,New version 8.0.7.3 released 29 Jan 2011.  Waiting for new crack with the fix.  Thanks.
,glfnotred,2011-01-30T10:10Z,"Having a problem here, every time I go to rip and burn a DVD the process will not finish.  I have an error code of 105. I've read many other posts and no such luck on fixing it.  This is what I've done so far and come to a conclusion with:  
  The DVD output size does not want to stay on DVD-5, it changes to DVD-9 automatically even after I change it manually in Settings, and made sure to click memorize user interface.  This all happened when I installed Roxio Creator 2011.  I already uninstalled Roxio, along with uninstalling DVDfab 8, and also uninstalling the DVD/CD-Rom drive along with re-installing the drive.  I am still getting this error because the file is to big to put on a standard DVD.  PLEASE SOMEONE HELP.  I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING."
,jr153,2011-02-09T23:44Z,"CC-
Ive never had any problems with your prgms until now. This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happens for version 8073.."
[T],protoyu,2011-02-25T14:53Z,"How to extract the softwares and cracks from ChattChitto files????
