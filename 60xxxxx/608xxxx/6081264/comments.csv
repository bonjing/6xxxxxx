Then, you twit, you won't have to be such a prick in your show info. That would truly be problem solved... Thanks for playing higga da nigga"

,poopp00p,2011-01-04T09:52Z,"@ dzlrules - LOL, listen to the dude, professional leech, who has no torrents ULed, dictating the quality he wants and deciding what others should want. Bugger off and do something useful. 

The rest of you, enjoy the show!"
