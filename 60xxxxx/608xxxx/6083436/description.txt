Need for Speed is going back to its roots and that can mean only one thing:
police chases and ridiculously expensive supercars. Hot Pursuit doesn\\\'t make
any claims to be the most realistic racer out there, even compared to
previous games, but it does aim to be the most fun

You can play either as cops or racers, but both sides get ultra powerful
cars and a range of power-ups to get them to the race\\\'s end. If you\\\'re a cop
your job is to chase down your quarry using any means necessary, including
roadblocks
