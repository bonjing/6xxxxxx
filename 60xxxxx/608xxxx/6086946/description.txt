Doggystyle is the debut album from American hip hop rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, released November 23, 1993 on Death Row Records. The album was recorded soon following the release of Dr. Dre's landmark debut album The Chronic (1992), to which Snoop Dogg contributed significantly. His musical stylizations for the album share similarity to those featured on Doggystyle.[1] Critics have praised Snoop Dogg for the lyrical "realism" he delivers on the album and for his distinctive vocal flow.
