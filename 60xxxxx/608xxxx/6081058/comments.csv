,Ozzy_fan,2011-01-18T01:23Z,"Hey FXG_TEAM, 
I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan

,Mesohappy,2011-03-08T02:47Z,"Looking forward to your copy.
I`m new and I guess its NOT normal to allow the Movies you record to stay on a couple more hours for somebody else to enjoy for the same price of A/C and internet?
What would be the reason to not let the movie be accessed for others. The other ? why a blocker. I got one but why do I need to have it?

,arcname,2011-03-23T15:49Z,"hey fxgteam, would you please advise about how to play 'the lincoln lawyer' .wmv format 712.10 mb?
I tried to play it with win media player, kmplayer, divx player, real player without success, it asks to download a codec - gygan, that i did - still doesn't play??
Please advise.

,PRSteve,2011-03-24T17:41Z,"@c.walker.23 & arcname: You both need to use the VLC player which is free and is compatible with every codec I have come up to! Google it!
As for your problem c.walker, WMP is notorious for this kind of problems... I once deleted a great torrent because it had no sound on WMP then downloaded it again 6 months later and played it using VLC. Encountered no problems ever since! WMP however is horrendous for videos... "
,j0eStER,2011-03-27T17:39Z,"@arcname

The video you downloaded is probably garbage files or the CoDec is full of Malware if it won't download auto-WMP or DiX Player."
