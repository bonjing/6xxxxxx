Sorry for the last one. I was on my way out the door to work and was in a rush, won't happen again. Now for this one we have corrected the AR and IVTC, we did the same things we did to the last release as this one. We cropped, resized, as well as adjusted the gamma, brightness rgb colors just a tad and increased the saturation +1. The audio is AC3 and sounds very nice as well... :)

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
