The thirty four lectures that make up this book were given to a small group of students who came to the 
Sivananda Ashram in 1970 to be instructed in the fundamentals of spiritual practice.Swamiji has masterfully 
presented the essence of the philosophy ,psychology and practice of yoga in a way that is especially helpful 
for the beginner of the path.To read his words is to be bathed in the light of wisdom. "The longing of the whole 
soul of our being is referred to by the mystics as "the alone flying to the Alone."The more we think of it the 
more we will start liking it and the more we we will start liking it and the more we will get absorbed into it,and 
then the path will become very easy." An excerpt from the book abundantly explains the soul of the book. The 
Divine Life Society is unique in it's contribution of great spiritual classics written by great masters under the
