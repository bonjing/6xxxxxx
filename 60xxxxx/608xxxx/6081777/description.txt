Everyone wants a slimmer body, but you may not realize that a balanced mind and soul 
are the bedrock of true health and beauty. The Seven-Day Total Cleanse is a revolutionary 
seven-day juice fast that helps you shed weight and eliminate harmful toxins-all while restoring 
your emotional and spiritual wellness. Author Mary McGuire-Wien has guided thousands of clients 
through this unique program, which uses nutrient-rich juices, meditations, yoga, and self-care 
activities to cleanse the body, renew energy levels, and refresh the mind and soul. 
LET JUICE FASTING CHANGE YOUR LIFE 
There are plenty of fad diets that help you quickly drop a few pounds--only to gain them back as 
soon as you start eating normally. But the Seven-Day Total Cleanse not only jump-starts weight 
loss but also fosters a mind-body connection, offering benefits far beyond the physical changes 
you experience when you stop eating.
