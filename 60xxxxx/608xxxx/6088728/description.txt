The squad "goes Hollywood," investigating the high profile homicide of a movie star who had been filming in Detroit. Actress Kristin Keller was many things to many people -- a meal ticket to some, a lover to others. But Fitch, Washington and Mason have to unmask her secret life, the life unknown to her fans, to find the murderer. Meanwhile, the strange case of a young homeless man found upside down encased in ice in a shantytown confounds Longford, Mahajan, Stone and Sanchez. The detectives discover that the transient had another totally different life before his descent into hell, as they piece together the puzzling clues in his chilling demise.
