    PS3 Custom Firmware Creator Released! Permanently Add â€œInstall PKGsâ€ to the XMB


    Say whaaat? If youâ€™re following KaKaRoTo you know exactly whatâ€™s up:

    First CFW working. 
        Grabthen â€œ./create_cfw.sh PS3UPDAT.355.PUP CFW.PUPâ€. 
	Permanently adds â€œinstall pkg filesâ€ menu.

    Iâ€™m playing with it nowâ€¦ Iâ€™ll report back later. In the meantime:

    Download ps3 utilities and ps3 tools from github / team fail0verflow:

       # git clone https://github.com/kakaroto/ps3utils.git
       # cd ps3utils
       # make
       # cd ..
       # git clone git://git.fail0verflow.com/ps3tools.git
       # cd ps3tools
       # make
       # cp pkg unpkg ../ps3utils

    Grab the PS3 encryption/decryption/signing keys from github:

        # git clone https://github.com/kakaroto/ps3keys.git ~/.ps3

    Download PS3 3.55 (or whatever official firmware PUP) from here
    Extract and copy â€œPS3UPDAT.PUPâ€ to the â€œps3utilsâ€ directory
    Create the PS3 Custom Firmware (CFW) from the original/official update (OFW):

        # cd ps3utils
        # ./create_cfw.sh PS3UPDAT.PUP CFW.PUP

    Copy and rename CFW.PUP to a USB storage device keeping this directory structure in mind: /PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP
    Connect that USB device to your PS3 and install from Settings -> System Update

    If youâ€™re currently running 3.41 (or earlier) you can either remain there and create 
    a specific CFW PUP for that version, or you can upgrade to a later PS3 firmware version, 
    like 3.55 for example. Itâ€™s whatever original PUP file you use â€” only you cannot flash 
    a version lower than the current version installed on your PS3. So if youâ€™re already at 3.55, 
    where youâ€™re unable to downgrade, then for the moment you have no other choice but 
    CFW (or OFW) 3.55. 3.41 on the other hand: upgrade or create CFW 3.41 and for the interim 
    youâ€™re still able to jailbreak and run unsigned â€˜brews. See the other notes below.

    Other things to note:

    This CFW does not modify the kernel in any way, meaning all the current compiled 
    homebrew out there will not install or run using â€œInstall Package Filesâ€ from the XMB.
    With the above point in mind you should know this CFW does not enable piracy. 
    No piracy, no backups â€” straight homebrew.
    Current PS3 homebrew and new homebrew will need to be â€œretailâ€ packaged and signed; 
    thatâ€™ll happen with fail0verflowâ€™s tools.
    This is only the beginning. Prepare yourself for utter and absolute awesomeness.

Update: Flashing 3.55-KaKaRoTo now!
Update: And success! She flashed without bricking! Mind you, as jjolano reports via the 
	comments, many XMB items under the GAME menu are missing: Trophies, Game Data Utility, 
	Save Data, etcâ€¦ Games (disc loaded) still boot, install and play however. 
	Iâ€™m online with PSN too. Go Netflix!

Update: Iâ€™ve converted two PUPs for you: 3.55 and 3.41. Grab â€˜em.

Update: Depending on your situation you may need to install the CFW PUP from the PS3 Recovery Menu. 
	To do that, follow these steps:

	Ensure the PS3UPDAT.PUP is in /PS3/UPDATE/ on your USB device.
	Power down the PS3.
	Now press and hold the power button, the system will startup and shutdown again.
	Release the power button, then press & hold power again, youâ€™ll hear one beep followed 
	by two consecutive beeps.
	Release power then follow the on-screen instructions. Youâ€™re now in the recovery menu.
	Connect the USB device and select â€œSystem Update.â€
	Hope for the best.

	Thanks for the tip, Carlos. Note: you can restore OFW using the above method too.

Update: KaKaRoTo has fixed the missing XMB menu items and also enabled is PS1/PS2 support 
	for backward compatible models. So here are new PUPs for your flashing pleasure.
