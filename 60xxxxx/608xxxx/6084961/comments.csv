,DrugSquad66,2011-02-10T01:41Z,"great quality.
but the movie, i dunno, a rock falls on his arm, he cuts off his arm, his arm dies, he lives. we all know the story. touching the void is a much much better film/story in my own humble opinion."
,reinxiii,2011-02-10T17:36Z,"Great upload, good download speed, loved the movie. Agent 2.5i, keep your opinions to yourself. You really go off on people like that because they liked a movie? Get a life man"
,x8TragedY8x,2011-02-11T21:35Z,"Im sorry but to all the people that say this movie was boring or it sucked. You obviously have no taste in movies. You probably stick to a certain genre that you like so everything else is displeasing. When you watch a movie, open your mind and really put yourself in the movie. Just imagine if you were in his situation. Could you cut your damn arm off?

@Scobbalobba - I feel sorry for people as narrow minded as you. Watch Avatar again and then jerk off to some bestiality if that turns you on, but don't bore us with your pathetic opinions. I am sure you are well qualified to judge which videos of a pony fucking a guy up the ass with no vaseline are good, but I believe there are better sources for opinions about Danny Boyle's work than you . . ."
