The album contains hits from between Bon Jovi (1984) and Keep The Faith (1992) and two new tracks: the hit singles "Always" and "Someday I'll Be Saturday Night", as well as a new, updated rendition of "Livin' on a Prayer" entitled "Prayer '94" available only on the North American versions. A video, also entitled Cross Road, was simultaneously released which contained 16 of the band's music videos.

In 2005, Cross Road was re-issued as a 3-disc box set under the name "Deluxe Sound & Vision", which included the original remastered album, a bonus CD containing b-sides, rarities and fan favourites, and the Live from London DVD. The original remastered album was released in 1998.
