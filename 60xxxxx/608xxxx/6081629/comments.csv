,blenderman311,2011-01-04T15:49Z,Does anyone else have problems viewing these FTV files. I'm using Windows media player 12.0.7600.16667 on win7 ult x64 with klite mega codec pack with all features installed. I thought it was a codec problem so i tried using vlc and it still shows up scrambled. Its weird the sound is perfect but the picture looks like back in the old days of cable and you watched the scrambled payperview channels. Thats probably the best description of what it is. But basically i mean the picture is in color and sound is fine but the picture is all chopped up ans scrambled. Its weird cause 99% of videos play perfect the ones that don't 99.999 of the time will play on vlc. Any ideas i'm assuming its a codec problem
,bowhan333,2011-01-04T23:16Z,"sorry your having problem. video plays fine on my end using VLC. picture and sound are fine. is it just this one FTV video i've posted that ur having problem with? The original videos were converted to dvd and burnt to disk, then re-converted to avi using ANY DVD converter, so there is some quality loss, but should play fine with VLC"
