,rdkturner,2011-01-16T14:44Z,"Good quality rip, but this show keeps on getting worse.  Started out good but as soon as they added that Brit it went straight downhill, and now it is unwatchable..."
,AnotherStranger,2011-01-16T23:02Z,"Yeah this is like a bad children's show, with a terribly bad dialogue and constant over-use of cheap CGI.

Watched it solely for Diana, and then she didn't show up until the last few seconds..."
