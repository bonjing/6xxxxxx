Another of my bloat reductions.  This was available as a 7.85 GB dual-layer ISO image and a few 700 MB options.  I don't think 700 MB is enough to store a two-hour movie at decent quality, especially not one as visual as Somewhere in Time, but 7.85 GB is way too much to make everyone download!

So I downloaded the 7.85 GB ISO image and deconstructed it.  This torrent contains the movie in a 1.5 GB AVI and all the extras in their own separate AVIs.

Extras include a 1 hour "Making of..." featurette, a short about the movie's fan club 'Insite', and a two minute theatrical trailer.  There are also a couple of small AVIs that are full of production notes and still photos.  I can't find an AVI player that will let me frame-by-frame through them, but I will include them for the sake of completeness.

The feature has two stereo audio tracks, English and French.  I could only put two audio tracks into the AVI, so the director's commentary is included as a separate MP3 file.  If you start the MP3 and the movie at the same time, they should sync up perfectly.

Subtitles in English and Spanish are included in external sub/idx files.

The total size of the torrent is 2.3 GB.  You can download it all or de-select the files you don't want in your torrent client.
