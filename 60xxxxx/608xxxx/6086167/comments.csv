[T],L3G3ND,2011-01-12T13:49Z,"What is an Evaluation copy?
Evaluation copy is the copy of software which is given by the developer or a company for demo, trial or free version. This is for customer to check software before purchase. 

I had activated this setup in advance means I had already added rarreg.key in the setup.

This is a beta version and it now only available only for trial. Thats why it shows 40 Days Remaining.

You can Clear your doubts from these links below:-

Please change your Security Soft.

Its just a poor Antiviral Program which can't even heal a Drop2.Win32 Trojan Downloader.

Get 1 from my 4 antiviruses I suggested above.
