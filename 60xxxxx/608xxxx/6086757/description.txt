Godfather I subtitles  in both out HD DivX and DivX from bluray versions in the
Trilogy pack. English subs separately posted on a couple of torrents for close
captioned or simply for the (Italian) non English spoken parts.

These are subtitles either extracted from the original Matroska or found on the 
Internet in the case of a couple of languages that were not included in the mkv file
(such as - most important of all for this title - Italino! of course).

We will post more subtitles for this series shortly.
