,McGuffey,2011-01-14T20:03Z,"great download speed, and it works good, but after I run the .exe it takes about 15 minutes for the program to kick in, thats the only real flaw =) but otherwise it's a great torrent"

,matty777,2011-09-09T11:24Z,"Hey FuCtUpPuNk, 

I am having trouble getting a reliable copy of Diablo 2 and Expansion installed on my copy of Windows Xp Student Edition run by VMWare fusion. I am running this program on mac os x so I am very uneducated with some of the problems that are occurring. For one, when I extract the files in the torrent using Winzip, I always get files that can't be mounted. when I click on the files that you tell me to click on it says insert Cd into DVD Drive. Maybe should i try using Winrar or 7-zip instead of Winzip? Please help because i have been at this for some time now and I am getting really frustrated. "
