Release Title: Alice in Wonderland 3D 2010 720p BRRip Anaglyph H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: Tim Burton
Tagline: Alice, an unpretentious and individual 19-year-old, is betrothed to a dunce of an English nobleman.
At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage
and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and
surreal place called "Underland," she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she
had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches.
Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the
rightful queen to her throne.
