Sinatra's Sinatra is an album by American singer Frank Sinatra, released in 1963. The album contained re-recorded versions of 12 songs Sinatra had previously released. The album was arranged and conducted by frequent Sinatra collaborator Nelson Riddle.

You can't argue with a legend. And you can't argue with success. So when Frank Sinatra noticed that his former labels, Columbia and Capitol, were banking on his earlier hits by issuing compilations of older material, he decided he'd one-up their strategy. The singer had just formed Reprise, his own imprint, and immediately took control. Released in 1963, Sinatra's Sinatra is true to its name: The album features Ol' Blue Eyes revisiting a dozen of his best tunes, all selected by the singer, and all deemed to be among his all-time favorites.

And now, on license from Frank Sinatra Enterprises, Mobile Fidelity engineers bring staggering sonics to the equation with this new LP release. Half-speed mastered from the original master tapes, the 180g numbered, limited-edition LP of Sinatra's Sinatra brings you closer to the music and The Voice. Riddle's arrangements have never sounded more spacious, and Sinatra's convincing timbre is clear, transparent, textured, and unbelievably present. Here is a vocal album that will soon become one of your reference favorites.

The involvement of legendary collaborator, arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle looms large. Together, Riddle and Sinatra breathe new life into an incredible selection of pop staples: "I've Got You Under My Skin," "Witchcraft," "Young at Heart," and "All the Way" among them.

Loving Sinatra's Sinatra is as simple as the record's concept: You know all of these songs, and Sinatra, motivated to show the world he was at the top of his game, performs the material with ingrained passion and peerless emotion. His vocal inflections, Riddle's brilliant arrangements, and the quality of the songs themselves make for an unbeatable combination. Of course, Sinatra spans a gulf of emotions and moods, be it romantic, ruminative, or playfully riled.
