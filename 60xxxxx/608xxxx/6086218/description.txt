Actors: Coco Velvett, Jack Lawrence

Release Date: January 06, 2011

Coco Ono Velvett is one sneaky little neighbor. She's had her eye on a guy next door, and she's finally figured out a way to get him away from his wife. She pulls the "damsel in distress" move, that her sink isn't working properly. When Jack comes over to help her with the situation, he quickly fixes her pipes, and then she grabs his. Being the good husband, he says no, but being a man, Oh-no! Coco gets her way, and his pipe gets in that velvet pussy.
