"No Ordinary Friends"

After Jim saves Dave Cotten's (Ricky Schroder) 
life, he and Stephanie become fast friends with 
Dave, his wife, Michelle (Annie Wersching, "24") 
and their kids. But Jim begins to suspect that 
the Cottens may be leading their own secret lives. 
Meanwhile, Daphne throws her hat into the high 
school ring for student council president, and 
Katie reveals a secret to Stephanie about her 
relationship with Joshua - aka The Watcher
