,changeHD,2011-01-29T02:54Z,Won't work on PS3 or WD TV Media Player. Trying MKVmerge to remux without compression headers. Hopefully that works.
,changeHD,2011-01-29T03:04Z,"Anyone having issues with this file, use MKVmerge to remux. On the video file, audio file, and subtitles, click the ""Extra Options"" tab and set compression to ""none"". 

After remuxing, it works fine for me."

,ra1961,2011-01-30T18:52Z,VlC or GOM player works fine for MKV or MP4 Files...AVI quality sucks anyway!
,lucky023,2011-02-08T16:01Z,whats up with the da** compression headers?  why do they do this? i am getting these kinds of files lately. last time i remember was the prince of persia where i have to remux and it works fine. but this one i lost the 5.1 ch and stuck up in the middle of the movie with my wdtv. whats the worst thing that could happen? definitely a waste of time.. very frustating!
,mikolar,2011-02-15T17:17Z,"@changeHD

Thx for advice. It's working for me too."

Top quality. Thank you.
Plays fine on WMP with k lite codec pack. Even better on Potplayer (from creator of VLC).
Have burnt to disc, but will not play on bluray player, which supports mkv playback. What am I doing wrong? Any help is appreciated."
,Ayeg3nt,2011-03-28T15:56Z,"Doesn't work on PS3 Media Server. Good quality, though."
,Malasky,2011-03-31T18:05Z,"@changeHD
Did as you suggested and now works fine on bluray player. 5.1 sound is very , very good, and the picture on a 1080p TV is excellent.
BOZX thanks for the u/l, and changeHD thanks for the tip."
