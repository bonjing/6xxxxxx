,dasonc,2011-01-09T03:57Z,"oh and also when you start, the controls reset themselves to default (WASD) and keeps reseting itself whenever you close and open the game"

SKINS ARE POSSIBLE SEE VID
ONLINE IS POSSIBLE TOO YOU NEED TO INSTALL/USE HAMACHI"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-20T23:06Z,"for skins: 
1.go to HOME/library/application support/minecraft/bin
2.compress minecraft.jar
3.unzip minecraft.jar(.zip)
4.delete official minecraft.jar
5.rename ""minecraft"" folder to minecraft.jar (say add)

NOTE: from here you also can add mods n' stuff

6. go to mobs (inside the new minecraft.jar folder)
7. this are the skins, alter them to whatever you like :)
8. be creative :)"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-20T23:17Z,"for texture packs: 1.see skins 
2.then alter the ""terrain.png"" for obviously the terrain skin
3.alter stuff inside ""gui""
4.alter stuff inside ""item""
5.alter stuff inside ""misc""
6.alter stuff inside ""terrain""
7.alter stuff inside ""title"" (splashes are yellow words bouncing up and down when u enter the menu)

NOTE: DON'T MAKE THE IMAGES BIGGER THAN THEY WHERE! OTHERWISE IT MIGHT BUG/LAG OR EVEN CRASH! -paint only on the on transparent pixels- (for example for the player skin: http://danielmcgraw.com/images/minecraft/minecraftskinwithhelm.png   )"
,scouseruk1210,2011-08-21T20:24Z,workin good offline thanks
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-08-26T19:36Z,no problem.... ;)
,Anarkos,2011-09-14T15:46Z,Is 1.8 having problems for anyone else? If so are there any current cracks of 1.8?
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-15T00:23Z,"@Anarkos hey dude(s) there is nothing wrong with the updater so 

you should be able to update to 1.8 

if you had the error ""failed to launch"" or ""failed to download"" you should 

delete all components inside HOME/library/applications support/minecraft BUT NOT YOUR SAVES.... 

then run the auto updater again..."
,Min3craft,2011-09-18T08:50Z,"Thanks so much for this torrent. Dont call me stupid here, but wheres the updater? I just have a file of the game? Do I update in-game? Also, I don't have a minecraft folder in my Application Support folder (for texture themes)"
,KARATYCHICKEN,2011-09-19T23:04Z,"the updater is the ""force update"" box when you start up and you cannot not have a minecraft folder in application support as the actual game is stored there (so you can't play if you don't have a minecraft folder...) please email me at dontuspammenow@hotmail.com because every thing is explained in the comment section though I am happy to help... if you email me :)"
,ice_bat,2011-12-12T03:35Z,"i tried other torrents, but this one is the best for mac

works perfectly, thanks KARATYCHICKEN"
,jordyfoz,2012-01-03T07:37Z,"Help please, I don't have a mine craft 'root' folder in application support. SO therefore, i can add a texture pack... 
I am new to macs so its probably something I'm doing wrong, please help though :)"
,hyenadon,2012-03-27T03:16Z,I'm getting Permission Denied when I download this torrent with BitTorrent. Anyone else having this problem?
,hyenadon,2012-03-27T03:24Z,"Nevermind my previous comment, my Mac was being a tard like always."
,AlarmClock7,2012-04-27T00:14Z,Works wonderfully. Select 'Force Update' when you first start the game and it will download the latest version of Minecraft. Excellent torrent.
,buds4lyfe,2012-05-13T20:50Z,"okay so how do i make the window full screen? im playing this on a 13 inch macbook. its so fun i just wasted 3 1/2 hours on it as soon as it downloaded, but i was leaning forward in my chair so much to see that my back is extremely sore. does anyone else's just show as a tiny window with no  options or settings to change to full screen? at least thats what i have, and i may be missing something (im not much of a mac/pc gamer so it is rather possible.. )"
