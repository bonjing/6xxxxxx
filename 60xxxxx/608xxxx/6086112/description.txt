From Wiki:


Isaac Lee Hayes, Jr. (August 20, 1942 â€“ August 10, 2008) [1] was an American songwriter, musician, singer, and occasionally an actor. Hayes was one of the creative geniuses behind the southern soul music label Stax Records, where he served both as an in-house songwriter and as a record producer, teaming with his partner David Porter during the mid-1960s. Hayes, Porter, Bill Withers, the Sherman Brothers, Steve Cropper, and John Fogerty were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of writing scores of notable songs for themselves, the duo "Sam & Dave", Carla Thomas, and others.

The hit song "Soul Man" written by Hayes and Porter, and first performed by "Sam & Dave" has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame. This song was also honored by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, by Rolling Stone magazine, and by the RIAA as the Songs of the Century.

During the late 1960s, Hayes also became a recording musician, and he recorded several successful soul albums such as Hot Buttered Soul (1969) and Black Moses (1971). In addition to his work in popular music, Hayes worked as composer of musical scores for motion pictures.

Hayes is well known for his musical score for the film Shaft (1971). For his composition of the Theme from Shaft, Hayes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1972. Other than such distinguished actors as Sidney Poitier and Hattie McDaniel, Hayes became the first African-American to win an Academy Award in any field whatsoever covered by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Hayes also won two Grammy Awards for that same year. Later, he was given his third Grammy Award for his music album Black Moses.

During 1992, in recognition of his humanitarian work there, Hayes was crowned as the honorary king of the Ada, Ghana region. Hayes also acted in motion pictures and television, such as in the movie, I'm Gonna Git You Sucka. Then from 1997 to 2005, he lent his distinctive, deep voice to the character "Chef" on the animated TV series South Park, and also to Gandolf "Gandy" Fitch in the TV series The Rockford Files (1974 â€“ 80).

On August 5, 2003, Isaac Hayes was honored as a BMI Icon at the 203 BMI Urban Awards for his enduring influence on generations of music makers.[2] Throughout his songwriting career, Hayes received five BMI R&B Awards, two BMI Pop Awards, two BMI Urban Awards and six Million-Air citations. As of 2008, his songs generated more than 12 million performances. 








Can You Dig It 2005


In the early to mid-1960s, Isaac Hayes played a seminal role in creating the nascent sound of soul music. Yet, as monumental as his early contributions were, they are dwarfed by the impact of such solo albums as Hot Buttered Soul, Shaft,and Black Moses, all released on the now legendary and highly influential Stax Records label between 1969 and 1975. 

Compiled and annotated by Stax biographer Rob Bowman, Ultimate Isaac Hayes â€• Can You Dig It? is a 2-CD collection of seminal recordings from this period in Hayesâ€™s career, a time when he redefined the sonic possibilities of black music with tracks like â€œWalk on By,â€ â€œNever Can Say Goodbye,â€ â€œJoy (part 1),â€ â€œSoulsville,â€ and â€œTheme from Shaft.â€ Hayes would become the most successful artist Stax ever produced, opening the album market as a commercially viable medium for black artists, and one of the most important musicians in the history of R&B.

In stores November 1, Ultimate Isaac Hayes â€• Can You Dig It? includes a bonus DVD featuring three live tracks from Wattstax, a 1972 concert held at the Coliseum in L.A. to raise money for a variety of community needs and to commemorate the 1965 Watts rebellion. Also available is an animation of the modern-funk masterpiece â€œChocolate Salty Ballsâ€ from Comedy Centralâ€™s hit series â€œSouth Park.â€ As his role of Chef, Hayes is the voice of reason and the administrator of cool amongst the misadventures of Kyle, Kenny, Stan, and Cartman. 

Hayes was coaxed into the studio by Stax Records in 1968 to cut Presenting Isaac Hayes (its lead single, â€œPrecious, Precious,â€ included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes, was edited down from an 18-minute jazz-tinged funk vamp). The platinum-selling Hot Buttered Soul followed and attracted attention for combining jazz improvisation, classically-influenced strings, rock guitar, ballad singing, and R&B rhythm. The Jimmy Webb penned â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix,â€ Bacharach & Davidâ€™s â€œWalk on By,â€ and a 9-minute Hayes original called  â€œHyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,â€ from that recording are featured on this new collection.

The Isaac Hayes Movement and To Be Continued came next,and then, in 1971, Hayes was commissioned to write the score for Gordon Parksâ€™s Shaft, one of the first so-called â€œblaxploitationâ€ flicks. The resulting double album and the â€œTheme from Shaftâ€ single were directly responsible for kick-starting disco and the phenomenon of the black soundtrack. The Shaft album went to #1 on both the pop and R&B album charts, staying on the pop listings for a staggering 60 weeks. Shaft earned Hayes both Academy and GRAMMYÂ® Awards, and solidified his position as an African-American icon (Hayesâ€™s soundtracks for two more movies, Three Tough Guys and Truck Turner, are also represented on the CD).

For his next Stax recording, Black Moses, Hayes returned to covering other peopleâ€™s songs, including â€œPart Time Love,â€ â€œNeed to Belong to Someone,â€ and â€œFor the Good Times,â€ the lone exception being â€œGood Love,â€ co-written with trumpeter Mickey Gregory. In March 1972, Hayes released an instrumental cover of Al Greenâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Stay Together.â€ A month later he reunited with former songwriting partner David Porter, releasing a 45 of â€œAinâ€™t That Loving You Baby,â€ a Homer Banksâ€“Allen Jones song, with a cover of Breadâ€™s fall 1971 smash â€œBaby Iâ€™m-A Want Youâ€ on the B-side. All are included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes â€• Can You Dig It?

Later in 1972, Hayes performed at Reverend Jesse Jacksonâ€™s annual PUSH EXPO at Chicagoâ€™s International Amphitheater. Three previously unreleased tracks from Isaacâ€™s show-closing performance are included on Ultimate Isaac Hayes. Kenny Gamble and Thom Bellâ€™s â€œBrand New Me,â€ Luther Ingramâ€™s â€œIf Loving You Is Wrong (I Donâ€™t Want to Be Right),â€ and Isaacâ€™s heartfelt performance of the old Baptist hymn â€œHis Eye Is on the Sparrow.â€

The following year, Hayes focused on writing his own music. Ultimate Isaac Hayes features 13 tracks recorded between 1973 and 1975, and all but two are original compositions. Significantly, one of the exceptions, the set-closing medley of â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix/Say a Little Prayer,â€ is a live concert recording with Dionne Warwick. The other track is Isaacâ€™s cover of Henry Gloverâ€™s â€œSomeone Made You for Me,â€ originally released as the B-side of his last hit for the Stax label, â€œWonderful.â€

In the mid-1970s, Hayes negotiated a deal with ABC Records to create the Hot Buttered Soul label. The two singles from the debut HBS album, â€œChocolate Chipâ€ and â€œCome Live with Me,â€ both went Top 20 R&B and are both featured on Ultimate Isaac Hayes. Three further HBS singles, â€œDisco Connection,â€ â€œRock Me Easy Baby (Part 1),â€ and the aforementioned duet with Dionne Warwick, â€œBy the Time I Get to Phoenix/I Say a Little Prayerâ€ (all included here in their single edits), all reached the R&B chart.

In 2002, Isaac Hayes was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Universally recognized as a ground-breaking figure in mainstream R&B, soul and black music, some of Hayesâ€™s most important work comes from his time spent recording for the Stax family of labels. Ultimate Isaac Hayes â€• Can You Dig It? is an essential anthology and historically significant collection from one of music historyâ€™s most innovative artists.
