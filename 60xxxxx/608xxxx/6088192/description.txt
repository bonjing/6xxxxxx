THE FABULOUS THUNDERBIRDS  GIRLS GO WILD
Label Benchmark 
Orig Year 1979
Format:Mp3@320

Minimally produced (nary an overdub to be heard), the Fabulous Thunderbirds\\\' first album showcases their tough, modern approach to the blues, with an energy and integrity that also appealed to fans of the nascent post punk/new wave bands of the day. Highlights include a faithfully swampy cover of Slim Harpo\\\'s \\\"Scratch My Back.\\\"

Leader Kim Wilson\\\'s \\\"Rocket Pocket\\\" is a harmonica showcase a la Little Walter, while \\\"Rich Woman\\\" appropriates the riff from Bo Diddley\\\'s \\\"Diddley Daddy\\\" (the same one the Stones borrowed for \\\"19th Nervous Breakdown\\\"). The bonus track \\\"Things I Forgot to Do\\\" is a nice slow New Orleans style ballad, in which the T-Birds are joined by the horns from Roomful Of Blues.
