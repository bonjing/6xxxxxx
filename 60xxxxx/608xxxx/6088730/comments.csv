,lodestar738,2011-01-09T03:58Z,"UK_Squiff: I don't know, this is Komu crack from another torent, work's for fs9(confirmed), i don't tried. I Upload this crack to use only if you get ""Invalid Licence"" or something like that. I've done this for you and martronn :o)) 
it seems that first torent work's for most people without crack. Tell me if everything is ok now    "
,JUST4KICKX23,2011-01-09T16:39Z,It freezes up after a few min for me..like the old one used to
,lodestar738,2011-01-09T17:11Z,"Did you tried without this crack? Work's perfect for me. I tried to use crack and FSX crash to desctop, i deleted crack and put back old digichk4.dll and work's perfect. I heard on tpb about komu cracks - just don't works for every system. Try to 1.uninstal and remove digichk4.dll from FS main folder, and 2.reinstall from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6076730/FSX_FS9_DA_Fokker_70___100 without crack. 3.Install SP 2.5, run 4.fsx. 5.Close fsx. Restart computer and then install sp 2.5 again"
