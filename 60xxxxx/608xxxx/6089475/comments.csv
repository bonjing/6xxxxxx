This makes it so much easier to find a specific episode.
:D  "
,spunkedunken,2011-01-20T15:55Z,"Suggestion once you've downloaded this, download one of the other torrent collection (at least 1-6) which include the missing 2 episodes from this. Pause the torrent, select details, mark the 2 missing as high priority and the rest as don't download. Then start the torrent again and voila; all episodes."
,spunkedunken,2011-01-20T23:59Z,"current DL speed is roughly 100k/s, could use more speed.

,wanda_5,2011-02-21T10:34Z,"I got to give some respect just because you didn't remove the ripper names (FQM etc.) due it helps a lot to find correct subtitles for each episode (if any).

Thanks."
