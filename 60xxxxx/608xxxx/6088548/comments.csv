,donatellomartie,2011-07-13T10:51Z,How do I transfer this to my psp? Do I have to always go to recovery menu then select m33 before playing?
,donatellomartie,2011-07-13T14:24Z,Just like the comments above.. It is working on 5.50 gen d3. ;)
,artdnr,2011-10-31T14:23Z,"WasnÂ´t working on 5.00 M33-6 (PSP2001). After patching it with EDecrypt 1.4, worked great.

Since I wasnÂ´t able to find a 5.00 M33-6 patched version here on TPB, I made my first torrent with the patched version.

FaMoUz, thanks for the original ISO!
