Love.Live.Life, N-Dubz\'s third studio album, follows the group\'s first two platinum-selling albums Uncle B (2008) and Against All Odds (2009).Following the release of the group\'s MOBO Award-winning single \"Playing with Fire\" in January of 2010,N-Dubz announced that they will embark on a trip to the United States in an attempt to secure a recording deal for themselves there.The group, however, were banned from travelling to the country because of visa issues which were later resolved in early February.Def Jam Recordings boss, L.A. Reid, a big N-Dubz fan, then arranged a meeting with the group with the intention of signing the trio to his label.In May 2010, it was announced that the group had secured a five-album recording deal with Def Jam,and that they would be flying to Los Angeles, California to record their third studio album with American producers Dr. Luke and Jim Jonsin.
