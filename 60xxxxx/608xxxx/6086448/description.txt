Cracked, Tweak Pack and Skin by ADHDerby


PowerDVD is the consumerâ€™s favorite Blu-ray / DVD playback software, complemented by high-definition Dolby and DTS audio technologies. PowerDVD now converts 2D movies into 3D, plays an extensive range of video formats including MKV, FLV, 3GP, and makes movies social by sharing bookmark reviews and live comments. Experience PowerDVD - the best Blu-ray playback and DVD player software available today.

Supported formats for Blu-ray & DVD playback:
- Supports the latest video formats: MKV, FLV, 3GP, AVCHD and AVCREC

- Transform 2D into 3D
- Compatible with Windows 7

Languages: English, Chinese Traditional, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Chinese Simplified, German, French, Italian


Preactivated Recompressed Setup:
- Installs the Mark II Ultra Max Version, pre-activated & pre-registered
- The MoovieLive, Remix and the Comment features are disabled by default
- Sets the cursor hide time in Full Screen to 1 second (default = 3 sec)
- Unlocks DVD-Audio (MLP) support + TruSurround XT & TSXT Headphone Mode

TruSurround XT is the second generation of SRS TruSurround. Building upon its patented predecessor and namesake, TruSurround XT not only solves the problem of playing 5.1 or 6.1 multichannel content over two speakers or headphones, but also utilizes proprietary algorithms from SRS Labs - Dialog Clarity and TruBass - to provide listeners with a truly immersive audio experience.

TruSurround XT accepts input from up to a 7 channel (6.1) audio source and processing a 2 channel output. When receiving multichannel content, TruSurround XT virtualizes the channels, creating "phantom" speakers that appear to extend all
around the listener, producing an amazing surround sound effect. When receiving mono or stereo content, TruSurround XT includes the functionality of SRS WOW to present an expansive three dimensional sound field.

Note about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!!
You get exactly the same warning when you download and install the retial version because it's the same setup.
I only removed and modified some files to disable MoovieLive, Movie Remix and RichVideo and to make it pre-activated!

Here's how to check the Digital Signatures:
- Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip and open the directory where you extracted the files
- Right click on an exe file, select properties and click on the Digital Signatures tab
- Double click on the Signature and read the line below "Digital Signature Information"
- If it says that the Digital Signature is OK, it means that the file isn't altered!
-Click on the "View Certificate" button for more information

======================================================================================================================


Install: Just run Setup.exe and you are done, it's registered and activated.

Note: This Setup does not install the PowerDVD Toolbar (Mini Player Mode)
If you want to use it then extract the Tweak Pack and run Enable_Toolbar.bat
