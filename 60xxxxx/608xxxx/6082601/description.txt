Listening to I Had the Blues but I Shook Them Loose I was trying to deduce what is this special thing in Bombay Bicycle Club that makes them sound rather unpleasant. And in the end I decided that there are few factors: itâ€™s their primitive and unmusical beats, itâ€™s their lacklustre barking vocals, itâ€™s their lack of creative impulse and at last itâ€™s the sameness of their uninspired stuff. What is on their side then? Is it their wish to sound original? But as the saying goes the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
