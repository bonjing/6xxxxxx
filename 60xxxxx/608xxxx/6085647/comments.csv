What is pantz? 
you not being able to download?
you not being able to burn a CD?
you not being able to load the CD?
you not being able to read instructions?

wtf?

This has detailed instuctions on how to get from the download to a fully working sat nav disk, I have done it and it works perfectly!"

Burnt using the excellent instructions included and my navigation is now updated in my 2002 A6 2.7t (the one with the navigation in the instrument cluster DIS)

Thanks to the upper and happy navigating to all!"
