It's the copy of the movie that is sent from movie studios to movie theaters to allow them to see it before they 'buy' it and show it in their theater(s).  It's the TeleSync's/TeleCene's(sp?) and CAM copies that are usually crap quality..  grainy video and scratchy sound on most of them.

Thank you ExtremeZone"
,jlh1976,2011-01-29T22:10Z,"I use Peerguardian.  Doesn't it compile a list and block out ip's it knows to track this sort of thing, such as blocking Comcast from seeing what I'm downloading?"
,Powerslave0,2011-01-30T05:49Z,"It is not actually your ISP that catches you, it's RIAA, or another organization as such, that downloads and tracks all seeders by their IP addresses.  You can FORCE encryption, but that only means your ISP can't see what's in the packets you send out, but the receiver still gets the packets.  Usually, the copyright owner, or whoever is doing it, grabs 1K to less than 1K of the file you are seeding, which is enough.  PeerBlock and other such programs only work if it has the right IP addresses to block.  You cannot stop uploading, and if you do, that's a pretty crappy way of doing things.  You would have to block the port your Torrent client is using, which will block incoming connections for outbound traffic."

,arata75,2011-02-07T02:37Z,"This is really good quality, but why does everyone talk really really fast in the second half of the movie? It's like it's been sped up and it's really distracting. Is that just how the movie is? Even the soundtrack at the end (""Bad"" by Michael Jackson"") is sped up. Really great movie ruined by that. The first half was golden, but it hit a climax about half way through from which it did not fall gracefully. Shame."

,dawdyang,2011-02-10T16:26Z,"K I just want to comment on all the dumbasses out there who dont know shit about a good dl. This is perfect quality. Why do you think 3000 plus people have dl this movie. Extremezone is a VERY trusted source for dl's I have most of my movies from this source. If you have a problem with the 2 cds isssue dl Convert x to dvd version 4 from PB it comes with keys and all. Then merge to one disc. Its that simple. I am literally a ""computer idiot"" and I managed to figure it out ON MY OWN with no instructions so guys and girls, THINK before you write a shitty comment about audio, video, dl speed, rar viles etc"
,binkiefc,2011-02-12T04:07Z,"Aww, how cute!!! A literal computer ""computer idiot"" is giving us commentary on etiquette for packaged torrents. That is really all I wanted to say, the post claiming knowledge on the subject before claiming no knowledge was funny to me, but what do I know, I'm just a chick who works as a tech nerd.

Speaking of etiquette, 
V=8
A=8
Packaging=4, maybe three, it did kind of annoy me a little but the content is good."
,binkiefc,2011-02-12T04:11Z,"Oh, I almost forgot to mention, his other torrent, the DVD rip is great. Quality is close to DVD IMHO."
,9GustavBecker9,2011-02-12T05:37Z,"Has anyone ever noticed how titties have a tendency to bounce, quite in unison with mounds of ass pillows... as if they both were doing it on purpose just to say..., ""LOOK""? Just jump in place in front of a mirror girls, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Is it just my imagination, or is there any validity to my observation?"
,binkiefc,2011-02-12T19:27Z,"Here is how I think the above comment came about. ""Oh my God, it's a girl."" ""Yeah we should say something, uhh, what should we say."" ""I don't know, something about boobs."" ""Yeah, that would be cool."" Enjoy the single life boys, sounds like you'll have it for a long time."

,mburke79,2011-02-26T14:09Z,"Its probably because I'm a TPB n00b but I have tried downloading this 3 times and each time it stops at 1.43GB out of 1.44GB (99.12%).  I'm uploading it to others but it will not finish the download.  

Using Transmission on Mac OS X.

Help!"

I'm nitpicking but in really dark scenes you could see slight pixelation if you were paying attention to it but still fabulous quality. Totally watchable. Great torrent. "
