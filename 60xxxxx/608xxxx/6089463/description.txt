Acoustic version of her 1995 Studio album. It was
originally only available through Starbucks outlets!
I saw her perform this acoustic tour live in the
summer of 2005.

I could not find FLAC version of this recording on
TPB, so here you go.  If you like Alanis and you like
acoustic, you should enjoy this one.

Please help to seed

CD to FLAC using xACT with zero errors.
