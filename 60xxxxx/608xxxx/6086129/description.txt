Install: Download the Game, Then you need Open Manager v2.1 I on your PS3
2) Format a Usb stick (4gb will do) fat32 and copy the folder into it.
It will tell you that one file is to big (11,2GB) just click continue.
3) Now  go to your ps3 and copy over the game from your usb into your ps3.
4) Start FTP (R1 button in Open Manager)(you need to be on the same router as your pc is.
5) Go to your pc and open FileZilla (free program just google the site)
6) type in at host the ip of your PS3 (open manager on the ps3 tells you that)
7) Now in filezilla username = FTPD12345   and Password = donkerinternet
8) Go to game>OMAN456765 (or something like that some have OMAN12345)
9) Go to folder BCES00569 > PS3_GAME > USRDIR and copy the file from the torrent: GT.VOL in it now just wait to finish.

enjoy!! 2011

NOTE: IF ps3 FREEZES JUST RESTART YOUR PS3 and Open Open Manager again and restart the ftp. In filezilla just readd the GT.VOL in that folder and click by sections on Continue (in dutch Hervatten or in other languages something else)

I DON:T THINK THE PS3 WILL FREEZE BUT JUST IN CASE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO!!

Greats Donkerinternet
