,pdscoelho,2011-01-07T06:16Z,needs more seeds...
,donkerinternet,2011-01-07T16:34Z,"@pdscoelho   That will be a bit hard because i just uploaded it. That why it's very important when people download it they keep seeding like they did with my other torrent: COD Black Ops Patched 3.41 :-) so people keep up the seeding!

But where are you? We're all stuck at 24.7%.
Oh - and Filezilla always locks up, on Win 7 anyway, so we use WinSCP. Much more stable...I think?  "
,donb11,2011-01-08T18:14Z,Can u play this on a jailbroken 3.55?

!!!!!!!!!!"
,zum,2011-01-08T21:09Z,people keep up the seeding!
,Podgkin,2011-01-09T10:55Z,"@donb11 Not yet, although 'Geohot' has released a patch to allow Homebrew options on 3.55....so it may happen soon?
And you still cannot play online without another PS3 updated accordingly. :P"
,donkerinternet,2011-01-09T11:03Z,"@Podgkin I'm Jackieboy8 but that acount was removed accedently and I had a lot of torrents but now I have to start over. If you google donkerintenet (myself) than you will find some of my old torrents
And about seeding a lot of people now are on 50% so I think Everything is going to be fine. Thx man
and Fillezilla works great here in win7 ultimate x64 so i think maybe update it? But Winscp should work too i think. But its the ps3 who freezes with transfer not fillezilla ;-)
@donb1 A jailbroken 3.55 don't yet support back ups only new signed home brew. But wouldn;t take too long before thats fixed ;)
Greats From holland"
,donkerinternet,2011-01-18T18:47Z,Will add a patch soon so you can play it on CFW 3.55 with Multiman with new Peek/Poke CFW 3.55
,darkpark11,2011-01-20T19:29Z,"Hi, I am new downloading PS3 games through torrents. From what I understand you need to have some sort of PSGroove software on a USB. Could you tell me where the cheapest or most reliable place I could get one of these. I would be seeding all of the torrents that I downloaded. Thanks"

,Podgkin,2011-01-23T09:36Z,"@darkpark11 - I use PriceAngels (.) com....they're cheap and only take about 2 weeks or so to get to the UK.
Currently using a PS3 Go GT Break (with switch for slim). :D

@brahmafouad - same problem with GT5? Gets through intros and instal but then get a grey GT logo that fades out, and then it will only reappear if I press 'O' (get a 'bong' sound) or 'X' (get a 'bing')...and then just sits on the screen?
Is this to do with the massive install files problem, donkerinternet???
Help! :P"

,Lateralus1980,2011-01-31T23:45Z,"@donkerinternet thank you for this torrent. The game works great except for it freezes when attempting to get your b-class liscence. The progress bar fills up but then it doesn't go to the next screen. Anyone else having this problem? Any solutions?

@darkpark11. I use a blackcat USB stick. It is fully progammable with all psgroove updates. Works great. Easy youtube tutorials for upgrades.

,donkerinternet,2011-02-03T13:28Z,To make Gran Turismo 5 patched 3.41 Work with CFW3.55 and higher download this:  and hit direct download. Replace it with the old eboot
,donkerinternet,2011-02-03T13:36Z,http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6147346 to make it work with CFW 3.55 and higher
,pdscoelho,2011-02-04T18:12Z,Hey thanks for the original eboot file donkerinternet. When i start up the game it loads a few pictures like Polydigital then it freezes....got too excited. Please tell me the config you used on 3.55 cfw to get this working?  
,pdscoelho,2011-02-07T21:40Z,I've finally got it working. I deleted some game saves and game data and that did the trick for me on cfw 3.55 kmeaw. Thanks again for the quality upload
,gabrielmalki,2011-02-24T16:10Z,"donkerinternet,

Ik heb het gedownload maar ik snap dat gedeelte niet helemaal met filezilla. Ik heb Win7. Ik heb het geprobeerd met WinSCP maar kan niet inloggen. 

Zonder dat als ik hem kopieer op de ps3 en speel start die op vraagt die om taal en scherm dan zie ik dat gran turismo teken en dan blijft het zwart. Met CFW 3.55 kan ik niet eens opstarten en blijft zwart. Terwijl ik 3.55 erop heb staan.
graag hulp

de groeten !"

@pdscoelho
I have the same problem, freezes after Polydigital... I'm using 3.55CFW Kmeaw, Multiman 1.16.08... Running game internally, updated 1.05, but still it freezes... Could you share how you did it?
"
,gmakris23,2011-07-03T12:32Z,"Hi there, my problem is that it freezes right after you hit cancel for the game update and i don't get the ""click by sections on continue"" for filezilla anybody knows where is that option?"
