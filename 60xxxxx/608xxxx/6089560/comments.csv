,Deksinjo,2011-02-27T14:38Z,"Have problem on win7, install joiner and cuter but joiner won't add subtitle. Look like only do cutting not add title . :S "
,Deksinjo,2011-02-28T19:54Z,"Correction
Everything is ok, just you can do converting ""same like source file"" and put subtitle , must convert on some format and then add subtitle."

,chas1625,2011-03-20T11:53Z,"I know these are older programs but just wanted to say what great, simple & FAST video tools these are.  Work great.  Thumbs up!"
,3008,2011-03-22T15:36Z,Not working on win 7
,donkeydick121,2011-05-10T14:53Z,"Had a problem with this (Ultra Video Converter) and the previous version coz when it renders a file it puts the result in C:\Windows\SysWOW64 even when you tell it not to. 

Obviously a bug in the software as I've been using version 4 for a couple of years without a problem. But the newest version 5.2.0411 from their site works as it should with this serial number and is really fast.

When you give it 4 or more files to render it uses all 4 cores of the CPU!!

Just voted 4 u thx :)"
,kritias,2011-05-19T04:01Z,"works great, and the program registered itself. w00t!"

,p3t3r_g,2011-05-28T06:50Z,"easy+fast+0 a/v quality loss = PERFECT!

since im into dvdrips (vobs) i used it more often than the powerdirector9. power9 cannot edit without converting it from orig format . it has no vob output. 

thanks sleek"
,Nonpoint187,2011-06-03T09:28Z,Is this as easy to use as converxtodvd for converting mkv to dvd files/image and burning?
,p3t3r_g,2011-06-12T16:03Z,"i was wrong. its not perfect. be careful when joining vob files/movie scense. it SHORTENED it by 15 seconds to minutes depending on the length of your movie. 

you might as well use powerdirector (but it has no SAME SOURCE OUTPUT) "
,Ancalimon1960,2011-08-09T21:58Z,"Pro job well done. Kick ass installation menu with Sublime 'loving is what i got' background music 
Slickinator you're a class act, bro"
