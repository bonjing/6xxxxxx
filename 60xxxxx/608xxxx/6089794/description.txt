             Wouldn't a second opinion be great when it comes to checking  
             your PC for malware? How about a second, third, fourth and   
             fifth opinion, then? And all in one go!                      
                                                                          
             As our online activity increases, so does the threat of an   
             attack from a malicious program or virus. Long gone are the  
             days, when single hackers were out to make a name for        
             themselves. Today, organized cybercriminals are              
             systematically out to steal your money with an ever growing  
             number of malware attacks and schemes.                       
                                                                          
             We believe that only a diverse and multi-layered security    
             concept can combat the bad guys and keep your PC safe.       
             Beyond Coranti's simple and friendly user interface lies an  
             unrivalled security product that is powered by not one, but  
             four world-class anti-malware scanning engines, each
