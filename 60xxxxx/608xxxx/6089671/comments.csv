Was waiting for it! :) "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-08T14:46Z,"Thanks. I was thinking that I spoiled many with my 720p stuff (which, honestly, I don't like very much as is too frikkin big).

@Manualist: Unfortunately no. I watched first two episodes and the first one of this season - and I have opinion that you wouldn't like. In my defense, I really like British TV and I carry many shows."
,dark_defender,2011-01-08T14:54Z,"I am not able to find a torrent for this title:

If you can find it would you encode it? If not, can you atleast provide a torrent link for the title? I really want to watch this movie.

Thanks in Advance !!"

,jon4fun,2011-01-08T18:14Z,"@ LAZIO88BG - Just an FYI for future reference.

1) It is a 480p BRRip - the A/V quality will be 10/10 ALWAYS.

2) IF there is ever an issue with A/V qaulity 20-40 always makes a note in the comment section and provides a sample for you to decide. This will, generally, only occur with an R5 or CAM version and even then you won't a better version anywhere!!!!!

3) Never, EVER ask about the quality of a 20-40 encode, whether it be 272p, 352p, 480p, 720p or 1080p or 10milllionP. My point is the qauilty will always be good, ALWAYS; Or he will give fair warning and at your own risk.

I refer you to Tron-Legacy http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6057149/Tron.Legacy.2010.TS.352p.H264 
READ the comments, please!

I'm not going off on you for the fun of it, it is just a stupid/ignorant question and insults the man.
