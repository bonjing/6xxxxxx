,jarrodjay,2011-02-24T01:23Z,Any chance of getting Baldies? :D Thanks for all your work!
,exploboy,2011-02-28T12:11Z,"first of all, thank you for all these wonderful collections. these games are amazing and i'm so glad to be playing them again.

unfortunately, your copy of twinsen's odyssey is a demo. it cuts off right after you get out of the first building :(. 

does syndicate: american revolt include the original syndicate?

also, a few requests: Z (the bitmap bros RTS), Magic Carpet, Sid Meier's Covert Action, Crusader: No Remorse, Crusader: No Regret, and Sword of the Samurai

thank you again; this series utterly rocks my world. i'll be seeding."
,exploboy,2011-02-28T12:13Z,oh also Discworld II: Mortality Bites would be greatly appreciated.
,exploboy,2011-02-28T12:16Z,oh and gene wars! my goodness. i hope i'm not being too demanding. but there are just so many wonderful dos games out there and i'm ecstatic about their renewed availability.
,exploboy,2011-02-28T12:25Z,"actually it's not twinsen's odyssey at all. that's the sequel. it's little big adventure, aka relentless, which is a demo, and also mislabelled twinsen's odyssey. which i post only for clarity! i don't mean to be a jerk, i appreciate your efforts immensely."
,Signus12,2011-03-08T03:13Z,"Ez mate, is there any way I can reach you via email? I'm having trouble with one of the volumes, the download doesn't start once I open the torrent and I really need to get my hands on ""Day of the Tentacle"", ""Sam & Max Hit the Road"" and ""Monkey Island"". All your other torrents have worked fine and I salute you for making these classics available on apple mac."
,stuff1288,2011-03-09T02:48Z,"Nice work on these collections, a lot of awesome old favorites. If you could include Diablo 1 in your next pack that would be amazing, been trying to find it for a long time for my Intel. "
