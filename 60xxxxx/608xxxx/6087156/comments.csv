,TorrentTimUK,2011-01-16T21:14Z,FYI...Watchable but had a lot of background noise. Thanks.
,denman123a,2011-01-20T03:07Z,"Thx VTV and seeders, ... good fast D/L and excellent playback, ... TPB rules; torrentzap not so much"
,hond120,2011-01-22T17:29Z,"@ TorrentTimUK
at the releases of VTV are never watchable.
Thet are always perfect without any background noices. I think you need a better player that would be the problem"
,Toby196,2012-04-14T16:09Z,"Thanks again, VTV (and all those who are still seeding).  It's great to be able to find an episode that is over a year old (what can I say, I'm a late comer concerning ""The Mentalist"")."
