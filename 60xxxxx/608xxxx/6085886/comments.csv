First you need to install xcode from apple, then install macports, then download gdb7.2 zip. install gdb from terminal. type in: sudo port install gdb  - after it installs type: gdb test  - and it should run gdb in terminal. make sure you uninstall any previous versions of protools. i am up and running, and it is AWESOME !!!!! Running with digi 002, reason 5, and ableton 8 suite. Good times!"
,Minimaskot,2011-01-13T22:16Z,"Noo, i JUST installed it and it works perfect!


This is EXACTLY what i did, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS!


i installed this last night.

first, you'll need to have Xcode installed and this will install the ""gdb""
search on google and you'll find it.

do a full uninstall of pro tools, after that go to application folder and delete the digidesign and or avid folder.

2^ => install xcode (mac developer site, YES i registred as a developer)
3^ => install full pro tools.(i DID reboot after install)
4^ => go to the ""additional folder and install "" complete tollkit 2 "" and ""heat""
5^ => install the loader.
6^ => reboot your mac.
7=> lauch pt 9 loader in the app => avid => PT9 LOADER.


I didnt even touch the original PT9 icon, ONLY open PT9Loader file!

Hope it works for you!

,martinio21,2011-02-09T18:27Z,"HEAT wont work unless you have Pro tools HD hardware. It uses PT-HD PCI processing cards to run. If you don't have em you can forget about getting HEAT working.
imo this release really isn't stable enough. 
I installed Xcode and got PT running and working well but as soon as i tried to install Waves plugins PT9 would freeze on startup. Both Live and Logic load up fine so i'm guessing it has something to do with the loader.
Uninstalling Waves solved the problem but after about two days I now get random error messages claming that no ilok can be located and the program shuts down.
Wait for a official release from AiR, XVX, etc."

You'll need to read between the lines... just thought you should know.

,Ca1m_down,2012-01-01T07:03Z,"@sega123 this was earlier on in the comments

""first, you'll need to have Xcode installed and this will install the ""gdb""
search on google and you'll find it.

do a full uninstall of pro tools, after that go to application folder and delete the digidesign and or avid folder.

2^ => install xcode (mac developer site, YES i registred as a developer)
3^ => install full pro tools.(i DID reboot after install)
4^ => go to the ""additional folder and install "" complete tollkit 2 "" and ""heat""
5^ => install the loader.
6^ => reboot your mac.
7=> lauch pt 9 loader in the app => avid => PT9 LOADER.


I didnt even touch the original PT9 icon, ONLY open PT9Loader file!""

,tjneisi,2012-03-02T03:03Z,"If PT hangs or freezes on the ""Creating DAE Objects"" action on the splash screen, try restarting PT9 while holding down ""n"" on your keyboard.  A menu should pop up before too long.  On this menu, check ""Minimize Additional I/O Latency.""  Push Ok.  Start up should continue.

That solved the freeze for me, but then I had this error message pop up: 

'Could not create a new document because Assertion in ""/Volumes/Development/we.Preston/AlturaPorts/DFW/MacBuild/../Views/UMenu.MacOS.mm"", line 1346.'

Apparently this problem is from not having a beefy enough Sound Card.  (Especially if you also get a message about not being able to run sound at 196k) It seems that the recommended sound card for hackintosh users is the M-Audio Audiophile 2496.  I can't verify that yet, as I've only just ordered said sound card.  Hopefully that fixes it for me.  More details on this problem found here:
