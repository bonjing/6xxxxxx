I was wondering, do you have an email or something i could write to you at? Because i want to discuss how many episodes you have on your computer, to see if you could put together a burned-CD/DVD for my mom, of a collection of AMC episodes!! I'd be willing to pay! I just really want to catch her up so she can start watching again..........when SOAPnet left basic cable, she had to stop watching it! And she's been watching for 30 years, so i feel really bad ya know!??


Let me know!!
I'll check back here later! "
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-01-04T23:07Z,Hi missJiaLi! I wish I could help you and your mum. I only have the AMC episodes from the last 2 months...I'm not quite sure if this is what you want...Please let me know if I can do something for you.
,missJiaLi,2011-01-05T00:25Z,"Oh that's perfect!!!
Do you think it would be easy for you to burn all of them to a DVD or would it be easier to upload them in a massive torrent!??

I'm not sure how big that would be though with the AVI's.....like over 6 gigs right?? [and anything over 2 gigs would take me forever to download on dial up! LOL]


What way do you think would be easiest for you!??"
[V],ClaudiaZ,2011-01-05T20:58Z,"Well, I'm resharing them all from November 5. Please let me know when you get some of them. Hope this is fine for you."
,missJiaLi,2011-01-06T05:17Z,Thank you soooo much!!! and i will!
