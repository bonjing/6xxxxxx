I have read your descriptions and what i can say to you is that you know that the bell rings, but does not have the clue in which church.
You lists various modes you use for compatibility but does not say a single word about what is the real SOUL of video`s compatibility - AVC LEVELS and AVC PROFILES you use. Without it everything what you wrote is totally useless and only make the mess in people`s mind.

As for your encodes i wonder that if you dont use B-frames and CABAC does it mean you use BASELINE PROFILE?"
