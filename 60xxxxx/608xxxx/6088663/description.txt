Hi, at this time, we are focused in our seeding on our "Tommy and tuppence"
partners in crime complete collection (going great since the beginning!) and I
see that we are so far invested to the tune of 160GB into our launch of Rumpole! Our Maigret is of great focus for us too!

We are siphoning off just a little bandwidth from some other torrents to give
our folks in Australia this movie launch from 2008 starring Ms. Nicole Kidman -
title of the same name. Its about the wisdom of abandoning the policy of trying
to assimilate aboriginals into Australian Mainstream society. This picture shows
the dynamics that would have been involved and the challenges of this task in 
hindsight equally too.

Lovely 1280 X 720p video, 192k audio

Enjoy! I love the folks in Australia where my heart is always exclusively most
truly at home!

PS The next movie better be centered in Melbourne or Adelaide etc huh!
There's real beauty there indeed, for crissakes - far more than equally, I submit
to you!
