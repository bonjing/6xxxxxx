,Mrmelkor,2011-02-16T07:29Z,"Well shit same. Every crack in this package contains virus.
Symantec report Infostealer and Keylogger. "
,davesantulan,2011-02-17T14:44Z,"well as I said on the info some av might detect the crack as I virus because the first time I used it Bitdefender marked it as malicious. But I scanned it with eset, avg, avast and its clean. I also tested it on other computer and its safe to use."
,JYshadow,2011-03-15T07:50Z,Soo... has it a virus or is it fake?
,davesantulan,2011-03-16T08:07Z,@shadow. some av software detects the patch as harmful but its just false positive. If your av detects it as a virus just add it to exclusion list.
