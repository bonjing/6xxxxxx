,RichterEX2,2011-01-04T05:22Z,"Correction...

Resolution is 1440x1080 (4:3)"
,RichterEX2,2011-01-04T06:07Z,"Also, this may take a while to seed. My up speed is only 50 KB/s."
,PkmnMstr,2011-01-04T07:50Z,"Is 1080p really necessary? If you have the time and space to get it, I guess this is great. I'm okay with the 720p sets though. I really don't think traditional animation needs to be 1080. Only CGI and stuff, but that's my opinion. I was going to get this, but it was going to take too long."
,ChocolateMunkay,2011-01-04T09:45Z,"Yeah, I agree with PkmnMstr. It's a great torrent and all, and I would definitely download and seed, but it takes up way too much space. 

If there was any way you could upload it in 720p that would be awesome! But if not, I understand. 

Regardless, thanks for the upload. :)"
,HundeBrot,2011-01-05T17:42Z,disk space is oh so expensive and why are you complaining about something that is for free?
,Saberoph,2011-01-07T18:53Z,Come on people SEED!
,RichterEX2,2011-01-07T23:21Z,"Literally seeding as fast as I can. Again, my up speed is only 50 KB/s max. Not much I can do unless I change ISPs. XD"
,Saberoph,2011-01-12T18:55Z,"Thank you, but other people who DL this needs to seed too. Come on people...please."
,RichterEX2,2011-01-31T06:56Z,"Well, it took me nearly a month to get this fully seeded. Now maybe someone with better bandwidth than I can keep it up. :D"
,RichterEX2,2011-02-01T05:50Z,"Yet another correction, the audio is only standard AC3 5.1 @ 448Kbps. Apparently MakeMKV doesn't do TrueHD, and I've yet to find a BluRay->MKV converter that will make 5.1 FLAC MKVs."
,go-naz,2011-02-23T15:30Z,anyone knows how i can get a hold of part 4? or the remaining episodes?
,RichterEX2,2011-02-24T05:48Z,"Season 1, Part 4 isn't out yet. Wait a month."
,RichterEX2,2011-02-24T05:54Z,"Also, the torrent for it won't be coming from me. This one literally took a month to upload, only to realize it didn't even have TrueHD audio in it after converting to MKV. So I'll leave it to more capable and competent folk."
,Safetyfailure,2011-03-24T22:50Z,damn nigga you leavin me hanging
,blackxino,2011-06-28T20:09Z,"thanks for uploading.
