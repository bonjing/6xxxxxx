,filaterrinda,2011-01-06T08:24Z,"Well done for the u/l.Very good copy , well watchable.Can you try and u/l The Green Hornet if poss plz.Keep up the good work......"

V - 6,5
A - 8"
,breena51,2011-01-06T15:58Z,what did you expect from a piece of crap movie that tries to remake a superior award winning movie. Only the DUKE can play this part. hollywood should be shot for doing this to the Duke.
,bokehjoe,2011-01-08T08:47Z,"First- A BIG THx to HERO_No_1 & IMAGiNE for the source and upload.  Yous Guys are my Heros. 
Second- Right ON RoosterMoans!  I love it when someone that actually has information posts something informative. Personally- I was never a JW fan, and from the trailers- it looks like Jeff B. does a hell of a lot better job in the Rooster C. role.  Anyway- I digress once again. Thanks for handing breena51 their proverbial ass for their inane remarks. "
,dearghoul,2011-01-12T22:27Z,"Yeah, the 1969 version was sooo good that the coen brothers were laughing about it on NPR just now. They still haven't watched it since they were kids.
John Wayne = joke."
,Ouzotime,2011-01-14T04:30Z,no offence to the uploader but i will wait for a better copy from what i read this new version of true grit is far better then the john wayne version...i will agree only when i watch it..as for breena51 get ovet it...roostermoans and bokehjoe nice comments..regards from a greek/canadian
,ashling51,2011-01-14T20:51Z,"@roostermoans Thank you. I am an avid reader. I enjoy movies, but lets face it, the books are always better. :)"
,matty_L,2011-01-15T01:16Z,"how do you get invited to private torrent sites i got infringement notice for downloading movies america and australia have signed some deal with each other,other than that it was good movie "
,hannahtofu,2011-01-17T01:09Z,"everyone saying that this is a bad movie and shouldnt download is dumb. would you go to a video store and yell out ""dont rent this movie! it sucks ass! blah blah blah rant rant rant im a movie critic!""

but man..if you totally would do this. then you should...itd be an interesting day at the video store. "
,wudabout,2011-01-18T23:37Z,Great quality!  Thank you!

,bleepundo,2011-01-30T05:51Z,"Hey, rocco.
How many cams have you really seen?

This is a great copy
A 8

very much watchable.


Thanks."
,bleepundo,2011-01-30T06:01Z,"Sorry.. 
V 6Â˝
compared to a dvdrip.. 

But this is definately not a cam."
,winealot,2011-02-01T09:39Z,"To breena51, in addition to roostermoans' info, this is an entirely original take of the novel.  The directors, the Cohen bros, are widely known for staying true to the diction of the timeframe of their movies.  The complicated linguistic parlays they are known for, have given them a cult following - some love their movies and some don't.  Either way, they do have artistic flair and a unique style unmatched in current filmmaking.  Having grown up a John Wayne lover myself, I can tell you that there is room both in Hollywood and in my collection for both renditions."
,tai69,2011-02-02T20:19Z,"THIS IS NOT A SCREENER!!!!!! This visual isn't close to the same. This same the same shitty quality as all the others.

V-5-6
A- 6-7

Bleepundo, this is probably a TS, which is really just a CAM. There are very few real TS's around. It certainly isn't a screener. It isn't even the same visual quality as an R5. Whether a film is watchable or not is very subjective.

For a CAM or TS, it would be considered a good copy. 

The audio is quite good for a CAM; it isn't tinny. Many sound like the audio is coming from another room. For a CAM this is quite good.

If you like the quality of a CAM or a TS, you will like this. If you like DVDrips, or R5s, you will be disappointed."
,revbigthunder,2011-02-04T23:53Z,"I have to agree with most 
A:8-9
V:5-6

not too bad....the film was good...not a good as the original but no one can play any john wayne character not even jeff bridges....but he did do a damn good job at it...the little girl was pretty good too...i also alway think of team america when ever i watch any matt damon movie...and with his accent in this film he sounded more the he did in team america....but yea i give the whole film a 8 out 10 stars"
,stanleycarling,2011-02-05T00:08Z,omg yes the video and audio aint to bad..but god its a  shite film didnt even watch it to the end..soooooooooooooooo boring
,nondaras,2011-02-13T01:57Z,thanks
,Ashes_to_Ashes,2011-02-14T08:13Z,"@breena51, show me a good performance by John Wayne and I'll believe it. Jeff Bridges on a bad day is a better actor than that overrated draft dodging pussy. John Wayne has never looked tough, like hes supposed to, and always put on sub-par performances. For some reason people see him as better than he was just because his movies are so old. Clint Eastwood was both a better actor and alot tougher than an overweight guy with a weird voice."
,monkyharris,2011-02-17T01:07Z,"thanks for the upload

anyone know where we can find subs for jeff bridges swahili?"
,bokehjoe,2011-02-18T10:57Z,"Ashes_Ashes-
You forgot one observation of John Wayne besides his weird voice... You didn't mention that he always walked like he had a corn cob stuck up his ass."
,Zeagle,2011-02-24T04:38Z,"bokehjoe, you are close to the fact. While Wayne did not have a corn cob up his ass, the auutopsy found some 40 pounds of impacted shit up his pipe. Now his True Grit performance while not his last, was close to his last. How might one act with an asshole full of shit - a shitty performance I think such as this one. Now Bridges pulls off an act like someone with a clean and unconstipated colon I believe. He may be a vegitarian or possibly gets regular colonics."

This seems to be in vogue in hollywood these days as opposed to when the Duke was around doing westerns and eating his meat. It seem reasonable his performance reflects a man with an ass full of shit."
,vivanho,2011-03-12T05:33Z,"Appreciate the u/l but i think i'll wait. Even as a kid watching the original i was struck by the amazing backdrops, scenery and i hope the new one is similar. For those criticising the Duke's acting i'm reminded of Peter O'Toole's line in an oldie: 'Im not an actor I'm a movie star'. He had presense on screen and in fact Kim Darby's role as the girl in the original will be hard to better as well. Looking forward to it."
,Halizar,2011-03-14T17:26Z,Thanks for the small torrent. Makes a big difference when you download as much as I do.
,qq12,2011-03-24T19:46Z,Thanks man. decent quality. Nothing to fuss about so much
,jakewhite,2011-03-29T16:29Z,is this still being tracked?
,blusniffer,2011-05-04T02:10Z,Whats a blue skull mean hero?
,Vantek,2011-05-09T00:32Z,"Haha, the choice of scene from the movie for the sample clip made me laugh.

A6/V6, but doesn't look like you're gonna get any better until the movie is actually released on DVD/BR"
,faizalum,2011-05-10T18:01Z,Nothing to complain. The video quality is nothing to brag about either. Higher resolution would have helped.
,vij_29,2011-05-21T19:14Z,NOT WORTH downloading...better wait for the actual DVDrip!
