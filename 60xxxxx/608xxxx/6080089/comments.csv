EVEN? You are bullshit if you think that it's enough to know only one language.

,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-04-16T16:45Z,"[poroner]
You can speak neither English, nor any other language. Even I can't understand you, but I freely speak three languages. Think it over.
By the way - English is NOT official language of the world. Russian is also an official language of United Nations. Got it?

And finally - you are the greatest asshole! no-Steam.ru -> .ru -> RUSSIAN. Don't even try to explain me anything which you do not know."
,The_Pingas,2011-05-22T06:07Z,"This is a great upload, thanks a lot! It may be in Russian, but if you search for 'rus' in the the episode 2 folder and delete everything, it'll turn the menu into english. Also, open the rev.ini file and change Russian into English and the subtitles will be available. The voices are still in Russian, but if you're too lazy to read some text go buy the game."

Find rev.ini in your game folder and change ""Russian"" to ""English"" inside. It should work, but I am not sure..."
