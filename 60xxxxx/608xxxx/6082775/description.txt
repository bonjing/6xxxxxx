'I am, you know, an out and out Englishman!'

So declared Mozart in a letter to an English friend. Mozart visited London when he was 8 on a concert tour, staying for nearly a year, and picked up a liking for English manners and dress which he retained for the rest of his life.

Historian Sarah Lenton traces Mozart's development as an Englishman, placing it in the context of his English tour, his English friends and pupils, his father's passion for England and the impact of Anglomania on 1790s Viennese culture as a whole.
