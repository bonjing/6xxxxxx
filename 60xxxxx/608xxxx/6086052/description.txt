- Phil Ochs: The Life and Legacy of a Legendary American Folk Singer

The legendary American folk singer Phil Ochs is widely regarded as one of the world's most influential political musicians. Rising to fame in the 1960s, Ochs used his music to both chronicle and help mobilize the labor rights, civil rights, and antiwar movements. A new documentary, Phil Ochs: There But for Fortune, has just been released chronicling Ochs' life. We speak with Phil Ochs' brother, Michael, and the director of the film, Kenneth Bowser, which premiered yesterday in New York City.
