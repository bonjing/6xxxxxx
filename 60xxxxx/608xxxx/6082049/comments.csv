Didn't think about this before download and got the 64 bit version and system informed me real quick it needed the 32 bit. Came back, downloaded it and installed slick as a whistle, no problems!  Thanks thingy!"
,greyspot,2011-06-22T02:16Z,"So, I have a legal key for Office Pro 2010, but BCM is only available for volume licensing (I don't need 5 copies, Micro$oft!) and I NEED BCM, but there is wonky issues with needing past keys etc. My question is, can I safely install this without invalidating my retail key? Anyone tried?"
