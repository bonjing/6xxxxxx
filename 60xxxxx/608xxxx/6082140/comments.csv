,slider155,2011-01-15T02:07Z,"just a question as i am fairly new to downloading games. how do i make the .rar files work, ive made .iso files work thats easy. Do i just burn all the files to a dvd or what?? 

Any advise would be appreciated"
,clo239,2011-01-20T04:54Z,No first you have to unrar the files using winrar. just google it and you will get the download. After you unrar them it will be a iso. you burn the iso and play the game.
