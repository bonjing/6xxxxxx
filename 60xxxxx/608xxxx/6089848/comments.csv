,MrAnderson1211,2011-05-03T22:10Z,"Hey Bricktop. Would it be possible to get an invite to Demoniod. I have been a huge fan of your work and have over 100 titles that you have produced over the last year. Keep up all the great work. I know its tough, but you make it look soo easy.

[T],murdoc47,2011-05-06T15:30Z,"i'm not bricktop. this is my torrent.
bricktop was such a dick for not uploading the third godfather."
,mark1990,2011-06-07T20:48Z,"thanks Bricktop..gr8 movie

[T],murdoc47,2011-06-09T22:43Z,"stop thanking bricktop. :D
he has nothing to do with this.
anyway, download my other (greater) torrents of the godfather trilogy:

,MJSisco93,2011-08-04T20:14Z,"@ murdoc, I love how you insult bricktop for not uploading this film.  So you upload it, and try to brag about your other Godfather torrents.  I always download both the PS3 compatible version of a 1080p movie, and then another .mkv version thats over 10gb and i play them side by side and the only quality difference I notice is that typically the 10+gb version is brighter.  Thats it.

So don't brag about your so called ""greater"" torrents, because I watched your Godfather Part 1 mkv file and the only difference is that you're versions are brighter, but the film quality is the same.

It also confuses me why you ask if your trilogy works on consoles, because if you knew anything,  you'd know that .mkv videos don't work any any console, unless you have a PS3 with old enough firmware to install linux, which then would allow you to install VLC Media Player.

All in all, I appreciate your work and time uploading these films, but there's no need to call bricktop a dick or brag about your other torrents."
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-04T20:58Z,"@ MJSisco, thanks for your feedback. also i downloaded your torrents, but they are very dark, practically blank ;)"
,MJSisco93,2011-08-05T00:43Z,"See murdoc, this is what I'm talking about.  Now you're insulting me for what you call ""trolling"" which isn't what I'm doing.  Truth is, if I did upload movies on here, I wouldn't brag about it, nor would I insult anyone elses work.  Like I said dude, thank you for your time and work, but there's no need to insult someone elses work."
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-05T08:25Z,"seriously? stop it. download what you want and say thank you and that's it. i'm not bragging. i started converting movies because of bricktop not uploading the third one, and that is being a troll. leaving people without the third film for 2 years. my insults will probably never reach the ears of bricktop, but they did your's. do me a favor and start your preaching elsewhere. i'm not uploading for YOU, but everyone."
,MJSisco93,2011-08-05T13:04Z,"Like I said dude for the third time now.  Thank you for your time and work.  Why would I start preaching elsewhere when I'm thanking you for that?  Thank you for converting this film to a 4 GB download and making it compatible to stream on game consoles.  You just seem a bit over the top on some things that's all.

One last thing, if you weren't bragging.  You wouldn't have mentioned what you think are your ""greater"" torrents.

I don't mean to troll, sorry if I am, I would just like you to realize something."
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-05T19:39Z,"they're greater, because:
better video bitrate
better sound
mkv format
so come on dude, i don't need the thank you or the why. i already know it's appreciated by the seed number. 
btw, i wouldn't have made this torrent, this m2ts file, if it weren't for bricktop and all the complaints, and people having consoles instead of a pc. i don't even have this version anymore, the seeders keep it alive. THAT is why i am offering the mkv, thus better rips. i don't mean to argue, so.. you know what to do :)"
,MJSisco93,2011-08-06T05:22Z,"Fair enough, but to be honest,  I would rather watch films on my console than my pc, since I can watch it on a bigger screen.  I just got tired of moving my big ass computer over to my HDTV and plugging it in via DVI.  I guess it's kinda weird though bceause I've compared a Batman Begins 1080p that's over 8 gigs with bricktop's 4 gb ps3 edition and I literally see no difference."
[T],murdoc47,2011-08-06T08:12Z,"in the words of american beauty: look closer.
anyways, mkv's at those sizes use DTS audio, at 1536 kbps, whereas the 4GB uses probably AC3 384 kbps. so if you're not using THX sound system, it's all the same. but i have hawk's eyes when it comes to seeing pixels in rips, so i am very picky :D"
,MJSisco93,2011-08-07T05:50Z,"I'll try to next time.  Is the difference really that noticeable?  I honestly can't see any differences.  I once even had a Dark Knight that was over 7 gigs and mkv, and I still can't see any differences between that one and Bricktop's 1080p PS3 Dark Knight.  I'm just probably stupid."
