""Click on ""Files"" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose ""Don't download"". 
(uTorrent would show ""Skipped"").
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step."""

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T22:00Z,"@houruoha: Contrary to all suggestions, everything is in place. No one need nothing from Mac if he runs PC.
All errors mentioned here, comes from WRONG marking of downloaders what to download and what not.
I have PC folder as is (config.lua is right next to main exe) and I have played quite normally.
I was stupid to drop Mac version in same torrent later on, counting on fewer downloads and people's ability to select/deselect in right mind. As many times before, I ass-u-me(ed) too much.

So - all who have problems (it's wrong selecting done by downloaders) should pay a price for that and DOWNLOAD ALL.

Again, PC version is standalone, Mac version is standalone. Absolutely and completely."
,Killjoy88,2011-01-07T22:39Z,"@twentyforty for your knowledge/opinion. 

It could be different on someone else's computer but my experience has been the same as SARmedic + abj642. 

I followed your instructions (on PC so deselected MAC) and i did not have a DATA file. I tried it twice and still to no avail. 

When i downloaded all of the upload, inc the MAC file, the Data file was now present (outside MAC file) and the game has been working fine since. 

Your thoughts if you would be so kind...

twentyforty started creating the torrent for the PC version, then, in the last minute, added the folder for MacOSX. 

So, for those who need help with basic logic...
Download _all files_ - except the MacOSX folder! 

However, I did notice that when I opened .Torrent file, not all files were listed. (Perhaps too many??)
I unselected MacOSX folder and it is downloading all the other files now.

For those who are interested, someone posted cheats for this game. Search TPB for ""Angry Birds Unlocker""


Hmm... got error :
The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see the application event log for more details.

Tried in Vista with XP Compatibility. Same results!

Went to site from the company and yes it said to install the latest drivers for your video card. So, sounds simple right?..  well..   i went to the nvidia wensite and the driver that ""they"" had was the ones i had on my pc.  so..  dead end there.

What i did was this.  Downloaded ""Driver Genius Professional Edition""..   And then ran it and it picked up an update for my video card.

I solved this by opening angrybirds.exe in the app 'Dependency walker'. This program said a couple of .dll's were missing.

I downloaded these and put them in the game directory. And low and behold, I spent the rest of the afternoon avoiding study by playing this terribly addictive game. Apparently it has something to do with winxp versions.

The dll's I needed were:

msjava.dll
msvcp90.dll
msvcr90.dll
msvcr100.dll
INETCOMM.DLL

#2 considering it has almost 2k seeds, which in most cases is a lot, again, u think there just might be a reason for that?
#3 just like Ikkar said, you need to enjoy simple games, instead of just shooter games or something like COD. or online games like WoW. the fact you cant enjoy such an amazingly simple and fun game, is just sad."

,VaiDuX461,2011-08-30T11:43Z,"Few answers:
1. If you get ""texture is too large:2048x2048, maximum supported size:1024x1024"": You need to buy new, better gpu/Video Card or or buy new pc.

2.""its for ipod or iphone not pc!!!!!!!!!!"" - It's for pc too, you idiot!, check wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds if you don't believe it, idiot's -.-

3.""Use Google Chrome or register at Google+, you can also play AB there..."" - Yes you can play, but these two versions only have 1 Episode and pc/mac have 6 now... oh golden eggs also, and web versions right now are very limited.

ALSO THIS TORRENT HAS OLD VERSION OF ANGRY BIRDS NEWEST HERE: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6599877/Angry.Birds.v1.6.2.cracked.READ.NFO-THETA v1.6.2
