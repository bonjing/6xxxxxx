[V],rambam1776,2011-01-04T18:22Z,"You know, I'm not sure. I got the info from the commercial website. The torrent originated on Usenet and had not notes, and I haven't listened to the whole thing yet. There are 65 files at an average of 15.1 minutes per, which is a little over 16 total hours. My guess therefore is unabridged. TPB isn't allowing editing right now, so I can't fix what I wrote. Sorry for the boo-boo."
