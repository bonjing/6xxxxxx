This is the same release as evilsperm, however, I converted the .vdi to .vdmk to allow this virtual image to run on Vmware workstation and Vmware fusion.

This is the latest PSL1HGT SDK release with ps3tools installed from hackerchannel.
You can build hex's for all of your dev boards as well as program apps for the PS3.
I have included the latest tools from fail0verflow at the time of this VM release 1.4.2011
You should check their git regularly and update them though =)
Also included are tools from kakaroto, oopo, aerialX (make sure to check all of their git repos as well)

Nearly all PS3 keys are saved in ~/.ps3
It is up to you to add the rest as they are released.

I was running into issues signing things last night in the VM, it was taking 8-10+ mins. to sign anything. This is the fix that was twitted (it has to do with the way virtualbox captures the mouse).

@KaKaRoToKS if using evilsperms vm so if anyone has it disable mouse integration at the bottom left and move mouse in vm window for entropy

KaKaRoToKS
@diogomontenegro move your mouse to create entropy (generates random data for the signature)

Just to clarify that in english for you guys lol this is what it means.
on the VM push the right CTRL + i 
The mouse will capture into the VM then when your signing your file shake the mouse around for a few seconds (or longer if you want) and then it will take anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 min. to sign a file.
