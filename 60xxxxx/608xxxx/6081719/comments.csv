I'm pretty sure I watched this on Space with the swearing intact, and it is definitely uncencored when streaming on the Space website.  Oh well, thanks for the upload, I'll just have to pretend their following the script.  They're saying ""stooge"" instead of ""douche"", ""hatch"" instead of ""ass"" and ""jock"" instead of ""cock"".  I mean, who the fuck fucked it up?"
