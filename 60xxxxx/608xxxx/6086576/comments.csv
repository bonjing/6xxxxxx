I have read this book and I can tell you you don't need to read this book to find women who will lay PEDOPHILES. All you have to do is find a woman that's into having sex with kids like yoursellf and you've got it made until the cops come a calling one day. LOL! Good luck pedo
,uidiotlol,2011-01-22T22:09Z,"This unprecedented look at female sexual predators explains why and how they prey on our children and youths and what adultsâ€”and children and youths themselvesâ€”should understand to prevent victimization.

From teachers, mothers, coaches, and others who abuse positions of trust, authorities in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada report up to 10 percent of sex crimes are perpetrated by females. What motivates these women to behave as they do? How do we safeguard children from their advances?

In Female Sexual Predators: Understanding and Identifying Them to Protect Our Children and Youths, social worker and therapist Karen A. Duncan helps adults be proactive so children will not fall prey to this violation. Vignettes pulled from news headlines and interviews with female sexual predators Duncan has encountered in her own practice are used to help readers understand these crimes and the women who commit them, as well as the impact these crimes can have on victims.

The women profiled were in positions of authority at churches, schools, sports institutions, and the home. Victims explain how these women exploited their positions of trust, planned their crimes, groomed their victims, deceived adults into not detecting their behavior, and how they did not stop even when they recognized the danger and the harm to themselves and their victims. Duncan addresses the issue of maternal sexual abuse answering questions about mothers who willingly sexual abuse their own children and at times commit child sexual abuse with other adults, as well as women who sexually abuse girls. Four types of female sex offenders are presented within the emerging research on this topic, along with questions regarding assessment, treatment, and management of female sex offenders in the community. It also addresses the controversial issues of female pedophilia and female sexual deviance within the context of what we know about human sexuality."
,trannyboy,2011-03-10T20:37Z," This book is totally PC (politically correct) and thus uninteresting. ""sexual predators"" and children are ""prey"". This is a manipulative use of language, used in order to implement legislations based on (North American pseudo-christian) moralism.

A much better book that deals with pedophilia, childrens sexuality and the abusive politics surrounding these matters is Judith LevineÂ´s 'Harmful to Minors - The Perils of Protecting Children From Sex'. Here you have it:
