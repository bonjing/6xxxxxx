Why just fly when you can soar with soul? This raucous comedy stars Kevin Hart as Nashawn Wade, who after a humiliating experience while travelling by aeroplane, sues the airline involved and is awarded a hefty settlement. Determined to make good with the money, he creates the full-service airline of his dreams, complete with funky music, a dance floor, sexy stewardesses and bathroom attendants - and the catchy motto: 'We Fly. We Party. We Land.'
