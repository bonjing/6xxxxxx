You Need Too Burn Disk 1 With Nero Burning ROM Onto A Blank DVD & Burn At The Slowest Speed :)

But it keeps asking me for my activation key, and that I have 6 days left.
 now my worries are that over 6 days I won't be able to use vista anymore and i have to reinstall, will this happen? or will it just keep running even after the activation deadline?
