The Complete Space Quest Collection
Included in this set is my collection of all Space Quest games, and while it\\\'s not an official release like the one Vivendi released in 2006, in this package you\\\'ll find:
* Space Quest Collection I - V: includes
Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter (EGA)
Space Quest II: Chapter II - Vohaul\\\'s Revenge (EGA)
Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon (VGA)
Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers (VGA talkie)
Space Quest V: The Next Mutation (VGA talkie)
* Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in the Spinal Frontier (full CD-ROM)
* Space Quest Extra Chapters: includes
Space Quest: The Lost Chapter (EGA)
Space Quest Zero (0) (EGA)
* All the manuals for each game, so you never get stuck and you can read up more on the story!
I recommend downloading DOSBox to play these games, it\\\'ll make it possible to play them in any version of Windows/Mac/Linux etc.

Have fun!
