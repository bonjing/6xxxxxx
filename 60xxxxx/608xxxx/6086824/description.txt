Pollini is quite simply my favourite pianist.  His rendition of the final Beethoven piano sonatas is my most treasured CD (and I own some 2,000 CDs).

Here we have an absolute treasure trove of music from the career of this superlative artist including music from Mozart, Beethoven, Schumann and others.


Enjoy and Seed!!
