,retx,2012-05-17T11:00Z,"I'm on kmeaw 3.55 and I was able to run this game but in a pretty weird way.
Downloaded the game, Installed Every 3.55 pkg out there (Black Screen). But somehow after I installed 3.41 Blus30161 (US) pkg and then copied then moved the games archieves folder inside hdd0/game/blus30161/USRDIR, The game now starts w/o any probs."
