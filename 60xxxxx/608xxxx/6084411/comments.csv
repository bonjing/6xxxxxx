,CrispLite,2011-01-28T21:57Z,"FYI to all leechers/seeders ... I Live (somewhere) in central  America and I just got a nasty call from my ISP about downloading this. 
Apparently the lawyers for this film are watching this torrent and sending ""cease and desist"".  Not exactly enforce-able where I am at but folks in US and Europe might wanna take note."
,gdennis12,2011-01-29T03:05Z,What is a good software to burn movies more than 2 hours long?
,dene9090,2011-02-11T03:14Z,rofl...crispbite you are a total fucking retard dude!!! how the fuckinghell on earth are your isp wacthing what u download?????.....grow up retard 
,ZombiePanda,2011-02-11T03:55Z,"@dene9090....there are tons of people who have had their internet turned off from downloading torrents, stop completely dismissing the idea because that is just plain ignorant."
,fallout11,2011-02-13T20:35Z,"There are videos on Youtube right now from folks  who have received warning letters via their ISP. Believe it, they're watching the seed clouds on this one and getting the IP addresses of those hosting this movie (and others, of course), then contacting their ISP to trace you and I.  Sucks, but true.  Remember to use encryption on your client.....not foolproof, but helps."
,Meatus,2011-02-14T00:28Z,"If you're worried about your ISP, why not just go to Starbucks, pay $1.95 for a coffee and DL it there?  That'll make it a little more difficult for them to catch you.  Though, you'll be exploiting the poor Columbian workers picking their coffee.  I guess it's a lose-lose situation.  Oh well..."
,eldiab13,2011-02-18T02:06Z,"I love how people resort to name calling on these things esp when they don't know what they are talking about. Yes, it is true, film companies regularly host torrents so the can bust people for downloading them . It is not the downloader that gets the heat it is the ISP . Your ISP will then threaten you. There are options to avoid this kind of thing like IP filtering and VPN servers - thats why people use them - google it."
,JunkX666,2011-02-20T06:42Z,"Toch weer knap die 4.09 gig.

Als je de film achterstevoren speelt hoor je de complete bijbel geproken door de duivel?

,jaissssss,2011-02-25T08:10Z,do the movie company's upload or just track the downloads
,vdMerwe,2011-02-27T22:53Z,"This says ""Property of Paramount Pictures / for awards consideration only"" and it's pretty low quality. Not worth a 4 gig download IMO. (Soundtrack is English.)"
,Plasmadude,2011-02-28T14:49Z,"Thanks Merve 4 heads up.
How do you get a crappy picture from a 4 gig file?
why bother?"

,rippervanwinkle,2011-03-21T10:30Z,Very very shitty quality. Is an amateurish conversion from a bad quality divx.  Complete waste of time.

,DragonChaserKev,2011-06-15T02:31Z,So the quality on this sounds like its mediocre and the size is huge.  I'll skip but thanks.
