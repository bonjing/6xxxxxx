,djdead23,2011-09-22T07:17Z,"nice collection but many if not all of the tracks seem to have a small fade in and fade out at the beginning and end of every track. This pretty much ruins gapless playback, especially on the albums where it matters, like sophisticated boom boom, mad bad and dangerous to know, and rip it up... :("
