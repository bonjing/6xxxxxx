INSTUCTIONS TO FOLLOW DURING INSTALLATION/CRACKING (From Comments):

************************************************************************************

READ THIS IF PATCH/AUTHENTICATION CODE WON'T WORK!

I just got the Keygen to work

Here's what you do:
-Make sure you uninstall it and reinstall it so you can enter a new serial key

-(IMPORTANT) Right click on your keygen file, go to properties and run as administrator.

-When you run the keygen make sure you choose Sony Vegas 10.0a in the drop downbox FIRST and then patch the Sony Vegas 10.0 folder under Program Files -> Sony.
If you're on a 64-bit computer it will ask for the Shared Plug-Ins folder, you can find it from Program Files (x86) -> Sony

-After that run Vegas and use the codes accordingly (choose register from another computer, too).

It should work now. If you have problems with the Authentication Code and not the Serial Key it probably has to do with the patch.

-Curdnugget


For WIN 7 64bit USERS

Do everything as mentioned above (dont run SV untill you have patched, make sure its the right patch etc)

PATCHING

When it asks you to select the Sony Vegas directory - Select C:\Program Files \ Sony \Sony Vegas Pro 10
When it asks for the Shared Plugins folder - Select C:\Program Files x86\Sony\Shared Plugins

As ""YeOldeSnake""

It must be a False Positive!!
I always scan programs before uploading .....

What antivirus are u using??

i used avast and malwarebytes to scan this particular soft - no threat was found!!

If anyone else is getting the same threat... let me know i will remove this torrent myself  :)"
,Itbankrock,2011-01-08T12:41Z,"Could someone post the keygen here, Keygen.exe is a virus."
[T],locobot12,2011-01-08T15:52Z,"@Itbankrock

Its false positive for gods sake!!!
i'm using it perfectly well in two of my comps!!

,Itbankrock,2011-01-08T17:56Z,"@locobot12
Thanks for informing, I disabled my antivirus(AVG 2011) and internet(to stop viruses from entering my PC) and it worked 100%(the patch and keygen), after that, enabled them again."
,helpmehh,2011-01-08T19:44Z,"i right click the keygen as adminastrator and it still wont work, im only person who uses computer so noone else can be admin, what do i do?"
,Agnostos,2011-01-09T04:16Z,"this is for who ever thinks theres a virus in the download THERE ISNT MANY ALMOST ALL ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAMS SEE A KEYGEN AS A VIRUS OR SPYWARE SO STOP LABELING THEM AS BAD OR INFECTED thanks for reading 

~Agnostos"
[T],locobot12,2011-01-09T06:03Z,"@helpmehh 

Did u scan immediately after download?

if u did ur antivirus soft must have corrupted the keygen!!

judging from the comments a lot of people are receiving false positive !

This means u have to redownload the entire soft!
but dont worry i upped the keygen alone for u -

PLZ disable ur antivirus first ....
download the keygen, run as administrator 
patch and use the software!!

That should do it!!"

,EctheEmpire,2011-01-30T07:51Z,I't Seems To Work Fine. I'm Downloading Now
,scifygreg,2011-02-02T00:44Z,"dumbasses, do you know why the keygen shows up as a trojan? BECAUSE IT IS ONE, but it wont hurt your compy, a trojan is a backdoor program that uses a loophole to access a system and thats exactly what a keygen does, so stop fuckin complaining and stop posting false-positives!"
,jeveux,2011-02-05T02:53Z,"guys i need help, i got this message. 'an error has occured while patching the files' please help."
,Rsgameplay,2011-02-28T06:00Z,"Hi
thanks, it works well after i read was tfmoffat said. i was just wondering how easy is to get caught? i know they can give some pretty hefty fines and i dont want that
thanks again for the download"
,lanno0927,2011-03-10T16:21Z,tnx!!!! i can guarantee that it really works!! just turn off your antivirus. in my case mcafee automatically quarantines the keygen saying that it is trojan infected. so as instructed here turn of your antivirus and you will able to run the keygen and everything will flow smoothly. 
,exevez,2011-03-11T08:26Z,keygen is outdated. ive been using TPB for months now without an account and i made an account just because ive spent the last two days DLing multiple of these files just to find that all of their keygens are outdated. the one u posted in the comments on filedude.com has correct serial codes atleast but the authentification codes dont work. please help! 
,exevez,2011-03-11T08:36Z,maybe their not but i did everything the instructions did. not much room to fuck up with them. so im pretty sure i didnt. i watched the video and did the installion along with ti too. im using windows 7 64 bit. could someone make life easier and PM me with a serial code and a authentification code. cuz all the( wait im actually gonna count) 5 diffrent keygens i have are not producing any correct information. ive done both patches aswell so im pretty sure its not just something i left out. but we all make mistakes.... PLEASE!
,NickBrahz,2011-03-15T12:55Z,"For some reason it does not work for me, i am using windows vista x32bit, it installed but when i try to run it, it just shows an error in the task manager and nothing pops up, exevez i will send you some now"
,UrbanRunner,2011-03-18T05:41Z,"When I go to patch the Sony folder it gives me the error, ""An error has occured while patching the file(s)"" any ideas??? ?=\"
,UrbanRunner,2011-03-18T05:50Z,"Nvm figured out the issue, works like a charm =] Thanks locobot! and big thanks to the guys behind Digital Insanity for that keygen, and the apps background track's pretty epic lol"
,kaiyodei,2011-09-11T19:35Z,I paniced before reading everything. I will need to turn off the anti virus because I told it to block the keygen.
,wertblind,2011-10-05T00:40Z,People ...anyone made or have the Keygen for vegasn pro 11 ... the 10 isnt intresting anymore ^^
,kaiyodei,2011-11-06T15:18Z,"I think this is the one I tried to install. because of the comments involving the false positive reading with keygen. I didn't know and I blocked it.
I uninstalled this a few days ago and my computer is semi messed up. I get a shwinconxp9106 configuration error on bootup, I look for this file to fix it and it won't show up. half my programs got uninstalled, firefox has a application .ini error.

I ran an avira scan and it found something attached to this after I uninstalled."
