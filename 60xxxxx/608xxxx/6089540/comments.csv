,lloydmartin23,2011-10-02T13:19Z,"hello guys! this is my first time to download a game in my ps3. its 3.55v and i already jailbreak it. is the game compatible to 3.55? im already seeding this game now, i just want to know how will i run this game after i downloaded it? because this is different to the one that i copied on other ps3 cd's. is this automatic that ill moved the game on my external drive and ready to play? i need some advice guys! thnx & godbless :)"
,Demon_Gate,2011-10-12T12:59Z,Okay GUYS I need your help HOW the hell do I put these games on the PS3? I JUST changed the internal 80gb that has all my recent stuff with a 320GB HD That is blank and has nothing.. So I can add any games on there and can switch whenever i desire. IS this a smart thing to do? and can someone give me the links to all the things I require to do this PS3 Fusion? Or merging.. Or etc.?
