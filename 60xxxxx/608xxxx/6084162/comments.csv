,BDB11,2011-02-05T22:03Z,The whole reason I got this was for DotA. But there seems to be a glitch with the Bots spawning. anyone else have this problem. The actual game itself works fine. just the mods are giving me problems
,Whit3_Addict,2011-02-08T14:10Z,thanks works great!!!
,CM1337,2011-02-10T06:26Z,"No complaining please, you can't mess up on downloading this. The up-loader did a magnificent job. I'm currently playing it daily. My final cut:

Pros:
~Simple setup; just download and install
~Amazing quality; no lagging or off sequenced audio.
~No viruses; a clean upload of both games.

Cons:
~ Cinematic scenes are not messed up, the audio is there but the screen is black but you can still understand the story because of the other scenes. 

For people complaining about multiplayer or Kaspersky virus detection:

You cannot run a cracked game on the developers servers unless you have a key. It's that simple, so don't try it. However you can use a ""private"" server. Eurobattle.net, sign up then install the server and start it up. You can find video tutorials on YouTube if you're really too stupid to figure it out (in which case you shouldn't be trying to pirate things).
Next; Kaspersky is shit, it isn't a good software, even if everyone uses it. Download Avira and perform scans before and after you download something if you don't know how to find viruses yourself manually.

Thanks carosht for the perfect upload, you sir are amazing. "

2. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Blizzard Entertainment\
3. Create new key, name it 'Warcraft III' (without quotes)
4. On right side of new key entry, right click and create new string value
5. Name it 'InstallPath' (without quotes)
6. Change the value of InstallPath to wherever you installed it (example: 'c:\warcraft 3\')
7. Reinstall Warcraft 1.24d Patch. (this time your war3 will be installed without any errors)
8. Enjoy! your Warcraft is patched to 1.25b"

,Sloph,2012-03-23T23:43Z,"If you want to be able to patch, when installing the game, when it asks for the file path, change the file name so it only has ""Warcraft III"". 
Get the fix here http://www.engamers.com/download-warcraft-iii-fixer-w3fixer/ and apply it for both.
Then you'll be able to use this patch: http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/war3x/patches/pc/War3TFT_126a_English.exe   without any errors"

,Xandror,2012-04-24T22:46Z,"How to play via LAN. Turn off windows firewall. From main menu: click ""local area network"", click ""create game"" select a map that allows as many players as you want in the game including computer opponents, click create game, select open for each human player you want. Wait for other people on the lan to join the game. When everyone is ready, click ""start game""."
,enjoyseriously,2012-04-27T21:50Z,"This is the way that it worked to me with the latest 1.26a patch:
1 - When you are installing the game, rename the installation folder path just like ""warcraft III""
   - E.g. C:Warcraft III
2 - Download and apply this fix, both  http://www.engamers.com/download-warcraft-iii-fixer-w3fixer/
2 - Open regedit (press windows key + R and type regedit)
   - Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USERSOFTWAREBlizzard EntertainmentWarcraft III
   -  On right side, right click on the string value named ""InstallPath"" (if does not exist, create it) >Modify>  set the value data just like you did on the 1st step.
   -  Download and install the latest patch without any problems http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/warcraft-iii-patch-downloads
get and copy the latest DotA map inside the map folder http://www.getdota.com/

Sorry for my engrish"

,iamhelix,2012-06-27T06:00Z,"why has everyone on TPB have big hang ups on grammer and spelling, who give a flying fuck about it? You dickheads see a spelling mistake and then start posting just to flame on the people with the mistakes.

Get a life and, being a good speller won't get you a hot girl, or a social life, or a job, or money. So why the fuck are you so hung up on it for - you r-tards?"
