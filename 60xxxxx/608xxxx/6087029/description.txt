Christina Applegate_Streets 1990 This review is from: Streets [VHS] (VHS Tape) 
Christina is no Kelly Bundy in this flick. She has wits and street smarts just to survive from day to day. She is young, beautiful and alone on the streets so she sells her body to make the money but she has intellegence to boot. She befriends a young man, new to the city and naive to what the world is like outside of his secure world with parents and money. He witnesses the way of life homeless people live who have been scruntinized by it's own society. Drugs, prostitution, starvation, all under his feet in the sewer drains, hidden from the world on top. Christina shows compassion through her hardened shield that she had to build to protect herself from the "real people" especially the law. This movie shows how well a character actor can change from a ditzy blonde in a sitcom to a serious actress. I applaude Christina with a standing ovation.
