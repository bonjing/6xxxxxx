BEST VIRUS PREVENTION TECHNOLOGY ON THE MARKET. GUARANTEED.
If conventional Antivirus software did a good job of protecting computers, millions of PCs wouldn't get infected with viruses, Trojans and other malware each year. 
Independent security experts state that over 50,000 viruses release daily. 
The truth is, the sophistication of many viruses, Trojans and worms has proven conventional Antivirus software ineffective.
This is because most Antivirus software battles threats they know, but not new ones they've never encountered. 
And this strategy leaves open a window of vulnerability from unknown threats that can last for hours or even days.
Comodo has a better strategy to close the window of vulnerability of PCs from unknown threats. 
It's based on the concept of prevention, not detection. 
Comodo Internet Security Pro 2011 features Defense+ technology that includes two advanced technologies Default Deny Protectionâ„¢ and patent-pending Auto Sandbox Technologyâ„¢. 
Default Deny Protectionâ„¢ reviews every file trying to run on your PC sorting all safe, unsafe and questionable files. 
Questionable files are then isolated by our Auto Sandbox Technologyâ„¢ to automatically segregate such files so they can't harm your PC.

COMODO INTERNET SECURITY + GEEKBUDDY: A WINNING COMBINATION
Did you ever think a security suite could configure a new printer? 
Or perform regular, expert tune-ups to keep a PC working fast? 
Comodo Internet Security Pro 2011 can, because it's more than a security suite. 
It includes 24/7 access to a GeekBuddy, Comodo's livePCsupport service.
