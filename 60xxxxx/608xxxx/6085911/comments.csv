[V],nightissuchproximity,2011-04-04T18:40Z,"@vanillasky79


You know that Alexander Pope comment?...if ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise...

I hate to break it to you, but this is cracked.


You have chosen to update this using the first method that was offered to you...


sometimes the most logical is not the most obvious method...

it's a bit like a route planner...you have to figure the alternative highways and by-roads...

And i uploaded this 'cause i know it works...
...i did not upload it in order to satiate my desire to feed caviaar to pigs...

...now who's the FUCKIN' ASSHOLE?"
,Damien_74,2011-04-22T13:44Z,Jeese.. where on the comodo-site did you look? On a page for logos or something? The adress is in NFO u nerds: http://antivirus.comodo.com/internet-security-pro.php

[V],DeGun,2011-05-17T00:38Z,"Hi there 

First title says Premium & desc. says Pro 2011 , saying about that as you'll understand why after i explain this :
Runned the exe as admin , instaled it , - had the message at the end of instal : ""your free life license has been activated to comodo center etc..."" then rebooted it , went to check the ""about"" in comodo main page , saw nothing asking about a key as it used to do before with my ""trial"" version - then update started on its own , then came back to "" about"" and saw this time on the bottom left : upgrade to Pro 2011 Now ! and by the side : enter a key ... so basicly i'm back at the same state that i was before to do all this .

Must say i'm disapointed but not really after uploader as i am aware that this AV  is quite - yet - impossible to crack properly ... 

May be "" nightissuchproximity "" you could check your ""about"" ina main page of comodo  and tell  what you see ? ... 

thx for sharing though

,Kamo707,2011-06-08T11:09Z,What's the difference of this one and the one from official website? That (FREE) one is also can be updated: I have asked from the service.
,andreiff,2011-06-09T13:47Z,i love comodo !!!!(i have buy it)
,asdhokker,2011-11-15T23:17Z,"this is probably some spyware.
it connects to:
213.251.170.205 ; ks34393.kimsufi.com @port 9001"
,Dandy007,2011-12-17T21:50Z,thnx in advnce m8
,asdhokker,2012-02-09T19:31Z,"THIS IS DEFINITELY A VIRUS !!!
it will overwrite most of your system files and starts connecting to some Taiwani and Indian ip addresses on port 445 and 443...
couple of examples:
59.99.137.76
218.173.162.222
91.213.203.203
94.24.40.205

one of those hosts a counterstrike server?
if you know how to hack, plz erase their systems ^.^

NB!!! download Comodo internet security from filehippo for free!!! the real full thing!"
,asdhokker,2012-02-09T21:31Z,"some kind of ""virus.win32.virut.av@25564316"".
it also created an autorun.inf file on my USB stick:

[autorun]
open=RECYCLER\S-1-6-21-2434476501-1644491937-600003330-1213\autorunme.exe
icon=%SystemRoot%\system32\SHELL32.dll,4
action=Open folder to view files
shell\open=Open
shell\open\command=RECYCLER\S-1-6-21-2434476501-1644491937-600003330-1213\autorunme.exe
xshell\open\default=1

also in the same folder:
autorunme.exe.cavtemp
TFR97.tmp
TFR96.tmp

its a good thing that i have annoying autoplay turned off...

autorun.inf was called ""Malware@fff0sbqyujxj"" and ""Malware@#fff0sbqyujxj""


btw... its seems that this activated after some period of time because i installed it on an old pc that i dont use much and it started to act up only today. or it might have been a software for a botnet or something and it was needed only now."
