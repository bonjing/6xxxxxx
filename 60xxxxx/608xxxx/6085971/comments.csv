[V],twentyforty,2011-01-06T21:01Z,"@coolasad: Thanks.
""Middle"" was encoded when started, and upped regularly. But, as many short comedy shows wasn't accepted and was dropped out.
Practically - all short comedy shows are - as people say - ""on me"", maybe because people do not ""see"" savings in size, maybe because majority just stuff their pockets up and run away...

You DO realize that TV packs have 1400-2600 downloads - but only three or four seeders day after - and - for worse - only dozen people say Thanks.

Count for yourself, look around, and you'll see maybe two dozen of screen-names. Same people, day by day, and thousands of ""mute"" ones... (You used plural as ""we"" - if you wondering why such long answer).

And people should understand why am I such ""pain in the ass"" who refuse to include a show, but drop one very easily..."
,hunt_0710,2011-01-06T21:38Z,"@20-40: thanks for all ur uploads... I m not a big fan of TV shows but i like House very much.. any chance ur doing House season 7....???. 
Thanx .. :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-06T22:03Z,@myself: Same shit over and over again. Fuck it and hit the bed before you say or do something over the board.
,jjacobs,2011-01-06T22:04Z,Thanx for the uploads.
,odyssey09,2011-01-06T22:10Z,Thanks for Friday Night Lights! You're the MVP of torrents.
,odyssey09,2011-01-06T22:12Z,Thanks for Friday Night Lights.
,azrielle,2011-01-06T23:04Z,"'Twould be nice if I knew how to access such stats.  I have attempted an initial seed for about a year of an xvid avi convrsion I made of Hopscotch--but bittorrent still says it is ""initial seeding"".  Anyway, as of this moment, I have 123 torrents, of which about half are unavailable due to temporary changes in Win7 external hard drive designations from adding an external DVD drive to my netbook.  Of those 60 or so torrents still available for download at any moment, 19 are 20-40 downloads.  Also at the moment, there are 9 active uploads, of which 6 are yours.  Not presently downloading anything."
,Killjoy88,2011-01-06T23:28Z,"Thank you for Friday Night Lights and Cougar Town. 

Twentyforty - the quality/size of your uploads never ceases to amaze me. "

Thanks for Human Target, Cougar Town and of course Craigie."
,jon4fun,2011-01-07T00:35Z,"@ 20-40, thanks also for [Modern Family]. I don't DL it myself as it on TV here shortly after the USA and I haev to watch my bandwidth but I'm sure there are lots of people who really appreciate you UP'ing this show.

Jon"
,cindal,2011-01-07T03:10Z,Thank you! Hope you had a good holiday season!
,dardar6t9,2011-01-07T05:21Z,any idea if they are doing another season of sons? the last one had me laughing my ass off off when the ATF bitch got taken down
,htctouch,2011-01-07T07:28Z,thnx allot for cougar town
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T09:53Z,"Thanks for thanking and guidance, becauseI watch Modern Family only (of these shows in the pack today) and I think it's one of the best comedy shows.

@dardar6t9:
""he third season of the series attracts an average of 4.9 million viewers per week, making it FX's highest rated series ever, surpassing FX's other hits The Shield, Nip/Tuck, and Rescue Me. On October 7, 2010, Sons of Anarchy was renewed for a fourth season set to air in 2011.""

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T10:03Z,"@azrielle: You should have maximally 8 torrents loaded, and when you start downloading one - press Stop for all others (resume with  seeding only when download have finished).
Download max. two in the same time and do not seed other torrents during the download of some - they need (in download) all bandwidth you have. "
,hkoraddi,2011-01-07T11:23Z,Hope u will be doing Megamind 2010 SCR
,rojenatgmail,2011-01-07T11:51Z,Thanks for Human Target
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T12:13Z,"@hkoraddi: Sorry I would skip SCR, too many versions is out there and some are 350 MB big."
,coolasad,2011-01-07T21:22Z,"@twentyforty

The work you r Doing is exemplary. I always recommend your torrents to my friends and I am sure that all of them including 

me try to give back to the torrent community wahtever we can. Everyone in this community is to be appreciated and taught to 

share. and i am sure a lot of people shares my thought and they appreciate the work you are doing even if 

they dont show it. Keep up the good work. and thanks again for your encoded files.
And i really enjoyed the great print of the movie ""Legend of the guardian"" which you uploaded some time ago.

PS. One Querry can you tell me if I have downloaded some of the files in a torrent and skiped the others. do I show up as a 

seeder or a peer."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-08T09:50Z,"@coolasad : It totaly depends on torrent-program you use. In case of so called ""partial downloads"" your client (program) should report ONLY what you choose to download. That means that you'll appear as seeder for chosen (by you) files only.
I've said ""should report"" because none of the public trackers doesn't work reliably last couple of years.
DHT also reports successfully downloaded ""chunks"" of data and one's client derives that from DHT (if it works) and reports mentioned data too. "
