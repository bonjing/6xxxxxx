in the early 90's an exotic strain of downtempo called ambient dub. Although the product of the same new-generation music technology that figured in the rise of house, trance and techno music, ambient dub's relation to clubland is only marginal. Much of the output is instead anchored in slow, seductive bassy grooves influenced by the studio techniques of 70s' Jamaican reggae producers like King Tubby and Lee Perry. Relaxed and spacious with deep basslines and gently hypnotic loops, dub reinvents the idea of trance music by stretching out the basic components of a track using echo, reverb and delay effects.
