If you don't want to take the time to rip the individual episodes then at least rip it as an iso image so it can be mounted and played like a DVD, and then if someone wanted to they could easily rip the individual episodes.  As it is if you want to watch a specific episode you have to load the file containing ALL of them and skip through until you find what you're looking for like it were a goddamn VHS tape."
