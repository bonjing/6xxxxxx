Please excuse my initial upload speed.

I've chosen to omit Sheryl Crow's album despite Kevin Gilbert's very absolute involvement as I believe it to be readily available as is. I have also omitted compilation albums which his music was featured in because I do not see them as necessary.

I spent many days trawling the internet to find all of these albums, I'd like to thankand http://www.bunalti.com/ for providing most of them.

I couldn't find The View From Here and The Power Of Suggestion by Giraffe. Though as the self-titled album is essentially a "Best Of" there is probably no need.

If you have enjoyed any of these albums it would be nice of you to support his estate by purchasing any of the available recordings or merchandise.

And if you do not know who Kevin Gilbert is, learn.
