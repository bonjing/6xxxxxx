I have vista btw"
,azae,2011-01-06T17:44Z,"sorry spoke too soon, just right click the icon on the start menu and select open file location. should be under the programdata one

thank you very much, great upload"
,tversitykraked,2011-01-06T18:15Z,"hmm it puts an icon in the start menu? not bad lol i didnt know that. All i had to do was 

1. Extract the Rar

2. right click on tversity and choose RUN AS ADMIN

3.click allow on firewall popup and it loaded.

But im glad its working for you so far :D please if there are any bugs or problems can you post them here? 
Thanks!  

that way i can make whatever improvements necessary :) "

ALOT of the testimonials on the tversity site said they had ALOT of problems with the software that came with that type router. There were 505 topics with problems on their forums lol.

 basically

1.uninstall the (media,server) software that came with the router

2.check here: http://forums.tversity.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=28130&sid=68e48477c59662867ad620be967aaf01

3. If that doesnt work then go into your router and forward the port 41952

try that and see how it works :)"
