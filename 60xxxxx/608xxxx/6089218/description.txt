Following the darkly eclectic masterpiece 'Hallowed Ground' was always going to be tough but two years later the Femmes re-emerged with their most uplifting and joyful album full of scathing wit, infectious unbeat danceable songs, and more than a nod to the rock 'n' roll spirit of the Rolling Stones. 'The Blind Leading The Naked' was produced by Talking Heads Jerry Harrison and does contain a more polished alt-pop sheen reminiscent of the Heads but as always with Gordon Gano's beautifully skewed vision to the fore. This is the Femmes at their most upbeat and life-affirming with the sound evolving from the stripped down trio into full on rock and pop replete with sax's and rollicking guitars with Brian Ritchie excelling in his multi-instrumentalist role (and gaining his first lead vocal). From the opening 29 second savagery of 'Old Mother Reagan' to 'I Held Her In My Arms' - one of THE greatest songs of the 80's - the gorgeous sentiment of 'Good Friend', the barrel-house gospel call-and-response of 'Faith' , and a truly genius cover of T-Rex's 'Children of The Revolution', this is the Femmes kicking up a joyous racket but still with a dark heart beating on the likes of 'No Killing' and 'Cold Canyon'.

Now long out of print this is the album that confirmed the Femmes as alt-rock's leading exponents of left-field pop brilliance following their incredible debut and the dark beauty of 'Hallowed Ground', they were no "two-album-and-out-flash-in-the-pan", these guys were here to stay and their influence on the likes of the Pixies and Throwing Muses meant alternative rock would flourish into the 90's and beyond.
