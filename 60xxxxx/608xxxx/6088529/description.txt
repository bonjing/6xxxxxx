This book reveals what people have wanted to know about the human condition from the very beginning of time: What are feelings for? Within its pages, you will discover the secret language of feelings. That language is a voice within us. Sometimes it is as soft as a whisper; sometimes it is as loud as a roar. It is an important voice, which, when fully understood, gives you a kind of guidance that no other voice can. 

The information in The Secret Language of Feelings was revealed during thousands of hours of working with hypnotherapy clients at the Banyan Hypnosis Center for Training & Services. It came from clients who spoke to us both in the normal waking state and in the state of hypnosis................
