It might be of use to people to know that there is a site which clearly shows you what ip address snoops can see when you use utorrent:

http://www.checkmytorrentip.com/

If you are not using a proxy service like btguard or torrentprivacy then the ip address which appears will be your usual web browsing ip address.

Something to consider if you are keen to remain anonymous.

Take care
