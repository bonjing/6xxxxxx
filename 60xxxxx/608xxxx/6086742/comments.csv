,arush1989,2011-01-11T05:08Z,"@ locobot12, can we update its ""program""?, it says that new version is available ie 5.1.884.  Updating ""engine and virus definitions"" are fine and working. But i am worried about ""updating program"" because it should not get corrupt while updating."
[T],locobot12,2011-01-11T07:45Z,"@arush1989
NO No No No Do not update program !! it will fuck the license !!

only update virus defenitions/engine!!

[T],locobot12,2011-01-11T20:40Z,"@arush1989

same features ! only this is beta and that is advanced release!"
,upit,2011-01-12T04:27Z,all these people uploading avast and licences is shite these licences have been around for ages avast has blacklisted them all. Avast no longer download trial version they are wise anybody loading a licence up to 2012 will no it does not work i cannot understand all these seeds and no comments it dont work does it 
,upit,2011-01-12T04:42Z,shite shite shite licences been around ages will fuck up jordan licence i have had this licence ages got it of pirate bay 6 months ago its fucked....popup  avast will come if you update.. your licence is illigal avast will not be sending no more updates. I enjoyed this licence for the last 6 months but now its fucked who wants a licence where you you cannot update the whole program.. fuck off its bollocks..get with my Eset number..
,upit,2011-01-12T04:46Z,"It is very hard to get a working key for avast these days most keys have been rumbled by avast i have the 2012 key for about 6months which i got of pirate bay but it started sending pop ups saying you may not be aware but your licence is illigal. that why i had to install eset nod32 antivirus 4 30 day trial and i found that at the end of the trial if i uninstalled it with ""your uninstaller"" restarted my computer reinstalled eset igot another 30 days trial..someone else try this it works for me goona do it again next month.. "
,upit,2011-01-12T05:25Z,another thing i uninstalled with your uninstaller in super mode at the the end eset ask restart your computer click no let your uninsaller take everthing of first then restart i also removed blank folder from programs and reinstalled eset buzzing it worked another 30 days 
[T],locobot12,2011-01-12T06:56Z,"@upit 

nice campaigning for eset antivirus!!

do u also get paid from the company for doing this on tpb?? "
,skip741,2011-01-12T09:23Z,"hi locobot i have tried this avast and have not been able to get it to work at all.it will install ok but when i apply the liscenses,it will show as activated till 2012  UNTIL i use the scanner, or reboot, then it goes back to saying its unregistered  unactivated..the liscense info dissappears from the status screen.. it appears that it ont activate permanately... i dont know how others have got it functioning.. please explain ur activation process u use to get it operational.basically i installed the program, then put in the ashbase.dll file, then rebooted and applied the liscense.. progarm was installed in trial mode.. any help?"
,upit,2011-01-12T12:44Z,If i did get paid buy eset iwould not be telling how to rip them of. I like avast and used it for the past year but nothing works it propley now so i found this other thing that works untill that gets fuckedup..
,arush1989,2011-01-12T14:37Z,@upit: i dont think that u have installed this file uploaded by locobot12 which is working correctly.... first install and then comment
,msveers,2011-01-12T18:14Z,does it come with instructions? i'm hopeless with installs.
[T],locobot12,2011-01-13T00:36Z,"@skip747 
where did u get the ashbase.dll file from ? the previous version 5.1.864??

U dont have to use that file ...

*First disconnect from internet during install
*Install
*restart
*Go to Maintainance > Subscription > Incert License file
*Incert file click ok to dialogue
*ur status should activated with a valid license till 2012.

IMPORTANT :-
go to Settings[above in UI] > update > 
Set 
Engine and virus definitions - automatic 
program - manual
-----------------------------------------------------
The Problem u said happens when u update engine!! do not do that!

Since that has already happened u gonna have to uninstall , clean registry, do a reinstall clean!!


That Should work!!
Cheers! "

Hey man awesome. Thx for the upload. The new one u put the link to isnt working, theres no such file. Any idea why?"
,arush1989,2011-01-14T12:27Z,@ locobot: why the newest version of your avast file was removed? U removed it or the piratebay mods?
,MAX_32,2011-01-14T13:11Z,"hey when i restart avast turns back to avast free antivirus.........
If you can please give me the steps.......
And also thanks it saved my computer......."
[T],locobot12,2011-01-15T02:51Z,"@tseblade @arush1989

,arush1989,2011-01-15T06:15Z,@Max_32: why u r installing both of them?? Install either pro or internet security version. Remember that only single antivirus should be installed in a pc. If more than one installed there would be conflicts.
