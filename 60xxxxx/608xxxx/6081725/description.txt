Gameplay

Minigames in Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 are played by entering a mode known as \'Trips\', which is divided into five regions of the Earth: USA, Europe, Asia, South America, and Tropics. Each region has 9 minigames, 5 of which are randomly chosen each time the player begins a trip. Completing a trip unlocks those minigames, which can later be played individually through Free Play mode. Additionally, players can use a Trip Customization mode to create their own trips using the available minigames.

Rayman Raving Rabbids 2 features a wide variety of minigames that focus on different themes and use different control schemes. In rhythm music games, players use selective instruments (singing, guitar, drum, keyboard, etc.) to perform as part of a Rabbid band. Each minigame can be played with up to four players at once, as either Rabbids or Rayman.

Shooting games, which in the first Rayman Raving Rabbids were scattered among the regular levels, have now been moved to a separate area called the Shooting Arcade, where they can be played after completion of Trips. These first-person rail shooter games utilize real footage of locations around the world with Rabbids digitally inserted. As with other games in the Raving Rabbids series, plungers serve a primary role as ammunition.


Character customization

Raving Rabbids 2 features the ability to create both custom Rayman outfits as well as custom Rabbids. These outfits are often parodies or references to famous movie or video game characters, including Indiana Jones, Spider-Man, Superman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Sam Fisher, Ken Masters from Street Fighter, a Mantel Trooper from the PlayStation 3 game Haze, Sailor Moon, Command and Conquer: Generals, Friday the 13th and the Altair costume from another Ubisoft game, Assassin\'s Creed that often referred by fans as \"The Bunny Creed\".

Characters

Rayman and the Rabbids return in this game. Players take the role of Rayman in Trips mode, and have the option of playing as either Rayman or a Rabbid in Free Play mode. It is possible to unlock costumes for both Rayman and Rabbids by completing high scores in both minigames and shooting games, or by shooting a specific Rabbid in each shooting game. Occasionally, when the player beats a high score, a new Rabbid will join their party as a play-and-customizable character.


Story

The game starts with Rayman infiltrating a mall overrun by Rabbids. As he\'s about to sneak in, he disguises himself wearing two socks on his head, a headband, two makeshift eyes, and helium (in order to disguise his voice, thus blending in more with the other Rabbids). He then picks up a soda can and throws it to distract two guard Rabbids and steals one of their plungers. Rayman climbs to the roof of the facility and peers through a skylight, where he observes the Rabbids watching a montage of everyday human life. Seconds later, one of the Rabbids jerks its head, noticing Rayman\'s presence. Accidentally, he falls into the mall and is spotted. Professor Barranco the Third, a highly intelligent Rabbid with split color eyes, walks up to him and whips out a European Wii copy of the first Raving Rabbids game. Taking a look at the cover, it seems to recognize Rayman. Thinking quickly, Rayman screams \"DAAAAAAAAH!\", convincing the Rabbids that he is one of their own. Rayman and the Rabbids are then led into an airborne submarine, taking him to a location for invasion.
