This is a first of a kind (instrumental) mixtape for us at GoodMusicAllDay to sponsor but we are proud to present Tunde Junior's new project The Force (The Birth of TUNE). These instrumentals are smooth and great for putting on while doing work or just relaxing on the couch. And if you are an artist of any type, then you will love having a mixtape like this. To get a feel for what the project is about, Tune has put together a fresh interlude with Big Sean and Pharrell Williams sharing their dreams. Enjoy these and hit the jump to see the tracklist!
