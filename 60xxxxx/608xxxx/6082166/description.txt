Writer: Philippe Sollers 


One of the most incredible attempt of the cinema's history. 40 minutes and a single subject (glorious ambition) : how to film the MÃ©diteranÃ©e ? Pollet built a space of sensation, putting things in line without explicit intentions. He didn't film himself more than a half of this movie, he has just ordering things (antique ruins, corrida, dead girl after the operation, factory, Horus) according with his own obsessions : darkness, morbid & illuminate feeling, chaos ('when there is life, there is death and there is chaos' he seems to say) and pain. In France, Pollet was considered as a great film director after it - he gave a shock. We can't believe he's unknown in other country so, react !
