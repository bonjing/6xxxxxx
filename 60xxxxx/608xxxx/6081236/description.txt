Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii (1972)

If you love Pink Floyd and haven't seen them live before, prepare to be awed!

This is the original cut, the best one.
The director's cut (2003) is awful! Don't download it.

This is a proper NTSC DVD from the highest quality source at the correct progressive frame rate speed and audio pitch. It is better than retail.
All the other copies out there - even the commercial DVD releases - are sped up and sound bad.

Please seed and enjoy! Long live Pink Floyd.
