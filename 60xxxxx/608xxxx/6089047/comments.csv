It is very hard to get a working key for avast these days most keys have been rumbled by avast i have the 2012 key for about 6months which i got of pirate bay but it started sending pop ups saying you may not be aware but your licence is illigal. that why i had to install eset nod32 antivirus 4 30 day trial and i found that at the end of the trial if i uninstalled it with ""your uninstaller"" restarted my computer reinstalled eset igot another 30 days trial..someone else try this it works for me goona do it again next month.."
