,jhinlol,2011-08-03T14:57Z,"To anyone who is having problems extracting the game, it's pretty easy: when you're going to extract, you have 2 options, ""Extract to Demon's Souls blablabla"" and ""Extract Here"". You need to choose ""Extract Here"", because if you choose the other option, the file path is going to be huge and therefore WinRAR will go apeshit with files that, along with the file path, exceeds the 260 character limit."
