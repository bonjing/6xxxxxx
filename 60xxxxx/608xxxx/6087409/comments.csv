,Ru7v42pl0,2011-01-12T02:42Z,Thank you for this.
,Ru7v42pl0,2011-01-13T02:03Z,Total garbage.. Don't download.. Takes up only a small fraction of my screen.
[V],manOtor,2011-01-13T02:12Z,"^^???^^

This has the regular HDTV release format:
624x352.
Read the description before you download, then you don't have to be disappointed ;)!

And only because you seem to have a flatscreen TV with the size of half of your room's wall, there is no need to tell others (who might own a bit smaller screen) not to download this torrent!
I for one find this watchable on my TV.

Cheers"

,DiDiOi,2011-01-23T14:01Z,What is the difference between the two Pilots except the one HDTV and the other DVDRip?
[V],manOtor,2011-01-28T00:35Z,"The difference between the two pilots is mainly the special effects. I found a german site comparing some screenshots:
http://www.caprica-city.de/index.php?seite=caprica_episodenguide&aktion=showfolge&ID=81

As the Pilot was published on DVD sometime before it aired on TV, the producers used the time in between to enhance some effects that lat caprica come to life.
In short: the TV version has better developed special effects."

,yelloo,2011-02-28T09:52Z,Thanks man-o-tor.
,LadyLaceySilver,2011-03-17T15:20Z,Anyone have just season 2 up Damn i wish they didn't cancel this or Galactica sighs it's always the good shows 
,r08star,2011-04-02T16:35Z,"both you ru7v42pl0, and you man-o-tor, are some numbskull dipshits. First of all a ratio of 624x352 is not the HDTV standard (that would be at least 1280x720, or more seen 1280x768, for 720p and at best 1920x1080 for 1080p). It doesn't matter though that it is 624x352, because you can watch it without any problem on a 40inch LCD TV. I am downloading it now, and will verify. But the first user is dumb for not reading the pixel ratio, the uploader is actually even dumber to say his pixel ratio is HD quality.

Anyhow, I want to thank man-o-tor for uploading the torrent. Without uploaders we wouldn't have numbskull discussions, and more important: we would have nothing to see!!!"
,r08star,2011-04-02T16:40Z,"BTW, HDTV release standard may be true, it means that the rip came from the TV that broadcasted the episode in HD quality 720p or 1080p, but it doesn't mean that it is HD quality as I described above. So man-o-tor, your less a numbskull than Ru7v42pl0."
,r08star,2011-04-02T16:44Z,"I take my words for a part back:
The HDTV release means that the rip came from a source that was a TV, that broadcasted in HD quality format 720p, or1080p.

So man-o-tor, you are less a numbskull than Ru7v42pl0 is."
[V],manOtor,2011-04-04T21:18Z,"@ r08star:
First I have to say, I am genuinely relieved that you reconsidered your insult. I don't know if I could have lived with the full extent of being a numbskull ;).

Indeed you are right - HDTV format is 1280x720 for 720p and 1920x1080p for 1080p (for the so called Full HD resolution). I am glad you shared what you've learned at ""SmartAssUniversity"" so far :D!
But since I never wrote anything about 624x352 being HDTV ""standard"", the same advice as for Ru7v42pl0 applies to you:
You really should read the posts carefully you intend to comment on, otherwise you might look as a numbskull yourself ;)...
But I see you already revised your error partly in your last post:
I wrote, that ""This has the regular hdtv RELEASE format"" - meaning that the scene groups that provide us with those fine rips have a HDTV source from which the rip is created. There is usually a so called ""HDTV XviD"" release (small file size) and most of the time also a ""720p HDTV x264"" release (bigger file size) for those who'd like to enjoy real HD.

That said, I believe your last sentence was supposed to say:
""So man-o-tor, you are NOT a numbskull AT ALL.""

Cheers,
;) "
