Release Title:  Stone 2010 720p BRRip H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)
Directed By: John Curran
Tagline:
Parole officer Jack Mabry (Robert De Niro) has only a few weeks left before retirement
and wishes to finish out the cases he's been assigned. One such case is that of Gerald
"Stone" Creeson (Edward Norton), a convicted arsonist who is up for parole. Jack is initially
reluctant to indulge Stone in the coarse banter he wishes to pursue and feels little sympathy
for the prisoner's pleads for an early release. Seeing little hope in convincing Jack himself,
Stone arranges for his wife Lucetta (Milla Jovovich) to seduce the officer, but motives and
intentions steadily blur amidst the passions and buried secrets of the corrupted players in
this deadly game of deception.
