      There are a few bits in spanish in the movie which have       
      hardcoded english subs. We found 2 sentences in spanish that  
      are not subbed but they do not have softsubs either so they   
      are obviously not supposed to be translated (what's often     
      refered to in softssubs as "man speaking spanish").
