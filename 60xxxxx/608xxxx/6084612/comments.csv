,YYqpYY,2011-01-14T22:04Z,i cant get any mods working. any ideas?
,YYqpYY,2011-01-14T22:07Z,"McGuffey.
I had same proplem but there should be autorun named texture file when u open foled in that disc (when mounted) just reed what it says it would open and then just use them to gether
sorry for im not good in english"
,Ki113r94,2011-01-15T04:47Z,yyqpyy. after you copy the mods to the appropriate folders. open up the oblivion launcher and select data files and then select the mods you want. They should be in the game but some are hard to find in the game (the ones that are not quest) they should be there. that is all i can think of. Hope this helps
,souliss23,2011-01-16T05:44Z,When i try to hit new game it wont let me i did everything as you told me to please figure this out asap its rather upsetting
,souliss23,2011-01-16T05:52Z,I did everything like you told me in the notes but when i open the game get through the cut scenes and try to start a new game it wont let me i just click on yes and it does nothing please tell me how to fix this asap it wont let me uninstall it either
,Ki113r94,2011-01-18T00:58Z,"I don't know what the problem is, but maybe your computer does not meet the system requirements. That is my only suggestion. sorry for the bad news. "
,Yestreen,2011-01-20T02:16Z,"Thanks for the upload.  I hope that this works, this is my first time downloading a game from TPB.  "
,Ki113r94,2011-01-20T23:17Z,Good Luck
,JackNitroWins,2011-01-22T03:34Z,"I'm having the same problem that a lot of people seem to be reporting. Whenever I insert my disk with the .mdf file burnt on it, I autorun it. 

I get the music followed by a user control window. Whenever I click accept, the music stops and the disk begins to be read. Eventually, it gives me the following error:

I am running Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit. If you or anyone else has a solution to this, please post it or consider looking into it. This looks like such a great torrent and game and I'd hate to pass it up because of a little thing like this."
,JackNitroWins,2011-01-22T03:38Z,"I forgot to mention, I get a similar error whenever I attempt to perform the installation on a virtual drive. It keeps asking for the ""original disk""."
,Ki113r94,2011-01-22T17:11Z,"My computer is a win7 64bit, and it runs fine. Wish I knew how to fix your problem."
,gtfando,2011-01-23T00:07Z,"Hi, i'm sort of new at torrents, and i dont know where to copy the no CD crack, or where the install directory is... please help."
,McGuffey,2011-01-23T20:40Z,"I've mounted disc one, and run the installer, but all that happens is that the music starts playing, and the screen doesnt change at all. Anyway I'm screwing up here?"
,Tompod,2011-01-24T16:20Z,Has anyone gotten this torrent to work except for the uploader?I've been getting the same problem as JackNitroWins I've burnt the CD1 and tried installing and all I get is the launcher music for about 3 seconds and no actual launcher appearing then get the same error as JackNitroWins showed.Some info on this would be very nice
,Tompod,2011-01-24T16:24Z,Can't see my own comment testing
,dingo80,2011-01-25T00:15Z,"Just started Downloading.
Thanks for the files.
Will seed for a few months"
,Byrdclaw,2011-01-25T04:21Z,"Mounted and tried setup.exe.  That crashed out with a securom error.  I then ran the autorun and that installed with an error on one of the cab files that it didn't match up how it should have.  I skipped that file and finished the install.  Moved the crack over, game starts but I can't start a new game.  I just get to the intro screen and that's it.  This shit is broken."
,Byrdclaw,2011-01-25T04:37Z,"""CRC error: The file C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Data\Oblivion.esm doesn't match the file in the setup's .cab file.  The medium from which you are running the setup may be corrupted..."""
,Tompod,2011-01-25T14:03Z,"Confirmed,this thing doesn't work"
,Ki113r94,2011-01-26T19:03Z,"To all of the people who are going through a difficult time with this torrent. It does seem like none of you can get it to work, i dont know what to say because it works great for me. If you guys have any suggestions for me to fix this, or even i you want me to delete this torrent to save some of you the trouble I will. or If you guys want i can re-upload another oblivion torrent that is an ISO not MDF. Someone please respond.  From: Ki113r94 (Up-loader)"

,HyperPsyKho,2011-04-03T23:03Z,"Hey, thanks I'm using just the plugins and mods, not the main disks as I own them. They work great, I'm downloading them a second time now xD"
,tylerf1234,2011-05-16T05:22Z,"could somebody put just the mods, construction set and add ons in a torrent so it wont be such a big file? the seeds on this blow!"
,Ki113r94,2012-01-08T23:41Z,"OK. since this torrent is not working for you people, and I have no idea what is wrong because it works great for me, i will be deleting this torrent on January 20 2012. This gives you enough time to finish your download if partway through. If you want me to extend the deletion date, just leave a comment and tell me how long you need. Sorry for the inconvenience, this was my first torrent. At least the mods and DLC work."
,Ki113r94,2012-02-23T05:24Z,It wont let me remove it. oh well :(
