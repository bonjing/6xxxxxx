[T],zeromancer,2011-08-17T22:30Z,I dont understand why the need for a folder for each episode :(
,bashar0151,2011-08-23T10:40Z,very good quality I will seed non stop but we need more seeders so we can seed quicker and mainly make it quicker to be downloaded. I have MB upload wit out other seeders I cant use all my upload speed I can only use like 300 KB/s we need more seeders.

,stonelesscutter,2011-10-05T05:22Z,"This torrent is indeed coming in rather slowly. In fact I'm watching the episodes faster than they're coming in which just sucks, especially since I'm seeding at full capacity. Been waiting for a certain episode to finish downloading for a couple of hours now despite the fact that I had already downloaded like 90% of it at that time."
,Peskens,2011-10-10T21:11Z,Where is Episode 12 of Season 12 ?
,rarryballs,2011-10-28T09:43Z,please seed
,Clipper2010,2011-11-04T08:13Z,"This would have been a great torrent, had the creator not been brainwashed into the MVK is better bullshit. Only thing MVK is better at is being incompatible with the most amount of software & hardware players.

Ok, ok, to be fair, MVK does allow imbedded subs (the ONLY thing it does that no other format does), which 99% of the people don't give a flying crap about. 

Thanks, but no thanks."
,rabbit2345,2011-11-21T01:19Z,"ok, i am connected to over 50 people, yet i'm only getting 70 kb/s!! i normally get 1 mb/s !!!

,evilmiky,2011-12-17T13:29Z,"in season 7 is bad episodes numbering,myabe all numbering is bad but i only need 7. FU asshole"
,pspguy,2012-02-09T01:43Z,IS THIS UNCENSORED??????
,smile_its_free,2012-04-26T06:27Z,Too many leachers don't even bother with this... :(
,Phatfish,2012-06-06T15:23Z,"I'm downloading at 800-900 kB/s at the moment.
I think that is good enough for most people. 

Does not seem to be uncensored though. 

Thanks for the up!"
