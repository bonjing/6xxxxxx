,Oerwinde,2011-01-08T10:23Z,Any way we can get better quality vids? These are cut off on the top and bottom and really lousy resolution. But I am thankful for them as until this week it was the only way to get this show in Canada.
[T],iqeiqe,2011-01-08T19:11Z,"Oerwinde, have you ever heard the term 'letterbox' ? Absolutely nothing important is cropped. There are just black bars on both, top and bottom. Were you expecting HD from an SD source encoded with DivX in an avi container? Simply put, stop bitch*ng! Beggars can't be choosers. At least you said thank you -__-"
