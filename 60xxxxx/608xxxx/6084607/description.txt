Working 24x7? Delaying life until it's too late? You have the ability stop! Having it All ...and Making it Work is a fast-paced, easy-to-use book offering you a new pathway towards managing personal life and professional life--without sacrificing either one of them. This book isn't just more whining and exhortation: it delivers specific, bite-sized, no-fluff solutions for managing your life, including crucial execution steps you can take immediately. 

Mills teaches you how to identify and balance what's most important to you--and give up what you don't want badly enough. He also shows how to make the balance real, not just talk; how to make career decisions that promote balance; and how to make course corrections that refine your balance over time. Mills also exposes the potentially disastrous myths and rationalizations many people use to avoid the realities of work/life imbalance--fallacies like "I'll devote all my time to work for 15 years, get rich, and then I'll pay attention to family." Mills' breakthrough work/life courses at the Harvard Business School are helping business people find the balance they're searching for. The techniques he's developed will help anyone struggling to get a grasp on the work/life balance challenge..............
