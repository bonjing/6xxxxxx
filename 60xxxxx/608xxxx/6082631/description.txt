Storyline: Death Race 2 takes place in the very near future, as the United States economy begins 
to decline and violent crime starts to spiral out of control. To contain the growing criminal population, a vast network of for-profit, 
private prisons springs up, creating a lawless subculture ruled by gangs, cold-blooded killers and sociopaths. The worst of these 
prisons is Terminal Island. Convicted cop-killer Carl Lucas arrives on the Island to serve his life sentence just as ruthlessly ambitious 
television personality September Jones launches the ultimate reality show, Death Race. A brutal prison yard demolition derby that pits 
prisoners against each other in steel reinforced, heavily armed vehicles, Death Race offers the winner the ultimate prize: 
freedom â€” if he can survive to enjoy it. When Lucas signs up to be a driver, the stage is set for the birth of a legendary racer.
