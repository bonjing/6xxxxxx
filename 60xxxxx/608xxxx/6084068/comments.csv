Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

I'll continue the feedback like yesterday just to let you know which shows I DL. Thanks for the  CF show (always good for a laugh). 

I'll give [Insecurity]  ago and see what it is like - sounds like the [A-Team - government sanctioned].
[Covert Ops] is back soon isn't it?

 I'll also give [V] a go even though it annoys me, not your encode the show itself, for so many reasons. But then there are small moments of writing brilliance."
