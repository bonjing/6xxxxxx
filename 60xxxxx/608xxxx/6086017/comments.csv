,e5frog,2011-12-14T02:19Z,"Season 1 is great quality, season 2 is extremely disappointing. 4:3 screen with black bars on the side - on a 4:3 TV you get a black frame around the whole screen...
Some episodes are missing pieces and as this is probably the only version of season 2 you'll find out there it is still missing 11 and 27.
This one seems to be a better alternative:
