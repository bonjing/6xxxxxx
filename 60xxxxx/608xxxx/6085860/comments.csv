,MarkJohnson,2011-01-14T09:09Z,"Stereoscopic Player won't play MKV files.  I even tried the newer ones (1.6.6) and still no support.  I try to force it by selecting ALL FILES and it reports not supported.

Plus Stereoscopic Player requires purchase or it plays only 5 minutes according to the website.

Thanks for the upload, maybe another player will play it properly?"

You need to format your flash drive to NTFS (if you use Windows) or HFS+ (if you use Mac)."
,simonXR,2011-10-20T21:39Z,"So if i'm to download this, would the whole movie be in red cyan, or could I just enjoy a 1080p standard movie on my TV?"
,howyeman,2012-01-27T23:05Z,"TO ALL LG 3D TV USERS!
DTS is NOT compatible if you plug your usb hdd directly on the TV, don't panic, just use this tool http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKV2AC3 and it will remove the DTS from the movie!
I takes around 20 min to get the work done, but it does an amazing one! Good luck LG 3DTV users!"
