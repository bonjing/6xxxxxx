If you care about audio at ALL, find another copy - this one sounds like a gramophone recording..."

You must have problems with yours ears! :(

,elfloy,2011-11-12T23:50Z,"Kennyj340 is right.

The video quality is good.
But the Audio is awful.
It sizzles and is saturated.

Sorry Zen_Bud.
Your other uploads was great though."

I have only stereo audio system so with it there is no problem with audio, but I dont know how it sounds with dolby. I just say its perfect with stereo"
