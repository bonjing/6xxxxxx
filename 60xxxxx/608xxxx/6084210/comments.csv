,thebeav111,2011-01-09T18:46Z,"if you want a good strategy game similar to SC2 (but a bit slower pace, which is nice, allows for more strategy) pick up Supreme Commander 2, or 1 and the expac, or Total Annihilation"

,Skibblez,2011-04-10T17:04Z,How do you update it to the newest version? I'm a noob so please give easy instructions. Thanks!
,dangleskin,2011-06-05T22:33Z,"ONE word : Virus

Why no one gave a comment about this?  :("
,the3kingdoms,2011-08-06T07:10Z,"dangleskin, stop crying... this file doesnt have a virus, most virus programs pick these games out to be viruses. This guy has an good rep of pirating games for the community and I like this guys work and also Extremezone's. So if you dont know how to operate this site and the stuff it offers you. Please dont run off in the mouth! Thank You and have a nice day!!!"

,aralkis,2012-05-06T21:11Z,"I'm having a problem with some combat comands and the hotkey shortcuts. No hotkey works and when I right click during combat to issue a movement comand, It opens the menu as if I clicked de botton in the bottom-right. When I try to left click and select one of my ships instead it is targeted. I think it is like im holding alt, I gess...could anyone help me?"
