The Chronic is the solo debut album of American hip hop artist Dr. Dre, released December 15, 1992 on his own record label Death Row Records, and distributed by Priority Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in June 1992 at Death Row Studios in Los Angeles, California and at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. The album was named after a slang term for high-grade marijuana. The album cover is a homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers.[1] The Chronic was recorded by Dr. Dre following his departure from hip hop group N.W.A and Ruthless Records over a financial dispute, and consequently featured both subtle and direct insults at Ruthless and its owner, former N.W.A group member, Eazy-E. Although a solo album, it features almost as many appearances by Snoop Doggy Dogg, who used the album as a launch pad for his own solo career.
