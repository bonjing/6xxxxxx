4 castle & HIMYM"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-04T21:08Z,"@mzk57: Thanks.
Your suggestion is generally not bad, but I don't ""tag"" my torrents, I do tagging to my encodes. 
Also,  for years (and all people who really appreciate my work) have read 9th and tenth line.
Further, if anyone need to do TPB search for my ""home-page"" or torrent, could do simple

+480p
or
+h264
as for example
castle+480p

but it is bad idea since I started doing TV and Movie Packs.
So, my first advice is the best one."

,jon4fun,2011-01-04T22:24Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

Cheers

I see your inviting comments on favourites, as to keep in schedule or not.
My votes goes for:
Castle, Two and a Half Men, No Ordinary Family. I'd also vote for Men of a Certain Age even though I've never seen it, I like the actors. 
I might try to catch up and DL S1 at some stage when I've got allowance to spare.

Thanks again for all your work."
,verazationable,2011-01-04T22:26Z,"Thanks for castle, HIMYM, and pretty little liars"
,dark_defender,2011-01-04T23:55Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for HIMYM, No ordinary family and Two and a half men and my vote goes to these shows for the schedule.

P.S: Thanks for accepting my request on previous thread. "

What does 'mvo' and 'avo' means, written after a movie torrents name?
Tried to google it didnt find anything.
I think you might know."

@i_am_sid: I've never seen these two. Therefore, it probably means nothing. I have posted my naming rules and Scene naming rules are available on Google:
do Search
What is a CAM, R5, DVDRip, DVDSCR, XviDâŚ?"
,i_am_sid,2011-01-05T13:38Z,"@twentyforty
Can you please encode----------Appleseed 2004--------------in BRrip and dual Audio { English and Japanese (original) }. I have searched all different trackers but didnt find decent rip. 
So at last i came to you. I know you can do it. Hope you like it too.
