This is an album that oozes class in every department, but most obviously through musicianship and lyrics that, in many cases, address a variety of contemporary social issues. Already very popular on the live folk circuit, with this album Little Johnny England have recorded their Liege & Lief, presenting a set of songs that tell stories and get you rocking, while making you think at the same time.

Instrumentally, itâ€™s built on a bed of fiddle, mandolin, melodeon, guitars and drums in a most cohesive and tightly balanced unit. Veteran guitarist PJ Wright is among the talented younger players, adding some trademark steel-edged flourishes, but this is very much a band album of tremendous class; memorable and intelligent songs such as Lily Of Barbary, Ginger Billy, Cutthroats, Crooks & Conmen and the title track all stay with you from first play. Well packaged, with an essential lyrics booklet, thereâ€™s no doubt that this is one of the finest folk-rock albums for decades. Time to rejoice in real quality
