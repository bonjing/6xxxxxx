2-Disc Set. Just when Joanna and her Angels think they can take a vacation, the city is overcome by a terrible douchebag invasion that only three sexy, class-A superheroes can overcome. Evan Stone, AKA CEO of Affuktion Clothing, has sprinked his T-Shirts with a hypnotizing serum that makes everyone in LA obsessed with shiny lame T-shirts. Once the epidemic spreads to Joanna`s favorite booty call, she knows it`s time to get down to business, and that business is having her intern, Tommy Pistol, run around town gathering evidence while she and team fuck their way out of - and into - trouble. Will the Angels save the city before it`s too late? Or will Los Angeles suffer from an eternity of douchebaggery? Find out in this hilarious and filthy epic comedy starring your favorite punk rock sluts.
