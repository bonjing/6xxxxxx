                    Deadly Intent.                           
                    First of a three-part crime drama in which DI  
                    Anna Travis is reunited with DCS James Langton  
                    for another challenging case. The shooting of  
                    an ex-police officer leaves a notorious drug  
                    dealer as the obvious suspect. However, Travis  
                    is convinced that things are not as they appear  
                    and that something much bigger is at stake. But  
                    as she strikes out on her own, tensions within  
                    her team threaten to derail the case.
