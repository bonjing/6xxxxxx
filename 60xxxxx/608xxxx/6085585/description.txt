Dear JM Productions,
I really want to thank you for allowing me to use your company as a stepping stone on my path to superstardom! I will always look fondly upon this movie, since I love getting my mouth, cunt and asshole defiled for my fans. However, my agent has asked me to inform you that I will not be able to make a sequel to this movie. You see, getting sodomized on film, at this point, will only hurt my blossoming mainstream film and television career. From now on I am only going to do the smart thing and fuck Hollywood directors and casting agents since it's been working so well so far. I wish you well, thanks for the memories! -Hollywood Supers, Sasha Grey
