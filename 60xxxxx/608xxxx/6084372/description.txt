This is a collection of books produced by Mongoose Publishing, each adapting the d20 system to a different genre. Each is a complete game in itself, including character creation and advancement rules--thus the OGL, not d20, designation.

The books are:
OGL Ancients (Mythic Greece and Egypt)
OGL Cybernet (Cyberpunk)
OGL Horror
OGL Steampunk

Each is meant to be highly flexible--you can use OGL Ancients to play a strictly historical game or a mythological game, OGL Steampunk to play one set in an imaginary world or in an alternate Victorian earth, with or without fantasy elements.

There is also an OGL Wild West, which I do not have.
