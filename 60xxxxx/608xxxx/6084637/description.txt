Super Mario Bros. X 1.3 is a massive Mario fan game that blends elements from Super Mario 1, 2, 3 and World. It has many power ups, such as the Ice Flower, Hammer Suit, Tanooki Suit, Kuribo's shoe, The Billy Gun, and Yoshi. You can also play the game with a friend in the 2 player co-op mode, were the screen seamlessly splits and combines as the players separate and rejoin.

This fangame is most notable for it's extensive level editor that allows you to create almost any kind of level that you can imagine. The real time editor lets you edit the level while playing it! You can also create your own episode using either the SMB3 or SMW styled world map, or you can create a Mario 64 style hub level and have the players collect stars to advance.


I have also included:

-The Princess Cliche (Episode DLC)

-The Great Castle Adventure (Episode DLC)

-The Invasion (Original Game, Now Bundled)
