envy:~/iou# ./wrapper-linux -m ./i86bi_linux-adventerprisek9-ms -p 9876
Waiting on port 9876 ...
Process Id for child is 16289, parent is 16288

 IOURC: Could not open iourc file

Do you have any idea how to use this IOU?"

He shows how to defeat the licence and to get the program to run."

,Kal2011,2011-02-26T07:03Z,"The comment posting stripped the indentation.

The line which reads ""ioukey = ioukey + ord(x)"" must be indented with a tab in front.

Obviously the script will need to be ""chmod +x"" and python will need to be installed for it to run.

Good Luck,
