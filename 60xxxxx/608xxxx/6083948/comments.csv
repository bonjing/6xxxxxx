3. Start the installer. When it asks for a serial number use the one provided by lukewarmwater123: 0000 0000 0000 3486 Q5HF FG98.
4. Since you are disconnected from the internet the setup will ask you to retry connecting. Simply click cancel and move on.
5. Select the components to be installed and begin the installation. Once done click finish. Remember do not particiapte in the Customer Experience Program.
6. Now copy the content from setup folder to C:/Program Files/SolidWorks Corp/SolidWorks/setup/i386 and run the overwritten swactwiz.exe. Done !

Solidworks is now working on my Windows 7 x64 PC.
What you need to do is simple:
1. Create administrative image for 32 bit, because 64 bit is not possible.
2. Go to the directory you created  your administrative image in.
 for example I created administrative image in C:\SolidWorks Admin\
4. Go to the following dir.  \SolidWorks 2011 SP0\32bit\SolidWorks\
5. Right-click on SolidWorks.msi and set compatibility to: Run this program in compatibility mode for ""Previous versions of windows.""
6. Run Solidworks.msi to install Solidworks
7. Copy the cracks to the install dir. and run the overwritten swactwiz.exe.
8.Your done!

I followed what I could from all the half-baked cryptic instructions but as best as I can tell there is NO 64-bit version included.

Here is my 2-cents worth, in comprehendible English:

Burn the Image file to a dual layer DVD
Follow the instruction in the leer file that say go to X:/sldim/ and then RUN the sldim.exe file. (X is probably your C: drive)

When that file opens you will SEE the option to CREATE IMAGE, and there you can select CREATE ADMINISTRATIVE images, and you want to select CREATE BOTH 32-bit and 64-bit Images. But that doesnâ€™t work because it asks you to insert the 64-bit DISC into the DVD drive to create the image from, which if you HAD the 64-bit disc, you would NOT have to create an Adminstrative Image of it, not to mention that when you point BACK to the mounted ISO disc you just made, the 64-bit version isnâ€™t thereâ€¦

Anyway â€“ once the 32-bit version is done loading (you should already know NOT to be connected to the Internet during install and cancel any dialogs that ask you to connect) THEN copy the files that are in the SW2011-SP)/SETUP/I386 folder (they came inside the original iso file you downloaded) into the /SETUP/i386 folder, and the RUN the swactwiz.exe file that you just copied into that directoryâ€¦

However, if you run swactwiz.exe (like you should have done when you first installed it and it made it work than) again, it will reset the trial time and the SW will load again. 

About SP2, it needs the ORIGINAL installation files of SW to install. If you applied the trial reset and changed the files, I think it won't work - but I didn't try it at all and left with SP0."

One, I can't find the setup/i386 directory anywhere after the installation. I copied files there, replacing swactwiz.

Two, swactwiz doesn't run. After saying ""thank you"", it says ""Error: Can not initialize library (%d, %d, %d)"" and shuts down.

Thanks a lot!

for those that have problems,
1)Unrar the SW2011_sp0_x86.rar file
2)Run setup.exe
3)Use any serial (and then skip the activation step)
4)Copy crack from SW2011_sp0 folder to C:\Program Files\SolidWorks Corp\SolidWorks\setup\i386x
That's all!
Seed for the world!"

,JoffyJ,2012-01-08T12:00Z,"7. install this (make sure your internet is off)
8. this installs the administer image, the admin options will pop up after you install, im not sure if its nessassery but add anouther computer with the right settings, 
9. go into your hard drive (not programs) C:\SolidWorks Admin\SolidWorks 2011 SP0, then startsWinstall.hta which will then run and actually install solidworks program.
9B. Try the same install name but in the 32bit folder there.

,JoffyJ,2012-01-08T12:10Z,"into

C:\Program Files (x86)\SolidWorks Corp\SolidWorks\setup and run swactwiz.exe.

11. if runnig on 64 bit right click the short cut and go on properties, then combatability tab. Click the box run this combatability for:
Then select windows xp service pack 3 (i think windows selectes this for you, but thats what worked for me).

12. If you have the save/open freeze problem then 'Disable Visual Themes' option on the compatibility tab of SolidWorks.exe properties as suggested by garrrobo.
