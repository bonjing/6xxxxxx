,bumarug,2011-05-09T06:10Z,It doesn't have dual audio only English...
,Archonin,2011-05-18T12:28Z,"Don't listen to the idiot above, probably just another stupid VLC-user or haven't installed codecs.
Work great, dual audio and the normal 2 subtitle-modes, 1 for only signs and captions, the other full dialogue.
VLC-users, please stop commenting, 'cause you're using the worst player in the world that rarely ever work. Media Player Classic ftw."

,uaah,2011-10-22T15:12Z,"hi
could someone pls explain how to get english dub/sub?
i already tried some players (vlc/media player classic...)"
,windi512,2011-10-26T21:02Z,"I'd like to know how to see the supposed english subtitles or dual audio too. The SMI files don't have single english sentence in them and the MP4 file has only one video and one subtitle track when I poked around with a demuxer. MPC with latest Community codec pack won't find anything else either.

PS. I took a look only to the files of the first season since I'm not interested about the others."
,windi512,2011-10-26T21:03Z,Correction to my previous post.. the MP4 files had only one video and one AUDIO track (no subtitles at all)
,n0ha,2011-12-01T20:24Z,Nice Quali for that file size.
,GothicGremlin,2011-12-07T19:58Z,ok first off ppl if ur havin trouble changin audio languages on media player classic try doing it through navigation if u dont know what codecs are or dont have them download the combined community codec pack and install it stop using vlc mpc is better
,hitman_reborn23,2011-12-13T04:26Z,Thanks! seeding now.
,calemgarity12,2012-03-31T13:15Z,"first series only contains 2 episodes, repeated like 10 times each"
,calemgarity12,2012-03-31T13:21Z,the second series and spin off are alright
