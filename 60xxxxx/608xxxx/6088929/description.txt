Sousuke Sagara, a seventeen year old military specialist
working for the secret organization MITHRIL, has been as-
signed to protect the latest "Whispered" candidate Kaname
Chidori. To complete this task Sousuke will have to deal
with enemies from his past as well as the occasional panty
thief. Unfortunately for Sousuke, the toughest part of his
mission isn't only protecting Miss Chidori but also getting
used to living an average High School students life, no
easy task for someone raised on the battlefield.

Full Metal Panic! Fumoffu:
Unlike its predecessor, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu is pure
comedy at its best. Derived from a novel, it consists of several
unrelated short episodes dealing mostly with school and school
related activities. Packed with slapstick, comedy and lots of
chances for Sousuke to mess up by misunderstanding common high-
school habits with military drill, Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu is
an assault on your belly muscles thanks to it's unique
setting and background.
