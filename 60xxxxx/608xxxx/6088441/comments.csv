,mrcr0wley,2011-01-12T11:42Z,"Managed to get it working after deleting pk.txt from sdcard/copilot/save left over by previous version.
Once I had done this the fresh install did not ask for a serial and worked from the off.

If you are upgrading take note.

Otherwise a great release!"

[T],joskewarez,2011-01-17T08:21Z,"i thought Australia was in Oceania.. 
Maybe you have to study some basic geography before asking stupid questions"
,Corumirsei,2011-01-19T09:53Z,"Install is OK, but no maps found, even if they are stored in sdcard\copilot folder !!!"

,Limitlesss,2011-01-30T01:31Z,"How do I separate the a country in a specific region, I'm trying to get just the UK maps and I don't want to hold 2gb of Europe maps in my phone when I know I wont really be using them. Need the space on my phone for other things

Thanks for you're help

Ps installs and works fine on the Desire HD"
,lambo_sv,2011-01-30T15:13Z,"I have a simular question, i only want BeNeLux on mine phone (Galaxy S), how to select those countries?

Second question: Can i update the maps using copilot central 2.0 software? it requires a key, it might activate copilot or not?

thx for the up and the speed"
,VirtualMind,2011-02-01T22:30Z,"If you prefer just one country by your selection, don't install the folder with maps on SD card, just simply after the installation of .apk run the program, follow the on screen instruction and then select desired country from the menu. I recommend wi-fi conection and simply download the map from server... I did it just for one country from Central Europe and woks with no problem... and the serial no. is the same as in the previous version 8.2.0.218...  SeeYa :)"

,Lone_Ranger_Here,2011-05-18T13:01Z,"Have 2 problems
1) Not able to see maps - could be because i am in Asia and the maps for asia are not there.

Would appreciate 
1) Maps for asia ( SE Asia does not have the maps for India)
