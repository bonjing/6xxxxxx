Quote from a raving review of this album: â€hottest import since Massive Attackâ€.
Be warned or relieved: if you're only into dark, really depressive trip-hop, you might be disappointed. There are a couple of ambient moments, but The Starseeds are almost always more dreamy than their Bristol counterparts and preocupied about philosophy and spirituality instead of politics.
It is actually quite hard to put it in a category, but the only certain thing is the quality. They have made a follow-up in 2000, and are these days preparing to release a third album, so stay tuned...
