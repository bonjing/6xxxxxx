1976 - Viva Boma


Dont't get fooled by the first short track of the album...
Cos from Belgium combine canterbury music style with chansonesque melodies and some ethnic influences to a real absorbing ear candy.

"Viva Boma", without doubt, is one of the greatest progressive rock albums from the Continent.

"...Owning this album is one of the requisite to being a happy proghead and only the ones who do not know this cannot understand."
