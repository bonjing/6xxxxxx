Penguins really need to look at how Gretzkee was protected on the Oilers - Gretz wouldn't have scored anywhere as many if he didn't have his goons on the ice at all times. If anyone would have touched Gretz the goons went wild. The coaches on the Pens don't seem to get that if someone takes at Croz then they gotta pay - even it's by accident - any hit has to be met with serious retaliation. Croz could outscore Gretz with ease if the Pens coaches would just do their job this way and make sure no one buggered with Croz."
