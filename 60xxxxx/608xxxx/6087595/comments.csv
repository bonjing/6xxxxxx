The people that were discussing her think her name is ""Miranda D""

Do you have any sets of this beauty?
Thanks for your time and effort Marcco."

That is Milena D and there are least three sets of her floating around."

Thank you, didn't have the right name, no wonder I couldn't fine her."

I meant ""find"", not ""fine"""
