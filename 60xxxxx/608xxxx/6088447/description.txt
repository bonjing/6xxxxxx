
Famous Blue Raincoat: 20th Anniversary Edition [Collector's Edition]
Jennifer Warnes
[FLAC]

This has always been a great album where Jennifer Warnes really brings
to life the songs of Leonard Cohen. This Anniversary re-mastered album
offers four tracks not on the original release.  Sound quality is
excellent IMO.
