And the sound from the left rear speaker kept distorted the whole movie.

I totally don't recomend this release!"
,Thor-csf,2011-06-20T10:09Z,"Well, I would like to take back my previous comment. I watched the movie at my HDTV, and these problems I experienced happened on it.
I tested the movie on my PC now at Media Player Classic and VLC Player and it ran normally.
That's strange, because my TV is not malfunctioning, as I watched some downloaded films on it recently with no problems or desynchronizations.

But the problem with the sound from the left rear speaker of the home theater I still think it's from the movie, as also I didn't have that problem with the other downloaded films I watched on my TV."
