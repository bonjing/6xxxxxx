     Ay' yo Sean, you Mr. Kingston

Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love

Don't be scared girl, call on me
'cuz me I want you for my eyes I'm a lover, you see
And the way you are wind and the way you are born
Said no matter how much I feel rushed, I will not stop
But baby girl will you be mine
Go on, show your skin because you're one of a kind
And I'm alive, girl I must be in love
'Cuz the way you are grindin' off my car top

Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love

What if you would just come right out of these clothes
You can finally feel the wind when it blows
Don't be scared to be free to let go, show it off
Feel like letting go
Oh oh oh oh

I'm here and and you might not like
'Cuz you need Sean King in your life
King I'm a man and a man can't change
And if I come over there I'll lock up with them lips
Yo I feel like letting go
If you never know, baby now you know
'Cuz You're one of a kind, and you dress so fine
Like my diamond chain, you shine so bright, oh

Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
Dutty Dutty Dutty love
I'm feeling like you letting go
