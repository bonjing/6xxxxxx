,jager963,2011-01-08T03:43Z,"Ok i helped build this pack and the other author hasnt been clear about how to install. so for those of you who dont know how here gos: Firstly this method is for windows 7 users as it allows merge, windows xp and vista users will have to manually move each folder into the directorys. you should know that every aircraft works perfectly and its super easy to install. but if you have any of the aircraft listed in this  torrent already installed then it would be a good idea to first remove that aircrafts folder from your aircraft directory which is probably.. program files/microsoftgames/microsoft flight simulator x/simobjects/aircraft...folder. with those removed you can simply unrar your completed torrent navigate in to the 5 folders inside, select them all and right click on anyone of them and left click copy...then go to your main fsx folder which is probably  in c:/program files/microsoft games/microsoft flight simulator x, again right click on this folder and left click on paste. allow all the folders to merge with flight sim, which they will begin to do.about 2.74 gig worth! if you are asked to replace any any files click no as you dont have to replace anything. thats it job done enjoy.... this pack has been seriously improved and there are absolutly no faults anywhere having been fully tested on win 7 64bit."

,fsimpro,2011-03-31T03:17Z,"Thanks a lot, although it would have been much better if you placed each aircraft in a seperate zip, so we could choose which ones we wanted to download."
