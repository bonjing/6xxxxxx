Pinched | Lavender Rayne | Cyd Black  + Pics

Lavender Rain is about to get a hundred new reasons to cry. The rope is almost too tight for her to breathe in. It will serve to keep her in place while she faces the ever mounting torments that pour out of Cyd Black. He has no love for her, just a desire to hear her scream. As much as she may want to please him, it is going to be hard to suffer through everything he has planned.
