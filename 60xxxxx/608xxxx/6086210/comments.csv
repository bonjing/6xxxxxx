2. Then it can be run from external (usb)

BTW, this game is not much better than the original. Don't expect Oblivion quality.

Personally, I feel like a part of my life was wasted on a subpar game. 
Thank god for warez that enables us to test before buying. 
If I would've bought this game, with the high pricetag it has, I would've felt ripped off.

There are some glitches with voice acting, possibly due to it being warezed?"
