BFM is a unsigned boogie band from Sweden. They have been aired on internetradio in Germany (www.sqrr.de) and in England (http://www.realhitradio.co.uk) on the Jamie Dyer show and on Swedish radio stations, with positive feedback.
They now also have given a couple of newspaper interviews here in Sweden.
