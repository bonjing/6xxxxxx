,Blodskaeg,2011-01-06T07:29Z,"Yes, i was made as a direct-to-dvd movie. Great upload. Good quality.

Movie sucks though, the animations looks like something from the stoneages, not as good as the intromovies for DoW and DoW2.

And the story is just ... bad... Won't make spoilers though."
,tyrael,2011-01-06T17:04Z,"omg! now that is something i didnt know existed till now... i mean WOW! thank you neonrainbow!

,Scullyy,2011-01-06T17:09Z,"graphics are everything, right children?"
,Scullyy,2011-01-06T17:11Z,"""a member of the military in an infantry or amphibious force""

Why are these guys called marines?"
,The_ichi,2011-01-06T19:07Z,"Scullyy they called Space Marines

short explanation
Marines who travels around space ships

For more info Google Warhammer 40k it is a war strategy figure board games, that the film is based on"
[T],despo1ler,2011-01-06T19:55Z,"@Skullyy,  uhh maybe because they are based in space-SHIPS, the name is given to troops based on spaceships in countless instances,  troops that are merely transported by spaceships are infantry, those who are a permanant part of the ships complement are marines, same as on seafaring ships for centuries."
,ireallyamabum,2011-01-06T22:28Z,Found the animation kinda poor. well compared to the best and most costly ones. And if u havent played the game u probably wont appreciate this.. like myself
,axen81,2011-01-07T00:20Z,"Not bad at all I think. 
Taking into account the low budget I give it a high rating, got some bad-ass action and excellent voice acting."
,heimerrodox,2011-01-07T00:28Z,From the screenshots it looks like graphics in a gameintro.

,Sharak23,2011-01-07T04:08Z,"what the hell is this shit. Oh god, just what we need, another animated war film for our bastard children. "
,showspawn,2011-01-07T07:42Z,"Animation may be outdated, but movie and concept rock! Thank you very much for the UP!"
,johanhgg,2011-01-07T15:42Z,I think you need to have played 40k tabletop game and /or read alot of the 40k universe to truly appreciate the movie. Personaly I love everything that has to do with 40k.
,gesmana,2011-01-07T19:56Z,"Ultras sucked, but at least we've get The Lord Inquisitor one day.

Seriously Codex Pictures. A single fan can create twenty times better models. Are you even trying?"
,dsgjsd2,2011-01-07T20:15Z,As an outsider the first though thats strikes me is what do they (or ever?) do when they visit the mens room? It must take hours remove that 2 tons of armor or a abortion to the eye that even a black pimp or a golf player would refuse to wear. Just give them monte sumas revenge at the mess and all the redressing would kill em all.   
,RedKing13_ca,2011-01-07T21:24Z,This available in 720p or 1080 somewhere?

M: you know, just the fact that we're not buying their dvd and instead watching it from here, just proves the fact concerning quality (bc they're not getting our $$!!), I liked the movie though as a 40K player and fan.  Although DL'ing the torrent and watching it may lure more people than not to actually buy the DVD, you never know, I would like to see some research done on that kind of thing  : )"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-01-07T22:28Z,If you don't like Ultramarines you won't like this and the rest are heretics.
,Kedakari,2011-01-08T03:53Z,"Don't Watch this if your expecting Pixar or Disney grade computer Animation. 
This film is a direct-to-DVD release meant for sale at Games Workshop stores. 
So Unless your a die hard fan and have played the board game, this movie will not appeal to you at all.

,jdearborn91,2011-01-09T01:56Z,"I've never played Warhammer, but I still really enjoyed this movie. I found nothing wrong with the animation, it was more than decent, really nothing to complain about. "
,highlander777,2011-01-09T10:18Z,"Never played the game but this is like Aliens, Starship Troopers, Knight's Templar and Exorcist rolled into one. Too heavy on the religion aspect though. The movie would have been just as good without it."

,evil-bread,2011-01-11T22:45Z,"Download was soooo slow, and no audio, so all in all, big waste of time, wanted to watch this aswell."
,tal0nsyi,2011-01-12T00:03Z,"The CGI isn't that great but it does the job. Some fairly famous British actors doing the voices. 

p.s For Warhammer 40K fans dont expect any Terminators in the movie, the pic is misleading!"
,ireallyamabum,2011-01-12T07:19Z,Just came up with the best idea ever; They should invent an instant-laxative-raygun. Probably the most dishonorable way to go though. Soil ure armor and then get ko:d by a giant sledgehammer. There you go. The war won in ten minutes
,born2b,2011-01-12T08:14Z,Screns dosent work for me...
,sk8rAmbr,2011-01-12T08:38Z,"does it bother anyone that they use an upside down omega symbol for ultra, imo it should be omega marines, this is before seeing the film, the title bothers me enough to comment upon ps I'm american"
,sk8rAmbr,2011-01-12T08:49Z,"this film is absolutely aweful for anyone over the age of ten and can speak proper english, it's a load of bullocks..."
,valiokas,2011-01-14T17:04Z,"if you ever played any modern first person game you'll enjoy this movie. Do not attemt wwatching this with your girl on friday night, this will not get you layed :)"
,dragon_prince,2011-01-14T18:00Z,"This is a movie for warhammer 40k fans and if you dont know anything about the lore your not going to like it... so dont dl and dont make a stupid comment about it being a bad movie + to all who dl it there is a smal book that explains allot but you only get that wean you buy it.



In Nomine Imperatoris!"
,jumpnisse,2011-01-14T19:43Z,Veneration of the immortal Emperor is what the Ultramarines is built upon in the table top game. That's why this movie is religion-heavy.
,neolectric,2011-01-14T21:09Z,"I give the movie a 3/5, it definitely is a first time effort by the studio and it shows.  However, the movie itself has potential for sequels and TV show.  It almost comes off as an episode 1 for a tv series more than anything. 

 These guys can make something out of it if they wish, but this is not the 'definitive 40k movie' in the least.

Mostly for 40k fanboys but tolerable to those mildly interested and wanting to kill the time."
,neurobr,2011-01-16T18:19Z,Nice! warhammer ultramarines are just like starcraft marines =D
,MyCheatingWife,2011-01-16T21:19Z,"What no Terminators!?! Better luck next time, guess I'm just going to have and go and play with my little painted lead soldiers until the next instalment...

I agree with whoever said the DoW (pc game) intros were better quality, if GW release something like that I'd pay good for it."

,goatmanilla,2011-01-21T10:23Z,"As a tabletop player of this game I enjoyed this movie very much.  The computers used to make this were likely hand-me-downs from a larger production company.  The animators were probably novices but still did a great job.  The voice acting was good and the story was compelling.  

Thank you for the up!!!"

i knew nothing of this movie/universe (or the fact its a dice board game lol) before dl. just thought it was a cool concept and was diggin the positive comments. 
great movie! i thought it was based on the Terran race from Starcraft lol. 
i can see alot of movies/games/tv shows coming out of this.

THANKS neonrainbow "
,goatmanilla,2011-01-22T02:02Z,"^^^ It's not a board game, it's a tabletop game.  There's a difference.  And yes dice are used but not in the sense you are thinking.  If you liked the movie though, I suggest reading some of the books to help you understand the WH: 40k universe better.  :)"

,kharnifex420,2011-01-30T04:51Z,"As a loyal servant of chaos this movie disappointed the hell outa me. there was none of the close range bloodletting that marks warhammer 40k as special. i wanted to see marines clashing, fighting and finally dying after they have been torn apart. bolters are bad ass but it takes more than a bolter round or two to drop a space marine. these guys fought like guardsmen. plus scouts should be in scout armor. this would have been a better movie if they were scouts. they were way to green for power armor.

i'm glad games workshop is getting into the movie business finally, but still, these guys fought and died like guardsmen. not space marines.

audio shoulda been better. music was great, sounds of battle seemed to be lacking.

Stay vigilant my brothers"
,hellhammer69,2011-02-04T08:47Z,This movie is fucking terrible! Don't waste your time.
,Keshicus,2011-03-19T04:50Z,"This was a good movie I think for a small budgeted studio. Better story than anything hollywood would throw up.  The plot was simple but enough to give fanboys something. I think this can be a series or give way to more improved and better movies. But if we just pirate it it won't help them. I bought the dvd box, its not expensive. If you're a loyal 40k fan, buy it so they can do more."
,Keshicus,2011-03-19T04:51Z,Also Space Marines > Starcraft pussy marines.
,xblooded1x,2011-05-27T20:16Z,A fucking mazing. And please. Don't EVER compare a space marine to Starcraft marines. We warhammer folks have a thing against Starcraft and Warcraft in general.
,ShadowJax04,2012-02-24T05:23Z,"xblooded1x

because Starcraft ripped off 40K and 40K never ripped off Dune amirite?"
