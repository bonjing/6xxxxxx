,tricycle515,2011-01-29T13:43Z,"hey can you make the filesize smaller?  40 MB?
i love no distinct details, constant pixalization, poor motion scenes, and bland color blending.

now i feel stupid for downloading the 4GB
proper mkv, with 5.1 audio.   your 112k mp3
stereo audio is superior!

,KineticTowel,2011-05-05T14:20Z,"Hey nothing negative meant with this but in the beginning it looks more like a DVD-rip, however later into the movie, around the part where he meets Ray, the quality gets better, how come? Does anyone else have/notice this?

-Towelie"
,KineticTowel,2011-05-05T14:24Z,"Also @Tricyle,

I think when RiddlerA said, please post feedback, he didn't mean be a general douchebag. Information like that is useful, but not when it's brought like you bring it.
