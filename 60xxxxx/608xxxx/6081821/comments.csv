Lemuel Gulliver (Jack Black) is presented as the boss of a newcomer named Dan (T.J. Miller), but he is promoted and is now Gulliver's new boss. Deeply depressed at his dead-end job in the mail room, Gulliver decides to talk to journalist Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet), he convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world ""travels"" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering writer's block, he plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task â€“ to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article confirming that the legend of ships mysteriously disappearing in the area being caused by extraterrestrials is not true."

very bad cam... you just waste your time!

Wait a little for better quality which you then can enjoy to watch, not like this one.
