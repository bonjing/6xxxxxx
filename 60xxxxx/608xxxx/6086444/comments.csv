,nobhead9000,2011-01-23T07:17Z,"clint mansell is rubbish. this is a brilliant film in every way except his music. the main theme is alright but it's the main theme, it should be more than alright, it should have more than one idea. and then at 6:10 he plays the theme from solaris. and he doesn't do it very well. arg, wanker"
,igorstravin,2011-02-07T01:40Z,Am I stupid or will this not unzip?
,igorstravin,2011-02-07T02:20Z,"OK, I'm stupid.. it's not zipped"
,idrone42,2011-02-17T15:17Z,"this move is carefully made to impress the special kind of idiots out there, the pretentious asshats who think they're stanley kubrick. "
,Roqwell,2011-02-20T05:13Z,"I may sound stupid to some of you, but is this actually HD - as it's described as 1280x544 but not 720p??"
,Dimitris_13,2011-03-19T12:09Z,Man really thank you! Incredible movie! And couldnt find it anywhere else with such a high quality!
,ertq92,2011-03-19T23:04Z,"Great quality, but what's that little file with the same name as the video, but doesn't end with .mkv? My pc now recognizes it as a .Feel-Free file >."
,nath6023,2011-05-04T20:14Z,"@ nobhead9000 , mate, your a tripper and a half. The music????? lol. Please, rate the movie.

,auriga.dwi,2011-05-20T09:43Z,Thanks neonrainbow....
,laned130,2011-06-20T04:02Z,"@Roqwell - you're not stupid - well spotted - 1280x544 means 544p not 720p. Although the quality of the rip is likely to be determined by several other more important factors, exaggerating the pixel-count by 75% is very misleading!
P.S. Before any of you numpties complains that 544 up to 720 is only 32%, please remember that it will be 32% in two directions to maintain the aspect ratio: .32+.32+.32^2=.7424"
,bruno212,2011-07-22T16:16Z,"That piano background music in the film from start to finish, is driving me insane.

Great video quality."
,XWinderI,2011-08-29T15:37Z,thanks neonrainbow for the upload....... :D
,Mutegrill,2011-10-13T13:11Z,"I recieve strange aspect ratio loading the sample in the newest VLC (1.1.11 The Luggage). Its easily fixed though, by determine aspect ratio to 2:21:1 in vlc. So I will download this anyway :-)"
,ArcImpulse,2011-10-25T13:38Z,"The movie is filmed in 2.35:1 so rather than filling it to 720p with black bars the image is cropped. Yes, it's 720p. "
,frankfurter1230,2012-01-09T09:49Z,"The horizontal resolution may be less than the claimed 1080P or 720P because the video is wider than your flatscreen's 9:16 ratio.
The best way to know if it's 720P or 1080P is to look at the HORIZONTAL resolution.

-if it's 1280, it's a 720P video
-if it's 1920, it's a 1080P video"
,dfcham,2012-03-04T23:49Z,"@nobhead9000 - wow. at least you had the decency to warn other piratebay users of your character predisposition before they even have the misfortune of reading your nonsensical musings.

@neon - thanks again for yet another quality rip u/l.

enjoy this film, guys. It is brilliant."
,Viciously,2012-05-19T21:43Z,Thanks.
