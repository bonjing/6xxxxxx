The Barber of Seville by Beaumarchais
Translated by John Wells
Directed by Ian Cotterell
BBC Radio 3 1984 (Thanks to forget4it for the date)

Prompted by the recent broadcast on Radio 3 of The Marriage of Figaro I've dug into
the archive and come up with this the first of Beaumarchais' Figaro trilogy.
Not sure when I recorded this, sometime in the 1980's I think. Encoded at 128/44.1 from
an old tape the sound is not perfect. There is some background noise but this improves
as it goes on. For those of us brought up on medium and long wave broadcasts it will
not be a problem.
