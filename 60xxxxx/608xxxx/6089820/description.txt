Encoders Notes: De-interlaced the origional and converted to 1080p. Did alot of denoise then sharpen as well. This was worn out looking and dirty as hell before i encoded it. Looks realy nice now 

This is the us unrated version. The two big give aways are...
The title credits on the movie call it Dead Alive and not Braindead. Only the American release was called Dead Alive. This was due to a legal conflict.
The runtime of this is 97 mns wich makes it bang on the runtime of the Us unrated version as per indicated in the imdb.

Note: A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.
