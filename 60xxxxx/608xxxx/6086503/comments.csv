,pindari,2011-01-12T15:16Z,"@chusca I never imagined to like this so much! It is so greater than screensaver. I turn it on when listen to audio books and to calm me when clients annoy or telephone sends me to hold. 

Thank you very much! 

@neil22768 I also make a similar cry when I must close it and open work programs! XD"
