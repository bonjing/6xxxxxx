rodney come home 1990

The classic feature length episode, originally transmitted on Christmas Day 1990.

When Cassandra places more interest in the bank's badminton club than in her husband's dietary distress, Rodney decides to return to the Trotter nest. But just as Del's romantic room-sharing plans begin to bear fruit, disaster strikes: Rodney succeeds in asking the bird from the exhaust centre to the pictures! Del Boy decides that Cassandra must be told the truth; after all, it's the least a loving brother could do...isn't it?
