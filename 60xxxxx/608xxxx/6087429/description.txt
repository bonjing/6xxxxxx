White Goodman is the owner and founder of Globo Gym, and would love
nothing more than owning Average Joe's Gymnasium. Peter LaFleur doesn't
want to lose his gym to Goodman, but can't find a way to get $50,000 in
time. Peter and his gang of gym buddies think of ways to raise money,
finally settling on winning a dodgeball tournament. White Goodman
retaliates by creating his own dodgeball team to finish off Peter.
Peter's team doesn't do too well, until legendary ADAA champ
Patches O'Houlihan turns up ready to train them.
