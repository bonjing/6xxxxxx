Thanks for the encodes and uploads.

@All: Plz make sure that you seed, atleast, upto the size of whatever you download. Every ""kbps"" counts. Sharing is caring.

thanks for all the fabulous uploads over the years...(just registered today after having a long struggle with TBP registration) 

I have constantly seen ""Requests are FROZEN"" and therefore humbly request for the following when you have time. I have never found a copy of it ANYWHERE!

Escape from alcatraz(1979)

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079116/"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-05T23:03Z,@mjkuyu: You should left few Thanks or comments before placing the request. But - I promise - I would get BluRay of that classic.

Thanks a bunch..... will be sure to do so in upcoming uploads!"

@ ALL - Please LOGIN (create an account if you do not have one) and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents you DL from 20-40.  It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Be Cool !"
,ltorrentstorm,2011-01-06T03:09Z,"20-40, I wanted to ask you what you think of Handbrake, this soft that converts to mkv and mp4.  Does it do a good job?

On a separate note, one movie I have not been able to get anywhere is 'The Cat's Meow', (2001), with Kirsten Dunst. Not possible for an mp4?

Many thanks as always for your uploads.  Truly admire the quality of what you do. :)"

+1"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-06T10:40Z,"@ltorrentstorm: I have very very limited experience with Handbrake (used maybe four times way back) as with any other software. Maybe ""nitrogun"" could help you more, because I know that he has used HandBrake.
Some people spoke in positive manner about HandBrake right here.

Regarding Cat's Meow and Kirsten - it would be pleasure, but movie is hard to get. I have found two sources and in next couple of days I'll see what can be done."

,hunt_0710,2011-01-06T21:54Z,"Thanx fot The Matador... 
+1... :)"
,ltorrentstorm,2011-01-07T01:14Z,"Thank you 20-40 for your kind remarks.  Yes, Cat's Meow has been hard to get.  I only got to see it once because it was featured in Asian HBO this past Tuesday.  Otherwise, I would have never heard of it.  

'Boardwalk Empire' looks to be another good one.  Looking forward to seeing it.  :)"
