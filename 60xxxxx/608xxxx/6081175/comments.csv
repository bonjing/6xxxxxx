,OrpheusDude,2011-02-10T00:29Z,This is the shortened USA version.  Get the Kino edition (torrent below and tagged as such) which runs about 1:30.

,Saki33,2011-10-14T15:15Z,"I have downloaded three versions. This is the largest of the three and the poorest quality, which makes it look out of focus. I recommend the Kino uploaded by Byron1799, which has the best audio. That one has a yellowish tint to brighten it, but also makes some scenes look green. Run it through VirtualDub's grayscale filter to remove the color and get it back to gray."
