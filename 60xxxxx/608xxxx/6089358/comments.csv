,redriding,2011-01-08T11:16Z,Thanks! will give it a try :)
,jon4fun,2011-01-08T11:39Z,"@ muthineni - My two cents, ignore as you please.

Sorry but you have been misinformed as to this movies plot being similar to Avatar. That statement implies many things and I believe, personally, it is false.
The plot is more similar to a Doctor Seuss movie such as [Horton Hears a Who!] http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451079/

I've seen it and this is just my personal opinion but comparing it to [Avatar] just because it is on an alien planet is going too far.
