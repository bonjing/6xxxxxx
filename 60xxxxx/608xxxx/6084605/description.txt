FORTY LICKS is by far the recommended choice for those who only want one Stones set in their collection. Fans and collectors will only need the four new tracks (which are solid albeit non-essential cuts), but they may appreciate the novelty of having a career-spanning collection, all with upgraded sound quality. Taken as a whole, FORTY LICKS shows that the Stones absorbed a lot of influences, both inside and outside of the rock genre. The Stones manage the rare feat of maintaining a consistent albeit evolving group sound, usually without slipping into a predictable formula. Few artists with four decade-long careers have maintained this level of vitality for so long: as recently as 1997 they still could cut an outstanding, contemporary-sounding track (ANYBODY SEEN MY BABY?) 
I would have preferred the tracks be presented in chronological order, but at least the 1960s-vintage tracks are on disc one, 1970s-present on disc two. If I counted correctly, FORTY LICKS manages to include 16 of 21 tracks on the HOT ROCKS collection, 15 of 23 out of the two THROUGH THE PAST DARKLY sets, and 12 of 18 from the JUMP BACK 1971-1993 anthology...and still squeezes in 7 recent-to-new cuts. While such key cuts as AS TEARS GO BY, MIDNIGHT RAMBLER, WAITING ON A FRIEND, HOT STUFF, 2000 LIGHT YEARS FROM HOME, LADY JANE, and TIME IS ON MY SIDE are missed, there just isn't enough room. In other words, it's impressive that most of the key tracks from past anthologies are now collected in one place.
