,marcus1991,2011-07-16T14:06Z,"its not an edition. its 1080p which comes in those sizes. its large but you wont regret it if you have a big tv with 1080p resolution. fuckers who think 720 or even 480p can be ""OH MY GOD SO GOOD QUALITY THANKS MAN UR THE BEST!!! 10/10"" havent seen the real thing.."
