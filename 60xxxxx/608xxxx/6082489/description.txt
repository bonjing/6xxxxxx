The audio of this dvd is from the exclusive Hang Cool Live CD that was handed out to the audience of the UK Tour shows. 

I added the best videos I could find and edited them into a 25 minute concert. I tried to lipsync it all and in my opinon this is the ultimate Live DVD of this tour. I hope you enjoy this fan made dvd!
