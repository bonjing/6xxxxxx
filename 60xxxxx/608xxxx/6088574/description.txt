Young Pianist's Guide to HAYDN edited and performed by YELDA NOVIK


Recordings to come later once I get one of my machines out of the shop. This a scanned copy of every page of the book. I always thought it was hard to find sheet music so I am releasing some of my collection maybe. I have other intro's to major composers so leave a comment if you think I should post a specific one. I might have ones for Beethovan, Bach, and Liszt. I have a lot more music so feel free to suggest.
