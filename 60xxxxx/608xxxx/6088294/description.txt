Ninon Sevilla is a nice girl from a respectable family whom an accident of fate sends to the streets of Juarez, where she must strive to make a living. Just when things seem bad, her dancing saves the day. This is also a gangster film, so many plot twists follow.

This is OTT melodrama which should appeal to appeal to people who liked Black Swan. I thought NS was better in Victimas del Pecado, since I prefer Cuban Mexico, but this has a more complicated plot.

Mexico was the world centre of Spanish cinema back then - Spain was in disarray, and South America was less technically advanced. Bunuel made some of his best films there then.
