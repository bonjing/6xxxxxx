Notes: Recorded on Robert Lowery's front porch in 1989, 'Earthquake Blues' features the bluesman telling stories and playing songs on his acoustic guitar. His blues is in the tradition of Lightinin' Hopkins and Robert Johnson - he weaves stories and plays deceptively complex rhythms. Earthquake Blues offers proof that traditional blues is alive and well - and vital - in the latter half of the 20th century.
