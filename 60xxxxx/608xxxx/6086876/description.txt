CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Enjoy

First of all, what is this movie?

Endhiran - The Robot is the Greatest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema! 

1. Budget is $35m, most expensive movie in Asia.

2. 2250 prints, 3000 screens, largest worldwide screening after 'Spiderman'.

3.In three language versions, Tamil,Telugu & Hindi with Eng Subs

4. The special effects are as good as Hollywood movies like Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla which is composed of 1500 graphical shots.



Story:
This is a story of android based humanoid named Chitti.
The Movie itself has 2 parts. The first part is getting to know the robot and its purpose (can be compared to the movie "the bicentennical man with robin williams)
It has a lot of funny scenes in action/comedy style.
The second half is action based with a hell lot of cgi like in the movies IROBOT,MATRIX,TERMINATOR etc.
The Movie is mostly hindi with eng subs and has a very good soundtrack.

Hive:
I watched the movie before spreading it.
It is really amazing, this movie has everything in one film combined. You get action,comedy,stunts,fighting scenes, love story and a very good audio soundtrack.
The movie had my attention from the beginning troughout and was getting better and better till the last minute.
I have never seen such a good movie that is not from usa, and the hindi-english audio didnt bother me at all. the story is clear and understandable. and i laughed a really a lot, more then in usa comedy-movies nowadays.
this movie should be seen by everyone who likes action, you wont get disappointed.

Encode:
it wasnt easy to get the full sourcedvd which is needed for the bitrate for the fast action scenes.
The Subs on the dvd itself are not hardcoded and were partly within the black border area.
By cropping away the borders the subs would have been also cut away. Had to extract and replace the subs new and hardcoded them within the video.
Also the movie is nearly 3 hours long and need a lot of bitrate for the action scenes.
Also had to remove the interlace, added brightness,sharpness,corrected rgb colours and denoise.
Overall very nice

ps: there are 3 music intermezzos in the movie which belong to the movie  5 mins.

Video: 720x320 @bitrate 1800 2pass
Audio: DTS to AC3 5.1 @384
Sample: yes included
Subs: yes eng subs are hardcoded[/b]

Rajinikanth as Dr. Vaseegaran and Chitti Babu
Aishwarya Rai as Sana
Danny Denzongpa as Dr. Bohra
Karunas as Ravi
Santhanam as Siva
Devadarshini as Latha
Sabu Cyril as Agent Shah



Dr. Vasi (Rajnikanth) invents a super-powered robot, Chitti, in his own image. The scientific body, AIRD, that must approve the robot, declines it based on its not having emotions and the ability to make rational judgment. A sudden flash of lightning evokes emotions in the robot, and Chitti is seemingly ready for integration into the human world. Then, Chitti falls in love with Dr. Vasi's fiance Sana (Aishwarya Rai) and turns on his creator.
