STORY
Maggie (Hathaway) is an alluring free spirit who won't let anyone - or anything - tie her down. But she meets her match in Jamie (Gyllenhaal), whose relentless and nearly infallible charm serve him well with the ladies and in the cutthroat world of pharmaceutical sales. Maggie and Jamie's evolving relationship takes them both by surprise, as they find themselves under the influence of the ultimate drug: love.

IMAGINE NOTES
First off yes it does have some slight auto focus, but alot better than gullivers travels was, also there is still the scrolling light pulse from time to time. However... only at this time released so take it or leave it. Had to straighten up and pull the sides in then crop and resize ....also video was dull looking and pretty grainy so fixed the colours the best we could and also used a smoother to make it alot better. The audio was line and was only 1 channel so tweaked the audio and created a 2channel audio file and then had to sync to our rip.

credit IMAGINE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
