[T],PeteSapai,2011-01-16T13:18Z,"Adding my 2 cts, without flaming:
This band is amazing and I'd love to get hold of their new albums asap. Unfortunately, these songs (well, track 3-11) sound horrible! (I honestly think I couldn't choose between listening to HQ Justin Bieber or these tracks ;)). Anyway, if you don't care about quality (why would you listen to music, then?!?), get it. If you do, just wait."
