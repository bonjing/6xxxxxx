Blood (2009)

Where does love and lust lead you...if you never die? What destiny awaits an immortal? Is there a destination for immortal love and lust? Shigenori Takechi of IZO incorporated these philosophical questions into his screenplay. Ten Shimoyama of Shinobi turned it into stylish and punk cinematic entertainment.
