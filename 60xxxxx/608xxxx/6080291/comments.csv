,haarlet,2011-01-19T05:56Z,Not Cake's best.  320kbps.  good up.  thanks. 
,kneebutt,2011-03-07T09:16Z,"Thanks for the negative reviews you pack of armchair experts.
And thanks for the up man!"
,Mercer-6,2011-03-22T03:06Z,good torrent. Please mark it as a 320kbps torrent though. Audiophiles can't stand 128s. If you don't like it don't listen. It's really that simple. Cheers.

It's 100% ok for someone to express that they didn't like it.

Deal with it, or go cry to someone who cares."

Thanks for the upload, mate."
