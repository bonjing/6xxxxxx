Journey on a rip-roaring trip through the world of cinema comedy, with the funniest moments in the history of Hollywood, from slapstick of the silents through the screwball comedies of the 1930's and '40's to the red hot hijinks of Hollywood's most recent comedies!

Plus rare early movie comedy behind the scenes footage, foreign film fun, mockumentaries, musical comedies and the unintentional hilarity of movies like Reefer Madness. 100 Stars provide hundreds of laughs for a century of a fun-filled film fest.
