Thanks for sharing and as always the quality is excellent."

i dont think ive ever read a more ignorant statement in all my years torrenting. no offense to u personally sir/mam. but to say you havent listened or given a chance to someone or something simply based on the fact that they are very succesfull in there field is absurd !you are known as a contrarist. know that you know there is a large group of people like you will you stop being a contrarist ? doubt it. all music should not stay a secret . focus on whats going on onstage and less of whats going on in the crowd. have a pleasant day :)"
