,terrenmcc,2011-01-07T17:59Z,"Yeah, just noticed that about the skull.  eztv had it up until yesterday.  Think it's just a pirate bay glitch?  I hope so!  "

,PurityDeath,2011-03-13T22:32Z,"This was cool. I'd watch it. Unlike episodes, I gave it one episode and that was enough. Drop the s, call it a day.

Hopefully they make this happen. Otherwise the occasional made for TV film wouldn't be bad either. As a stand-alone this was pretty decent."
