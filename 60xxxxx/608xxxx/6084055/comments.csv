[V],thethingy,2011-01-05T20:30Z,"anonymous86, you can burn it or mount it as a virtual drive using the power iso link in the description, install power iso then right click the iso and select mount then it will appear in my computer as a cd/dvd, you can use winrar also to extract iso files to a folder.

I just downloaded it, got it on a CD and installed it as well. Everything works perfectly, Only thing is when I first started it, it asked how it needs to be updated, And I selected ""Install all recommended updates automatically""... is that ok?

Also It works fine.. and as far as I can see its not a trial, so I don't need to download the activator? or do I still need to do that?

When I go to Help, It says ""Product Activation Required"", and says ""This product is unlicenced"" Is this normal? or do I need to do something

Thanks guys

Simpley download Daemon Tools lite or as thethingy suggests, Power Iso. They are programs 
that trick your pc into thinking you had a disc in your drive. Just download the file here, then open Daemon or Power Iso and search for the .iso file. 
When you find it ""mount"" it into Daemon or Power Iso and your computer will usually run it like a regular disc and do ""Autorun"" in which case just install it like usual. 

Viola.

If that's still now clear enough just post again or message me. I'll take you through it."
,BeaSTWiTHiN6669,2011-06-29T03:35Z,"@BPare

I use Daemon Tools Lite but it's basically the same. Both are programs designed to trick your computer to think you have a disc in a drive. It does this by creating ""Virtual"" disc drives.

1.Click ""mount"" on PowerIso
2.Browse around for the .iso you downloaded
3.Double click it (duh)
4.It should mount on a virtual drive you have set up ie. ""Drive:F"" or something
5.When it mounts it should open automatically 
6.Follow the instructions and enjoy.

IF this isn't simple enough, post again or message me.
