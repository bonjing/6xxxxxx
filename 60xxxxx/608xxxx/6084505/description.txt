    life, but when a strange old man gives him an Ancient relic and tells    
    him that he is the last bloodline of H.P. Lovecraft, He and his          
    friend Charlie embark on an adventure to protect the relic piece from    
    falling into the hands of the Starspawn and his minions that wish to     
    reunite the relic and release Cthulhu back into the world.
