A savvy XDA forum user has taken the initiative to decompile the Droid Xâ€™s live wallpapers and provide them to the Android masses. At the moment, 6 live wallpapers of the Droid X â€œEyeâ€ are available..

Yes, I found this in a forum and they only work on droid x due to the screen resolution they are set to. so don't complain about it not working if that's not the phone you have.
