can u please upload the hindi audio tracks separately for ur big movies, and a link to ""mkvtoolnix"" the software which can be used for muxing the audio files to video files (for people who don't have it) , coz large movies need a lot of time, money , resources to download, had this been in smaller size like 400mb-450mb , many would have gone for it straight away,


some people have small size rips of movies but only need hindi tracks, which if they can get they'll have a dual audio movie in small size,

""perhaps u can upload the movie along with the hindi audio track file , both in the same torrent"",

please give this idea a serious thought, i had this kind of the predicament , i had a small size rip of a movie, and one of ur uploads was dual audio but in large size >1GB, i needed only the hindi track,there, but alas.....

THANK YOU FOR UR VALUABLE WORK, OF UPLOADING QUALITY MOVIES IN DUAL AUDIO.

KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, AND PLEASE GIVE THE ABOVE IDEA A SERIOUS THOUGHT OR PLEASE ALSO UPLOAD DUAL AUDIO MOVIES IN SMALL SIZE RIPS AND EVEN UR USUAL BIG SIZE RIPS,

SOME PEOPLE HAVE DONE DUAL AUDIO , GOOD QUALITY BRRip IN 400MB TOO, PLEASE TRY AND DO UR GREAT RIPS IN SIMILAR SIZES TOO.

thanks again. "
