The Castle of Cagliostro (ãƒ«ãƒ‘ãƒ³ä¸‰ä¸– ã‚«ãƒªã‚ªã‚¹ãƒˆãƒ­ã®åŸŽ,  Rupan Sansei: Kariosutoro no Shiro?, Lupin the Third: Castle of Cagliostro) is a 1979 Japanese animated film co-written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. It is one of the master thief Lupin III films.

The second animated Lupin III movie and arguably the most famous, Castle of Cagliostro was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki (who also co-directed the first Lupin III TV series and directed two episodes of the second) before he formed Studio Ghibli. Cagliostro features gentleman thief Lupin III, grandson to Maurice Leblanc's French literary master thief ArsÃ¨ne Lupin.





ArsÃ¨ne Lupin III and Daisuke Jigen are escaping in a Fiat 500  pursuit after robbing the casino of Monaco, only to discover that their entire haul is counterfeit. When Lupin was just getting started as a professional thief, he was almost killed while searching for the source of these so-called goat bills. He decides that it is time to take another chance, and Lupin, with Jigen, heads off to the purported source of the bills, the Principality  of Cagliostro.

Shortly after arriving, they rescue a young girl from a car full of thugs, only to let her get captured again when Lupin is knocked unconscious after tumbling down a cliff. They later discover that she is Clarisse, princess of Cagliostro and is engaged to be married to the Count, the country's ruler. The count wants to recover the ancient treasure of the Cagliostro family, and needs the princess's ring to do so.

Realizing he will need more help after he is attacked by a group of the count's elite assassins, Lupin calls on Goemon Ishikawa XIII and tips off longtime foe Inspector Koichi Zenigata to his whereabouts. He also find his former lover, Fujiko Mine, posing as Clarisse's lady-in-waiting. Using a party and Zenigata as a distraction, Lupin makes his way to the tower where Clarisse is kept, returns her ring, and promises to help her to escape. The count arrives shortly thereafter with his assassins; Lupin is dropped down a trapdoor into the bowels of the castle.

The ring turns out to be a practical joke left by Lupin. Infuriated, the Count flushes him deeper into the cellars, which are full of bodies of spies who attempted to learn the secrets of Cagliostro and the goat bills. While down there, Lupin bumps into Inspector Zenigata, who was accidentally thrown down earlier. The two reluctantly form a pact to help escape. Using two aqualungs dropped by elite soldiers, the pair escape.
