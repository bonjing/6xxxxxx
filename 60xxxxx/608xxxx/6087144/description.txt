HQ rare promo music video. "Turn to Stone" is a 1977 song by Electric Light Orchestra.

This song is the opening track to the double album Out of the Blue. It was the first song released as a single from the LP. The single reached #18 in the U.K. charts and stayed there for 12 weeks. Out of four singles from the album, "Turn to Stone" was the only song not to reach the top ten in the U.K. singles charts. The song was more successful across the Atlantic, reaching #13 in the U.S and hitting the top spot in Canada in early-1978.

This song was composed in Switzerland during Jeff Lynne's two week writing marathon for his double album. Lynne played the moog bassline of the song.

Jeff Lynne wrote the entire album in three and a half weeks after a sudden burst of creativity while hidden away in his rented chalet in the Swiss Alps. It took a further two months to record in Munich. The album had 4,000,000 pre-ordered copies and quickly went multi-Platinum upon release. Out of the Blue spawned five hit singles in different countries, and was ELO's most commercially successful studio album. It was also the first double album in the history of the UK music charts to generate four top twenty hit singles.

On November 4, 2008, Jeff Lynne was awarded a BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc) Million-Air certificates for "Turn To Stone" for having one million airplays.
