      Farmer Jimmy Doherty reveals the secrets of supermarket
      food. Jimmy creates his own kids' party menu. When it comes to
      making fish fingers, a power saw is Jimmy's choice as he works
      out how the food factories try to make frozen fish taste as good
      as fresh. Jimmy also makes pink, fluffy marshmallows. But
      there's nothing very pink or fluffy about the ingredients which
      include pig skin and trotters. He also visits a factory where
      they produce fifteen thousand mini rolls an hour to discover how
      they roll them all without cracks. Jimmy meets a raspberry
      grower who wants to reduce the amount of pesticide he uses to
      protect his delicate crop from bugs. So what's a huge hair dryer
      got to do with it?
