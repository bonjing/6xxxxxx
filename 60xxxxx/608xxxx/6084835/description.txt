Easy Rider 
Motion Picture Soundtrack (2000)

Easy Rider is the soundtrack to the cult classic 1969 film Easy Rider, a film often remembered for its epic late 1960s rock music. The album was released by ABC-Dunhill Records in August 1969 and was a strong success along with the film, peaking at #6 on the Billboard album chart in September of that year.The songs on the soundtrack album are sequenced in the same order as they appear in the film, with the following differences: "The Weight," as originally recorded by The Band for their 1968 debut album Music From Big Pink, was used in the film but could not be licensed for the soundtrack. To deal with this, ABC-Dunhill commissioned Smith, who recorded for the label at the time, to record a cover version of the song for the soundtrack album. Two songs used in the film, Little Eva's "Let's Turkey Trot" and The Electric Flag's "Flash, Bam, Pow," were omitted from the soundtrack album.
