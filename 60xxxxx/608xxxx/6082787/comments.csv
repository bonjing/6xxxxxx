,bezerkst,2011-01-18T18:40Z,"Very good movie in artistic sense, but not a very 'fun' movie to watch. 
Quality of the rip is good, but it's a documentary so the camera's used are pretty bad.

,StanleyTheManly,2011-11-13T14:05Z,"As always, FXG_team with another excellent upload.  Thank you so much for the work you do.   

The movie itself was actually very good.  I think you're either going to really like it for what it is, or hate it.  I'm not going to go into whether it's fake or not, but I will say that it was very entertaining and crazy to watch.
