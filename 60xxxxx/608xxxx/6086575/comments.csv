,georgeorgio,2011-01-07T07:38Z,are you going to put up asot 489?
,Spinx3r,2011-01-07T09:15Z,Thank You!
,xwoz,2011-01-07T12:54Z,Definitely hoping you bring your quality to asot 489 year end 2010. The other ones out there just don't match your quality. Thanks - as always! Keep up the great work!
[V],IndexTrance,2011-01-07T14:05Z,Don't do these Yearmixes of ASOT since it 88 tracks in a two hour show.. But I will do it anyway since alot of people have requested this now.. Instead of 88 individual tracks i will do alot of Acapells instead.. You'll notice.. I have time for this tomorrow so Saturday Evening/Night it will be up! Take Care!
,georgeorgio,2011-01-07T19:07Z,thanks boss... looking forward to it!! :)
,bluehen,2011-01-07T21:20Z,"I just wanna say man, thank you so much for posting all of your mixes and splitting them (Armin, Ferry, Markus, Tiesto, Tyas, etc etc).  I'm a DJ, and you are my number one source for finding the hottest tracks to buy and spin.  I am eternally grateful bro."
