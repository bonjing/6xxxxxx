Hello LFS Racers!

We are very pleased with the reaction to the S and T patches. The improved physics and BMW Sauber car have proved to be very popular. 

Community testing showed up a few issues to resolve. One week later, we now present version U, which has a lot of improvements and fixes, which you can read about here : Patch U forum thread
