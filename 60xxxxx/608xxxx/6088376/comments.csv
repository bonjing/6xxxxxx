A/10
V/10
Best BD copy I've seen for a while, sharpness and colour are perfect, with Proper 5:1 audio. This is more like a 480p BRRip, really Good copy especially if your putting this to disc...
Excellent movie as well and well worth the download...
Many Thanx to raymondhome and CM8 for the perfect rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"
