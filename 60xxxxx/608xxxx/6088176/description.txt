Microsoft Forefront Endpoint Protection 2010.

The Convergence of Desktop Security and Management! Desktop management and security have traditionally existed as two separate disciplines. Yet both play a central role in keeping users safe and productive. Management ensures proper system configuration, deploys patches against vulnerabilities, and delivers necessary security updates. Security provides critical threat detection, outbreak response, and system remediation.

Forefront Endpoint Protection 2010 enables businesses to align security and management to improve endpoint protection while greatly reducing operational costs. It builds on System Center Configuration Manager 2007 R2 and R3, allowing customers to use their existing client management infrastructure to deploy and manage endpoint protection. This shared infrastructure helps reduce ownership costs while providing improved visibility and control over endpoint management and security.
