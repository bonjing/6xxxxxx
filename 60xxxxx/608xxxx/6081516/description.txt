Here is, IMHO, the better of the two videos i did. It's a little brighter, but i think it watches better than the Xvid version of mine. And it's only 1.73Gb vs 2.45Gb (Xvid). Enjoy
------------------------------
FIRST AND FOREMOST: THANK YOU TO ALL THE RELEASE GROUPS THAT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ADVANCED COPIES OF MOVIES FOR US TO ENJOY! THANKS TO KINGDOM RELEASE,MYSTiC,IMAGiNE,ELEKTRI4KA,NoRar,WBZ,MAXSPEED,Noir,SecretMyth AND ALL OTHERS PAST AND PRESENT.

I looked everywhere I could. I scoured the Net, searching high and low, day and night, looking for the absolute best copy of this film that I could. Not being part of any ACTUAL SCENE group I could not get ahold of MASTER copies ( or better copies) that are Undoubtably out there. I found that the MYSTiC .mp4 version gave the best video to start with. It had the best look to it overall except for being to bright. The audio wasn't the greatest ( IMAGiNE's being the best) but I could not, for some reason, splice another audio source. Since this was already synced I decided to keep it.
