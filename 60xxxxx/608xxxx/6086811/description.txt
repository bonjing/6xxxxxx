This is the COMPLETE Sims 3 Store items listing as of January 2011. All files have been put into .package form by set, so no need to deal with the horrid installer!

If you aren't sure how to install a .package file for the Sims 3, please check out the tutorial on Mod the Sims via the link provided.

If you downloaded last months torrent that I posted I have changed the format, grouping files by month or neighborhood for my own records. It's recommended that you remove last months files and use only this months files for best game performance.

Please don't just leech, seed for a while after you download!


If you want to help this torrent seed faster, simply move the following files from December into this folder. If the file is not on this list, then it has been changed.
