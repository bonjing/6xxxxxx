A new year can only mean one thing â€” a new and improved you. Dr. Philâ€™s guests say it's their loved ones who are the ones who need changing. It's been 10 years since Marcia has been on a date, and her daughter says itâ€™s time for her mom to get back in the game. Will a surprise intervention by comedian Steve Harvey get this mother to stop sabotaging herself? Then, Alison's husband says she has baby weight to shed, so why is Dr. Phil delivering the strong message to him and not her? And, Natasha says it's time for ultimatums with her boyfriend and self-professed player, Shawn. Will he finally commit to her? Plus, learn what the new year has in store for Oprah and her brand-new network, OWN!
