In December 1967 a Cuban film crew led by Santiago Alvarez the veteran polemicist travelled to Hanoi. They shot the footage which constitutes this short documentary all in one day - Tuesday 13. The film is the story of that day, and what happened to the North Vietnamese people in the course of it.

Colour is used only in the introductory section on the history of Vietnam, and how the almond-eyed Vietnamese have always been willing to sacrifice their blood to repel invaders. The Chinese, the Cambodians, the Siamese, the French - all have tried to conquer Vietnam and all have been repulsed.

Then we move to black and white for a satirical biography of Lyndon Johnson. A caption tells us of Johnson's birth in 1908, and in a sequence of rapid cuts we are shown archive film of various animals energing from wombs, interspersed with volcanos spewing out magma. Johnson becomes president and the film concentrates on the anti-war protests which dogged his public appearances. His limousine and security men are splashed with paint, and students are manhandled by police. Still photos of Johnson are presented in a satirical montage, aiming to make Johnson look weary and disheartened.

The bulk of the documentary is wordless, allowing the images to speak for themselves. It is accompanied by a truly marvellous musical score.
