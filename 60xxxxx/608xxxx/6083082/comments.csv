[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-05T05:05Z,This has got all 5 seasons from a DVDRip in HD + lots of extra bonus features. Please seed for as long as possible.
,8th_wonder,2011-01-10T06:48Z,"come one people its the wire, one of the hardest shows to find online, even streaming....SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,joaquin87,2011-01-15T15:45Z,"sorry, this is no good quality v6/A8"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-15T16:14Z,All episodes were carefully chosen because they were the highest quality available. I personally checked every episode and the audio and video are perfect.
[V],manOtor,2011-01-16T21:52Z,"The quality is quite good, I'd say:

A 7/10
V 8/10

It is watchable on regular screens, but maybe not on your 60 inch Flat SuperDuper-TV ;)...

It's in 4:3 (512x384), but I don't think ""The Wire"" exists in 16:9 - at least there is nothing available in that format on the net :(.
From your presentation I actually thought you did the ripping yourself, maybe you should consider crediting the original suppliers, even though you wrapped it into a neet package!
Thank you for your efforts of collecting anyway,
I can relate as I like the packs better, too.

Cheers"
,CD12,2011-01-20T05:45Z,"The Wire was only shot in 4:3,480i SDTV. "
,sirbas,2011-01-20T15:38Z,"He I have a question,

I know that you need to upload the part to download faster but, down and upl ar so low and whats the best setting to let it go faster? 

thanx"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-20T16:53Z,"Under preferences, make sure you're connected to at least 100 peers (mine is 200), make sure you're upload rate is at least 25 Kb/s. Google Utorrent settings and you'll see websites with photos of the screen so you can see exactly how to set it up."
,sirbas,2011-01-20T22:44Z,is Utorrent better then bittorrent?
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-21T02:47Z,"In my opinion, yes. You can use to automatically download your favourite shows too. Everybody should use Utorrent in my opinion."
,sirbas,2011-01-21T14:23Z,"allrtight, thanx 4 the info "
,nyasas,2011-02-03T14:36Z,"Hi...I just wanted to thank you to everyone who made this possilbe.  I really appreciate it.  Also a thank you from my brother...he asked me to see if I could find The Wire for him...he's on his way overseas to Afganistan for the fourth time and although he does recon and sits in the desert for weeks on end I think he and the guys can watch this on computers or whatever device they have...so a big thank you from him too.  I've been downloading for 24 hours now and am at 24 % which is ok since its the whole box set, Right?....again thank you Snifffer_V and everyone else for seeding!!!"
,essstar,2011-02-06T22:45Z,"Thanks for the upload but please seeeeeeeeeeed, people."
,dizzy_legz,2011-02-09T04:03Z,PEOPLE PLEASE KEEP ON SEEDING!! IT TAKE SOOOOO LONG!!
,GodAmongSaints,2011-02-15T20:51Z,40% in about twelve hours. Not bad for something this size. Big ups to all the seeders out there. 
,c3bhm,2011-02-23T09:38Z,"Someone please upload ""Brick City"".  It's a Sundance channel documentary show with similar themes/issues to The Wire."
,Lisam2111,2011-03-04T17:04Z,Hi I am new to this. Could someone please tell me what it is to Seed and how to do it. It seems to be something good to do if you use this site in the commmunity spirit...
,Jark09,2011-03-04T20:19Z,I only downloaded the first season but now I don't have any audio. Can someone help me pls
,Jark09,2011-03-04T22:01Z,nevermind I found it. I needed to download an audio codec (ac3filter or something)
,Poglodyte,2011-03-27T16:32Z,"to seed just means to continue uploading once you have the entire torrent, and yes, it's a very good thing to do ;)  it's the only way for a torrent to survive.  if no one else did it, you wouldn't have been able to download it in the first place.  

in order to seed, just make sure the torrent continues to run after you have 100% of it.  you can either force it to run until you decide to stop it, or set it to run for an amount of time or download/upload ratio.  definitely make sure you give what you take at the very minimum which would mean a ratio of 1"
,vivatpb5776,2011-04-03T13:23Z,"Quality is okay, full screen and pixelated

Video: 7/10
Audio: 9/10

As stated, this is full screen but unless someone is going to take the time to convert all of these episodes to wide screen, this is about as good as we are gonna get.

That being said, I have this full series already. I was hoping the quality of this .torrent was better than my version...not so much. The only difference I noticed was in Season 5. It appears that each episode in this season is doubled the size of what I have without increasing the quality of the file. The resolution is the same, the length of time is the same, and they are both full screen.

All that being said, thank you uploader for seeding this."
,rob1408,2011-04-16T15:14Z,"The Wire was made in standard definition and in less than perfect quality intentionally.  It's supposed to look gritty and wore out, something that will become more apparent on huge HD TVs.

As for the torrent, many, many thanks.  I've only seen The Wire the once and the box set is ĂÂŁ60, something I can't justify paying with mouths to feed.  A superb torrent which I (and hopefully others) will seed.

Much appreciated."
,mvhrzg,2011-04-19T02:15Z,"SEEDS, PLEASE! Been downloading for over 4 days now!"
,phil0s,2011-04-24T03:42Z,thank you!
,AkHolic,2011-04-28T13:28Z,"Big thanks to uploader for this. My question is, is this safe to download? I heard HBO is keeping a close eye on torrents of their shows and that you recieve a letter of warning from your ISP if you download their shows"
,ljr11,2011-05-05T16:41Z,how do i download this wen i try it just says pending??
,andresparra,2011-05-17T22:36Z,"Brilliant Torrent, decent speed and great quality!

A-10, V-10 for a show in 4:3.

I'll seed for a month at least! fuck my private trackers, i'll be prioritizing this one. People need to see this show! I love The Sopranos but this is my favorite HBO show.

Thanks to the uploader"
,Jeppe256,2011-06-14T17:00Z,Does it include subtitles for each episode?
,algieba78,2011-06-17T21:45Z,"Excellent torrent, and the series deserves to be praised as the best tv series ever made.
I watched it from this torrent from beginning to end without the slightest problem
Image quality is good considering it is from a 4:3 standard definition source.
However bear in mind that there are no subs included in this torrent. I got some from specialized sites, however the ones I found for season 3 and later needed to be resynced each time. Easy to do in bsplayer (that's what i'm using), but a hassle nonetheless.
 And, unless you are a native speaker of (Balmore) English, you NEED subs to get everything."
,pollenhead,2011-06-23T17:18Z,"this be 
V 8/10
A 7/10
which is good enuff,ya heard !!
stop complaining damm it"
,listigt,2011-06-24T17:03Z,This is great besides the fact that there are no subs. The Baltimore gangbangers can be near impossible to understand from time to time. Try to find subs for it or download something else and save your time.
,dellard14,2011-06-28T12:18Z,Haven't found a release like this even on private trackers. Will download and seed :)
,pollenhead,2011-07-02T16:19Z,"this torrent is unstable,low ass speeds.yet everything else i dl from pb is fast !!"

,aiqtidar,2011-11-08T05:49Z,"So I've got to ask, what's the deal with the speeds I'm getting on this torrent? I'm connected to a good number of seeds and peers, I've got no limits on download or upload speeds, but somehow I'm still getting incredibly low speeds (much lower than for anything else I download from here). What gives? "
,TheSyPhER,2011-11-18T08:03Z,"First off, not DVD quality. I know the show is supposed to look gritty but this is pretty much the same as the other torrents laying around. Saying this is DVD quality is VERY misleading. 
Second, to all those asking about their download speed, listen up. Just because your torrent says it is going to take six months or a year doesn't mean anything. Let it sit for 2-4 weeks and if it isn't at least halfway done, then perhaps consider asking if someone could be kind enough to seed. 
Thirdly, remember, this is not todays episode of Big Bang Theory or Glee or whatnot. It will not download in the same manner. Helping to seed, even after you have finished downloading, is key to everyone being able to have what they want."
,searogue,2011-12-05T19:41Z,"I got everything downloaded and the files look OK, but for some reason, the only episodes I can open are for Season 1.  The other seasons don't seem to work.  Is there something different about the other seasons?  (I'm using VLC media player 1.1.7)"
,forcrp,2012-01-17T08:36Z,Thanks for the great upload! It's got everything. AND matching subs for this upload are also available on the Bay. Already seeded to 1 but will keep at it at least until ratio's 2 or 3. Cheers!
,sudamander,2012-01-25T18:50Z,Is anybody experiencing this problem where when you start this torrent your computer gets a blue screen? it's happened to me 5 in a row but it isn't happening with other torrents... anyone had this happen to them?

,Svaneper,2012-02-14T21:40Z,"for those who believes in estimated time left;
its very incorrect, its like trusting microsoft to produce a good operativsystems or following the so called ""windows minutes"" which has it name of a reason, like if you copy a file on 700Mb from c: -> d: it might say 60 minutes, then suddenly 1 month, dont trust it, estimate the time manually instead ! :) thanks great upload"
,popeye013,2012-02-28T00:24Z,"I love how people write bollocks on ther torrent they upload about what they claim they are, but what the torrent really is, is another matter!!
HD is widescreen, if its not the full width of the screen, then it doesn't fall under the correct terms of High Definition, no matter what some bellend with a laptop would like you to think!! 

Its 4:3, not 16:9, so it is NOT HD, never produced in widescreen HD, so be truthful, it counts in the end.

,trejedy2,2012-05-12T00:34Z,"@arigold, figure it out, man, shit. You click the magnet, it opens in your torrent program. A couple of minutes and it gives you a list of files. Select the ones you don't want, right click, choose ""priority"" in bt or ut, select do not download. Or just select the ones and click the Stop button. Don't bitch about things if you don't know basic steps.

Thanks for the up."
