X264, but at least you don't have to spend an hour trying to get the subtitles timed.

Wish FXG  would go back to leaving subtitles.

syncif, if you know of subtitles that are timed to a given movie, you should provide a link to that specific sub file, so others don't have to try and find the right one by trial and error.  If you're just saying that subtitles to some movies are available at subscene, most of us know that."

Wish FXG would go back to including subtitles.  It's THE reason I go to FXG first.

syncif:  If you know of a subtitle that is synced to a movie, you should post a link to that specific file.  The reason for downloading the subs with the movie is to avoid the sometimes impossible task of finding a subtitle that can be made to sync with a given rip."
