Drummer Jeff "Tain" Watts leads his quintet plus guest altoist Kenny Garrett
through extended versions of four of his originals (all of which he had recorded
previously in the studio) plus BjÃ¶rk's "107 Steps." While "107 Steps" and "JC Is
the Man" (which is more Thelonious Monk than John Coltrane) are fine, it is not
until Garrett makes his first appearance on "Mr. JJ" (which is more Coltrane
than J.J. Johnson) that this set really explodes. Garrett's passion inspires
Watts during their midsong duet and adds a great deal of energy during the three
songs on which he appears, completely stealing the show. Watts takes a surprise
vocal on "Like the Rose" and plays with intensity throughout the performance,
but it is Kenny Garrett who makes the music something special; it is a pity that
he is not on the first two numbers.
