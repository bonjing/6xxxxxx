,TheRekcah,2011-01-28T03:48Z,"McAfee found a Trojan in the main exe file, not the crack. I don't know if programs like this do that normally or not, just letting all downloaders know."
,mandipdas,2011-01-31T12:15Z,"I am using this product for 2 years now and this not my made. All credits goes to Twisted EndZ. They are the release group. Trust me, it's okay to use... :)"
,user087,2011-02-06T14:21Z,Dont download these kind of suspicious files.
,Tibby12,2011-03-25T03:36Z,Runs perfect on Win7. Avira Prem.SecSuite did not detect anything (during install) that should not be there. It's clean and perfect; Thank You

McAfee has deleted program exe due to trojan."
,rfanterst,2011-05-08T12:06Z,"You can download bwmonitor trial from the official site, then just copy the files in the crack folder, run the .reg, and voila. No need to keep the supposedly infected contents."

,PaPaNuGz,2011-08-10T19:52Z,"guy pretty much all antivirus software will report anything with strange coding eg. serial gens, cracks ect. so dont worry its probably not a trojan i dont even use AV it just gets in the way... just be aware of where your exploring and what you'er downloading..."
