In his award-winning debut feature film, director Ahmet Ulucay portrays the innocence of childhood and the lure of the cinema for two teens in a small Turkish village. Working for a watermelon seller by day, Remet spends his evenings trying to rebuild a film projector with his friend Mehmet. Both have big dreams to be famous film directors one day.

Ulucay borrows from his own life story to weave this charming tribute to the magic of the movies. At turn heartbreaking and heartwarming, BOATS OUT OF WATERMELON RINDS evokes an acute sense of time and place, while at the same time conveying universal themes of first love, big dreams, and the allure that movies have for all of us.
