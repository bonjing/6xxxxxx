IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Homemade ............... Thanks nos1
AUDIO: OWN

Ok to clear up the readnfo part... we used this tag because we had to add 3mins 23secs of video off our cam release due to focus issues on this video. Right, this time round we have good line audio and also a new video source :) Now the video is cropped around the bottom and sides but not quite as much as the other cam video. Also this one has alot better picture Q then the one before. Audio... brand new line and pretty decent. We just had to sync it to our encode. Overall not too bad for a TS, some auto focus issues here and there but still watchable. Enjoy folks

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
