,SoWErA,2011-01-09T01:12Z,"previous uploads that I have viewed have been a lot lesser resolution then yours and they have been unable to cap better resolution.

Anyway thanks for being able to cap a 1080i source :)"

This format is EXCELLENT and has the best and highest of resolutions I have ever had with DAYS!!
Being in Australia, we are many years behind so I look forward to the torrents available online - there isnt very many on DAYS, so I am very greatful for what is available. YOURS on the otherhand are a real treat! HDTV DAYS!

Please please please continue to make this format available! 

All previous viewed have been much lesser in resolution and yours are crystal clearer in comparison!

THANK YOU - KEEP IT UP! :)"

I personally would be forever greatful.
Send them my thanks."
