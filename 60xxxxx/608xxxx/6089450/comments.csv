I thought this was the last episode. But a quick look on tv.com says that there are two more episodes to come. Goldfield, NV and Bonnie Springs Ranch. Maybe there is one more after that, they don't always show all future episodes. Either way it's the longest season for GA which is good.

Thanks for your great work!"
