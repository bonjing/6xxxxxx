Renowned for his lyrical old-time blues harmonica playing, Damian Coen has emerged as a roots and blues singer with a story to tell. A devotee of early country blues sounds, Damian became integral to Australia's acoustic blues and roots scene in the mid 1980s, when he founded the now-fabled jug band, The Mudsteppers. Coen's lyrical vocal and harmonica lines are soaked in swampy rhythms, gospel harmonies, and old-time charm.
