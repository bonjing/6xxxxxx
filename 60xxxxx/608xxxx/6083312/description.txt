    In the second of three live programmes, Professor Brian    
    Cox and Dara O Briain look at images of the partial       
    eclipse of the sun and investigate how stars are born.   
                                                              
    Liz Bonnin shows us the sun in a different light - live    
    from Hawaii; while novice star spotter Jonathan Ross      
    discovers the key to observing constellations. Plus      
    astronomer Mark Thompson demonstrates how to find our     
    nearest galaxy, Andromeda.
