,TheManFromTheOutlaws,2011-01-07T18:52Z,HDR Efex Pro doesen`t work without serial number!!!
[T],chuckie6,2011-01-07T19:37Z,"Try this - has worked for some

HDR effex works if you press CANCEL on the registration prompt. No SN needed!"
,LiaFlia,2011-01-08T05:10Z,Just to make sure.....I shouldn't be concerned about HDR Efex saying that my trial is 15 days?
,TheManFromTheOutlaws,2011-01-08T23:20Z,"Chuckie6, how to press cancel on registration promt. No cancel button."
,illuminatiX,2011-01-08T23:28Z,How to install? Thanx anyone!
[T],chuckie6,2011-01-09T07:45Z,"@illuminatiX

Go to the Nik site, then downloads/ user guides/ installation"
[T],chuckie6,2011-01-09T07:51Z,"At the moment I do not have a machine to try this program out.
I have uploaded HDRcrack which is for HDR Efex only.
It contains a serial generator and an independent serial number. Am not in a position to test, and any comments on whether either work please leave here."

,kjell123agd,2011-01-09T17:37Z,"The X-Force Viveza 2 serial generator requires a Installation ID number.

There's nothing in either of the two RTF's indicating what this number should be.

Where is this number found?"
[T],chuckie6,2011-01-09T19:20Z,"@kjell123agd

Not sure of the problem as I am unable to run any of this stuff at present to check what is included in the dmg's

Try adding 077432827550 to the X force generator as the installation ID."
,LiaFlia,2011-01-09T22:46Z,I too need the installation ID number in order to get the serial number for Viveza 2.  Has anyone been successful with this? 
,TheManFromTheOutlaws,2011-01-10T10:45Z,"Many thanks chuckie6, all plug-ins works very well!"
,TheManFromTheOutlaws,2011-01-10T10:48Z,"LiaFlia, You get the ID number of you click on activate by phone. type the ID number in the key generator and then you generate the nessery key for activation of Viveza 2.

Good Luck!"
,TheManFromTheOutlaws,2011-01-10T10:53Z,"Use this HDR crack for HDR Efex Pro, works fine!

,LiaFlia,2011-01-10T17:09Z,TheManFromTheOutlaws...THANK YOU! I would've never figured that out.
,ocfunguy,2011-01-15T20:48Z,"Works GREAT! to activate Viveza you need to go to activate by phone to get the installation #, leave out the hyphens & it works perfect"
,kgvg988,2011-01-31T19:04Z,"I have been looking for viveza for months now - this works perfectly (activate by phone, insert installation ID into generator and hey presto!!).  Absolute genius chuckie6."
,maracan,2011-02-04T02:49Z,"Great job, Chuckie6!  FYI for everyone: all plugins downloaded from Nik's website, with the exception of HDR Efex which I have yet to try.  The Viveza key generator worked like a charm.  Long live TPB!"
,maracan,2011-02-27T00:38Z,Any chance to get the new version 2.0 of Silver Efex?  Thanks!
,ikkenostress,2011-03-20T17:41Z,TheManFromTheOutlaws!! is it not there anymore..Need the crack
,dirtydingo,2011-03-25T12:52Z,chuckie6! Got this for windows?
,david1688,2011-04-02T22:24Z,anybody got this for Windows??
,writersbloc,2011-04-25T02:12Z,Installed ColorEfexPro3 only- crash Photoshop CS5 every time I try to run the plug-in. 
,aniaskup,2011-06-30T05:01Z,"Ive downloaded and used the little keygen thinggy for Viveza, which worked perfect, HDR Efex asks for the same activation code, serial number etc... but I cant get it to work.  
Also all the others I cant get to work either.  It has the demo rego that pops up, but what is the product key for this? or how do i find it?"
,uwaisiar,2011-07-04T11:19Z,"hi
when i install the plugins, photoshop doesnt show up as a compatible host, infact nothing shows up. only for hdrefex it located Bridge and gave me the option to locate Photoshop, for viveza i copied over the plugin file from its ""package contents"". but the other plugins dont have the plugin file in their contents, can anyone share some light please? im running mac os x 10.6.7 and have the adobe cs5 suite, much thanks"
,cajingurl,2011-07-05T18:41Z,"I've installed Viveza and tried the kegen, but I keep getting Error occurred   Error Code (-2)  Any ideas?"
,FlawedOne,2012-01-15T13:43Z,"Thanks Chuckie6 - all installed good!
People: you must actually click on the 'activate by phone' to get the installation ID. Pop that number into the keygen - viola!!"
