This torrent contains the Tortoise 12-inch of remixes by Derrick Carter.  Both remixes are of the track "In Sarah, Menken, Christ, and Beethoven There Were Women and Men," from the TNT album.  I transferred the tracks from vinyl into Pro Tools, bounced the tracks down to .wav, and then created the mp3's from the .wav files.  Sorry, I originally created 128 kbps mp3's and I don't have access to the .wav files at the moment to create a higher quality rip.  If anyone is interested in a higher bitrate version, leave a comment and I'll try to upload a better rip later when I get access to the .wav.
