[T],nobody2007,2011-01-06T23:19Z,"iWork '09 from Release Date.........: August 26th, 2010 ???

I mean that this one was released in Jan. 2009

Otherwise on thepiratebay are tons of this suite. Why do you create new torrents? Use the search button before posting."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-07T00:30Z,"Yeah the 9.0 version was in Jan, 2010 
But it was another update of 9.0, so i wrote Aug 2010

Source here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWork 

""Use search"" No shit dude... 
Many of those torrents don't work, anthow i upload everything even if it's allready uploaded."

There is an update thought available, iWork update 5, 9.05 version. Should we update to it, or there might be any probles with the lisence then?"

,Focus88,2011-05-30T19:33Z,"Me again. No worries, it will install itself on your own language. Thanks!

Note: the program is confusing for me. I would never pay for it. Open Office is more easy to understand >_"
,krazyyaj,2011-06-10T00:42Z,"thanks for the upload.

works perfectly. no key required.

however there's one problem.
not sure if you stated it or if its just me.

i can't load microsoft files on iwork.

i know that iwork is compatible with reading .doc and .docx files. its worked when i was using a trial.

is it disabled for your version of iwork?
or is it just my mac that's having issues?

please respond asap. thank you."
