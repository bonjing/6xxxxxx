RIGHT STUFF
[RSCD-0012] 2010
MP3 V0
Electro House, Progressive Trance, Tech-Dance

Released for Comiket 79, this release is, as expected, another top-tier album put out by RIGHT STUFF. They've done a pretty good job with this disc, especially MAYA AKAI's track "Sky Diver (Nhato Remix)" which consists of a peculiar blend between electro house and chill trance, which comes out magnificent. If you like cutting edge trance, RIGHT STUFF is the right place to be =]

Enjoy, and happy new year.
