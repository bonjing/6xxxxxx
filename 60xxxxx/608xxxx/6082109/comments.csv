when i download this game and click on the gta san andreas logo, my screen get another colour and nothing happens, But when i look on my vip mod v3 directory i see a file called cleo.asi
when i delete that or move in the folder of CLEO the game opens and it loads i see only the player for 1 sec. and my screen get back to windows and it says gta_sa.exe stopped working... everytime i get this. now i want a solution for this . or what are the minimum system requirements for this ? cause the normal gta opens fine and the gta sa turbo xd mod also but only this one don't open any1 a solution or help?"
