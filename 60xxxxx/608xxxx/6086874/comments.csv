,Rohndogg1,2011-02-18T01:07Z,This is NOT new. This series started in 1999 and ended in 2001. They are just re-airing it.
,cartman19987,2011-05-06T22:29Z,Thank you. I'll seed indefinitely.
,cartman19987,2011-05-07T14:42Z,"@Rohndogg1, I have that series you're speaking of, and this isn't it. I assume these are brand-new comics."
