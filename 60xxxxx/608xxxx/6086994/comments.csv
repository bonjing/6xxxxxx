@ ynkhmer: No,.. not with this version, but according to the developers website (http://www.interactionstudios.com/chickeninvaders4.php) it should have 3 Multiplayer modes: play on the same computer, over your LAN, or on the internet. I guess it depends on where you buy the game (this is the GameHouse version)."
