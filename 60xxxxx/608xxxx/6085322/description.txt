Top Gear Specials December 21st 2010 USA Road Trip

May in a ferrari 458, Jeremy in a Mercedes SLS and Richard in a Porsche GT3 RS.

The first of our two Christmas shows contains a monster three-part US road trip that starts with Americaâ€™s greatest driving road and ends with a race through New York, taking in a track day, a (mostly) comprehensible NASCAR history lesson, and a small selection of handguns along the way. Chuck in a lively canter through some Christmas gift ideas and ace film director Danny Boyle as the star in the Reasonably Priced Car and youâ€™ve got a mighty fine way to take your mind off all those news stories about TRAVEL CHAOS and endless bloody songs with sleigh bells in them.
