,CainUAC23,2011-01-10T17:04Z,"i'm trying to download your torrent but here it says 1 seed, uTorrent says ""0 of 4 connected 1 in swarm""

Maybe i missed something, but how did i get up to 7.4% with no connected Seeds?  I know for a fact that during the whole download it never once connected to a Seed, only Peers."
,CainUAC23,2011-01-10T17:05Z,"idk how i managed to get 7.4% with no Seeds, but i got there and in 3 years it will finish.  TPB says this has 1 seed, uTorrent says 4, but doesn't connect."
,CainUAC23,2011-01-10T17:07Z,"and it would seem that TPB is having Comment posting issues.  used to pop the comment right away, and now i'm posting another post before the first posts.  Hmm, oh well, idk how to edit, or delete the posts, but any help on this Seed problem is greatly appreciated."

,jasonbourne0310,2011-01-31T03:12Z,"its not dead... 
but the file is named s16e01, which it isnt.
Usa road trip & 3 wise men episodes are special episodes only..
S16 is just like other episodes with review of skoda yeti n all..
anyway thanks uploader. :)"
