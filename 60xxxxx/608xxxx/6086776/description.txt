This is an audience recording. The picture is not too good (hard to make out facial expressions as the concert lights shine too bright on Meat Loaf) and occasionally  the video goes black because the camera is blocked by the head of a fan in front of the cameraman. 
The audio is good but low. And the concert is complete! With a great set list and Meat Loaf has a great voice here. That makes it a very enjoyable show! Besides that it's a very rare show! So enjoy!
