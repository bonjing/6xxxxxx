,scottsasse,2011-01-07T01:32Z,THANKS for sharing!! I've been wanting a program like this. And THANKS to all who help SEED!!
,Distagon76,2011-01-07T17:54Z,I wonder is it safe to use such a black box like this cracked dll? Won't it send my private info somewhere?..
,eXoflow,2011-01-08T18:48Z,"@Distagon76

I use it, and none of my accounts have been hacked..."
[T],Ametz,2011-01-09T14:39Z,We need roboform2go too (portable version)
,3008,2011-01-16T12:40Z,"When using the Cracked DLL file can not change language
 it is only engelst which is accessible no matter what you choose!!
 Why?"
,eXoflow,2011-01-16T14:47Z,"@3008

I can change language perfectly fine in Options."
,slrosado,2011-01-25T04:14Z,"OMG it worked!!!  I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate and followed your instructions and it works. :) Neither IOBit Security or Spyware Doctor found any virus.

Thanks so much eXoflow!"
,cmqjan,2011-01-26T22:31Z,I LOVE ROBOFORM and can't live without it.  This is a legitimate torrent. Easy to use. Thank you very much!  I am still seeding....
,scouser747,2011-02-16T23:17Z,"Download worked - installed ok, but when I log into any site ie hotmail, roboform does not prompt to save the login details - hence I can't create any passcards - is there a reason for this? Maybe a setting on my browser needs changing? (I'm using Firefox.) Any suggestions?"
,eXoflow,2011-02-23T21:46Z,"Wierd, have you installed the Firefox plugin needed?"
,Rick98382,2011-02-26T20:35Z,Worked as advertised.. thanks!
,vinnylima,2011-04-02T20:40Z,"I was having the same problem as scouser747: RoboForm wouldn't ask me to save passwords, as the toolbar was not showing properly (and the application itself was not working).
For it to work properly on Firefox, UNCHECK the option to install the browser plugin in the setup. It works without the installation of any add-on"
,Mr-i,2012-04-01T04:08Z,"no icon shown on firefox.. :(
