,aitrex,2011-02-21T01:24Z,Any chance of someone uploading the US version of the original cool school disc? These ISO's seem to be for US version only and won't install on UK version. Thanks.

Like Cyber1982, I've also been looking for the newer discs, which don't seem to be available anywhere except for a few 2nd-hand sellers on ebay, amazon, etc., who are charging > $100 USD for the discs, taking blatant advantage of consumers who bought the hardware, especially given the manufacturer's lack of support for their own product.  I'd appreciate any leads on a downloadable or more affordable distribution.

Thanks again!"
