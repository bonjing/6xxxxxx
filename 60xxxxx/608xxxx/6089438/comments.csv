,veitikka72,2011-01-09T00:01Z,"Audio 6 sounds like someone is holding microphone in their armpit, with leatherjacket on. And he giggles like a schoolgirl, or maybe is one. video good"
,blandrys,2011-01-11T10:47Z,"yea, quite shitty sound on this, be warned. also the hardcoded subs are super ugly"
,solidpuma,2011-01-14T19:50Z,"very good movie. Quality is fine.
Worth downloading.
Even tho is a Finland movie, it is top quality, mature and awesome movie.

not a kid's movies"
,mizhop,2011-01-15T22:02Z,"I have to agree with those that report the audio is sub-par (A:6, or so).  I don't get that, especially since the video is pretty good.  Why use audio from a cam, when this is supposed to be a DVD rip?  *scratches head*

Anyway, definitely watchable!  A very quick DL too! Thanks for the up, and always seed back 1:1!"
[V],Horrorspoke,2011-01-17T19:33Z,"Some people commented A:9 - V:9

This was the best DVDRIP out at the time I uploaded. if i were to find a better one, then I would upload that!

BOTHERED!!!!"
,rambambula,2011-01-20T19:38Z,"Video is great, audio is average, as if it's been recorded externally ( which it probably has been since you sometimes hear someone giggle ), but if you can stand a bit of nuisance it's completely watchable."
,migu.,2011-01-25T20:08Z,Have you horrospoke ever seen DVDRip? This is shitty cam version.. lame..
,migu.,2011-01-25T20:19Z,"Shitty version cam/r5 version.. Horrorspoke, you never seen DVDRip or how do u confuse this to dvdrip.. lame.. :D"
,migu.,2011-01-25T20:20Z,oho tuli tuplat.. :D
,xtorrentaddictx,2011-01-26T05:18Z,"WARNING SOUND QUALITY IS AWFUL, LIKE FROM A CAM!!!!!!!!!!PEOPLE, WAIT FOR ANOTHER DVDRIP, THIS ONE ISNT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!

anyways, im not ungrateful so thanks for the upload horror spoke, i will seed this one till i see a better rip out there."
,siphon154,2011-02-16T01:23Z,thanks for the up
,Spiggve,2011-06-20T13:31Z,"thanks for the up, but it is NOT a dvdrip, it is a cam. V:6 A:3"
,TheSkygge,2011-07-30T22:54Z,"Looks very much like a DVDrip, are you guys up in smoke or what??

A 9
V 9

Only bad thing in this movie is that it only lasts 1h15..."
,TheSkygge,2011-07-30T22:57Z,Very funny to see that all the actors that played the elfs have swedish/norwegian names
,Chidogg,2011-08-16T03:00Z,"I'm gonna be honest I have been a dirty ""Leecher"" until a few weeks back but I have seen the error of my ways! I'm now seeding at least 2-1 and I sleep better for it! don't be a victim of the greed.........SEEED! Cheers for the up!"
,Chidogg,2011-08-16T03:03Z,There are now better versions of this but thanx for your work Horrorspoke a damn good effort sir!
,TheUltimateGayMan,2011-12-12T02:25Z,"I don't know why everyone is acting like this? Quality was fine.... Maybe not HD but, it was clear and the audio was in sync! DEFINITELY WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!"
,dkick22,2011-12-16T16:55Z,"Video is awesome, Audio is decent i dunno what you all are complaining about, subtitles work good too"
,pellonpaa,2012-03-06T16:52Z,It's true - TERRIBLE SOUND recorded on an external mike. You can hear the person recording shifting around in their seat. Video fine. Hardcoded English subs.  I'd recommend getting a different torrent.
