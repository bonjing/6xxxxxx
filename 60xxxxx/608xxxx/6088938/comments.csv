,Jbalmeo,2011-01-08T15:52Z,Hello OOO Can u upload Chuck Season 1 to 4? i really like your uploads. you holyroses and poppedtart. thank you very much.  I always go to your page :)))
,ipodctrl,2011-01-09T10:52Z,"I was hoping if you could tell me what settings you use in handbrake in converting the iPod videos that you upload. I do not intend to compete with you or upload any videos. It's just that I've already tried a lot of video converters out there and each has failed to offer the balance between quality and size. I would really appreciate it if you could help me regarding the settings. I have already asked of the same with other handheld uploaders before, but they all seem to ignore my plea of help despite being one of those users who have helped in seeding their works. You seem to acknowledge comments of other people and diligently reply to their questions, I hope that you could reply to my comment. If you don't mind, you can email me at ocean_048@yahoo.com regarding your settings. I hope that 2011 turns out great for you."
