,slapnutz,2011-01-26T15:05Z,"For those PS3 users, I was able to watch the entire movie without any Cinavia interference. PS3 safe.

Able to output AC3 surround to my amp and it played for the entire movie. No skips, mutes etc.

Thought i'd post this because I already wasted several GB grabbing a copy of RE: Afterlife which got muted nearly 40min into the movie with Cinavia protection. :-/"
