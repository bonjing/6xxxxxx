Notes: 'The Man Who Cried The Blues' - Sleepy John Estes was born near Ripley in Lauderdale County in eastern Tennessee, and lost the sight in his right eye in a boyhood accident.In his teens his family moved to Brownsville, Tennessee, where met the younger Yank Rachell and began playing music with him in the vicinity and in Memphis, where theywere talent-spotted by Victor and recorded in 1929 and`30.After a five-year break Estes returned to the studio for Decca and continued to record until 1941. He lived for for some years inMemphis, where he recorded without outcome for Sun in 1952, but on becoming completly blind returned to Brownsville. It was therethat the documentary film-maker David Blumenthal, following a tip-off from Big Joe Williams, traced him in 1961. The word was passedto Bob Koester of Delmark Records and Estes soon afterwards embraked on a second voyage in music that would take him to festivals allover the US and to Europe and the Far East.This music, capturing the bluesman at the height of his creative powers. Unlike many Delta bluesmen of his era, Estes worked with a full jug band, which gave his music a greater variety of textures. His music swings, with a loose, relaxed feel that isn't heard on many Delta blues records. Furthermore, his songs are inventive, featuring pseudo-autobiographical lyrics loaded with evocative imagery. Nearly all of his best material is included on 'I Ain't Gonna Be Worried No More', making it as close to a definitive retrospective of Estes's music as possible.
