,MovieManX,2011-03-31T02:01Z,"Subs MUST have the same name as the film.

This file should be the English subs --> Se.jie.[Lust.Caution].2007.Uncut.BRRip.H264.AAC.Gopo_EN.srt

You need to rename it --> Se.jie.[Lust.Caution].2007.Uncut.BRRip.H264.AAC.Gopo.srt

But there's already a file with that name, so change that filename slightly before you rename the English file.

This will screw up your seeding a little, but I think the film will seed okay. Change the names back after you view the film and it will seed okay.
