[color=lime]Raj is a rich, carefree, happy-go-lucky second generation NRI. Simran is the daughter of Chaudhary Baldev Singh, who in spite of being an NRI is very strict about adherence to Indian values. The two meet on a month long Eurotrip, and what began as pranks and fun and games, ends in love. But by the time they realize it, it is already too late, as Simran has left for India to be married to her childhood fiancÃ©. Raj leaves for India with a mission at his hands, to claim his lady love under the noses of her whole family. Thus begins a saga.[/color][/code]
