Betrayal, lust, murder and revenge unfold wordlessly and compellingly among the snows of the Kazakh Steppe in the directorial debut of journalist-screenwriter Ermek Tursunov. "Kelin" has the feel of an epic tale passed down the generations through oral tradition yet the director brilliantly turns this notion on its head by eliminating all dialogue and using very little music. He intelligently trusts audiences to grasp the universality of the story even when watching rituals and customs foreign to them.


A woman is led by her family to her new husband's home, to live with, presumably, his elderly mother and younger brother. Despite being forced into the marriage, she discovers that he is not such a bad catch after all but domestic bliss does not last long
