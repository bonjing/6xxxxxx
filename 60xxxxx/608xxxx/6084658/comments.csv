,BruceWayneJr,2011-01-09T07:06Z,"Never say never. This is a big title; I wouldn't be surprised if it's picked up by Natsume or Atlus, or even Square Enix"
,drewkrew,2011-01-22T23:59Z,"Excellent game, real hard to understand in Japanese :-( but as there is no USA or EUR version, this is all you can get!

Another great Nintendo Wii game torrent.
Thanks!

,Rise2theTop,2011-01-31T03:04Z,Can't get the iso to work. The game starts but when I select new game it starts loading then just stays loading. I'm sure it's me but i haven't had any trouble with other games. I'm using configurable usb loader and I've tried every cios that I have.
