One of the things that I've been told is beware of uploaders where people don't leave any comments and has a low number of seeders.  I am more than happy to seed anything I receive.  Could you explain what you mean by needing more ""peers?""  This a a beautiful collection and takes me back to my childhood and my parents who used to own all of this music.  But, recently I got a nasty virus on my computer and it took me 9 hours to fix it.  Would love to hear from you.  Thanks."

Its only worth reseeding if there is at least 10 people waiting on the torrent.

I dont have unlimited boardband connection like the other great uploaders here on piratebay.

So re-seeding when there is at least 10 people will help in sharing the torrent quicker.

As you can see from my last upload I have not been around for a while.
