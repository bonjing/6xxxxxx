,Sleppmegin,2011-08-13T02:30Z,"Too bad the uploader doesn't even give complete information.

Some one mentioned subtitles problems...
Doesn't even say what subs there are.
Better not be hardcoded, cuz then you can forget any seeding from me."
,Ayeg3nt,2011-08-13T13:44Z,The subtitles are in a seperate file so obviously they're not hardcoded..
,Phov,2011-08-20T00:10Z,Awesome -jonny- (as usual). Thanks a lot.

,spifkitten99,2012-03-07T22:45Z,"File size is a little to big for the quality. Could have been 1 or 2 gigs smaller without any loss.

Subtitles could have been embedded in the mkv file.

But, if it's good quality, it's all good. I'll delete after I watch anyway."
,spifkitten99,2012-03-08T00:44Z,"pretty shitty quality. I guess the source is like that. All grainy and noisy, as if it's a TV show with bad reception."
