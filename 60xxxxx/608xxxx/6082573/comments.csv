,fairyboi88,2011-01-05T00:12Z,what's different in this one?
[V],thethingy,2011-01-05T00:14Z,"fairyboi88, its in the description;

v1.1 Change Log:

Added a patching mechanism fix for the Windows Software Licensing Management Tool that should hopefully prevent it from being deleted unexpectedly, which in turn may actually solve several other seemingly unrelated problems, including the rearm reset not taking place, a dialog popping up at logon that says Ignore Ignore Ignore, a windows activation dialog that asks for the product key at logon, the Status not available message in computer properties, and WMI queries not working and just going blank.
Removed an unnecessary registry backup & restore of a Windows Product Activation registry key.
Removed an unnecessary service start.
Added working directory specification that might help minimize problems with the rearm reset not working for some systems.

,Smorgan,2011-01-05T06:19Z,The Thingy sorry to come back but I'm going to issue this to the MODS.  This is HAL 7600 at least have the dignity to say it and reference it back to the four horsemen of the Apocalypse those who created it since this is a leaked copy....
,Smorgan,2011-01-05T06:30Z,"Droppin the leaked part just say who made it...


""With the new year comes a new release from the team that brought you Chew-WGA and Chew7, now partnering with secr9tos and Fibonacci from The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (known for their development of The R2 $OEM% Project [AKA: R2 Converter]). We present a new era of activation technology in our release of HAL7600, affectionately named after the HAL 9000 sentient on-board computer of the Discovery One spacecraft in Arthur C. Clarke's fictional Space Odyssey saga."""

,Darkling323,2011-08-03T00:57Z,"Dear thethingy,

I've used your programs b4 and LOVE them! Typically very easy to use and well described for their specific functions.

I've got a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium that I've lost the program key for and I'm looking to use this to rearm/activate my Windows.

However after installing Hal 7600 v1.1 I can't seem to figure out how to actually rearm my operating system! Please, can you help a fan?

Thanks!
-Darkling323

P.S. Under Tools -> System WMI Query -> Rearms/Grace Period...Says I have 4 rearms left with 0 days in my grace period."
