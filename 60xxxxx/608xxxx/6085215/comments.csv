,gregersamsa,2011-01-10T18:29Z,"In regard to ep. 14.

Must've been some glitch there, usually when an ep. is missing, like now, it's because it hasn't been aired properly. But, who knows. The version that is available here on TPB is of quite poor quality, but necessary to watch in order to get the whole story."
