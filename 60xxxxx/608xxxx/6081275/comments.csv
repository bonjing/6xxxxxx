- If anyone gets application error 0xc0000005 or something, all you need is to add ctp2.exe to Windows DEP (Data execution prevention) exceptions."

But... I can't play it. It asks me for the CD, both when It's mounted and burned.

Please help."
,DmxDragon,2012-02-27T01:04Z,"Works perfectly fine for me. 

If you are using Windows XP try following these steps.

1: Download and Mount CTPII.BIN with Daemon Tools Lite
2: Install the game.
3: Unmount CTPII.BIN and Mount CTPII.CUE.
4: Run the game and enjoy.

Hope that hopes for some other users."
