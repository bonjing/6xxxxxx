Fear not. The mind is no doubt extremely turbulent. Through repeated attempts you can perfectly 
subdue it. You are the master of the mind. By Abhyasa (practice/sadhana) and vairagya (renunciation) 
assert your mastery. Feel the power, bliss and splendour that results from perfect self-conquest. Curb 
the mind ruthlessly. Annihilate desire. When desire dies mind is your slave. Become desireless and be 
victorious. It will help you rest in prisitine freedom. 

About the Author
To the already acqainted, Swami Sivananda is a Supreme Spiritual 
Leader and for the beginner Swami Sivananda\'s writings are like a 
Fountain or an artesian well with never ending supply of water. His 
writings do not even border on narrow religious indoctrination but go 
all out to help one bring in some amount of value-addition to one\'s life. 
Some of the amazon.com best sellers like Asana Pranayama Mudra 
Bandha are written by his beloved disiciples like Swami Satyananda 
Saraswati, who had established the world famous Bihar School of Yoga.
