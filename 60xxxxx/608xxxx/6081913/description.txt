Ulf SÃ¶derberg is the creative talent behind Sephiroth.

He relates stories about the inexorable and destructive power of Time, mankindâ€™s futile attempts of resistance, and the sunken cities, fallen towers, and overgrown ruins that this has resulted in. Dark eerie soundscapes and ritualistic drums are combined with his own field recordings from places like Cairo, Iceland, and gloomy Nordic forests.

Ulfâ€™s music whispers about the Gods we are desperately trying to appease, only to find ourselves dying before the monuments we spent our lives building. Ulf bids you welcome into the ruins and down to the deep forgotten catacombs.
