The Hamsters, a blues-rock power trio based in the United Kingdom, are a very 
talented, tight, and well balanced band. 

The guitar playing is excellent, as are the vocals. They do some songwriting, 
but their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations 
of early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.

Hamster Jam is a high energy live recording, 57+ minutes of hard rockin' early 
classic rock, rock 'n roll, and Hendrix favorites. 

They bypassed the ballads for this recording, and just keep cranking out rockers. 

There's little let up from start to finish, there's a good bit of straight 
rock 'n roll, but plenty of blues-rock as well, all of it featuring excellent 
guitar support. 

Blues-rock guitar affectionados will not be disappointed with this disc, they do 
relax a bit for the start of Jimi's "Red House", but before for long this builds 
into one of the more intense songs on the disc.

Rounding out the varied selection of popular classics and originals, are some great 
sounding, less frequently heard cover tunes like Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash" 
and "Wild Thing".

There are five Hendrix flavored songs on the CD, and I really enjoy The Hamsters 
interpretation of Jimi's music.

Their approach to the Hendrix style is plenty agressive, but without the excessive 
feedback, over-extended lead breaks, and other over-done pyrotechnics that sometimes 
accompany Hendrix's covers. 

In fact, this to the point playing style carries through most of the CD.
