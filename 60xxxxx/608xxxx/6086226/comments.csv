,joolet88,2011-01-26T15:17Z,"I can confirm that the game freezes at the ubisoft logo. The game is not working. 
Thanks for the upload though consolasatope, you are the best uploader on ps3 games!"
,aust77,2011-03-01T16:38Z,"This game works great on Kmeaw 3.55 with MultiMAN 01.16.03. The ""black screen"" trick was what made it work. I had it on internal but pressed Select+X from MultiMAN with my USB ext HDD connected to launch it without error."

Thank you"

THANX N E ways."
,Stormeah,2011-06-17T00:53Z,You will need to use Select-X in Multiman to run this game.
