Thanks."

Is this the Stargate 15th Anniversary Edition (Released: 10/27/2009)??

Thanks in Advance :-)"
[T],bobnjeff,2011-01-08T21:48Z,"i believe the 15th Anniversary Edition when you look at the running time of the movie,this one i don't own picked it up from net flix copied it and put in the mail that night"
,BRiDGELiFE,2011-01-08T22:51Z,"yea runtime seem to be closest to the 15th Anniversary Edition, only 1 min diff compared to the other two which are both 6-8mins shorter, reason i ask is cuz the picture in the torrent look like the older version...... [Just off the Phone with local Retailer] Actually funny first time a Torrent has made me purchase a Movie Legit(Bout to head to BestBuy) even though in mid-download, lol...... Rather Own this one, and help the Franchise at the same time :-) (Not as if i dont have a bootleg copy allready, haha)"
[T],bobnjeff,2011-01-09T00:15Z,"sorry i couldn't help, but see your proof that downloading sells more movies!
i guess this torrent thingy isn't really killing off the movie industry.
have a great weekend

,BRiDGELiFE,2011-01-09T09:08Z,"Yea not only did I pickup the  Stargate (1994) 15th Anniversary Edition for $24.99 (Could have found it cheaper $15.99[Amaazon] but wanted it Today), but I also grabbed a nice family movie That I've always enjoyed the story of (The Pursuit of Happyness [$16.99]) that I found when looking...... All  which I've gotten copies of via the Release Scene or Torrent Scene in the past, Although I actually Snuck into The Theater in '94 for StarGate aswell (Huge SG/SG-1/SGA/SGU Fan here as you can see). So I guess you can say the Scene does Help sell movies (Good Movies)."
,BRiDGELiFE,2011-01-09T09:11Z,"p.s.- Thanks for everything, If i didnt see this on here I wouldnt have ran out to get it earlier. Haven't watched it in a while now (since DvDRiP & TV), 1080p version rocks plus all the goodies on the Disc. Bridge is VERY Happy!!
