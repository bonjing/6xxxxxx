,GizmoTheGreen,2011-01-05T14:38Z,is this the latest version with savefile and trophie sections fixed? please make this sure for noobs
,GizmoTheGreen,2011-01-05T14:39Z,"and yes i works, its basically the original firmware with the install packages in the menu, but pkg's needs to be signed now, which we can do!

so if you install this you won't be able to jailbreak and not be able to run backups/pirate"
,GizmoTheGreen,2011-01-05T14:42Z,"@nickeboy69 all .pkg files need to be properly signed now, old .pkg's won't work.

and gamemanagers won't work either since lv2 is not patched in this firmware (this is what jailbreaking did) you will have to wait :)"
,nikkeboy69,2011-01-05T15:20Z,okey thanks :) then i gonna get mw2 cl online :D

,jorghenson,2011-01-09T14:51Z,"I bought an x3max dongle but foolishly upgraded my PS3 to 3.50 so I couldn't use it. This is what I've been waiting for! Fw questions though:

1: Do we install the official Sony update first, and then this one? Or do we install this over 3.41/3.50?

2: I'm a bit of a n00b with regard to homebrew. Where do we get the HB files signed? Or are they already signed and ready for download somewhere?

3: Are there any mega drive emulators for PS as of yet?

4: Why can't it run backups? Isn't the backup manager merely a homebrew program? 


If anyone could answer any of these questions, I'd be very grateful :). And once more - thanks for this!!!"
