The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal - COMPLETE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MYRIAD WAREZ presents the whole of this journal for college students and profs

The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal is an excellent journal that 
provides short articles on interesting areas of math, problems and solutions, 
and teaching resources. It was designed for both teachers and students in 
two-year colleges in the US, but is appropriate for students in high school,
college or university, amateur and self-taught mathematicians and teachers of
mathematics at all levels.

It is full of new facts about maths, interesting observations, explanations 
of why commonly known things work or how to teach them, and of course lots
of puzzles and questions. There is also a lively letters page. Great for 
browsing, perfect for looking up something that you need more information on
and ideal for finding a good topic for a project, talk or lesson.

If you thought college math was going to be more exciting than it turned out
to be, if you're stuck in high school waiting to learn something better
than trigonometry or if you need to figure out how to teach students that 
feel like that, start looking here.

Here's a random selection of article titles that we thought looked good:
Antisubmarine_Warfare-3026770-L_Whitt-K_Wilk.pdf
Sequences_Series_and_Pascals_Triangle-3027096-Lenny_K_Jones.pdf
The_Irrationality_of_Certain_Numbers-3027111-Peter_A_Lindstrom.pdf
The_History_of_the_Calculus-3027118-Carl_B_Boyer.pdf
One-Sided_Surfaces_and_Orientability-3026946-John_W_Woll-Jr.pdf
Calculus_as_an_Experimental_Science-3026951-R_P_Boas-Jr.pdf
How_Steep_Is_a_Hill-3026801-Robert_L_Page.pdf
An_Interesting_Penny_Game-2698951-Keith_J_Craswell.pdf
Another_Challenge_in_the_Classroom-3026443-Jack_M_Robertson.pdf
Random_Sieving_and_the_Prime_Number_Theorem-3026985-Karl_Greger.pdf

The Two-Year College Mathematics Journal is continued by the College
Mathematics Journal. We are hoping to get hold of it soon, watch this space.

The torrent includes around 1000 pdfs split into 56 folders, one for every
issue of the journal. As usual each folder is zipped separately, to reduce 
the size of the torrent but still allow you to grab only the ones you need.
We also put all the contents pages separately so you can get hold of them
and figure out which other files you need. You can browse JSTOR and then
download the issues you want from this torrent, but unlike us they don't have
article titles in the contents listing :(

This torrent is dedicated to /generic_/ by the rest of the MYRIAD team
