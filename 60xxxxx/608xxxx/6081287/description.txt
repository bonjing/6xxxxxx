FIRST AND FOREMOST: THANK YOU TO ALL THE RELEASE GROUPS THAT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ADVANCED COPIES OF MOVIES FOR US TO ENJOY! THANKS TO KINGDOM RELEASE,MYSTiC,IMAGiNE,ELEKTRI4KA,NoRar,WBZ,MAXSPEED,Noir,SecretMyth AND ALL OTHERS PAST AND PRESENT.
------------------------------
I looked everywhere I could. I scoured the Net, searching high and low, day and night, looking for the absolute best copy of this film that I could. Not being part of any ACTUAL SCENE group I could not get a hold of MASTER copies ( or better copies) that are Undoubtedly out there. I found that the MYSTiC .mp4 version gave the best video to start with. It had the best look to it overall except for being to bright. The audio wasn't the greatest ( IMAGiNE's being the best ) but I could not, for some reason, splice another audio source. Since this was already synced I decided to keep it.

Second ENCode to Xvid
------------------------------
The resulting video after the Divx conversion was a lot better over all as you can see from the screens. While being a bit too bright from the contrast and luminance reduction, over all, it brought out a few more of the subtle details while bringing down the color saturation. I decided to re-encode to adjust for the brightness. I decided on Xvid so that my DVD encoder would agree with it. IMHO this is a very watchable copy that should do the job until an R5 or DVD-Rip comes along. Hope you all enjoyed the work I did. AS ALWAYS, I DO THIS FOR FUN AND FOR THE SHARE/P2P/TORRENT/TPB COMMUNITY. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DON'T D/L IT. IF YOU DO, COMMENTS ARE APPRECIATED. PLEASE SEED AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.
