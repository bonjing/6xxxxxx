I think all blue-ray though have the 1H20min length.

It's up to you which is more important, the length or the pic & sound quality. Blame the studios for their God damned cuts.

It's ridiculous to pay for a blue-ray then find out later that it has been chopped, and with so many movies is the case.

So take it or leave it but moan about the length. Go complain at the blu-ray.com & imdb instead."
