,dark_defender,2011-01-05T22:08Z,Thanks a ton. I loved Fanny och from this director. Hope this one will also be good.
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-05T22:41Z,"@dark_defender: Could I encode 8 1/2 in 1120x640 instead of 1280x720 or even as 704x400 (but great quality)?
When I answered positive on your request and you asked for 720p, I didn't know that movie isn't 2.35/1 (theatrical aspect) but as nowadays TV - 16/9 aspect (even oldie as ""8 and a half"").
That makes file over 1.5 GB and I cannot do that. Movie is 2h19 long and hence the size.
Sorry, but I got BluRay like an hour ago.
So, let me know."
,i_am_sid,2011-01-05T22:50Z,"@twentyforty
Can you please encode----------Appleseed 2004--------------in BRrip. Dual Audio { English and Japanese (original) } will be nice but its up to you. I have searched all different trackers but didnt find decent rip."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-05T23:29Z,"@i_am_sid: Okuribito (just yesterday) was your request. Fulfilled within 24 hours.
So - be nice, be reasonable and - fair to others. 
Seed back at least two-three times and that way make my life easier and give others what was given to you."
,viper7gts,2011-01-05T23:57Z,"Thank you 20-40 for your fantastic uploads you are the man!
Could you upload Disney Classic Movies "
,dark_defender,2011-01-06T00:03Z,"@twentyforty: I can understand your concern over size as some people bitch about it. You can please go ahead and encode 8 1/2 in 1120x640.

P.S: I am glad that you even asked about it instead of just encoding it st8 away.

@i_am_sid: Please be reasonable in your frequency of requests. Actually this goes for all 20-40 fans."

I wouldn't even care if you just got the preview shown here!
Thanks."
,ks85,2011-01-06T02:18Z,"Thank you so much!
All the best to you,

,r-0987,2011-01-06T09:47Z,Is there any site for knowing when blurays release?
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-06T10:14Z,"@azrielle: I watched and downloaded that preview. It's .flv file and I am afraid, by poor quality, totally unsuitable for any conversion.
However, this Preview is really free, and one should get FireFox browser and extension (plug-in) Download Helper and get (download) the preview very easy, no matter connection speed. And VLC for playing it later, of course."
,dark_defender,2011-01-06T11:53Z,Why so less seeds on this one. Come on people. Share!
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-06T15:42Z,"@viper7gts: I can hardly think of the title of Disney Classic I haven't uploaded. But sorely, all these torrents are dead or deleted."
,korpen,2012-03-24T06:53Z,"1:28:46 | 576x352 | 25fps | Xvid | 192kbps MP3

Great quality, thank you!"
