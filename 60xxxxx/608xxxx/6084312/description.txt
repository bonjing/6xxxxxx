Type: Album

Release Date: 1999
Bitrate: 192kbps

NOTE: This is not the metal band Heed, but the trip-hop band with the same name.

Excellent trip-hop with a tendency towards pop (there is a rapper too, besides a wonderful female vocalist), but not as (irritatingly) pop as others (I am winking at Morcheeba and Hooverphonic from last album).
They have also released an album called Breakeven 2200, please let me know if you want me to upload this album as well, which is not as amazing as Postdynamic Tide, although still decent.

P.S. The single Seldom Seen has appeared, among others, on the background of a bottled water TV commercial, if I recall correctly.
