SuperRam â€“ A utility for optimizing and managing computer memory. The program is simple â€“ to cope with it even the person who had never worked with such tools. You will be sufficient to choose the amount of memory to be used, and the amount which should be released, and then click â€œOKâ€. The rest will SuperRam. The effect, as the creators insist the program will be evident immediately â€“ to express it, of course, first of all, in performance of programs that have hitherto been able to desperately â€œbrakeâ€. In addition, the program will always show you the graph, which clearly shows how much memory is used, and what â€“ is free.

Features:
- Optimizes computer memory by freeing.
- Runs in the background to free memory for maintaining system stability.
- Visual representation in system tray which displays how much memory is available in the system.
- You can choose the settings for their purposes.
- Simple and intuitive user interface which performs memory optimization in real time.
