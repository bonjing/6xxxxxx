As usual you are the berries ChattChito. One thing though. Did everything last year with this and worked perfectly but then this year(2011)January did update and guess what??? Had notice from homesite that program is pirate. Was I stupid to update? Can you update this program. Many thanks for all you have done and continue to do. Always found your apps to be of the highest quality. 
I just realized that I was using your previous up. Will try this one."
