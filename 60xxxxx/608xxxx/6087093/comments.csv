[T],despo1ler,2011-03-17T22:14Z,"the title did the same corruption when I uploaded this, I had to delete it and repost with the title as Superman-Brainiac..... to get it to upload properly, 1 of the moderators did reply to my post asking for the hash to be deleted by saying I should put a double space before words that are being corrupted like this so I'll be trying that next time it happens. If you want to do the same and repost this ask for the hash to be deleted in the appropriate thread on the suprabay forum(link below) once the post is deleted and once the mods have cleared the hash try altering the title in 1 of the suggested ways. Also worth knowing for other title corruptions ;)"
