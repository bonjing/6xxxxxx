[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-01-06T03:37Z,"is it possible to disable the 3D Settings during initial launch?

thanks again"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-01-06T09:25Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ XxFukenGruvenxX: Not that I know of. :/
I removed the ""3DFeature"" batch files from the Tweak Pack because they didn't work anymore.
UI_Enable3DFeature 0 used to disable the 3D feature."

[T],ADHDerby,2011-01-07T10:32Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ XxFukenGruvenxX: Here's a workaround.

""Black Satin No 3D"" Skin for PowerDVD 10 Mark II

Changes between the default and the modified skin:

- Removed the 3D buttons and features
- Changed the autohide delay from the tabs to 1 sec (default = 3)
- Smaller Mini Mode: removed the Cyberlink logo & the Config button
- The Mini Mode has a glass background (Windows Vista & Windows 7)
- Fixed Mini Mode buttons (the white lines) + black Volume Control
- Removed the Upgrade button and the divider before the Help button

http://h*tfile.com/dl/94923667/42411d8/BlackSatinNo3D.zip.html (replace * with o)

Install: Extract to the skins directory and run the batch file"
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-01-07T20:26Z,"@ ADHDerby

Thank you for taking the time to address my question.

But i was unclear about what i was referring to.

What i was referring to is the '3D Prompt' that pops up when you start PowerDVD, it asks if you want to setup your 3D Device. That's the prompt i was trying to disable. I just want to start it, and use it, without any prompts.

Thanks again, and if it's not possible, it's no big deal, this is as perfect as it gets already :)"
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-01-07T20:27Z,"F.Y.I

If you must do it for a certain skin, i strictly use your TPB skin."
,American_Slacker,2011-01-08T21:24Z,"Thank you, dolby virtual speaker is working now. :)"
[T],ADHDerby,2011-01-08T23:48Z,"You're welcome! :)

@ XxFukenGruvenxX: I found the command (in the registry), I'll add it to the future releases."
,dekayw,2011-01-12T04:07Z,"Hello, forgive me for being a bit thick but I am a little lost trying to get the black skin to work. Where exactly do I find (or need to create) the skins directory . Other than that problem I thank you ADHDerby from the bottom of my heart, this software is great and installed like a dream, as you said it would."
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-01-12T04:40Z,"@ ADHDerby
i can't wait :)

I'll be on the lookout for your next update !

@ dekayw
Copy the 2 '.dll' files and '.reg' file into the 'Skins' folder, located in CyberLink's installation directory.. usually it's ""C://Program Files/CyberLink/PowerDVD/ .... ""

Then double-click the '.reg. file to add into your registry.

Start CyberLink, and you will not see the new skin."
,dekayw,2011-01-12T13:31Z,"thanks kindly for your reply XxFukenGruvenxX , I still dont know what Im doing wrong though , I have found the file path you refer to, pasted the new files in and clicked the .bat file (.reg), I get the window which says the skin is switched but when I open powerdvd it still isnt switched. ,,,,, I know Im in the right folder because the original files (blacksatin) are in there, do they need to be removed.,,,, my computer is 64bit vista and the path is C://Program Files(x86)/CyberLink/PowerDVD

thanks again for your help"
,dekayw,2011-01-12T15:29Z,"Solved my own problem, I pulled out the ""blacksatin"" files and renamed the ""Black"" files to ""Blacksatin""
Still don't know why the .bat files didn't do the job but this works for me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, Im going now to get the TPB skin torrent............. Best regardes and a last (for now) thanks to ADHderby"
,2311,2011-01-13T00:53Z,"Hello, I've a problem. Ik downloaded this torrent http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5983576/Pillars.of.the.Earth.720p.BluRay.X264-REWARD . I don't get any sound. I thought it had something to do with the fact that those .mkv-files have DTS audio (the torrent uses DTS 1509kbps
), but then again PowerDVD 10 is DTS-audio compatible, isn't? (By the way the same story when I use Divx Player Plus) Or are the files the problem? Could someone help me out here, thanx in advance!"
[T],XxFukenGruvenxX,2011-01-13T04:23Z,"@ 2311 

do you get sound from other videos?

if so, then you probably have DTS/High Def audio turned off in settings. Just go into the Audio Options of PowerDVD, and play around with the settings and it will work. "
[T],ADHDerby,2011-01-13T09:29Z,"@ dekayw: The batch files (.bat) and reg files are designed to work on 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows. Just restart PowerDVD and the skin should be switched.

@ 2311 and XxFukenGruvenxX: PowerDVD 10 only plays MKV files that follow the MKV specification - http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/codecid/index.html
If the MKV file contains an unspecified audio format, it won't play the audio. :/

If you want to play it with PowerDVD, you can mux the files to M2TS with tsMuxeR and it will play the audio."

,DyingPlanet,2011-02-03T07:01Z,"Hey ADHDerby, many thanks here - I downloaded and installed this wonderful app, but every time I restart my PC, the Windows Installer tries to continue the installation process, fails to find a particular file (PowerDVD.msi - which DOES exist), and the installation process fails.  The app seems to work, but I want to clean up this problem, and I can't even delete the app via the Control Panel for the same reason, it looks for the same file and fails.  Any suggestions?"
