Sweden's best Covenant's newest EP released on October 22nd, 2010 is a precursor to their first album in nearly 5 years, "Modern Ruin" to be released January 14, 2011. I will upload it as soon as possible. 

The EP is done with Daniel Myer as an official band member, replacing Clas Nachmanson, so there is a slight stylistic change to the more ambient and industrial area, as will the album be.
