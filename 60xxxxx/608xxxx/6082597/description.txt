Lawrence of Arabia (1962)

An inordinately complex man who has been labeled everything from hero, 
to charlatan, to sadist, Thomas Edward Lawrence blazed his way to glory 
in the Arabian desert, then sought anonymity as a common soldier under 
an assumed name. The story opens with the death of Lawrence in a motorcycle 
accident in London at the age of 47, then flashbacks to recount his 
adventures: as a young intelligence officer in Cairo in 1916, he is given 
leave to investigate the progress of the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I. 
In the desert, he organizes a guerrilla army and--for two years--leads the Arabs in 
harassing the Turks with desert raids, train-wrecking and camel attacks. Eventually, 
he leads his army northward and helps a British General destroy the power of the 
Ottoman Empire.
