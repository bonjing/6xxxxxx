    It's summer solstice in Siberia, a time of endless         
    daylight and extraordinary festivals.                     
                                                             
    Bruce Parry journeys to meet the Sakha horse people and   
    a remote encampment of Eveny reindeer herders in the       
    wild Verkhoyansk Mountains, where he finds out how they   
    are embracing the challenges of a post-Soviet Arctic.    
                                                              
    For Bruce, it's also a journey of personal discovery as    
    he goes in search of the ancient shamanic religion of     
    these wild northern lands.
