,fightthenwofuckers,2011-01-20T21:59Z,"The fucking idiot that wrote the story for this movie movie should be hanged with his writing hand shoved up into his ass! This movie was the most complete waste of time anyone could possibly imagine! The story sucked, the actors was good choices, but daaah they sucked! This whole movie is the complete edition package of shit a idiot could ever dream of!
I would rather cut my head off and tie it to my genitals then see this shit ever again!!!"

Just out of curiousity, Why are 5.1 channel dvdrips so uncommon.
You would think with so many htpc setups out there 5.1 would be almost standard. "

,mrmr87,2011-10-23T21:37Z,"To all the ps3 users....i have a ps3 and this worked fine for me. Cinavia has two types, audio and visual. if the file stops playing and says ""cinavia protected"" your fucked. If you lose audio theres a simple sloution. Im not a genius, but the Cinavia disease is in the HDMI audio. Either, use a scart lead (picture isnt as good but if your that bothered go buy the film from a shop) or change the audio settings on your ps3 so it doesnt output through hdmi (no quality loss) or buy an Optical Audio Cable often known as Tos Link or SPDIF cable, use this for the Audio, and HDMI for the Video, you have to run 1 extra lead from the back of your ps3 but it will work and when im reading comments to find the quality of the copy it will take less time because i wont have to scroll past all your bitching.....and your all welcome..........im here all week =)"
