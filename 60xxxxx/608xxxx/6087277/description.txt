Very HQ rare promo music video. "Telephone Line" is a song by Electric Light Orchestra.

This song is track two on their 1976 album A New World Record and was the final single to be released from the band's LP until September 2006 when Surrender was released from the expanded reissue.

This song charted in the Top Ten in both the United Kingdom and the United States, peaking at #8 in the UK and #7 in the US. In 1977, the song would reach No #1 in New Zealand. The US version of the single was released in green vinyl---as was the norm, many ELO singles were issued in different colors---but it was the only single that was green. It became the band's first single to achieve Gold sales figures.

A New World Record was the second album to be recorded at Musicland Studios in Munich, the LP proved to be the band's long awaited breakthrough in the UK: after seeing their previous three studio recordings fail to chart in their home market, A New World Record became their first top ten album in the UK, The LP became a huge global success and would consolidate the band's position as one of the biggest selling rock bands in the world, reaching multi-platinum status in the US and UK, The album sold five million units worldwide within its first year of release. 

The cover art features the famous ELO logo, designed by Kosh, for the first time. This logo would be included on several of the group's subsequent releases.
