Release is untouched except unpacking rar -> ISO for better seeding.
Seems to work perfect with all license options.
Supports all the latest Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 devices!
Read .nfo for release details and instructions!

Upload efforts on this software package has been repeatedly deleted by TPB
with no explanation given, so on this very last try I unpacked the release
to ISO and I will only seed with moderate bandwidth until I see the torrent
remain on TPB.
