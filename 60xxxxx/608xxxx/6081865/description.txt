    On a cold, eerie evening, on a barren, wind-swept mountainside, a        
    leathery, evil man named Grady brings eight people to their destiny.     
    A priest looking for the money to build a church hides a dark past, a    
    young married couple looking for the wealth to start a life together,    
    a prostitute searching for a way out of her present, - they all share    
    one thing - a desire for the gold that is buried deep in the             
    mountain. What they find instead is a terrifying horror and a            
    powerful greed that leads them into a descent into the maelstrom of      
    their existences.
