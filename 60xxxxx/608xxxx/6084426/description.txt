Darrell Wasyk's H, The Best Canadian Film of 1990, is considered one of the most intense and powerful films ever made. It is the story of two heroin addicts, Michele and Snake, who struggle to withdraw from the drug - cold turkey. Nailed into their apartment, Michele and Snake become hostages of each other. As the number of "cold turkey" days increases, their resolve ebbs and flows as they dig deeper and depper into themselves.
