     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Join Professor Brian Cox and Dara O Briain to wonder at the
      night sky, with extraordinary images beamed in from telescopes
      across the globe. Learn how to observe and take pictures over
      three busy days in the celestial calendar, with a meteor shower,
      a partial eclipse of the sun and the biggest planet in our solar
      system, Jupiter, burning bright.
      
     
     Notes.........                                                  
                                                       

      Wouldn't normally pre PDTV when it aired in HDTV, but while
      SFM pred the 720p, they didn't do the XviD. We gave it a while
      to see if someone else would pre the XviD, but there's none so
      here you go! (Before someone goes and pres a webrip of it...)
