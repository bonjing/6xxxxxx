Orbison wrote this with songwriter Will Jennings, who had written the hugely successful theme song to An Officer And A Gentleman ("Up Where We Belong") in 1982 and went on to write "My Heart Will Go On" for Titanic. Says Jennings:
"This song was written for a Nic Roeg film, Insignificance, in the summer of 1984. I had been engaged to write songs for the film with Stanley Myers, the composer for the project, and I asked the film company to get in touch with Roy, who I did not know at the time, to see whether he would like to do the main song for the film. I started work in California, went to Nashville and met with Roy, and we took a few days to develop the song I had started. Originally the title was "When Your Heart Runs Out Of Time." We intensified the lyric to "Wild Hearts Run Out Of Time." The film was about an imagined gathering of Marilyn Monroe, Joe DiMaggio, Albert Einstein and, I think, Senator Joseph McCarthy in Einstein's apartment in New York. Roy and I focused on Marilyn: the song is about reaching to save her before she destroys herself. Roy and I became great friends starting with this project and spent a lot of time together after he moved to California."
