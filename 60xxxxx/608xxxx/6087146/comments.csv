,amberlea900,2011-01-18T01:19Z,Just found out that S04E12 is not aired until 02/03/2011
,tuttles1,2011-01-19T21:51Z,Hi Amber how is that?? Abc said on the website aired 13/01/11 sure it did :(
,tuttles1,2011-01-19T23:42Z,Apparently Heaven Can Wait was the title of episode 12 which was due to air on the 13th Jan but it says the next one is Playing God which is after If you don't know me by now which is episode 11 so I am guessing they have changed it
