500M33 is like 2 years old, c'mon guys, get a real firmware!"
,kizegan,2011-01-07T15:22Z,"@therealiam It's been a loooong time since I've used my PSP, and just got it out to play GOW:GOS which worked fine. I assumed that this would work too. "

,BeakinSqueakin,2011-01-13T12:31Z,"@ therealiam

5.00 m33 is still usedmainly because it is a really trustworthy firmware as opposed to some of the gen ones which may limit homebrew and various fatures that m33 doesnt limit"
