,yavsbb,2012-05-29T09:49Z,"Very good series!! I thought it was the American version of the Bristish 'Life on Mars' but it's in fact like a second part. Nice surprise! The same actors but for the main one. DCI Hunt, my favourite. Shame there's no more policemen like him any more!!! 
I recommend this series but I suggest you see 'Life on Mars' first. You can see 'Ashes to Ashes' without seeing 'Life on Mars' previously anyway. 
Soundtrack: awesome
(And if you like this, I also recommend ""Mad dogs"" with Philip Glenister, the actor who plays DCI Hunt, and John Simm, who plays Sam Taylor in 'Life on Mars'.
Enjoy!
A:10, v:10. 
Thankyou River-Haggis!"
