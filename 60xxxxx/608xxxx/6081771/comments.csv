,Pinkertow,2011-01-04T17:05Z,"Got to make an amendment to my last comment, they're mostly great. This one isn't. Pretty bad file."
,imm4u,2011-01-04T22:16Z,Yes its getting stopped at 27 min and then it dosnt work later. :( 
,moldybudz,2011-01-04T23:56Z,Agree with other comments. This file is corrupt. It stops @ about 28 minutes and then doesn't start up again until about 15 minutes later. Manually tracking to the area that it stops in produces no results. Tried in VLC and MPC. Just bad. Avoid this torrent. Download one of the many others.
,Vawned,2011-01-05T05:57Z,Yeah I got problems too with any played I tried. That's sad cause this had the best quality. :( Better to get this one: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6081696/WWE.Monday_Night_RAW_3rd_JAN_2011.515MB_RIP At least it works.
,overelemental,2011-01-05T09:31Z,"Sadly, the file is corrupt. Works for about 10 mins before getting scrambled and I lose the sound. At 28m it just gets totally messed up. "
,therealsicilian,2011-01-05T17:25Z,"File is fucked up. Don't download it. Fuck you, RUDOS. Download TvTeam's version. They always kick ass."
,sspmb_balu,2011-01-06T15:02Z,"This torrent has the problem that u guys told, it has been created when the releaser completed just 57.7%, i checked this file with a private tracker torrent and it showed me that it has been completed 57.7% and i completed this file with that torrent and i watched it with out any problem. :) i just want to say that, there is no problem with the releases, the problem is with the torrent file creation."
