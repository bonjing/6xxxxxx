The verdant green landscape, the magnetic blue  
waters and the warm bright sunshine of beautiful
Goa is home to one of the greatest magicians of 
his time, Ethan Mascarenhas. Presently hosting a
Radio Show that spreads magic and hope and      
laughter through his irrepressible wit and humor
to every listener and caller, it is difficult   
to imagine that this is a man who has been      
immobilized with a spinal injury for the last   
fourteen years of his life.
