,muthineni,2011-01-04T12:27Z,weekends only..? didnt see that.. i can wait all month for a good rip :)
,Killjoy88,2011-01-04T12:59Z,"@Twentyforty - thank you once again for your uploads, you truly are the best!

I was wondering, is there any way we can RSS just your torrent page and not the whole movie/tv show section ? "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-04T13:28Z,"@dark_defender: OK

@muthineni: 2 x OK ,1 x shaky (Das Boot is hard to get - I'll try)

In January."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-04T13:45Z,"@Killjoy88: I strongly discourage use of RSS and automatic, non-selective loading. This is tool of Hit&Run leechers and I have blocked/banned over 500 addresses so far. Use of proxy doesn't help (I spot immediately early loading and mark these users to see for how long they will seed and it usually ends very tragic). I ban, without hesitation, whole providers, back-bones, countries and even continents. These users usually stay as banned forever.
Point being - do not RSS me. You cannot read Torrent-description that way (and it might be important) and it would put you in harms way, without special cause."
,Killjoy88,2011-01-04T14:13Z,okay - thank you for the info!
,hkoraddi,2011-01-04T14:36Z,"well its like i am unable to connect to you after coming back from holidays.so going on on slow speed.now a days its like when my down finishes i would be in ratio of 2.5+.i would love to seed atleast for 5x(which takes 3-4 days for me)but if i dont have file i cant share much.so please remove the limits and share.

@2040-thanks for this as always +1 for u"
,hkoraddi,2011-01-04T14:38Z,"^ ^
just 1st n last sentence for u.others for others."
,muthineni,2011-01-04T14:49Z,"thank you very much for taking my requests.
yeah i know das boot is hard to find. but take ur time .but if u can get it up on tpb it ll probably get lots of hits too.
once again... thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-04T15:56Z,"@hkoraddi: NONE of the people I know, people who have left even one comment (crazies excluded) never was and never would be blocked by me.
You should run good Anti-spy program just once, to see maybe something infectious has gotten in the way (I use Spybot Search&Destroy). - or something on your end has changed (maybe your provider has changed the ""tactic"" and has started to block or to throttle P2P traffic.

What people seems hard to understand is gigantic disproportion of You all . with names, who left comments - and FEW THOUSANDS every day which choose rather to stay mute and do things they do and as they like.

 I guarantee that if someone gets banned  seeding access, its one of Them, not the people whose comments one can see."
,DevSIN,2011-01-04T16:06Z,@2040 : thanx for taking my request bro... u r the best...!
,froglog,2011-01-04T21:30Z,"Thank you for this one, and for getting back to me regarding the desert song request.

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-05T13:47Z,"@froglog:
My e-mail address for TPB purpose is in every long torrent description. You are like three-four clicks away."
,strmprpl,2011-01-05T13:57Z,"Not a bad movie.
Ethan Hawke would have been a better choice for Sam Rockwell's character.

New year wishes, everyone!"
