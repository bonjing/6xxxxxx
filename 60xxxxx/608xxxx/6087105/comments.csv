,an701,2011-06-04T02:41Z,What kind of DVD disk do I have to use? DVD+R dual layer? 
,rockandrollpaul,2011-11-15T04:19Z,"Thought I'd post to help people out.  You need a Dual Layer DVD.  You also need to make sure you change the book type to DVD-ROM.  I used Nero 7 to burn it, I don't remember exactly what I did to change it, but before you burn the .iso make sure you change the Book Type to DVD-Rom.  Hope that helps (google it if you have issues I found instructions that way)."

Insert your blank DVD+R DL disc and choose ""Open in finder"" when the message comes up. Open Disk Utility (In the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder). Click the ""Burn"" icon at the top of the Disk Utility Main Window. Point the ""Select Burn Image"" window to the ISO file and click burn. Select your drive options and burn. 

I tried mounting the ISO image and burning the contents to a disc and it didn't work. This is the only way I was able to get it to go."
