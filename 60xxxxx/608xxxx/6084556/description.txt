Miyako Yoshida dances the title role originally created for Margot Fonteyn in 
the hauntingly beautiful underwater world of Ondine, vividly brought to life by The Royal Ballet. 
Frederick Ashtonâ€™s shimmering choreography, Lila de Nobiliâ€™s impressionistic designs 
and Hans Werner Henzeâ€™s specially commissioned, vibrant and inventive score, 
memorably combine to evoke the many moods and colours of the sea.

Recorded live at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, June 2009.
