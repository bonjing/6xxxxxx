Im running a legal dutch home premium version of vista at the moment. soon im going to upgrade to w7 ultimate english version, but because im not running an engish home premium it is not yet possible to go and upgrade. from dutch->eng is not possible on home premium ):

my question is will i be able to upgrade to my legal w7 ultimate if i overwrite my dutch vista with this one where no product key is required?

other small question: can i also use deamon tools to mount image so i dont have to burn this torr to a cd? =]

thanks"

All I did was burn the .iso image and inserted the disk and that was it.  Keep up the outstanding work my friend."

,djunifix,2011-02-23T23:09Z,"Thanks for the torrent :)

Im downloading this torrent + your Windows 7 torrent. 

I have windows Xp and no Dvd Burner so the best option for me would be doing Update to Vista then update to windows 7 right?

and if i install vista, do i need to activate it if im going to update to windows 7 ?

And if all goes well, when i have windows 7 can i do ""Windows Updates"" or do i have to disable that ? is there any updates i should not download or is all fine when ""Activated / Genuine"" ?"
,s2k4,2011-02-24T21:12Z,"Hi!

Okay guys! Get away from this! This guy's torrents are all forged! Do not trust this software.

It is loaded with all sorts of SpyWare (even patched official libraries, included even through the means, of the unverified drivers, that he calls ""genuine"".

Do not fall for this!

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

My advice would be searching for ""branded"" OEM.

This ""Computer-User"" is a sloppy script kiddie!

Don't fall for this.

For you ""Computer-User"": Get a life! Or at least go learn how to develop software (which, obviously, you will never do) before using this kind of third-party Malware.

,remedy2,2011-04-04T23:18Z,"Computer User thanks for this I guess.  I don't like that you included any driver in the windows installation though.  I won't install it since I can't compare the ISO checksum against all other Vista ISOs.  Sorry I'm sure you are a great guy and all but I am wary of installing a whole operating system from TPB.

It was a great download except when I saw you changed the ISO.  Nothing showing up on anti-virus in the ISO but that doesn't mean something isn't in there.  It can take months for a virus to be defined by these guys.

Please consider not f-ing with the ISO like putting in ethernet drivers on your releases.  The OS is too important to trust to unknown people on the internet, no matter what color the skull/crossbones symbol is next to your name.

Disclosure: not intended to be a flame, just a suggestion to those of us who try to think ahead. "

Hi, I have downloaded your torrents (windows vista 32bit and 64bit and also windows 7 32bit and 64bit) and they work perfectly. However is the activator you supply with the torrent the same for all of them? So when you have to burn the activator to the disk, would I have to do that once because the activator will work on them all?

Thanks."
,Antdemo,2011-12-14T01:53Z,"If anyone gets errors while installing use a diff disk.. dvd+

if it still happens just use a diff dvd rw drive to burn it.. still happens change the dvd drive.. 

this is only for the 0x800 errors, before doing any of this try redownload and reburn at lowest speed... 

another error could be your graphics card.. disable it in bios and use the onbored, sometimes windows can have errors because of that. 

all this is a big tip of for those like me reading for errors and finding solutions.

should help many people with this problem"
,Antdemo,2011-12-14T01:54Z,"i forgot to add, try a diff burn program also, some can fail without noticing "
