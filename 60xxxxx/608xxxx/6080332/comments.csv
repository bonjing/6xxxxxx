,Redvilder,2011-07-18T15:12Z,I love how people complain on the quality of a movie that was shot in 1981.
,Mitchayy,2011-07-25T15:27Z,Everyone just keep in mind its a 1982 movie so the quality isn't fantastic even with a dvd rip. Thank you lots V3nDetta_ for uploading this. I will say that if you love Indiana Jones or you want to see it then deffinetly download this. =]
