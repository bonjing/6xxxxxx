,strogganoff,2011-01-17T02:59Z,"I got the following error message when I tried to copy the ISO file to USB stick, using the USB download tool included in your torrent: ""The selected file is not a valid ISO file. Please select a valid ISO file and retry"". I also got the same error message with your Vista Home Premium torrent. I know I selected the correct file because I can open it and mount it with Power ISO. Infortunately I cannot install it by mounting on a virtual or actual DVD drive because I want to install it on a HP Mini notebook (with no CD/DVD drive) which will not start up. Therefore I can only install using the boot from USB method. Help pleeeeeeeease!!!!!"
,strogganoff,2011-01-17T04:22Z,Computer-user.....how to contact you now that your forum account is gone? Can you email me on fragrantflatulence@ukf.net
,strogganoff,2011-01-17T05:51Z,OK....problem solved with great utility Win toflash at wintoflash.com It makes a bootable usb flash drive from your windows DVD much better than the windows own usb tool. I mounted the image with Power ISO and then used Wintoflash (very easy to use wizard). Hey presto....booted into Vista installation first time. I suggest you add this tool into your torrents because other peole are having the same problem. Thanks for all your work!!!!
