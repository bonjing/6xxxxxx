Belinda Jo Carlisle (born August 17, 1958) is a Grammy Award-nominated American singer and best-selling author. Carlisle gained worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of The Go-Go's, who made history as the first all-female music group to write their own songs and play their own instruments to top the Billboard charts. The Go-Go's are considered by some to be the most successful all-female band of all time. As part of the Go-Go's, Carlisle sold more than seven million albums, and later went on to a successful solo career that spawned hits such as "Mad About You," "Summer Rain," "I Get Weak," "Leave a Light On" and "Heaven Is a Place on Earth", which topped the charts internationally, including in the United States and United Kingdom. Her autobiography, Lips Unsealed, released in June 2010, reached #27 on the New York Times Bestseller List and received favorable reviews.
