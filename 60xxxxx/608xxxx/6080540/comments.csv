may be cus i dont have latest updates"
,cogswifey,2011-01-28T00:58Z,"This worked perfectly, I have all expansion and stuff packs installed. Still can't get Riverview to show up in the game..."
,Fanx,2011-01-29T17:37Z,"@cogswifey
I had problems with Riverview too. After trying Sim Launcher, a torrent and an old version it finally worked when I did it in-game. It worked so well I then had multiple versions of Riverview show up from my previous failed attempts. :S"

,mlucas719,2011-03-09T03:18Z,"How do i use the file called: ""Barnacle Bay.Sims3Pack"""
,thisguyisaspy,2011-04-10T06:34Z,"@mlucas719
For Vista, put it in C:\Users\**your user name**\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3\Downloads

Open up the Sims 3 Game Launcher and it should show up in the downloads section (marked with a !)"
,neonmermaid,2011-04-25T19:55Z,"How to install on a mac after downloading? I'm seeding right now, if you could help me out I'd really appreciate it :)"
,m24bm24,2011-04-30T17:42Z,"So, I put this in the Downloads folder but nothing's showing up. did I screw something up or...?"
,m24bm24,2011-04-30T17:44Z,"Oh, never mind, I somehow just put in the RAR and didn't open it xD My bad"
,Hydre,2011-05-10T17:16Z,"this might be a little late but just when you open the rar file, select the only thing in it and put it in C:'users'/My documents/Electronic arts/The sims 3/InstalledWorlds and not downloads =3"
,kaara8722,2011-05-13T01:11Z,"i hope it will work if  i  only have the base game, havent got any stuff or exp pks yet... but i will seed though..."
,kaara8722,2011-05-13T01:48Z,i extracted it to the installed worlds like u said and it didnt show up in my game...help?
,mikkomik,2011-06-09T20:27Z,Now works fine
,superkid685,2011-07-21T10:27Z,"so i unrar'd it to be: Barnacle Bay.Sims3Pack

and i put the file in: C:'users'/My documents/Electronic arts/The sims 3/InstalledWorlds

and it doesnt show up on the game.
it wont let me update the game because i torrented that also.
what do i do?"
,robgar_bob,2011-08-11T17:18Z,"@superkid685
its a launcher package, just double file you extracted the game will automatically capture it and update the game.
"
,robgar_bob,2011-08-11T17:19Z,pardon my typo.. i meant double click the extracted file. peace.
,spyroklown,2011-08-18T18:52Z,for all the people that said they used the packeage form of riverview and it didnt show up...try going into the launcher and then installing it that way seemed to work with mine
