[T],theburningbush,2011-11-04T23:23Z,"Oh, there was a new Conan ep last night, but it sure wasn't this one. This is probably the biggest goof I've seen from TvTeam.

Last night's ep had:
o  Louis C.K.
o  Triumph the Insult Comic Dog
o  The wedding of Scott Cronick and David Gorshein

Whether TvTeam or anyone else will ever upload this ep is anybody's guess."
