[V],-jonny-,2011-01-04T11:55Z,"It's a great movie, but the IMDb Top 250 is not a list of the greatest movies. This is not the greatest movie ever made. It is the most popular."
,n00bOfTheTorrents,2011-01-04T13:24Z,"The fact that IMDB has it #1, and I have it #1 are purely coincidental. I wasn't referring to the IMDB rating."
[V],-jonny-,2011-01-04T16:13Z,Well I'm glad you like it :)

,3amyxx,2011-06-19T04:07Z,what is the most preferable media player to play it on? thanks
,komfyrion,2011-07-03T18:23Z,"Remember to get a player/plugin compatible with mkv files if the audio is gone. Type "".mkv"" or ""Matroska"" in Google."

,TtToker,2011-12-16T18:49Z,you'd think after downloading 6 1/2 gigs somebody would take 15 seconds to post A/V
,wyup,2012-01-10T15:20Z,"A must have for fans of the movie. Compression is good, although a bit grain related artifacts for 6.5GB 720p in a few dark backgrounds.  Upped 1.3x and counting. Many thanks.
V=9.5 A=10 M=10"
,wyup,2012-01-10T15:34Z,"P.D.: Video quality is very good, i was just splitting hairs.."
