Fallen on hard times, farmer Lewis converts an old bulldozer into a fantastic high-tech â€œdigginâ€ machine. Help him dig up stuff to sell (60+ unique diggings) in a race against the clock to pay the mortgage and save the farm (campaign mode).

In addition there are 8 mini-game challenge matches, plus open-ended free play mode and even a tutorial game mode for beginners, offering hours of game play.

Manage fuel, temperature, and damage while searching for diggins. Sell them at the farmhouse to earn cash. Save cash to pay the mortgage, upgrade your digger, or make repairs. Use the on-screen â€œanalogâ€ joystick, or touch-screen to control digger movement. Watch out for rocks and caverns that disrupt your path. Have fun!
