     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      Gary, Jacko, Charlie and Adam have completed their latest
      tour of duty in Afghanistan and arrive at the aircraft hangar
      ready to be taken home, only to be told their flight has already
      left. Faced with waiting another 12 hours in a hot, cramped
      hangar, Gary decides to try and bribe his way onto an earlier
      flight using a pretty uninspiring collection of belongings from
      the boys. He's been turned down by the RAF as well as most of
      the squaddies in the hangar until finally he meets Cammy, a
      squaddie with an impeccable sales pitch and an offer Gary
      mistakenly thinks is too good to be true.
