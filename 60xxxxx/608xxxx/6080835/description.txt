Stephen Tompkinson goes deep into northern Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park in search of the mighty mountain gorilla and meets local Pygmy tribesmen who are changing from poachers into gamekeepers. His next stop is Kafue National Park in Zambia. Passing over Victoria Falls, he visits Shiwa Ng'andu, which was built by Sir Stewart Gore-Browne in the early 1900s and looks like an English country house complete with lawns and rosebeds. Then he heads to Botswana and the Okavango Delta.
