This audio is perfect! :) "
,e-Marc,2011-08-07T23:39Z,"well, lets say, sound is ok, but not exactly crystal clear. sounds a little like 64 kbps."
,cladiel,2012-04-22T15:00Z,"the audio is *far* from perfect. it really does sound very low quality. (if you don't believe me, try the old aXXo rip)

but thank you anyway, for you effort. :)"
