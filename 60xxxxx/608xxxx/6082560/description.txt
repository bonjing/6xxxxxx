In the music written in England around 1600, the lute song is virtually unique, for although the madrigal and instrumental
music have counterparts in Continental countries (and in Italy especially), songs accompanied by lute alone are a largely
English phenomenon. (Later, in deference to the new Italian fashion of basso continuo, a viol was added to the lute). Undoubtedly
the ï¬‚owering of English poetry in late Elizabethan times contributed to the lute song, as German lyric poetry from the late
eighteenth century onwards contributed to the birth of the German Lied. In the lutenistâ€™s case the poetry was frequently much
more closely associated with the music, for sometimes poet and composer were one and the same person (Campion certainly was, and
Dowland seems likely to have been).
