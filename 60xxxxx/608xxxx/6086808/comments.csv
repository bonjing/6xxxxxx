Welcome to the world of BluRay."
[T],insinuendo,2011-01-07T02:24Z,"Considering the length, bitrate and audio, 17Gs is reasonable...

Welcome to the world of HD :)"
,jimraso,2011-01-07T02:25Z,"pberry, the movie is almost 4 hours long, that is why it is over 17gb. It's the last movie Sergio Leone made, and it is a classic. "
,jimraso,2011-01-07T02:27Z,"Thanks for the UL, Insinuedo"

,Zartrauch,2011-07-13T01:29Z,"How come this torrent has a -15 rating?

I thought it was my laptop which was causing trouble playing this properly, but could it be I'm not the only one having those problems? It just lags from time to time. (even though I updated K-Lite Codec Pack)"
,levarnaud,2011-08-28T19:17Z,"same problem here, it seems that there is data missing or something"
,solszew,2012-04-12T01:56Z,"This torrent only plays to just over 3 minutes before freezing on VLC/Mac.  I can move the indicator past this point, but the movie never advances.  Bummer."
