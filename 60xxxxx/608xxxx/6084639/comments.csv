,bago3k,2011-01-22T20:20Z,"I hate the way things holywood inclined, on this marvelous movie presents Micky Ward won a Mexican, where historically we know that that fight was arranged for ward win in Las Vegas, curiously does not show the fight of the few Ward lost, also against a Mexican, just before the fight with neary in which he won."

,loftur10,2011-01-27T16:37Z,Got an e-mail from paramount pictures...
,oakmario,2011-01-30T08:27Z,"Won't play on a PS3. PS3 is recognizing the file and container as valid, but when you press play on the movie, it doesn't playback anything. It just stays on a black screen and the info shows only -- -- for time. No sound, no picture.

Seems the PS3 can't understand the codec used inside the .mp4 container?

Please provide a file that can playback on the PS3. Thanks."
,jlh1976,2011-01-30T21:04Z,"Doesn't play on the PS3.

Also, Comcast threatened to kill my internet because I downloaded a pirated movie.

I have peer guardian/PeerBlock running so it shows how well it works.

Just a warning."

,neowonder,2011-02-06T10:54Z,"I can't believe people give this video/audio 9! The movie is excellent, definitely 10! But video is 4 and audio is 6. Download different torrents for this movie. E.g. 'The Fighter (2010) SCR XviD By MegaPlay'"
,bigwigg001,2011-07-20T19:54Z,Thank you very much.
,DaNtsu,2011-08-14T20:43Z,"Thanks for upload!

Although I must report in that it didn't met my usual expectations for a kingdom release.. This clearly is screener quality, and sadly far from a V/A10. What really annoys me though is the fuzzy distortion on the right side throughout the movie.  (White lightning-styled stuff that sparks up occasionally)

CTRL+E in VLC to bring out the options to crop out 2-3 pixel rows is how to fix it if you still want to download this release/already have."
,seedlikecrazy,2011-12-11T23:57Z,I don't give a flying fuck if paramount is sending emails to people who download it. I'm not american anyway.
