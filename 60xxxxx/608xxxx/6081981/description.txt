Carly Simon Never Been Gone(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_________________________________________

I have always found the title song of this album, in its original form, 
probably the most beautiful of Carly's repertoire ... especially when 
done live in the twilight of Martha's Vineyard. 

So, on first listening, i was actually a little disappointed, but then 
i played Let The River Run, brilliant. 

Then The Right Thing To Do, where Ben's voice is a hauntingly clear 
addition, and the revisions give it so much more, especially at the end, 
Hallelujah. Hallelujah quite magnificent. 

The Latino influence infused into It Happens Every Day brings a new 
dimension to such a familar lilting ballad. 

Boys In The Trees is more pregnant than the cover shot on the original 
album of the same title 

I still prefer the virginal rawness of Never Been Gone from Spy all those 
years ago (1979?) but despite this mildest of reservations, this is a 5-star 
album collection of essentially 12 NEW songs, that plays to the hearts of 
all Carly afficianados. 

But it should and will appeal to many many more who are not so familar with 
the range and quality of all that work that lies behind the more obvious hits.
