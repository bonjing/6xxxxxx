,vivatpb5776,2011-06-05T14:55Z,"@leanne1990: I doubt you will see this but you were probably listening to the wrong audio stream. In laymen terms, you were listening to the commentary track instead of the movie track. The media player you are using should have settings to change the audio track.

The video and audio quality was very good. Unfortunately, the uploader took it upon himself/herself to add, ""Encoded by: 20-40"" to the movie. It appears within the first 30 seconds of the movie and it stays on the screen for about 10 seconds. It does not affect the overall movie experience. I tried multiple options to remove the wording with no success. So, either deal with it or get another version. "
,Sarmatae1,2011-08-03T13:20Z,"Excellent download. Thank you twentyforty for your time and effort.

Side Note** An attempt to play in Windows Media Player v. accompanying Windows 7 is going to ""flatten"" the audio and video tracks, giving you the audio commentary file with the video. The torrent default is formatted in mp4  and WMP won't separate it for you. I recommend a player like DivX or better still, VLC where you can control what audio tracks are played, including subtitle, or .srt extensions.

Go here to download the free VLC player (in my opinion, the best free player available): http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

Once installed, go to the movie file, right click and ""Open With"" VLC media player. Let the film start playing then go to the tool bar at the top of the screen and click on ""Video"". Select ""Subtitles Track"" from the dropdown menu, then click ""Track 1"", or ""Disable"". I've already forgotten what I did, lol. It doesn't matter. If when you get the dropdown for ""Subtitles Track"" and it gives you multiple options, just click through them until you find the right one. The VLC player plays audio and video tracks separately and lets you select what combination you want, so you can't fuck it up. The trick is to give it a second. Let the movie play for a few seconds, then click ""Video"", every time you change an option, let it play for a few seconds and it'll show up. 

I downloaded a few of these torrents and this is the best one. Get it and work it out."

,timbear91,2011-08-06T20:53Z,"@Sarmatae1: Thanks so much. I started playing in WMP (I have Windows 7) and I heard them talking and I was at a loss as to what I should do, so I came back to TPB and thankfully, seen your comment. I've been putting off downloading VLC because I didn't believe it to be any different, or better, but now that I have it, I can tell the difference. I love it! Thanks again."
