Drill 1 includes many key techniques and skills which can help you to develop your own individual style incorporating many different chapters which are all narrated to give an explained view of the DVD content. As well as just teaching you how the kite is handled and also the ins and outs of using a board safely. 

Drill 1 goes into the types of boards, and kites which are specific for your needs and will help you to make tough choice of which equipment is best for you. 
Drill 1 does not promise to make you a pro! But it will help you on your way to becoming the best kiteboarder you can be.
