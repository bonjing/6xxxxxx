     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      A rare opportunity to poke around inside the heads of Father
      Ted creators Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews and find out who
      they admire and where they draw their inspiration from. Every
      comedy writer has been influenced in some way by what came
      before, and they are certainly no different. By revealing what
      makes up their own comedy DNA, they show what inspired them to
      create Father Ted and the rest of the Craggy Islanders. There
      are clips from some comedy classics that you would expect - such
      as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses, Seinfeld and The
      Simpsons- as well as weird stuff from the real world which
      inspired some of their favourite characters. They discuss the
      comedians and stand-ups, the priests, politicians and Irish
      beauty pageants which have directly influenced their comedy
      world, as well as their obsession with the feature film The
      Heartbreak Kid - also being shown on C4 as part of Father Ted
      Night, lst January, 2011.
