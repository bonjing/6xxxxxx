,npulgar,2012-01-01T13:58Z,"Great compilation but MANY songs are damaged. I finally deleted it from my ipod
Don't download it

Gran seleccion musical pero muchas canciones estan daĂąadas, con saltos y mal nombradas.

Me di la tarea de corregir muchas cosas pero finalmente la eliminĂŠ. 

Sugerencia: no la descargue"
