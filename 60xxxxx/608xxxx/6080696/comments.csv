I'm using CCCP and MPC-HC"
,Lasoyxe,2011-03-21T20:54Z,It's against the RUURUUS to have so few people seeding! Fix this please. :3
,Lasoyxe,2011-03-21T22:37Z,"Son, I am disappoint!
So few seeders. More seeders please.

,Persona_Alio,2011-06-23T23:20Z,"Videos work fine with subtitles in VLC (and even Windows Media Player 12, goodness)."
,Porksauce,2011-07-05T14:55Z,"I notice that accented characters in the subtitles are missing. Other than that, it's fine."
