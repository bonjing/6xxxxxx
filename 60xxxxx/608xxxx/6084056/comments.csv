ZygorLevelingAllianceCATA.lua i'm not 100% sure but seems to be outdated too compared to that same version.

The rest of the guides, seem to be the latest ones.

No Virus or alien/modified files btw."
,Xyrec,2011-01-06T14:51Z,"Then the Zygor Team messed something up, this is updated directly through their Updater."
,TPBrullz,2011-01-06T15:14Z,"Yeah, that's probably the reason the other guy with this version here on TPB also had the guides outdated.

This one is still better than that one and apart from the files i mentioned, it is up to date.

What i did was just keep the updated guides and the addon from this one and the outdated guides i trashed them and use the ones from 1625 instead."
,TheFreeRevolution,2011-01-06T21:54Z,"Hey Xyrec I love the guide uploads there great!

Just wondering the Dailys guide seems to be out of date (the Crusader Title one>Rep Guide) as it isn't updated for Cata (still shows old zone quests) don't know if this is Zygor or your problem.

Qouted from website

''ETA on Dailies Upgrades:
------------------------------
Either the end of this week, or early next week. We're aiming for a
January 7th release date and will do our very best to get them out
by then.''

Just wondering if you will update the dailys with the Cata Dailys, I think it is a free update as it says ''Full Cataclysm update with purchase'' but im not sure.

Thanks again for the upload! :) "
,Xyrec,2011-01-06T22:36Z,"Of course, I'll upload as soon as I have time for it. :)"
,honorship,2011-01-10T06:34Z,"Xyrec thanks a lot for the guide.
