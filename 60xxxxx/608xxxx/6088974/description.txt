All the apps that i have installed on my Galaxy S at the moment including the full monty OCLF for galaxy S that you cant get anymore on Android market because of its root capabilities.
All Apps are working on my Galaxy S with 2.2.1 Froyo Firmware.
All paid apps have keys apart from Telmap Navigator for which you can get a Beta serial here.http://global.telmap.com/tugpcbeta/
The Applanet app is the latest version as of the list date.
All of the apps are the current versions and do not need updating as of first date of seed..
Just dump them on your phone SD card and browse using "my files" or "Astro" to launch the APK files.
Have fun and feel free to just pinch a couple of apps if you dont like the package but please do seed as long as you can.. ;)
