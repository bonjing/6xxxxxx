""Sony Vegas pro 10.0c x64bit.rar"";""Virus found Win32/NSAnti"";""Moved to Virus Vault""
""Sony Vegas pro 10.0c x32bit.rar"";""Virus found Win32/NSAnti"";""Moved to Virus Vault""

I'm not taking a chance on opening this, for fear of future time bombs...sorry Webchella.

FYI: Adobe Premiere Elements 10_0 UK (download torrent) - TPB kept crashing my laptop during the AVG scan, as did 2 direct download programs - they're all deleted now, unfortunately. "
