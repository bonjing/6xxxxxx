What's up with that and how can I fix it?

Oh and thanks for putting up this game. It's legendary!"

I've tried typing in gibberish, ""x"", and just hitting enter, (which message boards suggest) none of them work."
,byrn,2011-01-17T22:53Z,"I also get the same crash at the same time w/ Prisoner of Ice, btw."
,ssboy,2011-01-18T18:16Z,Good to hear so it's not just my mac. Well not GOOD to hear but anyways. Huge shame since it's a brilliant game and there's absolutely too few Cthultu games for computer.
,rotfuhr666,2011-01-23T11:30Z,"I had the same trouble with Prisoner of Ice, but got it working. Here's how:

Right-click Prisoner Of Ice (1995).app and select Show package contents. In the new window, go to Contents -> Resources and open the file dosbox.conf in Textedit or similar. On one of the last lines in the file you'll see the following:

pause
c:
ice640

Change this to:

pause
d:
ice640

This will make the game think it loads from the CD, and for some reason that makes it not crash when saving, or when the prisoner starts breaking out."
