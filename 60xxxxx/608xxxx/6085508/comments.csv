,Shriy,2011-01-10T04:41Z,I'm sorry but I don't really understand how to open this. I got as far as downloading it to my uTorrent but I can't figure out where to go from there. Would you mind posting step by step instructions. It would be much appreciated :)

Just download the torrent for PowerISO and follow the instructions included in the torrernt here is the link---
##http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5842489/PowerISO_v4.7___Serials_[ChattChitto_RG]##

That will allow you to burn the iso
Hope that helps"

You can open or install these ISO files without burning it each on CD's. How?
Burn all these ISO files on a data DVD as ISO file. [don't change the extension]. Then install the 'magicISO virtual Disk' (this is free). This wiil install a virtual drive on your computer and also it show an icon on the taskbar area. Now Right-click on the icon on the taskbar and mount the DVD to the desired ISO. Now the ISO will show on the virtual drive. You could install or open these ISO from there. OK."

,NorthernOcean,2011-04-10T19:09Z,"Hi there,

Thanks for all of the great torrents! They are always virus free. :)

Unfortunately, I'm having trouble with this one. I've downloaded the ISO and I've extracted it both through WinRAR and through Magic ISO and I see the setup.exe file, but when I double click on it I receive the following error message ""setup.exe is not a valid Win32 application"". I tried extracting it through two different programs thinking maybe one hadn't extracted it correctly. 

I don't see any .txt files with info in it or with serial numbers so please let me know how to get this program up and running. I really need it today...

Thanks!"
,NorthernOcean,2011-04-13T04:28Z,P.S. I also tried what Xaowx said above. And still no success. Any suggestions?
