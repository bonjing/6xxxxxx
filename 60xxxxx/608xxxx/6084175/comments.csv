,jr153,2011-02-10T00:00Z,"Ive never had any problems with your prgms until now. This version seems to only work for awhile, like a trial version then says ""dvd copy has expired"" plus you can no longer use ""customize"" option anymore. All the versions that say ""dvd copy (gold) seem to expire even though it says ""never expires"". Is there a fix for this? Same thing happens for version 8073.."
