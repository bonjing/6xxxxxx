Downloadspeed was 2.400 kb/s the whole way down. Very glad to see that. Compensates nicely for the giant Torrent.

I hope there are some matching subtitles. Wish me luck. ^^"

Which means, VLC player can read them on my PC. But my Samsung 37"" TV won't.

Rather prefer them seperate and in the video. So you can choose. But eh. 

Still, great job towards the ripper/uploader."
