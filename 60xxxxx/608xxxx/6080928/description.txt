"Nikki Heat"

Castle's novel "Heat Wave" is being turned 
into a movie, and the Hollywood hottie cast 
as the movie's lead shows up at Beckett's 
invitation to better understand the 
character she's going to play. Laura Prepon 
("October Road," "That 70s Show") guest 
stars as actress Natalie Rhodes. As our 
threesome investigates the murder of a 
high-class matchmaker, Natalie goes to 
extremes in the name of "character 
research," transforming herself into the 
spitting image of Beckett -- much to 
Castle's delight and Beckett's dismay.

Enjoy :)
