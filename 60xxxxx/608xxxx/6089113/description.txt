New Delhi, 1999. The guns at Kargil are still blazing when another one goes off, this time in the nationâ€™s capital. Jessica, a young attractive model trying her hand at bartending, is shot dead at a celebrity party. Her crime â€“ refusing to serve a drink after closing hours! The culprit Manish, son of a prominent politician, inebriated by a deadly cocktail of alcohol and a sense of entitlement, pulls the trigger in a fit of rage. With 300 of Delhiâ€™s swish set present at the party, many of whom are witnesses to the murder, Manish looks all set to go to the gallows. Except, that it doesnâ€™t quite turn out that way! Now two women, Jessicaâ€™s sister, Sabrina and the feisty TV reporter, Meera will have to drum up every resource at their disposal to outwit Manish at his own game, if the truth is to have any chance of prevailing over money and political clout.
