,tina1995,2011-01-26T01:46Z,thanx alot!!! always seeding!!
,ode138,2011-02-03T19:37Z,"As sinand99 alludes to, this is the original festival version with an alternate ending and not the theatrical ending. I'd say the theatrical ending (it's on youtube) is better."
,diggerRACT,2011-06-11T11:56Z,this is bullshit it says its a full movie then once dl it goes past the 22 minute point on pc but when u try to rip to dvd using convertx it says the file is only 22 mins long why wont it come up properly when ur ripping it? but anyway if u put on harddrive or leave on pc good dl but if u want to burn to dvd not worth a pinch of shit a/v = 8 otherwise
