Sometimes setting pen to paper requires bravery, and writing well means breaking free of the rules learned in school.

Unlike â€œhow to writeâ€ books that dwell on the angst and the agony of the trade, Writing Brave and Free is upbeat and accessible. The focus here is the work itself: how to get started and how to keep going, and never is heard a discouraging word such as â€œno,â€ â€œnot,â€ or â€œnever.â€ Because of the wealth of their experience, the authors can offer the sort of practical publishing advice that novices need and yet rarely find.
