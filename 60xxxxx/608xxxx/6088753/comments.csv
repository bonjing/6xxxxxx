I have also uploaded The Sopranos, The Wire, Lost and Dexter (click on my user name to see them) and this beats the lot. Please seed for as long as possible so we can keep this excellent show alive.

Thank you, enjoy."
[V],manOtor,2011-01-16T03:28Z,"Looks like it's WS (+1)
Also Quality is very good:
A 9/10
V 9/10

Even includes the Minisode connecting season 5 and 6.

Thank you especially for this release and ""The Wire"" - 
looks like there indeed are not better torents out there at the moment!
Keep up the good work,

Cheers"

once done ill seed it for at least a month =p"
,ides315,2011-01-25T01:59Z,"Hey - thanks for the upload - but I think there might be some errors with episode 3x14.  It gets wonky at the 32 minute mark for like 10 seconds, and I believe it happens one or two other times in the episodes.  It might also happen in episode 2x01.  I would be immensely grateful for a fixed version of 3x14 (and will provide one if I can get it).  I'll check this torrent for updates!"
,lollop0,2011-02-02T21:22Z,PLEASE SEED! i'm getting .5 kbs!
,GlenIrisSouthpaw,2011-02-06T13:57Z,please seed....I am at 28.3 and it has slowed to .5 kb for me as well.  I will keep it up for a month reseeding after I finish watching.
,kslxmwld,2011-02-12T23:23Z,"This torrent needs more seeders. Looks like many have hit and run, too many leechers compared to seeders. The dl.speed I'm getting is 20kB/s at max, too slow for such a big torrent."
,jayslay2000,2011-02-13T12:16Z,u open my eyes to something new im a wire/ sopranos type dude but dis is good 
[V],meech,2011-02-19T16:47Z,"Sample Episode specs:
Codec =Xvid
Video Bitrate = 972 Kbps
Resolution = 640 x352
Audio = mp3 stereo (128 KBps) 
Size = 350mb
Fps = 25

A little disappointed in the quality, especially due to the way the torrent is advertised.  This is not HD.  The one episode's resolution (640x352), that I downloaded isn't even as high as a normal dvd (720 x 480), let alone 720p (1280x720).

The low bitrate/small size shows by the pixelation in darker areas. And the mp3 sound is tinny. The tags for this torrent include ""HDTV"" and ""Blu ray"".  However, these files aren't even close and have the same specs as the other low-res torrent out there.

These may be good for outputting to a small monitor or ipod, but there's a little bit of false advertising here.  There are higher quality rips out there."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-19T12:53Z,"The picture quality is spot on, as are all the audio files. It's worth pointing out that the guy above has also uploaded The Shield so I wouldn't be surprised if he's found fault with every other upload of The Shield. The speed of this is superb, you can expect upwards of 2MB/S download speed."
[V],meech,2011-03-24T00:48Z,"@Sniffer_V,
If I was trying to get people to download my files instead of these, I would've put a link right in my comment. However, I don't believe in that. I would loved to have downloaded these files and been blown away by the quality that HD offers.  However, they simply aren't as advertised...not even close.  If these weren't falsely advertised, I probably wouldn't have said anything. I just think the downloader should know what they are getting.  If you check out any other shield torrents, you will see that I haven't commented on any of them.  I would have love to have been able to enjoy these and not have to rip them for myself. It was awfully time consuming. The only reason I posted them was because there isn't anything better out there besides the usual old standard 350mb xvid rips. As you see, I don't have near the number of seeders/leechers that you do...nor do I care.  The majority of people will trade quality for smaller files.  It's not a contest.  However you advertised quality that wasn't there.  The specs I quoted in my previous comment were taken straight from mediainfo. The specs don't lie...nor does my t.v. screen. Besides all this, people will still download your torrent, so no worries."
,-wiggidy-,2011-04-01T04:36Z,"I will do what you weren't able to do, Meech.

The quality of this video is absolute shit, and if you download it, you will deeply regret it. Luckily, someone recently upload high quality rips of The Shield, which the torrent scene has needed for a long, long time.

,vivatpb5776,2011-04-03T16:27Z,"Okay, I am going to put this argument to bed. There seems to be a bit of a debate as to whether or not this .torrent is (1) of the quality that the uploader states and (2) is as of the same quality that is purported.

Full disclosure: I already have the entire series and I am using this as the control.

TSV has done very well with this .torrent. Not only is the quality on par with the DVD and, quite frankly, the other .torrent that is referenced in the previous post but the file extension is .avi which is more common and popular than .mkv (which is what the other .torrent has).

Additionally, there are no embedded subtitles. Whether one can turn off the subtitles is irrelevant. I would rather not have embedded subtitles unless the movie/show warrants it.

Overall, this is an excellent download and I thank you TSV for uploading it."

You are painfully transparent"
,Danbouges,2011-05-09T01:31Z,"This is crazy. People look at the facts. DVD quality is 720X480. This is whatverx352. That IS NOT DVD QUALITY. What else do you want..... how is ""Meech"" being ""transparent"" by simply stating facts??? His is way better than this... The quality sucks ass, even worse than most 600x352 poseur xvid asscrap. This guy should be ashamed of himself labeling this HD. You can't just decide what you want to call HD. HD is 720p or 1080p period. That is the final file. If you rip from 720p, but your file is 352p. You are 352p. ""meech"" is trying to help only to be attacked by silly children. The guy who claims this to be equivalent to meech's copy and the dvd is sorely mistaken. Dvd is 480p this is 352p, and it sucks. Oftentimes 352p vids look decent, not this. It is very Horrible.

,Danbouges,2011-05-09T01:36Z,"O ya, ""toilet Sniffer."" ""Meech"" it doesn't matter if your bullshit is ""SPOT ON"", which it isn't, you still MISLABELED it as HD. High Definition is 720p or 1080p , not toilet freaking sniffer's personal definition of ""SPOT ON VIDEO""    I am perplexed children that want shitty tiny files for their ipod's outnumber adults that want decent files for a real setup. 
FINAL ANSWER: 1. If you have a JOB, and are an ADULT. you must either already have a good comp and LCD or can afford it, you don't want these, they really suck.

2.IF you go to SCHOOL, and are a CHILD you must have a xbox or ps3 or ipod, therefore you want small files and .avi. This is to show your freinds the ""cool cusswords on the shield"" These files are for you, they are horrible, but won't take up much space on your ipod next to your rap videos."
,darkshanker,2011-06-09T19:52Z,"@Danbouges

His shameless self-promotion is transparent...did you really need that pointed out for you?  Apparently everyone downloading episodes of The Shield needs to be re-informed in the comments section of the torrent that some jackass has a higher quality torrent available for download.  I suppose when the vast majority of your time is spent in front of your computer watching TV shows, it would be only natural to assume that everyone else watching has the same morbid fascination and attention to detail as you.  Maybe you would better serve your fans by not making some lame attempt at hijacking someone else's torrent to make yourself feel good.  I'm quite sure people downloading here are quite capable of making their own decisions regarding what quality level of video they wish to download."

,AwiAwiAwi,2011-08-03T18:30Z,"TSV thanks for this amazing torrent, was wondering however if you know if there are any matching subs out there for your rip? Right now I only looked for subs for season 1, as I'm just starting to watch this show, so I dont know if the other seasons got matching subs anywhere on the net. But subs for at least season 1 would be amazing."

What the fuck is your deal? How is Meech unjustified in pointing out that this release is mislabeled? Would you have refrained from bitching if Meech wasn't the uploader of a different torrent? Get off your high horse.

And, ""morbid attention to detail""? Don't be picking on others just because your eyesight is apparently shit."

The video files are not in bad quality, but truth be said, they're not HD either as stated in the description.
Also, it says that we won't find a better torrent, but there was already one very much like this, although not on the PirateBay.
It can be found at isohnt or demnoid (can't paste the links). And almost all the files (episodes) from this previous torrent are the same, except for Season 1 and the Extended Episode on season 5.

Other thing I don't understand is why people need to remove the release name from the episodes.
I don't know which release is Season 1, but the other ones are as follows:

The.Shield.S02.AC3.WS.DVDRip.XviD-FoV
The.Shield.S03.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS
The.Shield.S04.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS
The.Shield.S05.WS.DVDRip.XviD-SAiNTS

Thanks for your effort(whoever made this torrent), but if you keep making these errors your reputation will suffer.  I think I'll finish the rest of the seasons through a different torrent.  No sense risking more frustration with your upload.  If I run into your torrents in the future, I'll be sure to look elsewhere."

Okay, I am going to put this argument to bed. 

-No, you are just giving yet another opinion

There seems to be a bit of a debate as to whether or not this .torrent is (1) of the quality that the uploader states and (2) is as of the same quality that is purported.

-and you are actually going to avoid answering both those questions

Full disclosure: I already have the entire series and I am using this as the control.

-we don't care

TSV has done very well with this .torrent. Not only is the quality on par with the DVD and, quite frankly, the other .torrent that is referenced in the previous post but the file extension is .avi which is more common and popular than .mkv (which is what the other .torrent has).

-see? you didn't answer the two questions you said you would! we don't care which format you like, this is NOT HDTV. 
-also, avi is out of date. it's ugly, it's pixellated. mkv is the new standard.

Additionally, there are no embedded subtitles. Whether one can turn off the subtitles is irrelevant. I would rather not have embedded subtitles unless the movie/show warrants it.

-are you totally stupid? even if you can turn them off, you would rather not have them? give ONE good reason for such an idiotic claim. can't afford the 75kb? have ADD and must scrub files clean of subtitles or you start sweating?

-at least answer the two damn questions you made your post for

-by the way, GET THIS INSTEAD:
