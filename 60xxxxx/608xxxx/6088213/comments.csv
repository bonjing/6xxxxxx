thanks for the up"
,McRath,2011-02-20T12:41Z,"Great quality as always.
The movie however was pure crap. If you want to see Edward Norton attempt to play a black man in prison then watch this film. Seriously this movie could be labeled a comedy with the amount of times i laughed at Norton's cornrows"
,kidas,2011-03-01T23:33Z,I downloaded this movie and went to put it on a disc but it wont play it says something about the format how can I get it to play from a cd I have this problems with other movies to.

,keepitsmpl,2011-04-08T01:03Z,"@ kidas:
Have you tried DVDs? What are you playing it on?"
,thetenfold,2011-05-14T02:36Z,"whatever you uploaded it in isnt allowing me to burn to dvd. it keeps saying

There is not enough space to burn this compilation. Please insert another disc that has enough space

on an empty dvd (and i tried 2 different ones).
whenever this happens, i usually re-encode it in divx or something and try burning again and it works, but however it was encoded, its calculating the size wrong and is always too big for the dvd. i dont have the time to do that now though.
anyone know why it happens?"
,ButtMonkey123,2011-05-20T20:43Z,"Great upload

,Canadianseeder,2012-01-30T14:09Z,if you plan on burning any movies i suggest using convertX to DVD 3 great program automatically converts and burns allows you to delete or add subtitle streams anyways check it out. thanks FXG!
