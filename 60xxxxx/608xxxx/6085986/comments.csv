If there is a faster way to seed this to the rest of the world besides my own upload connection feel free to give me some tips and info.

Hope you enjoy :)"
,bmdj92,2011-01-06T16:54Z,"Do you mean the Turkish version? If it's good, I'll keep seeding, since I'm having little luck with the other Turkish to English download..."
,jojos22,2011-01-06T17:45Z,"Its this video:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6076506/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows__Part_1_HQ_NEW_CAM_720P

With english audio :)

So yeah your right the turkish one ^^"
,jojos22,2011-01-06T17:48Z,"Im seeing that people are around 40% allready so hopefully soon more people can seed this one.

P.S: If you founded the turkish video quality not good then dont bother downloading this one, just as reminder :)"
,oldred18,2011-01-06T18:03Z,well
,bmdj92,2011-01-06T18:17Z,The Turkish one has probably the better video qualities available - I'm at 56% right now and will seed (to the best of my uploading speed) if decent :) Thanks for the effort and upload!
,oldred18,2011-01-06T18:26Z,its still downloading at a good pace
,jenchai,2011-01-06T18:43Z,"Its downloading at seriously good pace. In about an hour or two most people will have this. Lets just hope, the audio syncronisation is good."
,oldred18,2011-01-06T18:57Z,at 55 % now thanks for the up.
,oldred18,2011-01-06T19:04Z,i should have it in the next hour and i will keep seeding.
,bmdj92,2011-01-06T19:41Z,Thank you - I also should be done in the next hour or less. I will seed as best as my internet will allow me. 
,oldred18,2011-01-06T20:01Z,i will have it an a half an hour
,oldred18,2011-01-06T20:06Z,audio and video is off a little but thanks for the upload will keep seeding.
,jenchai,2011-01-06T20:21Z,"Fisrt of all, thanks jojos22 for the hard work. The audio is very difficult to syncronise so, thanks for your work. 

Audio: It still 1s here and there but definitely worth it.

Video: The best available on net till yet. Very close to TS.

I wish the Sabi96 version to be up soon, as that one looked almost perfect syncronised and also better video (2.5 Gb file size).

,oldred18,2011-01-07T00:13Z,can someone plzz tell me how i could get the audio to sync better. and great job jojos22 for the up thanks man.
,bmdj92,2011-01-07T00:56Z,Video is great and audio is great but out of sync :( Is there any way to fix that? 
,oldred18,2011-01-07T03:25Z,anyone know of any program that can help since the audio.
,oldred18,2011-01-07T03:44Z,sorry mean sync my bad
,oldred18,2011-01-07T03:52Z,okay
,bmdj92,2011-01-07T04:30Z,...
,jojos22,2011-01-07T09:28Z,"i for myself used virtualdub.
The prob with this audiostream was that it was a variable bitrate, so shitloads of edditing with minimal (mili)seconds needed to be done.
I did my best to sync it the best i could, but i bet there are people that can do it even better then me :)
Perhaps there are also better programs which can be used."
