,Mathlol,2011-03-10T14:28Z,"i wonder if aoloffline's realized that in the high size rips, jonny does a better job.  The high bit rate and ludicrous size isn't fooling anyone."
,kinvore,2011-05-04T21:34Z,Thanks for the upload.
,IkkuHihi,2011-05-28T20:25Z,"Awesome quality, but at 3/4 of the movie the sound is off... Or maybe it's my media player (Mede8er MED500X) having trouble playing this file but I don't think so...

Good sound, good picture, and full screen 16x9, which I find more pleasant than wide images with black bars. No sound or sync issues. Picture wasn't super clear, but for what it is, (free copy), going to enjoy for years. Thanks uploader!"
,zorn1,2011-12-09T07:03Z,"Quality was great, along with the movie. Thanks for sharing!"

Just to say a big Thank you, your movies are all great quality and I'm so thankfull for it. Please continue the good work, ignore the haters. I play your movies on a WDTV to my 40inch TV, all flawless, video and sound. Much better than 2g brrips."
