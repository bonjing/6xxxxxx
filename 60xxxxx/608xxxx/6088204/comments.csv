[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T19:41Z,"@prank0007: Maybe tomorrow or Sunday, I have the movie but no free slots. Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T20:04Z,"@DevSIN: Requested by muthineni (2011-01-04 12:25 CET).
Weekend started."
,prank0007,2011-01-07T20:10Z,thnks bro take ur time can w8
,abhiG82,2011-01-07T20:18Z,awesome awesome upload. was dying to see a 720p bluray rip of this amazing movie. you are the real *hero*
,dark_defender,2011-01-07T22:34Z,"Hi 20-40,
This is a great movie. Thanks for the encode and upload. Though i will give it a miss as i have already seen it but thanks anyway.

Any chance of 8 1/2 in near future? Dint mean to bother you with the question as i know you will when you can."
,ama332,2011-01-07T22:58Z,"As always, amazing stuff. Thanks for everything.

Whenever you have a free moment (slot), a request 
Ip Man (2008) - http://imdb.com/title/tt1220719/
Ip Man 2 (2010) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386932/

Bluray 720p would be great. No rush, just titles I've heard good things about.

Big fan of your work, thank you for the consideration."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-07T23:44Z,"@dark_defender: I said ""on weekends"" and weekend would be. 8 and half was encoded on  same day we agreed upon format. Right now is in upload queue, right after True Grit 1969, and this mean 16 hours of upload and then - IF FREE slot appears, upping the torrent.

Best guess would be some 20-24 hours from now.

@ama332: Both movies have been done less than six moths ago and I do not have BluRays anymore.
Simply sayin' - it is not in plans I have."
,dark_defender,2011-01-08T00:16Z,"@twentyforty:I somehow missed when you said you will do it on weekends. But now i know so won't bother you again with such rhetorical ques. 20-24 hrs is not at all a long time and even if it exceeds i am in no hurry.

Thanks for all your great work and efforts. I really appreciate it."
,muthineni,2011-01-08T05:00Z,"my request.

Ip man 1,2 surely the best chinese movies.i was blown by the plot n martial arts shown in the movie.its chinese so eng sub will help.find sources but worthy of seeing"
,FigonaPetter,2011-01-14T15:56Z,"This movie is just incredible. I was amazed first time I watched it. Very special movie indeed.
N1 post 20-40."
,knightfree,2011-02-10T06:15Z,Extremely poor video in last 30 minutes.
,KLASS1234,2011-02-21T07:12Z,Excellent quality!
,blipoids,2011-03-06T23:55Z,"Playback quickly degrades to 'unwatchable' after ~25 minutes on the timeline... 

Would not recommend torrent. Also - could only watch it with VLC - so I don't think it's h264, because Quicktime should support it... and I could not achieve playback with that. "
,blipoids,2011-03-07T00:17Z,"ERRATA: the file does play... somehow. Removed all redundant subtitles from the folder, tried a different player (the more obscure the better). If the movie skips just relaunch your movie player and skip to the where you left off. Hope I can make it play through to the end... but still, why so complicated?"
,drgs701,2011-05-17T16:24Z,thx for upload
,ColinReste,2011-07-13T13:19Z,"Wow twentyforty, look at all the cretins kissing your ass! What a bunch of fucking pansies they are!

And I don't think this is blu-ray as the file size should be much larger."

Thanks, twentyforty!"
,IAmTorrenter,2011-11-04T12:09Z,"uhmmm where are the subtitles'?
i have tried in VLC and WMP but none of them show the subtitles even with subtitles on.."
,artplant,2011-11-30T19:46Z,"@collinreste: You will be surprised, asshole. The source is BR, recoded to 1280 x 960, removed all that different language shit and voila - not BR, but excelent HD ready quality at very reasonable DL time and storage space. 

@Iamtorrenter: try pot player. best in town, for sure. 

@knightfree & blipoids: I see no degradation in film quality in last 30 minutes ... again, pot player. :)"
,pepper150,2012-02-10T07:29Z,Shittest ending ever. endings like that make me regret wasting like 2 hours on the movie.
