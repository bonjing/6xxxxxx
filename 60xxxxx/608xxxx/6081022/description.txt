The annual collection of newspapers comic strips I liked enough to save, ranging from the classics (Garfield, Dilbert, Peanuts, Calvin and Hobbes) to new (Ink Pen, F Minus, Cul de Sac, Brewster Rockit).

2005-2009 are in a separate zip archive and are the same ones I uploaded in previous years. Enjoy!
