================
PCBoost 4 increases computer performance by allocating higher portions of CPU power to active applications and games. PCBoost is a revolutionary product which enhances processor intensive software to run at even faster speeds. Very easy to use, fully compliant with all versions of Microsoft Â® Windows and compatible with most software. With PCBoost your computer will run faster than ever before. Boost the performance of your PC the easy way.

PCBoost allows you to run programs such as games, video editing software and any software that requires large amounts of processing power to run much faster than the software was originally designed for. With little to no effort you can easily make programs & games run faster on your computer without having to purchase a new computer. Most programs are designed to use a minimal amount of CPU (processor) power which often leads to the CPU being idle and not used to its fullest potential, with PCBoost your computer is able to take advantage of this by allocating more CPU power to the currently active application.
PCBoost automatically takes care of allocating more processing power to applications without you having to lift a single finger. Our software runs in the background and automatically monitors which application becomes the foreground active program, it then raises the CPU priority for this application and also assigns the application to run on a processor core that has more power available to it, this instructs the processor that this application must be taken care of before any other application and allowing it to run faster.

Features:
- Optimizes games and applications by increasing the processor priority thread of the currently active application, allowing these programs to run faster.
- Runs in the background, which allows the software to run quietly and accelerate applications without user interaction.
- New ideal processor setting automatically sets applications to use processor cores that are not being fully utilized.
- Processor benchmark test feature has been added in to get an estimate of how fast and stable your computer processor is.
- Built-in and fully editable block list of applications which are not compatible, to prevent problems with the software such as slowdowns or computer crashes.
- New and improved modern user interface, easy and intuitive to use and compliant with Windows user interface guidelines.
- Software supports multiple languages and translations of all visible text to allow users all over the world to use PCBoost in their native language.
