     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      To celebrate a decade on Channel 4, Kirstie Allsopp and Phil
      Spencer present an illuminating and nostalgic look back over the
      last ten years of the UK property market. From the soaring
      property prices of the Millennium to the era of 125% mortgages,
      and from the buy-to-let boom to the credit crunch, this show
      revisits the stories of four former property buyers, and hears
      from some of the country's foremost property experts, to
      illustrate the key moments in the last decade. The show also
      returns to Phil and Kirstie's first ever programme, as the duo
      reveal some of the lessons they've learnt along the way. How
      times, and outfits, have changed.
