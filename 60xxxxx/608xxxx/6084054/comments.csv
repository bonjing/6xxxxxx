,datgirl731,2011-01-08T13:04Z,There is a Trojan Horse that AVG found in the following file after the installation was completed (I don't know if it shows up before the installation.) The Trojan Horse is called Backdoor.Hackdoor.R  It is in the file called Office 2010 Activation and Conversion Kit 1.6.exe 
[V],thethingy,2011-01-08T13:32Z,"datgirl731, if you must post crap do so on the correct torrent, this is NOT Office 2010 Activation and Conversion Kit 1.6.exe nor does it have it in it, in fact that is not even one of the activators I link too, so piss off and post your garbage on the other up loaders page. "
,Kllez,2011-01-11T21:32Z,"Wow, really fast download (more than 1MB/s), downloaded in less than 5 minutes.

Scanned with Avast! and MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware: nothing found.

I'm installing it right now, doesn't seem to have any problem to date.

Thanks a lot, thethingy."

,Rolekewl,2011-02-28T15:09Z,"I am really sorry to say this but this didn't work.Nor Excel,Powerpoint and OneNote worked.

First I disconnected my internet connection.Then I ran setup.exe from each of 4 iso. files and I installed them.I activated them with WOAT_V3.2.But when I tried to use them activation window appeared.

Your torrents usually work,but none of the office torrents ever worked for me.What to do?"
,Rolekewl,2011-02-28T16:04Z,"For some unknown reason Excel,OneNote and Word started working,and for another unknown reason Powerpoint in not.

But thanks a lot anyways.giving you 1+ on quality of Word,Excel,OneNote and WOAT. :D"

Above the white box with the info there is a green link that says ""Download this torrent"", click it."
,muabdulla,2011-04-14T20:29Z,"@Protential
this is not direct download, you need a torrent download client such as utorrent to dowload this......"
,killerseemore,2011-04-16T02:50Z,"@datgirl731 
 The Trojan Horse called ""Backdoor.Hackdoor.R"" also means that AVG 9 knows that you have a pirated a copy of something and registers it as a Threat. Thats why you check it to allow the download and then you scan when done. plus dont run it like a noob before scanning it or you'll likely get a Virus.
For a better security i suggest CA security or Avast "
,Kanga666,2011-04-18T12:21Z,Thanks thethingy. Works perfectly!

And the instructions for the first screen are incorrect.  I know you say it is an example but I don't get past the key entry screen."
