,listenherenow,2011-09-16T09:20Z,"wonder what the deal is with this. my Kid wants this and some song tahts a single track called Oh Darling with the plug in stereo and cady groves and i can't find it anywhere. 

   I mean , I can find it but i can't load it. no one is seeding anywhere.   

 I suspect that it's so terrible no one even ants ot on his/her hard drive - OR   somehow they have some wicked control over this music. 

  at any rate.   I have NEVER had any troubles getting anything till now. LOL  

i'm showing 89 peers, 27 of them online present, and Not one of them has even one kb of this damned album. 

   how crazy is that?

Plug-in Stereo is a YouTube Singer, he isn't actually on a recorded studio track. You'll have to download the song from YouTube or iTunes."
