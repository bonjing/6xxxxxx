,mr.srohit,2011-02-17T19:31Z,"Dear james003,
Hey! I am the same guy who wrote the first comment regarding the website where we can watch/download Penguins Of Madagascar episodes for free. Well thanks for giving me the website.. There are some other shows that have been aired long back but I would like to see them again / download them. Their torrents are all dead. Do you know a website from where we can watch/download their episodes from. 
The shows are as follows :
1) Dragon Ball / Dragon Ball Z / Dragon Ball GT
2) The Mask (Animated Series)
3) Garfield And Friends"
,james003,2011-03-05T23:37Z,"@mr.srohit

1. you can find right here on the PirateBay lots of not dead torrents with Dragonball / Dragonball GT / Dragonball Z 

for example:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5031497/Dragonball_Z_Remastered_all_ep
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5264622/Dragonball_GT_all_episodes

2. I couldn't find The Mask anywhere :(

3. all 7 seasons of Garfield and Friends are available on btjunkie. The PirateBay doesn't allow me to post the direct link, but use search and you should be fine.

There are not many seeds (about 30) but the torrent is alive. Just try downloading 2-3 episodes at a time and you should be fine."
