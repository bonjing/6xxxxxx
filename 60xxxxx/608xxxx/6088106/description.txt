Australian music kicks arse. Always has, always will. We're just glad
that you're all on board for the ride. We here at OZM will continue
to shove Australian music right in your face proving that it's at
equal to and usually better than any other international act.

TEAM OZM SALUTES

the musicians themselves,
our neighbours in the south-west pacific
and our affils.
