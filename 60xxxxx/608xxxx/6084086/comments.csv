Very nice for practice or demo view.

,DaBomb3rZz,2011-02-24T19:45Z,"I'm sorry but why the fuck would you put this on the Pirate bay. The actual full game is fucking FREE! Plus its offline,can you please tell me how this is in anyway useful?"
,corpsegrindermetalhead,2011-08-03T16:48Z,"this sounds fishy. quakelive is a browser based version of quake III arena with updated graphics and more maps. i could use this, because lately my quakelive plugin has been running slow, but why download this when you can just get quake III arena?"
,corpsegrindermetalhead,2011-08-04T03:11Z,"and rochie go suck a big, throbbing, offline quake live cock."
,corpsegrindermetalhead,2011-08-05T02:39Z,"works. this is amazing, how did you do this?"
