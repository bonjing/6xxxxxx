Another intriguing episode of Coast to Coast, running strong into the new year 2011. Alex Jones visits the show in the first hour, and after that it is all about investigating what happens when people die? More research on this never ending subject is accumulating as we speak and books from medical doctors are on the rise. 

Enjoy Australia, America and Europe! :)
