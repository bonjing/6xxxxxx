,stasly,2011-01-04T20:18Z,"and the key, is allright"
,smaruska,2011-01-05T05:54Z,"Wow... one of these keys actually worked for Office Pro Plus 2010.  Had to try each one until I found one that said something like ""cannot activeate due to too many accounts on this serial"" or something along those lines instead of saying invalid.  Then you retry on the phone.  It is all automated and when it asks you how many computers this ID is installed on tell it one.  THEN you get fed a huge number to input and it activates.  I activated 3 copies on the same key tonight woot!"
,castle.stone,2011-01-05T06:55Z,"The key for 2010 Professional Plus worked and it said that it was Activated this afternoon, I just turned on my computer and it is no longer activated.  It won't activate online or on the phone...any ideas?"

,Rilriia,2011-01-30T20:29Z,@Zecreus to activate by phone means that you've purchased software but cannot activate it (enter the reg number) online.
