WinRAR is a 32-bit/64-bit Windows version of RAR Archiver, an archiver and archive manager.
RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can.
WinRAR's main features include strong general and multimedia compression, the ability to process non-RAR archive formats,
ZIP compression and decompression, support for long filenames, programmable self-extracting archives (SFX),
repair of damaged archives, authenticity verification, embedded file comments, and encryption.
Unicode is supported in archive filenames, allowing non-English filenames to be handled painlessly.
You can manipulate the parameters of many archives at once and view a volume sequence as a single archive.
WinRAR can convert other archive formats to RAR and search for specified text and files in archives.
