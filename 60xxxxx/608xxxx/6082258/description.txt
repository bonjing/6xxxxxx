  At the height of nuclear tensions between India 
  and Pakistan, Arjun and his best friend Chabia, 
  weigh their options for the future against the  
  reality of life on the streets of Mumbai. Entice
  by the promise of wealth and opportunity in the 
  Persian Gulf, Chabia is eager to leave his job  
  as a mechanic. But for Arjun, who must finish   
  college and care for his mother, the decision   
  is not so easy in director Partho Sen-Guptaâ€™s   
  gritty,apocalyptic interpretation of Krishnaâ€™s  
  counsel to Arjuna, from the Bhagavad Gita.     Ãž
