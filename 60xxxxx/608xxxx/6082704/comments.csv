I think the French release is actually interlaced, but done so well that I didn't spot any instance of combing.

The funeral scenes as seen on philip minitv has severe freezing issues.

And the first black fade has compression artifacts everywhere.

Again, thanks a million for this.  Amazon.fr charges a limb for this set."
