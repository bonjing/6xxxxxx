Release notes:

Set for release by Universal in October, 2010, and produced by T Bone Burnett,
The Union marks the culmination of a mutual musical adoration that began in the
late 1960s, ahead of Elton's debut US performance in 1970 at The Troubadour Club
in Los Angeles. The album is a collaboration between Elton and Leon Russell,
with songs by Elton and Bernie Taupin; by Elton, Bernie and Leon; by Elton and
Leon and by Leon alone.

The Union was recorded in Los Angeles earlier this year, with guest musicians
including Brian Wilson, Booker T, Don Was and Neil Young. Cameron Crowe has
filmed the sessions for a documentary, creating too a moment of history as this
is the first time that the genesis of Elton's music has been recorded on film.
Critics who have had an early preview of the album are united in praise for the
work that Elton describes as a "Seventies record with a modern feel."

Enjoy!
