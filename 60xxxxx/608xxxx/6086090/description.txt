The modern movement in skiing is progressing more than ever, and it is hard to keep up with the stream. Field Productions has gathered skiers with all different backgrounds , but they all share the same vision about skiing. Yes, skiing is about taking risks to invent new tricks and styles, but most importantly to have fun. â€Eyes Wide Openâ€ gives you both. The movie includes top notch skiing in deep powder, big mountains, city streets and terrain parks featuring many of the most talented athletes out there. Look out for many unseen rail combos by Tom Wallisch and Even Sigstad, bottomless powder at Mica Heli Guides with Ã…smund Thorsen and Eric Hjorleifson, Aksel Lund Svindal in Adamants BC, Jon Olsson attending epic park heli shoots on the most beatiful places in Norway, JT Holmes and Eirk Finseth charging Lake Tahoe, Norwegian invasion in Montafon Austria and much, much more. Some parts of the movie is filmed with the RED One camera, which gives ski movies a whole new meaning.
