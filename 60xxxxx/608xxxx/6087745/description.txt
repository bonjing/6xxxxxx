Use award-winning Adobe Originals typefaces, including one-of-a-kind designs and classic revivals created by expert type designers at Adobe.

Use opticals packages that provide four or more separate designs, each optimized for a different range of point sizes, from small text for footnotes to large type for headlines.

Enjoy updates to the Adobe Type Library, including revisions to many fonts to make them more consistent in layout behavior.

Create for any medium

Print confidently, knowing that Adobe fonts offer reliable quality whether output to inkjet printers, laser printers, imagesetters, or platesetters.

Prepare classic or cutting-edge title effects for all your digital video and multimedia projects.

Revive fine typography with swashes, small caps, and old-style figures â€” glyphs that are now all contained in one OpenType font file.

Publish multilingual documents using OpenType Pro fonts that support Central and Eastern European languages, as well as several that support Japanese, Korean, Greek, and Cyrillic.

Go global with support for Unicode, a platform-independent, international text encoding standard that supports virtually all languages.

Leverage the latest OpenType specification, including support for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). With Adobe Font Folio 11, Adobe continues its longstanding commitment to developing the highest quality OpenType fonts.
