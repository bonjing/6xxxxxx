,aliazez,2011-01-10T16:19Z,"The iso has three separate files:
.ds
.journal
.journal_info_block

I don't know how it works, but these should lead to the folio manager and chose/install fonts rather then copy paste formula. I guess you need to have folio manager installed? "

,gabbyd6277,2011-01-26T22:28Z,"@thethingy

I'm interested in knowing if these typefaces can be considered licensed? Do you think it's possible for someone looking at these fonts to tell they were not purchased? As a graphic design student I hear lots of distaste among the field towards the use of unlicensed fonts. Yet I support piracy and I'm conflicted due to my chosen line of work's negative view on it.

Anyways, just wondered. Very grateful for your torrents, they've helped me save quite a bit of money. Just wondering if I can proudly and openly use these without being harassed/sued-by-clients/etc. :D"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-28T17:01Z,"gabbyd6277, they are licensed but there is no way to tell that you did not buy them. "
,gabbyd6277,2011-01-30T02:42Z,"@thethingy

Thanks for your reply. :]"
,zaiko2000,2011-02-02T17:10Z,"is this different then let's say  the adobe font folio of 5 years ago ?
Thanx for your great work!!!"
,rkpgfx,2011-02-13T02:22Z,thanks
,s4ngu1n,2011-03-08T03:22Z,"I have followed promodsharma's instruction, but to no avail. It simply doesn't copy the fonts. Am I doing anything wrong?
I tried it with the type manager and it says, the file is corrupted or invalid. 
Since everybody else is having a good time, I assume the fault lies with me. Any help?"

Thank you for sharing... "
,2010kaiser,2011-05-22T02:18Z,"s4ngu1n,

        extract the fonts to your desktop. Then go c:\windows\fonts  and either cut and paste them into the fonts folder or drop and drag. They have to go into the windows system fonts folder in order to appear in the photoshop fonts. at least that's the case on my OS (Win XP 3rd Edt.).
Hope this helps."
,ememily,2011-05-25T02:50Z,"Thanks for all your work! I am an American military spouse overseas, and finding a job in Germany is dang near impossible. So I have started taking photos for other Americans so we can stop losing money with the Euro exchange rate. I do a lot of baby photo shoots when one parent is deployed during the birth and homecomings. :D With the programs you uploaded, I am able to make my photos even better. "
,Diazafan,2011-07-07T18:10Z,"LEGEND! one of PBays best uploaders - 'thethingy' !!!

For anyone who has issues with installing/viewing, you view one-at-a-time just by double-clicking any font,then click the 'install' button if you want to install it (providing you are using Win7 that is)

But obviously because there are several thousand fonts here looking @ them one-by-one can be VERY tedious! so I would suggest you get a Font Management software - just google 'font manager' and see which takes your fancy... most allow you to preview uninstalled fonts,look at several fonts at one time,bulk install/uninstall... there's loads to choose from,not many good free programs in my opinion tho... i use FontAgent at the moment and its really good"
,Diazafan,2011-07-07T18:17Z,"LEGEND - 'thethingy' - ONE OF PBAY'S BEST UPLOADERS!

to anyone having problems installing fonts, just search google for 'font management freeware' and pick whichever program takes ur fancy

thanks again!!!!"
,Scotchtape4,2011-07-26T14:15Z,"Greed = Charging $2,500 for a pack of fonts. A pack of fonts. A PACK OF F'N FONTS! Are you kidding me? What has the world come to when people are willing to dish out absurd amounts of money for a couple of worthless fonts?

thethingy, thanks for uploading his awesome torrent. It's people like you who have enough sense to share something like this with us. After all, who the hell would be able to afford the fucker anyways? Great torrent, AVG tested and clean. Thanks again, I'm the envy of my english class now thanks to these awesome albeit overpriced wordtypes."

Just not sure what the .ds and other files are for.

And fucking frustrating to sift through all the fonts."
