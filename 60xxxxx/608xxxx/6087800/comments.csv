Great movie and well worth the download... 
Many Thanx to raymondhome and SAiNTS for the Excellent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a quick download...:) "
,xxbassplayerxx,2011-01-09T01:30Z,Haven't watched it yet. Are there any sections in languages other than English or can I just disable the subs?
,5amjr,2011-01-09T05:27Z,"DVD quality, never a bluray rip in a million years. Dark sections of the movie are all pixals and light parts are very grainy indeed. Try another if you want a BDrip guys!"
,mb_webguy,2011-01-11T01:04Z,"5amjr: The ""brrip"" tag just indicates the source, not the quality.  The info clearly states that the video is 624x256, which obviously isn't HD.  But given the same encoding settings, a brrip at that resolution will likely look better than a dvdrip of the same resolution because of the higher quality source.  Don't complain that something isn't high def when it's clearly not described as such."

,MacMan7,2011-03-02T18:03Z,"Blu-Ray?! Are you off your fucking head? The quality of this is low. As stated, dark scenes are extremely pixelated and lighter areas are grainy, with some pixelation. Please state more clearly next time the CORRECT section this should be listed as. Not even as good as a DVD but good to watch.

Overall Video Quality / 9 at best
Audio / 8
Movie / 10

Movie was brilliant. Didn't expect it to be so good. The bit where Willis blows the guy away with the grenade launcher was epic."
,MacMan7,2011-03-02T18:05Z,"Just realised what mb_webguy said about screen resolution, and indeed it is 624x256, so therefore I take back my negative comment about BDRIP didn't realise!

:)"
