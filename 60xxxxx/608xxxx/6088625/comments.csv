,fasurvivor,2011-01-08T07:39Z,you are requested to upload Avatar 3xDVD9 collectors edition
,audiosonical,2011-01-08T09:25Z,"To fasurvivor: We have a saying here: ""The more you ask, the less (or nothing) you get."" I personally find your behaviour annoying and PUSHY to post the same comment on all new torrents (over 10 times!) In your case you are no longer requesting, but obligating people! My request to NLUPPER would be to NOT upload the Avatar 3xDVD9 collectors edition. (if he wants it so bad, let him buy it) BTW in Dutch your nick means: Someone who can't handle himself well without deodorant LOL Need I say more :D Special thnx to NLUPPER for all the great and amazing torrents, keep up the good work!

i thought that nlupper doesn`t see all the torrents reviews once he has uploaded it
that`s why i did it thinking that nlupper would see at least one torrent review and he will find my request

so sorry
my mistake
feeling much guilty for my annoying behavior
but thanks for your answer
so sorry
won`t happen again"
