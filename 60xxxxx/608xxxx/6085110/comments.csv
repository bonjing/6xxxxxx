,domohan,2011-03-20T01:38Z,would love to see this in MP4 to stream to ps3. No other rips for 720/1080p available. mkv works great in vlc though
,almond94,2011-04-07T14:57Z,"I recommend people to not always use their windows media player and instead use VLC. It is better :) And as for the movie,

,mgd37,2011-05-20T20:46Z,"Thanks 4 postin' this.
Will injoy it!"
,unfocused,2011-07-18T09:11Z,"V/8
A/2

The video wasn't great but definitely watchable. The audio got out of sync for me about half way through the movie, and kept getting worse towards the end until the last few minutes were hardly watchable. I expected much better. 

Thanks anyway."
,harvey_weinstein,2011-07-24T03:21Z,Video quality is terrible!
,harvey_weinstein,2011-07-25T04:00Z,"Sorry, wrote my comment on the wrong torrent. VQ in this is okay. The 4+ GB version is really terrible."
