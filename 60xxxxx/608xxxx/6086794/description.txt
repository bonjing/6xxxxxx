This is actually ripped from the US release DVD which has the alternative title 

"Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies"

However it is better known as "Monte Carlo or Bust"

Screen Legend Tony Curtis leads an all-star international cast in this hilarious, romantic and action packed romp!
Set in glorious Monte Carlo, this hugely entertaining follow-up to Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines 

follows the dashing Schofield (Curtis) as he teams up with the scheming Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage (Terry Thomas) 

in a zany, winner-take-all car rally beset with scheming competitors, treacherous cliffs - and a very beguiling 

blonde (Susan Hampshire).
A classic movie which is definitely worth watching for those movie buffs amongst you.
