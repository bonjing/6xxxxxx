[T],Distrance,2011-05-16T23:13Z,"Does this contain the cars that you can get from the car packs that are sold on the Burnout Store ? If not, does anyone know where to get them ?"
,speedy1791,2011-07-03T00:05Z,does it come with instructions to install it or does it do it auto 
[T],Coolguy33,2011-07-04T17:31Z,"@Distrance, no. All it does is mod the cars you already have. As for the car pack, i bought them legit from the burnout store as DLC when it first got released. Not sure where else you can get them!"
[T],Coolguy33,2011-07-04T17:50Z,"@speedy1791, the same list you see here is included with the download.  Create a new folder anywhere, preferably the desktop. Extract the Vanity Pack RaR file in there. Once done run the VanityPack.exe (Application) and it will install automatically.
Make sure the VanityPack.exe is running before you start the main burnout executable every time the game is played. Hope this helps!"
