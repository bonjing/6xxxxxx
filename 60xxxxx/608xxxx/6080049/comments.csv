At this time there is no way to run copies on 3.50. There will be soon, but not yet.

Does this include the fixed EBOOT for 3.41?"
,Pulse555,2011-01-04T09:48Z,"just edit the EBOOT yourself ( decrypt then re-encrypt to 3.41) ;) , im starting to collect all the newer games too lol , happy new year sony ! epic fail , all sony keys now released (inc'ing r00t key), now we just wait for online gaming to be sorted out, the way things are moving it could be by the weekend :D"
