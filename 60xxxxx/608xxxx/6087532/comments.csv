,martronn,2011-01-07T13:36Z,SLOOOOW SPEED!!! 0.5 downspeed here??? seed place? :-)
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T13:38Z,"sorry, my laptop crashed, m now seeding @ max"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T13:40Z,m seeding @ max speed
,FS_Junkie,2011-01-07T14:44Z,Thanks! & thanks to all seeders :-)
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T14:50Z,seeding
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T14:51Z,"is it working? hope so it is, i tested it myself"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T15:28Z,thank you seeders
,smith231,2011-01-07T17:23Z,which version is this? is this the latest (SP1/1.20)?
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-07T18:07Z,"@smith it is not the sp1/1.20. But if needed, I can upload it, may take some time"
,stusas,2011-01-07T19:53Z,Works Great Thx  Would somone Please seed fsavidyne  im stuck @99.9  for days  thx
,smith231,2011-01-07T21:10Z,"@NvidiaPhysX: that would be appreciated, thanks!"
,lodestar738,2011-01-08T01:07Z,"Thanks, work nice"
,mickyfinnny,2011-01-08T02:03Z,"Well done NvidiaPhysX,lovely bird.Thanx very much,ive been waiting for this.Just need the sp2 when and if its out there."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-08T07:52Z,"if you liked my upload, then plz listen to my request ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

'Aerosoft Dangerous Airports 1', plz upload this"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-08T14:21Z,"@pcgames thnx for the link, but the a300 which I uploaded is purchased by me and then I created the rip, did some changes and cracked the shit. Afterthat, I compressed it badly."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-08T14:25Z,Thanks for seeding
,mickyfinnny,2011-01-10T02:35Z,"Well i cant get the ins to follow the flight plan at all,nor will the aircraft fly in heading mode.Been on forums re-installed fsuipc,civa,this aircraft and  been through most of manuals.Is this bird definetly working 100%,just so i know im not flogging a dead horse,so to speak lol???"
,mickyfinnny,2011-01-10T17:48Z,"Reminder to self,remove .key file from fsuipc if autopilot not working.Yippeeeeeeeee now fully working.And Thankyou:+)"
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-11T14:59Z,ha ha ha
,smith231,2011-01-15T12:00Z,any progress on the SP1 (or the new SP2) updates?
,GWBushJnr,2011-01-15T18:20Z,"Thanks for the torrent. No need for CIVA INS.
Any chance to get SP2..."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-01-24T16:24Z,"hi guys, finally I bought the simcheck a300b4 sp2 and is going to upload as early as possible.

Thanks for cooperation"
,GWBushJnr,2011-01-24T22:16Z,"Thanks a thousand times for this SP2, NvidiaPhysX."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-01T12:48Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6142884/[FSX]_Aerosoft_Airbus_X_[Full_installer_with_crack_and_serial

download this"
,GWBushJnr,2011-02-03T11:07Z,"I understood you were going to upload a simcheck A300B4-200 SP2 rip.
To bad it was not feasable.
However, as you cracked the new ascrypt_pro.dll, it certainly applies to the A300.
So, it might be a good idea to upload the lone exe."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-09T05:36Z,"@GWBBushJnR
INS is not working, I am trying to figure it out!"
,GWBushJnr,2011-02-09T11:02Z,"SP2 comes with to two MSU switches  located in the upper panel.
Make sure to follow the align procedure before using the INS.
If this doen't work there is a problem."
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-14T15:12Z,"@GWBushJr.

alright, i am done!
wait for the link"
,Eggbeater,2011-02-20T22:32Z,Any updates on the sp2 upload? :)
,NvidiaPhysX,2011-02-22T06:20Z,"I finally got sp2 working, will upload it plz be patient."
