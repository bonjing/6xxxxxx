Deep down within thereâ€™s a new song arising
The time is now
Sing out your joy
Renewed in the Spirit weâ€™re breaking all borders
Refined in the fire weâ€™re reaching out higher
The time is now
Sing out your joy

We sing together
Jesus is King
Our sole life giver
To you we cling
Come reign forever
Praises we bring
And sing for Joy
Radiant in love

We are the people, anointed and chosen
(Jubileeâ€¦)
We are the prophets, a new generation
A righteous and holy nation sounding his praise
(Forever and ever and ever He reigns on highâ€¦)
He is the maker the Lord of creation
(Jubileeâ€¦)
His resurrection is our celebration
And now filled with his power and grace
Refined, Renewed, In Him
Shine Out!

Out of the formless you fashioned creation
And out of the void you have made us a nation
The time is now
Sing out your Joy
Down through the valleys of sorrow and darkness
You journey beside us and lead us to brightness
The time is now
Sing out your Joy
