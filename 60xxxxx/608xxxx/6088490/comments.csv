Also, please seed after you finish downloading.  I don't have a lot of upload speed, so every seeder counts!"

I'll download it and let you know how it sounds. Just judging by the file size, you can probably decrease the bitrate by about half (I have a monthly download cap to consider), but I'll listen to it first and help seed. Thanks again!"
