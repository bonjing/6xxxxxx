  Blow Up Your Video turned out to be their most successful album since 1981\'s For 
 Those About To Rock, even though it was chock full of filler. The driving album 
 opener, \"Heatseeker,\" turned out to be a surprising Top Ten single in the U.K., while Blow Up Your Video also marked the  return of AC/DC\'s early production team, Harry Vanda and George Young, who man the boards for the first time since 1978\'s If You Want Blood.
