A story of two people: Simon (Alfred Vargas), a promising young cop working part-time as a driver of one of the many undocumented and illegal FX taxis in the metro, and Pedro (Lou Veloso), a 70-year old ex-convict. 

An unfortunate incident forces the two to embark on a road trip across the historic Philippine East Coast. 

But what was expected to be an escape route doomed to be a domino of crime begetting crime becomes a wagon of life choices to them and the people they meet. 

The film takes a look at the paradox of the human condition and the "grayscale" morality that is today's Philippines.
