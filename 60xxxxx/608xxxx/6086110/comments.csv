what flashcard are you using?? , most cards have released a fix for this game?????"
,KiLLeRSweeT,2011-01-07T22:02Z,"Works just fine on R4i 1.50 as allways, i think there are so many stupid people in here (sorry to say) who just don't get it, why be on TPB if you boys and girls dont understand how it works????

If you got a R4i card look here.
1: Download the version you like http://www.r4ds-r4i.com/pages/R4i-Gold-Kernel-Download.html
2: Format your sdhc card.
3:Put in the version you just downloadet on the little black sdhc card.
4:Put in any game/music/movie you like.
5: Play and shut the fuck up (LOOL) and smile big time to the police.

Cheers but remember this is how it works with R4i card but not with the stupid fake Mario card or else add my mail for any help larspetersson30@hotmail.com"
