,JoshuAble,2011-10-31T20:20Z,"One of the most underrated films of all time... Tim Robbin's best acting performance of his career (in my opinion), along with an amazing screenplay which the film is genuinely thrilling and scary, the real kind of ""scary"": psychological.  What happens when we die?

Anyway, great rip, I actually have this DVD somewhere all scratched up (it's old), and you're version is amazing, especially under 2gb in size.

A: 10/10
V: 10/10

Movie: 10/10  - A must watch for everyone!"
