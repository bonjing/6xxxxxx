This is a set of what for me is the best DVD backup software I have found, much of which is no longer available.  This set includes:
DVD shrink - Lets you keep .iso format but shrink an image by video compression or by removing things like audio tracks or menus (if one menu then all)
DVD Decrypter - On the rare occasion protection is in place that won't be read by DVD Shrink this program can usually get around it.  Also good for burning ANY .iso (that I have tried..including xbox) file to a dvd+/-r (won't create a .iso though if it isn't from a DVD).
Ripit4me - works with DVD Decrypter to crack discs that have the newer form of protection (bad title lists or corrupted sectors that aren't supposed to be read, passes on a list to DVD Decrypter to let it skip these parts, then cleans up the files afterward).
