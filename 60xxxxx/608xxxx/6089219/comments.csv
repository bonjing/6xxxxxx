,Bonesmorelli,2011-03-27T09:29Z,Good clean download - no nasties and works brilliantly. Thanks Tsuris for taking the time and effort to share this.....
,Tsuris,2011-09-08T20:39Z,"Thanks again for the comment, to note for anyone who is interested in turning .ifo / .vob into .avi, Auto Gordian Knot is a great program for doing just that, although some movies require a little tweaking to make it work correctly, so I would say that (in those cases) it is not for amateurs :)."

,Tsuris,2012-02-04T09:26Z,"thank you as well :)
New note, the problems I had with agk were the source (particular encoding of one series was wonky) I now use dvdfab 8qt (free-regularly updated) to rip the dvd, dvd shrink to cut the fat to only what I want (especially removing things before the movie actually starts.....which is harder after the .avi is made) and agk set at a given size (10.5 ish mb per minute) in the vicinity of 1gb, instead of using percent, given size = two pass encoding, % quality = single pass encoding."
