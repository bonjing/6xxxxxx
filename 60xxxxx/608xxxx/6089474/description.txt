This is my favourite Joe Bonamassa album - a bit of a step out
from his usual works in that it is more acoustic / semi-
acoustic.  This is my first attempt at a torrent, so bear
with me.  I loaded this up to promote the works of Joe and
this great album; it's very well recorded and if you play 
these lossless files through a good hifi system it will 
sound excellent.

If you like Joe's music, then please support him by buying
some of his music CDs or go to his concerts like I have done.

Original CD has been ripped with xAct with zero errors, some
log files attached.

This torrent will not be top 40 (!) so please help keep it
alive by reseeding - more than 1.0 seed ratio if you can
please. Thanks
