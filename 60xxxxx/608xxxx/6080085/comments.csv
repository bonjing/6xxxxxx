,supersteve2345,2011-01-07T17:07Z,"@ bruhman1 
I read an Interview with the lady a while back so I knew the story before I saw the movie"

,supersteve2345,2011-01-08T02:34Z,"@ azzwipe74 

It is called reading newspapers. And nice name asswipe"
,Phatfish,2011-01-08T22:23Z,"@shinobiXRT:

Unfortunately its pretty much the same all over the world.

If you kill 10 people over 10 years you know and that you really hate you are a psychopathic serial killer. 

But if you get an army and kill 100000 people in 10 months that you dont even know, just for money, you are a President.

And if you kill no one and are broke you still a loser and deserves to go to jail."

All supersteve2345 was telling you, was a fact that wasnt mentioned in the movie, and is pretty nice to know. If you are whining that hes telling you that he was released from prison, you obviousy didnt read the movie reviews or saw the trailer for it? The whole point of the movie is to show his sisters conviction to not give up on her brothers innocence. The title isnt there to tell you hes stayin in jail. "
