Dr. Phil's most difficult, most notorious, most-talked about guests return! When Chloe first appeared on the show, she stormed offstage after fighting with her mom about her boyfriend. Will Chloe show any signs she's grown up, especially when confronted with a polygraph test? Plus, see what happens as Chloe is reunited with the boyfriend she hasn't seen since the show. Then, Todd last last appeared on Dr. Phil after he faked his own death off an Alaskan crab boat to get back at his wife. You won't believe what he did after the last show! Will his visit bring about an apology? And, will Chloe and Todd find redemption in their return?
