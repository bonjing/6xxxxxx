,bbb86,2011-02-21T19:00Z,"When installing, i when asks for info and serial, whatever i type, i cant click next. Anyone knows how to solve this?"
,bbb86,2011-02-22T16:31Z,"Nevermind, it works really nice. Thanks!"
,pabondage,2011-03-30T00:15Z,Ok Maybe I am dumb.  I have typed so many things during install for the serial number.  even anything.  what is the serial number please
,pabondage,2011-03-30T00:16Z,What did you type for serial number.  tried anything.  LOL
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-19T22:53Z,"Serial Key invalid, requires a login to a remote server, requires some sort of Daemon to install in the background then asks for a reboot on the install, naw this REEKS of sketchy in my book..."
,seevee1969,2011-08-12T13:07Z,"Only half of the game works - ""Build"" results in a CTD.  There was a fix/crack by ""PROPER-PROPHET"" but it no longer is available"
,WORKER11811,2012-01-20T09:08Z,"Mounted and installed as instructed .
When ""Launcher"" ask for CD KEY, use: ATS9-SKDR-SKDR-SKDR-SKDR-AAAAA

(type anything as serial during game setup, if asked)
Serial Key invalid"
,WORKER11811,2012-01-20T10:53Z,"OK..got it to run but Can't build.
""Build"" results in a CTD.

Any Help?"
