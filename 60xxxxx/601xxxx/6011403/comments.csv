,mercury5454,2010-12-06T04:23Z,"Thanks so much neon.  Very nice rip of a well-crafted film. V:10, A:10.  FYI, under Windows 7, the rendering in the latest VLC player viewed on a 40"" LCD 1080p-capable Samsung screen is noticibly better than in Windows Media Player."
,Werm,2010-12-09T20:37Z,AC3 XviD Extended fills my needs. tick tack.
,Werm,2010-12-10T00:55Z,"It is very interesting that I cannot play this file. I am not a noob, either. Both main file and preview are not playable in WMP, JetAudio, and VLC. If I didn't know any better I would say it was a fake, but it appears others can watch and uploader is trusted. Quite odd as this has never happened with a legit file for me.

Media info also cannot get any data from the files. "

Thanks for the upload!"
