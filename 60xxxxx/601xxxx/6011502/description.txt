The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.   
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark 
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root   
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and      
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do   
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene   
started in the mid eighties.                                   

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back  
on contacting us as soon as possible.                        

twice the fun   / double the trouble

We have noticed that the game have a problem with older saves  
from the first build we released. Restarting the level, seems  
to fix the problem. Blame the developers!                      

We have included the DLC called Challenge Pack 2 too.
