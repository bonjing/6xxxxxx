,race774,2012-01-25T18:41Z,"I Also had the ""Missing d3dx9_43.dll"" error. I downloaded that. Then got a ""Missing XINPUT1_3.dll"" error. Downloaded that also. (both found on dll-files.com) Put those into the main game folder. Then got sometimes saying my hardware wasn't good enough. Ran the ""DXSETUP"" found in the ""Installers"" folder. Game works perfectly now. Thanks"
