[V],nikita200,2010-12-07T16:11Z,"Note : For Vista/7 users, you need to disable DEP protection before running keygen, to do 

so, open a command prompt as administrator and type bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff, 

afterwards, reboot system to run keygen. 

To set things back to normal, command prompt and type bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx OptOut"
