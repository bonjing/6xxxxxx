,bigphil1982,2011-01-31T18:03Z,"I've downloaded from Konashine and the quality is good, thhey could probably do with uploading a screenshot to imageshack so people who don't know can see the quality.

Cheers for the upload, I can't afford to buy this stuff so it's very appreciated."
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-04-18T14:50Z,"@SEMTEXBHOY

Actually, given the fact that there is 12 episodes in this season, file size is very reasonable. In fact, I might be surprised a little surprised if this is actually HD 720p. Still, I'm downloading it to find out and watch it.

Regardless, thanks for the upload Konashine."
,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-04-20T18:23Z,Just had a quick check of the quality on the first episode and it's definitely 720p. Well done and good file size for twelve 1 hour HD episodes. Thanks.
,Gleavus,2011-04-30T10:33Z,"How can I remove the subtitles? I deleted the subtitle files but they still show up when I watch the show :( Not a big deal as I watch anime in subs, but in English it's a tad annoying :P"

,ninline,2011-06-01T04:16Z,If you're using VLC you can disable the subtitles from the menu.  On my WD HD TVlive I use the option menu to disable them.  It's the wonder of mkv.
