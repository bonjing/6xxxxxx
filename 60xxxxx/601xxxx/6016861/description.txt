A team of scientists travel to Tibet to track down the Yeti. Among the group is Waldemar (Naschy) the werewolf who 


gets into a fight with the Yeti. 
This had an extremely low budget, which I think really helped the film because it's just like those B monster movies from the 1940's. 
The Yeti looks incredibly stupid but Naschy is quite good in his role and the werewolf look is nice. The Yeti is only used at the start and end of the film, which is a shame but the side plot dealing with Tibet rebels was nicely done.
