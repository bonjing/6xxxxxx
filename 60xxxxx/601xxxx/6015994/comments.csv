,spemythewhale,2010-12-09T06:07Z,I can't get the chattchitto.exe to load.  stalls and no progress in bar with windows 7
[V],ChattChitto,2010-12-09T09:45Z,Try running it as Admin.
,spemythewhale,2010-12-09T17:47Z,"I did that.  It says ""chittchatto.exe in a unvalid path""  the small rectangular progress window will pop up but there's no green progress bar, just a circular windows waiting thing.  I need to go to task manager to stop the process.

Unfortunately it happens with all your uploads since I got Windows 7.  I used a couple on XP which worked fine."
,malexjx,2010-12-10T15:45Z,"spermy, it may sound simple, but are you sure your antivirus didn't ""clean"" the file? Maybe try turning it off and run .exe as admin after redownloading, CC stuff ALWAYS works great for me!"
,Shoobox,2010-12-10T18:33Z,"@ChattChitto 
ALWAYS LOVE YOUR WORK MATE,
have you thought about trying to do the BadaBoom:
i luv the converter, but no one has a real crack for it?"
,Kashxk,2010-12-10T19:06Z,"Working gr8, clean but that shity program still don't offer to choose more than one language when encoding in MKV :'("
,spemythewhale,2010-12-12T06:20Z,"malexjx,  I appreciate the help.  I tried it your suggestion to no avail.  I've tried everything I can think of.  Oh well.

CC, sorry I got your name backwards my 2nd post. "
,spemythewhale,2010-12-12T06:56Z,"I moved the download to a usb stick and opened it on a computer with XP, copied the exe and the crack.  Was able to install the program, but may have messed up the directions.  Opened the crack in the folder, CC's program opened!, clicked crack, said success.  However, when I open DVDFab it says trial, will see later if it expires."
,spemythewhale,2010-12-12T07:06Z,"OK, finally figured it out.  All set.  Thanks CC!"
,TexxUK,2010-12-12T14:52Z,Thanks for this ChattChitto.
,badmonK3y,2010-12-12T19:44Z,"Does this work with the newest version?  I went to DVDFAB's website and ""Platinum"" no longer exists, it's called DVD Copy now.  SO is this the same thing, or do we need to wait for another release?  Cheers"
[V],ChattChitto,2010-12-12T21:44Z,"It's the same.
I'm naming it this way to refer to all the versions stated on there website :)"
,audiohead22,2010-12-15T11:31Z,thank you ChattChitto!
