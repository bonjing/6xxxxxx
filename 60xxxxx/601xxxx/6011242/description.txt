 In the province of undivided Bengal lies the      
 sleepy, peaceful port of Chittagong. In this      
 unassuming little town a revolution is about to   
 begin; a revolution which will forever wake all of
 Chittagong and inspire the entire nation.         
 A band of 64 - 56 innocent yet fearless young boys
 defiant revolutionaries, 2 determined young women,
 and an idealistic leader - Surjya Sen, a school   
 by profession.                                    
 This group of 64 represents a little-known        
 chapter in history; a forgotten night that        
 reigned terror on the British forgotten heroes    
 and the narrative takes us through every step of 
 the action....
