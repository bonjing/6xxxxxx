IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Put.voina.2010.D.CAMRip.ELEKTRI4KA ...Thanks mate :)
AUDIO:From the LU ......Thanks mate :)

Here we are with the russian cam of this one with some fairly decent cam audio for it. First off it's not the best cam but you can be the judge, it is watchable for those who like cams. For the video we made a small script to adjust the gamma, brightness, chroma, sharpening filter, and adjusted the colors. We also Ran a high quality smoother on it to touch it up. The audio was given to us by LU Thanks Bro... It's fairly good so all we did was sync it to our video.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
