,some-young-guy,2010-12-07T20:29Z,"@Petegrim, battering any food makes it tastier, but I don't think this is the proper venue to discuss that."
,some-young-guy,2010-12-07T20:32Z,"@funnylookin, is the first set of AV numbers what you believed the quality would be prior to opening your eyes, and the second set closer to what you have found?"
,funnylookin,2010-12-07T21:32Z,"@some. 

No - the first is my opinion comparing it to other 'cam quality' stuff.

the 2nd is for the whining little babies that think everything posted here should be HD DVD quality. Comparing this to that is my second rating.

The quality of this for a cam is pretty good and very watchable. Its a little wobbly at times but still good."

,petegrim,2010-12-08T17:36Z,i dont like the idea of some young guy telling me where and when to discuss the battering of sea creatures
,Digital55,2010-12-08T19:21Z,"Recipe: Double Battered Sea Creatures.

First batter them with a club.
Then batter them in cornmeal and flour. Yummy!"
,Digital55,2010-12-08T19:23Z,Thanks Raymondhome!
,smknjoker,2010-12-09T02:52Z,"Wait.....so this movie is about ninja, who has to fend off an attack of assorted fish, using his katana to fillet and batter their yummy goodness for the towns Friday Fish Fry?

Sounds delicious. I'm sold. "
