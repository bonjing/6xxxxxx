Dire Straits - Sultans of Swing [Toppop 1978] VHS.mkv



HQ very rare tv show promo. AVRO's "TopPop" was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988.

"TopPop" was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.

"Sultans of Swing" was the first single release of the rock band Dire Straits. It was first recorded as a demo at Pathway Studios, North London, and quickly acquired a following after it was put on rotation at Radio London.

The song was originally released in May 1978 but did not chart. Following re-issue in January 1979, the song entered the American music pop chart. Unusually, the success of this single release came more than six months after the relatively unheralded release of the band's debut album in October 1978. BBC Radio was unwilling to play the song due to its high lyrical content; after it became a U.S. hit, their line softened. The song reached the top 10 in both the UK and the U.S., reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and helped drive sales of the album, which also became a hit.

*NOTE: I thought i would also post a few of the rest of what i have downloaded from the net over the years. Their video quality may not be as good, or their resolution may be odd, and so on. For example, the original file for this video had a odd resolution of 352x576. The Media Player Classic played it at the correct aspect ratio of 768x576 (4:3) just fine, but takes the screenshots at the original odd resolution, so i had converted them to .mkv to get a correct screenshot to use when i posted it here, but decided to post the .mkv conversions instead, since the "DivX Plus Converter" allowed me to pass through the original AC3 audio, and the video is about the same quality. Hope you enjoy them also :)
