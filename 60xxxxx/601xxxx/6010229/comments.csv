,liljimmy202,2010-12-05T05:32Z,yea but it still gets included in trackerlist.
,KingPoon,2010-12-05T14:51Z,"""smarter"" people have done their research and realize that the openbittorrent tracker is in all likelihood the new TPB tracker incognito, reinforced by the fact that it is included in every single TPB torrent :)"

Really? Cause I felt it improved the quality of the movie all around. 

Thanks for sharing liljimmy. I was really curious about these movies, but was way too much of a pussy to sit through them. Thank the maker for Rifftrax."
