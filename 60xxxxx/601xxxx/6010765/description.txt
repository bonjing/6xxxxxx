Let the Good Times Roll hosted by Jerry Butler (The Impressions) - An excellent look at the history of Rhythm and Blues in America. Part 4 of 26. Originally aired on NPR via Public Radio International (PRI), all 26 episodes were recorded from the web and will be released slowly so as to seed each one properly. Enjoy, this is quality stuff.
