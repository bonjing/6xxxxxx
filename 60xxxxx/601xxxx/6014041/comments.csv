The movie file in the folder wont open with any player and when I right click the file, there's no delete option, so in order to delete the file, I need to delete my downloads folder. That's happened to me before with infected files so BEWARE OF THIS ONE!!!"

download and install VLC media player


if you don't want to do that...
then learn about codecs...


and after you've learned about codecs...
then learn how to stop being a prick...


what the fuck media player are you using
anyway that it won't open a .avi file???


And if you can't delete...(no reason why)...
then boot into safe mode and do it...


I'm not even dead yet...but already I'm 
being subjected to a season in Hell..."

Somebody needs to invent some kind of wi-fi battery-op mechanical vacuum these broads can attach to their cunts and wear all the time.  Maybe rig it up to shut their mouths too."
