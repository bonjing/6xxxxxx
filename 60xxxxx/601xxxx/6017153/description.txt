From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with former federal prosecutor and a former member of the United States House of Representatives, Bob Barr. He was the Libertarian Party nominee for President of the United States in the 2008 election. Mr. Barr has filed a Freedom of Information Act request in response to the revelation that the the Department of Homeland Security has been keeping tabs on the Drudge Report and other prominent media outlets who have spearheaded a nationwide revolt against invasive TSA airport security measures.

Alex also talks with whistleblower Charlotte Iserbyt who served as Senior Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement, U.S. Department of Education, during the first Reagan Administration. Iserbyt is the author of The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, a chronological history of the past 100+ years of education reform. The book argues that the academic meltdown in our public education system is intentional.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
