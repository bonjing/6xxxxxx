History and myth comprise the lifeblood coursing through folk musicâ€™s veins, and plenty of both can be found surging through this new and startling collection from The Kittiwakes.

Based in south-east England, the trio of Kate Denny (vocals and violin), Jill Cumberbatch (mandolin, violin and banjo) and Chris Harrison (accordion) have applied themselves to a song cycle composed by Denny, based upon her impressions of Norwayâ€™s Lofoten Islands

The bleak but often awesome natural beauty of the region is evoked by Dennyâ€™s blend of traditional Norwegian and British styles. On first impressions, their hale and hearty delivery is certainly pleasing enough; but then so are most acts on the scene these days.

From an instrumental viewpoint the music here has a warm lilt that would easily put a blush on the cheek of a many a cÃ©ilidh-goer. However, one shouldnâ€™t be lulled into getting all cosied-up.

As what really gives the group their power and demands attention is their hair-raising collective voice. The best example of this is the title track, featuring goose-bump-inducing three-part harmonies â€“ itâ€™s an extraordinary sound.

Much of the success of the album is down to its immediacy and directness. Unadorned by any studio trickery, when turned up loud (which is highly recommended) itâ€™s almost like having the three Kittiwakes in the room with you.

The in-your-face attitude in Dennyâ€™s singing combined with some haunting and poignant writing, as well their intricate but always robust playing, makes this a wonderfully bright and highly original debut.
