I get Goner records sent to me for free cause I have a Goner tattoo and it used to be that was the promotion! This is what I think is one of the better releases. I like this better than Box Elders, etc. Stay tuned for more good recent releases on vinyl FLAC format. The best way to archive! 

I HAVE OVER 15,000 LPS AND 45'S 78'S PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

WE ARE NOT TAKING ANYONES ARTISITC OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND EXPLOIITNG IT. WE ARE SIMPLY PROVIDING CONNISUERS WITH HIGH END AUDIOPHILE QUALITY FILES OF THEIR FAVORITE ALBUM OR ARTISTS! Obviously the FLAC is not the dl of choice for most digital consumers!
