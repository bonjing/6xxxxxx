"For her tenth studio album, Thea Gilmore has made her most well rounded 

and immediate album yet. Her songwriting and observation of human nature 

are as sharp as ever but it's the arrangements this time round that raise it to 

another level such as the strings swelling under 'Due South' or the brass stabs 

on 'This Town'. It's the detail in the characters that inhabit the songs that 

make the album such a pleasure to listen to, whether it's the person who's 

worst punishment is to stay where they are ('This Town') or the character 

running away from their life ('Due South'). She's lost none of her fire, either: 

'Love's The Greatest Instrument' is fierce and driving, warning that public ire 

will "grab our politicians by the balls". Admittedly, there are a couple of 

moments where you think "hasn't she done this before" - notably 'God's Got 

Nothing On You' which has hints of both 'You Tell Me' and 'Exit Route' - but 

that's easily forgiven. At this point in her career, it's almost becoming a cliche 

to say that this should be the album that breaks Thea Gilmore through to the 

mainstream, but hopefully recent radio friendly single 'You're The Radio' is 

the secret weapon that finally gets the public to sit up and take notice of one 

of our finest songwriting talents. "
