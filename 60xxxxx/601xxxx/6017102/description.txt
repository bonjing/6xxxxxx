Words from Notch (Developer of MineCraft)

Bug fix list:

* Added /kill command. Does 1000 points damage to the player
* Did some patching client side to prevent duplicated entities
* The join server page now remembers the port as well as the ip
* Fixed a bug where joining a server on a specific port caused the client to forget all keybindings
* Added lakes and rare lava pools, both on the surface and randomly in caves.
* Fixed a crash bug when destroying the vehicle from under a player
* Players connecting to a server or respawning are invulnerable for three seconds

!NEW Bugs!
* Rather than kill you, /kill turns you into a ghost. (ie. you cant die, cant pick up items and monsters won't attack you). Solution is to delete playername.dat file located in the world folder.

Upgrading?

(Many things have changed, I *HIGHLY RECOMMEND* deleting your old
.minecraft folder and unpacking this fresh.)

But if you wish to do a normal upgrade.
Replace your MineCraft folder in ".minecraft" with this one.
Overwrite all files. Start MineCraft by running Launch.bat or Launch_x64.bat
Enjoy!


=======================================================

Install Instructions:

UNPACK your RAR into %appdata% folder.

This is how your folder should look like after it's unpacked
Make Sure you change "Your User Name" with your actual username

Windows 7: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows Vista: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows XP: 
C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\.minecraft


That's ALL now Run "Launch.bat" or "Launch_x64.bat" to play!
If you have Win7 and 64bit Java with 4GB or more RAM you can run "Launch_x64_4GB.bat" (5GB or more required)
