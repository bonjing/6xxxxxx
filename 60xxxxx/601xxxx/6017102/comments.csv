,hagbom,2010-12-07T20:52Z,"I got some weird problem, but i suspect itd because of me.
When i use the launcher for 64bits Windows 7 but when i start the screen is all black exept the text that says Minecraft.
I press start and it loads for a few secons then gets a error.
What am i doing wrong?
I did put the game in C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft
Please help!"
,jakename,2010-12-08T02:46Z,whats the error?
,FreeTibet,2010-12-08T06:24Z,"""Outdated launcher!"""

Learn to READ!

=======================================================

Upgrading?

(Many things have changed, I *HIGHLY RECOMMEND* deleting your old
.minecraft folder and unpacking this fresh.)

But if you wish to do a normal upgrade.
Replace your MineCraft folder in "".minecraft"" with this one.
Overwrite all files. Start MineCraft by running Launch.bat or Launch_x64.bat
Enjoy!


=======================================================

Install Instructions:

UNPACK your RAR into %appdata% folder.

This is how your folder should look like after it's unpacked
Make Sure you change ""Your User Name"" with your actual username

Windows 7: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows Vista: 
C:\Users\Your User Name\Appdata\Roaming\.minecraft

Windows XP: 
C:\Documents and Settings\Your User Name\Local Settings\Application Data\.minecraft


That's ALL now Run ""Launch.bat"" or ""Launch_x64.bat"" to play!
If you have Win7 and 64bit Java with 4GB or more RAM you can run ""Launch_x64_4GB.bat"" (5GB or more required)	"
,Zithorius,2010-12-09T01:04Z,"no matter what I do, I can't get this to work. My .minecraft stuff is in local settings\application data\.minecraft, I wrote the name stuff, I started with the bat file, but nothing works, it just says login failed, any help?"
,jakename,2010-12-09T02:09Z,"its supposed to say that
say play offline"
,dbacck01,2010-12-09T03:00Z,I try to run the game and I click 'Login'. It says I failed login successfully and the 'Play Offline' button is grayed out so I can't click it. How do you get passed this?
,jakename,2010-12-09T03:47Z,read the description and place ur .minecraft folder in the right folder
,Groffse,2010-12-09T16:25Z,"Got the same problem as dbacck01.
I got it in the right folder: 
C:\Documents and Settings\0501unha\Lokale innstillinger\Programdata\.minecraft

Programdata = Application data
Lokale Innstillinger = Local Settings.
I click the launch.bat and try to log in without any username or password. LOGIN FAILED no way to play in offline what so ever.. any suggestion?"
,Groffse,2010-12-09T16:46Z,I got it working. Drop the Local settings and it will work (windows xp)
,hagbom,2010-12-09T18:15Z,"Here is the error i get, any help with it would be appreciated :3

,sargent27,2010-12-18T00:20Z,"Ok guys: FOR REAL, JUST FUCKING BUY THIS GAME.

I usually ignore people like me that say shit like ""stop being pirates"" or ""you're disrespecting and killing the developers"".

But GODAMMIT JUST BUY THIS AMAZING GAME, ITS LIKE $15 and it will be the best 15 bucks you ever spent on a video game. right now you only have til the 20th to get it this cheap, and you will miss your oppurtunity if you don't hurry.

I don't know how many school nights so far I've stayed up to play this goddamn game; all i know is that there's a reason, and it has to do with the orgasm that is Minecraft. Please copy/paste this if you have played Minecraft and/or bought it."

,muellertr,2011-02-21T14:47Z,"question, wanted to start playing with dyes, and i do use cartographer on occasion to find diamond locations etc..  so i wanted to look for lapis lazuli, for the blue dye, and it didnt show any nodes on my map, also, i have only come across two flowers types, and if i put them in my crafting box, i dont get the option to extract any dye, skeletons dont ever drop bones which you are supposed to be able to break down to bone meal which can make white dye, so basically   i cant make any dyes at all, seems this version doest support it, can anyone confirm this, and also, is there any other features you know of that dont work with this release that i might come across,   also,,,tried setting up lan server to play on my own network with two pcs, i have the server software and both pcs can connect and have a different player name, but when the 2nd pc tries to connect, the first one gets booted saying someone with the player name is already logged in...i read online about a name spoofer and tried to figure out how to get that working but had absolutely no luck , has anyone run into this and can provide me with very specific and detailed information on how to do this, this is probably my biggest priority right now...

one last question... does kaen have a website that is working? if so what is it, and is he even still working on updates for this or did he stop? i want to be able to watch and monitor and make sure that i have the most current version available so that i can mess around with all of the features...  thank you everyone for anyone that may be able to shed some light on these issues.."
,teabaggerjones,2011-02-21T23:21Z,"ok, for those of you having this problem -->

'i have installed the folder into the correct directory, but when i launch the .bat file, i see q black window for a split second before it disappears, and the game will not launch'

the solution i found was simple, and that solution is to go download the latest Java Release for free. i had the problem, thats what i did, and now it runs fine, as advertised. 

Great upload!"
,KorpenRM,2011-02-22T10:07Z,"""muellertr""- This is an earlier version, so it have no dyes at all. Also, it has no squids, no note blocks, no dispenser, no charcoal... et.c.

Here's the full list of what it don't have: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Version_history
This version is Alpha 1.2.6"
,hewy09,2011-02-23T08:13Z,"hey.i did everything right and everything is in the right filebut when i log in it says ""outdated launcher"" and the play offlinebutton is grey and unclickable. could someone please help me?!"
,mirglof,2011-02-25T00:38Z,next download please include a java installer. my biggest problem is with java etc... I know my comp can run it but I am having hell getting the right java version. I have deleted and reinstalled the latest java and it still gives me the same error report (all ways javaw *dammit*) so it would be nice if the necessary java version and files was added to one of these torrents as well.
