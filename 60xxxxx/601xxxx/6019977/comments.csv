Because the new mkvtoolnix by default enabled header compression, because of which, on some players irresponsible manufacturers, movies are not playable, and because I learned about this not too long ago, and did not do the rip yesterday (or, because I wanted to shit on your problems) - if you have a similar problem (film not playable on yours hardvare player, on blu-ray i.e.) - just REMUX movie, without this option.


ps. and for god's sake, put yours players into the trash and buy a small, quiet computer, that controlled with a remote control, and that will download those same serials, that you download all the time, without your participation.

What I actually downloaded was the spoof of the movie.  Just a friendly reminder they are watching.  Other than that, this may be a great download and I am not trying to discredit the uploader."
