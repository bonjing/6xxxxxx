Renderers Notes:
This is my first torrent upload, so I only know the basics about torrent sharing. Seed for as long as you can, I'll be seeding as much as I can until it gets enough seeds from you guys to run on it's own. :)
If you like this version and want me to do more like this, you need to seed!
Rendered with Sony Vegas Movie Studio Platinum 9, used the effects Black Diffuse (from Magic Bullet) and Color Corrector,
to make the colors a little more "warm" and more real. You all know how TS videos turns out a little blue-ish.
