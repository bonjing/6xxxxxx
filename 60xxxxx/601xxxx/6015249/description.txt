   Release Notes:

   Vizati is a puzzle game that will put your mind to the test.  You have   
   to rotate a magical cube to connect (group) the little vizati stones     
   by color and figure out the best way to do it with a limited number of   
   rotations/moves.                                                         
                                                                            
   You can play the Story Mode and follow the story between Julie and       
   Peter who discovered the Vizati cube, or play the Arcade Mode, which     
   is a rawer, faster and even more teasing mode.
