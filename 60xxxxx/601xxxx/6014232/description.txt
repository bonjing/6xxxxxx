"Engineering Thermodynamics" by Tarik Al-Shemmeri
Ventus Publishing ApS | 2010 | ISBN: 8776816704 | 107 pages | PDF

This book is designed for the virtual reader in mind, it is concise and easy to read, yet it presents all the basic laws of thermodynamics in a simplistic and straightforward manner. The book deals with all four laws, the zeroth law and its application to temperature measurements.

This book is well stocked with worked examples to demonstrate the various practical applications in real life, of the laws of thermodynamics.
