Recorded between 1966 and 1968.
 
The history books say that in 1968, the King had made a major comeback, singing good and great songs with a newfound conviction in a Memphis setting. Yet before that, in 1966 and 1967, Elvis had recorded some sessions in Nashville that heralded his mighty return--yet nobody knew it, for the songs were all scattered over albums both great and lousy. TOMORROW IS A LONG TIME collects them, and this compilation stands as one of the best in Presley\\\'s massive catalog. From the nervy, scintillating take on Chuck Berry\\\'s \\\"Too Much Monkey Business,\\\" to the salacious celebration of carnality that is \\\"Down in the Alley,\\\" to the sublime, beautiful love song \\\"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\\\" (its writer, Bob Dylan, said it was his favorite cover version of one of his songs), Presley sings with a sensitivity and passion that recalls his mid-\\\'50s recordings.
All tracks have been digitally remastered.
