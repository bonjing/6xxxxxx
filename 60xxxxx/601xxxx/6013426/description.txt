"Guns and Weed is an intelligent documentary addressing prohibition, regulation, taxes, government schools and property. It wisely advocates that 
if you want to be free, you must stand up for the liberty of other peaceful humans, even those who would do or possess things with which you 
disagree."
--Ian Freeman, Free Talk Live radio
