It was built from the ground up to be seen in 3d... so get that copy too (in 1080p o'course) ;P

Please download to your hearts content, but tell people you know if you really think it is good.

,oddmanoutgt,2010-12-07T21:06Z,"Great rip, thanx.   Just one thing.   I burn the movies as data into a DVD-RW and watch them in a pretty basic DVD player.   I don't know if this happens to everyone but every time there's about half an hour of movie left it starts to skip.  The scene stops and then starts after a 2 or 3 second wait where it left off.  It's happened with Robin Hood, Wolverine, Iron man 2 and Inception.   Any one else?  Later days."

I'm sure this is NOT a DVDrip since its quality is nowhere close. Even from my personal experience, I don't expect much from MAXSPEED's releases, this must be one of the worst they've ever made. It's better than CAM but worse than an average R5.
Video: 3 (Strongly not recommended)."

,remedio,2010-12-12T01:10Z,grait kvaliti kute muvee. wuz cryin twice
,bradass,2010-12-12T07:03Z,"any movie in this size range i always fix the index before watching it on a dvd player.  too many times have i been almost done a movie to have it just skip to the next movie. not just a pause and back to the scene.  i would then have to fix the index and reburn to a dvd-rw to watch in my dvd player.  i use ""avi video joiner"" under edit -> fix avi.

the program is a trial of 15 uses, but that is for joining files, so you can fix avi's index as long as you don't join more than 15 times.  seems to me like the movie that skips may have been 2 pieces joined and no index fixing, thus skipping to next track/movie.

now any movie over 700mb i fix before i even watch at all.

hope that helps"
