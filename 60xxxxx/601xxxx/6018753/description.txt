Release Title: Despicable Me 2010 BDRip 720p H264 AAC - SecretMyth (Kingdom-Release)

Storyline: In a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white picket fences with 
flowering rose bushes, sits a black house with a dead lawn. Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this home 
is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru, planning the biggest heist in the 
history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. (Yes, the moon!) Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with 
his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in 
his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something 
that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: 
three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes.
