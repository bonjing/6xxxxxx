,superfastracer,2010-12-14T23:55Z,Is there a way to stream these rips to x-box 360?
,goodsir29,2010-12-17T10:00Z,superfastracer I use a program called vuze to download all my torrents. It has a feature that allows you to sync your xbox 360 or a ps3 to vuze so you can stream all your downloaded entertainment onto your xbox360/ps3. Once you are done dl'ing a file just click and drag to the game icon in vuze. Vuze must stay on for it to stream. Can you tell me if this has the 3 new mini movies?
,Thundernail,2010-12-27T15:14Z,This is seriously fucking great quality. H264 and X264 is the future of rips!

fragmented video alternating with plain grey screen in VLC
8 sec audio delay in Windows Media Player"

Although the sample File seem not to play but the Movie it self works great."
,Johnbooth,2011-03-29T06:21Z,"Me and 3 of my friends downloaded this torrent to watch it. We all woke up 3 days later with copyright notices in our mailboxes, saying we violated copyrights. bla bla bla. It cited this torrent.. Trap?"
,MadMerlin1,2011-04-06T21:42Z,"@Johnbooth, Same thing for me!!!  I received 2 email at different times stating the same thing and both of them pointing to this torrent this torrent should be flagged as a informant trap!!!"
