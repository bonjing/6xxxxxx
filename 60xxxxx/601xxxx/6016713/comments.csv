,EvilBoy1,2010-12-06T18:21Z,"aoloffine I say you deserve a sincere Thanks
P.s Jacobs Ladder CLASSIC!"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-06T18:53Z,"I didn't realise it had been purposefully deleted. The AR is only 6 pixels off, which is nothing. And the bitrate is more than adequate on this one so I don't see the need for something twice the size tbh."
[V],aoloffline,2010-12-06T21:49Z,"   You ware not contempt with stealing the torrent,you had to ad a -1 to my upload..not that it's the 1st time u are doing this..
I don't care about that,i don't add + at my uploads each time i log in ,but it was a immature gesture..
   Are u 12 or somethin.."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-06T21:56Z,Wow. No stealing has been done. I just uploaded a missing torrent. You're clearly mature...
