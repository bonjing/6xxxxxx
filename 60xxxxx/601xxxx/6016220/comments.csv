,frijolito,2010-12-22T04:23Z,"Thanks for the u/l. Could you please tell us what language the audio's in? Are the subs hardcoded, and in what lang?"
,mojor,2010-12-31T16:42Z,The Dutch description states that this is in English with Dutch subtitles.  Hope its a good flick.
,LeonardoDaVinci07,2011-05-08T13:12Z,"@frijolito 
As there is no separate subs file, I suppose they are hardcoded. Not for me, then."
,hyono_ko,2011-07-18T19:54Z,Poorly ripped: 1) subs are hardcoded; 2) aspect ratio is not correct; 3) the film is not properly cropped (black bars above and beneath the picture are part of the image).
,MarkGreen,2011-09-27T16:11Z,avoid this. subs are hardcoded and poorly ripped.
,tex99999,2012-02-20T08:37Z,This is only Part 2 of 3. Kinda pointless without Part 1 and Part 3
