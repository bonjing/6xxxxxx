We need the exact, step by step instructions to extract the information from this file.
I tried this under cygwin/Windows and I get error:
fatal: Not a git repository (or any parent up to the mount parent /cygdrive)
Stopping at filesystem boundarry (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).

This is no good."
,betafive,2010-12-08T04:48Z,the unpack instructions are missing a step. you need to 'git init' your repo before you can fetch from the bundle.
,veerenski,2010-12-08T05:01Z,"Can you please guys provide step by step instructions, especially for ppl thar run windoze?

I still have to see something working and I have no idea why is it so difficult to provide the info in a single .zip or .gzip fille. It is all just info. You can not assume the Phd in CS is going to deal with it or can you?

The whole thing is so simple that I fail to see why is it so complicated? Whose idea it was to release the gazillion of torrents, one for each stoopid page, most of which is just a template?

Come on! You can do better than that. Even I can."
,kaosu,2010-12-08T11:52Z,"The instructions are accurate. If you have cygwin with all git properly installed and come up with a fatal: .git error, you must:

git init

As it does not recognize the current folder as a git repository. 

After that, you can git fetch etc, it."
,isotope,2010-12-13T10:48Z,not every torrent is for everybody
