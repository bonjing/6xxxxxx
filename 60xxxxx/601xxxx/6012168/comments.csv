First, kill internet; then enter [.number] in box. Then you will se blow the box option that goes something like this ""if you dont have intenet acess click here"", so click there and then you should see another box where you have [. HardwareID] written. Copy that in keygen and than you can get key. It works but you have to kill internet every time you want to play.
Offcourse than there is that I cant read cyrilic so I'm screwed"
