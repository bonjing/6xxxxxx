             This new installment in the famous Theatre of War series    
             goes beyond World War II. Replay the events of the first    
             hot war of the Cold War era - the Korean War, also known    
             as the Forgotten War. The players are involved in two       
             campaigns, both set in 1950: the North Korean (June 25 -    
             August 20) and the American (September 15 - October 8).     
             In this title tactical engagement experts can test their    
             skills on a new strategic level - move your forces over     
             the entire Korean Peninsula, managing reserves, as well     
             as the fuel and ammo supply. Tactical battles are           
             generated based on the historical situation (except a       
             few key ones).
