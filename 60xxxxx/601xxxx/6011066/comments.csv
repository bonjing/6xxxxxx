,Jack_Raiden,2010-12-05T04:27Z,"Hold it! A resolution of over 675,000 pixels (720p), encoded at 600 Kbps? 6-channels of audio at a total of 140 Kbps? (23 Kbps per channel! Stripped of audio frequencies over, say, 10 KHz!) I am stunned.

You did, however, accomplish the best FFUUUU yet to respectable, decent-quality releases and encoders. aXXo packed more quality into his releases. (Oh, snap!) I'm offended by this release, and probably all ""QEBS"" FASM releases. May cod have mercy on your soul.

*watches sample* Actually, I was expecting worse, although the audio was indeed horrible."
[T],fachman,2010-12-09T12:32Z,"Jack_Raiden: you have prooved one thing - you can not understand what you read, as its clearly says 
Audio1 Format .............: AAC LC HRTF STEREO

If you think that 141kbps is too low for aac in stereo then check your hearing.

No problemm if you prefer Axxo, stay with it. "

Video quality looks great on both my laptop and my iPod, which I was able to sync it to with no hassle. The only thing I noticed is some slight sound delay near the start of the film, it wasn't major though. Low file size, great sound quality, brilliant video quality, amazing film too.

PS. Jack_Raiden, you're retarded."
,TheSupaDusty,2011-08-04T04:51Z,the audio is off..
