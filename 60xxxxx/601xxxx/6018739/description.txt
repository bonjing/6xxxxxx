Black Cinderella Two Goes East (sometimes referred to as Black Cinderella II Goes East) was a radio pantomime broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on 25 December 1978. The programme is notable for being one of only a few radio programmes (co)-produced by Douglas Adams while he was employed by the BBC as a radio producer. 


The hour-long programme was written by Clive Anderson and Rory McGrath and was co-produced by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd.

The programme featured performances by:

Richard Baker, Narrator 
Tim Brooke-Taylor, Timothenia and the King 
Rob Buckman, Prince Charming 
John Cleese, Fairy Godperson 
Peter Cook, Prince Disgusting 
Graeme Garden, Gardenia and Manny 
David Hatch, himself 
Maggie Henderson, Cinderella 
Jo Kendall, Wicked Stepmother 
Richard Murdoch, Baron Oddbeef 
Bill Oddie, himself 
John Pardoe, Fairy-tale Liberal Prime Minister 


Douglas Adams had to follow the show's writers to Cambridge in order to get them to work on the script, and had to pick up the finished script from a messenger on a train. Adams also recorded a reluctant John Cleese at home. Cleese had vowed never to work for BBC Radio again, following a dispute over a sketch in the series John Cleese's Sketchbook. 

Cleese's lines were then played from a tape recorder into the broadcast programme.
