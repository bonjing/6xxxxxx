Willow (1988) Special edition 

Young Willow Ufgood finds a baby abandoned in the wilds and is thrust into an adventure full of magic, adventure, and battle.

Had a little trouble with this one but it works when mounted on my machine. I made an image of the original disk using MagicISO.

Just mount the image on your computer, or use a virtual drive program of your choice and burn the image to a blank dvd. 


Includes all the special add ons for the special edition.
