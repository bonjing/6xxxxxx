                 The Santa Clause 3

Tim Allen is back in his big red Santa costume for even more hilarious 

laughs in this festive family comedy from Disney. Take a wild snow sleigh

ride when the recalcitrant Claus faces his most hysterical challenge yet.

Christmas is coming up and Scott Calvin invites his in-laws

to the Christmas celebrations. But everything takes a chaotic turn when

Scott sees a way to get to be Santa Claus, while the evil Jack Frost

tries to take over Christmas. If Scott did not manage to fix the situation, 

it will be a truly icy Frost Christmas at the North Pole and across the

world. Should Scott have time to recover the job before it's too late?
