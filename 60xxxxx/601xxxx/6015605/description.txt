Mountain Gorilla (2010)


Episode 1: Kingdom in the Clouds

The largest gorilla family in the world is starting the perilous journey down to feed on the fresh shoots of bamboo.
They run the risk of being caught in illegal snares and Cantsbee, the dominant silverback, will have his work cut out
keeping them all safe, especially those closest to him. Meanwhile on the other side of the Rwandan volcanoes a young
gorilla has been deserted by her mother. She turns to her silverback father for guidance and protection, but is he up
to the job? In Uganda, Marembo the teenage silverback has come of age. He has lived 15 years under the watchful eye of
dominant silverback Rukina but now feels it is time to make the break on his own.


Episode 2: Last Stand of the Silverback King

Titus the gorilla king faces the biggest challenge of his life. He's lived longer and sired more offspring than any
other known gorilla, but his time as a great leader may be coming to an end. The mighty silverback has a little orphan
in his care - and both their lives hang in the balance. In Uganda, young silverback Marembo is back with his raging
hormones and desire to be dominant - he's sure to shake things up a bit.


Episode 3: Safe in Our Hands

This edition follows the plight of some of the youngest and most vulnerable of the mountain gorilla population. Includes
the two young orphans whose mothers were callously murdered in execution-style killings, the young female battling with
new emotions, and the new gorilla king struggling to keep hold of the group he fought so hard to win. Discover how they
cope in this exploration of what the future holds for the remaining last few hundred mountain gorillas.
