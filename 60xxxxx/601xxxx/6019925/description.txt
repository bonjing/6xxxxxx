Jimi
James Marshall Hendrix
November 27th, 1942 - September 18, 1970

Widely recognized as one of the most creative and influential musicians of the 20th
century, Jimi Hendrix pioneered the explosive possibilities of the electric guitar. Hendrix's
innovative style of combining fuzz, feedback and controlled distortion created a new
musical form. Because he was unable to read or write music, it is nothing short of
remarkable that Jimi Hendrix's meteoric rise in the music took place in just four short
years. His musical language continues to influence a host of modern musicians, from
George Clinton to Miles Davis, and Steve Vai to Jonny Lang.

Jimi Hendrix, born Johnny Allen Hendrix at 10:15 a.m. on November 27, 1942, at
Seattle's King County Hospital, was later renamed James Marshall by his father, James
"Al" Hendrix. Young Jimmy (as he was referred to at the time) took an interest in music,
drawing influence from virtually every major artist at the time, including B.B. King, Muddy
Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Holly, and Robert Johnson. Entirely self-taught, Jimmy's
inability to read music made him concentrate even harder on the music he heard.

Al took notice of Jimmy's interest in the guitar, recalling, "I used to have Jimmy clean up
the bedroom all the time while I was gone, and when I would come home I would find a
lot of broom straws around the foot of the bed. I'd say to him, `Well didn't you sweep up
the floor?' and he'd say, `Oh yeah,' he did. But I'd find out later that he used to be sitting
at the end of the bed there and strumming the broom like he was playing a guitar." Al
found an old one-string ukulele, which he gave to Jimmy to play a huge improvement
over the broom.

By the summer of 1958, Al had purchased Jimmy a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic
guitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy joined his first band, The
Velvetones. After a three-month stint with the group, Jimmy left to pursue his own
interests. The following summer, Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro
Ozark 1560S; Jimi used it when he joined The Rocking Kings.

In 1961, Jimmy left home to enlist in the United States Army and in November 1962
earned the right to wear the "Screaming Eagles" patch for the paratroop division. While
stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed The King Casuals with bassist Billy
Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy
began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. By the end of 1965,
Jimmy had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke,
the Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimmy parted ways with Little Richard to form his
own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for
the spotlight of lead guitar.
