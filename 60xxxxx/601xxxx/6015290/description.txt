Format Converter 3 is a powerful video and audio conversion program that allows you to convert films and music to almost any format.

In addition to the facility for converting video and audio files, Format Converter 3 also offers the chance to extract soundtracks from videos and convert them to current audio formats. For instance, you can create separate audio CDs from your music video DVDs.

Format Converter 3 comes with a large number of conversion profiles, ensuring that every file can actually be converted and adapted in the best possible way. Whether you have an HD or Internet video, Format Converter 3 ensures that every file can be played at optimum quality. If any of the profiles does not meet your requirements, you can customize the settings and save them for later use.
Format Converter 3 allows you to load audio and video files easily into an intuitively accessible and virtually self-explanatory user interface, as well as select the medium you want (video or audio). In the case of videos, you can also choose the type of player you want, set important video and audio quality attributes, and then leave the rest to the application.

On top of the extensive conversion functions, the program also offers you the opportunity to use the integrated burner module to save the audio and video files you have created to CD or DVD. 

One of the program's highlight features is the facility for uploading to the Format Converter 3 server music and video files that cannot be converted or contain errors, which can then be examined by our staff. If they come up with a solution for converting the file, you will be informed automatically by email. 
Whether you want to play a PSP film to entertain the kids in the back of the car or as a mini-distraction for yourself between two trains, Format Converter 3 does not only hit the right note when it comes to converting music tracks, but also produces exactly the right format for your video player, completely automatically of course.
