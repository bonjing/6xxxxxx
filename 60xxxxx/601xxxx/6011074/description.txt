CANNONBALL ADDERLEY CANNONBALL TAKES CHARGE
Label Blue Note 
Orig Year 1959

Adderley was on the verge of leaving Miles Davis's Sextet when he recorded the seven titles and two alternates that comprise this LP, the sixth in a seven-volume series of Riverside dates reissued by producer Orrin Keepnews. Accompanied by pianist Wynton Kelly and alternating bassists and drummers, Adderley is in fine form on these standards with the emphasis leaning a bit toward ballads and blues. Highlights include "Serenata," "Poor Butterfly" and two versions of "I Remember You." ~
