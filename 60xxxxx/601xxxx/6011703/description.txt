[b]It's Turbo Tax 2006 Home and Business in a reasonable size. I removed junk like IE, Adobe Acrobat, and Quicken. Intuit attempts to force you to pay for Quicken anyway, and the Quicken is useless unless you do pay extra. Then I compressed it. This is from an ISO, so everything should be cool.[/b]

[b]Solution for Free Multiple States:

1. Install App. Select your free state and install it.
2. Once TurboTax updates with free state, close app.
3. Run regedit to open registry.
4. Go to RegKey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software.
5. Delete the entire "Intuit" key. Don't worry. The program will still be there!
6. Close regedit.
7. Open TurboTax and it should ask you to choose your free
state again.
8. Choose a new state and install it.
9. Repeat process for additional states.
10. Enjoy.
