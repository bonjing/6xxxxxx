,garbb,2010-12-07T23:18Z,"where did you download this file from?

,psico_kinetic,2010-12-08T02:20Z,"thanks blankk, i will seed as much as I can"
,lonmohr,2010-12-08T03:17Z,"Hey blankk, Thanks for the torrent. Don't let the brick bats get you down. Most of us do appreciate it."
,Picodroid,2010-12-08T03:26Z,"Will seed for a while after it's downloaded. I can't believe it's taken so long to be put online! Thanks, blankk. Hope it's legit. I'll upload at around 500KB/s when I start seeding."
,Picodroid,2010-12-08T04:56Z,"Seriously, can you people seed??? I've been uploading at 500KB/s the whole time, I've got over 1GB uploaded and less than 250MB downloaded. I know more than 7 people have gotten 100% by then... I'm getting 3KB/s down when I can reach 2.5MB/s at full speed. WEAK!"
,bdgold,2010-12-08T05:09Z,"Well said blankk

,blankk,2010-12-08T06:42Z,"Thanks for the kind words. I assure you this IS a legit one! There still is no rip available yet. 

Thanks for being patient.. and thanks for seeding this one!"

,blankk,2010-12-11T21:30Z,"@houruoha thank you. Next time (I hope there is no next time) I will re-encode it to 480P before uploading. Such a great community TPB.. we can continue making it better. 
At one time 1000 people were seeding and 5000 downloading.. real pround moment. Glad to share.
And once again,
Fuck you history channel and BBC UK for not allowing international streaming. Peace!"
