This is the 3rd episode from Top Gear US and my first upload. I waited like an asshole for 2 days to watch this one and guess what? No rips what so ever.

And.. as I am not in U.S I can't even stream it from history channel! FUCK YOU ASSHOLES!!

Downloaded from shitty sites some how and it was worth the effort.. video is excellent.

DON'T CRUCIFY ME FOR SLOW UPLOAD. I ONLY HAVE 30KBPS UPLOAD RATE, however I will seed like bitch until its distributed properly!

What lesson I learnt, if no ones helping you, help yourself. All other people like me out there (not in U.S and who don't want to fucking pay to itunes.. start uploading torrents)

Peace out!
