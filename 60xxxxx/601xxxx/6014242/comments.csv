[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-05T19:52Z,container doesn't mean anything.  I can place my file into mkv container in 5 minutes.  it doesn't make it magically better.  people need to learn difference between container vs codecs.
[T],on.off.on,2010-12-05T20:23Z,@HolyRoses true that.. :) 
,htctouch,2010-12-06T04:18Z,"i neva told tht i hv problem with the containr ....

[T],on.off.on,2010-12-06T09:52Z,@htctouch my eyes bleed when I watch a 720p in a size of 400-600 mb.. I cant believe that people watch that :)
[T],qwersd,2010-12-06T15:51Z,"@OOO, 2040 encodes BR into small sizes & somehow manages 2 make them look pretty good on LCD's... handheld versions r obviously not meant for PC screens.."
