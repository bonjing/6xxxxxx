,Mutegrill,2011-04-23T00:11Z,"I know you gave us all necessary info here, but pleeeeeace check original sources before uploading guys. Your upload is 4:3, but the movie was shot with an aspect ratio of 1.37 :1. Some drunk russian  must have cut some off to fit his outdated 4:3 tv-set. Really sad, but still a great upload. Sorry IÂ´m complaining dude..."
,RaphSai,2012-01-19T21:46Z,"Mutegirl, before you explode with your ""I jump to conclusions just so I can be the first person to complain about something"", but the movie was shot 4:3 because it was made for TV before the widescreen format became available on TV. It was obviously stretched(and probably cropped a small portion as to not look too obnoxious) for its DVD/BluRay release. 4:3 IS THE TRUE ASPECT RATIO OF THIS FILM."
