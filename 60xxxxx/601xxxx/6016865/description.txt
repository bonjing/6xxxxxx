PC Specific Changes
General
â€¢ Added support for Xinput wheel and Logitech Rumblepad 2, including default action map configurations.
â€¢ Adding ability to use H-pattern shifter in custom configuration by allowing configuration of gears 1 to 6 and reverse. Same for boost.
â€¢ Fix for missing Force feedback on Vista.
â€¢ Added the ability to override the controller type, so that if the game fails to auto-detect it, users can specify it themselves.
o Symptoms of the game failing to detect the appropriate controller type are:
On a pad, handling is too twitchy, appears to steer â€œlock-to-lockâ€.
On a wheel, the input lags and the linearity slider doesnâ€™t appear to have an effect.
o To override controller type, find the hardware_settings_config.xml that is generated when the game is run (should be in My Documents\Codemasters\GRID\hardwaresettings) and change the line that reads <input device_type="auto" /> to either <input device_type="padâ€ /> or <input device_type="wheel" /> as appropriate for your controller.
â€¢ Changing microcode optimisation level for NVIDIA 7xxx series graphics cards to reduce a pause when using each shader for the first time.
â€¢ Adding support for triple head displays.
â€¢ Graphical corruption fix when using multiple GPUâ€™s.
â€¢ Network chat text made less obtrusive.
â€¢ Numerous on-going compatibility fixes.
â€¢ Improvements to shadows for certain resolutions/aspect ratios.
â€¢ Profiles are now flushed to disk when they are written to reduce the chance of them being corrupted if the PC dies.
