,jon4fun,2010-12-06T21:50Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for all your encodes/ups as always.

Thank you in particular for Game of Thrones, I've been hearing about this project for a while (even bought the graphic novel - related). Anyway, loved the books and now maybe George R.R. Martin will get back to writing again aswell so double win.

Cheers
Jon"
,silveroakleaf,2010-12-07T01:36Z,"20-40  Thx again for your work.  After going to bed at 10pm and waking up at 6am and seeing how MeGUI took all 8 hrs to encode a 720p show (on my Turion 64), I have a true appreciation for what you do!  Do you use anything special for your encodes?

Thx again 4 Board, Desper, Dex,  Game, and all your other daily ups!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-07T08:56Z,"Thanks.

@silveroakleaf: Nothing special. My software, 2-pass encode, 2800 MHz QuadCore running XP32/SP3 and I get 124-230 fps on 272p down to 9.23 fps for 720p in encoding. Thanks."
,redriding,2010-12-07T09:05Z,Thank you for Dex and Transformers :) You rock as always..
,ladderman22,2010-12-07T10:02Z,"thank you especially for the game of thrones preview!!
Somehow you have the exact same taste in shows as me (and everybody else who's cool)!!"
,froglog,2010-12-07T10:22Z,"Thanks for Game of Thrones, i'll try it "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-07T12:40Z,"@doyll: LOL. I haven't. I release my encodings day after the airing. I got Lost Girl 12 hours AFTER all other shows and I find stupid to make people wait because of one show which ALWAYS has uncertain time of appearance. I dropped many shows because of that, but - I am well aware of the problems caper have with ShowCase shows.

Patience... patience - is a virtue indeed."
