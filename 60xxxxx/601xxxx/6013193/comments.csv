,bvdejr,2010-12-28T16:47Z,Can't install in WIndows 7 Home. It says can;t write to C:Programs(86)/VLC. Can someone help me. Do anyone know another player for mkv files... Installed VLC thrice to no avail. 
,ifraaz,2011-01-06T06:54Z,It's great ! thanks mate.
,afkuser,2011-01-22T17:41Z,"ahuramazda001 is right.  You can download the latest version for free - straight from their website.
Why trust a torrent to be the latest version and virus free when the program creator offers it free of charge?"
,poppy20,2011-02-05T22:11Z,"Yes, just download it directly from the developer's website, it is free open-source software, why bother with dodgy torrents and hoping that the uploader has not tampered with the file?"
,PoshRocks,2011-02-12T12:48Z,"Hahahaha omg lol, umm you all know that you can get a newer version at the main site?  dubmasses..."
,Bob__Dole,2011-02-18T06:58Z,"Actually, it's kind to the developer to get it off a torrent instead of giving them a bigger bandwidth bill for something they are giving to you out of charity... or sent them some cash, either way you should give back something or at least not only take take take."
,Cat123pb,2011-03-08T11:56Z,Why share something that is already free from it's main site? It's a complete free software which you can download from http://www.videolan.org/vlc as you may find out there are also a newer edition to this! And you can also dl for other OS aswell!
,reverend_floyd,2011-03-12T11:16Z,"This torrent is retarded. It's free software for chrissakes. Go to http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ and get it, dumbfucks."
,talsem,2011-03-17T10:36Z,"Just because something is free does not in any way decrease the usefulness of a torrent. A torrent is more useful on an unstable internet connection, for example, as each piece is hash checked and re-downloaded if it has become corrupted, something which an http download can not."
,a.Rascal,2011-03-21T06:10Z,THANKS!
,sithara,2011-04-05T14:28Z,thankz
,friendlyx3,2011-04-06T07:06Z,Guess it's time to make another torrent seeing as VLC has been updated 3 times since then (5 months since 1.1.5)

,rolf24,2011-04-21T21:48Z,you people don't know that(vlc) is a FREE program?
,25sks2srvsd,2011-04-23T17:52Z,It is free... but a torrent is a much better down load exp. for those of us using Satellite Internet where the connection is not quite as stable.
,kukki2,2011-05-06T19:09Z,"For HD fans, try out splash pro (its in tpb also). It produces far superior color output compared to VLC. VLC for the rest, like crappy rips and dvdrs :)="
,livelifekingsize,2011-05-24T18:27Z,Thanks a lot for this! Keep it up man..........
,masterac,2011-06-02T06:30Z,what king of idiot try to share a free software that you can find from the main web site

,papichulo2369,2011-12-26T07:51Z,honestly the beauty of torrents is the ability of being able to download programs that are insanely priced. so seeing vlc here is quite funny.
,fuzdemon,2012-01-16T23:54Z,"""what king of idiot try to share a free software that you can find from the main web site""

someone who finds the mian site is temporarily down or someone who finds the download speed of the main site is too slow, idiot."

,LikeAnIbis,2012-05-29T22:12Z,"VLC 2.0.1 works for shit on my rig, so thanks!"
,Hack44,2012-06-01T02:29Z,"You know whats even funnier is the idiots who took time to open the file knowing it was freeware and took time to post a comment. Hey dumb asses Everything here is FREEWARE than cause no ones payin for shit. Maybe you all should get a hoppy besides shit talkers behind a keyboard, playing with yourself doesnt count. If it bothers you that much about someone elses post you obviously have no life  and should probably do the worls a favor and find the closest bridge and jump off it. Pull your head out idiots!"
