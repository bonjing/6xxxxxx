,freeworkman3,2010-12-24T02:19Z,Works great on my samsung 3d tv. I stream it through usb port from external hdd. The sound works fine for me like it is. It just takes a second to come in and then works fine.
,ufchenric,2010-12-24T13:58Z,Thanx LigGeorge for all your hard work! A question if I buy a bluray-burner and burn the mkv-file on a bluray-disc will I get the sound (dts-hd) to work without having to remux it. I already have Samsung 3D-tv and 3D-bluray and Onkoy tx-nr808 with 3D.
,Big_Deal,2010-12-24T15:59Z,Thank you LiG! Your uploads in 3D are amazing!

,zeeslak,2011-01-24T12:30Z,"does anyone know how to subtitle this 3d movies? i found a program 3d subtitler, but then i get a .sub file,and my samsung 3d tv doesnt support that format.. also when i merge the subtitles with mkv merger i got no results on my tv?"
,Gogul69,2011-02-05T02:39Z,Mild delay between left and right picture causes each scene cut to move out of sync giving a slightly nautious effect. Appreciate the hard work but is definitely a millisecond out of sync. Great shot though keep up good work
,Tchaca,2011-05-01T01:01Z,"Does anyone know if it works with a Sony Bravia 46NX715  and the 3d kit?

I downloaded the movie, played with the stereoscopic player (Laptop was connected with a HDMI cable to tv) and still cant see the 3d effect?
Thanks"
