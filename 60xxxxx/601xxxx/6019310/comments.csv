,merele_vg,2011-03-17T19:13Z,"How are these numbered? Air date, DVD order, what? Cause none of them are named and it's hard to tell exactly which episode I'm watching."
,biano1,2011-03-27T01:25Z,Directory is by seasons. If you dont have them in separate folders the file names are broken down as follows. Babylon 5.101 is season 1 episode 1 Babylon 5.210 would be season 2 episode 10.  Hope that helps..  I didn't put the name of each show in the file name some were too long tried to keep it simple.
,ili2882,2011-08-03T20:46Z,"Codec info?
There are 2 DVD Rips of season 1 floating around a div3 (old codec based on a nonstandard M$ mpeg4 implementation) by AMC and XviD by a p2p group SLiPFiST, which is this? I'ld like to know, tanks for the effort."
