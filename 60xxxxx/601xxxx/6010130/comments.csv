[T],trialNerror,2010-12-04T09:57Z,"Wanna know a hint about these flash video files?

There's this one site called The Paranormal Society dot org where you can watch this series as well as a few others.

And if you go there with Internet Explorer 8, you can explore to your temporary internet files folder on your hard drive at C:\Users\*username*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files\Content.IE5\******* and find the very flash file found on here.   

The folders inside Content.IE5 will be randomly named, but there's only half a dozen to look inside of for the .flv file.   

Copy and paste the finished loading video file - usually around 190,000 KB in size - to wherever you desire.

This is completely legal since the video was initially placed on your hard drive by the website.

:D

Neat, huh?!

P/S:  You'll need to have system and hidden files and folders showing.  These can be modified via Control Panel > [Appearance and Personalization] > Folder Options > click on the View tab, then select the button to show hidden files and folders and also uncheck the box to hide protected operating system files. 

These options can be undone after grabbing the video file from the temporary internet files folder, or left as is if you wish."
