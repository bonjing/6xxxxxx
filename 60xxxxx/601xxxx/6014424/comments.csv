,-Cortex-,2010-12-06T22:14Z,"The title doesn't say 720 or 1080p, that should be your fist clue.
Then the size which is less than a gig.
Oh and the description says '640x272', which last time I checked was 1/4 720p.

Seriously people, READ!!!"

Movie was good, better than most of the recent movies with Afleck, I like how they tied in the romantic parts of the movie. Thanks for the quality upload! "
