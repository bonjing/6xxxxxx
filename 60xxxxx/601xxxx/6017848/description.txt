This torrent contains an archive of all WikiLeaks data made public PRIOR to the "Cablegate" release.

This file does not contain the "Cablegate" documents.  It contains EVERYTHING that came BEFORE "Cablegate".  

For everyone who was upset that WikiLeaks took all their old leaks offline when they published the Iraq and Afghanistan files, now you can have your very own copy of the entire WikiLeaks archive!  How cool is that?

Defend WikiLeaks!  Defend Julian Assange!
