,veerenski,2010-12-08T03:59Z,"It is not clear why they release the information in gazillions of torrents? This is the simplest thing in the world.

Just zip it or gzip it in one file with a directory tree that corresponds to issues.

This is becoming to look like a hoax and not the real thing. I do not believe what I saw of it already.

This is TOTALLY unworkable. With thousand people involved, is there anyone with a functioning brain?"

To answer your question as to why it's taking so long to release all the files from the ""Cablegate"" leak:

From the official WikiLeaks ""Cablegate"" FAQ
http://www.wikileaks.ch/static/html/faq.html

""Are all the embassy cables being released at once?

No. Instead of publishing the documents all at once, the organisation will be releasing the embassy files in stages.

Why not release everything now?

The embassy cables will be released in stages over the next few months. The subject matter of these cables is of such importance, and the geographical spread so broad, that to do otherwise would not do this material justice.

We owe it to the people who entrusted us with the documents to ensure that there is time for them to be written about, commented on and discussed widely in public, something that is impossible if hundreds of thousands of documents are released at once. We will therefore be releasing the documents gradually over the coming weeks and months. ""
The Cablegate files alone (250,000 documents) are equal to something like 3,000 complete books worth of information.  Releasing that much info at once would be impossible for any single person to evaluate in any meaningful way.
