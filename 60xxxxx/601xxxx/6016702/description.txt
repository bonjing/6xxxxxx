Ok, seems people are freaking out that I would try to save them space by rar'ing up my other torrent to save them time downloading these videos. So heres the same torrent in natural form, unrar'ed.
theres a couple txt files that show links to news stories that have been deleted from the internet.
There are 80 youtube videos that have been deleted from the internet that obama and his crew do not want you to see.

have at it!
