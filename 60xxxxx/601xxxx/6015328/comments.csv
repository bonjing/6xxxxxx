""six episodes. you cant call that a season. its half a short season at best. crazy stuff""
In England, 6 eps is usually a normal season...  Just FYI.
We Americans are used to 20+ ep seasons, but I think AMC either wanted to preserve the comic-book nature of TWD with a limited season, or they felt the nature of the series was too risky to invest a full season in."
,TraumaHound,2010-12-06T19:36Z,"I downloaded a different torrent of the same file (not tagged from VTV but same file name.) Is the sync issue I found in the other file present in this one too?

...other torrent was from AiTB (had to look for it.)"

How about you talk about an episode noone's seen yet there instead of fucking spoiling it for the rest of us?

Thanks VTV."
,guavajava,2010-12-12T04:04Z,"This show totally sucks, they didn't even use real zombies they're just actors dressed like them..."
,tomhas69,2010-12-13T01:29Z,"its only 6 episodes because they are all hour long which is double a normal show so technically this is 12 episodes
idiots "
,Sankkeri,2010-12-15T21:59Z,"tomhas69, so if there's 20 one hour episodes of house on one season, so it means there's technically 40 episodes?"
,tgranger9,2010-12-27T13:28Z,"Google themes for walking dead, apply one & search in Style:

,shinobiXRT,2010-12-31T02:28Z,"episodes are not an hour long they are 45 mins long.

and what a crap ending to the season. typical writers block with ""lets wait last second before we leave zombie infested exploding centre"""
,hortonofdoom,2011-01-10T21:20Z,Haaaaaaaaaaateeeeee that the series are too fuckin short :(
,GrandProphecy,2011-01-23T19:29Z,It's 1 hour long with commercials.  Also all the guns would have been looted.  Those weapons were from the sheriff station's gun safe.
,Dig1taL,2011-05-08T15:08Z,Is the video/audio out of sync?
,JustPokie,2011-06-14T05:19Z,"why do people bitch about these torrents when they are free? damn son shut up and enjoy life.
