I apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.

I see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. 

Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. 

Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.
