Vigilance of Talos V for OS/2 Warp            

------------------------------

This game is only for IBM OS/2 and eComStation.

------------------------------

Getting Started
---------------
This game is designed for OS/2 Warp 4 or OS/2 Warp 3.0 with FixPak 26 or higher. Hardware requirements are:

    * An IBM DART Sound System Compatible Sound Card
    * An IBM DIVE Compatible VGA or higher display (for DIVE version)
    * An OS/2 VGA Compatible card (For Full Screen version)
    * 2 megs free hard drive space
    * CD-ROM Drive (Game requires CD-ROM in drive during gameplay)

Installation is very simple. The install program allows you to specify a directory for the files that need to be on your hard disk. (The documentation says that two megabytes of space is necessary, but I only see about half a megabyte being used.) The installation program creates a folder on the Desktop that contains program objects for the full screen and DIVE versions, as well as a small text file with information on installing and playing the game. Once the installation is completed, clicking on one of the program objects will begin your adventure.


The Game
---------------

You control a character named Killian Jaraad who is searching for his 5 year old daughter, Colesce, who has been kidnapped by the evil Xenos. The story surrounding the game is as follows (more or less from the game documentation):

    3021 AD: Killian Jaraad, a starship technician and single parent, boarded a colonial transport with his 5 year old daughter Colesce. En route to the colony on Sur 4, the colonial transport was attacked by biological ships belonging to the Xenos, a highly organized collection of hostile alien races. Jaraad and Colesce were separated, and Jaraad watched from his escape pod as the Xenos ships fled the wreckage of the colonial transport. Convinced Colesce had died aboard the transport, Jaraad devoted his life to destroying the Xenos once and for all. For three years Jaraad trained as a mercenary and weapons expert, tracking down and destroying Xenos ships and bases.

    3024 AD: A mercenary known as E. Red gives Jaraad a crucial piece of information; the Xenos have been collecting human slaves and are holding them on a planet in the Talos V system. With the realization that Colesce could be one of the prisoners, Jaraad heads towards Talos V, prepared to investigate each of the three planetary bases in that system in order to find his daughter. And so it begins...

Your objective:
----------------
    Find, and destroy the evil Drektor, the leader of the Xenos. He is a tough, and worthy opponent. His brain hides in different forms, so he'll be hard to find, but you'll know him when you see him.

If you are familiar with games like Sonic the Hedgehog, you'll be blasting the bad guys (GIF, 23.7k) in no time with Vigilance. This is a 2-D game (GIF, 24.7k), controlled by either the keyboard or a joystick. As you move through the world (GIF, 24.8k), you encounter friendly aliens who offer advice on where to go and what to do. You can also pick up new weapons and ammunition that you will need to advance past certain obstacles.

Because of the short period between the time the game shipped and the editorial deadline, I haven't progressed very deeply into the game, so I can't tell you about any glorious battles with the evil Drektor, but given the addictiveness of this game, I'm sure it won't be long before such battles take place.
