,heath75,2010-12-09T12:15Z,"Use Xilisoft HD Video Converter,
Then you will get audio on your ps3!"
[T],fachman,2010-12-09T12:20Z,"xbox users should refer to the forum from the link above and consult there their issues.

PS3 owners should reset to defaults their settings coz probably they have set sound commpressed raw output which is normal for AC3 and DTS but is wrong in case of AAC. I dont know any amplifier which could uncompress aac from raw stream so it must be PS3 which decompress it and send as PCM."
,HyperManTT,2010-12-09T13:41Z,The video sticks a lot with my GOM player. I saw your media settings in the photo but what player is that?
[T],fachman,2010-12-10T00:20Z,Media Player Classic Home Cinema Edition. There is the link to the newest version in player folder.

,Silveone43,2010-12-22T10:42Z,for some reason the background music is WAY too loud and i cant even hear the dialogue most of the time...this is just in the sample but i've experienced this before while watching a different movie.
[T],fachman,2010-12-24T00:16Z,"People, believe me AAC soundtrack in this movie is converted to be almost transparent to DTS HD core track, but AAC is NEW codec and sometimes causes problems due to misconfiguration of your device player. There are problemms in default settings of MPC HC as well so you need to check PLAYER folder. This fixes basic issues, but if you want to hear full quality you need to change other settings as well - OUTPUT BITDEPTH to 24bits, VOLUME REGAIN etc."
,JustMe327,2010-12-28T07:58Z,File is being tracked by WB.
