,Kooblukhan,2010-12-12T06:38Z,"Thanks for all the movies onoffon :)

I was wondering if anyone knew of a place to find ipod compatible ups of other current tv shows, like house, the mentalist, how i met your mother, nikita, the big bang theory, castle, boardwalk empire, eureka, warehouse 13, etc...

I have been able to find scattered ups of my shows, but as my sound card is broken at the moment i cannot watch them anywhere but my phone and cannot seem to re-encode with sound now either, so i would SUPER appreciate any help.  Used to just use eztv.it lol but now not so much."
