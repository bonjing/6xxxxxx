Linval Thompson is a true reggae original. As a young singer and songwriter, Linval was the quintessential roots vocalist who also scored hits in the loverâ€™s rock mode; as a quick-witted producer, he helped germinate the contemporary dancehall style. This album features rare tracks and unreleased versions, only recently discovered, from a golden era in Jamaicaâ€™s rich musical history. Over the years Linval amassed a collection of his own, exclusive, versions. It is a collection built on an exchange of talents; Linval would voice a track for the legendary Osbourne Ruddock, aka King Tubby, and in return, rather than a straight payment, he would have access to the tapes to mix versions for his own use. In addition to Linval trading his services with Tubby for the rhythm tracks, he would make a similar deal with some of the vocalists that he would engineer, or produce. The end result is an album of unreleased vocal cuts by Jamaicaâ€™s greats, over unreleased versions of Tubbyâ€™s rhythms. It doesnâ€™t get much better.

This compilation compiles Tubby mixed tracks which were done exclusively for his sound system. According to the liner notes the CD it "Was effectively mastered with valve stages and analogue tape, without the use of computers or other digital technology, resulting, we feel, in a superior sound that is closest to what the producers and artists originally intended".
