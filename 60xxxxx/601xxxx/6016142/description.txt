Starring Bradley Cooper (The Hangover) and Liam Neeson (Taken), The A-Team is an all-action blockbuster from the director of Smokin' Aces, Joe Caranahan.

The A-Team follows the exciting and daring exploits of John "Hannibal" Smith (Neeson), Templeton "Faceman" Peck (Cooper), Captain "Howling Mad" Murdock (Sharlto Copley - District 9) and Sgt Bosco "B.A." Baracus (Quinton "Rampage" Jackson): renegade Special Forces soldiers framed for a crime they did not commit. Going "rogue," the team must utilize their unique talents - and eccentricities - to clear their names and find the true culprit.

Also starring Jessica Biel (Valentine's Day), The A-Team is a thrilling reimagining of Stephen J. Cannell and Frank Lupo's seminal eighties TV series, featuring epic set pieces and some of the most insane stunts ever seen.
