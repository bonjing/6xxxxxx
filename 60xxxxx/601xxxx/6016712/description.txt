2010 album from the R&B superstar and three-time Grammy Award winner. Love Letter stylistically pays tribute to legends such as Sam Cooke and Marvin Gaye. The lead single, â€˜When A Woman Loves,â€™, draws on both his R&B roots and his undeniable pop prowess to make a modern day Soul classic. In a musical landscape dotted with one hit wonders, R. Kelly is embarking on the next chapter in an almost 20 year success story. The Chicago native reigns as the King of R&B with six #1 albums, 11 #1 singles and 12 consecutive platinum albums.
