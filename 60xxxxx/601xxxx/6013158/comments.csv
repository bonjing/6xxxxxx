,Ckouna,2010-12-05T22:27Z,"Hi HD-R-US,
I love your torrents, the quality is always perfect, so thanks alot for that !

Could you add an IMDB link in the torrent description in your future uploads ?
This way we can have a quick glimpse at the trailer or synopsis to make sure it's what we're looking for (of course there's always google, but I just thought it'd be nice)

sry if I made any english mistakes ..."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-05T23:13Z,"Hi, Ckouna. Your English is great, and thank you!

You have probably missed it, but if you look at the top of the page, I have added a IMDb links to all of my releases. Just above ""Spoken language(s)""... it's easily missed. =)"
,Ckouna,2010-12-06T16:56Z,"Just saw it thanks !

Next time I'll try to be more careful before posting :)"
,cheekychappy,2010-12-12T23:40Z,WILL VLC player play this one
,Kadoma,2010-12-14T06:17Z,"@cheekychappy.

The ISO file contains the .m2ts file. As it say's in the description:
The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named ""00000.m2ts""
VLC will play this. On Mac just right click ""show contents"", on Windoze...don't know, you'll have to figure out how to open the ISO."
,pc_nerd,2010-12-20T11:15Z,Hey stuck on 98.1% here
,pc_nerd,2010-12-22T01:21Z,"It finished downloading yay

Video 10/10

,kadappa,2010-12-28T01:30Z,Thanks :)
,insoc_cr,2011-01-12T22:01Z,"Thank you very much for such a great transfer! I followed your easy instructions, burn the iso image to a regular DVD with imgburn and the movie plays great in both my home theater Panasonic blu ray player and in my PC using powerdvd. You have created actually a new format! It fits an entire regular DVD but it has better image than an actual DVD!
Keep up the excellent work! Congrats!!!!"

,zekas,2011-01-22T23:36Z,"hello nice quality but i cant find any portuguese subtiles for blu-ray format and .srt files dont seem to work. Any solution??
thank you for your help"
,chipster314,2011-01-30T02:03Z,"First off Thanks
 I am new to this so I am wondering once extracted can this be streamed from my PC through Xbox 360.. I think I extraced it ..is it a Power ISO file now?"
,sushh,2011-02-21T14:32Z,"I doubted this was 1080p, and the doubt slapped me across the face. +1 Thanks for this upload. I think I found me a legit uploader."
,Vanvanero,2011-02-25T09:32Z,"First of all thank you for your excellent uploads, how can't believe how good they look and sound.

However, I'm having a problem with The Expendables AVCHD iso file. I have downloaded it twice and wrote with both ImgBurn and the Win7 default burner but both my BRay players refuse to play it, they recognize it but eject them with a ""check disk"". I had that before with another title but it got fixed with a second download. This one continues to do the same. I guess there is no ""Expendables"" for me.

Great job and thanks a million."
,sushh,2011-02-28T06:01Z,"Thanks, perfect quality, awesome download size."
,inspector23,2011-03-12T15:30Z,thanx
,Dhatz,2011-04-19T09:11Z,"if you ever have problems with skipping frames in fullhd, then disable underclocking in windows 7(just google it) and try all these players: Media Player Classic, SMplayer(this remembers playback position), VLC."
,Mako94,2011-11-01T20:28Z,Subtitles aren't working to me on any player... On VLC they just blink for 0.5 sec. Any help?
