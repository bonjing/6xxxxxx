,Lucy1948,2010-12-05T11:40Z,Does anyone know who the narrator is?
,christhebaker,2010-12-05T14:53Z,I was hoping someone would ask that. The guy is Richard Matthews [the guy who read Bill Bryson - A Short History of Nearly Everything] and the girl is Kate Reading.
,Keiko1981,2011-09-29T20:52Z,"Kate Reading, read The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan together with Michael Kramer."
,nappyboss,2012-04-13T12:59Z,"That's funny, I thought, cos the male reader certainly sounded like Simon Vance to me, and who was this Richard Matthews anyway?  I discovered today that Richard Matthews was a pseudonym used by Vance until 2006 only.  Vance is a top notch reader who did The Millenium Trilogy memorably, apart from many other things, and speaks some Scandinavian, evidently, making him perfect for Nordic tales."
