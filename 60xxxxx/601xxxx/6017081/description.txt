An hour-long live hindustani vocal performance by duo Rajan and Sajan Mishra of Raga Shree at the Osho Commune and in the spirit of the venue the rendition is meditative. (My rip from cassette).

The audio quality may not be as good as CD-rips but i thought it would be better to rip the cassettes from my collection before they disintegrated and i feel these recordings are rare and interesting enough to share.
