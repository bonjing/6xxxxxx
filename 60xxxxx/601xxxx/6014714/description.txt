Ripped from a DVD originally upped by geogaddi000, Thanks!!!

This short documentary by Matthew Vincent and Mendal Kaelen, tells the story of Ron Wealock, a man formerly of Kansas, who now lives a Shamanistic life in the Amazon Rainforest. He told his friends his dream was to pay off his debts and move into the Rockies, with hopes of running into a medicine man who might make him his apprentice. They told him he was crazy, but that didn't hold him back. He now lives a life in tune with nature, learning about the natural world, especially concerning plant knowledge. Wealock takes Vincent & Kaelen on a tour of where he lives, in which he shows them some of the indigenous plants and teaches them of their uses. We also see him partake in a few ceremonies; see what makes up his daily life; and learn about his philosophy regarding what it is he does, and why it is he does it. While it is odd to see a "Gringo Shaman" living as a hermit in the amazon, he really is quite a sweet man, and truly does seem happy...so good on him!!! We should all learn a little lesson from Ron Wealock, the Gringo Shaman.
