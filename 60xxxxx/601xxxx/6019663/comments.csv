i've just recent found your page, and have downloaded a couple of movies but mostly tv shows. quality is always excellent & a joy to watch.

and now with this upload you have reminded me of a film i watched years ago, loved it but over time forgotten about it (the cutting edge), currently downloading it & can't wait to watch it again.

thank you so much for all your hard work.
take care :-)"

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-08T09:45Z,"@himansu_007: GO! was encoded again, when I've seen that old 272p (one I said I still have) was heavily corrupted.
This new GO! is BluRay 480p and because of the format cannot ""fit"" into this torrent.
I'll up it in nearest future.

In fact, I was happy with that misshaping, what gave me opportunity to watch early Katie Holmes (with yellow teeth) once again.

,redriding,2010-12-08T11:29Z,Thank you!... quite the collection... (Devil) being my choice out of the lot... :)
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-08T11:52Z,"@ALL: Seeding server is down, temporary I hope. I can do nothing about. Meanwhile - share the bytes you already have - about 80 GB is already out.

,banukaknight,2010-12-09T05:56Z,"hope the serves will upp soon
im getting 2.6kpbs speed"
,azrielle,2010-12-09T13:27Z,"Been averaging about 15-20 kBps since it was posted--only have about 48% of roughly 5.5 GB.  Hope your seeding server goes back up sometime soon--this is getting ""old""! (have been continuously seeding what I have as well, ~52kBps/6 slots)"
,azrielle,2010-12-09T14:07Z,Hooray--the server's back!
,azrielle,2010-12-09T14:18Z,.....aaand its back down again. :(
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-09T19:18Z,"@azrielle: Server was down four hours on day when I posted my call for patience, it was - yesterday as matter of fact. 

I am almost sure that something else on side of downloaders is wrong (wrong programs and settings) or ""throttling"" by their ISP or payed shills (quite a bunch visits my torrent frequently) because I tested the server when he came up with extremely big test-download (1.5GB to be sure) and achieved in seconds full speed - 3 Giga per second.

Basically, with all ""handshaking"" stuff really fast downloaders need less than 32 minutes for whole content."
,sinner77,2010-12-12T15:41Z,hell low d/l speed....why??
