SimTown is a 1995 computer game published by Maxis, much like the best selling SimCity and Sims but on a smaller scale. SimTown allows the player to construct a town consisting of streets, houses, businesses and parks and then control the people in it. SimTown was one of the many 'Sim' spin-offs at the time, and was targeted more towards children.
