Thanks!

NOTE: THIS WOULD NOT LOAD FROM DISC. I have not tried loading from a USB loader but i have repeatedly tried running from disc using all known soft-mod and cIOS configurations using two independant PAL Wii consoles and could not get it to run :-(

Can anyone confirm this works via a USB Loader?

,cherryrussell,2011-01-01T03:28Z,"Will not load from USB Loader GX and the disk requires you do a system upgrade, which will override the usb loader system and you have to reinstall the system from the SD card, any idea why this will not load and have tried Iso 222 and 223."
