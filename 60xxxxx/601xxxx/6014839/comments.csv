,RoopeJJ,2011-03-06T13:12Z,"I got bops in ps3... i wanted to test it with my PC and check out the differences between these platforms.
Singleplayer works fine and is awesome looking with both platforms. Pc version needed few updates tough to get working properly.
Multiplayer is awesome, after patched few times.. ( ps3 )
Cant get multiplayer working with my pc cause i have downloaded it so cant give any comment.. i tested this dl but did not work on my computer... it only crashes the game. If theres someone who got it working, pm here and give ur comment for those poor bastards who dont hawe money to buy whis game!"

,jigsaw766,2011-03-27T21:35Z,Doesn't work! Just freezes as soon as you launch multiplayer.
