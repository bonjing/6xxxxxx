,TheJiant,2011-02-10T05:15Z,"For everyone asking how to install:


Download the files here.

Load your phone into your computer so it is used as a disk drive.

Go into your phone so you can see all the folders.

Make a folder called ""Apps""

Move the .apk files you JUST downloaded that you want into that ""Apps"" folder.

Download Astro File Manager and open it.

Guide yourself to your ""Apps"" folder

Click on any of the apps you see there.

Click on Install.

It's super easy."
