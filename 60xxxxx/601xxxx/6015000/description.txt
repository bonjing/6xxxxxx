"Murray Christmas"

When Rallo's teacher forces him to spend the 
weekend at a retirement home to get to know the 
senior citizens during the holidays, he meets 
Murray (guest voice Reiner), who teaches him 
about Hanukkah. In an attempt to rekindle Murray's 
holiday spirit, Rallo helps him escape, but when 
his new friend's health begins to suffer, Rallo 
has to bring Murray back to the home.

Enjoy :)
