The book addresses the problem of various programmable control manufacturers using
different nomenclature and program forms by describing the principles involved and
illustrating them with examples from a range of manufacturers. The text includes:

- The basic architecture of PLCs and the characteristics of commonly used input and
outputs to such systems

- A discussion of the number systems: denary, binary, octal, hexadecimal, and BCD

- A painstaking methodical introduction, with many illustrations, describing how to
program PLCs, whatever the manufacturer, and how to use internal relays, timers,
counters, shift registers, sequencers, and data-handling facilities

- Consideration of the standards given by IEC 1131-3 and the programming methods of
ladder, functional block diagram, instruction list, structured text, and sequential function
chart

- Many worked examples, multiple-choice questions, and problems to assist the reader in developing the skills necessary to write programs for programmable logic
controllers, with answers to all multiple-choice questions and problems given at the end of the book
