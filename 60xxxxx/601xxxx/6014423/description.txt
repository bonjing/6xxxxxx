[center]An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago. During his campaign, however, he's tracked by a veteran cop and an egocentric hit man. [/center]

[center]The people involved with â€œFasterâ€ are obviously fans of the genre, and set out to create a badass homage to 70s revenge and action films, but there is too much wasted time wasted on unnecessary subplots that just donâ€™t fit or add anything to the movie. The frustrating thing is that this movie is so close to being incredible in many ways, though ultimately there are too many misspent opportunities for â€œFasterâ€ to achieve itâ€™s full potential.

Ran a few filters through this one i dropped the saturation abit thought the colours were wrong they still not right but bit better in my opinion anyway.Ran a smoother filter not much but enough and altered the input/output levels toning the glare down abit.Left the audio untouched ....Not bad its definetly watchable,ive included a sample so you can chose whether its watchable enough or not .Enjoy [/center]
