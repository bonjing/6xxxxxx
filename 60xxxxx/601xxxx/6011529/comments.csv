This is just example one thousand and nine of how bad movie rip off games are.

,Mysterious2k10,2010-12-13T09:45Z,"REALLY fast torrent, got 2mb/s. Installed the game fine following the instructions, and played for it 3 hours, no problem.

But wait, there's a con. The game didn't save! What's up with that? I see no option to save it manually.. so I figured it was auto-saving.

Other than that, it's all good. Using Win7 Ulitimate (64-bit)

If anyone knows how to fix the save problem, post back. Thanks!"
,Jona198102,2010-12-13T16:08Z,"Re: Saving:

When the Games for Windows Live screen comes up at the start of the game, you will want to create an offline profile.

I just figured this out because Microsoft are a bunch of tools.. Anyway, you need to create a new profile. When THAT screen opens, SCROLL down. You should see an option to create an offline profile.

That's all you need to do. After that, your progress will be saved as you go through the game.

I couldn't find the offline profile for the longest time but finally saw the scroll option when setting up Batman: Arkham Asylum. It's just not made to be obvious like its even there the way the app opens the window. Again, thank you Micro$oft.

Re: Black Screen at Startup / Hangs.

I also fixed this when setting up Batman: Arkham Asylum. Zone Alarm interferes with the game start. Disable any installed 3rd-party firewalls and any anti-virus programs and the game should then load perfectly. After it loads, you can restart those programs by TAB-ing to the desktop and then go back into the game.

Third: I really had such high expectations for this game but I agree with the other commentor. It's not a successor to Tron 2.0. It's like ""The Matrix"" meets ""Tron"" with all the crazy moves which you have to time perfectly or you derez. Major PITA.

All Hail to RELOADED for another game but unlike Batman: Arkham Asylum which is great, I doubt I'll be playing this one much if at all."

If you get the Windows Live screen when starting the game, just hit the ""esc"" button and you are good to go. At least it worked overhere.

Don't forget to copy/paste ALL the files inside the crack folder to the DIR (..../Binaries/Win32Live)

Thanks reloaded, as always 100% working."

,helpinTPBorg,2011-04-23T00:10Z,":::TO ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE SAVING!!:::

Listen to some of the posts. As someone stated, click GridGamelauncherc wait until it loads up, click to play and windows live pops up. click create a new profile and scroll down and click the link at the very bottom ( its in bold like links usually are ) to create an OFFLINE profile. This prevents putting in a serial key, and allowing you to save  :DD. PS. I think saving happens when you visit a disk station! Hope this helps. :)"
,bluenilux,2011-04-26T20:14Z,"This is an awesome game with actions very similar to Prince of Persia games and with absolutely stunning graphics.

No virus in this particular torrent.

This is for them who says it does not work:

SAVING ISSUE:
You need to create a local profile. Start the game using GridGamelauncherc.exe, now when windows live pops up, choose to create a new profile, then scroll down and click the link at the bottom which says create a local profile. It will ask for a profile name. Type your profile name and you're done.

The game saves your progress every time u reach a check-point (this happen quite frequently unlike any other game)

SYSTEM CRASH/RESTART ISSUE:
This could happen if u are using XP SP2. This game does not work with SP2, you'll need SP3 or even better if u are using windows 7.

If you really like this game, BUY IT!"
