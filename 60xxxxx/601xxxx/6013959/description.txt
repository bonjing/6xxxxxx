"Merry Axemas" offers brand new recordings from ten of the world's leading rock guitarists. In the words of executive producer Steve Vai, "Whether it's joy, spiritual devotion or the proverbial good cheer, the holiday vibe inspires some of the warmest , most sacred â€“ and yes, cornballest â€“ melodies even written. And what better instrument to praise these profound melodies than the guitar? The challenge was to invite special kinds of guests to this particular Yuletide extravaganza: players who could coax, caress or slam out a unique voice from the instrument ,and unite the spirit of Christmas with the beautiful tones of silver strings."

"Merry Axemas Vol. 2" offers all new recordings from ten of the world's leading rock guitarists. In the words of executive producer Steve Vai, "After the success of 'Merry Axemas' the search was on for inspired guitar players to cosmically merge their stellar talents together and create a package of vital instrumental Christmas classics that could uplift and rejuvenate the wilting Yuletide psyche of the depraved twang lover. This will hopefully conjure up (in a mystic driven frenzy) worldwide peace and enlightenment on a universal level on par with that of the birth of the son of man himself. Well, maybe not, but what the hey, it's a cool record with some great players."
