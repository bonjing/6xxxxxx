Nena - 99 Red Balloons [Top of the Pops 1984].VOB



HQ rare "Top of the Pops" tv show promo performance. Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.

Each weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.

"99 Luftballons" is a protest song by the German singer Nena. Originally sung in German, it was later re-recorded in English as "99 Red Balloons".

"99 Luftballons" reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the original German version also peaked at #2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart and this English-language version topped the UK Singles Chart. The German version topped the Australian charts for five weeks and the New Zealand charts for one week.
 
The translation of the title is sometimes given as "Ninety-Nine Air Balloons", however "Ninety-Nine Balloons" is also correct. A Luftballon is a colourful toy balloon, rather than a balloon for transport or research.
