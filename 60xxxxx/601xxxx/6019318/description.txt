Studmuffin is a fresh Belgian (Roeselare, Ghent) band consisting of Sarah Braeye from Icey Beau (voice, synth), Tim Verbrugghe (voice, guitar, sax), Tom Sercu from Whalefish/Flogiston (percussion) and Ruben Verhack from Losdovan (bass).

The style is hard to describe, you can call it easy accessible indie-rock/pop with a bluesy side.
