,cranswick,2010-12-07T06:09Z,Blimey! - Pretty heavy stuff. Lost me after the first Chapter. Anyone know of any 'stem cel' torrents?
,annabelle31,2010-12-07T08:17Z,"@cranswick: Look for ""The Code Book"" by Simon Singh. It is more prose than technical but it will give you a firm grasp on the field and the history of it. Highly recommended.

Oh, and Mantesh, thanks for this one! ;-)"
