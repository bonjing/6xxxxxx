,Bokey_Boy,2011-01-24T23:10Z,@ emilyvega these songs work just fine. i downloaded them and listen to them. NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!
[T],rjordan21,2011-01-28T20:37Z,"All songs are labeled:

Artist/Album/#/Track

Nothing terrible about it at all..."
,jtrehern,2011-01-29T03:16Z,@emilyvega you are an idiot.  There is nothing wrong with this torrent.  The songs sound fine and are labeled correctly.  Thanks Legendarien for the GREAT upload!  
[V],Scrufuss,2011-02-05T09:51Z,"This torrent ROCKS both literally and figurativly. When I started playing the tracks I was flooded with old school memories and I can not figure why I did not look for these songs sooner..
AND U made them at CBR 320 Kbps where most dolts make tracks at a lower rate... 
U ROCK buddy."
