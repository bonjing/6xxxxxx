I see that the uploader has a skull and is therefore likely to be trustworthy, but something is going on here.  

I haven't downloaded pictures in years until yesterday, and out of about 6 torrents, 3 of them were infected.  Two of those from uploaders with skulls. 

I've been using TPB for years, and I've only once ever detected a legitimate virus before.  I scan everything I get.  Then yesterday detect three coming from porn>pictures....

So be careful people."
