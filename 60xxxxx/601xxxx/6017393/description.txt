ENGLISH HARDCODED SUBTITLES

J' Accuse (1938)

Review
Abel Ganceâ€™s remake of his earlier 1919 film displays all the passion and power of that earlier film, but with the addition of sound to articulate the directorâ€™s protest against war. The final scenes where the dead soldiers return to life are haunting and beautifully filmed, but earned the film a horror classification when released in the UK.

Gance felt compelled to make this film when he saw Europe drifting inexorably towards a second major conflict and reflected an oft-held view that political leaders, not ordinary men and women, cause wars. Needless to say, his words were not heeded and with the onset of war, the film was banned.

Synopsis
Sickened by the experience of war, having served in the trenches during World War I, Jean Diaz dedicates his life to perfecting a machine that will prevent future wars. Although he thinks he has succeeded, his invention is used by the government as a weapon. In a last desperate measure of retaliation, Diaz conjures up the buried dead of World War I from their graves...
