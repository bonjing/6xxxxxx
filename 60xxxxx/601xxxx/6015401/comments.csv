Don't be douches, guys, even just tweaking your upload speed to a max of 25 kb/s will help everyone who wants this torrent."
,Captlet,2010-12-19T03:07Z,A bit more pixelated than some of the others but nice to have all in one package.     Download was quick.  Currently seeding up at about 200kB/s.  Will keep going for at least a couple days.

,mnutzz,2011-04-20T16:38Z,"My email to my ISP was from BayTSP, I imagine they just connect to a torrent and have software that logs every IP it connects too.  

Which would mean they are also sharing the file themselves :D tut tut"

ur a tool. there are billions of city dwelling zombies that will EVENTUALLY make their way out to the woods and eat ur face. what are your traps going to do when a whole pack comes? what you need to do is move to an island and live off the land. 

@ChloeJones 
ur an even bigger tool than that guy ^
AMC has a tonne of money; ever heard of Breaking Bad?... The Walking Dead season 2 is scheduled for 13 episodes so go pan-handle somewhere else biatch
