,retardoface,2010-12-07T20:58Z,HMV! man could you redo black sabbath - selftitled causse IMO thats the best sounding version available and requires a redo lower volume
[V],HMVinyl,2010-12-07T23:09Z,"sure thing, I'm gonna do Pink Floyd - Meddle first, then I'll do Sabbath, possible followed by Blizzard of Ozz. I saw Ozzy live a few weeks ago, and I'm in a huge metal mood :P"
