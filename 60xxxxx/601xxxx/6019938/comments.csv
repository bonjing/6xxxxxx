Audio doesn't come in till 1:15, Video comes in @ 1:40.  There is a clear sensor in the center throughout and silhouetted people getting up in front of the cam periodically throughout.  The audio is almost completely inaudible, but can possibly be massaged to use with another cam, but the missing pieces will probably keep that from happening.  

The upload is greatly appreciated, but the quality is terrible, so unless you simply cannot wait to see this, I suggest waiting.  I will seed this for 24 hours, then it's trashed. "
