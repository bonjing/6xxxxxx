so..........what

are u accepting..........i couldn't understand your answer"
,CiTiRc,2010-12-04T17:23Z,"To all those people who are reading, i would like to say that this uploader Herakler is great.

@ Herakler

hey dude, i just wanna say one thing, have patience, if those fools who are downloading movies from extremezone and raymondhome are happy with that quality for a size of 1.36 Gb in .avi , its just time when u will be on the top. Just keep the quality up and the size around 700 Mb ( +- 100).

Matroska is the future.

I'm gonna recommend u for a skull.

Seriously if u give such rips.....................

Also one more advice, do rips of movies which get release recently. 

u know : twilight series, harry potter series and other such stuff. They will get the attention of the people. 


be PATIENT please ( and consistent)."
,CiTiRc,2010-12-04T17:25Z,"also my email is citirc@ymail.com, if u need."
,jarman007,2010-12-04T17:36Z,"ya citirc is right

i recommend you to upload harry potter series

HP7 is going great guns at Box office and people will like to other movies of the series (again) as well"
[T],Herakler,2010-12-04T18:06Z,"@Everyone : Thanks for support and I'm very glad you like my movies .

Maybe you can help me. I'm lookin for a movie called Big Shots (1987) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092655/

If you could find and post that one it'd be really awesome.


Also any old skool Gary Coleman flicks too.
