Max Keiser & guest exposes Tea Party as Zionist front


I give the times in the video that are relevant to specific points below, but please just watch the whole thing, it's less that 28 mins long.

The guest interview part starts at 14:14. The part that specifically implicates Zionists / Wall Street / Sarah Palin starts at about 17:45. Rand Paul doesn't look too good here, either, having accepted funds galore from the bankers.

They are careful to point out (at about 17:05) that Ron Paul himself is NOT affiliated with this. Rather, he is the progenitor of a second, entirely distinct, non-co-opted version of the Tea Party, NOT the Tea Party run by the Zionist / Wall Street / Sarah Palin wing. We, as usual, see Right-wing Christian Theology, Zionist Supremacy, and Big Money walking hand in hand. As usual the Liberal Center Middle-class is their fictitious enemy.

The excellent point is made that the co-opted, top-down Zio-Christian autocratic rulership of the Tea Party always stops them from doing anything useful. They don't care about the Fed. They are concerned that "Government will take over the banks" (aka they want the banks to continue to have a completely free hand, absent any and all regulation...no rule of law, no public control, nothing for the people). They fight hard for their pensions and medical care to be guaranteed while they turn around and in the same breath say "but kill social programs for the poor". Above all: war, war, war. Let's fight wars under the guise of "support our military". Of course it just happens that all these target civilizations are enemies of Israel and the NWO, people that are renouncing global corporate fascism, seeking their own currencies and policies, their own power. Is a free economy a Corporatocracy? Well, sure it is, if you're a TeaPartier (Ron Paul's small faction excepted...don't get me wrong.)

If I were an elitist, I could think of no better tool to advance my goals than the Ziochristian Tea Party. It seems I'm not alone in this.
