The much anticipated album of newly completed recordings from Michael Jackson. Includes the songs he most recently created along with tracks that Michael had a desire to bring to fruition. The album cover of MICHAEL was created by painter Kadir Nelson; the oil painting, created in 2009, takes us on a journey through some key moments and important people in Michael Jacksonâ€™s life.

Please SEED for others to Enjoy!
Cheers, Bubanee
