Johnny Cash - American Recordings [1994] lossless XLD-FLAC

TORRENT NOTES - 12-4-2010 (reseed due to problems with first upload)

Lineage: Silver > XLD-FLAC

This rip was made from the original 1994 CD release (not one of the subsequent re-issues), and the CD is in excellent condition. I ripped it to FLAC using the current updated version of XLD for Mac, running 10.6.5, using XLD's CD Paranoia Mode. Drive offset corrected, drive doesn't cache audio data. No errors on the rip. I included cover art as well as FLAC fingerprints and an MD5 file, the latter 2 generated with xACT.

Over the last couple of years I've I managed to find torrents of the other 5 albums in the American series (Vols. 2-6) in FLAC format (EAC-FLAC in most cases), but all lossless torrents for this first volume are currently dead (I've been using an MP3 source in iTunes). So I bought this like new CD via Amazon for CHEAP and ripped it losslessly myself. Hope you enjoy it as much as I have !!!
