This upload contains the eleventh episode in Upstairs, Downstairs - Season 1 - (1972 - 1974) with the subtitle file recently created for it.

Considerable effort was made to modify the video for this episode. The length of it was shortened to make it look like my other upload of it. Also the audio and video synchronization was changed to be better. 

The same will occur for the next two episodes of Season 1 if necessary.

Once again, I say, I don't know how far I will go with this kind of writing.

At the same time I'm doing this, I am also writing subtitle files for another BBC miniseries, The Pallisers 1974, of which the first two are complete and uploaded.
