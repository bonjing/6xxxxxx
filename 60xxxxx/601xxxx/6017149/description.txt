Calexico - Hot Rail (2010)(Remastered Deluxe Edition)(2CD)






Calexico is a Tucson, Arizona-based Americana / Alternative country band. The band\'s two main members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, first played together in Los Angeles as part of the group Giant Sand. They have recorded a number of albums on Quarterstick Records, while their 2005 EP In the Reins recorded with Iron & Wine has reached the Billboard 200 album charts. Their musical style is influenced by traditional Latin sounds of mariachi / conjunto / cumbia / Tejano music and also the Southwestern United States country music as well as \'50s-\'60s jazz and \'90s-\'00s post-rock, and they have been described by some as \"desert noir\" or indie rock. The band is named for the border town of Calexico, California.
