Man... to place video files in rar form is more then suspicious.... 

specially when there is no need for rar format! "
,t2BeDLaM,2010-12-06T16:49Z,"LOLOL, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Cant people read? this a torrent of a BUNCH of YOUTUBE videos!

someoen download this and then break it up, 
There are at least 30 small youtube videos in here.
and NO torrent I have is flagged as a virus.

If you can read it said someone flagged the windows 1.0 as one and deleted without checking it.  After it WAS checked I was allowed to post it.

wow, no wonder obama is in office!

now if you want this NOT in rar form, then you upload the 30 plus youtube videos that are in here.
Before popping off, try actually learning about what you are complaining about.
lololol"
