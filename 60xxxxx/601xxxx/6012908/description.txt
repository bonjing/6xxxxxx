This download is all the game system emulators and related files I have downloaded over the years.
I have tested all of them so far but how well they work on your computer depends on your hardware and software configuration as well as how skilled you are in self trouble shooting. (Yes, it can be a pain to set these up to run properly so please don't complain... For-warned is for-warned !)
Anyone who wants to update this package, please feel free to do so.
I'll seed for as long as is reasonable... If you want more seeders, become one yourself. :-)
