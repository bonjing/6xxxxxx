Well, I will be cooking Christmas dinner listening to this. But will it make any impression when not protected by the sentimentality of the season? Kate Rusby sings a selection of carols and some other festive tunes. She is backed by a small band, generally four musicians - a couple of guitars, an accordion and a bass, or a similar variation; on just under half of the tracks she is also joined by five musicians from the Grimethorpe Colliery Band. It is all very pleasant.
