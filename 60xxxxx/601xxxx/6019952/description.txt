This is a set of orchestral works by Rachmaninov, performed by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Mariss Jansons.

Contains:
 * Three symphonies
 * Isle of the Dead
 * Vocalise (from Songs, op. 34)
 * Scherzo in D
 * Symphonic Dances

This set was included in my first Rachmaninov torrent, but I have re-uploaded them here since the originals had imperfections.



Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
