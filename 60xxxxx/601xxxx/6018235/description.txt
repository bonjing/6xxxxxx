Sandra 2011 - the latest version of its award-winning utility which includes remote analysis, benchmarking and diagnostic features for PCs, servers, PDAs1, Smart Phones1, small office/home office (SOHO) networks and enterprise networks. SiSoftware Sandra (the System ANalyser, Diagnostic and Reporting Assistant) is an information & diagnostic utility. It should provide most of the information (including undocumented) you need to know about your hardware, software and other devices whether hardware or software. It works along the lines of other Windows utilities, however it tries to go beyond them and show you more of what's really going on. Giving the user the ability to draw comparisons at both a high and low-level. You can get information about the CPU, chipset, video adapter, ports, printers, sound card, memory, network, Windows internals, AGP, PCI, PCI-X, PCIe (PCI Express), database, USB, USB2, 1394/Firewire, etc.

What are the benefits of Sandra's Live Benchmark Ranking:
â€¢ Live access to test results of the latest products on the market, as reviewed by established review websites and magazines. Currently, over 600 publications use SiSoftware products in their reviews - please see the Reviews & Benchmark Results page for the current list of reviews.
â€¢ Live access to thousands of results submitted by other Sandra users, in addition to the hundreds of reference test results provided by SiSoftware.
â€¢ Compare the performance of your devices (or the devices you intend to purchase) in different platforms; check that they meet performance expectations.
â€¢ Find out which devices overclock the best; see how far other users have overclocked the devices you own: get the best performance for your money!
â€¢ Automatic backup and restoring of your test results: Sandra will download them automatically to a new installation, a new computer or any computer on your network.
â€¢ Form teams with your friends or colleagues and get your team to rank highest; share your test results and benefit from those of many other users. Become a part of our worldwide community.
â€¢ Open implementation: SiSoftware is working with other ranking engines and will add further support as soon as possible.

Exciting new features:
â€¢ Hundreds of new reference test results thanks to our community of Beta testers. Our thanks for all their hard work.
â€¢ Support for updated GPGPU Benchmarks: AMD Stream 1.4* and nVidia CUDA 2.2*.
â€¢ Dynamic GPGPU work-load scheduler when using different GPGPU cards in the same system or a dedicated GPGPU card in a system with integrated graphics (IGP) when both support GPGPU features.
â€¢ Improved measurement accuracy in Physical Disks, File Systems, Flash/SSD benchmarks (0.01ms instead of 1ms): now you can measure the fastest new SSDs and other flash devices more accurately.
â€¢ Improved measurement accuracy in Memory Latency, Multi-Core Efficiency benchmarks (0.1ns instead of 1ns): now you can measure the fastest new processors and memory sub-systems more accurately.
â€¢ VIA Nano (mobile) 64-bit processor in Windows Vista SP2*/Server 2008 SP2* and future Windows 7*/Server 2008 R2*.
â€¢ Advanced test results management, including: customisation, import/export to common file formats, download of Ranked test results and integration with Price engines to determine the best value products on the market.
