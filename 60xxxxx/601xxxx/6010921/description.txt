   Release Notes:

   Nimbus is a unique combination of racing & puzzling. The player          
   controls a craft with no means of directly propelling itself and needs   
   to use whatever is scattered around the levels to acquire thrust and     
   reach the goal. Traverse a world map with several distinct islands in    
   order to recover your lost love. Light on story, but heavy on gameplay   
   Nimbus offers several hours of increasingly harder challenges.           
                                                                            
   Over 50 levels available on the main campaign                            
                                                                            
   Unique game play that is easy to understand, but hard to master          
                                                                            
   A varied blend of levels that requires a combination of skill & puzzle   
   solving                                                                  
                                                                            
   Plenty of opportunity for optimizing how you approach each level in      
   order to beat the best times                                             
                                                                            
   Several trails, levels and ships to unlock                               
                                                                            
   Loads of secrets & tricks
