""Enter the Void"" is a very long movie so it would take me around 48 hours to encode it properly. I'd like to do it but I'm not sure I will for that reason. 

Be aware that there are 3 cuts of this movie (Theatrical, Alternative, and possibly Cannes festival submission) and no one has released yet the alternative, uncut version (174 minutes), which comes in the French blu-ray edition, two cuts in one: Theatrical (2h37) & Alternative (2h54).
