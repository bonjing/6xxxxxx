Its probably a tagging issue within pcdj, if you have loaded the file with one date inserted in the tag, and then load the same file with another date in the tag, then ths will cause a conflict, the only thing i can suggest is to remove it from pcdj and reload the file. i had similar problems when i used pcdj, and one of the reasons i moved to virtualdj. hope this helps :o)"
,Furball1954,2010-12-12T00:52Z,I have had te same prob. download Xilisosoft Audio converter and re - encode files this will solve your problems they will then play in PCDJ

Another thing you could do is to use mp3tag (www.mp3tag.de/en/) to edit the tags yourself. You can then delete all the date/comment/genre tags which cause the problems =)"

There is absolutely no need to re-encode the files, simply remove all tags from the file and then convert the ""filename to tag"" using mp3tag.
Hope this helps you in the future."

I don't doubt you are correct but I find it so easy to re-encode in seconds with no input from myself I was only trying to help."
