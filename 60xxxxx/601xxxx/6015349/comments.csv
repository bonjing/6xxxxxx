I wish a nice extraction and happy gaming to you ."

,SOkele11,2010-12-09T01:52Z,"@globe Thank you, great work!
For people with game starting issues, you have to wait some time for game to start, don't run launcher multiple times. If you have firewall and game won't start (you see only black screen), you must ALT+TAB or CTRL+ALT+DEL to change to firewall and set permission. Update DX, GPU driver, install Games for Windows - LIVE
For me game runs fine, but there are two annoying problems: I can't set 16:9 res (only 4:3 and 5:4) and every time I start the game resolution is back to 640x480"

The file you need is in here:

C:/Users/username/Documents/Disney Interactive Studios/Tron Evolution/UnrealEngine3/GridGame/Config

GridEngine.ini is what you need to modify.

search for
ResX=
ResY=
(they will = the current value)

Then plug in the values you want there, ie

ResX=1920
ResY=1080"

Install latest graphic driver if game is run on your system,

this is most problematic game.

and Most worst game of the year is Tron and Harry potter 7.
