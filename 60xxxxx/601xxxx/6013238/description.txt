Develop high-performance hydraulic and pneumatic power systems

Design, operate, and maintain fluid and pneumatic power equipment using the expert information contained in this authoritative volume. Fluid Power Engineering presents a comprehensive approach to hydraulic systems engineering with a solid grounding in hydrodynamic theory. The book explains how to create accurate mathematical models, select and assemble components, and integrate powerful servo valves and actuators. You will also learn how to build low-loss transmission lines, analyze system performance, and optimize efficiency.
