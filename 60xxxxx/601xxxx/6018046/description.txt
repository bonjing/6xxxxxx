Kathleen Alice (Kathy) Mattea (born June 21, 1959, in South Charleston, West Virginia) is an American country music and bluegrass performer who often brings folk, Celtic and traditional country sounds to her music. Active since 1983 as a recording artist, she has recorded seventeen albums and has charted more than thirty singles on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks charts. This total includes the number one hits \"Goin\' Gone\", \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\", \"Come From the Heart\" and \"Burnin\' Old Memories\", as well as twelve additional Top Ten singles.

Mattea was born in South Charleston, West Virginia, because it had the nearest hospital to her parents\' home in Cross Lanes, where she grew up, graduating from nearby Nitro High School. She discovered her love of singing at Girl Scout camp. In 1976, while attending West Virginia University, she joined the bluegrass band Pennsboro, and two years later dropped out of school to move to Nashville. She worked as a tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame, did backup vocal work for Bobby Goldsboro, and sang demos for several Nashville songwriters and publishers including Nashville songwriter/producer Byron Hill who brought her to the attention of Frank Jones (then head of Mercury Records), who signed her to her first record deal in 1983.

Mattea is 1/4 Scottish and 1/4 Italian on her father\'s side and of Welsh ancestry on her mother\'s side. Mattea\'s third album, 1986\'s folky Walk the Way the Wind Blows, proved to be her breakthrough both critically and commercially. Her cover of Nanci Griffith\'s \"Love at the Five and Dime\" was her first major hit, reaching #3 (and in addition, earned Griffith notice as a songwriter), and the album produced three other top ten songs: \"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" (#10), \"You\'re the Power\"(#5), and \"Train of Memories\" (#6). \"Love at the Five and Dime\" also drew attention because well-known country singer Don Williams sang harmony vocals on the track.

Further hit songs include her first #1, \"Goin\' Gone\"; the truck-driving song \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\" (1988); \"Come From the Heart\" and \"Burnin\' Old Memories\" (both #1 hits in 1989); \"She Came From Fort Worth\" (1990); \"Lonesome Standard Time\" (1992); \"Walking Away a Winner\" (1994); \"Nobody\'s Gonna Rain on Our Parade\" (1994); \"Maybe She\'s Human\" (1994); and \"455 Rocket\" (1997, written by Gillian Welch). \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\" in late May 1988, became the first single by a solo female to spend multiple weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard country singles chart since Dolly Parton\'s \"You\'re the Only One\" in August 1979; both singles were on top of that chart for two weeks.
