,abhikrit,2010-12-08T12:36Z,:) thanks..
,caliwillbemine,2010-12-09T00:23Z,"Thanks, 1080p anyone ?"
,AnderEL,2010-12-09T02:06Z,Good movie :) but thay filmed the part in sweden in JĂ¤mtland not Dalarna  hehe xD
,chewster8,2010-12-09T17:17Z,"Does anyone know if there are non-english parts in this movie, and if the english subtitles are burned in or if the subs provided are for the non-english parts only?"
,Tilley377,2010-12-10T09:49Z,on amazon and imdb the aspect ratio is said to be 2.35 : 1. on blu-ray.com it say 2.39:1. Not sure if this is the true quality of the movie
,Franzipoo,2010-12-10T09:55Z,"Perfect Quality.

-----SPOILER----
I didnt like this movie, I belive its suppose to be more of an artistic film about his life rather then cool events that make us go WOW.
Really not much going on in this film."
,iridis_alpha,2010-12-10T18:22Z,"chewster8, yes there are non english spoken parts in the movie, but there are no hardcoded subs for them and there is no ""foreign spoken"" subs only .. so you have to turn the english subs on just for the foreign parts, then turn them back off again  (a pain in the ass doing this 10 times in a movie) ... so this needs a new subtitle file and Ive not found one yet .. It may even be worth waiting for a SCENE release with the rip done correctly,

,shizilao,2010-12-11T12:36Z,"Video is ok. But I'm pretty sure the audio is an upmix, with an unnatural skew to the right."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-11T21:33Z,i vaguely remember the last DNL release I checked out had the audio tracks mapped incorrectly as well.  seems like that the was case at least.
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-11T22:26Z,chloe was the last one and yea the audio was wonk
,karakorama,2010-12-12T16:42Z,"Thanks, nice movie and great quality."
,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-12T17:53Z,"@Franzipoo:

Thanks for the spoiler alert, it's not everyone that wants to know upfront that you're a dimbwit.

Great movie, thanks for a properly sized 720p instead of the other crap that's been uploaded recently."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T18:28Z,"im watching the 1080p of this.  I experienced DTS dropouts on my stereo.  This seems to be common of new encoders or non scene encoders.  They are using some strange DTS audio handler or something.  To correct it extract the audio and then convert to ac3 with ffmpeg.  Only bother with that if you are having issues like I do.  Also the eng subs are delayed, you can correct that in aegisub.

pretty decent otherwise."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T18:29Z,"it also runs at 25 fps, just fyi."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T20:14Z,"sooo, i just finished watching this... what was the plot line? :)  "
[V],aoloffline,2010-12-13T01:24Z,"    This is from russian bluray.The good thing is that the video looks better than other russian releases.
   The audio is not real DTS.There will be propper releases of this movies ,soon hopfully"
,Boxer.,2010-12-13T11:30Z,tack fĂśr detta. Men skit film
,seedlove,2010-12-13T23:55Z,"This is perfet upload, original audio and a bunch of subtitles.

Thanks, thanks, thanks!"
,Meriksi,2010-12-14T15:17Z,The sound on this sounds like someone tryed to make DTS audio with a audio from a 1982 Walkman while sitting in a tincan. Horrible.
,Fuckinoob,2010-12-15T03:16Z,"You need to change the audio description to:

Format:         DTS
Bit rate:        32Kbps
Channel (s):  1
Sample rate: 0

Comment: Not worth downloading"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-15T04:22Z,"the main problem is the audio channel assignments are incorrect.  DNL uses some sort of software to upconvert to DTS and it doesn't properly map the channel assignments.  DTS doesn't use the same channel assignments as AC3, nor AAC 5.1, or wav 5.1.  if someone is ambitious they will dump the dts to 5.1 wav and then reorder the channels properly to wav 5.1 ordering and then export it to ac3.  its surely not dts, i dont know why they bother trying to fool anyone."
,roadrunnerside8,2010-12-15T09:12Z,"This is Perfect Quality for 720p.

But,

The Movie Sucked.

Artistic sentimental hooker shit. 
Might make a hooker cry."
,cinopher,2010-12-19T02:57Z,Thanks! Definately worth the watch.
,954blade,2010-12-21T21:56Z,Thanks.
,jarrks,2011-01-09T00:17Z,Thanks for the rip! V:10 / A:6 / M:9
,TheOneAdrenalineRush,2011-02-03T17:11Z,"Good quality video, but the audio on the other hand really Sucks! "
,zimmy41,2011-02-28T09:50Z,"OMG what a crap movie! Picture has been chopped down from its original 2,35 : 1 aspect ratio to 16 : 9. So, this is not what the director originally intended you to see.

Movie: 6
Video: 5
Audio: ok"
,mkvluv,2011-03-03T04:52Z,the audio sounds AWEFUL! sounds like we're listening through a door. is there a proper release?
