I've been watching it all this season and it's getting a lot better and the Kling brothers are still learning how to investigate in a style that doesn't upset to many people. I think they are just trying to play the good cop bad cop thing and trying to mimic Zak Bagans up front approach but came across as a bit to angry perhaps.

Could you please upload the latest Ghost lab that airs tonight I think. Thanks a million and keep up the great work."
[T],trialNerror,2010-12-05T01:23Z,"I will upload episodes when I have the chance, so asking me to upload the next episode of any series is rather redundant.  

Some times it will be immediately posted, or other times it will take a while due to either encoding complications or my real life outside and away from the internet.

If you don't see any posts of a show from me at least a week after it was aired, consider me on vacation or retired.

Thanks for your support."
