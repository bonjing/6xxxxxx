VIDEO:From a very good friend ...... AND 46 seconds of the LKRG video ...Thanks mates :)
AUDIO:From the LKRG Release ......Thanks mate :)

Here we are with our source of Faster... This is a new source that was given to us by a good friend thanks bro... First off we took 46 seconds from the LKRG video release to add to the video on this release to make it a full release. The video is much better than the previous source, but still some what cropped. Not bad but none the less thought we would tell you. We\'ve done our normal filtering changing the brightness, contrast, colour, resize etc... Turned out to be a very watchable cam OMI... Now for the audio we used the LKRG release audio as it sounded better that this new sources. Was just a case of muxing that audio to our video.
