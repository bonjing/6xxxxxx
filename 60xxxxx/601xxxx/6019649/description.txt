Recorded in Los Angeles, Strip Me reminds us of the gift
Natasha Bedingfield has for creating smart, substantive pop
music. Writing more than 50 songs, Bedingfield, armed with an
impressive production team of modern hitmakers including
GRAMMY award winner John Shanks (Michelle Branch, Sheryl
Crow), Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic, Kelly Clarkson, Leona
Lewis), Wayne Wilkins (Beyonce, Jordin Sparks), John Hill
(Shakira, Santigold), Kleerup (Robyn, Cyndi Lauper), Danielle
Brisebois ( Unwritten, Pocketful of Sunshine ) and
reuniting with Steve Kipner, who produced Natasha s own smash
hit These Words, has stripped down her songs to the 13
tracks contained on her newest release. Each song on Strip Me
evokes the innate desires, needs and fears which people feel
in these most troubling times. Although the title of the
album is provocative, the songs Natasha writes underscore the
things that are important to her. Bedingfield s message is
clear. Don t get caught up in material things. Don t be
afraid to be loved, to be supported, and to be touched
Believe in yourself and follow your heart. While the album s
theme is soulful, Bedingfield s gifts as a singer and
songwriter continue to reflect that magic spark and
infectious pop sensibility that catapulted her to being the
first British female artist in twenty years to score a no.1
on the U.S. Billboard pop chart with her first smash hit
Unwritten.
