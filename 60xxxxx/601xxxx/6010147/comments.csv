Read the whole .txt.There is a solution for your problem in there.Anyway read this:

1 Make your pc show hidden folders. To do so, go to control panel, go to folder options, click view tab and check hidden folders. works on xp, vista and 7.
2 now go to c:\ProgramData and there you will find a folder named esellerate. Copy that folder.
3 for the people who run two operating systems, the folder should be pasted in c\ programfiles[x86] (if running fsx on windows xp) or d/ program files (if running fsx on windows 7 or vista)
4 for the people who run single operating system either 7, vista or xp should paste the folder in program files directory.
5 you have now solved the problem permanently."
,VED25,2010-12-04T23:11Z,"Yes i read the manual, but still no luck. With the other version where you have to manualy copy everything i have no problems so i use that one now:) "
,OO-VEG,2010-12-04T23:44Z,"@JimStalk, 1. The Concorde never had PW engines. it always had RR/Snecma engines.

,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-05T04:41Z,"@eterglax

What kind of fatal error ? There was no experience by any since yet.
Maybe your pc is bit slow for concorde. What are your specs."
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-05T04:57Z,"To solve the freezing problem in the cockpit you have to be connected to the internet in order to activate, which automatically use to. Then, it will work.

I am trying to fix the internet connecting problem ad as soon as I do I will write the solution.

Another reason is that, if you have installed other addons that require esellerate validation
cause cocorde x to register.

To solve this (maybe it will help)
Uninstall cocorde x
search for esellerate in the whole system.
If found any delete it to recyclebin, not permaently.
Install concorde X and you are done.
