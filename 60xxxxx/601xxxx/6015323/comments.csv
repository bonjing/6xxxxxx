Video quality is terrible on this. Hopefully someone propers this release."
,User897,2010-12-06T13:01Z,Is this true?  Can someone else verify?
,billylopez,2010-12-06T15:09Z,"@ Darkfall666
ur a fuckin wanker!!!!!!
darkfall666 has gone around to every The Walk' Dead torrent saying the same shit
if it was my guess and being TvTeam the torrent should be perfect...
so if TvTeam say 720p its probably 99.0% true"
,DoodleBop,2010-12-06T15:24Z,"Darkfall has made the same exact comment on other torrents. He must be a troll or some bot, don't pay attention."
,lifexp,2010-12-06T19:17Z,Quality is not very good
,User897,2010-12-07T00:17Z,"Great, now there are two naysayers.

Could SOMEONE from the over 200 seeders please comment on quality for fuck's sake?"
,defecator,2010-12-07T10:28Z,Quality really isn't good. There are few P-frames and you can see lots of compression artifacts when there's movement.
,unpocoloco,2010-12-07T17:19Z,"Yes, bad quality, get the proper one."
,unpocoloco,2010-12-07T17:59Z,"Ooops, sorry, but the proper one is just as bad.
And i dont get you billylopez, what is your problem, several f the latest episodes have been bad, do you have something invested in this release or what? "
