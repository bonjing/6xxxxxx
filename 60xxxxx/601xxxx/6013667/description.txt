Hoping to enjoy a nice holiday in the country, McKenzie and her rebellious daughter Chloe travel to a remote Scottish community, but their weekend getaway turns into a nightmare as an escalating series of disturbances force them into desperate fight for their lives. DARK NATURE offers bloody thrills and the blackest of comedy as these women struggle against a brutal attacker who is hiding a secret that threatens to tear them to shreds. In the spirit of psychological horror classics THE SHINING and LONG WEEKEND, this smart thriller has a twisting, turning narrative that creates a sense of dread from the first shot and never lets up until the final seconds.
