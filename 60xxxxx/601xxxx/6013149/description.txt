-------

I received this disc free from Amazon for purchasing an early copy of "The Bootleg Series Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos". Allegedly this Dylan performance â€“ recorded May 10, 1963 at Brandeis University Folk Festival in Waltham, Mass. â€“ was recently discovered and has never been circulated before, not even as a bootleg. An executive at Columbia Records has been quoted as saying this concert will be given a full retail release in January 2011, but I'm not sure if that is indeed the case. Either way, you can enjoy it now. If you like this era of Dylan, you'll love this show! The performance and sound quality are both 10/10 IMO.

Seed and enjoy!

Cheers,
