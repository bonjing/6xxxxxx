,dandee67,2010-12-04T10:30Z,"Real!!! Cam- bad flicker but watchable.
 THANX JEKYLL!"
,The_Reasoner,2010-12-04T20:29Z,"This is the real movie. A7 V3. Bad flickering. and aspect ratio is 4:3, so the sides of the picture are cut off. Still somewhat watchable, but I think I'll wait for a better copy. Thanks anyway, uploader."
,some-young-guy,2010-12-04T20:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/user/SAFCukO09/ Don't be a tard.  Start with the fact that the uploader has a pink skull (trusted uploader) then click on the screen name of the uploader to check the history of torrents uploaded to the Bay and you will be better suited to make your own judgment call as to whether the torrent is real or fake.

I'd say 99/100 that this one is real, though quality is always a mystery."
,some-young-guy,2010-12-05T01:39Z,"A=5, V=4-4.5.

The video flickers and is cropped down to about 60% of the screen.

The audio has a lot of ambient noise.  Still appreciate the upload, however I will wait for a better cut."
,Scorpwanna,2010-12-05T07:29Z,"It's a nice copy, it's not crop to be 4:3 aspect ratio, it was just recorded as is. Seems the person that captured this just zoomed in to fill the screen. That's ok sometimes, but I'd like to recommend for future reference not to be afraid to record the entire theater, you can always crop later. Still appreciate this though, thanks."
