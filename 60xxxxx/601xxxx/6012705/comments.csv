There's nothing wrong with the KEY,
you should simply follow the install notes!
IMPORTANT: Don't check for updates within the program!"

Please follow the install notes, and you'll see that even you can register this app."
,Leopardi,2010-12-06T20:18Z,"does not work, even though after installation i did the registry key thing and unchecked updates (and automatic startup too): 

""This version is not licensed. Please install a valid license key.

,devlspawn,2010-12-08T04:05Z,"He is correct, the registration no longer works.  The problem is you can't disable ""check for updates"" before it is registered because the trial version will not save settings.  But if you put the registration code in registry it will say invalid and only give the option to order or exit."
,vinnygambiny,2010-12-12T03:06Z,"Don't work ... I have the error message at lunch :

,psikofunkster,2010-12-12T03:51Z,Reg not longer works.
,doctor2cardio,2010-12-12T18:49Z,What I always do is to disconnect from internet during installation ...apply the key and then disable the automatic updates... i have also NIS to block anydvd from inernet access..... Just try it the rest of oyu...or unistall and try again...
,psikofunkster,2010-12-12T22:29Z,doctor2cardio you must be right im gonna give a try blocking all the connection using my firewall.
,someone13,2010-12-17T23:26Z,"Ok for those whom its not working

uninstall the version, when it says keep the registration option click ""No"" After that delete the slysoft folder

using tuneup utilities (i used this step, don't know whether it is necessary) clean registry, restart the computer.

now disable the internet connection or disable the network adapter

now install the app from the included setup file, use the default location, after installation it will say need to restart click ""No"" go to c:\program files\slysoft\ now copy the ""Key Miguel ...."" and double click and press ""OK"" now restart (keep the net disabled)

after restart the AnyDVD setting option should automatically popup saying to use it as much as you can, go to ""Program Settings"" and uncheck ""Automatically check ...."" and ""Show Notification ..."" save the same.

You can enable the net connection again.

Also their is another version roaming around which is around 10MB, if you get hold of that use this step as well

in the rar file you have just downloaded their will a folder titled ""fixes"" open the same and their would be another folder ""PCPuttes_leftover_killer"" open the same and apply the fix"
,Winnah,2011-01-06T06:42Z,"It works great, thanks bigwimpie!!! ;)

I'm not sure why some others are having problems, but maybe they ran it first before appying the crack, or they have, or had a previous trial version installed in which they have to clean the registry first before running this one??? 

@psikofunkster
Because you didn't uncheck the update option before connecting to the internet again.

Everyone MUST do this before connecting to the internet again - once you get to the step in which you can run the program, go down the list until you see Program Settings which was 4th from the bottom when I first ran it, click it, then go down to the 5th box and uncheck/clear ""Automatically check for new AnyDVD version."" You can now connect to the internet again and it WILL work everytime :)"
,serpentpan,2011-03-05T15:41Z,great thanks to you and bay
,serpentpan,2011-07-24T17:01Z,Many people try to crack AnyDVD.Most cracks are problematic.This from TcT-TrT was from most stable effective and succesfull.Many thanks again.
