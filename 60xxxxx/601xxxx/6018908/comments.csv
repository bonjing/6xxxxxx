,DaemonicUV,2010-12-07T17:23Z,"Is it just me or does this not work at all at the moment? 

It gives me 94 LUA errors. Some directly reference the ZygorGuidesViewer and others reference the UI, but upon disabling the viewer I only get 1 lua error. I tried disabling everything except the Zygor guides viewer, but nothing changed. "
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T17:52Z,"@DaemonicUV, I am using it at this very moment and haven't run into any problems.  Delete both Zygor folders from your addon folder and also go into the WTF\Account\YourAccount\SavedVariables and delete the Zygor*.lua files there as well.  Then try to reinstall.

Any LUA errors at all are bad so the 1 that you get with Zygor disabled needs to be fixed as well.  One of the most common errors is an addon running a protected function will then disable that function until you ""/script ReloadUI()"" or logoff and back on.  For example, Auctioneer has been breaking a lot on me lately and it causes me to be unable to remove buffs, such as ice block for a mage.  I don't want to be locked up for 10 secs."
,Xyrec,2010-12-07T17:57Z,Please upload 3.0.1553! :)
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T18:32Z,"@xyrec, thankfully I am on vacation.  I did one better, I just updated 3.0.1554 at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6019316"
,DaemonicUV,2010-12-07T18:36Z,"Deleting the saved variables fixed it! I had reinstalled a few times already but it had no effect.

The LUA error that is kicking up is below. I've been playing and haven't noticed anything strange so far.

,Siobhe,2010-12-08T21:50Z,"Great torrent. Had a problem of guide text not showing up, but it was fixed by deleting the Zygor files in  WTF\Account\YourAccount\SavedVariables and restarting WoW.

Thanks for the great torrents!"
