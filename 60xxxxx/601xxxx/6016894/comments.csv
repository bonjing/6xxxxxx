,ebthnew,2010-12-06T19:27Z,thank you so much! I've been trying to find this everywhere....
,philtaylor007,2010-12-06T19:28Z,no worries im new at this so i hope i'm doing it right!
,goneja,2010-12-07T07:01Z,"Thank you for this, but the size is perhaps a bit unnecessary - a bluray is in existence and an 8gb version of that would be much more appreciated - any chance anyone has this or can do something about it?"
,goneja,2010-12-08T18:14Z,PLEASE SEED.
,ebthnew,2010-12-10T00:35Z,@goneja not everyone has a bluray disc player--to date this is the only person who has posted this on any site I can find so its not like you could have downloaded it faster elsewhere... I'm just grateful to have the chance to download it at all 
,tc4u2,2010-12-10T14:50Z,it dont work...anyone had luck?
,cornishlad,2010-12-10T15:19Z,"perfect.. top quality

10th anniv show.
large file, but well worth it!!!!!
many thanks..."
,bishop1j,2010-12-10T18:29Z,I too am unable to get this to play.  VLC nor handbrake are recognizing it.  Would love to know how someone got it to work.
,bishop1j,2010-12-12T19:56Z,"Downloaded this a 2nd time, and was able to use Handbrake on it no problem.  Must have been an issue with the initial download.  Works great.  Excellent quality.  Thank you for the file. "
,MYB.atoz,2010-12-15T05:46Z,"I've downloaded twice, attempted to ""mount"" the iso to a virtual drive, tried to burn it to a DL DVD, and tried to do an audio rip from the iso file -- nothing is working.  Any advice?

I'm really just looking for a decent quality audio rip (192 or higher).  Would you be able to upload that?  Even without track names, etc., I'd be grateful."
,philtaylor007,2010-12-15T15:25Z,"i am converting this file into an avi which i will upload later today, shoud be about 2.5 gig which i hope will help those who have had no joy with this! 
i am new at this so bare with me!!! "
,mowlens,2010-12-15T20:35Z,"Dowloaded and put on a DL  Disc!
Picture freezing and is unwatchably pixalated!
Is this what others are getting?
Cannot see how Handbrake can fix this!!
Help Please!"

,ps3zombie,2011-04-03T03:13Z,appears to be PAL.  VLC should work with no problems.
,k.karel,2011-10-14T23:57Z,"Perfect technical quality,unfortunately worse voice that 1995 company (10th anniversary) Colm Wilkinson is only one , but  also other in 95 was better. "
