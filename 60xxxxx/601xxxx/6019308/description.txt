Hello.

First of all. This torrent is for high-end machines and I mean it. Well, you can play it with low-end computer, but I don`t suggest to do so. I also want to thank people, who had made suht a great mods, utilies to this game and keeping this great game alive. I don`t take any credits by myself. The only thing I do is that I put few things together. Hope you enjoy the game.

How to install:
   -unrar grandprix4.rar and play the game

or(better choice)

Install grandprix4(full)
   -When you install the game first, you can use all kind of tweakers and utilities.
   -Original GP4 is in the grandprix4(original) folder.

Install 9.6 patch

Copy decrypted gp4.exe to the install folder

Run game once, calibrate settings if you want to. Then exit game(You have to be administration user and run it xp servicepack3 mode)

Install gpxpatch(You have to start the game allways by useing gpxpatch.exe)

After that, unrar grandprix4.rar to game folder and overwrite everything

There are many utilities in the game folder and I suggest that you use then.You have to reinstall some of them.

If you use the grandprix.rar version of the game. It is already tweaked to season 2010, so just unrar and play. if you want to chance graphics setting, you have to do it by using f1graphics.cfg. Remember that the game is set to 1920*1080 resolution, so if you have lower resolution monitor the car cockpit view looks strange and you may ever harm your system. So be careful, if your monitor can`t do 1920*1080 resolution. I hope you enjoy the game. Dont`t get frustrated. You have to be ace to win the races.
