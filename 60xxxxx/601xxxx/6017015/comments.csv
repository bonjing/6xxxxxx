,puppeteer666,2010-12-07T18:56Z,Never use a torrent site to mod your Consoles always go to a reputable site for this info and files needed for software modifications.
,Wiiman1982,2010-12-11T14:28Z,All the info in this guide has come from a reputable site puppeteer666 i have just made it more accessible for people who dont know where to look i have followed this guide myself many times. There is always a risk when modding your wii with any guide if all the steps are not followed correctly you will brick.

,fakebest,2010-12-27T23:09Z,"Run sd:\md5summer.exe
Click ""Verify Sums"", Select ""ModPack-AnyWii.md5""
All check sums should verify without error (very important)
Click ""Verify Sums"" again, Select ""UpdatePack.md5""

there is no update pack or a md5 file to verify it's checksums? will the lack of this update pack affect anything thing?"
,Wiiman1982,2011-01-02T10:06Z,"Sorry fakebest that is only needed if you are on a older system menu 3.1,3.2 etc "

erm, YES you can, and you can break anything that you have to physically open up and look inside, not to mention you void the warantee.... havnt thought that through have you dude lol. And all those bitches saying use reputable sites, TPB is a reputable site and i used this to do my wii worked a charm, i can only guess they probably own wii sites and want ppl to use THERE help instead of others, sad really."
