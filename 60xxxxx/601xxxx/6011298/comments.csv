Even merged together there's a second missing.  And the video shouldn't have bars from top to bottom given the fact that it's resolution adds bars to.  

It makes a good quality video like this one look like a ghetto widescreen wanna-be.  V=8 A=9

A decent download but given the fact that this film is over 6 years old & this torrent's upload date, you'd expect better."
