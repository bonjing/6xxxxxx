Release Notes:

The Australian version differs from the US version.  The US
Special Edition features two tracks on CD2 which are not on the
Australian edition ("3 Nil" and "The Blister Exists"). Also the
track "New Abortion" is not found on the US release.  The duplicate
tracks were included as the three month time period has passed.
So here is the US bonus cd & enjoy.
