,svetlania09,2010-12-06T18:50Z,"I am sure there will be constant updates over the next few days, I'll keep you posted.  Changes are their will be no new addition to the guides but only changes to the viewer which can be downloaded for free at http://www.zygorguides.com/download.php.  Just replace the files in the Guides folder under the viewer with those in this download and same for the Builds folder under talents."
,sipher2k,2010-12-06T21:51Z,I load the guide up and it only lets me view up to the end up 80 and then says it can't load level 81 guide??? 
,sipher2k,2010-12-06T22:06Z,"I load the guide up and it works fine, but I go to the end of level 80 and then it says that it can't find level 81 guide and flips to the top of 80 again... not complaining or anything was just wondering to make sure it was me or not. thanks for the post though it works good other then that."

,svetlania09,2010-12-06T23:59Z,"I have seen the gold guide coming soon for many months.  I do not know when it will finally arrive.  As for the leveling guides, I am not a subscriber but I have a friend that is.  As long as he keeps providing me with updates I will pass them along to you."

,pokachickin,2010-12-07T01:08Z,"does this have the launch bonuses? like the archeology guide and guild leveling guide? if not, is someone gunna upload them?"
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T02:56Z,"@beepbeepimajeep, I am on a US server and haven't noticed any problems.  I wonder if the problem you are having is in the localization files of the addon.  Just be patient as Zygor is trying to work through all the problems as soon as possible."
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T02:58Z,"@pokachickin, the bonus guides are a joke.  The guild leveling guide is just a list of what things a guild can earn and the archaeology guide is a brief overview.  You can get much more detailed info at www.wowpedia.com (formerly know as wowwiki.com)"

How To Fix Version 3.0 Issues

    If you are experiencing any of the following problems with Version 3.0:

    * LUA Errors
    * Frames Per Second (FPS) slowdown
    * Missing guides (such as 80-85)

    First close the game and try to run a repair with the Client. If the problems persist, here's how you can resolve these issues.

    01) Close the game and go to your World of Warcraft directory.

    02) Go to your Interface / Addons

    03) Delete every folder with Zygor in the name which includes:
    ZygorGuidesViewer
    ZygorTalentAdvisor

    04) Run a fresh install with the Zygor Client

    05) If the guides still do not work, delete your go into your WTF folder and under Account / [ACCOUNTNAME] / SavedVaribles and delete everything with Zygor in the name. You can also delete the whole WTF folder but this will delete saved information for other addons such as Auctioneer.
