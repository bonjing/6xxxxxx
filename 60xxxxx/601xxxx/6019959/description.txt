FREDDIE KING BOSSA NOVA AND THE BLUES
Released:1963
Label:Federal
Format:Flac

Blues guitarist Freddie King came up through the ranks of Chicago blues players during the 1950s, but it was during the '60s that King's inspired blend of electric blues, roots rock, and R&B would allow him to outgrow the West Side scene. King's classic instrumental "Hide Away" would be a de facto standard for fledgling blues players for decades. An innovative instrumentalist and underrated singer, King would move beyond blues and soul to make commercial inroads into funk and even soul music. Along the way, he would influence string-benders like Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and George Thorogood, among others.
