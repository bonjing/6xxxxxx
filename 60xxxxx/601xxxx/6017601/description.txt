Reup the Elector Electronics issues September and October 2010.  Elektor Electronics Magazine. A popular magazine on electronic components,  circuitry, insertions of controllers, and drawings of printed circuit boards.  I'll reup the Nobember 2010 issue later. Why TPB missed such a wonderful magazine? :(
