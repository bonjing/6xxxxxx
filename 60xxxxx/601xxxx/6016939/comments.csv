Leave a comment and I'll get tot it have over 15,000 vinyl."
,shredthe,2010-12-07T20:45Z,"Hey thanks for sharing some Ty. The source here is listed as mp3. Have you just converted mp3 to flac? If this is true, you should be posting it as mp3 and not as a lossless file! "
,solanaceae,2011-03-19T20:13Z,"Hey do you have any Milkshakes, Billy Childish, Searchers, Oh Shees, or other good vinyls that have similar sounds?"
,staxlightninvolt,2011-03-22T03:56Z,"Hey guys sorry believe it or not I actually run a record store! I'm gonna have some more shit up soon. Just got some seven inches in. 

cheers"
,Dereck89,2011-04-11T18:17Z,"I would love it if you could upload ""Bertayed by the Octagon"" by Oneohtrix Point Never, or something by Ian Boddy (maybe the album ""react""?) :) take care!"
,shazwagon,2011-07-04T10:36Z,"Honestly, I don't see how mp3 can be turned into FLAC. I know theoretically Winamp (or some other software) can do this conversion but the quality stays the same. I could be wrong, though.

Thanks for this, anyway! Looking forward to your other uploads!"
,thedeathbee,2011-08-30T14:50Z,"Dude, any chance we could get more Ty? Other records? Goodbye Bread for instance?Just getting into it!"
