It plays - you probably don't have the proper video/audio decoders installed - or you do but your video player isn't using them because some other software package took over decoding priority without asking you.  Usually a software package like iTunes (one that connects to a cell phone, portable media player, playstation portable, iPod, etc.) does this.  If you know what you're doing, you can try to uninstall your usual decoders and install them again.  This may fix the problem.  Or if all else fails, try uninstalling any of the above software and see if this fixes the problem."
