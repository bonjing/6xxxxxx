,Takuma4,2011-01-14T21:56Z,You are one brainwashed teaparty slave if u beleive what this documentary says. The constitution of usa is outdated a long time ago. Do you still think an african american is 3/4 human?
,title1teacher,2011-01-21T22:51Z,"takuma4 -- either you have no idea what the constitution says or represents in the evolution of the role of government, or you are a mindless idiot. if you are just ignorant; read something not in the ny times. if you are an idiot, there are trains and planes leaving every hour out of America. catch one. your use of the term ""tea party slave"" leads me to believe you are ignorant and stupid. in that case --  get under the bus. we are going to take our freedoms back (and it has nothing to do with slavery or color and even a dunce like you knows that). we will not back down and we are the majority -- clinging to our guns and religion. when it hits the fan, you will wish you had both. too bad all you will have is a tired ideology and a broke country. yes, we will leave you the debt you created. you can keep obama and dc. we will take America. and, yes i do teach in a poor, ghetto school. i wonder what you do. probably live in your mom's basement, smoke weed, and pretend to look for a job. poor deluded a**hole."
