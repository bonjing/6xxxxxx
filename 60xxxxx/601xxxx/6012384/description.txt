Max's guest for this edition of On the Edge is Greg Hunter of USAWatchDog.com. Greg is a former investigative correspondent for CNN and ABC news.
In 2008, in a special Greg made for CNN, he foresaw what is now being called 'Foreclosure Gate'. The mortgage foreclosure crisis is back in the news this week as Bank of America mortgage morass deepens after employee says trustee did not get the notes.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
