I have done a few dealings in the city
met a number of stockbrokers 
and I can tell you in all my life that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never seen
such dishonesty and greed
itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like a big betting shop a bookies a casino
where theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all screwing each other and the rest of the world
 
The devil is here in the city
and the city wakes up with the devil

I bet you there are millions of people right that think
that the blokes who work here in the city are really good blokes
hard working who have got the economy of this nation deep in their hearts
what a load of cobblers itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best confidence trick in history
 
The con men come and try to have us over
selling us shares that we already own
accountants came and juggled with the numbers
thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how they became two thieves and a liar
thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how they became two thieves and a liar"
