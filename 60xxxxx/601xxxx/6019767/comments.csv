,calamaric,2010-12-18T21:22Z,"Thanks a lot for putting this up man!, I owned the dvds but they were stolen from me, and Ive never seen them again at a reasonable price... Youre the best!"
,fafm01,2010-12-20T04:53Z,"thanks for all these
is season 4 on the way as well?"
,vze1mk7d,2010-12-20T09:11Z,I'll try and get season 4 up as soon as I have enough seeders for disc 2 of season 3 which will hopefully be pretty soon.
,Polymathj,2012-06-11T00:47Z,Thanks for the raw rip but why not upload a proper video file?  I may compile them into something more versatile this week and UL for a while.
,MusicIsCoolio,2012-06-23T07:51Z,"To Polymathj, vob is the best video file type.Converting it would just lower the quality.Also,seeing as you have 0 uploads,we're not holding out breath for you to do anything but leech and complain."
