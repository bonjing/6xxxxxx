,golfer29,2010-12-16T01:40Z,"AVG reports
1BOX_NTR2011.exe shows Trojan Horse Generic2_c.BZWH
NTR2011-v313.exe shows Trojan Horse Generic_c.VOV"
,uranoob09,2010-12-22T05:57Z,"Um.. really?? lol your seriously going to say this has a virus because it brings up the NTR files as false positives?
=)"
,blabladavidrockrox,2010-12-27T00:15Z,"Seems to install fine. Gives a 120 day subscription with the reset cracker.

I don't know if the 120 days is reset after every reboot or if you need to rerun the reset cracker when you want it bumped up to 120 days again.
:thumbsup!"
,ECOxDC,2011-01-03T05:35Z,"@froggie100
So I have to uninstall my current antivirus and then install this one? It will give me somewhere from 120-180 days and then using the crack you can reset it back to 120 or something? I couldn't understand your instructions to well."
,DP3_001,2011-01-07T09:19Z,"FYI: As of this writing, recent updates to NIS and NAV have rendered Trial Reset 3.1.3 useless. With me, my copy of NIS stopped working correctly because of this. Hope there's an update to NTR 3.1.3 soon."
,sharee_5,2011-01-11T08:10Z,works fine
,HexBuster,2011-01-12T00:06Z,"Works great on Win 7 Home Premium 64 but!!! One problem with NIS... I cannot access the ""settings"" tab after installing the trial reset! Tried uninstalling with Norton removal tool and reinstalling, and get the same results. I tried it on my XP pro box and got the same results. Anyone having this issue?

Cheers froggie100!!!"
,HexBuster,2011-01-12T00:09Z,"Forgot to mention when trying to access the ""settings"" I get Error 3005,100."

,alectra,2011-03-02T15:33Z,work fine got 165 days after reboot
,ipkonfig,2011-03-20T12:09Z,"The trial reset patch may work the first time. However, after updating the product, you may find that the ""settings"" option has been disabled. In effect, updating the product basically nullifies the NTR trial reset patch.

The product is good. Purchase it - because it is well worth every penny you spent."
,drharryt,2011-03-22T05:57Z,"I have found that I don't need antivirus software WHAT!!!!!!!! with win7 and vista I just install the base software and drivers (I like this, runs perfect, just the way I want it) create a system image to a seperate drive (preferably internal) of course save data as well (never have anything on c drive that you can't live without) so if anything happens just put in install or repair disk and reimage. for me with 4 ssd drives raid configured duel boot sys (XP/win7 X64) it takes 12 min and I am back up and running. stoped using av software 4 years ago and no problems.. only came here for a friend running xp 32bit  and can't image unless a third party imaging software is used such as norton ghost ect....."
,moha80,2011-05-09T20:01Z,"Aren't there any new NTR for this? when you update this baby it gets this annoying 18.5 v instead of the cool 18.1 v so it kind like damages the settings button, they said that they pulled it but they did not I downloaded the intelligent updater they said it will fix but it didn't..Do i have to uninstall the thing then do it again? what the hell, after updating it will do the same thing again and again :( sad"
