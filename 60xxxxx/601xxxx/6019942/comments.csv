Please Comment and/or click the +1 on Quality rating above if you enjoy the Torrent. I will interpret a lack of comments or lack of votes as a lack of interest and will stop converting & seeding these audiobooks.

I am currently converting the other 20 books and will start seeding as soon as they are complete. 

Conversion is tedious & time consuming. Please show some appreciation by helping my reputation... And Please SEED when you are done downloading!

Thanks, God Bless & Enjoy the stories.

If there are any problems, please let me know and I will re-convert, repost & reseed if needed. I am a huge fan of this series and I only want to put out quality seeds of this fine masterwork of naval literature!

These files were converted at 96Kbps with a sample rate of 44,800 Hz."
