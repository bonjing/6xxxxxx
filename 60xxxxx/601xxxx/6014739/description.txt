From Wikipedia: 

The music of Animusic is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches mostly played \"dry\"; i.e., with few effects. There are no lyrics or voices, save for the occasional chorus synthesizer. According to the director\'s comments on DVD 2 (see below), most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation. Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their timbre.
