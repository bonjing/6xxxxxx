This is debut Olly Murs' self-titled album. The release follows the outstanding success of his debut single "Please Donâ€™t Let Me Go" which reached number one in September 2010, and was a bonafide sales and airplay smash. Ollyâ€™s "Thinking Of Me" was co-written by Olly, with Steve Robson and Wayne Hector. Olly co-wrote most of the album with a host of collaborators, from Chris Difford (Squeeze) to Eg White and Trevor Horn.
