ActionScript 3.0 for Adobe Flash Professional CS5 Classroom in a Book

The tutorials start with simple navigation and timeline control and progress through controlling animation with ActionScript; using Event Listeners and writing event-handling functions; and controlling loading of and interaction with data, text, video, sound, and images. Readers will also learn to use third-party libraries and create Adobe Air applications. This Classroom in a Book also covers the improved text-handling tools that are new to Flash Professional CS5.
