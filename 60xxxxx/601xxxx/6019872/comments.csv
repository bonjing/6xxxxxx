,autocross86,2011-05-07T02:09Z,OMG thx for this JohnnyRimShot.  Better quality than the VHS I recorded off HBO in 93ish.  Awesome.
,Lomedin,2011-07-16T02:37Z,Robot Wars (Robot Jox 2) is on demonoid ;)
,ProphetZarquon,2011-10-21T07:35Z,"Pretty sure this is it:  Robot Wars, Robot Jox 2.  Freaking awful though.  Barely even shows the robots.  (Might as well be watching the final episodes of Evangelion at that point.  No, wait...  The voices are still less annoying than Evangelion.)
