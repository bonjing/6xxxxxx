As snow covered Toy Town excitedly prepares for Christmas, Noddy's mission is to finally meet Santa Claus to ask him the three big questions: how does Santa get around the world in one night? how do all the presents fit into his sack? and how does Santa fit down the chimney?

On a visit to Big Ears house , Noddy's wish actually comes true! But Santa is in big trouble! His magic clock that stops time all over the world is broken, which means he might not be able to deliver
his presents.

With his new friends Santa and Dasher the reindeer, Noddy goes on a whirlwind adventure to SAVE CHRISTMAS.

Hurray for Noddy!
