,drewkrew,2011-09-30T15:00Z,"Good advice from bebop, 
just wanted to then add that if you want to then play backup games from DVD-R discs (burnt at 2x or 4x, slower the better) then get DarkCorp v1.1 and install (run it from the homebrew channel) the complete install for virgin wii's option is what you want to select. 
It will update all of your IOS files to allow the use of backup games in the normal disc channel. 
NOTE: will not work with black wii's or new-new white wii's due to the fact Nintendo changed the internal DVD drive inside the wii and prevented them from reading DVD-R's. As they do lol!
Easiest way to get started with backups, without buying a USB HDD and transferring iso files to wbfs files, and installing a USB loader to work them: which can become a very impressive setup but gets a little more advanced and involves a bit more work, so do your homework with google ;-)

DVD-R's and DarkCorp are a quick and easy way to get going for newbies. Respect to DarkCorp's team (originally cIOScorp v3.6 and progressed)"
