Hhiiimmmm you have no ideal what your talking about, stop being jerri.

big enough for quality, small enough to store."

always looking for 3Li Torrents..."
,zdude555,2010-12-06T15:58Z,"@Hhiiimmmm
Please stop being a jerk. If you need huge sized torrents, there are other rips. Shoo....go away.
A 4GB torrent can be burned on a DVD. Thats the reason! But of course you cant deduce that.

Thanks 3Li!!"
,zdude555,2010-12-06T16:02Z,"Are there subtitles for the N'vi parts in the Papyrus font embedded?

Also why are they releasing all the blu-ray's in 16:9 when the 2D version of movie was much wider?"
,est1987,2010-12-06T16:47Z,I missed you and your uploads! Great to have you back!
,apple016,2010-12-06T17:30Z,"oh i m following you on ahashare since you left TPB. but dude yeah its good to see here again. 

@Hhiiimmmm
u dumb ass
go fuck ur self 1st download it and then comment here ok you noob wide ass."
,Shoobox,2010-12-06T22:05Z,"@Hhiiimmmm
im going to to say you have no ideal whats your talking about, rubbish just complete rubbish, go buy the cd then if you want 45gb BRray movies,
4gb is a great size when converted right with the right codecs on a good converter, 
 Which 3LI has shown over and over, his rips are of the highest conversion for low gb files.

nobody wants a 12gb movie file, you my friend are obsurd in thinking anything more.
 so stop being a Jerri and go complain on something else."
,Shoobox,2010-12-06T22:20Z,"@Hhiiimmmm
Its also clearly shows 3li video percent after convertion, so if your truelly worried about loosing 14% of the video file

*Stream Video Size.........: 3.42 GB (86%)


some of us have a nice upconversion Denon DVD to play on without ripping onto a dvd so i wouldn't see the loss regardless, 
so cheers mate,
You've earned The prestigious Golden Turd, for your smartness.

,xspiTFirex,2010-12-10T03:38Z,"Welcome back 3Li...

I've been looking for your rips...Your d best :D

Continue sharing your rips....big thanks 2u"
,Shoobox,2010-12-11T15:10Z,"@babybluetits24 
dont taint 3li boards, 
if you knew how to use torrents you wouldn've known you can look at the files before you download them, for hard or soft subs.
go spread your gospel of porn somewhere else, leave the movies to us.
douchebag."
,Shoobox,2010-12-12T22:21Z,"@Hhiiimmmm
ur about as smart as a limp dog, licking his balls,
get lost,you have no ideal what your talking about.

until you start converting movies and uploaded them i dont wanna hear or read anymore of your retarded comments"
,Shoobox,2010-12-13T18:35Z,"lol right on,
go get em jerri,
lmao
you have no knowledge of the movie torrents, a suggest you stay with the kiddie books or paint by numbers, 
now shoo, if you don't like the torrent find something else"
,soldierofthelam,2010-12-13T18:48Z,"@Hhiiimmmm
you are the most moronic person i've ever read on here,
Clearly the only person looking stupid is you,
Shoo is rite if you can't contribute or upload some of your amazing quality movie rips you shouldn't be on here.

there is nothing wrong with the 3LI Rips,
the problem is you,
im running a 28mbps down and 16mbps up and even on my fast connection 12gb files are too big,
3li offers a great file system with cdec conversion for the file size.
so instead of you continuously making yourself look stupid, maybe you should put some thought into you posts.
Have a nice day moron"
,soldierofthelam,2010-12-13T18:49Z,"@3LI
Thank you for all your hard work and time,

,Shoobox,2011-01-16T00:17Z,"@babybluetits24
the Navi parts have hard coded english subs you don't need a srt file"
,godofwrath08,2011-01-28T01:22Z,"guys simple and easy its a good movie and good torrent but eny1 with a 1080p HD tv will see pixels alot and just so you know 2748 kbps video rate is no ware near 720p in any format, seen as HD is 16,000kbps and thats h264 mp4 files, this is a dvd rip only so why is every1 arguing?."

,gypsz.one,2012-02-14T00:37Z,this didnt work for me. jumpy and laggy ... and it only starts half way through it. it ruined this gay movie for me.
