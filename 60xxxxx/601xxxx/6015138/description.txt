"The People vs. Martin Sugar"

If there's one thing that Stan Smith loves, 
it's a good jury trial. He anxiously awaits 
his annual jury summons. But when Roger is 
the defendant in the trial where Stan is the 
foreman, he is finally in a position to make 
Roger accountable for his misdeeds. 
Meanwhile, Jeff and Hayley move in with the 
Smiths, and Francine tries to get Jeff to 
clean up his act

Enjoy :)
