-Bert Jansch returns to the US in December for East Coast dates with Pegi Young and Meg Baird

Bert is delighted to announce that he will return to the US in December for six East Coast shows with the wonderful Pegi Young Band as special guest, and one in Philadelphia with the very lovely Meg Baird of Espers opening.

This follows Bert's recent surgery, which forced him to pull out of the Gulf Coast leg of the Neil Young US tour in September as well as cancel a series of his own shows on the East Coast where Pegi Young (Neil's wife) was due to open. Bert was deeply disappointed to miss the September and October shows, as he enjoyed every moment of touring with Neil over the summer, as well as the West Coast shows he played with the Pegi Young Band opening. He was also particularly disappointed to miss an appearance at Farm Aid, which he was very much looking forward to. However, he is delighted to report that the surgery was successful, and the new confirmed dates are:

WED DEC 8 - PHILADELPHIA, PA - Johnny Brenda's (with Meg Baird)

THU DEC 9 - BOSTON, MA - Johnny D's (with the Pegi Young Band)

SAT DEC 11 - HARTFORD, CT - Wadsworth Atheneum (with the Pegi Young Band)

MON DEC 13 - VIENNA, VA - Jammin Java (with the Pegi Young Band)

WED DEC 15 - BROOKLYN, NY - Bell House (with the Pegi Young Band)

FRI DEC 17 - PITTSBURGH, PA - First Unitarian Church (with the Pegi Young Band)

SAT DEC 18 - BUFFALO, NY - Town Ballroom (with the Pegi Young Band)
