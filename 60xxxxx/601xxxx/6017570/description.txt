"O Holy Night" ("Cantique de NoÃ«l") is a well-known Christmas carol composed by Adolphe Adam in 1847 to the French poem "Minuit, chrÃ©tiens" (Midnight, Christians) by Placide Cappeau (1808â€“1877), a wine merchant and poet, who had been asked by a parish priest to write a Christmas poem. Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855. In both the French original and in the two familiar English versions of the carol, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and of mankind's redemption.

John Edward Berry (born September 14, 1959) is an American country music artist. Active as a recording artist since 1979, he has recorded more than fifteen studio albums, including one platinum album and two gold albums. In his career, Berry has also charted nineteen songs on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts, including the Number One single "Your Love Amazes Me" from 1994 and six additional Top Ten hits: "What's In It for Me," "You and Only You," "Standing on the Edge of Goodbye," "I Think About It All the Time," "Change My Mind," and "She's Taken a Shine."

A Country Weekly article said of Berry "John's greatest strength is his pure, soulful tenor" a 2006 interview with The Entertainment Nexus described him as "one of the most remarkable voices in music." 

Berry is shortly embarking on his 2010, 12th Annual Christmas Tour. The hour and a half show is filled with traditional Christmas songs (including an acappella version of "O Holy Night") and his childhood stories.

John Edward Berry was born on September 14, 1959 in Aiken, South Carolina, to James and Marie Berry, and raised in the Atlanta, Georgia area. He was exposed to a variety of music, as his father preferred Van Cliburn, his mother had a strong taste for gospel. Berry grew up listening to an AM station from Atlanta; "It was on in dad's garage constantly, WQXI 79 AM," Berry says. "They played a pretty eclectic selection, country and Top 40 in the 1970s."

Berry began learning the guitar in 1972 (at the age of 12), he has named influences such as James Taylor, Harry Chapin, and, his favourite, John Denver. In a 2006 interview he said: "prior to playing guitar, I really loved the â€œPhilly Soul Soundâ€ like The Shilites and The Stylists." Berry moved to soul, gospel and country music and began recording his own albums at home in 1979.

In 1981, at age 19, while riding his motorcycle, Berry was hit by a car, breaking both of his legs and his left hip. He had just lost his mother earlier that year. Doctors were afraid that he may not walk again. He spent several months in physical therapy, working to regain the use of his legs. Berry said of the incident "The coolest thing in the world that came out of it...all I could do is sit on my stool and play guitar. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve done ever since."
