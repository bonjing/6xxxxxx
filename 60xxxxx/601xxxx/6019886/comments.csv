its a new torrent via super-seed with a root-server in the swarm.

it takes a while."

,mike130784,2010-12-08T19:31Z,"you will still have to buy a key , and upgrade youre account,.
in other words ., 
you could just as well buy it in store,."
,arcsivald,2010-12-08T20:26Z,is it a full version?
,mEExCZ,2010-12-08T22:37Z,"But if you download this, you still need the CD KEY..."
,Kamorox,2010-12-08T23:13Z,"I'm just going to play on private servers, im at 45% downloaded after 23 hours aprox. I'll post if its the full version once its done."

,thechucksta88,2010-12-10T00:39Z,it works. but i cant get the new races.wat am i doing wrong?
,starli,2010-12-10T02:07Z,"you must enter a cataclysm cd key on battle.net
or your private server doesn't support new races ^^"
,Inferno955,2010-12-10T03:36Z,how do you get one?
,Inferno955,2010-12-10T03:37Z,"does it matter to have new races?
"
,thechucksta88,2010-12-10T07:27Z,yeah man how do i get an key? please. i've been waiting for 2  day to download this puppie.THANX
,starli,2010-12-10T10:56Z,"buy one from a gamestore, or online at blizzard."
,misorax,2010-12-10T14:19Z,"downloading now, thanks, and to everyone who has key issues, just go to youtube and look up ""wow cataclysm keygen"" there should be multiple videos that show keygens, you don't even need to download the keygens, just look for a video that has the keys visible. "
,starli,2010-12-10T15:27Z,world of warcraft keygens and gamecard keygens never work for offical servers since 2005.
,gsnackers,2010-12-10T16:25Z,"this is for all private server players:
private servers won't be able to update to cataclysm, because blizzard is changing the op-code now every patch. We only got 80% of the correct Op-code atm since wow classic to 3.3.5 (5 years)
so most likely it is pointless to download world of warcraft cataclysm u also need a CD key for ur account to upgrade to world of warcraft cataclysm.
So all retail players just buy this game and do not waste ur time on this!!"
,Todde@Swe,2010-12-11T10:44Z,"I have Eng-US version installed, then this will not work right?!"
,angus2,2010-12-11T15:03Z,"Hey! the installer is in german!

@and to the guys who are asking for keygens... honestly you have never played World of warcraft.
Do you even know what MMORPG is?"
,unknown3r2,2010-12-12T13:34Z,So it works on private servers or not? i didnt understand if works or not xD
,starli,2010-12-12T16:15Z,"@angus2: no, you can select the laguange
@unknown3r2: thats the normal gameinstall, you must search for a privat server that support cataclysm"
,newcon12,2010-12-12T16:33Z,"Guys I just installed this it works perfectly, it started off for me in German aswell, but as you install you can tick the language you want and once the launcher opens you can go into the game preferences, and you can change the language into english."
,Todde@Swe,2010-12-12T19:12Z,And where do you play? I've just ugraded my to 4.0.3 and can't find any private servers at all :)
,heroin99,2010-12-13T18:45Z,"Private servers will probably never be able to emulate this, as gsnackers said, blizz made sure of it. If you are still playing on private servers, then make sure you find one that can run Cataclysm first, after that spend ur time/bandwidth downloading this.

Retail players probably dont need to download it anyway."

,unknown3r2,2010-12-18T18:33Z,"I installed it, then i tried to open it and it didnt open, i run Launcher to update and it started a download of 9.6 GB. is this normal?"

,elementair,2010-12-22T20:41Z,"Help me, I installed it, It automaticly has DEUTSCH ticked off, I can't untick it... I do have the possibility to tick off english, I did that then it installed, next... I start WoW Cataclysm on private server and It was ALL GERMAN O.O 
Woot. I barely understood somthing.
Then I also get some error like : Blizzard_TimeManager failed or somthing.
And I can't do anything, and every npc is UNKNOWN... PLEASE help me man!
and I don't really understand german :'(
and How do I change it to english... because it creates a map deDE but it needs to create enGB, but he doesn't. HELP ME!
Thanks in advance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,starli,2010-12-26T03:22Z,"yes g erman is the base language.
you can change the language in the launcher.

the npc problem is a problem from your private server and not from the install."
,noelakos,2010-12-28T08:05Z,"Hello all ! Im from Greece and i use enGB version. With this version, can i install it and work properly? because its german version :-("

,a3nr,2011-02-27T08:17Z,"hey.. i downloaded this and it took like 12 hours to install the friggin game... and it automatically starts downloading the Blizzard patches... so i cant patch it on my own, what do i do?"
,horia1,2011-03-12T10:47Z,how I change Laguanges? IS German... i Need english please answer:)
,andrevus,2011-05-28T21:52Z,tess the problem with that torrent is that that is an EN-US disc iso and this is an EN-GB iso if you could point a better EN-GB torrent i would go for it but there is a big difference
,Dokixo,2011-07-06T22:33Z,"I'ts german, but so what, you could just change the language in the game launcher ;)"
,tarik98,2011-07-13T08:51Z,"does we need pay account for this...
