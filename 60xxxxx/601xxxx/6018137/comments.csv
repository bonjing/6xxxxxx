Enjoy the movie...
If possible comment about quality..."
,jarman007,2010-12-07T10:26Z,"thanks for the upload

how many movies are left before you start the list

whats the difference between 720p and 576p"
,akindayimcan,2010-12-07T11:03Z,"thanks for this upload...if i am right u tried variable bitrate first time....just checked screen shot but i could not see difference to other uploads...

And i just wonder what is your next upload after this torrent..."
[V],neon,2010-12-07T11:03Z,"@jarman007 ....144p

Skull looks great Goku :)"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-07T11:31Z,"@jarman
welcome..too many movies r left before i start the list...bt i will do some movies from the list in b/w also..

when aspect ratio is 1.78
then 720p means vertical resolution of 720 pixel..
576p means vertical resolution of 576 pixel..

in this case aspect ratio is 1.85
so a 720p will be 1280x688
a 576p will be 1024x560

@akind
welcome..and this is nt my first my every upload has variable bitrate..
and next may be avatar extra disk2(part a)..since disk 2 is big i will divide it in 2 parts and upload..

@neon
thanks buddy..:)"

@goku
u said next may be avatar extra disk2(part a)..since disk 2 is big i will divide it in 2 parts and upload..
r u doin avatar extended ver or u hav bluray(special-deleted scenes...n all) n uploadin that.which ver??"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-07T15:10Z,"@ashu
i m busy downloading avatar extended and its extras atm...t-2 source is also 8gb and avatar's also 8gb..and extra's r 9 and 12gb...so...

@mrcool,mzk
welcome..

@DSIN
i'll explain...see if aspect ratio is 1.78 then 720p is 1280x720...as the aspect ratio increases vertical resolution decreases..therefore for aspect 1.85 vertical resolution decreases to 688..for aspect 2.35 it decreases to 544...
bt the horizontal resolution remains same 1280...

similarly for 576p u can do the calculations..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-07T15:40Z,"@prank
avatar extended was released in bluray and it has 3 disks...
1st disk contains the movie...
2nd contains:
-deleted scenes
-capturing avatar
-a msg from pandora
-production materials

3rd contains
-scene deconstruction
-production shorts

i will be doing all 3 disks..already ripped ""deleted scene"" of disk 2 working on ""capturing avatar""...will post them as one torrent(part-a of disk 2)...rest 2 as part-b of disk 2..."
,prank0007,2010-12-07T16:28Z,"oh man thnks a million
