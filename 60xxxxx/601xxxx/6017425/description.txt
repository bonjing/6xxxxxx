Irish stand-up Jason Byrne presents this radio series which is described as 'perfect for anyone who loves a little bit of chaos with their comedy'.

The comic explores the broad areas of couples, law, education, sport, religion and medicine with a combination of stand-up and sketches.

From going on a first date to the birth of his children, from the politics of the playground to getting in trouble with the police, Byrne looks at all these areas and more.

In the first series, the Irish stand-up was joined each week by Tom Binns as spoof hospital DJ Ivan Brackenbury.

[quote]Accomplished broad mainstream stand-up from the likeable host. 
However, things are somewhat let down by a few below-par sketches that accompanied the material.[/quote]
