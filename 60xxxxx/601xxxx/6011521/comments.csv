GridGameLauncherc.exe works for me, although sometimes it'll give me a ""Securom Faild to Load"" error, but it'll load fine right after. 
But once you get the cracked game loaded there's a simple way around it asking for a key in-game (which it does for me); just exit the Activation Key window. My GFWL is setup to auto-login to my Offline account, and despite the game asking for a key every time I load it, it still logs in to my Offline account. After you're out of that part you can go make an Offline account or just login if you've already got one. Game saves fine, no other problems noticed."

As someone stated, click GridGamelauncherc wait until it loads up, click to play and windows live pops up. click create a new profile and scroll down and click the link at the very bottom ( its in bold like links usually are ) to create an OFFLINE profile. This prevents putting in a serial key, and allowing you to save  :DD. PS. I think saving happens when you visit a disk station! Hope this helps. :)"
,costakis18,2011-04-26T02:21Z,hi i think i foun a solution for the error [failed to initializ] first unrar the iso astre that maund it whith any iso program you want(i use alcohol 120)then open the virtual cd-dvd driver and copy the files in a folder on your pc then remove the crack folder somewhere  else and install secondly alfter you install the game copy from the crack folder only gridgameslauncherc+paul.dll+rld.dll then run the gridgameslauncherc as administrator and that is all(warning if it says failed to initializ run task manager and disable gridgameslauncherc>exe---securom and run it again) p.s. sorry for the non so good english i am not so used in english because i am from greece and me and my frin we dot use very much english !!!!!!
,DukeNukem513,2011-05-02T01:43Z,Don't know if this game is good or not because it won't accept the product key's I have from games I've actually purchased.Those product keys worked for other games.
,DukeNukem513,2011-05-02T01:54Z,Why make torrents for games that can't be activated? That makes no sense. Don't download this if you plan to play it online to get the achievements!
,brunoalvessilva,2011-05-06T21:51Z,"Guys! It's simple!
1 -You mount the image... (use Virtual Clone Drive)
2- Install the game!
3- Open the game folder and then open the paste caled ""crack"".
4 - Copy all the contents of the folder to Win32Live (Programmes, Disney Interactive Studios, Binaries, Win32Live)
5 - Then you open the App ""Gridgamelauncher"" and it should appear the guy in the light cicle... you wait and then the game starts!!!

( For those who have the serial problem... don't extract the game... mount it!  AND YOU MUST COPY THE ""CRACK"" CONTENTS TO WIN32LIVE... If you don't it will continue to ask for the serial...!!! )"
,Number43,2011-05-07T00:32Z,"Ive been playing this torrented game, I beat it and i was playing it again to try to get all the tron files and LVL up some more but now when i go to  play it keeps asking for the serial number, it did this before but i just hit ESC and it went away and i was able to play but now it doesent let me log on with my account. Its probably because i have to have an offline account like i see people have said, but my account worked for it for a while and now it wont. Is there a way to sign on to my account in offline mode or something like on steam? if so how?"

,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:11Z,"When it came out I had a problem with this game freezing right at the first cut scene, but windows or something must have had some updates, because I've just tried it and it works perfectly... no patches no anything just copy the crack folder where they tell you to.

Second... This game... (well it's a platform game mostly) ... plays much better with a game pad... if you have a PS2pad...(others supposedly as well)... here is what you need to do...
First...
download this~~~> http://www.filecrop.com/36095763/index.html (If that link doesn't work anymore search for ""x360ce vibmod 3.1.4.1"")
And extract it to where the game files are (where the  GridGameLauncherc.exe is)... btw you might want to keep those files on the side because they will work for most of the games."
,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:16Z,"WTF... can't post... ""database error""?"
,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:16Z,Now it works WTF?
,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:21Z,Now it worked?

,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:25Z,Sorry
,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:27Z,"Now if you click xinputTEST.exe you will notice that your right analog is sideways (you'll know what I mean) and the triger buttons are reversed. 
All those settings are in the .ini file you can adjust them as it says, but if you rather not to fuck around with this, here is an my corrected .ini file~~~>  just replace the original one.
I hope this helps.

All credit goes to the person that wrote ""XBOX 360 Controller emulator vibmod "" Mr or Ms VIRUS

I think we should sometimes just say a simple thank you to those guys, and we seem to forget that, like it's a given.

No it's not... they do put a lot of work into it... and by that I mean learning, cause once you know it it's probably simple."

,RafVne2,2011-09-15T20:36Z,"I'm sorry for multiple posts, but I had to figure out why it won't let me post.

Apparently my the site I tried to give a link to, where I have uploaded the corrected .ini file is not ""approved""  by this sitebot. so you guys will just have to figure out how to adjust the ini file yourselves... it's not rocket science."
,sayam12,2011-09-16T14:45Z,"it's asking for seriel key ?
what is it ?"
,RafVne2,2011-09-16T16:05Z,"serial key is in the .nfo file. open it with notepad and set the font to ""terminal"" that will enable you to view ASCII graphics."
,RafVne2,2011-09-16T16:17Z,"Wait actually I just checked... it's not in the .nfo file.... first of all... this game should not ask you for the key when installing.... don't use ""autorun"" ,just open mounted image and use the ""setup.exe"" file"
