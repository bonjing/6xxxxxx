I installed it already but can't use it require CD so how can I use it. 

Thanks"
,tfowler7,2010-12-05T16:30Z,"Hi sciou,

Sorry for the problem,
I just copied my CD to a file and uploaded it 
as a torrent. How to work around needing the
original CD is beyond me at this point.
If anyone knows, please add a comment.
Thanks.

,sciou,2010-12-07T10:32Z,"Dear tfowler7,

Many thanks for your share. It's great and now I found solution.

,loquorlicker,2010-12-11T09:11Z,well? what is it?
,tfowler7,2010-12-12T01:45Z,"I copied the files to a blank cd using the standard
CD Writing Wizard in Windows XP under Files - 
write these files to cd option . This worked on 
my system so hopefully it will on others as well,
If not, let me know and I'll find other methods.
Thanks,

what version of quickbooks this program is applicable? can it be applied on qb 2011?

tHANKS!"
,shandriswc,2010-12-21T03:33Z,"Hello tfowler7 again,

I've already downloaded it and installed on my computer. I've just compressed the files into an iso cd format so I can mount it virtually in my virtual drive using poweriso. this is great! btw, its for qb 2011.

Do you have any additional version of this training software? It will be highly appreciated if you'll upload again. hope you have some.

Thank You very much and Merry Christmas!"
,tfowler7,2010-12-21T05:38Z,"Hello shandriswc,
Thanks, 
This is the only Quickbooks training I have. After taking some classes on Quickbooks
I found this to be the best guide.
If I find more I'll upload if possible.
Happy Holidays,

T.:."
,shandriswc,2010-12-21T09:27Z,"thank you very much tfowler7!

i hope you'll find some. you're simply the best!

you already helped 16 financially incapacitated individuals to learn and understand basic quickbooks easily and specially, freely!

after I've finished downloading, they all came into my house and asked for a copy. 

and lastly, they are sending their unending thanks to you!"
,tfowler7,2010-12-22T05:41Z,"shandriswc,

Your all very welcome. 
I began learning Quickbooks through the local Small Business Development Center which offers free, or nearly free classes on this and other subjects related to small business, such as drafting the business plan. This is an excellent resource and a great way to meet other small business owners.
Thanks,

,tfowler7,2010-12-22T16:46Z,"shandriswc,

I'm in the process of downloading some other Quickbooks training torrents and will link, re-up, and seed the ones that work. I have many other business related subjects archived. If there's any other subject I can upload I'd be glad to.

,brianxxx,2010-12-23T14:51Z,"THanks! Good QB training materials can be hard to come by.

Just to add a suggestion -  the Professor Teaches company has excellent step by step tutorials. Especially the ones for Office 2010 and QuickBooks.

Have not been able to grab any copies but if anyone buys them or see them circulating...bring it here! lol"

,yellowbeard68,2011-06-10T00:12Z,"I used these files to create an ISO image and mounted it with magicISO (free program)...runs fine. Creating ISOs not very hard tfowler7 - try out something like WINISO, or UltraISO next time, I think you will like it once learned :-) Thanks again for the files!"
,AxeEffect,2011-12-14T07:22Z,"Hey, thanks a lot for the upload, it works great! This is exactly what I needed, now I can finally put QuickBooks on my resume and hopefully get a job, haha.

Also, I originally transferred it to a CD and it did not work. I tried all that mounting ISO nonsense and got nothing but trouble.
I just made a small error and wanted to let you guys know so you don'y have to deal with the same issues in the future. 
When uploading the files onto a CD, do not upload the entire folder as a whole. Instead, open the folder and drag all the contents onto the CD. Then just reinsert the CD and it should work fine.
(also make sure you save it as a CD/DVD, not as a flash drive)"
,spunkster,2011-12-16T04:07Z,"Yeah why all this ISO disc mounting nonsense? What a waste of time. Who still uses CDs and DVDs for software in 2011?? I've had a stack of 50 blanks sitting on my desk for years and this is the first time I've ever had to touch one. Thanks, but I think I'll find a training solution that's just a regular, normal,  standard avi file (or folder of them)."

,lorenzorolls7s,2012-05-03T22:13Z,Works just fine.  See comments by AxeEffect.
