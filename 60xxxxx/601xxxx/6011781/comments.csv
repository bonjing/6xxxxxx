Just to check with you, is your fixes based on ""http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5941319/[Wheel_of_Time_13]_-_Towers_of_Midnight_(v1.0)_(best_version)"" or is it based on the ""original"" scanlation?

I am still downloading it now, will comment as soon as I began reading it, probably in a day or 2."
,zelrin,2010-12-09T23:00Z,Thank you so much!  This is far and away the best version out there.
