The series follows the lives of four dislikable social inadequates, each ostensibly studying at Scumbag College, but actually just doing whatever the hell they liked and having extremely strange, surreal adventures in the process.

The series starring Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer and Christoper Ryan ran from 1982 until 1985 for 26 episodes - not a bad airing for one of the most highly-charged, material-hungry British sitcoms ever made.

The Young Ones came into being partially as a result of the standup routines that then-Comedy Store regulars Mayall, Edmondson, Planer, Peter Richardson and others were creating, and which had already become the series which was to be known as The Comic Strip Presents.
