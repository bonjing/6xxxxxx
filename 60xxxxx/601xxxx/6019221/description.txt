This album comes from the outstanding Makasound label, who have built up an essential catalogue of 'must have' purchases in a very short time. Definitely competition for Blood and Fire and Pressure Sounds labels.

So, refreshingly, these are all original rhythms, no do overs of over familiar drum and bass lines. The production values are beautiful - serious and heavy Rockers drum patterns with an almost Black Ark ambience, even though it was recorded at the little known Concert Studios in Kingston JA.

The vocal harmonies are beautiful: Those of you that love Eric Donaldson, The Meditations, The Congos, Israel Vibration and Earth and Stone will undoubtedly be pleased with this release. It also sounds similar in style and spirit to The Upsetter track "Mash Down" from the Pressure Sounds "Voodooism" album.


Makasound have done a great job here, proving themselves to be a label worthy of respect.
