,qzpogi16,2010-12-06T09:44Z,is this working?
,qzpogi16,2010-12-06T11:10Z,"do not download this! you will regret on downloading this i promise! it just a folder that has the files in the winrar, but there's no winrar! fucking waste my time downloading this game!"
,JkCleary,2010-12-06T23:14Z,"you have to use umdgen to make the iso, but i forgot how x[."
,JkCleary,2010-12-06T23:31Z,"ok, just download umdgen and put the psp_game and the umd data.bin on the right side, then save as ISO. then transfer that to your psp"
,qzpogi16,2010-12-07T11:46Z,"sorry man, i was overreacting, well i tried it, and it works, but when you start it, it doesn't work!"
,razvan84,2010-12-07T17:23Z,"To :qzpogi16
Don`t sweat...just do what JK told you,
put the psp_game+umd data.bin....in umdgen.
And because `u don`t have psp_game folder just rename the folder in the same directory as umd data.bin .
If this don`t work try changind `u`r cfw....mybee prometheus will work(it does for me at leats...)"
,JkCleary,2010-12-07T19:16Z,"yea sorry, i'm not great at explaining things lol. but i ran it on prometheus and it's doing fine."
,tupaste,2010-12-09T09:05Z,"I already made an ISO out of the PSP_GAME folder and the UMD_DATA.bin, I downloaded the ISO into my PSP, but when I checked in  the games it wasn't there!"
,JIHUIN,2010-12-10T03:28Z,"I use UMDGen to convert these files into ISO, I have successfully converted it into ISO format and transfer it to my PSP Memory Stick. The icon of the appears in the screen but once I start the game it can not be played. The error message is ""The game could not be started. Error code 08000XXX.""

I'm using CFW 5.50 GEN-D3 and CFW 5.50 GEN-B and both of them get's the same error....I believe this game needs to be fix or decrypt first before you can play it. Can someone upload a fix version for this?"
,qzpogi16,2010-12-11T13:27Z,"same here, i converted the game in iso, the file size is 211mb, it wont appear in my psp, im using 5.50 gen d-2!"
,JkCleary,2010-12-12T00:54Z,well it worked fine for me...i ran it on 5.50 prometheus
,poch18,2010-12-23T04:01Z,can't someone just upload the iso file? it'll save everybody the pain and the misunderstandings...
