This is by far the most dramatic song I know of. Not Twilight Dramatic, this is September 11 dramatic. This is also the theme song of the movies Requiem For A Dream and Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. Ironically this song is a powerful requiem. It was composed by Clint Mansell. Words simply can't describe the power of this song. Enjoy.

Sorry about the incorrect album art.
