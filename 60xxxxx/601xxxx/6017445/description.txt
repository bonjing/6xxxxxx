           There were those who called him Icarus. Everyone else          
           knew him as a divorced father working for an investment        
           company. But they didn't know his other side-his dark          
           side. Because Icarus was at his best when he was killing       
           people. For years, he'd worked as a sleeper agent in           
           America-but when the Soviet Empire collapsed, he found         
           himself in a foreign country with no one to trust.             
           Determined to break from his dark past, he started over        
           with a new identity. But you can only escape your past         
           for so long. When a sudden mishap in Hong Kong blows           
           Icarus' identity, past and present collide - and the           
           assassin realizes he is now the target. The people that        
           want him dead will stop at nothing to get to him. And          
           that means going after what he cares about most-his wife       
           and daughter. Fighting for his life, Icarus is forced to       
           face the demons of his past to protect the loved ones in       
           his present. He must fight to save the only thing he's         
           ever done right in his life. He needs to uncover who is        
           after him and protect his family - before it's too late.
