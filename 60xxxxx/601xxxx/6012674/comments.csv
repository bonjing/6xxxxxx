Look here and you can say thank you

,User897,2010-12-05T15:22Z,"Thanks for the up, Stun.  Program installed fine.

Thanks for the link, grizzmo."
,grizzmo,2010-12-05T15:36Z,"extra tip.
Most isp got there own newsserver which is often free for their costumers. Can save you a few $$."
,User897,2010-12-07T00:06Z,"My ISP does not provide newsgroup access.  I just don't see the point in making this program available if you still have to pay to gain access.  Kinda defeats the purpose of a cracked program, doesn't it?"
,grizzmo,2010-12-07T08:58Z,"Well there are a few free newsservers around on the net.
Tip: don't know if you understand, but most used is IPV4. Now you can download a tunnel for IPV6(This is new!) search google and install.
Go here: http://www.gogo6.com/ register, download and install.
Then: free newsserver for ipv6: http://www.xsnews.nl/ipv6/ipv6_aanvraag.php

This is dutch, so don't know if it works for you!
Enter email and fill outthe form. There are probably isp's in your own country where to get this.
Don't know if this works with newsleecher!
But this method works with http://sabnzbd.org/

Have fun!"
,kevindd992002,2011-01-14T16:37Z,"I'm using this but it always has an error. When you try to open (not save) an nzb file while this program is not open (in the background) it comes up with some kind of ""corrupted"" error. You have to manually save the nzb file and double-click it to open it.

Another error is when files are downloading and you pause the process, close newsleecher and re-open it, a corrupted error will show again and it will remove all the items under repair/extract.

anyone experiencing this? is this really a pre-mature cracked program with many errors?"

,Newb787,2011-06-06T02:08Z,"Hmm. I'll stick with the 3.9, it's fully functional with the exception of super search."
,Shazam_777,2011-06-10T05:46Z,"@ Stun, ""TLB' Try it, Like it, Buy it""  WTF is that mean? YOu posted a trial version?

,youmeatsix,2011-07-18T15:29Z,This works perfect! Thanks!!
,xantica33,2011-08-18T01:26Z,Keeps telling me to remove all references to newsleecher from the hosts file..... AND my router.
,NoBugsOnMe,2011-10-21T04:31Z,AWESOME!!!!!!! Works on W7 x64 as of 10/20/11! All functions!
,gigahertz21,2012-02-26T08:36Z,"Been installed on my computer for 6 months or so now, still works for those that want to know.  I don't use it though, I mainly stick to SAB now, I just like it better."
