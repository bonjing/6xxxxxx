Plot:

A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great French chef despite his family\'s wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy\'s passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down
