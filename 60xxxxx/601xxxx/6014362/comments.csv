,notouchx,2012-03-14T10:04Z,"Acorn has recently released the US version of ""Upstairs Downstairs The Complete Series 40th Anniversary Collection"".  It's up on amazon, and has not been torrented yet to my knowledge.

That collection is going to be the best quality that can be had, because the original series was recorded on video tape instead of film, which is very unfortunate but there's nothing to be done about it.  Quality will be slightly better than what you see here because they went back to the originals from iTV and did a better job of translating it to NTSC than previous collections.

That collection is also remarkable because it is the first and only edition with English subtitles for all 5 seasons.  At present none of the subtitle sites have these; you will only be able to find subtitles for Season 1 and part of Season 2."
