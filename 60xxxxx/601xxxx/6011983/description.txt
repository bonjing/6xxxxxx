Well you all kept asking for it so here it is.

System Requirements:
Windows XP (I believe it will run in 98, as for Vista and 7 I'm still unsure)
At least a Pentium 2 class computer with 196 meg ram

What does it do?
I uses a proxified version of portable firefox + internet explorer to produce 2 unique full page views on your website per wave. It fools all counter systems and has been proving to actually work on some ad companies.

New changes:
Added new features to the GUI panel, including throttle, the ability to select more than one list and added a proxy finder(still some errors there that im working on)
Added Facebook and Twitter links with rotating banner ads.

How to set the homepages for firefox:
Its got a button on the GUI now to set additional targets, open that and change the homepages to what ever you want, close and then run the Page Blaster again.
