Allmusic Review:
The distanced cool of Diana Krall's vocals lends itself well to the wintry flavor of the three holiday favorites that make up her Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas EP, highlighted by her rendition of Vince Guaraldi's "Christmas Time Is Here." [The Japanese version adds three non-holiday bonus tracks.]
