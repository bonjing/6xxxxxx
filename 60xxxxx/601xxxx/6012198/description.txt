This cannily observant early P.G. Wodehouse story was lost for 99 years, now recently discovered. It has some classic "Plum" ingredients: an eccentric Earl, an irresponsible young man, a chorus girl, and of course a butler, not Jeeves (Wodehouse hadn't created him yet!) but the ancient 'Keeling', who has more worldly wisdom than anybody.


Uploader's note.
I caught this recently on radio 4 and I believe it was only the 2nd time it's been broadcast.
It fills a 15 minute slot and I was a little reluctant to upload somthing so small but I'm sure there's a lot of Wodehouse fans out there that would like to hear it so here it is. It was part of a BBC radio 4 Lost and Found series which had 2 other stories / parts but this was the only Wodehouse story.
