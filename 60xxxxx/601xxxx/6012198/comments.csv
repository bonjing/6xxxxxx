there doesn't seem to be a way to PM you, my reason for joining, so I'll have to ask here. PM back from where you got this if you want to.
I have nothing against people uploading my stuff elsewhere. Not one bit.
What I don't like is - well take a look at the description ""Uploader's note"". That's my note. I caught it recently not you. It belongs in my upload but not yours. Did you not, for one small moment, even think I'd better delete the uploader's note? You could of just adjusted it a little. I even enclosed a doc file with my upload that is for use for people like you who just copy and paste everything without the slightest thought. Why do so many people do it?
Next time watch out. You might be surprised what you find in my uploader's note."
,JakeTucker,2010-12-05T02:46Z,Also - unless you use a different name - I noticed your one of the minions who don't even leave a thanks comment of which I often hint I really appreciate. Really appreciate.

,Lucy1948,2011-01-22T17:13Z,"Mr Jake Tucker. I can see your blood pressure rising as you type!

Just chill out!

I have uploaded over 700 of my own torrents over the past 6 years and they have been cross posted to different sites regularly by other people.

I don't mind because it helps to keep the torrent alive because more people get to see them.

Look on it as a complement.  I not only liked your audiobook and felt it was worthy of a larger audience but I also like you presentation and hence I kept your text.

Take Care and Look After Yourself
