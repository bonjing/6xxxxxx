,n08s,2010-12-05T18:52Z,"Sorry, but because of some stupid (and scary) copywright laws, to help avoid being
busted for uploading and seeding torrents like this one, I've had to include a 
password for you to unzip this file for residents of the US, UK and Canada, and other
countries.

Don't worry, it's simple.

Go to http://www.bestpcdownloads.com/

Click to follow the instructions.

After entering any valid email address and some info your password will show up.

Don't forget to Seed and Enjoy!"
,ramrad,2010-12-05T22:59Z,Working just fine as always. Thank you TvTeam. Don't listen to spammers and hackers. This is just a simple avi file.
,OCFreak,2010-12-06T01:22Z,"Come on people, seed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand it. The whole point of file sharing ... is to share. Stop being so damn stingy."
,Sontaran,2010-12-06T09:07Z,"Thank-you to TVTeam!
Good speed on this torrent (I'm getting about 200KiB/s).

And, to those in doubt, it is indeed an .avi file.

To those trying to scare us off: there's no point in pretending it's an RAR, since the user can see right away, when choosing the directory to download the file to, that it's an AVI file."
