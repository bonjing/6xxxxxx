BBC Limbo Babies HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Documentary looking at the Catholic Church's historical attitude to stillborn babies, who were denied burial on consecrated ground because they had not been baptised. The film includes a report on Milltown Cemetery in Belfast, where land containing unmarked graves was unwittingly sold to a wildlife reserve. Families talk about their distress, and Fr Thomas Norris of the International Theological Commission, which advises the Pope, gives the Church's current position.
