This video has no logos or titles.


"Hey Baby (Drop It to the Floor)" is a song by hip-hop artist and rapper Pitbull released as the first single from his album, Planet Pit. It features T-Pain. It was released digitally on September 14, 2010. The song was produced by Parisian electro-house producer Sandy Vee.

Amar Toor from Aol Radio Blog said that the song is "a pulsating rhythm and electrified beats, the track seems like it's tailor-made for South Beach's hottest dance floors. [...] Pitbull's reggaeton roots are evident throughout "Hey Baby", as a persistent, pulsating beat keeps the song grooving along, from start to finish. And as always, T-Pain puts his own indelible, Auto-Tuned stamp on the song, as he croons, "Hey Baby Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can be my girl I can be your man / And we can pump this jam however you want."

According with an interview from Pitbull in MTV News, the music video was filmed in Miami.
