,NaNaMoose,2010-12-06T00:20Z,"Is that you Walford?! Thank God for you! I don't know why PB is always messing with you. Your a pillar of this thing & everytime you ""disappear"" I freak out because you are apparently the ONLY source for this in the whole WORLD! I knew you wouldn't let us down. Thank you sincerely. I hope all is well on the home front. Respect."

there you will find a backup of the torrents that I've previously uploaded to TPB"
