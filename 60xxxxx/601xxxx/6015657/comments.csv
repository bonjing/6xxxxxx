if you cant get higher res try this
(ive only tested in wind 7 32bit)

go to
C:\Users\username\Documents\Disney Interactive Studios\Tron Evolution\UnrealEngine3\GridGame\Config


http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/gridengine.png

then open gridengine.ini with notepad:
change your res as desired like in picture:

can any body know how to change the control in game""WHEELMAN"" pc version,,
"
,Shoobox,2010-12-08T19:51Z,"@royhere
for wheelman

It does support xbox controller. Problem is it only has two preconfigured configurations for keyboard and 2 for controller. You cannot make custom configuration. 

or try

C:\Program Files\Ubisoft Entertainment\Wheelman\PC\WheelmanGame\Config

and double click

Coalesced.ini

The search for

m_aWheelmanInputBind

and try changing keys there. Seen similar things on other unreal engine games. "
,Shoobox,2010-12-08T19:57Z,"@royhere

i know on wheelman you have to open the
Coalesced.ini with notepad++ regular notepad won't work for the wheelman .ini file 
or you have to use winhex to open and change it.


or try:
change your keybord settings in windows to a QWERTY-arangement in configuration panel.

thats all i really have to offer maybe someone who has spent more time iwth the game, could be further help"

make sure you have enough space for when extraction starts on your drive.

always back files up before deleting ,saved games ect. ect.

1.first picture will show you in win 7 where to delete registry,
    1st. go to start, 
             type: (regedit) in search,
                     follow my picture to find the folder to delete.
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/tronregeditdeletemanual.png

    2nd, go to start, then documents in documents delete the ""disney interactive studios folder"" as shown in picture
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/trondocufolderdelete.png


2. i use peazip (faster better extractor) extract tptb shroo folder tron,
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/peazipone.png
          1st.(peazip lets you drag and drop) right to desktop -or preffered extractor, open extract to desktop
            2nd.Once extracted to desktop, go to tron evolution folder run setup
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/tronsetupbatch.png


3. One game is finished install through Shroos self extraction method,
     download shroos regfix 
dc192.4shared(.)com/download/JcnSRJr0/regfix-TRON.rar?tsid=20101208-104648-b640c7a6
        remove (  ) from obove link after coping past in adress bar, download.
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/tronregfixdownload.png
extract the download regfix file after download ""3 files all together""
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/8989696.png
 put them inside the main tron evolution folder on your desktop.
    once in the tron foldero n desktop cick the unistall reggie,
then run the reg.exe as admin 
http://i1119.photobucket.com/albums/k630/Shoobox/tron/refix.png

then click on the tron evolution by tptb launcher, game should then work.
this is what i had to do after trying numerious things of it not working for me
every pc is different.

,Shoobox,2010-12-10T04:28Z,"these particular games seem to be a big default on win7 64,

it's because games for windows LIVE Update Redistributable needs a patch, it seems most 64 bit win 7 have the issue with 
""The ordinal 5372 couldn't be located in ur DLL, xlive.dll""
if you downloaded only the file and not games for windows live i would try that. ""install games for windows live 3.0""
or wipe tron off your system and start over from scratch.
you had said in a earlier post mate you setup batch, got stuck on crunch, did you try to continue the game launcher when you forced it to close?, might be missing some install files,
i would just take tron off your hdd and re-extract shroo game and restart from fresh install extraction.
if you forced the cancel through task manager,
it def might be missing files.

if your going to try reloaded version, only thing i could think of would be, make sure tptb games are wiped off the system so you don't have a conflict when you install the reloaded ones,
