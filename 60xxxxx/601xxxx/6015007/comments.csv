,dunstall,2010-12-06T04:34Z,It's actually just a 10 min 'making of' preview. It's very good tho and is definitely going to be one of the better shows to air next year.

,honunet,2011-04-04T04:22Z,"then fucking say trailer torrentzone.  Or preview or something besides s01e00 implying it;s a leak or screener (like walking dead) or pilot.  Really, with all your good work I am amazed you guys are pulling this shit.  And dont give me the you should know from the size bs.  Yes I would know, which is why I checked for mkv but some won't."

Nice trash upload TZ, wtf?"
,banneddogg,2011-05-19T00:06Z,"@honunet, really? don't you think 90% of d/l's know the score? Seeing as there has been a S01E01 and now through to S0105 who except a fuckwit would think that S01E00 would be anything else but a taster OR (as it is i believe, not having seen it ) a Making Of. All hail the U/L's and Seeders alike, long live Torrents :)"
