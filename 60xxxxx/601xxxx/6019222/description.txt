The members of an expedition in search for the last faithful of Kito, the cannibal god, land on a small island in the Moluccas (East Indies) and are soon hunted by cannibals and zombies, these being created by a sinister Doctor O'Brien who is experimenting with corpses. Suzan, a sexy lady in the expedition team, eventually takes a hold on things, as she is accepted as queen of the cannibals, and direct them against the mad scientist and his army of zombies.
