New in PerfectDisk 1911 Build 182:
We corrected an issue which was preventing the PerfectDisk user interface from correctly saving user settings to the registry.
We corrected a scheduling bug on virtual computers. When the start time was missed the user interface displayed a date of 1899.
We corrected an issue with the welcome screen always displaying when PerfectDisk was launched even though is should not have.
We ensured compatability with Exchange 2007, SP3 and have allowed PerfectDisk to defragment data stores in this configuration.
We corrected a bug which caused PerfectDisk to crash if the MFT exceeded 80GB.
