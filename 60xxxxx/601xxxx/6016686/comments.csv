,MGTGamer,2010-12-06T21:52Z,i think there is no way to install these (cracked) apps without jailbreak...u have to jailbreak your ipod...and i also think you should do it coz you can do much more than just pirate apps with your jailbroken ipod
,r-0987,2010-12-07T15:14Z,i know but i'm scared that my ipod might get corrupted !!
,MGTGamer,2010-12-07T17:59Z,"it is very hard to brick the ipod or iphone...one way to brick it has something to do with editing system files...and of course the second way is to smash it with a brick...so if you won't try anything it should be ok...and if it isn't ok, one-click restore repairs everything..except broken display if you really smashed your ipod with a brick..."
