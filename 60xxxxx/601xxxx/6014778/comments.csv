Peerblock is blocking blacklisted individuals as well."

,reallyman,2010-12-29T22:11Z,"AMAZING work on this - what an undertaking!

Seriously, how long did this take you?  Thank you...

I'm 0.6% after some time at 50MB up/down, anything to share re. alternate links or good time to pull?

Thanks again"
,reallyman,2010-12-29T22:28Z,"btw, are anyone else's comments disappearing?  "
,JustinRudyNitschke,2011-01-08T06:11Z,Can we please get someone to seed this? I'm not getting past 0.6%

that's the description I intended on
btw Musiciso is just a different way to get what you want. It's a forum that you sign up for... seems shady but the links for this torrent in its completed state are there. help seed if you can get those links downloaded."
