Didn't rip any of these myself just found 'em and spread 'em to the masses. Whomever ripped the Projects probably dumped them from streams found on the sites above.

I highly suggest DFX http://www.fxsound.com/ it can really enhance all the subtle details audiophiles love.

To play flac files:
foobar2000 http://www.foobar2000.org/ 
Winamp http://www.winamp.com might need a plugin for this
VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/

I cleaned and made the names more consistent.
