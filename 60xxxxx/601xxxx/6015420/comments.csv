Yeah, insane86 appears to be a legit uploader.  He's been upping torrents since the beginning of November with only positive comments.

And I'm one of the members who calls fakes out.  They are easy to spot.  This one doesn't fit those criteria.

[T],insane86,2010-12-06T08:42Z,@PhilLesh12 Thanks for your comment :)
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-06T09:07Z,"A lot of people avoid any torrent not uploaded by a member with a skull next to their name.

I think a MOD needs to give you trusted status."
[T],insane86,2010-12-06T09:41Z,"I applied for a trusted skull but their answer was ""too soon for that"""
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-06T10:23Z,"There was a guy who uploaded ""An Idiot Abroad"", a Gervais/Merchant show from Sky 1, that had only uploaded one or two shows but some MOD gave him a trusted skull based on the comments in his torrents.

I'm guessing that asking for it isn't as ""trusting"" as having users saying you deserve it.

IDK, but if you keep uploading good stuff that people like, it's bound to happen.  

The MOD named ""hiding"" gave Ferrelas a trusted skull after his second upload.

Like I said, someone will notice, at some point."

versus 1.46 gb for the same show from others.
You deserve the scull because all your uploads have been outstanding/perfect
quality...thanks for such great work 
The sculls should be calling you for advice on how to decode and provide perfection"
