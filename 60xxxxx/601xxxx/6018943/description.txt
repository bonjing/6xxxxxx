Spirited Away (åƒã¨åƒå°‹ã®ç¥žéš ã—, Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi?, literally, Sen and The Spiriting Away of Chihiro) is a 2001 Japanese animated  fantasy-adventure film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. The film theme is dislocation and it follows a sullen ten-year-old girl who is in the process of moving to a new neighborhood with her family, leaving her old friends and school behind, and chronicles of her adventures in a world of spirits and monsters. Miyazaki\'s technique as artist involves taking a child\'s primal wish, transporting kids to a fantasy world they cannot escape. There the viewer experiences phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams, fascinating and frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil.


The film received many awards, including the second Oscar ever awarded for Best Animated Feature, the first anime  film to win an Academy Award, and the first (and so far only) non-English speaking animation to win. The film also won the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (tied with Bloody Sunday) and is among the top ten in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

Spirited Away overtook Titanic (at the time the top grossing film worldwide) in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history.



Plot

Ten-year-old Chihiro (è»é‡Ž åƒå°‹ Ogino Chihiro) is moving with her parents to a new town when they become lost and find what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro\'s father decides to explore it while a reluctant Chihiro and her mother accompany him. They soon discover a stall with food, and Chihiro\'s parents sample the food, but find themselves unable to stop eating. Chihiro soon realizes that she\'s in a magical world when she sees her parents literally turn into pigs.

Running to get help, Chihiro finds a boy, Haku, who smuggles her into a large bathhouse and tells her to find a job so she can stay there until he can help her recover her parents and escape. Haku also hints that he knew Chihiro when she was little. Haku instructs Sen to see Kamajii at the boiler room to ask for work. Kamaji a grumpy but kind hearted fellow says he has no work for Chihiro and entrusts her to Lin to take her up to Yubaba.

Yubaba, the cranky, elderly witch who runs the bathhouse, agrees to let Chihiro work for her, but takes all of Chihiro\'s name except the first character of her first name (åƒ), which Yubaba calls \"Sen.\" Sen later learns that Yubaba controls her servants by taking their names.

Sen\'s first customer is a heavily polluted river spirit that all of the other workers avoid. When Sen successfully cleans the spirit, it rewards her with a dumpling-like object. Afterward, Sen discovers that Haku is actually a dragon, and when he is attacked in this form by shikigami in the form of paper birds, leaving him seriously wounded, she feeds him the dumpling. Haku coughs up a seal and an odd black slug, which Sen kills. When Haku remains unresponsive, Kamaji, the six-armed man who runs the bathhouse\'s boiler room, tells Sen to visit Zeniba, Yubaba\'s twin sister, who owns the seal, so the curse on the seal can be lifted. Kamajii gives Sen train tickets for her to be able to travel to Zeniba\'s swamp. She is accompanied by Boh, Yubaba\'s giant baby son, whocm Zeniba enchants into a mouse, a small bird and No face who Sen lure out of the bathhouse after causing much rampage.
