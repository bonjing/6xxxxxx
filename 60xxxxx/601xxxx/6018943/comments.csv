,rajvipul,2011-02-21T13:22Z,"ALL THOSE GUYS HAVING PROBLEM WITH ENGLISH AUDIO TRACK IN VLC....TRY THIS
DOWNLOAD::: Mkvtoolnix ::: under this there is program called mkvmerge GUI...add the movie file and unselect the italian and chinese audio tracks and start muxing....!!! and then play the movie in windows media player 11..or if you want to keep those audio...simply make the English audio as the default audio in the program and start muxing...!!! hope it helps"
,tintincentury,2011-02-28T11:48Z,"dude, theres something wrong with the audio. The Italian sounds perfect but the Japanese and English have problem. Its like the movie usually goes mute. Happens all the time!"
,master_b415,2011-03-06T11:25Z,"there are audio discordance's (choppy audio) when viewing movie  - and verified when burning convertXtoDVD also announces audio errors aka  ""audio discordance's"" throughout the audio as well. The Vid track viewed just fine. Tnx 4 the effort tho..."
,max_planck_no_1,2011-04-11T09:21Z,"I can also confirm that the english audio tract stops for about half a second every 10-15 seconds or so. Its annoying to listen to.

I am trying the mkvtoolnix fix that rajvipul posted. I'll get back to you."
,max_planck_no_1,2011-04-11T09:29Z,"I tried the mkvtoolnix and IT DOESN""T WORK.


The video quality is very very good (DVD level) but the english audio is slightly choppy and it will eventually annoy you and detract from the experience.

I recommend that you stay away from this torrent unless you want to listen to japanese audio."
,kalas-claes,2011-05-16T15:26Z,"What is wrong with you people? ""The English audio track is crap"". Don't download stuff if you don't know how to use it. You can't get decent sound without a proper codec.

Personally, I use Media Player Classic Home Cinema with the K-lite codec pack and both audio and video are up to expectations.

Also, this movie is great and I love it still to this day."
,nil7,2011-05-16T19:31Z,"I tried jap+eng subs, and tried to clean as suggested using mkvmerge.

In my case it works fine in media player classic. However both VLC player and my network media player have 'snaps' in it where the sound pauses for a split second every 5-10 seconds.

Wierd, problem is I want to use my network media player, so I have to find a better rip... :( Or I could try to find the DVD, which I know I have *somewhere* in my collection... :)"
,Monroville,2011-06-01T05:45Z,"A few other things to take into account:

(1) when remuxing in MKVmerge, go to FORMAT SPECIFIC OPTIONS tab (middle or second tab in the lower area) and change FPS (frames per second) to: 24000/1001 for the audio and video to play at the proper speed.

(2) I can confirm that Windows Media Player plays the file fine, but VLC will cause a stutter every 5 to 10 seconds as posted by others.  This could be an issue in the Header information (which can be accessed in the top tab labeled FILE, then HEADER EDITOR.  Open SPIRITED AWAY and maybe check the AUDIO header information.

I'm testing to see if it plays properly on my Argosy HV335T when hooked straight into my HDTV."
,shinobiXRT,2011-07-02T02:09Z,"sounds problems, stutters every few secs constantly

a = 3"
,lies3,2011-07-22T18:24Z,"Or, don't use VLC cause it's crap. Use WMP and the CCCP codec pack if you have to, better. VLC has all kinds of display and sound issues. Doesn't look very good much of the time."
,sdfef,2011-08-25T11:32Z,"guys..DONT PANIC..the audio problem related to this print is restricted to vlc only..solution is ....
1)if u r on windows OS then use kmplayer...it will be just fine..
2)for any one on linux,I recommend you smplayer..i think its the greatest video player available for any platform...just add the canonical repository if u r on ubuntu and add pacman repository if on opensuse...
Though this rip is a bit inflated for the quality it offers,but it is the best available for this movie...hav a gr8 tym..."
,dinoboy1234,2011-08-29T10:41Z,How do you change the audio?
,reichert,2011-10-12T07:40Z,"

I confirm...:
the audio problem is restricted to VLC player only...

I run it with Quick Time 7  and the english Audio is fine with out audio tract stops for about half a second every 10-15 seconds or so.

,jeremyn,2011-10-23T02:27Z,audio problems dont download
,Damo-Suzuki,2012-02-23T14:02Z,"For anyone wondering how to play in english follow these instructions: (This will work for italian aswell)

1) Go to http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/ and download AVI-Mux GUI - Select the appropriate version for your computer. If you are on windows 7 select ""v1.17.8.3 - binary""

2) Download file, extract, and open the ""AVIMux_GUI"" application

3) Drag and drop your Spirited Away 720p HDTV.mkv file into the allocated area (Blank box) at the top of the screen that comes up after opening the programme

4) Double click on the title that appears in the  blank box and you will have a series of AUDIO:, VIDEO: and SUBTITLE: options appear below.

5) Right click on the only ""VIDEO:"" option and uncheck ""default track""

6) Right click on the japanese audio option (LC_AAC (MPEG ..... jpn) (Make sure its the audio track that ends in that ends in ,JPN)

7) uncheck the box on the left hand side of this audio track

8) Now you need to set your preffered language as ""Default track' - Right click on either the audio track ending in ""ITA"" if you want the language to be Italian, or ending in ""ENG"" if you want the language to be english and select ""Default track""

9) If you want subtitles displayed (because you're eating chips and cant hear the words properly) right click on the subtitle track you want to enable (Either ENG, ITA, or VIE) and select ""Default track""

10) Uncheck the boxes beside all options you have not set as ""Default track"" EXCEPT leave the box ticked beside the ONLY ""VIDEO"" track

11) Your screen should show your preffered audio option and subtitle option highlighted in bold - check that these options are correct, then proceed to click the ""Start"" button in the lower right hand corner. Choose what you want to call your file, and where you want to save it, then click save. 

Let the programme do its thing, and it will notify you when it has created the new file with your preffered audio and subtitle options. 

Open your new file (You may have called it ""Spirited Away (English)"" or something along those lines) in A media player (Don't use VLC - the audio will skip - it gets very annoying. I watched it in XBMC, which is a really great free media centre which I highly recommend. Played the movie no trouble at all

If you have any problems that I might be able to answer, or if I didnt explain something properly, just ask me a question in the comments and ill try get back to you

Thanks for the torrent Collerom, and I hope I helped somebody to enjoy this great movie in their Native language :D"
,Damo-Suzuki,2012-02-23T14:03Z,"Sorry - Let me add for Step 6) Right click on the japanese audio option (LC_AAC (MPEG ..... jpn) (Make sure its the audio track that ends in that ends in ,JPN) and uncheck ""Default track""."
,sarah1133,2012-04-02T03:23Z,"Nice video, but the English audio is badly encoded (lots of clipping and noise) and more than a full second out of sync. Unless you want the Italian audio, do not download this one."
,zemsantos,2012-04-24T00:15Z,"For the MAC users: download Mkvtoolnix, select only the tracks that you want and save as new file. Then use Quicktime 7. Worked for me :)"
,zemsantos,2012-05-02T21:30Z,"Correction: Worked for a few minutes, them the sound start's to fail. I'm giving up on this torrent :("
