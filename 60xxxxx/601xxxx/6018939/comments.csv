,nikoHD,2010-12-07T15:24Z,hi 20/40 regarding my previous comment on the other torrent i meant the new doctor who with billie piper as rose and David Tennant as the doctor. I can't seem to find that anywhere. Ps keep up the great uploads.
,punk67,2010-12-07T15:32Z,"Thanks so much yet again twentyforty your expertise,dedication and commitment is greatly appreciated and recieved by all!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-07T15:34Z,Thanks.
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-07T15:59Z,"@nikoHD: I do not follow good Dr. at all, I watched Special with Kylie and one later with Michelle Ryan.

You have uploaders who are specialized in Dr.Who ups, and main source of confusion is, obviously, inability to get right what you have been looking for,

Tennant and Rosie have been together in

Season 2

Series is called Doctor Who 2005 - as distinction to original, old series I asked you about.

So - I can send you a DLC for jdownloader for ALL seasons (1-5) of Doctor Who 2005 and you can choose which ones you'll download.

Remind me with e-mail and I would reply."
