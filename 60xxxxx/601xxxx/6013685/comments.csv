http://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce 

and it still gives me connection reset by peer in the tracker list on utorrent. I am going to give it another few hours then try this again.

If anyone knows what i have done wrong, please share that info with me please."
,dondadah,2010-12-05T20:02Z,"well it seems to have sorted itself out, after about 10 hours from the time I uped the torrent here, and I didn't even have to hit it with a hammer.
