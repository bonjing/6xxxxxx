Video quality is terrible on this. Hopefully someone propers this release.

naimy123: Audio and video seems to work, but the video encode is terrible. I'd wait for a group with a clue to release a better version."

By the way, the quality was not up to the usual high standards.  Stopped watching it after 5 minutes to get a better release"
