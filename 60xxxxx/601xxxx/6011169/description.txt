MIDletPascal is Pascal-like programming language specifically suited for development of mobile applications. MIDletPascal compiler translates Pascal code into Javaâ„¢ micro edition (J2ME) bytecode. Programs written in MIDletPascal can be executed on any mobile device (such as mobile phones) supporting MIDP 1.0 and CLDC 1.0 platform. 

With MIDletPascal language developing mobile applications is easy and straightforward. If you are already familiar with Pascal, Delphi or Kylix you can start writing your own mobile applications within minutes.

MIDletPascal comes with user-friendly IDE (integrated development environment) for Windows. The IDE has integrated compiler, Java bytecode preverifier, JAR archive builder and emulator so compiling and building MIDlets is as easy as a push of a button. 

Since MIDletPascal generates low-level Javaâ„¢ bytecode, generated MIDlets have small footprint and run fast. Some similar tools that can be found on the Internet generate an intermediate code and pack it with an interpreter into a JAR file - that approach creates large JAR files for distribution and yields slow execution. MIDletPascal directly generates Java bytecode, so you donâ€™t need Java compiler installed on your machine, and compile process is very fast.
