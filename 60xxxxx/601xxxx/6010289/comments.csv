[T],PeteSapai,2010-12-04T20:31Z,"drive-786 is so right! Asking questions about the torrent, what the hell were you thinking?!? You can't just come here and use the comment field for its intended purpose. You even forgot to offend someone!
/sarcasm

Aaaaanyway, about the quality: it's a 720p Bluray rip. (And this isn't me saying what the title says, this is me commenting on the actual quality.)"

,behold_the_radiant_brow,2010-12-05T05:47Z,"From IMDB:

Trivia
The original cut that Ben Affleck screened for producers was 4 hours long. After realizing that the film would never appeal to wide audiences, he cut the film down to 2 hours and 50 minutes in three days. After screening that version, the studio and producers loved it but knew that it was still too long. Affleck and producer Basil Iwanyk eventually had to cut beloved footage and personal favorite scenes to make the film work. The film then went through more change at a studio standpoint when they wanted the film at no more than 2hours and 10 minutes. Eventually, Affleck cut the film down to 2 hours and 8 minutes, ultimately trimming action sequences, character development and dialog. Affleck, while happy with the theatrical cut, stated that an Extended Cut will be featured on the DVD and BluRay with deleted scenes on top of that. He also stated that, while the theatrical cut of The Town is a close adaptation of Prince of Thieves (the novel which it is based on), the extended cut is a mirror of the novel, staying more true to the book."

,kinvore,2010-12-07T04:36Z,"Thanks for the upload!

I can't help but notice that currently two of the (supposedly) highest-seeded versions of this movie are downloading at painfully slow speeds.  Think the studios are doing something to screw up the download speeds?

Yes I'm a noob. :P"
,anarchydesign,2010-12-08T12:33Z,gah - been trying to download for a few days now - i've only downloaded 604mb and i've uploaded 914mb... everything is going so slow!

I'm not a fan of throttling, but I'm going to if you ppl don't start opening up your bandwidth.

To those who are ULing at a decent speed, thank you!"

,floyen,2011-01-08T23:35Z,"So....anybody out there who actually has seen this?
VLC, GOM Player, Media player, KPM no one of these can handle the format ""undf""...whatever that is.

Message in VLC is like this
No suitable decoder module:
VLC does not support the audio or video format ""undf"". Unfortunately there is no way for you to fix this."
,Wisper83,2011-01-11T09:42Z,MPCSTAR (it comes with BitComet) plays it 
,Wisper83,2011-01-11T13:13Z,"it runns fine with wmp too i think you might have a codec problem

,Ropower,2011-02-09T14:44Z,"DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER at imdb, it reveals the whole plot and the plot twist"
,Sanyi001,2011-05-18T21:33Z,why does it say 720p but then it actually only is  1280x536?
,insoc_cr,2011-07-11T21:39Z,"@Sanyi001: for your information a 720p resolution is = to 1280 x 720 where as a 1080p resolution is = to 1920 x 1080. So the video info is actually correct, almost 720p. By the way, the 1280 x 720 resolution is in perfect match with a 16:9 size display."
,en0nym0us,2011-09-08T21:54Z,@BigElly20 That's because your PC sucks ass.
