"Last Call"

When the body of a dockworker turned bar 
owner is found floating in the East River, 
Castle and Beckett's investigation takes 
them into the forgotten tunnels and 
passageways of turn-of-the-century New 
York, where they uncover a secret that's 
been buried since the days of Prohibition. 
The story celebrates New York bar culture, 
setting Castle on a quest to preserve 
history by buying a bar of his very own.

Enjoy :)
