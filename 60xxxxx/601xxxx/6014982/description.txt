   Release Notes:

   A ZoÎ´ Mode production for the video game charity initiative              
   OneBigGame, Chime pits gamers against the melody in an all-new puzzle    
   experience. Place blocks against the clock, complete solid quads and     
   try to cover the whole playing surface, all the while remixing and       
   embellishing pieces by musicians from across the planet. And you get     
   to feel good about yourself, too: The console version of Chime was       
   originally developed for OneBigGame with all the developerÃ†s royalties   
   going to Charity for sales up to June 2010, and Zoe Mode will continue   
   to donate a proportion of its royalties (equivalent to 5% of purchase    
   price) for sales of the Steam version. OneBigGame always aims to         
   donate a minimum of 80% of all donations to its charity partners Save    
   the Children and the Starlight Children's foundation.                    
                                                                            
   Puzzle: Rotate and place shapes to form solid quads and fill up the      
   grid before the time runs out                                            
                                                                            
   Listen: Chime features music by Moby, Paul Hartnoll (Orbital), and more  
                                                                            
   Remix: Fill the grid to alter the track loop, place pieces to play       
   notes, and create quads to trigger a range of song samples               
                                                                            
   Replay: Reset the grid by reaching 100% and continue playing and beat    
   your high score                                                          
                                                                            
   Experience: Each of the six unique levels is made up of its own music,   
   grid, and shape sets, including the new Portal-inspired sixth level:     
   "Still Alive".                                                           
                                                                            
   Free-play mode: Choose between three different levels of difficulty or   
   just play for the sake of making music with no time pressure
