,skillet92,2010-12-05T07:35Z,"Thanks alot for this one! 
Was actually expecting a 480p release.!!!

Thanks man! :)"
[T],frapper101,2010-12-05T08:01Z,"thank u for dis....aprreciate it
:)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-05T08:07Z,"Thanks.

I always do 7 minutes test encodes - and 720p was ""just"" 180 MB bigger (480p would be 820  MB) but at least 25% better looking, that I have decided to go with 720-272p combo-release. Keep in mind that 352p normal-length was released just two days ago and now anyone can find size/format which can fit both needs and budget. "
,skillet92,2010-12-05T08:25Z,yeah...this release is like a package deal for all!
,vNa5h,2010-12-05T08:49Z,"^^^ budget....lol
thanks for this release"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-05T09:28Z,"@vNa5h: Great majority of my ""regulars"", for years, is very cost-aware, on very tight allowance (and budget). Giving them opportunity to choose between three versions (and file size) of the same title is not something I'd take too easily."
,r-0987,2010-12-05T10:58Z,Thanks For This And Uploading Few Episodes Of The Amanda Show!!!
,r-0987,2010-12-05T11:26Z,"I Wanted To Know If You Are Doing Star Trek [2010] Anytime ? [Not A Request, Just Wanted To Know]."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-05T11:29Z,"@r-0987: As I told you, I have found only random five episodes altogether. Yesterday I upped one and I would try to squeeze remaining four in future TV packs in."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-05T11:45Z,"@r-0987: Star Trek is 2009 not 2010 and it's done three times more than year ago. I'm not planning to redo one in foreseeable future, but maybe I would put existing 272p in one future movie pack."
,r-0987,2010-12-05T12:50Z,It Will Be Great..........
,tylr,2010-12-05T16:37Z,"i'll go with 272p BRRip, thanks for providing a choice"
,r-0987,2010-12-05T22:03Z,"Sorry For That Mistake........ Just 1 More Request!
Since Despicable Me Blu-Ray Is out , could You Upload It In 272p?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-05T22:19Z,"@r-0987:  Nope, DVDrip was good enough for 272p.

,justregged,2010-12-07T00:17Z,Thank you 20-40 great encode as usual cheers+1
,theaetetus,2010-12-07T01:32Z,"Thank you so much for this!

It's so nice to see someone making good use of x264, as opposed to the practice at one private tracker for example, where must uploads are terribly overripped."
,DLSteve,2011-04-05T12:23Z,"20-40, I would like to say thank you for your diligent work, I'm sure the community appreciates it very much.

I would like to ask you a question tho, with your movies I seem to get a recurring problem, about 80% through I get a stuttering with the audio, and it then goes out of sinc, this usually makes watching the movie unpleasant.

""The Abyss"" stopped just after 2 hours and stalls there. ""

""The Town"" stutters almost at the end, then the audios gone.

I use the same setup as you, LED Tv with external HDD connected via USB.

Some advice would be appreciated. Thank you twenty-fourty"
