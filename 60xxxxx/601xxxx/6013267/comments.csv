,perthites,2011-05-14T05:31Z,a=10; v=10 - only down fall is that fast forward/rewind seems to have been disabled.
,perthites,2011-05-14T06:48Z,despite my previous comment - this is the 2nd copy of this movie i've downloaded on piratebay that cuts off - there is no ending to this torrent - by how much i dont know but guessing it would be another 10-15 minutes - the movie cuts off just as it gets exciting towards the end of the movie - i guess i'll just have to juz go hire it out of blockbuster to watch the ending - i'm not all the inclined on wasting another GIG of d/l usage incase the 3rd copy is cut off also
