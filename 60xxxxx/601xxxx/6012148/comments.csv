If you wanna try a Beta of a free tool called zAudioConverter, that does this. http://www.digitalsoftware.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=289"

,dnoth,2011-05-28T02:58Z,Thanks to insinuendo for upping and aksman for the ripping! Excellent work.
,Ezel,2011-06-12T01:17Z,Is there some reason these vinyl-rips should be better than CD-rips (FLAC of course)? Or are the vinyl-versions different in some way to the CD-albums?
,Ep0x1d,2011-06-26T14:31Z,"Amazing work and quality, thx so much :)"
,BOOSTEROUT,2011-06-29T00:42Z,"For me this doesnt work properly in VLC, it jumps before songs are finished ... and it's not caused by VLC settings !"
,asianrage,2011-08-05T10:20Z,awesome rip!! Thanks.
,mojo01,2011-08-08T16:48Z,"@Ezel the main difference between vinyl and CD rips is dynamics. Most CD's over the last 2 decades have had the dynamics squashed out of them due to the ""loudness war"", which is particularly present in modern music. Vinyl has a nice limit to how loud music can be before the needle jumps off, so it's forced to retain most of the dynamics."

,_kewlCat,2011-11-30T16:48Z,"Vinyl Rocks with top quality recordings, thanks Insinuendo. 

To maximize her pleasure, listen to FLAC 24/96 quality with the correct app to know how great these recordings this really are. If you use winamp or iTunes, you might as well just rip from the cd and listen to mp3@128 quality.

But, with the correct app and sound card (must be 24bit sound card), FLAC 24/96 will sound so much better than the actual CD in a CD player.

Amazing audio quality

Thx !"
,sixsixtysix,2012-04-11T05:26Z,"""the correct app"" are you retarded? how does winamp play the files differently? "
,cm74522,2012-06-10T23:25Z,"great torrent! the only discography with good quality i found.... 
i have an question: is 96000Hz really necessary?
today i made a test, i re-sampled 2 musics to 48000Hz and calculated the difference with the original.... in ~97% of the music the difference was 0, and the only parts that had any difference, was only inaudible (the amplitude very low, and frequency about  40000Hz) 

in a nut-shell: re-sampling to 48000Hz made no loss and gave half the size in .wav 

i will continue to seed forever anyway"
