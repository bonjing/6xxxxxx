Why buy it for 100 usd on ebay??? Oh yeah cause the red vinyl doesn't really come through. Well here is a FLAC vinyl rip of a record that has a couple high spots! I like Ty more than othre current Goner artists. Stay tuned for more good recent releases on vinyl FLAC format. The best way to archive! 

I HAVE OVER 15,000 LPS AND 45'S 78'S PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
