- Glenn Greenwald on the Arrest of Julian Assange and the U.S. "War on WikiLeaks"

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has been arrested in London on an international warrant to face sex crime allegations in Sweden. Assange is expected to face a hasty extradition process to Sweden. We speak with Glenn Greenwald, constitutional attorney and blogger at Salon.com. Greenwald says, "Whatever you think of WikiLeaks, they've never been charged with a crime, let alone indicted or convicted... They've been essentially removed from the internet... Their funds have been frozen... Leading politicians and media figures have called for their assassination, their murder, to be labeled a terrorist organization. What's really going on here is a war over control of the internet and whether or not the internet can actually serve what a lot of people hoped its ultimate purpose was, which was to allow citizens to band together and democratize the checks on the world's most powerful factions."

The Guardian newspaper reported the cables provide evidence that spying, threats and promises of aid formed part of U.S. diplomatic offensive to shore up the controversial Copenhagen accord. Amy Goodman questions European Union Commissioner for Climate Action Connie Hedegaard about the account of her discussion with U.S. negotiators on leveraging climate aid to gain the support of vulnerable nations.

- Bill McKibben: Climate Talks So Weakened by U.S., Major Polluters That Walkout Could Be Good News for Planet

Longtime environmental writer and activist and 350.org Founder Bill McKibben has won the 2010 Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship. Speaking outside the U.N. Climate Change Conference in CancÃºn, McKibben says: "In certain ways, [a U.S. walk-out] would be the best thing that could happen. For 15 years ... the U.S. comes and says, weaken the agreement so Congress can go along. Then Congress does not agree anyway. It has wrecked the whole process time after time after time and now the U.S. is doing it again."
