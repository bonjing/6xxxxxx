The Aquabats - Radio Down EP

THE AQUABATS!, the world's favorite rock superheroes, will release their new digital
EP RADIO DOWN! on November 9 via Fearless Records. This digital-only three-song
EP features guest vocals from hip hop legend Biz Markie.

RADIO DOWN! serves as a precursor to the band's in-progress album, slated for release
in early 2011. The Aquabats! EP release is timed with the kick-off of their live tour with
Reel Big Fish, which will launch at the Yo Gabba Gabba! LIVE! performance at Salt Lake City, Utah.
