Scorching a path up the New York Times bestseller list, Jeffery Deaverâ€™s Lincoln 
Rhyme novels set new standards for popular suspense. In The Burning Wire, a 
mysterious killer has seized control of New York Cityâ€™s power grid to create 
violent, deadly electrical attacks that turn everyday objects into weapons of 
mass estruction. And as the suspected terrorist begins making outrageous demands, 
Rhyme and his team know the time to stop him is running short.

From JefferyDeaver.com:

Lincoln Rhyme is back, on the trail of a killer whose weapon of choice cripples 
New York City with fear.

The weapon is invisible and omnipresent.  Without it, modern society grinds to a 
halt.  It is the electrical grid.  The killer harnesses and steers huge arc 
flashes with voltage so high, and heat so searing, that steel melts and his 
victims are set afire, or subtly reconnects a few wires in one's house or office 
so that the bathtub, the sink, the computer keyboard, the simple desk lamp can 
kill.

When the first horrific attack occurs in broad daylight, reducing a city bus to a 
pile of molten, shrapnel-riddled metal, officials fear terrorism.  Rhyme, a 
world-class forensic criminologist known for his successful apprehension of the 
most devious criminals, is immediately tapped for the investigation.  Long a 
quadriplegic, he assembles NYPD detective Amelia Sachs and officer Ron Pulaski as 
his eyes and ears and legs on crime sites, and FBI agent Fred Dellray as his 
undercover man on the street.  As the attacks continue across the city at a 
sickening pace, and terrifying demand letters begin appearing, the team works 
desperately against time and with maddeningly little forensic evidence to try to 
find the killer.   Or is it killers....?

Meanwhile, Rhyme is consulting on another high-profile investigation in Mexico 
with a most coveted quarry in his cross-hairs:  the hired killer known as the 
Watchmaker, one of the few criminals to have eluded Rhyme's net.

Juggling two massive investigations against a cruel ticking clock takes a toll on 
Rhyme's health.  Soon Rhyme is fighting on yet another front -- and his 
determination to work despite his physical limitations threatens to drive away 
his closest allies when he needs them most.
