"
,dbzwarrior,2010-12-15T17:46Z,"This is not 720p. Saying it is implies it is high definition and has a resolution of 1280x720. This video does not.

It's nothing more than the already-existing extended DVDs scaled up badly to a width of 1280 and letting the height reach a mere 528 as it maintains the aspect ratio."
,Shantanab,2010-12-15T20:33Z,"Audio bitrate 64Kbps,video bitrate 603 kbps...total BS job by uploader...stretching the video to 1280X568 does not make it 720p!

Don't download this crap,instead DL the previous extended version one that someone uploaded earlier"
,Shantanab,2010-12-15T20:35Z,Total shit rip..don't DL
