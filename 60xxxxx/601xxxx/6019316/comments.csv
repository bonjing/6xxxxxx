,dotsh,2010-12-07T18:53Z,works perfectly :> but is there any news about this archaeology bonus guide?
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T18:57Z,the archaeology guides isn't a download and it is a big joke anyway.  it is just a page explaining how the profession works.  wowpedia.org (formerly wowwiki.com) has more info for free about it
,dotsh,2010-12-07T19:46Z,thx for the fast replay. (i will keep seeding on) :>
,mickegsson,2010-12-07T19:51Z,"Does worgen work on this update?? it didnt on the first one

ill get bk to you about it :)"
,Jeppe_3333,2010-12-07T20:36Z,Thank you so much. No way I'm upgrading my Zygor account for ANOTHER $20 when I've spent $60 in the past. It's just lame to demand money like that.
,svetlania09,2010-12-07T20:42Z,Version 3.0.1557 has been released but since it doesn't do anything new just a reorganization of the guides I will not be posting it.  I have managed to get from lvl 43 this morning to lvl 52 in about 5 hours.  Guide has been flawless.
,sine123,2010-12-07T21:49Z,"I'd still upload the latest version if I were you, no matter how trivial the update is. Regardless, I still love you."
,diablito469,2010-12-08T02:22Z,anyone trying the 80-85 guide?  it sends me everywhere and then it spins out of control and then sends me to an area where i cant even get the FP yet..  
,pirate_12345,2010-12-08T03:02Z,"yo svet,
we need 1561 pronto,major change in guide data,but no pressure take your time we still love you...very much"
,Cigma,2010-12-08T13:17Z,"Guide addon gave an Error ""Cannot load 80-81 leveling guide"". Thanks for including all the guides."
,Cigma,2010-12-08T13:42Z,"The addon is not letting me load the 81+ guide.

,dr3amcast3r,2010-12-08T14:09Z,Thanks a lot mate. Working perfectly!
,imjedi,2010-12-08T14:12Z,Just a FYI. The Worgen experience also isn't working correct. It fails to identify several map locations(bails out) and then at the end spins wildly out of control and resets instead of advancing once level 13 is reached.
,DaemonicUV,2010-12-08T14:28Z,"I Actually haven't used the 80-85 guide yet. :S I started the quest it gives you when you come back to SW and that chain sends you off to Vashj'ir. So far the quests there are pretty linear. Finish one group of quests for these people, they send you somewhere else and you get another batch of quests there, and it has continued that way."
,Malk71,2010-12-11T09:27Z,"Thank you so much :)
But can you please upload the new version?"
,TPBrullz,2010-12-15T03:34Z,"hi, made an account just to come here and thank you for all the zygor uploads."
,VESTEROUT,2010-12-18T17:48Z,"it's my first attempt at downloading such a well known program in the internet trough utorrent and i hope it isnt any kind of virus and stuff but once i get it on, you'll get my feedback.

oh and by the way, svetlania09, if you have any way that i can chat with you, let me know, i have a few questions.

facebook, msn, skype, steam, etc."
,Archmaster0,2011-01-09T17:40Z,"Svet, nice upload, any chance you could get the 3.0.1668 update? Or have you even bought the guide?  It seems like no one has the newest copies for some time after they're out :("
,girardin,2011-02-09T04:42Z,Thank you so much for these guides they have been great! will you continue to update as they come out?
