[V],jainmehul,2010-12-08T12:25Z,Thanks for uploading that TJ... :)
,TheBleed,2010-12-08T21:15Z,"Jainmehul,

why don't you add the pre-order track to the torrent? Or make a new one and link it from here?"
[V],jainmehul,2010-12-09T09:11Z,"^^
i wouldn't create a torrent just for a single song... download it from TJ's link"
,referhead,2010-12-11T21:19Z," @jainmehul

so if its a itunes rip, then it musta came with the itunes bonus track. preorder or not.
 and i ul the single track cuz there was no use in uploading somethin that there is already plenty of. jus tryin to share. why be a dick. 

anyway ive uploaded no mercy with all bonus tracks(deluxe, itunes, and target) in 320kbps

Kindly stop shouting around others torrents to get ur torrents famous....

This is the normal deluxe version of itunes and at the time i uploaded this... there was no other torrent for it......

and the bonus track you are talking about to TJ the one you uploaded is a webrip (around 4MB) and the Tj one is itunes version (around 9MB).... "
