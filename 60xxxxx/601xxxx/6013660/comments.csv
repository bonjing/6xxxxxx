,hmtester,2010-12-05T17:03Z,"thanks for the great uploads.  Quick question for you thethingy, just saw the Pirate Bay lost their court appeal over copy rights, and as such, there's real possibility that PB may go down at some point in time.  Do you provide torrents to any other sites just in case PB goes down?"
[V],thethingy,2010-12-05T19:13Z,"hmtester, them people don't work here any more, the site is hosted by a Swedish political party and isn't going anywhere any time soon. "
,hbg716,2010-12-06T11:20Z,"the thingy:  I just want to to say tankyou because I could not afford to go to school and take classes for web design without you.  Everything you upload is top notch.  If fact, I do not look at other peoples uploads for software.  Sorry to be an ass kisser but you deserve some serious respect and thanks.  The only thing I could ask to clarify would be WTF to do with Acrobat and ant suite for installation.  It is almost like you have so much out there that noboby can find and answewr without hours of tracking.  Bottom line is we want the Master Suite and then install Acrobat X.  People are afraid of screwing up on when they do the other.  We are not all gifted like you.  Please keep it in mind.  

Either way.....  I appreciate you and you have allowed me to continue school.  I could not ever afforded to buy the crap.  Please keep things coming along.  I do not know how you do it or where you get it but I do not care.  In the end, you educate people.  Thanks the thethingy"
[V],thethingy,2010-12-06T11:26Z,"hbg716, you can install X or 9 with no issues, "

[V],thethingy,2010-12-24T15:16Z,"jessiemassacre, they just wont install, it says ""already installed"" and just installs the rest of the stuff"
,ThorMMVI,2010-12-30T02:46Z,"Thanks for sharing !! It was a little work to get it installed, but well worth it!! :-) "
,DesgnSmrt,2011-01-05T05:14Z,"First of all thethingy, thank you - I can't comprehend how gracious I am for you uploading this and making it seamless to download and install.

My question is, is it ok the use the CS live services with these applications? Or will Adobe somehow detect me if I log in to CS live?"
,javaidrana1,2011-01-06T05:46Z,"Thethingy I must salute you.. You helped me ( a poor student, unemployed, family of five with sick wife) alot. I am taking web design classes, I could never afford these software which I got free from you. 
I would have lost myself in these hard times. but thanks to you and Thanks to God. "

,tennispro,2011-01-09T01:12Z,"Im not sure if im doing something wrong but when i use utorrent to download, the torrent fully downloads but then when i click the icon to open it, it says

""The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows youâ€™re running. Check your computerâ€™s system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.""

Does anyone know how I can make the torrent fully work?"

This may work for you and it may not. Look up ""Microsoft Deramspark"" at https://www.dreamspark.com/ (don't forget the S). "
,GloryDeis,2011-01-18T19:37Z,"Where can I find a serial number for this version?

Call Adobe on the phone. Have your credit card ready. Then answer this one question: why do you want to update a stolen program that works fine? "
,zuettel,2011-03-18T09:58Z,"Anyone also having Illustrator crash right after loading it? Strange enough it also says TRYOUT VERSION on the loading screen. Loads the Programm, then exits immediatly.

All other Elements of the suite work fine (Photoshop, Fireworks, etc etc) and also don't show 'TRY OUT VERSION').

I copyed the amtlib.dll over and changed the hostfile... :/ 

Any idea?"
