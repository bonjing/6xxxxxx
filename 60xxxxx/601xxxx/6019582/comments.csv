,dmoss74,2011-02-21T08:45Z,"thanks for this one. i love BB and was/am a huge CW fan. trixie  was an integral element in most of his work, either singing (round and round) or artwork (din of ecstasy). 

this is a great collaboration, and i hope it lasts. 

brian blade is one of the best drummers on the planet. "
