Manmade God is the self-titled (and only) album by the rock band Manmade God.

I came across this CD in the basement of a New York record store. It's good enough and rare enough to share. It's fairly heavy, unlike most of the shitty stuff being put out today. The vocals, guitars, and drums are all so good that it's a shame this band put out only one record.

Which you can all have now.

Enjoy.
