System of a Down (also known as System or more commonly by its acronym, SOAD) is an alternative metal band formed ethnic Armenians in Glendale, California, in 1995. At first they called Soil, but then adopted the name System of a Down inspired by the poem Victims of a Down, written by guitarist Daron Malakian. They are famous for performing songs whose lyrics speak out against child abuse, violence, war, pornography, violent and sexist, the predominance of material interests in society, social inequalities, physical and ideological intolerance or discrimination, among others.

It is composed of Serj Tankian (composition, vocals, keyboards and occasionally guitar), Daron Malakian (composition, guitar and vocals), Shavo Odadjian (bass) and John Dolmayan (drums).
