STORY
As children, Ruth, Kathy and Tommy, spend their childhood at a seemingly idyllic English boarding school. As they grow into young adults, they find that they have to come to terms with the strength of the love they feel for each other, while preparing themselves for the haunting reality that awaits them.

iNK NOTES
Found this online with the help of some friends. There was a bit of confusion about where the source came from, decided PPV due to watermark, thus why this release name has been changed from SCR to PPV for v2. Cropped out borders, fixed AR, brightened it up a slight margin, along with it's closes cousin, contrast, Deblocker, Smoother.. Audio was given a bit of life, tad bass, tad treble, threw in a noise grabber and hum smacker. Here's my version two of it. Enjoy //iNK
