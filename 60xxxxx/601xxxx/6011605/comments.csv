[T],jerry7_57,2010-12-04T18:53Z,Thank You!!
,some-young-guy,2010-12-04T20:33Z,"Yes, this torrent is much better than the other 2 I've DL'ed.  The hum is gone, the A/V is in sync and the video quality is slightly better, though the other 2 the quality was also pretty good.  Anyway, this one will leave you feeling some things and make you appreciate life just a little bit more."

,givemefreeshit,2010-12-09T21:03Z,"Not complaining or anything, just a remark about the quality.
The video quality is pretty bad, very blocky with lots of encoding artifacts, maybe the source was bad to begin with, PPV.
To bad for me, I'll wait for a DVD rip.
Thnx anyway"

Comparing this file to others of the same size and length of movie...the video quality is horible. 

Many thanks to raymondhome for providing hundreds of quality videos....this one however is not one of them. Sorry.
