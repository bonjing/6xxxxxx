Please see this.

Best time to DL this from me is from about 6pm-9am 7 days a week central time. 

If you are not gettig it fast or have slow services just DL and wait. Be patient.

Look for others, comment, and make requests."

,xMajesticMeteorx,2012-05-21T18:48Z,What's the crap with the FLAC!?!  Damn-it not everyone has a burner and software to convert into mp3. I'm sick of listening to Flacs through my PC speakers!
