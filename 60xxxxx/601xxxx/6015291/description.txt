"Happy Birthday (200th Episode)"

When a pregnant woman is assaulted, 
Horatio and the team fight for her and 
her baby's life while tracking down her 
attacker.

Guess you posers really are that desperate
for credits for your rat cappers. How sad.
Im sure everyone still living in 1961 with
their 13inch b/w monophonic televisions 
appreciates your complete lack of know-
ledge, talent, and effort.

Rarring and spreading releases while they 
are still uploading and muxing is fairly 
simple. All you have to do is lie about 
final packed size in all the .rxx headers
and then patch the .rar with the correct
size. There is a slight bit more to it,
but anyone can figure out the rest with
minimlal research and effort. Kinda sad 
it took their second rate coder recruiting 
from yet another worthless low quality 
group to figure it out. 

Still to come

Muxing while uploading using custom shit 
tools.
Why certain groups are still using 
x264.exe revisions that are 300+ old.

Make sure you collect all the nfo's
and you too can start your own 
(1)ClickTasticUnit and get leet sites to
pre shit no one wants on. Stay tuned!

Enjoy :)
