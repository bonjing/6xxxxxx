Velvet Revolver - Slither [promo].VOB



HQ promo music video. "Slither" is a song by American hard rock band Velvet Revolver, featured on their 2004 debut album Contraband. When released as the lead single from the album in 2004, "Slither" topped both the American Billboard Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts, as well as reaching number 56 on the main Billboard Hot 100 chart and number 35 on the UK Singles Chart.

The song reached #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and stayed there for 9 weeks. It also became their sole #1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, maintaining the position for 4 weeks. "Slither" also charted at #56 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it Velvet Revolver's highest charting song and one of the highest charting songs that Scott Weiland has appeared on.

The music video starts with the band members are playing their instruments inside a tunnel and a woman is driving a car seeking for the way to get to that tunnel. As the song goes far, people become much more aggressive and the underground concert soared high as well as band members play hard. Often in the video, the lead singer is seen standing before a wall made of human skulls. On the other side, the woman gets helped by a man to find out the passage.

*I'm posting this (and a few more) promo videos from this band because of my disappoinment with the quality of a 4.3 GB unofficial DVD that's posted here. The promos were terrible in quality, with half of them at 320x240, and most with logos. All the live videos were of good quality though.
