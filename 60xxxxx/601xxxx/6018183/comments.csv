,bakaonna,2010-12-07T18:36Z,I'm unable to download - are you sure the .torrent file (as uploaded to TPB) is intact ? I'm getting a small text file with an error message instead of a standard .torrent.
,SNMaou,2010-12-08T06:38Z,I'm having the same problem as bakaonna.
,spatax,2010-12-09T10:29Z,same problem here
,Magical_widget,2010-12-13T16:27Z,"Neither torrent nor Magnet link works for me either, but it seems someone managed to download the file or the seeder is now seeding from 2 different locations, because it's showing 2 seeders now. 

If someone has downloaded it, please tell us how you did it.
Thanks in advance.


@UPLOADER
If you can't fix the torrent link, maybe you could create a new torrent?"
,chrispm84,2011-01-14T10:10Z,"I can't download either... It opens uTorrent when I use the magnet link, but shows size as nothing and no seeds... Anon, please reupload so we can get this awesome game, from the venerable GOG.com!!!"
,Luckmann,2011-02-18T01:15Z,I don't suppose anyone could take the time to upload Planescape: Torment one of these days?
