Documentary series looking at the South Pacific.

Part 1. Ocean of Islands.
Their extraordinary isolation has created some of the most curious, surprising and precarious examples of life found anywhere on Earth; from giant crabs that tear open coconuts, to flesh-eating caterpillars that impale their prey on dagger-like claws. Human culture is different, too. The men of Pentecost Island celebrate their annual harvest by leaping from tall wooden scaffolds, with only forest vines to break their fall. And on the tiny island of Anuta, possibly the most remote community of people on the planet, the locals survive entirely on what they can grow and catch.
