,missy09,2011-05-18T18:42Z,Has anyone verified this? Is it good to d/l?
,animatedmalamute,2011-07-02T05:25Z,"Very good video quality, but there is indeed a watermark - a ""Disney Cinemagic"" watermark in the lower left hand corner, similar to a TV channel's watermark.

*shrugs* For me, the quality makes it worth the d/l"
,jerry123,2011-07-15T20:45Z,How do I remove the commentary audio??
,yoncenator,2011-08-30T23:44Z,"Excellent quality, so the fuck what if there's a Disney cinemagic watermark.  This is DVD quality and so far no glitches.  Way better than MitzEvX upload. Thank you kindly. 10/10"
,angek370,2011-10-04T04:44Z,"Great HD quality. Watermark in the corner's not that bad. I love this movie, it's hilarious."
,lesterg,2012-04-12T19:05Z,"There is no Blu-ray, the HDTV broadcast is as good as it gets for now. 

Everyone knows Disney is a dinosaur when it comes to releasing movies on home media. "
,lesterg,2012-04-12T19:06Z,The fact that's it's a TV broadcast being the reason for the watermark of course.
