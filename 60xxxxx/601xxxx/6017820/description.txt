After Mac Miller's first mixtape he joined Beedie(his friends older bro)and the duo know as The Ill Spoken put out How High The Mixtape before going on with solo careers. This has some good shit on it that isnt played alot and should be. So when your done downloading please seed and share with everyone else. I am.
