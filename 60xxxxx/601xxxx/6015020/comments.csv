,jamvaru,2010-12-06T11:05Z,"i think they mean the gibberish text in the description, needs cleaning

i'm still going to try it out, looks nice

i like that you maxed the cd out, though i don't agree with driverpacks in general, makes it easy to give to others as a christ-mass present

thanks, i'll see how it goes"

,AgenPro,2011-04-26T14:40Z,How To Install..?
,fairytales,2011-07-06T17:03Z,"AgenPro, to Install it < 1st press enter to boot from cd /dvd , 2nd press f1 to go to the menu , 3rd use intall with all drivers ( the 3rd one from up ) , that is it < it contains a lot of drivers and will recognize yr computer , this widow is advanced version of the windows essentials , uploaded long time ago and has very nice install screen , it is fast and compatible with all programs I used , there is no key required or activation , Nice scheme , I advice u in all xps to disable restore and automatic updates , and use image for Hard disk instead , thanks a lot for the uploader"
,fairytales,2011-07-06T17:09Z,"use any IMG burn software to make the cd from the Iso file , I used Ashampoo ver 7 ( very old ) to prepare the cd from the Iso file , that is all"
,fairytales,2011-07-13T14:25Z,"well, after a month of using it , I prefere windows xp Black edition , but it is better than the normal xp, the only advantage of it from my point of view, it has a driver for my LCD screen and driver for audio . not really a great advantage as I can install them externally , now I will look for the latest version of the XP Blac edition"
,sammy.young,2012-02-12T17:23Z,"i installed it, and its working fine, but some of the updates u promised was not included. and during installation an error message appeared saying c:\DPsFnshr.exe cannot be found but it did not affect the installation... as i said i have installed it and its working"
