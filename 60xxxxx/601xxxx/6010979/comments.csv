,zalozalo,2011-01-26T08:57Z,What the F**K is the point of rar-ing and zip-ing in multiple parts. Is this 1990 or what?
,RoBoMon,2011-02-16T18:18Z,@zalozalo - stop b!tc#!#@ and just use 7Zip context menu to unzip them all into the same folder... and unpackage... www.7zip.com this isn't 1990 where you have to use winzip... or windows built in compression support.
,bt1970,2011-02-20T14:14Z,unzip '*.zip'
,tyggy,2011-03-18T15:55Z,"oh, rar parts in folders â that really sucks"
,imahaxyoo,2011-03-26T12:35Z,"Is everyone seriously packing a whinge over it being multiple .rar/.zip files? Come on this guy has given you the latest version with a keygen, give the guy a fucking break."
,xVoltarex,2011-04-02T03:25Z,"I might not like how it was packaged either, but it's easy to fix.  Assuming you're on a mac, highlight all of the zip files at once, right click, and click 'open.'  All of the rar parts will unzip at once, all you do is close the various finder windows that pop open.

Next, do a search for 'rar' in the search box in finder, and change the directory to the root, and click 'file name' so that it searches for all of the rar files.  Finally, you can copy them to another directory, and unrar them with simplyrar, unrarx, whatever."
