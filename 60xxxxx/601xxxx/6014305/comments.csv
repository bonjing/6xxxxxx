,jimraso,2010-12-05T20:34Z,Taxi Driver has never been released in Bluray. This must be an HDTV or hd dvd rip

,pizzahut123,2010-12-05T20:50Z,taxi driver isnt on bluray yet. you fail!
[T],zeromancer,2010-12-05T20:57Z,probably a poorly upscaled dvd version.
,jimraso,2010-12-06T00:28Z,"I've got an HDTV rip of this movie, with a 9000 bit rate, and it is still mediocre. I've heard that scorcese lost the original print for this movie, so i doubt that there will ever be an excellent bluray.  too bad, because this is a great movie"
[T],Herakler,2010-12-06T06:34Z,"@Guys : so sorry about wrong info . I don't remember this is HDTVrip ver , my bad

Herakler has uploaded 17 movies in the last 16 days. And mind you, each and every single movie is very clear and in the range of 700 Mb.

From the very first movie till this one, all of them are good.

Now, are you gonna judge his rips just on a mistake of writing BRrip instead of HDTV. That too it has been corrected.

If you'll say he has failed.............God helps u man.


@ Herakler

The movie is very clear
The size is perfect

In short.....this is an excellent rip.


@ zeromancer

u say lol ? may be u can do a better rip.......

and then upload it for all of us...........

or may be u cannot.................... lol."
,jarman007,2010-12-06T14:20Z,"print isn't very clear as your other rips i have downloaded 
 but considering its a old movie and no bluray availabe......it is a great upload"
