,tylr,2010-12-09T05:58Z,"^^^ i seriously doubt that..

..people downloading a 19Gb torrent,  is a feat in  itself... hey RiDD, ""make a  note of this"".. not many people wud feel happy about seeding a torrent as BIG like this one.

pl. do seed aftr finishing download"
,skillet92,2010-12-09T06:04Z,"@tylr : the seed count will increase only if ppl are downloading the whole series!
if ppl jus download 2 or 3 seasons for example they would be counted as peers only!
as they havent downloaded the whole series!

so don worry abt the seed count...if riddler A seeds this for like more than 1 week it is more than enough for us to complete it..and help him seeding it!"

Why don't you fukin keep it that way and post QUALITY?  A? V?  That is what's helpful.  Not your begging on every fukin torrent he ups.  If you need a movie in a certain format so badly encode it yourself.  Otherwise, let him pick what he ups, comment on quality and give thanks, or STFU!"

,flareus1,2011-03-26T02:54Z,"Just browsed through the comments and couldn't find anything related to this:
Am I the only one with an issue in episode 6 of season 8 (The One with the Halloween Party)?
At about 16:20 it cuts and shows video that doesn't belong there. The audio keeps going like normal.. Anyone else or maybe just an issue on my side?"
,cp712,2011-04-05T05:40Z,"@ flareus1

I agree. Season 8, episode 6 has a problem where the audio stays contiguous while the video has changed to an unrelated scene and the rest of the file is off. 

There was also an error in Season 7, episode 9 where the file is corrupt right after the Friends main intro music, and closes whichever player I use abruptly. I have to manually jump past that point, to avoid the file closing on me. 

There might be more errors, but I've only watched until Season 8 episode 6 right now."

obviously its not HDTV like current shows but considering what time period it was shot in, and the amount of poor quality copies out there, id say this is probably the best i've seen

However, if you were hoping to burn them straight to a disk or play them on your Television with an external hard drive - then there's a likely chance that it doesn't support .MKV. I recommend downloading each season one by one from ""Seriemesteren"" on TPB, it will also take less time.

,spifkitten99,2011-08-04T18:56Z,"Useless!!!

Each episode is only around 85 mb. That is not enough for it to be of watchable quality.

Maybe this is fine for you ipod or similar. Nothing else."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-04T19:06Z,"ripper, x264 is better than xvid, but it's not fucking magic. You can't get good quality at all, if you compress it down to just 85 megs, at 480p."
,spifkitten99,2011-08-04T19:09Z,"Unwatchable on any kind of device. A still picture looks somewhat ok, but when there's any kind of movement, it's very jerky movement. But that's what you get when you make an 22 minute 480p video just 85 megs."
,duranachampion,2011-08-05T21:29Z,"The truth is that this is not a torrent for collectors who wish to see this show again and again. This is for those, who want to watch it once and then delete it. Small size comes with its issues...pixels, haziness...definitely watchable..but not a keeper."
,2247,2011-08-06T15:22Z,"@spifkitten99 and @duranachampion

This quality is pretty much the best you're going to get. I am a collector and I used to own the whole box set on DVD, however the whole thing got damaged when I moved homes.

The quality is almost the same, the DVD collection being marginally better

Like I said before, the Friends series' quality is limited due to when it was recorded. Any tv show around that time period has the same quality such as everybody loves raymond

This quality and the original dvd is the same when watching on something like a laptop screen, however on a TV it stretches the video quite a bit ,making this torrent's mkv's pixelated, however the DVD retains most of its quality due to its size....

But if you want the best quality you can get for Friends - Then just go buy the dvds coz ur not gonna get it from downloading any type of rips"

I love how you used the x264(not Xvid) in combination with MKV, all my favorite uploaders of movies (on other private/invite sites) use this combination and have 720p BR Rips of 2 hour films around or under 2gb with amazing bitrate and quality.

You definitely know what your doing, otherwise it would of been 40gb (twice the size), the same quality but avi/mpeg files with Xvid codect.  You are genius!  I cannot stress this enough.  I just downloaded a Two and a Half Men torrent of less episodes by a large margin yet it was nearly 30 gb, and they were of less quality than these.

Definitely will at least upload a 2:1 ratio if not more!  Couldn't find this on private sites without it being like 80gb, so thanks again!
