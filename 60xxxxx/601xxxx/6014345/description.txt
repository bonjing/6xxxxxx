A few FAQs Regarding my uploads :



1. What is x264? 


x264 is an open-source encoder for the H.264 codec used for High-Definition movies on HD-DVDs and Blu-Ray Discs. It has a high compression which is way superior to xvid. That means you get more quality at equal bitrates. A 700MB x264 rip will be sharper and more detailed than a 700MB xvid rip from the same source. x264 is the future in DVDrips!

02. What is a .mkv file? 


MKV means matroska video and it is a extensible open standard Audio/Video container (AVI is a container, too!). This file format combines several video streams, audiostreams, subtitles, chapters and information in only one file. It supports new standards like 6-channel AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) audio or x264 video.
