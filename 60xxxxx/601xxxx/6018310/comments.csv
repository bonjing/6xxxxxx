,Jayh00,2010-12-07T15:36Z,"@mntfrank
- Run the installer in ADMINISTRATOR MODE. (Right click on exe, etc...)

To others who are having the game freeze after 3 levels, run the game in Windows Compatibility Mode for XP SP3.  Worked for me (running Win7 64bit Pro)"
,Danzflor,2010-12-07T18:42Z,"Wow, this include today's update, damn that's fast. It's works like a charm, great torrent and thanks =D"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-07T19:32Z,"@klord2010

You and me both lol
and thanks

@mntfrank
i agree with Jayh00, try running it in administrator mode to install the game.

@Strikefear13

4 i missed and when i was going to upload 5, the game got an update on steam so i waited for this release. I didnt wanna upload 4 and 5 if people were gonna download 6"
,steff6667,2010-12-07T20:19Z,"hello could someone write what was fixed in 4 and 5

and other question

could someone write to THETA to crack the ""TEH INTERNETS"" content so it wont require internet and steam "
,steff6667,2010-12-07T20:22Z,"hello could someone write what was fixed in update 4 and 5

and also i have a questiion how to enable ""THE INTERNETS"" 

maybe someone could write to THETA  to make a crack for that content so no STEAM no INTERNET will be required"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-07T20:56Z,"@steff6667

anything that was fixed in 4 and 5 is proably in the description under changelog.

and you dont need steam or the internet to play this release. But i dont see how youd get the game without internet."
,mario_cro,2010-12-07T21:34Z,"still freezes after a while (aprox. lv 3) for me :(

,steff6667,2010-12-07T21:35Z,"hello again sorry for double  comment

there is a special LEVELS named ""TEH INTERNETS""
http://supermeatboy.com/38/Teh_Internets_/

to unlock them u need :
-20 bandages
-internet connection

so my question :
is there any way to get to that  LEVELS  maybe someone could write to THETA about special NO INTERNET CONNECTION/STEAM  crack for this levels ;]"
,steff6667,2010-12-07T21:49Z,"ok i spoke now  on THETA irc and the levels  of ""teh internets"" are not in game "
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-07T21:51Z,"@mario_cro

sorry to hear that


@steff6667

well from what i read from the link, it's an Xbox Exclusive feature."
,Jayh00,2010-12-07T22:15Z,"@mario_cro

Have you tried running the game in compatibility mode XP SP3 as I mentioned in my previous post?

That did the trick for me.

Just right click and go to properties of the .exe, and select the compatibility there..."
,PuffingKush,2010-12-08T00:21Z,"@Jayh00 & @alexisthebest Thanks for the installing tip!Really appreciated that. I do not have ""XP SP3"", I even went to start/all programs/windows update & I didn't recieve it.(there was a update that didn't install,""Sercurity Update for Microsoft.NET framework 1.1 SP1"")But when I run the program,a window opens up & then I get ""not responding"" which then I'm asked to ""close program"" or ""wait for program to respond"".Do I need to download XP SP3? I have XP SP2,but was wondering if there may be another way.Because I read that after level 3 that it crashed,but I can't even get it run.This is also the only copy I have,I do not have any other versions or updates.Any help would be appreciated! Thanks to uploader & the community (running Vista 32 bit)"
,PuffingKush,2010-12-08T00:30Z,"WOW! So I ran it as admin. started off the same as before except that after a lil bit of time it opened! Now I played thru the 1st 3 level and nothing happened but my other question is ""What can I do to make the game run smoother?"" because I have this on the 360 but on here it seems to have a bit of a delay of some sort.I'm able to play but it doesn't run as fast as it should.Should I download XP SP3? Any suggestions would be helpful again thanks to uploader"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-08T02:16Z,"@PuffingKush

Glad you can play.
Currently the PC version still has plenty of bugs, so you wont have the same experience as the xbox version for a while.

As for your computer.SP3 could help with performance, but it's still recommended to get SP3 either way. And also update your .NET Framework."
,endemoniada,2010-12-08T05:23Z,"What's the difference between this and the CPY version (which also has Update 6) ?

My Update 2 UNLEASHED is working great so far, I tried Update 3 UNLEASHED and it crashed a lot which is strange."
,Stu157,2010-12-08T08:35Z,"thanks for the upload!
i installed mine using admin and everything, however, im not very good at this sort of thing as i usually dont play too many pc games (excluding small games like minecraft etc)
anyway, i was wondering what files i have to remove/replace or add in to the directory. 
sorry if this is a bother or a common noob question you all don't really want to answer.
thanks :)"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-08T11:43Z,"@endemoniada

CPY is at update 5.
Not 100% on the actuall difference in fixes, but pretty sure it doesnt include the button mapping and most fixes.

@Stu157
nothing. once it's extracted to where you want, it's ready to play."
,freezoid,2010-12-08T17:45Z,"if game freezes at lvl 3 try to make new dir in game folder named UserData
i done this in ""/super meat boy/"" and ""/super meat boy/resources/"" and it fixed the problem"
,Billbob40,2010-12-09T04:32Z,"You CANNOT play this game by steam, steam are selling the game and could ban your account for downloading it for free ;3"
,Stu157,2010-12-09T06:54Z,"thanks for the feedback alex.
but this game isnt working for me at all.
ive ran both the game and installed it using XP SP3 compatibility but nothing seems to work. "
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-09T07:53Z,"@billbob40
it's unlikely you'll get banned.

@Stu157
sorry to hear that
try the newest release?
