Lynda.com InDesign CS5 Dynamic Publishing Workflows in XML.

In InDesign CS5: Dynamic Publishing Workflows in XML, Jim Maivald explores how XML tools can enhance the page design process in InDesign. This course covers using the Structure pane and Tags panel, understanding and writing code for integration into InDesign and external editors, and ultimately, adding dynamic content to pages with XML. The skills learned in this course will be applied directly to two real-world projects that are included in the final chapters: building a product sheet and a longer book. Exercise files accompany the course.
Topics include:

    * Understanding XML terminology
    * Identifying XML elements, attributes, and comments
    * Adding, moving, and deleting elements
    * Tagging and styling
    * Creating tables with XML
    * Building frame and flow layouts
    * Ordering with XSLT
    * Using the Document Type Definition in an XML workflow
