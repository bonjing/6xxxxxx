[V],prashant22,2010-12-06T14:17Z,"hey guys i wanted to know something..i hv uploaded 72 movies and every upload is nt the best..so i will tell my worst uploads:
-black hawk down
-apocalypto
-step up3(889mb one)
these 3 r the worst..

average r:
-accepted
-national security
-step up 2

rest all r the best...
these statistics r based on comparision with my source...on my 21"" there is a huge difference b/w my source and the worst 3 i hv mentioned..
a little difference in the next 3...

and no difference for the rest...

so what's ur say...m waiting for reply.."
,jarman007,2010-12-06T14:33Z,"from the worst uploads that you have told , i have downloaded only black hawk down........i found it
good........maybe because i am watching on 17"" laptop

so if you are saying black hawk down is your worst....then it means all will be great for me"
,DSIN,2010-12-06T15:01Z,"@Prashant : Highest Quality = Inception 
Lowest was Black hawk down (i did not dload ur last step up 3 ...since u warned as that u'll re-up) :(

as for we are marshall - i've watched it ... & i recommend the movie.. (for the record i don't like mathew fox as an actor.. though he was good in LOST)
but i think someone agreed to do this movie.. dunno who did :/
even if u r doin it ... do it after those requested movies dude (since it is an old movie).. desperately waitin for those ass-kick LIST movies :D "
,prank0007,2010-12-06T15:44Z,"yeah bro i hav too 17"" laptop so cant choose that bad quality.As for 3 movies (i did only black hawk down which is gud) on 17""
From my end no quality issues & so keep rockin bro........:)"
