There are only 683 cables, so none are missing - except the rest of the 25,000 - most of which we will probably never see due to this stupid strategy.

Assange should have learned from the ""DC Madam"" what good ""holding back some of the info"" on powerful people does; she was found suicided.  

Thanks for this torrent, though."
,bluecar5556,2011-01-27T09:02Z,"Google, ""FEMA requests 140M meals"" and look at the results, I challenge you!  There were 2 wells drilled by BP MC252_A and MC252_B and here is proof!
http://www.scribd.com/doc/33620729/BP-Initial-Exploration-Plan-MC-252-29977

The MC-252_B well was drilled 4-5 miles deep deliberately along the New Madrid Fault and we do not possess the technology to stop this gushing of methane, in hopes to shift the fault to depopulate the country and use FEMA camps to contain individuals. This is very REAL, I am completely serious and you have to realize that people have always attempted to control the world throughout human history but don't take my word for it.  Google, ""Rothschild"" which is the most wealthy family in the world.
g*o*o*.*g*l*/*U*E*y*N*t  -remove asterisk's, sorry I get ""Database error"" on TPB and, ""Error, try again"" ONLY when posting this link.  Again, don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.  I think I am on to something, hmm..."
,bluecar5556,2011-01-27T09:10Z,"The above link with asterisk's is PROOF the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is planning, as it states on the front page of the pdf document, ""Impact of New Madrid Seismic Zone Earthquakes on the Central USA"" which you can google if the link gets disabled which it will, I promise!  MC252_B well cannot be stopped so I advice people who live on or near the fault to move, it's only a matter of time."
