The next morning the group discovers a timer in the lab and ask Dr. Jenner what it is for. He tells them it is the countdown for the power supply to the building, and when it hits zero the building will self destruct. The group panicking, looks for a way to keep the electricity when Dr. Jenner locks them in, telling them it is humane and that their deaths will be swift and painless, the group, however, believes they can survive, and attempt to break out.
