Babaylon AD 2008

Blu-Ray Rip

2522kbps
1280x548 Resolution

DTS 5.1 Sound
AAC Sound


I wanted to keep the original DTS sound on this rip,
So you will need a compatible Player to hear it.

VLC is a good one. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/vlc/files/1.1.5/win32/vlc-1.1.5-win32.exe/download

Otherwise if you have SPDIF capabilities and a DTS compatible receiver, this should work fine with "Windows Media Center" as well.
You will not be able to hear the audio if you try to use "Windows Media Player"



Enjoy and please comment to let me know what you think. =}
