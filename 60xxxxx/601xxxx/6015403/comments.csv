Nice to actually hear what I suspect is the case!
Hearing you about the overleeched eztv torrents - hence i offer an alternative!

Normally if I up something, it's only very recently released (I don't bother otherwise), or been released prior on another tracker and is already well seeded.

Either way, you should always get good speeds from my torrents....."
