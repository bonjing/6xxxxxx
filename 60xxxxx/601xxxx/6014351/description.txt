http://leetleech.org/images/03327424559978277673.jpg



Obscure 2 CD set with some of his PPX recordings on CD 1 and the strange "Woke up
this morning and found myself dead" Bootleg from the "Scene"club New York
City,USA.Thats the in hundred different versions available chaos live show with Johnny
Winter and the drunken Jim Morrison,whos just spoke turbid,obscene and out of any
rhythm/song!Not an earmeal but a weird reference of a not even sorber jam out of the
garbeggecan!So just a collectors item and nothing more!
review By badliver

This may be the worst CD ever. It is a remake of the Nutmeg records, red vinyl High Live
and Dirty LP from the early 80's. Yeah I know I rated it as 5 Stars. I'll explain in a minute.
This is without a doubt the worst collection of Jimi Hendrix "music" ever. The session was
taped in a New York night club in 1968 and like the title says Jimi must have been wasted
that night. Very wasted! He misses every note and forgets every line to every song. Song
is probably the wrong word to use, there are no songs here, just a drug and booze
soaked jam session. His backing band is atrocious and it sounds like people keep
jumping up on stage and joining his band's attempt to make something that sounds like a
song. The comments caught on tape are pretty funny, you can just imagine the rowdy
stoned out late 60's scene going down...you would probably appreciate this album alot
more if you do some 60's style drugs. It's flat out awful.

Here is the good part. Jim Morrison was in attendence the night this was taped and he
jumps up on stage and tries to join in. He is even more wasted than Jimi Hendrix if you
can believe that. The song Morrison's Lament (also known as F.H.I.T.A.) is nothing more
than a drunken Morrison rolling around the floor of the stage repeating the words " F*#k
her in the assh@#le ". He changes it up a little by saying " F*#k her baby, in the
assh@#le " a few times.

Back in the early 80's when I bought this album my buddies and I would sit around and
get hammered listening to his good stuff like Axis Bold As Love or Are You
Experienced...then after we were good and ripped we'd slap High Live and Dirty on....we
could not stop laughing. I used to hurt myself laughing at F.H.I.T.A, we'd play that damn
song over and over and over...and then eat about 100 bags of dorritos.

Yes the music sucks. But if you had a blast cracking up at over this album back in the day
like I did you gotta get it just to play F.H.I.T.A on your buddy's phone answering
machines.

I love Jimi Hendrix music...but that ain't what this album is all about. I guess for
completists you'd have to buy it, and if you actually want to hear Hendrix and Morrison on
stage together ( as awful as it turned out) well here is your ticket. There are rumors that
Johhny Winter played in this jam session (Hendrix mentions his name) but Winter himself
denies that he was there or ever even met Morrison. This albums blows unless you are
looking for a laugh. That's the truth man...No s#@t!
review By Richard P. Mayhew

This CD has been around forever and I can't believe that they are still suckering people
into buying this crap. The sound is horrible and the performance (if you can call it that) is
even worse. If you like totally drunk musicians playing horribly, then by all means spend
your money on this crap. Yeah Jim Morrison is on it...but again it's a total waste of time
and money. If I could have given this CD 0 stars I would have. This is the best example of
what drugs and booze will do to you.
