,diehard_101,2011-01-31T09:26Z,Thanks for the upload. Love this movie.
,diehard_101,2011-02-02T23:44Z,Please change the spoken language in the description to anything but english. It's dubbed Italian I think over the english audio. you can still hear the english in the background. even if I spoke Italian it would annoy me. Oh well. Ebay here I come.
