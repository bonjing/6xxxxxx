You are gay. And I don't mean gay as in ""GAY"" bc that would be cool. 

You are TRULY a faggot.  Your mother and her huge, gaping vagina must be so ashamed of you. 

Beware it has a virus and your a giant pussy who knows NOTHING of FALSE POSITIVES! Do us all a favor and wash all the sand out of your vagina.

-Go Fuck Yourself

P.S You are still a faggot!"
