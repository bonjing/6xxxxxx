,shredthe,2010-12-08T00:56Z,are any of these the remastered reissues of the older albums?
,buddhawithagun,2010-12-08T00:58Z,yes.  some are.
,shredthe,2010-12-08T01:20Z,"Sorry, but what ones are remasters? I have the original cds but I don't have the remasters so it would be good to know. I'm sure I'm not the only person that finds the edition info crucial! Thanks for uploading Cohen!"
,buddhawithagun,2010-12-08T01:36Z,"Now that I'm looking, I think they are all remasters.  

Enjoy!  I saw him live last night.  He's still got it at 76!"
,guldkalle,2010-12-22T00:06Z,"Nice, thanks a lot for the upload."
,The561Hero,2011-01-09T20:50Z,So is it good to be remastered or not?
[H],politux,2011-02-20T23:56Z,Sweet upload.  Thanks.
,n0ha,2011-03-16T09:36Z,"thx!

loading the flacs, buying the vinyls - so everybody is happy "
,BloodHolds,2011-09-28T09:02Z,"Hi buddhawithagun, 

Did you rip these yourself from the original discs?  I ask because some of the albums sound like they have been transcoded from poor quality MP3s. Also, there are no FLAC log files.

Of course, you only said they were in FLAC format so you haven't lied.  I have many of these albums and the lossless audio sounds much better than most of your offering.

To others considering downloading this because they want LOSSLESS quality - look elsewhere."
,tiddler22,2011-10-21T18:40Z,"Lovely Stuff. Many Thanks.

Ignore the nonsense from BloodHolds above, these are all lossless FLAC."
[M],suzitastik,2011-11-06T09:02Z,"Really nice torrent, many thanks."
,nehoc,2012-01-06T01:13Z,2011 remasters are at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6775472/Leonard_Cohen_-_The_Complete_Studio_Albums_Collection_(2011)
