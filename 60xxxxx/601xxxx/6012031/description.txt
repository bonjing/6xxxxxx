Ming is a troubled young woman who has been able to see ghosts and contact to the dead ever since she was a little girl.

ItÃƒâ€ s been 15 years since she managed to escape from a mysterious ghost that kept following her.

One day she meets a young doctor named Buud, who visits her with a purpose. Buud knows that Ming can contact to the dead, so he wants her to find the reason behind the death of his father.

While his fatherÃƒâ€ s death was recorded by the police as being suicide, he believes it was murder. The appearance of Buud brings back memories of the past, and now Ming must face a truth that is even more terrible.

For now she is being stalked by that same lost soul who is far more dangerous than any Ghost she has met so far.
