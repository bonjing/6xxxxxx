"Shop Till You Drop (150th Episode)"

Mac and the team search for the killer of a 
department store manager who was found dead 
in a holiday display window.

What exactly is the difference between a CBS
5.1 and a CBS 2.0 through a Dolby ProLogic 
II(e) receiver? Sadly, since cbs hdtv 
delivery overnormalizes the unfortunately 
rare surround effect... pretty much nothing.
Of course you would have to 1. Know anything
at all about audio encoding, and 2. Know 
anything at all about US television delivery
systems. This of course applies to CW, whos
delivery is also handled by... CBS. Anyone
who owns a real receiver that shows speaker 
channel output can easily confirm this by
by comparing individual channel info.So, why
not stop trying to justify preing stuff that
is encoded from sources that are inferior to
our actual final encodes? Or do you jsut 
need more credits for the cappers you
recruited from IMMERSE and SiTV? ( more on 
that in a future nfo :) )

What exactly have you posers contributed to
the 720p x264 section in the last 3 years?
Besides the invntion of x264 first pass 
segmenting (that you denied for 18 months
until your non secure, recruited by email, 
_____ leaked your tool and made denying it
any longer even more ludicorus)nothing at 
all. So, once again, why are you posers 
still here preing from sources that are 
inferior to other groups final encodes?

Coming up soon in an nfo near you--
A) Trip down memory lane revisiting the
continuums contributions to butchering
other sections.
B) An explantion of the morons faked rar
headers (except for the .rar which is 
patched at the end)
C) A discussion on why the tv scene is
the only section that sadly allows poorly
coded one click tools
D) A look into having said tools omit 
certain data (eg no_variable_info) and if
its truly a valid method of trying to
cheat out the no modified header info rule
As well as which groups are using said 
tool and why.
E) Rats, rats, and more rats. No one is 
safe anymore.

Enjoy ;)
