Three years in the making, and from award-winning National Geographic cinematographers, Great 
Migrations is a landmark series featuring the epic struggles of animal migrations around the planet
 and the groundbreaking science behind these life-or-death marathons.National Geographic provides 
an unparalleled look at the volume and diversity of wildlife that face countless obstacles in the name 
of self-preservation or the survival of the species--from jellyfish and wildebeests to walruses and 
monarch butterflies.
As narrated by Alec Baldwin, the unique National Geographic documentary miniseries GREAT 
MIGRATIONS undertakes an ambitious and seemingly impossible task: cinematically tracking the
 geographic relocations that many animals make perennially, to ensure the survival of their 
respective species. To capture this unusually intimate footage of animals on the move, the program 
was filmed on ice floes, in cliff binds, underwater, and in many other challenging locations. This set
contains the entire miniseries as it originally aired on television.
