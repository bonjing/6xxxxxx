Too all who like this game, remember to check out all the mods."
,StefanGavrila,2010-12-06T22:12Z,The game crashes every time I try to start a fight in the campaign. Anyone know what the problem is and if there is a fix for this?
,Gaz00,2010-12-06T23:24Z,"I have the same problem as StefanGavrila. In Galactic Conquest, moving the fleet into a battle causes a crash. Anyone have a fix?"
,Chillwind,2010-12-07T13:16Z,i have that problem too.. i hope it will be fixed soon.
,DikkatDeliVar,2010-12-10T15:32Z,"Bad RIP. Would be good to play the non ripped, WORKING version of the game."
,Chillwind,2010-12-10T17:21Z,true. i was hoping there will be a fix or something for the campaign error
,OmniNegro,2010-12-10T19:25Z,"I do not believe a non ripped version exists. That is why everyone is having problems.
I have been watching this series for a while. Quite a few of the torrents have similar issues."
,solanrix,2010-12-11T08:01Z,"i should probably mention here that you cant play the campaign without a serial number, it isnt broken it just tries to download a enemy fleet from a server whenever you start a battle, this crashes the game as it cant connect cus its not registered"
,OmniNegro,2010-12-11T14:15Z,"Lol. The only way you will see this problem and not immediately know what is going on is if you are dumb enough to run a game you downloaded off a torrent site without the simple precaution of using a firewall. 

Here is a tip for the few that can grasp simple logic: BLOCK THE FUCKING GAME WITH A FIREWALL!!!

Do not bother to play the ""Galactic"" mess. It is like multiplayer is to most shared games like this. It should never have free reign over the system or the internet.

Any questions?"
[V],alexisthebest,2010-12-14T04:38Z,"As far as i know, this is the only RIP or version for that matter.

There are many reports of crashes and not being able to play.

Hopefully everything is fixed in an updated release.

But for now, this is what you get."
,kingwolf,2011-02-12T07:01Z,hmm So should i block the GSB main exe? because i jsut tried to play the campaign and it crashes
,machimmh,2011-02-13T17:19Z,"It has nothing to do with the copy of the game, it has to do with the game itself. The campaign needs to be authorized and connected to the internet to work. I forget the reason but since this is a pirate copy it is impossible to get the campaign. They were trying to figure out a workaround on the GSB forum."
,erlik151515,2011-04-16T12:09Z,"Hi ! It says ""This application has failed to start because d3dx9_41.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.
What should I do?"
,theshed,2011-05-14T01:43Z,to get this to work first DL the demo then put the torrent files into the demo folder and run through the GSB.exe not GSDdemo replace and merge all the files and folders it asks you to do

,jvezirian,2011-05-16T22:19Z,"Ok, I installed this as ""Theshed"" suggested and installed the demo first, then directed the torrent to install into the demo game directory and, it unpacked there, it did not ask me to overwrite any files, and it launches and lets me into the game just fine. I see the mod folders, but how do you access the mods? Do you need to copy into the existing demo data folder? any help would be greatly appreciated. Get me at jsvez2010@gmail.com"
