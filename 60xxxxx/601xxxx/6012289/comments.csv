,Gsusnme,2010-12-05T02:31Z,"Edited the Torrent info several time to fix the odd characters but it's not working.

All of the information there is also in the READ ME FILE!

Enjoy the release, tested on several Win7 32 and 64 systems, as well as one XP 32 system, works just fine for me following my own instructions.

Let me know if you have any issues.

In case it is unclear, this compilation is made to be burned directly to a disc for safe keeping.
Simply run Autorun.exe if you wish to initiate setup from your PC without burning it first."
,Arrwen,2010-12-13T04:01Z,"Just letting you know, the text in your description is still extremely messed up."
,Arrwen,2010-12-14T02:22Z,"I haven't installed the second game yet, but from what I've played of the first it works perfectly. There is a Readme in the download, so you don't have to worry if you can't read the description on here.

I'm on Windows 7 and it's running great."
,element237810,2010-12-19T20:23Z,"Hi,

I'm not sure what I am doing wrong but here is what is happening when I try to install the first game. After I mount the image with Daemon tools it immediately tells me to insert play Disc 1. In the directions, it says that it should just open and I am supposed to follow the on-screen instructions from there. Help?"
,GreyHaven1,2010-12-22T05:18Z,"No problem with installation, but took me several hours to get it running. I'm running windows 7 64 bit, ATI dedicated graphics. Glitchy as HELL. Sometimes it decides to launch to the main menu, sometimes I don't get past the Lucas logo. If you reallllly want to play this one, I guess it's worth trouble. I don't fault the uploader, because I know these games do not run well on new systems. Usually takes me several attempts to get it to execute properly. If you are a noob trying to run this game, I wouldn't waste my time. I am experienced and it took a toll on my blood pressure. Gook luck."
,ieathips,2010-12-24T21:01Z,right guys i installed the second game fine but when i click play game after creating my character it just crashes aaaaah so bloody annoying please can someone help me solve this x
,GreyHaven1,2011-01-05T03:51Z,The second game works beautifully for me.
,WhosYa Daddy,2011-01-14T12:38Z,"I wanted to brush up my KOTOR knowlege, before the KOTOR mmo hit us. But I cant install the first game. I`m following the instructions, but I am allways promt to insert KOTOR disk1- play disk when I try to install the first game. Why is this? I am doing as told, and cant`t figure out this. Please respond :)"
,WhosYa Daddy,2011-01-14T13:22Z,Never mind:) I mad it work
,rh17,2011-01-22T02:18Z,Hey i am following the instructions that you are giving me and when i go to download the first game (after mounting the image) it says need the first disc. So I tried the second one I mounted the image got it downloading and at about 35% it said to insert disc 2 that contains data3.cab is there any way you can help me. Thank you
,pitbull85,2011-01-30T05:11Z,"Hey guys for everyone that gets the ""Insert Disc 1"" to simply solve this just go to the \Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic Saga - Gbus Edition folder. then run the Auto Run.exe. that should pop up the menu Gsusnme is talking about."
,endeleanx,2011-02-02T01:47Z,"At first I was a bit confused with that ""Insert Disk 1"" popup until I found out that once you have mounted the image file you just need to run the Autorun.exe in the actual ""Star Wars - Knights of the Old Republic Saga - Gbus Edition"" folder. 

Once I found that out, must say seems a pretty pro torrent. Thanks a lot!"
,pandacakes69,2011-02-11T02:18Z,"I followed the instructions to the T, (with one minor problem when I tried to copy the swkotor.exe it didn't exactly replace the old one. But I deleted the old one and used the GBus .exe) but even after I did this the game starts up, instead of bringing me the to main screen its a blank screen with the mouse then the game closes. Halp plox."
,Redriot12,2011-02-18T03:41Z,"So I am trying to install it, when it gets to the point where you choose where you want it to play from. The readme says to choose ""KOTOR2_1.ISO"" but it doesn't even let me choose that. I mounted a image to it using daemon tools. But it doesn't give me the choice. What do I do?"
,zaiger,2011-02-24T16:01Z,"Ran great on Windows 7 sp1 x64 build 7601, just finished the game last night. Will seed forever."
,rj32202,2011-02-25T05:55Z,"I did everything you said to do, including your suggested mods, for windows 7 and uniws.  It loads fine, but it crashes randomly and the main character can't move after combat.  Which brings the came to a stand still after Trask leaves."
,QueenAmnesia,2011-02-28T19:58Z,Okay i really love you if that works out for me. Since i got Vista/7 i was unable to play those games. 
,funji,2011-03-03T09:15Z,"When I'm trying to copy the razor1911 file to the install directory it says ""invalid dos funktion"". Any idea why?"
,funji,2011-03-03T09:19Z,sorry i missread the info =) ty for upload
,remainer,2011-03-17T01:57Z,"i know you would probably tell me to read the instruction, but i'd already have and i have been struggling with this for 2 days to figure it out, i'm stuck when i'm supposed to use the kotor 4 iso file i've gotten demon pro tool and i've mounted it but when i select it to where i mount in the file finder nothing pops in the name and i have tried burning it to a disc to but that doesn't help either.  up i've done everything else that you've instructed because i have a windows 7, i also use the autorun when installing on the main folder page, please i really want your help on this."
,sinodira,2011-03-26T06:07Z,"ya im really having trouble with this, im a total noob at torrenting games. i cant find the install directory to put the 7 fix in it.... the instructions dont specify exactly where or what that is"
,jackson5more,2011-03-27T04:10Z,"Install directory is normally C:/Programfiles/Lucasarts/swkotor or something similar.
I can get 2 to work, but when I try to run 1 it asks for original Disk to be inserted. Bummer ~"
,Loaded222,2011-03-30T17:09Z,"I'm having the same problem as ""remainer""  i mount KOTOR_4 ,browse the drive that i have mounted it in and nothing happens it doesn't allow me to go further. I'm i doing something wrong??"
,Fireb4se,2011-04-02T09:21Z,"I noticed some people are having trouble with the ""Insert Disk with data3.cab""

The Readme file is misleading when it says ""when the installer asks for the 'Play Disc' point it to where you mounted 'KOTOR2_1.ISO'""  That part comes later.  The Readme doesn't mention that there will be a part where you need to locate the file directory that contains data3.CAB.  To do this, choose the non-GBUS folder ""KOTOR2.""  If you were to open that folder, you'd see an archive named ""data3"" (a little bit of investigation goes a long way).  AFTER that is when you follow the Readme and point to the mounted image, when it asks for the ""Play Disc""

Hope that clears up some of the confusion.  Cheers! :]"
,Colchis,2011-04-05T07:05Z,"For those crashing on startup, immediately after the lucas arts logo, here's what I did to fix the problem.

A)  Either run swconfig and disable movies altogether, keep in mind this also disables ingame cutscenes.

OR

B)  In your movies folder (LucasArts\KOTOR\Movies) delete the following:

biologo.bik
legal.bik
leclogo.bik"
,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T02:45Z,"Gsusnme I tried to edit the ""swkotor.ini"" file but it won't let me save changes. Any suggestions?"
,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T02:51Z,I'm can't get kotor 1 to work. it always crashes no matter what I do. THIS IS F***ING ANNOYING! Can somebody please help me!?
,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T02:58Z,Gsusnme I tried everything you said but kotor 1 still crashes. i'm using vista BTW.
,masterofstealth,2011-04-06T03:13Z,Is there ny way I haven't followed ANY of these instructions? 'cause I am seriously getting nowhere with this torrent.
,thelightfang,2011-06-14T22:27Z,"I played KotOR 1 from this download after installing it as directed, and it worked very well. Now, I want to play KotOR 2, but it doesn't seem to work. I've followed all of the instructions, but it wants me to have a disc in the disc drive. I tried burning the image to a disc, but it told me that was the wrong disc. Am I doing something wrong?"
,thelightfang,2011-06-17T00:12Z,"Alright, I got past that problem. I don't think I'll have any future problems."
,thelightfang,2011-06-17T00:42Z,"Err, scratch my last comment. I created a character, watched the opening words, see the Ebon hawk nearly getting hit by astroids, and then the screen goes black. I hear a lot of noises that are the ship going haywire, and what sounds like an astromech droid's beep, but then the game crashes. What's wrong this time?"
,NiallMofo,2011-06-28T19:35Z,Won't install the update and whenever I attempt to play the game after creating a character it crashes before the scene on the ebon hawk.
,br0mantic,2011-07-11T19:13Z,"Well.
I downloaded KotOR 2 with no problems (Vista, by the way), installed the update, replaced the .dll file, and added Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1 in the .ini file, but it still keeps crashing after the intro movie.
I've disable movies and sound, and set the graphics as low as possible. Nothing's working.
I saw someone else was having the same problem, but somehow resolved it.
I'm trying everything;
Help? :c"

,thelightfang,2011-07-12T08:50Z,"Bromantic, I'm having the same problem. I'm running windows 7. I've also tried to run it in compatability modes for pretty much all other operating systems. I can't seem to find a way around this problem."
,thelightfang,2011-07-12T09:44Z,"I've been looking it up, and this is a very common problem... I just wish someone..."
,br0mantic,2011-07-18T01:46Z,"Also, I've uninstalled it andd re-installed it in compatibility mode.
Ugh. I really want to play this on PC :c"
,Fittler,2011-08-13T11:02Z,"Dont work, when i try installing nr 1 it asks for dic 4 which i mounted and point to it and yet it does nothing. "
,thelightfang,2011-08-17T02:47Z,"Okay, so I figured it  out. My graphics card wasn't up to it. 
Fittler, you probably forgot a step. It was probably the one where you replace the .exe file..."
,chrisbobis,2011-11-10T05:55Z,"Yeah I did everything that your suppose to do but I still crash on start up. Kind of annoying, I have both of these games on my old Xbox but I wanted to play with all the mods I downloaded...SIGH...oh well whatever. DELETE!"
,nervsteel,2011-11-26T22:21Z,"I installed KOTOR II and followed all the instructions written on there, however I try to run the game a by clicking on the launcher and  it says that I have the wrong disc inserted. It says that I need to insert the correct CD/DVD. What am I doing wrong? Can anyone help?"
,TheCreed,2011-12-27T08:12Z,"ok first i would like t say that i have installed both games sucsessfully.

and i am a noob at this stuff 
 dont underestimate just cause i am a noob :)
 basically what i am saying is toy with it and read the instructions to the t 

there are like 2 things you'll have to toy with cause the explo doesn't give specific instructions on a couple of things however i found out that when i toyed with it AFTER creating copies and everything (so if i fuck up i have the original file to start over with luckily i didnt have to start over)
basically if you are a complete retard you arent going to install this. use common sense (tec wise) and real sense and youll get thru it just fine

this is not the only reason why i have commented on this page tho i have a issue with this game that has really pissed me off.
i just got to the part in the first game when i am about to do my third trial and stuff. i decided i was going to try and get this thing to full screen
so naturally i ran compatibility mode for the system it works best on 98 series. when i ran the game again it said there were no saved games. i freaked out a little and looked in the saves folder in the installation of the game there was nothing there. 10 hours of game-play wasted i am pissed defiantly. not at anyone i assure you just ticked that this happened so i ask is there any way to get these files back were they migrated somewhere else?

and yes i have already tried turning compatibility mode off and checking the files again they are still not there i need help on this plz. thanks"
,TheCreed,2011-12-27T09:09Z,"Srry there is one more problem that i have that has just occurred

every time i start a new game on the second game it crashes every time after the after a long long time ago sceen i really dont want to disable the cutsceens so...is there any other way to fix this? i have installled the extra mod patches and evedrything still does it plz help  "
,TheCreed,2011-12-27T09:14Z,"ok again srry for posting so many comments in such a continuous matter but i just tried to disable movies just to see if it would work and i did it and it....still crashes i have even put in the line i was supposed to in that exe file i was instructed to.

plz help here i really want to play this game again."
,Xilar,2012-01-28T04:35Z,"I literally just made my account to tell you thank you very much for the upload. followed all your directions and got it np the first time, I've been trying to get these games working for some time and was about to give up hope, thanks again :)"
,frailwordscollapse,2012-04-06T18:10Z,"Thanks very much! I got my copy over half a decade ago, but this one doesn't seem to crash (so far).
Not that this is a serious problem, but it keeps minimizing automatically every time a movie clip plays. Any idea why that might be?
Also, is there a patch I can get for a widescreen resolution?"
,frailwordscollapse,2012-04-06T18:11Z,Oh and I'm just talking about the first one btw.
,frailwordscollapse,2012-04-23T04:58Z,"Is there no torrent of KotOR 2 that doesn't have the crashing issue with Windows 7 right after the intro?! Fuck it, I think I'll just buy the damn game."
,waging_war,2012-06-10T01:05Z,"I'm about to give up. I've downloaded half a dozen different KotOR torrents and can't seem to get any of them to work. I followed these instruction to the letter and still nothing. I'm running Vista and when I launch the game the screen goes black, a huge window(200% zoom) comes up saying ""Windows ran into a problem(or something like that)"" and the game crashes. I really want to play this game but can't figure it out. If someone has any ideas I'm all ears"
,waging_war,2012-06-10T01:45Z,"The message is, ""The program has stopped working. Windows will notify you.....blah, blah, blah""
I'm getting frustated. I know this can work but don't know what else to do."
