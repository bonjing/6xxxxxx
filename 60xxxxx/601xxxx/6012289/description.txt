THE SAGA
Knights of the Old Republic + Knights of the Old Republic II
GBUS EDITION

If you have any problems with installation make sure you have actually read these instructions and follow them to the letter, I have little patience for people who want to just skim through them, then complain. I have provided the simplest instructions possible, follow them and you will be slaying dragons in no time, or getting owned by them if you suck.

BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE READ THIS DOCUMENT IN IT'S ENTIRETY!
Failure to do so could result in NOT installing the game properly, then me ridiculing you later because you're a dumb ass.  Some of the bonus items listed below were compressed using 7-Zip, if your current extraction utility canâ€™t handle it please get 7-Zip.
In addition to the titles listed above, this release consists of:
ïƒ¼	Mini-and-Maxi Images for Kotor  1 & Kotor  2
ïƒ¼	Latest Official Patches
ïƒ¼	Recommended Community Patches / Mods


Install Knights of the Old Republic:
Press the â€œGBUSâ€ button to open a folder located on this disc, navigate to the â€œKOTORâ€ folder and mount the Mini-Image file â€œKOTOR_4.ISOâ€. Next press the button on the menu marked â€œInstall KOTOR 1â€ to launch the installation, follow all on-screen instructions, when the installer asks for Disc 4 point it to where you mounted â€œKOTOR_4.ISOâ€ and complete the installation. Once installation is complete you may safely dismount â€œKOTOR_4.ISOâ€. 
After setup has been completed, click the â€œInstall 1.03 Updateâ€ button beneath the â€œInstall KOTOR 1â€ button and follow all on-screen instructions; once the update has completed copy the â€œswkotor.exeâ€ into the Install Directory and overwrite the existing file.
NOTE: If you are running Windows Vista or 7 you will need to copy the files inside the â€œkotor1-2_vista-w7_fixed_dll.rarâ€ in the â€œGBUSâ€ directory, into your install directory overwriting any existing files. This is a .dll fix to help with crashing issues.
Install Knights of the Old Republic II:
Press the â€œGBUSâ€ button to open a folder located on this disc, navigate to the â€œKOTOR2â€ folder and mount the Maxi-Image file â€œKOTOR2_1.ISOâ€, if a launcher opens simply close it. Next press the button on the menu marked â€œInstall KOTOR 2â€ to launch the installation, follow all on-screen instructions, when the installer asks for the â€œPlay Discâ€ point it to where you mounted â€œKOTOR2_1.ISOâ€ and complete the installation. Once installation is complete you may safely dismount â€œKOTOR2_1.ISOâ€.
After setup has been completed, click the â€œInstall 2.1 Updateâ€ button beneath the â€œInstall KOTOR 2â€ button and follow all on-screen instructions; once the update has completed copy the â€œswkotor2.exeâ€ into the Install Directory and overwrite the existing file.
If you wish to have high res sounds and movies, copy the folders â€œMoviesâ€ & â€œStreamMusicâ€ from the â€œGBUS\KOTOR2â€ directory, into your install directory overwriting all files.
This is completely optional and will NOT effect gameplay.
NOTE: If you are running Windows Vista or 7 you will need to copy the files inside the â€œkotor1-2_vista-w7_fixed_dll.rarâ€ in the â€œGBUSâ€ directory, into your install directory overwriting any existing files. This is a .dll fix to help with crashing issues.
NOTE 2: If you are experiencing random crash issues, editing the .ini file for each game (located in the install directory, â€œswkotor.iniâ€ for the first game, and â€œswkotor2.iniâ€ for the second) and adding the line:
Disable Vertex Buffer Objects=1
Under the â€œ[Graphics Options]â€ header has been proven to fix the issue for MOST people.
