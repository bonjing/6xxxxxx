Note:
I have taken liberties with the frame rate.  It is supposed to be 29.97 (30000/1001) however that doesn't play on Apple TV v1 at 720p so I have reduced it 23.976 (24000/1001) to enable playback on Apple TV v1.  As a result of the modification the frame rate isn't as smooth as it should be.  I can up the correct FPS version if someone wants it badly enough (It does play on Apple TV v2).
