Thank you very much! I'm truly honored! I won't disappoint TPB.

@Dudogger:
Aaahhhh Dudogger: you've found me!
Yes, off course, but since I'm having problems with my uploads on the other site (which I won't mention), people have to find me elsewhere. But be patient, the .ISO will follow soon. (I think tomorrow or Monday at the latest). 
Enjoy the documentary to all of you!"
