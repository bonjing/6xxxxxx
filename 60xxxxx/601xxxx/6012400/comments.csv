Your uploads have truly helped me during my undergrad courses. I don't know how to even thank you for all your resourceful uploads pertaining to Adobe's Creative Suite.

I really don't know how I could ever thank you for taking the time out and doing this for others. Seriously, I needed these programs to complete my school work and even with the discount Adobe gives for students, I couldn't afford the cost. Thanks to you, and the programs and learning modules you've uploaded, I've completed my undergrad and now I'm in grad school, still using the Adobe CS4 suite I downloaded from you about a year ago.

Thank you for all that you do and if there is anything I could do for you... I certainly would.

Thank you once again...
