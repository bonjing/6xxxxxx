a collection of 4 recordings from 2 cassettes (my rips) by one of my favourite hindustani classical vocalists, the late Mallikarjun Mansur.

Raga Shivmat Bhairavi (with the very odd use of "L" as a vowel.)
Raga Bahaduri Todi
Raga Gaud Malhar
Raga Sawani

VB-MP3

The audio quality may not be as good as CD-rips but i thought it would be better to rip the cassettes from my collection before they disintegrated and i feel these recordings are rare and interesting enough to share.
