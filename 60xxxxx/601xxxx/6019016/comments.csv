MKV is definitely best,but subtitles  (even in English) would be good too.
Thanks anyway."

There are a few F.A.R.T. versions to fix replaced music playing on radios and other situations, but only in three episodes. Those will be coming soon. The Barry Morse introductions will be seeded separately for the episodes where they exist. "
[T],rkimble,2010-12-08T18:04Z,"The three F.A.R.T. editions (episodes 1, 2, and 4) for season four are now seeding. I also uploaded a separate torrent of the five Barry Morse introductions he recorded for shows in this set. Feel free to include the Barry Morse introduction in your torrents of episodes 5, 10, 12, and 15. "

However, if you can afford to, both formats will be welcome (and with subtitles will be a bonus!). BTW....many thanks for these mkv's so far (And to you too, rkimble, for the Demonoid ones)."
