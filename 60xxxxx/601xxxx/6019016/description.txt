The Fugitive.S04E06.Joshua's Kingdom.DVDRip.x264


Sorry for the one-day delay... here's what you were waiting for!

Seeding will begin in about half a day, as usual!

Enjoy!

And don't forget to seed after finishing!



P.S. Yesterday, I was able to obtain the usual DVD-Rips fresh from the usenet (The Fugitive S04E01-E15 DVDRip by OSiTV). The files are slightly smaller (349 MB), but they are in the avi format and have english subtitles. 

BUT: Quality of the mkv-files is better, though (a somewhat sharper picture)!

There may be people who prefer the avi format, though, so my question: 

Is there any interest to switch completely to the avi format (I would start again with episode 4.1, of course!), or do you prefer the mkv format? I would even consider to upload both, depending on your feedback.

I will wait until the end of the week to see what format gets your preference!
