[V],neon,2010-12-05T10:39Z,@washingmachine....course its a re-encode....source is in the info ...f***ing idiot
,Rapier_Wit,2010-12-05T11:34Z,Thanks neonrainbow for sorting this into a format we can use. Over-sized mkv files are no good to me.

,go5ui,2010-12-09T05:35Z,"definitely a bad transcode job on this.  motion stutters during certain scenes, like it's a framesync issue. "
,ro4eva,2010-12-12T19:37Z,^ What he/she said.  The film's framerate stutters at certain points.  Most likely the source file was transcoded at a different framerate (e.g. 23.976->24).
,ro4eva,2010-12-12T21:30Z,Thanks for the upload though.  I got a chance to watch this film.  I enjoyed it as much as I did Public Enemies.  These 2 films are my favorite money/bank heist since Heat I'd say.
