incl subs? Good job!
Also impressive upload history!
Guess I'll leave 720p TV shows to you then ;)...

keep up the good work!
Cheers!"
,Thonybhoy,2010-12-12T15:19Z,"Yo dude, thanks for the upload but do you have any idea why it aint working properly with my VLC player ???"
,dsorc,2010-12-23T00:06Z,"Subs are a mess. First one is French and some of the others are for the hearing impaired or unsynced.
Other than that, no complaints. Video quality is HDish, maybe an 8."
,BrokenEmpires,2011-01-14T12:58Z,"whats amc? LMAO 
who the fuck still watching television
this the billionth time I find a NEW show and become a fan without ever hearing about it outside of the internet. hahaha"
,lilgruber,2011-02-05T22:46Z,"Fast download, good show. :)

Quality is kind of ""meh"", though."
,funky89,2011-02-17T19:45Z,"by the sixth episode, the video quality really took a turn for the worse. not sure whats up there."
,builder1369,2011-02-24T00:43Z,"heads up...got a notice about this from Comcast today.

Notice of Claim of Copyright Infringement   never got one of these before"
,indyaries,2011-03-04T23:13Z,"Yeah, I've also received a notice.

Looks like PeerBlock isn't working.  Happy Fraking Days, huh ??"
,NordEast,2011-03-15T07:48Z,"I have never once received a notice from any ISP I've been with and I've been downloading shit for more than a decade. Whatever you are doing, you are doing it wrong. Perhaps stop sucking up so much bandwidth every month."
,GoreDaddy,2011-03-26T05:27Z,"Great series and decent quality!!! Spent last night watching, have just one episode left. Thank You!!!"
,snoww01,2011-09-21T07:02Z,TY! very good quality. Took me a whole week to download. But great sound and video. Thanx again! 
,pibe156,2011-09-21T21:01Z,please guys SEEEED!!!
,mordasz,2011-10-05T16:39Z,It's missing subtitles for episode 6
,Emalkay,2011-10-19T23:18Z,@BrokenEmpires if you ever tried watching this show on amc you'd know what it is. Also would know that its stands for either (Another Motherfucking Commercial) or (A lot More Commercials)
,jori24,2011-10-20T21:07Z,SEED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Prawps,2011-10-22T19:52Z,the .srt are showing French on my side. Not sure about anyone else... :(
,FifeeBoy,2011-10-25T20:13Z,i hope you'll be uploading season 2 in its 720p glory
,Gurrangoo,2011-10-28T00:34Z,"The quality is kinda bad actually, but the show is great!"
,katriza,2011-11-01T04:02Z,"For a 720p release I think the Video quality should be better... 
Thanks for the upload, quick downloading only 4/5 hours in a 10Mb net. Works like a charm in VLC 1.1.11.

A: 7/10
V: 6/10"
,guerrillapirate,2011-11-22T04:29Z,"@everyone who gets notices for copyright infringement from Comcast

Use PeerBlock. It's free with loads of free block lists that are updated daily. I've received 2 notices during my pre-peerblock days, but not anymore. Also, those notices are often used as a scare tactic and don't pose any real threat in most cases. I've also heard rumors about some of the notices actually being fake, produced by corporations or snitches on University or campus networks, trying to scare you away but don't quote me on that."
,funn1e,2011-12-07T02:55Z,I can't wait to see this series in 6 weeks
,Flex71,2012-01-01T21:52Z,"@NordEast,
Well now, lucky you. I too had been downloading torrents for over a decade without any problems. But then I suddenly get dozens of emails from my isp about copyright infringement. Here is the deal, PeerGuardian2 no longer works and PeerBlock (the recommended replacement) is a total failure. PeerBlock doesn't seem to do what its suppose to, so its basically useless. Proxies can be slow and/or expensive, so there is now little to no protection for p2p users anymore. Internet privacy is becoming a thing of the past, today anyone could be watching you!"
,davejoy2,2012-02-07T22:47Z,Thank you for sharing :)
,MoviesR101,2012-02-12T09:41Z,Thanks!
,jbone92627,2012-03-15T01:23Z,I agree with katriza from below. I don't believe this to be 720p quality. Should look a loooooot better. But will be watching this regardless.
,Hairy44,2012-03-20T02:07Z,"hi, when are you going to upload a walking dead 1-13 full season 2 with subtitles in hd just like this? Thanks!"
,Arosha,2012-03-26T00:27Z,"A:10
V:6

not even close to HD quality. also Subs are poor. Encodes are bad in the last Episode.

AVOID AVOID AVOID this download. Good as a DVDRip not for the HD Quality."
,comedylover22,2012-06-24T07:14Z,PERFECT
,fakevibe,2012-06-30T18:02Z,"In a first fast watch, episode 4 is at bad quality... I'll see all the episodes and post my impressions later, but this torrent just started with the wrong foot. :/"
