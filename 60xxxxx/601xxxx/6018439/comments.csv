,MongKP,2012-01-06T00:24Z,"What is this? Just high resolution but low definition. And audio quality really bad. I know that because I have a DVD of this movie. Some of your work is really good but some like this one. It explains itself why size of the file is so small, doesn't it?"
,rschrake,2012-05-09T18:27Z,"Horrible copy. It gets choppy & the audio is sped up in parts. No, its not my pc or converter. I use them both multiple times a day for other movies, tv shows, etc. I have yet to find ONE mkv file that YIFY does that converts and can make it on the PS3 or any mp4 files. :("
