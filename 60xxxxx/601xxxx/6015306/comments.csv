I saw DS original afternoon broadcasts when I was in grade school. Your ul's have better video and sound than then.
Really appreciate your keeping the seed going, folks: Let's not let this fine work die!
Cheers!"

,barda24,2011-08-08T13:33Z,"Okay, this is way before my time and I'm a big stranger to the soap opera concept, but it was recommended to me so here I am. Just a quick thing I want to know; the first episode is strongly narrated, and what I want to know is if it is always like that or was the first episode for background knowledge?"
,seVen-kun,2011-08-14T10:48Z,"@ barda24, it was a recap of the first 209 episodes. The show is not narrated. You are all very welcome for these, I'm just glad to be passing on the happiness that this show has brought into my life to you"
,sasblack,2012-04-30T11:28Z,I am so confused... Which one is the first episode?
,liviawilde,2012-05-11T21:05Z,Does anyone know where to find those first 209 episodes? Because i've succeded to see the 36 first episodes and would like to continue from there...
,Rock_King22,2012-05-13T16:05Z,"@ liviawild: The fifth and final part will be ""the Beginning"" collection, pre-Barnabas. This torrent collects DVD sets 1-7."
,Rock_King22,2012-05-13T16:06Z,"Thank you seVen-kun for this upload.
Too bad the new Dark Shadows movie looks like crap. Tim Burton & Johnny Depp turned it into a mockery."
