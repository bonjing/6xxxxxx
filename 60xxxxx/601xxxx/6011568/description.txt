HQ promo music video. "Since You Been Gone" is a 1970s rock song written and recorded by former Argent guitarist Russ Ballard for his 1976 album Winning. It has also been recorded by numerous other artists, including all-girl group Clout, Cherie Currie and Head East. The most famous version is this 1979 cover by Rainbow which became a UK top ten single. A house version of the song was released in 2006 by German trio Master Blaster, which has featured on several compilations. The song has often been misspelled as "Since You've Been Gone".

Besides the pounding 'pub rock' delivery, the Rainbow version is famous for a grunt/groan from the lead singer, Graham Bonnet, followed by a key-change preceding the final reprise of the chorus. A bootleg version of this track in a country and western style is available from Blackmore's Night.

The Rainbow version was named the 82nd best hard rock song of all time by VH1.
