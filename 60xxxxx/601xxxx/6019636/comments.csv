,Pietje013,2010-12-08T22:16Z,"If you needed a key then buy Windows 
people should be happy others are willing to upload the dvd so you can restore windows anytime"
,chewster9,2010-12-08T22:56Z,"Yup, I'm the uploader, just warning everyone this is just the installation disc. I created this torrent mainly to send the ISO to a friend."
,KrimzunWulf,2010-12-11T08:49Z,"Thanks, this is helpful 'cause I lost my Install CD, but I still have my product key that I haven't used yet. When we got this computer it had a two-way install CD, XP and 7 Pro. Guess I should have gone with 7 from the start, would have saved a lot of trouble. Thanks again!"
