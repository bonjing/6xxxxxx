Description: 

Players take control of an air traffic controller for an airport. The airport features a runway for large red jets, a runway for small yellow planes and a helipad for blue helicopters. Players draw paths along the touchscreen to point each air vehicle to its designated landing zone. Each landed aircraft scores the player one point and as the playerâ€™s score increases, more aircraft appear on the screen at once, increasing the gameâ€™s difficulty. The game ends when two or more aircraft collide.
