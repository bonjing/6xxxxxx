-Foundry Keylight
-Synthetic Aperture Color Finesse
-fnord ProEXR 
-Digieffects FreeForm
-Cycore FX (CC)
-Imagineer mocha shape AE

I have tried to find them... but it seems the only thing uploaded are old variations."
,Tram8yn,2011-07-04T06:46Z,I cant get these plugins to work.  Only the Camera Mapper 
,Tram8yn,2011-07-04T06:48Z,all the files in the Red Giant folder are some apr files.. thats not for after effects is it? if so where do you put those.. because they are not for  the effects or presets or plugins
