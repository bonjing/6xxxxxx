,ebthnew,2010-12-10T23:54Z,trying to be patient but would also LOVE episode 2...
,ibleet,2010-12-11T08:18Z,"I admit that I get impatient, but the show aired 3 days ago. Most ups are within minutes of the show airing. I wonder why its different with this show?"
,cdtcaptn,2010-12-11T23:02Z,"Thanks for this episode.

I don't suppose if you have episode 2, as the 3rd episode airs in 2 days.

Thanks again for this episode.  Well done"

,thadream101,2010-12-13T06:32Z,have scoured the internet using all 16 torrent sites i have saved in my bookmarks and at least 10 torrent search engines including toorgle which searches over 250 torrent sites and there is no episode 2 torrent on the net...and it is not on youtube to be able to download it from there.... only option i found it to watch it on hulu....or nbc.com
