,Lazy-O,2011-07-15T21:53Z,Dog fight isn't so cruel as it seems to. More cruel is UFC fights. wolves fights too in wild it is normal to them. They are not children they are cruel animals and they even kills for food just like human. I dont say that it is ok to make dogs to fight but it is ok when they fight and they separate the dogs when one of the dogs lose and gives up. 
,crowb14,2011-07-19T01:17Z,i do not like dog fighting i dont know why i clicked this but i should say fuck you mother fucker i hope u die for uploading this

,ninjatakedown,2011-08-21T14:39Z,"If you actually think this is what to do with an animal i'll fucking bite your throat out if i meet you.
I'm dead serious."
,ninjatakedown,2011-08-21T14:41Z,Notice the sever lack of intelligence in the people that advocate this behaviour.
,thata2224,2011-12-14T10:05Z,yup i agree. more cruel is UFC. dogs is a nature to fight. in our place dogs here have their own territory. when other dogs go to their territory there fighting each other. so watch the cruel?
