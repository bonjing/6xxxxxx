However, I encourage you to try putting this movie onto a dvd5.  For me, I hate buying dbl-layer discs, so I do my best to get max video quality on a dvd5.  If i had unlimited bandwidth, i would have kept on ULing untouched dvds, but this is the best compromise i could come up with.  With this movie, if you choose your language and eliminate the other audio and subtitle tracks, you can get the video quality up past 95% in dvdshrink, which is virtually indistinguishable from the original disc, even on my HDTV.  The extra few percent aren't worth the added expense for DL discs.  At least give it a shot, dvd-r's are super cheap after all.  Hope you enjoy, let me know how it turns out."
,jackalope77,2010-12-05T21:52Z,"@trin02:  Oh i see your point, if you collect them on DL-discs then obviously you dont mind downloading the extra content.  Unfortunately it takes me so long to upload stuff that any time I can save is worth it.

Man, i dont know how you can afford to back up everything on dual-layer though, you must have a good source of inexpensive discs. (What brand do you use, by the way.)  For me though, I have several thousand movies backed up in dvd5, backing them all up in dvd9 as well would have cost a fortune.  Everybody has their own preference of course but i think im going to have to start backing up stuff on external hard drives myself soon."
,jackalope77,2010-12-08T08:43Z,"@trin02: Yes that is a pretty rocking idea, i may have to look into that to see if i can make some custom dvds of my own.

I guess my only point though with regard to the dvd-DL thing is that, when you download this torrent with everything but the movie stripped off, you can fit everything onto a dvd5 just by removing the audio you dont need and applying a little compression.  Compared to a dvd9, the difference woudl be negligible (which is my goal) so why waste a more expensive disc.  In my last upload, for example, the whole movie was less than 4gbs.  Obviously no need to burn a dvd9 for that, but this release is the same once you discard unwanted audio streams.  Thats all im getting at, its fine to use dvd-dl when necessary, but im trying to make it so people dont have to, as much as i can."
,jackalope77,2010-12-11T20:09Z,"@trin02: I am glad you enjoyed it, like i said it is my 2nd fave movie ever.  Sadly not many people have heard of it.

I did know you can do that with poweriso, its a good solution if you just cant wait to see the movie, lol.  You can also open the files within mkv player, as another option.  See you at the next upload!"
