My Sumvision Exposure MKV2 Enclosure media player can't recognise the picture and only plays the sound which does display as dts ES 6.1 

Shame..."

download ""mkvtoolnix 4.5.0"" free software.

Add file using tab on right.
Save downloaded file again using ""start muxing"" tab at the bottom BUT select the video MPEG4 in the middle box then select the 3rd tab along below  ""extra options"" - set the compression option drop down menu to NONE - (blank is not good enough)  

Hey presto video now plays :-)"
