,dax15,2010-12-11T15:55Z,As a downloader that lives in a country that has no unlimited broadband to purchase and TV shows such as this that are a season behind may I say there are no better santas than mr torrentzone.....hohohohoho
,rocco_sifredi,2010-12-17T03:59Z,thx chap!
,GERMS123,2011-01-01T12:04Z,HI. isit fair to say that the quality of your dexter uploads are very poor and glitchy. the frame rate occasionaly pauses for split seconds and occasionally is very glitchy.... its not a fault at my end. its every DEXTER episode i download off you. is any one else experiencing this problem. i have no problem with the quality when i download it from eztv.. please reply.... because i thin you should take these torrents down. they annoy me and interupt my viewing 
,farty,2011-12-12T08:35Z,"THIS IS NOT S05E11 this is ""Hop aFreighter""
The uploader is a total w@nker."
