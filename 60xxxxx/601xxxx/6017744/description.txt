This is an edited version of this torrent: 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5946152/The.Colbert.Report.2010.11.09.Cee-Lo.Green.HDTV.XviD-FQM.%5BVTV%5D.a

This contains only Cee-Lo's performance of "Forget You" from the end of the show.  I made this video for myself since I like this particular performance (mostly because hot chicks playing guitars are awesome lol), but I thought I'd upload it in case anyone else wanted a copy and didn't want to edit the video themselves.  Credit of course goes to VTV for the original torrent, I couldn't live without that guy's uploads.  Enjoy!
