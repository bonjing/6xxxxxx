Within the downloaded torrent file is the complete discography of the band 'Pierce The Veil'

A band originally from San Diego, California.

All of the songs are RIPPED from the album and converted by me, MrOpti. The current uploader.

I was sick of not seeing the two albums on here in MP3 format, so I have decided to upload both of them, each with the bonus song, to ThePirateBay.org

If you have any questions, comments, requests or anything else, please post below in the comment box. I am hoping to see what people think.

This band is very hard to get used to, in my opinion. If you do not like a lead singer that sounds like a whiny bitch, do not download or comment. Anyway, thanks guys. Please seed. etc etc.
