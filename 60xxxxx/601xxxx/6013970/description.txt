Comments :
Peter Parker has finally managed to piece together the once-broken parts of 
his life, maintaining a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane and 
his responsibility as Spider-Man. But more challenges arise for our young hero. 
Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against Peter; taking 
up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must 
also capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed into 
his toughest foe yet, the Sandman. All hope seems lost when suddenly Peter's suit 
turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his powers. But it also begins to greatly 
amplify the much darker qualities of Peter's personality that he begins to lose 
himself to. Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero 
he used to be if he is to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his 
greatest enemies, but also...himself.
