Albert Campion is home on leave after three years of wartime intelligence work overseas. His only thought is to get to his house in the country and his wife, Lady Amanda. How can his manservant Lugg have been so inconsiderate as to deposit a dead body in his London flat? Reluctantly, Campion is drawn into the intrigues of Lord Carados' eccentric household - none of them quite as eccentric as his Lordship's formidable mother. He must deal with murder, treason and grand larceny before he can can go home, and even then his troubles are not over.
