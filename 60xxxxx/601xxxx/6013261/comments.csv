,devlspawn,2010-12-08T04:13Z,"the registration no longer works.  The problem is you can't disable ""check for updates"" before it is registered because the trial version will not save settings.  But if you put the registration code in registry it will say invalid and only give the option to order or exit."
,elektronik_supersonik,2010-12-08T10:57Z,"Yup, I'll second that. Maybe it's phoning home even with updates turned off?"

lifetime support ends 12/31 btw.
Hard to say how long blu-rays will be around but for $115.00 USD its still worth it.

,doctor2cardio,2010-12-12T18:53Z,What I always do is to disconnect from internet during installation ...apply the key and then disable the automatic updates... i have also NIS to block anydvd from inernet access..... Just try it the rest of oyu...or unistall and try again...
