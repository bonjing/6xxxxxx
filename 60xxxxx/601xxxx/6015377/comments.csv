,Phrostie,2010-12-06T08:11Z,can we get some confirmations of quality?
,Orchonic,2010-12-06T08:28Z,"the uploader is EZTV, you are a noob to doubt his rips...  do you even know what the skulls are?"
,thewolfen,2010-12-06T08:57Z,"I've never had a bad torrent from EZTV.  In fact, without EZTV I probably wouldn't even use torrents for this type of file."
,j0ket,2010-12-06T09:21Z,Phrostie: Lol 720p Is = 720 HD 
,ZR145,2010-12-06T10:07Z,Are there issues with the quality the one i have is fuzzy off and on
,Darkfall666,2010-12-06T11:24Z,"3 words: Worst. Encode. Ever.

Video quality is terrible on this. Hopefully someone propers this release."
,Arch4ng3l,2010-12-06T12:05Z,"I have to agree, first time with eztv rip, but its all fuzzy and shit, still watchable tho"
,mbisdagame1,2010-12-06T13:49Z,Can anyone confirm that the this rip is shit? Possibly someone with a skull
,nitrus0x,2010-12-06T14:00Z,"you're better off getting the xvid this week
don't know if it was AMC's broadcast problems or IMMERSE's shitty settings, and there's been no repack or proper yet so bummer for the HD fans (unless you get the web.dl version)"

Sorry I don't have a skull but I can provide you with a screenshot (though I can't verify it's exactly this upload, but why would I do so much trouble for nothing).

I can capture the image from the upload with the player, and I'll just post another screen from my desktop (but the clip is cut out since that isn't captured with screencap). You'll just have to believe me that the image of the upload belongs to the screencap.

I don't want to ruin this upload because I also expected great quality (like the other uploads), but I'm sorry to say that you're probably better off with the XviD version like Nitrus0x said, since it has the same quality but then without the fuzzy moments in it."
,XxCracxX,2010-12-06T15:56Z,But there is a reason to boubt this one cause the image was really blurry and it wasnt well rendered!
,koentjuh,2010-12-06T18:22Z,"haha yeah well, you can also just download it and see for yourself, I'm just trying to warn people that there really is something wrong, despite the continuous great quality of EzTv uploads ;)"
,mitter,2010-12-06T19:40Z,"my weekly fix of EZ!

Thanls a bunch once again!"
,5493dylan,2010-12-06T20:14Z,thank you again your rips are surpreme
,suiorgou,2010-12-06T22:45Z,"I also don't have a skull, but I can confirm the quality of the encode for this particular episode is sub-par compared to the ones by CTU for earlier episodes.  This isn't really eztv's fault, and I greatly appreciate his efforts in sharing this and all, but the screen caps he provided definitely don't match the video."
,mbisdagame1,2010-12-06T23:00Z,"@koentjuh

Thanks for the effort m8, guess I will just dl the smaller one, at least the 720p rips of my other 2 shows boardwalk empire and dexter are spot on!"
,jbwzrd213,2010-12-07T06:39Z,"Don't download this version.
Instead, search for this:

The.Walking.Dead.S01E06.PROPER.720p.HDTV.x264-2HD"
,magoo73,2010-12-08T22:24Z,"EZTV is the best uploader, but unfortunately this one is not good.  I've checked other torrents and I'll try the one from Tv Team (Proper). "
,slywrp,2010-12-10T15:21Z,nuke this
,the_nr1-n00b,2011-01-30T23:21Z,"BEST SHOW EVER!!! GO BUY THE DVDs/BluRay when coming! =D I Know I WILL :D:D:D:D:D

Thanks for the upload, very good quallity both sound and video!
but still, if people like this, then buy it! And it will keep coming ;)"
,ej33t,2011-04-23T21:19Z,Just a heads up for anyone downloading this. You'll find that this particular epiode from eztv is quite bad quality. Episodes 1-5 from eztv are good.
,7-Phoenix,2011-10-27T20:25Z,"This is the ONLY eztv upload that actually sucks.
The video quality is poor.
You guys should try another 720p video"
