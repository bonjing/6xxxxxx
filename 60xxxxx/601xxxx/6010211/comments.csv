,zdude555,2010-12-05T12:45Z,"Wrong Cropping. Black bars are visible.
Size is good for a quick viewing but since this is an animation flick, the quality-loss is consistenly visible. Blu-ray wud be exciting."
,Squiglet,2010-12-05T15:08Z,I downloaded this exact version and I'll have to say it is damned good quality. The best out there so far. Of course a BluRay version would be better...and for that version we just have to wait!!! Thanks for this upload!
