Any suggestions?"
,WENKERBOY,2010-12-12T21:30Z,Try TsMuxer and 'demux'.
,Monkey112233,2010-12-15T04:48Z,Did this work for anyone??
,1mehyam,2010-12-16T20:23Z,"Just a big ISO, cant open w/ ISO majic and other iso readers. Tried renaming file ... no luck.
Is this valid or should we delete. "

,lxuethc,2010-12-23T08:18Z,Just drag it into VLC player. VLC player can read ISO
,Monkey112233,2010-12-23T22:05Z,There is nothing inside the file!
,losmed33,2010-12-30T17:52Z,"anybody figured out a program that runs this or is it just not valid? If it is, it was a big waste downloading this huge file because it dont work for me at all"
,Kagemusha9,2010-12-30T18:31Z,"USELESS! 16 gigabytes of shit! Somebody delete the torrent, please!"
,Ugotit3,2011-01-01T17:51Z,Did anyone try daemon tools?
,Krishin,2011-01-04T04:24Z,"Verified and indeed working using Virtual Clone Drive by Sly Soft BUT the ISO is still in Blu-ray format like the description states thus you will need a BD-ROM, BD-RE drive on your rig so the virtual drive can utilize it's drivers for a successful mount. On another note... nice work, aol! Greatly appreciated! KUTGreatW! "
,sabretooth1,2011-01-07T15:53Z,"Verdict is: 
You CAN mount with Daemon. However K-lite DID NOT play it for me. 
VLC DID work. With issues however.
And its only 44min long. 
Thank you for upload. It does work. So Leechers you can make your own choice."
,sevlahov,2011-01-11T15:35Z,"This is full hd 3d documetary.
I am whaching it from ext hd on 3d tv & it is working fine.
To wach it you have to rip it to side by side format
Most of the video is CG"
,UKTUSA,2011-01-12T04:54Z,have you tried winrar n extract it
,Ugotit3,2011-01-13T16:16Z,"Download and install Daemon tools.

Download and install Power DVD.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5602727/Cyberlink_Power_DVD_v10.0.1714.51_Ultra_Multilang_%28x32-x64%29

Connect an HDMI cable from your computer to your 3D TV/Monitor.

Mount the iSO in Daemon Tools.

Open your virtual drive from Power DVD

Enjoy!

(Please don't say stuff is crap unless you know what your talking about!)"
,redbulltp,2011-01-13T17:56Z,"Just throw it on and external harddrive or usb, then plug it into your 3D tv, it working just great then ;)"
,cheatsforme,2011-01-14T06:32Z,This is not in fucking 3D so dont waste youre bandwidth for a 45 minute documentry
,cheatsforme,2011-01-14T20:29Z,"oops my bad, i do apologize. I had the wrong version of power dvd.
It does work and it is 3d but still 15gb for a 45 min docu :s"
,johnnymrk2000,2011-01-21T16:28Z,"it works, just mount files with virtual clone drive, open cyberlinkpower dvd 10 and play the blu ray disk"
,iridis_alpha,2011-02-09T17:35Z,"I mounted the ISO ok (dameon tools didnt like it but MagicDisc did) and the bluray files are there, but PowerDVD 10 and WinDVD 2010 both said unrecognised format. Im on windows 7 64bit .. any ideas ?"
,iridis_alpha,2011-02-10T15:58Z,"ok I got it working, it has to be mounted with virtual clonedrive and watched with powerDVD 10. (no other virtual drives worked for me & I tried daemon, alcohol 120% and magic disk)

Also this contains both 2D and 3D versions, and as I havent got a 3D TV you can still watch it in the old red & cyan 3D glasses method, and it still looks excellent. 

massive respect to the uploader, this is a trip!
