Tdsk is only a trailers disk, its meant for you to watch on your nice big screen that you haven\'t got a computer linked to, or give to your friends when you borrow them your films to wet there apatite. If somehow you thought there is 15 HD films on a DVD then quit the 
internet its not for you.

Tdsk is made for fun, nothing more nothing less. If you like great if u don\'t what u lost.

Tdsk always looks better on a HD tv with a bluray or HD media device.

Changes made on this release:

New Intro made, last was left in by mistake and was take off my youtube chan hence the bad quality
Menu remade and more compressed, << this has nothing to do with loosing the files honist
Credits roll added, this very basic as it dont need be fancy and heavly compressed
Got a bit more orginised for next release if it happens
