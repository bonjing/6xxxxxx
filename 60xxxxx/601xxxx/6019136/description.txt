This collection of dirty jokes, short fiction, and autobiographical tidbits will please some readers and offend others. Carey, a stand-up comic and star of his own TV show, writes mostly about sex, drinking, gambling, football, and television. One of his favorite topics seems to be his "big ~censored~" jokes. Four-letter words predominate, giving the book a definite adolescent, male tone. Carey points out that the raunchier his material, the more popular he became, seeming almost surprised at the public's reaction. To his credit, he also includes a sampling of the negative reviews and letters he has received. The short stories are the most interesting. Carey reads with the familiarity and conviction of one reading his own work..
