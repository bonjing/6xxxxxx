,DSIN,2010-12-04T10:27Z,"There's something wrong wid the title but i can't quite put my finger on it LOL.. just kidding...
thanx for the movie
& please post some more latest scOrp rips like ""enter the void"" & ""babysitters"" in between ur uploads :D
ty again ...& keep up the good work ;)"
,smasudi,2010-12-04T11:57Z,please upload enter the void from 300mb united
[T],gunnersrock,2010-12-04T14:07Z,"@DSIN and smasudi

Will upload ""enter the void"" after lotr3  but no to ""the babysitters""

PS - I thought that i named the torrent incorrectly but it seems it's got to do something with the site because it's still incorrect even after i renamed it correctly 

@mzk57

Yep i agree with you completely and to add to that these are extended editions "
,smasudi,2010-12-04T14:25Z,thanks buddy....also if possible try to upload bollywood blockbusters of your choice..
,DSIN,2010-12-04T14:33Z,"@mzk : i personally think LOTR is very overrated...  but it does appeals to the fans of the genre..
i don't agree wid u on 2hr thing though cuz ppl (as far as i know) can watch any movie(no matter the length) as long as the plot is full of surprises :D

p.s : i'm watchin seven samurai (again) & its 3 hrs & 26 mins :D"
,DSIN,2010-12-04T14:35Z,"@gunnersrock : no problem dude... 
i'm not interested in that movie(babysitters) anyways .. LOL
i was asking in the sense  that some scOrp's rips will be good in between :D
enter the void is superb choice though ;)
ty"

,nikko1,2010-12-04T17:05Z,"Magnolia is a great, Great, movie."
,DSIN,2010-12-04T18:55Z,"@mzk : cmmon man its a matter of opinions.. 
i've not seen magnolia (nor will i ever see) cuz 1. i don't watch a movie for any actor/actress & 2. its clearly not my type 
but many ppl prefer these kinda movies which is purely character driven.. 
so bottomline : just cuz u don't like a movie doesn't make it bad ... 
& most of the lengthy movies i've watched were all good-great..
(i only watch those plots which i find interesting)
:D"

,Alien_Hunter,2011-12-02T18:27Z,"Audio 64kbps ?! Why?

Nice video resolution, but sound man?!? 
To fully enjoy in the movie you have to have good sound quality, and this one is bad!

NOT WORTH OF BANDWIDTH!!!"
