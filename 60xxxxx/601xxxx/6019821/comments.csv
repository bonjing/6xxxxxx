Keep seeding the biggest one instead.

But...

From what I see, what has to be done is to release the key/password to the ""insurance"" file so people could start working on the information.

Tell you this:

THERE EXISTS NO INSURANCE OF ANY KIND.

ALL the governments on this planet, all the judges that could decide anything any way you cut it, the European Parliament, which is nothing more than a puppet theater in the NWO agenda, and everything of ANY significance is under total control of either ""The Committee of 300"" and ""Club of Rome"" and Chabad Lubavitch.

And if you know what it means, you will understand there is no limit to their viciousness, evilness and all pervading power AROUND THE GLOBE.

NONE.

Do you understand?

You can not hide from them, no matter where you are or what kind of ""guarantees"" ANY ""government"" is going to give you. Because they are all but puppets.

So...

I suggest to release the key/password ASAP.
There is simply no point for this ""insurance"".
It isn't going to help ANYTHING or anybody.
In fact, it is going to hurt more than it is going to help.

And so I claim, unless the key/password and exact instructions on how to extract the information and format it in a humanly readable form is released, I consider this whole WikiLeaks effort a disinformation scam, just to buy more time, and with the amount of information we are seeing already, that time could be YEARS.

Clear enough?"

,bluecar5556,2010-12-17T06:35Z,"     Did you hear the shocking news?  According to  http://www.demandprogress.org  Glen Greenwald reports that U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning is being tortured.  Manning is accused of leaking unflattering information about the Afghanistan war to WikiLeaks, but hasn't been convicted of -- or even tried for -- any crime.
     Manning is being held at the U.S. Marine brig in Quantico, and according to Greenwald:

Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America's Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything. 
     Torture is outrageous and un-American, demand fair treatment of Private Manning by going to the following URL :

To demand an end to Private Manning's torture and call on the Army to give him a trial or set him free, also go to this URL :
