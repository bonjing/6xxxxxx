Lyrics:


The terror of the binary seas has arrived
with a few terrabytes of blank hard drive
hoist up the jolly roger and mutiny
were plundering the internet sea
pieces of 8 gigabytes in size
belay the antivirus so you dont capsize
and give no quarter all my privateer thieves
Im the quartermaster of the high speed seeds

Hit up a p2p then heave to
yo ho ho is practically yahoo
why would i ever buy DVD's?
a pirates life is the life for me

Dont need a sail dont mind the currents
im on the interwebs leeching your torrents
Yo ho Hoes and some MP3s
Everybody loves a little piracy
Aint got a boat I aint got a peg leg
i got a whole boat load of your MPEGS
Bury my booty all on a Re-
writable disc because its piracy

they call me captain jackin all my files online
downloading a stack of AVI's not mine
not gonna give em back no surprise cause I
live a scallywag life of pirate crime
Up at the helm im a real corsair
sing this shanty song while I steal software
pay heed to the code all my buccaneer brutes
maybe youll get a share of commandeered loot

go on account and raise up a tankard
click on a link come about weigh anchor
Captain Ulrich brought about a disaster
ran a shot right across the bow, sank napster

If you see captain Ulrich never parlay
make him walk the plank via CD tray

Dont need a sail dont mind the currents
im on the interwebs leeching your torrents
Yo ho Hoes and some MP3s
Everybody loves a little piracy
Aint got a boat I aint got a peg leg
i got a whole boat load of your MPEGS
bury my booty all on a on a Re-
writable disc because its piracy

Hit up a p2p then heave to
yo ho ho is practically yahoo
and why would i ever wanna buy CDs?
a pirates life is the life for me

Im a rap-scallion gonna make like a kraken
copy protection's gonna get cracked in
everybody prepare for the plunder and looting
fire in the hole my computers rebooting
100 megabyte pornography pics
hard drive overloaded jpegs and gifs
shes a yo ho ho so when nobodies around
im swabbin my deck while she blow the man down

Dont need a sail dont mind the currents
im on the interwebs leeching your torrents
Yo ho Hoes and some MP3s
Everybody loves a little piracy
Aint got a boat I aint got a peg leg
i got a whole boat load of your MPEGS
Bury my booty all on a Re-
writable disc because its piracy

Got hundreds of hours of tv- whole seasons
copies of shows that i hate- no reason
dont even like most of the games- im seizen
still Gonna need some CDs to put these in
Weigh the anchor and hoist up the mizzen
youll prolly pirate this after you listen
So sing along now if youre savvy
everybody loves a little piracy
