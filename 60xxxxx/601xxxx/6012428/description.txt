These CD's provide a great introduction to the Buchurest Blues of the 60/70ties, locally dubbed 'Muzica Lautareasca'. While Ceaucescu was busy cleaning up and reforming the Romanian folklore, laying down strict rules on how to play, arrange, phrase etc, a wild and hot music emerged from the urban gypsy milleu of Buchurest. It became so popular that the state controlled recording company electrecord couldnt ignore it, and efforts were made to dress up the gypsies as typical communist heroes, riding in on tv sets defeating counter revolutionary soldiers while singing etc. The style eventually was standartized and adapted to the houseclean folkloric repetoire. But these recordings display a soulfulness and fierce emotional expression, outshining by lengths the later mass reproduced 'Lautaresca', like that of Orkestar Lautari and other statesponsored ensembles. 

It should be noted that these are remastered versions targeted at a modern western audience. Dynamics and frequency ranges have been mutilated by multiband compressors and other technological devices in order to please the bleeding ears of our younger generation. If you want the authentic stuff you'll have to dig deeper for the original 'electrecord's (still available).

Vol. 1: Ion Petre Stoican

Release: 1st November 2005
Cat. Nr.: CD-ATR 0805

"This story took place before 1965. One day Stoican noticed a man who seemed to him to be behaving suspiciously. This stranger turned out to be a foreign spy. Stoican grabbed him and took him to the nearest police station. The secret police then asked what he would like as a reward. 'Should we give you a house?' - 'I don't need a house,' Stoican replied, 'I want to make a record.'" (Quote COSTEL VASILESCU, Bukarest 2005) On the only long-playing record by the Romanian violinist Ion Petre Stoican the most important Gypsy musicians from the Bucharest Lautari scene were united in an All-star band and through a bizarre stroke of luck created one of the most atmospheric records of the time. Most of the pieces played came from Constanta and from Stoican's birthplace Oltenita, and are primarily fast rhythmic dances such as Hora, Briu, Sirba or Geamparale, which no wedding could do without. Recovered from the archives of Electrecord and out on CD now: Romanian traditional music in original analog sound recorded in the 1970s!

Vol. 2: Romica Puceanu

Release: 24th February 2006
Cat. Nr.: CD-ATR 1006

The grande dame of the "cantece de mahala", Romica Puceanu, was born in Bucharest in 1926 and at the tender age of 14 had already begun to sing in local cafÃ©s in the Floreasca and Herestrau quarters on the outskirts of Bucharest. "Romica Puceanu had an inexhaustible repertoire of these songs", the accordion player and singer Victor Gore recalls in the summer of 2005. The singer recorded her first album in 1964 with the Taraful Fratii Gore - Aurel and Victor Gore's band in Electrecord's Tomis Studio. And it was the Gore Brothers who discovered the the young lady with the powerful voice in their own family and helped her on. They arranged gigs for their cousin at weddings in the quarter where the Gore and Puceanu families lived. There Romica Puceanu sang melodies with stirring words, in which she described the everyday life, longings and sufferings of the simple folk. Above all however she was a soulful performer of the songs from the poor suburbs, which merged Turkish "cifte-telli" rhythms with Romanian melodies and lyrics. In a short time she had risen to be the most popular and best paid singer and became the incarnation of Romanian Lautari music. The recordings with the Gore Brothers still represent the traditional "raw" withdrawn sound of the old taraf. The arrangements are clear and minimalist, creating space befitting Puceanu's sparkling voice. Romica Puceanu meant to many Gypsies as much as the legendary chanson singer Maria Tanase meant to the Romanians. And it wasn't only Bucharest intellectuals who saw in Romica Puceanu the "Billy Holliday of the East".

Vol. 3: Dona Dumitru Siminica

Release: 29th September 2006
Cat. Nr.: CD-ATR 1106

When Dona Dumitru Siminica sang drinking songs, laments or love songs in the Bucharest garden cafÃ© "La Chirigiu" or in the luxurious Opera restaurant, the tables filled with guests almost as quickly as the glasses with tuica or wine and the patron's till with Lei. Dona Dumitru Siminica sang songs which offered consolation to the lonely, tended the wounds of the lovesick, and prepared those newly-infatuated for the end of their love. Siminica had a disturbing, androgynous falsetto voice and a large number of female fans who hung on to every word uttered by the man in the bespoke suit with the immaculate hairstyle and carefully clipped moustache for nights on end. The third CD of our series 'Sounds From A Bygone Age' contains recordings of the most exposed singer of the muzica lautareasca. It was a sensation that a few records of urbane music with Gypsy lyrics found their way into shops in Romania in the seventies. For his best recordings Dona Dumitru Siminica assembled a Lautari dream team around himself. Faramita Lambru, Maria Tanase's favourite accompanist, played classics with Dona Dumitru Siminica such as "Afara e intuneric" and "La salul cel negru", which are released outside Romania for the first time on this CD. His sudden death in the eighties did not make the headlines in the Romanian party-controlled press. There are no written documents, no interviews, and no books about this extraordinary singer. Nothing can tell us more about the phenomenon of Dona Dumitru Siminica than his recordings, which bring back the sound of old Bucharest before it is completely forgotten.

Vol. 4: Toni Iordache

Release: 27th April 2007
Cat. Nr.: CD-ATR 1307

At the age of four Toni Iordache got to know the smaller portable version of the tzambal (cimbalom). Iordache's friend, the trumpeter Costel Vasilescu, remembers their first meeting well: "I met Toni in 1954 in a village on the outskirts of Bucharest. Toni was playing there and everyone was just standing around him and getting scared, because his playing was so insanely good."
Iordache was so gifted a musician he soon was sent on tour through many European countries, the USA and Asia as a representative of Socialist Romania. Returning home he often drove from Bucharest Airport straight to a wedding where his band were waiting for him. At the beginning of the 1970s he was arrested for the illegal possession of foreign currency. Apparently he wanted to buy his wife a fur coat with the money he had earned abroad. Even the prestigious orchestra leader Florian Economu couldn't help his soloist at the trial when he spoke up for him: "We have three giants in Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu (head of state), Ilie Nastase (Romanian tennis champion) and the tzambal player Toni Iordache! Do you really want to convict him for a few dollars?".
Toni Iordache was famous for his complex solos, a gifted ensemble player, who enriched many melodies with oriental elements and sophisticated rhythms. For him the technique of playing the tzambal was not solely one of speed; his sensitive touch, immense skill and imaginative verve marked him as a master amongst Lautari.
Seriously ill with diabetes, Toni Iordache died in February 1988. Dan Armeanca, the godfather of Romanian Gypsy pop, states: "Toni was a genius on the tzambal, ones like that are not born twice. He respected tradition, but even back then he allowed jazz influences to sound through. He gave us young musicians courage due to his musical audacity."
This album contains several Iordache instrumentals alongside recordings with the Lautari singers Gabi Lunca and Romica Puceanu.

Vol. 5: Gabi Lunca

Release: 18th April 2008
Cat. Nr.: CD-ATR 1508

Visitors to Bucharest in the grey 1980s could witness two different worlds: Official state folklore with songs of the golden era proclaimed by Ceausescu and lively suburban music (muzica de mahala), which at that time was played at private parties. Gabi Lunca also spent many years singing at weddings, and although from the beginning of the 1990s her only performances were in Pentecostal churches, her voice remains unforgotten in Romania. Her songs are the quiet, melancholic songs of passion and yearning for one's home, mother, or sweetheart; songs to lift the weight from one's soul. Included among Gabi Lunca's greatest hits are: "Omul Bun n-are noroc" (The good have no luck) and "Superata sint pe lume" (I am sad in this world). Gabi Lunca's silvery, lightly strained singing was often copied, but never equalled, although as the accordion player Victor Gore remembers, she "always sang slightly out of time". Alongside Romica Puceanu, Gabi Lunca was the most valued performer of Romanian muzica lautareasca. Yet unlike her sensuous and hard-drinking rival, Gabi Lunca's life, partly because of the four children she had with the accordion player Ion Onoriu, was spent in familiar seclusion and without excess. Not only for this reason, but also because of her carefully selected stage clothes and her great professionalism, she was also referred to as the Tziganca de matase, the silken Gypsy woman.
Gabi Lunca played with Aurel and Victor Gore's taraf until her marriage to Ion Onoriu. Later she worked with the trumpeter Costel Vasilescu, the tzimbal god Toni Iordache and other big names from the Bucharest Lautari scene in the state-owned Electrecord studio. In the final years of the Ceausescu regime her urbane repertoire was only played on the radio early in the morning. Back then her real fans would set their watches by the radio programme and at five o'clock, before they left for the factory, they would listen to the sparkling voice of this singer with a mug of cold NescafÃ©.
