,ddawg,2010-12-08T00:46Z,LOL! $$$ is always a factor.  The problem I've had with many of the classic stuff is that either the person ripping is clueless or the individual mastering the recording isn't up to par leading to a lot of mpeg quality tracks.  Not a problem with yourstuff.  Recently I purchased all of Shaggy's CD's only to discover about 50% of the tracks were mpeg quality... I was livid!
