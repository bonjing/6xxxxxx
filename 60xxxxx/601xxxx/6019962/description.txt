Invitation is a classic post-bop date featuring the Milt Jackson Sextet. The core group includes pianist Tommy Flanagan, bassist Ron Carter, and saxophonist Jimmy Heath, among others, but it's Jackson's vibraphone work that gives this session its distinctive stamp. A swinging feel and fine interplay infuse each of the tunes, including some Jackson originals and a take on Thelonious Monk's "Ruby, My Dear."
