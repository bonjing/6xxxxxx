,Wombat105,2010-12-06T21:25Z,"Firstly let me thanks you for this great upload, Guys is the ACM supposed to work because mine is not unfortunately?"
,rra137,2010-12-06T22:07Z,"I never flew an F-18 but I know how planes behave.
I was surprised by the overreaction to the stick input.
When I move my stick I don't see the stick in the cockpit move.
I don't see anything moving outside when I push the stick in any direction or press a rudder pedal.
Did I miss something during the installation/crack ?"

horizon-tails not animated,
aircraft acceleration and Pilot Steering are weird,

Just cancel it and crack the plane."
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-07T10:02Z,"@everyone

Those who are experiencing handle problem should install fsuipc in the rar file.

If that is old version, download the latest atleast 4.60 or above, handle should work perfectly."

fsuipc 4.60."
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-07T10:13Z,"You must have fsx acceleration or sp2.

Now better keep you mother fuckin ass out of this torrent or fuck a donkey instead.
You can also fuck your mom, wait, your penis is dam short, insert your head in her pussy and enjoy the life.

Just have nothin to do instead criticising others."
,mickyfinnny,2010-12-07T11:25Z,"ACM doesnt work,copied it to backup folder.Still dont work,asks to activate.Did what the nfo stated(except for the fsuipc cos i got v 4.60)Also this thing flys all over the place etc etc etc.......
But thanx for trying."
,revmagnum,2010-12-07T12:51Z,Unfortunately another Failure! ACM is NOT cracked and this bird wont work without it!...I gues nobody will ever crack ACM...Nice try anyway.
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-07T13:46Z,"For me it worked properly, 

you all are saying ACM is not cracked hence plane is not working properly.

I will try to crack it !

BTW,

I found captaisim 707 for fsx but unfortunately it is in rar file and is encrypted with passowrd.

Even rar password cracker is unable to decrypt it."
,Jimstalk,2010-12-07T14:56Z,"snapshot is right.In order to make a normal takeoff with this plane you need a huge runway.Even the kai tak is too short for it.I managed to fix the issue with the flaps but the problem still occured.

THE PLANE MUST REACH AT LEAST 180 KTS IN ORDER TO TAKEOFF NORMALLY............."
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-07T17:00Z,"@Jimstalk

A fighter is fighter, so is it the problem of my upload or plane itself or is it just normal?

Well, for me it is normal, I can take it off from Heathrow after the completetion of 2/5th of the runway.

In my pc plane is just running normal with everything working as they should.

Just go through some comments regarding the requirements I posted. Maybe, thay can help !!!"
,aarquee,2010-12-07T17:02Z,"NvidiaPhysX, please take care to run a search before you upload torrents. Multiple torrents of the same software distract seeders and ultimately dilute the cloud of both torrents, effectively killing both. You can see that this torrent was uploaded in June - albeit a much larger file, likely due to a wider livery selection - which has the exact same ACM issues. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5626995/FSX_-_VRS_Superbug_F_A-18E

I shared that torrent but currently am unable to access my original account. Hopefully TPB will restore access to my FSX torrents, time will tell. I might add that my torrent is pre-catshit so correspondingly free of the trolling spam - for now."

,Jimstalk,2010-12-07T18:34Z,"@NvidiaPhysX

Its like flying a jumbo jet.Try to make 360 degrees turn and then put some possitive g-Forces on it.The aircraft will stall immediately and  crash.I know that  its a high-realism aircraft but superbugs are considered to be STOL airplanes (short takeoff/landing).They should be able to make a takeoff from an aircraft carrier.I tried this too.The aircraft fell into the ocean within seconds.Read again the comments and you'll realise that im not the only one who has this issue....Im not blaming you but you insist that you've tested your upload  and that takeoff is normal.Although it doesn't work properly i thanked you because you managed to crack one of the most secure software ever made for FSX............

,bourney,2010-12-08T08:17Z,"THIS IS WHAT I HAVE SEEN @

 After installation is complete, you will need to activate the ACM software using the License ID and password in your sales invoice. Once activated and registered, the ACM will download the remaining installation files. If for any reason you can't activate automatically, use the Manual activation method on the activation screen by selecting option 2, followed by option 3. If for any reason you can't download the software, we will provide a mirrored link in the FSX support forum, which will open shortly.

8) You must run the ACM and activate prior to flight. No ACM activation = FSX crash. Once the ACM is up and running, you may notice errors under control preferences if you haven't flow the aircraft yet. These are NORMAL. The ACM is just telling you you need to fly the aircraft so it can find your controllers."

He can't stand the idea of people who would never buy his wares getting a copy for free. Worse, he has no ties to CS but his anally retentive ego can't tolerate the idea of people getting for free something he paid for.

OMG Marius, try this one, if NvidiaPhysX can't crack and share it and get his enjoyment doing so - I DON'T WANT IT!
Get this, I have the legendary 707, warez'd (of course) only and solely because I wanted a decent NORAD E-3a. True that the instruments didn't work in FSX but any monkey with half a brain can alias decent gauges into the panel .cfg.
So go ahead and gouge your money - or spend it - but know your dark capitalistic nay-saying is a raindrop against the flood tide of file sharing and you will prevent NONE of it. "

Everything works except the gauges, which would need to be substituted to FSX standards (might be easier than cracking the 707 Pro however). The livery and model selection is far greater than the FSX version since you get the E3a and the VC-137.

Here it is: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3373258/FS2004_-CAPTAIN_SIM_-_LEGENDARY_707
