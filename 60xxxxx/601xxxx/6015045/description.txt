"Beer Walk!"

Donna, frustrated by her husband's laziness on 
the weekends, nags Cleveland to help her around 
the house and to do something more with his life. 
To prove to Donna he can be as charitable as her, 
Cleveland recruits his buddies from Quahog and 
Stoolbend to participate in the First Annual 
Charity Beer Walk. When Donna gets injured at 
the event, Cleveland has to take over the 
housework.

Enjoy :)
