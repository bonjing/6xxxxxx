Searched high and low for a torrent of this file, there\'s not one. SO I got a friend who is registered with propellerheads to dl for me. There are way too many Reason users that are on Mac not to have this torrent up. Seed it...you\'re welcome. 

What it is:
Refill Packer for Mac OS X- if you use Reason you already know....but it takes your fragmented Reason files (samples, programs, etc) and packs them so you can easily migrate them to another computer.
