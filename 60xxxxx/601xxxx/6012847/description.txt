Part 5 of 26. Let the Good Times Roll originally aired on NPR in 26 1-hour long segments. Hosted by Jerry Butler, formerly of The Impressions, this program features clips of the songs we all grew up with, no matter what our age, along with commentary by many who were in the industry. This is professional journalism presented by professionals; it is wonderful stuff. I will seed episodes a few at a time, so keep checking for new ones.
