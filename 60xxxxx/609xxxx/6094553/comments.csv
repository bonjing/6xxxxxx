[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T02:13Z,"i am sorry , this is actually and with very acceptable picture the 1972 picture with the same name , i worked a few movies and i got wrong what exactly was this one , now i ask to forgive me for my lapse and ask if i should remove to the possible users if i should remove this file or not , THIS IS THE 1972 MOVIE WITH THE SAME NAME , and when i get this movie i get confused and tought that no way was another movir than the 2011 , if i get the 2011 i donÂ´t mind to upload , the question is this one beeing from 1972 with the same name should rem,ain or not , please forgive this insconscient lapse and tell me what i do , still a nice movie but from 1972 and of course it is wrong the 2011 on the name of the file . Sorry ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T02:27Z,"First i have to say that wasn´t with intention that i made this confusion and second believe me when i am saying that i get frustrated like evryone else when i find that was the 1972 but i repeat with nice picture and sound , unfornatly my friendly users the net for the moment is full of crap files for the 2011 movie , so can be tough actually see this one for the moment but if i get a shot in someway , who knows ? sorry again for the lapse and happy 1972 Season of Witch movie to watch . "
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T02:35Z,"I really understand the anxous to watch the 2011 movie with the same name and it is compreensible with the argument and everything and quickly growing on the top movies on the us for the moment , i counted my friendly users in afew places what can be between 50 and 100 crap files to this movie , can any light at the end of the tunel show up to watch the movie soon ? we have to wait with the expectation in some cam or something show up ."
