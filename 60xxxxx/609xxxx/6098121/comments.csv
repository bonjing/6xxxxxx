,gmjh,2011-01-23T14:17Z,I find it amusing that so many people on pirate bay say they don't download anything smaller than 5 or 6GB for HD movies when RiddlerA provides uploads that somehow look better than the 5GB versions out there and are 90% smaller in size. The snobbery about size and quality of HD downloads would disappear if everyone could see Riddlers uploads
,pandela,2011-02-06T06:20Z,Thank you !
,galimake,2011-07-17T05:06Z,"Thanks for all the best tv series or movies in small but very good quality pack.
