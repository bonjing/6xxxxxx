,petegrim,2011-01-12T16:01Z,is there any fish  involved in this film
,TheWolfmann,2011-01-13T00:57Z,"Some of these films are just too well protected! We have to wait a little longer. 

I've seen it in the cinema. The first hour feels like 10 hours. In the end there is tension...

Hope for a good r5 line or dvd rip in a few monthes (just like due date and Fair game 2010. Fucked up)."

I note that you try and put this guy down for his uploads! If you are so good at this then try putting something back for others. Also try growing a brain.
Cheers for the up globeplus."
