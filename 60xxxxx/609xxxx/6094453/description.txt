Simon Sparrow, a serious young medical student, arrives at St. Swithin's Hospital. He makes friends with Grimsdyke, who is reluctant to qualify since he has been left a thousand a year for the duration of his training, Benskin, who is principally interested in girls, and Evans, who is only interested in football. Together, these four go through their medical education - the post-rugger match rag, examinations, encounters with nurses, irate sisters, patients.
