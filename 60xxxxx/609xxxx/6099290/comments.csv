,fetotto,2011-03-20T12:02Z,"LiG, can you please fix third and forth movie of shrek as well? You're doing an awsome job mate."
,Bargetti,2011-04-19T04:20Z,"I suspect the reason your not uploading Step Up because you don't want to buy it right? I don't blame you, as for the download, you are the king of 3D torrents, great upload, have half of your 3D movies now. 

as for the movie...I will say that the 3D was better than I anticipated and good quality, but the worst part of the movie is the new voice actors they added, it seemed like they put no effort into finding a good actor and actress. but other than that the movie was fine.

Thanks for the upload, keep it up.

BTW, I just hooked my desktop up to the TV through HDMI and it works just fine using windows media player."
,robkim,2011-05-04T05:19Z,"hey super63 or anybody, the tv doesn't recognize my external hard drive, and if i formatted to FAT32 i doesn't allow more de 4gb files, how did you get your tv to play a 10gb from you hdd. "
