Nanosecond Eternity
Betwixt & Between
[TCSLCD-0002] 2010
MP3 320
Hardcore, Gabber, Hard Trance, Hard NRG

This may be one of the best albums I have ever heard. Though I've heard Betwixt & Between make excellent tracks before, this is his first solo-album, and has been published under the Hardcore Tano*C label. Every single track is amazing. This is a very complex album, it's not one you listen to at a rave, club, or in the car, but one where you turn off the lights, lay in bed with headphones, and go into another world. If you enjoy complex, multi-layered, creative, and challenging electronic trance and hardcore, get this album.
