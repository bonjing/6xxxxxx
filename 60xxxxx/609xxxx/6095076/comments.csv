,ARhupam,2011-02-05T06:44Z,"Zen_Bud: what is the best method for making your MKVs play smoothly &/or be convertible to regular formats, like DVD/VOB etc.? When I play an MKV from your uploads in MediaClassicPlayer it is jerky, splashy, erratic... & if I convert it w/ MKV Converter Studio it is unstable too. Any tips?"
