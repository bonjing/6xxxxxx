      hunt by tilting your device to control his direction as he jumps        
      from platform to platform. Capture the treasures for extra points       
      and a jumping boost! Great Caribbean theme and music accompany you      
      on your journey.                                                        
      Now with moving platforms, platforms that break, cannons, pistols,      
      flying birds and pirate bombers! Nice music and sound effects from      
      SomaTone Interactive Audio.
