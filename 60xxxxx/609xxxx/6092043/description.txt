A Pre-existing Condition  2011 ghostmeat GM056

A Pre-existing Condition was recorded just outside Athens, GA with Rob Keller (Six String Drag) on upright bass and backing vocals, William Tonks (Bloodkin) on dobro and guitar and Russ Hallauer (Sunbrain) on mandolin and tenor banjo. The album distinguishes itself from other recent Dondero releases with exclusive use of acoustic instruments and extensive use of vocal harmony. Clay Leverett (Now It's Overhead) and Ken Will Morton also make guest appearances with backing vocals and harmonica respectively. The 13-track album features original compositions side by side with Dondero's interpretations of songs by artists such as Little Feat, Elizabeth Cotten, Charlie Pride, Neil Young, Woody Guthrie, Doug Sahm, Jawbreaker, Bob Dylan and Jimmie Rodgers.
