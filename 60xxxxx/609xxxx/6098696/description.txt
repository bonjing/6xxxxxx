     Description...                                                  
                                                       

      While transporting a tank back to the barracks, the boys
      defy orders by stopping off at a service station for a bit of
      breakfast. Charlie is so worried that Sergeant Thomson will be
      angry that the boys decide to add to his anxiety by hiding the
      tank from him. This sparks off a chain of events that sees Gary
      having to call in all sorts of favours in order to stay one step
      ahead of Thomson, something that becomes increasingly difficult
      when Julie gets involved.
