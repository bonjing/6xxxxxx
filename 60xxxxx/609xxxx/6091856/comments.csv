,adyady,2011-01-09T23:21Z,"Yes I remember playing it on my winXP SP1 =).
The game doesnt include the crack, although it is on the www gamecopyworld com website.

Also this is the spanish version, I really hope it lets you change language(i'm on linux,cant test).
It is the only Chrome torrent out there on TPB, so it will have to do =)."
,motley666,2011-01-10T02:37Z,"It's not the only torrent in this site and you also should mention in the title that it's the spanish version. And last but no least if the crack is missing then you should incluse it in the torrent file, don't upload if it's not complete."
,adyady,2011-01-10T02:50Z,"Searching for chrome gives me no torrents for the game, where are you looking at?
The crack i said is in the gamecopyworld site, i BELIEVE you can even play it with daemon tools without crack as the game is so old i think it wont even detect device emulation.

As for the language, i dont have the english disk, but all games are scripted in english + other languages, there must be a setting somewhere to mess with and make it english. 
Maybe i shouldnt have uploaded this and let the game disappear forever ,thats what you say?
Also the chromed- editor is very nice to make levels. 

Chrome is one of the first games to use chrome engine which has been used in games like Call of juarez.

This more than a game is a piece of history

,motley666,2011-01-10T13:03Z,"I don't want the game to disappear, i just believe as a general rule that if you want to upload something make sure it's complete. If you are sure that it works in english and without crack then it's fine. I found some other torrent of this, but they are not seeded, i typed ""chrome"" without the quotes and clicked on games field. Cheers."
