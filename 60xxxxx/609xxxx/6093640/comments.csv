,bobby493,2011-01-17T00:59Z,"This is probably my last chance to be able to play the game,
will be waiting for seed"
,bobby493,2011-01-17T19:33Z,"the game still asks to insert the original dvd,
still can not play =("
,nogardd,2011-01-19T17:49Z,"bobby493 do like this..
install the game. unmount the game image, and install this patch, then play the game.
thats how i did. after i extracted the game and installed, (or just installed) i installed the patch afterwards.. and it worked, already finished the game and worked perfectly..

currently seeding and will be seeding for few more days"
,bloodb1,2011-03-09T16:00Z,"crap, no matter what i do , mini image, this patch, it always asks for oreginal dvd -.-"
,Noob1995,2011-07-19T14:11Z,"Works perfectly for me!

If you get some problems about the cd, I think it's wise of you all to the file called ""dmv.dll"" (downloaded) to your games destination folder -> bin

That's worked for me...

(sorry for my bad english, I'm norwegian...)"
,Noob1995,2011-07-19T14:12Z,"I have to correct my self:

""...you all to the file called...""

should be:

""...you all to COPY the file called..."""
