,Saurov,2011-01-12T10:51Z,"axxo back in the business? :o
If that's true...it's the best thing that has happened in 2011"
,iCORM,2011-01-13T00:31Z,"its not a aXXo release. lot of abnormalities in the release and the best one was aXXo never uses DivX, wat the fuck is wrong with you all... move on, there are more better release groups out on the scene."
,KrzyTost,2011-01-15T14:26Z,I vouch for never having any problems with any download from aXXo. Thanx aXXo :D
,dirface,2011-01-15T20:06Z,Only a moron would have a 1m tall NFO box. Def not Axxo.
,anjew,2011-01-21T23:44Z,"Downloaded it (stupid me for not reading comments...)

Definitely not true Axxo. Video ok, but Audio is hollow ""PVC pipe""-like. :(
Endurable, but my advice is to get another copy."
,fuckcopyright,2011-01-26T15:03Z,is aXXo a person or a team i think is a team right !! or why do people think is one person???Q?Q
,Jeg_leger,2011-02-04T02:32Z,AXXO is in jail and yes he is 1 person. maybe two if he is skitzo !
,babybluetits24,2011-02-14T13:22Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1560954/   well if axxo is back hello dude, but weve moved on from 700mb files, if u own a big hdtv u need better quality files eg 4.37gb 720p or better yet full 1080p, 700mb is ok on a small pc screen"
,DEMOLAY,2011-03-14T10:29Z,AXXO+VLC=LONG NIGHTS :)
