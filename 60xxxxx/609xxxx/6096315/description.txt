Two years for a little less than two hours: those are the numbers behind The Trashmaster, a feature-length machinima flick made entirely using GTA IV PC and its video tools. Owing a hard-to-miss debt to Scorsese and likely to be pulled from the internet by the Rolling Stonesâ€™ copyright lawyers any day now, this veritable labour of love is the flashy, violent tale of a vigilante garbageman, cleaning up whatever (i.e. whoever) the police canâ€™tâ€¦

Iâ€™ve must confess I didnâ€™t make it all the way through (it is, letâ€™s be honest, far too long, and the voices oh god the voices the voices) but itâ€™s enormously technically impressive. So much so that itâ€™s impossible not to suspect itâ€™s much, much more interested in stylised cinematography than involving narrative, with the painful voice acting a very distant third, but in visual terms itâ€™s a huge success.

Creator Mathieu Weschler has made GTA IVâ€™s frankly weird engine sing, presenting a dizzing array of camera angles, slo-mo and assorted post-processing, and demonstrating that, whatever other issues we had with GTA 4â€²s PC port, Rockstar sure packed a lot of detail into their city. The Trashmaster borrows liberally from every blockbuster youâ€™ve ever heard of, but you just canâ€™t fault the visual impressiveness.
