iLLUSiON NOTES
Ok so the first thing im going to say is, its a pretty poor cam. I dropped the source into vdubmod. I used a smoother on a very light setting to clean the video up without losing to much detail. Then i lowered the contrast & gamma. After that i increased the saturation & brightness a little bit. The last thing i done to the video was, changed the colours with a rgb eq i spent hours at this. Finally i muxed imagines cam audio. Im not happy with the colours, but i spent ages changing them and trying different thing out, & i think it looks better this way. You do get some very bright parts in the video (like you did in yogi bear) but there was nothing i could do about this without making the rest of the video very dark.

Here is a screenshot comparison between mine & the source.
