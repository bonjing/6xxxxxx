,nemosrings,2012-05-17T12:06Z,"Aimersoft is a Chinese company that takes 'Open-Source' code and puts an interface on their programs, calls it their own and sells it. No thanks, a load of crap. There's much better softwares around if you research enough. I tried two of their apps once, a load of rubbish compared to alternatives.
Chinese do not care about patents or about open-source code, they will call anything their own and sell it."
