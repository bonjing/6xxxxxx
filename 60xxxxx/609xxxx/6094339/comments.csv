yes it's me Burg. I started Baba in Nov 1997. You are correct, none of the pics where hosted on my webspace. I had about 40-50 guys around the world who were so kind to host a few pics. The only thing I had on my site was a html file with all the links to the pics, 36k let's say. After 2-3 weeks I generated already to much traffic according to my ISP. With 36k per visitor!

Also the management from AB began to spam me by email. Very funny ;-)

Anyway, 14 years later, I live in Thailand for 10 years now, Alley is probably a grandma by now.

Do you have any update on roadrunner?

Thanks mate."
