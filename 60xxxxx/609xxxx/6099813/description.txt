Human Target S02E09: Imbroglio

Ilsa and her sister in-law are in danger when a hostage crisis interrupts an evening at the opera.

This episode was recorded in Canada on Jan 12, 2011. It was scheduled to be aired the same night in the United States but was postponed to make way for an address by President Obama. 

The quality is quite watchable, but not nearly as nice as a scene release. The source was non-HD and this is not a digital capture.
