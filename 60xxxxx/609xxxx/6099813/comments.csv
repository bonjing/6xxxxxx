There was a second ep of Human Target. But one thing at a time, eh? I'll see what I can do on that.

Better With You doesn't seem to have been broadcast due to President Obama's address I guess.

Modern Family and Cougar Town are on eztv.

I'll give the scene some time with Doyle."
,danka58,2011-01-13T12:36Z,"@cindy yes it was a 2 hour episode. It MAY re-air Friday the 14th but unlikely. Source here:

,terrorPhysicist,2011-01-14T09:14Z,"Hey, anyone else having difficulties downloading this torrent? I can't seem to connect to anyone. My other torrents work fine, even Human Target Episode 10 (uploaded by err0001 as well). But this one just... won't do anything :/

I've had this problem once before, and I still don't know what's causing it."
,terrorPhysicist,2011-01-14T09:52Z,Nevermind. Looks like it was a problem with the magnet link. Fixed now.
,FX5,2011-01-14T12:29Z,Thanks for the up but these are bad crops w/below average video quality. One also finished before the end of the Ep.

The long list of links on RLSLOG suggests this is good enough until the scene does it tonight:

As for bad cropping, the ""A"" channel and the ""Space"" channel here do not yet broadcast in HD. The content was 16:9 but was formatted as 4:3. Therefore there was black on the top and the bottom. For whatever reason, the ""14+"" at the top and the A channel logo at the bottom extended into this black area. I think that cropping out the black parts was the best choice.

As for quality, I agree. But I didn't claim it was great quality - quite the contrary."
