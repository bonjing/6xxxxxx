,e666,2011-01-10T17:04Z,thanks mate :)
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-10T18:32Z,"@Rupert77

Obviously you're a newbie with using the NTRs,  cause at least you talk like one. Just relax, keep the spirit, and don't keep jumping into conclusions as you did at my other Norton 2011 torrent. 

The choice is yours: be happy or buy it, and don't complain about things you get for free."
,Soundigy,2011-01-10T18:39Z,"@Rupert77: You're probably right. But IMO you can always use 90days OEM trial, and after let's say 80days, uninstall and use NTR to purge, then install again, and you got newly 90 days."
,Soundigy,2011-01-10T18:57Z,"I agree with you 'RobbingHood'.
This works flawless and we should be happy!
Cheers!"

Just ignore the ratings, cause there are a lot of spammers around trying to confuse and scare users by giving negative comments and ratings."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-19T09:14Z,"@vanillacoke 

If the Norton toolbars are disabled you won't notice it if Norton somehow gets disabled (while online), so personally I don't recommend to disable them."
,rdbear32,2011-01-30T02:50Z,"hi all. i'm going to bravely ask some potentially stupid question knowing i may get blasted for my ignorance. bring it on if u must! haha k, anyhow i ran the trial (TY RH!) and it worked great but didn't reset it before it expired. i have removed and reinstalled norton but it obviously does not completely uninstall when the trial is still expired upon reinstall. also i noticed the reset appears to me as a wmp file- can i get detailed instructions on how to do this? please and thanks! :)"

I assumed you already had this due to the NIS Void request about a month ago. Yeah, slow bandwidth sucks ... ^_^"

,quietcity,2011-03-03T22:17Z,Works perfect! I haven't had any issues so far. Great torrent! Many thanks! :-)
[V],RobbingHood,2011-05-16T02:22Z,"UPDATE NOTE:
-----------------

My NIS v18.5.0.125 was updated today (16 may 2011) to v18.6.0.29 through a LiveUpdate.
No matter what the settings of Norton are, if there's a new version build update avalaible 
it will be downloaded and installed through updating.

NTR v3.3.1 still works, but it's not sure yet if the version build update may cause problems 
when uninstalling NTR v3.3.1 cause I didn't try yet to uninstall NTR v3.3.1 on Norton 18.6.0.29.

Also I'm not sure yet if NTR v3.3.1 works for the separate installer of Norton 18.6.0.29,
cause my Norton was updated internally through an update."
