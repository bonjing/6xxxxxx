*********

2. Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.1.0 by BOX! (Released: September, 2010) - Extra
3. Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.0.0 by BOX! (Released: August, 2010) - Extra

5. Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 (English, Final RTM)
 


About Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 by BOX!:
*********************************************
Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 (NTR2011-v3.2.0) extends the trial period 
of Norton 2011 (NAV + NIS), so there's more time to evaluate the product.

To extend the trial days, just uninstall the NTR before the subscription 
expires and install the NTR again for another 120/165 days of subscription
(the exact number of days depends on your system and situation).

Norton Internet Security has all the same features as Norton AntiVirus, but 
NIS also includes a firewall and offers full internet protection, unlike NAV. 

AV = AntiVirus
IS = Internet Security 
NAV = Norton AntiVirus
NIS = Norton Internet Security
NTR = Norton Trial Reset



Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 was tested on:
*********************************************
- Norton AntiVirus 2011 v18.5.0.125 
- Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 
- Tested on WinXP (x86) and Win7 (x86/x64)

* Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 is not for Norton 360 !!!
* NTR2011-v3.2.0 may not work with future patches/updates.

* File size NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: 2,23 MB (2.341.584 bytes)
* Release date NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: January, 2011



NTR 2011 Update Info:
*********************
Many users reported that NTR v3.1.3 for Norton 2011 v18.1.0.37 causes problems 
if Norton is updated to v18.5.0.125. If your Norton got locked, expired, or if 
some of the Norton settings cannot be entered anymore, then try solving the 
problem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).

Reported is that NTR v3.0.0 BETA can also be used to unlock and activate Norton 
2011 v18.5.0.125 but the Norton background themes can't be changed and creating a
Norton account isn't possible (cause NTR v3.0.0 BETA disables the Norton account). 
 
* Note: NTR v3.0.1 was pulled back by BOX!, so don't use NTR v3.0.1 anyway!



About the NIS 2011 crack for 180 days or 88 year by S&P, available on the web:
******************************************************************************  
Recently two cracks are released for Norton 2011 by "Shady and Protection (S&P)". 
Released in january 2010 is a NIS 2011 crack for 180 days, size 341 kB (349.521 
bytes), the other NIS 2011 crack is for 88 year, size 2,16 MB (2.268.065 bytes). 
Many users reported that both NIS 2011 cracks by S&P don't work for long, 
and that after a few hours/days their Norton got locked and/or expired. 

If due to the NIS 2011 cracks by S&P your Norton got locked and/or expired try 
solving the problem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).  

Never heard of "Shady and Protection (S&P)" ??? Then you're not the only one !?! 
For now it seems like the two NIS 2011 cracks by S&P are pure WEBSHIT ..... 
So use the two NIS 2011 cracks by S&P at your own risk !!!

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. avast! Pro Antivirus
3. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
