A very nice little screener with a good picture and dual audio. There is a water mark "Property of blah blah" that appears every so oftern across the middle but its quite faint and does not ruin the print. It would of been worse to try and remove this so has been left as it is. The theatrical release is not due to March 2011 with the DVD/BR out later in the year. Enjoy
