For best Chili's cd. The two are also in my top ten albums of all time. This is the darkhorse of the Chili's album catalogue and seems to be the one that no one likes. I really don't see why. First of all, contrary to popular belief, Dave Navarro is an absolutely amazing guitarist. However, he gets bashed on because he's not John Frusciante. Why? No one cared that Frusciante wasn't Hillel Slovak! Secondly, people complain that this cd is too repetitive. Why?! This is perhaps one of the most diverse cds the Peppers have ever created. Flea sings on some songs including a solo piece. A New guitar player. Music borrowed from almost every genre and capitalized on. This cd spans alternative ( Aeroplane, Deep Kick), Metal (Coffee Shop, Warped), Modern Rock ( My Friends) Experimentation (Pea, Walkabout) and thats only like half the cd! This cd takes you on a musical journey and is lushly diverse from start to finish. If only they would've kept Dave for even one more album, that would have been incredible. But this is perhaps the Chilis at their creative peak, save BSSM. Absolutely essential listening.
