i dont know what to laugh at.that u r upset with his speed ( wat is he supposed to do.. deliver them to ur home by a chopper?)
or the 'as usual' part.. for gods sake if u have the problem 'always' get ur shows elsewhere. instead of having to face the problem 'everytime' n whine like a b****.
LMAO.
@20-40 sorry dude... had to let this one out ( still giggling)"
,dark_defender,2011-01-11T14:28Z,"Hi twentyforty,
Thanks for your encodes and uploads. Was waiting for ""The Cape"". Hope it lives up to its expectation.

@killeurkilleur: I hope this was the last time you were defaming(trying to) this great man."
,tylr,2011-01-11T16:20Z,"can u do Das experiment : http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5970750/Das_Experiment_2001_720p_BRRip_x264-BeLLBoY_(Kingdom-Release)

..its BIG, can u  make it small?? wud u be doing this movie (sometime?!)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-11T16:26Z,"@muthineni:  ""upset with his speed"":
Very FEW people CAN download with 28200 kB/sec, little above 3 Gbps.
Loony is not one of them.
And yes, he is upset - by nature."
,sanyam123,2011-01-11T16:30Z,thanks 2040
,hkoraddi,2011-01-11T17:58Z,"well as no new up of u so i down cape.its quite good

wanted to ask you any ipod releases near by as my mobile wont support these files....."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-12T13:08Z,"@hkoraddi: ""Mobile"" is too wide term. ""Cell"" or ipod and psp clones differentiate more than plain mp4 acceptance.
Sorely, as you may read, from September I dropped wide-target concept.

From time-to-time I would encode 272p an your new ""mobile"" should be able to play those (but I don't know what do you need or have).

Maybe you should get HandBrake or some other free conversion program and using the presets, perform re-encodings of my files."
,punk67,2011-01-12T16:54Z,thanks twenty forty
