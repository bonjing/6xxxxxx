Freshly-ripped FLAC copy of the hard-to-find Hoobastank CD from 1998; finally a rip which doesn't have a noticeable skip at the 2:00 mark of the final song.

Also a bonus album by Justin Myles, who among his other talents was a principal cast-member of the travelling show "Stomp!" for the past ~5 years.

The 2 albums don't have much in common other than not being very common, but those who like one may also like the other.

All scans included are new & high-quality (as much as the source permits, anyway).
