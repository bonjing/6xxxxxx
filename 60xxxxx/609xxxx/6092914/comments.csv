,serchmeng,2011-01-10T17:41Z,"@buketsful Put your panties and stop your whining dude. There is an abundance of American programming on British TV. As a matter of fact there are ENTIRE channels devoted to American entertainment. Brits and Americans have totally different humor and lifestyles if an American show were to be retrofitted to a British standard the 2 would be almost indistinguishable. I personally HATE UK Office..but others disagree..and that's OK..What I suggest you do is get over yourself and stop thinking that your opinion is fact..

And I now leave the floor open to the slew of AntiAmerican comments that will surely follow. To all those not wise enough to separate a rogue government from its population..I continue to pity your existence.."
,jfk213,2011-01-10T19:23Z,serchmeng we made the Office you copied that to i am just pissed that the are remaking it why not just air the uk one and yes there are a lot of American shows on are tv but we don't changed them just air it it like us getting friends and putting English ppl in it but leave the same script. so like i said fuck this show  
,gellis2010,2011-01-10T19:59Z,"serchmeng 
i dont believe the uk have copied a single usa tv show, we show the american shows here instead. You know why? we speak the same language!! Imagine if the uk, instead of showing f.r.i.e.n.d.s., we created our own show called m.a.t.e.s. wouldnt it annoy you simply because we would be missing out on the awesomness of friends?
We feel the same. Just watch red dwarf, life on mars, inbetweeners, being human, shamless. We speak your language"
,greennick,2011-01-10T20:21Z,"I personally have watched the whole British series and loved it, and I can say this looks pretty good too. It's done in a slightly different perspective, and the accent is vastly easier to understand than the typical british gibberish.
BTW, not all shows are better in their original, British version. Example - Queer as Folk. Short, good but not excellent series in the UK, and the much longer and imho better US version."
,jfk213,2011-01-10T20:30Z,gellis2010 they speak ares lol 
,serchmeng,2011-01-11T01:31Z,"@jfk213 well, I personally wouldn't give too much of a fuck they did. I understand what you mean..but honestly these shows are loosely based on their UK counterparts..the settings and character backgrounds are different..they are meant to appeal to a US audience. Americans will not sit and watch Brits babble about British things the way the British will sit there and watch Americans babble about American nonsense. In terms of the Office UK and the Office US..the only similarity is the incompetent boss and the shows reality tv style structure..this is nothing for you to be mad about..if Americans wanted to watch British tv shows we would..but it turns out that most of us wouldn't on a regular basis..i for one am NOT one of those

,jfk213,2011-01-11T03:03Z,serchmeng its not loosely based it was the same Nealy word for word 
,nohopeinc,2011-01-11T03:30Z,Maybe you could tell your stupid fucking countrymen to stop selling the rights to your shows to us thus preventing us from making such horrible copies of your awesome shows. OR you could just stfu cause nobody cares anyways. Good torrent thanks. 
,mattberry,2011-01-11T09:09Z,"I don't care if it's a remake as long as I get to see Emmy Rossum topless, I'm good."
,LiTH75,2011-01-11T10:24Z,"i'm an american and i actually love and prefer the british versions. i'll give being human a try but the uk version was awesome! plus, i believe that friends is based on coupling which, in my opinion, was a lot funnier.  i gave the american version of top gear a shot but it's not the same without hammond, clarkson and may. hvig said that, there's really no need to bash americans. to quote serchmeng, ""To all those not wise enough to separate a rogue government from its population..I continue to pity your existence.."""

,serchmeng,2011-01-11T15:54Z,@LiTH75 I hate Jeremy Clarkson as much as any other nonracist would but I do agree Top Gear UK is years beyond anything Top Gear USA is..
,Nobody86,2011-01-11T22:33Z,"I DON""T CARE ABOUT ANY F>>> BRITISH VERSION, I like this one - how about that?"
,tmankeny,2011-01-12T00:29Z,"THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE UP. 

wow!!! i can't believe the way some people are. first let me point out that none of us brits or americans made any shows. we here are all downloaders and not producers so stop acting as if you own it. i could care less which country has what show. i watch british and american shows if i like them. i just can't believe that anyone would get so upset because AN AMERICAN PRODUCER - not americans copied a british show. keep in mind they are in it to make money and if a show is a hit in one country it might follow to be a hit in another country. its called captalizm my british and american friends. "
,rimesouljah,2011-01-12T04:43Z,"@buketsful - Firstly mate, its 'our' not 'are'. Fully couldnt understand what you were saying there. But I agree with everyone who says to stop whining. Truth is, the uk version is awesome, this one will probably be crap but some people will like it so thats their opinion. Gotta point out that the brits do copy, just like aussies and kiwis do. think 'american idol'. Every single country now has their own 'idol' show it's a franchise. if the americans copy a show, theyve also got to pay for it meaning the producers in britain sold the rights. kudos to them. ever seen the show 'honest'? Try watching 'outrageous fortune' - N.Z show thats the original. Peace."
[T],cad40,2011-01-12T20:19Z,we might copy your programs but what when we do we base it loosly on the original ie law and order uk is our own version not what you've done to shameless same names same storyline and yes exactly the same script talk about rip off also wheres all the drug culture fran k always orders a pint and two e from the jockey loosely what a load of shit its like kids performing shameless look at fi in the uk version much better every thing we uk invent you stupid hillbilly's try to copy it ie we invent football excuse me soccer for you thick you invent american football what a laugh us snooker you pool us net ball u basketball come invent you're own stuffwhat a load of shit get a program and just copy it exactly come on fucking inbreds
,tmankeny,2011-01-15T01:05Z,well i watched the first episode and i would say it is okay.  i think i will check out the UK version next.  so i am going to look for season 1.  i saw a season 8 so it must be doing great. 
,tmankeny,2011-01-15T01:06Z,also the good thing about another country doing the same show is i would have never heard of the UK version if showtime didn't copy it.  
,jaycoyoyo,2011-01-23T19:11Z,Jeez guys quit freaking out...it's a TV show
,NitLions,2011-01-26T04:32Z,"This is already a better show cuz its in America. I haven't seen either but I watched the Office UK version and it was garbage compared to the US. I mean not even a little big funny, I'll watch this one thanks very much"
,totter10,2011-03-07T17:40Z,Does anyone have any more of the episodes? I'm not currently stateside and won't be back home until late fall. Wiki says there are 8 episodes and I've only been able to download the first 5.
,totter10,2011-03-07T17:46Z,I just read the previous post. I'm sorry the writers and producers in England decided to sale the rights to the show to Americans. You know they didn't have to do that. It isn't like those of us from America crept into Britain in the middle of the night and stole the tapes. Ultimately it was the British that sold out and the Americans were buying. 
,melloblu,2011-06-14T02:45Z,Listen up Britts Americans liked the idea of the show so we used it like everything else we use to create a melting pot of a nation in which you are jealous of. The reason why is because we kicked your ass so many times and we are better than you at everything. Especially when it comes to media. You just wish you could be like us and the fact is you never will be. we are the best and make the best media so any ideas you have we can and will take them and make them better because you suck anyways. plus your accents give the world a headache and since you can never win a fight no one will ever listen to your griping so shut the fuck up. by the way obviously the american actors and the american version of the show is WAAAAY better. dont disrespect america because we are stronger and better. That is just sad.
,1122b,2011-09-11T07:27Z,I would like to see both. that's always fun. UK has no Breaking Bad series so maybe they can buy the rights to that and the US whiners can lacerate them for doing it wrong.
,KavyaLee,2011-10-30T05:19Z,Poor Brits...look at Downton Abbey and Torchwood - big UK hits with American actors. UK TV producers know well they need a US actor to legitimize the value of their shows. Sore bunch of losers...Ha!!
,Dreadmore,2012-03-12T19:02Z,"I think your all idiots for fighting so much, America may have made the show worse but they didn't steal it so why don't you bitch at your people for selling it like some people are saying. And you stereotypical morons talking shit like I thought you guys hated us brits and you brits cant do anything as good as us are giving both countrys a bad name.. I agree about the lack of drug use though, They should not of changed that.. Also I wish it would of been Woodie Harrilson to"
