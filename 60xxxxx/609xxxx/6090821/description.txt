A very nice pack with DAZ 3D Studio environments.Since its very hard to find some environments for our DAZ Studio ive decided to upload and share.The pack contain environments installers for DAZ 3D Studio (not tested on Poser but should work too) very easy and fast to install files.

All you have to do is to locate your "content" folder from DAZ app. folder and start installation.(ex. "D:\DAZ 3D STUDIO\content")

The environments can found in DAZ started application most in "Figures" but also can be found on other menus too, important is to see all "Environment" menu tree.
If you cant see easy your new scenes, you can select to reset Database and to start a scan for content to auto sort files.

One of my hobbies is computer graphic and i can tell you, you create great 3D images with these environments,with a Character (lets say Victoria 4 dessed on gothic outfit near cemetery or a mermaid in underwater)
Let your imaginaton free and start to create new and beautifull 3D images (rendered) with these amazing environment scenes/backgrounds : woodlands,forest,winter,cemetery,nights in forest,underwater...

Installers are clean (no alerts on AVG) but feel free to scan ,rescan , send to www.virustotal.com for online scan (max 10mb),whatever.

Enjoy these amazing backgrounds and please seed as much as you can..

Thank you.
