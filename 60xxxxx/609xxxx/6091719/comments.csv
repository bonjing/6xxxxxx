[V],twentyforty,2011-01-09T18:27Z,Are all so slow or have blocked my server with PeerBlock?
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-09T18:48Z,"@skillet92: Well, it looks like your generous offer is not needed. There is 14 active peers and they ALL together pull ~500 kB/s from my server (under 5% of server capacity)."
,dark_defender,2011-01-09T20:27Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for your encodes and uploads. I would request you to include ""Hustle"" in your TV shows list. 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379632/

Its a great TV series. If you haven't watched it yet, watch and decide for yourself. Only 6 episodes per season."
,funpigj,2011-01-09T20:55Z,"Hey 20, thanks for all your efforts!!  Late last year you were posting your release schedule.  With the new shows coming out, can you do that again?  Are you going to pick up Spartacus and Shameless?"
,mjkuyu,2011-01-09T22:34Z,"@ 20-40

Thanks for this great uploads.....

concur with dark_defender, Hustle is definitely a show to encode. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-09T23:10Z,"@dark_defender: I watched two seasons, but now - it cannot be included in my encoding schedule. No pun intended, I am sure that I encode shows which are ""below"" my personal horizon, but anything I do have some reasoning behind, which, in turn, I need not to explain. 

Whoever wants something I don't carry can go direction [eztv] or TVteam and find there what's needed.

Guys - frankly - I do understand you and I do sympathize - but for sake-of-old-invisible-bearded-man-in-clouds - do not push me further.

I barely cope with things as they are, regardless of my own condition, and I begged for relief and not for making burden bigger.

Please."
,azrielle,2011-01-09T23:14Z,Thank you for House of Annubis--I keep missing the 2nd and 3rd episodes!

,dark_defender,2011-01-10T14:32Z,"@twentyforty: We all are already grateful to you with what you do for us. If you are not doing something on our request, its absolutely fine by us.

It was just a request which was declined because of genuine reasons, fair enough."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-10T16:35Z,@DMVIN: Cape - Yes. Announced that before Christmas.
,DMVIN,2011-01-11T04:35Z,thanks 20-40
