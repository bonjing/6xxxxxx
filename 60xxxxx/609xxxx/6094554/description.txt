This is a most refreshing performance of Mozart's miraculous score. The soloists are superb, especially Gens, and the sound of the period orchestra gives an added pungency to the humour of the piece. Jacobs is, as ever, unconventional, but succeeds in giving us not Mozart the beautiful boy but Mozart the subversive Enlightenment composer. Just listen in wonder at page after page of the most beautiful and exquisitely shaped melodies ever written.
