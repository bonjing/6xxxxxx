Apparently there are two more tracks, according to wikipedia.

# ""Huge Misunderstanding (iTunes Bonus Track)"" - 2:38

# ""The Federal Funding March (iTunes Preorder Bonus Track)"" - 3:36

Really goddamn annoying that I can't even buy the last song anymore. Hopefully someone who preordered can u/l it."

,IamFlac,2011-09-25T03:02Z,"blackhawks47, you won't find iTunes bonus tracks here because they only sell lossy tracks and this is a FLAC DL, although the cue sheet and log aren't included..."
