Showroom of Compassion is the name of the sixth full-length studio album from the band Cake, scheduled to be released on January 11, 2011.[1] This will be their first album since the release of Pressure Chief in 2004, the longest gap to date between two consecutive Cake studio albums. John McCrea stated that this album will sound "very different." He said he allowed acoustic piano on the LP, which he had never done because he thought it sounded "too classy." He also said this is the first time he has allowed reverb, which he thought too many bands used to sound "grandiose." [2]
