Episode 01. Spartacus
Was Spartacus the dimple-chinned freedom fighter of that famous movie? We take a look at Spartacus as he really was â€“ a brilliant leader of a guerrilla band, but also a flawed and indecisive human being.

Episode 02. Attila The Hun
Part genius, part psychopath, Attila is unlike the other Huns. He is a calculating, ruthless gambler who relies on his brilliance as a warrior to seek conquest.

Episode 03. Shogun
Tokugawa Ieyasu is the towering figure of Japanese history. He is Oliver Cromwell, Richard The Lionheart and Alfred The Great combined â€“ the man who overthrew the governing dynasty of Japan and established a regime that would last for centuries.

Episode 04. Richard the Lionheart
Was Richard the Lionheart a heroic warrior, noble and wise? Or was he just a greedy thug who wanted to loot the Holy Land and seek glory by defeating the brilliant warlord Saladin? Itâ€™s the epic story of Richard and the Third Crusade.

Episode 05. Cortes
Cortesâ€™ strengths were his imagination and breathtaking audacity. His flaws were deceit and hypocrisy. Little by little he is torn apart as his conscience strives to square his love of God with his love of gold.

Episode 06. Napoleon Bonaparte
How did a penniless French soldier rise to create the most powerful empire since the Romans? Napoleon Bonaparte himself wrote that the answer lay at the siege of Toulon in 1793. It was at Toulon that Franceâ€™s leaders first recognized his tactical genius.
