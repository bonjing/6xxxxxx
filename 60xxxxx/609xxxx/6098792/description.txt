           A documentary filmmaker follows a model for several            
           years, chronicling her rise from a fresh face to one that      
           adorns billboards and magazines around the world. Go           
           behind the scenes and chronicle the glitzy world of high       
           fashion modeling, from photo shoots with celebrated            
           photographers to runway shows in New York, Milan, and          
           Paris.
