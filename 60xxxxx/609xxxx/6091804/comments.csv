,iMacAppleWindows,2011-01-09T21:45Z,Here it has finished loading. Thank you very much. But there is a way to get an update or have to do that manually? Because there is always room for progress for the apps.
[T],droidip,2011-01-09T22:22Z,"@iMacAppleWindows isnt the game says a new update is avaible or it wont update with App store = its not possible. 
But maybe I will upload it again if its a big update, like 1.0 > 1.5. "
