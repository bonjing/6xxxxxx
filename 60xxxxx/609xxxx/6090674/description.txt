Energy and Climate: Science for Citizens in the Age of Global Warming-
(10 lectures, 45 minutes/lecture)
Course No. 154

Taught by Richard Wolfson
Middlebury College
Ph.D., Dartmouth College

Is global warming actually happening? Could it really threaten civilization? 
How much money are we willing to spend on alternate fuels? Should we 
use technologies that involve other risks (like nuclear power)? 

Professor and physicist Richard Wolfson's course will allow you to form 
answers to those questionsâ€”answers that are grounded in scientific facts. 
You do not need a background in science to understand these issues as 
he presents them. 

Using simple diagrams and graphics, Professor Wolfson makes his subject 
both lively and accessible as he explains how the Earth's climate regulates 
temperature, how human activity can unbalance this system, how scientists 
predict the extent and impact of global warming, and what we can do 
about it. 

This course examines human energy use and global warming and offers 
a basic literacy in the science of climate.
