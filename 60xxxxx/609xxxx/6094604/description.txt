Written and Read By: George Carlin

A hilarious collection of razor-sharp observations on sports, politics, news, food and just about everything under the sun from multi-New York Times Bestseller George Carlin. A thinking person's comic who uses words as weapons, Carlin demolishes everyday values with intelligence, wit and downright hilarity. Tirades, rants, screeds, thoughts, musings, lists, monologues, assertions, assumptions and a whole host of auxiliary verbal ordnance take the world apart and leave the reader gasping for more.
