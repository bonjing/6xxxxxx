,attakr,2011-02-22T23:23Z,Do you need to burn it onto a CD or is it a no CD crack?
,xanonymous,2011-04-26T22:58Z,"It's the official DVD release that allows playing without the disk, so no need to crack. System requirements are minimal and the game runs on anything from Win2k up to Win7sp1 x64. On Xfire you can still find plenty of servers to play online. The included mods are awesome, each one is like a new game!"

MULTIPLAYER ---> INTERNET ---> Replace 000.000.000.000:0000 with 213.65.180.8 ---> ADD"
