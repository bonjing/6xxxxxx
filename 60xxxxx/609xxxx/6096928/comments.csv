,blflshr,2011-06-29T04:04Z,"FYI, the songs have different bitrates ranging from 64 kbps â 225 kbps. Not quite."
,ankaraal,2011-07-05T19:30Z,"not a personal attack on the UL, but, this torrent contains files of very questionable audio quality. 4 at 64kbs, 2 at 128kbs, 1 at 160kbs and the rest bar 1 at 192kbs. poor torrent. with modern hard drives and internet connections, there is no reason to use less than 320kbs when ripping CDs, FLAC is preferable.
