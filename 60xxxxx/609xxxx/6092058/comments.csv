[T],scenetime55,2011-01-19T20:56Z,if you guys know how to update your cards this will work fine. but if your like cainmosnimirrored then dont bother even downloading it. your stupidity isnt my problem
,drewkrew,2011-01-27T20:32Z,"so what your saying ""cainmosnimirored"" is that ur a selfish moron and it didn't suit ""your"" needs so its a waste of time.

Well thats a damn lame attitude.

YES: it does work fine.

Educate yourself before you put comments like that, it's just plain ungrateful. After all, why should this guy put stuff up to share with everyone? What does he get for his time and effort? Credit due, as if it wasn't for people like him YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DOWNLOAD!

Gee!
