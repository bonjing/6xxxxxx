,krisdes,2011-01-09T01:40Z,so how's my first torrent?
,erroneus,2011-01-09T02:29Z,incomplete so far :)
,hotwiredj,2011-01-09T03:47Z,"The only thing I would suggest is to put HDTV in the title.  My episode downloader would not automatically download this because it tries to match ""HD"" and ""720p"" in the title.  I'm sure more than a few people use this same setup.  Thanks for the up BTW!"
,krisdes,2011-01-09T03:53Z,"@hotwiredj
ok I will put SxxExx HDTV 720p into the title.

Gonna seed at 5.8 MB/s (bytes) :)"

Hopefully it will be complete soon. Gonna seed at 5.8 MB/s (bytes) :)"
,erroneus,2011-01-09T03:55Z,"I much prefer this later release.  It seems it does not have the ""New Episode"" markings.  The fewer markings the better."
,krisdes,2011-01-09T05:33Z,"@erroneus
Sorry, I should have put this in the description. This is not my release. I'm just reuploading a direct download because I didn't see this uploaded as a torrent."
,lgnd91,2011-01-09T19:58Z,Thanks for the 720p version!
