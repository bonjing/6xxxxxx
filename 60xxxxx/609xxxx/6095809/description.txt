Release Notes:
I had a slight problem when capturing these episodes when they aired so approximately the first 2 minutes and 31.5 seconds of the video are from the SD channel. The SD channel crops shows instead of letterboxing them so I had to add borders to the left and right sides of the video (screenshots included) to match the ar and res. of the HD sourced video. As you can tell, the majority of the video is HD sourced but you might notice a very slight jump when shifting from SD to HD (00:02:31). It's nothing major and perfectly watchable. However, if there's a problem with that, kindly message me with the time of the Nick HD re-run and I will gladly release a v2. The titles are "House of Discovery; House of Hyper" and they constitute episodes 09 and 10. Sorry for any inconvenience and thanks for the understanding. Enjoy!
