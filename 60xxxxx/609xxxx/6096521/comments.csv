,DETgamer313,2011-01-28T21:45Z,"This game downloaded just fine but out of all the games I downloaded & burnt so far this is this only one where it asks for a ""console update"" in order for it to be playable. Will this do any harm to my xbox 360 b/c it has been modded!? I recently had my xbox modded so it's the latest firmware. Is this safe to play. I don't have xbox Live either so I'm not worried about getting banned or anything like that. Please respond whenever you get a second. THANKS!"
