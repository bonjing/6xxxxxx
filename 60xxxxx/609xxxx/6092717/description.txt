First off, this is an excellent record which I would normally highly recommend. However, the collector's edition is, in my opinion, a much better choice. 
As far as the actual music goes, it is by far one of my favorites. The live recordings capture the energy of AC/DC very well. In fact, I generally prefer the live versions to their original recorded versions. For anyone who is even marginally an AC/DC fan, or even just curious, the AC/DC live is a must have. 
That said, the collectors edition's regular price is only an additional $4 (at the writing of this review it is discounted to $16.00). That additional $4 provides 9 extra songs which are not included on the one disc version. Therefore, it seems pointless to buy the one disc version. 
Like I said, AC/DC is an amazing band, and their live recordings are even better. I just can't recommend this CD when a far better alternative exists.
