,flsocialist,2011-03-29T14:35Z,Someone is watching this Torrent. Got a notice of action on a DMCA 2 days after I downloaded it. Just a heads up for everyone
,pumpkin420,2011-08-15T01:48Z,"Good quality audio and video, however, the movie is a terrible adaptation of the book. The book is excellent, the movie awful. Thanks for the upload."
,spidal,2011-10-14T20:23Z,This is being watched by Paramount. Warning sent by them to me via my ISP!!!
,NuNu12,2012-02-25T00:33Z,"This is probably the only upload on TPB with English dialogue and English hard-encoded subtitles for the parts spoken in French. I wish the video quality was clearer but thank you so much for this rip!
