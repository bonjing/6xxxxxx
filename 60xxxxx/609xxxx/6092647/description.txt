PLOT:


In this case, a group of archaeologists and combat experts led by Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor use a "3-D fax machine" (so much for technobabble!) to time-travel back to France in 1357, in hopes of retrieving Walker's father and returning safely to the present. No such luck! Fending for themselves against marauding hordes of medieval French warriors at war with the invading British, these semi-intrepid travelers find their body count rising, and the deadline for their return home is rapidly approaching.

Popular action star Paul Walker (The Fast And The Furious) leads an ensemble cast as a group of young archaeologists who confront the intrigue-and perils- of time travel in Timeline, "...an unforgettable thrill ride..." directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) and based on the best selling novel by Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park). While excavating in the Dordogne Valley of France, a scientific research team's new invention, a time-travel machine, has inadvertently sent archaeology professor Edward Johnston (Billy Connolly, The Last Samurai) back to 14th century France...and ha landed him in the middle of the raging Hundred Years War between the French and English. Johnston's only chance for rescue lies in the hands of his son Chris (Walker), his assistant professor Andre Marek (Gerard Butler, Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life), and several of his students. The intrepid time travelers must make the same treacherous journey and, with the deadline of only eight hours now ticking away, must navigate through the hostile, war-torn territory and retrieve the professor before he's lost to history forever.
