,Mr_Gamer,2011-01-20T12:13Z,"Damn. Where is the 550mb Hi-Def TV-Rip from ""DIMENSION""? Yeah, 175mb is watchable, but come on! 

We live in 2011 now, we have broadband and hi-def monitors! We also have the disk-space.

Plus, *.AVI is so outdated, *.MKV is the way to go!

You can have an AVI and an MKV of equal size, but MKV is at least doubble the quality.

I know it's an encapsulation format, but the dudes that code their movies in MKV know what they are doing. 

Yes, there are crappy MKV, but I generally regard it as supperior. If it's crappy, it's the guy that coded it."
