The problem could be that you entered the serial number in step 1. You should install it as a trial and enter the serial number in step 4."

,smcg23,2011-02-04T17:47Z,"Hi Cyberpiraten

First of all, thanks so much for this torrent.

Just wondered if you can help....each time i try to start DW, it says serial number invalid.  I've run the blocker as administrator, run DW as administrator but it still happens whenever i start it up.  I've used 3 or 4 different serial numbers and currently using as a trial at the moment. Do i have to run the blocker, then restart the computer, and then try to start the program?  Apologies if this has been answered.  Thanks."
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-02-04T18:36Z,"1 Run activation blocker (Important to run as admin) 
2. Restart. 
3. Enter serial. ;) 
Enjoy! "
,skwiddz,2011-02-05T12:35Z,"Hey there Cyberpiraten

I downloaded the torrent fine and all but when I go to install it and I click install as trial and continue it gets to about 19% done (when it says it's installing adobe help) and then just stops. The time remaining just keeps going up but the progress bar and the percentage stays the same, I have even left my computer on all night and nothing has changed. I'm probably just doing something extremely noobish wrong, but I can't seem to find out what, any idea?

Thanks man."
,Mystik445,2011-02-09T21:34Z,"@For all who downloaded this. Im sure your a web developer, and i need help with something. Does anyone know to code a search bar that searches your websites and displays results on a seperate page?
Any help would be much appreciated because i couldnt find answers on google.




From what i can understand this is a complex proccess sorta, for a beginner anyway, so i highly suggest that the reason you couldn't find the answer through google is probably because you don't understand what is being said, sorry but its not as easy as just BAM heres a search button, i wish it was though hehe, sorry i couldn't be more help bud!


p.s. Thanks for the torrent man!"

,hoshikogen,2011-02-18T21:22Z,I followed all the steps and the serials didn't work & it locked me out. I had to uninstall it :(
,spsthedestroyer,2011-02-19T17:21Z,"ok, I installed it and, I hope I'm doing this right, cause now I get the trial thing with 30 days on it. Was it supposed to skip that now on start up or do I treat it as the trial and go from there?"
,khunrah,2011-02-20T18:55Z,"Great! It works also with the free trial version from the adobe website. Just start the installation and enter the serial. But don't register! Then run ""Activation Blocker"". After a restart there is no nag screen...

,drdominic,2011-02-20T19:34Z,Just wondering if anyone else ran into the problem of requireing a 24 digit serial but the serials in the torrent are only 20 digits. Could use a little help with this one...aside from this THANX for the awesome download!
,ksiads,2011-02-25T17:16Z,"Many, MANY thanks, Cyberpiraten!  Works like a charm.

Question: After install I got notification that updates were available.  Should I, or shouldn't I?"
,freddyjmondra,2011-02-25T19:50Z,"I can't seem to get it to work. I've tried many different methods, this is what i do.
1.Make sure no left over DW CS5 files on computer.
2. Install ""Dreamweaver Install"", now their is a ""Adobe CS5"" folder on desktop.
3. Run ""Activation Blocker"", then Restart Comp, also done it without Restarting Comp.
4.Run Dreamweaver ""Set-up"" inside Adobe CS5 Folder. Input Serial #, 2 of 3 do work at this point. Finish rest of installation.
5. Open up Dreamweaver, get the invalid Code, or try trail version, so far I'm at 29 days cause i still haven't gotten to work, even though i tried Running ""Activation Blocker"", then restarting and trying to enter code at trail screen but none of them work. I'm currently on a win 7 32 bit Pirated, but i do run a vista 64 bit and idk if that could inter fear."
,hdknock,2011-02-25T21:20Z,Works great!  Thanks man.

i am running the blocker as admin on win7 32bit. 

i skipped the page asking for adobe details but that just continues the trial.

I think the host files mustn't of modified.

Can you type the instructions step by step as there are 3 points where its possible to enter a serial code.

,indogeek,2011-09-06T06:42Z,"I was having problems installing, I kept getting the Adobe ID stuff. Anyway I do actually have a Adobe ID as I have used their trials before so I thought that maybe that was interfering somehow. So here is the solution download the Adobe creative suite clean up tool follow the instuctions and you will be able to then install your DW with any issues."

,base742,2012-06-02T13:53Z,"I tried everything. But i am still having problems. The first time i downloaded and what not, it worked perfectly. Then i closed out of it and opened dreamweaver again the next day. and when i did that, a prompter opened and told me that the serial was invalid. so i just exited out of it. then did nearly everything, everybody has said to do. still doesn't work. it just keeps saying, after i enter the serial, that the serial is for a subscription edition. and i put in all three. only two of them worked and showed that. and after i entered the serial and clicked next it required me to enter an adobe id/password. i made one and entered it. then it just said invalid. just kept saying that. im thinking it might be because the serial is linked to one specific acccount. im not sure. -------but please somebody help me!!!----------"
