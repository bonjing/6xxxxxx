,kmankm,2011-01-17T17:42Z,"lodestar738
can you turn on the GPU(ground power unit) in this?
I already have PIC737 but have to switch on the damn APU for preflight, leads to fuel imbalance by the time i take off"
,lodestar738,2011-01-17T18:47Z,"This is from Felthere suport forum, starting from cold & dark :
1set the parking brake.
2.wait 30-60 seconds.
3.when GPU available connect to aircraft.

I tried and works, after 1min just click over groun power buton  
"
,kmankm,2011-01-17T19:32Z,"yes i try that technique every time i use it, for some strange reason i am the only one with this problem using:

,CptReview,2012-05-26T18:03Z,"TORRENT works like a charm. No errors were found, comes with a lot of liveries and so far I'm satisfied. However, If you are getting this for FSX do not install ""f1_fsx_vcrainfix"" and that it. Thank you lodestar for this great torrent. :)"
