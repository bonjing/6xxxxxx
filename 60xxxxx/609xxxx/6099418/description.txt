PIC 737(300, 400, and 500) + Liveries
 I have not found vorking version of Feelthere / Wilco PIC 737 on TPB. This is a version from Just Flight DVD,  I tested this 737, every switch is working, working gauges and no problem at all on my system (windows 7, 64 bit)

1.Open Folder "737 PIC"
2.Unrar 737 PIC.rar - You will get iso file "737 PIC.iso" 
3.Mount "737 PIC.iso" to virtual drive
4.Go to virtual drive, open it and run "start.exe" (looks like an arrow)
5.Instalation wizard will appear - just follow the instructions of instalation wizard
6.After install, for fsx run "f1_fsx_vcrainfix", or "FS9 patch" for fs9

You can burn "737 PIC.iso" to DVD and install it from DVD
