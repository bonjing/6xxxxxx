Hey, I own it on PC and bought two Fallout 3 add ons on psn before deciding to buy Oblivion GOTY and Fallout 3 GOTY on a deal on steam, so I really couldn't give a fuck what ya'll think about piracy as I feel Bethesda have got more than enough cash out of me ;)"

,Schnippshly,2011-01-21T06:13Z,"I appreciate the upload, but how are the mods supposed to work? They are just placed into the game's data folder as if it were the PC version."
,youthanasia21,2011-01-22T03:21Z,"Comfirmed working here, using kmeaw's cfw with multiman."
,RiIey,2011-01-22T07:17Z,Works great except the mods. I even tried messing with the .ini and no luck. Little help?

,jamariob,2011-01-25T18:08Z,could you upload ps3 borderlands game of the year edition that comes with all 4 dlc plz 
,AlwaysWasted,2011-01-26T04:35Z,"If this is anything like adding PC mods to Fallout which it should be you will need to put the mod in the data folder in your game and GAMES (GAMES maybe GAMEZ depends what fold your BM uses) folder after that find the .ini in your GAMES folder open it and near the top there will be a few lines that look like this

STestFile10=
STestFile9=
STestFile8=
STestFile7=
STestFile6=
STestFile5=
STestFile4=
STestFile3=
STestFile2=X
STestFile1=FalloutNV.esm

replace X with the name of the mod you picked when getting mods from other site make sure you change the .esp to .esm you can also add more STestFile lines im up to 20 on Fallout"
,AlwaysWasted,2011-01-26T04:37Z,Sry for double post i forgot to say to install the game data to the PS3 first then you can add all the mods
,Kthulu_,2011-01-26T05:44Z,"I go to ""Start New Game"" and click ""Yes"", but nothing happens!"
,Kthulu_,2011-01-26T06:26Z,"I am using the kmeaw CFW, with the LV2 v6 patch.

I copied the BLUS folder and all its contents to GAMES (what MultiMan uses)

Then I open up MultiMan and select the game, and then set access permissions

I go to the XMB and the game boots up fine, but when I get to the main menu and click ""New Game"" I select yes but nothing happens- I just remain in the menu....

Help?

Well, when I get it, will seed with higher upload speeds."
