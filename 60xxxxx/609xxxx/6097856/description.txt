From the artist who brought us the award-winning CD, Scenic Listening, comes Woods much anticipated second album, Sacred. Gregorian Chant and various ancient voices are artfully woven to channel the wisdom of the ages. Perfectly blended with beautiful piano and string melodies guided by energizing rhythms, Woods music will take you to a place that is, above all . . . Sacred.
