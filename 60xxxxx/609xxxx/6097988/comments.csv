,RedDog007,2011-05-10T14:02Z,This really works. I just installed it and tested it on the movie The Fighter (2010) and it ripped it. I mean I did a exact copy of the dvd. Now I need a good burning software that works. Nero 10 is a joke on here. Will not recognize any files. Great job bigwimpie. Thank you kindly.
