kendra.s01e10.undress.rehearsal.ws.dsr.xvid-dvsky.avi
and
kendra.s01e11.let.them.eat.wedding.cake.hdtv.xvid-cast.avi

The first of those two is eps 10-11 ""Undress Rehearsal"" and ""Let Them Eat Wedding Cake"" combined.
The second file is ep 12 ""Keepin' it Real.""

So the season is complete.  Thanks FaMoUz!"
