I thought the audio was a 1 at first when using MP classic HC edition, clicking and static.  I tried VLC next and the audio was perfect :)"

,Gunvald89,2011-08-10T13:58Z,Why 2 channels sound? That makes this torrent worthless.
,nikisby,2011-08-21T11:19Z,"NO SUBTITLES
Please remove ""Subtitles: Yes"" from the infomation."

,akshay310,2011-08-22T23:37Z,I have been trying to play this movie on my Mac. I have tried playing it in VLC as well as Mplayer. On Mplayer the video is really lagging behind the sound and is running in slow motion. On VLC is fails to play beyond 5 seconds. Can anyone please help ? 
,luckyu90,2011-09-08T15:01Z,"it ran smoothly in vlc for me. I dont know abt mplayer or the other. its an excellent quality bt i didn't like the movie. I thought it'd be a good movie,bt i didn't lyk the concept.

Lesbian Family? i never heard such a thing. i'm sorry guys i didn't say this to offend any1. If i did i'm really sorry"

,nomad169,2012-01-21T06:51Z,"Thanks uploader.. will comment and quality and seed 1:1.. 
Downloading it now and Got something to say to all the assholes who complain. 

Everyone (excluding the aforementioned assholes) know that its not a true 720p.. 32pixels short.. 

and 113maddog there is something called bit rate.. Google it.. The higher the bit rate, larger is the file.. and comment after downloading.. not before..

He has not uploaded it to please you.. if you got something positive to say about it, say it.. if not, dont.. you can comment on quality in the following way sans your bullshit or horseshit for that matter
A - 
V - 
M - "
