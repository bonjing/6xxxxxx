You don’t need to have any of the previous updates installed,
as this update is featuring all previous updated content."
,Spartan_,2011-01-09T12:07Z,Wow good work indeed such a pro Pirate
,Macimate,2011-01-10T07:08Z,"Good upload, BUT this game is still bug-ridden as fuck. 50 % of people with GOOD computers get crashes after the rennaisance era. Huge resource-hog this game for some reason. A really piss poor job by 2K."
,Antediluvian_X,2011-01-11T23:44Z,Would someone please update the latest version of the Civilization V SDK? Old one doesnt seem to work. Thanks in advance
,zombiewarpigs,2011-01-13T03:58Z,Can someone please tell me how to use the worldbuilder please.
,JohanLickey,2011-01-14T16:18Z,"Can i play multiplayer on LAN with this update? I have never tried to, and i really want to, so please help!"
,JohanLickey,2011-01-14T16:27Z,Can i play multiplayer on LAN with this update? Please help!
,DMaarten1,2011-01-15T16:16Z,"PLEAASSSSSE just try it out PLEASSSSEE HEEELLPPP!! god, that is SO annoying."
,atillam,2011-01-17T13:26Z,"I have installed this update on clean new installed Engslih game, then some parts of game (like Tech Tree) became fuckin French. I don't know why but I will reinstall game with previous patch."
,zombiewarpigs,2011-01-18T02:31Z,"Dmaarten wtf are you talking about?

I asked for help to get the old world builder to work with this patch and thats annoying to you?"
,lobo345,2011-01-18T23:36Z,Works great with original SKIDROW release.
,Macimate,2011-01-19T12:04Z,"@ atillam
Make a clean install of the game. Install the game, now for the important part: Even though you probably don't think it's necessary, you have to copy the content from the crack folder to the game directory before updating the game. After you've installed this latest update make sure to copy the cracked content from it ofcourse.."
,Macimate,2011-01-19T12:06Z,"BTW, to anyone from SKIDROW hopefully reading, there's a new update coming out TODAY. This update should address most of the issues with the huge map crashes that so many have been experiencing. Great job so far on these updates SKIDROW :)"
,cyp2il,2011-01-19T12:48Z,How do you check which version number you're currently running?
,Macimate,2011-01-19T19:58Z,New update is released on steam
,monoolho,2011-01-20T02:26Z,"I really ask you guys to update the SDK, it's outdated so it does not work with new versions, gives a ""Unknown argument type in message EnableMod"" and some others, so it just crashes. Please update it, we might be pirates, but we also have love in our hearts to waste on maps and mods for cool games."
,GleenCross,2011-01-20T03:33Z,"I am the only one who get this problem? It seems like the textures of the Spanish Civilization are not correct displayed Ãµ.o show this way when I start the game: ""Unable to load texture [Assets/UI/Art/Logos/logo_fork.dds]"" and ""Unable to load texture [Assets/UI/Art/Logos/logo_granny.dds]"".

I check the game and the Inca Civ have the same logo of Spain... lol Somebody know how I resolve this problem? =)"
,afa2000,2011-01-20T20:06Z,Is it just me or game takes much longer to load ? 2 times slower now.
,GleenCross,2011-01-21T02:33Z,"Well, I will tray to ""extract"" the textures of the previus update (Update 3 to 5) and see if works out =)

Still, I have the same problem of atillam... the thec tree was showing in french xD If i dont like the mongolian civ that much, i would not be trying this ""hard"" to get this work properlly, these days I play with them... man, so powerful and ""imbalanced"" compared with the others Civ, theres none better to make war than the Mongols =) 

Ultimately, for the record, the only bad things in this update: the french thing, the bug in the textures (I will tray to fix it myself) and, another thing i remembered now, the ""Civ Screen"" that shows before every save game.. When I try a new game with the mongols the screem do not apear =) Only the voice of the narrator with the statue of the inicial screen in the back. 

Still have some issues but the game is playable, and was improved a little (the bugs and lags decreased, but still have a lot to work 2K.. the things are becoming better)... You people can give I try, but the update is not 100%.. its missing some little things =)"
,Zero_G,2011-01-26T01:10Z,I can't get it. Everytime I install it it tells me I have missing .dlls. Help?
,JonMcGuirk,2011-01-27T03:57Z,"@GleenCross - not sure if you have the SKIDROW version of the game itself; inside the 'Sid Meiers Civilization V-SKIDROW' folder is a SKIDROW folder, and inside of that should be a folder called 'assets'.  Navigate to 'UI/Arts', and inside the Arts folder should be a Logos folder.  That folder has the missing .dds files.  You can just copy the entire Logos folder over to your install directory.  It can go in your game directory Assets/UI/Arts folder."
,Plausebol,2011-01-27T13:14Z,@Zero_G: Have you tried installing the game first? http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5850233
,orgzon,2011-02-02T22:54Z,"Do I need to extract all of the winRAR files? And where do I copy the files to? I'm sorry, I'm new to torrents..."
,JonMcGuirk,2011-02-03T00:20Z,"@orgzon, yeah, extract all the rar files at once.  You should end up with a SKIDROW folder and the update .exe file"
,[SIC],2011-02-21T17:55Z,"Anyone got a solution to the ""insert civ v disc - retry, cancel, continue"" during gameplay problem?"
,oICU8it2,2011-03-09T15:57Z,"Okay, there are 21 winrar files in this torrent..... which one do I unpack?"
,oICU8it2,2011-03-12T09:38Z,The answer to my question: Select one of the rar files included activate it then move up one folder in winrar select all of them and unpack :P

,Titouf2609,2011-05-07T10:51Z,Did anyone manage to get the LAN working ? I read somewhere that you have to change the name which is actually SKIDROW. But I couldn't find more information about it. I don't now how you can change it ! Could someone help me please ? BTW this game and all these updates work great ! Thanks SKIDROW :) And thanks to the TPB community :)
,genocide79,2011-05-10T23:37Z,"there are new civilization V update 8 and DLC Vikings now  available can you please upload them, thanks"
