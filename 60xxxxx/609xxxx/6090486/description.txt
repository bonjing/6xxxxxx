Sid Meier's Civilization V Update 6

RELEASE DATE: 08-01-2011 PROTECTION: Steam + CEG
GAME TYPE: Strategy DISKS: CRACKED UPDATE

Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible
