,valkry101,2011-01-16T16:29Z,"I think this might be a good work around for now until. Some one crack this properly, I stumbled upon this accidentally this was provided by some guy named UT.

Thank you very much UT and Neo300x it works.

Here are the steps to get this 6.04 working.

1. Install the App. and don't run it close all IDM instances if it's running.

2. Now open notepad if using Win7 or Vista right click on the notepad icon then select ""Run As Administrator"".

3. Now browse to you system host file. Follow this path ""C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc"" also switch to all files from .txt in file format area.

4. Insert these two lines in to host file 

    127.0.0.1 http://internetdownloadmanager.com

    127.0.0.1 www.internetdownloadmanager.com

4. Save the file

5. Close notepad

6. Done

You can now enjoy the latest release of IDM with out getting that nag screen and shutting it self down.

Don't upgrade when you try to upgrade it'll give you a error but ignore it 'cos you IDM is working.

Happy Downloading all IDM fans."
