,xxmohxx,2011-02-15T22:49Z,I downloaded CDex to rip the tool albums I bought yesterday... and I used the same encoder and tags why doesn't the album cover show up?

,ihatec0d,2011-05-08T03:26Z,"Merkaba, on Salival, isn't the right song. Merkaba is supposed to be an annoying set of noises, this version places it as a beautiful live piece of artwork. I appreciate the change, and I love this song, but could someone tell me what song this actually is? It is definitely tool, but what song is it? Is it a cover, or what?"
