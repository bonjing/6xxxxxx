Notes: The Arkansas-born Lowery moved to California in 1956. Living in Santa Cruz, he began playing at parties and on the street. In 1974 he made his first major public appearance at the San Francisco Blues Festival and soon afterwards cut some singles for the Blues Connoisseur label. His high, clear voice, versatility on guitar and propensity for composing original blues made him one of the most attractive younger artists playing old fashioned blues to emerge in the '70s.
This, his second album is more cautious and, perhaps not coincidentally, more successful. Genre standards like J.L. Hooker's' Hobo Blues' and Muddy Waters's 'Louisiana Blues' are enhanced by his close partnership with Thrasher, an excellent harmonica player, and the two men prolong their winning streak on Lowery's own 'Snake Hippin' Mama' and 'My Baby's Callin' Me'. A couple Robert Johnson songs are adequately done. This is very interesting acoustic music.
