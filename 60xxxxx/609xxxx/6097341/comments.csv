The Latest is 1.5.1! Which includes:
- Ham â€˜Em High â€“ 30 new levels
- New Golden Eggs. I would presume there are three: #18, #19 and the Super Bowl / Rio Golden Egg.
- The ability to switch into â€œwindowedâ€ mode from the main screen (click the settings icon under the â€œPlayâ€ button)
- A new and improved pause menu.
- Bug fixes


PLEASE ANYONE! UPLOAD THE LATEST VERSION!"
