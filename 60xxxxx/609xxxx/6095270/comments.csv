,eguatpatto,2011-01-17T06:34Z,"Yeh, what's up I cannot get the last 6 Megs like smudgethecat. But leechers have already got a Gigabit of mine. 
What is going on?"
,Mr.Wizard159753,2011-01-27T19:52Z,"I don't understand why you can't get the last 6 megs.  My computer says I've seeded 100% (times 7).  That is, at least 7 people have 100% of the file and are seeding it to others.  I have reopened my seed and am now seeding it some more. "
,Mr.Wizard159753,2011-01-27T20:30Z,"Well, I just finished downloading my own torrent and I was able to get 100% of it ... and it was working perfectly.  So, for those having trouble getting the last 6 megs ... I don't know what to tell you.  

It worked for me."
