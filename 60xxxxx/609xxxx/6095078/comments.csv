The only one seems to be fairly reliable regarding is Bone.  I keep having to download his torrent just for the sub files.  Appreciate if you can make sure your sub folder is complete. Thanks

btw, scenebalance seems to also have problem with a lot of time don't even have a sub folder included when the release does have sub."
