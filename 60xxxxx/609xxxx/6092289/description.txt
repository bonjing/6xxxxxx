Only my 2nd torrent, so tell me what ya think, but be polite about it.

Quality, most 320kbps, 700 miles is 192, So I Need You Acoustic on Better Life is 128, could not find a higher bit rate for original, but its also a low quality recording, and anything higher would really just make the file needlesly larger.

All album art is 500x500

Five studio albums, including thier original Demo

1. Self-Titled Demo
2. The Better Life
3. Away From The Sun (UK Release)
4. 17 Days (UK Bonus tracks)
5. 3 Doors Down (Self-Titled) (Bonus Tracks)

Five Singles

4. Champion In Me
5. Shine

Three EP's

And last but not least thier only sound track appearence, (that I know of anyway)

*= Note 1, Track 2 here was very dificult to obtain.
**=Note 2, This EP was originally only available at the release date of 17 Days and was a Best Buy Bonus with purchase of 17 Days, but Amazon has recently started offering it for download only.
