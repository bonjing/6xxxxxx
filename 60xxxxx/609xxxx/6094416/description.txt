"This is a special version of Vinux 3.0 made for the GNU/FSF which does not contain any non-free software.  It is built from Ubuntu using the 'free software only' option and I have removed any non-free packages as well as excluding them from the EasyInstall scripts. It does however use the same standard Ubuntu repositories and the default kernel as the main edition."
