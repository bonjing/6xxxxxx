,Marcelemental,2011-06-22T18:05Z,in fact when i start up windows a message with appdata/winbooter starts in cmd and i think it's veryyyy suspicious
,Marcelemental,2011-06-23T18:09Z,"for the ones who want to delete the winbooterr/svchost.exe (trojan),firstly go to application data on your user and set from tools,folder options to see all all hidden files,extentions,all.Winbooter will appear.Press shift+delete and that's all"
,TheLeecherKing,2011-08-14T11:51Z,Game runs fine but it has winbooterr.exe trojan which the owner of torrent (apparently) included inside samp.exe which autoruns at computer starts!
,dtrain255,2012-06-21T23:12Z,For those of you who say that the mutiplayer doesn't work you should learn to update it to the newest version. I have downloaded this torrent before and it was fine for me. All i needed to do was update mta to the newest and it was fine.
