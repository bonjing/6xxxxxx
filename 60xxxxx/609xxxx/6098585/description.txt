Hail To The Thief Ã© o sexto Ã¡lbum de estÃºdio da banda Radiohead, lanÃ§ado a 9 de Junho de 2003.

Ã‰ uma alusÃ£o clara a algumas faixas do disco que vazaram na internet antes do lanÃ§amento oficial e tambÃ©m uma crÃ­tica a George W. Bush. O Ã¡lbum segue a linha dos dois discos anteriores Kid A e Amnesiac com sons experimentais e melancÃ³licos, adicionando as guitarras da fase de OK Computer. O resultado Ã© uma espÃ©cie de resumo do que o Radiohead jÃ¡ fez em mais de 10 anos de existÃªncia.

Hail to the Thief is the sixth studio album by English alternative rock band Radiohead, released in June 2003. After two Radiohead albums that featured heavily processed vocals, less guitar, and strong influence from experimental electronica and jazz, Hail to the Thief was seen as a slight return to the band's older alternative rock influences, drawing its sound from every era of the band's existence. Recorded relatively quickly in Los Angeles, the album was described by band members as an attempt to find a more "swaggering" sound and a relaxed recording process, in contrast to their tense sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac several years earlier.
