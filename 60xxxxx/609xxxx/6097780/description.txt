This package contains both Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 configured and ready to use on Linux. Fully tested in Ubuntu 10.04, ArchLinux and Slackware Linux.

CorkScrews are prepackaged wine prefixes inspired by the "Wine bottle" of
Crossover (cxgames.) They have been built, tested, and packaged on a 
slackware system and should run on any Linux distribution running wine.

Do not rely on wine 1.0.1 to run CorkScrews. The installer script template 
could use a little more cleaning up (and will be cleaned up before my next 
CorkScrew) but this one works and is thoroughly tested. Once the game 
is untarred run scripts will be placed in $HOME/bin.

Launch the game using the run script. Some of my more recent CorkScrews have
uninstall scripts in $HOME/bin as well, although these should not be 
executable by default I think one of them is (not sure for which game.)

I encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other games.

I also encourage you to repackage CorkScrews into distro specific packages
or add Desktop Environment friendly buttons or whatever other frilly shit you
like.
