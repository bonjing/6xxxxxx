,loki_kotomi,2011-12-28T21:53Z,ok first of still downloading so idk about a/v but to answer your question goodfilms there are several titles that have castaway as the main title including an 1986 version and a korean version....
,Land_Shark,2012-01-15T09:16Z,"Don't know about anyone else, but on my computer it was terrible quality. It stopped and started like crazy. Thanks but no thanks. If you want this movie use one of the other files."
,zorn1,2012-01-15T09:59Z,"@Land_Shark: Your equipment is failing you. Upgrade your PC. Better yet, watch this on your TV.   You wouldn't see and be able to appreciate how good the quality is otherwise."

,PauloFran,2012-06-03T15:52Z,"Video quality is not bad, but it's huge (7.9 GB) and I found a smaller one (2.59 GB) with exactly the same quality (by CODY).

Thanks anyway for sharing."
