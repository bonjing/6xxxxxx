I am David Lander, swordsman in the service of the great King            
Frederick of Whitewood.                                                  
                                                                            
A few days ago, I was sent by my lord to an audience with King Weeden    
of this land of Green Row. Trembling, King Weeden informed me that his   
townspeople have been disappearing daily. Neither the astrological       
charts nor even the kingâ€™s own oracle can explain. Green Row has         
always been a safe and charming land. Not any longer. I must find out    
what is happening to King Weedenâ€™s people, and return them.

Despite repeated refusals by their superiors, three young police         
officers were determined to tackle the problem head on. Eventually       
they created a special attack unit the only way they could â€“ they quit   
the force. Take control of one of the three ex-officers and make the     
city a place where people no longer have to walk the Streets of Rage!

aliens from the planet Funkotron. Recently they ran into a slight        
problem...                                                               
                                                                            
They were cruising in their highly funky, ultra cool, righteous          
rapmaster rocketship when Earl said heâ€™d like a shot at driving. To      
cut a long story short, the rocketship is now in pieces spread over      
the most insane planet in the galaxy â€“ planet Earth!                     
                                                                            
All they have to do now is find the ten pieces of their rocketship and   
theyâ€™re on their way. Doesnâ€™t sound so hard does it?
