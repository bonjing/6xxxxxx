,bakaonna,2011-01-10T10:44Z,Agreed about gamespot.
,motley666,2011-01-10T12:47Z,"Rated means by users, that's the number in the parenthesis but i insist on the seeding matter. Good luck to peers."

Have to appreciate the effort for seeding this big torrent..

Awesome +1"
,kostasbaleno,2011-04-04T18:11Z,i just start to download that biiig torrent. 2 weeks left :P
,TyMod,2011-08-12T22:29Z,"Great games, failed torrent.  Thanks .BONE. but you of all people should no a big torrent like this will never make it.  People will only download 1 game which means they MAY only seed that game.  So some games will never be seeded.  Plus I know your bandwidth loved having to upload all this shit. lol

Thanks but you know."
,gyuresz26,2011-12-15T11:03Z,SEED SEED PLEAS ++++
,awezcps2,2011-12-23T05:20Z,wtf this torrent sucks doesnt have even one seeder
,Tokerific,2012-03-28T07:59Z,"I'll help seed for a while BONE. What's the use of a 125MBit connection and unlimited bandwidth otherwise, already have most of these games though but seems others would like."
