,r-0987,2011-01-18T14:19Z,"Sorry for the minus, it came by mistake!!"
,bokehjoe,2011-01-28T10:29Z,"veiaxeleen: ""I think what we have here is a failure to communicate"" in the immortal words from ""Cool Hand Luke"". I believe that what was intended as a compliment on your sons name (which IS a very cool name) was turned around by his use of the word 'hell' as a descriptor. 'tylr' didn't mean any insult to you or Virgilio's name. It's just one of those 'Americanisms' that we should try to stay away from in a forum that is world-wide.  I hope this clears some of the air and 'bad juju' going in this thread. 

'pluto99'- Thanks for the up! Looking forward to it. I have seen some pretty amazing results come in very small packages. 
Thanks again!"
,sonambula,2011-01-28T19:48Z,"This download has a very nice resolution but the soundtrack is of by a beat or two, the audio track is ahead of the picture track. This drives me crazy. Is there something I can do to fix this? But very nice quality picture."
,spartanu,2011-01-30T03:16Z,"I hope, it deserve 2be downloaded....:D"
,wizzkid1970,2011-03-22T01:25Z,sonambula just use the features in vlc media player to slow don the sound track or speed it up 
,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-31T02:32Z,"quality's pretty nice, esp for the size
