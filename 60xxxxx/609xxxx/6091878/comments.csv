,Shikaku2,2011-02-04T21:28Z,"You sir are a life saver. My computer crashed and the 2 (yes two) other versions that I had did not work. It even updated after I finished and rebooted the computer. 

BTW, I thought that I noticed something about re-activating every 180days. Was that just for ""Steps 1-3""?

Thanks!!"
,zevodrog,2011-02-14T18:07Z,"@Computer-User

do you have Windows XP Full Driver Edition English?

the one uploaded here in piratebay is not an english version... pt-br language"
,Praetor_,2011-02-15T10:31Z,"Hi Computer-User

I am wondering if you have any idea why after I install XP completely then follow the Steps 1-3 I get a Geographically blocked PID when I run the validation and the diagnostic tool. Is this install only for a certain geographic area? (I am from Toronto). Also, in Step 3 you say just to run the .reg file yet there is Autoexnt.bat, Autoexnt.exe and Instexnt.exe.. are these supposed to be run as well?  TIA for any help.
Cheers"

Don't know what the issue was but I can tell you TPB admin have at times been over sensitive.

,drazner,2011-03-01T06:13Z,Uh. Will this still work if I just mount it onto PowerISO?
,DragonRider65,2011-03-17T00:12Z,"@drazner:
Yes, it will, and I highly recommend doing that. If you guys are having problems activating this, just look for the Xtreme Activator; I have it and it has never ever failed me on any Windows or Microsoft Office products man. Thanks uploader; I recently have started working on a firend's old old old laptop and am having to try your operating system here to fix it? This thing is crap, and if your operating system doesn't work for this thing, then maybe I'll have to just scrap this piece of shit? Appreciate the opportunity to get this from you, thanks."
,justmealwatts,2011-03-17T21:10Z,Thank You!!! Clean install. Works great. Never have had any issues with your downloads.
,KS17,2011-04-02T12:40Z,"Hi CU,
Thanks for the download, installation went smooth and perfectly.
Only problem is that after I completed the 3-step activation process, which seemed to work, I'm still getting a count down in my task bar telling me I only have (now) 20 days left for activation.
Does this mean the activation process didn't work? Or will this just tick down to 0, then let me continue to use?
Cheers."

,pbg8,2011-07-09T17:41Z,"hey, computer-user, the initial install (copying of files) seemed to go okay, but during the setup, it says it needs the file 'asms' from service pack 3... any way to fix/bypass?

email is bballinpandaz@aol.com"
,minhaj23,2011-08-03T22:18Z,k so let me get this straight. All i have to do is burn the ISO image file using Alcohol120 to a dvd and just run it on the computer which i need to reboot? and what about all the other files and programs which u have included. what are they used for?
