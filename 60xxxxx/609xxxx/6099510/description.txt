This archive contains videos and pictures uploaded from tunisia on January 12th and early on the 13th and which were circulated on the internet, and posted to Anonymous IRC by people of Tunisia.

The media has had little coverage, underestimated death tolls... This will show you the truth.

There are graphic images and videos, including the dead bodies of tunisians. Keep in mind the reason for the cell phone cam's is media is prohibited in the country.
