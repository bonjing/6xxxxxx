,erroneus,2011-01-15T00:15Z,Is there such a package for the entirety of Adobe CS5?
,evilgold,2011-01-16T03:41Z,@erroneus If you tell me what apps you need i will package them. I don't personally use adobe products so im not sure what other CS5 products are of interest. 
,kerjii,2011-01-16T08:48Z,Thanks. I'll give this a shot. It does get a little old having to fall back on my puny macbook when my linux box is the one with the balls.
,Laxidate,2011-01-24T06:43Z,"This is great.  I've been looking for a linux photoshop. THANK YOU!
Now I had to screw around with it a little to get it to run but I got it eventually.
It might not be the prettiest thing but its a free linux photoshop  (I got it running in ubuntu Maverick 10.10)"

,roman24t,2011-03-22T05:11Z,It would be nice if someone could package dreamweaver.. the only reason I still use windows
,roman24t,2011-03-22T07:47Z,and when i try to launch i get error Cool Type failed to initialize what do i do?
,xfrostx,2011-04-12T03:45Z,plz. make a lightroom 3.3 corkscrew... thanks
,djackdaw,2011-04-23T06:42Z,"I followed all the instructions, but I'm getting this error when launching it: 'Could not initialize Photoshop failed to initialize CoolType'. Any suggestions on what to do?"
,EmoSaga,2011-04-26T07:36Z,"I was having the same issues with CoolType (which is a dll) but I some how got around it. I ran Photoshop from the direct exe rather than the .sh files. Can be found at: HOME/.wine/winprefixes/Photoshop CS5/drive_c/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS5/Photoshop.exe

Definitely UGLY! But it works! I even got plug-ins to work."
,hayleybobayley,2011-07-25T06:23Z,Won't work for me :( I go to the .exe file and try to run it but nothing happens. Just won't open. Anything I can do?
,alfono,2011-10-17T01:41Z,"OpenSUSE 11.3
Runs if opened by .exe but crashes on text insert. It's probably looking for fonts but not finding any. Anyone have a solution?"
,alfono,2011-10-17T02:55Z,Added a font folder and patched amtlib.dll. Still crashes on text.
,tpoms,2012-03-27T01:24Z,"Using Ubuntu 11.10. 

Installed Regular wine 1.2.3
Installed winetricks with known photoshop stuff needs

Installed Corkscrew.
Ran corkscrew received cool type error. 

Navigated to /.wine/CorkscrewDir, and launched via EXE directly using Wine. 

It opened! Crashed on text selection.

Re-Ran CorkscrewLauncher and bam its working flawlessly now.

Will try on another virgin 11.10 install and confirm in a bit."
,tpoms,2012-03-27T02:47Z,"I've got this running flawlessly on Ubuntu 11.10

Download this package.

Install Wine through Ubuntu store, 1.2
Run winecfg in terminal and initialize wine.
Get winetricks [wget http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks]
Install Addons into default bottle [sh winetricks msxml6 gdiplus gecko vcrun2005sp1 vcrun2008 msxml3 atmlib]

open ~/.wine/wineprefixes/PhotoshopCS5/drive_c/windows/system32
and copy atmlib.dll to ~/.wine/drive_c/windows/system32

Make a new launcher like this


#!/bin/bash
cd ~/.wine/wineprefixes/PhotoshopCS5/drive_c/Program Files/Adobe/Adobe Photoshop CS5/
wine Photoshop.exe
"
,okman2200,2012-06-18T02:49Z,"Here is what I did on Ubuntu 12.04 and it works.

Install Wine from the Software Centre (or the command line if it excites you).

Run the package (right-click on ""InstallerPhotoshopCS5.sh and select Properties, then under Permissions, click ""Allow executing file as program""; once you double click the document, select ""run"").

The go to your home folder and if you cannot see the hidden files, type CTRL+H then go to .wine/wineprefixes/PhotoshopCS5/drive_c/users

From there, open the ""evilgold"" folder and copy/cut everything, go back and open your username folder and paste everything.

My shortcuts on the desktop didn't work, so I go to home/bin/ and open PhotoshopCS5Launcher.sh (make sure you allow it to run as an executable as we did above).

Feel free to install what others have written in the comments if you have a use for it."
