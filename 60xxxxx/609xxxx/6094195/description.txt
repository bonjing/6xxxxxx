Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult were two of the world's biggest hard rock bands in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, these two musical titans got together and performed to a sold out crowd in New York City. George Harrison produced this 1980 tour film about that show. Tracks include such Sabbath classics as "Iron Man," "Paranoid," and "War Pigs" (with Ronnie James Dio on vocals) and Blue Oyster Cult numbers such as "Godzilla" and "Divine Wind."
