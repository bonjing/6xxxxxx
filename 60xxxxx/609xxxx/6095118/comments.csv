That doesn't make any sense. It is just plain dumb.

Next time, create a folder named after the move, copy all the files that belong to the movie into the folder, and then create a torrent of the folder."
,lazyjack,2011-01-12T12:28Z,It comes in two DVD's. You can watch the first and decide if you want to download the second. When someone goes to the trouble of compressing and sharing don't piss them off or they will just stop seeding!
