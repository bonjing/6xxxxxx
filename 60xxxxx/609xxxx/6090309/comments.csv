[V],aoloffline,2011-01-09T10:26Z,I don't think a hd copy is available.
,hauntnut,2011-04-03T04:51Z,"Great audio and video! The only thing that sucks is that when I went to burn this to a blank DVD5, it said it was 316KB over, and could not do it. "
,hauntnut,2011-04-03T04:59Z,"Found a fix for those wanting to burn to a DVD5: use mkvmerge to remove the subtitle options from the file, and that will lower the size of the file to allow for burning. Thanks for this upload! This one is a winner!"
,lefrroy,2011-05-08T01:20Z,"to  hauntnut
the short story:

u are an idiot   simply: USE NERO  to burn this file [this file = 4482 mega in nero, on a 4489 = a normal dvd=dvd5]
4.37 have this file here and when u burn with nero have 4.482 and a dvd have 4.489"
,lefrroy,2011-05-08T01:26Z,"



the upload is not an idiot, and he or she  give to this cartoon the exact capacity to fit on a normal dvd.... o yeah this person use windows xp...and he or she can burn this file on a single dvd with nero....and only u annonimous [ hauntnut ] are an idiot because u use win7, when all the world use windows xp with nero 9 preinstall and all of us can burn this file on a normal dvd,,,,"
,lefrroy,2011-05-08T01:36Z,"your problemo is because you try to burn this file with windows 7 --> epic fail
windows7 = just insert the dvd and burn the files   and the burn from win7  doesnt show the all capacity of the dvd like nero... so that;s way you cant burn with win 7 the 4.37 gb,//only with nero
"
,lefrroy,2011-05-08T09:18Z,"if only the cartoon will be like in the sample...

,lefrroy,2011-05-08T09:21Z,"

Please, there is no reason for being so nasty. Not everyone is as fucking brilliant as you are.

@hauntnut
There are several programs that will trim a file just enough to fit on the disc/drive combination you are using. Also, zapping the menu and language options often give huge gains in capacity. I use DVD Fab because it works well."
,Eramosa,2011-10-06T15:59Z,"loquerlicker is right, there's no reason to be such an ass. maybe keep in mind that you're how old and downloading a disney movie, and that you're insulting people because they don't know as much about burning DVDs as you. "
,Ecclesiast,2011-10-30T19:26Z,Thanks!
,svart.se,2012-01-17T08:57Z,who the fuck burns DVDs anymore!?
,loveablemama,2012-01-19T23:09Z,"If you use Convert X 
  you will be able to convert and burn the movie
You may need to find the torrent first with a serial key. But it works great."
,DingleBearTush,2012-02-05T06:50Z,The video is slightly shaking back and forth? Rough dude.
