Plot or synopsis
A supposed true story about an anti-social nerd in love with an elegant beauty, Train Man served as fantasy fulfillment for otaku males everywhere. Now, it's time for otaku girls to get their time in the spotlight with How to Date an Otaku Girl. Based on a popular blog that was also turned into a comic series, the film focuses on the world of fujoshi - a type of female otaku that is into butler cafÃ©s and boys love culture - and ponders whether it's possible for them to find true love. Directed by Detroit Metal City assistant director Kaneshige Atsushi, How to Date an Otaku Girl stars Matsumoto Wakana of Masked Rider Den-O as the titular otaku girl and Daito Shunsuke (Crows Zero) as her potential significant other. It also features cameos by popular voice actors Hino Satoshi (Naruto) and Fukuyama Jun (Kuroshitsuji).
It was love at first sight when Hinata (Daito Shunsuke) spots former co-worker Yoriko (Matsumoto Wakana). Head over heels in love, Hinata confesses his love to Yoriko, but she warns him that she's a fujoshi - a term Hinata has never heard of. Ignoring her warning, the two begin dating, and Hinata suddenly finds himself knee-deep in butler costumes, boys love comics, and cosplay parties. Can Hinata see past Yoriko's strange hobbies and love her for who she is?
