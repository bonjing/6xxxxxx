Any diehard AC/DC fan has to love this album. This edition is also special due to the information booklet contained within. There are a few, not many, but a few new guitar riffs added to this album, but the bands signature is still intact. AC/DC is one of the few bands that have maintained a consistancy in their music. An example: Any song on this album, you automatically know your listening to AC/DC. They prove that even though they are getting older their song writing abilities, music skills, and vocals are still awesome. The video to "Rock n Roll Train" shows Brian Johnson gettng down just as he did in early times and Angus is still just lovin what he does best. Malcolm still has the touch, and they blend perfectly with each other. The bottom line is, AC/DC still rocks and they talk about life, how it really is, not how most people perceive it to be. Rock on!
