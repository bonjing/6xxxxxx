A-PDF Password Security is a desktop utility program that lets you change password security of existing Acrobat PDF files. That means you can protect PDF files with 128 bit encryption, or remove existing password protection. It can handle either single or batch documents. Another convenient features include password pool and hot directory.
Protect your PDF documents from unauthorized access with standard password security:
- 40-bit RC4 encryption, which is supported by Adobe Acrobat 3.0 or above.
- 128-bit RC4 encryption, which is supported by Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0 or above.
Decrypt PDF Files You can also remove the standard password security from protected PDF files. Supports 40/128 bit RC4 and 128 AES encryption.
Change Restrictions of PDF Files With A-PDF Password Security, you can set a PDF file to require a password to open, and/or restrict access. For example, to allow or not allow printing, copying content, changing the file, etc.
Batch Change Properties of PDF Files With A-PDF Password Security, you can batch edit and modify your PDFs metadata, such as PDF Title, Subject, Author and Keywords.
Add Expiry Time and Data to PDF Files With A-PDF Password Security, you can set or remove expiration Time and Date on a PDF.
Password Pool If you need unsecure a batch of PDF files with one password, you can special a password pool. A-PDF Password Security will try the passwords one by one, instead of input them manually.

Q: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'
A: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; 
   
   OPTION 1: Download & install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: 

   http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm
   
   OPTION 2: Download & install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded

Q: 'I download a keygen from a user & my AV flagged it as a virus!'
A: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. 

   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.
   
   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user & check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. 

   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.
   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.

   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum & report it here: 
   http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29 ; the staff will gladly double-check it.

Q: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'
