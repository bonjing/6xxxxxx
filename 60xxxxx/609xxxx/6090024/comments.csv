[V],twentyforty,2011-01-08T23:00Z,"@r-0987: I took your X-files two days ago. That's about it, for January, I guess."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-08T23:13Z,"@r-0987: Sorry, wrong. 5 days ago....
""r-0987 at 2011-01-03 13:17 CET: 
The X Files: I Want to Believe (2008). Could you please do this!""

 and I got BluRay yesterday and would be encoded today (CET Sunday). I cannot do faster, it's not up to me."
,dark_defender,2011-01-09T00:35Z,"Twentyforty, i guess you are the only one among very few who is seeding this torrent with good speed. :-(
I assume you use Bit Tornado/03I? I have max 60 kbps DL speed. I hope you will seed it untill i complete it. Thanks !!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-09T08:00Z,"@dark_defender; Don't worry, I'll be seeding for 48 hours. Stop all other torrents, and make all necessary steps I mentioned before to maintain the connection to my BitTornado. I am fast as hell (I can seed one movie as this one in 300 seconds) but you would need 7+ hours for download (approx. 200 MB per hour)."
,r-0987,2011-01-09T10:20Z,It's fine! I thought you had not taken the x files request....
,muk0690,2011-01-09T18:38Z,One hell of a movie. Thanks!
,dark_defender,2011-01-09T19:15Z,"Completed !!! Posting a bit late though. 
Its an awesome rip man. Cant get any better.
Thanks a million times for entertaining my request."
,zephyr920,2011-01-16T09:22Z,Tnx for the upload..!!
,Lovejam,2011-01-25T00:06Z,"Great quality encode!
Thanks"
,ravel.out,2011-04-16T23:18Z,Thanks alot! I will seed that for a while!
,tiagoars,2011-06-29T09:32Z,"Hi 20\40, please help us reseeding, as the film is very good and it wasn't available for many months. Not to mention that your quality is exceptional and your torrent should stay. Thanks for your uploads!!"
,LezDawson,2012-06-02T19:26Z,"Is this really ""640p""???"
