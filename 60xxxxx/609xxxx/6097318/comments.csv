,kimba007,2011-01-24T00:50Z,"Thanks for ALL the terrific small & big programs kk. For everything you have offered, it must take you quite a bit of time. I appreciate your work to the nth degree!"
,kimba007,2011-01-24T09:14Z,"kk: Oh, Oh, I installed Chris TV and seconds after I connected to the net a window said Dear potential customer why bother looking for a crack when you can get it free from this site [I forget what is was now], blah, blah, blah. That spooked me pretty good and then, 2 seconds later my system re-booted by itself! I almost had a Grand mal from that! And yes I had it blocked with ESET Security [unless I'm doing it wrong] and it found 2 adwares. It also opened [when i started the net again] with yahoo instead of google as my home page. I disconnected the net and after it booted up, I un-installed it with Your Uninstaller and then used regedit. Did I freak out for nothing? have you heard of anyone else getting something like that? That is the first time for me!"
