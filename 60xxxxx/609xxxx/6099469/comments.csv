,Ezrathewuff,2011-01-14T11:18Z,"I downloaded the file and burnt it onto a CD, and then ran it through my Mac's Boot Camp to install it, which should have worked without a problem. However, it gave me an error message saying that there was no valid boot CD, and then my Boot Camp stopped being able to run. I'm not sure what happened or what went wrong."

,jaack29,2011-01-18T05:10Z,"@dj702lv

It does not require a key.

,allensworld,2011-01-20T09:48Z,"@jknice, 

(i)it is pre cracked, that means serial already included in it. so it will not asked for serial while installation process.

(ii)it is already patched to bypass windows genuine software check. "
[V],Maherz,2011-01-20T10:23Z,"@jknice
No addons! Nothing installed except updates.
It passes the genuine test, i used a genuine key to do so.

@allensworld
You're welcome."

[V],Maherz,2011-01-20T18:00Z,"@jknice
I don't really understand you!
What addons are you talking about?

@colliparks69
No repair option in this CD.
To repair an existing Windows installation you can use another XP CD."
,jknice,2011-01-20T20:47Z,"addons means
java
net framework
ie
wmp
winrar
etc......."
,jinualex,2011-01-21T02:44Z,thank you  Maherz. You'r great.
[V],Maherz,2011-01-22T05:57Z,"@jknice
I always try to make it simple.
I don't include 'addons', you can install these programs by yourself.

@jinualex
You're welcome ;)"
,jknice,2011-01-22T22:23Z,but you edit windows i think you edited 
,neuromonkey,2011-01-23T02:57Z,"Fucking brilliant. After 6 frickin' XP downloads, this is the only one that had everything I needed to complete the install.

A huge thank you."
,neuromonkey,2011-01-23T14:15Z,"There are a few add-ons included with this install. Most critically for me, it had the SATA drivers I needed for an old machine I'm using as an media server. I don't know what it is exactly, but this XP install seems subjectively a lot quicker and more responsive than others I've tried. I'm not sure yet if someone has done some good performance tuning, but it runs exceptionally well on old hardware.

Add-ons I've noticed are:

 * IDM (Internet Download Manager) 6.04 Build 2 Full

 * WinRAR 4.00 beta 4

 * Unlocker 1.9.0

 * Java Runtime Environment

  * Microsoft Silverlight

  * Microsoft CAPICOM


Also, the Folder View options in Windows Explorer are pre-set to how I ordinarily configure them. (Show all files, don't hide extensions, etc.) This is very handy. Also, there are several sensible things shut off, like Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop. I haven't checked out all the services yet.

The WGA patch is thorough. Updates and MSE installs and works fine.

This appears to be the best XP distribution I've found."
,kiyoshi00,2011-01-24T02:29Z,is this 32bit??? or 64bit???
[V],Maherz,2011-01-24T09:56Z,"@neuromonkey
You're welcome.

@kiyoshi00
32-bit."
,jknice,2011-01-24T11:55Z,you were saying that its not edited and its full lol
[V],Maherz,2011-01-25T05:10Z,"@jknice
Sorry bro, I really want to help you, but always don't understand what you mean!
If you explain more I can help."
,neuromonkey,2011-01-25T18:47Z,"Hm. It looks like the Citrix remote access app is included here. For good, or for evil?"
,neuromonkey,2011-01-25T19:48Z,"Maherz: Could you tell me if you built this yourself from an original XP CD, or if you built on a previous release? Is everything included your work?

I'm curious about why this distribution seems to run so much faster than others I've installed, even after I've applied a number of performance tweaks."
[V],Maherz,2011-01-27T05:45Z,"@neuromonkey
This is the original image from Microsoft. I didn't do anything except 3 things:
1) Added genuine serial.
2) Integrated updates.
3) Removed Windows Messenger and MSN Explorer.
Nothing else more at all!
It's fast because it's the original without any modifications."
,kiyoshi00,2011-02-01T04:04Z,works really great... tnx Maherz for great uploads...
[V],Maherz,2011-02-01T12:27Z,"@kiyoshi00
You're welcome."
,Crowed,2011-02-02T03:19Z,"Very Nice.

No hassle install and smooth running. It's just what Maherz says it is. Straight XP x86 SP3 that doesn't ask for the serial key and Activates/Validates/Updates @ M$ with no BS.

Thank you, brother. I needed that. I have a friend who trashed his OS and needed a new install for the price you asked...

He paid me in gratitude and I am passing it all along to you. His system is up and running fine - passes all tests.

Kudos to you for the clean ISO and many thanks for the quality work you put into it."
[V],Maherz,2011-02-02T08:05Z,"@Crowed
Happy for you man.
But wait, what price are you talking about?! I do this for free, I do it for fun! I didn't ask for money!!"
,maxdesolate,2011-02-05T08:42Z,"maherz. this looks awesome man. i have one question though and i would appreciate if you reply fast as i have to install this today. i am goin to burn the image , but i unrared the file and it has 2 internet shortcuts. is that not going to cause a problem while installing the windows since the shortcuts cant be seperated from the rar file???"
[V],Maherz,2011-02-05T13:20Z,"@maxdesolate
It's not a RAR file! It's an ISO file, but looks like a rar file to you.
Just burn this file as it is, don't unrar it.
Good luck."
,Crowed,2011-02-06T19:09Z,"@Maherz

LOL - free was the $ price I was referring to and that's what I charge too. Like you, I also find it fun to work on systems... But I'm more of a hardware guy and couldn't do what you have done with this ISO.

Since my friend paid me in gratitude I thought I had better pass that on to you since you earned it. :)

P.S.: I added a +Quality, kept a copy of the ISO and am also seeding it because I appreciate good work which is sometimes hard to find on these download sites."
,mahir256,2011-02-06T21:55Z,"1. is this iso oem, retail, or corporate/volume?

2. referring to the above question, should product keys meant for the specific type work for it?

3. can this be used to upgrade xp home to xp pro without a clean install or invalidating activation?

4. if i can upgrade it, do i need to uninstall anything prior to the installation?

5. @maherz: where are you from? good to see another mah*r"
,petey2494,2011-02-07T07:34Z,Great torrent worked perfectly although for some drivers that needed to be installed but worked out great
[V],Maherz,2011-02-07T17:15Z,"@Crowed
Got ya :)
Thank you for the quality plus and for seeding.

@mahir256
1) Volume License.
2) Didn't really understand you well, but the product key used for this release is an original non blakclisted volume license key.
3) Yes you can. Run the setup inside current XP Home windows and go on. But you might need the key this way. Here it is: MR49R-DRJXX-M6PX2-V96BF-8CKBJ
4) No need to uninstall anything. Anyway, I don't like doing upgrade myself, I always go for the clean install. It's up to you.
5) I'm Palestinian.

You can install from a USB.
Can't tell if your network card driver is included or not!

You can use DriverGenuis to update and download drivers, search Google.

No.

If you boot-install you won't need a key. If you install it from inside an already installed Windows, then you will be asked to enter a key.
Same if you install it on vmware or parallels.

 You insist you haven't added anything, yet Internet Download Manager, Unlocker and others are plainly installed. Why the untruth?
I did a fresh install, and it didn't like to play with Microsoft Security Essentials; apparently a compatibility problem with Windows Defender. Okay, I'll just shut down Defender, right?
""You can not access security center right now"" or something similar came up.
