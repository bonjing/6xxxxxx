What the deuce...? A master plan gone awry sends Stewie and Brian hurtling back through time in Family Guy: Time Warped! Avoid roving bands of thugs as you pursue Peter through modern-day Quahog! Rescue Rupert from gangs of ornery cowboys headed by an evil 1850â€™s Lois! Face murderous centurions headed by the Emperor Quagligula, ruling Ancient Rome with his iron... er, um... fist! All this while being pursued by the relentless Time Police and their robot sentinels, charged with protecting history from bungling time travelers like you. Liquidate your foes with a variety of weapons, from baseball bats to shotguns to bottles of ipecac! Uranium rods collected along the way endow you with dazzling new abilities - like the double-jump and the jump-glide - and let you power your way back to modern-day Quahog!
