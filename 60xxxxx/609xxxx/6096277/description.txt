Since 1981, in a small village in Bosnia-Hercegovina named Medjugorje, 
the Blessed Virgin Mary has been appearing and giving messages to the world. 
She tells us that God has sent Her to our world and, these years she is 
spending with us are a time of Grace granted by God. In Her own words She 
tells us, "I have come to tell the world that God exists. He is the fullness 
of life, and to enjoy this fullness and peace, you must return to God".

Those of you who are skeptical about the events in Medjugorje should take a 
long hard look at the FACTS!
