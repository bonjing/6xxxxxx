The events occurring there - the many signs and miracles, the results of scientific studies performed on the visionaries - these things have no scientific explanation.

In addition, the pope has no official position on the apparitions - not yet. In March 2010, the Holy See announced that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was forming an investigative commission which has responsibility for any possible judgment on the case:

I also recommend the following link:

If it was a scam, it would be very unlikely for the visionaries to make the following claim:
""Our Lady has promised to leave a supernatural, indestructible, and visible sign  on the mountain where she first appeared.""
5 out of the 6 visionaries confirmed they would be alive when this would take place.

People who lie and deceive try to make their claims as murky and general as possible.

For all those who read this and are unsure or have a ""wait and see"" attitude - this is OK. I recommend you focus on the essence of Our Lady's messages (the 5 Stones or Weapons we can use to defeat satan):

* Daily Prayer 
* Fasting on bread & water on Wednesdays and Fridays
* Daily Reading of the Bible
* Monthly Confession
* Holy Communion

PS - ""bodthedog"", you should take a long hard look at yourself in the mirror before you call other people ""religious halfwits"" merely because their opinions and beliefs differ from yours.

peace be with you always"
