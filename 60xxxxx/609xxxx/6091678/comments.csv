,fonesex,2011-06-04T06:42Z,Is there anyway that you can include the english audio as well?
[T],[D],2011-06-04T13:35Z,On the thoranime irc channel there is a package with the english audio and instructions.
,dviteris,2011-06-17T01:03Z,Wait... how can I get the English Audio on this???
,swaggerdon,2012-01-11T18:38Z,i'm confused. Why are there only 13 episodes. I thought there were 26 episodes. In other words this torrent has only half the episodes

So basically this would be ova 1 and 2."
