If there's one AC/DC album that aims for respectability, for something more serious than the band's usual feel-good rock about sex, parties and rock n' roll, Flick of the Switch is that album. Though Highway to Hell offers catchier tunes and Back in Black was the commercial behemoth, Flick of the Switch is the band at its most uncompromising, loaded with writhing electric-guitar work, seething energy, groove, and a darker touch. From the bone-rattling power chords of "Rising Power" to the lumbering drive of "Guns for Hire", AC/DC sounds metallic and tough, Brian Johnson taking his ragged vocal style to its limit (before he turned into the hoarse, oddly interesting, yet not-for-all-tastes screech in the '90s). Possibly my favourite of the Brian Johnson AC/DC albums, even if it's less commercial, less anthemic, and less hook-laden than Back in Black.
