THE BEATLES - SGT. PEPPER\'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND - MFSL SEALED LP -

This is a MFSL Super Virgin Vinyl  200 GRAM UHQR JVC Half-Speed Japanese BOX SET Pressing. THESE WERE VERY LIMITED PRESSINGS FROM THE 80\'S. THEY WERE THE FIRST EVER HEAVY VINYL AUDIOPHILE PRESSINGS. IT\'S A TRUE COLLECTORS DREAM TO OWN ONE OF THESE MASTERPIECES.

THE UHQR BY MFSL WERE THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY-ADVANCED RECORD CONCEIVED. THE OVERALL SONIC IMPACT IS STARTLING, FEATURING EXTREMELY SPECIFIC IMAGING, GREATLY EXPANED FREQUENCY AND VASTLY IMPROVED CHANNEL SEPARATION. THE UHQR WEIGHS MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH AS A CONVENTIONAL LP AND TAKES MORE THAN 10 TIMES LONGER TO PRESS. AS A RESULT, IT CONTAINS FAR MORE HIGH FIDELITY INFORMATION WITHIN ITS GROOVES. EACH UHQR IS ELEGANTLY BOXES AND PROTECTIVELY PACKAGED. PRESSINGS WERE STRICTLY LIMITED TO 5000 EDITIONS, EACH ONE HAND NUMBERED FOR AUTHENTICITY.
