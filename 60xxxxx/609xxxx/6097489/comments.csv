,zeca.pt,2011-02-03T10:47Z,"@ dexk

the program works just fine. that error is due to something else.

dont update the program cause it may affect the crack. 

you can always re-instal the program"

,lemonpirate,2011-03-07T05:23Z,Thanks for sharing! But I can't get it to work with Word 2010 (using a permanent activator)-- no Endnote tab. Any suggestions?
,seoded,2011-03-12T10:08Z,"Olá Zeca.

Não consigo ter o office 2010 pt e o endnote x4 a funcionar em harmonia. Sempre que abro o word dá-me mensagens sem fim sobre macros e quando fecho, entre outras coisas, pergunta se quero guardar o endnote dot não sei das quantas. ando a perder a paciencia. contigo funciona tudo direitinho? cumprimentos"
,zeca.pt,2011-03-12T13:16Z,vou ver o que arranjo
,zeca.pt,2011-03-12T13:54Z,"@ seoded
para ser compativel com o office 2010, tens de ter um update. o problema é que um novo update siginifica um novo crack ou serial, e como é uma versão relativamente recente ainda não estará disponível.

em http://www.hundredbling.net/showthread.php?p=757884 tens uma instalacao do ultimo update e com um ficheiro licenca que supostamente funcionaria como querias, no word 2010. mas nao consegui pôr a funcionar...

cumprimentos"
,zeca.pt,2011-03-12T21:06Z,"@ lemonpirate

it works with word 2007.

on the other hand i realized that an uptade is needed in order to work with word 2010. you can easily findt the update, but the crack for that new version of endnote its harder to find.  you may try this http://www.hundredbling.net/showthread.php?p=757884 but i cant promise it works.."

@zeca.pt and lemonpirate
I downloaded the Endnote X4 v4.0.2 from the link you gave. Yes it works with MS-Word 2010 (EndNote menu icon appears) but it's only for 30 days (evaluation version).
Any help?
Otherwise, we should go back to MS-Word 2007 :(("
,zeca.pt,2011-03-17T12:22Z,ill post as soon as i figure that out

I am also using word 2010. I am stuck on the 30-day trail version and product key. any help?? thanks"
,donnvp,2011-03-27T01:07Z,"hey it works fine for me

after you download from zeca.pt

which is http://www.hundredbling.net/showthread.php?p=757884

then dont forget to put your computer offline from internet then start installing it. thats it

Installation Notes:

Place the license in the same folder as installer and install from there

Always keep this in mind when installing releases....

.....Remember to block applications (or go off line) from calling home 'during install'.
Once installed, disable 'check for automatic updates' option if available, so that you don't get it blacklisted.....Where Applicable!!"
