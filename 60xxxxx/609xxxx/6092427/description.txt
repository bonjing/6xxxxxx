Recent years have seen the introduction of concepts from the new and exciting field of complexity science that have captivated the attention of economists, sociologists, engineers, business people, and many others.

These include

    * tipping points, the sociological term used to describe moments when unique or rare phenomena become more commonplace;
    * the wisdom of crowds, the argument that certain types of groups harness information and make decisions in more effective ways than individuals;
    * six degrees of separation, the idea that it takes no more than six steps to find some form of connection between two random individuals; and
    * emergence, the idea that new properties, processes, and structures can emerge unexpectedly from complex systems.

Interest in these intriguing concepts is widespread because of the utility of this field. Complexity science can shed light on why businesses or economies succeed and fail, how epidemics spread and can be stopped, and what causes ecological systems to rebalance themselves after a disaster.
