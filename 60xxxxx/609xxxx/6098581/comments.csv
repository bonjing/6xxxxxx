,nofil,2011-05-07T09:43Z,not widescreen... what a pity!
,jemicarus,2011-06-02T04:03Z,"@nofil - you can always change the aspect ration to 16:9 in VLC, my friend. If you use KM Player instead, you set it at Fullscreen(Stretch) for the same effect. The difference in quality is imperceptible to me, but then I guess I ain't that hip. Thanks for the upload, by the way, yokbisey. "
