,xSareth,2011-02-05T18:28Z,"Great HD quality, but so far I've had one problem. In the first movie the sound goes out of sync when Sid lights the match to blow up Buzz. Is there a way to fix it? Is it the torrent or just media player?"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-02-07T10:55Z,"Audio and video are two tracks of the same length, contained in one .m2ts file, so if the sync' was wrong, it would be out for the duration of the movie, not just at times."
,tpbparrot,2011-02-17T17:53Z,"I'd like to confirm that there's a sync problem on the first movie, near the location xSareth mentions. The audio is intact during the scene. I checked the original DVD movie, and there's a cut-scene that's missing before Sid lights the match. It's a scene where the mechanical spider and legged crane toy creep out from hiding behind pipes. So at that point on the audio trails the video for the rest of the movie.

Want to say I appreciate your work on all your releases. Hope to see a fix for this."
