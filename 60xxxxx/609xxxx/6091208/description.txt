12 jurors must decide the fate of a Chechen teenager charged with murdering his 
stepfather. This is a re-make of the Hollywood movie starring Henry Fonda of
course.

Russia has a great future yet - the human stocks there have warmth and beauty of
spirit that needs to be recognized as such. In any event this is only a look at a
few of the people of Russia, and most of the country's potential is hardly shown 
here. Yet you do get a glimpse of some of its culture intensively enough in what is 
a long movie offering (2hrs 40 minutes) and is of great interest in this regard.

There are war scenes and images from the ethnic conflicts there to that have kept
Russia from becoming in its own right - a state that has found its own sustainable
spirit and sensibility in where lies its best real true self in fact, as a European
Union incorporate potentially.
