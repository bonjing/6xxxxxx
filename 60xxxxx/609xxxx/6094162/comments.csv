This is a truly magnificent recording. As usual, René Jacobs meticulously reconstructs every single aria, re-evaluates every note, every delicate embellishment. The result is an opera which flows almost effortlessly, and Mozart’s magic works on its own. 
I own several Zauberflöte recordings (Solti, Abbado...) and this one beats them all. An absolute masterpiece."

Nice to see someone with genuine musical taste.

I will be uploading much more Rene Jacobs in the near future both as conductor and countertenor.

A truly gifted musical talent!"
