The latest instalment in RenÃ© Jacobs' superlative and surprising series of Mozart operas.

This version of Die ZauberflÃ¶te was given to me for Christmas. It's cast mostly with young singers and if you are looking for a set piece spectacular, skipping from aria to aria, you might find it a bit lightweight. Everyone sings nice enough, but the real gem is the narrative overall.

The dialogue (given here in full and spoken by the actual singers, not different actors) has been thoroughly coached, and is accompagnied by a pianoforte - not as secco recitiative, but with little "comments" to the action. There are also plenty of period sound effects in play. Especially the "buffo" elements (Papageno/Papagena and Monostatos and the slaves) are very funny, and it's the first time, that I actually cared about the spoken dialogue (I usually don't like singspiels, and I tend to skip by the dialogue, but this was totally worth it).

Rene Jacobs is always surprising in Mozart, and for fans of big-boned Magic Flutes (like Klemperer, BÃ¶hm or Karajan) this is certainly different, but very enjoyable. Orchestra and chorus are impeccable.
