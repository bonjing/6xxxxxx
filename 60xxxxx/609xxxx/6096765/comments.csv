[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-13T03:51Z,"You have to seed until there is enough people to keep it alive.  If you are new and there isn't enough interest then nothing you do will keep it alive (short of seeding it 24/7).

How much you seed may depend on your bandwidth available.  I don't think there is any hard and fast rules.  As a leecher though I recommend seeding at least what you take."
