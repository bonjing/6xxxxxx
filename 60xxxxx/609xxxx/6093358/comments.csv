,chalky_no1,2011-02-21T22:08Z,"will take over a year to get this. 
no seeders
and peers uploading F**K ALL...MAKES YA SIK"
,fillinthisspace,2011-02-22T22:39Z,"chalky_no1,
I don't know why you're having problems but there's plenty of seeds and peers at the moment, so maybe just be patient."
,chalky_no1,2011-02-22T23:59Z,"your the man for uploading this, i thank you very much, i had all 6 series but couldnt get 100% of last orders any where.....but rather then just select those episodes im downloading the lot coz the file sizes indicate it is much better quality then the ones i have....however my utorrent shows 11 seeds in brackets but only 1 seed uploading, and 66 peers in brackets and only 6 uploading, yet they have all set there upload speed to next to nothing, every now and again i get a boost from some one who has popped online who hasnt limited the upload speed.....every 1 is being very tight with this....i have downloaded 10% which is about 1.5gb yet i have uploaded nearly 3gb, and that isnt right. thanks again tho man , but this will take weeks at this rate"
,fillinthisspace,2011-02-23T00:12Z,"If it's any consolation I had to initially seed over 27GB before it was fully seeded. I'm not sure how that works...
I'll seed it again for the next 5 or 6 hours at least to give it a boost.... if it helps... my upload speed still isn't all that great."
,chalky_no1,2011-02-23T00:16Z,"yeah that would be cool if you could upload unlimted over night , i achieve best speeds overnight , that would defo help alot.....thanks."
,chalky_no1,2011-02-27T12:00Z,"6 days to download, but was worth it for the complete works of men behaving badly, good quality, thanks fillinthisspace ive uploaded 26gb. "
,fillinthisspace,2011-02-28T23:39Z,"chalky_no1,
I'm glad you're happy with the encodes. I was careful to get them right so they're probably about as close the original DVD quality as an AVI can get (side by side on my monitors there's very little difference between them).
And thanks for seeding so much. :-)"
,a.milan,2011-06-08T20:30Z,"tnx man, this is a great collection, to bad there are no seeders"
,sonyteve,2011-12-15T02:14Z,No seeders  :(
,fillinthisspace,2012-01-18T17:36Z,"I don't get it. I've looked at this torrent on the Pirate Bay a few times and the Pirate Bay always seems to think there's seeders. I still have this torrent loaded in uTorrent so I just started it again and uTorrent reports 30 seeders and 63 peers. Are the seeders not actually seeding?

I'll reseed this myself for a while but I'm not sure if I'll boost download speed a whole lot given my upload speed is so slow."
