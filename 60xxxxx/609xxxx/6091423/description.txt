Enemy was a skilled Syrian-trained sniper.

Scouting for potential enemy hides and ranging it.

Counter sniping Crack / Thump method. Crack is the sound of the bullet whizzing by at supersonic speed. The thump that follows is the actual report of the rifle. The time elapsed between the crack and the thump reveals the distance between the shooter and his target. In this case it was 2 seconds which translates to 600 yards for the M40A3. Entered distances for every landmark in that 600 range into his Data Book. He catches a glint from the enemy sniper's scope. You concentrate on your breathing, trigger control, sight alignment, sight picture. Focusing on the crosshairs. You're not focusing on him as a target.

DEATH FROM ABOVE

Lt. Jeff Hall and his partner Troy Duncan, SERT State Troopers

Helicopter shots hovering 50 yards from the target

Helicopter moving to the right and missed to the right so he took a negative lead to compensate for the forward momentum of the helicopter. Second burst from Hall hit Silka eight times.

Reenactments and helo training:

Dillon Arerial Platform System: Leads and points of aim are dependent on a number of factors: speed, height and direction of aircraft, as well as speed, distance and direction of target. It's about math formulas and training. Hall references an aerial rifle chart and adjusts his DOPE. He corrects for a number of secondary forces acting on the bullet, including jump, from the slipstream of the aircraft, gravity, the effects of aerodynamic drag and spin drift. The helicopter moves past the target at 40 knots. The target is 100 meters away, meaning his lag, or negative lead, is 9.2 feet.


HOGâ€™S TOOTH

When a Marine graduates Scout Sniper School, he makes the transition from PIG (Professional Instructed Gunman) to HOG (Hunter OF Gunmen). When a marine graduates Scout Sniper School, he's given a symbolic HOG's Tooth necklace. It's a cord and they have a bullet that has a hole drilled through it, and they put that around your neck. And that's supposed to mean that you have control of the round that was meant for you. It's more of mythical thing than reality, but it's kind of something that symbolizes a Marine sniper. To get your real HOG's Tooth, you're supposed to kill an enemy sniper and take the round out of his chamber, and that's considered, the round that was meant for you, and therefore you're immortal.
