The first video is in english with no subtitles, then the second part has subtitles, and the third is in another language with subtitles. It's not making the movie to enjoyable. Thanks for uploading, and help would be appreciated."

I was just wanting to know, I didn't want to burn it to a dvd and waste a dvd If it was in multiple languages and had subs."
