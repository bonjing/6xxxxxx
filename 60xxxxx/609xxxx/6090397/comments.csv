,faithdil,2011-04-21T21:57Z,awesome job mountainbush!!
,Mountainbush,2011-05-01T21:08Z,"I deleted this from my computer (had to wipe it anyways), and re-downloaded this (was in the mood for deathnote) and was amazed that it was downloading at 400kb/s. At some moments it was at 800kb/s. The torrent is still strong, ill start to seed it again. "
,anon1ski,2011-07-27T03:13Z,"Just a note, This is NOT high res. Still full torrent and still good. But not high res."
,usamalali,2011-08-12T22:55Z,"This is something truly amazing, both the anime and the torrent. Bravo Mountainbush!

,wrongful,2011-10-08T22:58Z,"Nice! I'm downloading right now, but for some reason it says the file size is 9.16 GB instead of 8.53, can anyone explain this? P.S. if anyone is still monitoring these comments, keep seeding!"
,gino2561,2011-11-26T22:55Z,"i read the instructions about the movie, and you said you can't seem to convert mkv files to other formats, i can convert the mkv to avi if you want me to, maybe that will allow you too convert it to mp4 succesfully, if you want this just post a comment and i will upload the converted files, but my upload speed is not great, either way great upload and great series"
,shooting.starfish,2012-01-19T19:17Z,PLEASE SEED :)))

,katsuya-urusaki,2012-04-05T00:35Z,"I am so seeding when it's done, you are awesome and i  just had to say that twice XD i didn't realize you added the soundtrack in there. I gotta read more XD"
,dre48,2012-06-01T11:13Z,"PLEASE SEED EVERYONE!! :(
