Info:

Milos is a former porn star who is down on his luck financially. 
When he receives a call from his long-time movie actress partner,
Layla, he welcomes her call. Apparently she's heard that a new film director wants to hire Milos to star in his "artistically-designed" porn film for a very generous price. He is easily lured form his semi-retirement by the lucrative offer, agreeing to meet the director in an isolated mansion.
