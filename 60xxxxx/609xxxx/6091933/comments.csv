[T],iqeiqe,2011-01-10T00:10Z,Thanks despo! (: 
,sharkdick,2011-01-10T01:58Z,360MB? Is this actually 720p?
[T],iqeiqe,2011-01-10T13:04Z,"Shark, It's actually 344MB not 360MB. I do not know where you got the latter from. 
Cartoon and anime release groups tend to use ~350MB for 720p files running about 19-23 minutes. Why you might ask? Simple, anime and cartoons have much less detail than live action material and therefore don't require an excessive bitrate. A bitrate of ~2000kbps is generally more than enough for animated content, anything else is overkill. Therefore, the 559MB the scene uses is excessive. Except they don't denoise and I can understand why they require the extra bitrare.
To be technical, simply having 720 lines of horizontal resolution and a progressive scan qualifies a file to be '720p'. File size doesn't matter when being technical. 
So to give you a direct answer to your question, yes this is 720p. (Screenshots are there for a reason.)"
,ndc4life,2011-01-11T02:08Z,Bam.
,ndc4life,2011-01-11T02:11Z,Oh hey iqeige! If you could possibly upload the past episodes as well in this file size you'd be my new hero for this month.  The other ones i have are over 700MB...Far too big for animated
,sharkdick,2011-01-11T03:38Z,"iqeiqe, only reason I asked is because all of the episodes I've downloaded so far have been ~700MB and labeled as 720p"
[T],iqeiqe,2011-01-11T04:55Z,"ndc4life, I don't have all the episodes at the moment, mainly because I haven't had an HD cap card for too long. You can try to re-encode the ~700MB files into something smaller. I will try to get the eps. but I'm not making any guarantees since I've had my hands full for a while. Sorry for the inconvenience. 

shark, no explanation was needed. You were curious, you asked a question and you received an answer. All is good in the world."
