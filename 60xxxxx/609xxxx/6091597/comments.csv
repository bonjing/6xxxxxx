,eastportmaine,2011-01-10T23:06Z,A/6 V/6 THANK YOU
,crashteam,2011-01-11T19:59Z,"A/5 V/5 Audio sounds like in a tin can. Video is over exposed to the point of not being able to see faces or any bright scenes, goes white and shiny, and goes out of focas. But just watchable. Had to see it to tell if its worth going to the movies and watching with the kids, its not, as bone says ""RT critics 3.3 out of 10"" is about right. Thanx for the upload tho, keep up the good work"
,Tugly,2011-01-12T23:04Z,Why would you go and record a 3D movie to put on the net?
,watbol,2011-02-13T23:14Z,"a=5 v=3
It's barely watchable.
As for the torrent, Keep up the Good Werk¡!
