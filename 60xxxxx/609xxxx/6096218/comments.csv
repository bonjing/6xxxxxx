,honunet,2012-05-28T23:27Z,"YIFi i just wanted to take the time to thank you man.. I have been a fan of your for a long time, I dont think there is anyone out there who does 720p movies with the size and quality you do.. Nobody.  So from all us us, even the complainers that you gave us a ten dollar bill instead of a twenty, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart."
