,bjs001,2011-08-21T23:33Z,Broken link!
,xasteo,2011-12-27T19:51Z,"Use the Magnet Link to download this one (the .torrent 404s). 

If the Magnet Link doesn't find any seeds/peers, download a TPB torrent like https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6819382/Chap-Hop_-_Professor_Elemental__amp_amp__Mr._B_The_Gentleman_Rhymer along with it so peer exchange can do its magic, worked for me.

It is currently fully seeded, but needs more seeds to prevent it from dying again.

These are .wav because the artist puts them out in this format (on his site own site). Track listing:
Splendid [2:39]
Animal Magic [2:41]
Sweet Cold Colation (featuring Madam Faye) [2:22]
The Quest For The Golden Frog [4:06]
Elixir [1:47]
A fete worse than def [2:23]
Steam Powered [2:00]
Penny Dreadful [4:32]
Cup Of Brown Joy [3:09]
Fighting Trousers! [3:03]
