Look forward to viewing the videos. To be honest I didn't even know they existed."

I did these dvd's in batch mode on Handbrake and am very disappointed that I/it made several mistakes in my recent uploads.  Be sure to check all your files when using Handbrake for errors before you think they are good - my new lesson learned."
