The long awaited Tim and Eric song, "Cops and Robbers", which is not featured on any of the album torrents you will find on here.  I recorded the DVD onto a miniDV tape, and then imported into my computer to export as a .wav file, and then trimmed it down in Final Cut Pro. Now its in .mp3 format. Enjoy and share!
