The Haulin\\\' or Crawlin\\\' crew has had a wild ride in 07-08 seasons getting the best rockcrawling action to date. This DVD has combined some of the best drivers from the most extremee events to them driving some of the hardest trails in the nation. This DVD has some killer footage from the 08 King of the Hammers event including some sick helicopter footage. This year we added some Trophy Truckland Class 1 car footage to spice things up. We have also added some cool bonus footage of the drivers. We have left the sweet sounds of the motor but also have a rippin soundtrack.

The sound didn\\\'t copy over totally perfect. Sorry for the sound quality.
