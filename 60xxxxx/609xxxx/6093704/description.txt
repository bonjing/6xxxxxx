This is as close as a full rip to this DVD as I could get and make it fit on a 4.7GB DVD-R. All subtitles (English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese) are intact but the only remaining audio stream for the first 21 videos is Dolby 5.1 Both Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 are left intact for the rest of the disk. I searched high and low online for this DVD for a couple years without any luck. Today I finally bought it and now I share it with you. If you like it and you love Motley Crue like I do, please go out and support the band by buying this DVD.
