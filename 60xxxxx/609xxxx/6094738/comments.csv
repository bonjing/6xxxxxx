Though I whole heartedly agree with you, I challenge you to read and ponder Job 32:8 to find out who ""you"" are.  Very true that govt's the world over has for the most part confiscated all the wealth leaving only the flesh to be converted into futures to back the world's currencies, this was all always part of his divine plan for his kingdom.  Revelations 13:7 tells you that the saints are to be overcame, so we are not to focus too heavily on the inevitible things that have, and are yet to take place because they are going to happen, and that has been preordained millions of years ago.

Our only salvation is via the blood of the purest sacraficial lamb and to enter into his covenant with the holy spirit.  This covenant is one of love and unconditional forgiveness.  We must extend that onto everyone ever if we can hope for the same.  Our actions are our declaration of which jurisdiction we are to dealt with in.  If you judge others, expect the almighty to judge you.  If you forgive others, through Crist he shall forgive you.

Faith without works is dead.  Preaching love is nothing compared to loving.  We gotta do it, not just say it.

Peace and God bless all seeders and leechers alike."
