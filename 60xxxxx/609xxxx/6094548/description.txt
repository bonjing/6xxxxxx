                    The multi-award winning drama Shameless returns  
                    for its eighth series with an extended run of  
                    22 new episodes, beginning with a run of five  
                    episodes across five nights. Everyone is  
                    talking about Libby and Frank's forthcoming  
                    wedding, but the nuptial plans are thrown into  
                    chaos at Frank's stag do - all dignity is lost  
                    and so is Frank when a close encounter sees him  
                    abducted! Meanwhile, months after Mimi   
                    unexpectedly gave birth, everyone wants to know  
                    who's the daddy? Mimi is determined to discover  
                    the identity of Cilla's father and sets off on  
                    a secret mission. Newcomers Avril, Jackson and  
                    daughter Letitia Powell have firmly settled  
                    themselves within the community and Avril  
                    volunteers to host Libby's hen night, but  
                    celebrations are brought to a halt when  
                    disaster strikes for one of the Maguires. Karen  
                    returns but Jamie is unsure of her motives.  
                    Chesney's cousin Sita causes quite a stir  
                    especially with Carl Gallagher.
