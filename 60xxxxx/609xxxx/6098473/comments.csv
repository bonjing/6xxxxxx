,jhusn001,2011-01-13T08:01Z,I'm doing something wrong.  I've followed step-by-step 3 times and it says Invalid Key.  I'm putting in NoJuan and JohnWho and using random numbers like 123456789.  Clearly I'm missing something simple...
,wtphreak,2011-01-22T04:24Z,i tried the patch and it worked but when i burned it tried to make me re-register and wouldnt work so patch or a serial update may be neccessary
,squidtom,2011-01-27T21:49Z,"I got it working just by putting jibberish into the registration and serial key boxes and hitting register. It took a few seconds but it came up with registration successfull.


My understanding on how the patch works is to remove the programs need to chech that the registration details ARE genuine. Hence, it sees that there is SOMETHING in each field and assuems that they are correct --> then enabling registration."
