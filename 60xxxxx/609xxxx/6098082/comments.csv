hi mate whats the difference between the above torrent uploaded by you and this one

thanks a lot for ur hard work and your innovation in activation methods
keep rocking mate"
[V],thethingy,2011-01-15T19:09Z,"arulkarthik, that torrent contained pro+ and visio & Project, this one contains all the apps in the other torrent but as single installers so if you only want certain apps then you get a smaller install footprint and only get updates for the apps you have rather than all the apps that are installed with pro+"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-01-16T01:50Z,"thanks for ur kind reply mate
keep rocking
i will support u  a lot for ur great hardwork"
,pridesal,2011-01-16T21:28Z,hello sir...rather than combining them all in one iso can you upload the popular ones like word/excel/powerpoint individualy? so it is easier to download and fatser
,pridesal,2011-01-16T21:38Z,Sorry for my ignorance....plz ignore my last comment
[V],thethingy,2011-01-16T22:23Z,"pridesal, did you find them?

,raksen,2011-02-07T01:09Z,"Thanks for this and all your torrents. Regarding the first comment about the difference between this torrent and the combine edition one, I would like to know which is the difference between doing a customize install from the office pro+ selecting only word, excel and powerpoint, and installing them as single apps."

,BigPDogg,2011-03-12T03:00Z,"thethingy, first off i want to say thanks for all the stuff you've put out. now, ive downloaded this torrent, and installed each of the apps that i wanted, however when i goto file>help, i notice that it says:

""Product Activation Required"", and also

""This product is unlicensed. Connect to your corporate network or contact your system administrator for furher assistance.""

There is a key stored in the Product ID. Is this normal or should I use one of the activators that you have?"
,BigPDogg,2011-03-12T20:35Z,"thethingy,

im pretty sure u have a life and all, but the lack of an answer is killing meeh! OR if anyone else could check their activation status which is located in File>Help, and post their status, that would be great as well too! HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP as im a paranoid mf. >:]"
,linrate,2011-03-20T04:57Z,"The programs work fine. But it says ""The product is unlicensed"".

Do we need the activator?"
