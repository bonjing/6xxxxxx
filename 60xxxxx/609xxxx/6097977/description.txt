Groove Games: Marine Sharp Shooter II

This is a simple FPS Game that has several levels of play and can be challenging if the settings are set high.

Resolution is not the greatest (but hey its only a pc cd-rom game what were you expecting?) but is a lot of fun to just kill some time with.

NO KEY NEEDED!!

Just install and play!

Let me know how it works for you please I will load the others very soon!

Please remember to seed for others!! :-)
