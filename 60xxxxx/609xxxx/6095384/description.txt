Storyline
Upon graduation from college with a business degree, 
John Issel is promptly hired by Helmes's company I.N.C. At INC, 
the one who gets ahead, does it by kissing ass, or over someone else's dead body. 
John keeps getting promotions, but cant figure out why. 
Actually management doesn't care about him, they hope that having hired him, his father,
Senator Issel, will vote the way they like.

This movie, like many in the 1980's suffers from studio slandering. The movie is brilliantly funny for the first half. An original satire on the wall street world. The second half and climax suffers from weak plotting and a silly shoot-out. Like most eighties movies. I still don't understand why they thought every comedy ought to have had one. Definitely watch this movie though. You will laugh alot.
