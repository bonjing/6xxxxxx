Second part (after "The Rise") of great History Channel doc. It uses only amateur film from the period to tell the story of the Fall of the Third Reich. Truly Amazing.
90 min.

I converted this from a TS file I found on Usenet.

I do not have the First Part, so if you do please post it since I have yet to see it.

Enjoy
