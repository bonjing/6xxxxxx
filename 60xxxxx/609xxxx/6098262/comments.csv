,NewGod,2011-01-13T03:32Z,Your file is 90 minutes long so perhaps it contains two 45 min episodes combined?
,r0ttiem0m,2011-01-23T06:05Z,Thank You so much for posting this upload.  To really understand what my relatives (and others) lived through during WWII is to know atrocity.   Seeing through their own eyes & documentation really grabbed me by the throat.  Can't remember crying this much during any documentary before.  Very powerful & eye opening.

,ditempest,2011-04-19T01:29Z,"This is not two episodes. It is the second part of History's Channel ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" (they are independent though).

As for ""The Rise"" part, you can watch it on youtube at the momment. The video is in 360p, which is ok for amateur videos of 30's and it has a decent audio quality."

,rlhq23,2011-07-25T10:32Z,"NewGod- it is a 180 minute series (two parts), so deductively, this is indeed, only ""The Fall.""...and to the uploaded and all who contributed to the series- thank you!"
