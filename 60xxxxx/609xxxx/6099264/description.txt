This a Portable version of Kundli Horoscope Software that a friend of mine wanted 

uploaded. It is used to forecast life events as per the Indian System of Astrology.

It gives a detailed about 35 page report for every prediction which can be viewed on 

computer or printed.( You have a choice to view either the North or South Indian 

Style of horoscope layout).

*THIS IS A PORTABLE VERSION OF THE KUNDLI SOFTWARE AND MAY GIVE FALSE POSITIVE VIRUS 

/ MALWARE REPORT* 

-- THOSE DOWNLOADERS WHO FEAR SUCH DOWNLOADS OR ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH SUCH 

DOWNLOADS PLEASE REFRAIN.


THIS SOFTWARE WAS MADE PORTABLE TO ENABLE ASTROLOGERS TO CARRY THE SOFTWARE IN 

PENDRIVES (OR OTHER USB DEVICES LIKE MOBILE PHONES ETC.) WHEN VISITING CLIENTS OR 

OTHERWISE TRAVELLING.

USING THE SOFTWARE :

1) Requires no installation.
2) Open the Rar file using Winrar ( http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm )
3) You will find a folder named 'bin'.
4) Within this folder you will find three files 1.'Kundli 5.0.exe' 2.'Kundli-Pro.exe' and 3.'Uninstall Kundli 5.0.exe'. 
5) Double Click 'Kundli 5.0.exe' to initialize the software.
6) Rest is pretty straight forward enter the - Date of Birth - Place of Birth - Time of Birth to generate a detailed report of your horoscope ( with the option of North or South Indian Layout ) which can be viewed on screen or printed.
