	jane siberry is a revolutionary voice within the LGBT community.  She's one of my personal idols: she's always followed her heart above all else.  To be believed, understood, and, touched by jane siberry's story you abs must learn more about this amazing woman:

	jane siberry, like fellow Canadians Neil Young and Jesse Winchester, is a quirky singer/songwriter much given to pursuing her singular artistic vision regardless of commercial potential. She is also possessed of an incredibly beautiful voice (capable of simultaneously producing goosebumps and a lump in one's throat), a gift for affecting songwriting, a wide-open heart chakra, and a really strange sense of humor. Think of the first time you heard Sinead O'Connor do "Nothing compares 2U" and you'll have some idea of the treat in store for you in searching out jane siberry's music.
