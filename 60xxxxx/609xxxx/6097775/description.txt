				NOTES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Willard Cleon Skousen (January 20, 1913 â€“ January 9, 2006) was an American 
author, conservative American Constitutionalist and faith-based political 
theorist. He was also a prolific popularizer among Latter-day Saints of their 
theology. A notable anti-communist and supporter of the John Birch Society,
Skousen's works involved a wide range of subjects including the Six-Day War, 
Mormon eschatology, New World Order conspiracies, and also parenting. His 
most popular works are The 5,000 Year Leap (strongly recommended by Glenn Beck) 
and The Naked Communist. A book by Skousen on end times prophecy, The Cleansing 
of America, was published by Valor Publishing Group in 2010, four years after 
his death.

Although Skousen was not a tax protester, he did campaign for several proposals 
to eliminate the federal income tax. One proposal, the Liberty Amendment, 
precluded the federal government from involvement in any activities that 
competed with private enterprise and returned federally-owned land to the states.

In 1971, Skousen founded a non-profit educational foundation, The Freeman 
Institute, which sought to provide students a place to read both sides of any 
political issue from original sources. In 1982, the institute became the 
National Center for Constitutional Studies (NCCS), a national organization 
headquartered in Malta, Idaho.

In the 1970s, he spoke to a Latter-Day Saint group aboard a cruise ship 
returning from Israel, stating that the previous 10 U.S. national elections 
had been illegitimate because voters had not truly had a choice. He also 
referred to what he argued was the betrayal of Taiwan hero Chiang Kai-shek.

Skousen spoke of billionaire banker David Rockefeller as being one of the most 
powerful men in the world. Skousen criticized Rockefeller for praising Mao 
Zedong in a 1973 New York Times article, in which he stated that the communist 
leader was one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century. Later Skousen 
claimed that the Rockefellers and Wall Street had conspired to elect Jimmy 
Carter president. Skousen was also known as a strong supporter of law and 
order and believed that local police departments were being undermined in 
order to promote a national police state.

In fall of 2007, political commentator Glenn Beck, who is a Mormon, began 
promoting The 5,000 Year Leap on his show, describing it as "divinely inspired" 
and written by someone "much more intelligent than myself". Leap argues 
that the U.S. Constitution is infused with Judeo-Christian virtues as well as 
Enlightenment philosophy. Skousen's son Paul Skousen asked Beck to write 
the foreword for a new edition of the book. 

After Beck began promoting Skousen's The 5,000 Year Leap in March 2009, it 
went to number one in sales on the Amazon.com charts and stayed in the top 
15 throughout the following summer. In September 2009, the book was being 
sold at 9-12 Project meetings and was often used as source material for 9-12 
Project speakers.
