,MaiAmaterasu,2011-02-15T21:17Z,"Actually, this is an IMG file after u extract so, if u don't know how to play IMG files then yeah don't download it like  canecorso83  who obviously doesn't know.
But, if u do download it, it is DVD quality with the option of subtitles which is very nice just not in english subs. I use VLC media player to play the file after extraction.
It is also Season 2 of the Dog Whisperer."
