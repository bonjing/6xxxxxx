,Junky099,2011-04-03T11:21Z,"I like when people include samples, especially with a scene of two girls having sex with each other :)
I don't know about this water-color thing. It doesn't feel like less quality (like lame DVDRips :P), it just feels different. I like it, it kinda looks cool :)
And it still beats downloading an 8-10GB BluRay, of course."
