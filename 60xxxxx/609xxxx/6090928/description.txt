Melissa Ferrick found unexpected success when Morrissey chose her to open shows for his 1991 U.S. tour, but she suffered from major-label neglect when her two studio albums failed to connect commercially. The Berkeley-schooled musician has learned the hard way about the business of music. Throughout Everything I Need, Ferrick wrestles with failed success. In the title song, she discovers a moment of peace and acceptance, while tracks such as \"I Will Arrive\" and \"I Like It That Way\" find Ferrick convincing herself she\'s got what it takes. The mix is stark, highlighting drummer Vinny Colaiuta\'s (Sting, Frank Zappa) assaultive powers. Ferrick is best, though, during her quietest moments. Her voice, strident on the rockers, relaxes for intimate effect. \"To Let You See Me\" is tender with a scathing personal indictment underneath. \"Stand Still\" is mesmerizing acoustic minimalism, a quiet, contemplative gem neatly hidden at the album\'s midpoint.
