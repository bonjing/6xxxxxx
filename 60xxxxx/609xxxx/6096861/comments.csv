I hope your're v.i.p. satus will allow you to continue uploading these fantastic torrents and this b.s. drama over the tag name doesn't lock your account for any amount of time. If u have any say in the matter with the mods let them know it is ridiculously unfair to prevent sceneline ,or anyone else, from uploading axxos torrents on piratebay. thx again for all your hard work (:"
