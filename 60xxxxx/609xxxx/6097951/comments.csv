[V],thethingy,2011-01-14T12:57Z,"v2india, its clean or it just wouldn't be here, the install was monitored and nothing goes where it shouldn't, the activator is logged with comode firewall and nothing comes in to the pc, I put a virus total report in the description so nothing is hidden from anyone, use one of the other ones if your not sure but this is fine. "

,princeofworlds,2011-03-22T00:43Z,When I call for the phone activation after I've entered in all the numbers  the automated service says it can not identify my ID.

,Ant14,2011-03-29T15:51Z,"Have a question, Ive been trying to download these programs that are like 300+ seeders, and for some reason, they just never download. Its as if it doesnt recognize other seeders out there. any idea whats preventing me doing so ?"
,hoopdedoo,2011-04-13T19:33Z,"Hi TheThingy.  This link you put to virustotal shows that the file has 9 virus alerts.  I'm curious if you're saying that the user should beware if using this file, or if you're saying that those 9 hits are false positives.  I don't quite understand those back-and-forth between TPB users, virus concerns versus dumb noobs not knowing a false positive when they see one.  Bottom line is that I don't want to get one, so how do you know for sure which ones are false positives, or if they are actually the indicated virus?  Thanks!"
[V],Scrufuss,2011-08-22T09:55Z,Just a localhost.exe file? Why does that make me nervous?
,adisyam,2011-09-29T18:51Z,Thanks man...
,superus3r,2011-12-19T07:01Z,"We all can't use the same key and claim it is for one PC. Microsoft is not a stupid company, Bill Gates STOLE this idea and RAN with it. He will keep a DEATH GRIP on his CASH flow.

Remember, this guy lives on his OWN PRIVATE ISLAND. You don't get that far in life being a dumbass.

Think for a second, you call Microsoft with a BUNK key and now they have a little more information on you.. they are just waiting for Protect IP and SOPA to pass so they can throw you away with the key.

NEVER TRUST ANYTHING THAT TELLS YOU TO DISABLE YOUR ANTIVIRUS!"
