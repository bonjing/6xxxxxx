These files unlock all levels and all Golden Eggs

Install:

Start the game at least once.
Copy and overwrite both lua files in "%UserProfile%\AppData\Roaming\Rovio\Angry Birds"
If you just want to unlock the Golden Eggs, copy and overwrite only the settings.lua

Don't forget to save a copy of the original files if you want to backup your current savegame!!


Cheers,
