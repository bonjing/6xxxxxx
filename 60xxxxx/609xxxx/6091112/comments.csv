Note, the skirmishes are preset. Just load up a tutorial and load a preset game. "

,tekissza,2011-01-17T02:13Z,How can I use this?
,steelhawk777,2011-01-30T09:17Z,"It doesn't seem to work. I made the folder and everything, but when I open the game nothing shows.."
,Poeticile,2011-02-17T09:07Z,"Are you guys reading the directions? Rofl. 

Open up a tutorial game or campaign game. Then, pause and load up a game from the skirmish or challenge saves. "
,vlcktor,2011-03-12T07:04Z,Can somebody tell how to putt the map.. step by step? Because i try but not success.. thx in advance
,vichetmeng,2011-03-31T15:31Z,Please upload more map ! I'm getting sick of playing the same maps ! :( Please !!!! 
,RAMM00,2011-07-20T07:24Z,"Okay, I don't often comment, but in this case I have read the instructions and I still get a slight problem:
there's no directory of: 

' /Documents/Blizzard/Starcraft II/Saves/Challenge ' 
The only 'Documents' folder i know of is ' ~/Documents '

in both instances I created the required folder directories(for both locations of /Documents and ~/Documents), because they weren't there originally in either of the two  locations, and loaded the maps there, but still in both cases they didn't show up. Is the folder already meant to exist or am I to create them?

And again thanks for your efforts wit the UL."
,Bladerocksta,2011-08-19T07:21Z,"i try copy the map to
User/library/application support/ blizzard / starcraft II /saves/challenge/... 
but they says  
""you may not load with starcraft ii:starter edition,
to unlock map, please upgrade to full version of starcraft.""
please someone help, how to get the full version free."
,Blackblades888,2011-10-05T23:11Z,"I have the same issue as Bladerocksta. To actually get the maps to show up on the ""Load"" in-game screen, I had to copy them over to the location...

User/library/application support/blizzard/starcraft II/saves/virtual AI

...just as he did.

However, when loading any of the maps it tells me ""This saved game can only be loaded by a previous version of Starcraft 2"", with an attached ""Yes or No"" option to ""restart and load an earlier version of Starcraft 2"". Obviously when you click no it doesn't load the map. Clicking yes restarts the program, but then gives me the same message ""You may not load with Starcraft 2: Starter Edition, to unlock map, please upgrade to the full version of Starcraft 2.""

Any help around this would be appreciated. The campaign is great and all, but I want to get my hands on some Zerg. Thanks in advance.

P.S. -Unless this problem IS possible to be circumnavigated, then don't waste your time on this torrent, at least not when applied to this version of the game.
