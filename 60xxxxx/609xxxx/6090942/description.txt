Three classic Christmas adventures with the Trotters!

Heroes And Villains: Trotters Independent Traders Company (TIT Co.) remains commercially unviable: Del is stuck with 125 unpredictable Latvian radio alarms and a boxful of baseball caps "that even East 17 fans wouldn't wear", and the council have rejected his home improvement grant application!

Modern Men: Little Damien is growing up fast but little else has changed in Mandela Towers as Del Boy, Rodders and Uncle Albert continue to lurch from one disaster to another. With the help of new man's manual, Del is learning to give attention to Raquel - if only she'd stop talking while he's trying to read. Meanwhile Rodders, 'accustomed to the security of an irregular wage', is applying for a new job. Can the Trotter business empire survive without him?

Time On Our Hands: Del's in-laws are stopping by the house for a celebratory dinner with their recently reconciled daughter. Del and Rodney are determined to make it go with a swing.
