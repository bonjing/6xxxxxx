,surjagain,2011-01-10T03:32Z,Thank you do much for this. Linux Journal is no more available on torrents and I suppose this is the first time I've seen Linux Format in English here on Piratebay.

This is the best Linux magazine in the world.
I've been buying it since issue #71.
And I will continue to buy it so that I can get the DVD that comes with it.
Sometimes it's a double-sided DVD!
But a PDF version of the magazine is very welcome!"
