hop[efully handbrake will solve this problem, albeit at 1hr/dvd"
,Gouz_max,2011-07-17T19:54Z,"Just finished dl after a month and will seed for at least a month. A:10/V:10 but be aware that xtras have been cut off.
Also files are in .iso, ready to burn into 1 single-layer DVD each."
,pp_11,2011-08-05T16:06Z,"is it better to burn this as .iso or .img? I burned two movies, one on each format and they both work fine on my dvd player. "
,pp_11,2011-08-05T16:07Z,Also this is the best torrent I have downloaded on tpb. Quality is flawless! I love it! Bought some DVD +R's to burn them onto and works like a charm! 10/10 for everything!
,pp_11,2011-08-20T12:01Z,Nearly at 100%. Wish those bloody leechers would seed as much as they take (like me!) Slowing everything down *shakes fists*
