Quote from Wikipedia:

Delirium was a Cirque du Soleil live music event partnered with Live Nation (formerly known as Clear Channel Entertainment). Contrary to the traditional Cirque show that plays over multiple weeks in a city at a time under their trademark tent or in a theater used only by Cirque du Soleil, Delirium was a multimedia/theatrical production that featured remixes of existing Cirque music and reinterpretations of performances. The show premiered on February 26, 2006 and made its final performance in London, England on April 20, 2008.
