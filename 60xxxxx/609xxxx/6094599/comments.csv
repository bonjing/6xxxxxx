Thanks again for all of your great work."

,scanovic,2011-01-11T17:48Z,"Thanks for your quick response.  When you say that they are not out, you mean they have not been submitted by anyone? Pardon my ignorance on this as I am new.  They wrapped up 1-4 already and also introduced the graphic novel tying the series back in Nov 10, 2010. It just seems that all the reliable up-loaders stopped at issue 2.  Thanks again, you are truly appreciated."
