For the first time, the ultimate insider, the owner of world famous strip clubs in Las Vegas and New Orleans uncovers the sordid, bizarre and criminal world of women who prey on the desperate, psychotic, and sexually starved men prowling Americaâ€™s topless clubs. Delve deeper into the worldâ€™s most famous adult playgrounds in this true and shocking exposeâ€™ of intriguing escapades from the man who earned millions serving up the seven deadly sins. Imagine owning a business, which satisfies one of menâ€™s basic necessities of life, a necessity for men of all ages, all income groups, and every social stratum. A business where men will pay outrageous sums - they literally will empty their wallets to watch naked womenâ€¦and they will do it, week after week. Imagine a business venture where men will never tire of appreciating your product. Men from every town within every state in the country will maneuver their busy work schedules to visit your business. They will rearrange their vacations in order to pay a visit to your establishment. Some men will divorce their wives, and even abandon their children just to spend their hard earned dollars on a young girl who will expose her breasts to satisfy their unquenchable thirst for a peek at her mammary glands. I donâ€™t have to imagine these things because I am the entrepreneur who satisfies these desires and I earn a fortune doing it.
