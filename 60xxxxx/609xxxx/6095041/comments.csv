,Lemberg,2011-01-11T21:07Z,"How many noticed that they had changed the hemp leaf on the belt buckle on super hero Conan to a hemp leaf with a big black cross over it, and that they did not comment on it?
How many notice that the politics regarding hemp is at an 1930's level of awareness?
How many believe that fears should be eliminated in order for awareness to evolve?"

,wayneking,2011-01-20T16:10Z,"Amen indeed.  Then perhaps we can finally ALL accept that the burning of ANY plant followed by inhalation of the resulting smoke cannot possibly be anything other than disastrous for our lungs.  

I love a reefer but I can't stand the idiots that claim it doesn't damage one's health and, in many cases, carry the risk of mental illness.  

I don't believe fear and lies should be the driving force of mainstream information, but nor should false propaganda of any kind.  How can smoking of any kind be good for us?  It's a stupid fucking habit that destroys our lungs and those of us who enjoy it owe it to ourselves and others to admit that and should never do it around impressionable children.  

Ignorance works both ways."

Lemberg & wayneking (Both smart men, i hope you don't get shot)
You are both right. It's time to legalise & release the true facts about cannabis. ""One joint is as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes""  -I don't believe that bullshit. I also don't believe the stupid hippies who think it's not bad for them at all. Enough government propaganda! Enough stupid hippies! We want the truth & we want the right to smoke herb. Of coarse it is still a health hazard but it can't be much worse than cigarettes & alcohol). The government is wasting billions of dollars on negative weed commercials, putting ganja smokers in prison, paying the DEA to put them there. Drug dealers are getting filthy rich in the black market . Legalise it & tax the shit out of it! Come on Obama! All black people smoke weed. You promised change!"
