The BBC TV series, from the 1990s, for learners of Scottish Gaelic: still the best way to start learning this important British language, the culture of which has been around for almost two thousand years. Potentially an endangered language, it has recently, for the first time ever, received recognition and support by the State (e.g. BBC Alba on SKY-channel 168 in the UK) instead of repression and ethnic cleansing. This language gives you access to the vibrant Celtic music scene that has exploded in recent years.
     
This folder contains videos of the twice-weekly episodes, each of approximately 25 minutes long. The BBC regularly re-broadcast the entire series (of about 72 episodes). I will Upload the other Episodes when available. Here you will find: SERIES 3 - Episodes 1 to 18 (The 'missing' episode 2 of this Third Series seems to be an error by the BBC in numbering their broadcasts this year: it went from episode 1 straight to episode 3 ....!? ).
