Hello friends,

Best wishes to you and your families in 2011. Thanks for your continuos support!NAVIGATOR team wishes to thank all the people who keep downloading our lists. We start this year little bit lately but you can understand that we also deserve few weeks for resting and relaxing. This month you will be able to download three Navigator's Lists. First of them is NAVIGATOR'S BEST INDIE COVER OF 2010. Next one will be NAVIGATOR'S BEST OF 2010 (Tommorow), and at the end NAVIGATOR'S INIDE PLAYLIST FOR JANUARY 2011 (Next Week).

Anyone who is interested in sending your own stuff (via links to downloads), we would gladly listen to your music and include it in our list or radio show if we find it good, so more people would hear it...

As always, our own radio show is on the internet radio station http://radio.elektrana.net/, every Tuesday 7pm CET. There you will be able to hear some new stuff before we upload it on the net.

We also included artwork from our good friend Andrea Rankovic. Every month you will be able to use her artwork as cover for Navigator's Fresh!! Indie Playlists.

Best regards
Navigator team
