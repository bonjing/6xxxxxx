I created this 42 minute, 90 beat per minute (BMP) run mix back in 2009. I've ran over 1000 miles and lost 30 lbs using this method that I created after I became a DJ. 

I always wanted a playlist that blended well, had nice transitions and similar beats per minute. I run at a 5 mph pace but I notice it works fine at 6 mph as well. I am 5'7" so taller runners with a longer stride may prefer a slower BMP run mix. 

I want to update and lengthen the playlist and could use some song suggestions. I prefer the inspiration of hip-hop. Custom BMP's and playlist can be made to order but the process is lengthy and time consuming. I used traktor pro and a VCI-100 to create this mix.   


Please let me know what you think of the this mix. It helped me lose weight and I'm sure it will work for you as well. Keep me posted on your progress, happy new years!
