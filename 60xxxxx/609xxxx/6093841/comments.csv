Whoever uploaded much appreciated!"
,assbastro,2011-01-12T21:47Z,"Awesome! It works fine for me fwiw. No complicated install, just drag the game folder into the Applications folder after mounting the disc. I just did a 2 hour game start after choosing the ""don't register"" option. Will see if it actually saved my game later."
,joshuaclark12561,2011-01-15T00:31Z,great upload...simple install...works well on MBP 2.53 Ghz 4G RAM NVIDIA GeForce 9400M 256MB w/ Snow Leopard 10.6.6...intro videos are a little long and buggy...i just deleted them from the Civ5 app folder
,vichetmeng,2011-01-16T01:51Z,"Yeah, I also deleted the intro video, like what Joshua said."
,orenheb,2011-01-21T10:53Z,"This is the exact torrent as the one from AhmedSheshtawy and it has still the same problems obviously. You can play ok as long as you don't save the game. Ones you try to load a saved game, it will load but only for a little while, then it will crash or bump out."
,slam999,2011-01-25T08:33Z,Can someone post the version number? Does this have the update?
,georgeyeah,2011-02-19T20:43Z,hmm doesnt seem to working on leopard :/
,askthe8ball,2011-03-03T09:26Z,This is the same file as the previous torrent (Mac OS retail) and the version is before the big patches came out.
,dtzr,2011-03-28T20:05Z,how to mount the disc with mac?
,elnazoe,2011-09-15T21:16Z,"Hmm installation goes fine, movie is fine, when the game starts, I cannot read any text anywhere in any of the menus. Anyone able to help?"
