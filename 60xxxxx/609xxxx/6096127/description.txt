A Mindful Media Production - Outback Fight Club

Outback Fight Club is a two-part observational documentary about the last remaining tent boxing troupe in Australia â€“ and possibly the world. The program follows troupe leader Fred Brophy and his merry boxing men (and women) as they sadly make their final tour across the harsh rural towns of Queensland upon Brophy's impending retirement.

It's not a matter of blood, guts and glory Ã  la Ong-bak or Street Fighter games. The gang â€“ made up of misfits, a former swimsuit model, drunken angry men, a bitch, an ex-pro fighter and a tent boxing legend â€“ are simply in it for pride, acceptance and bit of wholesome entertainment.

"Let's face it, it's the only place where you can come and have a good time and not take any clothes off!" laughs Brophy, a fourth-generation troupe leader who's been in the tent boxing business for 32 years.

Like a seasoned circus ringmaster, Brophy challenges the restless crowd to fight any of his boxers in the tent. It's just one of many forms of entertainment the local Queenslanders have alongside fairground rides and sideshows (imagine seeing this at the Royal Easter Show!).

"It takes a man with a lot of guts and courage to come up here and fight someone that they've never seen fight before," Brophy yells to the crowd, as his band of men and women stand alongside him.

"That's what you call fair dinkum Australian."

The crowd erupts. Slowly, challengers raise their hands to fight for a cash reward and more importantly, respect.

Surprisingly, it's not as gruesome as it sounds. Under Brophy's keen and watchful eye, strangers are paired up with the most appropriate boxer â€“ unruly drunkards fight Butterbean (also a drunk fighter), and boxing enthusiasts take on rising star James Ellis.

Brophy is more Mr Miyagi than a businessman; and his travelling boxers more Grasshoppers than mere employees, eagerly gleaning from Brophy's wisdom and turning their misdirected lives around. Butterbean, rather ironically, controls his deep-seated anger through boxing. Tent boxing legend The Cowboy has an undefeated track record (beating a thousand men), and hopes to win one more fight before retirement. James Ellis hopes to succeed The Cowboy as the next boxing legend. Ex-swimsuit model Jawbreaker aka Tammara is fed up with being bullied because of her Aboriginal, Dutch and Indonesian heritage. And pink Mohawk-donning Ryan just does it for his adoring lady fans.

Sadly, as Brophy edges closer to retirement and contemplates hanging up his gloves from the tent boxing game, this hugely iconic part of Australian culture and history may well disappear with him.
