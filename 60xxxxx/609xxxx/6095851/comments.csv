If the noughties were owt (not a very Bristolian word lol) to go by, I see a 90s revival approaching. The discos will be filled with BritPop and 90s chart rave music, with any luck though there will underground Trip Hop and Acid Jazz oasis's (oasi?) popping up. Looking 4word to checking this out, many thanks Villeroy"
