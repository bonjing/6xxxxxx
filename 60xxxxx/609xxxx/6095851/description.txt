Now that a new Earthling album has been released, Insomniacs' Ball, let me expose you what is a brilliant debut by one of the lesser-known bands of the Bristol scene, Earthling. AT THIS ALBUM COLLABORATED EVEN GEOFF BARROW OF PORTISHEAD. If that attracts your attention...
Be warned though: most of the songs lean towards hip-hop (some do have female vocals though, but the one who dominates is rapper Mau, who also collaborated with... Telepopmusik!), just like another forgotten Bristol band, Monk & Canatella, leaned towards rock and big beat... If you can get used to it, you may appreciate the rich-in-postmodern-ironies lyrics and especially the glorious arrangements, and how every song stands out with an idea. A five-star album (almost a concept album!) that could have reached the pantheon up there with Massive Attack and Portishead, if they had more publicity.
