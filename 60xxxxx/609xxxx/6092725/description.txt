EXPERIENCING ART AROUND US

By Thomas Buser (2006) 2nd Edition.

Torrent includes all the scanned chapters in the 2nd Edition, except Chapter 1 because it's already posted free online at Google Books:

Just copy and paste the link for the 1st Chapter.

All the chapters (2-19) are scanned to read and study for class. I used these my for classes. 
Scanned at 200 x 200 DPI - so it's great reading quality.
2 Chapters are not in color, and I apologize but this was for my own personal use that I later decided I could share instead of deleting.

So, please be gracious and don't complain. :) Thanks.
