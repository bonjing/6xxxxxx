,NewWorldOrphan9,2011-01-13T20:53Z,"Thanks EZTV!

Great quality, and btw this show is amazingly epic! Love the story, i hope it goes to a 3rd season, spread the word about this show so it ratings go up so they are kept on Prime-time TV!

Also got to watch the old 80's series that Anna's mom is the Leader of the V's in, and she is the same actress that is Anna's Mother in this episode.

Anyways keep up the good work EZTV! You make it EZ to watch my TV episode, BEFORE they air in PST in the US!"
