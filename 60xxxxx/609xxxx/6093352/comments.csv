I don't know if it's an issue with this file because I have been having similar issues a lot latley, but I got them to work for me, incase anyone else has the issues i did i'll go on. Once the set downloaded, it said the file type was just a file, no extension .jpg .rar or anything else. Thankfully I saw in the file describtion through my client (bitcommet) that it was a .rar. So I added .rar to the end of the file (that wouldn't open as it was) Then the icon changed to a rar icon and I could then unzip it and all was well and I could see more of the beauty that is this women :)  Anyone else had these issues at all, with this or other torrents?"
