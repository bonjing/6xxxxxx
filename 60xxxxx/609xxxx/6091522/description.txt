Sounds of SWC - songs created and recorded by students in the US Army
John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (USAJFKSWCS), otherwise
known as "SWC" (pronounced 'swick').

You won't even "get" most of these songs unless you've been in the Army 
and gone through Ranger School, Airborne School, or the SF Q-Course.

All original songs on this website are copyrighted but
free for download and distribution by the makers.  
Don't let us catch you trying to make money off of
them and to all you boys in Battalion that are claiming
the fame, go fuck yourselves.  Many of us come from
there, but these songs were created at the SFQC.  If
you don't know what I'm talking about, you aren't
supposed to know.  To contact us, write to
pl@soundsofswc.com.  We'll try to get back to you
within a year or so.  Maybe longer.  Keep up that
sense of humor and keep living that dream.  Scotland
Rules!!!
