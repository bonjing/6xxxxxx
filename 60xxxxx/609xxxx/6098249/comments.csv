,mr.dvd,2011-01-18T23:15Z,great upload!
,ust2,2011-01-19T12:37Z," Wish a normal cable station would pick this up already.. caught bits and pieces of few episodes during a free preview of the stations that cost extra lol.. and it was as good as any zombie flick.

 So much un-needed stuff attached to this torrent though, other than needing to deselect a few things and the use of questionable trackers, it's a fine upload."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-19T16:31Z,"ust2 there are so many dodgy torrents out there that are either fake or poor quality, some people like to get their downloads from people they can trust. That's why my other torrents are in there. They take a second to download and no one is making anyone download them."
,lolnoobyostk,2011-01-26T03:21Z,SEED FOREVER AND EVER I love The Walking Dead.Wish they had more shows like this.

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-03T16:19Z,"It's probably your codecs. In the download there's a notepad document called TSV, open it, there's a link to free codecs. Install them and you should be fine. "
,lolreject,2011-02-07T11:50Z,My roommate got our account a DMCA email to our ISP by downloading this. Just a warning to those interested in the series (Great show by the way).

,shirlzknight,2011-02-20T14:15Z,"tyvm sniffer ill seed till i turn jaffa(seedless fruit), I really wish you had started your description with a spoiler alert! also you should have pointed out that the storyline you posted is from TWD comic and no-one is sure how the TV series is going to pan out as it has already deviated from the comic some-what and contains characters not found in the pages of Mr Robert Kirkman's masterpiece...yet. Not to mention I'm only just over half way thru the books and DC's just been mentioned so you kina f'd that up for me and any other would be reader that happens upon your- has to be said, great upload!!! Keep up the good work and be mindful of spoilers please in future!! Thanks again "
