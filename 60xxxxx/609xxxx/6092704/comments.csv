[V],Slickinator,2011-01-11T07:59Z,also remember that you don't update after u do the first update as it will lose your registration info

,renton10,2011-01-11T11:55Z,"works perfectly, thanks.  make sure you follow the install instructions and copy driver.doc or will just keep asking you to register. is pretty straight forward as Slickinator has given step by step instructions for us novices .lol. excellent upload, thanks again to the uploader"

,dickeylw,2011-01-12T14:25Z,Can Liveupdate be used to keep it current?
[V],Slickinator,2011-01-12T21:16Z,no not untill a new crk is out or it will remove registration thats why u can never update when you are replacing a file with a crack because that file will get replaced again in an update 
,Psythik,2011-01-24T20:44Z,"I followed the instructions to a T but get ""incorrect registration code"" :/"

,tinkerbell0889,2011-03-09T19:56Z,"The only way I got this one to work was uninstall it and reinstall it and when it asks you to update instead of saying yes say NO, then run scan and enter code again and it works just fine."
,dads101,2011-03-21T18:38Z,"Perfect , first time install win 7 thanx"
