Memento is the most amazing film and one of my favorites of all time! I had read how good the R2 Version of the DVD was compared to the US edition because the R2 version had all the wonderful extras that would make any Memento fan very pleased. The â€œBeginning Of The Endâ€ (the film in chronological order is awesome! Itâ€™s like a completely different movie and you can better grasp the characters true intentions, though not as stylish as the original film version. So I purchased the R2 version and have it all ripped for you to ENJOY!
This is one of the best films of all time, and probably the best modern generation film noir ever, this or Pulp Fiction. Enjoy this Release and Please Seed! Cheers.
PLEASE SEED NO LEACHERS! Thanks! Vladtepes3176

Plot: (IMBD): Memento chronicles two separate stories of Leonard, an ex-insurance investigator who can no longer build new memories, as he attempts to find the murderer of his wife, which is the last thing he remembers. One story line moves forward in time while the other tells the story backwards revealing more each time.

Review:  (amazon.co.uk) An absolute stunner of a movie, Memento combines a bold, mind-bending script with compelling action and virtuoso performances. Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, hunting down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The problem is that "the incident" that robbed Leonard of his wife also stole his ability to make new memories. Unable to retain a location, a face, or a new clue on his own, Leonard continues his search with the help of notes, Polaroids, and even homemade tattoos for vital information. Because of his condition, Leonard essentially lives his life in short, present-tense segments, with no clear idea of what's just happened to him. That's where Memento gets really interesting; the story begins at the end, and the movie jumps backward in 10-minute segments. The suspense of the movie lies not in discovering what happens, but in finding out why it happened. Amazingly, the movie achieves edge-of-your-seat excitement even as it moves backward in time! , and it keeps the mind hopping as cause and effect are pieced together.
Pearce captures Leonard perfectly, conveying both the tragic romance of his quest and his wry humor in dealing with his condition. He is bolstered by several excellent supporting players including Carrie-Anne Moss, and the movie is all but stolen by Moss' fellow Matrix co-star Joe Pantoliano, who delivers an amazing performance as Teddy, the guy who may or may not be on his side. Memento has an intriguing structure and even meditations on the nature of perception and meaning of life if you go looking for them, but it also functions just as well as a completely absorbing thriller. It's rare to find a movie this exciting with so much intelligence behind it. --Ali Davis, Amazon.com

MEMORABLE QUOTES:
Natalie: What's the last thing that you do remember? 
Leonard Shelby: My wife... 
Natalie: That's sweet. 
Leonard Shelby: ...dying. 
Leonard Shelby: Memory can change the shape of a room; it can change the color of a car. And memories can be distorted. They're just an interpretation, they're not a record, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts. 
Leonard Shelby: I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different. 
Leonard Shelby: I don't even know how long she's been gone. It's like I've woken up in bed and she's not here... because she's gone to the bathroom or something. But somehow, I know she's never gonna come back to bed. If I could just... reach over and touch... her side of the bed, I would know that it was cold, but I can't. I know I can't have her back... but I don't want to wake up in the morning, thinking she's still here. I lie here not knowing... how long I've been alone. So how... how can I heal? How am I supposed to heal if I can't... feel time? 
PLEASE SEED! No LEACHERS! This is nowhere on the net, with all the marvelous extras ripped from the Memento R2 version DVD.
SEED TILL U BLEED! Cheers! Enjoy! vladtepes3176
