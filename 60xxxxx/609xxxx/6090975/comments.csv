It is absolutelly a great film and would love to watch it with my mom but she don't understand english therefore is there any chance of uploading it with CZECH subtitles? Well, of course if you will be uploading it at all. Is there anything I could help you out with, finding subs for example? Let me know...Cheers and appreciate your great downloads.."
