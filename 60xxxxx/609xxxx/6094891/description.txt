The rally is on! Four venomous computer opponents try to make your job as tough as possible as you speed around six of the most harrowing rally courses the world has ever known. Journey deep into the desert, through the lush hills of Europe, and around gigantic stadiums as you try to prove your driving superiority. The more you win, the more vehicles you can unlock but with 20 different racers to reveal, you've got your work cut out for you. There are four hardcore rally trucks included in the bunch, and each has its own independent suspension, speed, handling, and acceleration ratings to help you choose the right one. Mud throwing, fishtailing, and forcing wrecks are all par for the course, as you do what you have to in the heat of battle. Beware, though: the powerslides, rolling crashes, and head-on collisions might look cool, but they'll damage your vehicle for good. Test your mettle in a Season, or enter a Tournament, choosing from three difficulty levels and four unique perspectives. You'd better wear your helmet for this rally, folks.
