This is the award winning BBC MY family Season 1

I downloaded the xvid of 175 MBs each episodes several years ago but the quality was not enough to meet the requirements for archiving (thanks for the other uploader too)

I have bought the DVDS and im sharing for your pleasure this great rips

If you want more seasons say something in the comments about that

i will only share new seasons if i see some interest from you :)

My connection is nor very good but its something

I have uploaded the episodes to multiple public hosts likenetload, etc

you can download only the .txt file (in the torrent) and download the episodes from another host and help me seeding without downloading anything from me

Please share with me :/

Im new to this (of seeding) so some signals of good faith and do not rease the files please  its only a few gigs lol

Best regards and good 2011 to you all
