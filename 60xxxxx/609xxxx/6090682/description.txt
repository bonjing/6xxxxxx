Setting a capstone on the treatment of classical epic that she began with her extraordinary lectures on Homer, Professor Elizabeth Vandiver has created this masterful course on Virgil. 
The Aeneid is the great national epic of ancient Rome, and one of the most important works of literature ever written. It was basic to the education of generations of Romans, and has stirred the imaginations of such writers and artists as St. Augustine, Dante, Chaucer, Brueghel the Elder, Milton, Rubens, Tennyson, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot.
