,some-young-guy,2011-01-12T04:27Z,"Is there a way to set the bandwidth usage of uTorrent so as not to exceed the monthly cap?  My service was temporaily disconnected to warn me of past usage.  I dont want to leech, but if there is no other way, I can't risk having my service getting cut because then I wont be able to seed anyway.

Any thoughts or youtube links?"
