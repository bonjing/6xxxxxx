I have only viewed a few seconds of it, via VLC and I say - avoid this download for a major disappointment.  Only download 1 of the 4x1 meg VOB files to check this.  I highly recommend the Tangled 2010 TC H264 Feel-Free download instead.  That seems to be the best camera version currently out (and only camera versions are available) at it's proper normal size, instead of this monstroncity which is an extra 3 gigs longer than necessary.  Anyone can use ConvertXtoDVD to convert a AVI/whatever file to DVD format, to run on a DVD player... etc..."
