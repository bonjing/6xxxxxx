Your help is greatly appreciated."

,filmfreakout,2011-07-31T14:57Z,"Hi, downloaded and installed this and it works quite properly on a 512mb RAM pc.
The only problem is that when I try to install updates, some won't install, and .Net framework won't either. Now I need that for all of the other updates as well, please help! I can't even install my video card drivers properly and google chrome and all other browsers won't work either.
(btw only internet explorer 8 works but I prefer chrome)"
