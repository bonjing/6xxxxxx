THE BOOTLEG REDUX (TORRENT EDIT)2010

video, quicktime movie

1.9 GB, 100' 46", color, 1.85:1, single channel

Enzo Castellari's movie 'The Last Shark' is extremely similar to Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws'. Released in 1982 in the USA, it was immediately pulled out of theaters on charges of plagiarism. It is also known under the titles 'The Last Jaws' and 'Jaws Returns'.
As a way to reconcile the unauthorized copy and the original, the work slowly crossfades from one movie to the other.

The piece is exclusively available as a torrent file on a BitTorrent index (e.g.or The Pirate Bay) for as long as it is being seeded.
