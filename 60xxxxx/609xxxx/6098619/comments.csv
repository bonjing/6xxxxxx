,jcomas73,2011-01-17T00:03Z,Where i get spanish subtitles for this documentary?
,one_last_round,2011-01-17T08:29Z,"I was thinking about making  subtitles but making this took so much time that I had nothing left.

To whomever is reading this, if you know how to make subtitles google will translate them to many different languages for you.

So if someone were to make subtitles you would be helping a lot of people"
,sharifsahib,2011-01-17T19:05Z,thanks axxo it shows the real face of these people who worship the devil.....very informative
,starshine99,2011-02-03T14:16Z,"Really great, interesting.  Thank you so much."
,jaydeejj,2011-03-05T03:18Z,"Axxo didn't upload this. Someone threw that in to falsely people here. This movie is propaganda based on paranoia. If you people SERIOUSLY think that these celebrities worship demons and spirits to become famous something is seriously wrong. 

I don't understand why a person can't become famous based on talent anymore. lastcallforfreedom1 is a religious conspiracy nut. Logic can solve anything."

,Jon1001,2012-04-09T14:45Z,"This is not a documentary. It's youtube videos edit into a long youtube video.
The guy who made this must be really paranoid or a little bit into the devil himself. He claims that the movie has an importent message, and that message is something like: If you believe in everything you hear, you will get really paranoid.

As a cure to this I recommend a hat made of silver folie.

On the other hand this movie shouldnÂ´t be banned from youtube or any other places. ItÂ´s totally harmless. And it should be watched by those who want to watch it. Personally I would prefere a bed time story, if I want to hear about ghosts."
