Brave New World is the twelfth studio album by Iron Maiden, released on 30 May 2000. It marked the return of longtime lead singer Bruce Dickinson (who left in 1993) and guitarist Adrian Smith (who left in 1990) to the band. It was also the band's first studio recording with three guitar players, as Janick Gers stayed with the band after Smith's return.

The album art and title song are references to the novel of the same name written by Aldous Huxley. The upper half of the album art was done by Derek Riggs. The bottom half was done by digital artist Steve Stone. Similarly, the line 'Brave new world' is repeated in the pre-chorus in an earlier song by the band, "Stranger in a Strange Land", from Somewhere In Time. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson calls this his favorite album, replacing Piece of Mind.

The songs "The Wicker Man" and "Out of the Silent Planet" were both released as singles. "The Wicker Man" was released in the U.S as a promo single with extra vocals in the chorus.

Brave New World Tour was the tour supporting the album. During the tour, the show in Rock in Rio was released as a live album.

Brave New World peaked at the seventh spot of the United Kingdom charts, and has since been certified Gold. In the United States, it debuted at 39th of the Billboard 200, and sold over 307,000 copies.
