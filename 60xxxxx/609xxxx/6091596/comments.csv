Keith Jarrett - The Kรถln Concert (Studio Master) [FLAC]

Fucking TPB!"
[T],rjordan21,2011-01-09T16:34Z,"^^^^ Ha! Well, depending on your perspective Mr. Jarrett could be a ""studster"" too on the piano.

It coulda been worse.

Thanks for this...."
[T],insinuendo,2011-01-09T17:02Z,"LOL!

Enjoy :)"

Just wanted to thank you for the Studio Master upload. Found a couple of these on the net and they are excellent quality.

Any more ECM releases would be very much appreciated.

Looking forward to giving you a Quality:+ when I had a listen.

Thanks so much for this: now I can replace my inferior CD which replaced a well-worn vinyl copy of the complete concert!"
