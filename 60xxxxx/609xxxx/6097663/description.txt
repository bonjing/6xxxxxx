Plot: 

A poetic love story that follows Manchester and Noon as they enjoy a long, hot, summer romance. Noon is our narrator, a shy taxidermist who keeps a silent menagerie in the freezer alongside Manchesterâ€™s ice pops. Manchester documents their affair, creating wonderfully charged images with just a couple of cheap, instamatic cameras. When a wealthy gentleman called Franny discovers Manchester and launches his photography on the art world, the success destroys the beauty of their once idyllic life.
