,hello40204,2011-01-13T13:01Z,"just preview the movie. the sound is as bad as the others and the video is worse than the other cams around , imagine is much better. that is what i found out when i compared both. not worth dl this one . "
,hello40204,2011-01-13T13:03Z,"over done with filters. too much brightness and makes the video worse, more blurry."

[V],globeplus,2011-01-13T19:49Z,"To the guys on the last comments : please enjoy other files and i watch them too and my work is absolute positive , i am more than shore of that  . Thank you and it is amazing your concerne in difficulting and causing trouble to other peoples uploads , then can be the day that the users want this type of file as an option with a correct work by the dub plugins and donÂ´t have the files , why ? because people like you that simply make an effort for depreciate no matter what the other people uploads like win something with that , one thing is for shore : if you have more options to get the files that canÂ´t be that bad and please watch this one on the other files , be my guest ( of course i am talking for the no matter what i want to depreciate this file guys ... ) . Thank you and happy viewing to the rest of the users ."
,LEERV,2011-01-13T21:11Z,"Okay listen. Globeplus is an absolute gobshite, if indeed he/she did actually do any work of his/her own on this movie he/she must still realise it's absolute shite. I mean come on, what a load of bollocks, get a life you wanker.
The point is this is an absolute shit file, download it at your own peril "

The point is this is an absolute shit file, download it at your own peril, it works just but it's really unwatchable. It's really crap and by the way Globus,  if you can't speak or write in English will you please fuck off and stop wasting our time."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-14T02:32Z,"To leerv : i ask myself who ask your opinion in first place ? and if you donÂ´t like a file why you have to say it to the uploader ? YouÂ´re crazy ! You simply are missing good manners and the respect for the good intention that the uploaders can have sharing nice work to the possible interested users and i can present the files in another languages , i speak in english better as possible with a correct intention , it is nothing about uploading that force me talking english or maybe i just stop talk or simply answer in another languages , why not ? What exact is your point having that atitude , you donÂ´t want a file i understand but just donÂ´t be ridiculous with the uploader and choose another file , i think you are beeing disrepectfull without making sense , just donÂ´t put more comments on my files , you donÂ´t like , choose other files , thatÂ´s all ."
,barnybear,2011-01-14T19:06Z,globeplus watched http couldnt belive the diff. down load file looking forward to viewing thenks
,saint_1,2011-01-14T21:33Z,A/V quality anyone?
,5amjr,2011-01-15T07:10Z,bollox!
,5amjr,2011-01-15T08:34Z,"Thanks for uploading but the quality is woeful m8. Trying to compensate for the darkness of an awful cam by brightening some sections to the point of Siezures for non-epileptics! lol
I'll wait for a screener!!"
,c.iulian,2011-01-15T20:22Z,ok so is this movie working or not?
[V],globeplus,2011-01-15T22:45Z,"To 5amjr :  keep like that and the Hollywood doors will be open for you as a critic , try to maintain the correct balance analising all the possible aspects that can be considerated to analise a good CAM , remember the oscars of this year not to far away , so keep and improve your capacity of analysis and maybe the Academy can call you !!!

Thank you for your comment ."
,soldierofthelam,2011-01-16T00:29Z,"@globe
Your horrible attempt in bashing people for not making a decent movie is amusing!!!
  And like your games you download someone else material . your took another cam copy that you didn't even record yourself and make a bigger file than the original and chop the video up horribly beyond anyone able to watch the movie.

so why should we give credit to you for trying?
people are going to give negative comments when the download it and find it horrible. stop crying GLOBE. you nothing but lie a tracer on comics all you do is take from others and claim its your own.
grow the fuck up, leave the movies to us big rippers and keep to your crappy repack games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

,crook01,2011-01-18T21:51Z,"@soldierofthelam  tracer, lmao good call my friend

@glodeplus    dude do you really think badmouthing ur leachers is gonna make you look good, fact is you've uploaded what sounds to me (as i wont be downloading) a shit cam, labeled it as an AVI so noone can bitch at you for calling it a screener or whatever, and people didnt like it. point is stop wasting your time winging and go earn your green skull by finding a better copy."
,DjemZi,2011-01-23T12:08Z,Appreciate ur effort Globeplus. My critic goes only to the camera position...u know all heads are cut off and it  gets really weird watching Nicolas cage cheek all the time... One more time tks for ur effort but i would rather wait for a better copy. Cheers 
,blusniffer,2011-03-03T01:04Z,"Everything he does is someone else's shit cam which he puts through the free dub plugin and reuploads it as globeplus. It's more like globeplus(the sad guy who made the file).

Your attack on 5amjr is another example of your ignorance to the quality of this sites users. Every torrent you get abuse for their quality, do you think everyone is wrong and your right?

You need to wake up as your aim is quantity rather than quality.
"
,blusniffer,2011-03-03T01:11Z,"You can upload 5000 torrents but green skull or not your a centimetre above the Fakers as their shit is unwatchable too.
Speak to brickop, bone, heist, etc and learn a thing or two and then maybe you wouldn't be the most criticised 're-uploader' on piratebay!!!!"
