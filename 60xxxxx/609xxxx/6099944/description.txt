"This is an Art Attack. THIS is an Art Attack. THIS IS Art Attack!"

Art Attack was a British children's television series revolving around art. It was one of ITV's longest running programmes, running from 1990 to 2007. It was presented throughout by Neil Buchanan. The show involves Buchanan producing three or four works of art, taking the viewer through its production step by step.

One of Art Attack's most famous inclusions is the Big Art Attacks. These are pieces of art done by Buchanan on a huge scale, out of various objects, often on a playing field, tarmac ground and similar.

Luckily I was able to find the correct episode numbers from descriptions online. The S15 eps are from Knowledge Network and the S19 eps are from TVO (slightly edited, I think). All Nov/Dec 2010 airings.

I believe these meet the definition of PDTV but they're lower quality than what a UK capper could get since they're converted from PAL to NTSC frame rate by the distributor.

There are more PDTVs from someone else of S19 eps on some other tracker if anyone could find seeds.
