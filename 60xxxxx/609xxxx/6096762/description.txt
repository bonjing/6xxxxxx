         Throughout his career, Jim Carrey has played a number         
         of eccentric characters, perhaps most notable the pet         
         detective Ace Ventura, but he has also appeared in dramatic   
          roles, as in "The Truman Show" and "Man on the Moon."

         We're giving up on trying to figure out seasons and           
         episodes for this show. TVRage says S16, but Bravo says       
         S17. However, Bravo doesn't define which episodes are         
         in S16 and which are in S17, so the year is good enough       
          for us.
