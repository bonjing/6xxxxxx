Efterklang touring member Anna Broensted crafted her own unique sound as 

the leader of Our Broken Garden, and the groupâ€™s second album, Golden 

Sea, put their music in an even more particular place: it's a swirl of sounds too 

strange to be immediately accessible, but too smooth to be called challenging. 

Broensted and companyâ€™s skill at fashioning atmospheres is stronger than ever 

on Golden Sea, from the somber, rippling pianos on â€œThe Departureâ€ that 

conjure a moonlit journey, to the hidden final song that glows like an aurora 

borealis. Nearly every track feels like itâ€™s swathed in fog, and on songs such as 

â€œIn the Lowlands,â€ Broensted's vocals remain one with the mist surrounding 

them. While her voice is lovely, her melodies stay in a safe, similar range 

instead of scaling highs and lows -- an approach that extends to much of 

Golden Sea. Yet, just when it feels like the album has receded into the 

background for good, something intriguing pulls it back into focus: the hand 

drums and Middle Eastern-tinged melisma on â€œNightsongâ€ or the distant 

electro-toms on the oddly cheery â€œThe Burial.â€ Our Broken Garden reaps 

even richer rewards whenever the band ventures into more daring territory: 

â€œThe Fiery and Loudâ€ isnâ€™t particularly fiery or loud, but its yearning mood 

and fairy-tale melody give it urgency and drama, while â€œGarden Growâ€ is a 

surprisingly sexy standout with a stomping, Goldfrapp-esque beat and visceral 

lyrics like â€œrip my heart out if you have toâ€ and â€œthrow me naked on the 

floor.â€ All the elements of Our Broken Garden's sound are promising on 

Golden Sea, but Broensted and crew are still learning to move beyond subtle, 

hypnotic music and toward something more dynamic.
