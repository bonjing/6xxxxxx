,prasnto,2011-01-15T01:45Z,"The FRAGMENT release of the film (likely sourced from the UK DVD) is heavily cut. Missing not only the 'controversial' scene of the cow being killed, but almost every other scene in the film is also cut (in whole, it is nearly 10 minutes cut!)

Those who don't like watching censored copies of movies should go get the TRL release (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5267256/Baaria.2009.iTALiAN.DVDRip.XviD-TRL-%5BWiNetwork-bt%5D ) which is uncut. "
