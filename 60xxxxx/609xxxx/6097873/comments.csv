,Germanus,2011-01-19T23:46Z,"What you talk about? Only your need - install pack, and, than install update for it. Read .nfo included.
Convertor need serial, but keygen included too."
,xbeau,2011-02-09T23:44Z,There is NO key Gen. There is NO serial. There is NO update. There is NO nfo with relevant info about unlocking the software
,thomasomally1000,2011-03-01T14:06Z,Im using a mac? Do you have to install all 5 discs (I know it sounds silly but it looks like im installing the same thing over again) Plus wheres the keygen for the serial number?
,leptoone,2011-03-08T06:52Z,Please seed guys...
,tangovic,2011-03-23T13:39Z,"JUST GIVE US THE SERIAL THANKSSS

BECAUSE IVE TRIED LIKE 2 DAYS TO GET IT TO WORKK!"
,QuidamPhoenix,2011-06-05T17:03Z,"It works just fine. All that was needed was a look around.

After you mount Disc 1, explore the contents. Not only is there an installer, but the NFO explaining how to install/crack as well as the updates are all there.

Thanks Germanus!"
,Ecuze,2011-07-02T15:11Z,"It's not often I comment but I just want to thank you for this upload. And I see that some people are having the same problem as I had, to bypass the serial key etc. So I just want to help! 

First of: You get the serial screen because you have installed the ""bfd.dll"" file into the wrong folder. So...  

1. Mount cd 1 (I use power iso)

2. Go to ""my computer"" and into cd1, Install BFD2 

2. Update ""BFD2 Data Installer"" 

3. Mount and install cd 2, 3, 4 & 5 (these cd's will install all the sounds into bfd2) 

4. IF the software ask about serial, then you have installed the dll into wrong path. Find the bfd.dll file and put it into right folder (for me it was; C:\Program Files (x86)\FXpansion\BFD2)

5. Have fun! "
,Jayaro,2011-07-02T21:48Z,"I have just another problem. On mac you cannot see nfo and if even software was installed successfully without serial number, a lot of audio files do not work because ""failed to load because it refers to an unknown kit piece (usually"
,Jayaro,2011-07-02T21:52Z,"this is caused by authorization fail"". So please, Windows users, show us the NFO, how to install this crack without SN ? Or how to get SN ?
Regards"
,breadnubs,2011-12-10T22:23Z,"Thanks for the upload.  I still, however, can't figure this out.  No matter what I do it keeps asking for the serial.  I successfully installed but can't get past the license manager.  Has anyone with a mac solved this problem?  Thanks"
,dollygrip,2012-01-25T20:37Z,"Still seeding,

Questions though. I click the Mac OSX installer, im asked for my system password, I enter it. Then nothing happens, the installer does not run, I dont get any error messages or anything, can anyone help"
,Jmscanadyy,2012-02-28T05:19Z,"First, I want to thank Germanus for this torrent! Great job man! This software seems to be the answer to my prayers! Thank you so much again!

Next, I want to explain how I got this to work on my G5 imac PowerPc. It runs Leopard 10.5.8 and has a 2ghz CPU and 2 gigs of ram:

After I downloaded the torrent and opened the file, there were 5 iso files inside of it. You must mount (Double-click) and start with the very first iso file and run the installation package within it. This package will eventually have you choose a destination for all of the audio files to go in order to create an audio path for the program. I simply chose the original BFD2 folder that I saved the torrent to, created a new folder named ""BFD2 Audio"" within it, and chose that newly created folder. It will pop up saying something like ""This file doesn't exist, do you want to create it?"" Just click yes. The remaining iso files and their audio data will automatically be directed there from here-on-out. After completing the first installation package for the first iso, move on to the second iso file, mount it, and run its installation package, followed by the third, the fourth, and finally, the fifth iso file. 

And after completing that, it seems that this is where a lot of problems are coming from for the mac users at this point: If you install all five installation packages from all five iso's and simply try to run BFD2 right away, it will ask you for a serial number. What you have to do is, directly after you finish installing the fifth installation package from the fifth iso, you must go back to the very first iso file, mount it/open it up, and then run the update package found in the update file within that first iso. After you do this, the program no longer asks you for a serial number, and it should work like a charm!

On another note, I figured that I should cover a problem that I encountered, which was entirely my fault, and not the torrent's:

At first, I was confused about choosing a folder for the audio data, like I explained above. On my first shot at installing the program, when the first iso asked me for a location, I created a folder called 'BFD2 Audio"" just like I did in the directions above, except that I created the 'BFD2 Audio"" folder on my desktop, instead of in the original BFD2 torrent folder. After completing the installation and having saved the new audio files to the desktop ""BFD2 Audio"" folder, I wanted to move that desktop ""BFD2 Audio"" folder into the original BFD2 torrent folder, so I simply clicked the ""BFD2 Audio"" folder and dragged and dropped it into the original BFD2 torrent folder on the desktop. After I did this, the program could no longer load any of the audio files and samples for the actual drum sounds, and I couldn't figure out why.

Eventually, after toying with the program, I found out that it was due to the data path being corrupted. What I had to do was open up the BFD2 program, and at the top left you will see five tabs. The fifth one to the very right of the five of them looks like a box with a check mark inside of it. If you click it, you will see a data path inside of a window. Basically, I had to click the add (+) symbol and find the ""BFD2 Audio"" files folder within the original BFD2 torrent folder on the desktop. I selected that folder (BFD2 Audio), added it, and all of the samples worked again.

In short, when I dragged and dropped the ""BFD2 Audio"" files folder from the desktop into the original BFD2 torrent folder on the desktop, the original data path was corrupted and destroyed, because it was no longer found in Desktop>BFD2 Audio. Instead, it was now in Desktop>BFD2 torrent folder> BFD2 Audio. See what I'm saying? The data path has to be correct in order for the program to be able to have a path to find the audio files.

In order to avoid all of that mess again, I simply reinstalled, and did what I did as I explained in the third paragraph above. I hope that this helps!

Thanks again Germanus! Now seeding!"
,pznmn,2012-03-27T16:38Z,Hello and thank You Germanus at first! I'd like to ask can i do update of the program? It don't want to work with ableton and i thought it would help. 
,strategus,2012-05-05T14:43Z,"Thank you very much for this wonderful treat Germanus!

I'm still downloading it @ 50kB/S...
Please, fellow pirates, SEED!!! "
,Thrashmetalshit,2012-06-14T18:58Z,"Works 100% perfect! Norton discoverd a trojan.gen in the keygen to the converter. I turned off norton and then runned the keygen. Then I runned a virus scan after I was done, and Norton didn't find any trojans. Thank u so much!"
