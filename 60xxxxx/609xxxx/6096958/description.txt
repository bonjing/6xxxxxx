Here are all 4 Water Boys (ã‚¦ã‚©ãƒ¼ã‚¿ãƒ¼ãƒœãƒ¼ã‚¤ã‚º) productions:
2001 - Waterboys - Movie
2003 - Water Boys - 11 episode series
2004 - Water Boys 2 - 12 episode series (ep 12 is a 2-parter)
2005 - Water Boys 2005 Summer (ã‚¦ã‚©ãƒ¼ã‚¿ãƒ¼ãƒœãƒ¼ã‚¤ã‚ºã€€ï¼’ï¼ï¼ï¼•å¤) - 2 part series special

English subtitles included. Also for completion is a Fukuyama Masaharu soundtrack theme. I know there's more soundtrack material out there-- if you have any, send it my way and I'll include it in a new collection.

The broken-up .avi's can be joined on a Unix filesystem command line with the 'cat' command, like this:
"cat file.avi.001 file.avi.002 file.avi.003 file.avi.004 > file.avi" (without the quotes)
There's probably some freeware program for Windows that can accomplish the same.

I downloaded all these from various places and don't claim the original rips or subtitle work as my own. I just wanted to share my whole collection as a tribute to all the cute, Asian boys in speedos everywhere, and to those that appreciate them. ;)
