,CrispyVictim,2011-01-10T20:35Z,"Maybe it's just me, but the audio seems to be off by a fraction of a second. I've tried Media Player Classic and Windows Media Player 12."
,CrispyVictim,2011-01-10T20:37Z,Got it working in SPlayer.
,Whelmont,2011-01-12T01:04Z,"This up works pretty fine! And I would like to appoint an awesome media player: VLC Media player. It have the portable edition too, so you don't have to install nothing at all... (and yes, it plays .MKV and both HD 720p/1080p files perfectly). So, before complain about the media, test the video in another (good) player.
Thanks to the UP eztv... you are great! \o/"
