,codycook,2011-01-13T00:14Z,I downloaded this for the mac... and it asked me to authorize purchase for zimagur@mail.ru. I wasn't ever able to get it to work. Didn't try others.
,codycook,2011-01-13T00:17Z,"Found a fix for the mac.


1. Open the DMG file and copy the Angry Birds app to your Application Folder
2. Go to the Mac App Store and download any free app
3. Go to your Applications Folder, right click on the free app you just downloaded and chose Show Package Contents.  Select _MASReciept Folder and Command C to copy to clipboard.
4. Now select the Angry Birds app and right click and chose Show Package Contents and Command V to Paste.
5. Play game"
