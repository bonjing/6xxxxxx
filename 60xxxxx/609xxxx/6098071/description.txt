Downhome Flatpicking Guitar (with TAB)
Taught by Jody Stecher


"Jody Stecher is a total musician with a sense for musical nuance 

which few of his peers can match. His repertoire is unbelievable."
The Village Voice

Jody Stecher has long been Americaâ€™s least generic flatpicker. 

From the teenage hotshot who won the 1966 Worldâ€™s Champion 

Flatpicking Cup at Union Grove North Carolina to the mature and 

reflective artist who was twice Grammy nominated in the 1990s, 

Jody has always played his own style. Here he presents the 

technical nuts and bolts for you to make your own personal style. 

This DVD is both a roadmap of Jodyâ€™s development as a flatpicking 

guitarist of mostly American vernacular music, and a guide to how 

any flatpicker can expand their expressive technique. Think of it 

as "Flatpicking According to Jody". 

Itâ€™s a graded course starting with basics in which the technical 

relationship between fingerpicking and flatpicking is made clear. 

The first few pieces are great songs with memorable melodies but 

minimal fingering so that right hand fundamentals can be mastered. 

With each new tune more techniques are introduced and more and 

more fingerboard is used, both horizontally and vertically. The 

second half of the DVD is purely instrumental music and the tunes 

are more complex. 

Titles include: Carterâ€™s Blues, Itâ€™s Hard To Love, I Got A 

Bulldog, Leake County Blues, Arkansas Traveler, The Dawn and The 

Ship in Full Sail
