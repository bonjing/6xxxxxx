thanx :)
waitin for primal fear :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-12T08:28Z,"@muthineni: I watched Rileys BluRay two days ago, good drama, Gandolfini good as ever.
Heavy theme, about two lost souls who try to help third one. How knowing that out there is someone willing to help is more desired than help itself.

Sorely, my hard disk died next morning and I suggest downloading from others."

Can you please encode
1. Appleseed 2004 (BRrip in Eng and Jap)."
[V],twentyforty,2011-01-12T09:57Z,"@i_am_sid: Appleseed One and Two has been encoded two days ago. But:
Read the last sentence from my comment above, point being, ... as soon as possible.

And - I have strict ""policy"" regarding the language of the movies: I encode original audio only (if available) and provide subtitles for other languages. Besides - it's done, when I up the pack - take it or leave it."

[V],twentyforty,2011-01-12T15:37Z,"@ToxicAssKicker: I have only iPod compatible 272p, I cannot rip DVD anew since I don't have it anymore. (even then DVD could be ripped to max. 480p).
Several XviDs could be found on Internet, I googled them right now."
