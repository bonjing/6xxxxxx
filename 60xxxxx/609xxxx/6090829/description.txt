      HWMonitor is a hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems        
      main health sensors: voltages, temperatures, fans speed.                
                                                                              
      The program handles the most common sensor chips, like ITE IT87         
      series, most Winbond ICs, and others. In addition, it can read          
      modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives        
      temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature.              
      Special hardware monitors such as abit uGuru and Gigabyte ODIN          
      power supplies serie are supported too.                                 
                                                                              
      In comparison to its classic counterpart, HWMonitor Pro adds the        
      following features:                                                     
      * Remote Monitoring - Watch the sensors of one or several distant       
        PCs through a simple TCP/IP connection.                               
      * Graph Generator - Save monitoring data and generate logging           
       graphs as bitmap files.                                                
      * Improved Interface - Sensors in system tray, editable sensors         
        labels ...                                                            
      * PWM Control - Fan PWM control (for ESA compliant devices).
