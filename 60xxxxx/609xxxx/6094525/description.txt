Discover the truth about this ancient medicine as world-renowned scientists in the field of cannabinoid research

illustrate their truly mind-blowing discoveries.


â€œWhat if Cannabis Cured Cancerâ€ explains how we are all born with a form of marijuana already in our bodies,

and when pot is consumed, the â€œendocannabinoidsâ€ inside usâ€”along with any cannabinoids we ingestâ€”fit together like

a key in a lock. Thereby promoting the death of cancer cells without harming the bodyâ€™s healthy cells.



A powerful and eye-opening film about the future of cannabis â€” and perhaps even the future of medicine.
