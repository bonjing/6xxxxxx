,dee07killer,2011-04-24T07:27Z,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1638943/

the file is not corrupt im one of the people seeding it.
the audio quality is good and video quality id good but at some parts the video quality goes bad.
this however does not subtract from the overall quality of information that this video holds.
share this torrent there are many who still don't know about this sacred plant and its power to heal."
,Philonetic,2011-06-13T05:25Z,"There is a CURE FOR CANCER that was recently discovered in Canada in the form of a DIETARY SUPPLEMENT

If you or anyone you know is afflicted with any type of cancer, please research into this as it HAS BEEN PROVEN but will NEVER be approved by the FDA. 

Also look into - Hemp seed consumption.  Cooked seeds provide almost everything the body needs including ALL VITAMINS, many minerals, proteins (i just realized, I before E except after...T? wtf)"
,Panlux,2011-08-25T04:12Z,"Raw hemp seeds are even better -- get dehulled hemp seed (as ""Hempnut"" & others) and put in in your salads.  
   For cancer, also use oxygen therapy - a simple way (and cheap) is to just soak in a tub with a half quart of hydrogen peroxide, 3 %.  Also: NO SUGAR.  Sugar causes cancer;  oxygen will kill the cancer virus.  Weed helps."
