,PNWpirate,2011-01-22T01:35Z,"Amidst power cuts, strikes and boot-boy aggro on the football terraces, Joe McCain (Martin Compston), is bored of a life thatâ€™s going nowhere. Enter hair-dresser Jane (Nichola Burley). Blonde, brassy, and moving to the beat of a whole new world of sound, movement and all-nighter dancing at The Wigan Casino - the home of Northern Soul.

Mandy (Felicity Jones), a cute and spunky artist, is eager to help Joe become the cool â€œsoul boyâ€ he wants to be. Mandy falls for Joe and a love triangle develops with Jane and Mandy, and Joe has to decide who he really wants in his life.
