Plot Summary: Next in the four-part Marvel Anime project and broadcasts after the Iron 
Man anime. Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical 
capabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him 
to recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate

The first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to 
rescue Mariko from her father. At this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan 
adventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his 
concepts of honor and family. The episode deals with him going into household and 
intending to take Mariko back but he ends up fighting her father with wooden swords and 
he's soundly defeated, not understanding what's going on and why he wasn't able to take 
down an old man.

The opening episode covers a lot of ground that takes us back to the early 80's 
incarnation of Logan. He's rough, somewhat easily riled and a bit more animalistic. The 
episode brings in Mariko and Logan easily enough and it also introduces A.I.M. to the 
show as the background villain organization through which various ties will emerge. 
Wolverine kills off several people in the episode, A.I.M. and yakuza alike, and it's got 
a fair share of bloody but it's not exploitative violence with entrails all over 
the place.
