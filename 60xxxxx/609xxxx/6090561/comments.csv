They've never let reality get in the way of their mumbo jumbo!"
,shinehigh247,2011-01-27T12:13Z,"Apparently you havent done too much research on the Shorud, Rosie...Don't talk shi!t if you don't know what you're talking about.

The Shroud has had people in awe for a long time.  They've taken it out on public display many many many times.  When they hold it, people hold the edges..where they happened to do the carbon testing on. There's any number of factors that could've influenced the results of their testing...like 100's of peoples nasty-ass hands touching the fabric over 100's of years.  Are you a scientist that looked into the facts, did the testing, and absolutely know for a fact that this Shroud is fake? 

One science gives a theory, then it becomes fact! right? Science is ALLLWAYYS right..."
,jimmyg4life,2011-03-03T18:36Z,"no shinehigh247 it is the complete opposite, science is always evolving and moving forward, religion on the other hand has the same old information and if something is unknown then religious freaks say their god did it. Religion is pathetic."
,tkm99,2011-03-14T17:03Z,"The Truth, whether it came from religion or science, is the only unwavering thing. Both science and religion change, as is obvious to anyone with common sense."
,2kevlane,2011-04-17T07:30Z,"Rosie, one more thing.  It has been proven that the corner where they took the sample to test had been fixed somewhere around the 13th century (a very small section at that corner).  That information was passed onto the media shortly after releasing the information that it tested to the 13th century.  However, the media didn't sensationalize that bit of information like they did the carbon dating test.  Just thought you should know."

,sarsapil,2011-05-01T21:39Z,"It's incredible to what an extent believers will go to deny the truth and stick to their beliefs... The scientists who did the test knew perfectly well what they were doing. they've done it thousands of times  for archaeologists with results that match other related evidence, the believers reject and discredit because nothing should shake their naive, wimpy belief in the authority of their leaders. Sad, gullible people... "

If the pagan christian cult of Jesus/Joshua hadnÂ´t stolen most of the story of James the Just we would have talked about James Christ as the resurrected one."
,Helmer2,2011-08-16T17:58Z,"The samaritan prophet, aka Jesus or more accurately Joshua, was executed by Pilate because he tried to start a rebellion on Mount Gerizim. The most likely way of execution was decapitation, which seems to be the usual way for the romans to execute jewish rebel leaders. This historical person was one of those the pagan Jesus cult used to create the ficticious character of Jesus Christ."
