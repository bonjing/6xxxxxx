
Carl Cox to Release Global Underground â€“ Black Rock Desert
Electro House Music
Release Date: January 25, 2010

Carl Cox releases his debut Global Underground mix album, â€˜Black Rock Desert,â€™ on 25 Jan 2010. Taken from a storming 2 hour set in The Opulent Temple in the Black Rock Desert this summer.

No label encapsulates dance musicâ€™s international explosion and restless creativity quite like Global Underground. Launched in 1996 with a Tony de Vit mix album based on a visit to Tel Aviv, it has expanded from a world-famous series of defining DJ mix CDs into all areas of cutting edge dance music. They have released artist albums for acts like James Lavelleâ€™s UNKLE, soundtracked some of the worldâ€™s most popular TV shows, including CSI, and some of PlayStationâ€™s biggest selling games, and staged fantastic parties in some of the worldâ€™s most exotic locations â€“ not to mention selling over three million CDs. And now theyâ€™ve touched down in Nevada.

â€œWhen I finally decided to do a Global Underground mix it just had to be here ,â€ says Carl. Everything aside from the entrance fee is free. Itâ€™s all about sharing and contributing to the experience. People barter, offering everything from free artwork installations to free flirting lessons and drinks. And Nevada looks like a scene from mad Max.

He was so moved by the event, he resolved to keep coming back every year. â€œItâ€™s people who are there for their own reasons â€“ whether itâ€™s to laugh, to cry, to have sex, to listen to music, whether you want to run around naked, or fully clothed,â€ says Carl. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter if you are a big DJ. Itâ€™s all about what you want to give. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of my own money to play here, but I donâ€™t care. I give people my music and I get back a lot of love. Thatâ€™s enough.â€

â€œAfter the Ibiza season, after the festivals Iâ€™ve done, after my own events,â€ he said, â€œthe story still continues in a massive way â€“ Iâ€™m working with new people, seeing different places and Iâ€™m overjoyed the Global Underground team got me on board for this mix.â€
