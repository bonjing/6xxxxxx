This is the soundtrack to what is perhaps possibly one of the best tongue-in-cheek black-comedy zombie movies featuring musical narration from a hip-hop cowboy and starring 2 members of the Carradine clan made in the last five years. He waves his freak-flag high with this release. 


Some of the songs on the soundtrack are the narrator bridging the scenes (the narrator, Zach Selwyn, actually exists in the movie, though, and he and his band get turned into zombies, too). It's totally bizzare, tongue-in-cheek, and brilliant.

So, a great country/hip-hop/folk soundtrack to an equally quirky movie. Both are highly recommended.
