I used Freecorder to rip the music off of Foamo's MySpace Music Page. I'd set the freecorder to 320kb/s, but I can't guarantee that's the actual quality. The files sound good though, so I'm sure it's all right.

Torrent Includes the following .mp3s:

Bulletproof (Foamo Remix)
Centavo
Damian Marley & Nas (Remix)
Diplo & Laidback Luke (Remix)
Half In Love (Foamo Remix)
Jookie
Major Lazer (Remix)
Rockerman
Superman

Enjoy!
