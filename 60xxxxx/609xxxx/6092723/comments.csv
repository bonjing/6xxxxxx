[V],tonyisaac,2011-01-10T14:14Z,Volume file  vmt-jgboat-xvid.r48 is missing so extraction not possible!
,f.kruger,2011-01-10T17:11Z,"Cut and paste the avi that appears BEFORE cancelling stalled extraction. This will give you a COPY of the avi extracted, this will play ok, or it appears to. You can copy files that are partially extracted and then play them. Most times  you will get whatever % of rar you have."
,richardpa,2011-01-11T02:59Z,"r48 and r49 are missing... 
you could always download the missing files from one of the other rar file versions and just add them..."
,general_monash,2011-01-14T03:49Z,"Agree, this RAR is fucked, missing 48 and 49.

To keep the extracted RAR anyway, if using UnRarX, change the preferences to keep 'Keep broken extracted files', that way it won't delete the extract when it detects the error. It might play okay."
