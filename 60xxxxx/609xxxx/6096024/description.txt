In a live, three-day stripped event Professor Brian Cox and Dara O Briain look to the skies to bring the wonders of the stars into viewersâ€™ living rooms.

Though he trained as a physicist Dara is secretly a frustrated astronomer â€“ heâ€™s been living with an unopened telescope in his attic for as long as he can remember. So Brian takes Dara on a crash course of the skies, showing him how to spot and take pictures of celestial marvels. Plus, Brian finds time to talk to three astronauts currently floating around the International Space Station.

Special guest Jonathan Ross finds out that anyone can be an astronomer, as heâ€™s taught Astronomy 101 by The One Showâ€™s resident stargazer, Mark Thompson. Over three days, gadget-obsessed Jonathan has to prove that he can navigate the night skies with just a pencil, paper and a humble pair of binoculars.

From their base at the world-famous Lovell Telescope at the University of Manchester (one of the worldâ€™s largest telescopes), Dara and Brian take viewers on a whistle-stop tour across the galaxy as they identify three of Januaryâ€™s unusual astronomical events â€“ a partial solar eclipse, the Quadrantids Meteor Shower and Jupiter aligning with Uranus.

As well as coaching Jonathan through the basics of astronomy, Mark is on hand to offer viewers at home tips on how to navigate their own way across the skies. And Liz Bonnin looks up at the clear skies of Hawaii to explain how the stars affect people even during the daytime.
