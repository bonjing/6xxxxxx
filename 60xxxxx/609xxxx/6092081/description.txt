Pupil Abel is the victim of Laura's nasty prank, yet gets accidentally blamed and overreacts. His ma withdraws him from school and gets him a job as lift-boy. But its' a special lift: when he pushes the forbidden green button, it takes him, Laura, Jozias Tump and his wife to Manhattan. There he's mistaken by a rich bitch how look like his ma for her long missing son Johhny. When a police helicopter comes tow the lift cabin, the Dutchmen get back in. It takes them to a Latin American country. The new revolutionary leader realizes presidents live about one year, so he gives the job to Mr. Tump.
