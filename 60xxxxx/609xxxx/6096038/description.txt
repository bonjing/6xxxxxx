The belief in evil spirits and their ability to influence people's lives is nearly universal throughout history.

For many societies, the answer to this perceived threat has been to perform the rites and rituals designed to drive the spirits from the person "possessed." In Exorcising The Devil, History journeys from the time of Christ to the present day to explore the role of exorcism in the Christian tradition. Discover the true story of a 14-year-old Maryland boy whose 1949 ordeal formed the basis for William Peter Blatty's book The Exorcist, and examine the causes behind the recent rise in exorcisms, many of which have been performed outside the rigid confines of the Catholic Church.

Featuring interviews with leading scholars, Exorcising The Devil is a fascinating journey through the long history of one of the most compelling religious rituals on earth.
