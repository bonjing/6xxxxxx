,kevinnftw,2011-01-13T14:53Z,"I've got a question.
I've downloaded this game and when I try to save it on my external hard drive it says that some files don't fit.
Have you got any idea how I can fix that?"
,PandaPat,2011-01-14T06:34Z,"@Kevinntfw
PS3 External hdd is in NTFS format which cant hold files more than 4gb ... to play this you must copy to internal hdd. Best way is to use ""Opensplit"" a program which splits files more than 4gb...copy the files after that to the external and using a backup manager copy to the internal hdd ... "
,ShockedGuy,2011-01-14T07:20Z,I would download this but it's too big and I don't know how to pirate ps3 games xD

,TOMMY2678,2011-01-21T00:06Z,@PandaPad The external harddisk format for the PS3 is FAT32 not NFTS. NFTS has no problems with files larger than 4.7 gb. The internal hard disk of the ps3 is formatted in NFTS.
,PandaPat,2011-01-21T03:48Z,Yea I realised...switched them around...but the INFO is still right...

,PandaPat,2011-02-06T16:57Z,Ummm the best way is to download Openmanager... I cant be botherd to turn on my ps3 and look up the version but find the latest version.....it allows you to trigger a patch which allows games 3.41+ to be played (patch is included btw)
