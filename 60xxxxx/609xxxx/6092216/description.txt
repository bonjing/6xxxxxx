Undead Nightmare features an open world with numerous zombie-related elements incorporated into the atmosphere and environment. Random encounters in the wild are replaced with random zombie encounters. Bounty missions are now replaced with missing person missions, in which the player must track down a missing survivor of the zombie plague and return them home safely to their families.[4] Gang Hideouts are replaced with graveyards across the map, in which the player can clear out hordes of zombies.[5]

Players can now hunt zombie animals such as cougars, bears and wolves, as well as mythical creatures such as Bigfoot, Chupacabra and a unicorn.[6] The Four Horses of The Apocalypse can also be tamed and used as mounts, each having their own unique ability or effect upon zombies and the environment surrounding the player.[7] The game also introduces new weapons for the player to use. Much like skinning animals and looting dead bodies in the original single player, players can now loot zombies for parts. In turn, these zombie parts can be used as ammunition for the blunderbuss, in order to conserve ammunition.[8]

Along with new single player features, Undead Nightmare introduces new multiplayer features, including "Undead Overrun," in which up to four players must work together to fend off increasingly difficult waves of zombies.[9] Undead Nightmare introduces "Land Grab," a new feature for regular free roam, in which players must hold a territory in one of seven major towns for a set amount of time, defending their territory from attackers. The player at the end who held it for the most time as well as having the most kills gets the majority of the awarded points.[10] In addition to new game types, Undead Nightmare includes eight zombie multiplayer skins for players to use.
