,Allifan,2011-06-16T10:33Z,iTunes refuses invalid app.
,FullReign,2011-07-22T01:30Z,The Newest verision according to the website for Jaadu RDP for Windows is 3.0.4 and supports iOS 4.0. Also the retail program doesnt require jail-breaking your Apple product. So what gives? iTunes product page: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id299002339?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4
,FullReign,2011-07-22T01:34Z,"Im about to get an iPhone 5 when it comes out, so This is going to be REALLY useful if I  can get this torrent to work (once I have an iPhone). 

What version of the Jaadu RDP is this?"
,FullReign,2011-07-22T01:40Z,"Okay, my bad, if you could please remove my 2 previous posts:
and this one: Im new to the member list here and didnt know I could NOT remove a post myself.

This is VNC, not RDP The link I posted was not for what this download is for.
________________
My Other question remains though: 
-Why does this require jailbreaking your Apple product for usage, while the retail product does NOT"
