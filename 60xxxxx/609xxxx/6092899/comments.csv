,dapinder,2011-01-10T06:28Z,"Thanx Computer-User for this wonderful torrent. Was waiting for this for a long time. Just one query:

I want to do a clean installation after partitioning my drive via Windows Setup only. Should I go for Windows XP Professional or this corporate edition? Plz give a brief about the difference between the two and which one is better.?
Thnx"
,DarthBubba,2011-01-10T09:33Z,"So, why is this .ISO file about three times the size of the real WinXP-SP3 Pro Corp. .ISO file?  1.8GB vs 600MB."
,babuin12,2011-01-10T15:54Z,thanks Computer-User  .What about drivers ? are there sate drivers included  ?
[T],Computer-User,2011-01-10T18:01Z,"""dapinder""

There Is No Diff In The Pro & The Corporate Edition, The Only Diff Is The Activation Process :)

Pro Needs Too Be Activated And Corporate Doesn't :) lol

,DarthBubba,2011-01-11T05:00Z,"@computer-user: What drivers?  This torrent -> http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6056672/WIN_XP_SP3_UP_TO_DATE__WITH__SATA_RAID_DRIVERS_no_SN_or_CRACK
is roughly the same setup as yours (i.e., updated through Dec 2010), but is close to one-third the size.  Do you just throw in the update files and leave the integration to us?  Integrating the fixes increases the .iso size only a little bit.  Are you adding extra driver packs, like the BTS driver packs?  Something is not right here."

After You Open Nero, Close The Second Window That Pops Up Just Don't Close NERO.

Go To The Top Of The Program And Click On Open, Find The .ISO File And Click Burn.

,PrimeDth,2011-01-20T18:17Z,"If you think he's stealing information, install Prio and check all active connections outbound and inbound. It's all legit. I have been using it on customers computers.  The reason that it's so big is he uses DriverPacks. They are just massive and include almost every driver needed, aside from USB 3.0. 

I trust this man and have downloaded every one of his torrents. The installation takes a bit longer, but my god it saves time finding drivers and installing IE8. 

Note: You can use your legit key if you have it. Install it normally and when you go to activate Windows it'll say you have an unauthorized copy. You can then enter your legit key.

Computer-User: I was wondering if you could make a Windows Media Center Edition 2005 version with all updates and whatnot. Do you think you can if I provide you with an original CD? I don't doubt you can find it on your own though."

,resgame,2011-01-23T10:41Z,"Thanks for your releases. I have 6 things to talk about.

1. Where is your x64 XP Pro?
2. When will you start doing January?
3. I wanted to installed your W7 x32 on an old PC, I meet the requirements besides the video card, so when I'd get to the desktop after install and restart for the first time I get a black screen with blinking blank space. So I learned I needed to disable the Aero and use the Classic because of my video card being 64MB, not as 128MB as W7 wants. So after I disabled Aero, all was good, then when I activated W7 it's doing it again. So did the Activation do anything to video settings or what? I use the 'Windows Loader 1.9.5 (Recommended)'.
4. So what is actually integrated in your releases, just hot fixes and security updates?
5. You use nLite to make your OS's, right? And I forgot the name of that one website of that guy who gives you the updated files/updates for nLite.
6. Would you mind talking on AIM, MSN or?"
,brawlysnake66,2011-01-24T02:36Z,hey love your uploads they r amazing but I'm wondering are the updates integrated or is it the 2010 December XP released? and does Microsoft release any new copies of windows XP?
,sean352,2011-01-24T11:50Z,i got a question for you about this xp. i been using torrents for years just never conversed about them. my mom which aint pc savy needs a clean install and lives too far from me. after i put this on a disc can i mail it to her and she do a install and dont have to worry about activation?thnx man

Yes I know I can just not download the file, and I could just use any of the other bit torrent interfaces you happily provide us with.

Besides that... Beautiful upload, I haven't played with any them yet but I do know that they boot up well.  I just had an issue with getting the install screen to come up after it booted from the disk.  was writen at x4.0 and was tested.  But I've had issues before trying to reinstall an OS.

I hate windows!  I wish programs required for my schooling actually ran on Linux.  I'm using WINE but 3/4 of the programs features don't work!  FML"

I downloaded it & burnt & did a clean install but something goes wrong.

At the point where the installation reboots my PC (the press any key to boot from dvd appears but I don't press anything) I wait and the Windows XP Logo appears, but then it freezes there and nothing happens. 

I was running Windows 7 (one of your torrents :D) and was trying to downgrade to XP... so... what the heck have I messed up here? *not so good with computers*

Side by side they don't look the same in the task manager. I'm a little paranoid about it. The msiexec service failed and had to be worked on to get it running right. Wish there was a way to get boot files burned to cd and use the other version of corp, which has been trusted and used since 2000. Auto updates failed but all of them worked directly from the MS update site. The other version of corp is totally blocked by MS. Thanks for this CD, but all we really need is the iso, nothing else."
