From Wiki

Yes Acoustic: Guaranteed No Hiss is the video release of an acoustic concert by the 
progressive rock group Yes recorded live on January 26, 2004, and broadcast live to 
movie theatres around the United States following the premiÃ¨re of the documentary Yesspeak. 
After the film was played in theatres, cameras cut live to a small studio in California 
with an audience of about 100 people, where Yes performed the first complete acoustic 
concert of their career.

Along with songs from the band's original catalogue, Yes also performed a number of 
cover songs such as "Blue Moon" and "The Lady is a Tramp."


Review by Gatot

It depends on which angle do you want to view this unplugged version of YES music. If you
do not enjoy the kind of unplugged music, this is definitely a bad choice because it would not
favor you at all. But if you like version of acoustic music, you still need to get familiar with Yes
music before seeing this DVD. Why? It's quite difficult to start liking Yes from their live
acoustic music because you have definitely missed its original sound.

For me personally, I actually do not like unplugged music. No wonder when my rockin's friend
who currently live in Swiss, Krisna Dhianta, brought this DVD set as a gift for me I did not spin
it right away because I know that I would not enjoy it. Couple of weeks after the DVD with me,
I finally got a chance to spin and .. guess what? It did not bite me at all .. it was so dull to my
ears, I mean it. So, I just put it at my shelf. This happened quite a long ago (since the DVD
was released) until last week. The trigger was simple: I was preparing a material to be
broadcasted at FM Radio Network [Trijaya] down here at my country in the Satrurday Night
Rock when I would feature YES as a legendary band to discuss. As I was so busy preparing
the playlist and reading many books [including YES Stories] finally I found this DVD again at
my shelf. So I did try to spin .. and do you know what happened? It gave me different kind of
experience and I started appreciating this DVD!

Put it this way . I have been hearing the music of YES since I was 14 years old with
"Roundabout" as the first track. I have known exactly all subtleties pertinent to this song right
from the elegant acoustic guitar opening until the heavy rhythm art and guitar / keyboard
solos during interlude. Oh yes, I have known it for so long. All details have resided in my
memory cells. But this time what I'm watching is "totally different" style of music for the same
song. It gives me unique experience. Judging from the performance of the band itself, I don't
think this is the best live performance they have played ever. But, for sure, this is their first
unplugged version ever!

"Southside of The Sky" is also another song that I have known it quite well the subtleties of
each segment event during Rick's piano solo. But, listening to the other style gives me great
experience. In fact the piano solo by Rick Wakeman in this track is very intricate and
interesting for my ears.

Overall, it's an excellent addition to any prog music collection. Keep on proggin' ..!
