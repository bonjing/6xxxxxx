,xanonymous,2011-04-26T23:05Z,"Official Mac requirements:

-Mac OS X or Mac OS 9 or higher
-PowerPC G3 processor or higher
-256 MB of memory (128 MB if using Mac OS 9)
-ATI Technologies Rage 128 graphics card with 16 MB VRAM or better
-1 GB of hard disk space

This means it pretty much runs on any Mac. Works well on my MBP 2011 with OS X 10.6.7 and doesn't require a disk to play. Best tactical shooter ever and awesome mods! Try GameRanger and iFire/BlackFire for online servers."
,fiddlersroost,2011-06-03T23:44Z,"cannot open it,got whole file,but will not open,how?"
,xanonymous,2011-07-04T10:01Z,"@fiddlersroost: You'll need an archive extraction utility like StuffIt Expander to open/extract the file. It expands to over 11 GB, btw."
,Robostt,2011-08-14T17:50Z,seed please
,bklyntim,2011-09-01T16:13Z,"I have downloaded the game and i am also seeding, but how come when i try to play the game it says ""You can't open the application Ghost Recon because PowerPC applications are no longer supported"".
