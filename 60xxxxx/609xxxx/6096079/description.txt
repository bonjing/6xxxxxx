Wikipedia - ELV1S: 30 #1 Hits is a compilation album by Elvis Presley released in November 2002. It was the first Elvis album to go straight to #1 in the Billboard charts with 500,325 copies sold in its first week, and his tenth album chart-topper since 1956. In compiling the album, four different charts were used--Billboard, Cashbox, New Musical Express and Record Retailer. The album has sold more than nine million copies worldwide, topping 26 charts around the world. As of December 2005, it has been certified as 5x Platinum by the RIAA. The album is RCA's response to the phenomenally successful release of EMI's 1, released in November 2000, which featured all 27 of The Beatles' number one songs together on one album. The album actually contains another number one hit, the hit "A Little Less Conversation" being added at the last minute, following its reaching of the top of the UK charts. It also includes classics such as "Hound Dog", "Suspicious Minds" and "Can't Help Falling in Love". The follow-up to this album was 2nd to None, which was a collection of Elvis' songs which didn't make it to number-one (with the exception of "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You"). In 2003, it became the first, and so far, only Elvis album to be issued in the newly-created DVD audio-only disc format. All 31 recordings were digitally remixed and remastered into 5.1 sound for the first time. The songs were presented in reverse order, with "A Little Less Conversation" as track 1, and "Heartbreak Hotel" as track 31. There are also alternate version comparisons of certain songs, such as "It's Now or Never", "Crying in the Chapel" and "Burning Love", included as bonus tracks. By reaching the top of the Billboard charts, the album made Elvis Presley the only solo artist in US recording history to reach the top of the album charts in four different decades, the others being the 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s. It also ensured another record for Elvis, that of the longest span ever achieved between #1 album chart-toppers, of 46 years between his first #1 album, Elvis Presley, and this 2002 release.
