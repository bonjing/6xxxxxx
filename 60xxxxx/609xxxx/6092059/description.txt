Just William - The Complete First Series (2010-2011)

All four episodes.


A brilliant BBC tv series, which broadcasted on BBC One between December 2010 and January 2011.

Just William follows the exploits of 11-year-old tearaway William Brown and his band of adventurous "outlaws". The series is an BBC adaptation of the 'Just William' collection of short stories, which were first published in 1922, after Richmal Crompton - a teacher, began writing in her spare time.

The William books are thought to have sold more than 12 million copies in the UK alone and generated numerous TV and radio adaptations.

This series, set in the 1950s, stars Daniel Roche (Ben in 'Outnumbered') as the title character, eponymous character William Brown. With Rebecca Front and Daniel Ryan as William's parents. Caroline Quentin and Warren Clarke appear as the parents of Violet Elizabeth Bott (played by Isabella Blake-Thomas), neighbours of the Brown family. It is directed by Paul Seed and produced by John Chapman. Martin Jarvis, who voices the radio and audio CD adaptions of Just William, acts as the narrator.

I have uploaded this because:

1)It was shown at a odd time of the day (12:30pm...I think more people could have watched it if it was on at 4:30pm)
2)The BBC don't repeat things a lot anymore 
3)It isn't available on BBC iPlayer anymore
4)It's excellent!
