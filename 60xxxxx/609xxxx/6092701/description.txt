Ryan Giggs True Red - The Life of a Legend is a DVD profile of Manchester United and Wales legend, Ryan Giggs.

Best, Law, Charlton, Robson, Cantona, Keane. Manchester United has had many great players - but arguably the greatest of them all is Ryan Giggs. No one has made more appearances for United. No one has won more trophies with United. And, he is the most decorated footballer in English history.

Ryan Giggs - True Red on DVD is a unique insight into the life of a legend. With intimate access both on and off the field it explores the man behind the magic. Ryan - so proud to have worn the Red of both Manchester United and Wales - reveals his life story in his own words and as seen through the eyes of his team-mates, his manager, his friends and family.

This historic DVD includes rare and exclusive footage of Ryan at home, previously unseen family videos, and behind-the-scenes at both Old Trafford and in Moscow ahead of the 2008 Champions League Final.

Charting his incredible impact as a sensational 17 year old through to the glorious finale to the 2007/08 season in Wigan and Moscow, this is the definitive DVD celebration of his glittering, record-breaking career.
