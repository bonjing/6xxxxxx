Has .idx files, Missing Corresponding .sub files. Filtered out .rar?"
,puppyup,2011-01-13T02:36Z,"Perhaps they don't understand that there is a rar within the rar, which contains the *.sub file. In most cases the rar within the rar has the same name as the rar from which it was extracted. And thus, many people skip it while extracting, because there is a conflict then.

Example:

1. You have a rar file called ""subs.rar""
2. Extract it to another folder and you get ""nameofthemovie.idx"" - ""subs.rar"" + ""subs.sfv"".
3. Extract 2nd ""subs.rar"" and you get also ""nameofthemovie.sub""

Now, if you don't extract to another folder, but only use ""Extract here"", then you get a conflict between the 1st rar-file and the 2nd rar-file (the rar within the rar).

It's a very stupid way of the scene rippers to pack the subs like this. Because it creates confusion for those who unpack it."
,dread.pirate.roberts,2011-01-13T03:22Z,"I understand how sub files are packed, my point is that there is neither sub files or a rar are within the listed files for this release.

I further supose that it is likely the rar files was filtered out.

,prasnto,2011-01-15T01:42Z,"The FRAGMENT release of the film (likely sourced from the UK DVD) is heavily cut. Missing not only the 'controversial' scene of the cow being killed, but almost every other scene in the film is also cut (in whole, it is nearly 10 minutes cut!)

Those who don't like watching censored copies of movies should go get the TRL release (https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5267256/Baaria.2009.iTALiAN.DVDRip.XviD-TRL-%5BWiNetwork-bt%5D ) which is uncut. "
