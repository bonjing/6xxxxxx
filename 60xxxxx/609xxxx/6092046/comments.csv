,AhmedSheshtawy,2011-01-12T21:45Z,"1st the game is retail so it don't need a crack indeed

2nd guys i'm the only seeder for more than 200 person .. please seed and don't be selfish

3rd you may face problems (specially with Macbooks) after installing the game .. as you may see a black screen while the sound of the game is already playing .. so if you got this all you should do is the following:-

1- you should copy the game to your applications Folder

2-click and hold CMD button and double click the game .. an options screen will appear

3- choose (In a Window) instead of (Full Screen) then click OK

4- Now the game will launch normally but in window view

5- after the intro ends and the main menu appears click CMD and Enter .. now it's in full screen

6- everytime you will launch the game it will launch in windows view and you should click CMD + Enter after the intro video"

Tnx AhmedSheshtawy"
,orenheb,2011-01-14T13:25Z,"I'm afraid I spoke too soon
Even thou it is a Mac version and loads ok, the problem comes when u load a saved game, it just freezes. Time and time again. Sometimes immediately, sometimes after some turns, pity. I'll just have to wait for one that works without problems."
,lp15120,2011-01-14T18:40Z,"If this is a retail mac version, then why do in-game menus say ""Exit to Windows""? I'd expect Firaxis to have picked up on that in the months between the PC and Mac releases..."
,Lannation,2011-01-15T01:03Z,Can someone help i succesfully downloaded this. I played it for like 4 hrs then i crashed and now when i open it. it goes to a blue screen then crashes again
,AhmedSheshtawy,2011-01-15T02:12Z,"Some bugs may appears under Mac 10.6.5 and later version 10.6.6
Crashes are not because of a game bug but the game was designed to work under Mac OS 10.6.4
anyway the game works fine on my Macbook Pro under 10.6.6
and here is a reply from Aspyr about the blue or black screen that happened sometimes under Mac OS 10.6.5 and 10.6.6
-------
From Aspyr:
Hello,
Thank you for contacting Aspyr Technical Support!
This issue is caused by the latest 10.6.5 update which we are currently working with Apple to resolve. Please hold down the command (apple) key when launching the game in order to bring up the initial configuration screen to select Windowed mode. Once in the gameâ€™s main menu, select Options then Video Options to return the game to Full Screen.
Feel free to contact us with any further issues or concerns.
Thank you,
Aspyr Technical Support"
,orenheb,2011-01-15T05:04Z,"Yes Ahmed
It is inconceivable whats happening with this game. From the very beginning its been a disaster for Windows and Mac, the true meaning of GREED !!
Exploiting the game's fame for a quick profit."
,AhmedSheshtawy,2011-01-15T19:28Z,@orenheb: I totally agree with you

I have the game and it loads fine but the main menu screen is just black with 2 yellow rectangles where the ""pillars"" frame the main menu options.  Any help is appreciated!"
,Snads,2011-01-19T03:53Z,"If I do not have a 256mb VRAM card in my iMac, am I not able to play the game at all?  Is there a way to change the file settings so I can squeak by without a 256 graphics card?  

The intro movie loads fine, runs smooth, looks great but the main menu is black with 2 yellow rectangles in place of the ""pillars"" that frame the main menu.

I have already tried fixing the ""windowed"" and ""full screen"" settings to no avail yet and I don't have $1,800 sitting around with which to buy a new iMac at the moment, lol.

Any help is appreciated!"

,Snads,2011-01-19T17:02Z,"Is there any way to get past the requirements?  I recall being able to do that with Civ IV.  Like I said, the game boots and the intro movies play but the main screen is black or grey with the yellow rectangles."
,Snads,2011-01-19T17:15Z,The game booted up alright from another download (the ported version) and had only one problem--it looked like the terrain had a thin web of black lines on it.

I think the game only supports the past requirements and noway to pass them ... but I think aspyr is gonna release a fix version for that release because it has many bugs also it didn't release that version on the Mac App Store yet only IV...
