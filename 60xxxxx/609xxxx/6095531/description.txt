The show begins with rapturous applause from the audience, strobe-lit flashes of each original band member--Nick Rhodes, Simon LeBon, and the (unrelated) Taylors John, Andy, and Roger--and they're off. The reunited Duran Duran, filmed during a two-night stand at Wembley Arena in 2004, plunges into "(Reach Up for the) Sunrise," before launching into old favorites like "Hungry Like the Wolf" and "Something I Should Know." LeBon keeps the stage patter to a minimum; it's all about the music. On occasion, the Armani-clad quintet are joined by statuesque singer Sara Brown ("Come Undone," "Notorious," "The Reflex," etc.) and sax man Andy Hamilton ("Union of the Snake," "Rio"). As expected from a band that came to fame during the height of the video era, film and anime images are projected during certain numbers, such as "The Chauffeur," "Careless Memories" and "A View to a Kill" (grainy Rhodes-shot images of Liz Hurley rather than scenes from the James Bond outing of the same name). The one selection that doesn't quite fit the 20-song set is 1988's "I Don't Want Your Love." With Brown's help, they give it their all, but funk-metal isn't really Duran Duran's strong suit (although the song later appears as a 3D bonus feature). The deluxe edition includes a 10-track CD recorded during the same London engagement and a pair of 3D glasses. --Kathleen C. Fennessy
