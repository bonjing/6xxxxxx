,d1knight,2011-01-11T04:54Z,"for some reason the sistem wont take the links... must change the ""*"" for ""."" in the url's to open :S"
[T],ct420,2011-01-15T23:13Z,"some URLs are intentionally blocked by the admins.  Using tactics such as substituting * for . will get you banned if a mod sees it.

You need to find a picture hosting site that is allowed by tpb and use that to post your previews.  Easiest way IMO is to just look at what sites others are using, then pick among them..."
,d1knight,2011-01-22T14:49Z,"Thanks for the info... i didn't know about the allowed/blocked url... i see the others sites others members use to host images. But many sites uses redirecting script to other sites or popups, half of them, containing some malware.

Because of that, on my domain Duke01,net...  (yes, ĂÂ­'m the owner) ...created a similar page, without ads... the url just need tu be included on the database. I'l try to contact a mod about this...

**the domain is not new. i have since 2006 but i only used it to host some files... Just want to nake it usefull to tpb members... so, if allowed... EVERYONE is welcome to use it :D"
