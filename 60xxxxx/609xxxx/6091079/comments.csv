Regardless, thanks for the upload."
,lydonit13,2011-01-11T23:14Z,"I'll answer my own question:
It seems TPB filters the phrase ""come[dot]to"".  This, like go[dot]to, is used as a redirect domain which is often linked to spam and other malicious content.  So after the phrase is filtered out of the movie title, we're left seeing only ""Wel The Rileys"".

aoloffline did a good job getting past the filter here by putting a hyphen in the movie title.

Thanks again for the upload."
