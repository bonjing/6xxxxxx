[V],globeplus,2011-01-10T15:49Z,"This comment is to say that the interest in emulation tools maybe not the best for the generality ofthe users even if we are in a period without too many new nice pc games , when i concebed this tool i was borred with a few nice emulation systems here and there on the computer and then each time i had to pick up a new one to play i needed to remember everything again about the specific game system that i was playing then i said to me : God damn it , i need something or some tool that keep this emulated systems organised and help me with easy on the use or in the integration of new games and i finally decided to start the work on this tool , it was close 2 months of pure work and updating after that but more than worthy , i think the lack of the interest come from a certain futility on the appreciation for emulated systems but everyone if want to use them is nice to have them organised and easy to use .

Wow, that intro you posted on DM was awesome! Obviously some very good After Effects skills here :) Anyway, Globe, he's spot on acknowledging your otherwise excellent app's horrible design. I'm sure the users of Glomulator would appreciate a 'simpler' design, with no 90's style GIF animation, whip it up in VB Express or something and it'll look acceptable.

Oh, and by the way, there is no such English word as 'addicionated'. Try 'added' instead, I think that's what you'll need :)"
