Six people, each of them is on the road to self-destruction. They wake up in cells in a surreal facility, without knowing how they got there or why. Are they in denial? Are they crazy? What happened? As they try to figure things out, a mysterious man forces the six abductees to participate in a disturbing experiment called the Trials. During the experiment, the unwilling participants will come to face disturbing truths about themselves and decide each others and fate in a game of dice. As the storyline unfolds, we discover that something greater connects them all.
