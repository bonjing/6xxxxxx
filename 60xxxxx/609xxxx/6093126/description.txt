When sexploitation director Ron Ormond found the Lord, he offered his talents to the Rev. Estus Pirkle.  In this small miracle of a film, the Dynamic Duo imagine an America when Jesus is outlawed and Karl Marx is God, where children who refuse to step on a portrait of Christ are beheaded with Bowie knives and wild-eyed commies savage chaste young wives before their husbands' eyes.  This movie is a total hoot!
