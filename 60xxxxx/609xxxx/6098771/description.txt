Encoders Notes:
I dropped serenitys encode (Thanks) into vdubmod,
I sharpened it, then i increased the saturation & brightness.
After that i changed the colours with a rgb eq.
I also used a smoother on a very light setting to clean up the video.
Finaly i de-muxed the line from rx's copy & muxed it to my encode.
So thanks to them for syncing it and thanks to imagine for putting it out there.
Well its a bit late, but it is a very good ts, not as good as the little fockers ts but better than recent cams.
Hopefully serenity release a 720p copy because that would look a hell of alot better.
I know there are a few copies out there, but i thougth id add mine to the mix.
Enjoy another Kingdom Release.
