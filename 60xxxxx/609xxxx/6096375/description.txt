An intimate, guitar-driven journey, Many Roads is an emotional tour-de-force. Partly recorded in a tiny cottage in the back woods in the middle of a Canadian winter, and then with a bunch of great musicians in Toronto.

"The ever-tasteful musician has a gift for grand musical moments that retain their intimacy."
