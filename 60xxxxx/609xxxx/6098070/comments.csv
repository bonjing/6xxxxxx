,mikecj,2011-03-11T02:50Z,"Anyone not understanding the Terminal directions...
Locate your app - should be in Apllications/Angry Birds/ -this means you need an Angry Birds folder, with the app inside.
Right/CMD click the app->Show package contents->select macos and double click Angry Birds to start terminal.
now copy paste chmod a+x ""Angry Birds"" hit enter/return key...
let it do it's thing, and your app should now work.
Good luck"
