Wikipedia - The Singles 86>98 is a singles compilation album released in 1998 by Depeche Mode. It was released as a follow-up to the bands previous compilation, The Singles 81?85, which was also re-released in the same year. The compilation covers the band's 7-inch single releases spanning five studio albums (from 1986's Black Celebration to 1997's Ultra), as well as including the band's 1998 stand-alone single "Only When I Lose Myself". Also included is "Little 15" (from Music for the Masses, released in Europe, and the live version of "Everything Counts" (from the live album 101) which was released as a single in 1989. All tracks on The Singles 86>98 were newly remastered, as was the case with the re-release of The Singles 81?85. The four-month Singles Tour that followed marked the first time Depeche Mode had toured since the 1993-94 Devotional/Exotic Tour (they had declined to tour to support Ultra a year earlier, instead they only played a few shows with a small number of songs). As of April 2006, The Singles 86>98 has sold 562,000 units in the U.S. (double albums count as two units), achieving platinum status. This album was also listed in Blender magazine's 500 CDs You Must Own

Amazon.com Review By Beth Bessmer - So Depeche Mode releases a singles compilation featuring only one previously unreleased song ("Only When I Lose Myself") in anticipation of a major tour. Sound suspiciously like a shameless cash-in? Sure. But The Singles, 86-98 needed to be made. This is a worthwhile purchase for casual admirers and completists alike. The two-disc set contains revamped versions of the major singles from 1986 to 1998 and a version of "Little 15" that was first released only in France. The set's "grand finale" is the live recording of "Everything Counts," from the 101 album. Although the original studio version of the "Everything Counts" single appeared on 1984's People Are People, DM fudged the chronology to justify including this astounding live recording on the album (a ploy to psych up concert-ticket buyers?). The live recording highlights the worshipful crowd applauding, cheering, and chant-singing "The grabbing hands / Grab all they can / Everything counts in large amounts" long after the song has ended. Ka-ching!
