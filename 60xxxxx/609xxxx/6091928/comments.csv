Happy New Year to you mate!

thx for ur providing of EE last year, which without u i neva could have seen :)

well i figured now there is a way for me to watch EE on german PayTV, the channel is called BBC Entertainment. In order to reveive that channel i would have to pay the following, basic charge cabletv = 18euros, basic charge digitaltv = 5euros and programm package entertainment channels = 15euros, makes a total of 38euros, for the telly only. And now comes the funny thing, Epiosdes of EE on german BBC Entertainment are about 5 y.o. LOOOOOOOOL
so its not worth it at all to pay 38euros just to watch EE in germany, plus u neva know how long the show a channel here, some channels come and go if ya know wot im talkin bout.

i figured annuva thing with demonid mate, as i told u its comptly blocked due to the german government. now as they thave changed their adress from .com to .me or summin like that i was able to see a maintaince page of demonid, i was so exited and couldnt wait if this page will work here the next day, guess wot i have seen the next day, jsut as usual, a white screen and my browser telling me site is fully loaded, so blocked again.

well i mean why is the government so mean to me, i work my ass off evry day, i pay all the taxes and they dont gimmie access to demonid in return???? LOL"
