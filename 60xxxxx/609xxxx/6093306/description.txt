REVIEW FROM IMDB:

Wow... This movie was off the hook, although it wasn't very exciting the entire time because (I feel) it is meant to be more of a dramatic type horror film, which is something TOETAG has never done before. Everything builds up to the action, and it makes it so much better to see it all happen... You get to see Bradley progress through his sickness within about 24 hours of him and his family being together again. I personally believe this is TOETAG's greatest film ever, and they really took a new approach to making movies with this one, and tried something they hadn't done before... This movie has made me look at TOETAG a different way than I already did... I thought I loved them before, but I must say, I now truly do.

The story is amazing, and although it wasn't necessarily 'original', it was in ways and kept me very interested the whole time through. The characters were all great, and Damien Maruscak did excellent as Bradley.
