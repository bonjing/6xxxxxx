,Chaos117,2011-01-25T09:11Z,"Works perfect, too bad in order to run it on windows 7 I have to unzip it into the directory after clicking Diablo2.exe every time I want to play. Otherwise it does nothing except show random symbols letters and numbers in the top corner of my desktop. Clicking every single compatibility option also does not work, you just need to disable anti-aliasing on your video card."
,EonFromTeton,2011-02-16T09:09Z,"Works Great! Thanks! Hey you should also make a direct play of Diablo 1 with Hellfire, or point me in the direction of some sort of how-to on making your own direct play. Direct plays are a lot more convenient than messing around with Daemon Tools."

,Lonepup,2011-04-09T09:45Z,"Works great on my Windows 7 X64.

Just follow the directions. Also to get the video to work, I ran the video setup program inside the folder.

Remember, this game was released in around 2000. That was a long time ago (I was the beta tester - thought I'd get a discount on my purchase - but I was wrong)

So, however you tweak your video settings, they wont be that great. Great game play, however. 

Diablo III will be released sometime next year - look for better video quality then.

Thank you!"

,NoScrub,2011-05-02T14:32Z,"For Windows 7 users - Read here:
-Download the torrent
-Open with your Torrent program
-Once the game is downloaded use WinRar or any other Rar opening program and extract them anywhere. 
-Once extracted right click the 'Diablo2.exe' (It has a little icon of a skull-type thing) and go to Properties.
-Click on the Compatibility tab and tick every box except Run in 256 colors.
-Please note: You need to run it as Windows XP Service pack 2
-Open Diablo2.exe and it should load fine.
-Close the program and then look for the application D2Vidtst.
-Let it run 
-Once its complete Diablo2 should look fine and work perfectly on your computer.

No matter what options you choose there will be discoloration.  But once you're in game, ""save and exit"", then the misconfiguration goes away.

I downloaded the torrent (which took about 5 hours) and I was greeted by an empty folder and no option to extract it or anything else. I doubt I did something wrong because all I did was click ""Get This Torrent"". So what do I do?"
,LeDrakkar,2012-03-22T19:37Z,"Maybe your torrent software has an auto-unzip feature and the content is placed automatically in an other folder. Try searching in windows with file names or something like that, or check the preferences.

If it's not it, then download it again, maybe something crashed..."

Open task manager

After you're done playing create a new instance of Explorer.exe as follows:
In the Task Manager window, go to New Task
Type ‘‘Explorer.exe’’ without quotation marks."

Just follow the instructions he gave you and you'll be fine, don't forget to use D2VIDTEST for the video settings, or it won't work. "
