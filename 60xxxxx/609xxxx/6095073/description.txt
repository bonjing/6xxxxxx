Side Jobs: Stories from the Dresden Files
UNABRIDGED
by Jim Butcher
Narrated by James Marsters

The first short-story collection in the number-one New York Times- best-selling series - including brand-new Harry Dresden short stories!
Here, together for the first time, are the shorter works of best-selling author Jim Butcher - a compendium of cases that Harry and his cadre of allies managed to close in record time. The tales range from the deadly serious to the absurdly hilarious. Also included is a new, never-before-published novella that takes place after the cliff-hanger ending of Changes. This is a must-have collection for every devoted Harry Dresden fan, as well as a perfect introduction for readers ready to meet Chicago\'s only professional wizard.
