PLOT:


The violinist Sydney Wells has been accidentally blinded by her sister Helen since she was five years old. She submits to a surgery of cornea transplantation, and while recovering from the operation, she realizes that she is seeing dead people. With the support of Dr. Paul Faulkner, Sidney finds who the donor of her eyes was and they travel to Los Llanos in Mexico to resolve the mystery of her visions.

Sydney Wells is blind and has been so since a childhood tragedy. After undergoing surgery to restore her sight she learns to see again. But soon after, unexplainable shadowy and frightening images start to haunt her. Not knowing if they are an aftermath of surgery, her mind adjusting to sight, her imagination, or something horrifyingly real, Sydney is soon convinced that her anonymous eye donor has somehow opened the door to a terrifying world only she can now see.
