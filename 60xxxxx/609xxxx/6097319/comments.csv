,oXusDaGod,2011-01-16T06:25Z,"Downloading was fast, but there's one thing that is not working . When I'm on step 5 I see only ""Register Online"" then I'm doing like the instructions tell me (restart the software) and I don't even see ""Register From another computer"" ..I did cancel and restart vegas for about 10 times .

Can you help me ?"
,roadsplat,2011-01-16T18:21Z,"Worked like a charm, thank you!"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-17T00:34Z,"@oXusDaGod 
Try to restart your computer :) It may work then. "
,oXusDaGod,2011-01-17T01:58Z,"@Cyberpiraten

Thanks , it worked . "
,lws48,2011-01-17T23:28Z,"Are you sure nobody from Sony will check to see if our fake info matches up, also, are we supposed to enter our real addresses even with our fake names and emails?"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-01-19T00:43Z,"Check the fake info? That's why it's fake dude... 
Enter real address....HELL NO!  You could write country and that but NOT your home adress! 

The crack takes care of the rest.  
Enjoy it."
,elsos,2011-01-23T08:37Z,"Works perfect, thank you very much!!!!
Very good instructions for install"
,mauritus,2011-01-24T20:20Z,serial number is not valid. this is the message it gives me when trying to perform the 1st step :(
,OmegaJesus,2011-01-30T05:13Z,"I'm getting the same ""serial is invalid"" error."
,OmegaJesus,2011-01-30T20:40Z,"Oh, I got it.
@mauritus

Be sure you're copy and pasting the files from the crack folder over and not dragging them. That's what I did the first time and it didn't replace anything."
,Dillsky,2011-02-04T08:58Z,"Wonderful! Thanks. Vegas 9 was so hard to torrent, it took me about 4 months of trying and giving up to finally get it. This took me an hour, all thanks to yooouu :)

lol. Sony Vegas 10.0c, as licensed to Cory Shithead. Thanks again :P"
[V],Cyberpiraten,2011-02-06T05:26Z,"If your using uTorrent it will start seeding when done automatic :)

,dvdrpirateking,2011-02-07T03:43Z,"dude i have this sony vegas 10 installed and it wont work anymore, so do i have to uninstall it or just install this program?"
,illman98,2011-02-13T06:51Z,on the info page step 7 it keeps saying i need a first name. it put my computers registered name there when i first went the page i made a fake last name and email and it keeps saying the info in the first name box is wrong or no text was added. help please?
,illman98,2011-02-13T06:52Z,on the info page step 7 it keeps saying i need a first name. it wont let me do anything no name or fake
,thefinest,2011-02-19T03:32Z,Works like a charm. Make sure you open the vegas100 in the program directory not one thats on your desktop or in program files. 
,nikgrech,2011-02-26T18:06Z,"great torrent, works perfectly

,CKeeper,2011-03-24T12:24Z,"With 3MB Down, this is the best and most wealthy vegas torrent on TpB!"
,icerbelle,2011-03-27T16:02Z,i registered with sony vegas online before i saw your torrent and i can't register from another computer because there is no option like that. can it be fixed? 
[V],peck1234,2011-03-29T08:49Z,"Beatifull, was getting sick of that crappy digital insanity crack that wasn't doing jack..

Your's worked like a champ!

Great up"
,archangelavi,2011-04-13T23:33Z,"This torrent was clean(no viruses or malaware). 
It was a very fast and efficient download.
The instructions were concise to the point and very very easy and simple to follow.
Everything installs easily and without flaw.
Thank you so much Cyberpiraten(uploader) May God Bless You. UR AWESOME !!!!!"
,Ramzes_,2011-04-19T14:13Z,"Thank you so much, clean and easy install."
,Scotty33,2011-04-30T07:36Z,"i have tried downloading multiple times, keep having same issue. Im on W7 and i follow all steps correctly, i had my buddy do it for me and he used this same torrent on his computer. After doing everything when i go to run Sony Vegas 10 while in the process of opening an error message pops up ""An Error Has Occured Starting Vegas Pro.
Error 0x80070002 (message missing)"" if i click the details button it says 
""Failed toinitialize host"" i am new to torrents and would like to get this program, please help."
,data_error23,2011-05-01T07:28Z,"Downloaded, followed instructions, and it works. I didn't see 'Register from another computer' first time, but followed instructions, cancelled and restarted no prob. It did make me put in (fake) address, but np. Haven't used it yet, but hopefully it all works, so far no reason to think it won't. 

So nice that it's so clean (no viruses detected) though I never had probs with any of the 32bit Digital Insanity ones either (ver 7-10). I had read that a lot (most) of the 64bit versions weren't working so glad to have found this one, it has probably saved me some hassle already.

Thanks!"
,iBlock,2011-05-01T17:03Z,"Hey, thanks for the download. It was really quick, and the install went well. Unfortunately, as soon as I launched Vegas and tried to import a file, it said ""none of the files could be opened"". The files were just normal videos that worked fine on another computer with Vegas. Does anyone know what the problem may be?"
,iloveblts,2011-05-25T21:27Z,"Downloaded quick and got it to install just fine, but now the program won't open or run for anything. I click on the icon and nothing happens. I've tried going through the folder to get it to run and nothing happens. "
,iloveblts,2011-05-25T21:29Z,"Oh, actually, got it to open through the crack folder but now it says ""Error 0x80070002"" when I try to open."
,MegaMouf,2011-06-06T00:10Z,"Installed smooth, but I am getting the same error message as 'iloveblts'. It opens through the crack folder and then crashes with an ""Error 0x80070002"" message. Any help would be great. Thanks."
,SlashGashTerrorCrew,2011-06-16T15:43Z,Why So Many Thumbs Down From Idiots Who Cant Follow Instructions? This Works Perfectly If You Half Half A Brain. +1
,SlashGashTerrorCrew,2011-06-16T15:45Z,"you might need microsoft.net framework and microsoft visual c++ 2008 redist (x64)
