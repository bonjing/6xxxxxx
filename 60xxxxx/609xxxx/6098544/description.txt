             The saga begins with a heated battle involving the brave but  
             often bumbling Mighty Pirate Guybrush, his beloved wife      
             Elaine, and their nemesis, the demon pirate LeChuck.         
             When the showdown goes up in flames, Guybrush finds himself  
             marooned on a strange island with winds that always blow     
             inward.  How will our hero manage to escape this             
             meteorological anomaly? What has become of LeChuck and       
             Elaine?  And what's the story with the infectious voodoo     
             pox that's spreading across the Caribbean, causing Guybrush  
             and other pirates to act like unruly hooligans? These are    
             just some of the many questions posed in this first chapter  
             of a rollicking and rip-roaring entertainment experience.
