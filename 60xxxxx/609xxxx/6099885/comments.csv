,mc_homes,2011-01-18T06:15Z,"@zack, i just updated everything and it still works fine. and it's the newest version too. hmmm."
,zackary87kr,2011-01-20T14:55Z,"@mc_homes: I stand corrected. I only tried the database update since I worried that the full program update would block me. However, after I tried installing both, it installed and there didn't seem to be any problems this time. Thanks all! 

I really like this program and am actually considering buying it. However, the yearly subscription updates are a real turn-off. "
,mc_homes,2011-01-22T02:18Z,damn i spoke too soon.  doesn't work anymore :(
[V],kentucky-kid,2011-01-23T02:38Z,it's still working here for me. thats weird. 
,mc_homes,2011-01-23T04:57Z,"yesterday when i went to update it it said ""integrity check failed"" and no updates showed up, even tho it hadn't been updated in a few days...but the scan still worked.  today when i went to update it updated and didn't mention the integrity check thing.  weird."

it's time u get yourself a new rig ;)"
,mc_homes,2011-01-31T10:07Z,i uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is still working fine.  i have no idea why the integrity check would fail that one time.
,onelittledinky,2011-01-31T18:12Z,installed and tells me cant find c:/windows/system32/Rmvtrjan when running .bat not sure if its due to my win7 sp1 update? or a previous install which i completely removed.
[V],kentucky-kid,2011-02-09T08:18Z,"@mc_homes

idk why. but what i do is just leave out the program update, i only leave the full database update checked.

@onelittledinky

does your windows account has admin rights? i believe that's because u don't have admin rights on your windows."
