,yazz00,2011-01-12T20:43Z,"Can't believe they made this into a movie. I loved the book, how will it work on film? Thanks for the quick up!"
,Phatfish,2011-01-12T21:27Z,"A/V - Good.

M - After all the hype I was left feeling a bit disappointed. Some points brought up was great others kinda confusing and pointless really. 
Possibly due to the fact that they made such a big deal of being politically neutral.

,sog2011,2011-01-16T21:20Z,"I didn't like this release because there aren't any subtitles (SRT files) anywhere. 

People in non-English countries won't understand the movie without the subtitles. 

If you want to release something that's really good, rip the substiles too! 
I think this is nothing but a mediocre release. 

Thanks!"
,sog2011,2011-01-16T21:24Z,Sorry but where are the subtitles? You should RIP the subtitles if you want to call your release a good release.
,vitordt,2011-01-16T23:56Z,"@sog2011: stop complaining. If you want your subtitles go to blockbuster and rent the movie.

@TvTeam: cheers buddy."
,romanof,2011-01-17T15:46Z,@sog2011: Whats up with the double post? It's enough with one post really...
,jm413d,2011-01-20T07:26Z,American Film FTW Don't leave home without it.
,jm413d,2011-01-20T07:28Z,PS - There are websites that supply subs... find one or don't download... simple as that
,JJ911,2011-01-21T03:44Z,"Dumb..

Waste of Time..  

But, Kudus to TvTeam for the torrent"
,mac_user777,2011-01-21T10:45Z,"Hey Guys THIS WAS SHIT really i mean the guy had an aweful lisp it was irritating and a lot of the information was repeated to the point of drivel,the movie could have been a lot shorter it was very convoluted and masqueraded as a Mike Moore Zeitgiest wannabe   "
[V],rambam1776,2011-06-19T09:34Z,"Quite a good film. The above negative comments strike me as foolish ones coming from people who seem ignorant. It's an intellectual documentary - not an action film. If you are a stupid person, don't watch this."
,fred99u,2011-06-20T01:42Z,"i loved the audio book of  freakonomics and super freakonomics, but this movie just didn't do it for me

download it and decide for yourself"
