,icrosapl,2011-11-21T05:02Z,"How exactly did you get this torrent? I was going to download without hesitation but then I saw this site:

http://support.brainev.com/frequently-asked-questions/brain-evolution-system-torrent---free-download 

I'm just afraid that this will have negative consequences. Did you download these files from the website or did you rip them from a cd?"
,icrosapl,2011-11-22T00:21Z,"That's what I was thinking but I quote from the website:
""The MP3 versions uploaded to such torrent sites have been compressed in a way that totally negates the benefits of the Brain Evolution System.""
""Basically, every torrent currently out there appears to be based on a very poorly ripped MP3 copy of the Brain Evolution System -- and SIMPLY DOES NOT produce any of the desired effects. And we've tested.""
""Indeed, the way in which some of these files have been compressed can actually cause NEGATIVE SIDE-EFFECTS. (Note: You *can* compress brainwave entrainment recordings into MP3 files, but it takes special effort. It seems the pirates behind this torrent used any basic CD MP3 ripper, such as iTunes. That can cause REAL problems.""

Now don't get me wrong. It's not like I'm saying the torrent is bad. I just want to know if it's safe.
