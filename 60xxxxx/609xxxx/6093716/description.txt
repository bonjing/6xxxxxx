Sew Your Heart With Wiresâ€™ is a beautiful duo album from Rod Picott and Amanda Shires; on paper it looks like a simple stripped down disc of Rod's acoustic guitar and Shires' excellent fiddle playing, but the approach they take and the atmosphere they create makes this feel like a timeless classic album of American ballads.
Itâ€™s an album that is full of characters and stories; from the gentle love song â€˜Mercuryâ€™ through the fantastic murder ballad â€˜Little Darlinâ€™ this is a disc that holds the listenersâ€™ attention with real song craft.
This is a quiet album from start to finish, but itâ€™s the simplicity that gives the disc the power it has, Rodâ€™s vocals are controlled and restrained and the contrast of his world-weary delivery and Shiresâ€™ classic American vocal styles are perfect for these songs.
In the true tradition of American ballads the songs are full of imagery of the US landscape and the stories highlight the lives of real life people, highlights include the contemporary story of â€˜Rubyâ€™, the roots-tinged â€˜Drive the Devil Outâ€™, and the ultimately bloody tale of â€˜Little Darlinâ€™.
As an album full of character and atmosphere, â€˜Sew Your Heart With Wiresâ€™ is one of the best of itâ€™s kind and full of songs of real quality â€“ a contemporary album with a classic feel.
