,rnwlcs,2011-01-12T12:11Z,HELP!! great picture but no sound??
,theleg,2011-01-13T21:19Z,"Thanks from Sweden.
Slicknick! your work is really appreciated."
,charlestoast,2011-01-15T23:23Z,"I was initially worried about the picture quality of the 480p, having gotten so used to the great 720p uploads you did last year - but in fact your 480p derived from the HD original is way better than the 480p from the SD broadcasts of two years ago! (and of course it's wide screen format too) So, although I still look forward to the non-live events and your 720p uploads, I have to say you've done an outstanding job of encoding to 480p! I trust you have a faster pc these days! I will donate again at the end of the season too, as a token of my appreciation, and hope plenty of others do too. I know the work that goes into the editing, encoding and uploading, having put up most of the 2008 races."
,charlestoast,2011-01-15T23:27Z,"@rnwlcs - I have no problem with the sound - but it's AAC, so I wonder if you have all the right codecs and filters? You might try removing your existing media players, and do a fresh install of VLC player. I find that it uses the least cpu power of all the players I've tried, and if you have a reasonable pc, it can let you tweak the picture to get the most out of it."
,CockRobinson,2011-01-16T06:22Z,"SlickNick,

You are the business. Thank you again for stating another year of awesome uploads for us. Round 1 was a complete and utter spectacle and down here in Australia we would get NO such coverage. I donated for your services last year after the Outdoors and I will do the same this year. 
TAKE NOTE FELLOW MX FANS: Where would we be without Nick? I encourage you to ""donate"" at the end of the SX or MX season - I did US$30 last year because SlickNick ROCKS. and High Def??? C'mon! I encourage you to do it this year as I will. What's US$20? A week worth of coffees? Nick, keep up the AWESOME work and you will be compensated for your brilliant effort..."
,ras242,2011-01-16T14:42Z,Thanks a million! Great having you back for this great season of supercross!!
