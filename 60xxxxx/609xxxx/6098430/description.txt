.: Plot :.

In the future civilisation has collapsed and the world has been hurled into a new dark age where sex is the only currency and slavery is a way of life.
The now fully-grown (and gorgeous) female students of a small isolated girls school have managed to survive amongst the chaos. To the predatory bands of white slave traders roving the countryside the nubile girls are perfect prey as they plan their escape to the only secure place in America, Dakota Mountain.
