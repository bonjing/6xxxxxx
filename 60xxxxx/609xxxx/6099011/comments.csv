This is scenebalance, that skull is there for good reason and beyond that, it may as well be a pink one, because scenebalance are trusted completely.

Ignore the frackwit calling fake, doesn't know what they're on about!!!

Scenebalance doesn't upload fakes and that frackwit is likely associate to the twats who tried to upload a fake yesterday."
