Crack Versus NTR - Quick Comparison:
************************************
** The included NIS 2011_Cracks are only for and tested on:
1. Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37
2. 180 days / 88 years (the exact number depends on your system and situation). 
3. No need to create a fake Norton Account to get rid of the nag.
4. Should work for all Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.x releases.
5. No need to uninstall the crack, as there's nothing to uninstall. 
6. The Norton Subscription Status shows full licensed status. 
 
** The included NTRs are only for and tested on:
1. - Norton AntiVirus 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37 
   - Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37
2. 120 / 165 days (the exact number depends on your system and situation). 
3. Requires creating a fake Norton account to get rid of the nag (depends on NTR). 
4. May not work with future patches/updates by Symantec.
5. Requires uninstalling before uninstalling Norton.
6. The Norton Subscription Status shows Trial status.

Conclusion:
*********** 
Besides the number of days and Norton versions, both the cracks and NTRs give 
a fully functional Norton 2011. Not counted is if one of them may fail now or 
in the future, since that may happen to all the cracks and NTRs. So just pick 
the option(s) which suits you the best, and try your luck !!!
Eitherway, most likely you'll be able to use Norton 2011 till Norton 2012 !!!



!About Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 by BOX!:
**********************************************
Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 (NTR2011-v3.2.0) extends the trial period 
of Norton 2011 (NAV + NIS), so there's more time to evaluate the product.

To extend the trial days, just uninstall the NTR before the subscription 
expires and install the NTR again for another 120/165 days of subscription
(the exact number of days depends on your system and situation).

Norton Internet Security has all the same features as Norton AntiVirus, but 
NIS also includes a firewall and offers full internet protection, unlike NAV. 


Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 was tested on:
*********************************************
- Norton AntiVirus 2011 v18.5.0.125 
- Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 
- Tested on WinXP (x86) and Win7 (x86/x64)

* Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 is not for Norton 360 !!!
* NTR2011-v3.2.0 may not work with future patches/updates.

* File size NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: 2,23 MB (2.341.584 bytes)
* Release date NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: January, 2011


NTR 2011 Update Info:
*********************
Many users reported that NTR v3.1.3 for Norton 2011 v18.1.0.37 causes problems 
if Norton is updated to v18.5.0.125. If your Norton got locked, expired, or if 
some of the Norton settings cannot be entered anymore, then try solving the 
problem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).

Reported is that NTR v3.0.0 BETA can also be used to unlock and activate Norton 
2011 v18.5.0.125 but the Norton background themes can't be changed and creating a
Norton account isn't possible (cause NTR v3.0.0 BETA disables the Norton account). 
 
* Note: NTR v3.0.1 was pulled back by BOX!, so don't use NTR v3.0.1 anyway!



!About the included NIS 2011_Cracks by S&P!:
********************************************  
Recently the three (3) included NIS 2011_Cracks were released 
for Norton Internet Security 2011 by "Shady and Protection (S&P)".

NIS 2011_Crack v2.0 [180 days] by Shady and Protection (S&P) extends 
the subscription status of Norton Internet Security 2011 to 180 days.

To extend the subscription, just run the crack again before the 
subscription expires to get another 180 days of subscription. 

No need to create a fake Norton Account to get rid of the nag.


* Earlier released in january 2010:
***********************************
- NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [180 days] by S&P - Size: 341 kB (349.521 bytes)
- NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [88 years] by S&P - Size: 2,16 MB (2.268.065 bytes)


WARNING !!!
***********
Reported by many users is that both NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [180 days] and
NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [88 years] don't work for long, and that after a few 
hours/days their Norton got locked and/or expired. 

If due to the NIS 2011 cracks by S&P your Norton got locked and/or expired try 
solving the problem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).  

Never heard of "Shady and Protection (S&P)" ??? Then you're not the only one !?! 
For now it seems like the two other NIS 2011 cracks by S&P are pure WEBSHIT .... 
So use the two other NIS 2011 cracks and this updated crack by S&P at own risk !

* Reported however is that the updated NIS 2011_Crack v2.0 [180 days] works fine! 
In that case "Shady and Protection (S&P)" did a real fine job, after having 
caused many trouble with their two earlier releases of the NIS 2011 crack.

After all the trouble maybe "Shady and Protection (S&P)" deserves some credits ...

*** When using TPB please read these important notes: 
*****************************************************

01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6091044/

05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11. In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13. Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1. Norton Internet Security 
2. avast! Pro Antivirus
3. Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.
Malware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
