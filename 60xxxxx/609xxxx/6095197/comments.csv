,UncleDaddy,2011-01-11T14:59Z,So when you posting Norton 180 days keys? LOL
,Soundigy,2011-01-11T16:31Z,"@UncleDaddy: You must be kidding? Right? You're kidding? Probably not. 
- Anyway, try to use your brain, just small part of it and try to read info above, it will be probably little clearer to you. It's so easy!

@RH: Thanks for upload mate and thanks for good informations above, now some things about crack are more clearer to me!
See ya!"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-01-11T16:41Z,thanks for the clean and nice upload mate
,UncleDaddy,2011-01-11T17:18Z,"The torrent merely are (extras) medicine. Up to you to use whichever. NTR v3.2.0 is best bet

My first question is also (extra) Catch my drift?

@Rupert77. Keep your NTR 120 days as it is. Dont become indecisive when 180 days crack appeared. What would you do if Norton 180 days serial keys are posted? lol




"
,UncleDaddy,2011-01-11T18:07Z,"@Soundigy
All the required information, i already read from BOX posting (08 January 2011) before your beloved RobbingHood convey/translated his message here written in his own way. Nevertheless RobbingHood uploads still worth the read for laughs & giggles lol"
,RebelRick,2011-01-12T06:01Z,"I gave the S&P V2.0 (180 days) crack a try and it did give the 180 days BUT at EVERY start up got pop up for register to Norton account,even after I had registered. So I went back to using the BOX 3.2 (120 days) and it works fine with no account pop ups."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-12T10:37Z,"@Rupert77 

You talk a lot but don't read a lot, and obviously you've got no idea how to say thanks ever. At least learn to read."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-12T10:40Z,"@RebelRick 

If the Norton account pops up when using the crack then read the notes ""About the Norton Account"" included in the trial reset folders."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-12T13:02Z,"Torrent description error:
*********************
The two earlier released cracks for NIS 2011 by S&P are NOT released in january 2010 but 2011 ... obviously."
,parmourson23,2011-01-12T13:07Z,Working fine on Windows 7 x64 bit Ultimate this is another reliable 1 from RobbinHood nice work :)

It could not be any faster! "
,MagicHunta,2011-01-15T01:40Z,"Hey, When I use NTR 2011 v3.2.0 by BOX! on a 18.1.0.37 version of NIS, it only gives me 120 days and the ""Norton Account"" thing still pops up.

Does that mean 18.5.0.125 will be the same? @@"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-15T02:30Z,"@MagicHunta 

Howabout doing some reading first? If then still there are good questions left you can always try asking.
"
,yardavers,2011-01-15T09:09Z,The 180 days crack ver2 by S&P works. But I'm keeping my fingers crossed coz had a bad scare from the previous 88 years ver1 previously when the software suddenly expired.
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-15T22:52Z,"@yardavers 

When I tried the 88 year crack NIS expired after about 48 hours. 
It was fine when the computer started, but by the moment I lauched a program immediately, and one by one, all Norton features were locked and disbled, and Norton was expired.
It happened offline, so would happen anyway.

However, the 180 days crack v2.0 seems to work fine, so maybe there'll be a 88 years crack v2.0 later.
180 days is an official Norton license period (offer), so probaly that's more safe to use for Norton cracks."
,czaras1,2011-01-18T01:18Z,"HOW can you be so stupid guys, this torrent includes 7 viruses and you just copy it right to your system ;) good luck

,parmourson23,2011-01-18T18:43Z,czaras1  you are a total fukwit  all RobbingHood stuff is fine to use - i been dl his stuff for a very long time (only that 88 yr S&P crack is dodgy)  :)
[V],RobbingHood,2011-01-18T23:51Z,"@czaras1
Apparently non of your brain cells is active."
,parmourson23,2011-01-21T10:07Z,"gurmsin is correct-just stop the bickering,RobbingHood's stuff is always good & he gives detailed instructions/advice keep it up :)"
,TheNameless23,2011-01-26T13:58Z,"It works 
Thnx Robin !"
,brianxxx,2011-02-01T02:27Z,"I will back RobbingHood up.

Never, ever have I had a single virus or issue at all from anything he has ever uploaded here.

I have tested and run his items (as I do ALL items from the web) under VMWARE, isolated on a Linux host. Installed, checked for changes using the standard methods, scanned for infections - before, during and after.

When all is said and done and I compare the virtual machines 'footprint' compared to after...it is CLEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Never has any RobbingHood upload ever left anything bad behind.

Plenty of false positives, but never anything real. "
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-01T18:23Z,"@brianxxx 

Thnx, but you could've just posted me a cheeseburger instead ...... although a Quarter Pounder would be better ..... lol"
,TheAslan,2011-02-01T19:21Z,"Thanx you so so much for this RobbingHood!! It works very well and there's no viruses in it! But is it possible to extend 3.2.0 subscription days to 360? Right now i got 120 days.

Thanx you so much 4 your norton torrents!!"
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-03T23:55Z,"@TheAslan

Run the trial resetter three times a year and you've got 360 days. Aslans usually aren't as lazy as you are. :D"
,prominence_user,2011-02-07T13:21Z,"@RobbingHood i dunno what shit got in between you and that asshole rupert but all i know is, your torrent works, your torrent rocks, and i can use it. 

the fact that he's longer in here makes no shit. anyone could have made an account here since god knows when and suddenly post good torrents and earn that skull out of nowhere and start trolling around. 

only people like RobbingHood makes piratebay alive. they earn the skulls with their own hard work, and perseverance. and yet, they never troll noobs who ask questions. they try to answer some DUBIOUSLY FUCKED UP questions on false positives, even though they maybe raging inside out. 

in short, RobbingHood, i'm backing you. i swear, if i ever live around your place, i'd buy you 2 quarter pounders as my token of thanks.

peace and out."
[V],RobbingHood,2011-02-07T23:30Z,"@prominence_user 

Two Quander Pounders would be nice indeed, but right now the Happy Meals come with some great toys. So please let it be a Happy Meal .....

,moodyat,2011-04-08T00:41Z,Ok I just made my account so i could post this comment idk if this is all my computers problems but my AVG found viruses in all of your norton files so whoever is backing you up im here to say tht this is not a clean download and i wouldnt trust it if i were you
[V],RobbingHood,2011-04-24T21:43Z,"@moodyat 

Apparently you've never heard of false positives and Sandboxie.
Yet you're making noise like as if you know what you're talking about. 

Learn first, then talk. Otherwise have a banana and be happy, or report this where it should be. 
Or just do all three suggestions, and be more happy."
