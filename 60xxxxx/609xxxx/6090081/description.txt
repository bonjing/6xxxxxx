Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible


twice the fun \/ double the trouble


---------------------------------------------------------------


Sweet and dear RELOADED:

We could easy write a "god who knows endless" pages long reply
to you, but why taking the effort, when you obviously want to
deceive the general nfo reader

It's obvious that to actually mark our SecuROM cracks as a
loader, it has to be a loader(a loader is responsible for
loading programs, one of the essential stages in the process
of starting a program, it means loader is a program that
places programs into memory and prepares them for execution.)

Let's use a few lines to explain what we have done, as you
obvious don't have taken the time to look at our work. It's
fairly easy to explain as we patch the original SecuROM exe to
place our dll into memory, where the SecuROM calls gets the
proper return value, meaning that the calls are emulated. This
nothing out of the ordinary, as you use the same type of
method to emulate VM calls. In sort terms, we simply just
emulated the whole protection. With ours you can perfectly
load them into a debugger too. Get your facts right, before
accusing our SecuROM method for being a loader

About Steam:

We wish to see a example of one of the integrity or system
checks which you were talking about, because we haven't found
any of those and all our cracks are working flawless unlike
yours

About Protection Keygens:

We're pretty sure you would have propered anyone that made
SecuROM activated, the same way you do that for Solidshield v1
and v2. Furthermore keygens were allowed by the premise that
you can activate a product were the activation is integrated
into the product, and not for exe wrappers that have
absolutely nothing to do with the general product. You talk
about breaking the protection on it's own premise by doing
commercial protections with a keygen, that's not any
different, than our SecuROM emulation method

Conclusion:

We don't want to waste any more time on this matter, as it's
obvious nfo shooting on a level the general gamer don't
understand, nor is interested in understanding, as long as
they can play the games. Even the majority of the scene, has
no clue about these things, so why do you think you can fool
us with your blurry rule bending and untrue propaganda

So from now on, we won't reply to more of your propaganda
concerning this matter, and remember you once dominated the
game iso releasing scene, you don't anymore
