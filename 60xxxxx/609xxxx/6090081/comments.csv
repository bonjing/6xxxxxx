,doomslayermax,2011-07-21T09:18Z,"LMAO!!! at the NFO comment , how low crackers.patchers ect go for some respect, and true gamers only care about it working but if we understand how to do it we wouldnt be waiting on cracks from different factions , but thanks for the game and the updates work perfectly only down side no ferry dlc? it would step up your name if you added dlc's as well , i know you's have on other games like fallout las vegas ect +1 rep"
,Mr.8ball,2011-08-03T00:05Z,"anyone knows where can I download user created missions ?
