,SatansCradle,2011-02-01T01:58Z,"Why mp4? Because it's a pain in the ass to extract mkvs and re-mux them to mp4 for people using a ps3/xbox. Also, sometimes you need to re-encode the video depending what settings are used on the original encode. That is why. (xvid/divx are being phased out, that's what this isn't an avi file)"
