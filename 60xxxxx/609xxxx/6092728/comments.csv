,darklordofspawn,2011-01-11T09:35Z,I'll check it out since no1 has commented.
,darklordofspawn,2011-01-11T10:23Z,"It works nicely, but every single time i start it it keeps asking me if i want to update the game to the latest patch (1.11)"
,haggisofdeath,2011-01-14T01:33Z,"thanks for upload but this update nukes my game.

works fine until I install this patch and crack, then mouse doesnt work properly ingame :s I cant change any gfx options or click new game or campaign.

anyone figure out how to fix this? im just going to try out 1.10 in the meantime.

thx again"
,damunzy,2011-01-23T14:34Z,From what I've heard it doesn't work. Game for some now sticks at the Elemental initial screen.
,NephilimNexus,2011-01-24T00:46Z,"Ditto.  Freeze on loading screen, along with video lockout (very difficult to escape from).  Query as to whether this is from a flaw in the crack or errors within the game itself?  I'm guessing the problem is with the game itself, as Skidrow generally does excellent work."
,NephilimNexus,2011-01-24T03:47Z,"Found simple solution to loading screen freeze problem.  Just went into ""Settings.ini"" and changed ""SkipIntro=0"" to ""SkipIntro=1""  Game works fine, now."
,tanniss,2011-01-29T12:39Z,"Actually if you look through the forums for the game it says any time core changes are made the game does the data zip up as it has to rewrite the data
 Problem is it makes the splash screen take forever while its doing it and if you delete the data zip exe yes the game loads but it doesnt allow you to build structures unless im having a completely different bug issue 
   When i load the game and i waited for the few minutes it took to rebuild the data files it plays fine until i try to build anything from the town screen then it gives me a stunted build window and when i go to click build it gives me a red or yellow bar nowhere near the town and doesnt let me build anything"
,stubbieaussi,2011-02-10T09:32Z,"To get this game to work.
Apply the patch then delete the Datazip.exe file.

and if you are just getting a black screen and crash to desktop at startup make sure ATI Tray Tools is not running."
,randomguy0101,2011-02-19T04:16Z,"I downloaded this game then (only) this patch, then bought it because I liked it. This is NOT the 1.11 patch, either that or you must install older patches for it to function properly, although the torrent description claims you don't have to do this. 

Impulse patched me to 1.11 after purchase and it's different. For one, buildings actually cost population points, the text on the UI is slightly different, and those are the only differences I noticed in the first 60 seconds of playing."
,prfella,2011-04-11T09:16Z,"eleting Datazip.exe will get past the loading screen. However, now that I get to the selection screen, I cant click on anythhing other than ""options"" ""workshop"", and ""exit"" . I cant click on new game to start a new game. Anyone know how to get around this?"
,BioHaZZarD99,2011-10-01T07:46Z,"Doing the ""skip intro"" change fixed that, but game has massive bugs, even in 1.11.. Skidrow needs to crack 1.40 (which was released on the 27th) as it seems to fix almost everything.."
