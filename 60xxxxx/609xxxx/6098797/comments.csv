,BoonesFerry,2011-01-13T07:58Z,"The SHOwtime remake of the UK's tv series ""Shameless"" is awful. UGH! Why why why take a great show and fuck it up. I'll give it another try next week but I'm not holding my breath. The original UK version is AWESOME! It just started it's 8th season."

,wck,2011-01-24T13:58Z,"cad needs to get his facts straight...
for one, 'net ball' was actually a copy of basketball, not the other way around. And America didn't invent basketball, Canada did."

don't you know? it is extremely important to the US's imperialist ambitions that they believe they invented everything!
