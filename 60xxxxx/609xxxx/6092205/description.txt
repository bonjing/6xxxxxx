Some of my favourites from the Sixties, remembered from Saturday nights at the Top Rank Suite in Reading, the only place you could hear good soul music for miles around.
I know these are mainly the "commercial" soul tracks, so all you hardened "Northern" soul fans might scoff, but what the hell the music,was and still is good and that's what it's all about !!
