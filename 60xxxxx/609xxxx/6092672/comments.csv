It takes a lot of time to optimize one video, make graphics for it, upload and support that torrent until it is seeded.  By uploading ""Libraries"" the downloader can pick and choose those videos he doesn't already have or take the entire torrent.  Or take a video(s) out of the package and come back again, once the torrent is well seeded, for those he missed.

And it leaves me free from having to constantly monitor and prep individual videos."

yes man but you should provide the screenshots within the torrent itself.

I suggest you use my bulk-thumbnailer

although I'm not a gay, but i do respect a man putting his bandwidth and time for the community "
,MikeXRyan,2011-01-10T15:12Z,"Appreciate the effort for a purple skull but would prefer no skull as it makes me a target from those opposed to gay porn.  I used to hold VIP status and that resulted in derogatory comments and false complaints to moderators of child porn from the homophobic.  They will do/say anything to stop gay porn from being posted.  The majority of the gay community know the quality and reliability of my torrents and that's recognition enough.

As for screen caps: those have to be posted somewhere (imageshack, filefap, etc) and such sites come and go leaving url useless, require registration/confirmation, often deny gay porn shots, have limited space, etc.  Thumbnailers take random shots and little more."
