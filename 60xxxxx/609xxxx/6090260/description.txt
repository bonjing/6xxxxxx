If you are still seeding the last version I posted this has a a few quality upgrades.
Just remove if from your torrent program and download this verson.
It will carry on and over-write the 64k with the new 128k recordngs.




The Goon Show was a popular and influential British radio comedy programme.
Originally produced and broadcast by the BBC from 1951 to 1960 on the BBC Home Service. 
It was heard in the United States as early as the mid-1950s when it was carried on NBC.

The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of silly and bizarre sound effects. 
Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, 
many of which were reused by other shows for decades afterward.

Many elements of the show satirised contemporary life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, 
commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.


The show featured musical intermissions from singer Ray Ellington and his quartet and virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray. 
The BBC announcer Wallace Greenslade provided spoken links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts, usually as himself.


Note: 

All 128K are my recordings from BBC7. The rest are ones found over the years, so thanks to all those cappers.


All the others were stuck into an audio editor to make the levels the same and saved as 64k Stereo.

The reason for this is some MP3 players don't like Mono or files under 64k.

As far as I could check the names (Including IDtags) are now correct via www.thegoonshow.net 
You should look at replacing any of the 64k if you find a better version.
I will only post more Goons if the version is better than the one in this torrent
