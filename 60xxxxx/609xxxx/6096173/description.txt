SUMMARY:
The Year is 2139. The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable 
place called the "Cursed Earth". All of the Earth's population have crowded into 
the cities across the planet, now known as "Mega Cities". The crimes in these 
"Mega cities" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system 
was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely. But, a new Justice System 
came from the ashes, They were 3 justice systems in 1 (Police, Jury and executioner), 
they were called "Judges". In Mega City 1 (formarly, New York), There was a Judge, 
named Joseph Dredd, who was the toughest and most stringent Judge in history. 
One day, he was charged with murder. He was tried and sentenced to life in 
prison because of it. Then, Dredd found out that it was in fact a person who 
shares his DNA. Former Judge Rico. Now, Dredd has to find out what Rico is 
planning to do, and to discover about his past.
