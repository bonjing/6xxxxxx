This is a .dmg file that contains 2 other .dmg files. The first .dmg contains Kid Pix 1.2.3 which works under OSX 5.x.x (Leopard), and the second .dmg file contains the version 1.2.4 update that makes it OSX 6.x.x (Snow Leopard) compatible.

When you open the first .dmg file, if you scroll the window down you will see two Photoshop files that are CD labels, so that if you have a printer that can print on CDs you can put nice labels on the disks you burn from the two subsequent .dmg files.

I gave this program to my grandson for his 8th birthday a.d he had a blast playing with it. His younger brother (4 years old) had just as much fun plus the sound effects the program makes as you select tools and perform various operation (especially \"undo\") had him almost falling out of his chair laughing.
