,Mr.Wizard159753,2011-01-11T10:20Z,"I've been doing research on the internet for the last four hours, but I still can't figure out how to get my computer to seed this file.

HELP!"
,eguatpatto,2011-01-11T14:41Z,"Mr.Wizard, can't you download uTorrent and use that to upload this torrent?"
,espirates,2011-01-11T14:44Z,"You need a bit torrent app, you can download transmission app and use it to seed.  You download and then it automatically seeds."
,espirates,2011-01-12T07:23Z,"I'm stuck half way through, I feel the need for seed.  Come on leeches seed."
