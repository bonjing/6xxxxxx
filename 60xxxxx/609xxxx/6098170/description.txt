Book Description from Amazon.com


When Technology Fails is the first to offer, under one cover, basic instructions and recommended resources
for the wide range of skills and technologies necessary for self-reliant living and achieving mastery of all kinds
of emergency conditions.


A user-friendly "bible" in the tradition of the Whole Earth Catalog, this book provides information that will help
the average person become more self-reliant. In an era of super-storms, burgeoning population, massive
earthquakes, global warming, and record-breaking floods and droughts, more and more people are seeking
to prepare themselves to deal with the difficult times that may lie ahead.


When Technology Fails addresses this universal concern in one engaging and concise volume for the general
reader. A directory of resources and an instructional guide to sustainable technologies, it outlines survival
strategies for dealing with changes that affect food, water, shelter, energy, health, communications, and
essential goods and services.


When Technology Fails provides something for everyone, from parents who want to help their families when
a disaster strikes, to the go-it-alone survivalist, to the eco-minded person who wishes to tread more lightly on
the earth -- whatever the future may hold.
