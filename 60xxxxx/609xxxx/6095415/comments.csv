A-4
V-6

this is awful quality... seriously don't bother, the audio alone makes it unwatchable"
,in_dg94,2011-06-28T16:49Z,@axemblack - which player do you use for these?  I'm using VLC and it works like a charm?
,TorrentJezuz,2011-07-04T03:13Z,"Thanks YIFY
A/10
V/10"
,Zarkow,2011-07-10T00:33Z,"Seriously, overpacked and blocky/blurry can NOT be v:10 in review...unless you guys are watching it on a miniature monitor and sitting 5m away from it..."
,Robo88,2011-08-05T18:13Z,poor video quality...
,phanable,2011-11-09T05:15Z,"V:9
A:10
i don't know why you guys say the torrent isn't good. everything is working great."
,cyb3rc4n,2011-11-11T18:46Z,guys ppl like axemblow zarkoy robo88 are fake users who are from federal institutions.. they want us not to download this movie.... so just ignore them and download it .... YIFY is a trusted user and a trusted user never uploads sh1t. 
,nastrudamus,2011-12-04T14:50Z,Awesome! thanks.
,nymphoses,2011-12-15T09:13Z,blurs all over movie
,o770,2012-02-10T23:44Z,"This is not good indeed, much worse than most of his uploads. Obviously bitrate is too low for so many dark and moving scenes in this movie. Video: 5."
,CrabLength,2012-04-29T21:19Z,"I'm not normally fussed by a/v quality, but the video for this torrent is so bad as to be unwatchable in places, and there is constant blur throughout. Rare for a YIFY torrent. Anyway get another version imo"
,wontquit,2012-06-06T19:31Z,This is being tracked. Copyright Infringement warning.  Just letting you'all know
,stluniverse,2012-06-08T18:26Z,i got hard coded subs with this one unfortunately though with YIFIs record in the past as one of my most trusted uploaders i'm willing to admit that it may have been a mistake on my part somewhere
