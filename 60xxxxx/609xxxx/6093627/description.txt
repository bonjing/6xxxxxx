Following the first Family Guy episode of 2011, writers and producers are either in line for free Red Bull...  or will be receiving some angry letters from the PR Department of that company any day now. 

With Peter trying Red Bull for the first time and becoming an addict, the viewers were treated to some touching family scenes on "New Kidney in Town."

Despite Peterâ€™s kidney failure from drinking his own concoction of Red Bull, the majority of the episode actually revolved around the family members rallying to their patriarchâ€™s bedside during his time of need. 

And Brian proved that he was more than just a dog and friend by sincerely offering to give up his â€œdog kidneysâ€ for Peter.  Sure, itâ€™s a moot point since Brian is a canine, but hey, itâ€™s touching that heâ€™s willing to sacrifice himself for Peter right?

Equally touching were Stewieâ€™s attempts to save Brian, along with his confessions that he didnâ€™t want to lose anyone in the family.  While I do miss the homicidal evil genius Stewie of earlier seasons, itâ€™s nice to see the baby has feelings for his â€œFat Man.â€

While I thought that President Obamaâ€™s scene at the end was clever and unexpected, I also thought that the episode could have stood alone on its own with the main plot.  Also, we finally have an answer for the crazy man-sized chicken!  Itâ€™s actually a creation of Dr. Hartman that went awry.
