Hear the Wind Sing is the first novel by Japanese author, Haruki Murakami; 
it first appeared in the June 1979 issue of Gunzo, one of the most influential literary magazines in Japan. It is the first book in the \"Trilogy of the Rat\" series, which is followed by Pinball, 1973 (1980) and A Wild Sheep Chase (1982). 
An English translation by Alfred Birnbaum appeared in 1987. 

Hear The Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973, the first two books in the trilogy, were never widely distributed in the English-speaking world, having only been published in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding, and both only as A6-sized pocketbooks.

This is an english transtlation in ePub format.
