Genre: Documentary

Description:
When the Commonwealth of Australia was founded in 1901, the very 
last thing the nation wanted to be was multicultural. The measures 
taken to ensure this would be the case not only caused great human 
suffering, but in a supreme historical irony, actually helped create the 
very threat Australia feared the most  invasion from the Asian 
north.
