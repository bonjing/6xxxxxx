,Maharaja-Krishna,2011-01-20T04:20Z,It's not working on my XP SP3: whenever I start the program nothing is happening at all... :((
,WhoIsWho,2011-01-23T21:22Z,"I can confirm this does not work on Windows XP SP3.. The program starts, but neither clicking on the controls and buttons nor trying to move/manipulate the window has any effect. In addition, you cannot close the window properly ('X'-button) but must force the termination of the program.
Has anyone else using XP SP3 experienced this? Please address this asap.."
