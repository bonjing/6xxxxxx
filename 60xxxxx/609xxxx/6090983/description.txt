Nice, cute and normal guy named Hinata finds himself in love with Yoriko and they start dating. Yoriko is not your average girl despite she look and seem very normal, she's an Otaku and not your normal kind of otaku as well! Rinata will soon be plunged into Yuriko's world of Butler's cafes, some cosplay and discover the fanatic obssesion of Yuriko over some special kind of comics... Hinata (now 'Sebsy')tries to follow, understand somehow and even tries to be part of this world along with Yuriko but realizes that it's not just some passing phase, that's Yuriko's lifestyle and it will never change. Hinata will have to question his relationship and decide what to make out of it...can he live with her Fujoshi otaku and play along or be 'converted to one' for the rest of his life?
