You should find a good server for you somewhere and then add it to Favorites. "

1. Right click on killing floor shortcut.
2. Left click Open file folder(F).
3. Doube click rev ( the notepad) 
4. Use your common sence.

,NiGHt-LEshiY,2011-05-07T10:56Z,"@jongamer,
Did you install the game in the right way? Make sure you launch ""RUN_KF.exe"" and have all these files in game folder:
Steam.dll
steamclient.dll
rev.ini
RUN_KF.exe
steam_appid.txt"
