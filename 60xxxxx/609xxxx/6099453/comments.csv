Flawless quality as always, wish there was a way to view subtitles in some of the movies though. Not so bad with English movies but with movies like Defiance with both Russian and English not having subtitles really detracts from the cinematic experience.

If you ever get the time could you upload Pearl Harbor, King Arthur, Scorpion King 1 & 2.
