Rocco's, sister, and her childhood best friend are all meeting at their old hang out spot above the family garage. Jessi and Rocco show up first, and get to talking about old times, including the time everyone was playing spin the bottle. Way back when, Jessi had spun, and the bottle had pointed at Rocco who she had a crush on. Knowing he had to kiss her, the boy panicked, and ran out of the room. Well, that was then, and this is now. Finding a bottle, they decide to relive that fateful day, and this time Rocco is not going anywhere!
