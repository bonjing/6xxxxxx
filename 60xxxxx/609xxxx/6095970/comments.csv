,CaptPeacock,2011-03-25T02:40Z, I prefer dvd-r rips also!
,rabadash,2011-04-09T23:13Z,Danke!!!
,Gijoey,2011-05-19T04:30Z,Any chance you can upload the set without touching the quality?  Thanks
,globalrhythms,2011-09-10T18:27Z,I have to thank you sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the wonderful series that you have uploaded. Always a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. Have to appreciate your efforts in ripping the DVD in almost perfect files and retaining the original quality. Hope this torrent never dies. The best one could find anywhere
,mike18xx2,2011-10-24T07:12Z,"""...The only change I have made is to shrink each individual disc to fit onto a standard sized DVD-R using DVD Shrink. There is very little to no quality loss.....""

-- Immediate down-tick after reading this.

Why would I want to download 50+ gigs of mutilation when I'd rather have 70 gigs of source, or, preferably 25 gigs of upsampled, degrained x264?

C'mon, guys; get with the 2010s here, and stop destroying material with antiquated MPEG extraction tools. Get yourself an 8-core box, rent the set from the library, and shred this sucker proper."
,Blind Pew,2012-01-02T23:36Z,"I agree with Mike, but lots of thanks anyway!
:)
I'll keep on seeding."
,ikelitept,2012-01-07T13:01Z,"Simply excellent :) I agree with you on ""Shrink""ing to Recordable DVD size. I have noticed that subtitles are English and Spanish... Its possible to have others? Like Portuguese?
Cheers and thanks :)"
,j_purvis,2012-02-10T00:57Z,I sincerely appreciate you putting up this torrent.  I can see how it would be convenient for some people to have these file sized to burn to DVD.  Would you please consider uploading the collection without any shrinking?  I would really appreciate it and I know others would too! Thank you. 
,razaman,2012-02-21T22:42Z,"Very nice torrent.  Appreciate the upload of the DVD's.  I took the liberty and encoded each episode at 1600 in h264 so they are about 650 megs a piece bringing the whole collection down to about 29 gigs with little loss.  I also made sure to name each episode with scrape friendly tagging (s01e01 etc...) so programs like xbmc can easily catalog the episodes for you.

If the uploader would like this collection to make a new torrent I'd be happy to provide the new files.

Thanks again, it's great to have all these episodes of this quality finally on my computer."
