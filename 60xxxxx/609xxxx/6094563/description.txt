I purchased this album after hearing a Radio 3 programme in which the presenters tried to answer the title question. This was their choice. I have been an amateur musician for years, and have probably played in the orchestra for Messiah 30-40 times. I was hugely impressed by the choir's singing in this version. They sang with life, with sparkle, with an energy not usual associated with this music. I have listened to the choruses many times, and have yet to tire of them. I suspect this interpretation is not for a traditionalist, but if you are a enjoy the Messiah and can accept something different, this is a good investment.


Enjoy and Seed!!
