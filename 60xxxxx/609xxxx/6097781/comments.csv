If u wouldn't mind, can I make a couple of requests while I wait? If you could please take into consideration, they should all have blu-rays:


Rising Sun 1993 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107969/
There is a copy on TPB that I downloaded. It doesn't have English subtitles for the Japanese parts though, was wondering if you could get one with them added.

The Mask Of Zorro 1998 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120746/
Would be a good one to add. There is a copy on TPB that I can download if you don't want to do it. Just wondering if I can get it in your quality.

The Mighty Quinn 1989 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097880/
Pretty good, it won't be a disappointment. There is a copy of it on TPB but it has Swedish subtitles...

The Boondock Saints 1999 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144117/

would like these in the regular 1280x528 or w/e width u've been using if possible. They all have blu-ray editions, not sure of sources that you use though. Thanks in advance.

I was wondering if you take requests, i'd like to make a few of my own if you don't mind. They all have blu-ray discs available. And would make pretty good additions to your list I think.
