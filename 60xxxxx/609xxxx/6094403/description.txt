Amazon.com - Known primarily for his heavy smokers anthem, 'Cloud 9,' and the frenetic energy of his song 'Haterz Everywhere,' B.o.B scored a record deal with Atlantic Records while he was still in high school. Now, the teen-aged rap phenomenon is ready to bring his genre-bending style nationwide with his highly anticipated debut, 'B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray' on Rebel Rock/Grand Hustle/Atlantic Records. 'B.o.B Presents: The Adventures of Bobby Ray,' is a fascinating journey into the Atlanta artist's far-reaching imagination. On the track 'Not Alone,' a song B.o.B describes as an alternative rock chant, he touches on his pain as a child who was unable to fit in with his own peers. The Tombz-produced cut, 'Camera,' explores the story of a young woman who chooses life as a stripper over a college education.
B.o.B continues to rap to the ladies on 'Cyber Heaven,' where he claims his lovin' will take them out of this world, while 'Haterz Everywhere' featuring Rich Boy, a song that has flooded the South since its release in early 2007, proves his stronghold over the competition. B.o.B's most honest reflection of his artistic intent comes on 'Trippin',' where he raps about using his craft as a therapeutic means of solving his feelings of eccentricity. 'I feel like I have a really different perspective,' he says. 'When I grew up it was really hard for me to figure out why I felt that way, like I really felt like I was from another planet. Now, it's the opposite. All of that time I spent developing my talent and really analyzing myself, now I feel like I can express all of that and give all of my energy and love to the world.' After producing the majority of his album by himself and learning to play multiple musical instruments - including the piano, trumpet and French horn - B.o.B is destined to spread his message of creativity and empowerment through his music. 'I just want to show people that there are endless possibilities of what you can do,' he says. 'You don't just have to be a rapper, you don't just have to be a trapper; you can be anything you want to be and whatever you do, just love it and it will show.'
