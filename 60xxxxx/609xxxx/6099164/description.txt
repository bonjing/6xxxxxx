THIS TORRENT is a RE-UPLOAd of "Eva (1962) DVDRip H264 K42"

For those of you who are new to it, no problem, its just a Torrent where the main movie is inside another folder.
Just download and seed. DO NOT READ FURTHER.

For those of you who had downloaded the Old Torrent many are stuck at 99.8% thanks to some Bastards from Amsterdam.
The movie and subs that you downloaded are totally functionnal, but the torrent seems to never complete.
And therefore it appears as having no seeders !!

For those of you who want to seed you have a choice:
  - Either you leave it as it is, you seed an incomplete torrent, not really savy
  - Or you reload entirely the new Torrent. Time and Bandwith consuming.
  - or you perform this little trick:

1/ Open the New torrent. let the files install themselves.
2/ Check the  "Eva (1962) DVDRip H264 K42" directory  is present in your New torrent Files
3/ Stop the new torrent; STop, not remove !
4/ Move your old Torrent main directory unter the new Torrent. Answer "yes" to every "copy And Replace" you are asked.
5/ Force Recheck on the new Torrent. You will discover that you have "downloaded" Most of it !!
6/ Start the new torrent. It should complete in a few seconds or minutes.

KEEP SEEDING.

Sorry for the inconvenience. We tried our best to correct the situation created by these TorrentSpammers,
 while not imposing on you to use more of your bandwith thanks to a simple manipulation. 
Let us know what you think of it.
