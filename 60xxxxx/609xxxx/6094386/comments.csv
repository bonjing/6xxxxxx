[T],n2kmaster,2011-02-07T19:13Z,"Thanks bud, I'm trying to get a 500 gig one of TV shows up and ready for the ipod/psp as well. They aint dvd rips so dont expect tip top quality, almost all of them were converted by me to mp4 from DVD rips so they are pretty good quality on the small pc screens, but they were designed for my sons ipod"
,warfrog101,2011-02-17T18:12Z,please seed there are so many good movies in this!
,hedleygrange,2011-02-24T22:41Z,please seed. awsome up btw
,hedleygrange,2011-03-03T13:25Z,hey N2KMaster i was wonderin if you have a daily/weekly seeding time cause id like to be online when your seeding im at 11% and been downloadin for 2 weeks i dont want to give up on this one its looks too good. Thanks in advance
[T],n2kmaster,2011-03-04T04:18Z,"K heres the thing with my inet and this, i was stuck behind a rogers connection that was super lame in the upload dept, luckily another rival company offered 15 megs down/1 meg up in my area. This torrents speed has started to increase, i can tell you 4 seeders are showing up here so far so i've already got this like uploaded 1.19 ratio myself, also the other difference between the companies is this one doesnt max bandwidth or charge overage, my upload speed itself has increased on this x50 in the last day with this upgrade, but 138 gigs, im only one man lol. the thanks are appreciate, and i will continue to seed until i see hundreds on this one, ive been pausing other torrents i felt had enough seeds on them already. Now that i got the inet to actually handle giving out my goodies its gonna get better. All these shows and such once mature are going on N2KMaster.HDVideo.ca as well in the same formats, downloadhelper and ff and you'd get them faster im assuming i only have a few shows up there, pain in the butt getting all my mapped network drives and such totally working with me"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-03-04T04:20Z,"Also i should add my 100/1000 nic card is coming so all the speed will increase again once thats here, been stuck with crappy inet waaaaay to long for my liking"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-03-06T00:40Z,"K to all these little dine and dashers, file pigging then not sharing for others is TOTALLY NOT COOL in my book. Help seed this. We had a total of 4 seeders yesterday and then 3 of them pussed out and left. I'm building another pack with 199 movies in it if you all help get like 100 seeders on this, im seeding as fast and as much as i can. This torrent will only stay alive if you help it. Tell you what if i see at least 50 seeders stay on this ill put up the other 199 (which i might add no DUPES to this one and most of them are new new movies as well preconverted to mp4 if thats an initiative.)"

[T],n2kmaster,2011-07-09T04:04Z,"crap, comp the second packs on just went down, its the board or the cpu/ram or something like that, the drives are intact just the board or something went on it. Either way, upgrading the slow machine to a p4 2.0 gigger tomorrow and will make sure its back up again"
