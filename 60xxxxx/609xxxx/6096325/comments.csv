**Update**

Axxo Himself is now an uploader here at torrentday...Yes, he is the real deal, Verified By TDG himself....

Its official guys. He's back!"
,samqran,2011-01-12T14:01Z,"if that's axxo then he has to step up his game
people now like BRips and i personally don't download anything less than 1.4 Gbit; else the quality sucks..."
,kinsah,2011-01-12T23:19Z,"@samgran
I do download 700 MB films... by the way, take some 700 Mb old aXXo films and compare with some other 1.4 Gb new releases: aXXo still figures greater just because he do know how to rip and configure compression with lossless algorithms. This is it..."
,The_Loozer,2011-01-15T00:38Z,Can someone at least be asked to rate A and V?
,db110688,2011-01-15T23:17Z,"samqran, everyone does NOT like brrips. I hate when all I can find is BRrips of movies. Im perfectly happy with 700 mb dvd rip. I hope aXXo really is back & I hope he continues uploading the way he always has! 
A:10
V:10"
,thadream101,2011-01-17T06:07Z,I have downloaded 5 brrips of this movie and they are all cinavia protected so it is nice to see a good dvdrip every now and then
,mitavittua,2011-01-19T07:29Z,"Excellent quality,well worth downloading"
,Seizmik,2011-01-23T23:12Z,"This is a copycat uploader. aXXo is not back and probably never will be.

TvTeam uploads under various well-known alias'(of other users) such as SWESUB; CiCXX, W4F, VoMiT, MOMENTUM, etc.)

By all means, download, but you are aiding a fraud."
