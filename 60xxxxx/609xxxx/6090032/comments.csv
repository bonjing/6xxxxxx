,RoundRogue,2011-04-02T23:46Z,"@psmods,
You do realise this is NOT a videogame, right? Idiot spammers.

Anyway, would it be possible to upload the Blu-Rays of LOTR, but with the extra bits from the extended versions added in Standard Definition? That what i'd be able to watch it in High Definition without having to go watch the original Standard Definition ones for the extra 45 mins or so. (Do you get what I mean?)"

,capsl0ck0n,2011-05-06T08:43Z,"To the people saying the subtitles are in Polish...

Just delete any other files in the folder that aren't video files. The Elfish to English subtitles are hardcoded."

I could watch the sample using the Ps3 just fine, but when i open the file, theres an error, corrupt! i just cant open the file maybe because the file is mp4? while the sample isnt?"
,JoHnXIIIDoE,2011-06-11T09:28Z,So can anyone please tell me how to fix this? i doubt it the instruction to fix it would help since i can view it just fine only watching thru ps3 is a problem

,killrobot,2011-08-27T22:28Z,"not one fucking comment works on this torrent!!! why the fuck!!!! i need some serbian subtitles, and not one works, ive tried from 432 sites and 324subtitles wtf is this shit!!"
,killrobot,2011-08-27T22:29Z,lol i wrote comment instead of subtitle cause im so pissed from this torrent ey.. 
,killrobot,2011-08-27T22:31Z,NOT ONE SUBTITLE WORKS ON THIS MOVIE!!! IVE TRIED 435 SUBTITLES AND ALL OF THEM ARE OUT OF THE PROPER TIME! I CANNOT MAKE THEM WORK PROPER. THIS IS CRAZY!!!
,rbr651,2011-09-12T13:13Z,Holy shit you speak 435 languages...you're fucking amazing! Nice download for those that speak the English.
,QoMSoL,2011-09-30T07:41Z,Confirmed. This is NOT the extended cut version of the trilogy. The first movie should run for like 3h 40m. There are absolutely no traces of the extended version footage. That is a shame.
,klausbaus,2012-01-23T12:38Z,"Ripping films with AAC 5.1 is a waste. It save only very little space compared to the size of the film and only brings trouble. Most dolby receivers can NOT process AAC 5.1 so you end up with just 2 channel stereo or some simulated fake surround. If you rip 5.1 DTS IS THE WAY TO GO, if you must AC3 is fine too. But ripping to AAC is a wasted opportunity."
,Jacksn,2012-02-08T10:23Z,"Excellent video quality, and as klausbaus mentioned already a DTS 5.1 would've done the trick, but I still say A:9 - but why would you completely ruin the torrent by hardcoding somewhat ugly, incomplete, eventually out of sync elvish subtitles..."
,barbarosac,2012-04-06T17:55Z,"nice work
like evreting in the FASM
but i aspected to see HAPPY FEET DOULOGI in the FASM rip because in my opinian is the best qulity.
I love HAPPY FEET and my child she loved.
i cant belive whay  nobody not converted in FASM FOR PS3.Is the best movie for children, and for us.
I just hope is not just my request , i belive is a lot of people how want to see this movie in the best quality ( FASM - PS3 ) And i hope sombody it will encode for PS3 SOON.          "
,hunterhl,2012-04-07T05:59Z,so im new to this site and i would like to know what is the best way to copy this on to dvds ?
