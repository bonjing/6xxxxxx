,Deevious9,2011-06-04T05:31Z,"Infinite is actually a 2003 pirated release out of Europe:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_(Eminem_album)

Track names aren't included, soooo:
12) Scary Movie
13) 3 Verses
14) Nuttin' to Do
15) Three Six Five
16) Trife Thieves
17) Low, Down, Dirty
18) Murder Murder
19) No One's Iller Than Me
20) Watch Deez
21) Distorted (Freestyle)
22) It's Only Fair to Warn (Freestyle)
23) Greg (Freestyle)

Track #23 goes by a few names, but it's the same lyrics as the bonus track from Slim Shady LP, so I listed it as Greg instead of Met a Retarded Kid."
