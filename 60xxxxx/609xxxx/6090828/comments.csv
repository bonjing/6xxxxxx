How's The Download Going? :)"
,4070,2011-01-17T02:15Z,I don't know why but my AVG just stopped this from downloading and sent me a virus alert
,4070,2011-01-17T02:22Z,It says in my avg file that it is a unknown virus win32/dh.aa54534fa8. Nice I download here all the time and I see that there is 35 pluses so why did I get a virus. NICE
,grafdrm,2011-01-17T20:34Z,"I downloaded and installed.  Now when it starts it comes up with the login box for ""Administrator"" and I don't know the password.  What's the Admin password?  Please HELP!"
[T],Computer-User,2011-01-18T02:08Z,"""4070""

Look I Don't Know Why Your Anti-Virus Red Flagged This Torrent, Other Than The Activation Program.

But There Is Nothing For You Too Worry About In Any Of My Torrents.

Did You Do A Clean Install?"
,grafdrm,2011-01-18T16:48Z,"I did a clean install as I had never had XP on this machine.  Regular startup asks for Admin password.  I tried booting in safe mode and got multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(1)partition errors which means Windows install is corrupt.  

So it seems this XP download doesn't work.  Open to any ideas.  Thanks"

I Fully Test Every 1 Of My Operating System B 4 I Release Them, I've Never Had That Problem.

No 1 Else Has Told Me That They've Had That Problem Either Bro....."
,Invitation_To_Hades,2011-01-30T06:43Z,"I have some questions I hope you can answer. Aside from all the updates all the way up to December 2010 integrated, is anything else changed or added? If so what are they?

Also, say for example I have a Windows XP Home Machine complete with legitimate Product Key. Is the Activation Program integrated as well? I would like to enter my own legitimate key so I was wondering.

Lastly; is this the same for your XP Professional Image?"
[T],Computer-User,2011-01-31T17:14Z,"""Invitation_To_Hades""

There Is No Added Or Changed Programs All Of My Windows XP Are Full Retail And Untouched, The Only Changes Are The Windows Updates Integrated."

,swan101,2011-03-10T12:44Z,can you turn on auto updates or can you not update it ?
,havasufem,2011-03-13T21:32Z,"I got a few virus warnings too, even in Vuze Plus' anti-virus. If you google it, it tells you that they CAN BE harmful but if installed by an administrator it is fine. I just turned off protection and the program is installing on  my other computer as we speak! All seems fine to me! A++++"
,havasufem,2011-03-13T21:34Z,"@ Swan - It is supposed to be genuine if you follow all the steps, so you can turn on updates. "

,mike18xx2,2011-07-17T13:29Z,Can you do a Repair-Install?
,turrel,2011-08-18T21:01Z,"wow Adapa that's a bit harsh, especially for a generous torrent provider, how about a written warning first? seriously no offense but some moderators develop a dictator type psyche, 
i guess it's the only power your type will ever wield."
