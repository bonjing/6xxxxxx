,imbackagain0101,2011-01-10T11:25Z,many tnx
,runtimmy,2011-01-10T12:54Z,thanks
[V],CanadaJoe,2011-01-11T01:48Z,Audio out of sync..  :(
,juancarr,2011-01-11T12:31Z,For a TC it's pretty good V:10 A:10 - @CanadaJoe's  brain is maybe out of sync cos the audio was OK for me  (played with MPC)
,juancarr,2011-01-11T13:23Z,Very fast download too
,lost_and_idle,2011-01-11T18:05Z,use vlc player to adjust sync settings ....then use the +/- and adjust accordingly in convertxtodvd to convert and burn to disc for perfect copy
,2689,2011-01-11T19:04Z,"Well I used VLC player and audio was OK. It was not out of sync. 

And yes its a good DVDSCR quality, may be 7 out of 10, but definitely not 10 out of 10.
"
,juancarr,2011-01-12T08:12Z,"This is labeled as TC and not a DVDSCR so @2869 your comment about V:7 does not apply, if you've watched any of the other CAM copies this is way superior and I could not fault it (no blurry pictures, no heads chopped off etc). Maybe when somebody get a real DVDRip then maybe we'll see better."
,ixqu,2011-01-12T14:07Z,"Good quality, definitely the best one out there.

7/10

Thanks for the up!"

,kiwilove007,2011-01-21T16:06Z,The Best telecine currently available.. better than any other TC.
,malcinblue,2011-01-21T19:24Z,"agree - best of the bunch up to now. 
v 7 
a 7"
,luke_s,2011-01-21T19:31Z,"Audio is synced and the quality is as good as a Telesync (camera set up in the cinema camera booth with tripod with audio directly connected to the source) will ever get (Telecine implies that a special camera was used or that the physical film was scanned frame by frame which is highly unlikely).

If 1080p is a 10, 720p is a 9, DVD is a 8, purchased VHS is 7, copied purchased VHS is 6, VHS recorded from TV is a 5, third copy made of that recording is a 4, a good cam is a 3, unfocused and cropped cam is a 2 and 1 being unwatchable I'd give this release:

V: 5
A: 6

In other words until there's a DVD or Blu-Ray release (screener or otherwise) this is probably the best quality you will get. Thanks for a good release, me and my GF both enjoyed the movie :)"
,MrLoss,2011-01-23T08:25Z,"If you want to really enjoy this movie, then please do not download this dirty print. Don't waste bandwidth. Wait for the BRrip 720p. The Blue ray will release on 29  March 2011.

,yakuzakitty,2011-02-25T02:20Z,"A: 8
V: 5

The best one out there, perhaps. But if I were you, I'd wait 'till the DVD comes out for a DVDRIP and hence better quality.

But if you can't wait, then this is the torrent for you."
