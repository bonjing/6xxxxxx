,55trucker,2011-01-17T05:07Z,"Agreed. 
I have the VHS version of the original theatrical movie. There are English subtexts (not subtitles) that appear only whenever there is Japanese dialogue in the movie. That is missing from this version. Aside from that I enjoyed the cleaner HD remastering. Nice work.  "
,bjr2293,2011-01-24T05:45Z,The box photo says Extended Japanese Cut. Maybe the English sub-texts for Japanese speech weren't an option on this version.  Would have been nice though.  I can live with full subtitles if I have to.  IMHO this is the best and most authentic Pearl Harbor movie ever made.  Thanks for the rip BOZX.
,icepax,2011-09-07T15:22Z,"@BOZX: Thanks, mate. Greatest war film ever made - far surpassing Bruckheimer's crappy 2001 Pearl Harbour.

I've been looking for an MKV version of this film for a while now - finally found one! Cheers :)"
,icepax,2011-10-18T19:13Z,"The only war film to cast non-mainstream actors in lead roles so your attention is concentrated on the film and not on the actors themselves.

Whereas other war films tend to distract you:
1. The Longest Day: Distracted by Wayne, Burton, Mitchum, etc.
2. The Desert Rats: Distracted by Burton and Mason.
3. Midway: Distracted by Heston and Fonda.
4. Saving Private Ryan: Distracted by Hank and Damon.

and so on..."
,enonumus,2012-03-21T01:37Z,"Can't say that I agree that a movie can't be as good, compelling, or accurate if it has one or more A-list Hollywood actors in it.  Saving Private Ryan was one of the best war movies ever made imho, as were Platoon and Apocalypse Now.  All of those movies had major Hollywood actors in them, and it didn't cause me to spend all my time gawking at them or lingering on their every word.  A really good actor will have just the opposite effect and have you believe that they're not some big time actor, but rather the grunt, or officer, or pilot that they're portraying.  

That said, it goes without saying that Tora! Tora! Tora! was unquestionably one of THE best war films ever made, and you don't HAVE to have A-list actors in a war movie to make it a great movie.  The most important thing, for anybody that really knows movie making (an industry I've worked in for 20 years), is the director and the editor, and of course the script.  "
