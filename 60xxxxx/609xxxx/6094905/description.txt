The Peter Schiff Show
Monday, 10 January 2011


[sebaygo1]


Tonight's show will be hosted by Andrew Schiff with guest Jacob Sullum, Reason Magazine senior editor & author of "Saying Yes: In Defense of Drug Use," on how anti-gun advocates are already exploiting the Arizona tragedy. 

Later in the show, Nick Baumann, assistant editor at Mother Jones, will join us to discuss his exclusive interview with Bryce Tierney, close friend of the Arizona madman Jared Lee Loughner. And finally Patri Friedman, executive director of the Seasteading Institute, will be on to tell us why the best hope for liberty may exist atop a series of small manmade ocean communities.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
