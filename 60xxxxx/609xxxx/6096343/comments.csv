A/8
V/7
There's a couple of focus problems throughout the movie and it's a bit dark in places, but the audio is pretty good... still a watchable copy...
Good movie with some Excellent fight scenes...
Many Thanx to .BONE. and TOXiC-iNK for this decent rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a really quick download...:)"
