,christo7,2011-08-14T05:17Z,"This is one awesome torrent, HMD3, I must say! You say you didn't include any singles that had no unique content that couldn't be found elsewhere. You probably know this, but the Brain Stew/Jaded single includes an early acoustic version of ""Good Riddance"" without the violins and such that were in the song on Nimrod. That's actually what I'm looking for (at least an mp3 version that's better than my 128kbps mp3). Others might be interested in it as well! Again, amazingly comprehensive torrent! I didn't have Foxboro Hot Tubs' ""Highway 1"" until now."
