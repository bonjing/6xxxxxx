This compilation includes two-thirds of Maria Valtorta's famous "Poem of the Man-God". If you happen to have any of the missing chapters, I would be grateful if you could scan and upload them to the Pirate Bay. Included in this torrent is geographical evidence which supports the poem.

In addition, to those of you who are familiar with the events occurring in Medjugorje, the visionary Vicka IvankoviÄ‡ claims:
â€œOur Lady says The Poem of the Man-God is the truth. Our Lady said if a person wants to know Jesus, he should read the Poem of the Man-God by Maria Valtorta. That book is the truth.â€

I strongly recommend that the more skeptical among you research the subject of the
Blessed Virginâ€™s apparitions and miracles at Medjugorje.

This work is the real thing - a genuine, divinely inspired, elaboration on the events of the gospel!

If you are convinced after reviewing all the evidence, I strongly recommend you send this torrent to anyone who is willing to listen and is patient enough to read the poem!

For those too busy to read so many wonderful pages about Jesus, His family, friends (and enemies) it can be said: "We played the pipes for you and you wouldn't dance; we sang sad songs and you wouldn't cry." Matthew 11:17

Peace be with you always
