And I hope you don't take this the wrong way, as I'm not trying to attack you, but I don't get the attitude of you and others who seem to consider it boring that the fame girls haven't gone nude yet. If you want nudity, there are plenty of other models all over the internet posing that way. That's not what these girls have ever been about, so what makes you think they're suddenly going to change the entire basis of their modeling? 

I haven't downloaded the whole set yet, but the previews for this set look pretty good. Virginia has a great ass and legs, and I always like to see her modeling pantyhose or stockings."
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-01-12T07:09Z,"I don't want to see them nude. I like the tease. Last weeks set was a perfect example of how they should do the sets. What they are doing however, is nothing different than the models in a Sears catalog."
,beccyd,2011-01-12T08:12Z,"I agree with you ""tngfan"" and i agree with the comments of ""webmodelsindex"" The modelling that the 3 Fame girls do is there style and personally i do firmly believe it would be the end of the road for them once they remove their kit and pose open legged, it's not what most of us want to see. However there is the need here to spice up the modelling shoots of these girls and it has to be said that most photo set releases could be shot and used for any child or adult wear clothing catalogue. I have been a professional photographer now for over 15 years and it is very easy to make the sets a little more appealing to the collectors, some of the attire these girls wear went out with the ark. Thx for uploading it and none of this is aimed at the uploader, But it is aimed at the photographer and the 3 girls. "
,turicum13,2011-01-12T15:10Z,"I like to see her nude from every position. And Sandra & Ella too. If you like to see nn Girls, go to Sears and enjoy. Thanks anyway webmodelsindex and we still waiting for the right stuff.."
,aftyrbyrn,2011-01-12T16:02Z,"They'll never be nude.  As stated, once they are nude, wheres the fun?  Everybody will be all about it for a few sets, and then yawn.  You've seen one, you've seen em all.  

But they definitely need to be more risque!  A little more sheer on the bottom side would be nice.  Of course none of our input will help, their sets are done for the next year i bet."
[T],reactor90,2011-01-12T21:57Z,The way you people talk is just sickening 
,BogAZog,2011-01-12T22:12Z,"Let's face it, most of us view and collect these sets because we find the girls attractive. And why not? There won't be many of us complaining if they showed a little more skin, however I must agree that total nudity would tarnish the image for me. Don't get me wrong, I would DEFINATELY have a look, who wouldn't? I'm not opposed to the odd ""slip"" here and there. None the less, big thanks to webmodelsindex for the index site and the regular posts, it's much appreciated by me and no doubt many others."
,BogAZog,2011-01-12T22:18Z,Sickening to whom? and why exactly?
,lodger111,2011-01-12T23:47Z,"Just to reactor, and because he's a moron."
,yarisdude,2011-01-13T02:02Z,I thought he was just gay?
,cult22,2011-01-13T19:20Z,"reactor =  moron. = agree
take a gun and blow your head fucker"
,wolf421,2011-01-16T18:13Z,"How in the heck did Reactor90 get a skull? If it's the reactor I'm thinking about he's about as sick as they come and he wants to talk about us wanting to see these women nude as sick? WTF? 
But then again we are talking about TPB that rewards idiots like reactor with a skull for being a general nuisance here on TPB....
But really I've all but stopped looking over here on TPB for anything since they changed last month banning people for wedding pictures....
Which is why I was banned with everyone else just because some holier than thou religious nut job of a mod got his panties in a knot..
Yeah they banned me for posting a rar of Sandra's wedding pictures....
What a crock...  "
