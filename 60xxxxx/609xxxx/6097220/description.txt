Darah Garuda Merah Putih 2 Filled with action tense and brilliantly photographed by talented actors on the boards of Indonesia, GARUDA BLOOD film is a story about the cadetsâ€™ heroic guerrilla group on the island of Java in 1947.

Divided by their secrets in the past, and a sharp conflict in terms of personality, social class and religion, the four young men banded together to launch a desperate attack against the camp owned by the Dutch, in order to save the women they loved.

The cadet is connected with the headquarters of General Sudirman, where they were given a highly classified assignment behind enemy lines in West Java: a commando-style attack on a vital airfield that can reverse the resistance of the rebels against the tyranny that has been done General Van Mook on August 1947. Penetrate deep into the forest, they met another group of Muslim separatists, as well as new allies or potential traitors: Colonial spy himself and allies with the rank of civilians from the streets, and an old enemy is responsible for the Dutch intelligence.
