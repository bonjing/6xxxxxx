,therockernextdoor,2011-05-13T22:12Z,"if i convert this to mp3, will the size be bigger?? or smaller??"
,therockernextdoor,2011-06-03T08:12Z,how can i convert this to mp3??? please someone answer.
,therockernextdoor,2011-06-04T00:53Z,"oh my god! why are they all in one file??? in an album, all of the tracks are combined together! how can i split them to individual files and convert to mp3??? omg, how can you even play a track that you want, when you don't know what album it is in or if it is even there! why would you combine all the tracks in one? who would do that? and why would anyone want that, it's flac, ok you can convert it to mp3, but the problem is they are all in one file! wtf! you can't select what you want to play and you don't even know if it is there! wtf! i wouldn't recommend this torrent! people, don't download this! it sucks! it may be the biggest carpenters collection available for download in the internet but all of the tracks are in one file! and they're all flac! fuck!"
,therockernextdoor,2011-06-04T01:56Z,"ok sorry for the previous comment, i was very rude. i found a way to split them to single tracks just follow this tutorial: http://www.simplehelp.net/2009/03/02/how-to-split-a-single-flac-file-into-multiple-tracks/
and this to convert to mp3:
http://www.simplehelp.net/2006/08/14/how-to-convert-flac-files-to-mp3-using-windows/
I also found out that flac is best high quality you can get in audio files, flac means Free Lossless Audio Codec, it maintains the same quality as it is in the original cd, only the file is much much more bigger, but what the hell??! i take it back, this is the best carpenters torrent in the internet. long live the music."
