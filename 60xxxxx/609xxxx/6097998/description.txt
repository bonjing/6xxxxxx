           In this unique and dynamic live concert experience, Louis      
           C.K.'s exploration of life after 40 destroys politically       
           correct images of modern life with thoughts we have all        
           had... but would rarely admit to. Louis C.K.: Hilarious,       
           premiered at The Sundance Film Festival as the first           
           stand-up concert film presented at Sundance and has            
           received rave reviews confirming why Louis C.K. is the         
           most respected comedic voice of his generation.
