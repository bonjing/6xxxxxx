- "Politics in Arizona Have Become Fueled By Hate...Driven By Anger:" Rep. Raul Grijalva on Shooting of Giffords

Federal prosecutors have charged Jared Lee Loughner with the attempted assassination of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ). She was shot in the back of the head at close range on Saturday morning outside a supermarket in Tucson where she was holding an event called "Congress on Your Corner" to meet with constituents. In all, 20 people were shot, six were killed. The dead include U.S. District Judge John Roll, Giffords' aide Gabriel Zimmerman, a nine-year-old girl born on Sept. 11, 2001, and three people in their late 70s. We speak with Giffords' fellow Arizona House Representative, Raul Grijalva, about the shooting.

We speak with Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik.


- Jeff Biggers: Arizona Facing "Lethal Combination" of "Hate-Filled Speech" & "Dangerous and Easy Access to Weapons"

"Arizona] is a gun state," says Tucson-based journalist Jeff Biggers. "I think we see a huge difference between the right to own a weapon to go hunting or to defend yourself and the right for mentally disturbed people to purchase semiautomatic firearms without any sort of registration or regulation." We speak to Biggers about Arizona's gun laws.


- Chip Berlet on "The Becking of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords"

We speak with Chip Berlet, co-author of Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort. In his latest article, Berlet writes, "From a moral viewpoint Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is the victim of demagogues such as Glenn Beck and his allies at Fox News and in the Tea Party Movement. This is not about legal liability but about moral culpability. This is about a nation that has lost its moral compass."
