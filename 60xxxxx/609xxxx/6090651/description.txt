This edition of Press TV's On the Edge with Max Kaiser sheds light on some behind-the-scenes realities of the silver market. The main problem with the precious metal is that, in some transactions there is no real, physical silver and what the investor gets in return for his money is paper silver. Some federal banks have pursued the trend for a quite long time and continue to do add to their huge pile of liability by issuing more and more paper silver. The manipulation is feared to leave a huge impact on the market in the long run.
Max interviews David Morgan.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
