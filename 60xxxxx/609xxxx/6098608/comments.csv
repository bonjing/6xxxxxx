,Fallstaff,2011-01-30T00:20Z,"Some questions:
Why is this one 8.8 gigs and the other one* only 2.75 gigs?
Is the mac version on this?

Thanks!

,Fallstaff,2011-02-01T10:02Z,"Turns out that yes, the mac installer is in there. 
Installs alright, updates just fine, but appears to be the Broadcast version."

,crayz16,2011-02-28T14:59Z,kevinthdinosaur - I need help with some of the moGraph functions. It seems that there is no 'Rigid Body' with the moGraph function. Is there something missing from the installer? 
,akaismac,2011-03-10T14:20Z,"this torrent apparently includes, the archive where is stored the image iso + the image iso itself + the installation files, until i downloaded all of it i didn't figure it out, so downloading only the iso image + the serial
NB : 
Only DOWNLOAD THE ISO IMAGE + SERIAL FOLDER, that's all u need, the rest is just a replica of the contents of the image
Thanks uploader but u should have mentioned this for the leechers ;)
try to do so in the description
THanks, cheerio"
,ferji_cool,2011-03-15T08:09Z,"hey friends, don't download everything. only download rar file and serial, thats all....
img file(pnt-c412.iso) is in pnt-c412.rar and other files/folders i.e. setup.exe,autorun.inf,installation Guide US_DE.pdf,distributers.pdf,bin,quick start body paint 3d,quick start cinema 4d are inside of pnt-c412.iso file......

so just download serial folder and pnt-c412.rar its in 2.75gb only, no need to download all crap...

uploader just used a bad trick to get attention by un-necessarily increasing size....

its a crap...."
,ferji_cool,2011-03-15T08:12Z,"bad upload, bad uploader, unnecessarily size increased...
just follow my last comment to save the time and your data limit...."
,kevinthdinosaur,2011-03-27T15:13Z,"@Ferji_cool
The reason it is 8.8 GB is because it comes with Body Paint 3D and it comes with an .ISO of both Cinema 4D and Body Paint 3D for burning to a disk. It's not for attention... As you can see, this is my only torrent... I don't care about attention."
