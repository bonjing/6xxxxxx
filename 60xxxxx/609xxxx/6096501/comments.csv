,tigris667,2011-04-19T03:22Z,"Can anyone confirm subtitles for non-english parts? I briefly checked The Bourne Supremacy movie in this torrent, the bit at the start where it's bad guys talking, there are subtitles just fine, but then the bit about 44 mins in where Bourne is talking German on the phone, no subtitles.... disappointing"

,I_prefer_SO,2011-07-26T10:58Z,It will only take 3 weeks to get this one done... And what is the use of posting to ask for seeds when de people who allready got the files never look back at the comments... Any better ideas?
,I_prefer_SO,2011-07-26T15:34Z,"Im surprized! The download speed went up to 500 kb/s! Excellent quality!

,changeHD,2011-09-05T18:35Z,"Audio not compatible with PS3 or WD HD Media Player. Had to use Handbrake to re-encode which took an additional 6 hours. If you're looking for PS3 or WD TV use for these, don't download. Find another torrent."
,PauloFran,2011-09-09T01:24Z,"Nice video quality.
Good movies - the 3rd one is the best one!"
,sphtc,2011-09-09T04:16Z,"The video resolution is 1280 x 544 @23 fps.
Not technically a 720p video, but still it is A10 v9.9 (v10 if it were indeed 720p as the title says)"
,leodelacruzx,2011-12-26T01:12Z,"@sphtc: Idem, 544 sucks!"
,c_dog03,2012-01-26T05:20Z,"@tigris667:  In the Bourne Supremacy, there are literally only 10 seconds in the movie where they are speaking German without subtitles, but you wouldn't really need them anyway.  There are subtitles everywhere else in the films."
,Cavi Mike,2012-03-04T11:18Z,"I love when someone is speaking a different language the subtitles just say [Russian] instead of what they're actually saying. What dimwitted fool thought that was a good idea? HERP DURR DERP
Thank goodness for subscene."
