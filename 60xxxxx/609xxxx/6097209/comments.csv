,Quinthas,2011-03-06T00:11Z,"I received a threat letter from Comcast for downloading this torrent. I don't know if it has anything to do with the uploader, I hope not I have always trusted VIP scullies..."
,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-30T01:37Z,"yeah audio sucks, especially for a 2.5gig file"

You must have problems with yours ears! :(

This audio is perfect! :) "
,Synther33,2011-09-14T05:05Z,"Worst audio ever.  I've hear better audio when someone holds a mic from tape recorder up to the speakers.  Waste of time downloading this with such horrid audio, especially at this size."
,shatman,2011-10-01T23:39Z,"hmm, audio bitrate appears to be >200Kbps... I will DL and see how it is. Thanks for making an MKV version! Will post review on audio as soon as I finish watching it."
