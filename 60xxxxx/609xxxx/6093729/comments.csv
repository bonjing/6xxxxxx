[V],aoloffline,2011-01-11T03:20Z,"   I'm not saying that there can't be something wrong with this encode,but your 2 software players(nero,and cyberlink) are not the best choices for mkv encodes
  it works with any player that supports cccp & k lite pack,also tested with a portable version of kmplayer and no problems"
,RebelRick,2011-01-11T13:41Z,Thanks for tip on kmplayer.Plays fine with that.
