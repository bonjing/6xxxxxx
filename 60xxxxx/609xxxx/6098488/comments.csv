,iamabigtorrentfan,2011-01-24T07:38Z,Hello. I've always found your uploads to be awesome but I'm having a little problem. Everytime I extract the RAR file I always get a 0kb file. I've redownloaded a few times and I still get the same problem. I use winRAR to extract.
,XONi49,2011-01-25T14:30Z,if you have problems with rar files  get 7zip
