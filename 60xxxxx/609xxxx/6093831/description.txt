Catherine DeSade is terrified of the look of things. It is a dark room with no windows and the man she sees before her is wearing a wicked grin. She wants today to be over. She just wishes this would all end before she cannot take anymore. The torments are not just painful, they make her feel cheap and used. His hands on her make her feel dirty and whenever he hurts her she wants to scream. It is like being between a rock and a hard place. He wants her to call out. She knows it and part of her wants to give him that, just praying that it will make him stop. But she knows that that is just a false hope. Nothing she can do will make him stop.
