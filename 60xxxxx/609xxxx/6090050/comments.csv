,Irishbug,2011-01-19T15:41Z,"moonpeach, thanks for the information. I didnt know it was available as freeware. I hope it works. Also, I have been trying to get this FSX ADDONS for a couple of weeks now, but I am always uploading way more than downloading. If I turn it off for a few hours, then back on, I get awesome download speeds, then it trickles down, and uploading sky rockets. Any ideas why? Thanks again for your efforts Moon."
