ALAC = M4A/M4P (apple's DRM protected version of FLAC)"
[V],peck1234,2011-02-16T11:30Z,"Lossless is lossless...  the beauty of it is that you can convert it to any format you want!  

So you want flac? Just convert it!  I choose ALAC because 90% of people use iTunes.  Its easier to integrate."
,GreedyWesterner,2011-06-11T12:37Z,I'm actually really grateful that you uploaded this in ALAC. Now I don't need to convert it myself.
,Barwa99,2011-07-23T16:37Z,thanx great torrent!!!!!!!!!
,lavandina,2011-10-09T22:36Z,"This is amazing, I'm just starting to upload things in ALAC, it's just easier. Thank you, will seed!"
,RaphSai,2012-01-06T19:33Z,"Yeah, us Mac users don't have WinAmp :( I MISS WINAMP!!! Milkdrop was the best! I have to convert FLAC's to apple lossless (at least I have to figure out how, can I use Toast?) But peck, im DLing right now, but you are missing ""Run Into Flowers"", ""Hurry Up, We're Dreaming"", ""0078h"", and ""America"" to complete the discography. If you uploaded those Apple Lossless style, you would be the M83 CHAMP! Thanks again buddy."
,deplasma,2012-02-01T08:19Z,"RaphSai, I use XLD to convert my FLAC files to mp3/aiff; completely free and it works great!  http://download.cnet.com/X-Lossless-Decoder/3000-2140_4-189505.html"
,KorsK,2012-05-10T18:41Z,"This discography is ridiculously helpful, and I thank you dearly for it. But flac files are like collector's items. I simply must have them. Searching for each album in flac could take forever, and you have them. It's a bit much to ask, but I'd practically cum if you uploaded a flac version of this. 

Thanks anyway"
,-Maxwell-,2012-06-09T11:57Z,Brilliant Upload. Amazing quality!
,LOLSOPA,2012-06-19T22:57Z,"No. Fuck apple and their shitty unnecessary locked down, codecs. 

Flac please. "
