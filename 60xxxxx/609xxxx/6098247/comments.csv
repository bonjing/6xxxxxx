,Shauncold,2011-04-30T02:04Z,I download most (about 90%) of my games from consolasatope and they have all worked fine except 2(tomb raider underworld and socom 4) butm I downloaded this game only to find out that you have to have a board thing that you stand on to play it(should have researched this stupid game before downloading it).
,Fuqthegovt,2011-07-21T22:54Z,"no big deal just buy a used board thing since you can't download objects yet. Alot of games out now also need an eye/move, got one of those used as well."
