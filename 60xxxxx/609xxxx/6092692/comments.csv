,supz,2011-01-10T13:00Z,"Last episode was a double (8 & 9), so this is actually episode 10 (Prod. Code 8ACX10).

Thanks for the upload."
,Nightwolf,2011-01-10T14:06Z,This be S09E08 
,hoffy97,2011-01-10T14:48Z,"Agree, this should be S09E08"
,momo2momo2,2011-01-10T18:52Z,"Confirmed this is S09E08, not S09E09"
,Screamokid,2011-01-10T21:54Z,"It's episode 9, if aired as a two part episode, that would confuse the whole system (Yes, in England, they cut them into two parts -.- they are douche bags here)"
[T],karl2802,2011-01-10T22:34Z,"don't rag us brits. if it wasn't for this shows popularity in the u.k it would never have been rebooted! This is episode 9. the last road to was episodes 7/8. This is 9, simple as that.

,ebud,2011-01-11T04:36Z,"thanks karl for shedding some lights on us dumbarses! :D
thanks EZTV for making my week, as usual!"
,Wheezy,2011-01-11T10:21Z,"@karl2802

I get conflicting results with this page.
http://www.tv.com/family-guy/show/348/episode.html?q=Family%20Guy&tag=search_results;eps;1 
Still says that this is ""New Kidney In Town"" S09E08 and that the next one will be ""The Hand That Rocks The Wheelchair"" S09E09 

Not to mention there have been uploads from others still claiming this as S09E08. I always say that the 45min epps are still one even if they are broken up by the channel. eg: they didn't make SSSDS or Blue Harvest a double epp even though some stations will divide that epp into two, but Stewie Kills Lois and Lois Kills Stewie were meant to be a continued epp therefore they got the titles of S06E04 and S06E05. 

I love your work EZ but i just wish there was a standard naming convention for epps like this one, it makes it very confusing and i now have two versions of S09E08"
,saph27,2011-01-11T10:46Z,wish the entire episode was the same as the first 6 minutes. I hate how they can turn something really funny to something that total crap.
,acroot,2011-01-11T15:15Z,"Thank you EZTV!!!!
But I believe that this is episode 8 (according to a few scrapers)
But none the less, thanks for all your hard work and sharing."
,dogpirata,2011-01-14T22:10Z,Gracias!
,ravi84m,2011-01-21T16:41Z,this is  the kidney episode
,ravi84m,2011-01-21T16:44Z,so the same as this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6092827/Family_Guy_-_S09E08_-_New_Kidney_in_Town
,dlarrym1111,2011-01-28T07:32Z,"my copy has a flaw, the audio isn't synced up with the video. No blame, I could have had some line interference when downloading, but just tossing this info out there. I have never had a bad download from eztv, despite this download, It must be a fluke!"
,Lolrjed,2011-01-30T11:52Z,"This is S09E08.
The wikipedia says that, the imdb says that.
So stfu."
