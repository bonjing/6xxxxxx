You fucking idiot learn to read, ibu7 said he has a mac. How the fuck would he use winRAR without installing a virtual machine?

Maybe he expects the guy to at least know how to do that. Did you ever think of that, retard?"

Why would I need LT+ v1.1 (I have lite on)?

Other games people have also said similar things, yet my LT v1.0 have worked, so can you tell me why I need that, is it special for this game (even though it's from 2010) or do you just assume that, and not know?

Thanks a lot for an answer!"
