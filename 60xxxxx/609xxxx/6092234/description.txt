A middle-class white guy comes to grips with Peak Oil, Climate Change, Mass Extinction, Population Overshoot and the demise of the American lifestyle.

This film CONTAINS THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY EVER FIND IN A DOCUMENTARY! This does not mean it is a pleasant experience. On the contrary, I don't think most people can handle what this move has to say. It is an unflinching look at the dominant culture currently in place on Earth and how we are on a collision course with the destiny of our own making.

This movie is similar to "An Inconvenient Truth" in that it discusses climate change but it also talks about Peak Oil, Population Growth and Mass Extinction. Do you think that this is all bullsh*t? See the movie, read up on the people who were interviewed and what they have to say. Read Ismail by Daniel Quinn, read anything by Derrick Jensen. Make up your own mind, talk to people about what this movie has to say.
