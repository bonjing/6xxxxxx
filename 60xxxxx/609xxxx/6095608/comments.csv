[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-11T15:46Z,Please seed for as long as possible. Let's keep this excellent show alive.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-18T12:00Z,"All episodes are DVDRip. Some of the extras stuff isn't, I got as much stuff as I could and some of it wasn't as high quality as the episodes. You won't find a torrent with more extra's and with higher video or audio quality on the episodes."
,yoohoo420,2011-01-27T09:09Z,"Thanx for the contribution Sniffer!
please be kind and continue to seed. this thing is hyge and with this many leeches seeders are desperately needed."
,yoohoo420,2011-01-28T04:55Z,"the number of seeders way exceed the number of seeders. the number of seeders has not increased comparitive, which means folks are closing torrents as soon as d/l completes.. not wuite the sharing attitude required for such torrents."
,yoohoo420,2011-01-28T05:03Z,for those that i confussed.. my point was that there are a lot of leechers tht are neot seeming to carryon as seeders after their task has finished. This was a great series that was not run long enough. I am glad to see someone went to the efforts to assemble such of a treat for us to relive. Thanks again Sniffer... SEED YALL!
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-29T15:04Z,"Yoohoo, keep up the good work. We're at 90 seeds now. You can be my official spokesman for seeding. See what you can do on the 24 upload. :)"
,pannnos,2011-02-06T04:49Z,seed plz we need higher speeds!!!
[T],Robston,2011-02-23T15:25Z,"Nice torrent, thanks.

I've just uploaded the Disc One set of extras from the Region 1 Complete Series box set, if it proves popular I'll do the rest.

,MrBadung,2011-02-27T15:55Z,Not HD at all.
,Vicotnik,2011-03-03T16:00Z,"Just to let everyone know, the first season was ok, but as i got to the second season, i couldn't find any subtitle matching, except one (the ones meant for SAiNTS rips). "
,mohiergauth,2011-03-05T15:09Z,"HBO doesn't deserve to make another penny from this show, or from the fans. They lied about the fucking 4th season, and they lied about the feature film.

Great show! Awesome show!"
,UncleBeer,2011-03-08T14:16Z,"Still missing audio on Season 1 gag reel.  It was also missing on the YouTube version, so it's fair to guess this is where it came from.   :^ /"
,JCB4CXLWTII,2011-03-08T20:31Z,"Downloading now, if it's good I'll seed at 75 MBs until I get a ratio of about 20

Cheers in advance."
,cldocx,2011-03-30T04:25Z,Fucking assholes seed please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,dinamocy,2011-04-17T01:33Z,"Really a great show but THERE IS NO ENDING !!!

HBO cancelled the show after season 3 leaving it unfinished and allthough there was talk at the time to allow producers to wrap it up they never did, unfinished story, such a shame."
,shifty420,2011-05-11T08:50Z,"thank u very much for this upload, although its taking along time to finish. 4 times as much leechers as seeders. "
,mmedic,2011-05-20T04:58Z,Your math sux
,tdawg2345,2011-05-30T03:08Z,"very slow :(

,ellemarra,2011-06-08T12:31Z,"oh dear
A: 2
V: 2"
,algieba78,2011-06-17T21:53Z,"Great series. Nearly finished watching it from this torrent with no problems.

HOWEVER

Quality not HD AT ALL. The cinematography in this series is excellent and contributes to the atmosphere. You won't be able to enjoy it in this rip. If you have to have xvid dvdrip (i.e. you are watching it on a crappy portable dvd player like me) get this. If not I recommend you get a real HD version."
[T],eXPer1ence,2011-09-09T06:46Z,"Cheers Toilet_sniffer_V

I am going to sample the 1st episode. Its picking up a lot more speed after downloading for a few mins.

Shame its an unfinished story. One day..."
,N3tw0rkbomb3r,2011-10-15T06:47Z,d/l now. Will seed for at least 2 months.
,TmacvsLeBron,2011-11-26T03:20Z,"Quality isn't too bad, not HD quality but it goes alright and audio is fine. Cheers bro its good :)"
,pbr420,2011-12-16T01:32Z,"First off... Thanks for the work putting this together. This is probably one of HBO's best series next to Sapranos... Now to my question:
I have been helping seed this for several months now. My share ratio is 6.24. It would be more but I have discovered that after seeding for a while (I assume until I have uploaded the entire torrent), Bit  Comet automatically closing the connection. Is there anyone that can help me find a setting that allows the transfer to stay open indefinitely? I would be seeding much more if Bit Comet did not stop the upload automatically."
,pbr420,2011-12-16T01:40Z,Never mind my question above. I found the answer. I hope my changes will help everyone out a little.
,RXMR,2012-01-09T06:57Z,"Quality isn't great but, whatever. Problem is season one is missing an episode. There's a gap in between what are labeled e.6 and e.7. It's the episode where the small pox victim that got left for dead and recovers confronts Tolliver. A little lame."
,GOLDENBOYWPG,2012-01-13T05:42Z,Awesome and very groovy. Thanks so much for this.
,bredred,2012-01-23T02:12Z,seed!!!!!!!!
,foxharvey,2012-04-02T01:29Z,seed please!!  i'm dying to watch this series! :)
,MiskyBoyy,2012-04-25T22:55Z,Downloading now & will seed 300kb/sec up until at least 200% Thanks uploader & seeders.
