,virdicyer,2011-01-12T05:40Z,"How do you get it to go full screen?  There's a setting for it, but all it does it maximize, not full screen it."
,Celarion,2011-01-12T06:34Z,"Some people (like me) noticed that when you try to start the game it creates files in windows temp folder and a process stdrt.exe

You can read comments on rlslog.net

Official demo of this game also creates this process and file, so its hard to tell whether its really harmful. Norton deletes it automatically though and sites list it as trojan/backdoor."
,Ic4ruz,2011-01-12T11:27Z,"wow, your an asshole Alex. ""Cracking"" and distrubuting indie games is pathetic"
,PhasmaFelis,2011-01-13T00:10Z,"Yeah, people should definitely buy this one if they like it. There's a solid free demo, and it all goes to feed the indie developers. :)"
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-13T00:46Z,"@ Celarion
HAHA, you just happend to ""notice"" like a disturbance in the force or something? seriously, IF you kept reading, which i doubt, someone says ""even the demo of this game starts the stdrt.exe process""
And BTW, this is a different release group.
This is a release by THETA
they're a clean release group and their releases come up as false positives. Read their NFO. And so if the other version by VANCE was infected, that's their release, not this one. You try to act smart but you arent.

@Ic4ruz
I did not crack it, Liandri from THETA did, as it says in the description. I simply upload theme here. 

and it's like PhasmaFelis says, if you like it, then buy it. but there are many people who cant buy it, even if you can say it's cheap.

Just relax and stop trying to think you know more than you do."
,virdicyer,2011-01-13T01:00Z,Why would I buy it if it can't go fullscreen?
,1TWISTED,2011-01-14T13:33Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,gamer-9955,2011-01-19T17:35Z,"thanks, alex, works great :)"
,mnexusk,2011-03-19T12:14Z,Anukrom yes your right dont download people. 
,nobodyrly,2011-03-25T06:53Z,"This release does contain a legitimate non-false positive virus. the ""this IS a false positive you newfag"" response is the predictable next comment, don't bother.

don't believe either of us. remove them with malwarebytes after installing, and enjoy nightsky."
,Gunzoid,2011-09-01T10:11Z,"yes... NightSky!
this game looks really fun, thank alexisthebest "
,i8YellowSnow,2011-09-07T06:17Z,"The last level ""slightly nonsense"" in Normal Mode doesn't work. the 1st door cannot be opened. It also happens with the VACE release as well. just a heads up. great game anyways."
