Hello everybody!

This one, my second torrent, contains all volumes in the Romantic Violin series from Hyperion label,
except for Vol.8 - Vieuxtemps, which i'll try to get soon from the ed2k network (wish me luck).

All covers and booklets come together, apart, in a single Rared file,
as do every one of the 7 CD's of the series, due to the size issue.

Naturally, this torrent is complete, meaning that nothing is missing
(all tracks, all covers large and small sized, booklets,
some photos of directors and composers, and all CD scans proper).

There's also a small text file (inside the scans rared file)
which contains reviews and track lists, extracted supposedly from the Hyperion web page,
but it's full of badly translated ASCII characters here and there.
I decided to keep it, just to credit the original chinese (?)
uploader who initially shared everything in the ed2k network.

Next torrent (soon) will be The Hyperion Romantic Cello Concerto series,
with the only two first volumes of the series.




These sparkling performances of Saint-SaÃ«ns' violin concertos
are a fitting start to Hyperion's new series of Romantic Violin Concertos;
a follow on from the highly successful Romantic Piano Concerto series.

Saint-SaÃ«ns C Major concerto resembles Mendelssohn's great violin concerto.
Both are declamatory, extravagant in character, highly lyrical
and immediately establish the soloist as a romantic protagonist.

Though more conventional, the violin writing for the Concerto in A Major is ever-inventive,
especially in the witty second episode where the hen from Le Carnaval des Animaux makes a premature entrance.
This was the first of several works he composed for the great Spanish violinist Pablo de Sarasate;
in 1859 just fifteen years old but already a famous virtuoso.
Saint-SaÃ«ns' instantly memorable melodies are a feature of all his best-known works,
and there are tunes in abundance in the well-known B Minor Concerto.
The intense B minor mood probably offered inspiration for the violin concertos of Elgar and BartÃ³k.
