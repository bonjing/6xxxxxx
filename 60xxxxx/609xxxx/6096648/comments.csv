,Greydevil13,2011-01-12T22:44Z,"Thanos is above and beyond one of my all time favorites. The Samaritan series running into Annihilation is great, and Thanos Imperative is just all around ridiculously awesome, unfortunately it was all compressed into a 6-issue run as opposed to the massive epics that compromised the sagas before it. Can't wait for the new Annihilators series, that's a line-up with potential."
