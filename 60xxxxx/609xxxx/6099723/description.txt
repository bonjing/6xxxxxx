[sebaygo1]


Tonight's show will be hosted by Michael Pento with guest James Roberts, the Heritage Foundation's research fellow for economic freedom and growth, on today's annual installment of the Index of Economic Freedom, which this year has America tumbling to 9th place among free economies. 

Later in the show, VÃ©ronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center & columnist for Reason Magazine, will join us to discuss how states are lying through their teeth to keep the muni market propped up.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
