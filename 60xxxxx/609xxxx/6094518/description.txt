IMAGiNE NOTES

AUDIO: The Company Of Men 2011 scr Demedic Thanks Bro... :)

Here we go with another screener for you courtesy of Demedic... Thanks Bro :) It's a very nice looking scr so only a few little things we're done to this source. We first made a small script to crop, resize, sharpened it up some, and then we adjusted the gamma and the brightness a tad as well as the adjusted the rgb colors slightly. The audio is studio 5.1 AC3 :) so all we did was mux that to our encode... :P
