Got a question tho.. Are we allowed to update or register ourselves to cyberlink's site for promtions, etc. by using this cracked version?"
,dicentiu,2011-02-27T19:17Z,"Works great ! Thanks ! 

go in the ""key"" folder, copy the ""Simkey"" file to Cyberlink Power Director install folder. after that, launch Cyberlink PD and enter the key.

Thanks 4 the upload Murlok

,PiraatBae,2011-03-05T06:44Z,"Great upload, easy install and works fine so far.  But like the previous user, I also get the error message:

""CyberLink PowerDirector could not launch CyberLink WaveEditor. Try re-installing the WaveEditor program.""

when trying to edit audio.  WaveEditor comes with this program so I am at a loss as to why it isn't here.  Was this not included in the upload?"
,viewfromhere,2011-03-17T16:39Z,"Thanks for this!   

Can anyone help me find the WaveEditor in this program? 
Thanks!"
,3rdkill,2011-03-17T18:25Z,"How about the other folders? which says part 2, part 3 etc... what is that for? and also the dvd menus?"

[V],Murlok,2011-03-21T07:25Z,WaveEditorn install fine for me.But not know if had that installed before so it only updated. Also try uninstall it and install again.
,bbug,2011-03-27T10:53Z,"Come on, man. No instructions, and multiple parts. How am I supposed to install and crack? Maybe the torrent is good, but u should put some instructions in the nfo file, not some proverbs."
,bbug,2011-03-27T11:28Z,"oops! sorry mate. You will get instructions after you extract any one among four, it's basically the same thing. 

1. Extract the first archive (part 1).

2. After you have extracted, you will get a folder of size 472 MB. Then just run the setup, everything will be installed itself. 

3. Then copy the simkey file to the C:\Program Files\Cyberlink\Powerdirector and replace the existing file. 

4. Then start program, and enter the key.

5. Praise the uploader for his great work.

Once again, apologies for the previous comments, pal. Ur torrent is great."

OK I'm off to install this Plzz Pray that I get it. I just uninstalled the older version of power director.

Work OK on Windows 7 64bits

===About the WAVE EDITOR PROBLEM reported

If the WaveEditor is not installed:

1/ launch the installation of PowerDirector again

2/ after the phase of the files extraction, try to find where the extracted files were written
   (on Windows7 something like: C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\pft****.tmp\

3/ goto the relevant C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\pft****.tmp\WVEditor\ and run the local ""setup.exe""

4/ DO NOT CLOSE the previous run from point 1/, since the second run in point 3/ will use the temporary files created by point 1/ run.
    if you stop it the temporary files will be removed...

5/ When WaveEditor is installed, you can cancel the re-installation of PowerDirector (launched from point 1/)	

As far as I remember that's all.

I guess it's OK for the any installation program you've downloaded, even those including many *.rar files.
Personally I used the re-installation process from torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6037069/CyberLink_powerdirector_9_with_key_by_TheAaax9
(Dont seem to be 64bit version, but I think the WaveEditor is only 32bit anyway...)"

,comefly2,2011-07-05T05:39Z,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I applied the latest update from Cyberlink (up to build 2930) onto this download and the patch and whatnot are still working great! Also, there's a freeware app called PDSpeed out there that makes life with PowerDirector a million times easier - gets rid of annoyances such as the software constantly putting you back into clip mode vs. movie mode. Just Google ""pdspeed powerdirector""

,kiwi_xboxer,2011-07-08T11:36Z,"HEy all ... Thanks sooo much for this great set of editing apps.

Just a quick note to help you chaps and chappettes that are struggling with the DVD_menus navigation.

This is for when you are ready to create your disc!
Simply extract all the DVD files to a folder... then in the create disc menu ... select add template - navigate to your folder you set up (extracted) .... the program will remember this location for all future menus!"
