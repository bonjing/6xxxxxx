These are resources that I have collected over 2 years.  In the audio folder, there are two subfolders named Permaculture - Broadscale Darren D Nov 2009 and Permaculture PDI PDC 2009.  The contents of these two folders are not in the correct order.  When I downloaded them I found that they were mixed together.  After listening to these audio files, I attempted to re-order them, however there is no way for me to know what the original order was.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  Please seed for as long as you can, this is important information for anyone to have.
