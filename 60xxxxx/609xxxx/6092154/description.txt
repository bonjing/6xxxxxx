SUMO Hatsu Basho- Day 01 - Jan 2011 (Xvid-AVI)
Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 01, of the Hatsu Basho.  A welcome visit from the Emperor and Empress make this a special opener! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihito 
File Folder contains;
-	Hatsu.2011.01.E.mpg		Original English broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.01.N.mpg		Original Japanese broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.01.avi		Dual Language *.avi (use VLC media player for best results)
-	Hatsu.2011.01.docx		this description, in a document
-	Torrent downloaded from Dem*noid.com.txt		advertising!

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).
