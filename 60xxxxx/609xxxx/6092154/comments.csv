How to get the 15 files to fit on 4 DVDs:
=========================

1) Download ""Avidemux""
2) Open any of the dual audio .avi files that downloaded. It will tell you that it contains dual audio, hit ok.
3) Goto audio > main track, select the first option (track 0) which usually is the english audio
4) File > Save > Save Video to save the new file

You will need to do this for every 2 out of 4 files to get it small enough to fit on 1 DVD. 

Hope this helps others who wanted to fit 4 per DVD like I did."

is also a very useful FREE tool (i use it to convert from MPG to AVI)

Keep seeding as long as possible!  eventually the 15 days will be divided by the 100mb/s my ISP provides me!  be NICE!"
