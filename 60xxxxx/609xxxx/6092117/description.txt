IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: Tangled file from a friend... Thanks Mate... :)
AUDIO: Tangled audio from our TS release Thanks LU Mate... :)
Here we are with what we believe to be a Telecine of Tangled... ;):P There are a few tell tell places that you will see in this that give it away. Some may say it is a cam but we do not think so, you will see certain areas we're it looks as if the plates got shifted by accident while copying. Also you will see faint dust particals and scratch marks. Take it as you will as it is very watchable. Now the video we did our normal things to it of white balance, gamma, sat, and rgb color adjustments as well as a slight sharpening filter The audio is from our TS release thanks to LU. It was just a matter of syncing the audio and muxing it to the video.
