SUMO Hatsu Basho- Day 02 â€“ Jan 2011 (Xvid-AVI)
Welcome Back Sumo Fans.  Here is day 02, of the Hatsu Basho
File Folder contains;
-	Hatsu.2011.02.E.mpg		Original English broadcast *.mpg
-	Hatsu.2011.02.N.Light.mpg	Sorry Fans--- the original was lost, thanks to my stupid cable company changing the operation of my PVRâ€¦ GRRR!
-	Hatsu.2011.02.E.avi		This oneâ€™s English only for todayâ€¦ see above.
-	Hatsu.2011.02.docx			this description, in a document

Choose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).
