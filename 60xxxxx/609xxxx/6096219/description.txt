NOTE: This album was remastered and rereleased on CD, but the only review I can find says: "It's good to have this available again, but there are no pauses whatsoever between the tracks. They are indexed separately, but when you play the disk, they sound like one long piece with very disconcerting changes of gear. Some tracks don'e even sound as if they've finished before the next one starts. This is really not good enough these days." source:

A thing or two about quality: This rip (not mine) is fairly clear sounding (very few crackles/snaps) albeit, you CAN hear a ~60Hz hum, especially on the less loud tracks when using headphones. I decided against taking it out as it is practically unnoticeable when you play it over loudspeakers, and I am generally against sticking my fingers in the mix. All in all, considering you are listening to a 40 years old vinyl, the sound is pretty great.

About FLAC image/ CUE sheet / butthurt because you dont have separate tracks: read this before raging ->
