,Jamrd,2011-03-11T15:52Z," - It seems as though the torrents aren't being very well seeded and due to the fact I've found where Gamestar is posting direct DL links to the same files I'm re-downloading the torrent to get all the files in the same place, hence to give a boost to seeding.

- Gamestar has reported that part 4 of his incredible encoded work will be up in the next week or so as he has yet to purchase part 4.

- Don't forget to thank Gamestar, especially as he may read this post at some point. As he suggests and I quote;

""It Takes 3 Hours To Encode and Upload A Single Episode. It Only Takes A few Seconds to Say THANK YOU.
I Put a lot of Time into the Encode So a Simple THANK YOU Goes A Long Way. Enjoy The Encode"" - Gamestar"

,mini1guy,2011-03-30T13:38Z,"Hey everyone, I have a very important announcement,
apparently the guy who made the original dragon ball z kai is plagiarizing dragon ball z, now from what i read they are going to stop production of the dragon ball z kai series, ending with the Japanese episode 97, but I don't know if they will keep dubbing episodes into English or not."
,go-naz,2011-04-10T14:45Z,thanks again gamestar! loving this jizz
