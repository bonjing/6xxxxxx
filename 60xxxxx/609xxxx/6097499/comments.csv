,Campbellsville,2011-01-19T07:41Z,Same problem here...no file input
,campbeln,2011-01-19T13:04Z,"This isn't rendering correctly under XBMC (Ubuntu 10.10 on an Acer Revo 1600). the 1280x528 is being scaled to 1279x720 no matter what the hell I do!? Anyone have a fix?

An MP4 1080p of The A-Team is similarly cropped (1280x5??) and it's not being scaled, so maybe it's an MKV container issue?"
,amartya61,2011-01-22T16:55Z,i also agree wid hotshotvegetarian ! it shows somethin like no input.....
