Angels - Good or Evil?

Winged messengers have mesmerized humans since the dawn of civilization. Isis, Hermes, Mercury, and Asmodeus set the stage for monotheism's angels--Gabriel, Michael, and Satan. Hebraic, Christian, and Muslim scripture all describe angels and demons that were invoked in magic spells, immortalized in art, trivialized as decorative accessories, and dismissed by science. We see how their legacies shaped religion and art and hear from those who testify to firsthand encounters with these curious creatures.
