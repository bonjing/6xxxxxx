,davidramozaku,2011-01-18T01:04Z,"When I patch everything and try to get into a game it says CD Key is invalid and I used the one that is given, any solutions to get rid of this?"
,mauch129Eiffel,2011-02-11T06:51Z,"OK, so, all you need to do is:

1.Use daemon tools to mount HALO.bwt.bwi (you need to put it to all files)
2.Install Halo PC
3.Use the serial, XBQDX-GRKCB-KQVMV-WRR9P-F2CBJ
4.Go to the halo PC directory (first move the patch that came with the torrent to the directory)
and start the patch
5. Unmount Halo PC
6.Run Halo PC (it will say no-cd inserted)
7.Update Halo PC with the haloupdate.exe that came with the game
8.Run halo PC and you can join servers!

NOTE:It may say INVALID CD KEY when you try joining a server but that means someone has the same CD key as you."
,SkinnyBay,2011-02-17T07:25Z,"YOU WILL WANT TO RUN THE PATCH RIGHT AFTER YOU INSTALL
YOU WILL WANT TO RUN THE PATCH RIGHT AFTER YOU INSTALL
YOU WILL WANT TO RUN THE PATCH RIGHT AFTER YOU INSTALL

THEN RUN THE GAME AND RUN PATCH AGAIN"
