,NarutoUzumaki,2011-01-15T17:03Z,@Leechless: This is the Japan Game and works on ALL wii regions
,NarutoUzumaki,2011-01-15T17:05Z,Japan. But work on all wii regions

,Leechless,2011-01-20T07:19Z,"Thanks for the info, might be useful to add some kind of notification for region limitations to make sure you don't get comments from noob downloaders who don't know how to check comments. Download speed is going great so far, getting 200 KB/S until 10% so far, hopefully this continues. Another simple question, although I probably already know the answer, this is the Japanese game, which means the game is in Japanese, but Gekitou Ninja Taisen means Clash of Ninja right? So is there a difference between this series and the Clash of Ninja series, or is it just English/Japanese translations because Naruto Shippuden: Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 is the newest Clash of Ninja and Naruto Shippuden: Gekitou Ninja Taisen Special is the newest Gekitou Ninja Taisen but they were released in different years.
Sorry for my confusion, never touched a Naruto game in my life. Seen nearly every episode from the Original, and Shippuden series so far, so a head-to-head combat game is sounding pretty attractive.
Again, thanks, sorry for the trouble."

It doesn't matter what region it is, if you have a modded wii, you should have regionlock off. Secondly, the speed is good until roughly 15.8%, or at least it was for me. As for the question, ""Gekitou Ninja Taisen"" translates, roughly, to ""Ultimate Ninja Battle"", however, the games are the same. And Naruto Shippuuden Clash of Ninja Revolution 3 came out in a different year because it's a different game, this is techinically Naruto Shippuuden Clash of Ninja Revolution 4, but they renamed it ""Special"", it hasn't been released anywhere, but Japan, yet.
