"The Sonnets are as important a part of Shakespeare's lecacy as his Plays. They are filled with thoughts and emotions all of us can recognize: desire, disappointment, jealousy, love, and forgiveness. To speak his Sonnets, Shakespeare created a character, a Poet, who gives voice to the feelings and observations reflected in each poem. We thought it appropriate to gather together a group of actors who could bring this Poet to life. We have set out t read the Sonnets in Shakespeare's language, in such a manner that allows the relevancy and originality of each poem to shine through." From the Introduction to the Complete Shakespeare Sonnets, Kathleen Turner.
