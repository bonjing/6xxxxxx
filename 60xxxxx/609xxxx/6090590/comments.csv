even today this ""evidence"" circulates throughout the theaters and internet and schools.
They still cant give any evidence.
So they repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat....
and people will take it as evidence since they heard it over and over again."

,69fizzle,2011-05-15T17:26Z,"No, static is right, where is the forensic evidence of gas chambers for example?cyanide residue doesn't just wash away in the rain, the room where they used cyanide to kill lice on clothes was full of residue measured at deadly amounts even 60 years later, but in the ""gas chambers"" there is no residue, according to numerous samplings by various museums, which were kept secret."
,cranyonrye,2011-06-05T18:27Z,Thanks for the upload and shame on the crazy Holocaust deniers and conspiracy theorists.
,huma1122,2011-07-11T00:28Z,"In response to people like 69fizzle and static84 who are most likely Neo-Nazis
There would not be any residue of cyanide in the gas chambers because they used Zyclon B crystals to kill them. Also, how do you explain away the stories of the thousands of people with the numbers still tattooed into their forearm? Or the huge number of concentration camps in Poland? Why did they have fake showers next to huge open burning pits? If you actually went to one of those concentration camps which I know neither one of you have you can still find piece of unburnt bones littered on the ground. Lastly, where is YOUR PROOF that it was all just some big conspiracy?"

This is totally wrong.

Cyanide is completely miscible with water (i.e. cyanide and water can form a solution when mixed in ANY proportion).

If cyanide is soluble in water then it WILL wash away in the rain.

Please don't spew out BS about chemistry when you don't know anything about chemistry."
,phencyclidine55,2012-02-04T08:33Z,"""the room where they used cyanide to kill lice on clothes was full of residue measured at deadly amounts even 60 years later""

Can you cite a reference for this claim? Presumably this means that a peer-reviewed publication published these findings sometime after 2002, so how about citing your source?

""but in the ""gas chambers"" there is no residue, according to numerous samplings by various museums, which were kept secret.""

But apparently they aren't secret anymore, if you know about them, right? I call BS on this, however. There wouldn't be any need to keep such a thing secret. It wouldn't surprise me if cyanide wouldn't be detectable after a few weeks, given its solubility in water.

Do a little reading on the chemistry of cyanide. Once again: it is totally soluble in water."
,phencyclidine55,2012-02-04T08:46Z,"One last thing: 
not only is cyanide (Zyklon B contained hydrogen cyanide) completely miscible with water, but it is also highly volatile. Volatile, to a chemist, doesn't mean that it explodes: it means that it has a high vapour pressure. In other words, even below the boiling point of cyanide, much of it evaporates.

Furthermore, the boiling point of hydrogen cyanide is a little below 26 C, meaning that room temperature is close to its boiling point. A volatile substance close to its boiling point will evaporate very quickly. Ever seen diethyl ether?

Cyanide wouldn't have been useful as a poison gas if it wasn't volatile. It it didn't evaporate, then nobody would have died inhaling it.

If you pour hydrogen cyandide into a glass of water and smell the water, then you could easily die.

Your ""evidence"" that the Holocaust was a hoax is based on the ridiculous expectation that cyanide - a highly volatile substance with a boiling point of around 26 Celsius at STP - was not found in the gas chambers?  I've never heard of a gas that suddenly stops being a gas just because."
