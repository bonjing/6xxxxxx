,criti,2011-01-23T19:06Z,Excuse me. Don't you have a map of North America 2GB?

,crossfire6,2011-07-05T00:29Z,"Unfortunately did not work for my XXL 550.  Even following the instructions TomTom Home identifies it as an ""invalid map"".  It does ""appear"" at first to have installed correctly.  You get start up screen, you can put in new favorites and destinations - but then it won't actually plot the route for you when you tell it to take you there.  Simply keeps recycling ""planning route"" over and over again, and frequently loses satellite, which is something the unit never did with the original map installed.
Also, it won't let you operate the unit from TTH, which you need to do to set a 4 digit security code.  Instead, says, ""invalid map on this device.""

Thanks for the up, anyway.  It was a good try for me.  I hope that someone else has better luck with it."
,MxLuvr,2011-07-14T08:37Z,"A word of caution for anyone d/ling these maps: they will likely not work for you. You're taking a huge gamble trying to install sporadic maps you find on torrents. For instance this batch here requires firmware (navcore) 9, when a lot of GPS run on 8, such as the Go 630, 730, etc. Trying to upgrade the navcore in order to run these maps is a bad idea.

There is a procedure to do this. The instructions here are at best crude. The poster that brought us these maps are not doing anyone a favour as so many users here already pointed out, it's sure to fail in most cases. 

Best to inform yourself first of what's involved and what you're getting into and finding a way out of trouble, when it does happen. A great source for info and maps is gpsunderground.com. I don't work for them or have any affiliation, I just happen to see a lot of people blindly installing the wrong stuff on their GPS and render them useless.

Where posters sharing files is great, there are times when certain files should not be shared. This is one of those cases. "
