Any help to find the subtitles , please write in this comments the link once getted them . Thank you ."
[S],velvet.,2011-01-11T05:39Z,Enjoy your green skull.
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T05:42Z,"IT IS NEVER TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IS ABOUT 50 TO 100 CRAP TORRENTS FOR THIS MOVIE AROUND THE NET WITH BULLSHIT OR CODEC STUFF TO DOWNLOAD SOMEWHERE , SO GETTING THE PICTURE AND THE FEELING OF THE MOVIE WAITING FOR THE SUBTITLES SOON AS POSSIBLE IS NOT BAD AS THAT !!! THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTAND ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T05:56Z,"To the moderator Velvet : i donÂ´t have words to say how much happy i feel with the color of the new skull and if for one side that means an appreciation for my effort keeping nice files coming to this site , for other side simply improves my responsability too , in doing the possible work , better and better and that is also true , from myself to all the possible users that already knows me , i like to have the conscience better as possible about the work of my files and i can guarantee that it is true , the search for the best possible to get on the worked file is a quality that i have the intention to keep more as possible . 

Thank you again to the moderator and the users can expect the best work possible and i think this only increase my responsability in a positive way , so my conscience trying to keep the good work donÂ´t change because the change of the color of the skull besides of course i am very happy with that because i really think in my efforts when doing the files with the best respect to the users making them better as possible under the circunstances , thank you to the moderator and to all of you for liking my files .

I repeat about this file : no english subtitles for the moment but the picture is ok with the audio in russian , any help with subtitles if someone find them will be nice ."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T06:04Z,"Another shot to get the subtitles is that someone that knows russian do the subtitles and upload them somewhere , who knows ? if i find them in sometime somewhere i will put them as update , i hope the users that find them do the same ."
,Helmet507,2011-01-11T06:17Z,why does this noob have a green skull. falsified the first upload to bring us this. i demand justice!
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T07:06Z,"To Helmet507 : come on ! you have to recognise that i respected and i assumed my mistake in a respectfull way to the users and after that i give my best shot to compensate everyone for the lapse , and i certainly in all this years that i am uploading always searched for nice files that can possible interest to the users , what i mean is that is a constant good intention keeping working nice files having the conscience of what can be the correct competent work , i said to the users of the 1972 file by mistake that if they tought that delete the file was correct i did it but for otherwise i understand too for the constant avolumate of possible users that in a certain way they simply didnÂ´t getted complete frustrated with the 1972 and besides the lapse they still downloading and helping more and more with me always suggesting that if they donÂ´t want to help or go away that i understanded that beside the lapse on the file name , i get too confident when i getted the file and i did it the clean work with the dub but without the perception that was the 1972 and well i uploaded and after 10 minutes or something i started to watch and it was then that i realise that i was uploading the 1972 and not the 2011 and then i runned to the comments explaining everything better as possible but already with the file with lot of users then i wait a while to see the reaction that i certainly understanded and not only happening anything about a decrease of users or something but also improved more and more and then it wasnÂ´t fair privating the users from a Dub clean work for that movie beside the lapse on the name of course , it was without intention and you can believe me on that .

Cheers . "

[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T07:49Z,"To dieselv : no problem , you need the freeware FREEARC then choosing to make compression and select 1 gb ram on the decompression , the new freearc have a 2gb ram option for decompression too but that is not really recommendable because not ok for many 2gb ram users or for a 4 gb ram that gets confident and have more applications running at the same time then can happen interference on the compression work with you thinking that everything is ok , but my friendly user for general compressions , 7zip it is also valid depending on the files that what you want to compress have , so do 2 compressions one with arc and another with your best possible shot with 7zip , you cant push the ram to do Â´the work more than you really have or the computer got a breakdown ununexpectdly , to decompress the 7zip is needed generaly less ram than the arc but for some specific kind of files the arc can get better compression , so it is up to you to analise that and choose what program for the compression ."
[H],HeroMaster,2011-01-11T10:09Z,"The language is russian, need Engish, globe thanks for your effort dude."
[V],globeplus,2011-01-11T10:37Z,"To Hero no 1 : that is exactly what i think , but what a movie ... and what a nice quality picture that i getted with the dub plugins , that it is really the only thing missing but with more than 50 crap files for this movie and not a single one ok and lot of online offers that are probably bullshit or bad quality , having this file on this scenario certainly can´t look bad . Thank you and enjoy , you get the feeling of the action beside the fact that you are not understanding the voices ."

Um i could not find any subs but i found that if you download 
Season Of The Witch CAM XViD - IMAGiNE 
You could replace the Russian audio with the imagine audio and it works pretty good the Russian video syncs pretty good with the imagine audio but the imagine audio is not that good of quality. But it works"

[V],globeplus,2011-01-13T00:25Z,"To Milafettel : thank you for your suggestion , i am analising the possibility of that but of course that the audio still need to start at the same point than the video if it is a different cam , i will check possibilitys , the question is : in case of sucess , upload this movie again with english audio ? Thank you for opinions ."
