,Tyraan,2011-01-10T07:40Z,"I get the same as holloow, 2 mins of gameplay and then a msg about the gamefiles being altered. then booted to desktop."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-10T08:13Z,"Yea, they need to re release it with a working crack."
,Digger77,2011-01-12T20:44Z,so you basicly tell me you have posted a torrent WITHOUT EVEN CHECKING if it work?? Geee THX!
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-13T01:07Z,"@Digger77
obviously i'm not gonna play the entire game before uploading..."
,c624,2011-01-15T00:43Z,Obviously you should at least check to make sure your cracks actually work before uploading.
,Digger77,2011-01-15T19:12Z,no one ask you to play the whole game. the error pops up after about 40 seconds. 40 seconds were still too much for you...? this would spare many peoples time and instead - they've got butt-fucked.
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-18T23:52Z,"as the other people said

2 minutes in.

i made sure it ran and was able to start playing. in that time, i didnt get kicked out.

again, i'm not gonna play the entire game, which is what you are implying.

This release was not and to my knowledge, as not been announced as bad, even tho it seems to be.

so dont say to make sure the crack works before uploading if that's what i did and had no problems when i did."
,LjupChe,2011-01-20T11:23Z,2 minutes of play thats all. don't download.
,joannie17248,2011-01-22T14:23Z,same here couple of minutes of play and then crashes. Shame looks a good game.
,nightobreed,2011-01-23T11:38Z,Anyone know were to find a working patch ??????
,Jettert,2011-01-24T20:08Z,"Are you kidding me? 2 minutes is too much for you to play? I'll make sure not to waste my time downloading anything by you, because I'll probably get screwed again."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-26T21:25Z,"@Jettert

As i said, i made sure it ran and the game seemd fine. I'm not gonna play the entire game to see if something is wrong so top complaining. That's fine if you dont download from me, maybe next time you'll be smart and read the comments...




as for anyone else who wants to play this game.
I'm going to upload a version NOT by TE and uses a keygen rather than a crack so it'll work.

and just so Jettert doesnt complain again, i played for who knows how long to finish the first stage. and again, i found nothing wrong from the time i tested it.

seriously...people just need to relax and maybe be smart and read the comments.

To those who are disappointed this didn't work and DIDN'T whine about ""testing"" it: sorry about that."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-27T08:42Z,"here's a working version of the game. it uses a keygen rather than a crack so there are no issues.

,FilipaNP,2011-01-28T02:46Z,"You are all retards! You don't pay for this...alexisthebest is doing you a favor, why should he continue to play the game if he started it and it looked good? but still you come here and make stupid comments....just say it doesn't work so he knows! Ignorants!"
