             multiple users to work with one computer as easily           
             as if each had a single personal computer.

             Due to the presence of multiple versions of programs         
             designed for different numbers of additional jobs,

             The program runs stably with a standard set of office,       
             accounting and training programs, graphics applications,     
             and even networked games.                                    
                                                                          
             In order to organize each job to the computer connects
