Hey there, 

This is my first post so please don't give me any nasty comments about how this is already on the http://lessonsland.com/joomla-course.html website.

I have downloaded these videos so that you can view them at anytime on your pc without having to visit the website when you want to check something out.

I've also included a Joomla for Dummies pdf file if you get bored of the videos, cant find what you are looking for on the tutorial videos or just prefer reading.

This is not a .exe file like what you would have found out there. All files are in .avi format with the exception of the pdf file of course.

I hope you guys enjoy.




ps. if i am not seeding please do not remove the torrent... i may disconnect at times to download stuff or play games online and the torrent uploading will not let me do this properly. (i don't have a very fast internet connection to do both simultaneously)
