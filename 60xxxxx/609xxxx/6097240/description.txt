CHANGELOG: 

[B] Changes for 1.5.19 [/ b] 

1. Fixed: Russian language introduced by 1.5.17 

2. Fixed: HD audio HDMI passthrough 

Changes for 1.5.17 

1. Fixed: Fixed: Folder or files with some characters are not shown. 

Changes for 1.5.16 

1. Fixed: Occasional file corruption after copying files from PC to TVIX through USB. 

2. Fixed: Cannot change the partition when copying files using the function key due to navigation buttons removed. 

Changes for 1.5.11 

1. Better support for EXIF rotation information in Jpeg files 

2. Change back to old icon size (200 * 200) for normal and Album Jacket mode (We referred to the 1.5.10 feedback, which all preferred 200x200 size rather than new 120x120 size. 

   Video folder icon size will remain as previous version 1.5.10 which is 138x186) 

3. The play button is the default button on the synopsis page. (Remote controller focus will be on PLAY button not BACK button) 

4. Now, the icon mode change with FUNCTION key on the remote works on text mode folders. (It worked only when all the three mode was text mode in 1.5.10) 

5. More Video cover folders are added. If a name of folder, which on the root folder, is starts with one of below words (case insensitive), it will shows Video cover art mode instead a normal icon mode. 

            - "Video", "movie", "dvd", "bluray", "blu-ray", "film", "cinema", animation "," drama "," miniseries "," tv series "," music video " 

6. Rearrange the file list page for some severe over scan displays. Depends on the display, there could be still be some hiding at the edges. 

Changes since 1.5.10 

1) DTV 
1. Now color space option is available just like file player. 
2. Some UI bug has been fixed. 
3. Fixed: In some case, TVIX reboot when DTV stops. 

2) Player 
1. Audio playlist now supports up to 8192 files. 
2. Navigation UI Enhanced. (Not supported on UPnP) 

A. The disc navigation removed from the top of the list UI. To navigate to USB, Network, UPnP, a user need to press GOTO key while you browse, then the navigation popup will be shown. 

B. Users can select TEXT or more graphical interface mode for each of Video, Audio and Photo on the Setup-Misc. (You can still set icon mode using Function key in Text mode.) For Audio and Photo folders, album art and thumbnail mode will behave similar to the Icon mode and the Thumbnail mode of our old firmware, But for video, Cover art mode behaves differently from older firmware. Other then video folders behave differently. 

For Audio, 
1. Any folders named 'Audio', 'Automp3' and 'Music' (case insensitive) under the root folder will be shown as an icon mode (9 columns x 4 rows) with the icon size 120 * 120 (pixels) so if the folder . jpg (Folder.jpg, folder.png) size is 120 * 120, the icon will be shown without scale. 
(Coincidently, Windows Media Player save the covers as Folder.jpg) 

2. The folder which has no subfolder will be shown as list mode, so users can see file names easily. (Background image is the tvix.jpg on the folder, background image may differ in actual firmware, please replace with your choice of preference) 

3. Now, jpg files which start with 'albumart' ('albumartxxxx ~ xxx.jpg) will not be shown on the list. 
However, these will be shown as an icon when you press INFO button while you play music. 
If you have many albumartxxx ~ xxxx.jpg files in your folder, these files will be shown sequentially in time. 

For Photo, 
1. Any folders named 'Photo' or 'Picture' on the root folder will be shown as Thumbnail UI (9 columns x 4 rows). 

For Video, 

1. Any folders named 'Video', 'DVD' and 'Bluray' under the root folder will be shown as a Cover art mode (8 columns x 3 rows). The size of the icon is 138x186 pixels.

Changes from 1.3.129 

This is a beta version which supports Universal Jukebox (including BDMV structure) function. The beta version of TVIX software is not fully tested and supported when you have a problem. If you are interest in this new function with possible bugs, feel free to download and try. As you know, you can go back to the original firmware anytime you want. 

1. The main feature of this firmware is to select a certain audio track or subtitle out of several sorts of those when playing HDMV structured files stored in the HDD. 

2. This version of firmware doesn't support all functions of 'BDMV' folder, especially the files with profile 1.1 and 2.0 due to the limitation of the hardware. 

3. The folder structure should be the same as the original one, otherwise TViX doesn't playback your HDMV files properly, protected files and the files with HDMV region code either. 

4. The 'Popup Menu' when pressing the 'Menu' button of the remote control while watching HDMV files is either original graphic menu that the title supports or simple menu that Dvico made. 

5. There are two ways to playback HDMV files 

A. In case that you set the 'Smart Navigation' to 'Smart' in the TViX Setup Page, HDMV files automatically playback with selecting the main folder. 

B. In case that you set the 'Smart Navigation' to 'Normal' in the TViX Setup Page, you need to select 'index.bdmv' files in the HDMV folder. 

6. Possible to add the subtitle that HDMV files doesn't't have. 

A. If you want this additional subtitle to be default one, put the file on the same folder index.bdmv located and name must be 'index.xxx', for example, index.smi. 

B. Possible to change to the additional subtitle while watching by using the 'Function' button on the remote control. 

7. To change a subtitle language to another one while watching, either press the 'Menu' button or the 'Subtitle' button on the remote control. 

8. To change audio track, press the 'Audio' button on the remote control. 

9. To go to another chapter, press '| â—€ â—€' or 'â–¶ â–¶ |' on the remote control or you can press 'Go to' key on the remote. 

10. You can use 100 times this version of firmware. The TViX automatically counts down from 100, but it counts one in spite of playing HDMV files 10 times unless you boot the TViX. 

*** Possible to play HDMV structured files compressed by ISO format, but you've got to select the file even if setting the 'Smart Navigation' to 'Smart'. 

Setting the UJukebox Mode in the TViX Setup Page. 

1. Set to the 'Lite'. 

Dvico simple menu pops up always. 

2. Set to the 'Basic' 

The original graphic menu appears that the title supports. And Dvico simple menu pops up in case of the HDMV files with the menu TVIX don't support. 

HDMV files in IFO folder structure and ISO files. 

Most HDMV files stored in IFO folder structure mainly consist of 'BDMV' and 'Certificate' folder. As explained above, there are two ways to playback the HDMV files, Smart Navigation and selecting index.bdmv. For stable performance, we recommend not to change the folder structure. 

Files in ISO format must be selected to be played even if setting 'Smart Navigation' to 'Smart'. ISO files may playback smoothly when played through the network.
