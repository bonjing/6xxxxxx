The band, consisting of Jason Aalon Butler (vocals), Jean Nascimento (guitar), Ryan Jay Johnson (bass), Jeff Sahyoun (guitar), Anthony Rivera (drums) formed out of the ashes of Westchester hardcore band Fubar in 1999. In 2004, under At One Records, they released their first album, Exhaustion, Salt Water, and Everything in Between. Some time after the albums release the band underwent a change in line up, with only vocalist front man Jason Aalon Butler remaining today from the bands original lineup.
