,moknat,2011-01-17T09:10Z,I have uploaded 10Gb of this can someone else start seeding back please
,moknat,2011-01-19T14:00Z,"uploaded 22gb going to seed for 1 more day then im done, someone get generous please"
,twitty,2011-01-19T19:49Z,Well I've upped 74GB which doesn't really matter a whole lot as one of the pieces (#1223 to be exact) you're seeding fails the hash check so everyone is stuck at 99.9%.
,moknat,2011-01-19T22:45Z,how do i fix that
,twitty,2011-01-19T23:06Z,"I assumed it'd be a .rar archive but as it's individual .avi files it doesn't really matter, might be some corruption in one or a few of the files causing the media player used to crash but it can just be skipped by if it happens.
Nothing you can fix without creating a new torrent really."
,twitty,2011-01-19T23:18Z,"The missing bit is only in E13 which seems to play fine in MPC at least, so it shouldn't be a problem."
,moknat,2011-01-20T12:06Z,"Cheers, sorry guys.... very very new to this so working on it... "
,nikins11,2011-04-01T09:49Z,"bloody hell, i have been trying to download for 2 weeks and i've been at 99% for 1.5.  If you don't plan to seed, don't leeeccchhh"
,twitty,2011-04-21T01:06Z,nikins11 perhaps you should bother to read the previous comments before you post your own.
