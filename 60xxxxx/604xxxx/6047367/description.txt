Skye's just had lunch with Alex's wife, who suggested that she stop by her house, and borrow a dress for a big dinner she's going to. Telling her she'd leave it out for her to find, Skye let's herself into the house to grab it, having no idea that her friends husband is actually home. She finds the dress in the bedroom, and attempts to sneak in and grab it without waking the guy up, which he does. After introductions and an explanation, Alex suggests she try the dress on, and be sure it fits before leaving. In no time things get a little touchy feely, and before she knows it Skye is borrowing a dress and her friends man, just for the day of course.
