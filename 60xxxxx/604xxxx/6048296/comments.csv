,irikimoss,2011-05-14T14:45Z,"While the quality is impressive for a 700mb file, there are some quite visible artifacts throughout the movie, namely 6:19 where the shape of a man appears, among others you'll quiet easily find. 

Too bad, will have to download another release :/"

@irikimoss, the artifacts were part of the movie.. 
If you actually just got at least half way through the movie you would of understood why these artifacts were included. They were not put in by the uploader, it is just all part of the movie."

,mhisrad,2011-10-14T00:41Z,"Those are not ""Visual Artifacts"" They are intentionally put in by the producers of this movie, even the original VHS has them, they are there to better display his mental condition, and is also explained later, when Tyler splices in pornographic segments into childrens movies at the theatre he works at, which is exactly what they do in the begginning"

But M is....2-3 at most, as the whole movie can be described a summary of violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity....As a result, it's prizeless. "

But do not think your shriveled brain has the authority to deem this beautiful movie to made of 

""violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity"" 

your ignorance does not do you well."
