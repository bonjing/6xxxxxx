Color Of The Cross(2006)

This powerful, epic film vividly portrays the last 48 hours of the life of Jesus Christ and challenges commonly held assumptions about him. With moving performances from Jean-Claude LaMarre (Malcolm X) and Debbi Morgan (Woman Thou Art Loosed), this stirring film is a triumph!

The first depiction of Jesus as a black man, Color Of The Cross is also the first to suggest that the Crucifixion could have been racially motivated. A compelling script and astounding interpretations of the Bible make this daring masterpiece an achievement not to be missed. With its inspiring, unconventional approach to an emotionally volatile issue, Color of the Cross presents a fresh perspective on the history of Christianity and delivers as moving a portrait of his life as has ever been put to film!

Color Of The Cross 2: The Resurrection(2008)

From director Jean Claude LaMarre (Color of the Cross) comes another epic film about the ministry of Jesus Christ. This daring film portrays the resurrection of Jesus Christ and his ministry after his death. After the crucifixion of Jesus the disciples go into hiding believing their lives are in danger. They have lost all hope that Jesus would come back to them as He had prophesied.

This film was created with the same enthusiasm and astonishing interpretations as Color of the Cross The Resurrection brings a new perspective of the resurrection and ascension of Christ.
