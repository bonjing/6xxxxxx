,Duder82,2010-12-16T19:28Z,"Thanks, these are the best."
,TrekComp,2010-12-20T04:34Z,"@meech
You you awesome quality torrents. I created an account just to say keep up the good work and please finish out Voyager. I am in the middle of watching your SG-1 torrents right now. I would love to see the SG Atlantis next. there is no good torrents for it ATM.
Thanks."
[V],meech,2010-12-20T14:14Z,"I will definitely be finishing off Star Trek Voyager.  I already finished ripping and encoding season 3.  I just have to rip and add the subtitles.

It seems enough people are interested in SG Atlantis and it was a great show.  So I will definitely put it on the list.  However, I have already started ripping Quantum Leap, so I'm going to post that after Voyager...and then will work on Atlantis."
,ipimen,2010-12-20T22:32Z,"Like TrekComp, I just created an account to say THANKS! for Star Trek, Farcape y OMG Quantum Leap!!"
,TrekComp,2010-12-21T17:03Z,Awesome! I love Quantum Leap. I have watched that series a few times. It has been awhile and I am sure yours will be better quality so I will grab it when it becomes available. I will be anxiously awaiting SGA!
,RogueLeader72,2010-12-23T03:15Z,"Thanks for all of Star Trek uploads, Meech! Greatly appreciated! :) 

Could some people please seed this? I've been downloading with an average of 1.8/kb for 24 hours. "
,dukeofurl,2011-01-23T09:54Z,"Oh don't cry about it, for me only season 2 is also moving at about 1 K/s for about a week now.  But eventually it will be done."
,dukeofurl,2011-02-02T12:03Z,"Ok, it's my turn to cry about it.  Season 2 has been going at about 7 k/s for a while, and I can't figure out why."
[V],meech,2011-02-02T16:41Z,Not sure what's going on with your speed...why this one would be slower than the rest.  Most of the same trackers are included.  I just tried downloading to see what speed I would get and I get around 130kbs - 170kbs.
,AmazingPirate,2011-05-15T06:11Z,Thanks! Now on to the 3rd season...
,SwedishMeatball,2011-10-17T17:31Z,"Meech: 
Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Trek attitude says to give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
,JamJulLison,2012-04-07T17:04Z,"From what I can tell from the size it looks to be as good of quality as the first season which was great quality.  Though the download is slow as hell.  Only 1 of the trackers seem to be working. Though I have noticed this with other torrents on here as well recently.  I hope the speed picks up soon though, it is only downloading at 1kbs to 50kbs.  I rarely have any torrents go this slow. Though a few others have been slow today too that I tried. Last night on one of my downloads I was averaging 250kbs to 300kbs."
