,vivatpb5776,2011-08-07T13:12Z,Audio and video quality on par with other DVDRips. There does appear to be some graininess but that does not take away from the overall video quality. Because of the small screen resolution (608*336) I would not recommend streaming this to a larger HDTV. Thank you uploader.
