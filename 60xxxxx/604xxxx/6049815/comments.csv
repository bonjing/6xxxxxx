Movie is no more than 5/10 - Dan shits at your background."

,Gugalioth,2010-12-20T18:55Z,So stoked that you've made this available for us! Thanks. I'll seed this for a while.
,Rizolto,2010-12-22T11:49Z,"@Tribaljester8

There is big fat ""How do I download text on the start page "" and google, learn to read."
,Maliketh25,2010-12-22T21:21Z,"wow for people like me who read alot of warhammer 40k novels, and know pretty much everything about the Imperial fist's ultramarine branch of the imperium, this movie is like a slap to the face. thanks to the uploader, but wow this is a piece of shit movie. It's not even close to the actual ultramarines of the Imperial Fist's in the codex astartes. "
,Maliketh25,2010-12-22T21:25Z,"and wow, dan abnett has nothing to do with the ultramarines, Graham Mcneil was the creator of the ultramarines"
,Maliketh25,2010-12-22T21:27Z,I guess I'll seed it though
,simmo0916,2010-12-25T22:02Z,"Malekith25... if you really are so knowledgeable about the Warhammer World... Why do you keep referencing the Ultramarines with the Imperial Fists??? They are two seperate chapters...

This movie is a fairly decent attempt to portray the 40k universe - it's pretty faithful in fact. It may not be the best movie, but if it attracts more people to the hobby, I'm happy! Good torrent btw! :)"
,AdMech,2010-12-26T01:59Z,"I'm with you Sim.  Anyone who has played 40k in its minutest form knows Ultrasmurfs come from Rowboat Gulliman and Imperial Fist come from Regal Dorn?  Mal go hop back on your fantasy emoelves and stay the fuck out of 40k, it's apparently beyond you."
,madlulz,2010-12-28T04:57Z,Fuck all you UM pussies.  Iron Snakes... For Ithaka!
,lazza666,2011-01-03T16:01Z,Thank you 
,poopoo7,2011-02-13T22:51Z,dark eldar?
,Dithrick,2011-05-15T06:49Z,At least the action was good and I believe its the first EVER movie to be officially endorsed by Games Workshop.
,gesmana,2011-05-19T18:21Z,"I would encourage everyone to check this project out:

,47kittens,2011-06-09T23:00Z,"I think Maliketh meant ""or"" instead of ""of"". I've only watched the first 10 minutes so far, but both Space Marine chapters are present. I'm not a massive fan of Ultramarines, but I do love that Apothecary already :)"
,47kittens,2011-06-10T00:07Z,"And done. First 30-30 minutes were shit then it got good, then it ended abruptly. Lloyd was right. 5/10."
,NimbleJack3,2011-08-08T10:30Z,"Great movie - a WH40K action thriller.

Audio is good up until the last 10min, where vocals become grainy and indistinct.
Video has slightly too much gamma, but is consistent and watchable."
,NimbleJack3,2011-08-08T10:36Z,Ignore my comment on the loss of vocals - it turned out to be a problem on my end.
,gazgull,2011-10-11T09:45Z,"Not a fan of the ultrasmurfs or the Iron Fists chapters, but its not to bad of a movie considering its there first attempt at it. Hopefully they will consider using a different CGI company when, and if they decide to make another movie.

Iron Within Iron Without"
,gazgull,2011-10-11T09:47Z,Correction Imperial Fists
[T],ServiusTheBear,2012-01-13T19:32Z,"Not to bad a movie.

A = 9
V = 8"
