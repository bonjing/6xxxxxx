Rot & Ruin  Jonathan Maberry

Multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author Jonathan Maberryâ€™s Rot & Ruin is his debut work for young readers. Fifteen-year-old Benny Imura lives in a world infested with zombies where, when a kid turns 15, he must get a job to continue receiving food rations. Benny has no interest in the family business of zombie killing, but figures he doesnâ€™t have much of a choice. Heâ€™s tried out a bunch of other jobs, and hasnâ€™t found
anything he likes. But as Benny starts training with his brother, he learns things about being human that he never expected.
