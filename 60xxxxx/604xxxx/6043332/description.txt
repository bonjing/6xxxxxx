Ramonas World â€“ Beverly Cleary

Ramona Quimby is back! Beverly Clearyâ€™s best-loved and most exuberant character has been winning friends since the 1950s when she made her first appearance as Beezusâ€™s pesky little sister. Now, in Clearyâ€™s first Ramona book in 15 years, our beloved spitfire is 9 years old, and she fully intends to make fourth grade the best year of her life. Even with her spelling struggles, a new baby sister, and a fall through her best friendâ€™s ceiling, her wish seems to be coming true. Old friends Yard Ape and Howie are still aroundâ€“and with her new best friend Daisy, Ramona is on top of her world!
