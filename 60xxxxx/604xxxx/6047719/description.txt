The highly anticipated original motion picture score for TRON: Legacy, composed and produced 
by the iconic and critically acclaimed GrammyÂ® Awardâ€“winning French duo Daft Punk, will be 
released by Walt Disney Records on Tuesday, December 7, 2010. Presented in Disney Digital 3Dâ„¢, 
Walt Disney Picturesâ€™ â€œTRON: Legacyâ€ hits U.S. theaters on December 17, 2010, 
in Disney Digital 3Dâ„¢ and IMAXÂ® 3D.

Having grown up with admiration of Disneyâ€™s groundbreaking original 1982 film â€œTRON,â€ Daft Punk 
took on the scoring of the next chapter of the story with extraordinary thought and precision. 
The duo assembled a symphony of one hundred world class musicians in London and recorded the 
orchestra at AIR Lyndhurst Studios, Britainâ€™s premier scoring facility.

From Daft Punkâ€™s first single release in 1993, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter were 
hailed as a new breed of electronic music innovators. Following their seminal debut in 1997 (Homework), 
the band went on to release two more studio albums (Discovery-2001, Human After All-2005) and two live 
albums (Alive 1997, Alive 2007), winning them both critical and popular acclaim throughout the world. 
Daft Punk are known as much for their music and technical innovation as their groundbreaking and elaborate 
visual universe, which centers around their irrepressible and mysterious Robot personas. In 2006, their 
directorial art house film debut, â€œDaft Punkâ€™s Electroma,â€ premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and in 2007 
they toured internationally with a jaw-dropping live show that was an awe-inspiring combination of their musical 
and visual prowess. Their collaboration with Kanye West on his #1 hit single â€œStrongerâ€ was hailed as â€œThe Song 
of the Yearâ€ by SPIN Magazine (January 2008 issue), which also saw Daft sharing the cover with Kanye, having been 
awarded â€œTour of the Yearâ€ by the magazine. Daft Punk performed with West on the Grammy Awards in 2008, marking 
the mercurial duoâ€™s first and only television appearance anywhere in the world. â€œTRON: Legacyâ€ will mark Daft Punkâ€™s 
first film score.

From the albumâ€™s liner notes, director Joseph Kosinski commented on his first meeting with Daft Punk in November of 
2007: â€œI sat down not knowing what to expect, and I was immediately struck by their deep knowledge and love of film 
and particularly the sanctity in which they held Steven Lisbergerâ€™s TRON. It quickly became clear to me that this had 
the potential to be an exciting collaboration. With topics that ranged from Bernard Hermann to Wendy Carlos, the 
discussion revealed a shared desire to create a score that blended classic orchestral themes with an electronic 
minimalism in a way that had never been done before. The result has truly exceeded my high expectations. Because the 
score was developed in parallel with the production of the film, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to live with it for over a 
year now and it never fails to thrill and inspire me as we near the finish line.â€

â€œTRON: Legacyâ€ is a 3D high-tech adventure set in a digital world thatâ€™s unlike anything ever captured on the big screen. 
Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund), a rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious disappearance of his father Kevin Flynn 
(OscarÂ®- and Golden GlobeÂ®-winner Jeff Bridges), a man once known as the worldâ€™s leading video-game developer. When Sam 
investigates a strange signal sent from the old Flynnâ€™s Arcadeâ€”a signal that could only come from his fatherâ€”he finds himself 
pulled into a digital world where Kevin has been trapped for 20 years. With the help of the fearless warrior Quorra 
(Olivia Wilde), father and son embark on a life-and-death journey across a visually-stunning cyber universeâ€”a universe 
created by Kevin himself that has become far more advanced with never-before-imagined vehicles, weapons, landscapes and a 
ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their escape. Visit the official site for more info at http://disney.
