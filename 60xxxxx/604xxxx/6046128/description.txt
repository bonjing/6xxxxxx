Lucy Montgomery's Variety Pack is a sketch show packed with characters performed by Lucy Montgomery and others. 

Daisy and Maisie are every parent's nightmare. They are two sound-a-like public school girls who specialise in not doing what adults want them to do, intent on their own very important personal agenda, discussing the ins and outs of the Twilight movies.

Candi Karmel is an 80-year-old woman who just can't stop performing. She is still singing out the show tunes despite her advancing age and a voicebox that is shot to pieces. Wendy, the Jilted Bride has been planning her wedding ever since she got her first Barbie doll - now, she has been stood up at the altar. Despite crying hysterically she remains undeterred and delivers her wedding speech to a room full of her wedding guests. 

Tim Vincent's mum just mentions her famous son to find herself showered with gifts and free from trouble. 

And finally, the Dog Therapist who can talk to animals but only to tell their poor unfortunate owners that the animal in question hates them.
