,ePyrate,2010-12-20T20:12Z,"@catshit - While your working on your self-esteem issues, which most likely stem from your daddy putting his cock in your mouth for many years, why don't you look at the publisher and developer on simmarket. ""Publisher: Aircraft Factory, HOMEPAGE: a2asimulations.com""

Next time you open your mouth pull dady's cock out of it."
,1sh1g4mi,2011-01-02T01:43Z,"Aircraft Factory is a subsidiary of A2A Simulation.
They create cost effective aircraft that lack for example AccuSim or a sophisticated failure system.
By no means are their aircraft bad.

Thanks for the upload.

Any chance you could get your hands on the recently released Heinkel He-219 â€œOwlâ€ by Aircraft Factory?
It is a refurbished FSX version of A2As â€œOwlâ€ for FS9."
