:::::[ PLOT SUMMARY ]:::::

In a casual conversation during a banquet, the Sanno-kai crime
group chairman expresses to right-hand man Kato his displeasure
for the Ikemoto clan's connection to the Murase crew. To not
violate the pact of brotherhood with the Murases, Ikemoto
(Kunimura Jun) asks Otomo, the head of another Sanno-kai clan, to
stir up trouble in the name of peace. This triggers a bloody gang
war filled with ulterior motives, double crosses, and a long, long
path of blood.
