The Hamsters, a blues-rock power trio based in the United Kingdom, are a very
talented, tight, and well balanced band.

The guitar playing is excellent, as are the vocals. They do some songwriting,
but their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations
of early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.
