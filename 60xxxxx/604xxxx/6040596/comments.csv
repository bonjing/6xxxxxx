,Vfdn,2010-12-15T21:38Z,Torrent was seeding last night but isn't seeding again for some reason. Will fix it asap.
,Vfdn,2010-12-15T23:12Z,THE TORRENT IS WORKING! After considerable work convincing Vuze that I already had all the content and not to try to download I am now seeding the torrent. I will seed 24/7 if possible and will try to get other people to seed too if they can (using a memory stick to transfer all files to them so they don't have to torrent files first).

,BladeRunner12,2011-07-22T02:15Z,"Thank you very much, Vfdn! :)"
,NeverPool,2011-10-19T00:05Z,Not very good seeding speed... I'll seed 300% when I finish downloading.
,MrDenimLP,2012-04-12T02:29Z,"We need more seeders! Mine's going at less than 30 KB! And that's bad even though my usual max is around 30. I know, my computer sucks."
