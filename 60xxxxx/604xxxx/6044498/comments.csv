,Killjoy88,2010-12-16T14:22Z,"Hello Twentyforty.

I realise that requests are on hold. However, I was wondering whether you might be prepared to do 'Green Lantern - First Flight' for me.

There are some high quality rips available but i cannot afford the file size.

Please know that whether it is uploaded tomorrow or in a months time, it does not matter. I would just like to add this to my collection. 

Many thanks.

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-16T16:37Z,"@Killjoy88: I forgot to ask: 480p 500MB or 720p 700MB. It could be 352p or 272p but it's heresy to rip BluRay in extra small format ( and gains in size are to small - maybe 150MB). So,choose."
,htctouch,2010-12-16T17:53Z,ok sir
