Amazon Description:
2009 holiday release from the leader of Boyzone. Following the success of Ronan Keating's international #1 album Songs For My Mother released earlier this year, Ronan has recorded another special set of songs entitled Winter Songs. Teaming up again with Songs For My Mother producer Steve Lipson, Ronan has pulled together a set of 11 songs that evoke special memories of winter and Christmas for him. Winter Songs is a mix of traditional and modern festive classics, including tracks from artists such as Simon & Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell and Grammy Award winning Sugarland. Along with these, Ronan has also included the poignant Christmas Hymn `Silent Night' and the beautiful `Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'. The album also includes two brand new Ronan songs: `Its Only Christmas' and `Scars'. Polydor.
