,Shoobox,2011-05-01T15:25Z,"wrong any problems my ass!
this piece of shit doesn't install when mounted to any mounting tool, i've tried 3 different ones."
,raafaa,2011-05-20T09:21Z,pls seed^^
,Redfren,2011-05-31T11:51Z,"I was able to get this to work just fine, I'll continue to seed it for a little while, However the crack gave me more problems then it was worth so I just downloaded a no/cd crack and it worked just fine. if your using D-lite give the iso some time to load up it takes a minute but well worth the wait.. 
Thanks much Erato99"
,XRuneX,2011-07-04T13:34Z,"After the crack the game still asks for serial code

the crack file is the same size as the real file... (FAKE CRACK???)"
,ReallyBadNightmare,2011-12-19T12:50Z,Crack added a really nasty virus. Had to reinstall the whole computer.
,VegitoDBZ,2011-12-28T17:24Z,"Your mom is  a virus. This is clean, game is fun, althought i find voices so bad in 1.0 version. Patches fix that, although, so not much of a problem. But what really pissed me off is the fact that you can't move the camera. seriously wtf, every space game i played had that basic option. Torrent is sweet."
,mjgamer,2012-05-17T23:10Z,I copied the crack onto the folder correctly after burning but the game won't even start at all even when I try running as Admin.
,darkonealex,2012-05-20T15:41Z,"mounted with daemon tools,wont install. also 'skidrow.dll' is a virus acording to security essentials"
,Memmybobo,2012-05-21T16:38Z,"First off, thank you Skidrow for cracking it, false positive for a trojan in the SKIDROW.dll but no actual Trojan.

Now about the game, this game is the worst piece of garbage ever made. Don't waste your bandwith. I'm a huge fan of the nearly extinct space sim video game branch and this is its most lackluster and pathetic spawn ever. 

the game is half finished in everyway but just know this : it's planar, 2-dimensional with a 3d look to it that's just visual. "
