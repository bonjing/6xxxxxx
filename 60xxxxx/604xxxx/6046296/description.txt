At first look, this compilation probably seems like another "greatest hits" CD. After all, the record companies have released at least two Queensryche greatest hits CD's plus a box set. Queensryche fans already own all the songs on the first cd, so it wouldn't make sense to buy this disc in the single disc format that is available unless you are new to the band. The second disc is the gem. Queensryche has compiled a bunch of demos and other limited released stuff on one CD. I am sure that the band did this for just the hard core Queensryche fans who have been waiting for unreleased material for quite sometime. The first three songs on disc two are demos from the band Myth which was pre-Queensryche. It is so great to be able to hear classic Queensryche sound that was never released. Although the titles to these songs appear on later QUeensryche albums, the Myth demos are completely different from what ended up on the official album releases. Some of the other material on disc 2 has appeared in some shape or form on other releases, such as Imports and re-released albums, but it is nice to have them all in one place. No more searching through ebay for rare singles and imports to obtain just one song. I would recommend the double disc to all Queensryche fans. I wonder if the band has held back anything else for future release?
