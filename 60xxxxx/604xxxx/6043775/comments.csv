[V],Iznogoud9,2010-12-16T08:29Z,"I'm a little low on bandwidth right now, but I am seeding. When my other torrent gets other seeders, I'll concentrate on seeding only this one."
[V],Iznogoud9,2010-12-16T09:45Z,"I changed the seeding rule to normal seeding, since superseeding in Vuze seems to upload bits in order from the beginning. It occurred to me that some of you might want to grab episodes one at the time out of order. And in superseeding no individual episodes would be available until all the bits are well seeded, which could take a couple of weeks with my upload speed."
[V],Iznogoud9,2010-12-17T08:30Z,"From now on, I can upload about 8 Gigabytes a day of this torrent. I'm planning to leave my computer on during my Xmas vacation trip, so if there won't be any power outages here, this should be seeded non-stop until next year."
,Spree2009,2010-12-25T02:43Z,"For the love of god somebody seed
am here downloading at 1.0-5.5kb/s "
[V],Iznogoud9,2010-12-25T07:51Z,"As I said, I'm not at home but I left my computer seeding. There was a fire in the house next door a couple of days ago and it's possible that it cut off the power or my internet connection. Can anyone confirm if there's still a seeder?"
,freakyleon,2010-12-25T15:49Z,"no seeders :(
downloading at 0.1kb/s"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-27T07:52Z,"If you can't wait for the uploader of this torrent to get back from his holiday, you can use this one.

Lost all seasons in HD from DVD rips plus all additional special extra episodes, mobisodes, deleted scenes, everything you could hope for."
[V],Iznogoud9,2011-01-03T14:16Z,"Okay, now I'm seeding again..."
[V],Iznogoud9,2011-01-08T08:50Z,"There's a couple if typos in the episode titles: S01E13 is 'Hearts and Minds' and S01E19 is 'Deus Ex Machina'. If you're as anal retentive as I am, you might wanna correct them. ;-)"

,odus123,2011-10-09T08:10Z,"i dont get it...I have almost always had at least a 1.2 mb/s download speed. I dont think my computer is THAT much faster than other ones, nor my internet.  But, alas, I musnt complain.  I shall seed for a long while to help you other slow dudes hehe."
