A radio comedy aptly described as "a gloriously daft Victorian romp in the style of Charles Dickens after too much gin".

The sitcom follows the remarkable adventures of young Sir Philip 'Pip' Bin as he struggles to rescue himself and his sisters from the schemes of his evil and ironically-named guardian Mr Gently Benevolent.
