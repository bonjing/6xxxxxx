I mean really, when you have to have talking heads claim things like ""one time"" I heard a guy say that they were surprised that the afgans would be upset over a dead family member....what kind of cartoonish argument is that, let alone one you have to fill your documentary with.  Do you really lack substantive material to that degree that you have to have talking heads put up cartoonish strawmen?  Most of this was insulting to anyone with any intelligence, it was down right patronizing.

It was context-free and guilty of its own charges, just with a different bias, that is the problem.  Every time they claimed to be telling you a hidden truth they committed sins of omission for the purpose of bias, total hypocrisy. the  left is guilty of using a moralistic tone when in fact the agenda and only moral principle that seems to apply is being against being in war.  hundreds of thousands..millions die in places like the congo, but you don't see that either. out of sight, out of mind. rwanda? out of sight, out of mind, hands not dirty, and so we remain morally superior and pat ourselves on the back for our noble
tears over the genocide.

So it is, yet another one-sided bash documentary.  A clip here or there of western troops being rough, no context given, and not even an acknowledgement that those they fight behave FAR FAR worse. They show a clip from the gunship, no context, no mention that the entire situation was different and that watching the rest of the footage would bring more light on the matter, they just would rather let you draw the wrong conclusion because it is convenient to their argument.  Total hypocrisy when the documentary claims to be concerned with the whole truth. Just the standard hour and a half of moral relativism I've come to expect from some folks.

Every time this documentary claimed to be telling you something the other side didn't mention, it does the same itself, it fails to mention the wider context or arguments against that position as well, a sliver of evidence without the whole truth in order to mislead based on a biased agenda.  Total hypocrisy in a documentary, quite sad."
