,DoodleBop,2010-12-18T10:06Z,Thanks !
,Nickyboy7,2010-12-18T18:10Z,"You are the best uploader of paranormal shows, no question about it. You don't get enough thanks around here for your awesome work. 

You upload shows the same day they air and in good quality. Before you came around we were lucky if we got any Ghost adventures, people like Puma done their best and done a good job. But you have made sure that we get the shows EVERY week and as fast as humanly possible.

You are the best. And you deserve more credit around here from the thousands of people who download your stuff."

No *Trusted* status yet?"
,freakn_style,2010-12-19T00:13Z,"As ""Nickyboy7"" said man, thanks a lot for all the ghost adventures uploads, you've been pretty much my sole source for the show for season 4. thanks for all the hard work :) "

Puma is awesome, but this past year it seemed the stuff u/l'd by puma was not a standard h.263 format or the video size would be a super small 512x288.

Anybody know what happened to OMiCRON and why they discontinued Ghost Hunters in the middle of the season?  That's kind of the only reason I started uploading is because Ghost Hunters was no longer becoming available.  Then it lead to Destination Truth, then Ghost Adventures, and then Ghost Lab, too.  

I knew I couldn't have been the only fan of those shows.

I don't know about ""thousands"" downloading from me, but surely a couple hundred maybe.  

Thank you all again.

Oh yeah, I don't want a pink skull.  I want a blue or black one, but they don't offer those.  No matter, I've been verified and marked trusted on other torrent sites. "

Puma is awesome, I've downloaded tons of GH from him/her in the past, but this year it seemed the stuff u/l'd by puma was not a standard h.263 format or the video size would be a super small 512x288.

[T],trialNerror,2010-12-19T00:34Z,"This computer I'm on now at someone elses house is REALLY slow - google toolbars and all that junk crammed into IE8 and I'm not allowed to 'modify' anything, grrr - so if there ends up being multiple copies of my comments, sorry!  

It's just that when I hit ""Submit"" nothing seems to happen, but now noticed the # of comments going up... 

Still don't see my posted comments, though, so really don't know what the deal is."
