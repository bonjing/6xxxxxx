ENGLISH SUBTITLES INCLUDED

French filmmaker FranÃ§ois Ozon has taken a couple of odd turns lately: â€˜Angelâ€™ was an English-language, period literary adaptation, while â€˜Rickyâ€™, which was never released here, was a grim slice of realism mixed with fantasy in which a baby grows wings and flies around a housing estate. It was daring but disastrous.

The 42-year-old Parisianâ€™s latest returns him to safer and more familiar territory. Like â€˜Under the Sandâ€™, â€˜5x2â€™ and â€˜Time to Leaveâ€™ before it, â€˜Le Refugeâ€™ is an intimate contemporary drama that plays out on bourgeois, metropolitan terrain and concerns itself with examining one or two people and their relationship to love or death. Itâ€™s blessed with a mesmerising performance from Isabelle CarrÃ© who was six or seven months pregnant for most of the shoot and appears in nearly every scene. Itâ€™s short and even slight, more of an observational short story of a film than a rich novel, but itâ€™s entrancing and moving nonetheless.

We begin in Paris, but soon, as so often with Ozonâ€™s films, find ourselves dragged willingly to the sea. Mousse (CarrÃ©) and Louis (Melvil Poupaud) are heroin addicts, and Ozon invites us to share the piercing of their arms and necks â€“ as a director, Ozon worships bodies â€“ before tragedy strikes and Mousse is left alone and pregnant. An awkward encounter with Louisâ€™s haughty mother informs her choice to leave Paris for the coast, where she borrows a house. Soon sheâ€™s joined by Louisâ€™s brother Paul (Louis-Ronan Choisy), himself more of an exile from his background than he seems.

Most of the film chronicles the short period of time â€“ a week, maybe two â€“ that Mousse and Paul spend together in this house. Their interests collide, as when they go to a beach or a club together, and diverge, as when Paul stumbles into a local affair or Mousse encounters strangers with differing attitudes to pregnancy, such as the lecturing woman on the beach or the warm seducer in a bar. Partly, you feel that Ozon just wants to portray a pregnancy up close â€“ and the shots of CarrÃ© on the beach or in the bath are fascinating for their uniqueness: itâ€™s refreshing not to watch an actress with a pillow stuffed up her jumper. But weâ€™re also gently reminded that this is the pregnancy of someone who is an addict, who is without a partner and who is in the throes of grief, even if none of those are always apparent.

As such, most of â€˜Le Refugeâ€™ unfolds in an ethereal sort of limbo space â€“ something of which weâ€™re sharply reminded by a brief, Parisian epilogue that will no doubt have audiences debating its credibility and its rights and wrongs.
