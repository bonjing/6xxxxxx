,cakeisgd,2011-01-25T02:28Z,"None yet. and seeing as you can import from 2nd G into this one, i am guessing you will be able to import unite"
,zallidis,2011-02-13T06:33Z,i downloaded it fine but where is the iso at? p.s this is the first time i download a file like this.
,cakeisgd,2011-02-16T08:28Z,"Well, in the downloaded folder, there should be 2 files. A readme and the MHP3 ISO file."
,undefined2010,2011-04-06T03:33Z,"Why is it is says ""Game cannot be started?""
Is this copy a clean one/ untouched? Tnx"
,cakeisgd,2011-07-30T06:50Z,Yeah it is clean/untouched
,XXD1XX,2012-05-18T11:39Z,"You guys are better off downloading this clean ISO and patching it yourselves (by making a copy first so you still have a clean ISO for further patches)

Google Team Maverick One for the patcher"
