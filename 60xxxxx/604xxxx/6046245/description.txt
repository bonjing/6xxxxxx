In Obsidian, you're cast as Lilah Kerlin, a scientific engineer who, with your associate (and significant other?) Max Powers, has launched Ceres, an Earth-orbiting satellite that uses patented "nanotechnology" to help rescue the increasingly moribund atmosphere surrounding Earth 2066 AD. The two go on a hiking trip, only to discover a mysterious chunk of black, shiny rock, which grows several feet daily. By the time you enter the game, this rock - dubbed Obsidian by the unsuspecting campers - has formed an enormous tower. After a little investigation, you find that Max has been sucked into the tower, and as you approach the nefarious mass, you too are abducted, becoming a prisoner of Obsidian.
