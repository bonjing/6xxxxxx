/me is going christmas day to see in 3d wooot"
,SSfrostic,2010-12-23T01:13Z,i meant to say uncompressed cam
,Riddle13,2010-12-25T10:40Z,"Its a screen rip not from DVD, though not surprising considering the movie. I just wish people would properly label their movies so that when I search for a format I can get that format... "
,Raven1972,2010-12-25T17:25Z,"Why would anyone want to create an 4.31gb file from a CAM...Are you retarded? 
Keep the DVDR Section for what its supposed to be ....copies of DVD's in iso format preferably..."
,john336699,2011-01-10T05:33Z,Another false DVDR. I hate these ppl. Stop lying already!
,doozergreengrass,2011-01-10T15:03Z,yeah improperly labelling torents or deliberately putting torrents in the wrong section is b/s. If its listed in DVDR it should be DVDR not something else. This file size is HUGE if its not a DVDR why is it so big??!!! To trick people into thinking it really is a DVDR of course...fk that.
,deejis,2011-02-09T23:29Z,"You idiots he isn't lying. TS stands for Telesync, i.e. a recorded version from the movies. It is in the title!"
