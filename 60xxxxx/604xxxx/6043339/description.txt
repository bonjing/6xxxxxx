This program used to be hosted on a popular ebook device discussion site but was taken down due to possible GPL violations.

Seeing as how both the PRS-500 and PRS-505 versions of the Sony Reader are terrible at rendering PDF files, this program is a must-have if you need to convert a PDF to a LRF (there is no better program out there to do this).

This is version 0.99 of the software, which has a GUI interface instead of the command-line of older versions.

Until this essential program can be hosted safely again, please make sure to seed as long as possible for fellow Sony Reader users.

Enjoy!
