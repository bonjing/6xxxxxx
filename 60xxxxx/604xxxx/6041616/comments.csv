,mandog,2010-12-15T13:02Z,Its a shame you don't take the time to rip this to 24/96 so we can all share what you are hearing in your music room. It does not do these recordings any justice in CD quality? Thats why you listen to your LP collection.
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-15T17:14Z,"mandog,  It's not about taking the time it's about incurring the expense.  I never claimed this to be the ""Holy Grail"" of Sinatra.  Remember, stay focussed,  this is a place to acquire free music.  If you don't want it.... move on.

You asked the question:

""It does not do these recordings any justice in cd quality?""

Come on, really?   Do I have to explain the merits of vinyl, irregardless of sample rate, to someone who supposedly owns +/-$100,000 worth of all the latest and greatest from ML and SME?  Now THAT would be a shame......

,mandog,2010-12-15T17:40Z,you should be able to record direct to your h/disc using software free from here then save as 24/96 flac not hard to do really! but you don't have to that's your choice entirety up to you. But others take the time so that people can hear the music as they do not restricted by bandwith and it does merit the effort as the music sounds that much better to a lot of peoples ears not only mine.  Anyway I won't bother you again 
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-15T18:29Z,"It's no bother Mandawg, really.
No question about the sample rate....  However, my computer is nowhere near my Hi Fi nor would I want it to be, sorry.

Hey, why don't you give us a peek into that grand rig of yours and post some Mandawg vinyl?  SME's flagship offering...... wow.  Let me guess V-12 arm and Koetsu Blue Lace Onyx Platinum cart?

[T],rjordan21,2010-12-30T14:16Z,"LetLive, you are so very welcome.  If you liked this you should download disc 2 from the Boxset Vegas.  You can get it at TPB here:

It's a show recorded a few months earlier and, for me, so much better.  ENJOY!"
,jamesisin,2011-01-06T23:15Z,For what it's worth I'll be avoiding your rips precisely because they are only 16x44.  For vinyl rips I prefer 20x48 minimum.
[T],rjordan21,2011-01-11T04:39Z,"^^^^ ""For what it's worth"", anyone interested in sample rate alone doesn't understand the merits of vinyl over cd.  "
,BeatleTom,2011-04-20T23:08Z,"Hi Rjordan,

Thanks for the great vinyl Frank Sinatra.  Fabulous sound on this one.  

The other comments are laughable.

Beatle Tom"
,Hummiel,2011-09-04T20:02Z,"Oh boy thank you so much, this is one of the best Live of sinatra's albums for me, even better on vinyl."
[T],kimeesteres,2011-09-18T00:09Z,"Thank you so much for the referral to the Vegas Box Set torrent! I let the seeder know that you sent me. :)

BTW, I don't what dickhole keeps giving your torrents excessive negative quality votes, but whoever he/she is, he/she needs to stop trolling good seeders, and seek out a real life. "
