,rakiem,2010-12-18T13:32Z,eagerly  waiting for children of men ..thanks in advance:)
,tylr,2010-12-18T20:56Z,"i hope children of men is  similar to chocolate in size......

~craZy chick, i guess.. nice fightin movie man THANKS!!"
,puppyup,2010-12-18T22:57Z,Quality would be much better for 480p. File size is too small for 720p. There are lots of blurry areas and artefacts.
,tylr,2010-12-19T06:11Z,"^^^ tats one vital point, plZ. do 480p rather than a 720p"
,kanha,2010-12-19T10:14Z,"thnx for this, waiting for children of men...."
,MuhammadSaber,2010-12-19T14:16Z,"Quality is great considering the size
MKV is a miracle
720p is good on LED 20""
thank you "

,qazwsxijn,2011-07-25T04:02Z,"Video quality is surprisingly good for the size, but still noticeably inferior to larger rips.

Audio, however, is terrible. That's what happens when you encode at 64kbps. The audio quality made this unwatchable for me.

I really think if you bumped up the audio bitrate to 128kbps you could have a nifty little package here that would still weigh in under 700MB. Consider it for next time, and thank you for the effort."
,s_t_o_r_m,2011-08-04T18:16Z,"Awful, awful audio quality."
