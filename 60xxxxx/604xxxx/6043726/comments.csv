Is better to me and for the users to choose what screensaver download viewing the picture in the torrent post. "
,Daefook,2010-12-20T20:42Z,I've especially registered on here today just to say what a total prick you are Mr.Screensaver! I have to go through many pages just to get past the complete crap you are uploading... Just fuck off!
,Daefook,2010-12-20T20:45Z,...and you're on demonoid also (my other favourite torrent site) - what a total wanker!!!!!
