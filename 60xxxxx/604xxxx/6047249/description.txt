Norah Jones The Fall (Deluxe live bonus tracks)(mp3 320kbs)ICM369
_________________________________________________________________

Import two CD edition includes a bonus CD containing six live tracks.

The Fall is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Norah Jones, 
released November 17, 2009 on Blue Note Records.

Norah has taken a new direction on the The Fall, experimenting with different 
sounds and a new set of collaborators, including Jacquire King, a noted producer 
and engineer who has worked with Kings of Leon, Tom Waits, and Modest Mouse 
among others. 

Jones enlisted several songwriting collaborators, including Ryan Adams and 
Okkervil Riverâ€™s Will Sheff, as well as her frequent partner Jesse Harris. 

Jones also put together a new group of musicians to perform on the album, including 
drummers Joey Waronker (Beck, R.E.M.) and James Gadson (Bill Withers), keyboardist 
James Poyser (Erykah Badu, Al Green), and guitarists Marc Ribot (Tom Waits, 
Elvis Costello) and Smokey Hormel (Johnny Cash, Joe Strummer).

Norah Jones always seemed almost unfairly equipped to survive the inexorable 
attrition that mows down legions of her fellow female singer-songwriters: young 
(23 at the release of her 2002 debut, Come Away With Me), beautiful, possessed of a 
lovely husky drawl and an appealingly picturesque back-story (Ravi Shankar is by now 
resigned to being recalled principally as Jonesâ€™ father, rather than as the worldâ€™s 
best-known sitarist). 

Jones didnâ€™t merely survive, of course â€“ her three albums to date have shifted 36 
million copies. In todayâ€™s climate, that seems as miraculous and unfathomable as a 
seeing someone walking a brachiosaurus.
