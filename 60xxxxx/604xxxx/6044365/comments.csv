Thanks in advance !!!

I am not going to be a sycophant but people compare you with RiddlerA, although he hails from the same nation as mine, his rips might be ""slightly"" better than yours(people's opinion) but everyone should know that you are way way more organised than he is. You take much more requests than he does which makes you extra special than anyone i have come across. I am not taking any credit away from him either but people should not ""compare"". Neither will i after this.
Just wanted to appreciate your work which you deserve.
You rock!!"
