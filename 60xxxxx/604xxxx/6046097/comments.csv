When I tried to open regular .doc files it crashed and recovered, eventhough when I opened office from the programs list it all went fine.

Either this torrent is fuxed, or 2010 is crap compared to 2007. I installed 2007 and saved me a lot of headaches, though I lost precious time cause of this.

Recommendation: Stick to 2007; don't download this one."
