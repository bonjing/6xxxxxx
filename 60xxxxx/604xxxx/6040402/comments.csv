,tversitykraked,2010-12-15T00:11Z,"a few users have reported that some of these files were detected as virus's.

FALSE POSITIVES:

Scanned with kaspersky anti-virus 2011. Its only because tversity is a streaming program and its files access the internet and network so most anti-virus's pick it up as a virus.

,DarkHorseDre,2010-12-18T15:59Z,"Dude, is this pro version upgradeable when new versions come out - or will we need to find another one of these modified versions?"
,tversitykraked,2010-12-19T11:37Z,"it has been upgradable so far, since version 1.9.2, and i will release new torrents if possible and also a link to a self extra archive which will update the program from what you have installed now :)"

,Cgoff87,2011-03-15T05:02Z,Spoke too soon.. Hulu says on the PS3 that flash is required.. Whats the deal on that?
,hakarune,2011-05-02T03:32Z,"Didn't seem to work for me (I already had Tversity 1.9.3 installed and running and just threw this over the top and nothing happened looks the same and still says ""Go Pro"" & ""That feature is available only in Pro"""
,Vikmeister,2011-05-14T11:32Z,Same for me.. It says Go Pro
,nameisbob,2011-06-16T11:39Z,"worked for me. make sure you have the right install folder, right click on desktop icon and select open file location. thats where the copy me folder goes. make sure you open both folders to copy & paste. (open the copy me folder, and select all & copy) then paste into install folder and click yes for any merge/overwrite files. and you should be good"
,truecitrus,2011-07-23T22:08Z,Version 1.9.6 is out with a lot of fixes.
,vik96t,2011-12-09T01:09Z,"Ummm, in your forum for the latest tversity link it dosnt work it got deleted and i cant reply because apparently im not aloud too. So if you could make a 1.9.7 torrent or do something that'd be great!"
