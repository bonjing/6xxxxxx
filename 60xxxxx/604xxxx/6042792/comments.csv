,shiningwiz,2011-01-11T09:40Z,"You can't get the subs to work because for whatever unknown fucking reason, the uploader included an IDX file but forgot to include a SUB file.

Just download this instead: http://subscene.com/english/Outrage-Autoreiji/subtitle-395085.aspx and delete the IDX file and you'll be fine."
,saifullahraza,2011-12-01T17:34Z,you are a greatest uploader
