It's mighty fine that you unpack the rars of a previous upload, but you might have forgotten something here: often subs are double rarred as in the original upload of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6047868/The.Hatchet.1969.DVDRip.XviD-LAP is the case

So all non rumenianspeakers: you'll need to grab the subs from thet upload  to ( and double unpack them!)"
