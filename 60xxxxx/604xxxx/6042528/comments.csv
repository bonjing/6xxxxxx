Sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T19:15Z,"@jobinmat: Both shows were regular, but interest dropped down so much that I could not even consider to put them back. 
One episode got SIX DOWNLOADS. With you, now I probably would have seven.

Past is past."
,DMVIN,2010-12-15T19:46Z,"thanks for the avengers.

r u gng to be doing the transformers prime new episodes?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T20:14Z,"@DMVIN : I have new ep.1-5 sources for three days now, but I have not two things: time (for encoding) and bandwidth (for upload to server). Well, I have prioritized things, but redoing Transformers is not near the top of to-do  list."
,dark_defender,2010-12-15T23:51Z,"Hi 20 40,
Thanks for the excellent encode(s).

I know request are frozen ATM but when you resume taking request do i have to put my request again on this forum? Coz i dont want to fall down on your priority list :)"
,dark_defender,2010-12-15T23:58Z,And Social network Brrip is out. Hope you would be doing that soon?
,himansu_007,2010-12-16T04:22Z,"I hv also some requests but will wait till the time when u take requests...
Thanks 4 the encodes..."
,htctouch,2010-12-16T06:29Z,"despicable mini movies rockssssssssssss ....

,r-0987,2010-12-16T06:59Z,the social network blu-ray is out 
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-16T08:31Z,"@dark_defender & r-0987: I got BluRay three days ago, fellows, but...

@dark_defender: ALL properly placed requests have been downloaded, like 60% are encoded and would be upped - but when - your guess is good as mine. Sorry."
,dark_defender,2010-12-16T11:44Z,"^
Lol. I am in no hurry mate. And whats your definition of properly placed request? I wanted iron monkey and deadwood(tv series), Just want to confirm. No intention of wasting your time."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-16T19:06Z,"@dark_defender: I got Iron Monkey on same day - two days ago. It would be encoded, as you said: ""when you can""...

Deadwood - as any other TV serials - stay out of the question. I haven't mentioned that because I was thinking that you would figured that out yourself - asking some uploader who states ""I do not take requests right now because I can't do all stuff"" about TV show widely available - is not ... well... ""recommended"".

My definition of ""properly placed request"" differs not, even in slightest detail, from ANY request in your life. About something that somebody else should give you for free, even without knowing you at all.
"
,dark_defender,2010-12-16T21:19Z,"@twentyforty: Oh man, i did not mean to offend you in any manner whatsoever mate. Even appreciating your work here on forums doesn't make up for the noble work that you are doing.

No more TV series requests. Will look forward to iron monkey(whenever you can)."
