Richard Hammond celebrates the 40th birthday of the iconic Ferrari Daytona by taking one back to its spiritual home on the Italian Riviera, before attempting to beat James May and a multimillion-pound power boat in a race from Portofino to St Tropez.

Meanwhile, back in the UK Jeremy Clarkson is on the test track, testing the new BMW M3 saloon against a young pretender from Japan, the Lexus IS-F. Top Gear also tackles a political hot potato as Richard attempts to find the best sort of bus for British city streets by getting together everything from a hopper to a bendy bus and then racing them.

Plus, Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.
