An 18 year old boy is accused of molesting a 12 year old girl. They call each other "soul mates" and claim they never did more than kiss. He's put away for 6 years and she waits for him but in the meantime is beaten, gang-raped, impregnated and thrown out onto the streets only to eventually turn to a life of drugs, theft and prostitution. Did society make things better for her by putting this "sex offender" behind bars? And when he's released can they ever go back to how things once were?
