too many positive things said about the movie so will check it out :)"
,ptjh,2010-12-23T21:17Z,Is the quality really good even though the size is so small?
,e-Marc,2011-01-02T10:16Z,"Amazing how 720p fits into 400 MB. Of course it's not as good as a 2 GB file, but still recommendable. 

A: 7 (2ch, unfortunately there's a hissing sound throughout the film)
V: 8 (better than lowres)"

It's x264, dumbass."
,michaelrwatson,2012-01-12T03:24Z,"@s_t_o_r_m: You are the dumbass.  jschenk is right: the resolution is too high. 720x304 is best, especially for a 350-400MB file.

And YIFY: *Please* don't create MKV files. Use MP4 instead. Only fucktards use MKV. Thanks."
,torrtruk,2012-01-30T20:51Z,Thanks!
