Wikipedia - Lessons to Be Learned is the debut album by Australian singer-songwriter Gabriella Cilmi, released in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2008 by Island Records and in Australia on 10 May 2008 by Mushroom Records. Co-written and produced by the hit team Xenomania, the album takes its title from a line in the song "Sweet About Me", which would become a worldwide hit.

Amazon.co.uk review By Danny McKenna - It's hard to imagine someone even younger than 19-year-old Laura Marling making a splash on the music scene, but 16-year-old Australian singer Gabriella Cilmi is doing a pretty good job. Having smashed apart stereotypes of innocence with her killer single "(ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nothing) Sweet About Me", Cilmi (pronounced "Chill Me") now offers a debut that's not only lyrically and emotionally mature, but boasts the kind of potent musical content guaranteed to propel you towards the dancefloor. Lessons To Be Learned is a diverse bag. Produced by Xenomania (Girls Aloud, Sugababes) it's seemingly influenced by everyone from Stevie Wonder and the Kings of Leon, though it'll inevitably draw the most comparisons to Amy Winehouse, thanks to Cilmi's soaring vocals, the record's modern-Motown feel and XenomaniaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bright, punchy production. Opener "Save The Lies", though, is nothing like Winehouse--a big, in-your-face disco-stomper with a massive irrefutable chorus. The record drops from there into sultry soul territory with tracks like "Sanctuary", "Einstein", and "Safer", and more upbeat fare such as the electronic "DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Wanna Go To Bed Now", rocky tracks like "Messy" and the bluesy "Cigarettes And Lies". These stylistic diversions set Cilmi apart from the rest of the 'new soul' brigade, and help give her a voice of her own
