@Jimstalk 
With simple words AIRAC is the database for aircrafts FMC (Flight Management Computer) for route planning. With out AIRAC you will not be able to program your FMC and make your realistic flight plan. 
For example if you will look an airports chart you will notice the approach or departure airways... this is provided to FMC through AIRAC. 

Hope to understand and help you a bit. "
