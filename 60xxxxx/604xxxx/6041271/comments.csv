,motley666,2010-12-15T21:49Z,I can*
,dANGER_boy,2010-12-16T05:33Z,It is free...they aren' trying to sell it.  Other classic PC games on GOG.com are for sale but this game was free as a holiday gift.
,chrispm84,2011-01-14T10:13Z,Motley... Stop trying to be Buzz Killington and just enjoy the game. And thanks again Danger... I'll seed this one to 500% also!
,Cyberdevil,2011-02-04T21:02Z,"You get this game free after signing up at GOG, along with three other games: Teen Agent, Beneath A Steel Sky... and some other game with a long title."
