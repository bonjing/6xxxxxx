Here is the awesome vertical shooter Tyrian 2000, gifted free this holiday season to all members of Good Old Games (GOG.com).  Enjoy this DRM-free release, working on the latest Windows operating systems (XP/Vista/7)!

What's cool about it:
    * Classic, oldschool and just awesome vertical schooter gameplay at its best.
    * Gameplay mechanics that are easy to learn but hard to master.
    * Ship Editor - create your own ship and rule the skies.

Please support GOG.com and their effort to revive classic PC gaming without DRM-bullshit by visiting their site, buying some games (all games priced $6-10!), and spreading the news!

Cheers mateys!
