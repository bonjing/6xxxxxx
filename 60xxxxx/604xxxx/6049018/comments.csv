,sadist14,2010-12-18T12:40Z,You Sir are AWESOME. I mean that. I really do.
,itsgreg3411,2010-12-18T15:37Z,"Awesome, thanks!

I only have one problem.. I wanted to set up the server for 2-3 of my friends.. I and they can log in fine, the only problem is that only ONE of us can be logged in at a time. Eg: I was logged in, sent my IP to a friend, he logged in and I got a message saying ""You logged in from a different place"", and when I logged back in, he got the same message. It looks like everyone who connects has username ""Player"".
Any idea how to fix it?"
,itsgreg3411,2010-12-18T15:55Z,"Also, running on W7, launch.bat won't do anything..
And, I now get outdated client message, on linux."
,itsgreg3411,2010-12-18T15:59Z,"Lol, sorry for the spam. I actually fixed both problems now ;p
Didn't notice minecraft_name"
,itsgreg3411,2010-12-18T16:01Z,except for the part when launch.bat doesn't do anything ;p
,h3ll4b0y,2010-12-18T16:04Z,"@ Greg
thats because ur friends and you need to use the Minecraft_Name to launch minecraft. the problem is that, the default name is ""player"" so when ur friends connect, they connect as ""player"" there can only be 1 ""player"" at a time, thats why you use Minecraft_name, it changes ur name ;)"
,sadist14,2010-12-18T18:42Z,Yah launch isnt working I'm running on minecraft server its fine just it seems that commands arent working
,NanoEntity,2010-12-18T21:20Z,"Edit and open in notepad Launch.bat

Look for
java -verbosegc

Change to
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe"" -verbosegc

obviously C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin\java.exe is where you installed java, if its not correct give the right path."

Anyways, I was trying to install some custom mods on my server that me and my friends play on via hamachi, but i couldnt seem to get them to work no matter what i tried, i kept ending up with an error saying: ""java.lang.ClassNotFoundException"" even tho i knew i had added the .class files (not sure if i added them in the right place tho).
Perhaps you could help me out?

The Mods i was trying to install was:
[MOD] Humans+ v0.9 (ALPHA 1.2.6) http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=103072

[MOD] Handheld Torch Light V1.3b http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=105332

[Mod] Zan's Mods! (Minimap/Shape Builder) http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=77497

I strongly recommend these mods. Perhaps you could try them out, and if you like them you could implement them in your next release? or implement them as an option to turn them on my adding them in the plugins in server.properties.

Thanks in advance."

,Echelon88,2010-12-26T20:20Z,"Thanks for the reply nano.
I believe its the minecraft_name.jar file. For some reason as soon as I load that (without any connections to any server) it has no sound. On windows xp and windows 7, cant figure it out.

Been playing it in silence, been killed by sneaky creepers exploding so many times now >.< haha.
Loving it, so thanks Nano."
