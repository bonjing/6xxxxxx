,kbx1982,2010-12-25T19:29Z,"What software do i need to play the movie in 3D on a normal led PC monitor, i have the 3D stereoscopic red and blue film goggles."
,kbx1982,2010-12-25T21:42Z,"The whole concept of 100s of different types of 3D glasses (most of which you can make yourself with red and blue coloured markers or red and blue coloured plastic) plus the need to install nvidia drivers plus the need to have a 120 ghz monitor plus the need to have a special player (other than VLC) to play this file...makes me not want to download this even though i want to, can any body help and clarify my situtation?

I bought ChromaDepth aka C3D glasses for 10$ from an online store (they are like plain plastic) but they turn normal LED/LCD display into the red and blue outlines type of look. I have also made the red and blue plastic glasses myself.

I have a 15.6 inch BenQ LED (don't laugh) which is 60 hz i think.

I have nvidia 7025 on board my Asus Mobo.

I don't have a standalone graphics card.

I have win xp.

If i download this, will it play using the above?"
,valtonero,2010-12-26T07:17Z,37 GBs of NOTHING.
,Mathlol,2010-12-26T07:50Z,"@kbx1982  There is absolutely no reason for such high quality on such a small screen, you will never notice it.  

For that size, I would suggest the quality around a 4-5 GB size.  HOWERVER, with this particular movie, the flawless release (2.49BG) is the crispest (despicting each feather/strand).  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6025563/Legend_Of_The_Guardians_2010_720p_BRRip_XviD_AC3-FLAWL3SS
Don't believe me? Then compare the screens with any other release."
,stekun,2011-01-02T09:06Z,"I have downloaded the file, and unpacked with winrar. but it is still packed. can anyone help me what to do to play/open this file?"
,valtonero,2011-01-02T10:22Z,Fake. Everyone that downloads this file will have the same problem. File cannot be fully unzipped or unmounted.

,maheshthepande9,2011-01-23T05:03Z,its an iso i finished downloading but rar file take more time to extract iso its perfect both 2D & 3D its not fake...........THANKS WEBCHELLA
,spotteddick,2011-03-30T07:03Z,"This is the real thing! It took me 16 hours with powerarchiver to compress all the rar parts into a single iso. (You need lots of hard drive space; I'm running a quad core computer with windows 64 ultimate and 4Gigs ram). Once you have the iso, it is difficult to play. Even power dvd 10 wouldn't play it, nor would vlc.
You now need to install magicdisk or similar software to mount the iso. This will allow you to see the files inside the disk image. (...and no I still couldn't play it).
From windows explorer while viewing the mounted iso which appears as a virtual DVD/bluray drive on your computer you need to right click on the BDMV folder and remove the read only attributes as well as the archive attribute. (you'll probably need administrator rights to do this) Be sure to include all sub folders and contents within the BDMV folder. (I did get one error but it didn't affect a file critical to playing the video).

Now create a directory folder with all the uncompressed files and folders and label it to match the movie, or whatever name you like. Copy and paste all three folders and contents viewable in the virtual drive (ANY!, BDMV, and CERTIFICATE) into this new folder. This requires about 80 Gigs of space. (Yes your 40Gig ISO will double in size when you extract the contents)

Using VLC player you can now open the 24 Gig file labelled 00001.m2ts within the Stream folder within the BDMV folder. It should play a flawless 2D Bluray with DTS sound indistinguishable from the purchased bluray disk. (PowerDVD 10 also played the file but was a bit glitchy - probably my 3 year old video card 9600GT OC.

The 3D data is also there. I believe it's the SSIF folder and 33 Gig file within although I haven't bothered to experiment yet.

I took a while to figure all this out, but the movie is absolutely flawless!"
,equatorius,2011-07-16T15:30Z,"Who the hell just thought it's a good idea to place a DB50 ISO in a compressed solid archive???

Didn't he had any better things to do instead of compressing this? If it needs 12 hours to unpack then I guess it had to take more than 24 hours (may be a few days) to compress. And for what??? He saved 3% of the size??????

I just can't believe it...

(First I thought I have a problem with my PC but I read the comments...)"
,margalo,2011-09-28T16:05Z,I'm not able to extract the files... Error with winrar. Anybody can help?
,elaleman1969,2011-10-06T09:48Z,"i can't reed this file.
Como se hace para descomprimir y ver la pelicula. Intente descomprimirlo y luego de 11 horas me creo un archivo iso, al intentar montarlo en el lector virtual, no lo reconoce y al intentar descomprimir el iso me crea nuevamente todos los 20 archivos. porque no dices que programas utilizaste para comprimir y explica como descomprimirlo."
