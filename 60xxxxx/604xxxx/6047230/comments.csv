,excursion65,2010-12-25T05:35Z,"Let's just bitch about downloading a seven gig torrent and it takes longer than twenty seconds. Your internet must suck, bro. "
,DrMuchLove,2010-12-28T09:17Z,"Bro, i have one of the fastest connections in Australia."
,DrMuchLove,2010-12-28T10:51Z,less than 100kb/s This is bollocks! I get 800/1mb a sec on every other torrent. I CALL SHENANIGANZ!
,zookap,2010-12-31T03:00Z,Seed and I'll send you all good karma. If you don't seed then you better watch your step around every corner.
,xdi3hardx,2011-01-12T04:24Z,I hate how this torrent isnt simple... it has 3 damn files per episode and it's playing with webdings font as subtitles what the hell
,EdwardTeach12345,2011-01-17T04:06Z,"I do not know what everyone else is complaining about. Great video and audio and download was fast.   V 10 A 10.
It contains subtitle files in English or Korean if you need that. Hopefully if you do you are the good Korean. Fuck North Korea."
,goshidk,2011-01-30T16:56Z,"Can someone please help me in getting the file format to either mp4 or avi???
Thanks. "
,TrexiZ,2011-01-30T17:46Z,"This is bullshit, i hate how all new torrents are MKV files. I prefer AVI, not as large more simple. I cant play this shit on my xbox!"
,mat459,2011-02-10T03:45Z,"Thanx. U should do seasons 1-5 in HD. If u do, i will let u date my sister, and that is a real treat, cause i dont let anyone date my sister, not even her boyfriend."
,nickstarks,2011-02-28T20:45Z,Sunny was never filmed in HD until season 5...
,nickstarks,2011-02-28T20:46Z,when is season 6 bluray coming out.. i hate tv rips..
,shelborg,2011-04-28T09:12Z,"@ TrexiZ Not his fault. The Xbox is reallllly picky about what it plays.  I'd buy a PS3 instead of fighting with it all the time, if I could afford it. but I can't, so I'm there with you."
,fossil44,2011-05-06T07:30Z,whats wrong with all you pelicans shit that is what google is for to find info on how to do different things. do you all need someone to hold you dick while you take a piss. get win avi all in one convertor and convert it to what ever you want if i was the uploader id tell you all to take a LONG WALK ON A SHORT PLANK. NO WONDER UPLOADERS GET PISSED WITH YOU ALL. THANKS FOR THE UP MATE. NOT HARD TO SAY THANKS EITHER YOU PELICANS. 
,shelborg,2011-05-17T08:17Z,"All I'm saying is, Xbox sucks at playing videos, this torrent is great, thanks."
,sagarsavla,2011-06-15T21:46Z,"S05E13 is a farce. It's only 20 minutes. The original 'It's a very sunny Christmas' is ~44 minutes.

.smi SAMI subtitle files are pretty useless. .srt subs are good though. some of the mkv episodes have the subtitles tracks in the file itself too.


Rest all is superb.


The uploader should have given all these details himself. stupid."
,ADNC,2011-08-05T15:29Z,"Got it in less than 20min...Good Quality, Thanks for the UL "
,rustyrambo,2011-09-11T21:43Z,Ps3 Doesn't play mkv files either. Those are the only movies that I HAVE to watch on my computer.
,Mack66,2011-09-14T03:27Z,The subtitles are massive and very distracting for me.
,Xeginy,2011-10-03T16:50Z,"this is a great download, thanks"
,b1naryatr0phy,2011-10-10T06:54Z,"@TrexiZ

Here are your options:

1. Do like any non-retard does and covert it your goddamn self. 
2. Don't waste money on Microsh!t.
3. Fuckin spend the little $$$ you have on this shit once in awhile.

I'm so sick of seeing you worthless cunts on here whining about senseless shit =/"
,glaramir,2011-10-24T07:42Z,how come when i play these videos (in VLC player) it will randomly stop the video at the same spots everytime and i have to start the video over and then go to the spot right after where it froze up. it does it every single time at the exact same spots. please help
,Necropulsar,2011-12-08T14:13Z,"Beautiful quality torrent, simply beautiful."
,GeneralTso92,2012-01-22T21:58Z,"Ha, that's pretty clever of you.
You said Microshit instead of Microsoft.

In the meantime, you sound pretty mad bro."

Oh, and bullshit to having one of the fastest connections in Austrailia.
Just bullshit."
,unamuzzed,2012-01-27T20:48Z,thanks man
,namegamejosie,2012-05-07T21:39Z,"I got these to work for me by using Prism File Converter. I converted the .mkv files to .avi files. Works well, though the conversion process takes a little while. I watch them on Windows Media Player.

There were no subs, and good quality."
