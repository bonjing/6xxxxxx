From Wiki:


Jethro Tull are a British rock group formed in 1967.[1] Their music is 
characterised by the lyrics, vocals and flute playing of Ian Anderson, who has led the band since its founding, and the guitar work of Martin Barre, who has been with the band since 1969.

Initially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they have also incorporated elements of classical music, folk music, jazz and art rock into their music.

One of the world's best-selling music artists, the band has sold more than 60 million albums worldwide[1] in a career that has spanned five decades.
