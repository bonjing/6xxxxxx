,suiCider,2011-01-10T23:58Z,"what kind of a stupid fucking idea is it to make upload a torrent which you have to buy (blank) cd's to see?

When you can choose between simple and needlessly intricate and boring, you choose the latter, like a fat french mac using idiot.
may your torrents forever catch aids and your fingers fall off."
