Lam Yi (Grace Ip) returns to the orphanage that she grew up in after a broken relationship leaves her homeless. On the way back one night, she encounters a physically scarred child abandoned on the street with nowhere to go. Feeling sorry for her, Lam Yi takes her back to the orphanage to care for her. However, an investigation into the child's past reveals spooky paranormal events that becomes far more horrifying that Lam Yi could ever imagine.

Produced by director Derek Yee (One Nite in Mongkok)
