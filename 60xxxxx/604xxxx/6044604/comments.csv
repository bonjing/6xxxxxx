,Shikaku2,2010-12-17T15:41Z,Works! I did find that I had to completely remove any previous version before installing.
,ragman420,2010-12-19T14:49Z,"Works great.  Found a file my Symantec Endpoint Protection missed.  I actually got version 4.46 you uploaded earlier, but it updated to 4.47 with no problems.  Thanks."
,narfdude,2010-12-31T17:23Z,"It works for me finally. I got the 'program not installed' message in the patcher. It didn't work until after I used the old patcher. Even then it only patched the file, and SAS still said 'trial version'. So I entered the reg number and activation code manually. Im on windows 7 x64 if it helps."

Isn't any Crack in the file only the patch and program."
