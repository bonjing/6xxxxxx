In the brilliantly accomplished centerpiece of Rohmerâ€™s Moral Tales series, Jean-Louis Trintignant plays Jean-Louis, one of the great conflicted figures of sixties cinema. A pious Catholic engineer in his early thirties, he lives by a strict moral code in order to rationalize his world, drowning himself in mathematics and the philosophy of Pascal. After spotting the delicate, blonde FranÃ§oise at Mass, he vows to make her his wife, although when he unwittingly spends the night at the apartment of the bold, brunette divorcÃ©e Maud, his rigid ethical standards are challenged. A breakout hit in the United States, My Night at Maudâ€™s was one of the most influential and talked-about films of the decade.
