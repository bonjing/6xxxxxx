From thefewbook.com:

By the summer of 1940 Hitler was triumphant and planning an invasion of 
England. But the United States was still a neutral country and, as Winston 
Churchill later observed, "the British people held the fort alone."

A few Americans, however, did not remain neutral. They joined Britain's 
Royal Air Force to fight Hitler's air aces and help save Britain in its 
darkest hour.

The Few is the never-before-told story of these thrill-seeking Americans 
who defied their country's neutrality laws to fly side-by-side with 
England's finest pilots. They flew the lethal and elegant Spitfire, and 
became "knights of the air."

With minimal training and plenty of guts they dueled the skilled pilots 
of Germany's Luftwaffe in the blue skies over England. They shot down 
several of Germany's fearsome aces, and were feted as national heroes in
Britain.

By October 1940, they had helped England win the greatest air battle in 
the history of aviation. At war's end, just one of the "Few" would be 
alive. The others died flying, wearing the RAF's dark blue uniform each 
with a shoulder patch depicting an American eagle.

As Winston Churchill said, "Never in the field of human conflict was so 
much owed by so many to so few."


From Wiki:

Alex Kershaw taught history at Whitgift school for two years before working 
as a journalist for several British newspapers, including The Guardian, The 
Independent and The Sunday Times. His journalism has appeared in many leading 
newspapers and magazines around the world. He has also worked as a writer and 
producer in television, penning an award-winning documentary about Bobby Kennedy. 
Several of his books have been optioned by Hollywood, including The Few which 
was selected as the Military Book Club's first ever book of the year in 2006. 

He has been cited as a "master storyteller" by Booklist for his work on The Few.


From Publishers Weekly:

With his customary narrative drive, Kershaw (The Bedford Boys: One American 
Town's Ultimate D-Day Sacrifice) spotlights the handful of American pilots 
who joined the Royal Air Force and its fighter squadrons during the Battle 
of Britain. They have been overshadowed by or confused with the better-known 
Eagle Squadrons, which formed in the autumn of 1940 with the tacit consent 
of the U.S. government. Kershaw's "few" were a vanguard, enlisting 
individually to operate the British Spitfire planes as early as May 1940, 
when England stood alone and her odds of survival seemed long. Crusaders and 
adventurers, the pilots ignored U.S. neutrality acts to fight from a mixture 
of principled opposition to Nazism, vaguely defined Anglophilia and sheer love 
of air combat at a time when it still seemed glamorous. Scattered by ones and 
twos among different squadrons, each had his own story, which Kershaw admirably 
contextualizes within the climate of the Battle of Britain. Using personal 
vignettes to convey the extraordinary routines of life in the cockpits, in the 
squadrons and in England, Kershaw evokes the heroism of these pilots, only one 
of whom survived the war whose tide they helped turn.
