,ntdlr,2012-03-19T13:43Z,"I tried this on another pc and it worked without any problem once extract all the content into a folder. But, however, when I tried to my pc, with a mcafee antivirus pack, it gave the warning that there is a malware inside the keygen, named Generic PUP.z!fa. "
,violet1143,2012-03-24T08:25Z,"The program does work. All you guys have to do is to copy all the contents of the ISO in a folder, and then run the setup from there. And don't worry about the virus warnings, it's just that McAfee flags the keygen as potentially unwanted."
