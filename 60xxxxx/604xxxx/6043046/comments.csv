,pipa_olt,2011-01-06T22:25Z,"strange. I have W7 64-bit aswel and it works.Are you following the instructions correctly?
VERY IMPORTANT!!! ###Right-click on Activator SP.exe and RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR.###"
,chrishaney23,2011-03-04T14:46Z,where is the activator sp.exe file?  i got the install app and thats it?
,Zenjin,2011-03-31T17:50Z,Works great!
,drmusic4771,2011-04-22T10:51Z,chrishaney23 if you have norton antivirus or similar it probably deleted it so thats why you cant find it. I have norton so what I had to do was right click on my norton antivirus taskbar and select disable antivirus auto protect for 15 minutes and then select that activator file and it worked like a charm it is NOT a virus believe me I would not load it on my pc!!! I hate it when people say oh man dont download this its a virus its because its a hack and antivirus programs such as them will say that so u dont get something for free please understand BUT I am not saying that all of them are like that if thats the case after you install the activator please scan your pc if you feel UNSAFE ok thanks uploader!!!

,SpikeballUnion,2011-06-01T17:20Z,"For some reason it keeps saying ""file access error!"". It says it found the files (I figured out you need to select the directory where you installed RealPlayer SP), but however many times I try, it just keeps saying that. Please help, thanks."
,pipa_olt,2011-06-22T15:23Z,"right...
thank you drmusic4771 for helping out.
some antivirus delete the Activator.exe as soon as is downloaded so, u might want to disable it for an hour or so in order to install the program.
follow drmusic4771 instruction first and then mine and you shud have a working program.
sorry for late reply but i was busy.
goodluck!"
