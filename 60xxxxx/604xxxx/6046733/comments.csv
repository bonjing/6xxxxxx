,phantomshadowxv,2010-12-20T07:21Z,"Okay, so there are two posible scenarios:
1- This .dat is a one-of-a-kind video that no player recognises 

or

2- This is a virus, crap, or similar that can be practically condensed in waste of time and bandwith...
I wonder which is the most probable"

,killthaprunes,2011-01-31T23:10Z,".dat is a file created for a especific type of program.If htis torrent havent ad specs of the program,the stupid uploader its definitely a mental according to his nick,anyway if the contents isnt a familiar image or video file are you people wasting your time.Always check your torrents before downloading.Many motherfuckers just want to waste some others time."
