Guilt or innocence is of no concern to a defending council, least of all to unemotional Venetia Aldricht QC, when another brilliant forensic display secures her client an acquittal for murder at the Old Bailey. But it is a different kettle of fish when the same sinisterly attractive young psychopath involves himself with her gauche love-starved daughter. When the iron-lady QC is then stabbed in locked Chambers, with grotesque trimmings to the corpse added posthumously by another hand, Commander Adam Dalgleish and his team, meticulously sifting the human sediment of the past for a motive, are suddenly wrong-footed when the prime suspect is murdered. But the clever killer has made one significant mistake - the final act in an East Anglian reedbed and the wry summation prove vengeance is a two-edged sword. Urgent, intricate, baffling, to rank with James's very best.
