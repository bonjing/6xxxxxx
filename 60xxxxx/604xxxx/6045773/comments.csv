,abccba2,2010-12-18T10:51Z,"Has anyone tried this?

Some of the file and folder names for the torrent are corrupted or in a non English script!"
,jinualex,2010-12-18T12:51Z,"Hi abccba2,

If you want English you have to download the big rar files (700 MB) only. The other 132 MB contains only the utilities for Korean language and Korean key-board."
,jinualex,2010-12-18T12:52Z,"the file and folder names for the torrent are not corrupted, they are in Korean names. The torrent may be an upload from Korea. But the Windows file names are in English.
