Release Into The Wild The First. Or just VDU RITW1. 
Er, yeah.

Anyway, this bundle of files is brought to you by
Danfox Davies, self described furry & Pirate Party 
UK Member (neither of which should you let alter 
your judgement of said files, of Vulpine Designs 
Unlimited or of anything else related or unrelated 
to it) and Chief Executive Fox of Vulpine Designs 
Unlimited, which sounds far grander than it isn't.

I hereby declare that I am releasing my work under
a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, except for any
items including trademarks of other companies, in
which case it's BY-NC-ND and a big reminder that 
said trademarks are copyright of and belong to their 
respective companies, including the name 'LEGO' and 
its logo and so on being trademarks of the LEGO Group.

If you folks would be so kind as to visit my website
at http://www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk , I would very much 
appreciate it. It takes a lot of time to create this
work, if you feel that's worth something please drop 
me an email and you can Paypal me. If enough people 
do so I'll set up an automated system on my site.
If you want, you can commission me to design and/or make 
something unique for you, or you can buy one of our 
pre-designed models.
Even if you're skint or you don't think my work's 
that interesting, please drop me an email with feedback
to info@vulpinedesigns.co.uk .

Anyway.
A big compressed folder. Herein contained is
Volume 1 of what is hopefully to become a regular
thing: a veritable smorgasbord of design ideas 
built in Lego, hours spent on each one, and now 
all set free into the wild yonder to roam the 
interwebs and be eaten by a troll or something.

In your free goody bag (compressed folder) you get:
*Folders. 
Each contains a weird Lego(R) design presented using:
** A picture, in JPG or PNG format or both.
** A CAD file. This will be in LXF format.
** Another CAD file. This will be in LDR format.
** A text file description/explanation.
Occasionally:
** Building instructions in ODG format and PDF format.
(if I have gotten round to making them for that model).

*This text file.
*Creative Commons License.
*Possibly some other things.

A link to the download page for LEGO(R) Digital Designer
is here: http://ldd.lego.com

A link to the website for LDraw is here: 
http://www.ldraw.org
Please note that files converted from LDD to LDraw are 
liable to missing pieces or unrecognised parts.

No warranty, implied or otherwise, is attached to any of these files.
If you want to get one of these things built for real WITH a warranty,
please go to www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk and read the Terms And Conditions 
at the bottom, and email me should you be inclined to go ahead.

It cannot be guaranteed that some sort of virus hasn't 
attached itself to this folder by now.
It is after all a folder circulating the intertubes by 
means of Torrent or possibly something else if someone's 
uploaded this to a different system. Therefore, I must
suggest that you either:
a. Use an expensive anti-virus system.
b. Use an expensive computer from a certain 
Cupertino-based firm, and still possibly get a virus.
OR
c. Use Linux. Like I'm doing right now. It's not rocket 
science, most of it's not even geeky enough to keep 
most geeks enthused any more, that's why they invented BSD.
And STILL possibly get a virus. Which was probably patched 
against, like, 2 years before you downloaded this folder. 
Whew, close one.

And finally, please see  
http://www.vulpinedesigns.co.uk/downloads/termsandconditions.pdf 
if you want to buy anything from us. 
Which you might just if you'd like models like these 
made to the quality and detail levels we can do.
