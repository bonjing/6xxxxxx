Dr. Phil speaks with families facing life-changing choices this holiday season. Darrell has diabetes and needs a new kidney. For the last five years, heâ€™s spent four hours a day, six days a week hooked up to a dialysis machine. So why havenâ€™t Darrellâ€™s family members gotten tested to see if theyâ€™re a match for donating a much-needed kidney? And, Natalie Cole may be a world-renowned, Grammy Award-winning singer, but she is also a survivor of life-threatening hepatitis C and kidney failure. In her memoir, Love Brought Me Back, Natalie opens up about the ordeal that changed her life forever and offers a message of hope and healing to anyone who has ever faced tragedy. The songstress shares the fateful day when she received a kidney. Meet the family of Natalieâ€™s donor, and find out why they made the tough decision to donate their loved oneâ€™s organs. Plus, meet parents struggling with the decision to allow their 11-year-old daughter to continue with her love of gymnastics, even though the sport is detrimental to her health.
