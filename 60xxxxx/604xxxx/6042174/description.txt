Imagine living in constant fear that your own child will attack you or other family members. Ron and Christine know that fear all too well. They say their 9-year-old son, Zachary, punches, kicks, screams, hits the walls and tries to tackle them. They say he even takes his anger out on the family pets. Dr. Alan Kazdin, professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale University and author of The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child, has advice for managing aggressive behavior. Find out how to calm a tantrum and what to do when your childâ€™s meltdown becomes violent. Next, Scott and Carolin say they donâ€™t know how to control their 12-year-old son, Nathaniel. They say he chokes them, breaks windows in their home and stabs knives into the kitchen counter, and now theyâ€™re afraid that he could actually kill them. Whatâ€™s at the root of Nathanielâ€™s rage? See what Dr. Kazdin uncovers when he sits down with the young man.
