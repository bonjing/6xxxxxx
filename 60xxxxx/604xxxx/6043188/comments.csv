some 7 to 8 years past i saw a movie in star movies and i liked it very much n now i want to download it but cant recall the name of the movie. Anyone please help.........

plot-(which i can remember)-
it was a story of a man living in a small town. once he was out for shoping in an open market and was struck by a light from space (may be alien). After which he fainted and when he woke up he had some new power of extraordinary brain. As he was a farmer he grew big apple size tomatoes n other vegetables double from there original size. He could heal people using his powers. At the end he healed a dying boy using his powers and he himself died with that disease.


Please anyone who recognize this movie can inform me here or my email id is- Devasheesh07ee@gmail.com"
