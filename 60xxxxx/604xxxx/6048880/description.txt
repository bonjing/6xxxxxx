Nigella is putting her very own stamp on some seriously fabulous and favourite recipes.

First up, a luscious Italian dessert, tiramisu made even more incredible with hazelnut liqueur. Then it's her home-style version of Jamaica's classic jerk chicken with coconutty rice and peas. And she is shaking up an all-time favourite salad, turning the left-over jerk chicken into a quick chick Caesar. Then toad in the hole gets a face-lift for a cosy and cocooning Sunday night supper.

This is the food Nigella loves, and she did it her way.
