Shankly's 2010 Christmas Gift to You

I defy you to find any mixes cooler than those provided to you by Shankly - and this Christmas mix is no exception. 

volume one starts with a traditional Christmas selection that even your Mum would like - and all tracks from 2010. 

volumes 2 & 3 are also all from 2010 and range from pop to alternative to the very wierd. 

volume 4 is a selction of alternatrive Christmas tunes from the past decade (2001-2009) that Shankly either missed or just wants you to enjoy again.

Merry Christmas!
