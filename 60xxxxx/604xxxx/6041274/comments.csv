you're most welcome :)
however it would be much better if more of those leechers could actually seed. but nearly as always they got what they need so why share it with other ppl? damned parasites... i am initial-seeding @ 10 KB/s and wont unlimit as i already ULed 12 GB."

not possible. what AV and which file? my avast did not find anything infected, so i assume you got a false positive. besides you're the first one to say this, maybe you use some crap esoteric av...
anyway IT is not infected."
