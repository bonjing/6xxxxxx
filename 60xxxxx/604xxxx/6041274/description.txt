First season is what i managed to find here and other trackers. I renamed some of the files because they were named incorrectly as S2.

Second season is what i managed to download fromI also renamed the files as such a scheme was used, example: 206BLOODANDGREENHORNS.avi or 201TTGG.avi. Also MPC-HC with ffdshow (config nearly as CCCP) had some video problems (black screen with sound) with this season, other player (SubEdit) using ffdshow had no problems. Other DivX files i play with MPC-HC, run perfectly, no idea where the porblem is.

Enjoy and seed! :D
