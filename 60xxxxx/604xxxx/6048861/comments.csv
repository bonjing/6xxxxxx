,zippyderppyguy,2010-12-20T11:18Z,Thanks again. Great up load.
,herbal-peace,2011-01-06T18:49Z,"Thanks a ton, K3nd00d. I will be seeding this for as long as possible. The truth needs revealed and for once they dare show it on television as a conspiracy when its complete truth. The bitches in control of your TV are already cancelling the show and finding ways to get rid of the videos on the internet, even your DVR, trying to hide all visible evidences that most never notice. We cant let that happen. Open the eyes of another by sharing these."
,boboandu2,2011-01-16T12:12Z,"Now i got it. thats why i havent even seen a new upisode. and the strange thing is, i had this show programmed to record on my dvr. and now its not even set on my dvr. and i cant find the show anywhere on cable tv."
,k3nd00d,2011-01-17T11:15Z,"Does anyone think ""Brad Meltzer's Decoded"" show on the History Channel should be put up? The show is a bit of a joke and insult, so I am unsure if it should be put up. We may be better off ignoring it. I don't know. Let me know what you think."

,LJE111,2011-03-15T10:40Z,"k3nd00d: My husband and I watched a couple of ""Brad Meltzer's Decoded""  episodes and deleted the remaining episodes. it's not just a joke, it's ms-information. If you ask me, he plays for the other team...or he's just a complete idiot. His so-called team of ""investigators"" are about as mainstream, don't-rock-the-boat-I've-got-a-good-gig as they come.

Thanks for putting all of season 2 Conspiracy Theory together for us - great show. Ventura does not pull any punches. Heâ€™s an insider who has seen plenty but didnâ€™t sell out."
,sole420,2011-03-25T03:31Z,"Thanks for this excellent upload.  Decoded is an insulting disinformation campaign for the most part, I suggest not uploading it"
