The biggest problem is that you can't progress in main Events, since Suzuka has to be driven to pass Class: C event, and if you do not pass Class: C event, you can't participate in Class: B & Class: A events. So it is actually Game Over 4 U!

I downloaded this game too (also PAL) and the problem is the same:

Has anyone successfully completed this JB game?  

Tnx to Uploader & Seeders"
