PLOT:


A satire of Stalinist Russia, Animal Farm tells of the revolt of the animals of Manor Farm against their human masters. Led by the pigs Snowball (Lenin) and Napoleon (Stalin), the animals attempt to create a utopian society. Soon, however, Napoleon gets a taste for power, drives out Snowball, and establishes a totalitarian regime as brutal and corrupt as any human society. Manor Farm becomes a world where all animals are equal--but some are more equal than others.

Chaos ensues when animals take over the farm in this magnificent adaptation of George Orwell's classic novel, which features the magic of Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson's Creature Shop.

Set in the beautiful Irish countryside and populated with a wide variety of barnyard animals, Animal Farm is sure to leave the whole family squealing with delight.
