,ruperto,2010-12-17T07:54Z,fake
,ruperto,2010-12-17T07:58Z,(it's last years xmas episode)
,krapnek,2010-12-17T13:10Z,It's not fake. Last years christmas episode never actually aired. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_%28season_5%29
,KevMovieMan,2010-12-17T16:03Z,"It never aired on T.V. however it was part of the DVD Season 5 Set, listed as episode 13! If this is last years... I'm gonna be pissed!"
[T],moebanzor,2010-12-17T16:43Z,"Not only is this the same as S05E13, it is only the first 1/2 of it. The S05E13 was 350mb, and 40 min and this ""S06E13"" is only 20 min. 

But it seems like the always sunny guys really did use this exact same episode in two seasons... just look at this: http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/12/17/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-season-6-episode-13-recap/"
[T],moebanzor,2010-12-17T16:47Z,"Also according to wiki, Season 6 of sunny only contains 12 episodes, and the finale was already shown on dec. 6. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_Always_Sunny_in_Philadelphia_(season_6)"

I couldn't have said it better. Here is the wiki reference, ""This episode is a direct to DVD, Blu-ray and Digital Download movie. It went on sale November 17, 2009, and will air on December 16, 2010 on FX as the last episode of season 6."""
