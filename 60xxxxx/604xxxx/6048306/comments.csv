,mike571,2010-12-19T06:21Z,"HR, Can't thank you enough!  I'm completely new to the torrent world, but I was directed to your lists via a friend.  I've had nothing but success.  I've read most of the FAQ pages.. Any advice or direction for a novice regarding this wonderful place!!  Thanks again for your UL......"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-19T06:39Z,"stick with vips (green skull) until you know what is what.  lot of fake crap here.  some people encode to a certain platform, like me.  some just release scene releases.  some just release junk :/"
,Hdavila,2010-12-19T08:37Z,"THANK YOU HR!!!!

,Ancient_Anomaly,2011-01-24T23:32Z,"Now I see it even includes AC3, but I can't acess it. MPC won't show it at all, MPUI does but the track is empty. Is it really there? "
