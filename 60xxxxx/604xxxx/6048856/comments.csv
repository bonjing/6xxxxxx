,k3nd00d,2010-12-19T02:02Z,The Man is keeping me down! LOL
,enemy2k,2010-12-31T01:14Z,thanks k3nd00d for uploading all of the season 2 episodes. Any word on a season 3 for this show?
,k3nd00d,2010-12-31T17:52Z,"No word yet for a season 3. But, I don't expect a 3rd season. We'll see, who knows."
,enemy2k,2011-01-10T10:27Z,That sucks. I hope the ratings were at least decent enough for Tru TV.
,k3nd00d,2011-03-21T20:27Z,"This is the highest rated show truTV has, both seasons. But, there are pressures from within the federal government that are making it difficult to see a 3rd season. But, it could happen."
