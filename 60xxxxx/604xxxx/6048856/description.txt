valuable commodity, and corporations and super-rich oil dynasties are believed

reserves.
(NEW TITLE & DESCRIPTION)
"The Gulf Oil Spill"
The BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico has led to devastation along
Louisiana's coast and in its fishing and tourism industries. But was it
deliberate? Jesse Ventura leads his team into the bayou where they investigate
claims of a plot to depopulate Louisiana and turn it into America's refinery.
At the core: the government's alleged secret, multi-billion dollar depopulation
program that began in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and was kicked into
Phase Two with the oil rig blast.

**THIS EPISODE** Episode 8 - "The Pentagon"/"The 9/11 Pentagon Conspiracy"
Premieres Fri, December 17, 2010 at 10P
(ORIGINAL TITLE & DESCRIPTION)
"The Pentagon"
Ventura investigates the theory that a missile, and not a hijacked airliner,
hit The Pentagon during the September 11 attacks.
(NEW TITLE & DESCRIPTION)
"The 9/11 Pentagon Conspiracy"
The idea that a missile or explosivesâ€”not a hijacked jetlinerâ€”damaged the
Pentagon on September 11, 2001 seems the most unlikely of 9/11 theories. That
is, until you look at all the factors, which include eyewitness testimony, crime
scene video, expert analysis and the question why, with 85 cameras trained on
the building, have only five frames of crash footage have ever been released?
Jesse Ventura leads a serious investigation into a tangled web of clues that
some say are too sacred to even touch.
