Any file-type converter?"
,jswalski,2010-12-17T07:00Z,You unzip or unrar the .rar file with zip or winrar and watch.
,freeholay,2010-12-18T06:33Z,"NUKE... the rar asks for the location of Part 2 which has not yet been released.

TvTeam's version of this torrent is good I'm guessing since it's exactly the same size with the same description identically and it's just an .avi file.

Very strange... scenebalance usually catches this type of torrent."
,JayHated,2010-12-23T13:16Z,"scenebalance, are you working on getting part 2 up? nobody has upped it yet."
,Brainbuster,2010-12-23T15:10Z,yup...would be nice with Part 2...
