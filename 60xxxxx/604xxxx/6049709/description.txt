Castaways  Brian Keene

They came to the deserted island to compete on a popular reality television show. Each one of them hoped to be the last to leave. Now, theyâ€™re just hoping to stay alive, because one of them isnâ€™t who he seems, and the island isnâ€™t as deserted as it appears. The men will be slaughtered. The women will be kept alive as captives. And before it is over, the survivors will turn on each other. Night is falling, the creatures are coming, and rescue is so very far awayâ€¦
