,WooZism,2010-12-18T15:49Z,Just wanted to thank you for all your hard work and your amazing quality for small sizes.  Also I'm aware your requests are frozen so I'm not trying to make a request just curious as to if I should wait or find another source for Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles especially given its a show of the past and you seem to prefer to not do full season or full series packs (completely understandable) but if I could expect it from you in the future I'd much prefer to get it here for my library as opposed to some other source that isn't nearly as reliable. Either way ty again for all your herculean efforts and ty also for your studiously high standards not only in quality but also in how torrenting should be done and not being afraid to establish rules to expedite the process that benefits everyone!

@WooZism: Thank you for your kind words. Regarding TSCC - it is one of my five most favored series ever, right next to Serenity, Life, Monk and Twilight. If I can, believe me, I would make reference encodings and seed till my last breath... but I can't. I  barely cope with daily things. I am sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-18T16:47Z,"Twilight = Moonlight

Sorry, I have no clue why I have done that..."
,silveroakleaf,2010-12-18T19:21Z,"20-40, as always - thank you for your most generous contributions in time, effort, and expertise.

I know from other comments you have a home brew for encoding, but what settings (besides 2 pass) do you use?  Is there a typical bitrate you favor?  Any specific x264 tunings or presets?"
,longdistance,2010-12-18T19:32Z,Yeah! Sanctuary. Keep up the good work. 
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-18T19:50Z,"@silveroakleaf: In my response, on Munich thread, I have said: ""anyone interested can reproduce settings in smallest detail by reading and understanding .nfo which accompanies all movie torrents of mine"".

In short, nothing special."
,WooZism,2010-12-19T01:54Z,"There is absolutely nothing to apologize for 'beggars can't be chossers' as the saying goes lolz you already do more than enough I figured it was long shot chance anyways. 
(I certainly hope that slip was merely a reaction to the pressures of the holidays as opposed to a true freudian slip cause Moonlight = awesomeness while Twighlight = anything but IMO LOL) 
After seeing your personal favs I'd like to extend my sympathies I enjoyed all those as well and too many of them were canceled much to soon what is it w/ fox and eliminating good shows just as they wet our appetites for more? D= 
Hope your holidays are wonderful and things slow down a bit in the future for you."
