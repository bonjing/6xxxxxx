,theaetetus,2010-12-18T08:22Z,"Nice rip, as always. But why do you cut it off before the credits end? Only hacks who have no regard for film do that.

Your cutting off the movie before it has ended also doesn't help legitimize your questionable choice of using mp4 as opposed to Matroska as your container.

Your rips confirm the prevailing view that hacks use mp4. People who love movies and know what they're doing use Matroska.

This is not to say that I do not really respect and admire you for your excellent use of x264. I have mentioned your rips as an example of how x264 should be used elsewhere. Just give up the mp4."
,myrrh81,2011-08-29T02:43Z,I prefer mp4's as they are directly playable and streamable on more devices than matroska. Namely PS3 and other such media player/servers.
