I want this to get out since I ripped it my self and want to share.  Sorry about the hectic seeding schedule.  I talked to them about it and they won't turn off my computer anymore."

,Dodgey17,2010-12-22T13:57Z,has copywrite protection that mutes the sound after about 20 minutes of the movie playing back on ps3 any ideas how to deal with this??

,KDizzo,2010-12-24T00:01Z,What I do is just play it through my laptop connected through HDMI to my tv and it works fine.  I can't think of why the sound would be off or why the PS3 would catch this for copyright protection.
,losmed33,2010-12-30T17:59Z,"did look as good as it did in the cinema, maybe I should buy the actual disc and see if its just the download or it this was a step behind the release int the movie theaters"
,Jimler,2011-02-28T16:00Z,"This file doe´sn´t work trough my TV´s DNLA.
The sound is off by 2-3 seconds DO NOT Download complete waste of TIME!!!"
,AtkinsD,2011-04-18T16:34Z,Awesome Stereoscopic Copy! Thanks!
,KDizzo,2011-04-29T06:46Z,"The copy that was uploaded is played through a very fast laptop through a HDMI 1.4 cable to a sterioscopic 3D Panasonic television.  As far as I know there are problems streaming from your computer to the PS3 as far as sound delay. There dosn't seem to be any issues as far as copyright protection because the version I uploaded, my copy still works fine today, with no delay or lag.  HDMI was only tested on 1.4.  I use MPC in direct 3D mode to play the file. 
Cheers and enjoy :)"
