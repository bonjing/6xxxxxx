The Human League - Don't You Want Me [Top of the Pops 1981].VOB



Very HQ rare "Top of the Pops" tv show promo performance. Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.

Each weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.

"Don't You Want Me" is a single by British synthpop group The Human League, released from their third album Dare on 27 November 1981. It is the band's best known and most commercially successful recording to date, topping the Billboard Hot 100 in the US on July 3, 1982 (where it stayed for three weeks), and was the Christmas number one in the UK where it sold over 1,400,000 copies, making it the 25th most successful single in UK Singles Chart history. Billboard magazine ranked it as the sixth-biggest hit of 1982.

The lyrics were originally inspired after lead singer Philip Oakey read a story in a "trashy tabloid". Originally conceived as a male solo, Oakey was inspired by the film A Star Is Born and decided to turn the song into a conflicting duet with one of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two teenage female vocalists. Susan Ann Sulley was asked to take on the role. Up until then, she and the other female vocalist Joanne Catherall had only been assigned backing vocals; Sulley says she was chosen only through luck of the draw. There are two more realistic explanations: that Sulley was the better singer and/or that Catherall, more introverted, shied away from the role.

Today, the song is widely considered a classic of its era. Oakey still describes it as overrated but acknowledges his initial dismissal was misguided and claims pride in the track. Susan Sulley is often irritated that she constantly has to refute the mistaken assumption that the song is a reference to her and Catherall. At only 17 years old when the song was recorded, she was legally too young by UK law to have been a cocktail waitress and was, in fact, still at school. Oakey is also at pains to point out another misconception that it is not a love song but "a nasty song about sexual power politics".
