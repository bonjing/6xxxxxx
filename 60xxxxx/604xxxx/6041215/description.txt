
The time has officially arrived.... "GSlaps presents The Jacka: GSlaps Radio Vol. 1" mixed by DJ Critical Hype and in collaboration with EscapeMTL. The mixtape is hosted by the man himself, The Jacka! This is the first musical project GSlaps.com/GSlaps Ent. has completed and it has been an honour for us to be able to work with The Jacka for our debut release. GSlaps Radio Volume 1 gives you a glimpse into Jacka's world, his thoughts, harsh realities, and truths. Shouts to Critical Hype for putting together my favorite Jacka tape.

Please make sure to purchase the album and support independent artists who have been providing us GREAT music for years. Keep checkin in at GSlaps.com for more releases.
