Kaya, was recorded at the same time as Exodus. 25 or so tracks were recorded and 2 albums were to be made. Exodus contained many of the harder songs, but also had some softer songs, but not as many here. for the Kaya album there were 15 tracks left, and the 10 originally released in 1978 were Love songs, and Homages to the Power of ganja. The band shows a rare different side that is actually quite beautiful. Out of all the Bob Marley and the Wailers album's this album sticks out in my mind because it is so much different than the others. the entire catalogue is unique, but Kaya really leaves a long lasting impression. everyone knows the song "Is this Love?", but many of the other songs are classics and should not be over looked. Sun is Shining, Kaya, Time Will Tell, Easy Skanking, and Running Away are all very good songs. If you are looking for something more unique and different this album is most certainly for you. If you are going to have a reggae collection, you shouldn't pass up on this recording because it is a real treat.
