,tennisbgc,2010-12-22T07:20Z,How does this compare to the 720p tv rip I know the quality wont be as good but was there more added to the dvd version
,gasland,2010-12-29T04:42Z,"I was the editor & co-creater of GASLAND -- this is the superior version of the movie, although I don't support this particular dissemination of the film.

,mwake,2011-02-10T09:55Z,"@gasland, I am downloading this because it is the only access I have to the movie. Is there somewhere I can donate money?"
,S0da.fr,2011-02-19T22:02Z,"@mwake just go on the website gasland gave and you'll have a link to donate.

Or go there : https://org2.democracyinaction.org/o/6791/t/10276/p/salsa/donation/common/public/?donate_page_KEY=2236"
,woodflute,2011-02-23T16:22Z,"We should all donate to the film maker when we download something like this. This is not in the same category as a Hollywood blockbuster, that has been bankrolled by millionaires. "
,Ricchh,2011-02-27T05:23Z,I agree about a donation being appropriate. What is a fair thing here? I mean how much? Just a guideline would be helpful.
,ChimChimtheOmni88,2011-06-19T22:40Z,"@Ricchh: Well, DVDs go for, what? $20 these days? That's what I would go with. But if you're as ricchh as your name implies you are, perhaps you could toss 'em a benjamin... I dunno... I don't have an income, so it's hard for me to gauge these things..."
