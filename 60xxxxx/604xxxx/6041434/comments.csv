Its a direct AVI file download... no rars and shit
And the size is only 162mb!!

why are u so afraid to download and view it urself!!
different people have different preference in porn so if i say this is bad u might say i'm wrong and u actually like this!!

My point s next time u come across a less than 200mb AVi file PORN MOVIE - STFU AND DOWNLOAD IT OR GTFO BITCH!!!"
,aj_D,2010-12-22T11:34Z,The point of having screen is you don't end up downloading the same shit again....
,jiten2906,2011-02-09T18:15Z,and that you have brains...
,i_crapped,2011-03-15T03:56Z,My my. Such hostility!
,funkingonutz,2011-03-17T14:26Z,"I agree with aj_D.  The reason for thumbs is so that people get an idea of what the video is.

""Vintage family Incest Porn!!"" isn't very detailed even as text descriptions go...

For example:  Is this a white, black, Asian, albino or aboriginal Australian family?  Is it a bunch of senior citizens in their 70s who are all brothers and sisters?  By ""Vintage"" is it in black and white?  Is it a nickle arcade rotoscope loop?

But I guess maybe ...""next time [I] come across a less than 200mb AVi file PORN MOVIE - [I should] STFU AND DOWNLOAD IT OR GTFO ...!!! ""

So I'll just set up a script in uTorrent to /Download every < 200 MB file on Pirate Bay/ eh?  Sure.  That's reasonable.

I think people need to be less defensive and hostile.  We're all together here in our yellow submarine trying to share happy bits and bytes of data."

,AmityStill,2011-10-09T23:36Z,is it just me or is there no sound?
