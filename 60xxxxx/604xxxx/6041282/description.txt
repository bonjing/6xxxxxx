Fine Young Cannibals - Good Thing [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Good Thing" is a song recorded by Fine Young Cannibals, the second single pulled from their album The Raw & the Cooked. The song was their second U.S. number one, topping the Billboard Hot 100 on 8 July 1989. It also peaked at #7 on the UK singles chart.

The song made its first appearance in the 1987 film Tin Men. Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a nightclub band in the movie, performing this song and three others (including the single's b-side "Social Security"). The film is set in Baltimore in 1963, and the song's retro-soul style is consistent with that setting.

This promo video features many scenes with motor scooters, both at rest and in motion as well as scooter culture. The scooters featured include stock scooters, as well as highly stylised scooters and minimalist cutdown scooters.
