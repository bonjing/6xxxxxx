,akindayimcan,2010-12-17T00:53Z,"thanks for this indian movie and no problem about dvd quality better than stupid aXXo's dvd rips :)=

i am waiting for your T-2 rip (especially from you)
and i think dont waste your time with social network it is so boring movie (in my opinion and a lot of people too) but absolutely it is your choice..

thanks for legends of guardians it is really good animation.."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-17T03:40Z,"@akindayimcan
welcome...and it may be slow bt its plot is good...and i hv got requests for it..plus to me the plot ""A story about the founders of the social-networking website, Facebook."" is very intresting...

@ashu
buddy now ur the uploader its ur choice now do whatever u like its ur decision..:)"
,akindayimcan,2010-12-17T07:21Z,"ok buddy...
just a little reminder and request you know legend of the guardians not a long movie around 95mins and it was 3D in theater.

i know and trustful to you. u can do your job very well good quality and small size but i think it can be delicious if you hold bitrate a little more than the other uploads maybe 1k-1.2k we can get the same taste with it...we would be needed high resolution in many places..what are u planing to bitrate and size dude ?

thanks in advance..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-17T08:37Z,"@akindayimcan
dont worry at all dude..its a 1gb file with 5.1 audio and video bitrate 1350...

i know which movie deserves what kind of treatment..:-)"
,akindayimcan,2010-12-17T10:47Z,thank you bro that is exactly what i am wating from u :)=
,.Dev,2010-12-17T11:13Z,"@All: need help...........
some 7 to 8 years past i saw a movie in star movies and i liked it very much n now i want to download it but cant recall the name of the movie. Anyone please help.........

plot-(which i can remember)-
it was a story of a man living in a small town. once he was out for shoping in an open market and was struck by a light from space (may be alien). After which he fainted and when he woke up he had some new power of extraordinary brain. As he was a farmer he grew big apple size tomatoes n other vegetables double from there original size. He could heal people using his powers. At the end he healed a dying boy using his powers and he himself died with that disease.


Please anyone who recognize this movie can inform me here or my email id is- Devasheesh07ee@gmail.com"
