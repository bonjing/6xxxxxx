,Jack_Raiden,2010-12-16T19:58Z,"Possibly the best HD (720p) BRRip available.
Quality 2300 Kbps 720p video. Pristine 400 Kbps 5.1 AAC audio.
Perfection. Thank You HDLiTE, thedarkrai & seeders!"
,SynapsisXXXX,2010-12-17T16:05Z,thanx a lot again HDLiTE... didn't expect such an early release.. :)
,Powerslave,2010-12-18T02:58Z,Watch for Cinavia Protection - Error#3
,adanoob,2010-12-20T01:43Z,hey check the audio!! its delaying like 5 to 7 sec after the lips movement!

Do not use Windows Media Player or KMPlayer. 
Play it with QuickPlayer or VLC Media Player, it works very well."
,vjordaan,2011-01-01T20:28Z,"By the way, tnks HDLite! Great quality as always"
,mansalmon,2011-01-12T04:45Z,"Thanks man. I hit 6 MB/s at one point, will seed after finished downloading!"
,mansalmon,2011-01-12T09:38Z,"Finished d/ling and took a lokok, quality is great. Continuing to seed and hope everyone does the same, thanks a lot darkrai :)"
,bubbagiant,2011-01-15T15:08Z,DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! This is a trap.  Sony sent me a copyright infringement email about this specific file.  HDLITE is a pawn.  DO NOT TRUST SOURCE!
,Plato202,2011-01-17T13:49Z,"Thank you thedarkrai, very good quality.  If you are downloading for use on the PS3, however, you might want to look elsewhere as it is Cinavia protected.  I've been searching tirelessly and there doesn't seem to be any easy fix for this at the moment..."
,Krabaman,2011-01-18T19:50Z,Great quality for HDlite!
,PaRiKaaLP,2011-01-19T15:12Z,gr8 quality in  2gb man.......
,jarrks,2011-01-23T21:56Z,"bubbagiant: Are you sure? I guess they just watch logs and if torrent name match their list they send automatic message to downloader. The question is, where they got your email address. Does your ISP have a contract with them? Think about using some encryption."
,ut-fon,2011-01-24T09:04Z,I had to emails like that nothing happened if you keep getting them your ISP can turn your service off for a year so after you get 2 of them stay clear for about 6 months PeerGuardian 2  helps keep you safe easy to use just block all and let it be and it will do the work for you not 100% but its some thing 
,TheBugMan,2011-01-27T07:11Z,THANKS!
,LCG1138,2011-01-28T17:37Z,"As Plato202 said, PS3 playback meets Cinavia protection..very clever. PC/Macintosh playback unaffected. Well, it's Sony protecting Sony I guess.. ;)"
,aharpoon22,2011-02-18T06:29Z,This file will not play on a PS3 console due to the Cinavia protection.  This is otherwise a great file!
,HardcoreAndMore,2011-02-18T19:22Z,"Thanks a bunch, Even with lots of subs. I needed the Dutch one ^^..

thanks again!"
,MoePower,2011-02-19T14:34Z,"A:10 V:10
Good quality"
,musicman1105,2011-02-28T15:50Z,"Thanks for this. Very good overall, but I think it's rather dark overall."
,skeptic4all,2011-04-01T23:25Z,Nice download. It is alittle dark. I had to adjust my monitor/TV settings. The audio was fine for me. 
,EiNST3iN,2011-04-02T05:27Z,what is the resolution of this file?
