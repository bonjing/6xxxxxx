Black Eyed Peas - The Time (The Dirty Bit) Lyrics
This is international
Big mega radio smasher!
Chorus:
Iâ€™ve had the time of my life
And Iâ€™ve never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you!
Oh, I have the time of my life
And Iâ€™ve never felt this way before
And I swear this is true
And I owe it all to you!
Dirty bit!
Dirty bit!
I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I donâ€™t wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots!
So come on, letâ€™s go!
Letâ€™s lose control!
Letâ€™s do it all night!
Until we can do it no more!
Keep on rocking to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gonâ€™ rock it to the top,
Until the roof come burninâ€™ down
Get hot in here
The temperature
Has got these ladies
Getting freakier
I got freaky, freaky, baby
I was chilling with my ladies
I didnâ€™t come to get boogie
I came here to get crazy!
I was born to get wild!
Thatâ€™s my style!
If you didnâ€™t know that,
Well, baby, now you know now
Cause Iâ€™m
Havinâ€™!
A good time!
With you!
Iâ€™m tellinâ€™ you!
Chorus: (x1)
Dirty bit!
Dirty bit!
All these girls they like my swagger
They call me Mick Jagger
Iâ€™ve been rolling like a stoned
Jet-setter, jet-lagger
We ainâ€™t messinâ€™ with no maggots
Messing with the baddest
Chicks in the club,
Honey, whatâ€™s up?
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Whoâ€™s the baddest of them all?
Itâ€™s gotta be the apple
Iâ€™m the mack daddy of them all
Haters better step back!
Ladies download your app
Iâ€™m the party application,
Rock it just like that!
This is international
Big mega radio smasher!
Cause Iâ€™m
Havinâ€™!
A good time with you, Iâ€™m telling you!
Chorus: (x4)
Dirty bit!
