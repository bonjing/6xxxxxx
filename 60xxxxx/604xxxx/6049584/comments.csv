,mudlord,2010-12-20T03:17Z,"If you have a JTAGed Xbox, should be obvious...."
,bezzlebub666,2010-12-20T12:27Z,i have a modded xbox no jtag
,abernick00,2010-12-20T19:58Z,so you have to have a JTAG'd box to do this? i've been doin' this for years and i thought you didnt.... someone should post a tutorial
,3lionsteam,2010-12-22T05:32Z,what do you do with that .file ?  my xbox is modded...ive never heard of this jtag biznis til now.  just want to play limbo!  any help would be very appriciated.
,TechnologicIce,2010-12-22T16:34Z,Thanks for this. Looks like other people are benefiting as well.
,gazkee,2010-12-28T03:40Z,"you need xbox jtag for starters, then with a flash drive put in the xm360 software in this you will see a default.xex file which you click on and there you will see scan files (for all XBLA games) viola it will show all xbla games on internal or external drive, there is also a unlock option with the XM360 program to unlock. hope this helps"
,Dirtyschwag,2011-01-05T04:37Z,Could you please upload super meat boy?
,misfisk,2011-02-19T09:36Z,"@Dirtyschwag: It's out for PC, and it's cheap as hell. For 14 EUR you get one of the best platformers ever made. You should really consider supporting the guys who made it.

It's kind of ridiculous that you have to pirate and emulate this game, when you actually want to support Playdead Studios. It's stupid, but it's important that Microsoft don't get their way with this one."
,Daky101,2011-05-06T17:44Z,"I have an X360 arcade so i don't have a hard drive.
Can I burn this to CD or DVD and then play it?
I burned a lot of X360 games on DVD DL and they all worked,but I have never burned XBLA game so far.
Please help."
