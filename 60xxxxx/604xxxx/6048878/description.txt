Nigella uses every trick in the book to make food that's delicious and as effortless as possible.

Nigella shows a speedy take on a French classic, tarragon chicken with steamed green beans, that's the work of moments and makes a perfect after work supper. She's taking the easy street to baking with an almost instant cream tea - 20 minute buttermilk scones served with clotted cream and golden syrup. Plus finally she's whipping up a fusion fiesta with Mexican lasagne and a cool green avocado salsa and no churn pina colada ice cream for dessert that makes light work of cooking dinner for a crowd.
