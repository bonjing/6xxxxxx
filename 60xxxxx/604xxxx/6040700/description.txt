The series follows the bonds of friendship among three life-long friends â€“ Joe, Owen and Terry â€“ who are now in their late 40s. Joe (Ray Romano) is a slightly neurotic separated father of two (Brittany Curran as Lucy, and Braeden Lemasters as Albert) who had hoped to become a pro golfer but now owns a party supply store, and has a gambling addiction. Owen (Andre Braugher) is an overstressed, diabetic husband and father, who works as a car salesman at the dealership owned by his father, a former NBA player. Terry (Scott Bakula) is a struggling actor, working temp jobs to make ends meet and usually dating much younger women. The friends are aware of each other's life struggles and show typical male reactions to life issues.
