[V],Kuthumi,2010-12-16T22:52Z,"Thank you! Good picture, stereo sound although a little hollow, typical for authentic R5. To you non-believers: Uploader has a pink skull, meaning he can be trusted. Click his username on top to see all his good torrents."

V-8

currently watching it on a 47"" LCD, audio isnt to bad, unless your listening to it solely to judge the quality it wont bother you. the video is just like most of the dvd rips, slightly grainy but VERY VERY watchable

thanks BON for the rip and chico for the great preview"

,audi_gal,2011-01-03T07:01Z,"V:8 
A:7 

watched it on a 50"" LCD..pretty clear for a R5 or early release..overall pretty good and watchable!"
,bilbo_blaggins,2011-01-09T12:49Z,"Unstoppable 2010 [SCR.XviD-film] [ENG] dont download this torrent it is an absolute proper fake on a hacked account, asks you to download coralplayer, i didnt, so fuck knows what would happen just dont be curious"
,DaveyFnA,2011-02-02T21:34Z,I was tracked and notified by my ISP using this torrent.
,Kanano,2011-02-21T05:08Z,"Guys, to avoid getting tracked by your ISP, just rename the file after you've downloaded it, and maybe try converting it so the file size changes because they know the file size too. Winavi can do this. I did that with Predators after Charter sent me a copyright notice, after renaming and changing the size, even though it was still on my computer, they didn't send a second notice. "
