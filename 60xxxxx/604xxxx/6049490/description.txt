â€œCarlos Bica + Prima MatÃ©riaâ€ confirms Bica as one of Portugalâ€™s most important
jazz musicians and reaffirms his key role in the development of new perspectives
for Portuguese jazz. The CD is packed with songs recorded at three memorable
concerts in three memorable locations, Culturgest, Casa da MÃºsica, and the
Orient Museum.

In this project, one of the most challenging of his career, Bica gives rein to
his enormous talent as an arranger and songwriter, achieving a remarkable
balance between folk elements and a unique vision for modern jazz. In eight
original songs and two covers â€” one from Marc Ribot and a Ry Cooder classic,
â€œParis Texasâ€ â€” all conceived as launching pads for improvisation, â€œCarlos Bica
+ Prima MatÃ©riaâ€ is a kaleidoscope of strong emotions and is a brilliant
document of unique events.

For these concerts Bica, who is an established jazz bassist in Portugal and
Berlin (he splits his time between these two locations), recruited three
versatile Portuguese musicians, pianist JoÃ£o Paulo, guitarist MÃ¡rio Delgado, and
drummer JoÃ£o Lobo. To that stew he mixed in the young trumpeter Matthias
Shriefl,a rising presence in the new German jazz. Together they expand Bicaâ€™s
extraordinary musical universe, a constellation that spans jazz, blues, rock,
pop and ambient music. This original sound world moves the listener through the
landscapes of the great spaces, evoking artists as diverse as Ry Cooder, Michael
Nyman, Radiohead, Carla Bley, Bill Frisell, and Tom Waits. With a discography
punctuated by such standout recordings as â€œAzulâ€ (considered by many to be the
â€œgreatâ€ album of Portuguese jazz), â€œBelieverâ€ and â€œSingleâ€ (exceptional solo
bass recording), Bica continues to innovate and surprise.

Here he continues a multifaceted career that has led him to collaborate with
artists such as Maria JoÃ£o, Carlos do Carmo, JosÃ© MÃ¡rio Branco, CamanÃ©, Pedro
Caldeira Cabral, Janita SalomÃ©, Ray Anderson, Kenny Wheeler, Aki Takase, Lee
Konitz, Alexander von Schlippenbach, Albert Mangelsdorf, Joey Baron, Matthias
Schubert, John Zorn, Paolo Fresu, and Markus Stockhausen, among many
others. What surprises him more than their individual qualities as musicians, he
says, â€œis the emotional intelligence that distinguishes the different ways of
telling a story through the raw material that sound is.
