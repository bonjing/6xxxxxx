,cleanuploads,2010-12-18T15:07Z,"This seems to be installed the same way as it's counterpart Farming Simulator, which means once a patch comes out follow these instructions;

1. Open RegEdit and use the find tool to find DemolitionCompanyDE_is1 once you have found this rename it to DemolitionCompanyEN_is1, save and close RegEdit

2. Download the english version patch and install it

3. Run the Game.

Hopefully this still works when a patch is released."

,The77s,2011-01-24T08:27Z,"Demolition Company Installation Guide

1. Burn or Mount DemolitionCompany ISO.
2. Install Demolition Company.
3. Start Demolition Company, when prompted for the Serial Key, enter: 8QY3J-CPQ7Q-PM2ET-ALL83-FENMQ
4. Finished, have fun playing Demolition Company.

Notes: The game is in German, luckily it isn't a very text based game, but you may have to do some guessing work if you aren't fluent in German. To run this game, you will need to Mount the DemolitionCompany ISO every time you wish to play."
,Slipps,2011-01-26T21:11Z,"I've never had a prob before using torrents at all, half my games are from here. I downloaded this twice, extracted and tried everything I knew to get this to work. Theres simply not a mountable image in there that I can find and nothing else seems to do anything."
,Slipps,2011-01-26T22:35Z,"Download, extract, get two things= a bin file and text doc saying hi folks this is your product key. WTF am I supposed to do with that?"
,Slipps,2011-01-27T01:19Z,"Ok after 5th time I gave up and tried magic ISO, converted the bin to an ISO and bam, there it was. Daemon for some reason didn't work"
,braduz,2011-02-01T18:54Z,thast because deamon tools is shit
,lazerxxx1,2011-02-02T05:41Z,"Alcohol 52% has been workin like a charm for me, and Winmount works really nice to. Leaching now."
,lazerxxx1,2011-02-02T05:42Z,"Alcohol 52% has been workin like a charm for me, and Winmount works really nice to. Leaching now.
I also leave my machine and BitTorrent running 24/7, so I know I seed :)"
,pezzie2,2011-02-02T15:26Z,"just rename the "".bin"" file to ---> .ISO

then Deamon tools works =)"
,Snowwie888,2011-02-09T22:09Z,bin or iso files can simply be extracted with the latest version of Winrar. 
,Snowwie888,2011-02-10T01:50Z,"Alright, I got the solution for this problem:

This is a single bin file. It is useless without a cue file. There you need a program to convert the bin file to an iso file. Here you can get it:

http://www.weethet.nl/english/cdrw_bintoiso.php

An iso file can be burned with Nero, or with the Windows 7 built in burner directly.

The key is:
8QY3J-CPQ7Q-PM2ET-ALL83-FENMQ"
,braduz,2011-02-14T21:43Z,or insted of going through all that effort just change the bin film with 'ISO.' and there u have it
,farmorsmor,2011-02-24T23:14Z,"you guys are really RETARDS!!!!!
if you say that you can't find the file with daemon tools!
you can choose it to show all files, because technically a .bin file is NOT an image file...
set daemon-tools to show all files (yes there is a button to choose that....)"
,Gregy17,2011-03-26T13:00Z,guys i have a prob. when i install (i rename the .bin to .iSO and it works..) the game and enter serial it says its valid but then it just says there is some Surface Cache FAil and that i need to contackt giant about 53810 error code.... anyone knows what to do??
,kingnut,2011-03-31T04:59Z,Anyone found a No CD crack for the game
,spiderbomb23,2011-04-14T12:24Z,"Whare i can find the English patch?

,Breemanssam,2011-05-09T17:11Z,"Could anybody please upload a mac version?
