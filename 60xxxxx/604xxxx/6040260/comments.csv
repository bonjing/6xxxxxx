I got stuck at 96 % for 2 weeks and there is no one I can ask, but you. Please seed. I'll seed for a week at least."

Also will you please seed for some more time 
Netherlands vs Russia at Euro 2008. I have now 
96% and am dying to see this great game. There
was only one seeder, so the speed was quite slow."
