Plot:

On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming
genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins
working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what
begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a
revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends
later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but
for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal
complications.
