           Jim on the origins of The Tale of the Bunny               
         Picnic: "Now the idea for this started one evening          
         when my daughter Cheryl and I were sitting in a             
         park at twilight. And while we were sitting there           
         a whole big bunch of bunny rabbits came hopping             
         out looking to all the world like they were gonna           
         have a meeting or convention or something. About            
         that time a great big dog showed up on the scene,           
         he saw the rabbits he started barking like mad.             
         The rabbits of course dissapeared in a flash.               
         Cheryl and I thought it might be fun to make up             
         a story about what had just happened, and from              
         that notion came 'The Tale of the Bunny Picnic'.            
         And this tale starts with a phrase like many other          
         good stories, "Once upon a time..."                         
                                                                     
           This developed into the universe presented here,          
         with Bean Bunny as the protagonist, a character             
         which would later appear in The Jim Henson Hour             
         and Muppet*Vision 3D. Bean was performed by Steve           
         Whitmire, previously known primarily for his work           
         on Fraggle Rock (Wembley Fraggle and Sprocket),             
         who would later go on to take over many of Jim's            
         characters after his passing (including, perhaps            
         most importantly, Kermit).

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.
