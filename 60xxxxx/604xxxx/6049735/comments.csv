,gazkee,2010-12-28T03:38Z,"you need xbox jtag for starters, then with a flash drive put in the xm360 software in this you will see a xex file which you click on and there you will see scan files (for all XBLA games) viola it will show all xbla games on internal or external drive, there is also a unlock option with the XM360 program to unlock. hope this helps"
