RELEASE NOTES

WinEdt is a powerful and versatile text editor for
Windows with a strong predisposition towards the
creation of [La]TeX documents

WinEdt is used as a front-end for compilers and
typesetting systems, such as TeX or HTML. WinEdt's
highlighting schemes can be customized for different
modes and its spell checking functionality supports
multi-lingual setups, with dictionaries (word-lists)
for many languages available for downloading from
WinEdt's Community Site www.winedt.org

Although WinEdt is reasonably suitable as an
all-purpose text editor it has been specifically
designed and configured to integrate seamlessly with
a TeX System (such as MiKTeX or TeX Live). WinEdt
documentation does not cover TeX related topics in
depth. You'll find introductions and manuals on
typesetting with [La]TeX, as well as links to other
recommended accessories, on TeX's Community Site
(TUG)

Major new features in WinEdt 6.0:
* WinEdt's Interface (toolbar) has changed. A single
button is now used to select and start the TeX
Compiler of your choice. The drop-down menu allows
you to choose from PDFLaTeX, LaTeX, XeTeX, TeX
AMSTeX, etc... Once you make your choice you can
start the selected compiler by clicking on the
button
* The new interface also features context-sensitive
Compile and Preview buttons. Their meaning for TeX
documents can be configured through the Execution
Modes Interface
* Configuration Filters are used to make Menu Items
and Toolbars visible or invisible depending on the
configuration choice (MiKTeX, Tex Live, HTML
etc...)
* Console Applications are by default executed in
WinEdt's own Console Window. This can be
customized in the Execution Modes interface
* Highlighting now allows specification of
environment-sensitive background colors
* Support for compiling MetaPost documents and
Documented LaTeX (DTX)
* And there is more
