Comments :
Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega are two hitmen who are out to retrieve a suitcase 
stolen from their employer, mob boss Marsellus Wallace. Wallace has also asked 
Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out 
of town. Butch Coolidge is an aging boxer who is paid by Wallace to lose his next 
fight. The lives of these seemingly unrelated people are woven together comprising 
of a series of funny, bizarre and uncalled-for incidents.
