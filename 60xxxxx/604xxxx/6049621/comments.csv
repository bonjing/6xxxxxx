,PitchblakToxic7,2011-01-12T09:31Z,"JTAG only, Copy unrar'ed folder to HDD1/Content/0000000000000000/ via FTP or Partition 3/Content/0000000000000000/ via Xplorer360 or whatever."

With XBLA games, if you dont already know how to install it, you wont be able to use it. These require JTAG-modified consoles to use because the content file is locked to DRM enabled Xbox-live profiles and the only way for a retard like you to install it in the first place is JTAG your XBox, and to do that you would need to know at least the slightest thing about how your console works.

So excuse me, there isnt any way for a retard like you to make any use of it. 

All you did with that obscene and ignorant post is advertise how similar you are to a monkey that bashes a cellphone on a rock in frustration for the lack of understanding its use. You fail at life, in my opinion, which is a much more informed opinion than yours.

Thank you, mudlord, for making this available for those of us on the internet with half a braincell, and the ability to at the very least GOOGLE things that we don't immediately understand."

read ur post a few times and see if u can find the irony
