 Album Info..: 
 
 A great collection of early songs, including a lot of Syd Barret's creations. 
 Less darker than The Pipper at the Gates of Dawn this songs are quite good and some of them you can't find in studio in any other album. 
 The Highlight is "See Emily Play". Has its own value, besides the collectors natural interest.
