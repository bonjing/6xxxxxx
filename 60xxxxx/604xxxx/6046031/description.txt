Twilight of the Idols (In Conspiracy with Satan) is the sixth album by Norwegian black metal band Gorgoroth. It was released in 2003 through Nuclear Blast and reissued in 2006 through Back on Black Records.

This is the first album on which Infernus was not the main song writer. Instead, the music for this album was composed by bassist King ov Hell and drummer Kvitrafn. The album cover is a depiction of a burning church, but due to the controversy caused by this, some copies of the album feature a picture of the band members instead.
