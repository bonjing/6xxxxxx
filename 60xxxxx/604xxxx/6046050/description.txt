 Balthazar Blake (Nicolas Cage) is a master sorcerer in modern-day Manhattan  
 trying to defend the city from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath (Alfred       
 Molina). Balthazar can't do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (Jay       
 Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as     
 his reluctant protÎ˜gÎ˜. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash   
 course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely         
 partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It'll take all the courage     
 Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as   
 he becomes The Sorcerer's Apprentice.
