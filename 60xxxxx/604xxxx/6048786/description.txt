Here you have Disc 2 of 4 - anyone have useful comments on how to decrypt Disc 3 and 4 - email me: Bluelady45@gmail.com

I used DVD43, 1clickDVDcopy5, DVDdecrypter with no success.  Also tried Roxio and ConvertXtoDVD with no success.

So this is it... for the moment :)


Please seed for a few days at least... Thanks, and enjoy!
