,lozzer22,2010-12-15T17:00Z,"lol I'v had no issues with New Vegas since day 1 but meh, thanks for the upload."
,RavenTrigun,2010-12-15T23:00Z,Thanks New Vegas Script Extender wouldn't let me use it without the latest patch.
,EvilCorporateWhore,2010-12-16T05:05Z,"@RavenTrigun

That's why i came here, too. lol

I hope it will work after this update's installed. Thanks AiTB."
,Maakus88,2010-12-16T21:20Z,Is it neccessary to install the previous patches or does this one contain all that is needed?
,OmniNegro,2010-12-17T05:24Z,This contains all the previous fixes. You do not need the previous patches.
,Leechless,2010-12-17T10:40Z,"Great work AiTB!
I also have been awaiting this for the Script Extender.
AiTB, are you aware that someone by the name of italianoo_vero has created a near exact replica of this torrent's page and is infected with a virus? Search Fallout New Vegas and it's the most recent one."
,duckboy81,2010-12-17T12:49Z,"@leechless - yeah i didnt take notice so i dl the wrong one and it completely crashed my machines with BSOD even in failsafe mode. I had essentials and spyware doctor running fully updated and still... God damn dont know what do to with it ? Anyone ?!

Props to AiTB for great work and clean releases - youre the man !!!"
,Daimon117,2010-12-17T16:50Z,"Guys I installed all the files into my fallout folder. I am currently using a non-steam version of fallout that i got from Skidrow but no matter what I do it always gives me ""Steam Error"" ""Application load error 5:0000065434"". If anyone could tell me exactly what i'm meant to be doing with the files or how i can prevent this error without using steam please tell me."
,CJoker3221,2010-12-18T08:01Z,"@Daimon117 Did you put the cracks inside Fallout New Vegas folder? Also, I've been getting lag since Update number 3, and this update lags my game as well but when I played with no update, no lag ruined my game. I'm using ATI Radeon 5570."
,MindFlip,2010-12-18T11:46Z,for some reason the game is crashing more often with the last update... something with the crack?
,bloodred125,2010-12-18T13:32Z,"can someone please clarify that you dont need to download all the other updates, because they all seem to be different sizes so if this included all of them wouldnt this file be like 400 mb or something or more to cater for all the other updates?"
,bloodred125,2010-12-18T13:34Z,are you sure you dont have to use the other updates including this? because this file is actually smaller than a few of the other updates.
,toenail77,2010-12-18T13:39Z,Thanks AiTB!
,toenail77,2010-12-18T13:41Z,bloodred125 u dont need all the patches - just because its smaller means absolutely nothing
,Regonred,2010-12-18T14:32Z,"Why am I getting this?

Help please. Thanks."
,KC1337,2010-12-18T17:08Z,"@duckboy81 , i got the same problem with you. i dl the other torrent and now my pc is crushed. plz if u manage to fix yours tell me how,its important .thank you"
,OmniNegro,2010-12-18T20:44Z,Use Google to find out what the sfv is for. Grow up. It is quite simple.
,duckboy81,2010-12-18T23:14Z,"@KC1337 I Reinstalled my machine ... tried a couple of things first (antivirus rescue disks etc), but nothing helped... sorry"
,Radolfz,2010-12-20T14:40Z,Great Upload no problem for me
,on99gamble,2010-12-20T17:32Z,"As stated in the important information section in the update-4-installer:-
This update don't require previous updates installed to function properly"
,2thumbsup,2010-12-21T12:36Z,can anyone help my game crashes during loading. even after patching up and copying the crack. it says LauncherNV has stoped working.
,ForeuZe,2010-12-24T19:20Z,"Looks like this update added more troubles than fixes, my game crashes every single time I engage a trade with any kind of merchant / dealer, with or without mods, NVSE or whatever, doesn't work in any way."
,phobrek,2010-12-25T16:06Z,"When using the original Skidrow FNV, the game works for me (though it has its crashes, etc.); when using Updates 3 or 4 (I haven't tried 2), characters' skin turns flat pink and other textures get changed. Anyone know how to fix this?"
,phobrek,2010-12-25T16:37Z,"I should clarify: characters' skin is pink, and objects (including ground, clothes, walls, items, etc.) pick up neighboring objects' textures (including pink, if a character's skin is next to the ground or static object)."
,phobrek,2010-12-25T17:43Z,"Follow-up... sorry for the multi-posts - I finally got it to work. If people are having the same problem, go to http://www.thenexusforums.com/index.php?/topic/261613-patch-broke-your-texturesmods/ (even if you don't have any mods loaded). Hopefully it will work (you may need to use the second SArchive list mentioned, if your list has ""AII-FNV.bsa"" rather than archiveinvalidation). May not work for you, but it did me.

Thanks for the uploads!"
,phobrek,2010-12-25T17:51Z,"One last comment... I just checked and found that Steam is now offering FNV for just $25 for the next day or so. So after all the hassle, I'm gonna buy anyway (but I might not have ever bought it if I didn't play it at length via torrent first!)."
,Mercer47,2010-12-27T13:52Z,Did anybody try to run this with the script extender (NVSE)?
,roakfurt,2010-12-29T20:36Z,"If anyone is getting a ""Application error 5:00000*****"", just go back to the crack folder in the original .iso and drag it to where your game is installed. It worked for me."
,Etaan5,2011-01-01T10:30Z,"Perfect torrent....... gotta love SKIDROW

=)"
,TroBeleave,2011-01-03T08:00Z,"I got everything to work with out errors popping up but when i load the game right befor the menu apears still on the loading screens NV crashes i open with NVSE does anyone know of a way to fix or a workaround 

-Faithless"
,asestar2,2011-01-05T14:43Z,I am hoping this is patch version 1.2.0.314? Looking forward to it!
,Aduem,2011-01-25T20:21Z,"when i move i lagg, same when i shoot, i already tried using d3d9.dll but didn't help"
[V],matimike,2011-02-04T02:07Z,thanks
,Ramendia,2011-02-04T04:08Z,"I tried running the latest verson of NVSE with this update installed, and I'm getting the message that I need to install the latest update.  Is there a more recent update than this one?"
,dxfoleyalf27,2011-02-10T06:20Z,"I know this has nothing to do with the update, but I posted this in the main upload's comments without response, so possibly someone reading here can help me:

After messing around in the settings, I've realized that there is no way (at least that I can see) to use a joystick rather than the keyboard/mouse. And after playing Fallout 3 on console, I just can't get used to using the keyboard to move around.

The only option I have is to change the buttons for the joystick in the action mapping setting, but it doesn't actually let me choose it.

Someone please help and tell me I'm an idiot for missing something completely obvious :("
,Tornd,2011-02-14T20:52Z,"@ dxfoleyalf27  There's no really good way to make a 360 controller work with Bethesda games on the PC, but try a program called Xpadder. It's freeware and you can set it up to turn your buttons into keys or mouse movements.

I just recommend getting used to the PC controls though. Been there moving from 360 to PC in Oblivion and it gets easier once you set your own controls and play for a bit."
,dxfoleyalf27,2011-02-16T01:03Z,"@Tornd Thanks for the info. It's not that my controller (which is a Logitech more similar to ps3 than xbox, if that matters) doesn't work...it's just that it doesn't even let me choose to select ""Joystick"", which sucks lol. It just doesn't make any sense.

I'll check out Xpadder and see if it works, and if not, I suppose I'll try and get used to using the keyboard, which for a ps3 user just feels unnatural lol. I appreciate the response, and if you or anyone else has any more help it would be great appreciated!"
,KatalystCam,2011-02-18T09:06Z,"So im reasonably new to this whole pirating games thing ive done a few. Just one question, im downloading this right now: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5896532/Fallout.New.Vegas-SKIDROW-%5Btracker.BTARENA.org%5D.iso
then this crack here should make everything run perfectly right? thanks again! 
(win 7 64 bit)"
,larry27,2011-02-19T16:58Z,does it update game to 1.2 version and fix the freeze issue.
,dballaz,2011-02-25T15:54Z,"I have this problem when I update my New Vegas with any of the updates(1-5) I get a huge mouse cursor lag and I don't even have my v-sync on. I can run the game with the settings set on Ultra with above 60 fps and I use the d3d9.dll thingy for compatibility reasons because I have an ATI 5870 card.

I had barely any performance issues before the updates and if I can't find the problem I'll have to play the game unpatched which kinda sucks so anyone have any suggestions what might be the problem? "
,NephilimNexus,2011-04-10T10:40Z,"File seems to work perfectly.  Only problem I have is that the NVSE still insists that game still needs an update.  This update still works fine, though.  Is there another one after this I wonder?"
,BlackOpsPost,2011-04-11T05:49Z,"PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME!! SORRY FOR THE GAY CAPS LOCK BUT I REALLY NEED HELP. I took this downloaded it and ran one of the .exe's and it installed on my NV directory fine. When I went to my game, it gives me this erroe code: Application Load error 5:0000065434. I searched google, no help. Was I supposed to run all 15 .exe files? What do I do with the .sfu file? Why are there so many sr-fnvu4 files? I hope you'll be a good person and help me. I would be REALLY REALLY grateful. Thank you for reading."
,BlackOpsPost,2011-04-11T06:01Z,"@roakfurt in doing so, will it delete my mods/gamesaves? thanks for responding."
,SilentK1ller,2011-04-20T18:08Z,Nice upload thank you!
