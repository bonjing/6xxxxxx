Rippers Notes:
Audio delayed to start after 3rd lion roar during intro. I used a CBR 320kbps single-track rip of
Dark Side Of The Moon for the audio, and looped it 2.25 times to fit the length of the movie. For
video encode I used an uncompressed NTSC source of Wizard Of Oz.

From WIKI:
"Dark Side of the Rainbow (also known as Dark Side of Oz or The Wizard of Floyd) refers to the pair-
ing of the 1973 Pink Floyd music album The Dark Side of the Moon with the visual portion of the
1939 film The Wizard of Oz. This produces moments where the film and the album appear to corre-
spond with each other. The title of the music video-like experience comes from a combination of the
album title and the film's song "Over the Rainbow". It is also a reference to the rainbow from a pr-
ism design on the cover of the Pink Floyd album. Band members and others involved in making of the
album state that any relationship between the two works of art is merely a coincidence. "
