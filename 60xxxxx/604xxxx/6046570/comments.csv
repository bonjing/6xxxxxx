""Deep Fritz Twelve-SKIDROW"" release 
Thx SKIDROW"
,babochak,2011-03-14T17:12Z,This torrent contains fritz 12 engine which is not activated (see instollation notes above) and so works at only limited  search depth. Further Norton File insight says the crack is malacious. Another Torrent is available which contains fully functional engine and has clean crak at http://fenopy.com/torrent/Deep+Fritz+12/MzAzNTY0MA. I have downloaded and now seeding the good one. Good Luck Folks.
,babochak,2011-03-14T18:24Z,I am sorry the torrent reffered by me is Fritz 12 not Deep version. Can anybody post activated fully functional Deep Fritz 12 engine.
,Konobarcek,2011-04-14T19:59Z,"I highly recommend that you use rybka 4 engine and rybka's opening book as well.. I started the engine match rybka 4 vs fritz 12(10 min. per game) and result was 6-0 for rybka.. 
Here are the links:http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5600527/Deep_Rybka_4_32-bit_and_64-bit_Engines

,pappla,2011-04-19T19:32Z,is this not the same as just downloading it directly from chessbase without activation?
,WolfPunk,2011-04-21T00:54Z,"With all due respect to well-meaning babochak, this torrent Does Work. Choose Custom Install and check-mark everything.  Apply the Crack from the installed program, not the Iso.  Move all the engines to the right hand box, Except Deep Fritz 12.  The green dot below the engine will tell you its working.
Brilliant Up.  Thanks, man."
,fanx4free,2011-06-04T22:08Z,Why is there so many sr-df12m files to un rar??
,Dragon8000,2011-08-09T11:30Z,thanks
,daegen999,2011-08-25T02:09Z,Will this multiprocessor version work with a regular windows pc?
,BigUglyMotha,2011-09-22T00:29Z,"Well I tried this and I can only say it sucks. I get messages all the time about how this isn't a ""authorized"" version and it show. I never see my 8 processors working and I beat fritz often. Infact the engine sucks, so I don't think this version is working it's just a weaker version of the real thing."
,WolfPunk,2011-12-31T02:21Z,"@BigUglyMotha - You can't set up the program correctly and you're boasting that you beat Fritz's chess engine often?  Bullshit! There is no ""Moron"" level in this program. As I said above:  Under ENGINE in the 'Toolbar' click ""Engine Management"" and move all except 'Deep Fritz 12' to the right-hand panel. The program (on my gear) says 8 CPU's  Stop ragging and lying. Go to your mother's purse, as usual, and buy the fucking software, bitch. Happy New Year..."
