  Additional Notes:

  If you want to use this without having the DVD in the drive,
  copy the content on the DVD to your drive. Browse and locate it, when you're being asked to insert the TALK or VIDEO CD.
  You can also select custom/complete install during setup. To get around that issue.  

Why in rar? Because iso is 4.32 GB.
Rared is only 3.80 GB. So why not save 500 MB ;-)
I downloaded it from a private site.
Credits deserved by all who keep seeding it. Cheers.
