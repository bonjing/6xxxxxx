,x0xox1,2010-12-19T16:23Z,"Not fake, but the video plays for me with no sounds. Any thoughts?

Thanks for the upload!

,Nedyahwerd,2010-12-19T16:43Z,"Video looks great. Cannot get audio though. Tried using Divx, Winamp, Quicktime, and Nero Showtime. Video only worked on Nero and Quick."
,co42,2010-12-20T02:57Z,"Definitely not fake, works fine. Sound works with VLC."
,sniper457,2010-12-22T00:52Z,Awesome thanks. Part 2 upload anytime soon?
,Basnagus,2010-12-22T04:05Z,its the real deal ... v/a-10 .. FYI only plays on VLC .. doesn't work on most players including MPC home cinema ...   great up thnx alot can't wait for part 2  
,eviltomatoes,2010-12-22T09:39Z,"episode 2 is tomorrow night. and i now noticed what the audio problem is, it's AC3 audio in MP4 container which is really bad idea. quickest fix would be to re-mux this file into MKV. anyways. i'll use AAC audio for episode 2 so it shouldn't have this problem"
,pengy1979,2010-12-23T12:54Z,any chance of getting these in standard deff???
,Basnagus,2010-12-31T04:28Z,thnx alot ... great job .. plays fine great quality 10/10
,jayhan123,2011-01-09T09:00Z,What's a good way to remux this into a file with working audio?  SuperC isn't working with it -- causes too many skips.
,CoBrit,2011-01-24T15:58Z,For some reason Part 1 is a collection of RAR files that I am unable to - multiple errors. A shame.
