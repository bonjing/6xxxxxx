[T],artpepper,2010-12-17T03:41Z,"@dkhere, I could be wrong but I think it's an R5 with CAM audio...be nice to get some A/V comments, though..."
,shan1992,2010-12-17T04:30Z,iz it cam audio
[T],artpepper,2010-12-17T04:30Z,"OK, downloaded it.

V/9

A/4

The sound is pretty awful but what you'd expect from a CAM, I guess. The picture is very good, though."
,dkhere,2010-12-17T08:04Z,"@artpepper: From the comments, i think you are right..
I really wanted to watch this movie...
They are not releasing it here..."

,chris_blake6,2010-12-17T19:24Z,"Good copy, great picture quality, but audio goes out with about 20 minutes remaining for about 15 seconds, and when it comes back it's out of sync. Thanks for the upload though!"
,fightoffyour_demons,2010-12-18T00:49Z,"Meant to get back to the A/V last night, just got busy. 

A: 6
V: 9

I gave the Audio a 6 because, like a couple have said, it goes out of sync. In hour in, it goes out for about 15 seconds && then the remaining 30 mins are out of sync.

Other than that, good copy. Well worth it if you wanna see this and dont wanna shell out the 10 bucks at a theater. "
