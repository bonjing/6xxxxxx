SUMMARY:
The story is about a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two 
are left as well as one adopted white man. These three men refuse to enter 
the militia for Britain in 1757 for they want freedom. On their way to Kentucky,

two daughters of an British Colonel on their way to a fort. The three men
