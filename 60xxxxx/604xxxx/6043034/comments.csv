Features:
- Nostalgic interface. (Cool!)
- Horrible voice acting. (Oh...)
- Text and speech doesn't come along. (Urgh...)
- No ship parts info. (Wha...!?)

But still interesting game."
,degusto,2010-12-16T11:44Z,"Yep, the first Gemini scenario/campaign is crashing after the update1, kinda sad, because i don't like to start playing from the middle /

Niestety cały czas pierwsza kampania/scenariusz nie odpala nawet po update1, choć można zacząć od drugiej, ale czy jest sens zaczynać od środka? 

Bollocks"
,klord2010,2010-12-16T14:44Z,Oh! You can right click on items and it'll show you the spec and description.
