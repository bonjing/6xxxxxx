,istrahd,2011-03-01T03:55Z,"Thank you for the rip.  EXCELLENT QUALITY!  I will keep this running on my seedbox for quite some time to come.

Thanks for your time & trouble in ripping this.  I will definitely being going through your profile and finding more to get from you.  

I was very happy to find some of the other DC Universe movies in your collection.  Even though I have the DVDFab rips of some of them, I will download all of them so I can have them all in higher quality and be able to watch them in any room.  I have one or more computers in every room except the bathroom and if it werent for humidity, there would be one in there as well, LOL."
