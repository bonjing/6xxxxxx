,PeterIsWiggin,2011-02-18T23:51Z,I heard there were two versions of this movie: one original and one edited for the homophobic/US-release version. Anyone know if any of these torrents on here are the original (real) version? I'm not specifically looking for man-on-man action but I heard it was a good movies and would prefer seeing it as it was meant to be seen; just like I seek out director's cuts and would prefer not to see films shot at 16:9 in some other aspect ratio. Is this the original one? Is the original out there as a torrent?

You dont need code, just two spaces before and after the link.

And you cant display images in your description area.

Great torrent though! Thanks!"

Great upload, thanks!"
