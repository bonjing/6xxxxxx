Are you a college senior terrified to graduate? Or a freshman with a lot of foresight? This is the book you need to make sure your first step into the real world takes you in the right direction (and to start thinking ahead to that second step!). You'll get advice from the director of Career Services at one of the hottest Ivy League schools in the country (Brown) and advice from such experts as the head of recruiting from PriceWaterhouseCoopers. You'll read the stories of people who just a few years ago were standing exactly where you are, and are now establishing themselves at dotcoms, consulting firms, Fortune 500 companies, and other companies in every industry-even in the theater and music scene!.................................................................
