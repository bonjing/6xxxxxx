On this live dvd Solaris plays most of the material from the Nostradamus album. Though the music is complex, with some non-rock instruments included and a classical Hungarian opera singer, the liver versions of the songs are extremely well played and the band stands comfortable on stage. There are some light effect in the background to compensate for the lack of a rock'n performance of the band.

This was a bit of a disappointment. The material of the Nostradamus album is played very professional, but the concert is only 45 minutes or so. I call that halve a concert, and it makes 25 euro way to expensive.

The extra's aren't very interesting. Some short documentary about a ship on the bottom of the see with the album version of Nostradamus as a sound track and a documentary about the band (so it seems) that has no subtitles, which makes it very boring since I can't understand Hungarian very well.
