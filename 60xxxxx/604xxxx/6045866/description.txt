The sons of a patient killed by a doctor on call in Cambridgeshire set out to discover if it could happen again.

If you need a doctor when the surgery is shut who will be sent to see you? The doctor who called at David Gray's Cambridgeshire home killed him. Today his sons Stuart and Rory Gray set out to discover if their father's death has resulted in improvements in out of hours care. Uncovered are other near-fatal medical blunders by doctors on call. Patients failed by those in positions of trust, some of whom are still working in the service. Other victims who survived Dr Ubani's treatment tell their story. The Grays' investigations have led to some changes, including an overhaul of checks on overseas doctors and a challenge to rules allowing doctors struck off here from still working abroad. Even so across England, patients still lack confidence in the service.
