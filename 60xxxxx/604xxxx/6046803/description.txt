Plot:

Siva (Dhanush) is a happy-go-lucky young boy in a large joint family of three elder brothers. Siva is the son of one of the brothers and studies from a hostel away from home. Dhanush is always helpful and always comes in when others need him. In one of his obliging acts he helps his cousin sister to elope with her lover against the family choice and this annoys the large family and he is asked to stay away.
On another occasion, here also to help a friend, Siva kidnaps Pooja (Genelia) on a mistaken identity from the marriage hall. When Pooja is kidnapped her uncles and their henchmen follow them. Pooja while on the run tells Siva that she wasnâ€™t interested in the marriage and her uncles are forcing her marriage with one of their sons only to seize her properties. Pooja refuses to go back and is resolute to stay with Siva. Later Siva also falls in love with Pooja and determines to marry her only with the consent of all the members of both families.
How Siva manages to convince the elders of the families and the methods he adopts to smoothen their hearts is rest of the story.
