,night1982,2010-12-17T08:10Z,"Is this a bisarre joke? The filename is too long and I cannot download this one... it's the same problem with the torrent at onebigtorrent.org

Could you please take it down and fix filename?"
,RIAACunts,2010-12-17T18:31Z,Can't believe Windows still has that weird long file name bug.  Use a proper Operating System for fuck's sake.
,hootsman,2010-12-17T23:54Z,"i use peerblock and almost all the peers are on my block lists, so what dose this mean. well it means if u live in the uk or anywere else that u want to watch out, you maybe get a letter telling u to pay a fine. not only that the seed is Anonymous even worse.

,blahblah1,2010-12-27T22:55Z,Thanks
,brigate_rosse,2011-01-02T23:51Z,"When you open the link in the torrent, there is Â«Save AsÂ» at the top of the window. Change the file name in the field below Â«Save AsÂ» so that the file name would become shorter (delete superfluous words) and press OK. The download starts."
,penelopea,2011-02-05T10:48Z,"It doesn't play in VLC for me, and I can't seem to change the filename. I can't seem to delete it either. Any advice? Everyone else, though, shouldn't download. You can find it streaming on the web."
,reply520,2011-04-05T09:04Z,"This is not FAKE torrent, it works fine with VLC.
