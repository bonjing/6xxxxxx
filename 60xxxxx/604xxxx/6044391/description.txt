Black and white is an indulgence, and occasionally we like to create a set like this just because we like too. If we sold wine, this would be "private stock" material.

Dixie is one of those people who loves everything and everyone. She especially loves modeling and can take on any theme, pose, or expression. She's got great skill for someone just starting out, and has a long career ahead of her. Plus she roller skates. Not roller blade like you'd see on some beachside walkway. No, I mean roller skate like at the roller rink. Or roller derby. I don't know if she likes roller derby, but I be she'd be good at it. Maybe hockey, too.
