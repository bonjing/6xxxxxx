I am proud to present the ClIRC source code. ClIRC's source has never really been released in a way that has been convenient for hackers and moders to look it over as it is only available on Google Code in a bunch of separate files. Now you may download all of the files in a single torrent.

None of the files have been modified, and all are straight from Google Code. Source code was written by Clusterrr and I take no credit for anything here except for the torrent.

This source appears to need the PAlib library, libnds, and DevkitPro.
Once compiled, the binary (a NDS file) will only work on the Nintendo DS handheld console.

Sorry Clusterrr, it's just how things work. ;)
