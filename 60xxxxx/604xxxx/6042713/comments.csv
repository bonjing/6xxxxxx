,heroin99,2010-12-17T05:54Z,"@Tgiri2 Normally 720p is encoded with video bitrates of around 2000-5000 kbps and with DTS audio with at least 400kbps. Thats why usually its around 5-6gigs

This is 720p with low video bitrate (usually around 800kbps) and aac audio. The correct term for such rips would be ""m720p"", though strictly speaking m720p has higher vid bitrate.

x264 encoding with low settings even at 1280x720 resolution will get you smaller file sizes. Anyone can do it, as long as you use a good source. Try it with Megui, its very easy.
