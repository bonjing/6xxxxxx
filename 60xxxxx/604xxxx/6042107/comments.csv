,babybluetits24,2010-12-23T19:24Z,"If you look at a torrent & it has no screenshots (for porn) or a link 2 boxcover/official info about it (for films or tvseries etc) 1st search thepiratebay often some1 else uploaded the same file & included screenshots 2nd google it or use imdb.com or wikipedia & then copy&paste links 2 the info you find 2 help everyone else , it only takes a few seconds per file (once u found the info) ,the more people stop being selfish  the better off well all be, thepiratebay may not be around forever so help out right now please. Also keep seeding dont just hit and run , seed as fast as your isp lets u upload ,the faster your upload speed the faster your download speed is for recieving data thats how bittorent works ! im not a hypocrite sometimes when i go 2 post info tpb says database error failed to write..i dont have time 2  go back 2 the files i couldnt help out on , A good place to get help is http://forum.suprbay.org/index.php report fake files or drm files
 there.
 ,ps if you look at porn remember to respect women theyre gods greatest creation.Also all uploaders always test burn your uploads to dvd's keep titles for each file under 106 characters so popular dvd burning software like roxio works.And always report any child porn you stuble upon to http://www.iwf.org.uk/
