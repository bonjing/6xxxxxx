All I did was make it into a VirtualBox installation -- enjoy!

To use, make a new VM and set the hard disk to this .VDI file

Make sure you enable PAE/NX (or equivalent), 2D an 3D support, and give yourself around 512MB of RAM and 32Mb or more video memory.

Guest Additions installed, drivers installed, networking is active, good to go!

TPB keeps denying my account, so I made this one to upload this torrent.

Previous account - SausageHacker (then TPB wouldn't let me login?)
Account after that - Acc0unt (and after a month I couldn't login?)

Let's see how far this account gets >___>
