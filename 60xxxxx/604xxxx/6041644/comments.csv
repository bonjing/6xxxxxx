Error! D3DXCreateTextureFromFile 

Someone else encountered this problem and maybe even has a solution?"

,degusto,2010-12-16T11:46Z,"Yep, the first Gemini scenario/campaign is crashing after the update1, kinda sad, because i don't like to start playing from the middle /

Niestety cały czas pierwsza kampania/scenariusz nie odpala nawet po update1, choć można zacząć od drugiej, ale czy jest sens zaczynać od środka?

Bollocks "

,jarik464,2011-02-20T18:59Z,"Great game. Takes a while to get into, but after that, very rewarding. Release installs fine. After get, google the newly released .exe (DRM was buggy, so they released one without). Replace the old one with the new one, then patch to the newest. Patch is downloadable on their site (once again, google's your best friend). Play!!"
,Shoobox,2011-05-02T00:30Z,"disappointing
first time i ever had any issues using a clone drive or burning a game file.
doesn't mount with any thing, tried power iso and daemon tools!
tried burning to disk all it does is lock up my drive until i manual eject the disk. 

what a waist!!!!!! of blank dvd and download"
