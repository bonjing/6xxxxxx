It works with iPod Touches too! I'm currently getting all my tracks back on to my PC!! 

I scanned the files with AVG and there are no viruses (just in case you're wondering).

Thanks Slick!! "

,gwapsako,2010-12-20T07:39Z,"hey slick! thnks for this upload. i just have a question...everytime i try to install this my NIS 2011 keeps deleting this file. it says its a threat. im sure this upload is clean. ive  downloaded several of ur torrents before and theyre all clean and perfect. im just wondering why this one keeps being tagged as a threat by NIS 2011.
Need help on this one on how to install it. 
Anyone?

Thanks again for all ur work slick!!!"
,gwapsako,2010-12-20T07:43Z,"BTW, ive just upgraded from NIS 2010 to NIS 2011 a week ago.  i dont if this new version of NIS has something to do with my having a problem of instaling this. "
[V],Slickinator,2010-12-20T17:54Z,i think people have the uac enabled and most of my files it seems you have to right click on them now and run as admin and then should be fine give that a try 
[V],Slickinator,2010-12-20T17:55Z,and also since there is a patch involved sometimes any av will delete a patch as because its a patch not saying anything is infected but a patch hacks the dll file so it see's it as a threat so i would just temp disable for 15 minutes while u install

,Riclmnopp,2011-04-26T11:03Z,"I'm very new to using a ""crack"" so i was wondering if this one file needed to use one? I'm sure this is such an obvious question, but like i said I'm new to this. I read your comment saying this was a all in one file so does that mean it already has the ""crack"" and that i just need to run as is? Thank for any help that i might get. "
