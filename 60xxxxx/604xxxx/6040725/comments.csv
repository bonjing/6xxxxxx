With mkv some times it comes with D.T.S. with MP4 is it only Stereo? through my denon amp,i have the choice of matrix,5 channel,PLII,dts master etc.With this type of file (I play it direct out of my flash card into television) would I best be using a stereo based sound setting or a split channel?
But thanks for the effort for the rip, as this is superb!!!
Merry Christmas."

also AAC can come stereo or 5.1
In this case it comes as AAC 5.1 transcoded from original DTS HD track, so its almost the same quality if you set up everything properly."

Seriously, what technique is employed in making these files? I am very curious."
