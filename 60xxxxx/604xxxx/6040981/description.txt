The ninth installment of Bob Dylans Bootleg Series: The Witmark Demos 1962-1964. I've included the bonus disc I received with my online order: In Concert Brandeis University 1963, recorded live at Brandeis University, May 10th, 1963 during the Brandeis University Folk Festival, Waltham Massachusetts.

The discs were ripped with EAC to WAV, then converted to FLAC level 8 with dBpoweramp. Included are checksumfiles created with Trader's Little Helper and the front covers of both albums.
