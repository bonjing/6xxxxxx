Please show appreciation by seeding, it a small file that wont kill your bandwidth.... Enjoy!"
,CobraMon,2010-12-17T07:30Z,"But where oh where is X1 in full, mon?"
,mishaxd,2010-12-17T14:13Z,Has anyone managed to use the Assign memory patch on Windows 7 x64?
,posaudio,2010-12-17T16:46Z,"Yes, the assign patch works on windows 7 64, its just that after install you get a dreaded code=1 error, this registry patch fixes that.... You dont need this if your installing to to 32 bit"
,mishaxd,2010-12-17T19:55Z,"The Assign patch didn't work for me for neither 64bit or 32bit.

After entering the serial and clicking ""Patch"" a message box appears saying ""Failed to get valid value from the installer."" 

And yes, i did follow the instructions. :("
,posaudio,2010-12-17T20:53Z,"The you are not doing something correctly, or your system is the issue. The Assign release is confirmed working with 32 bit, and installs fine on x64, but there is a code=1 error at first run and so on. this reg patch fixes that. Make sure you run the assign patch correctly, it patches the ""Memory"" to accept the serial number on the assign info. run the memory patch when you are sitting on the serial screen of the installer.  mishaxd, looks like the memory patch when you are running it is not seeing the serial info in memory? make sure you input info before running patch, just dont hit next yet till you run patch. Also, make sure your running everything as administrator! The memory patch, and installer!"
,mishaxd,2010-12-17T23:00Z,Oh I didn't realize the serial had to be visible on the screen for the patch to work.
,posaudio,2010-12-17T23:45Z,"Thats Why People complain and cant get stuff to work, because they dont take time to read the instructions carefully. Look at step 1!

,mishaxd,2010-12-18T06:19Z,"lol no offense if you are the one who wrote these instructions, but nowhere does it say the serial number has to be visible on the screen when you click the patch. It doesn't work if the installer is minimized, or if the patch window is covering part of the serial number."
,posaudio,2010-12-18T16:54Z,"Are you that big fo an idiot? It says INPUT SERIAL, next step, RUN PATCH!"
,bababouyaw,2010-12-19T17:12Z,"posaudio pls pls pls do upload Sonar X1 Full , ud make my life and the life of many others much easier. i really hope u do !!! "
,mishaxd,2010-12-19T17:40Z,"Whatever. Just go look at the comments left on other torrent sites where the ISO has been posted and you will see how many idiots are having trouble. Step 4 should read: Ensure that the serial number stays in plain view on the screen, then click Patch."
,bababouyaw,2010-12-21T11:05Z,can someone pls upload sonar X1 full torrent ? 
,bpfeif03,2010-12-24T03:49Z,I created a Username with the sole purpose of requesting you post the full 32 and 64 bit versions and I will seed until something grows if you do!
,therockitman,2011-01-12T05:56Z,"o yes please posaudio, do post the full version.

,Black_Watch,2011-01-21T05:45Z,i will seed it as long as it takes if you post the full version.
,Black_Watch,2011-01-21T05:46Z,will seed forever if you upload the full version!

,KoheHuNT3R,2011-04-20T02:42Z,"@posaudio
  I have a 200+kbps UP side connection... (Max Down of about 4.5MBps) With a post of the original ISO, I could obtain the file from you in under two hours and seed at 200+kbps. You wouldn't even need to seed after that. I could take it from there.

 Much Love,

,montanna,2011-05-25T00:22Z,if you could upload this in the 32bit it would help me
,KryXus,2011-05-26T12:30Z,"Hmm . . .No sign of original Assign X1 Release . . . Anyone ?
It'd sure be nice to have all files in one place and a complete working copy.  If someone uploads I'd gladly seed lots !

Thanks for all your work !"
,theeGRated,2011-07-28T18:47Z,"wait what the fuck? am i an idiot or whaaaat i downloaded the torrent n there was just the regedit for the 64 bit, and posaudio is talking about the steps.. blah blah read notes unzip mount blah blah. theres only one thing in the torrent. so where is the other torrent for the iso n the instructions???"

,Jimscott,2012-04-15T23:51Z,I downloaded the zipped iso file but when I try to open it requires a password. What is the password?
,Jimscott,2012-04-15T23:55Z,"I downloaded the zipped iso file from Team Assigns but when I try to open it requires a password. What is the password?
I sure wish you would put the whole Sonar X1 here for download!"
