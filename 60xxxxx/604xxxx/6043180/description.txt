           For three decades Jim Henson's Muppets have               
         entertained millions of humans all over the world.          
         The Muppets have made people laugh and have helped          
         educate children of all ages. From the earliest days,       
         when in 1955 Jim Henson introduced Kermit the Frog          
         on a late night American TV show called "Sam and            
         Friends", through to Sesame Street and then The             
         Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock his creations have             
         had a magical, universal appeal.                            
                                                                     
           Jim Henson and his team of animators, puppeteers          
         and storytellers have set such high quality standards       
         in the world of children's television that today            
         the Henson name is synonymous with excellence.              
         This special is a celebration of 30 years of Muppet         
         achievement.

           The broadcast history of the Muppets technically          
         started in May 9, 1955, when Sam and Friends                
         premiered on WRC-TV, NBC's DC affiliate, now known          
         as NBC4. You don't need to be a math whiz to realize        
         that by the mid 80s, they were already 30 years old,        
         which clearly called for a celebration! This special        
         gives a pretty good idea of how much actually               
         happened in those 30 years, how many enduring               
         characters were introduced, how many classic shows          
         were produced, how many timeless scenes had already         
         been presented. Chock full of clips, and with an all-       
         star cast across several Muppet properties (including       
         rare appearances from the original Sam and Friends          
         cast), this is truly a worthy celebration. Even Jim         
         himself makes a short cameo!                                
                                                                     
           There are unfortunately a few brief dropouts of           
         sound and video due to some capturing issues, but           
         hopefully this shouldn't take much away from your           
         enjoyment.                                                  
                     Enjoy!

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.
