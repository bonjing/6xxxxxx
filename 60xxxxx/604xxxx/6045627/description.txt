BDK NOTES
We did our normal stuff to it. We brighten it up. We also worked on the contrast, denoiser and finally a sharpen filter to it. also fixed colors.Also the audio from the intro is not there and the audio at the end credits is also missing. As soon as some line comes out i will do V2 with line. Hope you all enjoy from BDK.

credit BDK & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
