movie looks and runs fine  its an older movie however  so dont expect dvd quality of course but looks good for it time

no subtitles  included unfortunelty and i cant find one on net anywhere  oh well

this is a random horror movie  looks weird and scary i was directed to this after   reviewer at idmb recommended movies that are disturbing..so if your looking for an older off kilter horror flick than here you go

thanks to the uploader for this one cause it looks very unique and probably rare too

thanks "
