[V],catflap,2010-12-20T03:06Z,"THIS IS A FAKE!

axxo hasn't released a thing for almost 2 years.

although this MIGHT be the real film, it
is DEFINITELY NOT An AXXO FILE.

do not download anything from this person
or you take the risk of getting screwed with
trojans, viruses, or passworded crap.

ANY NEW FILM WITH AXXO'S
TAG RELEASED AFTER MARCH 11, 2009
IS A FAKE.

yes, this is A FAKE in the sense that
although it might be the real movie, it
is definitely NOT AN AXXO RELEASE.

you would know that if you had actually looked
on axxo's REAL website home. axxo does not
have - AND NEVER HAS HAD - his/her/their own
website, but calls home on an RG's website.

you would also know that axxo has not released a thing
for almost 2 years. any new film released with
axxo's tag after March 11, 2009 IS A FAKE. "

Even if this dude isn't axxo, big deal, YOU ARE STILL STEALING MOVIES NO MATTER WHO UPLOADS IT!! wrong is wrong, is wrong, is wrong.  Give it a rest man, go smoke one or holla at a bitch or something.  Do something productive with your time."

If you are getting problems running the video 

please update your Windows Media Player to the latest (12.0) version.
i have windows 7 and it comes with wmp 12.it wont play the file says ""the file you are attempting to pay has an extension(.avi)that does not match the file format.Playing the file may result in unexpected behavior.""a little help.whats the format?how can i fix it.the torrents ive got from you so far have been good.this is the first issue ive had."
,pirate111111,2011-01-09T21:45Z,This file is a load of BS. I am not able to understand why someone would make a release with some kind of DRM included. Couldn't it be just avi not an some encrypted s**t?
,dlishuss,2011-01-13T03:50Z,@catflap i agree its very unlikely that aXXo is back from the abyss but do you know him/her personaly? theres always the possibility they may have just decided to lay low for a while and has finally decided to grace us with the great torrents they are know for dont assume anything catcrap.. i mean flap. adn if the videos are quality i dont care if they call themself doucheMoose all the same to me.

Keep ur negativity 2 urself and u just might live ur whole life. People wonder where society went wrong, its with the people who are more concerned about everything around them, rather than themselves at all. I appreciate all that is accomplished for my enjoyment and worry not about the rest. Some ppl r mentally imballanced and i believe if u judge anyone for anything in life, u dont have much of a klife left in u. Thank u sceneline and jstfk urself catflap, lol."

,Hippie102,2011-01-28T00:11Z,I have Windows Media Players latest version and it still didn't work...I also tried it on MediaMonkey and VLC Media Player. Any suggestions on how to fix it or why it doesn't work? 
,MolsonMomma,2011-01-28T14:14Z,doesnt work in wmp or vlc
,RaTTyRaTT,2011-02-28T15:08Z,"This is a DRM File'd video.  Checking of it requires to go to a URL:
http://xvid.freakyworld.info/drm.php

On going there, it redirects to another site, at which point I discontinued my checking of it until I had a more sandboxed system.

This guy seems to have upped others that are okay, checked fine - but this specific Video is a BIG TRAP!  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!"
