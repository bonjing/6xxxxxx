From BlackstoneAudio.com:

Mary Lennox, a spoilt, ill-tempered, and unhealthy child, comes to live with her 
reclusive uncle in Misselthwaite Manor after the death of her parents. There she 
meets a hearty housekeeper and her spirited brother, a dour gardener, a cheerful 
robin, and her willful, hysterical, and sickly cousin, Master Colin. With the 
help of the robin, Mary finds the door to a secret garden, neglected and hidden 
for years. When she decides to restore the garden in secret, the story becomes a 
charming journey into the places of the heart where faith restores health, 
flowers refresh the spirit, and the magic of the garden coming to life anew 
brings to Colin health and to Mary happiness.


"It will rapt most children away, for after fifty years its spell is still as 
strong; a blend of power, beauty, vivid interest and honest goodness. Yes, if 
this is magic, it is good magic." â€“â€“New York Times Book Review

"For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, The Secret Garden's 
portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson 
Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to 
identify with them even eighty-five years after they were conceived."
