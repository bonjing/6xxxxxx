
Nigella shares the secrets of food and flavours she just can't live without.

Lemon plays the starring role in a deliciously moist lemon polenta cake, the perfect teatime treat or dinner party dessert. Fresh pink garlic takes centre stage in a simple take on a French classic, chicken with 40 cloves of garlic - in true Nigella style it's one hundred per cent one-pot wonder.

There's chocolate, of course, in moist gooey brownies that are effortless, easy and use everyday ingredients. If you ever need cakes in a hurry these brownies are the answer. Chili is Nigella's final food hero - perfect in a fiery chorizo and chick pea stew you can rustle up from the pantry in no time at all.
