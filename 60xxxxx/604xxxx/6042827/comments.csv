,catfly,2010-12-18T00:42Z,"hey i like to see a review before i spend my hard earned download. and spoilers don't bother me, its not like it turns out darth vader is his father. if its a good movie its still worth watching."
,kbowk2,2010-12-21T06:06Z,Spoiler alert!!! At the end Devo slaps his dick on Redot's mothers face and she laps it up.

Story line is very simple - A game of Russian roulette for the desperate.  Not much from that.   "
