,Richer07,2011-07-06T13:46Z,"Downloaded this like half a year ago.. It worked very well and I copied it to couple of my friends.. 
now Me and my bro have got a problem.. the software has somehow changed and now it is ""  "" empty.. so I launch game from Icon.. and there pops up a cmd style window and it dissappears second later.. nothing happens and the window pops up and goes away.. We had to log out to get rid of the window.. And it happened when we tried again, Also at my brothers computer where I copied the file half a year ago..
so does someone have a solution for this.. 
I download this again and see if it works.. "
,Richer07,2011-07-08T07:57Z,"No work.. anoying window keeps popping up and puts all other windows down then immeaditly dissapears.. you cant do anything.

So anyone has a solution for this.. Or just tell another place where to download..

Cannot redownload cause some bug just copies it from backupfiles or something.. ( takes like 5 seconds to ""redownload"" )

If anyone else has the same problem or solution for it.. please tell me."
