A few months back I created the Hang Cool Teddy Bear Concert dvd. Now I finished the sequel. Meat Loaf continued the tour in the UK and again I used different concert footage to make it one big concert. 
With video from Cardiff, Bournemouth, Birmingham, Sheffield, Manchester and London this is a nice complete concert.

The show is 2 hours long and contains all songs Meat performed during the UK tour. Please keep in mind that this is all audience recordings and I\'m no professional editor either so don\'t expect pro shot material (though some of the video\'s are really really good). I\'m very pleased with the outcome although I have doubts about track two (Break It). The video and audio are very low quality and I only inserted the song/video to complete the concert. Maybe I should have left it out...

Anyway I hope you enjoy this 2 hour show with Meat in perfect shape. The UK Tour of Hang Cool Teddy Bear is as successful as the American tour and Meat sounds as good. If you enjoyed the US version I\'m sure you can appreciate this one as well :-) I even made the dvd cover in the same style as the US dvd.
