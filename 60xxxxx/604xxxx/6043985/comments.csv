But i was wondering if you know anything about season 1 in HD?

Btw, Heaven was a pretty good show, and the quality was perfect all the way through!"

But i have a problem: I speak spanish and i CANT find subtitles that correctly sync with the episodes.

Do you know at least English subtitles that fit with this release, so i can translate them ?"

@cletus8: You can always resync subs from a different release"
