My feeling is that most people are viewing this via their built-in media player on their 3D TV, and chances are the player doesn't have a decoder for DTS-HD track.  I would say most people who download this will have to remux to AC3, and probably a large part of the file size is the audio track.

Can you downsample and remux to a lower bit-rate audio track?  A few of others have done the same for their 3D releases.  I also see that you have included most non-English tracks, and whilst this will be appreciated by many others, it could be an idea to strip out these tracks but yet include the tracks in the torrent so that anyone who wants the non-English audio can remux.  Just trying to get that file size smaller!

Thanks again for the effort!"

,Scopse,2011-03-30T14:30Z,"Can someone confirm they've got this working in 3d, and how you've managed to get it working?

Seems a pretty large file for it to be 2d."
