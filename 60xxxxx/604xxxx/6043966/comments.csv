,cldocx,2011-03-04T23:20Z,looks good in the specs but why 3 separate files?
,gonnabadoc,2011-03-10T10:37Z,"@frijolito
Yes it has the water breathing rat."
,Vantek,2011-04-01T00:12Z,The 2:18 duration in the description is a misprint. This is actually the loooong 3 hour special edition. And indeed with the water breathing rat. Quality looks great to me.
