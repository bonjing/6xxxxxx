[center]I upped a torrent that was removed yesterday this isnt one i was going to encode not until maybe line audio was available but ive gone ahead and done one.Maybe abit on the large file size 1.7gb + for an R5 with cam audio may be abit much but i tried keeping it down but the quality went.So ive included the sample so you can decide for yourself.Did sharpening of the video and a touch of saturation,left the audio untouched ,its good cam audio...Enjoy [/center]
