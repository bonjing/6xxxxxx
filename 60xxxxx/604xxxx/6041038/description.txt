The Dave Brubeck Quartet is a jazz quartet, founded in 1951 by Dave Brubeck and
originally featuring Paul Desmond on saxophone and Brubeck on piano. They took
up a long residency at San Francisco's Blackhawk nightclub and gained great
popularity touring college campuses, releasing a series of albums with such titles
as Jazz at Oberlin, Jazz Goes to College, and Jazz Goes to Junior College.

By 1958, after a handful of different drummers and bassists, the "Classic
Quartet" so called because it remained as such virtually consistently until the
group dissolved ~ had been assembled, consisting of Brubeck, Desmond, Joe
Morello on drums, and Eugene Wright on bass. In 1959, the Dave Brubeck Quartet
released Time Out, an album their label was enthusiastic about but nonetheless
hesitant to release. The album contained all original compositions, almost none of
which were in common time. Nonetheless, on the strength of these unusual time
signatures [the album included "Take Five", "Blue Rondo ÃƒÂ  la Turk", and "Pick Up
Sticks"], it quickly went platinum. The quartet followed up its success with several
more albums in the same vein, including Time Further Out [1961], Countdown:
Time in Outer Space, Time Changes, and Time In. These albums were also known
for using contemporary paintings as cover art, featuring the work of S. Neil Fujita
on Time Out, Joan MirÃƒÂ³ on Time Further Out, Franz Kline on Time in Outer Space,
and Sam Francis on Time Changes [no artist's work, however, was featured on the
cover of Time In]. A high point for the group was their classic 1963 live album At
Carnegie Hall, described by critic Richard Palmer as "arguably Dave Brubeck's
greatest concert".

The "classic" Dave Brubeck Quartet broke up in 1967, except for a 25th
anniversary reunion in 1976. Brubeck formed a new quartet in 1968. Today, the
Dave Brubeck Quartet continues to tour the world, performing hits from the classic
Quartet era as well as new material..


Steve Race introduces the legendary Dave Brubeck Quartet in a restored and reedited
1964 programme, featuring Paul Desmond on saxophone, Gene Wright on
bass, Joe Morello on drums and Brubeck on piano. Songs include Take 5, the first
jazz record to sell over one million copies.
