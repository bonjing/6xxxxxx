[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T10:57Z,Hi MINUS moron.
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T11:02Z,"@r-0987: LOL to ""get mad"" part.
As I explained before, Marley & Me is too sad and I never ever would encode that movie.

@azrielle: I haven't watch it, so I cannot tell, but sounds as fun."
,nitish29,2010-12-15T11:17Z,i guess not ...anyways once again thanks for ur work really appreciate it ..merry christmas  
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T11:57Z,"@nitish29: I would do it. But acknowledge that your request has ticket number 53, what means probably after the Xmas. Sorry, I cannot do any faster."

Any chance? (agree completely with the posted review, btw, especially the accuracy)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-15T13:12Z,"@azrielle: Purple Hearts never was released as BluRay, only as DVD. 2 CD rips of group TASTE still can be found on Google.

If size is too big for you, I can do plain re-encode after the Xmas."
