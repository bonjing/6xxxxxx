What does this software do?

The problem:
Have you noticed that the longer you have your computer, the slower it runs and the more it crashes? Often this is because whenever you install or uninstall software, adjust hardware or change settings, the Windows registry is updated. Over time the registry starts losing shape, accumulating obsolete, corrupt and harmful files. Left unchecked, your system can become increasingly unstable, run more slowly and crash more frequently.

The solution:
RegistryBooster is the easy answer to Windows registry problems. This award winning software will deep scan your registry to identify problems and errors that can cause instability and slowdown. RegistryBooster will then repair or remove harmful registry entries to optimize your PC for better performance. You can also defragment your registry for extra speed and efficiency.

How does it work?
The registry is central to your computer\'s health as it contains essential instructions that are continuously accessed. RegistryBooster optimizes your PC by fixing or removing instructions that are harmful or useless.
