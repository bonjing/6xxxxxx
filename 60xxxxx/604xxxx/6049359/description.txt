RELEASE INFORMATION:

As Lylian, you have been unsecured of your restraints in the Hacklaster
mental hospital by an unknown, yet teasing entity.  Venturing  into the
corridors you see and hear things that you can't quite explain. Can you

reality? With a strict diet of Jam filled doughnuts, and the ability to
project your  intense imagination which  literally changes the look and
feel of the surroundings  and  enemies around you.  You  have the upper
hand with the use of the  extraordinarily long sleeves of your straight
jacket,  and   a   make  shift  sidekick  that  can  access   otherwise
un-traversable areas.
