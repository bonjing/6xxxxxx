,BigJake01,2011-03-09T18:48Z,"Wow, the quality is great!! Thanks!"
,athena1,2011-03-23T17:31Z,how do i seed?
,Taurean6,2011-04-09T23:53Z,"Quality is awesome. You need a mkv-file player to play these, but it's very easy to find with some googling.

Thanks a million for the upload! Seeding constantly."
,Taurean6,2011-04-14T00:26Z,"Athena: To seed, you need to leave the torrent in the downloading client after it's finished. It should start to seed even when you're downloading. If you've deleted it, download the torrent again, but deselect the downloading files. The torrent will be checked and start seeding."
,netfire_,2011-04-20T18:40Z,These are just shitty tv rips.
,IcedCoffeeMate,2011-05-05T02:24Z,"I honestly can't believe how AWESOME the quality is on these, even on my 37 inch tv quality is near perfect. This is revolutionary, why can't all torrents be like this???"
,refreged,2011-05-28T18:29Z,"Everyone says this is good quality, hope you are right folks. Will download ONE episode so start with and see how it is.

Will post result."
,refreged,2011-05-28T18:40Z,"Holy fuck this is great!

Many thanks for this"
,retux,2011-06-03T10:48Z,"Mother fucker, are you serious?! Thank god! I wish more people compressed the file like this. It saves sooo much space but still keeps the original quality. 

This should be the new standard for torrents, I'm sorry but it's true. Thanks a lot .BONE., You are awesome!"
,w3dge,2011-06-09T13:26Z,"Excellent torrent, is all playable in VLC, in great quality."
,DashyG,2011-06-10T18:15Z,"Dude, i can't thank you enough the picture quality is so good; my weekend just got a whole lot better. I hope your into South Park too ;o) u are da man "
,Garglemel,2011-07-09T23:33Z,"Cartoons use a tiny color palette = less color variance = higher compression = smaller filesize for a given apparent quality.

Derp."
,bashbashing,2011-07-14T01:01Z,This show had a good run. thank you very much for the upload!
,teemu92,2011-07-26T11:28Z,"cant wait to download! guys, be sure to seed to help us others (how to seed, when done downloading 100% just leave the torrent there on the list. You dont need to do anything just leave it  there and you will seed)
thanks and enjoy"
,Murdock52,2011-07-29T15:39Z,"Please, where i can find the subs for this? (english or brazilian portuguese)."
,oooiiiooo,2011-07-31T06:21Z,I never saw anything like this. Good picture and super compression. WHICH SOFTWARE YOU USED?
,bigvillebully,2011-08-14T02:13Z,Superior UL. I'm sure that it is the use of mkv format that allows such small filesize with great quality. I have had similar results using HandBrake to convert avi to mkv.
,Bingo777,2011-09-15T09:19Z,"Thanks Dude, I am s0o0o looking forward to this    "
,playasadonejoe,2011-09-23T17:19Z,Amazing quality!
,Evertonian3,2011-10-15T03:57Z,"Hey all, I am having trouble getting the audio to work.  Any suggestions?

,Janobala,2011-10-24T21:26Z,missing season finale... 
,Janobala,2011-10-24T21:28Z,i take that back i just realized that there numbered out of order
,nikok,2011-10-24T22:21Z,Very good quality.
,00Ace,2011-11-05T21:49Z,"Very Nice .Bone.

Mkv @ 220Kpbs, Nice, very nice.

I've been converting my Movies to Mkv with the H264 codec.

Most of my movies are under 300MB.

I convert at 250 or 300Kbps, and Cartoons and stuff, 200 to 250.

You also might want to check out WebM video file format using the VP8 Codec.

Mkv & WebM are the only 2 video file formats that can have VP8 Codec, it's by far the best, and the quality is very nice.

But I don't have a fast computer, that's why I can't convert to Mkv using the VP8 codec. If I did, my movies and stuff would be even smaller.

Keep up the Excellent work Bone. Very Nice work on the Mkv Files."
,00Ace,2011-11-05T21:52Z,"@Taurean6 You don't need a stupid Mkv video player. VLC Media Player plays all formats, except FLV and SWF. If you want to play FLV and SWF use Media Player Classic Home Cinima. It's free, just like VLC."
,00Ace,2011-11-05T21:55Z,"AVS Video Converter is Perfect 2011 Software to convert to MKv and WebM Video File Formats, ...

I use it all the time, Nice work again .BONE.

,Flyinby,2012-03-12T01:00Z,"Wow, excellent file size/quality in these!  I had S1 and 2 in .avi files and they were 4x the size of these, and they look and sound the same.  Got rid of the avi's and kept these, saving a bunch of space.  Thanks!!"
