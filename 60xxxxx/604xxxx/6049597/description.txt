From acclaimed animators StÃ©phane Aubier and Vincent Patar comes A Town Called Panic, a surreal and hilarious tale of adventure, romance, and villainous treachery in a small village where panic is both name and nature. Cowboy and Indianâ€™s plan to surprise Horse with a homemade birthday gift backfires when they accidentally destroy his house. To their dismay, no sooner have they built a new home when it is stolen from beneath their noses by a stealthy and cunning midnight assailant. Strange adventures ensue as the trio travel to the centre of the earth, trek across frozen tundra and discover a parallel underwater universe where pointy headed (and dishonest!) creatures live. With panic a permanent feature of life in this papier mÃ¢chÃ© world, will Horse and his girlfriend ever be alone?
