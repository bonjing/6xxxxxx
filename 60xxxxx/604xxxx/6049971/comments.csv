**ENGLISH SUBTITLES ARE INCLUDED** (You can enable them or disable them in yer media player, such as VLC). Works perfectly in VLC and in Media Player Classic.

The movie was good, I think. If anyone wants to add sumn to their martial arts movie collection then don't skip on this one. Watch it and see."
