Encoders Notes:

I cleaned up a lot of the audio. I removed most of the echoe and got rid of that tiny sound. I removed the hiss that was left over and equalized making this sound as close to line audio as I possible. Always check the sample to be sure for yourself.

At Reputation Resource we strive for quality and attention to detail. We are looking for experienced and non-experienced encoders to join our release group, ResourceRG. Training will be provided if necessary.
