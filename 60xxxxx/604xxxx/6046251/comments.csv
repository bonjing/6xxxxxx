@casinoguy666:
I am sorry it took you a whole day to download - frankly with round about 200 seeds their should be some speed on this - but still: It's for free!
So care less about speed, more about giving your share - and ENJOY ;) !"
,martian_neighbour,2011-02-04T03:23Z,Just a question. Is this series somewhat funny? I mean the genre. Like you know Chuck (comedy+romance+action) type of series.
[V],manOtor,2011-02-07T01:55Z,"@martian_neighbour
It's not concentraiting on comedy like ""Chuck"" does, but has still a fine sense of humor, that is somehow the glue to hold action, romance and drama together.
Think of it as a nice and solid action-comedy Ä‚  la ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"".
At least that's where i'd place it ;)."
