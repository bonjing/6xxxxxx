In fact even with the kind of oversharpening that makes your eyes bleed still looks better than most people's awful soft, grainy xvid rubbish.  But someone needs to tell these WAF guys about h264, or maybe grab them by the shoulders and steer them towards a good optician....

Anyway thanks to the uploader and anyone who wants to see this art house film without it being obliterated by a crazed ripper's filter chain (never mind the quality, feel the width!) you can find the DVD so cheap on amazon that I'm suprpised they don't just mail it out for free."
