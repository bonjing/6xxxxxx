The down speed was the most erratic I have ever seen, staggered from 1kbs up to 200, 300, 500kbs and back down again all the way along. I knew 29files in the torrent wasn't ideal but it was the only one available for download so stayed up passed 2am to watch it after an hour to download and then VLC wouldn't play it. Your call, but I gotta wait for another to be uploaded so I can watch it"

,Ashtray_Heart_89,2010-12-17T03:39Z,"works great 
thank you :)"
,Spyde20,2010-12-17T03:41Z,"It works. It's just compressed into a rar archive. You'll need to decompress it with Winrar or such.
Thanks for the episode!"
