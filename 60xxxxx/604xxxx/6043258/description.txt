From RecordedBooks.com:

Dave Eggers scored a worldwide phenomenon with this memoir 
that topped national best-seller lists and has since become 
a staple for summer reading and book clubs. A compelling 
voice for Generation X, Eggers here recounts his early 20s, 
caring for his younger brother after their parentsâ€™ 
unexpected deaths and his endeavors in a variety of media.

From Wiki:

The book was an enormous commercial and critical success, 
reaching number one on The New York Times bestseller list 
and being nominated as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize 
for General Non-Fiction. Time Magazine and several 
newspapers dubbed it "The Best Book of the Year." Critics 
praised the book for its wild, vibrant prose, and it was 
described as "big, daring [and] manic-depressive" by The 
New York Times. The book was chosen as the 12th best book 
of the decade by The Times.


From AuiofileMagazine.com:

When the author's parents die of cancer within five weeks 
of each other during his senior year of college, he finds 
himself the guardian of his younger brother. They move 
from Chicago to California, and the culture shock provides 
the impetus for this memoir. Narrator Dion Graham has a 
deep voice that is both riveting and unsettling. His 
performance harkens back to the days of the Beat Poets by 
transforming the words on a page into a vibrant experience 
complete with character voices, rhythmic paragraphs, and 
asides that sound like run-on sentences but are actually 
thoughts and feelings and jokes and, well, life. It's a 
tour de force for Graham and Eggers, and a golden 
opportunity for listeners everywhere.
