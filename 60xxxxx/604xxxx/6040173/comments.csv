,Aism,2010-12-15T07:04Z,Happy this is here saves their bandwidth and collects everything I need from my purchase =)
,[d_b],2010-12-15T19:59Z,"I just bought the bundle.
Support indie DRM-Free games!"
,goombapatrol,2010-12-16T20:48Z,just go buy it for a penny or something.
,one55one,2010-12-16T22:11Z,Can some one buy this Bundle for me? Please please! PayPal doesn't support my country and I don't have credit cards. I would love to buy this but I can't. Can you spare a penny for me?
[V],harry711,2010-12-17T00:41Z,@goombapatrol: please don't do that. It will probably cost them more in bandwidth and other fees. Just torrent if if you aren't willing to give at least a dollar or even 50 cents.
,imahotdoglol,2010-12-17T07:44Z,"I paid $5, I know it's way below the worth of the games... but as a student i can only do so much

If you guys do buy it, go for like above $3, if you're going well, $15, if you are a demigod, $29.

point is, use this torrent as a backup rather than a way to pirate it, resist the urge and pay the awesome developers and charities"

,baccilus,2011-03-06T12:44Z,I live in India. Is there any way for me to get this bundle here legally without owning a credit card? Right now it is not available at the official website.
