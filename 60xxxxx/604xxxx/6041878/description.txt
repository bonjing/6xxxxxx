Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade or simply Jin-Roh (\\u4eba\\u72fc, Jinr\\u014d, lit. \"Man-Wolf\") is a 1999 Japanese animated feature film directed by Hiroyuki Okiura.

The film is the third adaptation of Mamoru Oshii\'s Kerberos saga manga, Ken-Roh Densetsu, after The Red Spectacles released in 1987 and StrayDog: Kerberos Panzer Cops  released in 1991 in Japanese theaters.

The film takes place in Japan during the 1950s where Germany has conquered Japan. Kazuki Fuse, a member of the Panzer Cops with the rank of Corporal, is sentenced for not following an order to kill a suicide bomber. Along the way, he meets Kei, a girl who initially claims to be the suicide bomber\'s sister and they develop a relationship. However, this relationship proves to be dangerous for the Kerberos Corps. Mamoru Oshii, the creator of the Kerberos saga had desired to make Jin-Roh years earlier as a live-action film. However, Oshii decided that the film would be animated, and hired Okiura to direct the film and Production I.G to produce the film. The film premiered on November 17, 1999 in France, and Bandai Entertainment licensed the film for an English-language release in North America and Europe.

The film opens in Tokyo with an evening scene of anti-government protests, interspersed with an adolescent girl walking alone. This girl, Nanami Agawa, is revealed as a terrorist courier â€“ nicknamed Little Red Riding Hood by the military police â€“ a member of a guerrilla group known as the \"Sect\". Her role is to deliver satchel charges. She delivers the charge she carries to another Sect member hidden among regular protesters. The protest slowly turns into a riot, and the guerrilla flings the satchel bomb into the police lines, with the result that the police anti-riot squad charges to break up the riot.



Behind the military line stands a backup force. Instead of regular water cannon trucks, rubber-bullet guns and riot sticks, the military police â€“ bearing the Shutokei (é¦–éƒ½è­¦ \"Metropolitan Police\") emblem â€“ is equipped with armored vehicles and sub-machine guns. From his command post carrier, vice-chief Hajime Handa sums up the situation to an adjutant: this joint operation is under jurisdiction of the civilian police, and the military police is not supposed to join until assistance is requested.



The courier goes to pick up another satchel, moving through the sewer system. On the way, Agawa sees heavily armed men of the Special Unit â€“ Panzer Cops â€“ patrolling to find terrorists, and runs away. The Sect guerrillas moving equipment towards their next point are caught at a ladder up to the surface and are slaughtered by the Panzer Cops when one of them panics and fires at the Panzer Cops.



Agawa runs on through the sewers, until she is confronted by Corporal Kazuki Fuse. Kazuki is reluctant to open fire on an apparently unarmed child, causing Agawa to trigger her satchel charge. Kazuki survives the explosion. Meanwhile, above ground, the Self-Police (named \"Metropolitan Police\" in the English version) lose control of the riot after the lights go out â€“ the power supply was cut by the explosion.
