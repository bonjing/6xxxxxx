some 7 to 8 years past i saw a movie in star movies and i liked it very much n now i want to download it but cant recall the name of the movie. Anyone please help.........

plot-(which i can remember)-
it was a story of a man living in a small town. once he was out for shoping in an open market and was struck by a light from space (may be alien). After which he fainted and when he woke up he had some new power of extraordinary brain. As he was a farmer he grew big apple size tomatoes n other vegetables double from there original size. He could heal people using his powers. At the end he healed a dying boy using his powers and he himself died with that disease.


Please anyone who recognize this movie can inform me here or my email id is- Devasheesh07ee@gmail.com"

,nitrogun,2010-12-17T21:36Z,"From a silent fan of you and 20-40.....
Looking for your style of rips of first 3 series of Eureka, can find lots of small and crappy xvids, or enormous good quality ones, but none that are quality and smallish like yours. Slow and expensive ""broadband"" here. Perhaps consider this request, thanks. "
,redriding,2010-12-17T23:13Z,"@RiddlerA: I retract my request as you have enough on your plate.. 

@.Dev: Glad to be of assistance 
P.S - Im not a dude... lol"
,Freddy1169,2010-12-18T03:00Z,"Tiny filesize with good quality as always, thanks for another great torrent."
,unique223,2010-12-18T07:27Z,"@RiddlerA: I just tried watching your 'Salt' rip before I found that it included the 'Cinavia' audio DRM trigger, which makes it unplayable on updated PS3's or new Blu-Ray players. This DRM is going to be standard across all Blu-Ray movies.

It is fairly easy to eliminate, but it can be a bit more expensive and time-consuming. Using the audio from the DVD version removes the DRM. Is it possible for you to do this? Your rips have been my primary source of movies for the last few months, but this DRM means I can't watch it on my TV, and it's pretty lousy to have that limitation."
,redriding,2010-12-18T10:19Z,"@unique223 - try using TVersity media server and stream the movie or u can convert the file using mkv2vob (PS3 video converter) takes 5 minutes 

Links: http://tversity.com and www.mkv2vob.com

,unique223,2010-12-19T05:35Z,"@redriding: I already use PS3 Media Server to stream movies, and converting it won't remove the audio watermark. It doesn't matter if it's streamed, on the HDD or on a disc, if the video has the watermark Cinavia shuts it down."
