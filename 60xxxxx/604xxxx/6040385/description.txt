6. PORTABLE EDITION PRODUCTION AND QUICKLY DEPLOY GUIDE
----------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to do:

Method A:
6.1.1. Install Delphi7 lite use Setup-Edition first, we recommend select full installation type. here choice content will decide Portable-Edition content.
6.1.2. (Note: this step as an additional, non-required). Backup IDE configuration to facilitate rapid recovery after the Portable-Edition configuration. run strart of the Delphi menu -> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool" or -> CnWizards-> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool"(latter item only to install the CnWizards expert in choice available), backup IDE configuration files to filename.
6.1.3. (Note: this step as an additional, non-required). Use the ShortCut under targert directory of "Uninstall XXX (Remove Registration Only)" to uninstall the installed registration Information, this way does not delete files and folders. With this method you will get a pure Delphi7 folders completely.
6.1.4. After the reinstall the system or replacement of your computer, copy the entire installation of delphi folder to the new folder, such as D:\XXX, run D7LiteReg***.exe under folder of you i.e D:\XXX, after run will be create the menu for delphi, you can run the delphi7 now. D7LiteReg***.exe listed only automatically detect and install the components when you selected.
6.1.5. (Note: this step as an additional, non-required). Resumes the IDE IDE configuration. run delphi at leaest once, Rerun strart of the Delphi menu -> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool" or -> CnWizards-> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool"(latter item only to install the CnWizards expert in choice available), chose and resumes the preserved IDE configuration files on step of 6.1.2.

Method B:
6.2.1. Install Delphi7 lite use Setup-Edition first, we recommend select full installation type. here choice content will decide Portable-Edition content. Installation in the <additional tasks page>, select "Portable mode installation"(will not register Uninstallation in the system), If "Create Program Menus" is unselected, will not create any menu. With this method you will get a pure Delphi7 folders completely.
6.2.2. (Note: this step as an additional, non-required, if step 6.2.1 did not select "Create Program Menus",will be no menu,skip this step). Backup IDE configuration to facilitate rapid recovery after the Portable-Edition configuration. run strart of the Delphi menu -> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool" or -> CnWizards-> "IDE Config Backup & Restore Tool"(latter item only to install the CnWizards expert in choice available), backup IDE configuration files to filename.
6.2.3. After the reinstall the system or replacement of your computer, copy the entire installation of delphi folder to the new folder, such as D:\XXX, run D7LiteReg***.exe under folder of you i.e D:\XXX, after run will be create the menu for delphi, you can run the delphi7 now.

OK, a complete new Delphi development environment already rapid deployment of well, no need to re-run and wait for a lengthy installation process. If you want to achieve the IDE Settings / Components (including third-party Components) such as fast recovery, we must correctly perform these additional step.

7. RESTRICTIONS AND WARNING
---------------------------

WARNING:
* Do not re-patch any of third-party BPL file after installed, otherwise it might raise unexpected errors.
* On the replacement for the original RTL D2007 RTL / VCL, although the D2007 uses FastMM RTL memory management, faster and better than the D7 RTL, but carefully chosen to use, if the replacement RTL, all from the base of the VCL began to re-build, and some No source file may be unable to compiled and used, the use of the process of possible instability. Replacement after the installation of third-party Components, please do not use the built-in tools, or use the command line to compile, open and compile to install dpk from the IDE menus. Not all users recommended to replace,Only recommended for the component of the Delphi compile & installed very skilled and all installed component have the sources. If you just want Delphi7 support XP / Vista API and the new properties, select the "Replace Windows's pas(Supports New Vista API & Attribute) only (Maximum compatibility)" Instead of "Replace with Delphi2007's RTL / VCL" to ensure maximum compatibility.
