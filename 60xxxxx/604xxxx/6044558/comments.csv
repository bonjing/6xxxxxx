[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T18:46Z,"@pickled_egg: NOT TRUE. TV have resolutions 352x240 for NTSC and 352(384)x288 pixels PAL/SECAM. What confuses people is ""line doubling"". Higher resolutions came with SVHS, but it was just on side of reproduction source abilities, not TV itself.
FYI - and keep the voice down, especially if you shout things you know nothing about."
