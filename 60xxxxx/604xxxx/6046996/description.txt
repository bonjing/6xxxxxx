Challenged | Dia Zerva | Cyd Black  + Pics
December 10, 2010 


Dia Zerva finds pain as cathartic as she does erotic. It allows her to focus all of her thoughts on one point and allow the world to just fade away. The tightness of the bondage makes her feel secure. The strength of Cyd Black makes her feel safe. It is strange what goes on in her head. Everything that he does hurts her so much, but she would not trade it for anything in the world. Bondage and submission make her feel whole. Without them she is nothing.
