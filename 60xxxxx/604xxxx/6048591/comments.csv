The actual quality of the audio is great, but it skips sometimes, occasionally going out of sync by about 1 second but then it goes back in sync. Very good upload, completely watchable, almost perfect. Decent film too. "

,protocatz,2010-12-21T19:34Z,Speed remake? Anyone? ffs
,itstext,2010-12-22T01:40Z,"I've got other MKV files with high quality audio and video and they work just fine. But this one is causing me some problems. 90% of the movie seems to be aligned properly but I'm forced to adjust the synchronization up or down with VLC player at least 12 times through-out the movie.  I tried it on other players and to no avail... same result.

I'll give the video quality a rating of 6.5
The audio quality a 6

For the guy who wanted to know: The video bitrate is 1389kps"

,michaelrwatson,2010-12-22T21:37Z,"Is this one missing audio periodically like MANY of the other versions are..?  Many use the line audio that has words/partial sentences cut out on a regular basis (apparently to sync the remaining audio). They are all utter shit.  

Odds are, this one uses that same audio. "
,michaelrwatson,2010-12-22T21:48Z,"IS this one missing bits of audio periodically like most/all of the R5's are?  They all have audio cut out every few minutes, apparently so the remaining english audio could be synced to this Russian video. They are unwatchable. Monumental waste of time (not to mention bandwidth).
