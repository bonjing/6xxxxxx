This is my first upload on TPB.  To my knowledge this is the only Half-SBS 3D rip of the movie.  My upload bandwidth is quite limited so PLEASE seed your max at least until there are a few seeders. I will seed this for a month and try and keep a constant schedule (can't help if my computer crashes while I am asleep or away.  Also I am excited about the quality of the rip, as it looks crystal clear.  Thank you.  Screen shots coming soon.
