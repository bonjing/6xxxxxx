A family favorite! Kids & adults just love it!

Legendary rodeo star Smokey Banks (Michael Biehn) has been riding bulls all of his life. He's been to the top and now he's hit rock bottom after a run in with the law. Smokey's faced with two choices: jail or volunteering to teach a Christian boy named Danny (Brock Pierce) how to ride a bull. If it was easy, Smokey would be OK with it. But you see, he's got to give up drinking and gambling again-- "that was the worst fifteen minutes of my life." Not to mention, he's got to answer to a bunch of kids who won't let him do what he wants.
