Plot: It is a film of extraordinary violence. An
unconventional war film that shows the
roots of conflict (footage of Hitler, FDR
et al) and the end result (Holocaust
victims), while totally avoiding the
typical action-film depiction. The super
impositions (etched emulsion, short ends
leader, etc) dissolve into - even
obliterate - the archival footage
