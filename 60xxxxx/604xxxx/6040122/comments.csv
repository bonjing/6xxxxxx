hexstring ""40010000F000"" that represent 320x240 and change it to ""800700003804"" it resolution 1920x1080. Its reverse byte order
40 01 00 00 F0 00
(40 01 reversed order byte) (01 40 hex) = (320 dec)
(F0 00 reversed order byte) (00 F0 hex) = (240 dec)
1920 dec = 0780 hex reverse it and get 8007
1080 dec = 0438 hex reverse it and get 3804
insert between them separator ""0000""
and we finally get 
""800700003804"""
