The China Study is part diet, part medical study, part condemnation of the governmental and industry politics that determine what we think about what we eat.

This exhaustive presentation of the findings from The China Study conclusively demonstrates the link between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Referred to as the â€œGrand Prix of epidemiologyâ€ by the New York Times, this study reveals the dramatic effect proper nutrition can have on reducing and reversing these ailments as well as obesity and calls into question the practices of many of the current dietary programs, such as the Atkins diet, that enjoy widespread popularity in the western world.
