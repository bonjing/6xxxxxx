What a waste. No more ""movies by rizzo"" for me."
[T],moviesbyrizzo,2010-12-25T12:56Z,"These were in fact converted from a 13GB 720p version and looks lovely indeed as a nice 4GG offering. So go elsewhere if you want more. In fact why not go buy yourselves the disc if youre that sort of disposed to negate a nice offering for those many that will think it just great for their needs. If youre wanting a mercedes, dont shop for a volvo ok? We would have preferred to have DivX plus converter do the job as it works best, this was done with IMTOO converter with audio tracks supplied into the final product. Merry Christmas all!"

But, I must agree with wetmouse, that the video of this upload is indeed blocky, and not up to the mark for a 720p Rip.
Thanx for uploading this anyway. And I will definitely look out for more of your collections."
