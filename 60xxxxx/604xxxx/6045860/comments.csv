,DasheriM,2010-12-23T02:57Z,Thx for upload but 1536 Kb/s DTS too much for such size and video bitrate is low. (3625kbps) If you rip 768 kbps DTS it would be much better...
[T],lilmjkl,2010-12-23T13:37Z,"DTS is a loseless Audo format, you can't get a lower bitrate for that. If you want a lower bitrate Audio you have to search for AC3 audio, but the file sizes  with AC3 are smaller."
,antiterrorstyrkan,2011-02-25T18:52Z,"DTS is not a lossless format. But at 1500kb it is the highest lossy compression still compatible with DVD. Bluray has lossless DTS formats supported, and in those this 1500kb lossy format is kept for compatibility reasons, this is then called DTS-Core."
