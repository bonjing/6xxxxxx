The color tone, or lack of it, makes these pictures feel a little chilly. Like they were taken in a freezer or something. Don't worry, they weren't taken in a freezer and Dixie isn't too cold. As a matter of fact, we weren't too far from the toasty warm fireplace. Dixie shows us a determined attitude, something strong to match the coolness of the images.

Dixie is one of those people who loves everything and everyone. She especially loves modeling and can take on any theme, pose, or expression. She's got great skill for someone just starting out, and has a long career ahead of her. Plus she roller skates. Not roller blade like you'd see on some beachside walkway. No, I mean roller skate like at the roller rink. Or roller derby. I don't know if she likes roller derby, but I be she'd be good at it. Maybe hockey, too.
