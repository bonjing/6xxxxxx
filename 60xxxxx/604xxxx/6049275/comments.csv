some wxp_live_cd fails to run:
1. multimedia files such as avi, divx, wmv, and so on.
2. mso-2007 files.

@r.steve
i had downloaded
1. Portable_Microsoft_Office_2007.rar
2. El_DocToR.Portable.Microsoft.Office.2007.Pro.Word.Excel_Only.FoNekat.Net.rar
they are running without installing to the pc.

@jinualex
i am downloading your version.

,ILKnight,2011-04-09T22:13Z,"It has a trojan in the file I386\BOOTSDI.IMG
Threat: Hupigon-ONX

Although it works on my virtual PC, I better dont use this in any real PC. I dont see why it should be a false positive. Other real Windows PE versions donât have Trojans."
