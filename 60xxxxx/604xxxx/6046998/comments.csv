1. DVDXCopy.Platinum.v4.0.3.8.exe
2. DVD.X.Copy.Platinum.v4.0.3.8.Patch
3. DVDXCopy.Platinum.Upgrade.to.v4.0.4.15.exe
4. DVD.X.Copy.Platinum.v4.0.4.15.Patch

1. Installed (1) v4.0.3.8.exe and walked through the steps until it asked me to restart a couple times. Choose 'NO' (yet)

2. Open the v4.0.3.8 Patch.
Click 'Patch' and it says something like 'can't find folder ...' so I had to browse for it. 'My Computer' > Local Disc > Program Files > 321Studios > then looked for the .exe file it asked for (at the bottom) each time within the three folders there. Clicked on it and it said it said 'patched' and asked for a different one, did the same. It then asked for a third one but it wasn't there anywhere that I could find and it said something like 'patch not applied' (didn't sweat it) I exited and restarted my computer.

3. Opened the 'Upgrade.to.v4.0.4.15.exe' and went through the step or two to install it.

4. Opened the 'v4.0.4.15.Patch' and followed the same steps as (2) except this time it just 'patched' 1 or two files (I forget) and it or they both were there, and it said done. Didn't need to restart this time.

Opened the program and popped in a a DVD just to test it out. Peformed a 'readability test' and analyzed the disc and everything but 'rescue' it so far, and since I don't even have a scratched dvd at the moment to try I can't be 100% certain, but it all sure seems to be operating just fine. The program seems intuitive enough to tackle.

Went into 'File' and 'Preferences' and checked to see if I there was an option to check for automatic updates or whatnot - There wasn't. There is a manual button to check for them under 'Help' which, needless to say, shall go unused.

Also under 'Help' the 'About' says it is a 'purchased version'"
