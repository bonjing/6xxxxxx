JANUARY 1981: A live KING BISCUIT FLOWER HOUR radio show
recorded in July 1980 is purchased by Phonogram Records
in Germany to be released as an album for the exclusive
purpose of promoting an upcoming 2-hour live television concert,
"Rock Palast," on January 20, 1981, and a concert with
The Boomtown Rats two days later.
Called "MAS HYSTERIA," the record cover is designed to look
like a bootleg, and though it was originally meant strictly
for promotional use, due to popular demand this 6-song
"limited edition" is released and reprinted in Germany
year after year. The 12:51 version of "SITTIN' IN THE DARK"
becomes especially popular in clubs and on radio
(and still gets much airplay there today).
"MAS HYSTERIA" eventually sells over 250,000 copies,
ironically making it Carolyne's biggest-selling record anywhere.
Because it is sold at a "nice price," she is ineligible for the
accolades that a Gold Record would normally bring.
She will also never see a penny from this record, her biggest success.
