Emergency is a hit album released by the funk band Kool & the Gang in 1984. The album brought a first for the band: three number one R&B singles from a single album. The songs "Misled" (Pop #10), "Fresh" (Pop #9, Dance #1), and "Cherish" (Pop #2) all hit the top spot in 1985. In addition, the title track was also released as a single, and reached the top twenty.

Kool & The Gang are an American jazz, R&B, soul, funk and disco group, originally formed in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1964.

They went through several musical phases during the course of their recording career, starting out with a purist jazz sound, then becoming practitioners of R&B and funk, progressing to a smooth pop-funk ensemble, and in the post-millenium creating music with a modern, electro-pop sound.

They have sold over 70 million albums worldwide.

The late 1970s saw a lull in Kool & the Gang's except for the album Open Sesame which yielded the title track "Open Sesame" which achieved some success in the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Then came new lead singer James "J.T." Taylor who joined the group â€” with 1979's Ladies' Night. Their #1 hit in 1980's "Celebration", from Celebrate!, co-produced by Eumir Deodato. More international hits followed in the early 1980s, including "Big Fun," "Get Down on It" and "Joanna". Their 1984 album Emergency yielded four top-20 pop hits, including "Fresh" and "Cherish." Their chart presence stopped after Forever. Taylor left the group amicably to pursue a solo career.

"Jungle Boogie" was featured on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's well known cult classic Pulp Fiction. The band released the album "Still Kool" in 2007.

"Hollywood Swinging" was sampled by DJ Kool in his song "Let Me Clear My Throat", and by rapper Mase on "Feel So Good."

Kool & The Gang's "Summer Madness" from their 1974 album Light of Worlds has been sampled numerous times. Most notably, it was used by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince for their 1991 single "Summertime." "Summer Madness" was also featured in the 1976 Picture of the Year, "Rocky." A live version of the track recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London was released in 1976 on the Love & Understanding album (De-Lite DEP 2018). Live at PJ's' track "N.T" has been sampled extensively by artists such as Boogie Down Productions, Brand Nubian, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, N.W.A and Kris Kross.

Kool & The Gang performed at Jerusalem's Gan Sacher (Sacher Park) during the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Student Day/Jerusalem Day all-night concert on May 11â€“12, 2010. In October 2010, Kool & The Gang signed with indie label Expat Records for the release of their electro-pop single "Miss Lead" with a female lead vocalist.
