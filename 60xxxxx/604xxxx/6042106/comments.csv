Quick q, any way of finding which of these have the cinavia before we dl?"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-15T17:08Z,"Hi verma99 - you're welcome.

It's only movies that are produced and/or distributed by Sony Pictures at the moment, so the IMDb can give you that information."

,pathless,2011-01-04T20:41Z,"This format seems to be the best I have found for my HTPC with MPC-HC.

I have a few raw m2ts files that I would love to build avchd out of and was wondering what you used to author these?

Keep up the good work."
