,chopmax,2010-12-15T20:43Z,"Still can`t believe this cock sucker Mark Zuckerberg won Time`s person of the year 2010 award. Julian Assange recieved 40% of the vote with an 92% approval rating.

Nothing wrong with the torrent itself."
,kinvore,2010-12-16T00:29Z,"chop maybe they figure Zuckerberg has affected more of us than Assange did.  not saying it was the right decision, just think that's their reasoning."
,nuala666,2010-12-16T04:17Z,thanks hun..your the only one i trust to put up great stuff!!
,marshallw,2010-12-17T05:54Z,"just a heads up, i dl'ed this torrent and starting watching it on my ps3, but ran into trouble - about 20 minutes into it, a notification popped up on my tv that read something along the lines of 'temporary audio muting due to this file not being authorized to play on this machine.'

the audio was muted and stayed muted unless i pressed stop then play again, or fast forwarded it a minute or two...  but then about 10 seconds later, it muted the audio again and the same notification popped up :(

totally weird, and even though i torrent a lot of movies, i've never seen anything like this before. not sure if it's the file, or the certain file type on my ps3..."
,Klaproosje,2010-12-18T23:31Z,seeds plz :)
,SquisheeLOTUW,2010-12-20T10:36Z,"Video and audio quality are fine, but there's subtitles on it and I can't make them go away. Kind of annoying and would have been nice to know beforehand."
,SquisheeLOTUW,2010-12-20T10:37Z,"Never mind. Fixed it lol. Thanks for uploading, great torrent!"
,denis327,2010-12-21T19:43Z,"I can confirm marshallw's above comment. While this plays without any problems on my PC, while playing on PS3 it gave a warning message and audio muted. I have never experienced anything like this before."
,weeblpie,2010-12-24T06:33Z,"@denis327, @marshallw: A Sony device blocking a pirated copy of a film distributed by Sony Pictures? I am suspicious...

You sure those things don't phone home to check files against a blacklist? That's the sort of treatment you get for buying Sony products."
,DavidDeath,2010-12-29T19:23Z,"Just before playing one of these movies XVids on the PS3, make sure you ""Disable"" the Network internet connection and you wont have those problems again.
Just remember to ""Enable"" it after or you'll spend ages wondering why your game wont go online later on, like I do lol"

D/L Speed-10"
,GREyyZiE_BByy,2011-01-05T05:15Z,Thank you!!
,dsrs,2011-01-17T13:41Z,"yes, the entire movie is a bit dark. not sure if that is supposed to be an 'artistic' statement...
but this is far from the best video quality
thanks anyway"

Great rip, however contains Cinavia DRM. Plays fine with VLC player on my pc. Put it on my ps3 to watch and it tell me that i do not own the rights to watch this movie and cuts the audio. 

Many new blu-ray players (including the ps3) and dvd player have the ability to detect Cinavia DRM. According to wikipedia there are about 12 blu-ray releases out at the moment with such protection and no doubt the list will grow!!!!!"
,sohamsp14,2011-02-05T18:10Z,"I cant get this movie to play on my pc or my PS3..  When I try to play on VLC, I get 10 seconds of colored static and thats it.. Also.. PS3 says corrupted data.."
,coezz,2011-06-13T08:24Z,"maybe md5  checksum is recommended..try to download this mov, maybe I can give you guys a md5 checksum after I downloaded this mov :o"
,morphiend,2011-06-30T04:50Z,"I really hope this is not the copy with the Columbia Pictures watermark. . . I deleted my old copy with it hoping after it came out on DVD someone would have put a legit copy on here. . . It was nice though, it was still in theaters when I first saw it."
