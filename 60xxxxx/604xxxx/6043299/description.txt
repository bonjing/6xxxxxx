Encoder's notes: 

The much awaited Dragon Dynasty blu-ray for this movie has turned out to be rather disappointing. Subtitles are still DUBtitles like in past DVD editions and the video transfer is inconsistent as pointed out in the DVDBeaver review: 

"Hard Boiled continues to be a problematic title for transfer to the digital medium. This 1080P dual-layered transfer is quite inconsistent - looking nicely textured with grain in some shots and blatantly soft, waxy and DNR-ish in others. Detail is gone. There is also some notable damage in spots - mostly frame specific - but still noticeable.  Despite a high bitrate - fans will consider this a disappointment - visually-speaking. There is something odd about this image quality that I will revisit to help identify."

I've included all the subtitles available in the blu-ray which I've OCR'd myself (English, English for the deaf and hard of hearing, and Spanish). I've tried to no avail to add external subtitles as usual but I couldn't sync them as they belong to different cuts of the movie.
