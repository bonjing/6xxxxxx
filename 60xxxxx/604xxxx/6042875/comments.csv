Why do you, or anyone else for that matter, not say it is a Russian language only when you put this up? It's only common courtesy! "

I didn't check this cd anymore. And this is not my torrent. I got it from another sight and upload it here for piratebay members. You open the cd and check it. Use 7-zip to open .wim file. It shows both russian and english language.

I want to know why you are not posting thanks and good comments on the comment section. There are also other good torrents too in my upload.

You may be download it. But you didn't give me a thanks or an appreciation, why? Are you believing the comment section is only for blaming others and to make only the bad comments. Are you seeding your downloaded torrent to others? If you are doing it's good, or please do it. Post your thanks and your opinion (good and bad) on comment section. It will help us for uploading good stuffs.

Thank you."
,wulles,2010-12-17T10:23Z,"Ok, I hope you are better now. You have the iso. Burn it and see if you can in any way choose english. I dont think so. But if yes - tell us about it."
,wulles,2010-12-17T12:41Z,"Oh, by the way -  do not expect thanks for some useless shit, but make it work, and wind will change."
,wulles,2010-12-17T13:16Z,"Ok, thank you for the link to your other torrent. Just what I needed :17-12-2010 13:16:25 ""Win32:Hupigon-ONX [Trj]"" has been found in ""D:\ISO\WinXP.live.Big\Windows.XP.Live!.May.2008.SoPoRific.iso\I386\BOOTSDI.IMG"" file.  "
,jinualex,2010-12-17T19:05Z,"wulles,

I hope I am always good like you. And I do not expect thanks for the useless stuffs. I like to accept both good and bad comments (if it's relevant). But the problem is you are using comment section only for blaming."
,jinualex,2010-12-17T19:25Z,"wulles,
If anything you liked it or not, always try to use good language for communication in your life. Because our language reveals our culture."
,jinualex,2010-12-17T19:31Z,"
I infer it is a Russian language only after wulles's comment. But I'm not responsible for any of my uploading. Please just search on the net, you could find this all over the net. "

""Looks like a very good LiveCD other than the main default language is in Russian. I could not find any way to change the language to English. Since the majority of the software runs in Russian, it is of no value to the English speaking world."""
