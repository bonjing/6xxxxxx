Excellent torrent, KaLaNco69, thanks for the up!"

,thinkfree,2012-02-13T23:58Z,"poor plot, poor dialogs, unconvincing characters ... hot girls yes .. i guess thats about all it needs these days to make a good show, hot girls, lots of sex talk .. some threesomes .. and everyone is hooked. primitive!!"
,shedevil0223,2012-03-21T05:08Z,thank you for the upload great job but on ep 6 some of the converstaion cut off around 19:42 there was more to that convo 
,shedevil0223,2012-03-21T05:11Z,great upload but on episode 6 food for thought it cuts the conversation at around 19:42 there is more to the convo between bo and lauren 
,MaGicbush,2012-05-24T06:52Z,"@ ickyyes:

Funny thing is in the first episode she states she is from the Midwest in the U.S. Though the actual actor is from Canada, she sounds as much American and looks as American as you can get. Most likely because her husband is from America so basically is American now."
,MaGicbush,2012-05-24T06:55Z,"Also, good show. There is some sex scenes in it but it does not draw on much and is mostly about the history of the Fae. It is very addicting if you stick with the series after the first two episodes."
,MaGicbush,2012-05-25T07:04Z,"After watching through the second season, I take that back way to many gay scenes. Fast-forward is good for that however."
,clewis7,2012-05-25T10:56Z,"Thanx ""2HD"", I've been meaning to grab this series for a while now. I've heard good things about it. Much appreciated & cheers... :-) ....."
