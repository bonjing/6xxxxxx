Split into two DVD5 discs using DVDFAB so that they will fit on standard DVDs for your convenience. Also, PGCs were removed for convenience.

All you have to do is burn the files to a blank disc if you want it on a DVD. You can also convert it to ipod format, or just watch it on your computer if you don't want to do any converting, although if you want to watch from your computer you will have to mount the files as an iso using PowerISO or a similar program.

If you want to convert the files here is the link to DVDFAB(It is not my torrent just to let yall know.):

don't hesitate to comment.

seed and enjoy, Thanks.
