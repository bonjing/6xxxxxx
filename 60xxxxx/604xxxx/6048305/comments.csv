,tessy55,2010-12-18T04:01Z,how do i down load
,referhead,2010-12-18T05:35Z,wow.
,prius4845,2010-12-18T05:49Z,"@tessy55 you click ""download this torrent.""you then open it in any torrenting program. i use uTorrent. then you wait for it to download then u can use any program that burns files to a disc. I use DVDFAB(link in description) and it is pre-split to fit on 2 standard dvd's, because most people don't have dual layer dvd's. you can also just watch it strait from you computer by using a mounting program. i use power iso. and then run the ""virtual DVD"" from the ""virtual drive"" if you really want to get fancy you can convert the files into mp4 format to play on an ipod, phone, psp, etc. and lastly don't forget to seed the torrent so other people can download faster. enjoy and don't hesitate to ask any more questions."
,SAS9211,2010-12-25T01:25Z,u crazy man..8 GB..for a film that's insane..
,prius4845,2010-12-25T04:51Z,"@SAS9211 It is an exact copy of the DVD. uncompressed, unedited(except for splitting and removing PGCs), and unconverted. It's raw DVD files."
,prius4845,2010-12-25T04:57Z,@SAS9211 check out my other torrent that is 20.3GB. It's three discs. Now that's insane.
,rls1000,2011-02-26T11:09Z,"If I want to take the two separate DVDs and combine them back into one, how would I do that?  I have a double-sided DVD and I have successfully downloaded the Disc_1 & Disc_2 folders you uploaded.  But I don't know what to do next?  Sorry if I'm just being dumb."
,prius4845,2011-03-01T02:05Z,"@rls1000 What you would want to do is ""merge"" the two discs into one. I purposely split the disc into two because most people only have regular single-sided discs. you can use any program capable of merging discs. I use ""DVD Fab 5.0.6.0"" because i got it for free. The torrent is http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4438638/DVD_FAB_PLATINUM_W__working_serial     after you merge it you would then burn it to your disc. the torrent that i listed in the description doesn't seem to work anymore now that I've updated(for free of course) to windows 7. GOOD LUCK!! if it doesn't seem to work for you then you can just turn it into a .ISO and watch it from your computer. Sorry but I've never tried to merge a disc before so I don't know if it will work properly."
