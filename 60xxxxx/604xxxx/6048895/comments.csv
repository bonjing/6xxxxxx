[V],twentyforty,2010-12-18T16:58Z,"@vish55: I have 272p of that movie and if you're interested, peek into 272p movie pack coming few hours from now.

@DSIN: People have .NFO (small file, text, inside torrent) for all that - so detailed, that anyone interested could reproduce full encoding settings.

Regarding your requests, eXistenZ would be encoded again - this time as 720p. I usually try to obey requested format. Happiness is inside new 272p pack and would be here few hours from now."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-18T17:09Z,"@kanha: Thanks. Take a peek in new 272p torrent few hours from now.

@ALL: All ""hidden"" and ""openly"" placed requests are encoded. 272p ones would be upped (90% is on server right now) few hours from now.

Other ones - you cannot see/find inside that torrent - are either BluRay or HDTV encodings and would be upped as separate torrent in next couple of days.

So - ANY FURTHER REQUEST WOULD BE IGNORED - and be nice and show respect not just to me, but to all good people around."
