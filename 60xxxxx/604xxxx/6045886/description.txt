PLOT:


A Grinch-like thief retreats to her hometown in Connecticut after a con goes bad and gets stuck baby-sitting her niece and nephew until their parents can make it home for Christmas. She spends most of her time devising ways to even the score with Clive, her partner in crime, until the spirit of the holidays can help put her priorities back on track. 

Professional thief Kate Dove (Shannen Doherty) takes refuge in her hometown after a heist goes bad. Unwittingly, she is roped into a role unfamiliar to her - babysitter to her sister's kids during the Christmas holiday. Not the most nurturing or sentimental person, Kate finds herself casing the neighborhood for her next big score. Eventually the comforts of suburban life make her realize family and friends might be better than a life of crime. 
   

TAGLINE:


She went from naughty to nice.
