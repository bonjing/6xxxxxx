Class Trip (1998)

Film Review
La Classe de neige is a deceptively simple psychological thriller which merges real-world brutality and childhood fantasy to create a disturbing exploration of an adolescent mind. The shy, well-behaved Nicholas appears to inhabit a happy, bourgeois family background, but in truth he is trapped in a nightmarish world where horrific thoughts distort his vision of reality.

There is a strong moral lesson here about the extent to which children are vulnerable to their parentsâ€™ â€“ and indeed societyâ€™s â€“ view of the world. Nicholasâ€™ father is paranoid about what might happen to his son â€“ and, as it turns out, there is a good reason for his paranoia. So he smothers his son with affection and is overly protective - we never quite know how far this goes, but there is a strong hint that child abuse might be involved. The effect of this on Nicholas is devastating â€“ basically his life is ruined. By knowing too much about the worldâ€™s horrors, Nicholasâ€™ world becomes nothing but horror. This may not be a particularly original idea, but the film covers the territory with tremendous imagination and impact.

Although it is a faithful adaptation of Emmanuel CarrÃ¨re best-selling novel, the film is a work of art in its own right. The strongest element of the film, without any question, is the photography. The visual imagery combines BuÃ±uelesque surrealism with visceral horror, whilst maintaining a strong underlying theme and without undermining the strong characterisation. The bleak, snowy landscape in which the film is set provides an icy cold feel which somehow makes Nicholasâ€™ nightmares more frighteningly real and provide a bridge to his troubled sub-conscious thoughts.

Although there is some pretty mild horror (twitching severed body parts in the remarkable "Monkeyâ€™s Paw" sequence), there is nothing truly shocking â€“ although such imagery has a strong impact when placed beside pictures of a school trip. The shock comes more from the situation itself â€“ the fact that a young boy could have such a distorted vision of reality.

Claude Millerâ€™s direction is near-faultless, and he is served admirably from some talented child actors. Miller worked as a production assistant to such giants as Truffaut and CarnÃ©, and that influence is felt in this film.

This is a film that is not only an excellent piece of French cinema, but one that has a strong message for our society concerning the susceptibility of children to corrupting influences. In a world where it has become the norm to regard children as young adults, this is a timely reminder which cannot be repeated too frequently.
