Phantasy  Star  Universe:  Ambition  of  the  Illuminus  is  the
expansion  pack  for  the  popular  Phantasy Star Universe game,
bringing  a  more  personalized  and interactive universe to the
acclaimed  series.  In  addition to new enemies, weapons, levels
and  cities  there  will be more options available for gamers to
further  individualize  and customize the look of their avatars.
Ambition  of  the  Illuminus  continues  the  exciting PSU story
online as the player's personal online avatar is now the central
character,  investigating  and  working  to restore peace in the
chaotic  Gurhal System. The player investigates through a series
of  single-player  missions,  meeting  familiar  characters like
Ethan Waber from Episode 1, along with other new ones, including
a  GUARDIAN  instructor,  Laia Martinez. In addition, the online
multiplayer   world,   with   its  fast-paced,  engaging  battle
experience for up to six players, has been greatly expanded with
new missions, new cities and new enemies.
