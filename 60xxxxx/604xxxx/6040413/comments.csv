Please seed for another half-day or so, so that the rest of us who stick around can seed and keep this torrent alive now that the US SEGA server is dead."

,XeroLP,2011-01-07T22:41Z,"Wow, i cant belive this is still alive. I remember playing the demo on 360, because they weren't shipping the game to my country. Finally i can play through the story, even though its singleplayer. Thank you for this awesome torrent. Will seed as much as i can."
,Helepheil,2011-01-22T07:21Z,"I've been waiting for this torrent forever. I don't usually seed past 100% return rate but this... I'll do my best to keep it alive! Also, private server information if anyone wants it, go to http://psumods.co.uk/forums 

It's made by a veteran player updated and made better on an extremely regular basis and has a great community! "
,TBC33,2011-02-09T22:02Z,Any idea how to get the game to work?  Thanks.
,Triketra,2011-02-12T00:40Z,"do a google search for PSUmods, I haven't tried it yet but will when I get all the files downloaded, but they have created a private server for everyone!"
