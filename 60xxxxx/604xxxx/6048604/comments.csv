Also, Science channel somehow aired next weeks episode of Ghost Lab while Discovery channel will be airing this weeks episode.
They will be posted in due time."
,korygoblue,2010-12-18T05:09Z,thanks very much. we don't get this in Canada.

If anybody would like to send a nifty DVR or PCI TV card this way for the holidays, I'd be much obliged and able to post piles of episodes.  That is however much my upload speeds will allow.  My ISP is one of those butthead monopolizing companies that throttles bandwidth simply because they can."
,korygoblue,2010-12-18T07:08Z,oh by the way there is one more episode to air on the 7th of January

Not this again.  If there really is, post a link of your source for this information.  

I've been told before there's another episode of a season when there really wasn't.

No offense, but prove it."
