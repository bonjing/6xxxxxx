,rlinick,2011-01-13T11:14Z,"@ GlorygunsZ:

I will correct you.  1920x1080 is a 16:9 ratio.  HD television as well as some movies are in this ratio.  However...the director of any film can decide if they want the movie to be a wider ratio such as anamorphic widescreen. 

Assuming all movies would be the same ratio would be like assuming all painting would have to be same size and shape as well.  Film is an art and it is up the interpretation of the artist as to what the best ratio should be.

This is why this movie, along with a majority of all other movies, are not actually 1920x1080.

It is still considered 1080p because it still has 1920 vertical lines and has as many horizontal lines as are possible for this film."

I have the blu-ray disc of this but no blu-ray player on my computer, so I decided to download it. Got dinged by ISP for copyright infringement after about 12 hours into the download despite having up-to-date PeerBlock running.
