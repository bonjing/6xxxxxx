Hackmeister, you're a fucking dick for posting this.

,pomplamoosefan,2010-12-21T03:45Z,"THANK YOU so much hackmiester for sharing this. It's not because I have downloaded it for free that I won't donate a book. 

Sharing is never stealing, it's always caring. "
,jeffapotimus,2010-12-22T04:22Z,"So why won't you then? If you had then you wouldn't need to download it, so what's your big moral objection to buying a book for a school system so poor it was the first one in the US to ever go bankrupt? That was over 20 years ago and it hasn't improved since then.

Look, it's not like I'm not all over this site all the time. I'm a musician myself and I only wish I was popular enough for anyone to want to download my music for free. I'm not saying all piracy is wrong, but the way I see it, piracy is the consequence of greed. And this album and the impetus behind it represent the opposite of that.

So in this case, yeah, you're not really sharing. Just copying something that was originally shared with someone who chose to share what they had to buy a fucking book for some kids that don't even have fucking computers that they can get onto fucking pirate bay with and download fucking books."
,hackmiester,2010-12-26T10:07Z,"I knew someone would post that. Jeff, I realise this. There are several reasons to not want to donate, and I have none of them. I already berate people for stealing the album in the description. The fact is, some people just won't donate no matter what, whether they can't, or don't want to, or whatever, but I still want them to enjoy good music."
,wrocnrob,2011-01-01T18:57Z,"Since you bothered to ask it must be important somebody; I will look into the book drive.  I was only interested in the Christmas album torrent because of the Hyundai ads, and I would not have  bought it.  Who uses books anymore, anyway?  BTW, bandwidth isn't free.  My ISP is about $2/day."
,jeffapotimus,2011-01-02T18:24Z,"poor kids. poor kids that don't have computers or ipods or kindles. they are the ones who still use books. hopefully, anyway. If not, then they'll soon use other things like crack, or guns and whatnot.

I'm sorry, there is nobody surfing this website that is worse off than these kids unless you're surfing from an internet cafe in like sierra leone or something."
,wrocnrob,2011-01-02T23:13Z,"I just meant there might be more effective ways to help, like cash donations, which I did because the artists seemed to actually care about this issue.

They might have done better to give away ""Up On The House"" through the Hyundai website in return for a cash donation.  It is very good; maybe it will become a classic.  I wish the torrent was a higher bitrate.  Anyway, the shipping costs don't benefit those kids."
,jeffapotimus,2011-01-04T21:20Z,"buy a few books then. then shipping is free. and the artists care because because we are all directly affected by more ignorant people in the world.

and cash donations? really? that's more effective? you're absolutely sure ALL your money will be spent on books? i'd much rather give a homeless guy a burrito than a dollar.

these are pretty weak arguments. but whatever."
,wrocnrob,2011-01-05T04:31Z,"I wasn't trying to establish an argument for not donating.  Clearly, the artist and it is art even if they didn't write the lyrics or the tune but they do have their unique spin, they would like a donation to the Richmond Book Drive.  I just chose to give cash instead of a book.  Maybe they need eggnog.   Anyway, glad you put up the torrent.  Feliz Navidad, propero ano y felicidad"
