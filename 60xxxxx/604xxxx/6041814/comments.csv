Why do you think it was ANONYMOUS that uploaded it?  Didn't want a target painted on his thick fucking skull.  I hope the mods have the good taste to remove this, if only for the fact that anyone who downloads this should be going straight to hell anyway >.>"
,Strikefear13,2010-12-15T16:42Z,"Regardless of the comment saying you should pay first.  Who do you think ACTUALLY will before grabbing a torrent?  Remove this, please."
,bakaonna,2010-12-15T17:40Z,"Why should it be removed ? I would buy it if I wouldn't have bought Braid, Machinarium and Osmos already, and I still might for the other two. However, I will play them first and decide if I like them.
Still, I agree to some of the points made - since you can pay however little or much you consider they are worth, even if I like on of the remaining games one tiny bit, I'll buy the pack."
,Ru7v42pl0,2010-12-15T18:58Z,"Anyone saying this shouldn't be here is a moron and hypocrite.. How is this different from anything else you can download here?  

It being a penny doesn't change anything.

Thanks for the upload, it is exactly what I was looking for."
,blazemore,2010-12-15T19:54Z,"Come on, it clearly says in the description ""PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS UNTIL YOU'VE PAID""

I think it's great that there's a way to get all the games at once, and take a load off their servers as well!
If people are dead-set on not paying they can just find the HTTP links somewhere else; there's no DRM.
This is just an easy way to grab them all at once, which is NOT provided by the Bundle website.

I hope everyone enjoys playing these great indie games, and I strongly urge you to support the developers and charities."
,jan-the-pirat,2010-12-15T22:00Z,"well.. i don't have a international credit card, so can't really buy anything online, from outside of denmark, or atleast, i havent figured out how to do it yet, so thats why i am here..
altho its pretty awesome that you can pick your own price, so just pay as much you can spare :P"
,n47jhg,2010-12-17T00:45Z,I didn't pay for these
,blazemore,2010-12-17T17:08Z,"Well that's your lookout, but I hope you enjoy the games anyway.
I urge you to reconsider though."
,Seygantte,2010-12-21T03:13Z,"I fail to understand comments like ""anyone who downloads this should be going straight to hell anyway >.> ""

If I steal a game from EA that costs ĂÂŁ40 it's ok, but if I steal a game from some indie developers that I can buy for a penny that's wrong? By my calculations its 4000x worse to steal the former. It's just a penny so why is it so morally outrageous? Whether you pay a penny or pirate it doesn't make an ounce of difference to them, but going to the trouble of sorting out internet payment methods may mean a hell of a lot of effort.

Even though I bought it, I would prefer not to have my credit card details touch my PC *puts on tin foil hat*


tl;dr pirating this pack doesn't make you a dick any more than getting it for a penny would. If you pay then pay though, cus it is charity."
,Seygantte,2010-12-21T03:14Z,*If you can pay then you should pay
,Teraunce,2010-12-29T21:17Z,"or, like some of us, didn't find out about the bundle until after it was over, which is a sad thing."
,iycgtptyarvg,2011-02-16T00:40Z,"I don't understand why these bundles can't be bought always. Why would they STOP offering this on their web-site?!?

If I'm mistaken somehow, please tell me. But, I thinks it's now no longer possible to pay for the bundle."
,Elysium07,2011-04-14T15:45Z,"Thank you for this, didn't find out about the bundle until it was too late sadly, I'll make sure to donate extra for the next time they have one of these. Which seems to be now. :D"
,Insomneac,2011-04-18T21:26Z,"It's funny how these Indie Bundles suddenly give some of the thieves here a moral backbone.

Who the hell are you to dictate to others what's right or wrong?

I can afford to pay for this, and I don't really want the games, but just to give you the shits, I'm downloading it.

Then I'll be uploading it to all the private sites I'm a member of."
,alexcinderpelt,2012-02-05T07:02Z,i dont freaking care how cheap any of these humble bundles are im only 14 and i cant get any money in anyways possible yet so this is how i get games if i missed the release or if they are not sold anymore so shut the fuck up
,zombird,2012-02-12T05:06Z,"Don't fucking buy these bundles for a penny. It costs them more than a penny for Paypal and bandwidth fees, you're owing them money if you do that. Fucking retarded people like Strikefear13 are worse than people that torrent it for free."
