          You're invited to a zany holiday celebration, as           
        Kermit and all of his showbiz pals head for the country      
        to spend Christmas at Fozzie's Mum's farmhouse! With         
        snow falling outside and more friends dropping by -          
        carol singers from Sesame Street and visitors from           
        Fraggle Rock - something magical happens! The sparkle        
        of the stage lights up the farmhouse as the Muppets          
        share their gifts of music, a play and of course,            
        Fozzie's stand-up comedy act. When Miss Piggy arrives        
        - through sleet and snow - to catch Kermit under the         
        mistletoe, the cast is complete for a warm and               
        wonderful Muppet Family Christmas!

          It's crossover bonanza! Today the rights to the            
        various Muppet characters are spread between Henson,         
        Disney and Sesame Workshop, but that was not the case        
        when Jim was still alive. It wasn't often characters         
        would meet across universes, and this is indeed the          
        only time that Muppets, Fraggles, Sesame Street              
        inhabitants and even Muppet Babies are all present           
        in the same special. Heck, even Jim makes an                 
        appearance! The Muppet Babies are cleverly presented         
        in a flashback home video viewing, so this is also           
        a rare appearance of Muppet Babies outside animation         
        - yet another treat!                                         
                                                                     
          Due to the above-mentioned character rights issues,        
        as well as for several other reasons (music rights,          
        broadcast edits etc) this special has suffered many          
        cuts over the years. The most complete home video            
        version is this long out of print R2 2003 DVD release,       
        which has less incidental music, and lacks two brief         
        scenes. To bring you the most complete experience            
        possible, we have included these cut scenes as extras,       
        grabbed from the original 1987 ABC airing, the only          
        time they were ever shown. We've also thrown in a            
        few of the original promos, some of them of questionable     
        quality, but enjoyable nonetheless. There's even a           
        short bumper featuring Kermit and Fozzie, also only          
        ever seen during the original airing, taken from one         
        of the commercial breaks with Kermit announcing that         
        the special will return shortly.

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.

                  for the rainbow connection, and remember
