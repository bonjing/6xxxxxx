,sleepy123,2010-12-18T01:25Z,Good to see you back. Couldn't figure why they would ban you.
[T],keka_umans,2010-12-18T01:36Z,i was startin to think i'd never see this one thanks for the upload
,sozan,2010-12-18T01:50Z,what happened to you WMI
,daMouse,2010-12-18T02:43Z,"Quick, butter her up she's sizzling!"
[T],webmodelsindex,2010-12-18T02:50Z,"I was banned, and my torrents were deleted. This site has a new policy to not allow child models. I had been reported, but since I do not upload child models, only Fame-Girls (who are all over 18), the ban was lifted.

The mods were nice and swift to reverse the ban. I am allowed to upload Fame-Girls torrents again. Next one will be Sunday night (Sandra)."
,fenderjoe,2010-12-18T03:01Z,"Thanks WMI, and thanks to the mods for brining you back so soon. Ella has become my Friday fix."
,sozan,2010-12-18T03:09Z,hot set thanks
,jacksin01,2010-12-18T03:11Z,Nice to see you back.....thanx for all you do ....
,cult22,2010-12-18T03:58Z,"Great to see you back 
are you going to resize the file?"
,captainkhaos1966,2010-12-18T04:11Z,Good to have you back and thanks for all your Famegirl uploads
,wolf421,2010-12-18T04:54Z,"Yeah they went retroactive ban happy and banned me for the same thing... 
I've posted all of two torrents here and one of them was Sandra's wedding pictures...
WTF?
Wedding pictures...Oh come on now....wedding pictures?

One of the mods lifted my ban when I explained to him that I'm not uploading torrents here anymore and the one they banned me for was over a year ago and not even seeding it anymore...
Ban lifted with a nice warning attached... "
,violetlt,2010-12-18T04:58Z,"Ah, thank god! I've been looking forward to this all week."
,ircaddicts,2010-12-18T05:21Z,sounds like the pap homos have taken over TPB  sad oh well many other torrent sites out there
,Ioxen,2010-12-18T05:22Z,"So the proud days of TPB neutrality on the internet-rights front are over?
TPB is no longer a non judgemental partner in issue not involving legality but morality?
Sad SAD day, but it may be that this site died a long time ago..."

Take a look at pic 72, pretty sure there's a nipple somewhere"
,beccyd,2010-12-18T10:58Z,"Yet again Ella proves she is the HOTTEST of the three, Nice set, thx for the upload."
,yarisdude,2010-12-18T13:14Z,"They're propably giving in to legal pressures. Next thing all ""illegal"" torrents will be removed and only ""home clean"" torrents are allowed."
,booble2010,2010-12-18T14:02Z,"Ella is v. good. 

and hurrah for the mods here finally getting a grip on the child model spam."
,daMouse,2010-12-18T15:52Z,"Thanks for your support, webmodelsindex!

I don't believe there is any policy until I see one spelled out. There never has been, but rather the random actions of some moderator throwing a hissy fit at anything he doesn't approve of for the day. If there's been any policy in the past it's randomness. Wth is 'underage' anyway in the context of things. But I digress, it's great to have you here."
,devolve,2010-12-18T16:05Z,"I had the same thing happen to me. Came to upload a sandra torrent, and my login wasn't working. Checked with a MOD and was advised that someone had reported me for child porn. They don't really have time to check the contents of the torrent I would guess, so ban straight away. If you question it, then they look into it further. "
,lodger111,2010-12-18T16:28Z,"What daMouse said.  TPB's ""official policy"" depends which newly-appointed mod is swinging his e-peen around on a given day, and will have changed by the next.  Luckily there are still a few people at the controls who have a modicum of common sense between them."
,magetf,2010-12-18T19:47Z,"There is a post on suprbay about it.  


Seems very hypocritical to me."
,XxlKooLaiDlxX,2010-12-19T06:54Z,"Yeah, I saw that thread too.

I guess no more Darling, Sugar, Trixie, or Newstar Krystal :-("
,cyaninternetdog,2010-12-19T11:17Z,"Amazing set, hope this is the way they are taking Ella now. Thanks wmi and welcome back."
,yarisdude,2010-12-19T12:35Z,"Funny they should mention ""age of consent"". The age of consent in sweden is 15. Not 18."
,frogman001,2010-12-23T18:43Z,"All I want for xmas is an HD video of Ella. If Diana (Amber) has been making them for so long, why not Ella?   Actually, any video of Ella would be welcome!"
,FailedSuicideAttempt-,2010-12-25T00:43Z,"Thanxs WMI
This is re~dick-u-lous so many threads are gone?!?

anyone have a Better Torrent search site they'd like to recommend and is the Ella 124 set gone, or can someone post a link to it please?"
,foton2075,2011-01-26T03:54Z,tnx!!
