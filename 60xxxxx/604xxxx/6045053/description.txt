Amazon Review:
Just when you resign yourself to the fact that everything's probably been done in the world of holiday albums, a disc like A Joyful Noise comes along. Not that there's exactly anything new about the collection: with the exception of two originals, including the title track, the choices are all classics. But Jo Dee Messina brings a unique charm, warmth, and subtle sexiness to standards like "The Christmas Song" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," attributes that are often missing from yuletide releases. As a vocalist, Messina could teach today's pop divas a thing or two about how to create memorable vocals without resorting to histrionics. Vince Gill shows up to add even more charm on a duet of "Silver Bells." The nifty arrangements certainly count for a lot, and something like the haunting harmonica solo on "Let It Snow!" is truly unique to recordings of that particular song. But in the end, it's Messina's wonderful voice, spirit, and personality that make this the finest Christmas release of 2002.
