    A Repulsive yet Fascinating Glimpse into the Mind of a Deranged          
    Killer Michael Regardie is a lonely, delusional and sick religious       
    zealot of his own invented faith - a faith that justifies hideous        
    rituals of murder, rape and sexual torture. Absolution from his          
    escalating nihilism and debauchery may lie in his latest victim. But     
    as salvation seems at hand, a specter from his past demands              
    revenge...                                                               
                                                                             
    Depraved serial killer Michael Regardie invents a religion that          
    justifies his unspeakable crimes against humanity, but finds his         
    bloody quest for redemption unexpectedly complicated by the sudden       
    reappearance of a malevolent apparition from the past.
