Abraham-Hicks - 2012 & Earth's Future Compilation

EnJoy and Share - Please Seed

Because of the nature of this topic and the vast difference in the way Abraham is approaching the subject now as opposed to the early years in the 80's, these tracks have been arranged in the order that they were received from Abraham. There is at least one track (019 - Earth changes are neither new or unnatural) that gives an explanation as to why the approach is different. Bear in mind the earliest tracks (the first three) listed here are no longer being offered for sale at the Abraham-Hicks.com website. I still felt compelled to offer them in the compilation as part of the history in the evolution of this topic. Some may feel that it is not a "feel good" approach (although they do not feel bad to me). History vs. "feel good". Feel free to skip those tracks if so inclined.

This is not all of the 2012 or Earth's Future questions that Abraham has answered over the years of recorded material, but it is a good sampling and it has been numbered so that it can be added to easily in the future when other tracks are found that one would want to add.
