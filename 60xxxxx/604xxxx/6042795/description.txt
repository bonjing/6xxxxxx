What They Said

\"Ultimately slick blend of styles which is all their own... Gorillaz is marked both by a sense of playfulness and a passion for experimentation\" - Amazon.co.uk
\"Judging by the music, Gorillaz could be a serene spaghetti western. The echoing taps of guitar and occasional harmonica tone map out a grand vista.\" - CMJ
\"For just daring to have one or two ideas in this thought-bereft pop nation, Gorillaz rule.\" - Dotmusic
\"Essential listening for anyone with a clue.\" - E! Online
\"Twenty-first century gimmicks aside, this is a suprisingly good album.\" - Grok
\"Gorillaz are difficult to love deeply, but impossible not to like. - Guardian
\"There\'s a refreshing home-made feel to these tunes.\" - Heat
\"An absolutely breathtaking, downtempo mix of ambient, atmospheric pop, experimental hip-hop and shadowy, King Tubbyâ€“style dub.\" - Maxim
\"A great pop record for the 21st century.\" - Music 365
\"Gorillaz have created something entirely new and fresh that is here to save us all.\" - Music Critic
