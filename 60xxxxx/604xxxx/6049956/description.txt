This band from Gothenburg/Sweden is best known for their appearance on the Rubbles ("Jack In The Box") and Fading Yellow (the great "King Of The World") compilations. They were more a pop and vocal group than a psychedelic band although they experienced at times with psych-pop ("Miss Judith Lee" for instance). This compilation of singles and album tracks (they released two lp's) was released by Universal (Universal 018 333-2 /2003).
They never entered the top ten chart in Sweden but became popular in Denmark, Belgium and Holland. They toured a lot and when in England they met Eric Stewart (later in 10cc) who helped them with several songs.
