Abstract:
You do not have Grand Theft Auto IV?, Not what Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Episodes from? So I propose an unbeatable offer: play and downloadable content both on the same disc and about 40 euros.

Rockstar Games has put up for sale Grand Theft Auto: Complete Edition, edition as its name suggests includes the best-selling GTA IV downloadable content and both subsequently released (The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony).

What Shall I tell you, is an essential issue if you have not played any of them, a very affordable price for all content that brings, and over a bridge is to enjoy it."

,Happy_amg,2011-10-21T00:01Z,"1) Download FIX; torrent; [GTA_Complete_Edition][BLES01128].torrent

2) This is the guide;

Guide:
The games ID has to be BLES01128(The Euro version)
This is a rewritten not revised tutorial of AlexVillas version and is done without his consent.The purpose of this tutorial is to be able to load the game Internally on kmeaw 3.55 CFW (Multiman [DeanK's legendary app] 2.00.02 or higher required [I'm currently using the latest version 2.01.00] )

1 *) If you have any install data or patches delete them.

2 *) Enter Multiman, use the file explorer (or press select-start on the game to go to it's location in file explorer) locate the folder in which you store your backups (GAMES or GAMEZ) and inside the gta4 game folder look for the folder PS3_GAME and press O(Circle) and choose ""shadow for PKG game "" then say yes. and wait 

3 *) Now go into dev_hdd0/game and delete the folder BLES01128 that you just created

4 *) With Multiman(Blackbox ftp or with a usb[I used a usb]) ftp/transfer and replace the following files in the correct directories :

4**) replace the COMP.BIN with the modded one in this directory dev_hdd0/G/E01128/USRDIR Note: This is where I messed up the first several times as I did not notice the G folder in dev_hdd0 do not replace the COMP.BIN in the gta4 folder in your GAMES or GAMEZ directory. Also make a back up of the original, just in case.

4***) Go to your GAMES or GAMEZ directory where you have the game folder at and replace the EBOOT.BIN with the modded one(make a copy of the original, just in case).

5 *) Load the game with Multiman(or any manager you choose but I used Multiman)

6*) If it doesn't work try the FIX PERMISSIONS app included(Although the app freeze's on me and I just use the fix permissions that comes with multiman)


SIDENOTES: If you have any previous gamesaves, there ""might"" be a chance it won't work. You don't have to delete them, just transfer them out run gta 4 and let it install the game data. When done exit back to xmb and transfer the gamesaves back and then just play.

if there is any more problems please let me know and with exact details. I hope this helped and you enjoy this game as much as I have so far.

Super sidenote: Huge props to alexvillas for the upload in the first place.
