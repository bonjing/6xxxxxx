After a career spanning five decades, over 128 million worldwide record sales,
three dozen Top Forty hits, a Grammy and a Golden Globe, Neil Diamond was just
getting started. The legendary singer-songwriter was then lined up to create his
very own new moments in music at the closing night of the Radio 2 Electric Proms
2010.

The very special gig showcased this incredible performer as he revisited the songs
he loves and his own classic back catalogue of music in the intimate surroundings
of the Roundhouse. Best known for writing and performing classic songs like I'm A
Believer, Sweet Caroline and I Am... I Said, his performance featured a journey
through some glittering hits plus, for the first time, live tracks from his forthcoming
album, Dreams. Dreams features some of the greatest songs of the rock era,
including tracks from The Beatles, Leonard Cohen, The Eagles and Randy
Newman.
