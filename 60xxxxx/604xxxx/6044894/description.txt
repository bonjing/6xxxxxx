What They Said

"G-Sides is a fun album; it's as addictive as underage drinking is to George Dubya's daughters." - CMJ
"G-Sides acts as a nifty companion piece to the album and looks ace too." - Dotmusic
"If you're a dedicated fan you'll own everything on 'G-Sides' already. But everyone else should just give in to Gorillaz." - NME
"The animated outfit fashions words of praise and ecstasy into a delirious gospel throwdown, a collision between a carload of still-buzzing ravers and a bus packed with hymn-singing believers." - Rolling Stone
