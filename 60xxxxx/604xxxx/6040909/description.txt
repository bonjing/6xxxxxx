                          Conan (2010- )
Conan is an American late-night talk show airing each Monday through Thursday on TBS in the United States. The hour-long show premiered on November 8, 2010, and is hosted by writer, comedian and performer Conan O'Brien. The program's host previously starred on NBC's Late Night with Conan O'Brien, which followed The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for 16 years, until O'Brien's brief tenure as host of The Tonight Show.

Describing itself as a traditional late-night talk show, Conan draws its comedy from recent news stories, political figures, prominent celebrities, as well as aspects of the show itself. The show typically opens with a monologue from Conan O'Brien relating to recent headlines and frequently features exchanges with his sidekick, Andy Richter, and members of the audience. The next segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to media personalities and political figures. The show then closes with either a musical or comedy performance.

In January 2010, after The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien had been on the air for seven months, it was announced that NBC intended to move Jay Leno from primetime back to his original timeslot, with O'Brien's show starting shortly after midnight. Following a brief conflict, NBC announced that they had paid $45 million to buy out O'Brien's contract, ending his relationship with the network. Months after his official leave, O'Brien went on a comedy tour, entitled The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, which was largely inspired by the outpouring of support for O'Brien on the internet during the conflict. It was announced on the first day of the tour that O'Brien would be joining TBS in November.

On TBS, Conan airs Mondays through Thursdays beginning at 11:00 p.m., and is immediately followed by comedian George Lopez on his talk show, entitled Lopez Tonight. Comedian and actor Andy Richter continues his role as sidekick to O'Brien, and as the show's announcer. Conan's long-time house band continues with the host under the new moniker Jimmy Vivino and the Basic Cable Band, with Max Weinberg being replaced as bandleader by guitarist Jimmy Vivino and as drummer by regular substitute James Wormworth, both of whom regularly substituted for Weinberg during his brief departures.

Monologue
Each episode begins with announcer and sidekick Andy Richter announcing the show's guests, as well as the episode's title (unlike most late-night talk shows, each episode is given a humorous title similar to those found in sitcoms and other scripted series). Richter then goes on to introduce O'Brien, who then opens the show with a monologue drawing from current news stories and issues. The monologue will often be accompanied by clips and comedy skits,[3] in addition to occasional interactions between O'Brien and Richter, and the audience.

     Sketches and comedy bits
Further information: List of Conan sketches
New sketches include O'Brien utilizing his Conan blimp for various events, including following actor Gary Busey around southern California. Popular Late Night and Tonight Show character the Masturbating Bear, was also reintroduced on the series premiere on November 8, 2010.[4] O'Brien originally retired the Masturbating Bear at the end of his Late Night run due to concerns about its inappropriateness in the 11:30 time slot on The Tonight Show.[5] Series writer Deon Cole has also been featured, introducing several "black commercials" to the audience.

     Celebrity interviews
Conan follows the established six-piece format, used during O'Brien's tenure as host of The Tonight Show and Late Night, as well as numerous other talk shows in the genre, across various networks. Each episode of Conan is 60 minutes in length, including commercials,[6] and usually features either one or two celebrity interviews and a following musical performance or stand-up comedy act.[7] Guests come from a wide range of cultural sources, and include actors, musicians, authors, athletes and political figures.[citation needed]

The show airs Monday through Thursday, similar to the schedule of Late Night with Conan O'Brien which aired Tuesdays through Fridays until 2006.[8] Conan's hour-long 11 p.m. timeslot directly competes with Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, as well as the first 25 minutes of NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and CBS's Late Show with David Letterman.[9]

     Musical/comedy guests
The show's final segment typically features a performance by either a musical guest or a stand-up comedian, preceding the closing credits to the show. An avid guitar player, O'Brien has been given many guitars as gifts from several musical guests,[10] and on occasion, featured himself on acoustic guitar in a comedy sketch. He also played electric guitar during the first episode's performance of "Twenty Flight Rock" with musical guest Jack White.


     The Tonight Show Conflict
On September 27, 2004, NBC officially declared that Conan O'Brien, then host of Late Night with Conan O'Brien would take over as host of The Tonight Show in 2009, replacing Jay Leno, after a seventeen year run. This was accompanied by reports that Leno had told Jeff Zucker, the President of NBC Entertainment, of his plans to retire that same year.[12] On the following night's Tonight Show, Leno explained that he wanted to avoid the hardship that he had experienced in his competition with David Letterman over who would take over the show after Johnny Carson retired; Leno also said O'Brien was "certainly the most deserving person for the job."[13] In 2008, however, several reports emerged that Leno, still the ratings champion in the timeslot, was rethinking his departure plans.[14] Speculation was put to an end when it was announced he would instead host a new prime-time variety show on NBC entitled The Jay Leno Show, which aired weeknights at 10:00 p.m. from September 14, 2009, until the show's cancellation on February 9, 2010.[15] On January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Jay Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot to 11:35 p.m., due to pressure from affiliates, for a thirty minute show. NBC also cited Conan's poor ratings against David Letterman as being responsible for the timeslot change, though it was widely speculated[16] that Conan's numbers were down as a result of Jay's poor lead-in.[17] O'Brien's contract stipulated that NBC could move the show back to 12:05 a.m. without penalty, though the stipulation was mainly to be used for the limited run late-night NBC Sports recap shows for Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, rather than a permanent relocation, leaving him with no apparent recourse other than resignation.[18][19]

After two weeks of negotiations, on January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan O'Brien had signed a $45 million deal to leave the network.[20][21] As part of the agreement with NBC, O'Brien was prohibited from performing on the internet, television or radio until September 1, 2010. O'Brien was also prohibited from making negative comments about the situation, NBC or Leno during this period. It was also expected that certain intellectual property including characters, comedy pieces or bits that O'Brien created during his time at NBC would become the property of NBC, therefore prohibiting his use of them in the future at TBS. However, NBC Universal TV Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin stated that those conversations have yet to take place, stating that they "wish Conan the best."

      The Legally Prohibited Tour
On March 11, 2010, O'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour, entitled The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.[23] Many locations sold out within hours of the announcement, and additional shows were added on to meet demand. The tour began on April 12, 2010 in Eugene, Oregon, and ended on June 14, 2010 in Atlanta, Georgia.[24] It incorporated many elements from his tenure hosting Late Night and The Tonight Show, and included video bits, comic performers, and cameo appearances by celebrities. O'Brien joked about the legal constraints placed on him by NBC, for example having to rename the Masturbating Bear, the "Self-Pleasuring Panda", in order to avoid a lawsuit.[25] O'Brien also performed music throughout the show, including the disco hit "I Will Survive" and a personal parody of "On the Road Again".[25] Comedian Reggie Watts appeared on the tour as the opening act for O'Brien.[26]

TBS announcement
 
Conan O'Brien at a supporter rally held outside TBS headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia in June 2010.Shortly before the tour began, O'Brien announced that he had signed a deal with cable network TBS to host a talk show on their late-night lineup, beginning in November 2010. Before the deal was announced, O'Brien initially had reservations about the move, as it would place comedian George Lopez's show, Lopez Tonight, one hour later to midnight, effectively doing to Lopez what NBC had wanted to do with O'Brien. However, Lopez reportedly called O'Brien and expressed his excitement about the move.[27] Lopez went on to state, "I can't think of anything better than doing my show with Conan as my lead-in [...] It's the beginning of a new era in late-night comedy."[28] In an official press release by Turner Broadcasting, it stated that O'Brien had only begun negotiations a week prior to the official announcement of the show.[28] Steve Koonin, President of Turner Entertainment Networks, went on to comment of the announcement, "Conan has been the comedic voice for a generation. TBS already has a huge audience of young comedy lovers, and Conanâ€™s show will give these fans even more reasons to watch our network."[28]

In his own statement about the deal, O'Brien stated, "In three months Iâ€™ve gone from network television to Twitter to performing live in theaters, and now Iâ€™m headed to basic cable. My plan is working perfectly."[28][29] O'Brien's production company, Conaco, reportedly owns all rights to the show.[30] In addition to the announcement of the television series, TBS also announced a one-hour TBS Special, featuring several writers for Conan, as well as comedian Reggie Watts, who participated in O'Brien's Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour.[31] The show was broadcast on June 27, 2010, leading up to the beginning of Conan in early-November.[31] Additionally, in preparation for the show, a 24-hour "Live-Coco Cam" was set up on October 20, 2010,[32] and featured various characters and staff members of Conan, including Richie Rosenberg, otherwise known as "LaBamba,"[33] as well as a short online broadcast from O'Brien's office entitled "Show Zero" on November 1, 2010. The show featured O'Brien as host, and was accompanied by Andy Richter, as well as Jimmy Vivino, a member of the Basic Cable Band. The broadcast hosted several guests, including actor Jim Parsons and indie rock band Steel Train, and lasted a total of four minutes, and 51 seconds.[34]

Weeks before the premiere, an orange Conan blimp was introduced to further promote the show. Designed by Blue Sky, an Atlanta firm,[35] the dirigible provided aerial footage for 2010 Major League Baseball postseason games airing on TBS. It has since been incorporated into sketches on Conan, including a running gag where the blimp would follow actor Gary Busey around southern California, much to his chagrin.[36]

Series premiere
 
Actor Seth Rogen was O'Brien's first official interview during the series premiere, following Arlene Wagner.The first episode of Conan, entitled "Baa Baa Blackmail",[11] premiered on Monday, November 8, 2010 at 11 p.m. EST on TBS.[37] The episode's first guest was Arlene Wagner, the curator of Leavenworth, Washington's Nutcracker Museum.[38][39] Wagner's position as Conan's debut guest was chosen by fans through a "rigged" poll at Conan O'Brien's official website, TeamCoco.com. The poll also consisted of Pope Benedict XVI, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, performers Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, and actor Jack Nicholson, among others.[39] Wagner's brief appearance was followed by actor and comedian Seth Rogen and actress Lea Michele, along with musical guest Jack White, who performed "Twenty Flight Rock", along with O'Brien himself.[11][40] Actor Jon Hamm, appearing as his character Don Draper from the AMC series Mad Men, and talk show host Larry King, of CNN's Larry King Live, made cameo appearances in the show's cold open, with actor and comedian Ricky Gervais sending Conan a pre-taped message expressing his well wishes on the new series, then going on to express condolences for future job losses.[11]

Reviews of the premiere episode by television critics were positive, calling it "a looser, quirkier take on a late-night talk show, but still a late-night talk show."[11] James Poniewozik of Time found the episode to be enjoyable, and compared it to O'Brien's tenure during Late Night. Itzkoff went on to state, "The message, overall [...] is that Conan the show is not so much about a reinvention of the talk show form as a restoration of Conan. He was doing something he wanted to do, a late-night talk show, and NBC made him stop doing it." He also praised the opening monologue, and Conan's performance with Jack White during the episode's conclusion.[11] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press went on to call the episode "a stylishly back-to-basics hour that radiated hard-won lessons from his brief stay hosting The Tonight Show," in addition to admiring O'Brien's "appealingly stoked yet comfortable" appearance on the show.[41] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly also appreciated the Masturbating Bear cameo, and went on to call the show "pleasant, if a bit underwhelming."[42] Less positive assessments of the show included Tom Gliatto of People, who accused the show of being a "modest, lowkey and slightly awkward affair."

       Ratings
In overnight Nielsen Ratings, the series premiere of Conan drew 4,100,000 viewers, leading all late-night talk shows, with a 600,000 viewer margin of victory over The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on NBC, and more than tripling the audience of its direct competition, The Daily Show and The Colbert Report on Comedy Central. In the 18-49 demographic Conan drew a 2.5 rating and 3,285,000 viewers. It was also watched by 2,451,000 adults in the 18-34 demographic.[44] Ratings throughout the rest of the week fell, and ended with over 2.02 million viewers on Thursday, November 11, 2010. The fourth episode still led every talk show in the 18-34 and 18-49 demographics, however, delivering 980,000 adults and 1,361,000 adults respectively.[45] The median viewer age for the first week of shows was projected to be at 32,[45] significantly younger than that of The Tonight Show and Late Show.[46] Viewers of Conan were mostly male, lower income, and were more likely to live in urban centers.[46] Conan was also high in minority viewership among both African Americans and Hispanics.[46] The show also premiered in Canada, on The Comedy Network at midnight, drawing 171,000 viewers, and the repeat broadcast at 1 AM on CTV drew 302,000 viewers.[47]

During O'Brien's second week, ratings remained somewhat consistent, and peaked on November 16, 2010, with 1.84 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings.[48] The week would go on to average 1.7 million viewers, and earn an average rating of 1.0 in the 18-49 demographic.[48]

       Jimmy Vivino & the Basic Cable Band
Conan O'Brien's longtime band, originally known as The Max Weinberg 7, then The Tonight Show Band, and later as the Legally Prohibited Band, serve as the Conan house band, and are fronted by longtime guitarist Jimmy Vivino.[54][55] The also consists of Richie "LaBamba" Rosenberg on trombone, Scott Healy on keyboard, Mike Merritt on bass guitar, Mark Pender on trumpet and Jerry Vivino on woodwinds. When the group moved to Los Angeles to play for The Tonight Show, they added an eighth member, James Wormworth, on percussion. Max Weinberg, who had served as O'Brien's bandleader and drummer since 1993, does not appear on the new program.[54][55] Weinberg was not a part of the Legally Prohibited Tour, and remained vague throughout most of 2010 about the possibility of his participation in the new TBS show.[56] Weinberg's decision was influenced by a combination of a major heart surgery he had in February 2010, and the fact that his family never left their native New Jersey, even during the Tonight Show period, both issues that he kept private until an October 2010 interview.[57] Percussionist James Wormworth, who often acted as Weinberg's on-air substitute, serves as the band's permanent drummer.[54][55]

Following Weinberg's exit, O'Brien sought to revamp the show's title theme song. In an interview with New York Magazine, O'Brien expressed his desire to create a new introduction from the previous Late Night and Tonight compositions, which were used for O'Brien's entire 17-year relationship with NBC, and ultimately unveil a new signature sound for the show. The new theme song was co-written by bandleader Jimmy Vivino, and O'Brien himself. Despite no obvious copyright issues to continue using the previous theme, which was written by Howard Shore and John Lurie, O'Brien stated of the transition to a new composition, "it just felt like the right thing to do [...] There's this feeling of, 'Let's try and build something new.' I came out to that theme for seventeen years and it does feel like, you know what? Let's try some new stuff. Let's try and change it up."

        International
In Australia, the program will air on GEM, a multichannel of the Nine Network. Originally it was intended to screen within 12 hours after its original U.S. broadcast at 11:30pm weeknights,[59] however GEM will now screen the program approximately 36 hours later, beginning on Wednesday, November 10, meaning the program will also air on Saturday nights. The Comedy Channel which aired the previous versions of Conan's shows announced it would not air the program as the Nine Network had exclusive rights to Time Warner programs.

In Canada, the program will air on cable channel The Comedy Network Monday to Thursday nights (Tuesday to Friday mornings) at midnight ET/PT, and repeated on broadcast network CTV at 1:05 a.m. local time.[60][61] The program was only initially announced for CTV, leading to some concern about the unusually late time slot, two hours after its airing in the United States for viewers in the Eastern Time Zone (CTV Atlantic viewers will see the program at 1:05 a.m. AT / 12:05 a.m. ET). This is due to local and national newscasts in the 11:00 p.m. hour, and CTV's existing commitments to The Daily Show with Jon Stewart at 12:05 a.m. and The Colbert Report at 12:35 a.m.[62] CTV executives later said the program would likely air earlier on The Comedy Network, owned by CTV.[62] That channel also appeared to have a conflict initially, since it has historically aired both Daily and Colbert during the 11:00 p.m. ET hour, simulcasting the Comedy Central feed. To make room for the simulcast of Conan, the channel moved both shows to the 10:00 p.m. hour on September 7, 2010. However, there were intermittent "technical difficulties" with getting the shows in time for the earlier airing â€“ most significantly on October 25 and 26, 2010, when The Daily Show broadcast live at 11:00 p.m. ET from Washington, D.C., forcing the Canadian channel to air older episodes both nights. After viewer complaints about the missed episodes, Comedy elected to move both shows back to their previous timeslots, meaning that Conan will now air at midnight, on a one-hour delay from TBS.[63]

Selling rights to a Canadian channel was necessary, since TBS ceased being available in Canada in October 2007. The local Atlanta station through which Canadian cable subscribers had previously received TBS programming then adopted a distinct schedule as WPCH-TV. Some speculated that WPCH might pick up the program anyway, since the revamped station continues to air some of the same syndicated series as TBS, but WPCH later indicated explicitly that it had no plans to broadcast the new O'Brien program.[64]

Elsewhere, in Ireland, the show will air Monday to Thursday at midnight on 3e, exactly one week after their original air date.[65] Conan is also aired in Norway on the brand new digital television channel, Max, which launched on November 1 as a sister channel of TVNorge. It will air Monday to Thursday 10:50 p.m. UTC+1, exactly one week after their original air date.[65][66] In Turkey the program will begin airing on 22 November on CNBC-e. In Singapore, the program will air on SingTel, a video on demand service, with episodes becoming available 24 hours after broadcast in the United States.[65] In Portugal, the program began airing on November 29th on SIC Radical,[67] and in Israel, the show will begin airing on January 1, 2011 on the country's version of Comedy Central.[
