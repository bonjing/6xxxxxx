        Installation Notes

        Step #1:

        Run trillian-v5.0.0.29.exe and read below before doing install.

        It is prefered that you do not click Launch on the final
        installation Window, instead click the X at the top right.  If
        you clicked launch (don't worry nothing wrong can happen), close
        Trillian 5 down first.  Next copy precracked exe from the Crack
        folder to the installed folder of Trillian 5 Pro, making sure to
        overwrite the existing file.  If you have already setup your
        account with a previous version then your done, if not follow on
        to Step #2 below.

        Step #2:

        Launch Trillian 5 Pro and Register a new Trillian Account.  Fill
        out required information (real email is needed for confirmation)
        and make sure to UNCHECK I have previously purchased Trillian
        Pro.  Check your email and get confirmation code.  Apply code and
        now continue to setup your IM accounts.  You now how a fully
        registered version of Trillian 5 Pro!  Also remember the Trillian
        Account IS REQUIRED for your settings to be saved!

        Thats it!  Enjoy.
