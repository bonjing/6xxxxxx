,lp1973,2010-12-23T21:24Z,Warning! Virus  Backdoor.Win32.Infexor.ky	in \Crack\trillian.exe !!!	
,xLinezx,2010-12-26T09:40Z,"These are some serious morons.

@jinzounigen: Thats not from this, this has nothing to do with your 'mass emails' you probably signed up on some website and they used your email for advertisements. this is just a instant messanger.

@lp1973: Thats a crack, not a virus, your antivirus is a moron."
,mahapash,2011-01-03T09:17Z,@xLinezx... this shit is a Virus Backdoor.Win32.Infexor.ky.. Kaspersky detection..

,Kalilaff,2011-01-27T19:09Z,Norton Internet Security 2011 flagged this as a Backdoor.Trojan early this morning. I'm going to try to install it again but I believe that I have to add an exception to the folder I download in and the folder it installs in as well. Sucks :|

,krypking,2011-01-29T03:59Z,"the crack is a virus, thats why it keeps disappearing. i havent been able to find a good crack for build 29 anywhere, its like te took over. whoever is behind this is definitely not your friend, dont listen to anything he says and dont go looking for other torrents, anything from te is a virus."
[V],alexisthebest,2011-01-31T12:52Z,"CRACK ISNT A VIRUS

i know the uploader and it's clean.

seriously

just dont let your antivirus scan the crack.

Because it's a crack, the antivirus says it's a virus and deletes it."
,wroth91,2011-02-01T02:09Z,"well, I'm listening to the trusted user and trying this, besides, there are too many free sharing haters trying to kill a good thing, you all should b ashamed, crawl back into your holes"
,krypking,2011-02-02T08:16Z,"ive been using trillian for years and ive always been able to find crack that are virus free until now. why all of a sudden is my ani-virus picking it up as such? and before people start asking if ive switched programs, im using avast and always have."
,Kansatica,2011-02-06T00:09Z,"Antivirus software ALWAYS claims that cracks are viruses (virii?) because they modify code and do things that could be considered 'malicious'. Cracks act like viruses, but are used for a positive end."
,Shadow Master,2011-02-06T04:44Z,"Anyone have this mysteriously uninstalling itself? I've been running this basically since it was posted, but now the past two days when I've gone to eat dinner, I've come back to see Trillian has vanished. And when I click on the desktop icon, it says that the program is gone, so I have to reinstall it."
,krypking,2011-02-06T15:31Z,your antivirus deletes it because its a VIRUS
,Shadow Master,2011-02-06T18:59Z,"Yeah, I think it was my anti-virus. I guess the latest definitions from the 3rd or 4th started to pick it up. It's obviously not a virus though. Like I said, I've had this installed since December. If it is a virus, it's a really poor one, because I have never noticed it doing anything suspicious. Also, you would think someone from here would have come up with proof that it is a virus and it would have been taken down. Now I have to set this thing to ignore it."
,f1dz,2011-02-07T04:17Z,"Detected as virus with ESET NOD32.
Just add this file into exception list.

Work Great...!!! Thx to uploader"
,deeziie,2011-02-17T08:43Z,"For some reason, after I copy over the cracked .exe and open it, I get a brief command prompt screen and then nothing."
