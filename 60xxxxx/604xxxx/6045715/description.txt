(Goddard's 9th novel)

The presumably childless Harry Barnett, living a quiet, aimless life in Britain, receives an anonymous call informing him that his unknown son, a brilliant mathematician, is comatose. Worse, the son's condition is probably not accidental. His notebooks are missing; people around him are dying under mysterious circumstances. Harry, introduced in Goddard's Into the Bluefinds a new sense of purpose with the discovery that he is a father, and he begins to investigate what happened and why. The answer lies under layers of deceit, greed, fear, madness, and genius and leads Harry into unexpected byways.
