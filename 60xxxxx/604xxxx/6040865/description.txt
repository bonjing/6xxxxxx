ENGLISH HARDCODED SUBTITLES

The latest from FranÃ§ois Ozon is a typically lean and poised study of impending, untimely death that is as ghostly and unpredictably sketched as the coming of the Grim Reaper himself. Romain (Melvil Poupard) is a 31-year-old gay fashion photographer and not the most likeable man in all Paris; he snaps at his assistants, mistreats his family, snorts copious amounts of coke and is generally quite far up himself. Too bad, then, the more cold-hearted viewer might snort, when he collapses at a fashion shoot and is diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer thatâ€™s barely worth treating and given just a few months to liveâ€¦

How to deal with this news? How (indeed if) to tell family and friends? How to consider oneâ€™s suddenly shortened life? Such questions are at the heart of Ozonâ€™s film, but his treatment of them is elliptical, essential and defiantly in the first-person rather than fully realist or weepingly theatrical in the way that a less contemplative, more tear-jerking effort might attempt. Sure, Romainâ€™s attitude to his family softens (thereâ€™s a quite special interlude when he spends a night with his grandmother, tenderly played by Jeanne Moreau and the only relation who knows of his illness), but our perspective of Romainâ€™s death, like his life, remains resolutely selfish. There are some awkward notes. Itâ€™s difficult to swallow Romainâ€™s late act of charity and sexual exploration: he agrees to impregnate a complete stranger (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi). And nostalgic visions of Romain as a child only just teeter on the right side of cloying. But Ozon succeeds best in presenting deathâ€™s approach as a sort of half-removed, ghostly existence â€“ a point most movingly made by a beautifully conceived and choreographed final scene.
