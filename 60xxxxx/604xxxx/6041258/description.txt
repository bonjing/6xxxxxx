Springer | 2010 | ISBN: 1441967141 | PDF | 240 pages

This book covers the practical application of dependable electronic systems in real industry, such as space, train control and automotive control systems, and network servers/routers. The impact from intermittent errors caused by environmental radiation (neutrons and alpha particles) and EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference) are introduced together with their most advanced countermeasures. Power Integration is included as one of the most important bases of dependability in electronic systems. Fundamental technical background is provided, along with practical design examples. Readers will obtain an overall picture of dependability from failure causes to countermeasures for their relevant systems or products, and therefore, will be able to select the best choice for maximum dependability.
