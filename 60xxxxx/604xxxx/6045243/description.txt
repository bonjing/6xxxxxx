IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:From a very good friend ...... AND 46 seconds of the LKRG video ...Thanks mates :)
AUDIO:LiNE from LU Synced by us ......Thanks mate :)

This is the same video as our cam video with line audio added. First off we took 46 seconds from the LKRG video release to add to the video on this release to make it a full release. The video is much better than the previous source, but still some what cropped. Not bad but none the less thought we would tell you. We've done our normal filtering changing the brightness, contrast, colour, resize etc... TUrned out to be a very watchable cam OMI... Now for the audio we we're given line by lu, but it was missing 7:28 minutes from the beginning. So we used cam audio for that portion to make it a complete release. Then it was just a matter of syncing and filtering it. We remastered the audio as it lacked bassand had a few other issues, so we livened it up some for you folks.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
