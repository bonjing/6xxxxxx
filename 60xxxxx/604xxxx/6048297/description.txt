    It's the grand final of the contest to find Britain's      
    best family of cooks, with three families battling for    
    the title. Special guest, actor Neil Morrissey, plates   
    up his Moroccan mangler; and the seven-minute supper,     
    which viewers can cook along to at home, is ricotta        
    ravioli with a soft egg yolk.
