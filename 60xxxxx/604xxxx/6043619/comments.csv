,tribal_art,2010-12-22T02:08Z,p.s. I'm not sure if there tracking it or not. I live in Canada so it makes no difference to me.

,karebear666,2010-12-24T02:03Z,lol. they can't prosecute in canada for downloading. only for uploading. so we can download pretty anything-we just can't upload anything we don't have publishing rights for.

If it wasn't for Angelina's and Liev Schreiber's contributions no sane human would want to go see this film. It is basically a annoying cheap remake of the old USA - Russia bullsh*t that lost its credibility even in the late 80's. So why bother now??

Thanks for the upload for letting me find out myself. And hell, I am seeding this crap anyway."
,vivatpb5776,2010-12-26T04:12Z,"Okay first, stop bitching about tracking. If you are outside the US, then I am sure your government can give two shits about what you do. However, those in the US, just use encryption settings within .torrent clients like Vuze or uTorrent. I have been doing this for years and have never had one letter.

As to the movie, the quality was spot on with other DVDRips. At first, it appeared like the quality was sub-par but  that changed very quickly. That being said, the audio was slightly out of sync the last 10-15 minutes. Not enough to ruin the movie but definitely enough to justify finding a better version. Additionally, there are no encoded subs.

Overall:

Audio: 7/10
Video: 8.5/10
Movie: 8/10

Thank you uploader "
,murrambingi,2010-12-27T08:42Z,"lol, you guys are funny worrying about the authorities, the worst they can do is send letters to try and get you to be dumb and fill out your information and send it back to them, if you give them your information you are fucking stupid, i was browsing when i came across this torrent and i have actually downlaoded a better copy, its a BRRip Directors cut but it is 9GB, i wont tell you where but you can browse TPB for it.

@capo_soprano2,
Fuck off you spamming faggot, no-one cares about your anti-piracy bullshit, as humans we are entitled to share with each other whatever the fuck we feel like and there is not a god damned thing you can do about it by law and you know it, that is why you have to spam torrents with the shit that you type trying to scare people off, go and get a life, better yet get a lawyer to try and make the law stick to your words that come out of your mouth, and then we will see how long the greed of your lawyers clients lasts when they run out of money, one word to describe you = GREEDY SCUMBAG."
,pepperstrong_2222,2010-12-28T23:51Z,"thanks for you post murrambingi i really like what u wrote in your msg especially your msg to @capo_soprano2, ppl like him should be sent of to caves or some stupis ass place like that with no contact with human beings...."
,puppyup,2010-12-29T19:52Z,"Is this the same as the Director's Cut? IMDb does not list anything like ""extended"" or ""director's"" cut."
,puppyup,2010-12-29T20:05Z,"There are three versions of Salt:

1. Theatrical release
2. Extended Cut
3. Director's Cut

Both, 2 and 3 are unrated (they show the gore and blood). Version 2 has a different storyline and different ending. Version 3 follows the same storyline as theatrical release, but has a completely different ending which is also very different from version 2."
,nexus35,2011-01-01T05:36Z,"The video and audio quality are really good, however this file is being tracked. I also recieved a notice. (California United States) (Charter Internet)"
,capo_soprano2,2011-01-01T12:28Z,"@ murrambingi WOW! Ur a nut bag! I was simplysharing my experience for other pirates to be informed! If I was so against free sharing why would I be downloading files? Idiot, Thats called a retorical question dumbass! Unlike you I like to contribute to the piratebay and other users! So go suck off your dad off again cuz obviously thats what your using for brains these days! :) "

,capo_soprano2,2011-01-16T17:17Z,"Well, why not post a link for the rest of us that do not know of a good proxy/blocker program? I have peerblock and it seems to work but i am tired of geting warnings from my service provider here in canada. and tot hose that look down on us for not knowing as much as you when it comes to this stuff, P2P is not for you cuz true pirates share and help each others. so piss off to you!

Hello raymondhome. I am fairly new to TPB & Torrents in general. I would like to tell you how much I appreciate your work, & EVERYONE ELSE that helps with your uploads! I NEVER have to read the comments for the quality of the video or audio, unless you have in parentheses, (READ NOTES). Once again thanks my friend for the uploads, thanks for sharing & all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan
PS. If I can send a donation, just let me know how to do so :o)

,capo_soprano2,2011-01-22T23:35Z,@omglolol  suck NUTS! Its ppl like you that clog up P2P! Try makikn it easier for folks in stead of being an asshole. You prolly cut ppl off on the road too. U Dickhead will prolly get someone killed one day!  
,ecleans,2011-01-23T07:22Z,"capo_soprano2... You are a moron.
And if you are Canadian learn how to string a proper English sentance so that you may be understood instead of just being retarded. I am Canadian and I've been using this shit for as long as I can remember, with NO letters and no bullshit. Canadian service providers keep our personal information confidential and the so called internet police in Canada whome you speak of are not privy to such information, if they exist at all. Quit being an idiot and quit trying to make people paranoid about shit. And learn to speak a language properly! Any language you wish! just fucking DO IT RIGHT! for the love of god! just reading your shit makes me want to spit on my screen! I smell a rat anyway. Stop spamming bullshit and fucking with human beings that don't want/need your bullshit."
,capo_soprano2,2011-01-24T22:53Z,"@ecleans How mature attack my sentence structure. This is a comment page noit afucking essay review. GEt a life! All you idiots that like to comment on this shit to feel superior is sad. I never mentioned anything about intermet poice. I mentioned my experience so that others would start using a blocker program. as for being a rat, it's people like you who are worse then a rat becuz you do nothing to help other users. So eat shit, eh, ya Canadian gonad! "

Just when you thought they couldnt make the thing any cheesier they take out the few redeeming scenes and plot turns to make it as vanilla holywood as possible. 


Great torrent thoe, top notch quality, top notch speed. Cheers."
,listenherenow,2011-04-03T09:08Z," It's Highly unlikley excision - but not impossible - happened to me before so I knowe for a fact. 

  ISP wrote me up - said If they catch it again i have to come in , in person, and write a written statment saying I won't do it again, then if they catch it again they will cancel my service. 

  not kidding.   anyway - hide your shit if your worried, or blow it off if you think it's all good.  I don'tthink they will cancel me since I pay the freaking 150.00 every damned month.

,Fireholder,2011-04-24T01:27Z,"Yes, here in Canada it is illegal to upload, not download (for now). The issue is that with TORRENTING, you're doing BOTH. You're uploading what you already have while downloading what you still need. Does that make sense to you? I hope so, because it's quite straight-forward...
If you're worried, find a couple of safe trackers and stick with them. Better yet, join a secure private tracker."
