,tmprather,2010-12-17T22:15Z,TERRIBLE COPY! If you really want to see the movie- wait for the dvd rips to come...A 6/V 4

I am a fan of your work but i must admit even for a cam this is poor quality, dark spots and flickering the whole time, bright spots too.

V = 4
A = 5"
,murrambingi,2010-12-18T05:34Z,"Sorry for the double post, but I burned the movie to a disk and watched on my dvd player and its actually not that bad, very smooth picture it does flicker a tiny little bit but very watchable, Im impressed in the difference between the pc and the dvd player, thanks again, I am eager for the DvdRip though :)"
,watbol,2010-12-29T05:54Z,"V-5 A-6 Very watchable.
Very Good, Nice 16:9-WideScreen movie.
