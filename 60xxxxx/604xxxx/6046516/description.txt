What They Said

"Some premium-grade dub spliced with insidiously catchy, offbeat pop tunes is just what the doctor ordered." - Ministry
"This is a musically-credible dub album which will perhaps find most of its audience at the adventurous end of the pop market." - Music Week
"The album is rife with excellent brass arrangements that pay homage to The Specials and 2-Tone." - NME
"A superb companion piece to the original." - Q
"Pleasant enough stuff, for sure, especially when the Space Monkeyz really get to work on the Augustus Pablo-like cuts, adding even softer edge to their already blissed-out haze." - Seven
"A novel experiment." - Uncut
