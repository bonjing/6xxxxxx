[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T08:09Z,"@dark_defender Nope. I've done TS, R5 and DVDrip of Machete."
,azrielle,2010-12-17T08:20Z,"RE: Machete.  He already did as part of one of his movie packs.
RE: Purple Hearts TASTE sources.  The size isn't as offputting as the available sources that Google brings up.  Afraid TPB/2040 has spoiled me in the trust department--if I can't find it on TPB, I generally won't dnld it.  May end up ordering a ""made to order"" DVD from Warner Bros for 14.99."
,muthineni,2010-12-17T09:40Z,"thanks.. 
i liked this movie when i saw it long time back.
+1"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T09:59Z,"@azrielle: In fact, it's good. Stupid me downloaded Taste - oh... what a piece of shit. Whole 1.37 GB is junk, with thousands of skipped frames and that makes video so 'jerky' to unwatchable level. It is most likely TV rip, and I have encoded 272p from that garbage (you cannot reconstruct something missing /skipped frames/ from the source.

I would, no matter what, put that in next 272p pack, shitty as is."
,skoliss,2011-01-30T00:26Z,"Thanks man!
Really good quality! :))"
,W_Irizarry,2011-02-06T17:01Z,I find it hard to believe that this is a 720p version at only 700MB.  The details doesn't specify the resolution.  Anyone know what the actual resolution is?
,torrtruk,2011-04-08T21:09Z,effing good! Thanks. :)
[T],WildcardSearxh,2012-02-13T04:23Z,This is a great movie. Thanks twentyforty :)
