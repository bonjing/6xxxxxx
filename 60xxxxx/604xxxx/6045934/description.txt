Pixar's unprecedented string of hit animated features was built on the short films in this collection. John Lasseter and Ed Catmull used these cartoons the way Walt Disney used the "Silly Symphonies" during the 1930s: as a training ground for artists and a way to explore the potential of a new medium. Although it's only 90 seconds long, "Luxo, Jr." (1986) ranks as the "Steamboat Willie" of computer animation: For the first time, audiences believed CG characters could think and feel. (It was also the first CG film to make audiences laugh.) When the artists began work on Toy Story, they had learned so much from the shorts, they were ready to undertake that landmark creation. In the later shorts, the viewer can see the artists continuing to experiment: with a more realistic human figure in "Geri's Game" and with new ways of suggesting atmospheric effects in "Boundin'." Some of the more recent shorts continue the adventures of the characters from the features. "Jack-Jack Attack" reveals what happened to the hapless baby-sitter while the Incredibles were off fighting Syndrome, while "Mater and the Ghost Light" shows that life goes on for the inhabitants of Radiator Springs. 
A delightful collection of entertaining shorts, and a significant chronicle of the growth of computer animation.

TECHNICAL DATA:

All the shorts are 1080p, using x264 video codec and AC3 for audio. About quality, I choosed to encode using level 18 constant quantizer, that is generally considered the best quality you can achieve with x264 codec. When avaliable there are also subtitles and foreign languages (French, German, Italian). Every short, except for "Jack-Jack Attack", has also an english-commentary audio track, that describes the difficulties faced for the accomplishment.
