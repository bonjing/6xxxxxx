,poutrel66,2010-12-15T03:46Z,"I love it when people write comments like that ...

Have you tried googling ""The.Social.Network.720p.BluRay.x264-METiS"" before posting ?

The simple fact that the Bluray isn't out yet doesn't mean that no one has accessed & uploaded it ..."
,sctehking,2010-12-15T04:14Z,"6 gigs is quite a bit for a 720P download, I'll just wait for a relatively smaller file around 2-3 gigs comes around. But great work getting this out. Without you those smaller files wouldn't be possible in the near future. "

Like always I use VLC to play this file and it should work perfectly but at around 23 seconds of playing the movie, it crashes. i tried jumping forward a bit but it crashes later on anyway. I updated the VLC program but it doesn't fix the problem. It can't be the file because other people have watched it and its not mentioned at all by any others. Does anyone have a diagnoses of the problem and know of a fix?"

,zardoz78,2011-01-26T11:52Z,"The ""cinavia"" DRM stuff really works.  Twice I converted to PS3 format, once with mencoder, again with latest mkv2vob, and both times the audio disappears after 20 minutes or so. This crap should never have been released.  Waste of bandwidth. "
,Junky099,2011-01-27T21:06Z,"Awesome quality. I'm amazed how METiS always manages to get bluray quality so quickly :)
Thank you"
,ausn9ive,2011-01-28T02:01Z,"Guys don't download this if you're planning to play it on a PS3, it has Cinavia DRM...

The audio file is embedded with a watermark that's recognisable by PS3's with firmware 3.10 or higher and a few other Blu-Ray players. Apparently the watermark can't be erased even if the audio track is converted and compressed. If you must play it on a PS3 then i recommend downloading the DVD rip. Check this site out for more info:

The movie works fine in VLC and other home theatre devices."

,Tbone321,2011-03-06T01:28Z,"@Jayzinho_10

it took me a little while to get a system down to watching blu ray torrents on my PS3. After I download them I use MKV2VOB to mux the video into a format the PS3 can play (I use either MPEG-2 or XviD, 1 or the other ALWAYS works). Also because the PS3 can't play a file bigger than 4GB, MKV2VOB lets you split it into 4GB parts. After you do all of that, its up to you on how you get it to your PS3, I used to use Media Share, but found too many problems with that, so now I use a WD 500GB hardrive. And thats a whole 'nother story because you have to put your hard drive into FAT32 format, which you can find a program online to do also. Hope that helps I know it was long, boring, and confusing."
,ultimagic,2011-03-07T19:23Z,"@10stinkyfingers
look at the video bitrate. and this is DTS audio.
not because h264 means low size."
,treeant23,2011-03-14T03:08Z,"I just made a rip of the Blu-ray myself with MakeMKV and Handbrake. And using Photoshop I was able confirm (scientifically, lulz) that there was nearly no visual difference (especially no difference to the eye) when I converted it at 1080p with the High profile preset with RF:20.5. With Blu-ray quality and the h.264 codec AND the two commentary tracks as well, my own file is only 2.19gb in size.

Thing is, it took my AMD 1090T Six-core CPU about 4 hours to convert...

Now, to be realistic, converting my copy of Avatar at 1080p with the same exact settings (in the same encoding queue, actually), gave me a 10gb file... Handbrake's quality slide is amazing."
,DEMTN,2011-06-10T04:14Z,"Alright, for those of you complaining about noise, i have a solution. If you are using VLC, go to audio, audio device, and set it to mono. problem solved."
,NoMoleste,2011-06-10T09:17Z,"PS3 will play files over 4gb. You can get any size file on the ps3 by networking to your computer with either tversity or ps3 media server...both free. This allows you to either stream the movie to the ps3 or you can copy the movie to your ps3...no matter how big it is. Still best to run it thru mkv2vob...also free...before copying it to the ps3. You just don't have to bother splitting it.

Doesnt matter for this movie though...it has cinavia protection."

CyanideX i believe the problem you are having is related to your speaker configuration, i output to a 5.1 system through a A/V reciever and i have no problems, but if i were listening with my computer speakers, id have the same issue as you, as the left and right channels are usually for the score and supporting vocals and center channel handles almost all of the main vocals.
