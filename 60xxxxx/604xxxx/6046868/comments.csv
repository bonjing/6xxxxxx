,trntz_man,2010-12-24T04:40Z,"Hey BOZX, how do you play the Alternative Cut, I was playing the file through VLC and I don't see a way you can play the Alternative Cut, all I see is the Theatrical Cut (on the bottom right it says 2:41:16 total time. When I right click on the video, when playing it in VLC, I went to the Video menu and went to Video Track and I only saw 1 track in there. So how do you get to the Alternative Cut?
Thanks again for the upload!"
