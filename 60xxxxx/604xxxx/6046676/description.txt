Set in the 1800's, a tiny flea narrates the sex escapades it sees from afar whom is Belle, a 14-year-old girl who lives with her controlling uncle. Father Ambrose is a young unscrupulous priest from her local parish whom decides to take advantage of Belle's naiveness to seduce her and teams up with Belle's uncle to exploit Belle's newly aroused sexuality. Meanwhile, Belle's best friend Julie has problems with her own life when her parents ignore her for their own sexual encounters, and she is pursued by the very endowned Father Clement, one of Father Ambrose's associates, who also wants to satisfy his carnal urges.
