Meet 100 Hispanics from around the world and throughout history who have lived amazing lives. This guide covers well known celebrities, such as actress Rita Moreno, activist Cesar Chavez, and musician Pablo Casals as well as more obscure individuals, such as Ellen Ochoa (inventor and first Hispanic female astronaut), Agustin Lara (a renowned Mexican composer), and Jose Capablanca (one of the greatest chess players of all times). Many of these individuals have made significant contributions to science, literature, politics, and other fields of human endeavour. Some more notorious, but equally fascinating characters are included as well. Brief biographical sketches are accompanied by bibliographies of resources, where readers can find more information. Grades 6-12.................
