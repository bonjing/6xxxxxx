On August 25, 2001, in the Hayti district of Durham, North Carolina, a historical marker was set up on the corner of Fayetteville and Simmons Streets, outside a branch of the Durham Public Library, where the American Tobacco Trail wends its way for those interested. The marker's heading, 'Bull City Blues', paid tribute to a group of long-dead musicians, led by Blind Boy Fuller and Blind Gary Davis, who more than 60 years previously would play for factory workers gathered around a barbecue stand set up across the street.
Back in the summer of 1939, J.B. Long drove Blind Boy Fuller, Sonny Terry and George (Oh Red) Washington to Memphis for a July 12 recording session. Fuller went first, cutting twelve titles, three solo, five with Terry's harmonica, five with Oh Red's washboard (only 'I Want Some Of Your Pie' had both Terry and Red present). Two, 'You've Got Something There' and 'Red's Got The Piccolo Blues', featured a second guitar probably played by Sonny Jones, who cut three titles of his own at the end of the session.
There was a recording trip to New York in the middle of June 1940 for the Fuller/ Terry/Washington trio. Although the latter didn't have a session to himself, four of the twelve masters allocated to Blind Boy Fuller were in fact released as by Brother George And His Sanctified Singers. ~ Amazon.com
