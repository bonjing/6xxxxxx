Tim Minchin with the 55-piece Heritage Orchestra live at the O2 arena, London on 14th December, 2010. This CD was sold immediately after the gig, and sounds fantastic.

Includes old favourites like 'You Grew on Me' as well as new songs like 'Thank You God', a must for fans of comedy and great music alike.
