,WhatAFxckingScene,2010-12-19T20:19Z,"Wait I'm confused,
How does the 'Magnet Link' work?
Nothing happens when I click it?"

I saw this one. --in the audience somewhere. Among thousands of bright fellas. Amazing show. Best comedian alive!"

,codemonkeyb,2011-03-03T05:50Z,"If you've got uTorrent installed, the magnet link will open the download without the need for downloading the torrent file, which, in this case, is unreachable because some twat used ""&"", rather than ""and"", and some twat at TPB can't be bothered to escape his entities correctly."
,Freak_no1,2011-03-06T09:28Z,"You're right; the magnet link works.

The quality is surprisingly good. 
Unfortunately I'll just have to quote Tim himself: ""Nothing ruins comedy like arenas""
..but the show is amazing nevertheless."
