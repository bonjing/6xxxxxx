[V],catflap,2010-12-20T03:04Z,"THIS IS A FAKE!

axxo hasn't released a thing for almost 2 years.

although this MIGHT be the real film, it
is DEFINITELY NOT An AXXO FILE.

do not download anything from this person
or you take the risk of getting screwed with
trojans, viruses, or passworded crap.

ANY NEW FILM WITH AXXO'S
TAG RELEASED AFTER MARCH 11, 2009
IS A FAKE.

yes, this is A FAKE in the sense that
although it might be the real movie, it
is definitely NOT AN AXXO RELEASE.

you would know that if you had actually looked
on axxo's REAL website home. axxo does not
have - AND NEVER HAS HAD - his/her/their own
website, but calls home on an RG's website.

you would also know that axxo has not released a thing
for almost 2 years. any new film released with
axxo's tag after March 11, 2009 IS A FAKE. "

,andykrist,2010-12-21T05:03Z,"@ catflap. Not sure if I trust the pinion of soeone who would seed pee wee's playhouse. Since I know my computer is very protected, I'll DL this and let you know if it's bad."
,FFCUK,2010-12-23T07:04Z,The file doesn't play; Avast says it's a virus.
,Sierek,2010-12-23T12:21Z,"Just finished downloading and it doesn't play. 680+MB tells me something else is on here since the video isn't, but anti-virus must have caught it before me. Can confirm this video is a fake, but am kinda confused since most all of SceneLine's stuff is usually good"
,Filthmonger,2010-12-24T16:03Z,"I have no idea what catflap's issue is.... This is NOT a fake works perfectly... if you can't see the video try VLC player, it plays everything "
,ghigh88,2011-01-01T19:30Z,"THIS IS A FAKE!!!! I have tried it in windows media player and VLC, it comes up as 5 seconds long with no video on both!!!!

It's weird because every other file I have dled from this uploader is legit w/ perfect quality, EVEN the ones that have the axxo tag, whether they were or weren't ripped by axxo. THIS FILE IS FAKE HOWEVER!!!!! Good files by the uploader include The A Team, How to Train Your Dragon, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Hot Tub Time Machine....

BUT THIS FILE IS BAD DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
,ibbunny,2011-02-04T06:06Z,"fake, and this isn't axxo, stealing his good name to piss people off, shame on you *angry face*"
