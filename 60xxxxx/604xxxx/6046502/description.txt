***********************************************************************
By tying thousands of balloon to his home, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen 
sets out to fulfill his lifelong dream to see the wilds of South America. 
Right after lifting off, however, he learns he isn't alone on his journey, 
since Russell, a wilderness explorer 70 years his junior, has 
inadvertently become a stowaway on the trip.
