I would first like to say thank you so much to you and (anonymous) for your posting of this years NFL games.  I know I speak for not only myself but hunderds of other users which I have seen uploading and seeding each week....  I noticed you have not posted week 15 as promptly as in weeks past.  I just wanted to say that I hope VERY MUCH that you continue to post the remainder of this years games.  I have been relying on your posts to watch seattle play.  I hope all is well with you and I wish you a happy holidays...

""Thanks"""
