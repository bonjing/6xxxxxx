From Tantor.com:

One of the acknowledged masterpieces of nineteenth-century realism, Madame 
Bovary is revered by writers and readers around the world, a mandatory stop on 
any pilgrimage through modern literature. Gustave Flaubert's legendary style, 
his intense care over the selection of words and the shaping of sentences, and 
his unmatched ability to convey a mental world through the careful selection of 
telling details shine throughout this marvelous work. 

Madame Bovary scandalized audiences when it was first published in 1857. And 
the story itself remains as fresh today as when it was first written, a work 
that remains unsurpassed in its unveiling of character and society. It tells 
the tragic story of the romantic but empty-headed Emma Rouault. When Emma marries 
Charles Bovary, she imagines she will pass into the life of luxury and passion 
that she reads about in sentimental novels and women's magazines. But Charles is 
an ordinary country doctor, and provincial life is very different from the 
romantic excitement for which she yearns. In her quest to realize her dreams she 
takes a lover, Rodolphe, and begins a devastating spiral into deceit and despair. 
And Flaubert captures every step of this catastrophe with sharp-eyed detail and 
a wonderfully subtle understanding of human emotions.


From Wiki:

Gustave Flaubert was a French writer who is counted among the greatest Western 
novelists. He is known especially for his first published novel, Madame Bovary 
(1856), and for his scrupulous devotion to his art and style.

Madame Bovary is Gustave Flaubert's first published novel and is 
considered his masterpiece. The story focuses on a doctor's wife, Emma Bovary, 
who has adulterous affairs and lives beyond her means in order to escape the 
banalities and emptiness of provincial life. Though the basic plot is rather 
simple, even archetypal, the novel's true art lies in its details and hidden 
patterns. Flaubert was notoriously a perfectionist about his writing and claimed 
always to be searching for le mot juste ("the right word").

The novel was attacked for obscenity by public prosecutors when it was first 
serialized in La Revue de Paris between October 1, 1856 and December 15, 1856, 
resulting in a trial in January 1857 that made the story notorious. After the 
acquittal on February 7, 1857, it became a bestseller when it was published as 
a book in April 1857, and now stands virtually unchallenged not only as a seminal 
work of Realism, but as one of the most influential novels ever written.

A 2007 poll of contemporary authors, published in a book entitled The Top Ten, 
cited Madame Bovary as one of the two greatest novels ever written, second only 
to Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.
