Evaluate and test new operating systems, applications and patches in an isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software applications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable manner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and the SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to debug applications on multiple platforms.

Run Your Most Demanding Applications on the Most Advanced Virtualization Platform
Create virtual machines with up to 8 virtual processors or 8 virtual cores, 2 TB virtual disks and up to 32 GB of memory per virtual machine to run the most demanding applications. Protect your virtual machines from prying eyes with 256-bit AES encryption and smart card authentication.

Award-winning
Backed by over a decade of proven engineering, VMware Workstation is trusted by millions of users worldwide. The company has won more than 200 awards for its industry-leading software, with over 50 awards for VMware Workstation.

More Reasons at a Glance

Seamlessly Integrated
Unity mode integrates applications from within your Windows & Linux virtual machines and makes them appear like they are running on your native desktop. User friendly features such as the ability to cut and paste pictures, drag and drop email attachments, and driver-less printing make it easy to work in a virtual machine.

Snapshots and Clones: The Ultimate Time Saver
Snapshots preserve the state of a virtual machine so you can return to it at any time. Snapshots are useful when you need to revert your virtual machine to a prior, stable system state. Workstation makes it easy to find and revert to a previously saved snapshot.

Installing operating systems and applications can be time consuming. With clones, you can make many copies of a virtual machine from the baseline installation and configuration. This makes it fast and simple to maintain standardized computing environments for employees and students, or to create a baseline configuration for testing.

Run Multi-tiered Applications on a Single PC
Manage multiple, network-connected virtual machines with Teams. Teams make it easy to start and run complex multi-tier enterprise applications on a single PC with just a click of the mouse.

Rewind and Replay Until You Find the Bug
Diagnose non-deterministic bugs with the Replay Debugging technology integrated into Visual Studio and Eclipse. Test your applications in a virtual machine while recording and then let the developer step through the recording with a debugger attached. Never again will there be a non-reproducible bug.
