,Bucks5510,2011-03-06T01:32Z,My ISP sent me a warning letter about this torrent
,wanda_5,2011-08-03T21:33Z,"1080p version of this torrent would be great.

Thanks a lot for this tho."
,The.Real.Zer0,2011-12-27T16:02Z,@bucks5510: Your ISP most certainly DID NOT send you a warning letter about this torrent.  If anything bad happened relating to this torrent then I'd say your mom probably found it on her computer and asked you if you'd been jerking on ole fred.  Wish you stupid fucks would quit spamming good torrents.  Thanks kelvin09 for the work you put in.  No pun intended!
