[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T18:19Z,"@kanha:  I'm booked till New Year, meaning I have dozens of  requests already placed.
Therefore I wrote ""REQUESTS ARE FROZEN"" but I promised to note (not fulfill) any placed in days to come.

Few hours ago you have placed your inquiry already FEW inches below my REQUESTS ARE FROZEN.

So - keep in mind - that with repeating the same request  over and over again you practically diminish any chance for considering it."

,Killjoy88,2010-12-17T19:56Z,"@twentyforty

regarding The Green Lantern, i would like it to be in 720p if thats ok. Your 720p encode of Toy Story 3 was just amazing!

Thank you once again!"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T20:34Z,"@DSIN: Keep seeding. Peers that cannot connect to probably can't or - doesn't need more. I am there, no one can  pull as much as I can give.

Regarding your requests - do not pull formats out of the hat. We haven't discuss it nor agreed about. You have said (I feel stupid for reminding you) that time doesn't matter and formats were never ""hard-coded"". Next day you said ""wold it be before Christmas"". ""Soon as is possible"" I answered.

So, ""soon as possible"" does not mean when you and me want something, and I do best I can.

Regarding eXistenZ, it's 480p and Happiness is 272p. So - take it or leave it.

Any further questioning (I have said and explained all) I would treat as hostile behavior."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T20:35Z,"ERR.

wold = would

typo, sorry."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T20:51Z,"@DSIN: I have your request on

>>twentyforty at 2010-12-11 20:40 CET: 

@DSIN: I would try, but it hardly can be before Xmas. Do Google if you cannot wait.""

Well, I got ""preferred"" maybe too ""wide"".

Sorry 'bout that."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T20:55Z,"@Killjoy88: Done both as 720p and 272p (for people who cannot afford 700MB as for 720p.
720p is uploading as I write. 

So, be here 10 hours from now."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-17T22:53Z,"@DSIN: Sorry, I forgot to explain (but I don't need to, right?) choice of encoded formats:

Cronenberg's eXistenZ never was released as BluRay. Ever. Out there exist mislabeled HDTV which is not suitable for upscaling and I feel stupid to encode European (smaller frame-size) as anything above 480p.

""Happiness"" DVDrip exist (without ""s"" for plural) and that one is - 528x288 and by that I cannot upscale to 352p. I don't do upscaling, it's irresponsible and give bad and ugly results.

So - I never do even smallest thing without thinking through, and you should admit that I do know few more about encoding than you."
,DSIN,2010-12-18T08:30Z,"@20-40 : that was a real LONG one .. LOL
yeah man .. my bad.. 
so eXistenz in 480p 
& happiness in 272p... agreed ;)
& thanx for explainin the formats... now i know existenz is not available in 720p..
& my apologies for asking time.. 
LOL @ hostile behaviour comment .. 
now thats out of the way... keep rockin.. :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-18T09:13Z,"@DSIN: Well, ""on paper"" eXistenZ is available as 720p BUT HDTV, not as normal BluRay. Out there was 1080p HDTV available, but couple of years back and today, as usual, some of available HDTV 720p transport streams has been remuxed in Matroska container and ""sold"" as BluRay - which never existed. 
I cannot afford myself to obtain three-four sources and then see and decide which one is true or suitable. Priority always get sources from trusted ""waterholes"".


Point being - and this is nothing personal, but could be applied on all requesters - I can give ONLY what I have or can be found. And for my own sake - best source first - because amount of work on some shitty source doesn't pays off. For nobody. And nobody have right to question that, nor my choices. All my uploads are my time, my energy and - comes from my pocket,
for free - and ""other"" side decides to pick the goods up or - not.

Look at the ""MINUS"". Some people are mad. And I am not ""glass is half full"" type of guy."
,DSIN,2010-12-18T09:39Z,"^ u r absolutely right...
