,zetty2009,2010-12-28T04:14Z,"This is such an amazing album ... Glad to see it well seeded..a well deserved comeback from R Kelly & it shows just how talented this guy is..

While most of the albums today are mostly trash, good to see a nice melodious album where almost all the tracks are worth listening to...And oh yeahh - this one has the MJ song ""you are not alone cover.

Thanks Jainmehul !!!..this was a top notch rip."
