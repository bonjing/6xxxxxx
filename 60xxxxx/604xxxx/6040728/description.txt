Seals and Crofts is a band made up of Jim Seals (born James Seals, October 17, 1941, Sidney, Texas) and Dash Crofts (born Darrell Crofts, August 14, 1940, Cisco, Texas). The soft rock duo was one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s. They are best-known for their hits "Summer Breeze" and "Diamond Girl". Seals' younger brother, Dan Seals was also well known as one half of another successful soft rock band in the same time period, England Dan & John Ford Coley, as well as for his success as a country artist in the mid-1980s. The duo disbanded in 1980, and both members went on to become public advocates of the BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith. They reunited briefly from 1991â€“1992 and again in 2004, when they released their final album, Traces.
