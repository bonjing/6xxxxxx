Bluegrass Crosspicking Guitar (with PDF tab)
Taught by Eric Thompson


Crosspicking is an exciting flatpicking technique that is an essential part of every 

bluegrass guitarist's arsenal. Utilizing repeated patterns on three-string groups, 

crosspicking captures the bounce of a fiddler's double shuffle and the drive of three-finger 

banjo Scruggs-style rolls. 

Eric Thompson lays it out for you in easy to understand steps, illustrating the basic 

patterns with arrangements of Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss, Blackberry Rag, Beaumont 

Rag, Wildwood Flower and Cross-Eyed Fiddler. Split-screen slose-ups let you see exactly what 

and how Eric is playing.
