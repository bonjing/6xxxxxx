,joepa007,2011-12-17T20:26Z,Please reseed! THANKS!
,joepa007,2011-12-25T05:54Z,"Will someone w/ 100% PLEASE SEED?! There are more than a half-dozen of us sitting here w/ 95.6%, playin' w/ 'it' for lack of anything better to do while waiting for the remaining 4.4% of the file. C'mon, please reseed this! THANKS!"
,somebodyelse222,2012-01-19T01:28Z,"This torrent seems to have always had problems with being incomplete. Last time I checked there were loads of folks stuck at 96.6%.
What I did was downloaded DivFixPlusPlus from afterdawn.com, and then used it to automatically repair the missing bits of the file. Sure, when you play it,  there are bits where it jumps, to compensate for the 'holes' but it means you get a playable copy, which is great 96% of the time! Hope that helps, otherwise I guess you/I would have been waiting forever. If it works for you, pls say so, for the benefit of any later downloaders of this torrent. "
