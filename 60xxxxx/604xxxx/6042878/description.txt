Beirut is an iconic, horn-loving, harmonizing indie group fronted by Zach Condon. 

In 2007, Beirut teamed up with Vincent Moon of La Blogotheque to produce a series of videos (and eventually a short movie comprised of these videos) of the band walking around a city randomly playing music as they went. 

The DVD sold out years ago, but I contacted Beirut\'s label, BaDaBing Records and asked if they were making the files available now that the DVDs were sold out. 

They said \"no...but that\'s a great idea!\" So they sent me one of their last remaining masters with a mandate to make them as widely available as possible. 

This torrent contains the entire movie, as well as each individual song track, ripped via HandBrake into a) full 720p h264 m4v and b) h264 optimized for iPod/iPhone. 

Don\'t like how I ripped it? That\'s OK - I also included DMG and ISO masters of the DVD itself so you can do as you will with it. 

Please download and share. Upload the torrent to other trackers. Make it available. 

And if you feel so inclined, show some love to Beirut and BaDaBing. It\\\'s pretty cool that they were so excited about doing this.
