I don't know if you are a team or just a single person, but you upload great stuff and you do it well! 

You are my primary link for all BR rips.BONE.: the rising aXXo of Blu-Ray :)

Can i make a suggestion? Leave the R5s. You do bluray really really well. You can build your reputation on that alone if you want.

Thanks for the great upload man/guys

Cheers!"
