If I'm going to watch it again I want the quality to be better.

So tell me, is this the real deal?
Thanks for the upload in any case!"
,jammeke,2010-12-23T17:04Z,Welke kwaliteit is dit ?
,Filip666,2011-02-23T12:50Z,image appears stretched as if wrong aspect ratio has been chosen during conversion. what's the point of having good video quality then?
