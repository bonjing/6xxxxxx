For people looking for the original rock music track, this version doesn't have it!
I think this is even the CinEField video rip:/

Its either the bluray version does not have the original US Rock soundtrack or the people who ripped it used the Japanese track.

because this is stupid and retarded man!
I downloaded for nothing, I may have no choice but to buy the retail copy:/"
