Drawing from the same well as the late great Jack Owens, Bentoniaâ€™s Jimmy 'Duck' Holmes evokes the dry, hostly sounds of his mentor. But after conjuring Jackâ€™s spirit, Holmes develops his own personality -Â­- ethereal, stark and emotional. Iâ€™ve never been to Bentonia, but whateverâ€™s in the water there, whateverâ€™s haunting the grounds at night, whatever gave the place its historical power, clearly lives on in these recordings.
