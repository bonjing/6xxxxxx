     Plz. Upload Endhiran(Robot) HQ Voiceless BGM's By A.R.Rahman...,   

Thanks In Advance...,   "
,mnamna,2010-12-19T09:38Z,"Thanks for the the movie, really SaM. The rip is good quality, but the movie kinda sucked. It doesn't take a psychic to know the ""whodunnit"" part at the beginning of the movie."
,lynx_ca,2010-12-19T13:33Z,"whininguser i care if its good, there are to many movies released in a day to watch every single one. 
unless you literally have nothing to do with yourself if your not watching a movie or 'watching paint dry' 
if this is the case i recommend you get netflix or browse imdb for a while and find some interesting titles to download off of TPB. 

the rip is great, but this movie isnt worth your bandwidth.  "
,Kllr79,2010-12-19T16:17Z,The Rip is very good but the movie Sucks Badly!!!

,mallek,2010-12-20T08:07Z,The worst rip-off I've ever seen of the movie Psycho. 
,smudger6,2010-12-20T11:44Z,"Movie is shit, thanks for the D/L anyway Sam keep up the good work A10/V10"

,shinobiXRT,2010-12-22T16:38Z,"what happened to Sweden? Ever since they sided with yankland, they just turned shit"
,Sparkess,2010-12-25T00:05Z,mkv is better than avi you fucking dumb cunt.
,dengforgb,2010-12-29T17:23Z,"There are plenty of good Company Men torrents, i downloaded it last month with no problem, and .mkv isnt a shit format container... i prefer it to .avi as you can store the film, multiple audio streams and subtitles in a single file and the error resilience is better too. Thanks for the upload anyway."
,JohnnyRayRay,2010-12-30T06:15Z,"This movie is one of the worst movie ever made. If I went out on the street now and threw a rock I would hit someone who could make a better movie in his sleep. But to think that someone with a passion for film made this! 

To think about such a stupid waste of life makes me about as mad as when i hear about rape and childmolestors."
,Dakenz,2010-12-31T06:01Z,"wow, you really think a lot hmm? "
,Aeri,2011-01-03T04:54Z,"davenez at 2010-12-18 01:05 CET:
thanks dude already have this but in mkv(shit)format


MKV is superior to AVI by far. The latter is more often supported by DVD and BluRay USB/Thumb drives which is why it is still so thoroughly in circulation. Each format has it's benefits, I prefer MKV and watch it flawlessly with FLV.
Cheers;"
,whizzzy,2011-01-04T14:34Z,"just read the plot. save yourself the download, utter shitte."
,pandra2,2011-01-07T08:47Z,This movie is so bad that it's funny!
,ust2,2011-01-14T11:33Z," I'm a fan of cheesey horror flicks, but this was actually one I could not even watch just to laugh at.

 Do not download even as a last resort lol."
