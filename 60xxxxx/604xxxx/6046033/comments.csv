I can recommend no better teacher for  beginning or advanced artist, or even professional than Andrew Loomis -- his skill as an artist and illustrator was unmatched and the lucidity of his explanations is a joy.  You will be hard pressed to find a better teacher of figure art or the basic concepts of perspective and foreshortening, for example.  Again -- thank you very much for these; I will seed for as long as possible."
