Amazon Review:
Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas is genre melding of the best sort: incredible guitar playing in the Hawaiian tradition dominates the disc, but the material is mostly familiar holiday carols. The result is a truly original and refreshingly low-key take on Christmas music. Keola Beamer's version of "Away in a Manger" is filled with jazzy bass touches; Led Kaapana and Bob Brozman's "Jingle Bells" is a hard-driving and virtuosic showpiece, with Brozman seemingly working the entire fretboard; and Bla Pahanui's arrangement of "O Come All Ye Faithful" is gorgeous and creative. Ozzie Kotani's "First Noel" is understated but a touch too sentimental and the three vocal tracks--by Dennis Kamakahi, Leonard Kwan, and Joanie & Ruth Komatsu--seem out of place amid all these lush guitar textures. That said, this is still a great album and a wonderful alternative for guitar lovers who've worn out their copies of John Fahey's legendary Christmas album.

Allmusic Review:
A guitar style featuring open tunings and the frequent use of harmonics, hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, and dampings, Hawaiian slack key adapts very nicely to traditional holiday favorites like â€œJingle Bells," â€œSilver Bells,â€ and â€œWinter Wonderland,â€ as this bright, comfortable collection shows. Mostly instrumental, and spotlighting some of the best contemporary slack key players like Ozzie Kotani, Led Kaapana, George Kuo, Cyril Pahinui, and Cindy Combs, among others, Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas also features three vocal selections by Dennis Kamakahi, Leonard Kwan, and Joanie & Ruth Komatsu, respectively. Itâ€™s a nice mix, with a wonderful and refreshing flow.
