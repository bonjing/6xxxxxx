     Notes:

         If The Mars Volta was influenced by Sublime & NOFX they'd  
         end up with the sound of 'Rest for the Wicked' the new long      
         player from Los Capitanes. Out of the shackles of 'a ska        
         band from Canberra' this 2nd release pushes all the       
         boundaries of mashing genres, file under 'punk', but could      
         fit in 'roots reggae' , 'prog rock', 'dub-hip-hop' or just       
         'original'! This is the band dubbed as the 'Punk Cat Empire' !
