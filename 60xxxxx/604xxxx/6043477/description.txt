This true-story thriller is based on the experiences of 18-year-old college student Jason Moss and his relationship with notorious serial killer John Wayne Gacy. As part of a school assignment, Moss sends a letter to Gacy in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable kid. Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through a series of tests before surrendering his trust to him. What follows is a twisted psychological game of cat and mouse between two master manipulators, in which Jason's life is turned upside down and Gacy discovers new dimensions within himself. When Gacy invites Jason to visit him in prison for a private meeting, Jason accepts. Nobody could have predicted what would unfold inside the maximum security cell.
