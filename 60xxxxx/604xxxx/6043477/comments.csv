,iamcims,2010-12-19T04:12Z,"shit rip, don't get this.

for one it is wmv.
second, it has usage rights software in it that blocks it. if it is even real to begin with.

it will not play in VLC.

please remove this torrent. thanks"
,iamcims,2010-12-19T04:17Z,"okay after i looked at it for a minute. this is spyware.

the video file is fake and what it does is somewhat clever but not really.

they want you to use wmp because it will load a media rights page to view the file, but its a xvid codec site? but its a fake xvid site, its malware,

ha, nice try, but i knew right away what that was.

I went ahead and installed the xvid codec from their actual website, and gave it a shot in wmv, and the same fake site loaded linking me to a malicious file disguised as an xvid codec exe install.


I am reporting this and you should too."
