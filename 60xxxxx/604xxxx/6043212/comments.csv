,blombardo,2011-01-08T23:07Z,This is a Godsend for OUTLOOK users (such a pain to specifically back up ALL the different portions of it from all the difficult to find locations) This requires a basic configuration thats a one time setup - http://www.backup4all.com/kb/backup-outlook-emails-and-settings-125.html#01

Registration fails when serial is entered."
,Focuscar,2011-02-02T17:56Z,"sry it actually works (Not on my pc yet).
