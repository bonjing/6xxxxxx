PLOT:


Gina and Seth became pen pals 13 years ago in a class assignment. Gina lives in Boston now and finds out Seth will be in town for a toy conference she is going to cover for her paper. They both had sent pictures of their best friends, Ellen and Matt to each other instead. Now Gina and Seth force their best friends to meet as them. Unfortunately for them both, Ellen and Matt start to fall for each other. About half-way through, the real Seth figures out that the girl reporter he has been talking to is really Gina. In the end, Gina finds out the truth and they finally kiss.

What started as sixth-grade pen pal project turns into a topsy-turvy romantic mishap when Gina and Seth - now all grown up - finally decide to meet in person. They have a life-long friendship based on letters, but there's one little problem - the photos they exchanged were of their better-looking best friends. As a last-resort solution, they each send their best friends to meet instead, and a convoluted series of comical situations ensue, especially when the magic of Christmas inspires the two friends to fall in love. But soon the truth is revealed, and they learn a little lesson about self-confidence and being honest with those we love.
