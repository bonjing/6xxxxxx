Don't be a n00b.

An ""evaluation copy"" of Windows is just an unactivated install of a retail version. What you're probably thinking of, but too stupid to realize, is a an enterprise/corporate version of Windows that takes a Volume License Key and doesn't require activation.

Now go sit in the corner."

Any one, please?"
,TCwho,2011-03-18T04:45Z,Can anyone confirm is this has SP3 integrated?
,Mulder6,2011-03-18T12:22Z,"SP-3 is not in this one. The serials provided does not work, and it is a evaluation copy. You need to crack, after install."
