,ilsennodipoi,2011-04-20T19:01Z,"These files all have Russian as default language. This - I think - should transpire from the torrent title, but it doesn't. This torrent is fine for English speakers but you just have to make sure to choose the right audio track. Nevertheless, it's very important to know that it has Russian as main audio track because:
1. You might delete it before you discover that there are more than one audio tracks (I almost did this)
2. You might want to play it on devices that don't allow you to change audio tracks (cheap portable players)"
