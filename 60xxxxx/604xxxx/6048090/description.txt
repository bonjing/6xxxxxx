Book Description
While the major fighting of the war moves to the south in the summer of 1779, a 
British force of fewer than a thousand Scottish infantry, backed by three 
sloops-of-war, sails to the desolate and fog-bound coast of New England. 
Establishing a garrison and naval base at Penobscot Bay, in the eastern province 
of Massachusetts that would become Maine, the Scotsâ€”the only British troops 
between Canada and New Yorkâ€”harry rebel privateers and give shelter to American 
loyalists.

In response, Massachusetts sends a fleet of more than forty vessels and some one 
thousand infantrymen to â€œcaptivate, kill or destroyâ€ the foreign invaders. Second 
in command is Peleg Wadsworth, a veteran of the battles at Lexington and Long 
Island, once aide to General Washington, and a man who sees clearly what must be 
done to expel the invaders.

But ineptitude and irresolution lead to a mortifying defeatâ€”and have stunning 
repercussions for two men on opposite sides: an untested eighteen-year-old 
Scottish lieutenant named John Moore, who will begin an illustrious military 
career; and a Boston silversmith and patriot named Paul Revere, who will face 
court-martial for disobedience and cowardice.

Grounded firmly in history, inimitably told in Cornwell's thrilling narrative 
style, The Fort is the extraordinary novel of this fascinating clash between a 
superpower and a nation in the making.
