Markets! Finance! Bleeping Bankers!

Max Keiser and co-host, Stacy Herbert look at one Irishman in America speaking his mind about Irish bleeping bankers and while another Irishman, David Drumm, an Irish bleeping banker, is on the run and declaring bankruptcy in Massachusetts after bankrupting his own nation. 

In the second half of the show, Max Keiser talks to Ed Harrison about the European financial crisis.



The .mp3 is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.
 
 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
