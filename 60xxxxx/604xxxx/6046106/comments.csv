,philmania,2011-02-14T22:04Z,@Geraldin3: Disc 5 is perfectly OK!
,philmania,2011-02-14T22:08Z,"""99 tracks per CD, random breaks, idi0ts"" = I agree entirely - computers & literature: what an incompatibility xD!"
[V],FerraBit,2011-02-16T15:48Z,"Thanks for the feedback.
Yes, it should be complete - combined tracks by 
chapter.

Yeah, I have no idea what possesses the producers
at Brilliance Audio be release everything with 99 tracks
per CD, with random breaks etc. I can't imagine anyone 
thinking that's a good idea, so I can't imagine they've actually
listened to feedback from anyone who uses to their products

Thank you seeders.
Cheers,"
