Crap comment from a crap person, avoid!"
,Xyrec,2010-12-16T14:42Z,"@ircaddicts Crap guide? Crap game? Really, if you're just going to shit all over the comments, just don't fucking click this torrent.

@TPBrullz Turn off anything that has to do with skipping quests in the options, I did that, and it worked. :)"
,miniJ,2010-12-17T10:54Z,"is there a guide you have for the winter veil event, it has many of the events but not the Christmas one D;"

,TPBrullz,2010-12-21T18:10Z,"Hi again :D  Just wanted to report that i found some quests in Deepholm (4 or 5), Uldum (2-3) and 1 or 2 pre-quests for Twilight Highlands that send us (as alliance) to the wrong places.

The ones in deepholm send us to the horde side, in uldum they sended me to the middle of nowhere, not even near any npc.. and the other ones it was just the wrong place.

Obviously this is not your problem, i'm just reporting it so people will know."
,TPBrullz,2010-12-21T18:13Z,"p.s.- maybe you or who ever gets you this (i assume has an account) can report this, if you need details i can give them, i'll probably won't know the name of the quest but i remember the things i had to do."
,Fr3aKeN,2010-12-21T21:24Z,I report things like that to them even though i don't have a account. I just tell them I use a friends addon. 
,Fr3aKeN,2010-12-21T21:25Z,I also really wanna know if Xyrec... If your going to upload the winter veil guide? I really want it so i can do it for multiple characters.

,Fr3aKeN,2010-12-22T01:19Z,"Nah, i don't care what they have to say cause i know i enjoy it. If that ""person"" doesn't like it go play something else... DO NOT post how you hate it on a thread/comment about the game... shouldn't even be reading this torrent : /"

,dotsh,2010-12-26T13:01Z,"thx for the upload man, but is it just me or the talent advisor doesnt work beyond 80?"
,diablito469,2010-12-31T19:08Z,This guide is good if you dont have chest/shoulders heirlooms or your guild has the xp bonus.   im so ahead of the guide its not even funny it has me still doing gray quests. im level 22 and zygor has me at quest level 16. i checked their forums and i guess this is a problem that they cannot fix at the moment.
,TPBrullz,2011-01-01T18:39Z,"@diablito469

Configure Zygor to skip quests too low for you and it's fixed....

@Xyrec

Can you get us the latest version?
Thanks again for sharing."
