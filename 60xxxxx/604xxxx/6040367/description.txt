    Directed by Yoshihiro Nishimura

    Eihi Shiina     .... Monami's Mother                                     
                                                                             
    Transfer student Monami has a secret and a past that has caught up       
    with Mizushima. Deceiving Mizushima into eating a token gift of          
    chocolate, laced with her blood, he is then catapulted into Monami's     
    vampire world of blood, death and love. Jilted girlfriend Keiko has      
    other ideas. With a sudden twist of fate, she is then transformed        
    into the hideous and unforgiving Frankenstein Girl, and the battle       
    for Mizushima's heart begins.                                            
                                                                             
    Proper notes: Both Cowry and our source had hard telecine frames that    
    were then interlaced. Result = horrible blended fields on Cowry          
    release. We manually created our own frames, then manually decimated.    
    Compare the samples of both in sample dir.                               
    Nuker notes: I'm sure somewhere in these thousands of frames there       
    are one of two badly blended frames. This does not = bad.itvc or         
    whatever random nuke you want to use. This is an inexact science,        
    especially with shitty sources like this.
