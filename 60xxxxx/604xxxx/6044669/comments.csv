[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-17T21:09Z,"Nice to know they're appreciated, tazmuskie - thank you."
,nite82hawk,2010-12-17T23:37Z,"HD-R-US, all I got to say is THANK YOU!  I've always browse through tpb for things and I've never registered until now. I did it just to tell you thanks so much!  So far I got 8 movies.  Saved me a buttload of $$! 
 Question; are these exactly Bluray quality or not?  Just wondering.  "
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-18T02:03Z,"Hi, nite82hawk. Thanks for registering to show your appreciation.

To answer your question, they are blu-ray rips, using the same video file, encoded at a lower bitrate to save on filesize, and with AVCHD file/folder structure so that they can be burnt to cheap media if so required. Quality-wise, nothing will be full blu-ray quality unless it is the original blu-ray disk, which can mean filesizes of up 40Gb rather than 4Gb, but they are close, and some would take a keen eye to tell apart from the original, even on a large screen. Original blu-rays themselves can vary in quality considerably, so the results of a re-encode can only be as good as what it started off as, you know? The bottom line is, all of our releases are burn tested, and if the end result isn't close, then we won't release them, or we'll drop from 1080p down to 720p for a longer runtime movie. Hate to do that though. =)

All the best."

[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-20T19:44Z,"wad11656 - Yes, the disk image is compiled with all of the correct settings to burn it. The alternate settings only come into play if you have already extracted the files/folders for any reason.

gecina - Hvala. =)"
