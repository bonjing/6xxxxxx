Just a few examples: When the character played by Michael Douglas talks about his time in prison he says ""Sometimes it's the only place to stay sane"" which is translated as ""Det Ã¤r det enda stÃ¤lle att bo normal"". He continues: ""and look out those bars and say"" is translated as""Om du tittar igenom dessa barer"". Anyone with the remotest knowledge in English/Swedish and the context of the movie knows that he is talking about the bars in the prison cell, not a place were you have your drinks. Other than that, thank you for this upload."

Fine you still liked it."
