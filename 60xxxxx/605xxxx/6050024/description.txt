Video source Serenity Thanks ..Audio LU ..Want to give special thanks to LU at the minute hes the only one out providing audio.Line seems really rare but LU continues to provide much needed english audio to go with foreign videos..Ran a few filters through the video not alot but enough.Audiowise increased the volume ,amplified light volume and added abit of bass.Still not great audio but its better than none...Enjoy .
