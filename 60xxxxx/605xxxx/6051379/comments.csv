But it's better to skip the translation files than to include translations made by an illiterate or by Google Translate (I can't tell which). The Swedish translation consists of Swedish words that don't make any comprehensible sentenses.

Den svenska Ã¶versÃ¤ttningen Ã¤r obegriplig."

and ""Lilmjkl"" is a known translator so I had no reason not to believing  in that!

,bestbuymacman,2011-01-01T16:01Z,"To everyone that is saying ""Skipping"" or ""Laggy"", YOU NEED A FAST COMPUTER TO WATCH HD. sorry, but really. You cant have HD video on a Pentium 4 and a intel GMA. Atleast a core duo @ 1.9 GHz and a GMA x4500/ nvidia 8500gt. Laptops need a Nvidia 8300m or equiv. Everyone uses macs as bench marks, so a mid 2007 MB won't run it because it has a intel graphics , but a late 2008 with a Nvidia will. Any macbook PRO will....."

,MkVMe,2011-02-05T20:30Z,"My video is the same quality same resolution and same frame rate as this.  The only difference is it's only 500mb and should run fine on any computer.  Also in MKV H.264.  Enjoy.
