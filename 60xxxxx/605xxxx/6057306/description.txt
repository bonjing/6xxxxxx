This is the QuickBooks 2011 for Mac dmg file. This is NOT the demo software, this is the official software.

You are given 15 uses before they require registering it. 

In order to RESET your 15 uses so you never have to register, simply go ~/Library/Preferences/  and DELETE   com.intuit.QuickBooks2011.plist

It will reset it every time. You can safely update the software as well.
