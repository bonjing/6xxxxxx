,cityboyup,2010-12-28T07:27Z,Is there a way to make QuickBooks Pro 2011 for Mac to be permanently registered?

,kessragnell,2010-12-31T08:18Z,"You can't really permanently register it.  If I gave you my serial it would probably screw things up for me, so I might recommend you make an Apple Script, and everytime you want to ""renew"" your registration, just double click on your script and it will do it real fast.

I did this, and it opens up applescript, and in order to open quickbooks you have to Run the code each time. Is this correct?

Thanks"

,depicted_by_affliction,2011-02-10T12:02Z,"You can use a simple Apple script to remove the plist and run the program.

1) Rename QuickBooks 2011 in /Applications to ""QuickBooks""

2) Spotlight Apple Script editor.

3) In the main window Copy and Paste this, changing ""YOURHOMEFOLDERNAME"" to that of your home folder - Full POSIX route required for those users using File Vault.
SCRIPT BELOW:
--------------------------------------
try

do shell script ""rm Users/YOURHOMEFOLDERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.intuit.QuickBooks2011.plist""

end try

do shell script ""open -a QuickBooks""
--------------------------------------

4) Hit the Compile button at the top, save as application and as QuickBooks 2011 to your desktop or applications folder, drag a copy to your Dock and use the script to open. 

The Script automates the removal of the plist and launches the application.

You can also change the script icon to the QB logo by Command+i on the script and the same on the original QB app in /Applications. Click on the little icon at the top of the Info window and hit command+c, navigate to the script Info window and click on the little script icon and hit command+p. -Now your Apple script looks like the QuickBooks application."
,depicted_by_affliction,2011-02-10T12:14Z,"I hate trolls and wannabe clever assholes who don't even give people the right information.

A simple compiled Apple Script will make this easy for you guys. With this short guide you will be able to run this script as an app. The Script will remove the plist and then launch the QuickBooks app.

1)Install QuickBooks 2011

2) Rename QuickBooks 2011 in /Applications to ""QuickBooks""

3)In Spotlight search: Apple Script editor.

4) In the main window of the Apple Script Editor Copy and Paste the code below changing ""YOURHOMEFOLDERNAME"" to that of your home folder - Full POSIX route required for those users using File Vault.

SCRIPT CODE:

try

do shell script ""rm Users/YOURHOMEFOLDERNAME/Library/Preferences/com.intuit.QuickBooks2011.plist""

end try

do shell script ""open -a QuickBooks""


5) Then hit the Compile button at the top, save as an application and as ""QuickBooks 2011"" to your desktop or applications folder, drag a copy to your Dock and use the scripted app you just created to launch QuickBooks. Everything is taken care for you, and you don't have to open Apple Script Editor and run code every time, this app will do all that for you every time you launch it. 

You can also change the script icon to the QB logo by Command+i on the script and the same on the original QB app in /Applications. Click on the little icon at the top of the Info window and hit command+c, navigate to the script Info window and click on the little script icon and hit command+p.

Hope this helps someone."
,genuine_radar,2011-02-12T04:12Z,is there a 2011 for windows anywhere that gives full access (not just trial ver.)
,depicted_by_affliction,2011-02-14T00:33Z,"@genuine_radar, no because the software requires you register online. Use my apple script and just click ""remind me later"" I may get around to looking into how to remove the registration nag screen when I get the chance."
,nut4golf,2011-02-20T15:13Z,"Rather than deleting the property list (.plist) file each time which also loses any preferences you've set, last file used, etc here is what you can do:

Locate the com.intuit.QuickBooks2011.plist in the /users/youruserid/library/preferences folder using Finder.  Double click the file which should launch the Property List Editor.  Scroll down until you see the key ""IPD_LAUNCH_COUNT"". Change the value to a large negative number, like  -999. Save the file.  You now have over a thousand launches available before you need to go in and edit the plist file again... which you can easily do when it starts nagging you that you're within 15.  Oh yeah, doing this also seems to eliminate the registration nag screen!  "
,trishanne2,2011-02-24T21:58Z,"
I have found the IPD_LAUNCH_COUNT but I can't see where the value is to change to the large negative number. Can you point this out a little more clearly for me? Thank you so much. "

You need a property list editor (PlistEdit Pro is a great free one) in order to do this.. Very easy!!!"

ANYONE help me please!"
,Anterjot,2012-05-08T22:09Z,"Okay guys, I found a really simple solution. (Lion)

1) Make it show library by going to Terminal. Once you open in terminal and paste this:

chflags nohidden ~/Library

2) Now open up finder and go to Library
3) Click ""Get Info""
4) Scroll to the bottom of the window that opened up and you'll see a Lock symbol. Click that and type in your password.
4) Now under Sharing & Permissions, its going to say ""System-Read&Write Only""... Change that to ""Read Only""
5) Click the lock symbol again to make sure no one can change these options again
6) Your all set :)"
