Innervisions is an album by American musician Stevie Wonder, released August 3, 1973 on Motown Records. A landmark recording, it was the third of five consecutive albums widely hailed as his "classic period", along with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness' First Finale, and Songs in the Key of Life. The nine tracks that comprise Innervisions encompass a wide range of themes and issues: from drug abuse in "Too High," social anger in "Living for the City," to love; in the ballads "All in Love is Fair" and "Golden Lady."
