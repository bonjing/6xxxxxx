Baraka - Soundtrack (Michael Stearns) (1993) [FLAC]


"Baraka," the new film from the cinema team behind the phenominally successful art movies "Powaqqatsi" and "Koyaanisqatsi," excites the eye, ear and imagination with its visionary scope. Its sweeping soundtrack is one of the most important elements of this non-verbal film. It brings us ethnic music from Inkuyo and Angama, powerful religious chanting and drumming from The Dip Tse Chok Ling monks, ethereal, ambient music from bands such as Dead Can Dance, and Michael Stearns' original composition to form a score of world music as dynamic and varied as the exotic locales in which it was shot.
