,Kniffy,2011-01-02T16:46Z,"It's verry odd: the image has A WHOLE LOT of breakups, Codec seems unstable - yet no one else writes it in.  It happens on both Spiderman and Spiderman 2 (both by 3Li).

Before you blame MY hardware:  I have alot of Hi-res files: mkv, iso, and H264 MP4 files, ALL of them play just fine on my new WD Live hub media player and through the media player on my Blu-Ray... All the firmwares are up to date, yet both these files display evident breakups on both players.

Please help the coder by adding your comments, I dont think I can have the same problem on two files by the same coder by complete chance, and I cant be the only one with these issues..."
,Kniffy,2011-01-02T17:28Z,"Had a thought: tried to re-download to force a file check...  Despite having been told that the files where 100% there, turns out that one had only 42% completed and 50% for the other - Weird...

Will post to confirm all is ok after there are finnished, again..."
,Kniffy,2011-01-05T04:26Z,"Ok, the file is fine and of the appropriate quality for a file of that size.

For some reason micro torrent flipped out and told me the file was complete...  Unless those 'counter measures' people have managed to populate files with bad data - like when there are few seeders at night...  It wouldnt surprise me.  Anyone else had similar issues?"

,Lhoup,2011-05-16T12:36Z,I can't read it; VLC says something with undf codec... 
,Dragonite_9,2011-06-07T22:37Z,"@Lhoup

You mean the movie or subtitle?

If movie, download latest VLC version and reinstall, works for me, no problem so should for you too!

If subtitle, open it and re-save the file (save as) same name same plce, just change to unicode format instead, and if your computer can not show åäö and these kind of symbols, do that, and almost all subtitles with that problem will now properly show the text as it should!

Enjoy!"
