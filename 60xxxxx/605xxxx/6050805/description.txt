DO NOT HIT AND RUN

I've got the Wynton album, A Crescent City Christmas Card, which would be perfect to upload at this time of year, however unfortunately it's quite scratched on the last song. I've tried everything I can to get a perfect rip of it.

If people would like it, I can up it sans the last song (which is a VERY strange arrangement of Twas The Night Before Christmas - so you're not missing much IMO).

Just let me know in a thanks message to this torrent and I can get it upped very soon.

Enjoy
