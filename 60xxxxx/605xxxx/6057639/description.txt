PLOT:


A college student experiences difficulty in getting home for Christmas after being hazed by his friends. While struggling to get home in time for Christmas, he learns quite a bit about himself and the true meaning of the holiday.

In the spirit of the season, Disney presents the hilarious comedy adventure that celebrates the believer in all of us.

Jake Wilkinson (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), a wheeling, dealing, self-centered college student, has one thing on his mind -- get home for Christmas dinner or forfeit the vintage Porsche his father promised him. Just days before his deadline, Jake awakens in the California desert --stranded and penniless, wearing a Santa suit and a white beard glued to his face! Desperate to claim his gift, he flies, crawls, cons, races, bullies and ever sleighs his way east. But his nonstop mission turns into a nonstop comedy of errors as a multitude of colorful and offbeat strangers look to 'Santa' for help and kindness. The closer Jake gets to home, the closer he gets to the true meaning of Christmas and the importance of family.
