PLOT:


Based on an attraction at Disneyland, the Country Bear Jamboree, "The Country Bears" (2002) is one in a long line of live action Disney family films. The movie is a satire of Behind the Music rock & roll bands. Beary, a young bear raised by a human family in a world where humans and talking bears coexist, attempts to trace his roots. He meets up with the Country Bears, a long-since broken-up band, a parody of bands like the Eagles. Beary helps the Country Bears reunite for one final concert, while searching for who he truly is.

Disney's legendary group comes alive as the country bears star in their first feature film. Chronicling one of the most heartwarming family adventures ever, The Country Bears is packed with hilarious comedy, fantastic fun and foot-stomping music for the whole family. Beary Barrington, The Country Bears' young # 1 fan, fitting in with his all-too-human family is proving im-paws-ible. When he runs away to find Country Bear Hall and his heroes, he discovers the venue that made them famous is near foreclosure. Beary hightails it over the river and through the woods to get the Bears in the Band back together for an all-out reunion concert to save Country Bear Hall. And on the way to find his place in this world, Beary learns that true families are made up of those people who love you the most!
