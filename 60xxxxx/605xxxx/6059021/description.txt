This, the seventh Discworld novel, is one of the stand-alone books in the series. The story takes us to the very ancient desert kingdom of Djelibeybi (Child of the Djel), where tradition rules with an iron fist, and where every pharaoh gets his own pyramid when he dies (because itâ€™s traditional).

Teppic, the hero of the story and the son of the current pharao, has been sent to the Assassinsâ€™ Guild in Ankh-Morpork to widen his views a little, and this is where we meet him at the beginning of the story, when heâ€™s about to pass his final exams. Failure is lethal among the assassins of Ankh-Morpork, and it makes no difference that Teppic is the son of a ruler.

Afterwards, word soon reaches Teppic that his father has died, which makes Teppic the new pharaoh (and also a god). So he has to return to his old homeland to take up his new duites. There he soon discovers that the true ruler, by weight of tradition, is the old High Priest Dios. It matters little what Teppic says or decrees, since Dios â€œinterpretsâ€ the words of the pharaoh to concur with the dictates of tradition. Then the beautiful and extremely sexy handmaiden Ptraci is about to be sentenced to death...

Many adventures ensue, involving pyramid power, the preeminent mathematician on the Disc, the neighbouring kingdoms of Tsort and Ephebe, some philosophers in Ephebe, the resurrection of all the mummies in all the pyramids, the appearance of all the various gods of Djelibeybi, and much else, until Teppic finally saves the day and brings the kingdom, kicking and screaming, into the Century of the Fruitbat (which means, among other things, plumbing). And there is a nice twist at the very end. Pyramids is fun, interesting, and of the usual high standards of Pratchett. Recommended.
