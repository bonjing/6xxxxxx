,pgeso,2010-12-22T08:34Z,Anyone else getting super slow speeds on this or just me? I've tried everything and am only averaging 13kB/s ugh
[T],karpo1,2010-12-22T13:39Z,I think it's slow because torrent is too popular
,braveedge,2010-12-22T17:30Z,"karpo1, the more popular a torrent it, the FASTER it should be, not slower.  More people to send you pieces.

pgeso, check your settings"
,callten,2010-12-24T11:44Z,At the start that won't be the case as there will be many more leechers than seeders so karpo1's comment is correct. Only a few people sending and lots of people downloading (still makes it popular) = slow speeds until lots of people grab the whole torrent and seed back.
,theanarchist,2010-12-24T18:19Z,Usually the BiA releases are 1.6gb for 720p. Anyone know why this is so much larger and appears to be the same quality?
