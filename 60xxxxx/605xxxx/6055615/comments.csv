and it looks like all of the goodies are in here thanks man"
,mid.knight,2011-02-25T07:55Z,Great! More seeds please!!! 
,Imperator42,2011-03-01T06:09Z,"Nearly impossible to have a full discography from these guys with the amount of stuff they put out.
Anyway, a really interesting take on the music, whether you're a big fan of that particular band or not.
Though there's a point at which you only need a representative sampler. :)"

,spidey329,2011-04-12T15:43Z,"Awesome upload! I've really gotten into them lately.
I did notice a few tracks missing from the Weezer album and the Enya one isn't VSQ, it's actually ""Taliesin Orchestra"", ""Orinoco Flow: Enya for Orchestra"". I haven't had time to check everything else, but I figured I'd share what I found. Once again, Awesome upload!"
