Critical Beatdown is the debut full-length LP by the hip hop group known as the Ultramagnetic MCs. Released in 1988, it was the first full-length example of the influential style of the MCs: the bizarre, lyrical imagery, the unexpected and unpredictable polysyllabic rhymes and the innovative sampling. Critical Beatdown was re-released in 2004, with additional tracks.
