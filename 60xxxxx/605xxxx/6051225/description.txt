Thx Hive

CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D

Source:

Video: Russian R5 DVD-9
Neupravlyaemij.2010.DVD-9
Audio: Unstoppable.2010.R5.V2.LiNE.AC3.XViD-iNK
thx ink for syncing
and the Russian 5.1 Audiotrack

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 2000 2pass
Audio: English AC3 5.1 @384
Sample: yes included

Encode:

Same Video as before

Audio was still a lot to do. Inks V2 audio was basically good synced but
inbetween words and sentences that werent lipsync.
Since all used the same audio for theire own releases every release
from that point on has the same equal flaws.
if someone really did some syncs more than in inks v2 than sorry i am not aware of it
since every release has the same comments about ooseness going in and out, i have to assume they are unchanged.

So i said to myself hell if nobody does is it i will try it.
Took me 5 hours and more than 50 cuts to sync the center, lets say to 99% lipsync,
and embedded it again in the russian 5.1 track which had bitrate 384 btw and not 448.

it maybe more than the 20th release but its the most synced version out.

With an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train barreling toward a city,
a veteran engineer and a young conductor race against the clock to prevent a catastrophe.
