A collection of more than 400 music videos.
About half of them are DVD Rips, and the rest is broadcast recordings.
The aspect ratio is suited for a 16/9 screen.
Definition is generally 512 x 288 or higher. Since most videos were recorded with a quality only suitable for TV broadcast, it is no use having a higher definition (even when encoded from a DVD).
None of the videos are live recordings (I don't see the point).
Most musics are from the 80's and early 90's, with some more recent stuff.
The files are very small because I used the best codex around:
video stream encoded with x264 with a crf (constant rate factor) of 27.
This means that all videos look as good, but the size of the file depends greatly on the complexity of the video to encode.
Audio is in AAC at 44,1 kHz and 48 kb/s. Volume level has been normalized so that all videos sound as loud.

Enjoy.
