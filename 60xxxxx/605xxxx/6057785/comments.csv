,Taurean6,2012-02-05T19:21Z,"After i downloaded this torrent, ultrastar got all f*cked up and didn't work properly, shut down at once. Also, bittorrent is not working as it should, i have never experienced that before. There's also trouble after i deleted torrent + data.

Leads me to thinking this torrent is infected. ADVICED TO NOW DOWNLOAD!"
