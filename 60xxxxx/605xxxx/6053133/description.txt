ReleaseNotes:

The Eagles exploded on the charts in 1975 with One of These Nights, the first of four straight albums by the band to reach No. 1. The album was their most varied to date, with the discofied title track, the stately waltz "Take It To the Limit," and the tough, cynical country rocker "Lyin' Eyes." The album contains a couple of unusual numbers as well, including Bernie Leadon's psychedelic banjo showcase "Journey of the Sorcerer" and "I Wish You Peace," which Leadon wrote with his then-girlfriend, future first daughter (by virtue of her parents, Ron and Nancy
Reagan) and nude model (courtesy of Playboy), Patti Davis. --Daniel Durchholz
