But just make sure that you do mount the NoCD image with Toast. The Finder may appear to be able to successfully mount it but then it doesn't get recognized by ZT2."
,candacelee,2010-12-22T06:07Z,"I downloaded it through limewire but it won't mount with toast, please give more info on how to make it work I'm stuck!!"
,Marsiblu,2010-12-23T11:39Z,"@candacelee Try installing the free updates on the Apple website first, since they add support for Intel Macs."
,furdiddy,2010-12-24T03:55Z,"okay, im new mac user with toast.  how do you mount this with toast?  any help greatly appreciated :)"
,furdiddy,2010-12-24T03:56Z,"i just got toast for my mac, how do you mount with toast to use this?? any help's greatly appreciated thanks fellas!"
,nocodex,2010-12-25T22:14Z,"to mount it (how i did it) go to toast (program), choose from the menu above (file, edit, etc) and select ultilities -> mount disk image, then select the no CD file that came together with the download. A disk image should appear in your desktop."
,nocodex,2010-12-25T22:16Z,"My game quits after 2-3 min after I open it... :(
any ideas?"
,CamDaMan420,2011-01-06T09:15Z,EASY FIX.  My game quit after 2-3 min also. I tried the patch/patches but couldn't get them to work.  Easy fix is disable two finger scrolling in your system preferences/trackpad.  My might mouse still works for in-game zoom and game doesn't crash at all.  Hope that helps
,limeguy,2011-01-16T15:41Z,"Why don't you people just go out and buy physical CDs? A spindle of 50 at Staples is $20... it'll save you time AND bandwith. I only use torrents with real CDs, that way I don't murder my hard disk space."
,KosciakPL,2011-01-31T13:08Z,Press ZooTycoonNoCD.toast (or something like it) with second mouse button then select open with Toast Titanum. Wait for a moment then select a Mount at the bottom. NoCD is on the air!
,KosciakPL,2011-01-31T13:09Z,"If you can't run it put Zoo Tycoon 2.app in the Applications folder on Macintosh HD, not in your user Apps folder."
,A.Lau,2011-02-21T12:29Z,nice torrent! im so gonna enjoy it! thx anyway
,A.Lau,2011-02-21T12:43Z,yes it works! god damn works! superb fun! thx KosciakPL
,BraMz,2011-03-06T17:18Z,"Ok could please someone help me on this, i tried several things, but i'm unable to install Zoo Tycoon :

1 - I downloaded Toast Titanium
2 - I downloaded the torrent, after completion I got a map in my download folder which contained 2 files: Zoo Tycoon 2 No CD.toast & Zoo Tycoon 2.dmg
3 - As i read here, i should open the file Zoo Tycoon 2 No CD.toast in Toast Titanium and mount it. I did there appeared an icon on my desktop (with a spiderman on it).

But then when i dubbel click that icon it opens a screen with a giraffe and the text: 'To install, drag the ZT2 icon to your hard disk'. But all there is, is the file 'Zoo Tycoon 2 No CD.txt' ...

What am i doing wrong? (i'm a new mac user, so maybe i just forget something to do..)?

Please help :)"

,Woodenman,2011-07-22T18:06Z,"Doesn't work for me unfortunately, make sure the original game cd is in your mac's Cd-rom drive and try again... I's there anybody who knows what's wrong?"
,reyrod3,2011-07-31T15:23Z,"I found the easiest way to do it was to toast to a disk and just install to my hard disk. ( i am a beginner so i hope that helps)

,luvon,2011-08-11T10:18Z,hey has anyone checked if this works on Lion OS. 
,willwill20,2011-08-12T09:43Z,Doesn't work for OS X Lion: 'PowerPc-programs are no longer supported'
,jolteonsock,2011-08-22T18:30Z,"I have snow leoperd should that make a difference? Because like most of them I'm mounting it on toast with the ""utilitiees -> mount disk"" thing then when I click the .dmg file it still tells me to insert the CD rom."
,jolteonsock,2011-08-23T06:11Z,"ok for those having the same problem as braMz I think I figured it out. I'm a mac noob too and although I followed those steps it was still telling me to insert disk. 

 Open up the finder in your dock (the thing with all your app shortcuts on the bottom) and drag the zoo tycoon 2 icon onto the macintosh hd. once it's in there THEN you go to toast and do the utilize-> mount spiderman disc and lastly from the macintosh hd menu in finder you can double click that zoo tycoon 2 in order to start the game.

 worked for me and hope it helps."
,iaan1,2011-09-16T11:35Z,"Hey. Thank you 

But I have the following problem.

I copy it on to my Mac HD, and I mount the nocd.toast file with toast 9 and the CD icon with spiderman on it appears on the desktop. I open the ZT2 icon in my HD but I still get the original CD error."
