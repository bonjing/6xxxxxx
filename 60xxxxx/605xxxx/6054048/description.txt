    The Hairy Bikers, Si King and Dave Myers are on the        
    search for the most interesting food that Britain's       
    mums are cooking for their families this Christmas.      
                                                              
    Celebrating the very best of Christmas Cooking in          
    Britain, Si and Dave tour the nation hunting out          
    Britain's festive favourites and a few surprises. On     
    their journey they find mums cooking everything from      
    Roast Goose with all the trimmings to Pinnekjott           
    (that's salted cured lamb steamed over birch twigs to     
    you and me) and from festive Gingerbread to Christmassy  
    coconut samosas!                                          
    The lads also conjure up their own seasonal                
    specialities including loin of venison in home made       
    sloe gin and lime seared scallops with smoked salmon     
    fritters.                                                 
    The celebration of Christmas favourites culminates at a    
    snow-bound stately home filled with nearly 150 mums       
    tasting and sharing each others' favourite dishes.
