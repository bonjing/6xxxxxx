[Goddard's 2nd novel]

If you have never read Robert Goddard, start here, please! (Although, you could also start with his equally brilliant first novel Past Caring*). This book, despite dealing with some really thorny issues such as war, mistaken identity, blackmail, and abuse, retains such a misty quality about the narrative that you feel as if you are walking in someone else's dream. The mystery, far from being, shallow and gorey, like some American thrillers, insteady takes it's tension from a deep, involved and complicated series of realtionships and webs of lies that intruige the mind. The story begins and ends with a mother taking her daughter on a walk through a WWI battlefield cemetery in France, and explaining what has consumed her for most of her life: who her father was. The answer, finally given to her by a strange old artist, will surprise you. If you want a deep, intelligent mystery, you must read this book!
