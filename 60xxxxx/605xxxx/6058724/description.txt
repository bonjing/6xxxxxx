Pages: 512 | PDF 


The Glorious Foods of Greece is the magnum opus of Greek cuisine, the first book that takes the reader on a long and fascinating journey beyond the familiar Greece of blue-and-white postcard images and ubiquitous grilled fish and moussaka into the country's many different regions, where local customs and foodways have remaained intact for eons. In beautiful prose and with more than four hundred unusual recipes - many of them never before recorded - invites us to a Greece few visitors ever get to see.
