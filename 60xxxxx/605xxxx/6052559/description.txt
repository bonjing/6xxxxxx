         In July 1989, the Puppeteers of America held their          
       National Festival on the campus of MIT in Cambridge,          
       Massachusetts. The celebration of the art of puppetry         
       brings together hopeful students and master puppeteers        
       to share techniques and foster new ideas. It is a             
       celebration of the art and the artists who give it            
       life. When Jim Henson and Frank Oz appeared on stage          
       at one of the festival assemblies, it was an opportunity      
       for everyone to talk with them about their long               
       performing careers. Rowlf the Dog, Cookie Monster,            
       Fozzie Bear and Kermit the frog fielded questions too.        
                                                                     
         This puppeteer's evening with Jim Henson and Frank Oz       
       was a memorable event that has been enriched with             
       additional histories by Frank Oz.

         Puppeteers of America was never just an ordinary            
       interest group to Jim. As old as Jim himself, it was          
       at their annual festivals Jim would go to meet and be         
       inspired by great puppeteers who came before him, such        
       as Burr Tillstrom (Kukla, Fran and Ollie), Bill Baird         
       (Lonely Goatherd scene in The Sound of Music) and Edgar       
       Bergen (Charlie McCarthy, father of Candice Bergen).          
       It was among these senior puppeteers, at the 1961             
       festival, that Jim would first be introduced to what          
       we have previously described as Muppets 1.0: Frank Oz,        
       Jerry Juhl and Don Sahlin. Frank was the principal            
       performer together with Jim, Jerry wrote everything           
       Muppet for nearly 40 years, and Don created what became       
       the quintessential Muppet look from that moment on            
       until  his early death. Jim in many ways owed the rest        
       of his remarkable career to this organization, and the        
       great talent it had helped him find.                          
                                                                     
         When PoA then asked Jim and Frank if they could host        
       a one-hour discussion at the 1989 festival, they were         
       more than happy to oblige. Nobody could have known that       
       this would be their last chance to do so, as within a         
       year, Jim would have died. This made the appearance           
       all the more remarkable, and no puppeteer or aspiring         
       puppeteer in the audience will ever forget that very          
       special evening.                                              
                                                                     
         Clearly an amateur production, with nothing but a few       
       person crew, the appearance was filmed for use in the         
       organization's library. Following an introduction by          
       Frank Oz, filmed in 1993, they printed some VHS copies        
       for exclusive sale to their members. Hard to get even         
       when it was available, this title has been out of print       
       for many years, and was by far their most popular video       
       production ever. One of those tapes is our source, and        
       even if it's a decently taken care of retail copy,            
       original poor production values made for a rather low         
       quality rip. We've spent countless hours trying to            
       clean this up with the best of our abilities, using           
       several different professional grade players for              
       capturing different parts and assembling it all back          
       together, cleaning up noise, adjusting colors and so          
       on, but unfortunately it still doesn't look very good,        
       and the sound mixing makes it easy to miss a question         
       or two no matter what.                                        
                                                                     
         Looking beyond these technical flaws, this is a             
       truly inspiring insight into the minds of two of the          
       most talented puppeteers of the last century. Anyone          
       who can pull a piece of fleece out of a bag, stick his        
       hand up it, and make it immediately come alive in the         
       manner demonstrated here deserves to be called a master       
       of his craft.                                                 
                                                                     
         As an added homage to the organization that made this       
       all possible, we've included the promo for PoA as seen        
       on the original tape as an extra.

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.     
                                                 
                    Sit back and join us as we go looking      
                  for the rainbow connection, and remember    
               to check back daily. We'll be listing them     
                       here as we go!
