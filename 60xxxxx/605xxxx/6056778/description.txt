Alright then, I had problems decrypting this DVD series:  Forbrydelsen II.  
I managed to decrypt Disc one and two with DVD decrypter and DVD43. 
Disc Three and four refused to decrypt and someone was kind enough to suggest DVDFab.  This worked wonderfully.
I have just gotten around to play a copy of Disc one - E01-02-03.  
After the first ten minutes of each episode I got an error msg regarding copyrights and would not let me play further.
I have now checked Disc two which so far seems to be okay, is now playing E05 so I assume E06 will also play.
So, Disc one I have now decrypted with DVDFab and this is the upload.  I won\'t remove the torrents I have already uploaded as perhaps it\'s something I did to make the copy that it won\'t play.
But just in case, here is another torrent that is sure to work...
