BBC Four celebrates merry midwinter in unique style, with an exhilarating blend of folk
tradition and burlesque fun. Energetic 11-piece Bellowhead and Mercury-nominated
alternative folkies The Unthanks get together with the impressive young singers Thea
Gilmore and Lisa Knapp, plus other special guests.

Steered by genial host Paul Sartin, the assembled artists perform seasonal songs of their
own alongside yuletide favourites, ranging from folk ballads and carols to parlour songs
and carousing dance numbers, with everyone coming together for a final knees-up.

Filmed at the atmospheric Shoreditch Town Hall, the setting evokes an old music hall
combined with a festive Victorian family parlour, bedecked with garlands, period lamps
and fireplace. Even the audience are dressed up in old-fashioned finery and prove
themselves ready to kick up their heels.
