,Dragonite_9,2011-01-09T07:46Z,"Yep it's Jason Malachi alright!

But I must say, first, Vibrationist, is very simillar to MJ's voice in some parts, and listen to that song, and read what MJ's 2 nephews, two of the 3T's, are saying about some of the songs on the new Michael album are fake, look at their twitter if intrested.

Especially ""keep your head up"" the vibrato, compare it to Jason, it's too much alike, comparing to MJ's, which really got me doubting about a few of the songs beeing real myself. 

Although from the first time I heard all the songs, first I actually said to my family was that a few of the songs, was too much of, and not just because of the (over) editing made in it..
Just a tips, listen to that song, all I wanted to say..

Best regards! Peace."
