them looping isn't any trouble.
luckily its very easy to edit avi files (Fast AVI MPEG Splitter is great) to make each of the three clips a separate avi that doesn't loop twice."

oh well.  just need to convert it to avi :p"
,SanctimoniousApe,2010-12-28T07:14Z,Or just use AVIDemux.
,SanctimoniousApe,2010-12-28T07:18Z,"(Don't let the name fool you, [url=http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/]AVIDemux[/url] handles most any format of consequence)."
