[V],catflap,2010-12-20T03:03Z,"THIS IS A FAKE!

axxo hasn't released a thing for almost 2 years.

although this MIGHT be the real film, it
is DEFINITELY NOT An AXXO FILE.

do not download anything from this person
or you take the risk of getting screwed with
trojans, viruses, or passworded crap.

ANY NEW FILM WITH AXXO'S
TAG RELEASED AFTER MARCH 11, 2009
IS A FAKE. "
,DarthBubba,2010-12-20T06:51Z,"@sceneline:  Do good work and develop your own reputation.  

Don't leach off aXXo's reputation.  You fool no one and make others suspicious of your intentions and your work."
,georgewfindanothercountry,2010-12-21T08:36Z,"this is b.s.!!! so tired of pricks treading on scenelines torrents only because of their envy of the word ""axxo."" there is no virus in any of his torrents. a/v is always 10/10. plus almost all movies r under 800 mb. could not ask for better but anuses like ""catflap"" critisize every one of his torrents for no legitimate reason and scare good people away and bring administrators against a great uploader for the bay. sceneline should be getting his/her skull instead of locks. adapa you obviously have not assesed the situation thoroughly. As for the rest of the axxo followers... dont be hipocritical when it comes to copyright infringement. Besides axxo is only being used as a tag not a screenname; therefore, no pirate crime has been comitted. sceneline dont let this minor setback get u down. me and thousands more appreciate ur hard work and fantastic torrents! look forward to seeing ur skull come soon. hope its adapa that rewards it ;) "
,pokehim69,2010-12-21T11:32Z,"There is nothing wrong with scenelines torrents!  By tagging them axxo, he is just offering his good work out to the thousands of people who still search axxo's name.  He compresses nicely and produces a plentiful supply of A-Grade torrents!  Keep it up sceneline - I and many others appreciate your efforts :-)"
,Shawno77,2010-12-21T14:19Z,Great quality. Cheers to the person who uploaded. Don't give a crap if it's aXXo or not. Get over yourselves.
,georgewfindanothercountry,2010-12-21T17:01Z,"""About bloody time this sceneline aka AXXO imposter got sorted out"" only a dirt nigger would say such a thing. sceneline earned the reputation as the new axxo. "
,Chasenuva1,2010-12-21T23:30Z,"I just downloaded this (with some hesitation because of previous comments) and it isn't trojans, viruses, or passworded crap like catflap says, but still, i couldnt get the movie to play. it had the sound, but no screen. am i doing something wrong, or is this a complete waste of time?"
,georgewfindanothercountry,2010-12-22T00:24Z,"Chasenuva1: since my free subscription to divix ran out I had the same problem. windows media player (and many others) wont read ""codecs"" without authorization. I googled about this and from others' point of view ,who are more informed suggested, to use ""ffdshow."" I used this codec decoder since and works for every movie in various formats. I found it online but there is a codec pack on the bay that has ""Ac3"" audio decoder, ""vobsub"" subtitle decoder, and ""ffdshow."" The dl is from 2007 but anything is better than dl'ing from a .com. "
,hoddi1,2010-12-22T02:46Z,"Try uploading K-lite Mega Codec Pack 6.6.6
That may help some..."
,Jted1,2010-12-22T06:06Z,"EveryOne Who Says AXXO's Stuff Is Fake Should Get Their Stories Straight. The Majority Of My Downloads Are From AXXO And I've Never Had A Problem Downloading and A/V Is Always 10/10. 

Keep Doing What You Do AXXO And Thanks For The Downloads"
,Renegade1970,2010-12-22T10:54Z,"keep up the good work sceneline, we all appreciate your efforts and a small group of us check your uploads daily because we know and respect you like FXG , raymond and other quality uploaders"
,kevski,2010-12-22T13:24Z,"2 things about this AVI - it doesn't come with subs (and there's no in-built subs for the spoken Russian pieces), and the audio sync is way out for the last 5 mins or so. Other than that, good quality."
,spinx31,2010-12-22T17:23Z,"Wow you are really going in hard on this catflap. Do you have nothing else to do??? Even if this dude isn't axxo, big deal, YOU ARE STILL STEALING MOVIES NO MATTER WHO UPLOADS IT!! wrong is wrong, is wrong, is wrong. Give it a rest man, go smoke one or holla at a bitch or something. Do something productive with your time.  Your making yourself look like a real hater right now. And that is never a good thing."
,georgewfindanothercountry,2010-12-22T21:29Z,"@ ""WHY WOULD YOU TRY TO MAKE OUT YOUR A TRUSTED DOWNLOADER JUST SO PEOPLE WOULD DOWNLOAD FROM YOU???"" because scenelines torrents r as good as axxo-torrents. He only used the word axxo in his torrents so people could find his grade A uploads. catflap is a douche read others comments."
[S],WTCSWE,2010-12-24T10:07Z,"@ sceneline

When you start labeling your torrents correctly,then you might understand what we are talking about.Can't be that hard to follow simple rules, is it?


TO ALL:

If every user labeled their torrents as aXXo uploads to boost their uploads ,then go figure and do the math yourselfs.
This is for the interest of every simple user out there that we try to protect from fakes/infected crap etc... Sceneline might be good (uploads),but the line has to be drawn somewhere in order to keep TPB clean."
,uglyrtard,2010-12-27T11:30Z,u got told sceneline hahhaha
,SOULWOLF,2010-12-29T00:40Z,Thank You Very Much the video Quality is Great the Audio does go out of sync near the end but not enough to spoil the film Thank You once again x
,cartman19987,2011-01-01T06:50Z,Thanks for this!
,Schlopy,2011-01-01T23:14Z,Maybe sceneline is just trying to build up status. Maybe thats why axxo is on his/her stuff to show its axxo quality
,4for2,2011-01-02T13:15Z,why does everyone hate so wat if he is using axxo as his name the movies are real and great also this is a real file not fake 
,niranj123,2011-01-08T13:33Z,gr8..but would be better if u post with the eng subs
,Mistybabe,2011-01-13T12:11Z,"I know this is not the place, but can you please upload a good version of ""Speed"" for me, The one i got is good but has subtitles down the bottom. Pls :-) I have realised your copies are good, hence why I have asked."
,pizzamuncher582,2011-01-15T04:14Z,"hey mistybabe, to remove your subtitles for speed, just go to the dload file, and delete the sub file. should be just a few kilobites."
,jstfknlvly,2011-01-16T17:29Z,"Lots of crying going on here. Only from the people who know nothing as usual!!! Seems simple, >> upload or dont, easy decision. "
,neozelandes,2011-01-21T18:40Z,how come the sound is so crappy in these aXXo vids i play them and can hardly hear what thare saying how do i fix this
,Pilbromatic,2011-06-13T10:41Z,"Hi all, these subtitles match up pretty close.

http://subscene.com/english/Salt/subtitle-388477.aspx

The audio gets out of sync with the video over time though, it gets noticeable after the first hour or so. Otherwise, the video and audio quality are pretty good. Enjoy!"
,TurtleNeckFurry,2011-07-30T16:41Z,"Going By File Size....
V: 9
A: 7 (A Little Low if you don't have AC3 Filter)
M: 8

SUBS! (WILL NEED FOR RUSSIAN PARTS!) - http://subscene.com/english/Salt-Directors-Cut/subtitle-383889.aspx

IF SOUND IS LOW FOR YOU! (or any movie) - http://ac3filter.net/wiki/Download_AC3Filter . It comes on with the icons near desktop clock when you open a movie (I use realplayer, don't know if it works for other players).
