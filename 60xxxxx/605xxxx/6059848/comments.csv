,crazydementedman,2010-12-23T05:42Z,Video 10 Audio 9 Definitely better than cam audio. At least thats what i got from the sample. It is the best so far. Worth the download
,sxp64,2010-12-23T21:16Z,"XViD can never be the 'BEST SO FAR"", it's a crap codec. x264 FTW!"
,crazydementedman,2010-12-23T23:02Z,x264 FTW dont know what that is...
,weaping_reaper,2010-12-24T03:31Z,So.................. Is this one better than the Rx-unstopable V2-r5 ? or not?
,Vin-Man,2010-12-24T06:31Z,"Has anybody been able to play this on their home DVD player. It plays on My computer on all the media players but not My home DVD player. Never had this problem with others movies. It says, ""area prohibited"" cannot play. Anybody help please."

,doozergreengrass,2011-01-03T02:55Z,"Very good copy, came up awesome on 50"" tv upscaled via dvd to 720p. Audio pretty good but not 100%.

A = 7.5
V = 9"
,dolphinsmarlins1,2011-01-09T04:31Z,"Perhaps someone could help me out.  I am getting video, but the sound isn't there.  I tried downloading the most recent version of xvid, bit no luck.  I am new to this, so any assistance would be much appreciated.  The video looks good!"
,foodlib,2011-01-18T03:53Z,"thanks for the up, best copy i've seen so far
video is great, the audio was good too, but it would cut out or drop out of sync just for like milliseconds maybe a dozen times throughout. not too much of an annoyance but kinda shitty regardless"
