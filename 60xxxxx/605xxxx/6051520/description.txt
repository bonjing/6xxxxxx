
ONLY IF YOU'VE MISSED SOMETHING
 

For info about subtitles in torrent click on "Files" on this page.
For detailed information about encodings, download corresponding .nfo.
	

Click on "Files" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose "Don't download". 
(uTorrent would show "Skipped").
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

*** You would seed JUST the things you choose to download. ***
*** SHARE with others - keep your upload speed at 80% of your max ***
*** during the download. DO NOT force me to block and ban selfish ***
*** and greedy downloaders - as happened March - May 2010.  ***

*** 2-pass encoding for PC, PS3 or Xbox . ***
*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

REQUESTS ARE "FROZEN".

NOTE: TimeToLive 24h (torrent's TTL) Don't take too much, time would run out.

Maybe is better to use individual torrents (in case you are on slow connection)
by clicking on my screen-name and choosing movie-torrent only. (and for info too)
