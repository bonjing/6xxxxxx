1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: RPG

  
We forgot to mention in our previous pack that the update required the 
cracked files from our original release. We included them in this pack for 
all people who were unable to figure it out by themselves. 
   

Proper Note:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SKIDROW did not crack the securom protection, but patched the activation 
routine to bypass the protection. This is not an accepted method for a 
crack.
Included is a proper crack with the securom protection removed. Unlike the 
previous release, this update also works with savegames from the original 
release.
