,Spinx3r,2010-12-21T11:40Z,This movie needs to be watched in HD.
,billyboy999,2010-12-21T11:48Z,"@5amjr - You are an idiotic moron.....Oh I forgot, its well known that people below a certain IQ level are totally in-capable of using program's like WinRAR .It only takes a  few seconds  to un-rar a movie if you've got a 21st century computer(and a small brain."

,orgs,2010-12-21T16:29Z,"Hey Billyboy999 and IngesFingers :
It's clear who the idiots are ... wasn't there a day when you both freaked when you saw a Rar file ? I'll answer :  Yes there was that day ! I was sharing files since you were in diapers (apparently not that long ago) ... I understand your ""usenet"" point ... Are we using usenet ?  I'll answer again:  No we are not ! Why bitch ? ... You know as well as anyone that rars are a pain in the ass. It's outdated technology (except for usenet etc). First it absorbs HD space, especially if you forget to delete the rar once unpacked. Secondly, compression methods max your CPU when unpacking (I have dual core and shitloads of RAM) ... still it slows down your comp for 4 or 5 minutes (NOT a few seconds). I'm not bitching ! ... I gladly download rar files ... no prob ... but guess what ? ... when I re-up something, I up the unpacked version (out of courtesy) ... Usenet etc etc are the only reason to use rars in the 21st century ... torrents check themselves ... so I don't wanna hear your bullshit about corrupted files etc  etc.  Everyone was a noob at one point and people helped you/us then ... why not do the same ... instead of thinking you're all cool and shit for slamming somebody. It's obvious that you appreciated the people who helped you when you needed it. My 4 year old can unpack a rar ... you're right it is easy ... a monkey could do it (well .... at least my monkey can) ... so again, you're not all ""cool"" cause you can unpack compressed files (questionable whether they are even compressed). So within the realm of sharing ... help people and share your ""extreme unpacking skills"" with someone. Be nice, use those extreme skills ... unpack and re-up it !! .... remember ... ""it's easy"" !!  I know the alleged noob claimed rars were all virus laden .... I know that's not true ... although ""wrapping something up"" does allow for malicious files to be easily hidden. My point being, .... share your ""so called"" knowledge along with sharing files. Just like a rar .... it's what on the inside that counts ! Don't be a dick ... although I suspect that you can't help it !!"
,orgs,2010-12-21T16:41Z,"Oh ... and 5amjr
Same to you ... don't be a dick ... You should know what you're talking about before making silly statements. For the record ..... I've been on this site (and others) since torrents came along  ... I have downloaded thousands of torrents over the last 6 or 7 years ... many of them rars ... I have never been infected by a single file from this site ... utilize your AV program"
,bonzai37,2010-12-21T17:09Z,Thanks!!
,kinvore,2010-12-21T17:36Z,"While I agree that rar's are outdated and tend to encourage leeching (because it forces people to keep two copies of the movie on their HD, basically), I also agree that 5amjr is an idiot.

If your head wasn't up your ass you'd know that safcuk and his partner in crime fabreezy have a great history of uploads.  They don't upload trojans or viruses you shitwit."
,V3nDetta_,2010-12-21T17:50Z,"so its a .rar file...so what. Its simple if you personally dont trust a file uploaded by a trusted member, then move along and dont download the damn thing. Dont whine about how the file was made on here if you arent going to bother checking it out."
,un1golan,2010-12-21T18:37Z,"Why do you make torrents of a split rar file? I know you may upload it to a filesave site...
But, if I download, I wish to watch it. so I need to un-rar. Keeping both the rar to seed and video to watch... is waste of space. Guess which one goes first from my HDD?"
,brenoseifert,2010-12-21T18:39Z,Sorry I meant fatytkt was spamming
,orgs,2010-12-21T18:50Z,"@kinvore
Great point about rars encouraging leeching .... Many people unpack the rar and then delete the original file. Again, I'm not bitching about rar files ... but you're right ... people are less likely to seed a rar"
,leon-of-teamtptb,2010-12-21T19:10Z,buy a bigger hdd there is nothing wrong with rar files and it does take a few seconds to unrar well it does on my system about 20 seconds it would take to unrar 1.38gb dont know were u get ya 4-5 mins from unless your comp is shit or u dont know what u r doing n thanx SAFCukO09 i understand why you use rar files 
,bdiddly1,2010-12-21T20:21Z,"5amjr-wtf are you on""all rars are virus's""?-are you for real?and what a cheek you have calling anyone a noob-most of the game downloads are rars&theres fuck all wrong with em-like someone pointed out your probably stumped wen it comes to using winrar-U ARE THE NOOB ASSWIPE!"
[T],AW-,2010-12-21T22:36Z,"Naaa, Ban the rars.
I love winrar, not for torrents though.
I have  2 machines side by side with 3.5 TBs on each about half full each.

I like good maintenance! means delete it when you reach your ratio, unrar, delete rars. I'll never seed that torrent again, not like hundreds of avis i have from here. I can fill up a 2TB drive fast enough. when i have to go back and delete the avi or rar;s to free up space, i choose the rars.
Nothing pleases me more then to go back and seed a avi torrent that's been dead  over a year, the only leecher for weeks pleading for a seed.
Nothing irritates me more then getting a rar that has a password. don't care if the pass is included.

Old school sh*t, listen to that old fart orgs...:)

thanks "

,mkiller,2010-12-23T12:55Z,@orgs - well u are right in some points but rars nowdays are 100% untrusteble at least i dont trust them...
,Aurasan,2010-12-24T03:15Z,"rars suck.. thus the reason the unrared torrent by IMAGiNE has 6x the seeds and 18x the leechers of this one. the only conceivable point of rars is to save space.. oh wait they dont even do that well. I say dont bother getting winrar and waiting 3-5 minutes to unrar huge files.. after spending several hours waiting for something to download I'm sure many others, like myself, do not want to wait several more minutes to be able to watch the damn thing. Not to mention the BS ups that some people put where you need a ""password"" or some such shit which you can only get by paying for a membership at a place that will most likely scam your card number. Basically, rar=fail. You dont like it fine, but dont try to cram rars down peoples throats. They taste like dog food mixed with whale shit."
,sabretooth1,2010-12-28T18:55Z,"Excellent movie, was fantastic in 3D! 
Cam's are always shit in comparison. But if like me you just can't wait to watch it again, it's the only choice.  

Thank you to Imagine and uploader.

some advice.......
DON'T FUCKING WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET IN THE CINEMA! 

you have been warned...."
