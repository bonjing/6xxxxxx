The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 19 December 2010


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.

The Infowars web site describes today's broadcast as follows.

Alex talks with the Senator-elect for Kentucky, Rand Paul, former federal prosecutor and former member of the United States House of Representatives, Bob Barr, and osteopathic physician, health activist, and entrepreneur, Joseph Mercola. 

Today's broadcast is an encore presentation of the Alex Jones Show.

As the Christmas holiday approaches, it is probably safe to expect more of these copy-and-paste shows. Alex typically does it this way rather than rebroadcasting a previous day's show intact.  I will try to continue to make these "remixes" available -- but probably in hour blocks rather than half-hour -- until the Jones show returns to live broadcasts.

Not able to find a torrent of mine where or when you 
expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am
uploading, tracker problems, etc..

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
