,iDoiStuff,2010-12-20T19:03Z,"Works great! I tried one USB flash drive and it didn't work and I tried a different one and it worked perfect.

Just drag the folder PS3 to flash drive.
On PS3 go to THEME SETTINGS> THEME> INSTALL
Click on the theme you want (from the flash drive)
Install.

Works great, thanks."
