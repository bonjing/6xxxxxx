Itâ€™s the holiday season, and gift-giving is all around us. Dr. Phil speaks with families about life-changing choices this holiday season and the ultimate gift â€” the gift of life. Darrell, 55, has diabetes and needs a new kidney. For the last five years, heâ€™s spent four hours a day, six days a week hooked up to a dialysis machine. So why havenâ€™t Darrellâ€™s family members gotten tested to see if theyâ€™re a match for donating a much-needed kidney? Grammy Award-winning singer and author of Love Brought Me Back, Natalie Cole, shares her harrowing journey with kidney failure and the gift that saved her life. She speaks from her heart about losing her sister on the same day she received the kidney, meeting her donorâ€™s family and her advice to Darrellâ€™s family.
