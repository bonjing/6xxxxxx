Encoder's Note's
Ok so i made a small script to resize & sharpen.
I dropped that into vdubmod.
Then i increased the brightness & contrast.
After that i de-interlaced, denoised and changed the colours with a rgb eq.
Finaly i converted the audio to mp3 & muxed it to my encode.
It doesnt look great because i lost a bit of detail, de-noising & de-interlacing.
There is still a little bit of noise but de-noising anymore would of made it look to smooth.
The audio is prety good. 
All in all its watchable, better than a cam but not as good as a r5.
Enjoy another Kingdom Release ;)
