[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-19T23:49Z,you are not gaining much by making these mod16 compliant.  been better off at 480x200 for this I think. 2.4 ar.  8 pixels is a lot for size this small in my opinion.
[T],on.off.on,2010-12-20T00:00Z,thx HR ill keep that in mind :-)
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-20T00:32Z,"mod16 makes for a smaller file, but only by a very little amount.  used to be a bug year or so ago in vlc where it would display a green line in window mode if the file wasn't mod16 but that has since been fixed.

mod16 is a scene rule only.  you will see others like CHD or HDChina do not obey it to create a more correct AR.  Otherwise you can pad to the next 16th if you so choose, but I dont see the value in that either anymore.  Some pro's may argue, but meh, I don't care.  It looks better.  you can read about macroblock on wikipedia, maybe find a good argument for me to keep using mod16."

,mdiggity,2011-01-11T08:48Z,HR & OOO... would the difference that you are describing above be the reason that I can play HR's uploads in my Sony Blu-ray via the usb drive but I can't play OOO's?  I have tried changing the file type but that does not work.  I can play both in my ipod and on the computer with no problems.  Any suggestions?
