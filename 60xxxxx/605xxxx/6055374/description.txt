My discography of good, but rather obscure band from the mid 80s, named The Thought. They never got the recognition they deserved, but did have limited recognition with their covers of the Electric Prunes song "I had too much to dream last night" and a cover of the Byrds song "8 Miles High". I know there is a 12" of the latter I have somewhere in storage but as it is same version as on the album it didn't seem worth digging out.
