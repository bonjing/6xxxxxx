When it comes to food, the Chinese have a common saying, â€œThe masses regard food as their heaven,â€ which means that food is peopleâ€™s primal want. It should clearly justify the importance that â€œeatingâ€ holds in Chinese peopleâ€™s lives. Eating is not just meant to ?ll the stomach; having food at oneâ€™s disposal, being able to consume a good amount of food, and knowing what and how to eat are all viewed as a good â€œfortune.â€ Those who promote food culture often use the words of Chinese philosopher Confucius, â€œdiet and love-making, all primal needs of every human being,â€ ?nding an aspiring and positive thought basis for such an epicurean lifestyle. Thereâ€™s probably not another place in this world that has as great a variety of delicious fare as China. If judging by the art and techniques of cooking, aside from France and Italy, perhaps the skills of chefs of no other country can gain recognition from the Chinese.
