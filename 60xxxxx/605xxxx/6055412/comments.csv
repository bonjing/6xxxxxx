,aarque,2010-12-21T15:22Z,"trolling is older and even more boring. fsaqui, please continue to seed any FSX ware you care to. The leechers will decide what lives and dies, not some funky troll which has never uploaded a dam thing but vitriolic spite."
,fsaqui,2010-12-21T16:44Z,"aarque, sorry for my aggressive response friend, I'm newbie in TPB and I know I will always be idiots who consider themselves veterans to speak ill of my work. Thanks for the comment, I'm always seeding the torrents that I put here. :D"

,Kaasbaas,2011-01-17T05:41Z,"The radio doesn't work for me, luckily ILS still works but no radio. Also, the auto brake knob in VC does not work and doesn't look the same as in the 2D cockpit which does work and look properly.

I haven't found any problems than that on my first flight, and other than that I fell in love with it. So if anyone knows how to fix the radio problem, I'd appreciate it!"
,Kaasbaas,2011-01-17T19:15Z,Sorry I forgot to mention that that the problems mentioned in my previous comment are about the the boeing 767.
