                    'Tis the week before Christmas and all through  
                    the estate, not much of anything is happening,  
                    until one of the gang sees some graffiti that  
                    offers 'Money for Powers'. At the address  
                    advertised they meet Seth, a drug dealer who  
                    was also struck in the storm and now has the  
                    ability to deal powers. Nothing good comes of  
                    Seth's presence on the estate - certainly  
                    nothing which carries a festive message of  
                    peace and goodwill to all men. A disgruntled  
                    priest, quick-fix money-making schemes, lost  
                    powers, and a nativity scene that has to be  
                    seen to be believed, all add up to Christmas,  
                    Misfits style.
