Hi there â€“ this is my MOMENTUM CD released 20/10/2010

The songs are more personal and direct than on the first. Most are referring to real people and real incidents. Iâ€™m not pulling too many punches here. The melodic SNAIL slant is very much in evidence, although with less keyboard textures and more guitar. All in all, itâ€™s a great deal more raw and organic.  Hereâ€™s the track listing:

01.	When She Left You
02.	Momentum
03.	I Believe In Love
04.	Evensong
05.	Speak To Me
06.	My Master Plan
07.	Patrick
08.	Oh Jenny
09.	We Never Really Leave
10.	Kenneth
11.	The Sound Of Warm

As ever, all songs, performances and production by me. Even the sleeve design. Free to you my friends. Thank you for your friendship and support. Hope you like it.

Best wishes,

David
