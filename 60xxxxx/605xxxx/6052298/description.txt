The DÃƒÂ¸ is a French/Finnish indie pop band founded in Paris in 2005. The band is Olivia Bouyssou-Merilahti (singer and musician) and Dan Levy (multi-instrumentalist). The duo has been backed on stage by three different drummers (JÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ©mie Pontier 2007-2008, JosÃƒÂ© Joyette 2008-2009, Pierre Belleville since 2009). Their first studio album A Mouthful topped the French charts in 2008, making them the first French act singing in English to reach that position.
