Are leaders born, or made? And what's the single most important quality a real leader should possess? Philosophers and management theorists have endlessly debated-and just as endlessly written about-these subjects for centuries. Finally, here's a book that cuts to the chase. In 68 of the most succinct, no-punches-pulled pages you'll ever read, acclaimed author-speaker-coach John Baldoni maintains that "leadership presence" is a form of communication that can be learned, and then provides the hows and the whys of learning it. He starts by defining what genuine leadership presence is, and discusses right and wrong ways to demonstrate leadership taken from real-life examples. Baldoni explains how to communicate your objectives in ways that encourage people to buy into the process-even if it includes tough subjects like layoffs, closures, and terminations.
