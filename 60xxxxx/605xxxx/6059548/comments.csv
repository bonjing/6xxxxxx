[V],Koedje,2010-12-23T15:07Z,"you know that aint true, dont spam my torrents please."
,User897,2010-12-24T10:35Z,"You are wrong.  This is the Special Edition version, not the original from 1977.  Get your facts straight.  The version of the film here is from 2004 or 2006, which means it is from the 1997 Special Edition, plus tweaks made to the film in 2004 for the first DVD release and then the repackaged DVD in 2006.  Your description even states ""(special edition)"", so before you call me a spammer, you might want to check your fucking facts.  As it stands, your torrent is incorrectly named."

,User897,2010-12-31T01:40Z,"Please read my above comment.  It is the 2004/2006 DVD version.  NOT THE 1977 ORIGINAL!  Spoken language is English, text is Dutch."
,Juggalo40k,2011-01-09T09:14Z,"i would like to thank Koedje for this movie.it is listed as crap,but it isnt.good picture,good sound.however,this is most definately not the 1977 release.i saw this in the theatres when it came out.im a huge star wars nut,seen the originals a million times and the re-releases.for one thingthey didnt have special effects like this in 77.Boba fett was also not in a new hope's original..nor was jabba.that being said,it is still a good DL."
,User897,2011-01-10T01:16Z,"As long as this torrent remains incorrectly named, it will continue to get bad ratings.  It is NOT what the uploader states it is."
,user787,2011-02-20T11:18Z,"who givbes a flying fuck. Thanks koedje. Keep up the good work, to the other pricks shut your fucking pieholes"
,gr8fuldead26,2011-07-18T04:28Z,I give a fuck.  Dont label it as 1977 when its a 1999 film please.  Ill second that motion.  Idiots like this uploader are causing it to be VERY difficult for me to find the REAL 1977 version.
