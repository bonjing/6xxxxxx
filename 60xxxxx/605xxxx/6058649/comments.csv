We caught a small portion of this movie on the retro movie channel today and are very much looking forward to seeing the whole thing.  The wife and I cannot understand why we had never before heard of this movie?  With such a cast of characters you would have thought it would have been better known.
Thanks again!  You appear to be the only person who has uploaded this and we appreciate you for it!"
