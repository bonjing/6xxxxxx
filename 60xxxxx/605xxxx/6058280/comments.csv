Worked fine. used it on two computers and all good.

Nice and easy for us beginners.
Very Happy :D"
,Yogsta72,2011-04-24T03:04Z,"@samxkim

Easy as Bro, 
1, Open the folder with the three key gens in it, 
2, Open the FFF key gen and run it, 
3, Copy the info from the key gen to paper or notebook/word. 
4, Close the key gen.
5, Open MBAM
6, Click on register
7, Enter the info you put on paper or in notepad/word into each field
I.E: user Id = ***** and serial = ****-****-****-****
8, Hit register and all should be good, if not run the key gen again and get a new number."

For if you've heard of false positives, that's what your AVG found.

p.s. i have AVG as well, if it suspects it as a virus, ignore it, disable your resident shield, then you can use the keygen. 

THANKS A LOT!"
,magnu1975,2011-06-30T19:15Z,Good work uploader. Tried with FFF and works on latest version after disabling shield in AVG first. Only strange thing is in the about menu the licence info has disappeated from view after updating Mbytes but still shows as PRO version in title bar.
,Dexcimus,2011-07-15T10:37Z,"ATTENTION!!!  This file when unpacked is infected.  A scan using Malwarebytes free edition shows 3 infected files entitled ""Don't steal our work"". This was uploaded by Malwarebytes to discourage piracy.  "

Obviously you're a newbie who has no idea what he's talking about.

Your info is already described in the included  install notes.
Indeed the keygen has been added to MBAM's database. But that is just to prevent dummies like you to use it.

Also: learn about false positives, and get yourself Sandboxie to test and run keygens etc:

,dothackjhe,2011-08-28T14:01Z,BitDefender Total Security 2011 weren't able to fully disinfect the infected files as a result of the viruses from the other keygens included in the rar.

Could you stop crying about viruses? It's just false positive and you are spamming the comment section with useless make-believe, if you don't know shit about these things then kindly shut the hell up!

KeyGens|Cracks|Modified DLL's = HACKS! It's almost self-explanatory that it would show up on AV's due to their similarity to trojan coding else it wouldn't work! (IF you know the BASIC of the basics of cracked or modified applications then you should get the hint!)
