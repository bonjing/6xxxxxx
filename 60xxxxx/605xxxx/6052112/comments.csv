,xaleeeeeel,2011-06-16T05:41Z,to download this u need to waid 2 months at least
,Fuqthegovt,2011-07-25T13:03Z,"@piratas34 it's 22gb+ so no, it won't fit on a 16gb stick. Quit being cheap/poor and get a usb hdd.

@xaleeel there's seeds for pc games because,uh, they are left on the pc. Most people want to play their ps3 games after they dl them but don't have the space/bandwidth for 2 copies (1 on ps3 and 1 on pc). Especially when some games are 40-50GB each. Best bet is just copy rentals (gamefly, movie store,buy used/rip/resell, etc) if you have no patience for torrents or broken links at dl sites and don't want to get a newsgroup acct."
,Beowulf1211,2011-07-26T10:23Z,this torrent works perfectly. You'll have to directly send this game into ur ps3 HDD via FTP.....it will NOT work through external HDD and may even corrupt when you transfer it.
