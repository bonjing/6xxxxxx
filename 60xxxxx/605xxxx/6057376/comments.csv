,pezdispenser,2010-12-29T18:48Z,"I have DIVX Plus player with the newest codecs, and I have the direct show filter codecs and I still cannot get this to play.  I am getting the error ""This video is an unsopported format and cannot play without the directshow filters""  

Any suggestions?"
,pezdispenser,2010-12-29T18:50Z,"I meant, ""additional direct show filters,""I don't know which one I need.  I just installed 4.01"

Anyway thnx to the uploader..."
,khaled_br,2011-01-10T14:30Z,"THE QUALITY is super
the movie

fucking waster of time"
,autoclave,2011-01-15T02:12Z,"""It's a trap"" is in my opinion of much better quality than most of the episodes in season eight and nine. Not every joke hits you in the laughing muscle, but this film is definitely worth watching. There's lots of the classic family guy humor."
,Hyraxx,2011-01-17T19:52Z,Amazing quality video.
,Bshroom,2011-01-21T19:04Z,"Oh, I thought this was some highly dubious porn movie involving related transvestites. It's all right there in the title... :p"
