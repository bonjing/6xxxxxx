Michael Reynolds is fleeing the police in Hungary, near the Austrian border. Indeed he was commissioned by colonel Peter Mackintosh to reach a certain Jennings in Budapest before the forthcoming International Scientific Conference. When the police eventually catch Reynolds, the latter claims that his name is Johann Buhl, businessman and resident of Vienna and that he was invited to Hungary by the Economic Ministry. Subsequently, he is taken to the Andrassy Ut, headquarters of the AVO, the Hungarian Secret Police by Colonel SzendrÃ´. But Reynolds knows that no one has ever escaped from the AVO Headqquarters, from the torture chambers in Stalin Street. If he is ever to escape, it will have to be from inside SzendrÃ´'s car within the next hour.
