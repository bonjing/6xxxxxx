,michaelrwatson,2010-12-22T21:43Z,"WARNING: THIS IS CRAP!!!!!! Like most (or possibly all) of the R5's, it is missing words/partial sentences on a regular basis. Apparently they were cut out so the remaining audio could be synced.  I spent hours downloading this last nite, and it is unwatchable. The first i noticed is after Chris Pine meets Denzel, and an older guy says~ ""we don't like working at a day care center"" or whatever. Most of Chris Pine's reply is cut out.  There are plenty more cut-outs after that,  and i turned it off. 

FUCK YOU TiMKY (and other dumbfucks) for releasing this garbage. The old cams were actually better because they didn't have audio cut out periodically. WTF. "

,notherdaysgoneby,2010-12-24T16:21Z,"I downloaded this cuz I knew it wouldn't take me long with all the seeders. I got it in maybe an hour. I 1st read what michaelrwatson said but figured Id see for myself. I have no idea what michaelrwatson is talking about. The audio is 100% fine from what I see and hear. Maybe something went wrong in his download process or he has bad codecs or something, but nothing is cut and it all lines up for me. I'd give the Audio a 10 and a 10 for video."
