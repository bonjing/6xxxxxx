,shidX,2010-12-20T06:09Z,"Thank you HD-R-US! I love all your work! 

Look like you're the only one around can do Bluray HD quality into DVD5. Hope to see more uploads from you. 

Happy Holidays to you and your love ones! :)"
,Dulasync,2010-12-20T07:55Z,"Thanks a lot.
Merry X'mas"
,pc_nerd,2010-12-22T11:30Z,May I ask what Bluray disc image builder you use? I've tried three and they all don't work.
,fuctup.rm,2010-12-22T16:44Z,"I would just like to say that you have quickly become my go-to uploader. Consistently excellent quality and file sizes that suit my storage budget! Thanks so much for the great work you're putting in. 

I was saddened when the PS3 Team fizzled out, even though they're quality was a bit iffy. I don't know if "
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-22T18:36Z,"@richkid290 - You're always welcome - enjoy.

@shidx - And to you too - thank you!

@Dukasync - Cheers, Merry Christmas!

@pc_nerd - Albeit very similar, our disk images have AVCHD file/folder structure, not blu-ray. They are built with ImgBurn, but any application that is capable of UDF Revision 2.50 should work without issue. By the way, thank you for your kind words on some of our other release pages.

@fuctip.rm - Much appreciated, and you're welcome.

Happy Holidays, everyone."
,PirateXiro,2010-12-23T04:38Z,Is it safe to say that every Sony film you put out has Cinavia or do you have a way of taking it off? Love your torrents by the way. They are amazing quality!
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-23T06:17Z,"@PirateXiro - Cheers, glad that you're enjoying them. When Sony add the Cinavia watermark to their movies, which is pretty much across the board now, it will be apparent on any version that you download, because it isn't removable by re-encoding at this moment in time unfortunately."
,pc_nerd,2010-12-23T08:02Z,You are da bomb HD-R-US
,vanDAN21,2010-12-23T20:20Z,"Wats up HD-R-US.. ive been d/l ur movies for the past week or so. i have toast titanium 10 for mac, but everytime i stream most movies pixalate and kinda freeze up.. do you have any advice?"
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-23T21:14Z,"Hi, vanDAN21. Sorry, I have no experience of Toast, but isn't it CD/DVD burning software? I ask, because you mentioned streaming. If a video is blocky and/or freezes when streaming, it's usually because the network isn't fast enough to handle the speed of data transfer required. A way of testing this is pausing the movie for a few minutes, allowing it to buffer a little, then if it plays okay for a few seconds or longer before freezing again, it's definitely your network speed. I hope this helps, and Happy Holidays."
,vanDAN21,2010-12-23T23:21Z,"yeah, toast titanium is for burning but it also comes with a media player for mt2's. its not all movies just one or two.. i kinda thought that  but i wanted know from someone that knows what there talking about. thanx for the quick answer and the great uploads.. 
happy holidays to u too"
,windscale,2010-12-28T07:07Z,"vanDAN21 use VLC to play the file on the mac, it handles just about any file format and can be used to stream it across your network as well as locally. The web address is videolan.org"
,crpearso,2010-12-29T01:01Z,"Hey HD-R-US, What program are you using to make these? Handbrake sucks ass.

I know it requires a BluRay disc drive in your PC which I have. Thanks "
,SupremeClientele,2011-01-08T03:59Z,"you are the best source for high quality iso's that I want to burn to blu ray, thanks for hard work with providing this"
,x-stylez529,2011-01-13T23:18Z,"hey heads up, theres a website tracking this. great upload but after 30 minutes the audio goes out. i tried it on the ps3. but overall great upload"
,aaditadl22,2011-01-14T18:10Z,"HD-R-US, Firstly i'd like to thank you for this movie and the many others in remarkable quality!
But i burned the file onto a 4.7GB disc and played it on my PS3 it worked fine for 10 mins or so but then the audio went mute and there was a message :
â€œAudio outputs temporarily muted. Do not adjust the playback volume. The content being played is protected by Cinaviaâ„¢ 
and is not authorized for playback on this device. For more information, see http://www.cinavia.com. Message Code 3.â€
and the audio did not work after that unless i restarted the movie but then too it went mute again in while...
please let me know if there is any way to tackle this solution
thanks :)"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-14T21:04Z,"aaditadl22 - unfortunately, Cinavia Protection is impossible to remove by re-encoding at this moment in time.

Try this: www youtube com/watch?v=2Htgh9L87XY  (replace the spaces with periods)."
,patch5252,2011-01-15T14:39Z,"thanks for the upload.. 1 question, i've bein downloading for awhile but just bein watching them on my laptop, now i've got myself 40"" hdtv and a media player now my problem is i've downloaded a few highres movies they'll copy to my media player from laptop but then when i hook up my media player to the flatscreen there is no highres movie to be found my normal movies will play can some1 give me advice please of what to download and how to set it up thanks"
,aaditadl22,2011-01-17T17:00Z,"Yes sony sucks for adding cinavia...
but does this mean that all my Dvdrips wont work on my ps3? :O"
,Scopse,2011-01-19T01:22Z,"Thanks for all the effort you're putting in! And please do keep up the good work, it's appreciated more than you know."
,Scopse,2011-01-19T13:51Z,"Hey HD-R US I'm having a bit of trouble with writing to a disc, just wondered if you could shed some light on what may be going wrong.

I follow the instructions of click 'Write files/folders to disc' but then when it comes to add BDMV and Certificates folder, I navigate to where the movie .iso has been saved from imgburn and the only file I can see is the .iso itself with the other folders such as subtitles and the instruction text file, no certificates though. So then I just tried to copy my first disc, imgburn said something about hot it looked like I was trying to create an image instead of building something so I carried on ignoring that (Ididn't burn an image of the iso) it wanted to assign a drive letter for whatever reason and then it started to burn.

So with the disc burnt, I popped it into my PS3 and the disc shows up, however it says 'There are no titles'.

Please excuse me for going full retard on you, hopefully you know where I've gone wrong.

Thanks again!"
,Scopse,2011-01-19T14:18Z,"Okay ignore my last post,

it totally worked if I just click 'Write image file to disc', it shows up on my PS3 and plays fine.

I'd just like to add, the quality is absolutely mind blowing! Totally unreal considering it's burnt to a normal DVD.

5.1 Dolby Surround aswell, totally unreal dude! I'm amazed."
,CRimsonEagleX,2011-01-23T21:01Z,"Hello, thank you so much for this. It's great. I don't know where to request but if you could rip Saw VI when it comes out that would be greatly appreciated. If this is the wrong place to put requests I'm sorry! Thanks again!"
,HighDefUp,2011-01-31T18:59Z,I have an Ubuntu linux computer and something is missing from my configuration to play your ISOs Could you tell me what I have to do or download to get these working? I mount the ISO and it shows nothing in it. So I tried burning it to a DVD and it still wouldn't work with either my computer's DVD player or my TV. You're the only one who has uploaded many of these in 1080p. Good job! I only wish I could play them...
,amin_parazit,2011-02-24T01:45Z,"real nice threat but i just have 1 question
so alot of bluray 1080p movies are about 9gb these days
but looks like they have the same resolution!!
so what is the diffrence between the 2?
one 4gb and one 9gb but same quality?"
,FoNikko,2011-11-01T09:44Z,"Awesome !
BTW can I play this from the PS3 without any problems?"
