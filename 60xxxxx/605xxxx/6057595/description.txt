you will not see the difference in sound untill after the install

this is version kronictokr_noob_ubuntu_64_bit_desktop_karmic_1.0.2

the only dif between this and the original ubuntu karmic 9.10 , is that it comes with the restricted drivers already installed, the sound issues should be fixed on most systems.
java and flash are working.
installed well as vlc, k3b, and amsn.
removed tomboy notes and brasero, as well as totem.

install method is the same a regular ubuntu installation, only that when the disk boots (at the black screen with a list of options), you will have to just hit enter to initialise the regular install process. after which you can follow a tutorial to easily install the os.

heres a good video tut
