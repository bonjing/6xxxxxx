E-Play is a very cool Serbian band from Belgrade. They play what I might describe as shoe-gazing electro-punk. If you know Serbian/ex-Yugoslavian rock, they might remind you a bit of Ekatarina Velika (a.k.a. EKV). Check out their videos on YouTube if you want to see if you would like them or not... 

This torrent includes all 3 of their albums: E-Play (2000), Crime (2005) and Drago mi je da smo se upoznali (2009), meaning Nice to meet you. Also I have included a few extra songs like remixes, as well as a cover of the song Zemlja for an EKV tribute album which was done by a Serbian super-group, Crni Zub i Nova Mocna Organizacija, which includes members of E-Play among others.

As always, if you like them and have a means to support them, then buy their CDs and songs and go see them play live.
