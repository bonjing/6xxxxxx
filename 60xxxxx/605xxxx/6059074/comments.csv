My Dog Tulip is an American independent animated feature film directed and animated by Paul Fierlinger. His wife, Sandra Fierlinger, painted the backgrounds and characters.
It is based on the 1956 book by J. R. Ackerley, which tells the story of his relationship with his German Shepherd Dog. Somewhat unusually for animated features, the film is geared toward the ""adult sensibility"" rather than children.
Excellent animation and Excellent voice casting and is well worth the download...
Many Thanx to .BONE. for the Great download and Thanx to all the seeders for quick download...:)"

,scottielass,2010-12-23T16:19Z,"Well, after downloading this I had to watch it right away, late as it was -- it's a truly wonderful tale and will appeal to anyone who has experienced the bond between a dog and a human -- and the animation style is perfect for an adult movie. Bravo and thank you again."
