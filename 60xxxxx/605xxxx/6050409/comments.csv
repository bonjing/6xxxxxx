[V],twentyforty,2010-12-19T08:48Z,"Thanks. A week of encoding. And finding (some titles are so obscure and can be found only in internet-archives). Three days of upping (on server). Semi-seriously: That's why I don't take any bragging too well.

@azrielle: Maybe you haven't read my response to you:
""> twentyforty at 2010-12-17 09:59 CET: 
@azrielle: In fact, it's good. Stupid me downloaded Taste - oh... what a piece of shit. Whole 1.37 GB is junk, with thousands of skipped frames and that makes video so 'jerky' to unwatchable level. It is most likely TV rip, and I have encoded 272p from that garbage (you cannot reconstruct something missing /skipped frames/ from the source.

I would, no matter what, put that in next 272p pack, shitty as is.""

Movie must be good, Cheryl is in - but - I haven't watched it. Maybe I did before, on TV, it looks familiar.

Gauntlet has anthological, most funniest scene that keeps pondering in many occasions (farting scene).

@htctouch: I would seed till Xmas night.

thanks brother..."
,r-0987,2010-12-19T11:35Z,Thanks for most of these movies! This is like a great xmas present! have a great holiday and merry christmas!!
,ArtieT,2010-12-19T13:25Z,"Thanks again for your truly fine work! This isn't a request, but on Christmas eve, the BBC are showing a remake of the classic Christmas ghost story 'whistle and I'll come to you' with the great John Hurt. I advise anyone interested to also check out the original 1968 version with the great Michael Hordern. You can get it from one of the free UK TV archive sites (thebox.bz or uknova.com). Check out the others too, 'A Warning To The Curious' in particular is one of the best things ever made on TV. 

All the best and Happy Christmas!

It's still worth checking out those archive sites though (keep trying if you can't sign up atm)
