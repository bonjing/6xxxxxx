If you can find this version of "For those about to rock" you're in good company, because the brownish gold cover is identical to the copy on vinyl that I own, which means it's among the initial pressings.
With Back in Black, AC/DC raised the bar so high that no one could top it, not even themselves. The only way you're not going to like For Those About to Rock is if you compare it to Back in Black, which is understandable, but for me personally I enjoy the album to the same extent as Back In Black. 

The title track was inspired by a the saying "For those about to die, we salute you" and the band simply changed a word. The song features cannon noises which build up for a grand finale. It is a concert staple, and justifiably so, but there's plenty more noteworthy tunes, among them are the verse-riff tandem of "Inject the venom", the relentless rocking of "Snowballed", "Night of the long knives" had a Back in Black-style groove, "Breaking the rules" is an anthemic, semi-bounce track. I recommend "For those about to Rock" wholeheartedly.
