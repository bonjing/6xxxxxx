,muzzthegreat,2011-12-29T07:50Z,"NO GOOD : it installs fine.
Then on  First Run  is says “please wait while Windows configures Phoenix service software” and the pop up demands “Phoenix service software.msi” in some Temp Folder. [\LOCALS~1\Temp\is-HBVTK.tmp\]
I have checked – there is no such file on my system [plenty of other MSIs but not this one].
And there is No such Temp folder under Local settings\Temp\

Hangs at that point, Never Completes configuring, never completes the First Run."
