How To Use Phoenix Service Software To Update Your Nokia Phone With The Latest
Firmware.
Things to be kept in mind before installing Phoenix Service Software:

1. Do not connect your phone before installing Phoenix software.

2. Now ensure you have no antivirus software or any other software
running on your pc or in the system tray while you are using
Phoenix. You should turn them off while using Phoenix. Make sure
your system hasnt got any hanging problem.

3. Turn off your screensaver.

4. Charge your phone battery to at least 50%. Although flashing
takes only 8-9 minutes.
Installing Phoenix Service Software 2010:

If you have older version of Phoenix, no need to uninstall it. This
latest version will automatically replace it.

1. Install the software. Be patient, it may take some minutes to install
all the components.

4. Dont run Phoenix software now.

5. Connect your Nokia handset to your pc with USB cable in PC
Suite mode.

6. Windows will start installing the connectivity drivers as soon as
you connect the phone. Let it install completely.
Installing Firmware Files From The Offline Package You Downloaded:

1. If your firmware file is in .rar format, first extract it using WinRar on
desktop.

2. On desktop you will find .exe file of your firmware file.

3. Install the exe file. It will install it to default location of C:\Program
files\Nokia\Phoenix\Products\

4. Be sure you install updated firmware. You cannot downgrade your
phones firmware in BB5 phones which includes all new Nokia
phones including N-Series.

5. Phoenix allows downgrading but your phone doesnt allow it as your phone has some special security built into it. 
So no use of trying it. Youll get an error message.

6. You can reinstall your current firmware also if you have its
package. It is supported. It can also sometimes solve little issues.
