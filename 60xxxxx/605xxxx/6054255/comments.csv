I actually cant even Alt+Tab to get to the desktop or Task Manager. Ive installed all the latest drivers (Direct X and Nvidia GForce 9500 GT) and still NOTHING. Ive even installed the no DVD fix from Gamecopy world, disabled my internet (network card) and my Anti-Virus/Firewall.

After starting it and getting the shitty black screen I HAVE to hard reboot the PC in order to get out of the shitty black screen.

WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyone got any idea what to do to get this DL to actually run???

Windows XP SP3 / Nvidia GF 9500 GT / latest EVERYTHING NEEDED!!!!"

I use Vista 64, I've already installed games this way, any tip?
I've already run it as administrator."
,Showstrength,2011-05-01T04:41Z,"Hey, I found a Solution:

Open setup.bat with your NOTEPAD, and erase these three lines:

TPTB.4.EVER.exe >nul
pause
cls

Now, save Setup.bat file, run it. Now the decompression will begin.

Done.

Hugs from Brazil."

,sahilrox,2012-01-25T11:21Z,"Working Well

NOT A FAKE GAME/RIP
Quality is great.

To Play :

1. Download The Game
2. Open The Downloaded Folder
3. Extract the zip file with 7z, Winrar To Any Folder
4. Open The Folder To where you have extracted
5. Run Setup.bat (Batch File) of size : 1.48kb
6. It opens a window saying Enjoy and stuff and then another window for TPTB Honours, Intros etc.
7. Just Hit Escape 
8. Now The Original Window(The One Which said Enjoy Game, TPTB) will now say ""Press Any Key""
9. Press Any Key
10. Wait for 10 Minutes For Rebiulding Until It Says : Done. Press Any Key To Continue 
11. Press Any Key.
12. Play From Desktop


For Those Showing xlive.dll not found, Download The Windows Games Live Client From Google and Play."
