Hoodoo Gurus (referred to as the Gurus by fans) are an Australian rock band, formed in Sydney in 1981, by the mainstay Dave Faulkner (songwriter, lead singer and guitarist) and later joined by Richard Grossman (bass), Mark Kingsmill (drums), and Brad Shepherd (guitar, vocals, harmonica). Their popularity peaked in the mid to late 1980s with albums Mars Needs Guitars!, Blow Your Cool! and Magnum Cum Louder.

Hoodoo Gurus had a string of acclaimed pop-rock singles including \"Leilani\" (1982), \"Tojo\" (1983), \"My Girl\" (1983), \"I Want You Back\" (1984), \"Bittersweet\", \"Like Wow - Wipeout!\", and \"What\'s My Scene?\". After touring the United States from 1984 onwards they gained popularity on the U.S. college rock circuit with singles \"Come Anytime\" (1989) reaching #1 and \"Miss Freelove \'69\" (1991) reaching #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. Gurusâ€™ biggest Australian hit single was their 1987 Top 3 hit song \"What\'s My Scene?\" or, as modified for the National Rugby League 2000s theme, \"That\'s My Team\".

Hoodoo Gurus\' iconic status on the Australian rock scene was acknowledged when they were inducted into the 2007 ARIA Hall of Fame. Their induction announcement stated that the Gurus were one of the most \"inventive, lyrically smart and exciting\" bands from Australia. From 1960s power pop, and wild garage punk to hard driving rock and funky psychedelic kitsch their music stood out from Sydney\'s Detroit-inspired bands.
