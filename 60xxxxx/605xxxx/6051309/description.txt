Golden Earring - Holy Holy Life [Hits A Go Go 1971].VOB



Very HQ very rare "Hits A Go Go" tv show promo performance. Golden Earring is the best known and internationally most succesful rock band to come out of The Netherlands. 

Founded in 1961, Golden Earring has been active for nearly 50 years non-stop. The current line-up has been together since 1970, which makes Golden Earring the world's longest surviving rock band, having been formed a year before The Rolling Stones. 

In 1961 in their home town of The Hague by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbour, Rinus Gerritsen, they were originally called The Tornados. The band's first line-up mainly played The Shadows covers. The name was changed to Golden Earrings (the 's' was dropped in 1969) when they discovered that The Tornados was already in use by another group.

Golden Earring's upcoming studio album will be recorded live at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London during spring 2011.

In the beginning of 1971, "Holy Holy Life" was a Golden Earring single release, which neither song on both sides was ever released on any albums (the B-side song was "Jessica"). "Holy Holy Life" is still played by the band today and was a hit in the Nederlands in February 1971.
