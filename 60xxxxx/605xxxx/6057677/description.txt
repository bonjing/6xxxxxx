Rated 4.5 out of 5 star by AllMusic Guide

An Old-Fashioned Christmas is a Christmas album from The Carpenters, released in 1984 after the death of singer/drummer Karen Carpenter.
The album project had its genesis in several unused tracks from the Carpenters\' previous Christmas album, 1978\'s Christmas Portrait. Richard Carpenter took these tracks and recorded new material around them, and this album was the end result. The album (in its original LP and cassette form) includes the slow version of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" (a faster version appeared on the Christmas Portrait album).
(wikipedia)

Their second Christmas album, with more of the soft sounds of the season, is made for mistletoe and someone you love.
