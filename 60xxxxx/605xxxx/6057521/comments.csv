,raindr0ps,2010-12-22T02:15Z,"Hey, mikelove. Well ain't I disappointed. I've never had any deeese, in fact, never heard of it and so was really looking forward to trying it out. Now you tell me this was really CHEESE? Boy, what a ripoff. Bait and switch.

Thanks, mikelove. I'm really looking forward to this pdf."

@raindr0ps - Might be worth reading existing posts first. ;)"
,raindr0ps,2010-12-22T21:46Z,"Sorry, mikelove. Thought you'd see the humor in my comment. Yeah, I knew it was a typo before I ever checked the details on this torrent, just thought I'd pull your leg a little. I d/l the cookbook and it looks nice. Sorry if you misinterpreted my comment. Thanks for the upload."
,raindr0ps,2010-12-22T21:56Z,"Wow, karlston. Lighten up a little. I actually read comments from torrents in which I DON'T even have an interest. I love comments. What's nice when you have a torrent that has several pages of comments. Some real interesting points of view show up. But, I do read all the comments of any torrent I DO plan on downloading. A little humor never hurts. The Christmas season must have everybody's nerves on edge. "
,raindr0ps,2010-12-22T22:15Z,"For anyone interested. If you're logged on, you can go to ""preferences"", select you torrent, and ""edit"" and correct any typos. 

For anyone else who might pick up this torrent after mikelove changes the title (should he decide to do so) and not know what the previous comments were all about, the original title of this torrent, with typo, was:
Cheese Greats - 675 Deeese Recipes.pdf 
I thougt it was funny, guess others didn't.

BTW, the first word of this torrent was ""Cheese"". Anybody who couldn't figure out what ""Deeese"" was supposed to be is an idiot. And anybody who doesn't realize that my initial comment was not all that serious is either an idiot or needs to loosen up a little, maybe both.

[T],mikelove,2010-12-23T10:02Z,"raindr0ps I saw the humor in your comment , and it was funny but i read your comment when i just woke up , i was too lazy to type, so i just wrote Its cheese . i tried to edit the torrent first but it wont save the changes. that why i left it like that. And now its not worth changing , since i got a lot of comments with the spelling mistake. Its Christmas season , relax everyone.
i'm getting a day in bed for chirstmas , so i'm happy.Just imagine what you can do in bed with life partner in bed for the whole day. Yahoooo!!!!"
