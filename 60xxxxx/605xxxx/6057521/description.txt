There is an excellent recipe for Basil Cheese Torta with Red Bell Pepper Strips and Pine Nut and a wonderful White Chocolate Mousse Cheesecake with Sun-Dried Cherries. My favorite Cheese dishes are the slightly sweet ones like Strawberry Cheesecake with Pecan - Gingersnap Crust. There is also a wonderful Lasagna with Spinach, Wild Mushrooms and Three Cheeses. There is also a really nice Buffalo Chicken Wings with Blue Cheese Dipping Sauce which are very easy to make yourself.

This book will also give you enough inspiration to experiment with different ingredients since you'll find the extensive index to be extremely helpful.

The recipes are superb. Wonderfully easy to put together and you don't have to make or purchase a ton of condiments before you have a chance to play with them.
