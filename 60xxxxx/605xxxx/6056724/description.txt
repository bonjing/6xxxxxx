The Lizard King by Bryan Christy

The story of a reptile smuggler and his encounters through his criminal career. Also a very good insight into the reptile trade.

Bought this book in the US and had it transcribed for me into audio. Unfortunately different readers but most are OK. But still very difficult to get hold of in the UK, so enjoy!  

Will upload more soon!
