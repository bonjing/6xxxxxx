The young Scot's second LP takes quite a leap on from the first as they embrace weighty songs like 'Vandy Vandy' and Abigail Washington's 'Sugar and Pie' alongside bluegrass, QuÃ©becois, Americana and more familiar excusions into dance tunes. Three different singers expand their horizons and enhance a reputation already high from thier debut.
