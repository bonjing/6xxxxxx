          Jim Henson, Frank Oz and Michael Frith are

          Little is known about this interview, and we have          
        hardly been able to find any references to it online,        
        not even from the most dependable of sources. What           
        we do know however, from a historical context, is            
        that in 1990, Disney and Henson were finalizing a            
        merger. Jim wanted to spend more time on his creative        
        projects and less time managing a company, and Disney        
        had certainly been showing a keen interest for some          
        time. Quite a change from almost a decade before,            
        when Disney had been in financial trouble, unable            
        to live up to their earlier success, and Jim and             
        his life-long agent Bernie Brillstein were in                
        discussions to buy Disney! This would really have            
        turned around the then long-lived misconception that         
        Disney owned The Muppets (which since 2004 is actually       
        true), but eventually fell through for several               
        reasons, among them that Jim was not willing to              
        surrender control of Sesame Street to Disney.                
                                                                     
          In 1989-90, under new management of Michael Eisner,        
        the deal looked very much set to happen, though the          
        other way around. Many collaborations were produced          
        and planned, and it was widely believed that had Jim         
        not died in the middle of negotiations, the deal would       
        have gone through, and the Henson company would cease        
        to exist in any of its many incarnations. It's hard          
        to say what effect this would have had on either             
        company, but suffice to say it would have impacted           
        Muppets, Fraggles and the rest of the Muppet universe        
        in a very big way.                                           
                                                                     
          This interview, which appears to have been an              
        internal production copyrighted in 1990, must have           
        been only months before Jim's death, and in the              
        middle of their negotiations. Its exact purpose is           
        unclear, but one might speculate it was perhaps              
        made to introduce key Henson staff to internals at           
        Disney. Jim and Frank should be familiar names by            
        now, and Michael K. Frith was at the time their              
        creative director after a long career of designing           
        Muppets and other creatures. Where Don Sahlin both           
        designed and built Muppets, Michael was always               
        content letting others do the building. After                
        leaving Henson in 1996, he's stayed with puppetry,           
        and like Craig Shemin married a Muppeteer (Kathryn           
        Mullen, performer of Mokey Fraggle, Kira in The              
        Dark Crystal and many others).

                 For the month of December we've decided to     
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            
                                                              
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    
         you new titles from the archives, including    
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    
      and behind the scenes footage, from every    
          type of source available to us. Our goal       
        is to provide real insight into the vast      
     output of one of the greatest story-         
     tellers of the 20th century, and the        
           many talented performers and enablers      
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.
