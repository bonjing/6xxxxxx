Neoclassical, Trance


Another very solid independent release by RIGHT STUFF, lots of blending between classical instruments, melodies, and modern synthesizers. One of those sophistimicated albums that is difficult to explain its structure and composition, yet incredibly moving and fulfilling upon listening through it. I find the album to be greatly enjoyable -- one worthy of stashing in the permanent library. 

Highlights for myself are Tosh's rendition of Adagio for Strings (My favorite now, seconded by Armin Van Burren's and Tiesto's [Tiesto *blech*] renditions), and Grass Court - even if it is simplistic, it can put me into a trance laying on my bed with some headphones on. That said, the whole album is very well done, and as a hidden treasure of an album, I hope this torrent can help bring greater recognition to the greatness that is RIGHT STUFF.

01. AQUA - infinity
02. Discode Requiem - takehiro
03. Grass Court - MAYA AKAI
04. Op.57??? - Lucifer
05. Adagio For Strings - Tosh
06. Fantasma - Karasu
07. Dihydrogen Monoxide - Lucifer

RIGHT STUFF are an amazing independent studio, they actually are a company worth supporting. Buy their CDs so they can make more cutting-edge music.

Enjoy.
