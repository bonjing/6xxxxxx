STORY
A virtual-world worker looks to take down the Master Control Program.

Video: 720x304 @bitrate 1600 2pass
Audio: AC3 2.0 Stereo

CM8 NOTES
Source:
TRON Legacy 2010 TS XViD-IMAGiNE
thx Imagine for this great early and synced release, i know its hard to cam such a dark movie in this quality

Encode:
like always i try to make even a good release better. i noticed bit too much brightness which results in noise and grain in the video.
More brightness is good so you can see a bit more details in the picture, but the side effect is noise and grain.
it doesnt look too good on my tv, so i tried to reduce brightness and condensate with contrast and added a noise filter for the grain along with chroma. The result looks better to me. 

please check comparison below

So what you see is what you get, you loose a bit brightness but gain a clearer picture and quality.

For the Audio, well cleaned it up too, removed noise,hiss,hum and some scratches, cant do anything about the slight metallic voices here and there. all in all watchable

credit CM8 & Hive & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
