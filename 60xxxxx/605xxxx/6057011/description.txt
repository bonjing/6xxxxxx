 This Ultra Rare 1976 Production by Florida filmmaker William Grefe' is about a 

man named Sonny who discovers that he has a mystical connection with sharks, and 

is given a strange medallion by a shaman after the sharks spare him and attack the

bandits trying to kill him. Back in Florida Sonny becomes more and more alienated 

from normal society, and sets out to destroy anybody who harms sharks and to gain 

revenge on anybody who double crosses him.


  This DVD was created with the best source I could find of "Jaws Of Death" and 

made into a high quality file. 

  I also added the "Theatrical Trailer" and an "Image Gallery" with poster and box 

art from different countries.


I hope that everyone will enjoy this endevor.
