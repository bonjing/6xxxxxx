El Cochecito aka The Little Coach (1960)


El Cochecito is a 1960 Spanish black comedy film directed by Marco Ferreri.

The film is based on Rafael Azcona's novel who co-wrote the script with Ferreri.

In the film, all of the friends of Anselmo (Pepe Isbert, a genius) have their own disabled-adapted little cars, they go anywhere they want: to the main square, to the country... Anselmo's on his own, and he feels lonely. No way! He decides he also wants one of those cars (doesn't matter if he's not a disabled person) and he'll do ANYTHING to get one: to pretend he's been left paralyzed, to steal... WHATEVER it takes.

The film was a huge flop when it was released in Spain, but nowadays is a cult classic. The film had troubles with Spanish censorship, that forced to change and cut the original ending.

This rip was taken from KG. Thanks to pa6sur, the original uploader on KG. The torrent contains also some posters of the film and spanish and english subtitles.

IMDB: 7.5/10
