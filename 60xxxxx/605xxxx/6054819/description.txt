A true Swiss Army knife for troubleshooting and solving most computer problems.

Better than UBCD, better than Hiren's CD ...

Bootable ISO.

Language: English

All you need to do is burn the ISO image to a CD, insert it into the computer's CD-ROM drive and reboot the computer.

If not done already, enter the PC's BIOS, set it to boot from CD.

A fully-functional WinPE (Windows Pre-Installation Env., based on Windows XP SP2) + Linux (Slax-6-RC6) live CD ISO.

Comes with:

AdAware SE + McAfee AV + ClamAV + SpywareDoctor
Windows Explorer, SmartDriverBackup, PCITREE, FoxIt PDF Reader, FileZilla FTP Client, Ghost 8, UltraVNC, Partition Magic 8, CHNTPW (Vista-compatible), WIPECMOS, MEMTEST, the IBM/Seagate/WD hdrive diagnostics, etc. SATA compatible.

There's now a procedure to transfer HawkPE to a USB thumb drive and make it bootable, along with other additions to the HawkPE-changes and readme-HawkPE text files.

Slax is an excellent example of a portable Linux, which comes with Firefox + Flash, KDE's KOffice suite, multimedia goodies, and the latest K3B CD/DVD burning application. So with a USB thumb drive and your HawkPE CD/DVD, you can carry a multimedia-enabled rescue computer system, with you at all times. Enjoy....
