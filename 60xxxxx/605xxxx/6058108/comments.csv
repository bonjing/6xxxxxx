,browniecoyote,2010-12-23T11:06Z,Hey gr8 quality torrent..dis is da fst time i downloaded ur torrent..a/v=10..Hey actually i hv a doubt dat how ur rips will look on Full hd 32 inch lcd.. currently m having 19 inch lcd..plz let me knw..thxs fr the upload and gr8 effort..
[V],prashant22,2010-12-23T11:47Z,"@browniecoyote
dont know abt 32""..i only hv a 21""...bt ya the ones with more than 1gb size will surely look good on 32""...

@all
if anyone here has a 32"" and hv seen my rips on that plz share ur thoughts....

akindayimcan i think u hv one plz tell how do they look..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-23T11:52Z,"@browniecoyote

or if u use KMplayer then open the movie right click go to pan&scan -> presets -> zoom to ultra widescreen...

if u use media playerclassic then go to view -> pan&scan -> zoom to ultra widescreen...

this will give u an idea how will the rips look on a bigger screen..."
,akindayimcan,2010-12-23T14:31Z,"i am pleased about your rips on my 37"" outside of a few movies...
so you encoded 84 rips and i have 72 of them...i didnt take top quality from 4 or 5 rips... and the town didnt finished yet...
so i am sure ""browniecoyote"" will get superb quality on 32""..."
,r-0987,2010-12-23T14:51Z,"This looks AWESOME on a 42"" tv!"
,r-0987,2010-12-23T15:19Z,i wanted to ask every1 for a good ripping software? my friend has some good movies in dvd & i wanted to save them on my computer!
[V],prashant22,2010-12-23T15:28Z,"@akind

Any plan to encode ""The social network"" in near future?
And why didt you encode the extended version of The Town? Extended version is 30 min longer than this. Any reason?"
