This is an amazing group of ladies with talents
that far exceed anything you'll ever see on crap
shows like xfactor or idol or whatever the f**k
they're called. And yes - even the wonder woman
from the center of the earth (aka "The Beast From
The North", "The Loch Ness Soprano", and "The Gremlin
of GooTube").

Boyle can't hold a candle to them and what they bring
to a show.

Celtic Woman perform over an hour's worth of
traditional, classical, and popular Christmas
songs to delight the whole family.

the imdb link doesn't give much information, so
go to celticwoman.com for details.

this is my own dvd rip and encode.
samples were ripped separately for fun.
