,dark_defender,2010-12-20T14:00Z,"Hi 20 40,
Thanks so much for the encode/upload. I hope you would do Brrip of 720p when its out rather than a DVDrip.
@DSIN: Its Darren Aronofsky. It ought to be awesome/spine chilling."
,YuiSnape,2010-12-20T14:23Z,"@mininova_org: He does post screenies, they're in the torrent, and you can DL individual files from a torrent. All quite convenient."
,dark_defender,2010-12-20T14:30Z,"20-40, can i put my request now or after xmas?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T14:51Z,"@mininova_org: Screens CANNOT be posted. They're too heavy and too big, even flat ones.
Moreover, CRT screens consume more - energy. As you just have."
,Fangular,2010-12-20T15:09Z,This is exciting - thanks 2040!
,DJkid90,2010-12-20T16:40Z,"Hi 20-40!!!

""@ALL: All ""hidden"" and ""openly"" placed requests are encoded. 272p ones would be upped (90% is on server right now) few hours from now.

Other ones - you cannot see/find inside that torrent - are either BluRay or HDTV encodings and would be upped as separate torrent in next couple of days.

So - ANY FURTHER REQUEST WOULD BE IGNORED - and be nice and show respect not just to me, but to all good people around.""


In short - requests would be considered AFTER the Christmas-New Year holidays. (6th. of January)."
,dark_defender,2010-12-20T17:46Z,"@20-40: Copy that.

Can anyone please give me the link to ""Machete"" encoded(best available) by 20-40?"
,spiritualiste,2010-12-20T18:26Z,"Many thanks for sharing your work...
Live Long and Prosper...

@ ALL - Please login and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents from 20/40. 
It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Be Cool !"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T19:07Z,"@dark_defender: ONLY standalone torrent is

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5846155/Machete.R5.LINE.320p.H264

Other encodes were placed inside Movie Packs.

On top of the page you have Search. Wrote down what you looking for, for example

machete+h264

and you can find torrents by yourself.

However, feel free to download encodings from others, this one was R5, ""dead"" torrent by now but if you wanna save few cents (roughly 350 MB) keep'm loaded and I would seed a little, probably three hours from now.
I can seed maybe one hour long )enough for hundred of movies of that size), so better be fast - or let me know."
