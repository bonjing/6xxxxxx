"In 1984, a serial killer was on the loose in Florida. Eight women had been found dead. At each crime scene, investigators found tiny red fibers, fibers they hoped would lead them to the killer."

Ripped from an old VHS tape, so the quality is not superb, but okay.

Warning: Some disturbing images of dead women.




Enjoy!
