this is my fanedit of FWWM  it begins  with Leland & Teresa in motel and then cuts to the agents aressting the people on the bus and  with many edits and creative license it ends with Laura Palmers body being found wrapped in plastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,theres no mention in my edit of Leland being possessed and theres no Moira Kelly as Donna since Lara Flynn plays the role......enjoy
