,Proview.pt,2011-04-09T16:54Z,hey is this for galatic adventures or jusy regular spore?
,Proview.pt,2011-04-10T00:52Z,"wtf??? 

just finished downloading this and i must say THIS TORRENT SUCKS!!

this is just the same as the other ones!!

PEOPLE DONT DOWNLOAD THIS, THIS IS JUST FOR REGULAR SPORE, NOT THE GALATIC ADVENTURES ONE SO THIS TORRENT IS USELESS!!!!"
,Proview.pt,2011-04-10T00:55Z,GOD FUCKING DAMNIT WHY THERES NOT A CRACK FOR 1.51 FOR GALATIC ADVENTURES!!!! 3 YEARS HAVE PAST AND STILL NO CRACK!
,Mazerpwn,2011-05-24T21:43Z,"Actually the ""Robo Parts pack"" was part of a Dr. Pepper promotion...The only way to get it now is to look for the Dr.Pepper Promotional update (i believe it's for v4) 
Good luck finding a crack for it Dx (if you can find it)"
,Mazerpwn,2011-05-24T21:46Z,"Oh and it's an American only thing (unless during the event you were in America and bought a Dr.Pepper than you'd be able to use it's code to download it)

Also Spiedey the reason you probably haven't heard of it is it's unofficial >< sad isn't it?"
,Mafia200100,2011-05-28T19:37Z,"This works perfectly, except for one problem.

After installing this and using the crack, all the random names come up as 'BAD_DATA'. This includes all the planet names in Space Stage. I'm not sure if it's a problem at my end or not, so I'm going to try re-downloading and see if it works."
,Mafia200100,2011-05-28T19:45Z,"Checked it and re-downloaded etc.

Still doing the whole 'BAD_DATA' thing...

Help?"
,Grave45,2011-06-01T19:45Z,Works like a charm! Thanks for upload
,LordMerkadis,2011-06-02T12:59Z,"For those generations after me who will want to download this pain in ass of a game heed my words and be enlightened:

1. Install Clean v1.0 Spore
2. Install patch v1.5.1
3. Install patch v1.6
4. Install creepy and cute mod
5. install Galactic Adventures

6. WIN!

Found all of this out after i donated some good amount of my blood to this games altar.. Or in other words after god damn annoyingly long ass research, so you better be thankful bitches.

Tested on Vista x64 with gtx nvidia 8800
The problem was apparently in the v1.5.1 patch if u install this bitch on top of GA mod it messes it up making the animation static aka non-moving-shit. I couldn't bring myself to play static shit so i had to go researching p_p"
,TheBountyHunter,2011-08-02T03:01Z,"Hey guys,i've been searching high and low for Spore 1.6 crack (the robo pack one).Can anyone please tell me where to download it,or does it exists at all?

@LordMerkadis
1.Wouldn't installing patch 1.6 prior to Spore GA make GA installation impossible?
2.How do you run the game with 1.6 version(I presume without crack),I guess you bought the game or what?"
,w00ties,2011-08-23T18:01Z,"You can see all spore patches and download them here : http://games.softpedia.com/dyn-search.php?search_term=spore+patch&x=0&y=0

The spore website says about patch 5.2 : This patch must be installed again after installing Galactic Adventures, even if you have installed this patch previously.

So I'll try and see if it works installing the patch and cracking after installing GA."
,w00ties,2011-08-23T18:01Z,About patch 5.1 sorry. Not 5.2.
,abbaa,2011-09-15T06:48Z,"@Proview.pt

It's not the uploaders fault you can't read. where did it even say anything about galactic adventures?"
,Rewinded,2011-12-11T13:51Z,"i have a problem!
i downloaded it patched it put the crack where supposed to but when i run the game its the spore main menu without the planets or things. just a fullscreen 3D picture of the galaxy!
please help dont know what to do!!!"
