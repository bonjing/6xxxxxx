This is the Updated and complete Godsmack discography including all 5 
of their studio recordings as well as their EP release and their 
greatest hits album. Also included the video that came with the
greatest hits as a bonus. As it is often hard to find these in FLAC 
format I have put this collection together for your enjoyment.
