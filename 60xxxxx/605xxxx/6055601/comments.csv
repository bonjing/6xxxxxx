Thx for the upload anyway..."
,Mathlol,2010-12-26T03:52Z,"@TheChosen1 Yes, HD's rips are always good.  He  could, but doesn't need to put screens.  
Doesn't get any better than 5.7 Mbps @ 1080p for a dvd size :)"
,TheChosen1_,2010-12-26T13:52Z,"I wanna ask something too.Is the description true for the resolution 1920*1080?I downloaded and watched Inception.In Inception's description it was 1920*1080 too but there were too many black screen or band or whatever it is.I use MPC to watch all of my mkv movies.I dont think i do something wrong.Just dont understand why black screen too many even it is 1920*1080?

Thx for you advice btw..."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-26T17:28Z,"@Mathlol - thank you for the compliment. Glad you're enjoying them.

@TheChosen1_  - screen resolution is completely different to aspect ratio. For AVCHD to work and retain the correct aspect ratio, it has to be encoded in either full 1920x1080, or 1280x720 for 1080p and 720p respectively, hence why the black bars/letterbox you see are actually part of the video, where as the cropped MKV/blu-ray versions you will find for download still display the same black bars, but they are not part of the video itself. It's an old myth that cropping those black bars from a video makes the filesize smaller, and is simply untrue. I hope this helps."
,TheChosen1_,2010-12-26T18:22Z,"Thank you for your explanation HD-R-US.I respect you cuz there are many of people love ur works and you must be really good at that.I understand what you exactly meant but i havent tried ur rips on a LCD TV.For the last time I want something to know if you can answer.If i watch any of ur movies on a lcd, will I see black bars or not? 

Thx again..."
[T],HD-R-US,2010-12-26T20:28Z,"That depends on which aspect ratio the movie was filmed in, and the resolution of the screen you are watching it on, so it will vary. Most up-to-date TV's have an aspect ratio of 4:3, whilst most movies are filmed in 16:9, so at 4:3 on a 4:3 TV, you will see no or very little black, but at 16:9, you will see the letterbox effect, because a 1080p movie filmed at 16:9 is 1920 wide, but only around 800 high, so to see all of the movie's width, it will not fill a 4:3 screen's height of 1080, unless of course you zoom-in, which would mean losing some of the movie's picture, left and right. Probably this makes no sense, but I hope it does. =)

I'm off touring Europe for a couple of weeks now, so enjoy, and Happy Holidays."
