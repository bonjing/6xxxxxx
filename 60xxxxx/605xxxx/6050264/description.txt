It is a very difficult thing to say that any particular AC/DC album is their "best." They have so much high quality material. But suffice to say the Stiff Upper Lip delivers the hard-rocking' goods on every track, just like Highway to Hell, Back in Black, and High Voltage. It suffers from none of the muddy production problems that plagued their post-Mutt Lange albums, in fact it sounds better than any of their albums, in terms of production, except the remastered Back in Black. AC/DC's previous two albums (Razor's Edge & Ballbreaker), to me anyways, signifigantly improved over the majority of mid-late 80's material (Fly on the Wall, Blow Up Your Video), but SUL absolutely demolishes The Razor's Edge and Ballbreaker in terms of power, riffage, and Brian fixed-up vocals sound better than he has in a long, long time. Every song has that indefinable "timeless" rock sound that pours out from a lot of their late 70's material. Each song has you wondering "How can they not release this as a single?" Songs alternate between Back In Black evil rock (Safe in New York City, House of Jazz, Damned(my fav) and Powerage-style funky blues licks (Meltdown, Hold Me Back, Can't Stand Still). You absolutely cannot go wrong with record. Easily on par with your favorite AC/DC album, and easily better than the rest.
