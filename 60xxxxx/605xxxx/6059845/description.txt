Frontal Weather - Examines the practical aspects of safely operating in and around frontal weather. Avoids much of the technical data and instead, focuses on the real-world characteristics of fronts. Covers all types of fronts, interpreting forecasts and depictions, weather radar, Stormscope, flight planning tips, seasonal variations, the effects of atmospheric pressure changes and much more. Greatly expands on the fundamental weather information you received when first obtaining your pilot certificate.
