i think that everything must be posted in flac format  given that the price /GB isnt so expensive.

please post also the flac version of this album and if possible the flac version of all songs and albums that u will post in the internet, like here on piratebuy

i thank u in advnace"
,Thomps6o,2010-12-29T22:40Z,"thx alot, and thanks again just because its not in flac.... to the op -because alot of people cant use flac in their usb cd players, tvs, sound systems, etc the list goes on and on, and then i try to convert it to a useable file such as mp3, and soundforge and alot of other programs wont even recognize the flac so i can even convert. the only way i can use flac files is to just sit and record the whole album into mp3 using a microphone.

ya ya i know flac files are way better quality, but you know what cant use them in anything so 320 kbps is good enough for me!"

U know that -
Flac is about 1022 bitrate and mp3 @ 320 kbps are the best quality u can get right ???

But did u also know - 

HUMAN EARS CANT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLAC AND MP3 @ 320 KBPS...!"
