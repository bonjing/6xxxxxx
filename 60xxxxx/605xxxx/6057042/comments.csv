""Fred C. Dobbs and Bob Curtin, both down on their luck in Tampico, Mexico in 1925, meet up with a grizzled...Director: Martin Scorsese""

The director is John Huston. Martin Scorsese was  six years old when this film was made!

,azvampyre,2011-12-11T04:29Z,"I signed up just to say Muchas Gracias for a most excellent torrent.
I watched this years ago and could never remember what it was called, but I liked playing the Sierra Madre pack in Fallout:New Vegas since everytime I searched for the movie with keywords ""Sierra Madre"" only 4,000,000,000 hits came up, all for the game."
