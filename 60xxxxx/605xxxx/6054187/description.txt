Chief Inspector Maigret is a British cultured Frenchman of the greatest spirit.
His wife in the early episodes is played by the lovely Ms. Ciaran Madden - a much
more likely match for our Dear Chief Inspector than is the later picked Ms. Flynn
for the same role, in my own view in any event.

This beautiful series is set in Paris, France but with a mainly British cast
set amidst a French backdrop of lovely music and great picturesque settings
of French elegance.

Its a lovely idea of melding the two cultures perhaps, , however it really
wouldn't do in the end as both have unique appeal and are best off in their
own separate worlds as the British and the French weren't meant to meld in to
anything different from what each is - and thank goodness for that as the world
would be much impoverished without the two as they are - we'd feel desolate in
fact! Perhaps set in Berlin instead, one might be taken with the idea of a melting
pot here perhaps and with great benefit to both, no doubt, given enough time and
with the right actors employed in the task of finding new ground to patch
up any differences that might remain between the two strands of Germanic culture
in what is their ultimate choice or preference on matters of taste and wisdom
especially with regard to the finesse employed in articulating ieas.

Maigret with Michael Gambon is a lovely series with an interesting script
and I hope it will live forever, along with the spirit of this greatest of 
men - from France (rather than Germany - although he might just as well
be from there too - why not!) 
A 720p HD version will launch as soon as might be made available (I hope)!
