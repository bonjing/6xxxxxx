,hajimesaitou538,2010-12-21T22:43Z,"Whoa! Thanks, man. Now, I hope there is enough seeders."
,jettom,2010-12-21T23:07Z,"I'll be seeding for awhile once its done downloading, it went to 0.1% then I lost my download speed completely:P"
,jarrks,2010-12-22T00:41Z,"Well, I've been waiting for this, but somehow, I can't download the torrent. Always got ""No input file specified."""
,dark_wolf9741,2010-12-22T04:17Z,Yeah i cant download it...it cant find the page
,jettom,2010-12-22T10:27Z,"Magnet Link it:P

,mushy-senpai,2010-12-22T13:53Z,Seeding as it comes down... Hai jettom.
,hajimesaitou538,2010-12-22T21:13Z,"Hello again. Look, I don't have any problems sharing, but downloading at 5kbps, tops, and uploading at 60 kbps, seems a little unfair to me. Come on, I already upload 230mb of the barely 60mb that I download..."
,MousE0910,2010-12-22T23:30Z,"Sorry for slow download, I should be able to upload much faster after 25th December."
,mushy-senpai,2010-12-23T04:52Z,"@hajimesaitou538

Too many leeches. I've uploaded 3gb so far and I've only got 75% the movie."
,jettom,2010-12-23T15:46Z,"Uploaded 10.4 GB, will continue to seed this over the course of Xmas. Great movie by the way. Also, hi Mushy!"
,jarrks,2010-12-25T22:41Z,"Yeah, you need to use the MAGNET LINK. I had to upgrade my ktorrent to do it, because the old one couldn't handle them. Now I'm downloading at about 1MiB/s."
,KaitoTano,2011-01-01T23:46Z,"thanx a million for this i will seed too and this is my first time ever seeding anything ^_~

,extinctpj,2011-02-07T15:21Z,"Is anyone else having trouble with playback? It might just be me being an idiot, but the sound keeps cutting out and the video kind of lags a bit.

Any ideas? I've got the latest version of CCCP"
,jj00kk,2011-02-15T20:42Z,"Amazing torrent, quality and sound is top notch.  i was a little hesitant since it was a blueray rip at first but it works just fine on my laptop.

Definitely seeding."
,STorrents,2011-02-24T13:42Z,"For faster downloading, add serveral tiers, for example:

http://tracker.prq.to/announce

Made me download like 4 times faster :)"
,Death-Dude-72,2011-04-11T21:13Z,"Thanks, MousE. I'd download, but my laptop doesnt have a high enough resolution or enough proccessing power to run 1080P Video smoothly. Does anyone have a 720P version? "
,nick13oi,2011-10-24T20:31Z,"thanks alot, will seed :)"
,electricfate,2012-02-08T13:57Z,"This is fantastic quality, 10 out of 10.
It has both English and Czech subs as mentioned in the description.
The movie was amazing, I expected it to be really good but it was far better than I had imagined!
If you are thinking about watching this, make sure you watch the 2 seasons of the Anime first as it continues on from that.
Will be buying this when it becomes available where I come from...
Will be seeding, thankyou very much for this"
