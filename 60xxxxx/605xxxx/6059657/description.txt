FOREWORD:

First of all, a big SORRY to all of you who try to download the previous version of this torrent: 

X-WING_95_[XWING95][ISO][PC][Win7][x32x64-Tested][Tuzito] 
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6056914

I will explain quickly what happened: Before I can finish the initial upload and anyone can complete it, I do not know how, the files was updated/changed (or something like that), rendering the torrent file useless. I have no words to describe how frustrating can be for a newbie like me see your 1st upload die that way. Sorry again. Theme closed.

WHAT YOU NEED/HAVE BEFORE RUN? 
------------------------------
- For Vista/7 you only need a virtual drive prog (I recommend PowerISO), for mount the image and install.

- For other, depending on your OS, its possible you need some patches (like the MSI installer) so VISIT the Markus page AND READ VERY WELL ALL NOTES related. 

- You also can find detailed info (from MarkusEgger) on the ISO file "Instructions.html"

- YOU MUST HAVE a joystick/gamepad

- RECOMMENDED: Use OEM CD-ROM/image to run the game AFTER setup and config

- NOTE: The Flight Academy dont work at all.

- NOTE: Pilots files (.plt) from previous versions dont work with this.
