,Codykon,2011-09-24T21:51Z,"So I mount the image, get it installed, hit play x-wing, create a pilot and attempt to start a mission but then crashes to desktop. I am using vista 64bit SP2, any ideas?"
,Tuzito,2011-12-20T19:00Z,Codykon: you must set the configuration BEFORE 1st running the game; also you probably need the 3D patch included in the torrent and set it up before too. Please read the info files for the links for patches and forums. Have a nice day.
