,fredob23,2010-12-20T21:16Z,Subs are screwed up.
,QborT,2010-12-21T19:04Z,"Not sure how this got labeled as a BRRip?

Source: 720p.WEB-DL (.WMV)

That is why the subs are garbage, it's not an authentic rip.  The subs are autotranslated/fansubs"
,intoxicator,2011-02-02T04:15Z,What program do I use to get the subs to work?? When I stream the movie on my PS3 using Nero MediaHome it wont work? Is there a way for me to merge the .srt to the movie?

It's a BRRip, definitely beats dvd rips.
Great Korean movie with english subtitles..

Will continue seeding at 5 megabytes/sec!
Thanks .BONE.!"
,Affar2k,2011-02-15T15:53Z,"Well the size doesn't indicate it is a BRRip at all seeing how small the file is.

Nevertheless, thank you for the upload :)"

,mindhacker,2011-03-10T04:41Z,v8/a9/m9/subs6 but usable
,kostasbaleno,2011-04-01T17:10Z,Realy nice movie! Thnx .BONE.
,lucas_kelly,2011-07-09T07:10Z,The subtitles are fucking shit. A lot of it is missing or wrong.

@ doctorpink
Its a BRRip, that means it was ripped from a Blue Ray disk. It was Ripped to 1.54GB. It could of been ripped to something lower that does not mean its DVD its still a BRRip. Nowhere did it say it was HD. Its ripped to a smaller size so you can dl it quicker. Fucking idiot.

Great movie"

Video quality is very, very weak.
This is definitely not a BRRip.

Try StyLishSaLH version. It's x264 (much better than xvid), 334 MB only but has better quality than BAUM version!"

,deviltoy,2012-05-06T17:27Z,"Solid quality,which could be better if you rip it with x264 instead xvid,i understand compatibility issues,but if you are ripping blu ray it is sad to ruin quality with old xvid codec"
,Heavytoe53,2012-05-10T22:13Z,cool movie!
,DanZg,2012-06-21T23:20Z,Are subs hardcoded?
