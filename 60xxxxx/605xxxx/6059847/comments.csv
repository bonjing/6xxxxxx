,dlarrym1111,2010-12-23T06:02Z,"PLEASE tell me you are not one of these wacko's that thinks the Lunar landing was staged. If this was true, How is it that the Observatory in Chapell Hill  (part of DUKE UNIVERSITIES Physics School) Our class was able to bounce a argon Laser off a Mirror that was left on the moon. I have seen this occur before my very eyes. The moons surface, as bright as it may be, is no where NEAR reflective enough to get a Laser to bounce off of it and still get a strong reflection back. We even tried to do this by purposely aiming the telescope so it wasn't lined up with the mirror. 2ndly, Russia was monitoring all the activities NASA was doing during the Apollo moon missions hoping we would fail and they would be able to get there first. Having said that, The Russians were actually completely Honest and backed up the data NASA had. What does the Soviet Union have to gain by lying to the world and confirming from there own telemetry and PROVING that the USA did in-fact make it to the moon first. We Actually landed on the moon several more times  (7 or 8 more times). I have heard that one of the things stated by those who believe the MOON LANDING was faked, say that the Radition would have killedd or at least caused magor medical problems for the Astronauts. Well, THEY DID get injuries from the radiation. No one even contests that. Almost every astronaut that was involved in the APOLLO programs ended up suffering from CANCER several years after the landings. Almost all the cancers of these men were attributed to exposure to Radiation. LASTLY, NASA is planning to use the HUBBLE TELESCOPE and are going to AIM IT AT THE MOON and you can clearly see the ""space trash"" we left on the moon. Mainly the moon rover. (it was far to heavy to bring back after the almost 400 pounds of samples of rock they brought back). NASA agreed to do this before the retirement of the HUBBLE TELESCOPE in 2013. A newer telescope is being built as we speak. It will be the KEPLER Orbiting space telescope. It was projected to launch in 2011, but has been pushed back for various reasons. Hopefully this will get ALL THESE MORONS to SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!! I have family members that were involved in the SATURN V's Engine Development at a special research facility in Tennessee. If ALL the people that are into all these conspiracy theories spent as much energy in making your self some legit money or starting a business, you would be billionaires by now! DON'T Download unless you want to BRAND yourself as complete FOOL."
,frodolives,2011-01-09T18:51Z,"It's so very nice of you to share your novel of an opinion. Everyone has a right to believe what they want to believe based on the information they read and see. We'll believe what we want to believe and you can believe you want to believe. So you should also shut the fuck up.

Thank you."
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-02-23T02:03Z,"daryllmmm-you pillock they cant use the hubble cos its not designed fer shorty distances.
why did armstrongs boot leave a 1 inch imression-yet the lunar module made noe & its several tons heavier? why did ap 11 take 3 days 2 get to the moon-yet 13 was 200 thousand miles from earth -26 hrs into the mission when it went tits up? the laser reflector could easily be landed on the moon in the 60s.the furthest man has been is the shuttle.Its preposterous to assume we went to the moon in a nissan micra & using a sinclair zx spectrum -WE CAT GET TO THE MOON NOW!!!HOW ON EARTH WOULD WE HAVE GOT THERE IN THE 60S? simply didnt happen -why are the backgrounds in aps14 upward all the same? yet all were on different parts of the moon?? you cant deny they are ALL identical? why?"
[T],whaleoilbeefhooked,2011-02-23T02:11Z,"LMFAOOOOOOOO @ MYRELATIVES WORKED ON THE SATURN V ROCKETS HAHAHAHA priceless!!!& still you see no irony in the garbage you posted on here?! Like theyd know pmsl,like the grunts would be ""in"" on it,that is fuckin hilarious.ITS FACT that we didnt go,just cos someone SAYS we did -doesnt make it so! it technicalogically couldnt happen now & cou;ldnt then-we dont have the gear & no way would you send the worlds most expensive thing -with 2 unarmed men,in an untested command module-whos engines HAD NEVER BEEN TESTED-LET ALONE THE LEM HAD NEVER  BEEN TESTED THAT IT WOULD EVEN FIRE IN 1/6 GRAVITY!!! there are so many holes nasa is calkled the sponge=pathetic!! "
,knobcore,2011-06-08T11:31Z,"@dlarrym1111 Thanks for providing some sense.

To you other guys: If you cannot spell ""technologically"" you have no room to speak!

The moon is not hollow.  There are no aliens in the moon. We DID go to the moon. 

If you can be in space, you can be on the moon. If a rocket can launch in ZERO gravity, 1/6 of gravity would not make a lick of difference. 1/6 gravity would make it EASIER to launch a rocket from the moon, than it would be from the earth. 

Did Newtonian physics teach you ANYTHING? 

We have not had much advances in rocket technology since the 60s. There's really only a couple ways to make rockets strong enough to leave earth's gravity. Does that mean everything NASA does is false? Are there REALLY satellites in space or are they there to communicate with aliens in disguise?

,dirtp00r,2011-06-22T15:24Z,"Hey, frodolives...
Everyone is entitled to an opinion including  dlarrym1111 so why don't you shut up.
dlarry and others are wasting their time trying to use reason and logic on these Apollo conspiracy goofs but we keep trying.
A simple Google search will show that LRO has already imaged the Apollo 11 site.
Anyone who actually believes that the US was able to pull off a hoax of such immense magnitude should seek professional help.
Of all the hundreds of thousands of people, hundreds of corporations, spacecraft and launch vehicles that can be seen and touched, launch facilities, etc. that it wouldn't have been exposed early on in the program is deluded. Hell, the government can't even keep a cover-up for a few months, let alone for 6 Apollo landing missions.
Myself, I get sick of running across this crap when I search for NASA, Apollo or Lunar torrents.
If people want to download and believe this garbage then so be it, I just wish there was less of it so I could find legit manned space torrents."
,ntsrtrq,2011-08-03T23:26Z,"Moon hoaxers are about as insane as religious people. It is important that sane people inform them of it.
I am a scientist with a Ph.D. in physics.
We deal with reality.

""Freedom to believe what we want"" is bullshit. We will believe based on the data that is presented to us and based on our training in thinking logically. There is nothing that you or anyone else can do to force you to believe anything else.
""Freedom from bullshit"" is what we can demand. That means freedom from this kind of fucked up nonsense."
,pilatuspilot,2011-08-18T16:20Z,"I'm facilitating a space ed weekend (sponsored by a national space organization) for some 20 teen-aged wannabe astronauts in a few weeks so came on here to see if there was something beyond the tired official tales most of us know by heart and can recite effortless half-comatose. I breezed through the list the uploader kindly provided and thought, 'yeah, I know those flix' and was going to just move on. However, after reading the venomous see-saw comments (which I thought was intended to be about quality and gratitude for the desire & effort to share) appended to this collection of files I further thought: 'Hey, if this stuff can stir such viscerality from a mere octet of faceless mouths imagine what it will inspire from 20 gung-ho astro-wannabies.' (I'm hope there's at least one thinker-beyond-the-partyline-box who dares to challenge popular consensus; that individual will likely be a future mission commander, if he or she does nothing but take on the brave role of advocatus diaboli amongst a group of emotionally charged peers anchored to generally spoon-fed space education.) By the way, the Hoagland-Bara book is a masterpiece, regardless one's thoughts on the subject. Should be a great event.
Thanks so much for this, litzwires. Much appreciated mate."
