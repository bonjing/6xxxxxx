,costello66,2010-12-25T18:08Z,@thehumandivine During awards season many films are available pre-release if they submit dvd screeners for award consideration.

I really enjoyed the film. The beginning is painfully slow. But it is a plot device. The ending left me a bit dissatisfied.

Also, I was worried it wouldn't be in English or would have subs because the opening credits were all in Italian and no one talked for a really long time. It did make it more interesting waiting to find out!"
,donki,2010-12-26T12:17Z,Thanks for this movie. For the first time in many months I was able to go to sleep without taking my sleeping pills.

,swellyify,2011-01-09T16:18Z,great download but the most dull and boring movie ever made
,jerdrej,2011-01-10T13:01Z,good copy; thank you very much
,camo12345,2011-01-11T12:28Z,"When I put it on I thought it was broke because it just shows you a car driving round for about 3 minutes (which is pretty long and boring in film terms).... I had to fastforward that bit, oh and also the two pole dancers dancing reeeeaaaaalllyyy slowly for an ENTIRE song, it bored me. At first I was like Ohh yeah, nice women... then i just got bored.

Then he drives round pointlessly, follows a woman in another car for about a minute, then goes home! 


That's all I could take, I was falling asleep, it had been 20-25 minutes and if a film can't grab your attention from the start then it's not worth watching!"
,bc1990,2011-01-12T12:06Z,"obviously you've never seen a sofia coppola film. and if you can't watch it for more than 20 minutes, your opinion doesn't count. go watch transformers."
,highlander777,2011-01-20T15:44Z,I thought it was an OK movie. I didn't quite understand the ending though.
,hklpirate,2011-01-23T06:11Z,great movie.
,skyvillage,2011-01-30T19:53Z,"This is a terrible boring movie.  Another movie where we're supposed to feel sorry for those poor rich Hollywood people who are so alienated and whatever.  This is the only thing Sofia Coppola knows about.  She needs to get a life, then she'd have something else to write about."
,l_arbiza,2011-02-28T00:32Z,Great audio and video. Excellent movie. It's a slow movie. Coppola makes everyone feel what she wants exploring long the scenes.
,mhikl,2011-04-13T07:21Z,"When some complain a movie is boring yet many DL it and many say it is good, it must be good. This I have found to be true many times.
Namaste SaM"
,Rugburned,2011-04-25T18:43Z,"Be careful, they are tracking this one.  Just got a notice from my ISP about this torrent."
