Oryx And Crake - Oryx + Crake (2010)


Self-titled debut ablum






The debut LP from this Atlanta-based band may be the most widely acclaimed local album of the year. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been reading for a while you know that we fell for this band the first time we heard them. But please donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take it from us, some of GeorgiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest music sites Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ohmpark, Dead Journalist, Little Advances, and Blue Indian Ã¢â‚¬â€œ have all praised it.

Davy Minor, curator of Ohmpark wrote: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve heard many bands, hoping to create something timeless yet relevant, try to blend conservative music with more modern ideas, but rarely have I heard it achieved this successfully.Ã¢â‚¬Â

Chuck Norton over at Dead Journalist had this to say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“So when I find a band that gets me excited, I feel like a love-struck teenager Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Let me introduce you to my newest crush: Oryx + Crake.Ã¢â‚¬Â

We couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t agree more! This finely crafted but accessible album is addictive with hooks, harmonies and beautifully orchestrated moments of bliss and angst. In fact when the word got out about this record, they had to sneak copies (pre-release) into Decatur CD to meet demand (they still have a couple copies on hand).
