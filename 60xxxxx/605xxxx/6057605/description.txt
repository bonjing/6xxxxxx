In TEN STUPID THINGS COUPLES DO TO MESS UP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS, Dr Laura addresses the problems men and women face in finding peace, joy, and individual as well as married fulfillment in relationships. She identifies the ten most common mistakes people make that mess up their relationships, including: 1. Stupid Secrets: withholding information for fear of rejection 2. Stupid Egotism: asking now what you can do for the relationship but only what the relationship can do for you 3. Stupid Pettiness: making a big deal out of the small stuff 4. Stupid Power: the need to always be in control
5. Stupid Priorities: consuming all your time and energies with work, hobbies, errands and chores instead of focusing on your relationship 6. Stupid Happiness: seeking stimulation and assurance from all the wrong places to satisfy the immature need to feel good 7. Stupid Excuses: not being ***able for bad behaviour 8. Stupid Liaisons: not letting go of negative attachments to friends and relatives who are damaging to your relationship 9. Stupid Mismatch: not knowing when to leave and cut your losses 10. Stupid break-ups: disconnecting for all the wrong reasons...
