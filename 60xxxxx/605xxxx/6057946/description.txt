Release Notes:

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene
started in the mid eighties

If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back
on contacting us as soon as possible

Special Note:

Dear RELOADED

We like how you turned your own "serious" discussion into a
questionalble discussion

You did take the chance to proper our latest SecuROM releases
but you were a bit too fast on doing so. Simply because your
own cheesy methods of dealing with SecuROM. Yes, you reverse
the protection, unless the game feature VM triggers. Those you
choose to emulate the exact same way as we did those SecuROM
releases we released this month

You call us stealers of this SecuROM method, but we haven't
stolen anything. So stop doing that! The funny thing is that
we have looked at your Steam emulator code that exactly match
the public available source code onStealing have
another meaning now, doesn't it?

You had the same fight with other groups in the past, when
someone propered your SecuROM method, but in the end, these
same groups found out that they had to emulate those VM calls
themselves or else they were unable to win future SecuROM
releases from you

We choose to call it evolution of time, as you yourseles have
been focusing on speed rather than proper reversing. The
problem is that the scene started to race with the P2P/WEB
persons/groups as the public don't care about if a game is
properly reversed or not. They just want to play games that
works without any triggers tampering with the enjoyment of the
games. Sadly you have taken a huge step in that direction with
your activation of Tages, Solidshield, Solidshield 2, Themida
and of course SecuROM VM calls

We could continue, but what's the point? You know, you write
about holes that should been kept in the dark, so the
protection developers wont close them. Pretty silly remark as
you already mentioned that P2P/WEB people already have found
these holes themselves. You actually seem to know much more
about the P2P/WEB than the scene you're releasing in

We're not living in year 2000 anymore, a period with "heavy"
protections mostly known as CD checks. It's soon 2011 and
your method thinking in your nfo is still in the past, but
why spend hours and hours reversing something, when the end
result is aworking game release anyway? Well you
already answered that question with the bunch of releases we
mentioned above. Quality takes time, then why do you yourself
use cheap ass methods?

We will promise to stop the releases of future SecuROM titles
done this way, if you promise to stop your own activation
method. It's in the same league

Go "group request" nuke those activation releases of yours and
we will do the same with our SecuROM cracks. It's just that
simple
