,ishist,2010-12-22T03:05Z,4 old games
,elturbo9077,2010-12-22T04:14Z,thanks skidrow keep the good work its 4 games in one its not a new game ok people
,RMJ13,2010-12-22T05:15Z,"I have the Orignial Pc release,s of the first 2   the AUDIO is much better in them then  this release!   If you have good speakers and you like this game  FIND the original!  I don,t know about the last 2  they were never released on PC! "
,RMJ13,2010-12-22T05:35Z,"the 4th is just horrible!  the 3rd is a 3d version of ABE   they both fail !   Unlike the first 2 ,  the other 5.8 gig is not worth downloading  IMHO!"
,montalon,2010-12-22T06:45Z,Thank you so much! i fucking loved strangerswrath when i was little
,boilerrat,2010-12-22T07:00Z,"Great work SKIDROW, but could you please just put stranger's wrath on here?

 I don't want the other games."
,cos13,2010-12-22T09:43Z,they are giving you a donkey for free and you are checking it's teeth
,jonnetuominen,2010-12-22T11:35Z,ahh ps1 childhood has come back
,policandru,2010-12-22T12:29Z,is anybody having problems with munch's keep crashing and with stranger's wrath menus not showing text?
,Cyrez60659,2010-12-22T13:28Z,"Thanks for this SKIDROW, I actually requested this.
Please note that even the proper version of The Oddboxx currently suffers from a few technical problems (visual bugs, frame rate issues etc) which will most likely be patched in a few weeks. So keep an eye out for updates."
,yelloo,2010-12-22T19:20Z,Thanks AiTB.
,shinrahz,2010-12-23T04:20Z,LOL whats all this in the Description about Reloaded? sounds like SKidrow and Reloaded are fighting
,Ransu90,2010-12-23T04:26Z,Munch's Oddysee was just updated on Steam and a patch is being worked on for Stranger's Wrath right now.  If you all had bought this then you would have gotten it.
,Boykes_XYZ,2010-12-23T09:53Z,"Thanks for the upload. About RELOADED, I reckon too they are pretty quick. I did have some problems with not proper cracking, like playing with his account, etc. NFS:HP, I still don't know why I can't do it, so if you please? It is not you, RELOADED and Razor1911 (The biggest 3 in games imo), can't give the same release, or help the other one's release. Still, very good job, I can count on you :D"
,yazz00,2010-12-23T13:08Z,these games sure are depressing
,1TWISTED,2010-12-23T15:53Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,degusto,2010-12-23T19:53Z,"What about the updates for the games? Will they be uploaded as well? Would be nice becouse at present state the games are unplayable, Munch and Hunter mostly."
,Pliskin.s,2010-12-24T08:00Z,"Thanks Skidrow !

Skidrow has a point, Reloaded usually gets theirs out first but doesn't actually fully crack the game.Seems a bit of a feud in the scene has been brewing for some time.

"
,Doubtpb,2010-12-24T09:36Z,"SKIDROW FTW 
not only they release fully cracked but they update them too!"
,boilerrat,2010-12-24T16:35Z,"Skip all the fighting with RELOADED, everyone has the same goal of providing your fans with awesome games.

Your fans don't like any arguing, we love all of our crackers."
,morepunk,2010-12-24T20:35Z,munchs oddysee doesn't work.unless u only like playing one min. before it crashes.then yes it works
,ximon8,2010-12-24T22:27Z,"Yes please post the updates, I beg of you."
,Mr-Rivet-Head,2010-12-25T17:15Z,"An update has been released via steam that BOOSTS performance,

Any chance we could see the update posted here?"
,risika413,2010-12-25T18:36Z,"Seed damn you. Oh and for the people bitching for updates. 

You are getting this for FREE. Why don't you guys get off your ass and try to figure it out yourself.

You all sit here and enjoy the fruits of Skids labor, then bitch that it's not good enough.

Let's see you guys do something about it instead of complain.

I don't know much, definitely not nearly as much as skid.

But at least I try to fix my games myself before I go griping for help."
,Mr-Rivet-Head,2010-12-25T22:26Z,"@risika413

Munch and stranger were badly optimised ports thrown across for the holiday season,
Yes im aware that this has been ripped into an AIO package but alas skidrow do post updates for games E.G. COD/Fallout etc

The only public fix that was available was via a res changing config,
Not that much help to be honest even for some power users out there like myself with crossfire/i7 setups,

im well aware that they DO NOT have to post every single update available but when it effects performance across a variety of machines it would be nice of them to do so,

As a note to anybody else the dev team acknowledged the issues and did get a patch out within the last 2 days,

Whether this will make it to us pirates is unknown,
I'll await anybody to rip that across or created a patched executable"
,thegambler19,2010-12-26T07:33Z,"How the f can this game b 6,05gb ? Just watched the trailer and it looks like a 200mb game . haha"

,FelleFisk,2011-01-07T18:04Z,"@ Isaac401

well... i started with mounting the image and installing it using DAEMON Tools Lite (4.30.3), after that i went in to the donloaded folder and extracted the SKIDROW folder from the image, and copy/pasted it into [C:\Program Files\Oddworld Inhabitants\Oddworld The Oddboxx].

I had short cuts from the installation on my deskop, so i dubble klicked on (Oddworld - Strangers Wrath) and a window popped up 
http://img404.imageshack.us/i/swrathlauncher.jpg/

I pressed Medium and then Play.

Then I press New Game

Then it says Enter Player Name, and its already typed in STRANGER so i press DONE, and the game starts with a intro movie, so i watch the whole movie. 
When the movie ends a window popps upp (in the game not in windows...) and says: 
UABLE TO SAVE GAME. PRESS SPACE Key TO CONTINUE.

I press Enter and the press RESUME GAME... and then i try to QUICKSAVE the window popps up again! :S :("
,FelleFisk,2011-01-07T18:09Z,"PS. I didint un pack the release, i just mounted it, (I mounted the DVD and installed) could that be the problem?

whether i get it to work with the controller though still thanks for the upload."
,Alkazaar,2011-10-05T17:18Z,"a million thanks to skidrow for all games downloaded in the past

doesnt look like there are any clean cut fixs for munch and stranger,
i tried strangers wrath had save problems similar to FelleFisk a page or two back, 
cant save anyway
first person view is trippy like http://www.eatliver.com/img/2010/6264.jpg that kind of style, like i punch and my punches are saved there, 
impossible to aim guns
i can read the menu fine

i started the game with a logitech ps3 controller, usually i use xpadder, torrent it johnsachs, best thing ever for usb controllers,, the game thought i was using an xbox one so it was more than a bit fucked up, couldnt look around, right analog useless, actually it was left and right on on the right analog for attacks, weird

not sure if im gonna bother tryin again with the aim fucked and that
oddboxx still worth it for abes oddysee, havent even tried the 2nd one yet

once again thanks skidrow"

,thunderlungz425,2012-04-10T11:30Z,"I'd also just like to point out that Skidrow is the one group that I have had the least problems with. They release quality piracy. Thank you Skidrow. I greatly appreciate what you've done for me and the community. I've gotten plenty of good shit from Razor and Reloaded as well but of the three, I trust that Skidrow the most and ironically Reloaded the least."

I rarely have issues so I always disregard the problems other people have reported. If I come up with a fix, I'll post it. If anyone else does, I'm interested in hearing it."
