,xSyKoTiKx,2011-02-01T05:51Z,"I don't know if it's Cinavia protected.  I was my encodes using a WD TV Live, personally.  I know that my videos are technically compatible with XBOX 360, PS3, WD TV Live, and PC/Mac, but I can't say whether each one is or isn't protected by Cinavia since WD TV Live's don't check for that method of protection (they don't care if the audio stream is watermarked with Cinavia protection).  You'll just have to try it and find out, or just watch it on a computer or WD TV (Live) to avoid any copy protections it may have."
