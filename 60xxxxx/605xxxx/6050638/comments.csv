,amirsalam,2010-12-19T14:00Z,"the problem is that society impose the streotypes lifestyle, people have superficial thinking and function by images, they just liketo clic , and not read, less reading and more facebook.
they know nothing about faith or even why come to the earth and where they could go or what's the point of their exsitence.
mohamed is a messenger of god, whateva lies you mention about him.
the Quran is the only book unchanged.
Peace on you."

I'm guessing you belong to either jewish or christian faith, right? You sem to forget how old was Mary when she married Joseph who was himself 90-years old.
Many heroes of Old and New Testament had wives that you would call a child. In Bible there's even call by God to kill men and take little girls for pleasure and even infants!!!
And you're probably not from Europe because if you were and knew anything from medieval Europe (and older) you'd knew that girls were married even at the age of 9.
And I don't mean royalty but ""normal"" people.
It was much later that by law it was decided an age limit for what we call a child.

In old times a woman of age of 14 was considered quite adult. That was because people lived shorter back then and the custom ordered that as soon as girl reach maturity she be married. 

So hold your tongue!"

,manosteell,2011-06-30T13:44Z,"Opposite of brainwashing (which clearly the media has done a great job of, on you already) Islam challenges one to use his God-given REASON to prove to himself with evidence (not blind faith as in other religions) or because he was born into, that Islam is the true prescription of God to the way of life. In the original Quran from over 1400 yrs ago, which is the only book to never have been changed or tainted = humans are formed from the fusion of semen and sperm, then forming a clot of blood, then muscle on top of bone = 1400+ yrs ago. The mountains are like pegs which keep the earth from shaking = 1400+. The universe is in the perfect mathematical arrangement, all the dimensions, cosmic energy, atomic proportions to sustain life on earth; any slight degree of variance and we would not exist (coincidence? evolution? Don't fool yourself) = 1400+. All these scientific miracles which were only discovered by human advancement and technology in the past 2 centuries, and a reason why most scientists who study the Quran revert back to Islam. Enlighten yourselves; use scholarly resources if you are not too lazy to research, instead of listening to fox news and this dribble. Read about the Illuminati and how Satan motivated Charles Darwin's THEORY of evolution and considers preachers of that theory among the highest rank of his misguided followers. You must have really come from apes, with your monkey point of view; because even the devil believes in God, so what does that make you???  Islam will NEVER die! especially not because of misguided misinformed ignorant blind deaf and dumb fools.  There's a reason why it still remains the fastest growing religion in spite of hate mongering; a reason why Muhammad is the world's most popular name; and a reason why the Quran is the most memorized book on the planet, in its unchanged form since the beginning of its inception, as God has promised.  Wake up!!!  May we all find peace"
,manosteell,2011-06-30T13:47Z,"PS.  Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) married Aisha who was way passed puberty at the time, at least 17 yrs old, according to SCHOLARLY resources, as a political statement; to strengthen the alliance between himself and her father, Abu Bakr who was considered the best friend of all time.
Also, back in those days and even earlier in the 1700s in the U.S. and all around the world, people married younger as their life expectancy was way lower.  There you go, a little knowledge for you silly rabbit"
