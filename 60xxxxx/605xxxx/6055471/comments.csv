,neil3009,2011-01-06T21:40Z,come on dude give us the right activation its doing my head in
,Optimus_L,2011-01-15T12:33Z,"Worked fine for me. After it installs another smaller box comes up which asks for activation. I figured activation won't work until the files have been patched so I just canceled it off. 

After the installer has finished, copy all the patched files over, open the read-me and copy the Player Key. Run the game and it will ask you for the player key in-game. Paste the key in, press OK and you should be good to go.

I've already played a few games and it seems to work fine."
,Optimus_L,2011-01-15T12:37Z,"Just in case... Explore your burned or mounted DVD, and got to ""(DVD Drive Letter):\Crack""

All patched files are in there."
,rafex987,2011-01-17T23:51Z,didn't find any read-me file.... can you post the player key please? thanks for the game.
,synysponge,2011-01-22T17:00Z,"Ahahah this game just busted my 8800GT ! (Overheat I think)
I'd consider not downloading this if you have a 8800GT gpu...

This game is impressively badly optimized.
But thanks anyway for the torrent."
,Serv-Bear,2011-02-07T18:03Z,the code dose not work!
,Serv-Bear,2011-02-07T18:11Z,Right I re copied everything and its working.
,Xyloks,2011-02-10T08:54Z,"Hey, sorry to sound silly, But I've just downloaded this torrent this morning and I managed to get it up and running. 

A while later it asked for the activation key, sorry to be tedious but here goes:

I unrar'd and mounted the iso
Then I installed the game (although at the end of the installation it asked for activation I followed one of the comments here and cancelled it) I then ran the game and installed the update. 
After that I got the folder named Crack from the mounted iso and copied it to the install dir.
The night before it worked but I tried it again after reinstall and it didn't work, what did I miss? it keeps asking for activation key now.
Any help would be much appreciated =)"
,djindahouse,2011-02-15T15:40Z,correct me if im wrong but if you updated then cracked the game that could be the problem. most cracks are for a certan version so if you update passed the cracks version it wont work the same and could cause the key problem. just a though
,johnnyd6992,2011-02-17T20:14Z,"hi can anyone help?
i have downloaded and then burned to disk, then installed the game. i have copied the crack file into the main folder and when i run the game it asks for the activation key which i have entered as directed but it doesnt work.

,bobocentric,2011-02-19T01:52Z,"Works fine for me. Thanks for sharing. I love this game, but it's buggy. Anyone got wind of a fix for the latest version (2.0.1.1 I believe)?"
,TheLegendaryCracken,2011-02-21T02:10Z,"Okay for those of you struggling: Once you have mounted and installed the game, go to the folder of the mounted iso, not the one you've installed. In there should be a folder called ""Crack"". Open that and copy the contents. Go to the folder of the installed game (should be something like Program Files, Cyanide, Blood Bowl Legendary Edition). In that folder named Blood Bowl Legendary Edition, paste everything you just copied from the crack folder and click replace when it asks you if you want to. Then play the game and it will eventually ask for a key or something and use the one given in the description ( RELOADED2010-12345678-08731 ). Okay there you go. I really hope this helps, if not maybe read it again because i think i made it all clear?"

,DaleJordanGee,2011-05-09T13:50Z,this game is EXTREMELY bad! s'all about dice rolling and shit. fucking crap.
,ninja51,2011-05-30T09:08Z,"I actually did manage to get this working so I figure I might as well share how I did it if some people have trouble.

Install the game normally, when asked for the key during the installation, cancel, you wont put it into they out of game boxes at all. Next, run the game, and patch it up. Then copy all content from the crack folder on the ISO to your main game folder, then you'll be able to access the game. Once in game, the code will be asked for, and THEN you put it in. If you follow these steps youll be playing some Blood Bowl in no time."
,wildebeest,2011-07-24T21:13Z,"how  can i ""run the game, and patch it up""?
the game wont start without cracking it first!"
