,privatco,2011-01-03T17:50Z,"Thanx it's very nice movie I like it.
V: 9
A: 8
Download:  very fast  10/10"
,taelmans,2011-07-11T17:14Z,fast dl great quality !
,Thomps6o,2011-07-18T09:01Z,"--I do not know what ""privatco"" is talking about the video being 9 and the audio being 8.

--The quality can literally not get any better, the video bitrate has been set variable, with an average bitrate of 2,000 Kbps and the peak hitting 10,424 Kbps!!! Mind you, this is with x264 core.

--Same with the audio, set variable with and average bitrate of 369 Kbps and the peak at 495 Kbps

--I swear that you are just posting numbers just for the hell of it and no other reason. I actually came back to ask the ""GreatMagician"" what program he used to be able to encode both video and audio at variable rates, because it was so good."
,horgin34,2011-07-23T21:03Z,"Aw man for a second I thought this was the short film. Oh well, the full length one is a magnificent movie.
Video and Audio and fantastic.
Thank you Magician!!"

,bizzybody,2011-09-25T21:17Z,It has hardsubs. Anyone have a high resolution version without subtitles?
,bizzybody,2011-09-26T06:07Z,"Weird. Media Player Classic 1.3.1264.0 is reading the subtitles from a subfolder, but won't allow them to be turned off or a specific one to be selected.

Bugs in the player software."
,useduser,2011-09-30T08:04Z,"@bizzybody wtf are you talking about? 
It doesn't have hardsubs ppl.
Next time THINK before you place misleading comments here!"
,Kereru,2012-05-22T18:01Z,"Audio slightly out of sych I thought, used MKV Merge to change it about -200ms"
