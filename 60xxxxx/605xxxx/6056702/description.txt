Release Title:Cashback 2006 HDTVRip 720p H264 AAC-GreatMagician (Kingdom-Release)

Storyline: When art student Ben Willis dumps his girlfriend Suzy, he develops insomnia
after finding out how quickly she moved on. To pass the long hours of the night, he starts working the late night shift
at the local supermarket. There he meets a colorful cast of characters, all of whom have their own 'art' in dealing with
the boredom of an eight-hour-shift. Ben's art is that he imagines himself stopping time. This way, he can appreciate the
artistic beauty of the frozen world and the people inside it - especially Sharon, the quiet checkout girl, who perhaps holds
the answer to solving the problem of Ben's insomnia.
