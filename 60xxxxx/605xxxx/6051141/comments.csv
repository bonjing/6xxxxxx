It's cause the people uploading don't understand what they are doing. They aren't the rippers. They find it somewhere else and upload it here. Don't even bother explaining.

Explaining is futile. Anyone using RAR on heavily compressed video has already proven to me how little they understand about what's going on.

Don't argue with these fucking idiots. They just dig in deeper and justify RAR because it's how they got it. They never become self aware to the point they could just unrar and upload that torrent on TPB instead.

Moral - Only Complete Fucking Morons use RAR on compressed video. So when you see it don't complain, just accept you are dealing with an idiot."

,shadowzone69,2010-12-22T06:23Z,Ummm... So you don't like Steve Carell... Good for you... Do you have nothing better to do with your time than to comment on a file your not interested in? Seriously no-one cares if you don't like him.
