,Mecha123,2011-01-17T20:58Z,"Watch out!  When this program is opened, it recognizes that you are running a pirated version of this software.  It then opens a browser page that lists your nation, your town, and you IP address, and states: ""Warning.  We know you are running a pirated version of this software.  We suggest you buy a license immediatly to prevent legal action."" 

I didn't buy a license..."
,jjdoe43,2011-01-18T13:05Z,mecha123 is right
,jjmcwill,2011-01-30T06:38Z,"Do not download this shit file. I'm operating win 7 home premium 64 bit and it slowed my os down to a crawl. Even worse it changed my windows login which took me several hour to fix. Even now I have to type my password several times over before it accepts. Don't know if it is a virus, compatibility issues, or my not understanding the program functions. I uninstalled program and windows is operating fine."
,reddish8080,2011-02-13T16:34Z,bigwimpie the serail  key wont work do u have any more that i could try thanks

,GaryHyuna95,2011-03-16T19:21Z,"**CORRECTION

i've install it and blocked the application with comodo firewall.. it was a success in the beginning, but then out of all sudden i've been caught for the fake serial to get this application registered and my ip address has been tracked by systweak.com.. to conclude, the serial provide can't be use anymore.. any solution people? "
,Flopis,2011-04-09T16:55Z,"I have tried System Mechanic, TuneUp Utilities and now Advanced System Optimizer. They all stop working sooner or later. We have to go for the less popular which will benefit from more users and positive comments... such as WinCleaner or SuperUtilities."
,m4u23,2011-04-10T10:07Z,"Block the application from any kind of internet access from your firewall, and then activate it by using the key
00ZNXX-FA684X-21PQZQ-41H89P

it works..."
,light420,2011-04-11T04:28Z,"For Full Functionality renew licence key.
I have tried tons of different keys none work.
So I gave up an uninstalled this software."
,Des337135,2011-04-13T06:03Z,what happens if i let it update?
,parry8780,2011-04-19T08:15Z,"do not download it works for a bit, but then it stoped, i try 10 keys its not werth the time "

,iAmOptimistic,2011-06-20T23:38Z,"Try this serial;

02FB1W-WHGM9F-RZQ67K-QQPBAV-EY2WY3

---------------------

This program will work, simply do not let it connect to the internet at all and this includes not updating the program.

Once you have been caught with a serial, it won't work again but this serial is another chance. Be more careful!"
,aimad,2011-06-22T10:50Z,man u made my day. it really worked with no problems at all . thanx for the up
,jamieoveride,2011-06-23T22:56Z,you all need to be quiet..there is nothing wrong with this upload..like you've been told just DONT search for UPDADAES....simplez :)...and also agree with IAMOPTIMISTIC  use that code just copy and paste it if you need it..this programe is the absoloute BOLLOX after finding out i had invalid enteries on my registery and cleaning it off at a sweep of my system my computer has never run so fast cheers BIGWIMPIE i will be cheecking out your other software uploads if you have any :P
,Cracker_Jak,2011-07-07T05:41Z,"Worked for me, not gona say which serial worked though, I have mixed feelings about people exposing a serial right on these pages, a lot of the time they work and it saves a lot of time. Then on the other hand the company's that make this software can see and block the serials....anyway thanks for the up and I will seed "
,Cracker_Jak,2011-07-13T21:22Z,"I have a question Mr Big, When I run the security adviser I am told my firewall is turned off. I have Norton 2011. I tried shutting down Norton and turned windows firewall on , ran security adviser and received the same notification. I noticed the same thing when I was trying Tune-up utilities. Action center that comes with win 7 tells me I am protected with Norton.  "
,Cracker_Jak,2011-07-16T17:21Z,"Just a word of warning, To find out the answer to my above question I hit the ""optimize my security""and guess what, virus, fake av,.Sorry Mr. Big, I guess the sculls don't mean shit."
,Wulf579,2011-07-18T06:09Z,"Doesn't do any good whatsoever to have the software if you have to not let it update. OVER HALF of the tools provided will NOT work because you have to block them from being able to update themselves. Need a better way (Key Generator, etc.) that will register the software without having to block its Internet access before it will be of any use. "
,Cracker_Jak,2011-07-20T20:27Z,"Re: Scull comment. 
 I apologize for my sculls don't mean shit comment. Mr. Big, I have downloaded other torrents from you and they were absolutely clean. I realize that someone could have added a virus at any time after you up-loaded this torrent. So I mean no disrespect and I appreciate your time and effort. Peace"
,EvilWolf,2011-08-15T10:59Z,"Just a note when blocking the program with your firewall, there are loads of app files that it runs for different features and it seems some if not all also check if it's genuine.
When I first installed I only blocked ASO3.exe then I was caught out when it ran RegClean.exe. After that I reinstalled and blocked all .exe in the install directory and so far every feature works great.

Also when I reinstalled the original serial wasn't accepted but the first one that TopMaX_1 posted on the comments worked fine (00ZNXX-FA684X-21PQZQ-41H89P)."
,EvilWolf,2011-08-15T20:37Z,"Just to add to the note above, the only thing that doesn't work is the spyware remover due to no internet connection. You could try letting that tool through the firewall but I think it's likely it will invalidate the whole program."
,chavez59,2011-08-23T23:42Z,"This one woks for me, try (VERSION 3.2.648.11550): 029F0F-5JQ67T-K9ZQVX-MCW6V3-5XRPKK"
,lm324,2011-09-13T19:54Z,"@iAmOptimistic Yours worked for me, thank you very much. Block checkupdate.exe on your firewalls, if your already blocked and you click update, it should say you have some problem with your internet conection."
,AppGenius,2012-03-21T21:52Z,Good upload.
,AppGenius,2012-03-21T21:55Z,"Does anyone know why I get a ""Database error"" message when I try to post some comments?
Additional details:
The comment I was trying to post when I get this message is quite large, 301 words to be more specific."
