                    Comedy drama. Erin Taylor is a high-powered,  
                    London advertising executive who has it all.  
                    Planning every aspect of her life, nothing  
                    takes Erin by surprise until she dramatically  
                    discovers her boyfriend Mike isn't all she  
                    thought he was. She takes revenge by abusing  
                    his credit card and buying, among other things,  
                    a rundown farm in Yorkshire. With Mike's scorn  
                    ringing in her ears, Erin decides to make a go  
                    of it without realising just how much work is  
                    involved and the difficulty of adapting to an  
                    entirely new, rural life.
