deadmau5 isnt dubstep its house wich is techno and techno is also dubstep but it fits in a sub category"

,PrintName,2011-07-10T15:32Z,word. respect for the torrent
,001720BC,2011-07-31T01:14Z,"Guys if you really like this please buy the albums, this guy really deserves it ! "
,ust2,2011-08-02T00:34Z," Great upload +1.

 But wow is this guy's music over-rated, after all the buzz around it I expected much more.

 I like techno/electro/industrial/etc, but this is some of the most repetitive stuff around. Every song sounds the same and is like 1min of music looped for 7min.

 It just sounds like someone playing around with that frootyloops program to me lol, disapointed :("
,macuff,2011-08-28T17:07Z,thanks man
,dommels,2011-09-21T19:31Z,"@KidChem1

 the comments i read are.
My ears are﻿ crying. Horrid.
must﻿ i be on drugs to enjoy dub music? 
piratebay sent me here... and I'm very disappointed.﻿

deadmau5 sucks thats what i call american artist just have 1 or 2 good songs and the artist is good just like bloody beetroots.
you should listen some dutch house like afrojack, vato gonzales, quintino or hardwell thats what i call quality.
almost everytrack of them is banging not lilke this shit "
,ACiDxVoLTaGe,2011-09-30T15:01Z,"@dommels

Deadmau5 is Canadian... Just saying."
,s8anet,2011-10-19T08:25Z,"@jflores
Really I think Deadmau5 should be its own genre all together. No1 touches it :D"
,punk333,2011-11-04T01:21Z,@jflores deadmau5 is so far away from anything remotely dubstep
,Heromist,2011-12-03T19:25Z,"btw, you dont have at play 3"
,Xemnu,2011-12-10T10:55Z,@Kramesies Not dubstep dubstep goes wubwub this goes bowwowowowowowow fucking amazing... hardstyle/electro/house 
,ReVaQ,2012-04-23T04:15Z,All these albums are worth buying..
,Warjo,2012-05-28T14:52Z,"Funny how ppl are so precise about genres... i listen to good music, don't give a fuck about genres, other than the main ones. And i don't judge a song by the artist.. a good song is a good song, no matter who, how, why, or what genre it represents. 

And ty SpecialPlace for the torrent.. but like some ppl said, deadmau5 is worth buying too. :) As soon as i won the lottery i'll buy every album ;)"
,robertandjenc,2012-06-07T06:10Z,waiting...waiting...for my DAD to help me download! XD i want this sssoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad!!!!
