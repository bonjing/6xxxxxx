Get into bone chilling, pressure-packed hunting situations as you seek out 
savage animals in the world's most dangerous locations. In Cabela's Dangerous 
Hunts 2009, you will face raw danger as you encounter the fiercest animals on 
earth, including lions, grizzly bears, jaguars and more. Accurately modeled 
CabelaÂ¡Â¯s equipment in the game means the firearms, tactics and gear are all 
realistic and precise - but this wonÂ¡Â¯t always help in the face of an 
unpredictable, open environment packed with avalanches, elephant stampedes, and 
piranha infested waters. If you do miss a shot and fail to stop a charging 
man-eating animal, you will be forced to fight it via a melee defense - but pay 
attention; it's likely another nearby animal will join the attack.
