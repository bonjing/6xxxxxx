The video seems to freeze/jump (without artifacts), meanwhile the audio is perfect.

Suggestions any1?"

It's not a problem at your end. There are reports at private trackers that this encode is faulty and freezes up. 

The comments were posted after BOZX uploaded this so it's not his fault either. Shit happens. :)

Pfa have just released the 1080p encode at 6.55 GB. I hope it's ok this time. Someone will post the torrent here sooner or later. "
