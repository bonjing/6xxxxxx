,Drowlord,2010-12-28T16:37Z,"I've seen CAMs for animated movies that are a bit better, so I'd give quality ratings v:8.5, a:8.5.  For a movie as dark as this, and live action, I don't expect that we'll see better quality before the DVD release.  There is no keystoning, blur (omnipresent) is very slight.  Dark scenes (most of the movie) are watchable.  Sound is good.  CG is crisp.  There are only a couple seconds of audience silhouette.  If you're generally tolerant of a CAM (which probably means you have reasons why you aren't seeing this in the theater), this is a good copy until DVD is out.

(in the context of a cam.  Why would someone rate a great cam at 5, leaving digital media rip  at 10.  That eliminates half the scale, making the rating useless.  For that matter, why would you rate a media rip?  It'll always be as close to perfect as compression allows.  Ratings are just for cams, let's make the scale meaningful.  Rating this a 5 in quality suggests that a better cam is soon to come out... which just isn't likely.)"

Hey All, Torrents 101: CAM - Both Audio And Video taken with small camera from a seat in the theatre, audio is usually hollow or echo sounding/ video may have people standing up in-frame or be off-center usually pretty blurry.  TS - Digital Audio taken directly from a feed from the audio port on the projection camera, video [should be] taken from a better camera on a tripod in the projection booth [obviously someone bribes a theatre employee], Still not DVDrip quality but noticeably superior to CAM.

""can someone explain to me why suddenly cam copies are all growing to be over a gig in size? ""

Because good uploaders like raymondhome are taking the time to run digital enhancement over the original CAM file to make the quality better.

Things like sharpness, dark scenes and frame-to-frame transition would be far worse (and the movie far less watchable) without these enhancements.  The side-effect is that the filesize grows a fair bit, because more information is being artificially inserted into the frames.

Hope this helps.

,Devilishredbeardishness,2011-02-13T19:19Z,waiting so long for a dvdrip of this.
,deama12,2011-02-13T23:44Z,The thing that I don't get is that if this movie is been available on the box office then why doesn't anyone use a screen capture software to record the movie?
,deama12,2011-02-13T23:46Z,And yes you can plug your sky box into your PC and watch it from your monitor instead of the TV.
,Tyson.T,2011-02-14T12:09Z,Does anyone know why a DVDRip hasn't come out yet
,deama12,2011-02-14T20:39Z,Because a dvd has not been released yet. :)
