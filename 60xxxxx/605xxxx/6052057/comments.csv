,Millerdis100,2010-12-29T14:52Z,"Thanks Computer-User! 

Everything seems to work, but im not so sure yet.

I did clean install on a new 2tb hard drive. Successfully booted from dvd, and install went well. The next thing i did was the activation. I used your recomended activation tool ''windows 7 activation'' and then i clicked on install and computer did restart.

But what's next? Is it all? It seems that activation went well because when i go to ''system'' it says ''windows is activated''.

But is it safe to do the updates now? Will there be any problems that may come?

Do i need to keep these activation tools? I havent use any serials though. Where do i have to use them? And what serials exactly? It gets so confusing for me :D Can you please answer my questions, thanks again."
,EveryName,2010-12-30T02:11Z,"Hey Computer-User,

First of all Thanks for the uploads, dude you rock!
Second , my problem:

I currently have a laptop with windows 7 home premium installed (legit version) but after installing a infected game (F1) my laptop is fucked, no mather what anti virus shit I run or anti spyware. So I want to reinstall windows, and because i didnt make a backup I figured out I could better Download your software. Now I basically have two questions , 1 is the Ultimate version a good choice? ( I have 4gb of ram and IntelCore i3 CPU m330 ) 2nd question: is installing easy and doable for an amateur. (very familiar with iso's and mounting and installing games and things like that) do you have a clear How To Install- instruction included?

Thanks in advance 4 the support and sorry if I ask retarded questions, but hey, now everyone can be such a pro as ;)  tnx again 4 the torrent. GR "

If Your Windows Sais It's Activated, Then You're Finished :)

If You Want Too Keep The Extra Activation Programs For Future Purposes, Then Back Them Up On A USB / Flash Drive, Or Burn Them To A CD lol :P

Use the burning applications provided in this torrent, and make sure you burn them as ISO files instead of Data files, that way it can boot from your DVD. And also make sure that your 1st Boot Device is set to your DVD Drive instead of you Hard Drive."

I want to thank you for the exceptionally great work you did on this my young Jedi friend.
You literally made this easier than installing a video game. You got files named perfectly(and easy to find), on the software(actually several options for each), and made it totally pain-free.

So you helped me out on a bad predicament, which actually made my job easy!

But I have a question:

I noticed you have a new update each month(November, December..etc), and I am wondering, Do I have to download the next one, like for instances, like the same thing but ""January"", and just do the upgrade, to get all the new updates and what not?"
[T],Computer-User,2010-12-30T22:37Z,"""aurabullet""

I have the Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and did a clean reformat and installed just perfectly, and installed all the drivers from my newly built computer.

However, Windows says that I have 30 days to activate. How do I go about activating Windows 7? I lost all the ""activation programs"" in the torrent when I reformatted, will I need to re-download the entire torrent to get at the activation programs or can you direct me to a single download I can use? And what is the activation options tied to, the motherboard? I ask because I built my computer myself so im hoping its tied to that and not whole pc manufacturer."

I have one question regarding the ""windows 7 activation."" I noticed with a lot of other types of activation, users must NOT download specific windows updates, specifically ones that determines if the OS is genuine or not. With the windows 7 activation do you need to ALSO stay away from specific windows updates?"

The Torrent Isn't Corrupt If It Was No Body Else Could Successfully Burn It, But There Is Nothing Wrong With This Torrent :)

,butcher36,2011-01-14T09:17Z,"Hello Computer-user, I wanted to tell you that the torrent worked perfectly and I am very grateful,
However I have a problem with a bluescreen, everything works fine, but sometimes when I'm on the desktop appears a bluescreen that says ""memory_managment"" and restarts automatically losing all processes that are open.
 This is not a windows problem because before I had the windows enterprise and had the same problem. I took your recommendation and format from zero installing your windows (Ultimate) and appeared the same problem. If you know a way to fix it or could help me with this problem, I would really appreciate.

anyway i tried to install windows 7 but some how i could not install it, well that was mainly because of my lack of computer knowledge in boot kind of stuff. but somehow i managed to install it after reading few instructions on various sites. 
so thanks to that little virus which i got from a torrent, im now using windows 7 for the first time and it works great with my G1sn, every thing is much better in windows 7, well thats my opinion. 
anyway i wrote my little story here because right now i am really really happy and its all because of you Mr computer-user. thank you very much for your help. now i think i should get cracking with my dissertation work in my new window 7 lol.

I've been trying to burn the ISO file to a DVD-RW.  Is that wrong?  I think I read somewhere it needs to be a DVD-R.  I've also tried to burn the ISO file on a USB Flash Drive.  It gets to 99% done but says its not bootable.  Something wrong with the ""bootsect"" folder.  PLEASE HELP!!"

If your laptop is a 32bit, and this torrent is a 64bit... wouldn't you think THAT would be the problem?

Look for a Windows 7 Ultimate 32BIT torrent

,ph001,2011-05-28T00:36Z,"Hey Computer-User

Thanx in advance for this masterpiece, thanx to all the seeders I'm averaging 600-700kB/s which means given my typing skills it will finish before I'm done here!  

Above all thanx for taking the time to answer all (so many often repeated) questions. After reading through, ALL my Q's were A'd and I implore others to do the same. This will give guys like Computer-User more time to do what they do best and save hours for illiterate pricks like moy.

PS- I tried to rate you on the linked forum but 'computer says noOo'- hence I wrote here. Cheers"

,SoundIgnition,2011-06-01T17:47Z,can i use the dvd-r to burn the iso file?
,gaby7129,2011-07-14T12:55Z,"@cortasia
As the directory containing the .iso  has name starting with a dot (.), it's reconized as a hidden file/directory...
To see it under OSX, you can use this command in the terminal:

$ defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE

Then restart the finder ( $ killall Finder)

To ""undo"" the change, use FALSE instead of TRUE.
Cheers!!
Sorry for the typing mistakes (I'm a poor little Frenchy :-p)

@Computer-User
Many thanks!"
,ceurin,2011-07-16T01:49Z,i have windows 7 ultimate 32 bit atm because of an error i made awhile back... but the computer is supposed to be running 64 bit... so can i use this iso file to upgrade to upgrade to 64 bit?

One question though.
I did not have the update KB971033 before running your activation script. However after running the activation script and rebooting, I checked and it says it is activated ... hooray!.. but I checked the updates again and found the KB971033 update, so I uninstalled it..
Does uninstalling that update all I have to do?"
