,cul,2010-12-20T01:42Z,"Before you steal others work Andreas Pettersson and ""tankaner"" and rename it, maybe you should watch the movie first.
 In this movie you can see in the beginning that the translater and maker of the movie is me 314rat272 and you can see the name of the original website in the top right corner of the movie.
If you have had the original info it could tell that the source was:
   Harry.Potter.And.The.Deathly.Hallows.Part1.TS.XViD-IMAGiNE"

,aikido72,2011-01-02T14:03Z,"What moron rips a dvd in Xvid and splits it in TWO?
Rip the dvd as an .ISO or .IMG for crying out loud. And save the menus."
,aikido72,2011-01-02T14:06Z,"Varför rippa en dvd i xvid plus göra 2 skivor av den?
Idiotiskt anser jag.
Gör om, gör rätt, rippa i .ISO eller .IMG och bevara menyerna."
