 Album Info..: 
 
 Still trying to recapture the success of the eighties in a time of disinterest in 
 their brand of hard rock, Great White released their Sail Away set in 1994. Produced  by Alan Niven and guitarist Michael Lardie, the band toned things down a bit and, instead, went a more acoustic route for this album.
