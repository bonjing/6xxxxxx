JOE HARRIOT MOVEMENT
Recorded in London 1963,
Originally Released on Columbia 33SX1627
Format:Flac


Originally released in 1963 on Columbia, Movement was a follow-up to the earlier, fairly straight-laced Southern Horizons as well as to the experimental Free Form and Abstract. Movement draws upon both styles, the hard bop of the former (with Count Twelve reappearing on this album) and the daring explorations into time, harmony, melody and rhythm of the latter two. The album is roughly evenly divided between the two.

As innovative as the original Coleman quartet, but far less known and appreciated, Harriott was an innovator whose contribution to jazz is still criminally underrecognised
