,kidjersey,2010-12-21T21:14Z,"Before you install the program and use the patch, you have to unplug your internet connection. Once everything is installed/patched. Uncheck the ""check for update"" box in the settings area. Now plug back the internet."
[V],ChattChitto,2010-12-22T00:39Z,"Also if your running Windows VISTA or Windows 7 run the release as Administrator by right clicking on it and then clicking on ""Run As Administrator"""

works everytime for me"
,chris1683,2010-12-30T22:30Z,Was working perfectly until 12/30/10.  Opening the program causes it to crash even after uninstalling and reinstalling.  
,LouCipher,2011-01-04T07:44Z,"copied Inception OK, then a day later getting a message ""AnyDVD exception!"" and it creates a dump file for you to send.

perhaps a a new SlySoft copy protection system?
"
,LouCipher,2011-01-04T07:47Z,"ps. been running Comodo firewall (excellent outbount internet control) to stop AnyDVD using the internet.

Had to uninstall/reinstall Comodo to get rid of AVG rubbish and AnyDVD may have had a chance to get out just once... not sure if my system is blackballed now"
,webspyder,2011-01-04T19:52Z,BIG Thanks ChattChitto!! BIG thanks!! :D
,therock1019,2011-01-06T13:33Z,"ChattChitto - I did everything listed in the instructions, and when I get to the step of patching, a screen pops up saying ""target file not found, try to locate it manually..."" it is looking for anydvdtray.exe but it is looking for it in the mydocuments folder. I tried searching for the anydvd.chk file but it isn't there. What am I doing wrong?"
,oldslow,2011-01-09T02:43Z,"Crap. Installs and patches fine.
Will load and rip dvd.
Will not load a BD. Gives dumpfile error and quits!
Trial version has no issues. Damn program costs a lot of money otherwise I'd buy it!"
,no1453,2011-01-12T04:55Z,"@ChattChitto-  
     Same problem as Andarthief.  After patching (followed instructions on disabling internet, and run as administrator), program will only show in task manager for a second, then exits, no window ever appearing.  The thing is, this is the same problem I had tonight when trying your versions of DvdFab, of which I tried 3 or 4.  In all cases programs open without patch, but after patch programs exit without ever showing a window.  I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium x64.  Could that be the problem?"
,ratpatrol,2011-01-14T01:23Z,It works great! ty
,wrxpirate,2011-02-12T23:48Z,i had the same problem the program crashed or didnt run  at all when it was 'run as administrator' i think that a system file was changed by another program it was workin fine for sometime.  i installed it again on new install of win 7 and sweet everything works again so some other program changed something
