,blherlache,2011-01-10T05:53Z,"i got the same thing. but i clicked ""magnet link"" and it let me download it. got stopped at 97% though because of no seeders! "
,Thomps6o,2011-01-11T02:38Z,"Same exact thing happens stopped at exactly 97%. WTF...bullshit man.  If this torrent ever finishes, I will be stealing it and uploading it as my own, because this is a joke. Uploading something that no one can download.
