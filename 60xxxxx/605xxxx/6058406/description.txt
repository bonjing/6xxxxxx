Description

Frank West, a freelance photojournalist on the hunt for the scoop of a lifetime, pursues a juicy lead to a small suburban town only to find that it is being overrun by zombies!
He escapes to the local shopping mall thinking it will be a bastion of safety, but it turns out to be anything but. It's a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but with full reign over an entire shopping center, Frank can utilize anything to fight off the flesh-hungry mob.

Features:

- Survive in a shopping mall overrun with an army of undead where everything and anything is a weapon.
- Just because itâ€™s a zombie apocalypse doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t be social.
If you fall to the shambling hoard you can send out a distress call via Facebook or Twitter to your friends.
If your friends revive you, they will get extra bonus point. If they don't you can rise as a "NAMED ZOMBIE" in their game. Help each other to survive in this nightmare!!
- Move environmental objects like tables or garbage cans Chow down on various "mall food" to revive health.
- Snatch items from different stores to use as weapons, including golf clubs, fry pans and more!
- Context sensitive controls pop up as need allowing you to perform complex actions with a tap of the button.
- The next scheduled update will add an New character. Stay tuned for more.
