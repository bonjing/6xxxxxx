,PhilnLisa,2010-12-22T07:59Z,"What is this, there is no information on the TG website about this show, and only a tiny mention of it on wiki...

I thought the xmas special was being shown on Boxing day????"
,holdengtsr1,2010-12-22T08:36Z,"Guys, they had all the info on the Top Gear UK Site...also, there are two christmas specials - one on the 21st (American one) and one on boxing day (the Iraq -> Bethlehem one)"
,pgeso,2010-12-22T08:37Z,"@PhilnLisa There are actually two specials, one airing Dec 21 (this one) and the second on Dec 26. The former taking place in NYC and East Coast America, the latter is the actual 'Christmas' special and takes place in Iraq where they follow the Three Wise Men's path."
,Minty_Winty,2010-12-22T18:14Z,"Maybe I missed something but where are episodes 1-6?  I've been waiting for S15 for months now, and now I can only see half of it.  Anywhere I can watch online from Canada (only mention country due to BS sites that block certain countries)?"
