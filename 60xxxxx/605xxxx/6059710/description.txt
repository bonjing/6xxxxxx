Run out of all things Tron to watch? well here's the bottom of the barrel, a 1983 cartoon film made in S. Korea that rips off Tron something rotten. It's a very good VHS rip, I know the DVD is out there somewhere, I just couldn't bring myself to spend real money on it (the ex-rental VHS only cost me ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1).

See the trailer:

Marvel at the final disc battle scene:

Now watch the entire 65 minute film (with the 3 minute trailer at the beginning) and see if you can make it to the end without skipping past the bloody annoying robot girl or gnawing your arms off.


Can't work out how to do the bloody YouTube links (stupid piratebay coding keeps removing them), so just search for Savior of the Earth.
