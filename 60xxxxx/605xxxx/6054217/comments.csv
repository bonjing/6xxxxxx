,mavoUU7,2010-12-20T12:27Z,"@20-40: You, Sir, are the phenomenon. I am a long time fan of your work and have had to become a member today in order to express my appreciation for your outstanding work.  First there was aXXo - now there is 20-40.  My hat is off to you - all the best of the season to you!  A season that you are making very jolly... "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T13:10Z,"Thanks, I am flattered."
,DSIN,2010-12-20T13:13Z,"@20-40: i just saw some of ur rips on demonoid... 
???
apparently some guy is posting ur torrents there.. :(
just wanted to let u know .."
,muthineni,2010-12-20T13:43Z,"@dsin
yeah i just checked..mikenzb is the user
he even upped the tv show packs and everything our guy here has been encoding since 3 days..
Before that he has uploaded some random others.
without credit to the encoder.
@20-40
you sir r on a fire . i have been getting a lot of movies from you this week . keep them coming"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T15:43Z,"@DSIN & muthineni: DSIN asked me before ""why I don't go at Demonoid anymore""...

I answered (paraphrased): ""Name of the site tells who comes there.""

Frankly, I can do shit about. My fans would boycott these torrents anyhow. Only Demonoid staff can do something, but they rather gave a warning to me when I called spade a spade maybe a year back."
,muthineni,2010-12-20T17:05Z,"@twentyforty
I didnt know demonoid had no respect for uploaders.i go there for my anime downloads.
Anyway lets just hope that the guy's d**k falls off degenerating like in the movie planet terror.
never mind these things... u give people good movies and save them shit load of money.
god bless"

I don't know whether i have this problem, but whenever i open your movie folder of your's, the computer gets hanged up... I think it's because of .mp4 format..

And great upload..."
,strmprpl,2010-12-21T15:00Z,"Hi!
My grandpa sends his thanks for the movies.

Can you do a few kiddie movies too sometime? 

Like,
The Prince of Egypt - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120794/
Charlotte's web - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413895/
Babe - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112431/
Bambi - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0034492/
FernGully - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104254/
The secret garden - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108071/

I'd actually prefer something like The sound of music or Mary Poppins.

Do see if you can encode a couple of such movies. Small size.
"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-22T21:24Z,"@dkhere: MP4 is most widely accepted format, mkv is NOT. Your problem (one of few, I guess) is a wrong player. You must learn to Google."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-22T21:49Z,"@strmprpl: Old cartoons cannot be particularly small. Old Disney classics are Full Screen (4:3) and all my encodes of such movies ended badly. Savings are negligent (regarding size are not so big, shrinking 700 MB to 500 MB is a waste of time and quality really suffer if size goes down).

I can send you a .dlc container for jdownloader as e-mail attachment and you can choose the movies and the pace of download."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-24T18:04Z,"@dkhere: Birdie told me:

""Say to that guy to switch thumbnail preview for media files"" OFF."
,dwnldthis,2011-04-30T22:37Z,"you give good movie, thanks"
