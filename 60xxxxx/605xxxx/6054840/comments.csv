,Marcel7,2011-02-27T20:56Z,why 103 files?? think its a fake.......
,dougaldog2002,2011-02-28T13:56Z,"Just saw this and I have to say it's the first film in a long time that's made such an impact on me. Yes, there's a story here, but there are also stories of the everyday, of the beauty that surrounds us without us even realising it. You'll need patience but this is one of those that's worth that extra effort.

A = 10
V = 10
M = 10

NB: For those who are concerned with the number of files, don't be. Just open one with WinZip and all will open into a single, watchable file."
,jp9879,2011-03-05T07:41Z,I would advise people to download the sample first. There is a blurry box in the top right hand side of the screen that some people may find annoying or distracting.
