Remake of FW Murnau's 1922 horror masterpiece, Nosferatu.

When Jonathan Harker journeys to a castle in distant Transylvania with some property papers for the mysterious Count Dracula to sign, his wife Lucy is filled with fear for his safety.

Initially dismissive of gypsy vampire legends, on his arrival at the isolated castle Jonathan learns Lucy was right to be afraid and begins to understand the magnitude of the terror about to be unleashed upon the town he has left behind.
