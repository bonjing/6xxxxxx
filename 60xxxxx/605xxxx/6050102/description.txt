The Hamsters, a blues-rock power trio based in the United Kingdom, are a very 
talented, tight, and well balanced band. 

The guitar playing is excellent, as are the vocals. They do some songwriting, 
but their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations 
of early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.

For our first CD release in 1990 - the 20th anniversary of Jimi's death 
- we decided it had to be an album of his music , and much to our delight, 
that album - Electric Hamsterland - was universally acclaimed in the music press. 
We toured nationally in the Autumn with our friends Doctor Feelgood, and this 
together with the awareness the album created helped spring us from the 
South-East onto the UK circuit.
