Hey thanks for the upload. But would you seed? Please.

No point in doing an upload without seeding...

I'd like to give these guys a full listen to decide if I wanna buy the album. I understand there were limited copies (1000) and as far as I know we can't get this through iTunes.

Thanks."

hey sorry man, but at the time I uploaded no one was downloading so after a week or so I stopped seeding, but am seeding at the moment. Sorry for the slow speed, but enjoy :)"

Thanks so much! It just finished today, as I had not seen your message until earlier. But I appreciate you seeding again :D! YAY! Gonna go listen to this right now.

Thanks again!"

Definitely gotta get this on on CD if at all possible.

BTW, did you see any of the youtube videos of these guys?

Can't wait to see these guys live!"
,lolpp,2011-01-15T15:37Z,"Actually I've never seen the videos, and only listened to the album once since I downloaded it...I've got too much albums right now lol but they're good!"
,aerotoystore,2011-01-15T19:39Z,"Lookup youtube user, or channel name ""eyeempire""

Lots of videos from the studio sessions."
