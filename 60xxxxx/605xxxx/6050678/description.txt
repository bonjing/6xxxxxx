Release Notes:

You can't build an Empire overnight and for the guys of EyeEmpire, it has been 3
years in the making. It all started in 2007 when Corey Lowery (Stuck
Mojo/Stereomud/Dark New Day) and B.C. Kochmit (Switched) started to construct
what would eventually become the foundation of this Empire. Along with the help
of Morgan Rose (Sevendust) on drums, they started to write and experiment with
their sound.

After 2 years of writing and searching for the right voice of their Empire, they
found Donald Carpenter (Submersed) in October of 2009. Recently, acclaimed
drummer Will Hunt (Evanescence/Dark New Day) has entered the fold on the eve of
introducing their debut album Moment Of Impact. With a wealth of experience and
talent, they have set out to reach new heights and fulfill a dream that bleeds
from their collective commitment. This is their "Moment of Impact".....
