Please seed!!!"
,banan2k5,2011-02-23T14:51Z,"This is truly the best quality I've ever come across when it comes to Family Guy, crystal clear dvd-rips in mkv format with english subs, would be very awesome if you upped season 8 in the same quality when the whole season has been released on dvd, this far only the first 8 eps are out afaik"
,hauntnut,2011-03-15T19:39Z,"The quality is great, but just a word of warning: for some reason, a lot of the episodes skip and become pixelated. I don't believe this is an issue with my computer; I watch even larger movie files with no problem, and my system is fully equipped to handle all video formats. Is anyone else having this issue?"
