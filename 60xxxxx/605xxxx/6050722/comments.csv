,flash_g,2011-01-03T13:58Z,Any tips on good games in this torrent ?
[T],droidip,2011-01-03T21:24Z,"@flash_g Try to find good games in market you want to play, almost all good games from the market is included in this torrent. 

But my favorite games i 4playerreactor and Solipskier."
,agglos,2011-01-09T12:22Z,do i need to jailbreak my phone or something like that in order to play them?
[T],droidip,2011-01-09T18:42Z,"@agglos No, just follow the instructions. "
,vladftw,2011-01-10T00:44Z,Thanks for the upload. Downloading now. Can't wait to have some of the better games for my Optimus!
,vladftw,2011-01-16T04:43Z,"I found an app that makes it a lot easier to install these games, it is called 'easy app installer'. It sets it up so each app is loaded up one after another to prompt an install. Just thought this might help someone else that is new to these things."
,jm413d,2011-01-17T17:37Z,Slightly misleading with the instructions... not all phones support non-market apps. you have to root your device and sideload them  http://forum.xda-developers.com/ should help those who don't have that option
,NBS93,2011-03-02T21:31Z,"Yeah unfortunately my Samsung Captivate doesn't allow you to install non-market apps directly. Thanks uploader, and jm413d for the rooting link."
,killmove,2011-03-17T04:53Z,"@droidip hi, great torrent by the way. Downloaded the everlands game under 10 paid HD games, but it seems to be the lite version, pls how do I get it to the full version? Is there a code or something. Sorry am a newbie at this. Thanks"
,TheVoltageBobby,2011-03-22T20:57Z,Do i need to root my htc desire HD?
,ddamienie,2011-04-01T09:04Z,"to everyone asking about how to install them, the rooting link is helpful, however, it is NOT neccesary


most android devices will allow you to install apk files

however, if you want one that doesnt, samsung captivate for example, you will need to sideload them. you do not need to root the device in order to side load however

simply enabled usb debugging, get a side load app, i recommend http://www.androidcentral.com/swm

and install the apk, simply as that"

,sankirna,2011-04-24T11:53Z,Can it be Installed directly to my Galaxy Pop via the Droid Explorer?
,f.tremblay94,2011-05-20T22:12Z,"Does it work for Androids without sd card slot, like the Nexus S? "
,mumihp,2011-05-26T17:50Z,"Hey Thanks for this, I'm not that familar with the android market or os as I tend to get apps for my ipod touch, but got a new android phone so theses apps will be great on my new phone, thanks again. "
,lokolokomo,2011-06-10T02:58Z,"Pls.Help,can this work on my Acer A500 iCONIA Tab.and how to install,sorry Im new in this field."
,r1ntse,2011-06-20T17:05Z,"yes, you can install it on your acer iconia tab.
if some of the games don't go full-screen you should download 'spare parts' from the android-market and tap the 'compatibility mode' setting

They all work on my Galaxy Tab ^^"

,Dude014,2011-09-22T22:28Z,@ orion0814 - It's a gamble. Some do some don't. like i said most of theses apps are free now. Go to the Android Market on your puter and you'll see which will work for your Sony Xperia Play when you click on the description.
