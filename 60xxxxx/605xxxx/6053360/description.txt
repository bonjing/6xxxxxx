A Clockwork Orange is a 1962 dystopian novella by Anthony Burgess. Written from the perspective of a seemingly unapologetic protagonist, the novel also contains an experiment in language: Burgess creates teenage slang of the not-too-distant future.

In 1998, the Modern Library ranked A Clockwork Orange 65th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.
