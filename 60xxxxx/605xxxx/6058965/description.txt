In 1997, the band embarked on a world tour promoting their then-new album Black Moon, which included this performance at Montreux. It is the only film from this tour available. The set includes ELP classic from across their career. Also included are rare tracks that have never appeared on ELP studio albums.
The booklet features individual sleeve notes from the band members.
Comprised of Niceâ€™s keyboard player Keith Emerson, King Crimsonâ€™s bassist Greg Lake, and the Atomic Roosterâ€™s drummer Carl Palmer, 1970s supergroup Emerson, Lake & Palmer crafted expansive, near-orchestral prog-rock influenced by jazz and classical music. 
Disbanding in 1979 and embarking on various solo careers, the trio reunited in the 1990s to produce a new album, BLACK MOON, for which they toured extensively in 1997. 
This concert captures Emerson, Lake & Palmer at the Montreux Jazz Festival that same year, performing a career-spanning selection of songs that includes â€œKarn Evil 9,â€ â€œHoedown,â€ â€œLucky Man,â€ â€œTarkus,â€ â€œFanfare for the Common Man,â€ and many more.
