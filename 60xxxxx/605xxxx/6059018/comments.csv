,_mune,2011-01-03T04:24Z,"I believe every media player allows for vid and audio sync. I prefer VLC (It is free and open source) and is compatible with pretty much every type of media file. VLC allows you to sync.

Thanks for your contribution. Please SEED!"

,ph1nn,2011-03-13T03:05Z,"Had to delete this. It plays like its constantly fastforwarding on my PS3 but normal sounding audio, it's all out of sync and messed up.

PS3 plays almost everything I throw at it with PS3 Media Server, so this is a disappointment."
[T],fachman,2011-04-01T00:55Z,update your ps3media server software and dont talk everyone how uneducated man you are. It plays fine on PS3.
