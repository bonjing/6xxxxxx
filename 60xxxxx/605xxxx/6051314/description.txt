Plot:

Bhaskaran (Arya) is a happy-go-lucky guy, who is yet to complete his B. A. Degree, writing arrear examinations annually for years. His only friend is Nallathambi (Santhanam) who owns a Hair Cutting Saloon named Thalai Thalapathi Saloon which he received as a dowry for marrying a two-month pregnant woman.
Bhaskaran lives with his mother, Sivakami (Lakshmi Ramakrishnan), brother Saravanan (Panchu Subbu) who is a successful veterinarian and sister, Nithya (Monisha). When his brother marries Nandhini (Vijayalakshmi), he gets to meet Nandhini's younger sister Chandrika (Nayantara) and wishes to marry her. When he approaches his family for a chance, everyone talks very frankly of his unemployed status which rankles him and causes him to leave his house to prove himself.
With the support of Nallathambi, he establishes a tutorial for Class 10 students and despite early setbacks makes it work and ensures that he makes a very heavy profit on the deal, while also convincing Chandrika, who eventually reciprocates his love. However despite all this, Chandrika's father is against her marriage with Bhaskaran for a reason which is revealed in the end.
