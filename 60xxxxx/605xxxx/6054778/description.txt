  Black money and how it affects the country's  
  economy in general and the common man in      
  particular form the basis of the film.        
  The story is aimed at creating awareness about
  black money which hampers the country's       
  development.                                  
  Rajini (Sivaji) raises a banner of revolt     
  against this social evil eating into the      
  vitals of society. He is greatly disturbed    
  by the state of affairs.
