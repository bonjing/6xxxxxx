WAD file is NTSC-U version, didn't run on PAL softmod, get it working after conversion with ""Free the Wads"" (http://endlessparadigm.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=11457)"
,matiemanre4,2010-12-29T04:13Z,How do you install onto the Wii?
,Grendler7,2011-01-20T08:26Z,"You can install the .wad file by using multi-mod-manager, or some similar mod managing program.

Needless to say, your Wii needs to be softmodded.

If you have no idea what that is, then you should go to www.wiihacks.com and study up. Honestly, with some patience and common sense, you can be up and modding in no time."

Sorry. Ahem.

File is good, installed with MMM 1.7 under softmodded 4.3 Wii.
