                    Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May  
                    compare the Mercedes SLS, the Porsche 911 GT3  
                    RS and the Ferrari 458 Italia in an epic road  
                    trip up America's east coast. Along the way  
                    they undertake a series of challenges    
                    culminating in a fight to find the fastest way  
                    into New York, all in the name of crowning the  
                    world's greatest sports car. Plus, another  
                    celebrity takes to the track as the star in a  
                    Reasonably Priced Car.
