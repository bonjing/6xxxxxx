SON SEALS LIVING IN THE DANGER ZONE
Label Alligator
Orig Year 1991
Format: Flac



Son Seals will always be regarded as one of Chicago's and the blues' greatest artists. From his debut recording, when he burst on the scene as a fully formed and mature artist, up to his last recordings, his stature as a leading blues voice grew with each new album he released. His untimely death in December 2004 robbed the blues of a major voice.

The guitarist keeps his string of consecutive fine releases alive with a studio-cut disc that sizzles with bandstand-level velocity. "Frigidaire Woman," "Woman in Black," and "Bad Axe" rate with the highlightsâ€™. ~ Bill Dahl
