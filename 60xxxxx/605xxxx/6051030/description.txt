Hi.

I am trying to creat a game based on "Superboy and the Legion of Super Heroes".

This is a early alpha version of the game, more like a presentation of all the heroes.

It need a lot of work until I can start write more game-code and I need to get some feedback from what I have done so fare. 

I also need some help with some characters (Wildfire), but any help to make this project become reality would be great.

Alpha version contains "Idle" animation of all figures shown (except Wildfire). Blok and Phantom Girl contain 2 more animations. When in menu they start autimatic.

Installer is 394 Mb and a uninstaller is provided. Installed on disk it is 458 Mb. 

You need a screen resolution of 1024x768 or better.

Tested on Vista and Windows 7.

Music:
Theme - The Legion of Superheroes 
The Moon And The Superhero
Theme - Batman & Superman Adventures
