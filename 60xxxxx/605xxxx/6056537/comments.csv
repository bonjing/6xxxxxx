Buiseness leaders lie (to their employees) as well, although there is no pressure to get elected.
I'm sure you've exposed many such lies yourself.
They lie because they think it's the right thing to do 'under the circumstances' and because they believe their employees/constituents won't know they're getting shafted.
Any thoughts on this?"

That'll teach me not to write comments when I'm drunk."
