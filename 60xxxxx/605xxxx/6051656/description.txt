PLOT:


Two Chicago firefighter brothers who don't get along have to work together while a dangerous arsonist is on the loose. 

Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey (Kurt Russel) and Brian McCaffrey (William Baldwin) star as two feuding siblings carrying on a heroic family tradition as Chicago firefighters. But when a puzzling series of arson attacks are reported, they are forced to set aside their differences to solve the mystery surrounding these explosive crimes.
   

TAGLINE:


Silently behind a door, it waits.  One breath of oxygen and it explodes in a deadly rage.   In that instant it can create a hero... or cover a secret.
