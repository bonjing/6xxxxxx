,Dr-nidO,2011-01-23T09:19Z,"hi bro...
great work as usual...

saw your comment about some free time between movie releases and i thought to make a suggestion/request...

the thing is between you and guys like RiddlerA, YIFY and pluto999 one can usually find most of the movies in great quality and small size
But its damn HARD to find a tv series in good quality and a size bellow 4 gb...

so if you have the time, can you consider doing a few seasons of tv serails...

if you can i would like to request
Legend of the seeker
leverage

keep up the great work and +1 t quality"

and i`d love to know one thing, anyone who is trying to hep me. Thank you in advance! 

I have some of the DVD movies and i`d love to rip it and keep it safe in my computer...i tried with many ripping software but then the end product would end up lager than what i actually want. 

i just need to rip a movie from DVD to a sing file [avi/mkv] but at around the size either 700 or maybe 400 like here. Anyone? got any descent software tips and tricks for that. 

Thank you!!!"
