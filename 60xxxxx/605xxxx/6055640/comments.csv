,JoshL11185,2010-12-24T20:24Z,"Adeythrash, you're a moron. There's not even a single rar file in here."
,Adeythrash,2010-12-26T10:10Z,"My bad josh, had a torrent downloaded with exactly the same file name, that DOES have a passworded rar.

Whilst I don't consider myself to be a moron, I quite clearly didn't get this one right. :)"

Well, Jarre and Glass are the fathers of all electronic music that exists today. So, perhaps Daft Punk was heavily influenced by them."

JoshL11185 good work Thanks!!  FLAC is the best. 

Excellent sound track. Unusual about the arrangements of the principal and his subsequent works.
I think that's one of the best soundtracks I've heard recently.
Music is the soul.

Adeythrash you fucking idiot. There is no rar files you dumb prick. Do not lie to people."
