My OCD-like nature requires me to have all the Tron stuff, from everywhere. So if you're like me, you can get it here. iTunes bouns tracks, Amazon bonus track, the Special Edition 2-disc set in FLAC, and the extras ISO from the single disc CD called TRON: Legacy Enhancement (Stupid Walmart lists it as a 23rd track. It is not). Also, some of the scans from the Insert of the single disc CD. I also included some of the remixes I thought were cool. The End of Line remix has some lines from the MCP when he's talking to Sark about Flynn (1982 Tron), and the Derezzed remix makes that awesome song last a lot longer.
