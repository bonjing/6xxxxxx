Here are 3 Vitamin C videos originally ripped to SVCD. I re-encoded the audio to AC3.

So the videos are:

Video = 480x480 MPEG-2 NTSC 29.97 fps 4:3

Audio = DD2 AC3 224 Kbps @ 48 KHz

PLEASE READ:

Last Nite is a decent, complete TVRip with CDAudio source.

The Itch was originally a DVDRip but it is only part of the video for some reason.

The video for Smile starts off messed up. It's just how it is....then it gets to a little better quality.

Basically, I upped this only because the videos are rare, hard to find. I wouldn't normally release videos like this.



Enjoy and please seed!
