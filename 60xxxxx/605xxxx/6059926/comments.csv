,franco8102,2010-12-23T16:32Z,"one question, is this version longer ? have you used the the Russian DVD ? "
,eltoru,2010-12-27T17:23Z,I used the russion dvd. The beginning of the russian version is not the same as the English one. So I had to adapt the russion video to the english sound. So it is 1 hour 20 minutes. like the English verison.
,eltoru,2010-12-27T17:26Z,"The quality of video is fair, better than VHS but not HD. 740-480 but recised to PALs . Nero program that was used for the cut made the quality decrease a bit.."
,franco8102,2010-12-28T01:15Z,"Thanks bro. there are to Russian DVDs. one pal one ntsc. i have the ntsc. ( gold cover. i think yours are blue ? that's pal.  ) mine is OK picture, but as you sad some scenes are missing.

,eltoru,2010-12-28T02:10Z,"Hi Franco,
You may be disapointed. I think the quality is like you you already have. I can only give you the adopted cut to the english sound. "

Please guys"
,CLK669,2011-03-31T21:40Z,"Hey guys,

Be advised this movies had been filmed 3 times. Once with Russian language, once in Romanian and once in English... The 3 movies are different you will never be able to synchronyse English track with either Romanian or Russian movie...  ;-)"
,eltoru,2011-05-02T22:03Z,"You are right CLK669. They can not be synchronized. I'd had to cut the whole film together to map the english language. The result is far from perfect.. I was far much more work than I ever could imagine. 
I have just found the romanian version with perfect picture, but as the language is wrong it is useless for my nostalgia vibrations.
If anyone find the original Engish version, please let me know. "
