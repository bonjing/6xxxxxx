,ssj3jon,2011-03-24T20:03Z,"Hey Loser, Stop posting this torrent into other torrents asshole"
,jbscythe,2011-06-01T22:56Z,"uhhh, excuse me.    FUCK YOU ssj3jon.  lots of people do that.  It's just to get the word out.  you got a problem with something, then I suggest you go suck a dick.  quit bothering people in the community with your tired ass bullshit.  nobody's forcing you to download it or even read posts.  I'm sure there's a lot of others out there who appreciate the fact that I took the time to do  all this.

piss off, fag!"
,jbscythe,2011-06-01T23:24Z,one more thing.  you don't even have any torrents so you aren't contributing.  at least I have done something that nobody else has ever done and that makes it unique.

,jbscythe,2011-07-07T19:40Z,thanks for your input mrnintendo15.  good to know this works on modern systems.
,noxnoctum,2011-07-26T11:46Z,"hey bro thanks for uploading man, lost my copy but I loved this game (even tho everyone else seemed to hate it lol).

One thing though... I can't get it to run at a high resolution! I don't even see the options under video options. Where do I change this?

thanks"

I have a problem with the sound. The background music gets stuck in a loop, and I can't make it stop. Reducing the music volume to zero does nothing, and the setting doesn't get saved. Anyone else getting this?"
