Encoder's Note's
Ok so i dropped into vdubmod, i increased the; gamma, contrast, brightness & saturation.
Then i sharpened and changed the colours with a RGB EQ.
I done a little bit of work on the audio, its not great but it will do.
(the audio is realy quiet in some parts, but in others it can be very loud so u may have to keep adjusting the volume)
Well the video is prety good, its not perfect but deffinatley watchable.
