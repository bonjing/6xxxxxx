,Joe1Fixer,2011-01-15T15:32Z,"Matt,  For screenies, get the latest SnagIt from here at TPB, then use VLC and pause where you wanted the screen-shot.  Then SnagIt and use its  Editor to save the image to a more suitable name.  SnagIt saves to PNG format, so you shoud  save as a .JPG format.

By movie info, if you mean its format, use write down the paramater you used during conversion, such as XVID, AC3, and etc.  But if you mean info about the content, then get it from IMDB.com and stick them in the description section when you upload it.

Also, be sure to create a folder for each movie, and when you u/l, browse and select the folder, then everything in the folder will be uploaded.

Thanks for this up.
