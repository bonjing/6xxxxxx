- Obama Flip Flop: FCC Vote Could End Net Neutrality

When Obama was running for office three years ago, he pledged to support the principle of a free and open internet saying, "I will take a backseat to no one with regards to net neutrality." Fast forward to today and the FCC Chair that Obama appointed is leading a vote that could end net neutrality. Today's pivotal vote will decide on a new set of regulations that critics say will create a two-tiered system for the Internet. We speak with Craig Aaron of the media reform group Free Press.

- Part II...Feminists Debate Sexual Allegations Against Julian Assange

We play Part II of the debate between feminists Jaclyn Friedman and Naomi Wolf over the sex crime allegations against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Freed on bail in London, Assange hasn't been charged, but is wanted in Sweden for questioning on sexual crimes allegations. Assange and his supporters have said the case is part of a wider conspiracy to discredit him because of his work with WikiLeaks, but some in the feminist community have accused WikiLeaks supporters of minimizing violence against women.
