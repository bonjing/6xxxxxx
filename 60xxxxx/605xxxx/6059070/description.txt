2010 Constant Companion    CD  No Quarter  NOQ025-2

"Songs of poetry, harmony and sweetness and the honeyed, craggy voice of the classic American country singer. Paisley's perspective is that of the Canadian outsider, seeing America anew whilst being fully immersed in its history and myths. Like The Band he re-presents American music history without the trappings of fashion and, like the Young of After The Goldrush uses his outsider status to ruminate on America's fate" - Mojo
