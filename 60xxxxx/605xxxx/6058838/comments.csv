I have a Q?
Imgburner and some others says it has illegal layer break position. The rip is ok to view on the computer, but not to burn. It says something about multi-angle support is not allowed.

Info of movie: It has subtitles in English, German, Dutch, Hindi and Turkish. 
Audio in English, German, Hindi and Turkish. 
The quality is excellent.

,gurubai,2010-12-28T08:24Z,whats the actual resolution? is it the resolution of screesnhot original resolution? please someone answer.
,webspyder,2011-01-20T08:14Z,"I have the same probl. as scratch. When I burn it to a duallayer dvd the burning stops at layer switch. This occurs in two different computers. It works fine when watching on the computer.

Hint: If you want to burn this film, dont dwn load this one. Something is 'missing' or went wrong in the ripping process.
