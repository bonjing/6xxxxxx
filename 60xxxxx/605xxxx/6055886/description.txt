We believe that as people living

in the United States it is our

responsibility to resist the injustices

done by our government

in our names

Not in our name

will you wage endless war

there can be no more deaths

no more transfusions

of blood for oil

Not in our name

will you invade countries

bomb civilians, kill more children

letting history take its course

over the graves of the nameless

Not in our name

will you erode the very freedoms

you have claimed to fight for

Not by our hands

will we supply weapons and funding

for the annihilation of families

on foreign soil

Not by our mouths

will we let fear silence us

Not by our hearts

will we allow whole peoples

or countries to be deemed evil

Not by our will

and Not in our name

We pledge resistance

We pledge alliance with those

who have come under attack

for voicing opposition to the war

or for their religion or ethnicity

We pledge to make common cause

with the people of the world

to bring about justice

freedom and peace

Another world is possible

and we pledge to make it real

Not in Our Name
