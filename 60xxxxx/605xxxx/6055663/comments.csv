Haven't heard about it, but will download and listen to them, so I'll hear hopefully if they are new, but would be great if you could enlighten us, since you uploaded it, and perhaps knows more about it?

Btw, you do not hjave the new better version (without hte rap) of the song ""blue ganster""?

Thanks a lot in advance!"
,Dragonite_9,2011-01-09T07:33Z,"Okej these Bonus songs for the deluxe edition.. man you can NOT call them Michael Jackson songs!! That's just leaching of his name FFS!

Those songs are some BAD (imo) rapper named Cans, rapping 85% and channeled in some Jackson 5 around that time one of the songs, a bit here and there, and the other, sound like a very very young person, if that is MJ even.. can hardly hear the voice for all the music!
BIGGEST LETDOWN FOR BONUS SONGS EVER, expected Michael Jackson, got some sucky rapper namned Cans FFS!!
But, if it's a real deluxe edition, it's not your fault, so thanks for the effort man!

BUT DAMN, THOSE EXTRA SONGS SUCKED, JUST RAP, and I love rap too, but that shit SUCKED, so frustrated I got since I was looking forward to hear MJ's voice, but waited and waited..
Just had to make this comment about it, that frustrated with that shit I was... :P "
