The TRUTH 5 is all about the planning, the preparation, the hunting, and the fun. Warm temperatures throughout the winter had Primos hunting on days where the ducks were not very active, but through persistence, and the enjoyment of waterfowl hunting, They had a memorable season. Don't worry, They didn't show you the slow days, they didn't make the cut. Join Primos on The TRUTH 5 as they bring you with Them to Texas, Mississippi, Montana, and Canada. 100 Minutes
