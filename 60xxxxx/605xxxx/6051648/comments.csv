OMG....wonderful quality & file size!
this is vastly superior to the axxo rip (which was awesome in it's day)"

,repeat123,2011-03-04T19:36Z,"I'm sorry but I downloaded it and it is not HD quality! This is very bad quality!
Do not download this, no hd!"
,sev_on_tpb,2011-04-12T09:30Z,"From someone who downloaded both this one and the aXXo DVDrip, after doing a comparison, this version appears to have better video quality.

(For example: the video on the computer screens at around 2:40 (in the movie) are blurry on the other one, crisper on this one."

,1337kage,2011-05-12T18:14Z,"I'm confused about how this can be 720p when the size is less than 700 MiB. Impressive, or a scam?"
,Tchoob,2011-06-26T21:02Z,"@1337kage

It is a clean file, very high quality. I don't understand it much myself."
,kykyred,2011-08-02T09:02Z,"excellent quality and as for people wondering about the size to quality ots because of the codex, mkv and mp4 are neck and neck but mkv has more features and actually supports compression using mp4 codex so mkv is inadvertingly better but mp4 will win out in the end because its more widly supported as mkv is a new format that some uploaders are beginning to use. I personally preferr mkv because it has a ton of features but many programs still are buggy with this format

both formate offer much higher compression ratios and the resolution doesnt matter too much only the bitrate"
