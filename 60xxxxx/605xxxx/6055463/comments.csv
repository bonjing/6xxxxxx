Seen it at down2load""

I don't get it.  Is this a statement or indirect question directing us to have a look at your torrent list?  Or were looking through your uploads and saw it there and thought to yourself 'cool I just saw The Tourist here in my list of stuff'?  Weird because you would of probably put it there.  

If not then perhaps someone has hacked into your account to upload this movie for you.  But then why would they do this?  Maybe they like you and want to help out or they might be trying to frame you with copyright infringement.  Unlikely, so another theory is that you have multiple personalities and one of your more generous indenties uploaded it while the personality whom posted the comment doesn't remember what they did.  Even thou they are one in the same.  

""Seen it at down2load.""  What does this mean?  Could it be answered by logic, or are we witness to the supernatural.  Weird or what?

This is a good cam copy, not a bad movie either although i thought it was a little slow, but the ending is surprising and i think Angelina Jolie is glowing hot in this one :)  "
,Mr.mofo,2011-01-03T15:39Z,"Sorcher ... dawnforged . com is a fucking picture hosting site, not a filesharing blag like here "

You should take up your reading classes again, Sorcher never advertised the site as filesharing, he advertised it as a alternative instead of the dead links for the I M A G E hosting..."

,XHaloX,2011-01-12T18:18Z,"to all stupid SOBs who complain about the quality.

its obviously stated in the title and description that its a TS, so quality will not be anything near DVD but it will be still watchable for people who cant wait to get it on DVD or need to scan the movie if it worth going to theaters.

So like every torrent, stop whining stupid fuckers, nobody asked you if the quality meets your standards or not."
