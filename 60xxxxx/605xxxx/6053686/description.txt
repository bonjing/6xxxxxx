With this CD, you have all of the Ramones' best songs (Beat on the brat, Blitzkrieg bop, I wannna be sedated) in one place. The band combined a raw punk rock sound with their own brand of energy and enthusiasm. The lyrics are original often cynical (see Judy is a punk and Beat on the brat.) While listening to this album, I realized what a great bassist the late Dee Dee Ramone was (R.I.P. man.) 
This compliation also has the hit ''Pet Sematary'' that was written for the Stephen King movie and wasn't included on any of their studio albums. 
So what are you waiting for? Have it NOW!
