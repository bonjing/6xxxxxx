,PhilLesh12,2010-12-23T02:48Z,"Yeah, that's like saying ""The Town"" is just a copy of the Deniro/Pacino movie ""Heat"".

It would be more appropriate to say ""If you like this movie, you'll probably like Red Dawn, also."""
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-23T05:24Z,That sucks that 2 and 3 don't come out until 2012 and 2013.  This is a good story.
,stephenp65,2010-12-23T06:51Z,Red Dawn is a pathetic movie. C. Thomas Howell going all Rambo. Do yourselves a favour and watch this one instead.
