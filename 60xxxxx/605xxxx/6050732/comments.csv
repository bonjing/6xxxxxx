,tolinho7,2012-01-15T03:36Z,"Very nice game! But i have a little problem. 

After the first level,game freezes in the loading screen.Then i tried to load my saved game,as  the first level was completed but freezes again.The same happend with Neogamma R8.What can i do?

I have a Wii 4.2E and a Transcend 8gb usb flash drive.I am using  WiiFlow 2.1 via Homebrew and i installed that iso to my usb through WBFS manager.I have installed cIOS249 from WAD manager. 

*i also want to know if  Wester Digital My Passport essential 500gb usb 3.0 is compatible with wiiflow and works perfect with Wii.
Thanks in advance!"
