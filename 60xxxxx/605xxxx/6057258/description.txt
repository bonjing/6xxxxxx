[Inspector Sloan, Book 1, 1966]

Sister Anne has been thrown down the cellar stairs of the convent, and Inspector Sloan wonders who in God's name would want to murder a cloistered nun? Sloan's task is complicated by the unusual witnesses - 50-plus discreet, identically dressed nuns, each of whom has an assumed name and a past secular life!
