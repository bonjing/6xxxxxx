Just kiddin - wow I got turned around after watching this brilliant film. Go gadget go."

Well no, we hat to be liberated and what did that do .

Its still one Europe ,but not a clean one its infected with all sort's off foreign bacteria .
Mostly coming from North Africa ,East Europe (between the German border(on the east) and white Russia .
They Steal ,Rob,Murder, Rape (even children )Infecting our live standard with they're scum methods.

So the Nazi's(ugly worth I like to call them Distinguish ,well disciplined ,great dressed  firm talking people with a great view )killed Jews .
I know that is wrong (think about the cost alone )
But everybody did that throughout history So there most be something wrong with them ???
In fact still is .

Stealing from Auschwitz how sick you need to be .And probably sell it on E-bay .
Because it's all about money and betray with these people ,they sell they're own mother .

Wow ,also got turned around watching this film 
Or not ??"
