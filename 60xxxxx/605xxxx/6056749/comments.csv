Remember, don't SMASH and GRAB, it's selfish! I've been kind enough to pay for the subscription to USH to download this stuff, and am sharing this with you, FREE, so SHARE, and SEED! It's what BitTorrent was designed for!"
,Tidosho,2010-12-21T16:51Z,"@Pippelpop: Thanks for your encouragement! I actually have a site rip of SuperSexyHeroines knocking around too, but it's from 2009, and not the latest as I stopped joining when Jon started obsessing over the comics and not photoshoots, so once this one's going nicely I'll upload it for you all!"
,Tidosho,2010-12-22T00:56Z,"@EdjOfSanity: Yeah I've seeded 2 full copies so far. I had to delete the other torrent because I didn't zip the sets up, and PirateBay's uploader tries to scan the filelist in the .torrent file, there are over 6,000 files so it timed out and corrupted the download link.

It's fixed 100% now, and I'll be seeding for another few months yet. I might get an up to date rip in the meantime, because there's been another 6-7 sets at USH since my rip."
,Tidosho,2010-12-23T02:37Z,"Thanks, guys! Keep your eyes open for my 2009 SuperSexyHeroines.com site rip, I'm in the process of organising all the sets into folders and naming them!"
,Tidosho,2010-12-24T02:59Z,"@kimm_23f: I had a feeling it would be, lots of secret spandex superheroine lovers out there, I'm one of them, and would love a Supergirl outfit like the preview one for my girlfriend, I'd never let her take it off!

I'm doing an up to date rip of USH, and will wait till the end of January when my subscription runs out to post it so it's up to date as of then. My 2009 SuperSexyHeroines rip is almost organised, it'll be done just after Christmas, as I'm taking Xmas out for family time."
