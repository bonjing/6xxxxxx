The Krankhoff one is awful though. I don't think I've ever heard such a self-absorbed, foul destruction of a song in my life. It's like the DJ could give a flying fuck about the melody of the original track. He was going to do his angry 5 minute bass vomit solo no matter what, and maybe throw some La Roux in there in the quiet spots. Actually, I take that back, it sounds like La Roux was a nuisance he had to put up with so he just played two completely different songs at the same time.
It's like a little bratty kid screaming ""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep"" over your favorite song on the radio."
