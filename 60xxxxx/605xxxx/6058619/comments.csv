,aldrinstryder,2010-12-23T08:28Z,quality?
,aradiel,2010-12-23T10:34Z,"Agreed that the story is taken almost directly from Red Dawn, but RD is kind of stupid in places.

Yeah, let's stand out in the open while we yell Wolverines! and a helicopter guns us down. He'd have had better luck trying to attack the helicopter with a sword."
,Sayril,2010-12-23T22:04Z,"I hope this movie is good, I've read the books and I hope I won't be disappointed."
,Sayril,2010-12-23T22:10Z,"aradiel and jzamfl, the story is taken from a series of books.

Tomorrow, When the War Began
The Dead of The Night
The Third Day, The Frost
Darkness, Be My Friend
Burning For Revenge
The Night Is For Hunting 
The Other Side of Dawn

Then followed by The Ellie Chronicles

While I Live
Incurable
Circle of Flight 

All of these books are great and I really recommend them!"
,kbowk2,2010-12-24T06:08Z,"""Red Dawn is better"".  It hardly has a plot.  The Wolverines just go around killing ppl without much hasle at all (till near the end).  You probably watched it as a kid and thought it was really good back then and have fond memories like myself and Police Academy.  Go watch it again if I watched any Police academy now I would be like 'Wow, what a load of crap'.  

Red Dawn is a shit movie, with a shit plot/lack of plot and stupid ending.  

And now back to this movie.....

I read the first two books of this series a few years back when I still had hair on my head rather than on my ass.  

Not expecting the best movie of all time slapping its junk in my face and me like yeah, lapping it up.  But, I'm looking forward to revisiting the story and seeing what they did with it.

Red Dawn, good, your a common cheesedick aren't you?  Or a proud Rural American in which case your a cheesedick anywaz.  Your mum jzamfl, your mum indeed."
,CsiguszT1000,2010-12-25T11:26Z,"If it's taken from a DVD or a BlueRay disc, is it possible to upload the subtitles somewhere?
It would be a great help even in english.
Thanks!"
