Beginnings was a 1973 reissue of the Allman Brothers Band's first two albums, The Allman Brothers Band and Idlewild South, made to capitalize on the band's popularity since those records had first come out. Beginnings also included extensive liner notes by writer Jean-Charles Costa that gave many fans their first coherent view of the band's history, as well as useful guidelines for how to tell Duane Allman's guitar parts from Dickey Betts'. The front cover depicts them at one of their many famous performances at the Fillmore East.
