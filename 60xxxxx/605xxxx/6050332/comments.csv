[V],GoodFilms,2011-01-19T23:38Z,Fuck off you ungrateful cunt. Sinners release + Russian audio. SO WHAT?! Select the English track! Fucking dumass.
,jbrodster,2011-07-27T09:55Z,"the description clearly says ""SELECT AUDIO #3"" for English... so stop complaining if you can't follow directions.

great torrent, fast download. such a good movie!"
,minjigga,2011-12-30T03:29Z,"@zee5 & @GoodFilms
I think what sgleder was referring to was being misled about what he downloaded. Also, if you're going to upload a torrent with Russian Audio, you might as well put that in the title to help those who only speak Russian to be able to find this torrent easier.. at least in the NFO.

No need to call people names, try to bottle your hatred up a little bit.. it's.. unsightly."
