Can I remove the .xml file from the ISO without it affecting the installation?

The root folder also contains Daz's 1.9.5 loader which is excellent."

You might not know, but might as well give it a try and ask you!

,kims44,2010-12-23T02:44Z,"Ello there Computer-User. ^^ I read through the comments at first, didn't want to bother you unless I needed too. Anywho, problem goes: I'm trying to install it from a USB flash drive, so I loaded the ISO with the included program and that works just fine, so nice work there. All though I can boot the installation, when it's done loading the setup of Win7, it pops up a message about it needing some hardware drivers (or something amongst those lines, didn't really pay all too much attention to it, so excuse that). So it lets me browse through the drives on the PC. USB flash drives, all the hard drives, CD readers etc etc, but I really have no idea or whatsoever of what I'm looking for. :/ Anyway, speed and everything with the torrent is awesome, so cred for that mate. :) Appreciate any help I can get, would be shiny with Win7. ^^ Cheers."

if i try restore sessions or whatever they are it does nothing, just black screen and that's all...

Soo i'm really confused here i think i might be able to format it but i already copied the files to my system and deleted from external hard drive and those files are really important(school stuff, and so on.)

I really need to find a solution to fix that problem, and don't suggest me format.

Computer-User i really trusted your torrents and followed every single instruction, but look what i've ran into now...

/i'm typing this message from my other computer/"
,Speal.,2010-12-30T16:18Z,"Okay 2 hours of messing and it seems i've got rid of this problem... for now atleast.

i unplugged all USB devices and plugged in PS2 keyboard and mouse, that process managed me to get into safe mode.
Then i made backups of necessary files and tried system restore which of course failed giving me error ""0x80071a91""
but i still restarted in hope that it would change something, and for my luck it booted normally, but gave me bunch of errors related system restore and groove monitor.
So i turned groove monitor off from msconfig startup and turned off my system, plugged in all USB devices again and it booted normally.

Sounds like an anomaly of somekind because it didn't need any serious work to fix the problem.

But for now it seems to be fixed and i'm enjoying Windows 7 again."
,new_learner,2010-12-30T19:12Z,"computer-user. ok I download your window vista now I burned out the disc, now I put the disc into my pc to install is that correct or you want me to format the machine first. please give the procedure."
,Speal.,2010-12-30T20:10Z,"new_learner

It's always better to format first, so here are the procedure steps.

1. Restart PC
2. Go to BIOS, it should be ""del"" to gain access to BIOS.
3. Change First boot device to CD-Rom instead of Hard Drive
4. Save and exit BIOS.
5. Insert Windows Disk
6. Wait until it loads and ask you to press any key to boot from CD/DVD.
7. Now it will load windows files and then the setup starts.
8. it shows all available partitions and there's a button ""format."" So choose your partition and format it.
9. Quick formatting should take only few moments and after that windows automatically starts installing procedure.
10. Wait for setup to complete and fill in the blanks it asks you like ""Users"",""Keyboard Languages"" and stuff.
11. That's almost it, download ""Driver Genius Pro"" Activate it and Download/Install missing drivers for best performance.
12. Your brand new windows is installed and your good to go!"

Anyway about my setup... Something is still messed up about updates, whenever i restart computer after update/updates it starts configuring windows before logging in. It usually takes about 5-10 minutes to get to 100% and then it tells me Configuring updates failed, reverting changes, and then PC shuts down.
After that it booted normally but i still haven't figured out what's with the mess about updates...
I've turned off all updates for now, and i can live with that, it's still satisfying me i guess.
Atleast i can play games which didn't run before(e. Just Cause 2) and use software meant for newer windows.

Oh and no need to thank me for support, i'll do my best if people run in trouble and i happend to be around :D

Happy New year and best of luck in future life everyone!"
,Speal.,2011-01-02T11:55Z,"Okay this is wierd... i just realised that everytime i start my computer, windows starts configuring updates and after it reaches 100% it start's reverting changes because they failed... after that it shuts down like i said before but after it boots again it does the same thing... it took me about 4-7 shutdowns and about 45minutes of waiting until it just didn't shut down after reverting changes, and finally logged in...

So when i turn on my pc i always have to wait about 40 mins to get into desktop... Great...

I installed this and have been using it fine for a while but after checking out some settings I noticed I was on a countdown clock under ""Windows Activation"" with 12 days left.

I've used one of the included activation tools on my install and thought everything was fine.

Is this a problem or can I fix it?"

No, I did not not download the KB971033 file.  I hid it as instructed."
,bomath,2011-01-25T04:21Z,"Looks like most of the activators are ridden with trojans and/or downloaders.
Sorry, but I wouldn't touch ANY of the included ones. Better yet (and a WARNING for the potential users) go into your torrent program and instruct it not to download any of the activators. And DO NOT use the one included inside the ISO (which you'll have on your DVD or USB stick).
Stick to the 7Loader or other â€žclassicâ€ activators from other sources.
Again: DO NOT use any activators found in this torrent, VIRUS ALERT. And yes, if you think they're false positives, then you must live in a fairy dreamworld."

,{me},2011-01-25T17:24Z,I second bomath's Virus Alert. There are several in this download in the activators. Do NOT use the activators included. go to mdl  (website) and others to get the activators from their original sources.

I can guarentee the recommended activator is virus free, works perfectly, so even if others in the activators ARE viruses (which I'm not saying they are), the recommended one is completely safe.
This goes for the 64 Bit version as well."

,{me},2011-02-10T01:48Z,"@jwizardry and all
I have to revise my previous comment declaring virus. This was referring to the November release anyways, so I shouldn't have posted the comment in the December release. I did so because the version number included was the same so I assumed the included file was unchanged.
What happened is that the activator that came with this torrent was flagged as containing a virus whereas the same version downloaded from My Digital Life (where it's author originally posted it) did not get flagged as containing virus. Upon further examination I did not find a bundled .exe (an almost sure sign of a virus) or any actions on the file's part that would indicate malicious operation. I am hereby withdrawing my virus alert, though I cannot confirm that it is clean, either. As always download and use at your own risk. It is unlikely that Computer-User's pink skull would have stuck around this long if he was spreading malware.
Overall: I gave the download a plus and am grateful for the upload. I will continue to use Computer-User's uploads and recommend them to others. 
Thanks again Computer-User.
Happy Pirating"

wondering if i can use this to downgrade my 64 bit virsion.
to activate my current os i ran a program which removed the watermark and activation checking' program called ""removeWAT""
I am having problem with a blue screen on start up saying my graphics card is not working and i am hoping the X86 version will fix this problem as i have tested the graffics card and found no problem.
I dont want to do a clean install if i can avoid it Do you think its possible to run the setup from windows?

Thankyou for your time im sure you are verrry busy with all your excellent pirating work

,JollyBlue,2011-02-22T02:32Z,Can I use this to wipe my current OS (Windows 7 basic 64-bit) and install this over it so my OS is 32-bit?  Also since I have 6gb of RAM does that mean ill have 2gb of RAM sitting there idlely? 
,jwizardry,2011-02-24T14:40Z,"@JollyBlue
You can format your hard drive to remove windows 7 64Bit, and then install the 32Bit one, but with 6GB of ram I would HIGHLY advise against it.
You would have almost 2.8GB of RAM become unusable, and not gain much in return if anything."
,jwizardry,2011-02-24T14:46Z,"@acerextreme
If you are getting a bsod at start up, have you tried loading in safe mode and installing the updated graphics drivers (Catalyst for AMD/ATI, GeForce Drivers for NVIDIA).
Also, if the problem is caused by the activation method, you would gain as much from either simply using the recomended activation tool, or reinstalling the 64Bit version, and THEN using the recommended activator."

No matter what I do, I cannot get the setup.exe to give me the option for an Upgrade type installation. It always brings up the partition menu asking what drive I want to install Windows 7 Ultimate to. I am running on Windows Vista Ultimate SP2 and all updates I can find. The Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor says that I am compatible for an upgrade.

I don't want to do a clean install, I upgraded from XP to Vista specifically to upgrade to Windows 7. Can someone please explain how I can possibly do an Upgrade installation? I've tried looking for another Windows 7 Ultimate download because as far as I can tell, this one is bogus for anything but a clean install."
