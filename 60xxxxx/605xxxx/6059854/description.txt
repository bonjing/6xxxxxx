Release Notes:

Going by their logo, a Warbeast is apparently a
very angry Dinosaur that can shred on guitar.

Krush the Enemy is the first full-length from
this Texas based Thrash Metal 5 piece.

Considering it is written in 24 pt. font on the
back cover of the album, I guess Ill mention this
album was PRODUCED BY PHILIP H. ANSELMO

Unleashed: This shit is the good shit.  I would
buy this just for that song.  Support!
