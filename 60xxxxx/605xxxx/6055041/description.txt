From Wiki:


Type O Negative is a heavy metal band from Brooklyn, New York City. Although commonly viewed as a gothic metal band, Type O has also incorporated elements of doom metal and thrash metal. Their dramatic lyrical emphasis on themes of romance, depression, and death has resulted in the nickname "The Drab Four" (in homage to The Beatles' "Fab Four" moniker). The band went Platinum with 1993's Bloody Kisses, and Gold with 1996's October Rust, and has gained an enormous following with seven studio albums, two best-of compilations, and concert DVDs. Their most recent album is 2007's Dead Again.


On April 14, 2010, lead vocalist, bassist, and principal songwriter Peter Steele died, reportedly from heart failure. The future of the band is not known at this time. 






Slow Deep & Hard 1991


Slow, Deep and Hard is Type O Negative's debut album, released in 1991 on Roadrunner Records.

The album, originally titled None More Negative,[1] launched the band's career (which would later skyrocket with Bloody Kisses and October Rust). The album has a rawness that was prominent in Peter Steele's previous band Carnivore, but it incorporates elements that would become standard for Type O Negative, merging styles including doom metal, thrash metal, gothic rock, new wave and industrial music. Slow, Deep and Hard is a semi-autobiographical album (with heavy amounts of black humor) based on a relationship vocalist/bassist Peter Steele was involved in. In keeping with the band's notable humor, the cover of Slow, Deep and Hard is of a blurred out picture of sexual penetration.[2]

Piero Scaruffi, a music historian, has called the album the best heavy metal album of all time, giving it 9/10.[3]

Roadrunner Records released a remastered version of Slow, Deep and Hard on March 24, 2009.

The Origin of the Feces 1992


The Origin of the Feces is the second album by Brooklyn band Type O Negative, which was released in 1992. The album was produced to sound as if it had been recorded at a live show by adding crowd noises, banter with the fictitious audience, and even a song stopping because the venue supposedly had a bomb threat called in. This was done to simulate some controversy the band had on tour in Europe for the Slow Deep and Hard tour. The band is well known among fans for weaving this type of dry humor into their often gloomy music.

Some of the songs are fresh arrangements of tracks that appeared previously on Slow, Deep and Hard. Many of the song names have been deliberately miswritten:

1.	"Unsuccessfully Coping With the Natural Beauty of Infidelity" is renamed "I Know You're Fucking Someone Else"
2.	"Gravitational Constant: G = 6.67 x 10-8 cm-3 gm-1 sec-2" is renamed "Gravity"
3.	"Prelude to Agony" is renamed "Pain"
4.	"Xero Tolerance" is renamed "Kill You Tonight"

This album also started the tradition of Type O Negative including cover songs stylized in their distinct Gothic metal sound. The album includes covers of Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" (which also halfway through the song contains the main riff of Black Sabbath's "Iron Man"), and Jimi Hendrix's "Hey Joe", which has been adapted into "Hey Pete" for frontman Peter Steele. The reprise of "Kill You Tonight" also features a sample of the closing piano strike from The Beatles' "A Day In The Life".

The original cover of the album features a closeup of Steele's[1] anal sphincter. This was changed for the re-issue two years later, to a green & black version of the 1493 painting by Michael Wolgemut, The Dance of Death. The album's title is an obvious pun and reference to Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.

In addition to the re-issue's cover, other artwork featured in the album's sleeve/liner notes include the famous 1498 woodcut by Albrecht DÃ¼rer, The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Bloody Kisses 1993


Bloody Kisses is the third album by Brooklyn band Type O Negative. It marked significant stylistic growth for the band in terms of songwriting and production values, and it is also the last recording to feature Sal Abruscato on drums. The album further established Type O Negative motifs, such as including cover songs restylized into gloomy Gothic metal, featuring sample-heavy soundscapes in between songs, and dry, satirical humor. This album includes a cover of the Seals and Crofts song "Summer Breeze".

Bloody Kisses was the first album on Roadrunner Records to achieve gold and platinum certification.

The most successful single from Bloody Kisses was the song "Black No.1 (Little Miss Scare-All)", which poked fun at (and paid tribute to) gothic subculture stereotypes. A radio edit of the song achieved modest airplay and the song has become a staple of Type O Negative's live show. The video even appeared on Beavis and Butt-Head, where it received a positive reaction from the duo.

The tracks "Kill All The White People" and "We Hate Everyone" were written as a response to the controversy over the bands' alleged racist sentiments that were born after a tour in Europe and due to Peter Steele's previous band Carnivore's explicit lyrics. They feature lyrics mocking the whole issue. These songs were later omitted from the digipak release of this album since they differ stylistically from the rest of the tracks.

October Rust 1996


October Rust is the fourth album by Type O Negative. It was released in 1996, and has a more gothic rock feel than earlier albums. This is the first album to feature Johnny Kelly credited as the band's drummer, though in a 2007 interview with Dave Manack for dreadcentral.com keyboardist and co-producer, Josh Silver confessed that all the drum parts on "October Rust" and the band's two subsequent studio albums (World Coming Down and Life is Killing Me) were programmed. October Rust has more ballads and less of the punk/metal sound of previous or subsequent albums. It also features a (much heavier) cover of Neil Young's "Cinnamon Girl."

It is the second of their albums to introduce the "joke intro"; in this case, the intro, "Bad Ground", is 38 seconds of low-level buzzing, meant to sound as if the listener's speakers are incorrectly plugged in. The second and fifteenth tracks are humorous untitled intros and outros to the album, respectively, with the band downplaying the recording of the album. Another strange technique employed on the album is the use of very abrupt endings to a few of the songs, like "Green Man", "Red Water", and "Haunted".

"October Rust" sees the band use a drum machine for the first time, although Johnny Kelly is still credited as drummer. Studio drums would not reappear until 2007's Dead Again.[1]

The third track "Love You to Death" was covered by Polish gothic/progressive metal band Moonlight.

World Coming Down 1999


World Coming Down is the fifth album by Brooklyn band Type O Negative. Even though the band has often expressed dark themes through their music, the lyrical content of this album is markedly morbid.

As with the band's previous album, October Rust, this album also features a "joke intro": in this case, the intro, appropriately titled "Skip It", is 11 seconds of staccato band noise, meant to sound as if the listener's CD player is skipping. Cassette versions featured the noise of a tape being "eaten" by the tape player. The track ends with what is presumably guitarist Kenny Hickey shouting, "Sucker!"


The first song, "White Slavery", deals with cocaine addiction. Two other songs, "Everyone I Love Is Dead" and "Everything Dies," touch on the difficulties of watching family members and loved ones die. The band's awkward and dirgeful song "Who Will Save the Sane?" incorporates, among other oddities, Peter Steele reciting the number pi truncated to 9 decimal places (3.141592653). The album contains three "soundscape" tracks, which are named after internal organs, as segues between songs. Each of these songs is intended to suggest the possibilities of the deaths band members may suffer: "Sinus" as death from cocaine use, "Liver" as death through alcohol abuse, and "Lung" as death by smoking. In an ironic foreboding, Peter once told a close friend that he could not bear to listen to "Sinus" after it was mixed and completed, because the sound of the heartbeat escalating to its furious pace after the suggested cocaine-snorting sound effect actually drove him to the point of an anxiety attack because of its realism. Also featured, at the end of the CD, is yet another cover song, this one a medley of three Beatles songs. This trio of tunes cost the band an enormous sum of money after the recording and release was finalized, much to the dismal surprise of band members, because Michael Jackson's record company owned rights to the Beatles songs used in the medley.


The reversed vocal technique of backmasking is used in several places on the album; some segments are more audibly apparent than others. In particular, backmasking during the intro section of "Creepy Green Light," which was originally entitled "Spooky Green Light", references a third-person "spell" of a friend's intention to be reunited with a dead spouse.


When Type O Negative was still intact, the band had mixed opinions about the music on World Coming Down. Keyboardist and producer Josh Silver felt that the music was strong, while bassist and principal songwriter Peter Steele had said the songs were too strongly connected to an uncomfortable period in his life. Live shows performed since the initial tour to support World Coming Down usually featured very few, if any, selections from the album in the set list. However, the band often played the song "World Coming Down" in its entirety during the Dead Again tour.

Life Is Killing Me 2003


Life Is Killing Me is the sixth album of original material by Brooklyn band Type O Negative. The title was originally going to be The Dream Is Dead, but was supposedly changed because it suggested that the band may finally be ending their union.

There are no "soundscape" tracks on Life Is Killing Me, but there is a brief instrumental track titled "Drunk in Paris." There are two tracks featured on the album about Steele's parents. "Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)" is named after the ship yard his father worked in[citation needed], while "Nettie" is named after his mother[citation needed]. The band covers the song "Angry Inch" from the off Broadway musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch. The album also contains a cover of the interstitial music from television's The Munsters, titled "Thir13teen." Track 11 of the album is titled "IYDKMIGTHTKY (Gimme That)." The acronym IYDKMIGTHTKY stands for "If You Don't Kill Me I'm Going To Have To Kill You," which is the most repeated phrase in the song, other than "Gimme That."[1]

The album leaked onto the internet before release, upsetting keyboardist Josh Silver to the point where he released a message online complaining that the leak essentially takes revenue from the band.[citation needed].

It is also the last album by the band to make use of a drum machine, although Johnny Kelly is still credited as drummer. Studio drums would not reappear until 2007's Dead Again.[2]

The inside spine under the CD tray has the message "Type O Negative is a non-prophet organization". The opening two seconds of "I Don't Wanna Be Me" (featuring Kenny's feedback on guitar, while the drums start up) are heard as a frequent sample in Grand Theft Auto IV on the Liberty Rock Radio Station.

1.	"Thir13teen" (Jack Marshall) â€“ 1:07
2.	"I Don't Wanna Be Me" â€“ 5:08

Dead Again 2007


Dead Again is the seventh album by Type O Negative, released through SPV/Steamhammer. This is the final Type O Negative studio album released before the death of frontman Peter Steele. The album sees the band using studio drums instead of a drum machine for the first time since their second album, the platinum selling Bloody Kisses. Thus, it remains the only Type O Negative studio album to feature Johnny Kelly's actual playing, as he was only "credited" as the drummer on the three albums prior to "Dead Again".[3]

The cover photo is a portrayal of Grigori Rasputin, the Russian mystic and associate of Tsar Nicholas II, and likewise the lettering is faux-Cyrillic font. Reception to this album was quite positive among fans and critics and received the highest chart position for the band yet.

The album was re-released in February 2008, with a DVD including live performances, interviews, and music videos. A separate 3LP vinyl set was also released, which includes a shirt and 12-page booklet.


Tracks: 

1.	"Dead Again" â€“ 4:15
2.	"Tripping a Blind Man" â€“ 7:04
3.	"The Profits of Doom" â€“ 10:47
4.	"September Sun" â€“ 9:46
5.	"Halloween in Heaven" â€“ 4:50
6.	"These Three Things"* â€“ 14:21
7.	"She Burned Me Down" â€“ 7:54
8.	"Some Stupid Tomorrow" â€“ 4:20
9.	"An Ode to Locksmiths" â€“ 5:15
