ITV David Suchet on the Orient Express HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

David Suchet - aka Hercule Poirot - unravels a mystery of his own as he sets off to discover why the Orient Express has been the world's most famous train for over a century. There are no murders, but he does uncover some extraordinary real-life dramas - including the time Hitler accepted the French surrender in one of its carriages. The art deco glory of the train shines through in this sumptuous film, which passes through breathtaking scenery on the journey to Prague and Venice. Plus David finally realises a schoolboy dream and actually drives the train.
