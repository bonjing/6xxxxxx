Two years on from Cherryâ€™s debut release, the critically acclaimed LITTLE GIRL BLUE that helped introduce a whole new audience to the dynamic sound of Cherry Lee Mewis, 2009 was to see Cherry head back into the recording studio to produce her best work to date. SOUTHBOUND TRAIN is bursting full of new material and out of the fourteen tracks, eight are from the pen of Ms Mewis. The album also features new arrangements of four 1920s blues numbers that are red hot and smoking, proving not to be just an echo of their original raw originators. The soft and sultry vocal delivery on Travellinâ€™ Light, the rockinâ€™ All You Need and wonderful swing-blues of Shake That Thing all showcase those signature Cherry growls and tender vibratos.

Her song-writing prowess is showcased on the eight original tracks including the mandolin led Time Limits, the hauntingly powerful Dancing Like Diamonds and the heart-wrenching ballad It Means Nothing To Me.

There is also a stunning bonus track, Something You Canâ€™t Have featuring superb guitar licks from long time musical collaborator Max Milligan. SOUTHBOUND TRAIN is a heady mix of foot-stomping barnburners to bluesy slow-cooked rockers with even a spoonful of jazzy shuffle all helping to secure Cherry Lee Mewis place as one of the rising stars on the UK blues and roots music scene. Along with Max Milligan, Cherry is supported by a band of the highest quality who comprise Nicky Slater (acoustic guitar and Dobro), Robbie Mathews (bass & backing vocals), Jeff Dakin (blues harp) and Flow (drums).
