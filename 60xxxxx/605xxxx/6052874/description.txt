[ Goddard's 12th Novel ]

Foreshadowing lurks around every corner in this engaging first-person story. Tony Sheridan begins by describing the devastating day of his wife's death four months earlier and, conversationally, recounts to Marina, his late wife, the terrible events that followed. To assuage his grief, he accepts an invitation to visit Marina's sister and her husband at Otherways, a house that he soon learns has held calamity for its earlier inhabitants. This spirit soon infects the current residents, and the tragic dance of betrayal and death continues.

Michael Kitchen's understated narration adds to the eerie atmosphere. He is an excellent guide through the twists and, sometimes predictable, turns of this suspenseful tale. His pacing is right on target; his voices and accents vary by character but do not parody or overwhelm the production.

This 12th Goddard novel like his last, has supernatural overtones.
