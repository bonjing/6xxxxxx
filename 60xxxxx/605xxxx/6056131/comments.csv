BTW, files are encoded WMA VBR LOW, chosen for spoken material, @ 41kbps, equivalent to mp3 @ 56kbps [or something like that :) ]   Even though long at 29 & 25 mins, these files are still compact enough for use on any personal player.

Since it's Christmas week...

               Seasons Greetings to all!
