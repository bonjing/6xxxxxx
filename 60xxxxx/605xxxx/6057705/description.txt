About the Artist
En Vogue first exploded onto the music scene in 1990. Born To Sing, their 1990 debut album dropped four #1 R&B singles, "Hold On", "Lies", "You Don't Have To Worry" and "Don't Go". Born To Sing achieved platinum status The act later released a six - song remix album titled "Remix To Sing" in 1991 before releasing one of the best selling albums of 1992. That album is, "Funky Divas". "Funky Divas" went directly to #1 and would later be certified 4x platinum and garnered 5 Grammy nominations.

The "Funky Divas" dropped the #1 singles, "My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)," "Giving Him Something He Can Feel," and the gold "Free Your Mind." "My Lovin'..." and "Free Your Mind" were two of the most played videos of '92. It was at the 1992 MTV Music Awards when En Vogue premiered their hit rock song "Free Your Mind" and won 6 MTV Video Awards. In '93, they were honoured with the "Soul Train Entertainer Of The Year" Award and an American Music Award for "Best Soul Album of the Year". "Runaway Love" their next single from an EP of the same name won an American Music Award and their collaboration with Salt 'N Peppa on the next single, "Whatta Man", more than ever made En Vogue a household word. 

By 1995, En Vogue came back with the smash hit "Don't Let Go (Love)". With a warm reception to "Don't Let Go (Love)", En Vogue released their next album "EV3" and within a few short months "EV3" went platinum. After the release of three singles from "EV3", including the powerful ballad "Too Gone, Too Long", the group once again decided to take a short hiatus. This break would temporarily be interrupted by their contribution "No Fool No More", the title track to the 1999 film; "Why Do Fools Fall In Love". It wasn't long before May 2000 when En Vogue came back on the scene with a new single "Riddle". "Riddle" lead to the release of En Vogue's fourth full-length album, aptly titled "Masterpiece Theatre".
