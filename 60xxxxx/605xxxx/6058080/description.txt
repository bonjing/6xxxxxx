TRON Legacy 2010 TS XViD-IMAGiNE
thx Imagine for this great early and synced release, i know its hard to cam such a dark movie in this quality

Encode:

like always i try to make even a good release better. i noticed bit too much brightness which results in noise and grain in the video. 
More brightness is good so you can see a bit more details in the picture, but the sideeffect is noise and grain.
it doesnt look too good on my tv, so i tried to reduce brightness and condensate with contrast and added a noise filter for the grain along with chroma. The result looks better to me. made a comparison pic which you can look @ here

So what you see is what you get, you loose a bit brightness but gain a clearer picture and quality.

For the Audio, well cleaned it up too, removed noise,hiss,hum and some scratches, cant do anything about the slight metallic voices here and there.
all in all watchable
