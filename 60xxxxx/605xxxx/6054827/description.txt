The Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series developed for television by Frank Darabont and based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard.

The Walking Dead tells the story of the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse; it follows a small group of survivors, traveling across the desolate United States in search of a new home away from the shuffling hordes of the undead. The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in King County, Georgia, before the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more and more grim, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the very edge of sanity. At every turn they are faced with unspeakable horrors, both from the undead and the scattered remains of a struggling human populace.
