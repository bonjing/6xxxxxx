        2010 Toyota AFL Grand Final

        For just the  third time in  AFL history scores  were level as
        the final siren  brought down the  curtain on one  of the most
        dramatic Grand Finals we  have witnessed. In 2010  Collingwood
        and St Kilda could not be separated.

        Ironically, 44 years after St  Kilda won their first and  only
        flag defeating the Magpies by one solitary point, courtesy  of
        a wobbly Barry Breen punt, the fans of both teams were left in
        nail-biting anticipation. Relive the excitement of one of  the
        most  talked  about Grand  Finals  ever seen.

        This  year the  Grand Final  DVD also  contains not  only our
        famous alternative commentaries, but extra bonus footage  from
        the build-up to  the Grand Final,  to really set  the scene on
        this, the most famous of Australian sporting events.
