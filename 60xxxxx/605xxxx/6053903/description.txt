Day one of three of the 2nd annual Deep Blues Festival.  14th performer of 14 for the day.

The largest outsider and alternative blues event in the world, the Deep Blues Festival was created to celebrate and bring awareness to these unique bands.  A mix of many styles and genres, all these bands are performing their idea of the blues or music influenced by the blues.  Purists may not agree.  We aren't out to argue with anyone, just trying to spread the word about music we enjoy.  We call it the Deep Blues.

Commerical Release warning!  A festival compilation may be released by Alive Records of the 46 festival performers.  We hope it does.  This was an open taping event.

Track 15 is unknown.   If you know otherwise then let us know.
'Cause some of you lot were probably there!
