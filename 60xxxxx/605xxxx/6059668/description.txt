A Western novel taking place in the 1870s. Mattie Ross, a fourteen-year-old girl, 

leaves home and goes off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood.  Arriving 

at Fort Smith she looks for the toughest deputy Marshal in the district, Reuben J.

Rooster Cogburn, to track down the killer. As violent circumstances test the pair,

an uncomplaining stoicism turns out to be the quality that sustains their bold and

intense loyalty. The novel suggests that in difficult times, hard-bitten virtues are

the only traits of consequence.
