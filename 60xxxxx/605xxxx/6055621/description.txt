  Album Info..: 
  
 The centerpiece of this debut album by South Carolina native Josh Turner is its lead  track, the traditional-sounding "Long Black Train," which could be a country gospel song out of the 1940s. Penned by Turner, the song rolls death, temptation, and  redemption into the metaphor of a funeral train, and sung in Turner's deep voice, it  rolls across country radio like nothing else on the scene, the ominous breath of  hellfire in the lyrics conjuring up the ghost of Johnny Cash.
