Thank you for clearing that up with all those idiots who don't get it, and still have to whine about it.

,HardcoreAndMore,2011-04-19T22:03Z,"@lontrus 

This is 720P.

Please go to Wikipedia befor commenting on these torrents. Also note, you might say 'thank you' to the uploaders, instead of flaming that you are getting everything for free. 

Note: FUCKYOU

Note2: @BOZX Thanks for the upload, great rip."
,Tekuzumoto,2011-05-13T03:40Z,"...cmon if someone is watching from a monitor that cannot display 1080p then it makes sense for them to download 720p if it can display 720p
is it so hard to understand....
like i watch from my laptop which is 1280x800 so it would make no sense at all to waste hard drive space downloading 1080p when it wont display more than 1280x800"
