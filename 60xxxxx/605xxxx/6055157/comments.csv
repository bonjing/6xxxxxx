Just making sure there wasn't any viruses in there, retards on here post shit about my torrents having viruses and it scares people off when the only thing im trying to do is help people get rid of their computer problems for free instead of bringing it to a shop to have a 3 day turn around and pay for the waiting when they can easily do it at home for free."
