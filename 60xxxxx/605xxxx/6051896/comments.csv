,phuynh,2010-12-22T11:43Z,Great download. Didn't take all that long. But when I try and play it on my ps3 it works for awhile and then it says that the video has been temporarily muted. And it will keep popping up if we try to play. What's up with that and how to get rid of it. Because  now I have tried three different Takers!
