,Sharak23,2010-12-22T11:34Z,"A10 V10, it just seems like DVD quality not blluray? but its still good quality and aspect ratio. 

 As for the movie, it was nice. Even if these kind of suspense films arent your thing, this was decently done. Dunno why I never heard of it, I guess movies arent worthy if they dont have Leonardo Dicaprio in them?

,Bit-Step,2010-12-22T20:15Z,"wtf down2load ???

who said ooowww seen the movie atthere own site, why thats lke a dj saying ''oww listened to my mix on my channel was gr8''

i think every1 should abuse down2load and not go to his lame ass gay site where he will rape your bandwidth

dont go there and support your torrents 

down2load shame on you, karma will strike u down with great vengence and fury if u keep on spamming "

,rrpostal,2010-12-25T05:10Z,Anyone know where to find the 1960 version?
,kriptikchicken,2010-12-25T13:17Z,"Thanks for the upload. :)

For those with audio issues, you may find that your player is using the wrong codec (my media player is) - to save you time and effort, just use VLC player as it uses internal codecs and works perfectly. :)"
