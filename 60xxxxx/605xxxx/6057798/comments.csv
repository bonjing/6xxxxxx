THANK YOU AND KEEP UP"
,kabubuki,2011-01-05T02:53Z,"Once again, thanks for all of your wonder rips...

Just to let you know, the Chapter Track in this video caused the following error on my Apple TV 2:

""An error occurred loading this content. Try again later.""

It worked fine after removing the Chapter track.  

Didn't have problem in iTunes, iPad and iPhone.  Only on Apple TV 2 and only had this problem with this particular video.  All other downloads are fine.

Thanks again and keep up the great work!!!"

[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-09T04:29Z,"the wdtv is finicky, upgrade your firmware to the latest, if that doesn't work rename to .mp4 extension, if that still doesn't work simply remux to MKV with mkvtoolnix, its a VERY simple process.  If you do remux then do not add the AAC track to MKV, it is only for compatibility purposes for other devices."
,hpisaliar,2011-01-09T07:25Z,My WDTV Live works fine on m4v files. UPdate firmware and everything is fine
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-11T06:36Z,good to know.
,Kadoma,2011-01-13T09:46Z,"I always change the extension to .mp4 because the fast forward functions don't function with .m4v regardless of the file source. I've got the original WDTV with the latest (and final?) firmware so I guess I'll have to remux as suggested, or look to upgrading in the near future. Thanks."
