Fern Britton meets Sir Cliff Richard, who has sold over 200 million records worldwide, and who, at the age of 70, says retirement is still not in his vocabulary.

Despite spending more than 50 years in an industry noted for hell-raising, Sir Cliff is a committed Christian who merely enjoys a glass of wine from his own vineyard, and he talks to Fern about the effect his faith has had on his life.
