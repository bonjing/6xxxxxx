Enthiran is a 2010 Tamil science fiction film co-written and directed by S. Shankar. The film features Rajinikanth in dual roles, as a professor and an android robot. Aishwarya Rai and Danny Denzongpa play other lead roles while Santhanam, Karunas, Kalabhavan Mani, Devadarshini, and Cochin Haneefa play supporting roles. The film's story revolves around a scientist's struggle to control his creation, an android robot whose programme was upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and generate human emotions. The plan backfires as the robot falls in love with the scientist's fiancÃ©e and is further manipulated to bring destruction to the world when it lands in the hands of a rivaling scientist. How the robot is stopped from further destruction forms the rest of the plot.
After nearly a decade of pre-production work, the film was shot over two years beginning in 2008. Produced by Kalanidhi Maran and Hansraj Saxena, it became India's most expensive film.[3] Upon release, it also made the largest worldwide opening for an Indian film.[4][5] The film's background score and soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, which released as an album on 31 July 2010. The film released worldwide on 1 October 2010, along with its dubbed versions: Robot in Hindi and Robo in Telugu.[6] Upon release, it enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success across the globe, collecting an unprecedented 62 crore in the opening weekend, becoming the highest-grossing Tamil film and the second highest-grossing Indian film of all time.[7]
