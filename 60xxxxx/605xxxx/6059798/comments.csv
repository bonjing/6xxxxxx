,bonemalone,2010-12-23T12:43Z,"Looking forward to see this movie, thanks for sharing!

I don't quite get the 720p in title when the actual res is 1280x544? But anyway, prefer this over a 4.5gb rip for just 200 pixels more in height >_"
,sean148,2010-12-23T19:31Z,"@bonemalone its the correct aspect ratio (cinemascope)

1280:720 = 16:9

1280:544 = 2.35:1"
,seedlove,2010-12-24T00:00Z,No subtitles? :(
,jxmad,2010-12-30T19:47Z,Great idea for a movie but it didn't work.
,DataSailor,2011-01-04T12:57Z,"Thx for the torrent, awesome video quality and audio was great too. This is first time that something looks sharp in my 24"" monitor at fullscreen... I'm also quite surprised that 720p movie can fit into 2.2 GiB. And for all of you that are looking for english/finnish subtitles http://www.subtitlesource.org/ is place for you ^^."
,murrambingi,2011-01-10T11:03Z,"thx for the upload .BONE.

Great quality, but the movie suks ass, a guy stuck in a box but the ending has a really weird supprise :P

V = 9
A = 9
M = 4 (my opinion)"
,Thor-csf,2011-06-29T01:33Z,"Subtitles can be found throughout the internet. Just search!
It's a good thing that it hasn't subtitles attached to the movie, as my LG LED TV media player can't handle videos with attached subtitles, only with external ones, like .srt."
