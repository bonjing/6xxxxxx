This torrent is just the .avi file from TASTE's torrent here on TPB:  
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5696870/Rabbit.Run.1970.DVDRip.XviD-TASTE 

 I downloaded their files and only reached 97.4% of their 6 file package after 3 days of downloading with no one actually seeding, I was only getting data from other downloaders.  However I found that I had actually reached 100% of the .avi file. So --- I extracted and copied that and created a new torrent with me as (initially) the sole seeder so a seeder will appear available on TPB's statistics for this torrent and even if ppl despair upon seeing the original torrent's listing with no seeders and immediately give up on downloading it, they will at least find this torrent and be willing to try downloading it. I usually leave around 200 kB/s open to seed torrents, so at times, you might be able to pull nearly that amount from me. Good luck and enjoy
