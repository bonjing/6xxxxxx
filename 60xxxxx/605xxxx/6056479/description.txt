Flavours of India
A Culinary journey through India's best known regions
India is home to one of the most exciting and diverse cuisines in the world. From rich, indulgent and spicy to light, delicate and fragrant, the choice is immense. At Patak's, we are passionate about Indian food and about inspiring you to discover and enjoy the vast array of flavours that the cuisine has to offer. The best way to experience real Indian food is to cook it yourself and cooking Indian food at home needn't be difficult. That's why I've developed these simple, easy-to follow recipes that celebrate the diversity of India's regional cuisine.

Food that has been cooked slowly is wonderfully mellow as all of the rich, exotic flavours of the spices, herbs, meats and other key ingredients have had time to blend and develop.
