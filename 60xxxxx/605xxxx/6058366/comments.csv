,Fangular,2010-12-22T15:02Z,"This looks interesting but can't find any reviews of this movie so I'd love to hear people's opinions of it. We clearly have similar taste on a lot of things, so what did you think of it 2040? How many stars out of 5 would you give it?

And merry Christmas!

I haven't watched this movie, I was too sad. Sorry."
