This is a rip of my Endless - Racequeen Evolution DVD. It is about the Endless racequeen group, both in uniform and bikinis. Endless are a USA based manufacturer of brakes and suspension, amongst other things, and the girls bearing their unmistakeable name and logo can always be seen at Japanese Touring Car events. There is also a photo slideshow included. It contains the following idols:

Mika Goto

Shoko Hamada

Juri Ito

Ayano Yamazaki

Mio Hasegawa

Mai Kitamaze

Ayaka Ichikawa

Izumi Yokoyama



DVD Technical Details:

Runtime: 45min

System: NTSC

Aspect Ratio: 4:3

Region: 2 (Japan/Europe)

There really isn't a way to describe this DVD, other than, "Phwoar!!" You won't be disappointed.... It was a gift from Mika when I met her and Shoko back in 2003. Obviously I can't share the autograph photos they signed and kissed for me ;) It is quite enjoyable, if you're into racequeens, especially the Endless angels. They are gorgeous from year to year!

This torrent contains both an NRG Nero image of the DVD, and an AVI version ripped by DVDFab 6.
