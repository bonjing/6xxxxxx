Remember, don't SMASH and GRAB, it's selfish! I've been kind enough to share this DVD, and am sharing this with you, FREE, so SHARE, and SEED! It's what BitTorrent was designed for! This DVD is very rare and hard to find in physical form now, so keep this digital version alive for other racequeen lovers! "

Anyone want to know why, blame the selfish leechers!! I've been nice enough to rip it and share because it's rare, I don't see why I bothered."
