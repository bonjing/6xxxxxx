[V],thethingy,2010-12-23T17:30Z,"ubstwx, are you running the right setup.exe file, there are 2 or 3 but only 1 is obviously the correct one, tested on 7 32 & 64bit with no issues. "
,jonbh45,2011-01-20T06:29Z,"I followed the instructions, but for some reason it is still on the temporary license.  Any insight?"
,dtmoore555,2011-02-06T01:20Z,"so first and formost...  this is NOT v19.0.1 or v19.0.0.1...  it's the inital release of v19.0.0.0...  I have tried to update to the v19.0.0.1, but when I do and then repeat the steps as your suggest it will not work...  now if I don't update to the newest version it works fine...

So my question is this...  If you say it's v19.0.0.1 or v19.0.1 then how the heck is it installing the inital release and how come the updates do not work???

btw... the INTERNET is OFF during the inital installl and updating of the app...  I also used the same files in the ACTIVATION folder for both versions... "

,WeAreClouds,2011-04-02T21:13Z,The non-parametric tests don't work because there seems to be no license for them.
,rubatos,2011-05-25T07:09Z,"The installation went smoothly on my system (Windows 7 Ultimate, x64) by following the instruction included in the download file.

Yes, the version is 19.0.0."

,UncleO,2011-07-22T03:07Z,"Thanks very much! The first of a couple dozen app DLs that did as the ULer said!

No problemo on my W7 home premium laptop.

Also, Avast! free says ni virus in the resultant installation.

Now to finish searching your ULs to see if there's a Windows C++ there."
