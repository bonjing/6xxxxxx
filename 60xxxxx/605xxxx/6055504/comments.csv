,The_Reverend230,2010-12-21T10:11Z,"No offense, HR. But why are you just doing the same movies OOO is doing?"
,purplemaggot,2010-12-21T12:52Z,"reverend230   are you an idiot or just a flat out retard? HR doing the same movies as ooo? LOL, that's the funniest shit i have heard in awhile! if you weren't so naive you would realize that they are not the same. HR's video quality and sound is far superior to the that of ooo's encodes, not to mention the original source being 1080p for this upload and 720p for ooo's upload (not that original sources matter that greatly, it all comes down to encoding methods). so to answer your moronic question to why HR supposedly does the same movies as ooo it's because they are BETTER!"

,Smiley2Fingers,2010-12-22T04:49Z,glad to have you back HR. 
[T],on.off.on,2010-12-22T07:55Z,@purplemaggot HR's sound is better? I should poke u with a firecracker for that statement... lol
,The_Reverend230,2010-12-22T13:33Z,"@Puprplefaggot I am not trying to imply anything.  Well HR's movies might be a little smaller, but thats not really a reason. His uploads arent flat out better, they're pretty much the same quality and sound. And they're doing this for us to watch. I think HR (who is just awesome) should probably not do the same movies OOO is doing. I mean no offense to HR or OOO They're great. You sir, are a retard."
,mattokthx,2010-12-28T21:18Z,"Would you be able to do Friday, Next Friday and Friday After Next HR? They're three amazing movies and i'd really like to have them on my iPhone. (And your uploads are great, thanks for all your hard work)"
