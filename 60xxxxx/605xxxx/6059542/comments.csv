,ahigs,2011-08-27T06:53Z,"Hey .eXeElite, do you know if mods work on this torrent? Everything works fantastically on this except when I tried to put ModLoader/AudioMod into the .jar file and it blackscreened. Do you know a fix?"
,crispyman01,2011-09-14T06:32Z,"I must admit i had many doubts about this torrent but this was beyond easy. downloaded in two seconds, loaded up on the second try, you really couldn't've made it any easy. thank you, .exeElite!"

,Toggy999,2011-09-19T15:48Z,Do any here have a cracked server? (=
,applepie1245,2011-11-03T02:38Z,"this torrent works flawlessly for single player, as is its purpose. excellent job. Though it is simplified for easy use i noticed (maybe i just screwed up the files though) that i have no minecraft.jar folder or texture pack folder or anything of the sort for customizing the game, just a bunch of notepad files. Should i download a different torrent if I want to play with mods?"
,Niaka,2011-11-15T02:22Z,thanks this was real easy to install i'll seed for a little while ^u^
