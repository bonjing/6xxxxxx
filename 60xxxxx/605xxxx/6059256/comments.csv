,olmenvk,2010-12-23T12:10Z,"the movie is total garbage, compared to the first smokin aces :) the FX are so bad that i personally can make better blood effects with after effects and a couple of hours, Vinnie Jones whom i like a lot gets abused in this movie they dont use his full potential at all. but anyway thats my opinion :)"
