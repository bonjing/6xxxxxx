Star Trek Mirror: Images Volumes 1-5

In the "Mirror, Mirror" episode of Star Trek: The Original Series, an evil Captain James T. Kirk commanded the I.S.S. Enterprise for the Terran Empire. But how did Kirk rise to power in a universe where treachery is rewarded as much as accomplishment? Now the answer to that question is revealed as we witness Mirror-Kirk's efforts to unseat Captain Pike and seize command of the Enterprise for himselfâ€”regardless of the cost in lives lost. Written by Scott & David Tipton with art by David Messina.
