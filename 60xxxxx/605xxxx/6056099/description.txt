Golden Earring - Holy Holy Life [Beat Club 1971].VOB



HQ very rare "Beat Club" tv show live performance. "Beat-Club" was a German music program that ran from September 1965 to December 1972. It was broadcast from Bremen, Germany on Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen, the national public TV channel of the ARD, and produced by one of its members, Radio Bremen, later co-produced by WDR following the 38th episode. It is notable for being the first German show to be based around popular music. In 1972, it was replaced by Musikladen.

The show's earlier episodes featured live performances, and was set in front of a plain brick wall. It underwent a revamp in 1967, when a more professional look was adapted with large cards in the background displaying the names of the performers. Around this time, a troupe of young women billed the "Go-Go-Girls," were introduced to dance to songs when their performers couldn't appear.

On December 31, 1969, "Beat-Club" switched to color and again featured live performances.

Golden Earring is the best known and internationally most succesful rock band to come out of The Netherlands. 

Founded in 1961, Golden Earring has been active for nearly 50 years non-stop. The current line-up has been together since 1970, which makes Golden Earring the world's longest surviving rock band, having been formed a year before The Rolling Stones. 

Formed in 1961 in their home town of The Hague by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbour, Rinus Gerritsen. Originally called The Tornados, The band's first line-up mainly played The Shadows covers. The name was changed to Golden Earrings (the 's' was dropped in 1969) when they discovered that The Tornados was already in use by another group.

Golden Earring's upcoming studio album will be recorded live at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London during spring 2011.

In the beginning of 1971, "Holy Holy Life" was a Golden Earring single release, which neither song on both sides was ever released on any albums (the B-side song was "Jessica"). "Holy Holy Life" is still played by the band today and was a hit in the Nederlands in February 1971.
