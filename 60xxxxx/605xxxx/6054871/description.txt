We've seen them all before. Those Page Blaster scripts that really don't do anything for your website. Mainly due to the fact the admins never update the proxies or site or they just get dead lists etc. Also they never really look like anyones actually on the site using stuff like Whos Amung Us widgets and such. This fools this system, fools the alexa system, proving to fool some ad companies, traffic exchanges credit links and now youtube video views and channel views!

1. Set a main url to blast
2. Enter how many waves you want send.
3. Pick your proxy list
4. Set throttling, some ISPS may start freaking out on the requests being sent out for new ips every few seconds.
5. Set your homepages in the Torr/Portable Firefox, apply the changes, close the portable firefox, Torr will close behind it.
6. Start Page blasting, both Internet Explorer and the Portable firefox will start up, just let it go til its hit the desired amount of hits

To use only the Torr Blaster:

3. Set any additional tags you might wanna add to the blast (Not important)
4. Click here to start.

To Increase Youtube Channel Views:
Pretty much the same as above except for video ID you enter in your channel username, so say if your channel url isthe red is what you fill in the blank with.

I've included a proxy hunter(still kinda wonky), and a simple html editor and Metapad for easy to setup proxy lists, remember when building your proxy lists, they must have the number of proxies at the top of the list then followed by the list. The Proxy list file name has to be what those that are with this and saved in the same area or the Internet explorer end wont work.

Even with the technical, now with the download
