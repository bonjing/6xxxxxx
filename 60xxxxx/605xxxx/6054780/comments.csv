,Cameigons,2010-12-24T02:39Z,I tried a number of things and couldn't get around the audio/video sync issues. Could anyone else confirm if they got it working without problems?

Its terribly out of sync"

[T],fachman,2010-12-27T15:50Z,"Guys, unfortunatelly if you have sync issues it is caused by your player. If you would have used Media Player Classic Home Cinema Edition configured according to the instruction in PLAYER folder YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH PROBLEMMS.
One of the buggy filter which causes this kind of problemm is Halli Media Splitter, so make sure it does not working in your player."
