Amazon Description:
2009 holiday collection. Christmas music has become such an integral part of the holiday season. From glorious melodies that celebrate the religious aspects of the holidays to beloved little ditties about Santa, Frosty and Rudolph, we've come to love the warmth that these songs bring to our hearts and souls. In the '60s and '70s, when Soul music really found its feet, many of the great artists of the genre chimed in with their own unique takes on yuletide tunes. This newly packaged collection from The Four Tops is a prime example of the way that Soul music took Christmas to a whole new level. Features 12 tracks including 'Christmas Here With You', 'The Christmas Song', 'Silent Night' and many more.
