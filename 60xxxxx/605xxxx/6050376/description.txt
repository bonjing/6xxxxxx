Since this is not RiffTrax's usual fare--you know, the contemporary
over-hyped blockbuster or over-stretched franchise--the RiffTrax intro
explaining why they tackled this classic film is included as a separate
mp3. A sample is also included.

Process: The video was re-encoded from a 720p BluRay rip of the film. The
RiffTrax commentary is synched up with the film's audio and then all
DisembAudio sync lines are silenced. The film audio is run through
compressor and autoduck filters to make the commentary most prominent but
keeping the movie audible when the riffers are not talking. This provides,
it seems, the best riff-watching experience.

NOTE: running a compressor on the audio for this film brings out a lot of
hiss from the background, so a third audio track has been included (as
the default) which has only the autoduck applied.

Please donate atif you have not purchased this commentary.
They make it very easy and are pleasantly understanding about the nature
of the Internet.

Enjoy!
