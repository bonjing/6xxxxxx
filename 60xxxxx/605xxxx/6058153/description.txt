The Best Of Dru Hill (2007)

High-school friends Larry "Jazz" Anthony, Mark "SisqÃ³" Andrews, Tamir "Nokio" Ruffin, and James "Woody Rock" Green formed Dru Hill in 1992, named in honor of their Baltimore neighborhood, Druid Hill Park. The vocalists performed at the music industry convention Impact '96 and were signed by Island not long after. By late 1996, Dru Hill had released their self-titled debut album, produced by Keith Sweat, Stanley Brown, and Tim "Dawg" Patterson. The single "Tell Me" -- culled from the soundtrack to the film Eddie -- became a Top Five R&B hit and later went gold. Enter the Dru followed in 1998, peaking at number two on the Billboard album chart. Despite SisqÃ³'s solo success with "Thong Song," the group continued intact -- along with new member Scola -- and issued Dru World Order in 2002, two years after it was initially slated for release. Hits followed in 2005, eventually reaching three million in sales. Scola was later replaced by Antwuan "Tao" Simpson, and the group released its fourth studio album, Indrupendence Day, in 2010. Their return was the subject of Keith Sweat's Platinum House, a reality series broadcast on the Centric channel.
