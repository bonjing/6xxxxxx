,Quad-K,2011-02-27T00:58Z,"Thanks, works on 64 Bit windows 7 ^_^

,quagwop,2011-04-06T05:19Z,"This is great! I love all your torrents, thethingy, I have your page bookmarked I use so many of them, thanks! 

Is there any chance of getting ""Actual Multiple Monitors 3.1""? I've tried the free trial and it is MUCH better than UltraMon or any other program like DisplayFusion, but I can't find any torrent for it anywhere. I don't know if it's kosher to make requests or not, but that would be AMAZING. Thanks again!"
,cymist,2011-05-05T02:54Z,@ Quad-K actually version 3.0.10 also works on win7 64bit... so nothing new with that :D
,avif007,2011-05-14T20:15Z,in this version they added support to smart taskbar on windows 7. (it worked before but it wasnt able to display aero style/ pin programs to the taskbar)
,avif007,2011-05-14T20:38Z,"well the taskbar isn't showing as it supposed on this version either.
hope they will fix this issue in the ext version."

,Sephinova,2011-11-11T15:52Z,"Is there any way to ask for the program called ""Actual Multiple Monitor""? Fucking tried everywhere, even Demonoid and TTi, nothing so far. Just need a working copy (trial ends and prog stops working)."
