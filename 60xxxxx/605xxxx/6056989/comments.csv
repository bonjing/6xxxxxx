,bigough,2010-12-21T19:34Z,Does this have a virtual cockpit?  Thanks.
,fsaqui,2010-12-21T22:43Z,"bigough, yea, this addon have VC. =)"
,bigough,2010-12-22T04:17Z,"Thank you fsaqui.  This is a very nice plane.  I have downloaded 3-4 other a380 and this is the only one that I will keep.  The others either didn't install properly, didn't have a virtual cockpit, or slowed down fsx way too much.  

This is very flyable (not easy to fly, but fun), doesn't effect my FPS, thanks again.  "

,Andy.Man,2011-03-30T23:42Z,"Thank you very much for uploading this beautiful aircraft!, It has worked very well for me :-).  I also downloaded gauges afterwards and everything is running fine,I've even been getting new textures too hehe :-), thank you very much I'm having so much enjoyment with this A380,oh and by the way I also have the sounds from the link just above my post here they're great! :-)

Thanks again"
,RocketRick43,2011-04-18T22:58Z,"Just an FYI.  If you are looking for an A380 to fly j ust because it's an A380, then this bird is for you.  If you're looking for something that has interactive systems, flight mangement, and all the bells and whisltes like you see in LevelD, PMDG and the like, this aircraft does not have them.  That being said, this is still a nice bird to fly.  Thanx for the upload!!"

,iWumbo,2012-05-13T19:45Z,"Model is thrash, Elevators don't move. In the VC, yoke does not move, altimeters are not even on, mfd is not on either. Only the GPS is available."
,Juced,2012-06-18T14:57Z,"There is no virtual cockpit, it is bare and looks like clay, impossible to use any of the systems, you fly blind with this thing."
