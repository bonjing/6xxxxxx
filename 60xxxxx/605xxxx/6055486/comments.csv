http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5461882/Le_Mari_de_la_Coiffeuse

the H264 version is just better.
AND it maintains the Original formFactor of the movie(2:35),where the WAF torrent is cropped to 16:9 and then inflated.

So in spite of apparently more pixels the Kepler42 versionis better brighter and more enjoyable, clearly. "

Yes you're right, this WAF version is hugely cropped.

But why did you spoke of the other version like it wasn't yours? lol
Your version is clearly the better one between these two, but it also have black bars on top and bottom."
