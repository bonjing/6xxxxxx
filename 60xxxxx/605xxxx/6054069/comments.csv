,shawnduhast,2011-01-09T15:21Z,"Is this the Theatrical Cut or the Directors Cut?

Directors cut disowned by Ridley Scott as a pure marketing exercise, he much prefers his original theatrical cut."
,shawnduhast,2011-01-16T02:46Z,"Good News it's the Theatrical Cut.

Bad news it pixelates in places throughout the whole film - not lots and not the whole picture but enough to be annoying."
[T],Milleman,2011-01-18T08:42Z,"Video and Sound Quality is great, but...
Seems to be a problem with the framerate. The picture stutter every 3-4 seconds. Can it be that the ripper selected 24 fps instad of 23.976 fps?"
,shawnduhast,2011-02-09T20:00Z,"SORTED :-)

download ""mkvtoolnix 4.5.0"" free software.

Add file using tab on right.
Save downloaded file again using ""start muxing"" tab at the bottom BUT select the video MPEG4 in the middle box then select the 3rd tab along below ""extra options"" - set the compression option drop down menu to NONE - (blank is not good enough)

You can also un-tick subtitles and soundtracks not required in the middle box and it tells you at the bottom in the General Track Options tab what each one is.

Hey presto video now plays with no pixelation :-) "
