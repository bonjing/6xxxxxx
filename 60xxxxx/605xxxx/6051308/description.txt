Cinderella was an incredible heavy metal band with a hint of the blues. Tom Keifer's singing stands up there with the best such as Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. How he gets his voice to make that harsh guttural sound is a mystery to me, but it definitely works. The musicianship of the other band members is excellent. The song writing is also top-notch. I saw Cinderella in concert with Bon Jovi a long time ago and they were one of the best live acts I've ever witnessed. There are some great songs that were not included on this compilation that could have replaced the weaker efforts such as 'Shelter Me' and 'Love's Got Me Doing Time,' but you can't have everything.
