[T],trialNerror,2010-12-18T19:32Z,I know there's still that 2x09 episode Science Channel aired this past Wednesday.  But I am getting this series through a VoD service and might have to wait until next week to get it.
,r0ttiem0m,2010-12-18T19:38Z,Great as always....love you man!  I'll help seed.
[T],trialNerror,2010-12-23T14:11Z,"Jeez, the switch over to Science Channel really screwed things up.  I know that now there is two episodes you are all wanting to get, but I don't have a DVR or TV card and have to go about the slow road and wait for the VOD to have them available.  
Many apologies for such delays."
