,nianim,2011-02-17T23:31Z,i get no audio... whys that?
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-02-22T15:32Z,"Audio Tracks are all demuxed (SEPARATE), so download the ones you want.
Use MPC (  http://cccp-project.net/ ) to automatically recognize & play the external Audio tracks or mux the Audio in MKV with  mkvmerge
(  http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix ) if you wish to use other player.

..often the answer is in the front of you if you're not lazy to look & read. 
Read description for God's sake."
,braundy,2011-04-01T07:02Z,"Any suggestions for playing these on a mac?

CCCP is windows only, and MKVToolnix can only be installed if you install macports, which can only be installed if you're an apple developer or have xcode :(

The vid files look great, though! Can't wait to watch em all again."

,ReliquaryX,2012-06-16T21:41Z,I agree with the previous poster.  There are several standard players and formats out there.  Thx for wasting my time by not using any of them.
