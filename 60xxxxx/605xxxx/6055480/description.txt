                    David Jason stars as cockney ex-docker Don  
                    Mitchell in this emotional drama. Don is  
                    incredibly proud of his son David's affluent  
                    lifestyle. The cars, the detached house and  
                    private schooling for the children were things  
                    Don could only dream about as a young man. His  
                    wife Dora, on the other hand, has doubts about  
                    her son's financial affairs. When David's life  
                    starts to unravel under a mountain of debt,  
                    family bonds are tested to the limit.
