Stormcorporation formed in Summer of 2009 in Preston, Lancashire, UK

By touring their brand of infectious, melodic and epic metal throughout the country and releasing a self-titled EP in December 2010, Stormcorporation built a loyal fan base and a solid reputation with a base of promoters and journalists, and received an outstanding review from Metal Hammer and Kerrang's Dom Lawson, who named Stormcorporation 'ones to watch in 2010'.

After an exciting year of shows supporting acclaimed bands such as The More I see (The Prodigy's Giz Butt) and Russian metal icons Flymore, Stormcorporation began recording their debut album in Summer of 2010.

Stormcorporation's ballad 'Never Far' was written on the anniversary of the brutal murder of Sophie Lancaster in Bacup, Lancashire in 2007. The Sophie Lancaster Foundation (www.sophielancasterfoundation.com) supported 'Never Far' which the band released on Sophie's birthday in 2010 to encourage awareness of the Foundation's aim to teach an understanding of subcultures, and rid our society of prejudice, a cause which the band firmly supports

Storcorporation's debut album, A Quiet Belief In Angels, will be released on the 16th of December 2010.
