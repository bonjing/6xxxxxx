[V],mirrormaster82,2010-12-21T19:30Z,"SUPERGOD is the story of what an actual superhuman arms race might be like. Itâ€™s a

simple thing to imagine. Humans have been fashioning their own gods with their own

hands since the dawn of our time on Earth. We canâ€™t help ourselves. Fertility

figures brazen idols, vast chalk etchings, carvings, myths and legends, science

fiction writers generating science fiction religions from whole cloth. Itâ€™s not 

such a great leap to conceive of the builders of nuclear weapons and particle 

accelerators turning their attention to the oldest of human pursuits.

Then I copied the file and changed the rar to cbr(because I read somewhere to do that I believe) and still nothing. Any tips? Thanks!"
,tant_d_walf_mama,2010-12-24T22:51Z,"Hm, I commented a little while ago asking for some help, but the comment is gone now. Anyway, I downloaded Simple Comic and it opened it just fine. I had been using FFview, but it had been quirky to begin with.

Thanks for the great upload mm82!"
