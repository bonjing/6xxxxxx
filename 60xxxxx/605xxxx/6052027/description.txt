Dixie (Paul Duckworth) a fervent, bitter blue has been bin-bagged and arrives at the
home of his crazy Evertonian sister, Gwladys (Lindzi Germain). Unbeknown to the blues,
the rabid reds next door headed by Kenny (Andrew Schofield) and Anne (Lynn Francis)
are planning a European Cup celebration garden party. On finding out, Dixie is hell-bent
on ruining the occasion. The ridicule and banter between both families and their kids is
endless as the flak is fired from both sides of the dividing fence which becomes a World
War 1 no-man's-land trench. Between the onslaught are many cameos from ex red & blue
players including Howard Kendall as the Blue Bishop and Ian St John as the Red Saint 
whilst original songs from Dixie & Gwladys inside the Bitter & Twisted arms, and from 
Anne and Kenny make this a Red and Blue comedy musical fest. Other Red & blue cameos 
include, Phil Thompson, Alan Kennedy...
