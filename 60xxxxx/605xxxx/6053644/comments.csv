,CoBrit,2010-12-20T16:31Z,Do you have the regular version of the last episode? I cannot get this version type top work on my Mac.
,snkhatri,2010-12-20T17:10Z,"is this the final episode, as the last one was 12 and this one is 14.
are you also going to post a smaller version of the episode?"
,Sassijac,2010-12-20T19:53Z,dailymail.uk.co revealed the winner. This file is too big for me to download and it takes forever..
,CoBrit,2010-12-22T04:37Z,"Tried downloading this huge file. Gave up after 8 hours at only 4% completed. Not sure why the smaller version has not been posted. For those who want to see the final - it is posted on YouTube in 4 parts - The Apprentice UK: Series 6, Episode 13 Final ! ( Part 1 of 4 ), etc. Nowhere near as good a quality as TVTeam, but needs must."
,snkhatri,2010-12-22T04:53Z,"Shorter Version here:

I have verified and it is good quality"
,SheffGraph,2010-12-22T08:26Z,Many thanks snkhatri. I've been downloading this ridiculously oversized file for 14 hours and it was at 60% when I abandoned it and downloaded from the link you've supplied. Thanks again.
,Sassijac,2010-12-22T09:26Z,It's not free of charge.
,hexrider,2010-12-22T22:21Z,"the shorter version has the ending cut off!!

,hexrider,2010-12-23T21:04Z,"^^
sorry, didnt notice the Spoiler in the link address!"
,pepper579,2011-01-06T05:04Z,"Don't bother downloading this file.  It cuts off the end!  What a let down.  This is the second one I have downloaded that cut off at the same point.  Whilst I appreciate people taking the time to upload files, it is hugely disappointing to have it cut off before finding out who won!!!  I know I can look it up on the Internet, but it is not the same as watching Lord Sugar deliver the ""You Are Hired"" line!!!!"
