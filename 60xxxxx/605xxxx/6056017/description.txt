 TuneUp Utilities 2011
+----------------------+


If you want to keep your PC running as smoothly as the very first day you switched it on, you've got two options: either you download a dozen different system optimization tools or you just use TuneUp Utilities 2011, an excellent application that has turned into an essential maintenance toolkit for your PC.
When you launch TuneUp Utilities for the first time, the programs performs a system analysis and then displays the main interface - a clean information pane where you can check your system's status at a glance. The main window in TuneUp Utilities is divided into several tabs, each one of them devoted to a different purpose: system maintenance, recovering disk space, fixing problems and customizing windows. Like I said, it's all very clean and minimalist; all the extra options in TuneUp Utilities are hidden under the 'Overview of all functions' link in the top right corner.
