,ThaGoatMan,2010-12-20T08:01Z,I think you are the m0st consistent uploaded on TPB.Dhanks Bro:-)
,X3MEX,2010-12-20T08:59Z,"nice upload i love cronenberg, this will replace my xvid copy till the BR come out...

and its good that the file size is a big bigger.."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T10:39Z,"@X3MEX: It was requested so. Gentleman from first comment have said ""720p preferred"" - and I encoded 480p first, then we both ""agreed"" that eXistenZ should be 720p. Well... I encoded a new one. It's HDTV 16/9 and file-size I cannot shrink without compromising the quality of the encode and I tend not to do that. m certain that for many of my ""regulars"" 800MB is to big to take, and I suggest a Google search for XviD which is just 100 MB smaller - but frame size is ""pygmy"" compared to my 720p."
,DSIN,2010-12-20T19:06Z,"damn..superb quality ... i rarely see small size brrips/hdtvrips in quality like this one :)

,X3MEX,2010-12-21T10:28Z,"very good quality, this is how small size 720p rips should be done..cheers !!

[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-09-14T22:53Z,video really good compression ! but audio? why AAC2Ch variable only 64-99kHz ? If the rip is HD should have both Audio and Video at good quality ...in my opinion !!!
