This Canadian TV movie is a sequel to the "Da Vinci's Inquest" and "Da Vinci's City Hall" series. Set a year after the end of the "City Hall" series, the movie finds Dominic, having matured in his role as mayor of Vancouver, embroiled in a murder that occured during a sex orgy involving some of Canada's political elites.

Here you'll find my repost of mint's original recording of the TV movie. It's recorded in 720p HDTV format, encoded in h.264 format with 5.1 channel a52 audio, and plexed into a Matroska (mkv) envelope.
