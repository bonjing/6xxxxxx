Xcode is NOT a windows application. I've already seen 7 windows guys in the leecher list. It'll simply not run, you're just slowing down the download of the OS X guys. Thanks!"
,imanono,2010-12-26T23:09Z,"I am using windows but i am not downloading this to get xcode, i am getting it so i can start seeding it cuz im nice and this will take forever to finish"
,kiwi33,2010-12-27T23:59Z,"Thanks for this. Was going to up it myself once I'd finished downloading it because it was such a piss off that Apple wouldn't allow for resuming incomplete downloads from their developer site.
Been wanting to download this for ages but was not able to do the full 3.5 Gig in one shot, which made downloading it from Apple a right royal pain in the arse."
,jazzmelody9,2011-01-28T15:22Z,tomusic. You are an idiot. No matter if it's using windows mac or linux. It's seeding you moron fuck. Please read how bittorrent works you gay fuck.
,tomusic,2011-01-28T21:37Z,"@jazzmelody9 well, when i initially seeded that was different, it had like 40 leechers and only 3 seeders, so it made a big difference if there were people downloading it for no reason or not."
,mihar2525,2011-02-04T23:07Z,downloading this so i can transfer to my mac
,sunk8,2011-02-19T06:09Z,"WTF?

48 peers with 100% and all ""interested and choked""...
Come on guys I'm seeding at almost 90kBps and am still stuck at 98 (since 5 hrs)...
Seed a little, people..."

its funny how this guy has taken the time and effort to UL this and you're having a go at him, probably didnt stop you from DLing?"
,rollercoaster,2011-04-17T17:01Z,"will this install on osx v10.6.6 running on vmware? specifically: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6120172/

and how come xcode v3.2.6 is not there. it has been final for a few days"
,allspark123,2011-06-10T01:28Z,"Has anyone tried this yet?

I have downloaded this torrent two times, every time the file had problem verifying and if i skipped that part, the half way through the installation it exited with error.

Can someone please confirm? is this torrent working for you guys?"
,allspark123,2011-06-11T12:31Z,"Downloaded it third time and now its working.
Had no problem installing it now."
,Betoetert,2011-07-05T01:26Z,"I've just installed it, which seemed to go fine, but I too can't find an executable in the /Developer/application folder. The looking glass didn't came up with an xcode .app either. Can somebody please advise? "
,thefahre,2011-07-31T04:31Z,I will download it via windows and install on my mac... 
,tencel,2011-08-05T21:49Z,Thanks ;)
