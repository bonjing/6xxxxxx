,Carnage_Rampage,2011-01-18T23:40Z,"Great movie of fantastic quality.  Loved it with surround sound.  ""WORDS WORDS WORDS WORDS!!""  :)  A little sad that it didn't have the extras, but not really surprised.  Kinda wanna hear the clips from a real exorcism.  >.>

Now to address those of you downing the movie: one of the problems with most americans; you don't know how to properly watch a scary movie.  This isn't jump out at you and BOO!!!  This is psychological.  And if you believe in spirits, demons, god, blah blah blah, makes it even better.  Not much of a religious man myself, but either way, loved it.  This is in the same league as a majority of japanese psychological horrors.  Not QUITE all the way there, but definitely worth a watch.

Download and seed, and enjoy.  Thanks to all for the up."

You need to either A) update your uTorrent.  Or B) switch to a new virus scanner.  Some scanners will block your access to uTorrent since your downloading from many different users at the same time."
