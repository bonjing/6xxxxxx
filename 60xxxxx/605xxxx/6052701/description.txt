"Laws of Illusion" received generally favorable reviews upon its release, with a Metacritic score of 65 out of 100.
Allmusic noted that the album "furthers the fantasy by taking its cues from Clinton-era folk-pop. Itâ€™s an album that aims to soothe rather than startle, replete with wistful, lovelorn lyrics and McLachlanâ€™s signature arrangements -- a mix of new age atmospherics and singer/songwriter ambience -- courtesy of longtime record producer Pierre Marchand." [17]
Rolling Stone gave the album a negative review, stating that "Sarah McLachlan's first disc since splitting from her husband, Ashwin Sood, feels scattered: The carefree single 'Loving You Is Easy' feels out of place. The rest alternates between vulnerability and bitterness, using the same sighs and moans with which she used to convey ecstasy." [18]
SputnikMusic gave the album 4 stars and praised McLachlan's musical return to the style she explored in her earlier albums, such as Surfacing, Touch and Solace.[19]
Slant gave the album rather negative review noting that "Laws of Illusion sounds both effortless and effort-less."
