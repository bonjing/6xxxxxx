Notes: One of Big Joe Williams's better releases, 'Blues on Highway 49' is a tense, gritty set of roadhouse blues. Williams's stinging playing and singing brings out the best in such songs as 'Tiajuna Blues' and '45 Blues'- he shows exactly how Delta blues could be updated. 

And before some sick twat comments I'll go there first:
