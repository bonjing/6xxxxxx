,captainscurvy13,2011-07-16T05:21Z,"I count 55 complete records/albums but may be as many as 64? I had a few song track files get compiled together in a folder called ""Hits"" making it a little difficult to re-piece those songs/records back together. Complete studio recordings included & lots of rare/live songs. Very high sound quality. Very very Impressive!"
