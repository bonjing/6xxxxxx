[V],twentyforty,2010-12-19T12:37Z,"@zakimar: Not dubbed one. Since I have no clue about differences between Chinese dialects - I have left ORIGINAL one - watching the actors with certain lip-sync. If they spoke Cantonese - it's Cantonese - or vice-versa. Further than that, I would not go and frankly - I couldn't care less."
,mgd37,2010-12-19T16:02Z,Thanks Twentyforty.
,bender1110,2010-12-20T01:30Z,"This is not an action/martial arts film - it is a comedy.

Also the language is mandarin."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-20T08:57Z,@bender1110: Sure.
