The cooperation between black-metal style growler and DJ/producer (Odo and RexRotten) brought to life an aggressive dark electronic music. On numerous occasions the musicians themselves emphasized the importance of danceflor-worthiness of their music. As it can be heard on Venom, H.Exe fulfilled their goal and the outcome should be used what it was designed for â€“ the dancefloor.

The music is technically superb and production quality should certainly be noted as one of the strong selling points of the release.

Venom consists of 11 songs including remixes. This EP is highly recommended to all those who follow dark electronic, aggrotech or electro-industrial scene.
