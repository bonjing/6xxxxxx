,malllard,2011-01-06T23:56Z,"it should be islam and the media--ive never heard any muslim talk about the hadiths--the lives and tribulations of a warlord written by his own henchmen about 700 ad--youll find out how many people he killed with own hands and how many kids he raped ..if he was a prophet surely god would have told him ""he muhammud its wrong to commit such crimes against humanity"" look it up its pretty disturbing --but muslims these day close ranks and follow their forefather --there will be no discussions like in a dictatoship--ONE GOD NO RELIGIONS--RELIGIONS ARE THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL--ALL RELIGIONS ARE MAN MADE--THINK ABOUT IT--DO GOOD  AND HELP PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY-NOT THE SAKE OF ANY RELIGIOn---"
