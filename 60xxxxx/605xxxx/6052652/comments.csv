New entry should read :

Do you own a 30GB mp3 player and aren't sure what to put on it?  Do you like to listen to crazed people yelling into microphones?  Are you an avid fan of rantradio but don't have time to record it yourself? 

Fear not! 

This torrent is ~29.7GB of rantradio talk, straight from http://www.rantradio.com in ONE SINGLE mp3 file!  Might be some duplicates but compressing didn't seem to help much so probably not.

What was rantradio/talk radio/the internet like back in 2010?  Now you know!  I have no idea how long this is, or even if it'll play in typical mp3 playing software.  Use it pressure-test your audio playing/editing software!

Mid novembre 2010 to decembre 12th, 2010 at 2210 saskatchewan time.  500+ hours of talk radio."
