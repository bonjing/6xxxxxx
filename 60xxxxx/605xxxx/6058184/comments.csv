,crpearso,2010-12-29T01:00Z,"Hey HD-R-US, What program are you using to make these? Handbrake sucks ass.

I know it requires a BluRay disc drive in your PC which I have. Thanks "

,SVids,2011-01-02T08:58Z,Croatian subs ? Croatian ? c'mon ! no english or spanish ? 
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-04T13:27Z,"SVids - As with all of our releases, English subtitles are included. What do you expect, that we add subtitles for every spoken language worldwide, when your own uploads have no subtitles at all? "
