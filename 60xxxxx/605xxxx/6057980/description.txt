What the Reviewers say:

"Aralon possesses more gameplay than perhaps any other iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad game."
-PocketGamer

"I used to look at my iOS device as a small window into new worlds and fun experiences, and with Aralon I feel like I actually have a fully realized living and breathing universe sitting snugly in my pocket.... I think every iOS gamer needs to pick up this title just to experience what is possible on this constantly expanding mobile platform."
- TouchArcade

"Calling Aralon: Sword and Shadow a big game doesn't quite do it justice. It's big in the sense that you can fit other iPhone RPGs inside it. It's big in the sense that it will absorb your free time the way a major console title can. In other words, your desert island iPhone game has arrived. And in case you were wondering, Aralon is great."
