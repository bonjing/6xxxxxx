Unnecessary parts stripped, menus compressed and the movie in best possible quality or is the whole thing just compressed down to fit a one layer dvd?"
,isokessu,2011-01-23T20:41Z,These videos lag so much that it's impossible to watch them so I removed everything. It didn't work well with BS player or even with VLC media player. Windows media player doesn't even open them
