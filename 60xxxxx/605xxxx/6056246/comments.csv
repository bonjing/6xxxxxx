,b3ryz_iz_1337,2010-12-21T21:17Z,"Thank you, works great. =)"
,Ventu5,2010-12-22T15:24Z,Works great here on Win7 64bit. Just follow the instructions.
,thesaguaro1,2010-12-22T17:18Z,"The readme says to extract and install, which is exactly what I did. Perhaps I am using a different crack. Which are you all using? Mine is an ASE.DLL with a date of 4/3/10 and size of 5.076 KB and a HiFILic.dll of 4/3/10 size 304 KB. If there is a different crack, could you point me to it?"
,Ventu5,2010-12-22T22:33Z,After installing the setup for ASE SP2 I have copied over the ASE.dll and HiFiLic.dll from the patch folder (included in this torrent). Works for me.
,thesaguaro1,2010-12-22T23:24Z,"Thanks. It works now. For some reason the first time I downloaded this torrent, it did not have all the patches in it. Now it does. Strange but true. Thanks again for all the help."

,obieone23,2011-09-19T02:55Z,Can someone crack this shit again?
,krixox,2011-09-19T09:29Z,does not work. need a new crack :-(
,irikimoss,2011-09-19T18:39Z,"can anyone recommend another good software? 

dont tell me about REX weather engine, because it sux!!!"
,Crashboy1,2011-09-20T00:40Z,"Apparently HiFi got wise about their data servers, and check your license before you start downloading weather data from them. Bummer really...

So... how about a cracked SP3?"
,ryderfly,2011-09-20T01:47Z,yep sucks i don't use fsx without it and other weather addons suck hope the will crack sp3 ASAP
,leiteneto,2011-09-20T10:35Z,"Agreed, fsx default weather sucks, as well as all the other addons... when you get used to ASE it's hard to fly without it...
The new crack is gonna have to deal with the constant server updates...impossible to use it offline...damn"
,irikimoss,2011-09-20T20:24Z,"All online validations are almost impossible to break, and those who do manage to do it won't share their work or else HiFi will found out and block all of us again.

2 solutions:

1- BUY ase
2- use FSrealWX Lite (i use it)"
,RobMidas,2011-09-21T13:23Z,"Argh nice move. You are right, once you have flown with ASE you canny turn back. I am going to have to buy this sucker. REX weather is awfull. I will try FS real wx lite see what its like but I dont have hope. I shall buy ASE when I can."
,ryderfly,2011-09-21T18:16Z,"FSrealWX is good better than other payware addons and the first ASE but it don't have wind charts, anyone know an addon that shows wind levels? Maybe I would have to invest in ASE sp3 later on its worth it if its not cracked and if u fly fsx everyday like me"
,ryderfly,2011-09-21T19:04Z,It actual does show wind levels
,Crashboy1,2011-09-21T23:00Z,"I tried FSrealWX... mmyeah... it's ok... but once you get used to those ASE seamless cloud transitions, and smooth upper winds... I really need to buy ASE... crap."
,ryderfly,2011-09-22T17:55Z,"yep ASE was great nothing to compare to it, it brought FSX to a new realism level"
,bigough,2011-09-22T18:49Z,"I broke down and bought it.  There is no need to seed/download this one anymore.  Great while it lasted, thanks."
,ryderfly,2011-09-23T05:56Z,SP3 has been cracked and uploaded well back to great weather
,Crashboy1,2011-09-23T15:24Z,What!? Where!?
,Crashboy1,2011-09-23T15:28Z,Nevermind. Here it is: /torrent/6694099/FSX-ActiveSkyEvolution_SP3 here on TPB. I'm gonna try it now and see how it goes.
,Crashboy1,2011-09-23T16:03Z,The ASE at the link above works.
