,dragonsfire07,2010-12-24T01:00Z,"It's my first time to download a movie through torrents, but mine didn't come out too good, no audio or anything, are ya'll using some special software to put the pieces together other than WINRAR... because it just came out awefull for me"
,RootStriker,2010-12-24T02:11Z,"@dragonsfire
Do you have all the codecs installed?
If not-download Klite mega codec pack."
,smokeyopot,2010-12-24T12:28Z,"Awesome, thanks for the upload. I was worried at first because this is a set of RAR files, but the file contained inside them is as advertised on this page and this version is very watchable in my humble opinion.  Thanks!

Audio Quality: 5
Video Quality: 5"
,dragonsfire07,2010-12-24T16:23Z,"ah sweet that worked, thanks. great file"
,LoStXxTrAgIcXx,2010-12-24T21:56Z,yea im useing a public wifi so my upload is shit and faster to keep em rared to seed for me
,sabretooth1,2010-12-27T21:34Z,"thanks to uploader.

But to everyone, else....DON'T SPOIL THIS MOVIE BY WATCHING IT IN THIS BAD QUALITY. I've seen this in 3D at IMAX> x 3times!!  IT'S AMAZING!!!  so I can afford to watch it now in cam version. But if you haven't seen this yet, buy a fucking cinema ticket you will be forever grateful! i can't wait until this is out on blueray, it's one of the special ones worth it.

For cam:
V.6
A.7

music if fucking awesome too!!"
