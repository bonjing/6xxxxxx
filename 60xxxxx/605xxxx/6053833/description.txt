Rare live recordings from the early 70s. I'm glad I managed to find this disc; hopefully these performances can be preserved and listened to far into the future.

Ripped with cdparanoia III 10.2 and encoded with FLAC 1.2.1. Enjoy and seed liberally--let's get this stuff out to as many people as possible.
