Run the program and say yes to creating the two files

When you get to the gui select 360 wireless receiver and hit load

goto options and change Fake API to compatibility

click on the advanced tab and uncheck native mode

click on force feedback and uncheck enable force feedback

save and close program

If you use the pre-made one don't click on the x360ce.exe 

unless you wanna make another one in that case just delete the pre-made one and

make a new one.

Please note that for those who need the XINPUT1_3.dll I also put that file in here.
