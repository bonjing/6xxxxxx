Encoder's notes:

I've used some filters in AviSynth to brighten and stabilize the source focusing on the dark areas (telling the x264 encoder to brighten dark areas while preserving bright ones), and applied a gentle denoising and sharpening. I've also made a English srt file from scratch and hardcoded the English subs over the French hard coded ones which remain hidden throughout the movie. Compare the screenshots from my encode with other Telesync releases and you'll see what I'm talking about.
