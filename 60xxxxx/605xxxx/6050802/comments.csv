[T],carter67,2010-12-19T15:53Z,@Race_Coach  extract all 3 rar files to the same folder then do it again.
,Race_Coach,2010-12-20T13:23Z,Got it.  Works great.  Thank you for making this available.
[T],carter67,2010-12-20T19:27Z,Your welcome Bud
,XxlKooLaiDlxX,2010-12-30T21:23Z,Been hoping a new version would come around sometime. Works perfectly! Thanks for the upload.
,itcrowd,2011-01-12T10:28Z,Many thanks for this. However my version has a big red smiley face watermarked over my uploaded images and the output pano. Any ideas as to how to remove?
,csiszy1344,2011-01-20T07:28Z,"Same problem here. First the program was working, but after that the program went online by mistake, and that big red smiley face appeared on each uploaded picture. I tried to remove the program and register files, but nothing changed. Is there anyone who solved this problem?"
,csiszy1344,2011-01-20T07:39Z,"Same problem here with the big red smiley face, and no ideea how to remove it."
,gypolo,2011-01-26T00:01Z,"@carter67, thanks for all the hard work you do on here ;) had been using PTGui without any problems for a couble of weeks but now have the big red smiley of death, at no point did i access the update... can you think of anything we can do?"
,gypolo,2011-01-29T20:14Z,@itcrowd & csiszy1344 any luck in shifting the watermark yet? or know of any clean alternative versions? 
,XxlKooLaiDlxX,2011-01-30T01:34Z,"Yeah, same here. I commented above almost a month ago and it was working great at that time. I tried it today and encountered the red smiley faces as well. Key must be blacklisted so I wouldn't bother downloading it anymore. At least we know they have a sense of humor lol.

I'll go back to my older version and see if that one does the same now."
,gypolo,2011-01-31T21:27Z,"@koola yeah its a shame, made my life so much easier, i did see the funny side of it but after a few hrs tryin to remore it it virtually had me in tears lol am buying a license at end of month. u ever use hugin? you older version should still be work fine"
,csiszy1344,2011-02-07T12:55Z,"Could not do anything. I had to use the older version. Anyway, I reinstalled the windows, and now it is working. Hopefully it will not try to update itself."

,xenark,2011-12-08T19:25Z,"Deleting the {48632410-2828-439F-92F4-5151AA4B9620} file works to get rid of the red smiley faces:  I've JUST done it.

For Windows 7, it is in a hidden folder, so you will have to enable hidden folders to see it (Use Google to figure out how to do that)

It is then in C: > Program Data > {48632410-2828-439F-92F4-5151AA4B9620}

Delete the folder, and it will work fine!"
