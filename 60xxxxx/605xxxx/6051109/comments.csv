I can see 7 mistakes in just that phrase alone.


1.. It's ""Hey""...not A YO 
2...It's "".BONE.""    .. Not  BONE 
3...It's ""Do you have?"" not do you got
4...It's ""starring"" ... g lol
5...It's 50 CENT .. not 50 CENTS.. wtf? how did you miss that one?
6...You spell Blu-ray like that.. not like the color.
7...And there was no comma after mistakes 1 and 2"
