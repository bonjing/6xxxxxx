Jon Newton [<a href="http://www.p2pnet.net">p2pnet.net</a>].
2010, Supreme Court of Canada.  Ripped directly from the supreme Court of Canada "webcasts" and transcoded into a free-er format for viewing on non-windows platforms.  It's probably only low-TV-quality, but it is a glimpse into the supreme court as it makes an importan decision on the future of the internet in Canada.

Wayne Crookes has attempted to sue, in this series, Google, BC public libraries, Yahoo, Wikipedia and a plethora of bloggers across the political spectrum for the action of linking to information of him.

"It seems to me that if we accept the position youâ€™re putting forth [Crookes' lawyer] , then no one should ever hyperlink. Maybe Iâ€™m a chicken, but I would not dare create a hyperlink because there might be some defamatory material, and Iâ€™ll be stuck defending myself in court, and I cannot afford it : Weâ€™re sentencing the hyperlink to death, it seems to me."
-Supreme Court Justice Louise Charron.
