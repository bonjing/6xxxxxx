Maybe I didn't explain well, I meant the babylon realise that a licence illegal. Can it be a problem on my comp software? Few weeks ago the former babylon worked perfectly.

,Ghayyurious,2010-12-28T09:25Z,"Actually the software is stuck in your windows registry....

OTHERWISE u've to REINSTALL ur Windows for this software...."
,Iamleon,2010-12-29T19:01Z,"you're right, that seems to be a problem"
,loeki2000,2011-01-07T16:44Z,"@Iamleon, Hello, I am using Babylon 7.02 and had the problem that it stopped working. The program responded with ""this licence doesn't support local libraries""or something to that matter. The user/serial from this version resoved that problem. I am using ZoneAlarm so Babylon could't accesss the internet, problably it stopped working after a certain date?"
,eidnaj,2011-01-19T17:48Z,Thanx very much i needed it. If you want to be sure you don't download malware just download it from the original site and folow the instructions. Works fine for me on win7. Keep up the good work!
,eidnaj,2011-01-19T17:55Z,"To Iamleon: you can try to install the software again and delete it with perfect uninstaller. you can download it here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6040875/Perfect_Uninstaller_V6.3.3.8___Serials_[TrT-TcT]

I hope this wil work. Its a lot easier than reinstalling your windows"
