every time I right or left click to access and remove. Can't get rid of it, any ideas? "
,lwilli2009,2011-07-25T00:01Z,"@warden2011 use a program that search files... like a media player, click open file search for it like that and right click and remove/delete it... it did the same thing to me I just cut and paste to a jumpdrive and watch on my ps3 via showtime media player....

Hope this helps..."
