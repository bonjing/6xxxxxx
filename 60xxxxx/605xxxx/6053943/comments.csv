[T],on.off.on,2010-12-20T23:53Z,why only 480x200 and not 480x208?
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-21T00:44Z,"208 is another mod16 computed value from your encoder.

1920/800 = 2.4
480/2.4 = 200"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-21T00:46Z,If i wanted to use 208 i would use 4 pad lines on top and bottom to maintain the AR.  But that sorta screws up zooming.  I would also apply a 2.307 AR setting.
[T],on.off.on,2010-12-21T08:37Z,guess im just a sucker for mod16 lol
