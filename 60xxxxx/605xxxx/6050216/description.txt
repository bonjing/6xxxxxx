A New York advertising executive (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is about to land a big account, 
has his life shaken up when it becomes known that he has lied about having a college degree. 
After being fired, his life is further shaken by his debtors who had counted on paying after 
landing the account. Having to go on the run, he is called back to his southern town roots, 
when his great aunt dies. At the reading of the will, he learns he has been asked to assume 
the mantle of choir director of his great aunt's church and if he can get the choir in the Gospel
Explosion in Atlanta, he will inherit stock worth $150,000. Unfortunately the choir leaves a lot 
to be desired and he has to start recruiting. Among others, he gets three prisoners to join. 
More importantly, he gets a "sinner" (Beyonce Knowles) from one of the local night clubs to join. 
While initially scorned and resisted, nonetheless her voice wins everyone but the hardcore church
busybody. Contains mild sexual language (a lengthy discussion of the different kinds of "booty").
