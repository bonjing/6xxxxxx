Synopsis:

Ming (Nuttamonkan Srinikornchot) is able to see ghosts and contact to the dead since she was a little girl. It's been 15 years since she managed to escape from a mysterious ghost that kept following her. One day she meets a young doctor named Buut (Anuchit Sapanpong), who visits her for a purpose. â€˜Buutâ€™ knows that Ming can contact to the dead, so he wants her to find the reason behind the death of his father.

While his father's death is reported as being suicide, he believes it was murder. The appearance of Buut brings back memories of the past, and now Ming must face a truth that is even more terrible. For now she is being stalked by a lost soul who is far more dangerous than any ghost she has met so far...
