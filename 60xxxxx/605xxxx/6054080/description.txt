
Title Gary Numan - Micromusic [1981, Wembley] DVDRip x264 AAC-AshX (Kingdom-Release)

Storyline

Gary Numan's 1981 'Farewell' concerts at Wembley Arena, London marked the first phase of his career. 
Performing material from three Number 1 albums (Replicas, The Pleasure Principle and Telekon) against the spectacular backdrop of one of the largest sets ever built on a stage in the UK, this is Numan delivering on every level â€“ songs that are still hugely influential 30 years later, pure pop star theatre and a light show as big as a city. 
One of the greatest shows of all time? No question.
