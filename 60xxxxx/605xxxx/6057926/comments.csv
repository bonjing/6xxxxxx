,Thermodynamics,2011-02-19T17:15Z,"Most of them were ripped by me from the original disc/record.  Some I got from other people.  They all check out as flac.  None are converted from MP3, otherwise they wouldn't be flac...... ;-)"

,ajdedo,2012-03-15T16:42Z,"Fantastic work!! A masterpiece post!

Just some questions ->

1) Is the MP3 version the same collection of songs, or are there some differences in the content?
2) Did the MP3's come from this FLAC collection? And did you convert them yourself?
3) Which FLAC to MP3 encoder did you use and what setting?

THANKS FOR AN AMAZING POST!!!"
