With Windows XP Professional Edition with Service Pack 3, you get safer browsing and communication, powerful security tools, and improved experiences. Windows XP is the operating system release that unifies the Microsoft range, with all the desktop versions now built on the NT/2000 code base rather than the shakier foundation of Windows 95, 98, and Me. That makes XP a great upgrade for users of the now-obsolete 9x and Me line, but for those already on Windows 2000 Professional it is a closer call. Despite the similar name, there is no special synergy between Windows XP and Office XP.* Automatically keep your PC up-to-date with the latest security enhancements including the Windows Security Center, Windows Firewall.
* Windows XP Professional provides rich, wireless network support, helping you simply and easily connect to wireless networks whether in your home, office, or out on the road.
* Quickly set up and connect all the computers, printers, devices, and an Internet connection in your home with the all new Network Setup Wizard.
* Encrypting File System provides an additional level of file protection from hackers and data theft by transparently encrypting files with a randomly generated key.
* Clean, simple design of Windows XP Professional puts the features you use most often at your fingertips, helping you find them quickly.
