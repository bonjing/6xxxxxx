,ItsWolfeh,2011-01-11T22:52Z,"It works, but its not like an official translation or anything. I know because I clicked on the button that resets the tractors position and it gave me a german message. But, it works. Its an okay game, its extremely realistic, which is what makes it kind of boring. I'm playing though to see the cow genetics part of it."

,lazerxxx1,2011-01-23T08:21Z,"Just wondering, for those of you having problems after patching the game (I'm doing it now as we speak, so not sure if it works yet or not) The FS2011 that has been uploaded?....is it a DVD version, or a Steam digital download?....Cause if it is a Steam DD, then that might be the problem. It looks like the 2.1 patch is not meant to be applied to the Steam or Mac versions of this game."
,lazerxxx1,2011-01-23T08:23Z,"well!, I just downloaded the 2.1 patch from the website and it tells me FS2011 isn't even installed.....alrighty then :)"
,critters30,2011-01-23T22:31Z,"Installed and plays fine as long as you don't update. Tried the 2.1 update and it asked for the cd key again, but wouldn't accept it this time. Had to uninstall and reinstall without update."

,Sick_Jargon,2011-05-10T12:32Z,"@Badass51

I haven't tried this release but it's likely that the installation will be in German. The game itself should run in English.

If you want to apply patches then you will have to alter FS11's reg keys but its not that difficult.


(step-by-step originally from KazMux)

1) Mount the iso Run the setup
2). Copy the DataS.gar from Eng fix map on the disc to game directory
3). start game use the cd-key from Eng fix on the disc
(Steps 1-3 are just copied from the other torrents instructions)
4) Download the English patch from the site onijim just posted.
5) Run regedit. (The easiest way to do this is to open the Start-menu, type in regedit and it should find it)
6) In regedit, start a search for FarmingSimulator2011DE_is1
7) regedit will in fact find a folder with that name and display all the files that folder contains. You don't want to rename any of those files, but the entire folder. Rename the folder to FarmingSimulator2011EN_is1
8) Install the patch
9) Start the game, it will ask for a serial. Use the one trolica3 posted earlier. RLDST-FRM7J-DHYAR-M8KF7-MD9DR

This should help you change your game from appearing to be German. And set it in English.

Good luck. :)"

,braduz,2011-05-14T05:06Z,"@sick_jargon if you read the description properly you would know you didnt have to do any of that, its english.. you dont need to crack it just mount it install it use the serial in txt. and play"

,Xephon2010,2011-09-23T18:24Z,"Hey folks.

For those that are having the following problems

-Installed, tried to play using the key, but the game stops working

- Installed, tired to play using the key, but the game stopped working, downloaded the update, and tried entering the key that was given with the game, but cannot click next.

I've found that the only real way to get it working, is to install the game with the cd key you were given.

Then find the update for your language.

download the patch, and then use this key : RSNBJ-54PRT-74LFD-B8TD2-MRNPZ

It won't allow you to play multi-player, but you'll definetly get the game working if you use this key, and then install.

Took me a while to read other people's comments about this game.

I'd also recommend to those who think their graphics card is outdated, to search their graphic card maker's website for a auto-update patch.

It might help your gameplay once installed.

,MrEpsoide,2011-09-24T03:22Z,"Ok Guys and Gals, I Had a bit of a Problem with this.. 
Excellent tutorial on how to get this working one post before this one.. unfortunately doesn't work with update 2.2.. Well all you need to do is change you Cd key after update 2.2 Key: 2TXCK-7ETPE-8SA57-PLQ22-MHFB8 .. after that it should be all Gravy.. Mmmmmm

Hope it Helps // This Torrent is Still the Best Option for Playing FarmSim.."
,Xephon2010,2011-09-24T04:26Z,"Thanks Btw.

It looks like the keys are changing, but im guessing yours also doesn't allow multiplayer ? Am i right ?.

In which case, i think it's time some one found a keygen for this, perhaps those who are more.. connected with keygen software, can find one that actually works ( And is virus free, Scan each one you get folks ).

~X"
,MrEpsoide,2011-09-24T06:36Z,"No bro my Fix dost work with multiplayer..

unfortunately i really don't see a key working for multiplayer, considering it seems to go through a server-based network ""so id think,""  for confirmation on authenticity.. 

If someone really want to game online, I'd suggest Buying the game Through Steem. Thats only because its Cheep and I cant really think of another way.. ""Other Than a Hack for Lan?""

just 2cents..
& im owed Change..

~E

i like the Tag man"
,Xephon2010,2011-09-25T01:45Z,"Lol thanks.

I get what you mean, but if there is a keygen at least that offers a working key for single, multi-player might be something people would be willing to miss out on.
