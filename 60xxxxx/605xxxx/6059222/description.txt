Like them or loathe them this is a classic of the nunsploitation genre (if you can call it a genre). It has the ever-gorgeous Myriem Roussel of (Marie, Name of The Rose)

Note, La Monaca Di Monza is the title of half a dozen movies. Here's what this movie ISNT...

Note this is a VHS rip and, as you might expect, the quality is not great. It is more than ok though. However, this is the only copy I've managed to lay my mits on so take it or leave it.
