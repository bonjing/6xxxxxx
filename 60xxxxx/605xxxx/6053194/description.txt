ReleaseNotes:

Better known as the "White Album," this was meant to be the record that brought them back to earth after three years of studio experimentation. Instead, it took them all over the place, continuing to burst the envelope of pop music. Lennon and McCartney were still at the height of their powers, with Lennon in particular growing into one of rock's towering figures. But even McCartney could still rock, and the amazement on "Helter Skelter" was that he had vocal cords at the end. From Beach Boys knock-offs to reggae and to the unknown ("Revolution #9"), this has
it all. Some records have legend written all over them; this is one. --Chris Nickson


Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,

of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
