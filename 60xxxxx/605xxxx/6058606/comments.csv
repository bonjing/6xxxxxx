BARCA GOTS TO SIGN FABREGAS OR TEVEZ

On 6 December, the finalists for the FIFA Ballon d'Or were announced. Barcelona players took all three spots. Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta will discover which one of them is the world's best player on 10 January in Zurich, Switzerland. This will be a monumental moment for FC Barcelona, as the three best players in the world will not only be from the club, but all three will have come from Barcelona's youth system. "
