,stephenp65,2010-12-23T06:47Z,What a great movie! Make sure you go see it on the big screen too. Otherwise they won't make the sequels of John Marsdens books.
,Dramat,2010-12-23T20:18Z,Thank you BONE :)
,aldrinstryder,2010-12-24T03:17Z,thank you. sure it is great quality.
,rayzoredge,2010-12-24T03:48Z,thnx BONE.
,Maliketh25,2010-12-24T05:30Z,"yo, .BONE thanks for the upload man ;). oh and what quality outa 10 would you rate the video?, compared to the 1.5 gig upload you did?"
,Lolzalotful,2010-12-24T07:12Z,your a fucking legend lol! been waiting for ages! ty ty ty!!!
,Staffieone,2010-12-24T09:03Z,"The Audio and Video were great thanks for the upload.

As far as the actual movie goes it's pretty bad IMO.  The main story of Austraila getting invaded could make for an entertaining movie unfortunatley this movie does not deliver at all. Go check out Red Dawn, this movie kind of rips it off but without the decent story or action scenes."

PIECE OF SHIT MOVIE NOT WORTH PUTTING ON THE BAY!!!"
,Devilishredbeardishness,2010-12-24T14:16Z,Isn't this about a bunch of kiwis saving aussies like they did in world war 2
,JetFever,2010-12-24T18:14Z,"It is good, they are obviously aiming to make sequels which is why the ending wasn't hundreds of jet aircraft coming in overhead and someone shouting 'It's the Americans!, We're saved!'. A TV series would be nice but I'd like to see them becoming an elite crack squad who don't make stupid mistakes like forget to put someone on watch, or turn off the radio and start talking girl talk even though the countryside is swarming with deadly enemy. But what countryside eh? Amazing. "
,stlctan,2010-12-24T20:50Z,"this movie looks so stupid, theres no way im gonna watch it, i got on here just to say that"

,pxpierre,2010-12-25T00:36Z,"Good torrent but bad movie. Thank god the bad guys can't shoot an elephant 10 feet away otherwise the movie would be out of heroes after 15 minutes.

Recommended if you are 12 or younger."

,Rivven,2010-12-25T14:08Z,"Great audio/video quality.

Ignore the negative comments, its definitely worth watching even though it seems almost like a Red Dawn clone. Though I swear I would of flipped out if the pilot from the Aussie fighter that got shot down would of survived and joined the group, would of made it look like a Red Dawn carbon copy lol.

Whats funny is the upcoming Red Dawn remake is about the Chinese invading the US instead of the Russians/Mexicans in the original Red Dawn.

All in all, the acting wasnt bad, and the storyline was good, I hope they continue making them, I think I might have to read the books in the meantime though."
,fadedexile,2010-12-25T23:02Z,I just wanna know why the fuck anyone would invade Australia? 
,pleblian,2010-12-26T00:03Z,"@fadedexile lol

For the Kangaroo... the Chinese are getting tired of eating Cats and Dogs"

 hahaha i agree"
,uglyrtard,2010-12-26T08:07Z,and fosters tastes like shit...
,popsicleFTW,2010-12-26T08:21Z,I remember this. It's based off a book i read in grade 9 English......
,dr_rock,2010-12-26T13:09Z,"As an Aussie, at least it was not too culturally cringeworthy.
A decent film, more like an episode of a mini-series though.
The rip was excellent quality A=9, V=9.
The movie had some decent moments, so probably rates around 7.
The girls are hot, the Chinese shooting as bad as mine in MW2.
Why would they invade Australia?  I dunno, all the gold, uranium, nickel,bauxite and iron ore.
Maybe it is just because how hot our chicks are, and our beaches."
,emanmodnar,2010-12-26T13:26Z,@dr_rock haha so true
,LOLiverPB,2010-12-26T15:50Z,"Liked this movie alot, I wish it would be longer tho, like 2 hours, its an ok movie if u got nothing better to do, totally enjoyable and the chicks are hot :) nice explosions aswell. quality is almost perfect. I enjoyed it, hope u do to."
,benhaxx,2010-12-27T14:34Z,"Download speed isnt great atm, maybe thats just because its almost midnight in Australia and most of the seeders have gone to bed. But if not, PLEASE SEED!!! I saw this film at the cinemas and it was pretty good, the blond is an absolute babe, not much else to be said :P"
,Maxcribbin,2010-12-27T20:36Z,Sounds like Red Dawn in Australia. Will check it out so long as Mel Gibson isn't in it!
,night creature,2010-12-27T22:48Z,"omg, I loved the books! I just hope the film is as good! "
,kbowk2,2010-12-28T04:32Z,"I read the first 3 books as a teenager and loved them.  I also read first book (this movie) to my older students back when I was a teacher.  It is a brilliant series.  Feel like going back to finish off the series.  I think there are 7 books now.    

Quality Movie.  I can't believe how great this movie was.  I had such low expectations for an aussie film but it was really well done and the action scenes really blew me away.  Some scenes didn't make it into the movie, like travelling out the bottom of hell down to Cobblers Bay (or was this the 2nd book) and the Hermit's house they find in hell.   

FuckStain McGeezacks who thought that Plotholed Red Dawn was a better film is a dick.  At least this shows the transition from student to Guerilla with all the emotions in-between really well.  Rather than Charlie Sean having a cry then picking up a gun then taking on army after army with little hassle.

I'm really looking foward to seeing the rest of the series now as movies.  Especially when New Zealand tries to help out Australia lol.  "
,kbowk2,2010-12-28T04:38Z,"Staffieone U are a TwatFace.  Go watch Red Dawn again.  You probably thought it was really good when u were young cause it really is a crap film.  

Y invade Australia? Obviously u don't know much about their resources in the ground.  In the movie the radio sezz something about sharing space as well.  "
,Staffieone,2010-12-28T07:49Z,"@Kbowk2

I'm not sure why you resort to personal insults because you disagree with my review on this crappy movie. You like it, great enjoy it. You can't dispute the fact that Red Dawn was made first and this one steals it's premise from it. The books this shitty movie are based off were published from 1993 on way after Red Dawn.

I'm sure you'll retort with something really intelligent like you're a twatface but thats cool we're all entitled to our own opinions.

Have a happy new year sir. "
,murrambingi,2010-12-28T14:57Z,"thx for the upload .BONE.

V = 9
A = 9
M = 2

I am an aussie too, but i must admit that this movie was shit!!
It had ex-actors from home and away and it seems a bit too much over rated for my taste, even though it seemed to have some sort of story line it could have had more action instead of lame crappy acting.
Trust me as an aussie and this being an aussie film that if you want to bother watching this that i suggest you go and pay a lookout to see the land 1st, because thats basically all that there is to this shitty 2 dollar film, even india can produce cheap films better than this."

,Machino31,2010-12-29T19:35Z,"This movie was suppose to be dated back when Japan control: Wake, Guam, Philippines and ect. Thats when the Japs controlled one of the largest territorial empires in human history. By the summer of 1942 they were at the door step of Australia... so basically this movies is about the Japs wanting to take over Australia so they could cut off the supply line of America from waging the war in entire Pacific, but they never did invade Australia so its like a ""what if"" type ordeal"
,Machino31,2010-12-29T19:39Z,"In this movie they did invade... but in reality they never did... thats what I meant when I said a ""what if"" type of ordeal... this was for the people who asked why would anyone invade Australia>>

,bdiddly1,2010-12-30T01:02Z,the reason the chinese would invade australia is to kill off all the cast of neighbours(now thats a very good idea!lol)

As for the movie... My bitchy english teacher made us read the book back during highschool, and while I showed little affection for the story, I think i'll give this movie a try regardless.
