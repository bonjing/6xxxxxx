INXS is basically a pumped-up pub band, and this collection of their best-known hits shows it. If you ever heard it on the radio, you'll find it on here, from the catchy "The One Thing" to the funky "Need You Tonight" and the pounding "What You Need." The sadly departed Michael Hutchence does have a Jagger-like charisma, which often trancends the three-chords-and-a-beat tunes and sometimes treacly lyrics. I was pleased to see that "Disappear," the best song off the otherwise forgettable "X", is here as well. Diehard fans nitpick at the song selection, but casual fans like myself enjoy this immensely.
