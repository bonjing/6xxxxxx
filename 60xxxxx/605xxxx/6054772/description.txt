Plot:
The story takes place in a future where the world is covered by a new ice age. The seal hunter Essex 
(played by Paul Newman) and his wife arrive at a city where some survivors of the disaster live 
among technological artifacts in a primitive way. All people in the city have lost hope of surviving 
and the ice continuously threatens to destroy the city. The survivors are playing a game of life and death called Quintet. Being alive is the only reward in this game, and none of the people involved can quite explain why they keep playing it.
