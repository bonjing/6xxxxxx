Swedish pioneers of Christian heavy metal. Released their first EP in 1982, and the first full length album the year after. These first 2 releases were in Swedish language, but soon they recorded the debut 'Jag Skall Segra' in English too, calling it 'I Shall Conquer'. These guys were hailed as the next big thing, and magazines like Kerrang put them on their album of the year overview. This never happened though, and Leviticus broke up after releasing their 4th full-length album, in 1989. 2003 saw the band reforming for Bobfest.
