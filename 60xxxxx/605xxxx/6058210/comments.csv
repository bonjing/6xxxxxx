His awesome somersaults, under heavy fire, in the combat sequences where like none other. A+ would definitely watch again. will get back on the video quality."

Fixin to post my first torrent, and this DVD happens to be my test dummy.  It'll be in the 1.8mb range for HQ sound, and full resolution.  DVD, not BR.  Looking sweet, so far but don't want to post if it'll be pew pew'ed by all the ungrateful farks."
