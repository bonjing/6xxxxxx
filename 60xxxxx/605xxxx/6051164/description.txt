HQ rare promo music video. "Doctor! Doctor!" is a song from Into the Gap, the fourth album by the British pop group Thompson Twins. It was released in February 1984 and reached no.1 on the UK Albums Chart, and no.10 on the U.S. Billboard 200.

After the commercial success of Quick Step and Side Kick, the band worked once again with producer Alex Sadkin at his Compass Point studio in the Bahamas.

The first single to be released was "Hold Me Now", which reached the no. 4 position in the UK in November 1983. Four other tracks were released from the album in various countries around the world: "Doctor! Doctor!" (UK #3, US #11), "You Take Me Up" (UK #2, US #44), "Sister of Mercy" (UK #11), and "The Gap" (US #69). The first four of these singles all had music videos that were shot to promote them, and the Thompson Twins were a prominent fixture on MTV and other music video outlets of the era.

Into The Gap was the band's biggest selling album, being certified double platinum in the UK and platinum in the US.
