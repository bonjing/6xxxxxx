Filmmaker Justin Hunt leads viewers on a cross-country journey straight into the heart of the American methamphetamine epidemic in this illuminating documentary narrated by actor Val Kilmer. Troubled by the proliferation of methamphetamine addiction in recent years, Hunt traveled from the arid planes of New Mexico to the inner-city squalor of Portland in order to explore the toll that the drug has taken on American families and show that it's never too late to try and rescue a loved one. The voyage takes a decidedly personal turn as Hunt visits with meth addicted parents James and Holly, whose four children speak candidly about the effect their parent's addiction has had on their upbringing.
