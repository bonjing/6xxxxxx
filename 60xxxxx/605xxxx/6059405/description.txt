By request. It took a while but I obtained the DVD of TNT's A Christmas Carol. I performed a Full Disk ISO Extraction using MacTheRipper 4.0.

Nothing is compressed. The movie is in the original 4:3 format as was broadcast on TNT.

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! (and keep seeding 'til Santa arrives)
===========================================================================
A Christmas Carol (TV 1999)

Stars: Patrick Stewart, Richard E. Grant and Joel Grey

Standing out in the crowded field of screen adaptations of the classic Dickens novel A Christmas Carol is hard to do, but this version pulls it off. When a transparent Jacob Marley walks through Ebenezer Scrooge's apartment door, you know you're seeing something both timeless and contemporary. Other strategically placed special effects--a funnel cloud that transports Scrooge and the ghost of Christmas present, the hollow specter of Christmas future--keep you riveted without slipping into anachronism. 
But, as good as the technology is, the performances are what really power this 93-minute TNT interpretation. Patrick Stewart brings a depth to Scrooge that allows the character to go beyond the cartoonish qualities that have made him a Christmas mainstay. That doesn't mean he's any less heartless with his hapless employee Bob Cratchit (Richard E. Grant) or any less dismissive of his well-meaning nephew. A frail-looking Joel Grey makes an excellent ghost of Christmas past, and a superb British cast ably fill the remaining roles. 

Director David Jones, shooting on location in England and at London's Ealing Studios, has achieved a balance of science and sentiment that will help this version hold up for many years to come. --Kimberly Heinrichs
