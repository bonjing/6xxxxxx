,sgleder,2011-01-01T04:36Z,What's up with the russian audio crap?
,afaragun,2011-01-19T21:50Z,"yeah, it's Russian dubbed ontop of the original.. it sucks"
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-01T00:52Z,So. Can I take off the Russian audio with VLC?
[V],GoodFilms,2011-03-22T21:16Z,Are you guys blind? Just select the 2nd audio track...
,zumberman,2011-03-30T14:04Z,"The mkv contains the original audio (English & French). The problem is that the english subtitles track is all wrong. It provides subtitles only for english dialogs (!!???) and no subs for french. Unless you are fluent in both french and english, this file is not good for you."
,zumberman,2011-03-30T14:14Z,"A good english subtitles file is this: the.science.of.sleep.2006.720p.bluray.x264-vagisil.eng.srt

e.g. from: http://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3655877/la-science-des-reves-en"
,gonflement,2011-05-20T00:15Z,Merci GoodFilms pour ce partage.
,drako314,2011-10-28T05:23Z,"i thought this was of literal science meaning, like a doco on how we sleep so im disappointed. "
,ilovemycomputer,2011-11-10T04:35Z,"wow i just had to write a comment on this.
you stupid fuck tards. don't have kids. this is not a documentary on the science of sleeping.
it's a romantic comedy."
,ilovemycomputer,2011-11-10T04:37Z,"not that I can't read, but I don't feel like signing up to another website just to make a request for a vid..
can you put this as a regular copy so I don't have to download 5 gigs on crappy alaskan internet?"
,maustin,2012-01-29T01:23Z,"Here's a better English subtitle track for english-speakers -- it subs the French portions only.
