,TheRuthlessOne,2010-12-21T02:47Z,"For some reason I get audio, but just a black screen. I have a Mac and Perian, not sure what the problem is. Can anyone help?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-21T09:56Z,"@: Use another MP4 player - VLC for Mac (www.videolan.org) or mplayer for Mac (http://mplayerosxext.googlecode.com/files/MPlayer-OSX-Extended_rev13.zip).
It's not QuickTime compatible file, hence black/gray/blank screen.
