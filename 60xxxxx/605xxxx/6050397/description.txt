Wot, no Silence in the palace? Have pirates grown too lazy to UL Africa\'s greatest movie? Thus you\'ll have to make do with my rotten copy, Ripped from tape - I hope this inspires someone to UL a better version.

Moufida Tlatli (genius) describes the film much better than I could here:

This is probably also the best Arabic movie ever - Tunisia\'s film industry is much smaller than Egypt\'s, but the Tunisians concentrate on quality, and they have their Freench connection to give them artistic inspiration.
