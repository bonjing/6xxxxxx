,SecretAgentWoman,2010-12-25T05:17Z,"libby, you have to install the game first. This is not the game, only the crack."
,tomevi,2010-12-28T20:18Z,"Yep, this worked for me:

Installed The Sims 3 - Razor1911 Final MAXSPEED,
No patching!!
No Crack!!

Updated the game with the downloadmanager to latest version (Version 1.18.9)

copied the crack provided in this torrent to the \De Sims 3\Game\Bin Directory (where you installed the game)

The game works fine

Thanks!!"
