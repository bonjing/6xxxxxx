Long out of print, this is one of the most highly-sought after prizes in the Iron Maiden catalogue!

Any Maiden fan that doesn't have this needs to download it IMMEDIATELY. Either that, or you could pay $400 on eBay for it. :)

The early live stuff is simply incredible. Some of my favorite live shows I've ever heard from the band. Not sure they ever sounded tighter or more ferocious than this.

Full artwork included. Not my CD rips -- many, many props to the original uploader's efforts.
