Is the software easy 2 use???"
,rogamosh,2010-12-22T00:19Z,Is It A Plug-In 4 Photoshop Or A Stand Alone Software???
[V],bigwimpie,2010-12-22T03:18Z,It's a Plug In for Adobe PhotoShop
,peaceman2,2010-12-24T13:08Z,Can you please explain how to activate in a little more detail. I can't get it to activate because I'm not quite sure what code I'm supposed to copy and paste back into the key generator.
,peaceman2,2010-12-24T14:31Z,Never mind I figured it out. Works great thank you.
,shellboy4life,2010-12-29T05:05Z,"can some1 pls help, i downloaded this fine, i have photoshop CS3, when i selected to use this with my photoshop it said could not complete my request because it was not the right document??? idk im new at this"
,motostu93,2011-01-18T23:17Z,"Keygen doesnt work for me, anybody have a serial number they want to share? or should i just reinstall? "
,thure1982,2011-02-11T23:59Z,There is a virus in th ekeygen
,thure1982,2011-02-12T00:00Z,"Sorry, key gen."
,o.owner,2011-02-23T21:48Z,unlockcode doesnÂ´t work
,rostau,2011-02-26T07:44Z,"Norton Security w/ updated definitions did not detect a virus, but I think this keygen may be bunk.

The terms and described fields between the instructions, the keygen, and the eyecandy activation window don't match, and are confused. The instructions also would seem to be missing a step between 4 and 5:  Select ""other activation options"" like ""phone"", or you won't get an installation ID.

The activation codes that it generates don't work. Maybe they did once, or maybe one particular serial number and activation code number works, but not the ones I tried. :("

,marko_23,2011-09-20T01:43Z,how can i access the eye candy app?
,skeelol,2011-09-20T07:33Z,"Works but instructions suck, they leave out a few key elements, the main one being you have to click 'Other activation options'. Here are the revised instructions:

1. Run the installer
2. Uncheck ""Register on line"" click OK
3. By the first use, Eye Candy Asks for a serial,
4. Run the KeyGen, to generate a serial,
5. Copy the serial and paste in EyeCandy register box
6. Click Next
7. Click Other Activation Options
8. Copy and paste Installation ID from Eyecandy to Keygen Installation ID box
9. Click Activate (Keygen)
10. Copy and paste unlock code into Eyecandy unlock code box
11. Click Activate (Eyecandy)
12. Badabing"
,dznuts666,2011-10-17T00:52Z,"Works Great -- Clean with no viruses/trojans!  During installation after pasting generated serial number, and unchecking online registration, product is installed.  Open Photoshop and run an Eyecandy filter.  From there, you have the option to activate.  Copy Installation ID and Paste into Keygen.In keygen, then in the Dropdown box, select Eyecandy 6.0 which will give you the unlock code needed to complete registration process.  Woop!"

,fjpeter,2012-01-23T20:11Z,thank u !!
,DAGRIT5,2012-01-28T23:20Z,"Weird...I ran installer, opened PS, used eyecandy folter...and nothing came up for activation. I had this same torrent on my laptop from a while ago and I do remember some activation window popping up and using the keygen. Perhaps it has something to do with my host files? I have no idea. Anyway this works fine Win7. And everyone barking about a trojan, have you ever seen a keygen that didnt get flagged? I never have (however I did quaranteen the son of a bitch with MB) But yea this works like a charm. Easy Peazy Lemon Squeezy"
