Release Notes: 

The Skid Rowdies are looking new blood to fill up the ranks.   
We're a professional team of dedicated sceners with big mark   
under sceners. We believe on the ground idealism of the root   
of the real old school scene. We do all this for fun and      
nothing else. We don't earn anything on our hobby, as we do    
this for the competition and the heart of what got the scene   
started in the mid eighties.                                   
                                                               
If you think you got something to offer, then don't hold back  
on contacting us as soon as possible.                          

twice the fun   \/ double the trouble

The Skid Row family wish you and your family a merry christmas 
and a happy new year. See you in 2011!
