,Propinquity,2010-12-20T21:38Z,"Thanks as always for the updates.
Just to be sure, do I need the previous updates or will this one work? I'm getting them all just incase, but I figured I'd ask for a definitive answer while its downloading."

,sharmila123,2010-12-21T07:48Z,So this update needs a cleen install of CIvi 5 . Using Windows XP
,Oo0oO,2010-12-21T22:58Z,So no need for update 1 and 2 just go with this one and thx so much god bless ya all.
,datupuki,2010-12-21T23:05Z,Don't get this.... the tech tree is in french
,mentalwonder,2010-12-23T17:43Z,"The techtree has changed to french for me too, after installing this update.
From civ5 forums, it's a problem where you need to click english in steam, but obviously we are not using steam, so I think it's built in the skidrow steam dll's ?

Haven't found any way to change it back to english yet :("
,fakeshemp,2010-12-23T19:01Z,this update makes my game French. And I cannot change it back in the options.
,Macimate,2010-12-24T13:29Z,"Tech tree also in french for me! Anyone know how to contact Skidrow, please do so - I'm not sure they are aware of this!"
,Acratenn,2010-12-24T17:12Z,"am i the only one who cant get this update to work?
tryed installing on a clear install, a patched(update 1) install, an install with the base crack, and a patched and not cracked install and all this on two different comps.
after updating all i get when turning on the game is a civ5 process that disappears after half a minute and thats it. anyone knows what to do?"
,dude2288,2010-12-24T23:41Z,Same problem as the last guy. I'm guessing were doing something wrong. Any1 have any ideas?
,Acratenn,2010-12-25T08:04Z,found my problem. had to extract all the rars cuz you cant see the crack if accessing through the archiver. copied it and it works. will try to find a way to fix the french problem.
,Master_gah,2010-12-25T12:35Z,Anyone knows how to get the snails out of my tech-tree?
,Alsn,2010-12-25T16:15Z,"For those having problems(missing dll's, tech tree in french, etc). Here are the steps to follow to make sure things work properly:
1) Install the original skidrow civ5 release.
2) Make sure to copy the skidrow cracked files from the dvd/iso to the civ 5 folder.
3) Install the update.
4) Copy the updated crack files. 

Skipping step 2 is what is causing all the problems."
,mentalwonder,2010-12-25T19:08Z,"Thanks Alsn !
That was the problem, didn't copy the skidrow content from original install, thought the update skidrow files would've been enough :)"
,ultamanl,2010-12-26T00:20Z,thx! it work great! keep it up the updates! :D
,JaranOlsen,2010-12-26T16:00Z,"Followed the instructions, yet my game crashes when I run it after the update, get these crash details:

,renton79,2010-12-27T10:42Z,"Alsn or anyone, after installation and original crack, do you have to use update 1 and update 2 before using this one?"
,Macimate,2010-12-27T14:30Z,"Thanks @ Alsn. That fixed it.
Though, I'm still having crash problems after about turn 60 each game. This hasn't happened before I installed this update. Anyone else with similar problems?"

You guys have been part of my life since way back when I got my first Amiga, even those little install applets you've got with the demo music is complete awesomeness, music takes me back to the glorious computer era of the 80's every time. Love you, love your work, keep it up, that is all."
,Wisper83,2010-12-28T23:58Z,"The producers of the game are simply retarded i can't understand how can they release in the first place such a buged game and after many months they still have many bugs in the game one worth mention from the top of my head is the stealth plane that still does not lvl after i have played this new patched release  

tho thumbs up for less lagging, the game does not overload the Pc that much now


ty Skidrows and uploader for the torrent but the producers better put their sh1t together if they wanna sell loads of copy's"

,zombiewarpigs,2011-01-02T08:15Z,"Thanks Skidrow for the patch
I had no problems with your first torrent and this patch works great as well but I do have one problem now. When playing through the local network at around 60 turns, my friend gets replaced by the AI and for him as well. I have tried it twice with the same results. This did not happen before the patch. Does anyone know the fix for this besides buying it as I will when I can.

,Torgaloukos,2011-01-07T15:52Z,I was right... it won't play
,Torgaloukos,2011-01-07T16:01Z,"And now, after copy-pasting again the crack from the game (not the update) again the game won't play and I need to reinstall...

Why didn't the update work?

It had an error while installing for read-only files"
,Torgaloukos,2011-01-07T16:05Z,Is it because I first played the game?
,Torgaloukos,2011-01-07T16:08Z,Must I unrar all the rar files? Each one ovewrites the other... :\
,Torgaloukos,2011-01-07T16:42Z,"Ok, the error tells me that the file ""C:\Program Files\Sid Meier's Civilization V\assets\Gameplay\XML\AI"" (for example, says so for many files) is marked as read-only...
|can't see a problem in that my self|
...would it be a solution if I would go to each and every file it tells me (they're a lot) and unmark the ready-only attribute?

Thanks in advance!"
,noonmoon63,2011-01-12T05:47Z,"I downloaded this, everything works fine, but when I get on the game, the version says 1.0.1.3.5, and when i set up the game there are no new leaders i can play as.

,ty2419,2011-05-22T19:45Z,how do you update the game
,Lone_bassist,2012-03-13T18:57Z,"@Torgaloukos

lol although it's been awhile if you still need to solve this....

go to the folders location i.e. ""C:/windows/program flies/""

right click the folder that contains the game i.e. ""Sid Meier's Civilization V""

select ""properties"" 

and un-check ""read-only""

click ""apply"" 

a dialog box will appear, select ""yes apply to all folders and sub-folders""

there now all the files are able to be re-written!!!
