1) If you have a previous version of FreeStyleDash installed, you will need to make a backup and delete/remove it. (IMPORTANT)
   Do not run this from CD/DVD as it may sometime require write access to game:\

2) Extract FSD2-Beta.zip and send content to your XBOX 360 MU / HDD / USB.

3) Launch default.xex using a method that is easy for you. (Dashlaunch, XeXmenu, Etc)
 
  a) Add game path's in setting menu, and please read the next note carefully before complaining.

  *** NOTE *** 

      On the first scan, please allow it to completely scan/download content, do not interrupt it,
      Reboot xbox, or try to play around FSD too much.
     
      If an error occurs it is best to start from scratch again until the first scan / download is 100%.
      All scans after the first will be fast/and stable.

   You can press R3 (Right thumb stick) to see what's going on in status bar, and view your ip.


There is a FTP server and webserver included with FSD 2.0-Beta, so feel free to log into FTP with xbox as user and password.
Webserver will be http://your-ip



This is labeled as a beta, and with such, bugs will be in the application, if you feel like you're constantly getting
bugs and able to recreate them or at least describe them with some detail, please visit our forums (www.teamfsd.com) and
post the bug/description along with the crash log. The forums will be used now for bug reports until we find a better way
to track issues.

Enjoy.
