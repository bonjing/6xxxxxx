ReleaseNotes:

Forget the questionable title--did the survivors actually approve it?--and dig Innyrds' track listing, which sums up a lot about why so many of us still love this bunch of Southern tough guys. Not only was their triple-guitar howl one of the definitive sounds of the whole post-Allmans movement, singer Ronnie Van Zant put his smarts--and his intelligence--to work on lyrics like "Saturday Night Special" (an anti-gun screed), "Workin' for MCA" (a not-grinning shot at the band's record label), and "That Smell" (a warning about his own excesses). And
what's that other song called? Oh yeah, "Free Bird." --Rickey Wright

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
