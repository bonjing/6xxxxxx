i have a favour to ask.....can u tell how do u encode movies......where u have learnt it..........may be tell a website

i downloaded Band of brothers (15 GB)......it took a lot of time to download and i loved the series too and i don't feel like deleting it but its size is large (could keep more than 20 movies in its place)........so i wanted to encode it in good/ok quality

i know its hard work but i think i can do it .......my laptop is on 15-16 hours a day downloading ........so please tell

thanks a lot

No the video bitrate is too low...it should hv been atleast 1400 to release it as a scene release..
I m the only encoder who uses 1400 bitrate other scene encoders use above 2000 for 720p..
