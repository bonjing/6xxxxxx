It's a shame that they didn't make a 2 cd version, because the source looks to be really good, it's just heavily compressed.

I'm not gonna watch it, but wait for february when it comes to the theathers here. It will be a long wait, but I'll rather wait than watch this version."

,Atoxia,2011-05-22T00:39Z,@Beach_Ape Lol too right xD

,Stavesacre,2011-07-07T16:44Z,"Heads up guys...this really is a hot torrent for the MPAA.  I also received an ISP Copyright Infringement warning just yesterday on this file from Time Warner.  I've downloaded dozens and dozens of torrents without problems and this one got tagged...can't be a coincidence that so many others are getting hit as well.

If you have PeerBlock or whatever, go for it.  However, i'd pass on this unless your pretty sure of your defenses."

Or just go live in the country I live in and shit on ISP's because they can't see shit.
And if they do, they're fucked by the laws here."

Terrible movie! Natalie Portman, talentless,  Zionist poster-girl that she is, hams it up as usual while the vastly superior Mila Kunis gets shoved into a supporting role. She outshines Portman at every turn but its not enough to save this preposterous, melodramatic fart of a movie. Avoid."
,painrdfnd,2011-12-23T07:31Z,great movie
