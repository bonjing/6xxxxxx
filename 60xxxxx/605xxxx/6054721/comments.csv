,kellyisradd,2011-07-17T10:24Z,"Ok, downloaded parts of the 4th season first... And most of the episodes I've downloaded have a static sound for the audio. No voices or music or anything, just this loud sound. 
I'm no good with computers, so I don't know if there's a way to fix it or what...?
The video is fine, great quality with that, but you can't hear any audio besides a loud scratchy static sound... Help?"

You may need to download a good codec. Google K-Lite and download the codec there. I currently use the standard version of it and it plays all perfectly, even HD mp4/mkv/avi etc etc. I hope this helps somewhat. Even if you have a codec installed already for playing videos, it may be out of date and just needs updated to a newer version of it. Good luck :)"
