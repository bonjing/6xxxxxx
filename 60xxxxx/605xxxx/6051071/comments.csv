,Snwbrds2922,2010-12-19T03:11Z,File is compressed as a 7zip. Make sure to download 7zip to extract the wii iso.
,GGGugered,2010-12-20T18:00Z,Nice torrent friend. Can I ask you a question? How did you managed to compress the game so much? I'm asking because it could really help me a lot.
,sammyljimenez,2010-12-21T08:25Z,Awesome! works perfect
,sammyljimenez,2010-12-21T08:26Z,Awesome! works perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,Snwbrds2922,2010-12-21T14:24Z,"The only reason why this game is compressible so much is because it is a direct port of the SNES game. SNES games don't really take up that much room. I actually used wii backup manager to convert it into a wbfs file, then back into an iso with wii backup manager (weird but it causes windows to see the iso as 4.7 gb, but the size on disk amount was only about 300mb), and then used wii scruber to remove the update on the disk (the update was about 2-3 hundred megabytes.) 

Most Wii games are not going to get this small. All wii iso's are 4.7 or 8.5gb. There's the amount of space it actually has on the disk and then the rest is just empty data. Most wii iso's will go down to about 2-3gb. This game was just a real exception. "

,Pyatin,2011-02-26T19:01Z,"Unless you open-region your system, it won't work or may not work properly.  This is NTSC version.  Again, even if your system is Open-region PAL system, many NTSC games may not work properly.  "
,tris12,2011-03-11T15:13Z,"for anyone having problems with usb loaders i tried neogamma r8, launch neogamma from the homebrew channel and load the game from wherever it's stored, usb or dvd, im using a pal wii and have got the game to work, im also using waninkokos cios rev 21 :]"

,R4KID,2011-08-30T11:53Z,"See this is why i love usb's and harddrives why the f**k would i waste a 4.7gb disc for a 17mb game it makes no sense, my advice would be if you have a usb or hardrive your not using format it and get this game DO NOT USE A DISK"

,scutdelaney,2012-01-27T13:05Z,"as Snwbrds2922 said,this is the snes version and not the polished up wii version,that is why the file size is so small.wii version is much better looking than this muck."
