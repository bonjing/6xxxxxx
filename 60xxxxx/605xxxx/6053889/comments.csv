No sync problems here.

Thanks for this."
,iTestedIt,2010-12-26T15:10Z,"Very decent download speed.

There is nothing wrong with audio, I have no idea what Phil is talking about, I watched the whole thing with no sync problems or glitches.

Video quality is good, just as you'd expect from a DVD release.

So quality is a definite 10/10, it's exactly as you'd find on an English DVD with the default settings.

Movie is hilarious, it's got to be on my top three ""Most Laughed In Of All Time"". I peed a little at some points."
