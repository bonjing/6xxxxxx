,8cruzer,2011-03-09T21:07Z,"I finally got this to work. Follow these instructions:

1) If you're having trouble with product key use: 710C1

2) Here is a workaround for those having trouble with x-force and 10.6.6...

A. Once at the activation screen:

1. Open the Terminal application.

2. In Terminal type ""sudo -s"" without the quotes, followed by a space. (sudo -s )

3. In Finder right-click ""xf-adesk2011"" application select ""Show package contents"". Navigate to Contents -> MacOS folder and you'll see x-force there.

4. Drag n drop x-force to the Terminal window. When you drop it there it will have its full path typed in. you should see something like ""sudo -s /Volumes/XForce/xf-adesk2011.app/Contents/MacOS/x-force""

5) Just press enter in Terminal to start x-force. Now it will generate a valid serial.

B. Click on Mem Patch (you should see successfully patched)

C. You should know what to do from here..."
