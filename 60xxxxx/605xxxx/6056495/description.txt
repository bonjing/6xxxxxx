Orgasmatron is the seventh album by the British band MotÃ¶rhead, released in 1986. It is the only full MotÃ¶rhead album to feature Pete Gill on the drums, although he also played on the four new tracks recorded for the 1984 No Remorse compilation album.

The album's working title was Ridin' with the Driver and later changed to Orgasmatron, it was too late for Joe Petagno to change the cover art and the train design was used.

It features some of MotÃ¶rhead's heaviest songs ("Orgasmatron" and "Deaf Forever") and it is the album (along with No Remorse) that got MotÃ¶rhead back on track after the critically-acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 1983 album Another Perfect Day. The album reached number 21 in the UK charts.

The song "Orgasmatron" was re-recorded in 2000 and was available as an Internet download under the name "Orgasmatron 2000". It was later included on the band's 2003 five-disc box-set Stone Deaf Forever!

MotÃ¶rhead (pronounced /ËˆmoÊŠtÉ™rhÉ›d/) are a British rock band formed in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister, known mostly by his stage name Lemmy, who has remained the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to or one of the earliest members of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Usually a power trio, MotÃ¶rhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, cemented MotÃ¶rhead's reputation as one of Britain's foremost rock bands.

MotÃ¶rhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Lemmy dislikes such labels, preferring to describe the band's music simply as "rock n' roll" and usually opening live shows with the line "We are MotÃ¶rhead. We play rock and roll." MotÃ¶rhead's approach has remained the same over the band's career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. MotÃ¶rhead's lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and "life on the road". The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's horns, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the MotÃ¶rhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as "War-Pig" and "Snaggletooth". The band is ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.
