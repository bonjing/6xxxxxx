Simply put, this album is one of the best I have heard from any band in the last 2 years. 
Want more detail? OK. 
The music is well constructed, driven, and at no point does a song leave the feeling that it is just there to fill out the album. The production sound is also done well, which is only to be expected with the near-unlimited budget available to Metallica. This album features input from Robert Trujillo (formerly with Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, and a number of other bands) who delivers just what this band needed: raw energy. 
Overall, the album is enjoyable to listen to, and will undoubtedly remain in my favorites for many years.
