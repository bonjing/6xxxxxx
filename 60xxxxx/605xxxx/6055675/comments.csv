[V],Kitlope,2010-12-21T09:16Z,"Awesome dude. You got anymore old skool to upload? Check my torrents, if you go way back you'll see a couple dozen hip hop albums from the late 80s upped that should still be seeding

peace."
[V],Kitlope,2010-12-21T18:02Z,Link to get the .torrent file is broken.
,scottsasse,2010-12-22T09:13Z,"Yeah, I'll be uploading some more hard to find old school hip-hop, rock, etc..... Some just as single tracks and some albums. All will be in Flac whenever possible. I'm getting ready to upload as singles DJ Kool ""Let Me Clear My Throat"" and Traffic ""Dear Mr. Fantasy"" in FLAC. If there is something in particular your looking for leave it in a comment here."
,scottsasse,2010-12-22T18:58Z," By the way Kitlope, I really have enjoyed some of your torrents in the past. So THANK YOU!!!"
,scottsasse,2011-05-15T02:31Z,"I am still seeding this torrent almost every day and night but you people who ""hit and run"" are fucking up the download speed. So if you're an impatient and selfish prick who won't seed back at least what you get then don't download my torrents!! (I'm sure you can find some bullshit 120kbps torrent instead)...........................................................................................................................................................Anyhoo, if you're willing to seed back and find this torrent is not seeding then you may send seed request to DrWynnScott@gmail.com or leave comment here. Lotta Love, DrScott"

Thanks :)"
,scottsasse,2011-07-23T02:44Z,"Yeah, I will upload it again as a re-seed. Seems the link was likely broken. So when you choose pick my torrent that says (RE-SEED) in the title. Love, DrScott"
,scottsasse,2011-08-02T02:40Z,"I strongly recommend you download my new reseed of this torrent instead!! Here is all the info you should need or click on my user-name to easily find it.
