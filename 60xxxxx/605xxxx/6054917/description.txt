Lily of the Valley is a goth/electro band whose style can be placed somewhere in the middle of the Dark Independent scene. It means that they use guitars and electronic instruments in equal proportions, taking the best from both worlds. Those into beats will find them, those who prefer more conservative goth/guitar sounds will be pleased as well.

The band members have a good deal of experience behind them. Even though â€œSounds of the Momentsâ€ is their first release, it does not sound like a debut. The music is mature and the bands has the phase of experiments well behind them. Very nice female vocals are strong selling point of this release. 

Music from â€œSounds of the Momentsâ€ works well on stage and in a club setting. In both cases it just shows a different face.
