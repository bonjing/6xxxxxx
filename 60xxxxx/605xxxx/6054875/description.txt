With The Disney Bakery, you can bring magic from your imagination into your kitchen: each recipe is vividly inspired by one of the classic animated Disney films. Turn piecrusts into Aristocats and puff pastry into Aladdins lamp, or, best of all, turn a rainy afternoon into a mouth-watering memory to treasure. Adrienne Berofsky has run her own catering company, worked as a private chef and restaurant manager, and served as a personal assistant to Gael Greene, food critic for New York Magazine.
