      This final episode presents the perfect New Year's party,
      and it is all about celebration. As it's out with the old and in
      with the new, the duo celebrate with a champagne ice sculpture,
      and an Indian-inspired feast to enliven the taste buds and keep
      everyone going through to midnight.
