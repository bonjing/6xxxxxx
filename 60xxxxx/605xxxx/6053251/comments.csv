Bheja Fry is a 2007 Hindi cinema film and a remake of the French movie Le DĂŽner de cons. (this 1 is also^)

And i'm quite sure nothin will ever equal the original, altho u gotta understand french well to get all the subtleties."
,kingtrip,2011-01-20T16:58Z,"For those who received a copyright infringement notice from BayTSP:

Did anyone comply with BayTSP and actually tell them that they removed the content from their library and/or computer?  "
,konnah,2011-01-21T17:55Z,carell good as always. worth the download for sure.
,StanlyManly,2011-01-23T07:07Z,"I'm a big fan of Steve Carrel, but thought this was just some stupid movie, but it was surprisingly good!  Makes me want to see the original and the Bollywood remake as well.  

The quality was pretty decent, definitely good enough to watch on the big screen.  Sound was excellent.  No copyright infringement letters or emails either, not to worry.

,donttrust11112,2011-01-31T14:08Z,"downloaded this torrent, then received a letter in the mail citing me for copyright infringement, and threatening to terminate my cable and internet service.  do not download this movie.  read RhoDEsz's comment. "
,TheMightyTHOR,2011-02-02T04:12Z,i got an email for copyright infringement for this and the fighter DONT DOWNLOAD
,SambinoX2,2011-02-02T22:47Z,I too got a letter from comcast.
,N0nebayx,2011-02-11T23:11Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD, i got a call from my internet company and they registered this video i downloaded and they told me i could gotten in jail.. dont do this if your 18 or younger .. youll get in trouble trust me. I almost shet my pants."
,joeqread,2011-02-15T19:49Z,"What hollywood looses in revenue from bad movies such as this, they make up for in litigation of copyright infringement.  That's the nature of the beast folks.  Don't download this one unless you want your name on ""the list"", I regret ever stepping foot into the ""more info"" link on this torrent as the movie was not worth my first copyright infringement notice..."
,joeqread,2011-02-15T19:53Z,"Also you can fight the infringement issues if it starts getting serious.  Go buy the blu-ray, then claim ""fair use"" as you had no method (that you knew of) to get that blu-ray movie you purchased onto the handheld movie player you also purchased.  That's what ""fair use"" is for, and if they try to claim otherwise it's up to them to prove it."

Do Not Download ""Dinner for Schmucks[2010]DVDRip-MXMG"". This one might be fine but i got a copyright notice from my service telling me it was because i dl'd the one from MXMG.

""this dude and a few others have posted the same thing on pretty much every torrent of this movie i could find. I don't know i have not dwn loaded yet but ill let ya all know for sure when i do. i ain't scared for the simple fact that i think these guys are a bunch of posers trying to stop the torrent because it is an American remake plus, I know my rights and the D.M.C.A. front to back, so what fine me, with this economy i'm better of in jail with three square meals a day any ways."""
,J-dubus,2011-05-01T06:06Z,"even if he's telling the truth, the fact he can't find the one he downloaded then he has no busieness downloading torrents in the first place. If you don't know what your doing then don't be the bad apple that jacks it up for the rest of us. If in fact he did down load this movie and got caught due to his own ignorance then this torrent has been red flagged by all the IPDs asotiated with the DMCA there for if you get caught then you know who to thank... good luck!"
,samhors,2011-06-09T00:35Z,"Great quality, but I also was flagged with a letter from the cable service threatening me... BLAH BLAH BLAH. The only thing was is I had peer block running, I have downloaded thousands of movies with no problems until this one. Download at your own risk!"
,camgaertner226,2011-07-08T17:52Z,"Received a DMCA notice from my ISP for downloading this specific torrent. I suggest you do not download it, seems it's monitored by Paramount."
,janhighboy,2011-07-19T03:54Z,"Quality on this is great, but I did get a DMCA notice. Six of them, actually, out of 15 total that Qwest forwarded to me. I only found out because I had to call customer service to see why my internets were borked. That was why. They turned it back on pretty quickly though after I agreed to delete the content. And before anyone chastises me, I do use Peerblock and start it before I fire up uTorrent. So, just a word of warning."
