,Hiepke,2011-02-20T14:24Z,"Nice quality!! thanks a lot!

Only unfortunate that my dvd-burning software has problems with encoding your vids... (cfr. Up!)
When I play the finished dvd, I see a rapid display of screenshots...
I don't have this problem with other (mkv) downloaded movies..

But  it looks fantastic on VLC mediaplayer ;)
thx for the upload"
