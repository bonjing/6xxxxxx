Rumpole (The Complete BBC Radio Audio Dramas)

Over the last 30 years BBC Radio has broadcast numerous audio dramas featuring John Mortimerâ€™s famous creation â€˜Horace Rumpoleâ€™, an ageing London barrister who defends any and all clients.

I have enjoyed listening to the episodes and thought it would be a good idea to combine all the BBC Radio audio dramas into a single torrent.

The audio dramas were downloaded from demonoid, radioarchive and piratebay; but for consistency reasons I have renamed and re-tagged the tracks. Also, many thanks to the original posters!
