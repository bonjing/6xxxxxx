This video begins at a science lab where Adam Woods is looking into a microscope observing a new dimension (the wrist shackle in the video on the wall is seen on the cover of Reach the Beach). It shows a dimension in a black tunnel with lights on top where Cy Curnin is dancing in a classy uniform. He is then in a bright tube, wearing a gray shirt with his arms bare. Then, in a blue tunnel, he is running with a dog. It ends with the tunnel in a 3-dimensional angle to see through out the tube.
