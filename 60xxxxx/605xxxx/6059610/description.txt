Offering cohesion and clarification for what is currently a loose collection of strategies, this reference delves into the â€œground and poundâ€ fighting methodâ€”winning a fight by striking an opponent after a takedown. Demonstrating through fight metrics how just as many matches are won by strikes as submissions, this manual addresses the importance of proper â€œgroundingâ€ and lists an array of riding, pinning, and transitioning skills. Following the first element up by introducing an exhaustive â€œpoundingâ€ vocabulary, this guide is key to making stand-up strikers all the more formidable on the floor. Guaranteed to improve the game of even the best submission players, this handbook ensures tighter defense and enhanced offensive tactics, offering a one-stop solution for this vital but often overlooked aspect of the mixed martial arts arena.
