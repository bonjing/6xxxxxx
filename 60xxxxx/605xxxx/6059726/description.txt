D9
Various Artists
[DVSP-0026] 2005
FLAC
Neoclassical, Trance

If you've been following my torrent uploads, you know I love Diverse System and want to share more of their very high-quality, yet underexposed trance. D9 is yet another good release by Diverse System, and there are a few very pretty tracks on the disc. This is yet another Bemani arrange album, but done well. As far as an overall theme to the disc, "mysterious and wonderment" would be fairly accurate. Give "quasar -angelic blue mix-" by Thanatos a check, as a work of some really engaging, violin-accented trance. The second highlight track is "Ende" by qurter (of RIGHT STUFF), for something a bit more uplifting. "[SoftWare]STARFIELD" is also nice.

All in all, a good album if you're a fan of pads, violins, and multi-layered lead synths in your trance music, hard to go wrong with D9 =]

Make up your own mind on this album, there's sure to be something you'll like. Enjoy!
