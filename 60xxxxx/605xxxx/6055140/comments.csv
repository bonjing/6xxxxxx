,ilhares,2010-12-30T02:09Z,"I imagine he was referring to Portman being pregnant.  Childbirth is gonna stretch that girl out.

Still, nice film overall."

,awesomewelles,2011-01-16T14:20Z,no audio! WTF?!
,djmopa,2011-01-16T22:50Z,"Superb Quality, great audio, just watched it on the tv. Very sick twisted movie, but the lady loved it!"
,djmopa,2011-01-16T22:53Z,"For those who do not have AUDIO, you probably are missing the correct audio codecs. If you have a really good DVD player that plays divx movies, you should be able to watch it on your tv or computer with no problem.

I put this on a memory stick, plugged it into my tv's USB and it played perfectly."
,djmopa,2011-01-16T22:56Z,"Superb Quality and Audio. 

If the audio is not playing correctly, you are probably missing divx audio codecs on your pc.

I put this on a memory stick, plugged in into my tv and it worked beautifully.

The movie is good, though a bit twisted, the women love this kind of stuff."
