 Also, if anyone with a linux os wants this game, I will upload the 'natives' and the other things necessary to play. Just leave a comment."
,NanoEntity,2010-12-22T22:17Z,"Very nice job XD

Note: Beta is still buggy, and of course Broke every single plug-in again, grr...."
,flamingdeath,2010-12-22T22:34Z,hey im seeding now. downloads fast and your torrents always work
,Tomonomonous,2010-12-23T00:30Z,"yeah im on ubuntu, upload natives pretty please :)"
,narfdude,2010-12-23T01:55Z,"I think breaking plugins is part of notch's goal for every update. :p

Linux people, go here for minecraft stuff : http://timashley.me/node/596 .  That has more info than I would be willing to give. If you download mc from there, add the new music and minecraft.jar to make it up to date."
,Rodef2099,2010-12-23T02:04Z,beta is still extemely buggy and multiplayer performance has never been worst.... hMOD will only be updated on 24th dec... so all the servers running vanilla are griefer havens.... lol
,Apathetic_Killer,2010-12-24T00:12Z,"beta is broken, i bought it, and its soo laggy, its horrid, shouldnt of bought it."
,moosoo96,2010-12-26T23:59Z,failed to lod main class coz it cant find the jar file. even though its in the folder.
,ST4Rt,2010-12-28T18:36Z,"I only get Minecraft.jar .. a java file and a ""version""
But i cant open the minecraft file :s any help :)?
thanx anyway:)"
,narfdude,2010-12-30T11:47Z,@ST4Rt  this is only an update for minecraft. get a different torrent to get the other files needed to play it. most of my previous minecraft uploads have everything included.
,SteakHache,2010-12-31T04:26Z,"Thank you!!! If you got the times and the know-how can you do the same thing you did here:
http://timashley.me/node/596 but for the beta?"
,narfdude,2011-01-02T09:50Z,"@SteakHache I haven't tried it, but you can probably just add all the new files in to make it beta."
,DiMarko,2011-01-15T22:03Z,"Hey just wondering, how would I go around to packing up my own entire Minecraft folder so I can give it to a friend? I tried before and it didn't work correctly for them. Trying to give them my copy because all my mods are still working."
,narfdude,2011-01-17T21:46Z,@DiMarko the folder where minecraft is: \appdata\roaming\.minecraft. If you have windows xp then its: \application data\.minecraft.
,narfdude,2011-01-20T19:33Z,"@dimarko sorry for that almost useless info. i forgot to type in the second part of what i was gonna say.

you can zip that folder and email it to your friend. tell them to put it into one of those locations previously mentioned."
