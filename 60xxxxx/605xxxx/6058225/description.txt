Kitten on the Keys is a San Francisco based burlesque performer. Sweet, charming, funny and amazingly talented. She has currently been touring through Europe a lot this past year and been filming a movie or two over there. This is her first, and I think only album and well worth the download. Then go see her perform if you can. You won't be disappointed.
