A Flock Of Seagulls - Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You) [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)" is a 1982 New Wave song by A Flock of Seagulls, appearing as the opening performance on their second album Listen. Its wistful, bleak lyrics on separation are built on a driving rhythm backed by a heavy Wall of Sound-styled layer of synthesizer padding.

In contrast to the band's 1982 hit "I Ran (So Far Away)", which was largely a United States and Australian hit, "Wishing" song peaked strongly in Great Britain, Ireland and in Canada where it reached the Top 10, but only reached #26 on the U.S. Billboard charts in summer 1983.

In a celebration of early electronic music, digital radio station BBC 6 Music compiled a chart of its listeners' favourite synthesizer riffs in November 2006. "Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)" came second in the list to the Tubeway Army single "Are 'Friends' Electric?".

The song holds the rare distinction of having been performed almost entirely on the black keys of a keyboard. In addition, the original version of this song clocked in at nearly 14 minutes.

Along with "Telecommunication" song, Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You) earned the praise of legendary producer Phil Spector, who, while emerging from seclusion in the 1980s to produce an album by The Ramones, called the track "breathtaking" and expressed interest in producing A Flock of Seagulls.
