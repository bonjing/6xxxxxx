I THOUGHT EVERYBODY KNOWS WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL SP3 32 BIT OPERATING SYSTEMS,NOW A DAYS,MOST COMPUTER ARE INTEGRATED SATA HDD,BUT OUR FAVORITES OS I MEAN WINDOWS XP.DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE SATA DISK,OTHERWISE HE CAN'T SUPPORT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY,THAT'S WHY I CUSTOMIZED THIS WINDOWS XP DISK WITH NLITE,I ADDED ONLY WINDOWS XP SP3 UPDATE PACKAGE,DOWNLOAD FROM MICROSOFT.COM...AND I TESTED IT ON VIRTUAL BOX,AND IT FULLY WORKED
DURING THE INSTALLATION ABOUT 33 MIN,A WINDOWS SHOULD POP UP,IT WILL ASK SOME INFORMATION,AND THE CD KEY DISK,SO DON'T WORRY,LEAVE IT BLANK,JUST INSTALL IT WITHOUT KEY,BUT THE OS IS NOT ACTIVATED,AFTER INSTALLING IT,GO IN THE DOWNLOAD FOLDER(U WILL SEE WINDOWS XP PRO WITH SP3 GENUINE,JUST DO A DOUBLE CLICK IN THIS FOLDER,U'LL SEE AVCTIVATOR.EXE,INSTALL IT)AT THE END THE SYSTEMS IS AVTIVATE AND GENUINE,AND U WILL BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE FULL UPDATE,BY GOING IN WINDOWS UPDATE,CLICK EXPRESS,AND YOUR COMPUTER WILL SUCCESSFULLY UPDATE................

DOWNLOAD IT,AND BURN THE ISO WITH UR CD BURNING SOFTWARE(POWER ISO,ULTA ISO,ROXIO,NERO,MAGIC ISO)
