Without reservation, Blue Train can easily be considered in and among the most important and influential entries not only of John Coltrane's career, but of the entire genre of jazz music as well.

Blue Train is a jazz album by John Coltrane, recorded on September 15, 1957 at the Van Gelder Studio. It is considered Coltrane's first solo album, as it is the first he recorded featuring musicians and songs entirely of his choosing. All of the compositions were written by Coltrane, save one. The title track is a long, rhythmically variegated blues with a brooding minor theme that gradually shifts to major during Coltrane's first chorus. "Locomotion" is also a blues riff tune, in thirty-two-bar form.

Coltrane's next major LP, Giant Steps (1959), would break new melodic and harmonic ground in jazz, whereas Blue Train adheres to the hard bop style of the era. Two of its songs, "Moment's Notice" and "Lazy Bird", demonstrate Coltrane's first recorded use of Coltrane changes, which he would later expand upon on Giant Steps.

Blue Train remains an extremely popular disc, and during a 1960 interview Coltrane described it as his favorite album of his own up to that point.
