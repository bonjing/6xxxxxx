On Christmas Eve, Lawrence and Linda are stuck at the airport waiting for the former's parents to arrive. Phineas and 
Ferb, convert the top of their house into a large, extravagant rest stop for Santa Claus, complete with a sauna, massage 
table, satellite TV, eliptical center to work off milk and cookies, milk and cookies, special reindeer feeding center,
