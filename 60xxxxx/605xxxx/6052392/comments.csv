"" The audio is not supported on this device, do not try to adjust the audio.. Any ideas what it could be? The software is up to date and your previous downloads are fine. Thank you"

,ilikemonkeys,2011-01-12T07:59Z,I really must commend you on this release. I bought the movie on Blu-Ray but unfortunately it doesn't come with a digital copy. There is no way in fuck that I'm paying another $25. Anyways... this is a great release has pretty much all the meta data for iTunes! OUTSTANDING.
,Laxidate,2011-01-27T20:10Z,"For future reference: don't put .mp4 in the title when its not .mp4, it's .m4v"
[V],HolyRoses,2011-01-30T23:00Z,is same thing.
