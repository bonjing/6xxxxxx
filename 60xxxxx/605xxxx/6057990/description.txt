      Episode 36: Konkey Dong                                                 
      In the exciting conclusion to our primate-inspired trilogy, we          
      introduce to you the fearsome KONKEY DONG! A new gorilla idol           
      appears on Ape Mountain (when the banana tree is visible). Drop a       
      pygmy into the grip of the stone gorilla, and the real gorilla,         
      Konkey, will come and kidnap the Pygmy! If another Pygmy is around      
      to witness, he will attempt a rescue and start the mini-game Konkey     
      Dong. This is our biggest mini-game yet. Inspired by the old school     
      arcade game of yore, it has 5 levels and they are as addicting as       
      they are challenging! Tilt the device to move left or right, tap        
      the right to jump, hold the upper left to climb up a ladder, and        
      the lower left to climb down a ladder. Avoid rolling boulders and       
      beetles!                                                                
      With this episode, we've included the Japanese Skin Pack to give        
      the islands an Eastern flare!  Turn the dodo into an origami crane,     
      the octopus statue into Buddha; decorate the islands with bamboo        
      and lilies, and more!                                                   
      And finally, we've included a Fishmas custom pack absolutely free!      
      We threw this in at the last minute just so we could include the        
      Fishmas Carol, as a dance. This music was specially created for the     
      "Pocket God Fishmas Special" to be released Dec 18. Fishmas is just     
      like Christmas, except with it involves lots of dead fish!              
      Still haven't had enough Pygmy? For iPad users, be sure to check        
      out Pocket God: Journey To Uranus! A brand new Pocket God game          
      where the Pygmies travel from Earth, to space, and finally to           
      Uranus, the gas planet! If people don't already envy your iPad          
      enough now, wait till they see you Journey to Uranus!                   
      And then there are two new issues of Pocket God the comic! First,       
      the exciting conclusion to the "Gem of Life" will have Ooga making      
      his way to his confrontation with the gods. But not before he's         
      attacked by Pygmy Zombies! Plus we have a special Holiday issue,        
      "Xmas Marks the Spot", where the pygmies travel to the ice island       
      where they confront a half naked Santa Clause, mutant pygmies and       
      the giant ice monster!                                                  
      More info can be found at our blog and Facebook page.                   
                                               
                        
      What kind of god would you be? Benevolent or vengeful? Play Pocket      
      God and discover the answer within yourself. On a remote island,        
      you are the all-powerful god that rules over the primitive              
      islanders. You can bring new life, and then take it away just as        
      quickly. Exercise your powers on the islanders. Lift them in the        
      air, alter gravity, hit them with lightning...you're the island         
      god! All god powers are demonstrated in Pocket God's help menu.         
      Pocket God is an episodic microgame for you to explore, show your       
      friends and have fun with. We have been growing the game with the       
      help of player suggestions! What sort of godly powers would you         
      like to see added?
