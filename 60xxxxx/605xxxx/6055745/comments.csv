,muckymucks,2010-12-31T02:28Z,"Thanks for the up, BONE. I've been meaning to watch this doc. Heard nothing but good things."
,chiefbucknell,2011-01-01T21:21Z,"It looks and sounds great, but the audio is out of sync for me, as well (Mac 10.6 in Quicktime)."
,hauntnut,2011-01-24T08:13Z,"I, too, had sync issues, and I attempted to play it on my desktop PC, my laptop, and my PS3; had the same issue on each device. Pretty sure this is a problem with the file."
,ezemeat,2011-02-21T10:21Z,yeah audio is out of sync - but if you convert it to an AVI its good again. Used Format Factory myself (tested on my pc & ps3 - streamed/copied)
,jonty43,2011-02-22T15:21Z,I had same audio sync issue on mac with quicktime but opening in VLC (free - google it) sorted it out fine so try this alternative :)
,PattieLennon,2011-09-25T09:27Z,"FAST download! Nice work. The audio isn't synched, however, I took the advice of jonty43 and opened it in VLC and it was perfect. Thanks for the upload, I'm seeding now...."
