Time for a guest photographer to take a few pictures. Aspiring photographer Bell wanted to take a few pictures of her own, and called Dixie to model. Bell's never done anything like this before, and the shots came out quite well. Good job Bell!

Dixie is one of those people who loves everything and everyone. She especially loves modeling and can take on any theme, pose, or expression. She's got great skill for someone just starting out, and has a long career ahead of her. Plus she roller skates. Not roller blade like you'd see on some beachside walkway. No, I mean roller skate like at the roller rink. Or roller derby. I don't know if she likes roller derby, but I be she'd be good at it. Maybe hockey, too.
