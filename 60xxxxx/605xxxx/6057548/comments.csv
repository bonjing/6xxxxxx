,cashcashcash,2011-01-29T19:20Z,"Had not  been watching out for when the next book was due out, checked today and bam here it is. Thanks dude or dudet. No way I could afford to buy this and as I am dyslexic, no way I could read it through a book of this length without finding something small and furry to victimise on regular intervals. There is no telling how many small mammels you have saved. Thanks again"
