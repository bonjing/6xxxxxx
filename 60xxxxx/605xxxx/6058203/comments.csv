,Sumiha,2010-12-22T06:50Z,think they(fame girls site) found out the ads here disposing of uppers left and right so they release all the tame sets...
,TPBWhore,2010-12-22T10:41Z,"That's possible Sumiha but they have yet to realize that they're cutting their own throats by releasing trash sets, especially now that the FF girls are 18+. 

If I didn't have to worry about these trash sets and knew I'd get to see the good stuff EVERY week, I would actually PAY top dollar for a monthly subscription. 

As long as they're hit and miss like this, they'll never see a penny from me.

...just my $0.02"

,jimmyjojr,2010-12-22T11:28Z,I just wish they would release sets that were taken this year. Most of them are 1-2yrs old and taken when the site was new or in some cases when it was still FF-models. 
,aftyrbyrn,2010-12-22T13:36Z,Sears Catalog.  That's where they are going to end up.  All of them but Ella.
,aftyrbyrn,2010-12-22T13:38Z,"Ella should save the week.  Christmas eve and all, send us an angel, scantily clad."
