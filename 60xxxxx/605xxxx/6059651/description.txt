New Song from Belle Starr & The Gunslingers

Merry Christmas to u all!





Im coming home for Christmas
Forgive me for being so callus
I forgive you for being so vicious
Can we put the bad things behind us?

If You Do light a candle for me
Place it in your window for me to see

Then I wont rest tonight
Until I see that candle light
I wont rest tonight
Until I have you in sight

Im coming home for Christmas
Can we start over from zero?
Honey will you share your halo?
Will you hang your mistletoe?

Will you light a candle for me?
Place it in your window for me to see

Then I wont rest tonight
Until I see that candle light
I wont rest tonight
Until I have you in sight

Im coming for Christmas
Im coming home to you
If you still think that I will do
Then I promise you that IÂ´ll come through

Honey light a candle for me
Place it in your window for me to see

Then I wont rest tonight
Until I see that candle light
I wont rest tonight
Until I have you in sight
