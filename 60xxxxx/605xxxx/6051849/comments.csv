,Shunnabunich,2010-12-20T23:12Z,"Seems to work great! Only complaint is that I can't change key settings â€” the settings application that opens before Crazy Taxi doesn't seem to ""get"" my key presses â€” and I can't seem to exit a game in progress without, well, quitting the app. :P All things considered, though, it performs wonderfully and is still as fun as it used to be.

The icon is a kinda low-res, white-fringed image of the full (i.e. really wide) Crazy Taxi logo, so for those inclined, here's a more Leopard-friendly icon:

http://cl.ly/3hxh

To install it: 

- right-click on the ""Crazy Taxi"" application, and select ""Show Package Contents"" from the menu that appears. A new Finder window will open.

- Go into the ""Contents"" folder in that window, then the ""Resources"" folder within.

- Drag and drop the ""crazy.icns"" file into that folder. You can close that Finder window now.

- Right-click on the ""Crazy Taxi"" app again, but this time choose ""Get Info"". A tall window will pop up with various information about the app.

- At the very top, it shows the application's icon. Click on it; you should now see a blue haze around it, showing that it's selected.

- Use the Command-X keyboard shortcut to remove the old icon, allowing the new one to take its place. Close the Get Info window, and you're done!"

,dimplez09,2011-01-03T03:43Z,"it doesn't work for me . it can't be mounted because it doesn't end in .dmg , help . please ?"
,Shunnabunich,2011-01-08T10:12Z,"@srd67: No prob, glad you liked it!

@dimplez09: it's a ZIP archive, so there's nothing you need to mount as a disk. Just open it with OS X's Archive Utility (or The Unarchiver, or whatever you use), and you should get the application itself out the other end."
