It's often impossible to get the game to install on XP. However, all that's really needed to make it run is a registry modification.

If your CD Rom drive is D:,  then simply install "XP hack.reg"

If not, edit the text file "XP hack edit me.txt"

Edit both " Path"= " and @=  TO MATCH THE FOLDER YOU downloaded this game to. Then afterwards, rename "XP hack edit me.txt" to "XP hack edit me.reg"

Install "XP hack edit me.txt", and hit JOCKEY.EXE to play.
