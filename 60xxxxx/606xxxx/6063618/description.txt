So here is the Imaginations trough the Looking Glass DVD of Blind Guardian.

Both DVD's got entcrypted and the first one (with the Concert) was shrinked to DVD5 size.

You still have the DVD Menu for selecting the Songs or the Settings like Subs, with nearly no Quality loss.


So Enjoy and Seed! ;D
