Der ewige Jude
Year: 1940
Director: Fritz Hippler

Nazi documentary about Jews. 
Horrible and disgusting. How such evil had existed in our world?
The Jews of Poland (invaded by Germany in 1939) are depicted as filthy, evil, corrupt, and intent on world domination. Street scenes are shown prejudicially, along with clips from Jewish cinema of the day and photos of Jewish celebrities, while the narrator "explains" the Jewish problem. The climax and resolution of the film is Hitler's 1939 announcement that the Jewish race will meet its "annihilation".
