But the usa version will officially come out 01/05/11.  as for this being the Japanese or not it does not matter all that much since it was originally made in english.

,fakebest,2010-12-30T10:24Z,"@mpaci1 what do you use to load wii games? the wii is not cut and dry as the xbox 360 is with loading games it depends on how your wii is modded and what you use( USB loaders from HDD,flash drive, or SD are best, then neogamma for dvd disc, then a mod chip which as far as I know all new games have protection that modchips have not been updated to bypass there is probably some new hardware to do so but soft mod is free and superior in terms of features and ease of use once you get learn what to do."
