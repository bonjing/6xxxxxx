Best regards,

@ks85: I have that Bergman, but only as rather small mp4 (and not iPod compatible) due to weird frame-size.

@sonukhem: Similar as above... but I can send you a direct link if you can find my e.mail address in few long Headers of my recent torrents (just click on my screen-name)."

Thanks for the encode(s)/upload.

I thought they weren't even going to air the last episodes of Running Wilde and yet you have it - legend!

Cheers
Jon"
