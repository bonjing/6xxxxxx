This is the loader for this torrent....


About:
This is the loader application thats used by millions of people worldwide,
well known for passing Microsoft\'s WAT (Windows Activation Technologies) and is arguably the safest Windows activation exploit ever created.
The application itself injects a SLIC (Software Licensing Description Table) into your system before Windows boots,
this is what fools Windows into thinking it\'s genuine.

Features
-Can be run as a standalone application
-Works well with all system languages
-Argument support for silent installs
-Can be used for pre-activation
-Application integrity checking
-Custom error handling
-Support for hidden partitions and complex setups
-Can work alongside Linux\'s GRUB or any other boot manager
-Works with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption applications
-Add your own certificates and serials externally
-Offers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1
-Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)

The rundown
-This will run on x86 and x64 systems
-This can activate all Windows versions at the same time, just install it on each
-No core system files get modified
-No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM
-All key parts of the exploit are encrypted with a custom encryption
-The exploit runs before Windows so it\'s harder for Microsoft to prevent
-The exploit patches all necessary tables making activation look authentic
-The application will select the best profile for your system during installation
-Each and every user has a unique version of the exploit installed on his/her system

Extra information
Do I need to update ?
If you have installed a version and you\'re activated then you shouldn\'t need to update.
If however you are like me and you like to use the latest and the best versions of software then updating shouldn\'t be a problem.

If You Used ANY Other Activation Method, Read This:
Using a BIE release or another activation solution ?
-Launch the loader application and select to uninstall â€” This is important
-Restart the PC
-Install the loader and restart the PC
-Visit the following website to revalidate Windows: www.microsoft.com/genuine/ (You might need to use IE8)

How can I convert from RemoveWAT to this loader ?
-Uninstall RemoveWAT
-Download and run Fix WAT:
(Cleans up things RemoveWAT doesn\'t restore. This will restart your PC)
-Install the loader
-Visit the following website to revalidate Windows: www.microsoft.com/genuine/ (You might need to use IE8)

Help, my system won\'t boot !
-Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
-Select the \"Repair your computer\" option
-Select \"Command Prompt\"
-Input \"bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force\" (Without quotes)
-Restart the PC

Additional Notes:
I should note that sometimes \"Board:\" will display the systems model instead. This really depends on how your manufacturer set things up so it\'s not a bug.
- Anyone whos previously used the loader and it\'s failed to boot them into Windows so they\'ve used the bootsect command should first uninstall and reboot before installing the new version.
- Common questions with answers can now be found in the read me file.
