someone told me ""Just to let you know, the episodes aren't labeled correctly. Episode 1 turns out to be episode 26. S01E02 is episode 1.""

So just keep that in mind.

Sorry about that."
,koriar,2011-03-17T19:27Z,"Just to confirm does this mean that each episode is pushed one forward? Episode 3 is labeled episode 2, episode 4 is labeled episode 3 and so on?

Or does it mean that Episode 2 is missing and just those two are mislabeled?"
,just.dont,2011-04-23T12:16Z,"All episodes are shifted.
E01 -> E26, and the rest should be shifted down. E02 is E01, E03 is E02, etc."
