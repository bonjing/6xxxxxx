A personal share for my friends. Usefull for other people in case you need rather up-to-date data files from 2010-12-08 and don't want to download via ftp from Gravity Korea. Included is data.grf (renamed to sdata.grf) and rdata.grf. Patched Sakexe.exe client version 2009-06-17a. German language data folder. No sclientinfo.xml included.
Can be used with eAthena PacketVer 2008-11-26.
Anybody who doesn't know what this is or how to use it, please ignore.
