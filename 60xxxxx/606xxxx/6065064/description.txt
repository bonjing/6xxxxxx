It is assumed that all Indian foods are spicy & full of fat/oils.
So a health conscious person or a cholesterol level conscious heart patient can not eat those.

Here are the recipe of conventional Indian food items without a drop of oil. This invention is by SAAOL. Dr. Bimal Chhajer have invented this method with the help of a local dietitians. This food habit is an ideal way to live with heart disease/Cholesterol problem. Even this high level of restriction in food habit can also help reduce cholesterol so much that with some medications a person can also avoid heart surgery(bypass Surgery).

This is not a mere cooking show of conventional Indian food item cooking. Rather its a medical science revealed in India to live Indians healthy. Here doctor even appear as cook; as according the doc living on wrong food habit & only taking medicines & operations on heart can not cure heart disease.

'WHO' is also suspecting Heart Disease would be a one of the big reason in future in mortality ate of India.
