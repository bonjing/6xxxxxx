From the stageplay by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman. Whistle Down the WInd is a great play to watch during the Holidays.

This is the stagepaly from 1996 in Washington. It tells the story of several sisters who believe that the escaped killer, they are hiding in the barn, is in fact Jesus Christ.

Great songs great play
