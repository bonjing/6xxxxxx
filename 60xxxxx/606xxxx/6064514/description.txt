(ripped by Gorgon Freeman)

World of Warcraft is 6 years and 3 expansion packs old.

I've decided to share all of the wonderful music of this game.

These are the Soundtrack CD's that have been part of the Collector's Editions of the games:

World of Warcraft
The Burning Crusade
Wrath of the Lich King
Cataclysm

All of these musics are ripped losslessly in FLAC format (compression level 5 for those who must know).

So, a happy Winter Veil to all of you, and keep sharing the goodies!

Please post comments if there are problems with this upload, and rate it up if you like it and would like to see more goodies!

(Note! The Original World of Warcraft soundtrack isn't ripped by me, but by KevMantis here on TPB, all credit goes to him for sharing that.)
