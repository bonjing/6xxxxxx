,RooJo434,2010-12-24T00:32Z,"it won't let me upload the links for the screens when i click edit torrent, it's starting to piss me off"
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T00:44Z,"i'll try and upload the rest of the photos tommorow, the piratebay pisses me off sometimes with the edit torrent thing messing up"
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T00:54Z,"finally done, sorry for not uploading screens everyone"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-24T16:38Z,"all of your screens are at the wrong AR, stretched video.  basically a useless waste of time.  unless you prefer things to be all morphed and whacked, then of course this is probably great."
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T17:43Z,"please simplify the things you're saying because i don't understand how this is stretched video, and what is AR mate, please explain to me"
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T17:45Z,"ahh aspect ratio they aren't the wrong aspect ratio they're 1920x800, try opening them with a differant browser like opera"
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T17:48Z,"or you can click on a link for a screen and save it to your computer and see that it's 1920x800?
have you downloaded it HolyRoses?"
,RooJo434,2010-12-24T21:38Z,can people who are finished give me some feedback on what you think of the quality plz?
,Reakenfrag,2010-12-25T14:35Z,screens look great at any rate 
,Reakenfrag,2010-12-26T12:33Z,"and at that bit rate... happy, looked good.. full hd monitor"
,RooJo434,2010-12-26T14:33Z,"thanks, glad you're happy with it"
,tonyromano777,2010-12-29T23:38Z,Thanks bro :-)
,RooJo434,2010-12-30T18:25Z,you're welcome tonyromano777
,Ondur,2011-01-03T15:21Z,"Wonderful, thank you! 10/10"
,RooJo434,2011-01-03T18:29Z,"i will be uploading saw vii 1080p encoded by myself and the quality is nearly exactly the same as source and it is 1.07gb, nearly exactly 1gb but just a bit over"
,RooJo434,2011-01-03T18:33Z,"i will be uploading saw vii 2010 1080p encoded by myself and converted at a high enough bitrate to maintain enough quality, the quality is nearly exactly the same as the 1080p source and is 1.07gb just over 1gb, i will upload it when my internet is better because it's shite at the moment"
,btimmer30,2011-01-18T18:12Z,"he's right the video is stretched. it looks aweful. and I know what I'm doing I'm not an idiot. I converted it to mpeg 2, i kept the same aspect ration of 2.4:1. the resolution says it is still 1920x800, but it is all screwed up. it looks like the picture is 4:3 You are doing an aweful job. instead of being stubborn just admit that this is aweful and try to fix your mistakes, because youre not helping anyone"
,RooJo434,2011-01-20T17:54Z,ok i have taken your comment into account and i am sorry about stretching the aspect ratio and in 4:3 but the source was in the same resolution so im sorry for the inconvenience but im watching it on my blu ray player and i have the original blu ray and id say in my personal opinion that it doesnt look much worse than original blu ray
