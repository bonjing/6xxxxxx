The Complete 7-disc "Icon: Dinu Lipatti" boxed set ripped in FLAC. Within this set one finds nearly all of Lipatti's (unfortunately) short recorded output. A Romanian pianist who produced ethereal, pure, and devoted music, Lipatti died of Hodgkin's Disease in 1950 at the age of thirty-three. The greatest thing I find myself wondering as I listen to this set is what this genius would have been able to do had he lived longer and recorded more. How would he play other works by these composers, or the works of other composers entirely, such as Rachmaninoff, Busoni, Alkan, Debussy, Hamelin, or Kapustin? What he did leave is incredible; my favorite recordings are probably the Chopin Waltzes. But, enough of this. Download it for yourself and hear some truly magnificent music.
