The Pilgrim Progress (1979)

The Timeless Classic...now available on DVD!

John Bunyan's immortal classic springs to life in this full-length feature presentation.

Although three centuries have passed, the dynamic message of Pilgrim's Progress speaks as clearly and meaningfully to today's generation as it did in John Bunyan's time.

Portrayed by an excellent professional cast, you will follow Pilgrim through many exciting and challenging adventures as the allegory unfolds: The Slough Of Despond, The Hill Of Difficulty, Vanity Fair, Pliable, Mr. Obstinate, Mr. Wordly Wiseman, Evangelist, Mr. Interpreter, and Apollyon, constantly plotting to keep Christian from reaching the Celestial City.

Filmed in the beauty of Northern Ireland. Narrated by George Beverly Shea with original music performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Academy Award Nominated actor Liam Neeson in his first big-screen production
