Radio sitcom about a fantasy novelist who is whisked away to a parallel universe.

Sam Porter is a misanthropic fantasy novelist whose best friend is his pet dog Amis. While at a book signing in Totnes High Street, three people, whom Sam presumes are hard-core fantasy fans dressed in full costume, kidnap Amis. Sam fights them and during the fight, both Sam and Amis end up in an actual fantasy world - Lower Earth.

Sam learns that the three kidnappers, Vidar the Elf Lord, Penthiselea the Warrior Princess and Dean the Dwarf kidnapped Amis for he is "The Chosen One" who will find The Sword of Asnagar, a mythical weapon of great power, "for whoso'er wields the sword shall rule all of Lower Earth".
