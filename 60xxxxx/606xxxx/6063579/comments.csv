,jarman007,2010-12-25T05:54Z,"Thanks for the  movie.......+1
what diff. does 480p make.......if i view both 720p and 480p in full screen mode .will they have same quality if same bitrate......



and notting hill was great......it is now one of my favorite romantic movie......great quality too..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T07:03Z,"@rakiem
soon bro

@jarman
welcome...when u finish the download of this then do this

"" if u use KMplayer then open the movie right click go to pan&scan -> presets -> zoom to ultra widescreen...

if u use media playerclassic then go to view -> pan&scan -> zoom to ultra widescreen...""

do the same with any of my 720p's in which i hv used 750kbps video bitrate....
u'll see that this will look a little bit better...when bit rate is too low for 720p then it flickers(like tubelight u can say..u'll see it mostly in movement scenes, very light movement scenes too like when someone moves his head here and there)....i hv realized this now...thats why i hv started using high bitrate for 720p's...atleast this high so that it may nt flicker...

ya nd i knew that u will love notting hill..i dont think there would be anyone who would watch it and will say i didnt liked it....it is a superb movie..."

,i_am_sid,2010-12-25T07:16Z,"@prashant
Can you tell me any software to remove one audio from a dual audio movie. I tried to google it, but didnt find much help. Virtual dub didnt work for me. 
And by the way, is this movie worth watching?"
,i_am_sid,2010-12-25T07:25Z,"@prashant
Piranah BluRay is out. Will you encode it?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T07:49Z,"@sid
Merry Christmas..
Use mkvmerge...
I'll only encode it if I get too many requests for it..because I think its a horror which I don't like..

Nd bt watched this one yet.."
[T],frapper101,2010-12-25T07:59Z,"@i m sid:
use mkvextract extarct all the tracks (video, audio and subs)
then use mkvmerge,  select the video track and ur desired audio track and mux it
it hardly takes a minute to do so

,jarman007,2010-12-25T08:20Z,when will you start doing the list ........the one that you decided some time back........there were great movies in it...
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T08:34Z,"@frapper
merry christmas...no it proved to be good as u also gave the links to download the s/w..thanks

@himansu
merry christmas..n did u checked ur pm on 1337x???

@jarman
merry christmas..
because they look good for limited screen size...
nd also some who do 480p's do that in less size like rapidripper...means less bitrate...
a good example is look my Salt rip the way i said to look...
look any scorp's rip he uses less bitrate than me..on my 21' some of his rips flicker even without zooming..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T08:40Z,"@jarman
next is himansu's request...after that it is atonement(from the list)..."
,jarman007,2010-12-25T09:04Z,"ok
whats the name of nxt....

where is DSIN.......he hasn't comment for last few days........atonement is his request i think ....."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T09:57Z,"@jarman
WE had a very rough talk turned in a fight..I don't think he will be commenting any more...and I would love that too..
Atonement is kahna's request.."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T10:05Z,oh and next is stranger than fiction another good movie...
,jarman007,2010-12-25T10:12Z,oh......i didn't know.....

stranger than fiction looks like a good movie.....
thanks"
,akindayimcan,2010-12-25T12:11Z,"thank u for this one...+1
and waiting for our list from you :)="
,DSIN,2010-12-25T12:36Z,"@jarman : Wasn't much of a fight... it was a complete demolition... he ended up deleting his torrent.. LOL :D
@prashant : ure wrong AGAIN.. i'll comment on the torrent i dload.. since notting was a chick flick.. it would've been a waste & i've already watched this clooney's american.. so another one i'm skipping.... 
Will wait for the some of the great List movies(my requested ones & red cliff, thin red line, lord of war & the game) if u do go on to upload it i.e. till then saiyonara :-P
P.s : its a shame... but can't be helped.. A Rock/Metal music fan like me and a  biever/ gaga maniac can't be friends for long.. u know wat i mean :) 
@Others : No need for ""showing off"" comments & licking uploader's feet... i do respect goku61 for his encodes/uploads  .. just not as a person ;)"
,kanha,2010-12-25T12:41Z,"@prashant22
merry christmas buddy....

thanks in advance for Attonement........

[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T13:47Z,"@mzk,akind,kanha
Merry Christmas nd welcome..

@DSIN
I knew u will come up with ur shit again...who cares..
And goku61(neither as an encoder nor as a person) don't need respect from an asshole...
and no one is liking my feet if they respect me I do respect them...everyone knows that..who the fuck r u to tell them what should they do..no one..they have brain better than u..and ya respect one thing is clear no here respects u for sure...
P.s if there is a maniac it is u.."
,jarman007,2010-12-25T13:52Z,"@DSIN
i don't know about the fight between you and prashant.....so will not comment on that....

as for ""showing off"" comments....you were always the one with most........

i respect both prashant and his uploads........he puts all his efforts for these movies we request for nothing in return.....
he takes most of our requests....heck! he took your most requests..........i dont know why you started fighting.........

i think you both should stop fighting......u were the one with the best comments,suggestions (don't like admitting but yes )"
,rakiem,2010-12-25T14:27Z,"to my friends
MERRY XMAS..enjoy the last week of the year:)"
,kanha,2010-12-25T14:37Z,"@prashant & DSIN
where and when u'r fight took, i didn't know....
as i can't see any such comments in u'r previous torrents.....

i hope u both stop fighting and be friends again....
be cool....both of u..."
,DSIN,2010-12-25T15:05Z,"^thanx for that comment jarman.. 
but u can see from ur uploader's comment that he has lost it ... he's actually swearing (hard to believe right) LOL 
i can always patch up with anyone (u already know that) but not everyone is mature like u :)

@prashant : i'm just gonna ignore ur comment.. or u'll end up deleting this torrent too LOL.. ^^

P.s : Merry Christmas to all (including u uploader) ^^
"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T15:18Z,"@DSIN
Ya i know why u'll ignore my comment..ur trying to be a good guy or I should say pretending...bt I give respect to everyone nd ur respect is in being called u know what right...
"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T15:29Z,Oh and maturity how funny the most immature person talking abt maturity...lol real funny...
,jarman007,2010-12-25T15:41Z,can anyone tell what was the argument about.......
,jarman007,2010-12-25T15:49Z,"@ DSIN....

i patched things up with u not u because prashant said we should not fight

u were not stopping so i decided i should stop.......
"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T16:03Z,"@jarman
leave it dude...no use...
i know i dont need to prove myself correct infront of u guys...and it will take time to explain u the whole thing...time is nt a big problem though bt it will take lot of writing..

earlier i was the one who was stopping his fights(with u,muthineni n i think one more)...
this guy dont know when to do what..."
,DSIN,2010-12-25T16:04Z,"@prashant : hahahaha pretending to be a good guy ROFL
get this straight... i don't giv a fuck wat anyone thinks .... but at the same time.. i won't stoop to ur level & argue AGAIN.. u'll just end up crying like last time ... i know its hard to comprehend anythin wen u r not thinking straight..maybe iam immature but so r u :D
@jarman : it was basically him sayin godfather is boring & overrated & me confirming avatar being a crappy shit (which it actually is).. it just turned out that the chick-flick loving uploader liked avatar too much LOL :)"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T16:28Z,"@mkz
moulin rouge page...

@DSIN
my last say...
u hv lost all ur respect first thing...
second if u hv some self respect left then dont bother commenting on my pages again...

@jarman
ok u know how the fight started...i was again trying to make him stop fighting with mzk..."
,jarman007,2010-12-25T16:28Z,"i haven't seen godfather but i really want to see it .....have been for any of our uploaders to upload it..........
avatar i found boring , it doesn't matter if it had great graphics as it had a crappy , boring story...........it is one-time-viewing movie.......it is only great if u watch it in theatre in 3D....

but it is no reason to fight about ......its one's opinion........."
,prank0007,2010-12-25T16:44Z,"Its christmas guys patch up!!!
every1 has likes n dislikes of movies.some hav other tastes n sum hav other...so respect that

@goku+@DSIN=patch up!!!"
,muthineni,2010-12-25T16:54Z,"@everyone
so arguement about movies eh..?
i think godfather was one of the finest movies every made ( one of my top3) and at the same time avatar is  not a bad movie. its not even a average movie. its just a average  script ( dats the minus of movie) made with extraordinary effects and eye candy..overall a must see for a normal movie goer
but people who see too many good movies and want a stronger script will realise that avatar is over rated ( of course it is ) and go to other end and call it crap. but its not . its atleast a good movie with a bad scrip. fact.
@ dsin
buddy for the sake of having so many goku encodes, u have to make the first move and stop any msg from now on.come on ur a rational person.let go"
,i_am_sid,2010-12-25T16:55Z,"@frapper101
Thanks a lot mate for giving your time."
,muthineni,2010-12-25T17:00Z,"@ prashanth
you r a very patient person.. answering every crappy question about encodes and thanking evry comment in return.. why dont u leave this one too.
u dont have to worry about one person commenting on ur torrent.. some of ur torrents have 500 seeds anytime.
your a lot bigger than that.
