Visually BoXiKoN is simply perfect. Nice colors, textures, interface, animations and effects. It also has good sound effects. It does not have background music, it allows iPOD music but mutes the sounds.

ThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a casual and very polished puzzle. I really like this one!

Description:
BoXiKoN is fast becoming a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œmust haveÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ classic action puzzler game! The game is very easy to learn; it will be love at first play! Simply rotate and place shapes into the grid to form solid connecting lines across or down. The solid lines are cleared from the board allowing you to continue placing more shapes! Use your skills of organization and planning to ensure you never run out of space! Sounds too easy? Give it a go!
