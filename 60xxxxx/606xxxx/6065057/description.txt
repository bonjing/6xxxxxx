William Shakespeare (1564 - 1616)

John Playford (1623 - c1686)

Original or early Musical settings of songs and dances from Shakespeare's plays, in a polished reenactment style.  A superb recording of this significant and fun theatre music.  

The Broadside band has also recorded several CDs of often lively dance tunes from this period, all of which are first-rate.  I have uploaded one of them already at:
