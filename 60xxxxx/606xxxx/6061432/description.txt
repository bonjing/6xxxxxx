And here, a little christmas gift from me :)

It is the springtime, the sun is shining, and the love goddess Freyja dances merrily, wearing her wonderful necklace, Brisingamen. Everyone admires her, as well as her necklace, but not everyone leaves it at admiration. Soon Freyja is threatened by a cunning opponent who will use any means to get ahold of her precious treasure.
