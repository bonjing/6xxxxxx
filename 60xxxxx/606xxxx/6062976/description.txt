[W4F PRESENTS]: The.Trouble.With.Sleepwalking.WS.PDTV.XviD-
W4F

[RELEASE DATE]: 2010/12/24

Genre: Documentary

Description:
This confronting and rather chilling documentary delves into the lives 
of three Americans who are plagued by different forms of 
parasomnia, or sleeping disorders, that have left scientists and 
medical experts baffled.

Father-of-three Mark is accused of sexual assault after he was 
caught in the bedroom of his 19-year-old neighbour during a 
sleepwalking episode. Young New York artist Lauren suffers from 
horrifying night terrors and struggles to cope with everyday life.

John has been plagued by restlessness and sleep-deprivation which 
has strained his relationship with wife Cindy, whom he hasn't shared 
a bed with for five years.
As medical experts set out to determine the underlying cause of this 
perplexing disorder, the terrifying reality intensifies as we observe 
first-hand those who are completely consumed by it.
