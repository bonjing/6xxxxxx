The total of Janis Joplin's recorded output released in her lifetime wasn't that much bigger than what would fit on three CDs. That said, this triple disc set handily captures all that made her remarkable then and memorable now. Spanning only five years as a recording artist, she threw herself completely into everything from raunchy psychedelic blues (Big Brother & The Holding Company) to more sparkling uptown productions (Kozmic Blues Band, Full Tilt Boogie Band). Tellingly, she sounds like the true link between these bands primarily in live performance recordings.

In the studio and in the hands of a producer she sounded fabulous, but her certain edge was occasionally masked or dulled. Dying at the age of 27, she never had the chance to sort through her fascination and facility with this wide range of the blues and see where it would lead her next. JANIS is a riveting look into the life of a naturally powerful singer and performer. Lovingly assembled, the accompanying book includes thoughtful essays, photos, and a discography--reading and listening makes her seem even more powerful.

Entertainment Weekly - 12/24/93, p.60
"...Joplin stands up as one of our most powerful singers, whether crooning gently or rocking passionately, and always with the insistent rhythm of the greatest jazz artists. And that's despite rarely finding songs as good as she was..." - Rating: A+

Melody Maker - 2/19/94, p.34
"...JANIS celebrates her memory, adds to her legend and makes me wish, all over again, that she was still here today...."
