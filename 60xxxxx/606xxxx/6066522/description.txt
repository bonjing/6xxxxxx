2008 - Diagonal

This is vintage-prog in a very astounding manner. If you do not know what it exactly is, you would swear hearing a lost gem out of the deep past (late 60s/early 70s). Do not care about the singings - sounding like Ringo Starr trying to join a progressive rock band - just enjoy the music. Every style shown on the album is known already...but everything's appearing so self-evident and original as if the band members are escaped from a time-voyage right into our millenium.
It's no difficult album and will not only please some prog-weirdos. On the other hand it is interesting enough to deserve a few (if not many) listenings.
