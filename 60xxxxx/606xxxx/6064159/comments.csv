,deadbuf1,2010-12-30T23:12Z,"Thanks for all the resources, however your instructions say to burn an iso, yet there is no iso in the torrent. Where's the iso?"
[T],Computer-User,2010-12-31T18:01Z,"""deadbuf1""

The .ISO File Is Inside The Folder Named "".ISO File"" :)

Are You Using A MAC?"
,deadbuf1,2010-12-31T20:03Z,"""Computer User"" 
yea, for downloading the material, trying to revive my Windows machine. Thanks for the help"
[T],Computer-User,2011-01-01T14:33Z,"If Anyone Can't Find The .ISO File, Then You Will Haft Too Go Into Your Control Panel And Enable ""Hidden"" Files. Then Your Problem Will Be Fixed. :)"
,Thyssyk,2011-01-20T02:23Z,Im using a netbook that came with windows 7 starter. I didn't see anything to suggest you put a mounter with the download. is one included in the tools you included?
[T],Computer-User,2011-01-22T16:18Z,"""Thyssyk""

No A Mounter Is Bout The Only Thing That Isn't Included. You Can Use Deamon Tools Tho :)"
,Thyssyk,2011-01-23T11:25Z,"Alright sounds good. Now I probably missed the part about product key. When it pops up saying I have ""X"" days to register the product, i can just ignore that right?"
,tsalogi,2011-01-26T05:29Z,It says under min. requirement 1 gig ram. I have .99gb of ram. Will this be close enough?
,gaaabicosta,2011-02-06T20:12Z,"in a netbook, for example, i need to use a software to burn the image and do what you said in the description and in the torrent info?"
,gaaabicosta,2011-02-07T04:29Z,just found 2 virus in your stuff ! thank god i have avg with me 
,theebigbob,2011-02-13T13:51Z,"Damn AVG doesn't like your patch/s, 


""Trojan horse Generic3_c.AJJD"" 

:( "
,Thyssyk,2011-02-19T19:58Z,"The ""Virus"" your detecting is a required file. AVG usually isn't involved with an OS install so the program defaults on the file saying ""Hey this is a problem""

Ignore the warning and move forward."
,Balthazar7,2011-02-26T05:52Z,"CU,
Don't know what the issue was but I can tell you TPB admin have at times been over sensitive.
Please come back! Simply register under a different name. We all miss you!"
,CrispyMarie,2011-03-24T22:44Z,Can I use this torrent to put Windows 7 on my Mac using Bootcamp?
,anandpirate,2011-09-01T05:06Z,"Hi,

,Lobyone,2012-04-18T16:20Z,"holy smokes this is perfect! thanks!
not only does it have all the files, but comes with iso burners and step by step instructions with pictures. this is awesome. ive never seen something so perfect."
,Dillin,2012-05-07T22:47Z,"hey Computer-user the product key you provided for ""Driver Genius Professional Edition 10"" in this torrent doesn't work anymore. After I scanned my PC it finds drivers that are needed, and it says ""Fix it"" I click then it asked to register, i do i put in provided key, and then it just does it all over again.  the program keeps asking for the key. But the windows 7 basic works great!"
