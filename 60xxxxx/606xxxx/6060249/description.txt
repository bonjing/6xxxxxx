DESCRIPTION:
Prairie Locator Mobile is the Official version of the Web Application found at prairielocator.com

With Prairie Locator you can convert any Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba Legal Land Description to a GPS Coordinate. Once you have that GPS Coordinate, you are free to use it for your own personal use. We have included the ability to plot the location and show it on a map.

If you are on a GPS Enabled iOS Device, you can even plot where you currently are located and get driving directions.
What's new in Version 1.20
Introducing Universal iPad Support! The whole application has been upscaled for viewing natively on your iPad.

Even more locations! We've added a total of 63,548 new locations to our database which you can now spin through and convert!
