2009 CD Megafone 112


Umbrellowhead is a collection of songs from individual members of the 

mighty musical juggeranault, Bellowhead. Remarkably, when this multi-award 

winning collective are not busy touring the world, recording as Bellowhead or 

appearing in a myriad of musical projects as Band in Residence at Londonâ€™s 

Southbank Centre, the 11 band members also find time to explore a range of 

individual projects. From marimba to fiddle, from the Balkans to Bangladesh 

and onwards to Japan, some of the staggering range of influences of this 

accomplished and original group are revealed in this latest album.
