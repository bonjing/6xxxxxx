And here it is, the much anticipated Beastiary 2. And because I know all you little kiddies just want to leech the sucker instead of commenting. I wont start seeding until I get comments from at least 3 different people. 

I really dont think this is an unreasonable request, even now there are around 50 or so people, leeching and seeding from my other two torrents and I've gotten between them only 10 comments.
