,Paladin87,2010-12-28T23:34Z,I keep getting no file input specified. Does this torrent work? if not please fix. Been waiting for this book for a loooong time! good on you ThePathfinder!
[M],Gargravar,2010-12-28T23:39Z,"when you get ""No input file specified. "" it's usually due to a too large torrent image messing up the upload of the torrent, use the magnet link instead."
