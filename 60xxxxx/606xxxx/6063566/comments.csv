Thanks a lot for all those Criticism of the Bible Collections. Are there any collection 5 and 6 on this topic? [ I can't find them! ] .... Is there something about Wellausen and Martin Noth? What about the Documentary Hypothesis?
Waiting for your immdiate answer. Thanks!"

Why don't you post the things you want. Just like Moman is doing."

All religions are a fucking joke you moron, Christianity is the scourge of the west, Islam in Africa/Mideast, Hindu in India, so on and so forth.

Just a way to control people by using their ignorance, built in superstition and willingness to be fucking sheep."
