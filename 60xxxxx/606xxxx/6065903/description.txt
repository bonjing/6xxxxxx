"1982-1992" is maybe the best EUROPE compilation made (and there are MANY!)
Picking out some of the best tracks from the five studio albums, as well as some unreleased tracks and different versions of a couple of tracks, this really is a testimony to the fact that EUROPE was a band with talented musicians and more than just "The Final Countdown".

As well as the great hits like "The Final Countdown" and "Carrie", you'll find both good, heavy tracks like "Seven Doors Hotel", "Stormwind" and "Yesterday's News", and beautiful ballads like "Open Your Heart", "Dreamer" and "Sweet Love Child".

Every track has meaningful lyrics and great melodies, which is more than can be said about most of today's popular music.

Joey Tempest has a great voice and is also a good keyboard player, as we can hear on the tracks from the two first EUROPE albums. Both John Norum and his replacement in 1986, Kee Marcello are excellent guitarists. Mic Michaeli does well with his keyboard work, and Tony Reno and Ian Haugland are some of the world's best drummers. John LevÃ©n is a skilful bassist.

As you've maybe noticed, SONY Music has released an "updated" version of this album, and it's been given the original name "1982-2000"... The only new things you'll find on it, are new front and back covers (the booklet inside is just like "1982-1992"), and yes, "The Final Countdown 2000", a dance remix of the classic song. A new cover and a disappointing remix isn't really worth the extra money, so unless you're a die-hard EUROPE collector, take my advice: Buy this one instead.
