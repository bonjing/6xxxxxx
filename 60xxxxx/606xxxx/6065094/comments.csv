,LilMoony,2011-01-11T04:32Z,"I downloaded this, but I can't view the videos =/  What program do I use? None of the ones I tried could read the mkv files. 
Or, is there any way for me to convert the videos into readable files?"
,XPditif,2011-01-12T12:33Z,"I use vlc 1.0.1, there's a mkv codec inside. 
A lot of people use mpc (media player classic). 
If there isn't a mkv codec in the latest mpc, there's something called ""mpc satsuki pack"", where a guy already added everything necessary to mkv reading. 
Also, it's okay to convert audio, but except from demuxed .ogg and such, it's pointless to convert video most of the time (like mkv to avi: useless). "
,XPditif,2011-01-12T12:35Z,"I use vlc 1.0.1, but any recent vlc should do the trick. "
,XPditif,2011-01-15T00:03Z,"Hey look, I'm not a bad guy, but it's the second time you ask for screens, 
so either you know what you are downloading, or you don't, but stop pissing me off:
it's written down: GAINAX production, who is gainax? 
This isn't porn dude, it's pure uncut neo dead leaves. Why don't you do a search for a change?"
