Hey.


First season is now over. 
So now it's available. 


Great rips from the horrible bunch. 
Hands down!


13 eps, 480p, mkv, Japanese spoken, English subs. 
A Gainax production with the Dead Leaves vibe (for those that don't know). 


Thank you for seeding as long as you can. 


Ni dieu, ni maÃ®tre, ni croquettes.
