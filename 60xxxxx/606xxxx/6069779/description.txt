  PLOT : :: ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 This film contains four distinct, separate stories. "Black Hair": A poor
 samurai who divorces his true love to marry for money, but finds the
 marriage disastrous and returns to his old wife, only to discover something
 eerie about her. "The Woman in the Snow": Stranded in a snowstorm, a
 woodcutter meets an icy spirit in the form of a woman spares his life on
 the condition that he never tell anyone about her. A decade later he forgets
 his promise. "Hoichi the Earless": Hoichi is a blind musician, living in a
 monastery who sings so well that a ghostly imperial court commands him to
 perform the epic ballad of their death battle for them. But the ghosts are
 draining away his life, and the monks set out to protect him by writing a
 holy mantra over his body to make him invisible to the ghosts. But they've
 forgotten something. "In a Cup of Tea": a writer tells the story of a man
 who keep seeing a mysterious face reflected in his cup of tea.
