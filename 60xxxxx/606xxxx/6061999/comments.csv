,federal21,2010-12-24T05:09Z,"VISIONSÂ® OF FRANCE: The Riviera showcases the sun-splashed Mediterranean wonderland known as the CÃ´te dâ€™Azur. A helicopter-mounted camera offers unprecedented access to this playground of the rich and famous, from the sparkling cobalt waters of fashionable beach resorts to rugged Alpine retreats.

Following along scenic â€“ and precarious â€“ roads, or corniches, that curve sharply along the coast, VISIONSÂ® OF FRANCE: The Riviera pairs dramatic aerial views of Monaco, Cannes, Nice, St. Tropez and more with informative narration, set to regional music.
