Joe Purdy - This American (2010)






Joe Purdy is an American folk singer-songwriter who has recorded and released ten albums in eight years.







Folk singer and songwriter, Joe Purdy, is an amazing musician; all of his songs have a heartfelt and personal attachment. You can literally feel your heart soar or be ripped to shreds while listening to the reverence in his voice; his music is extraordinarily powerful. His music is derivative of what we, as people, feel and think about experiences, circumstances, growing up, and life in general.
Joe has released twelve albums, and is an independent musician. Collectively, his albums have sold over 800,000 single downloads (ref. Wikipedia). His music has been featured on the ABC hit television shows, Lost, Grey's Anatomy, and Fox's House M.D. as well as the feature film,The Secret Life of Bees.

Purdy is delighting his fans with a musical treat this holiday season; his new album, This American, a collection of 15 poetic and melancholy songs, is available for FREE DOWNLOAD. My personal favorites are 'Louisiana,' and 'If I Had You.' The entire album is a gorgeous melody of musical elements, although these two stand out as the most stunningly beautiful, thoughtful, and emotionally stirring songs.
