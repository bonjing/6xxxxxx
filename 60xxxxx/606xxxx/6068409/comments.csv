'What has Islamic countries have so far contributed to the world.'..you could level that accusation at most religions..not just at muslims...catholics, jews, sikhs, buddists...

This rant by 'anon' is just thinly-disguised fascist fear-mongering....pathetic..."
,wielkidupek,2010-12-28T10:25Z,"@Feril You write : "".you could level that accusation at most religions..not just at muslims...catholics, jews, sikhs, buddists...""
 - No! You couldn't.
Look at academic school development; they started in Italy(catholic land!) some 600 years ago . After that we have development in the whole Europe (catholic and protestant countries): development in sciences, in social structures,industry and arts music literatue and film radio and TV... In the 20th century USA(mainly catholic country) became the ""progress engine"".We are not allowed to forget about two countries which contributed strongly in many areas:Japan (buddists...) and Russia(catholic)
Conclusion:You do not know what are You talking about!"
,ayman1234,2010-12-28T18:23Z,"For smoothdong and wielkidupek
you seem that you do not know any thin about Islam and it' s civilization and history
i suggest you read before you write and hurt many people in the world with you unfair words
and you should not forget that GOD will judge whatever your hands wrote in the judgment day"
,wielkidupek,2010-12-29T15:15Z,"@ayman1234 - Read my comment carefuly and You will see that I have NOT written any word about Islam. The only thing I did was showing an unfair error in the sentece i quoted.
Your fanatism makes You blind..."
,ayman1234,2010-12-29T23:38Z," to smoothdong and wielkidupek
God, Allah, Mohamed or any thing you believe in will judge what you write with your hands
my point was not to mention who will judge but to clear the point that there is a judgment and you will be questioned about what you have been written all religions says that so everyone should be careful of what he says!!
i am a Muslim myself and i live in a Muslim country and I'm really laughing from many people in the world now who persist (without a proof) to make Islam in a bad picture.
some Muslims are really bad but the majority are good and kind people
like any other nation or religion there is good and bad people
and i want you to read history will 
:Islam is not the religion that start the two world wars and caused millions of people to die, Islam did not invade the US and Kill more than million peoples but the Cristian US did in Iraq and Afghanistan, Britain put the Israel people in palestine and since then the whole region is in war
Mohamed told us at war not to kill women, children, and old people and not to kill animals or trees
we have months in the year that we should not make wares in them
so I suggest as I said before do not judge a religion or a person like Mohamed and you did not read on it or him and you do not know about Islam nor you live in an Islamic country to judge it
here in my country there is many Cristian peoples and i have many Cristian friends and we live with each other and respect and love each other ( with the knowledge that we are in Islamic country)
if Islam call for war and killings as the article says! we should have been killing them centuries ago
and no one at this time could accuse us because we where a great country like US now
and to wielkidupek
I did not say that you talk about Islam but i want you to search carefully in history and you will impressed of what the Islamic civilization give to the whole world but in your words you did not mention that like if it was not there!!"
,Pastafarian101,2011-02-07T17:14Z,"Islam now is what Christianity used to be a few hundred years ago. Christians used to persecute religious minorities, execute apostates, killing blasphemours/atheists/adulterers, etc. What has Islam contributed? Nothing. But if you're talking about achievements by Muslims on the other hand, you can say many, as much as Christians. Muslims had a golden age, where doubters were not killed, there was much progress in science, maths and philosophy. So what happened? Islamic fanatics rose to power and destroyed the very golden age that would have allowed us to explore space a few hundred years earlier.
Islam: Worship god or die! My god is real, yours is fake, we have the truth!
Christianity: Worship god or die! My god is real, yours is fake, we have the truth!
Same sh*t...Different a**holes.


""Mohamed told us at war not to kill women, children""
So that he could use them for sex slaves and servants, Moses did that too- birds of a feather!"
,thunderbum,2011-02-09T07:03Z,"The only bullshit I see is how islam is behind every war on the planet. For ayman1234: I have studied the koran/hadiths and background materials ever since 9/11. It is all about hatred - to those who aren't muslims. Everyone else is fit for death.

Hurtful words? Bullshit. You may pretend you are 'offended' by 'hurtful' words but I don't believe you. Oh. And way the way it was GOD who gave the land to Israel. It is the land of the Israelites and has been so for almost 4000 years. 

The Palestinians are so violent and crazy they have been expelled in every country in the Middle East - the most recent being Jordan. They are truthfully known as Philistines because the word 'palestine' is a modern Roman invention.You should ask yourself why they aren't taken in by other arab countries? Answer: because they are violent, unruly and crazy. Islam has never given the world anything except bloodshed and it is a lie that under islam Christians and Jews lived in peace. They were Dhimmis and that is not the same thing as a free people.

Remember - your koran teaches it is acceptable to lie if it benefits islam. All of it is taqqiya."
,thunderbum,2011-02-09T07:05Z,"and forgot to mention: Only God will judge me, certainly not your allah, and not mohammed. I do not recognise their authority nor fear them because they do not exist.

BTW: Did you know that after Mohammed spoke to the demon in the cave he thought himself possessed?"
