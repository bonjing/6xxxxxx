-format it to fat32
-create a folder in it named: garmin
-copy the .img to the folder
-call the .img file gmapsupp.img
-put the sd card in the slot of your nav system
-start it and the map will load automaticly (if not go to settings, maps, map info and check the map of 2011)
-nav on :D"

Jag har en nuvi 660. 
Köpte ett 8Gb SDHC kort och följde anvisningarna men nuvin visade ingen ny karta när jag kollade i mapinfo.
Tacksam för hjälp."

,Bjurran,2011-04-19T13:18Z,"I can confirm this to be working on a Nüvi 760. I added a 4 GB SDHC (SanDisk Ultra, 15MB/s) and put the file on the card.
I tried with F/W 4.60 and have now updated to F/W 4.90 and it seems to be working.
Are all new speed cameras updated with this map file or will I need to update anything else?"
