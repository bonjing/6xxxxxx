This was ripped by me (Baron Von Watermelon) in secure FLAC format from a promo copy I acquired some years ago.
I also spent a great deal of time scanning the booklet (all 50 pages of it), both CDs, front and rear inlays, and the rather battered outer box.

I don't leave my computer switched on 24/7 so please try to be patient during the initial seeding.

Here are a few samples of the artwork found within this torrent....

Here's a picture of the cover to the album's only single, "For All Time" featuring Catherine Zeta Jones. Someone uploaded the music video to YouTube, but for some reason Pirate Bay doesn't allow linking there so you'll have to search for it yourself.
