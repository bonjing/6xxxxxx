,braduz,2011-01-21T00:29Z,"You ""sir"", are a cunt"
,lazerxxx1,2011-02-02T06:07Z,"Dude, I don't know what your problem is, but Brads UL's have been the most reliable ones I have downloaded so far. So you sir must have a homophobic issue!!!...........LMAO"
,lazerxxx1,2011-02-02T08:15Z,"Hey Brad, this one didn't do too well. All I get is a .bin and nothing I do with WinMount, Alcohol 52%, or PowerISO workd."
,dsafjaly69,2011-02-08T16:10Z,"Game works fine,  its just not packaged very well.  You need to open Power ISO or equivelant and then go to File/Open and browse to the .bin file. You can then open the bin file and extract the contents to a folder somewhere and install the game,  you have to rename the setup file first as the packager has appended the words ""run this' to the .exe suffix.  

The game itself is quite unique. maybe not my cup of tea, but thanks to the uploader anyway."
,Funkyfredyy,2011-02-13T03:37Z,Um I burn to a disk with ISO it it dnt work and I tried to open it with ISO dont work!!!!! HELP please !!!!
,Elbow8066,2011-03-17T21:09Z,"I opened it with Magic ISO and simply extracted it to a temporary file and ran it from there.

Worked very well.

Don't blame the software if you haven't done your homework on how to operate it!

Thanks braduz."
,ricomon35,2011-06-26T09:12Z,"This Simulator has  start-up problem. For me it's during the loading screen. The Developer credit logos flash by, then a black screen for several minutes. Then support window pops up, stating the game has encountered a problem. I'm running Windows 7 Premium, and I'm sure it's System or Direct X related. 

UIG GmBH (the developer) has a 1.0.0.1 Patch that only works on licensed copies of the Simulator. The updater requires a User Name and Password.

The patch is here - http://www.uieg.de/index.php/downloads.html

If those d-loaders that have successfully installed post what system and Direct X setups they have, it would help us out alot."
,MultiJD1,2011-07-21T22:08Z,"Wow! If you don't know how to work a .bin file you need to learn some tutorials on youtube. Just use PowerISO Worked for me :) thankyou, braduz great torrent :) "
,MultiJD1,2011-07-22T09:01Z,"I would say, great torrent. The best simulator ive downloaded and worked flawless :) Thankyou for the upload! "
