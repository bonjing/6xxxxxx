Nazi Guerillas

In the months and years following the end of the World War Two, Allied forces faced a series of bombings and attacks in occupied Germany. Nazi loyalists attempted to derail the rebuilding process by killing any Germans collaborating with the enemy. And the mysterious SS-Werewolves underground organization boasted of the coming rebirth of the Party.

NAZI GUERILLAS opens a window into the violent struggle for post-war Germany. Hear from a former Werewolf as he describes his motivation and role in the guerilla movement. Travel to Aachen, where Werewolves assassinated the pro-Allied mayor, and Penzberg, the site of the "Night of Murder"--a rampage when which more than a dozen German civilians were killed. And examine the Allied attempt to purge Germany's past through denazification tribunals--an increasingly unpopular set of trials that was hit by a wave of bombings.
