It was obviously a commissioned propoganda piece to influence people about policy about the occupation of Iraq.

The last 5 minutes abruptly shifts from the title topic, and starts talking about Saddam Hussein and our forces in Iraq.

Just be aware as you watch this.  This introduces the idea that it took ten years to ""pacify"" Germany after WWII, which was never taught in school, because we needed to learn how victorious we were and how they accepted us after the fall of the nazis.  

Now, times have changed, so the story changes, too.  Now, we have an historical example of why it would take us a long time in Iraq.

And this was in Dec, 2003!!  Only nine months in, they were preparing us to accept a long term commitment of troops and dollars."
