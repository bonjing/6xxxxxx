United States Army snipers: They're the ultimate hunters in a deadly game where the quarry shoots back. Experts of stealth and stalking, they can kill with a single shot from nearly a mile, or creep within yards of an enemy target remaining virtually invisible.
These are the shooters the army turns to when the chips are down. Starting with the first American sniper during the Revolutionary War and ending with the newest snipers and latest technology at the U.S. Army Sniper School, these soldiers have become true masters of their craft.
