You may have what appears to be a successful disc write, but your satnav will still ask for nav disk unless it is written on certain drives with certain media in a certain way.                                             Your dvd drive must be capable of writing in booktype   DVDROM  not all infact the majority of drives do not support this.                                                                                                                                     Verbatim DVD+R  DL ,  printable discs 8.5 gig dual layer media                                                                      Burn at the slowest speed possible, Booktype DVD-ROM.                                                                                                                     I set it on my  LiteOn  SHM-160P6S,  thru Nero 7, Application Nero Burning Rom.                                  Nero sets it when the burning is started - you see it in the dialog window when it starts burning.
To tell Nero to set it to DVDROM, you select RECORDER from the toolbar and then select CHOOSE RECORDER from the pull down menu. When the window comes up and you select your drive, at the bottom left hand corner of the dialog window you will see OPTIONS>>.Sselect this and it expands the window.                                                                                                                                                                    If your drive can set the booktype, you will see a selection box on the lower left, where you can choose DVDROM as the booktype. Select it and choose OK to close the dialog window. If it is not there your drive does not support setting booktype.                                                                                 Select image file **** .ISO Then all you need to do is burn your ISO image (or files in fact) to the DVD. During the burn Nero sets the booktype.                                                                                            You can subsequently use DVDINFOPRO to check the media and see that the booktype has been set correctly. (DVDDECRPTER can also do it, but I had problems with it)                                                    Some drives reported as working:-

Is there anyone outthere that had tried Plextor PX-L890SA from the list with success?

Anyone that managed to do this with success and live in Norway?

,Furio65,2012-03-29T22:17Z,"To those who find the unit performing an update of the firmware but thereafter not recognizing the navi DVD; something went wrong with burning your disk with booktype ""DVD-ROM"". This is very crytical. Not all DVD burners burn a perfect copy! Google's you're friend! Search for ""DVD-burner"" ""RNS-E"" and ""booktype DVD-ROM"" and start reading..."
