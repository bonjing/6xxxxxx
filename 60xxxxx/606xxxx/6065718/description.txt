Notes: Joel Paterson originally hails from Madison, Wisconsin. He moved to Chicago in 1998 and is now one of the busiest guitar players in town. This roots guitarist/vocalist plays jazz, blues, country, and swing music with his own group as well as such other Chi-town artists as the Four Charms, Nick Willet, and the Barclay 3. Paterson is considered one of the finest and most versatile guitarists in Chicago. He released his debut acoustic country blues album, 'Down at the Depot', on Ventrella Records in 2001. Joel is a wonderful utility player who has been captivated and playing acoustic country blues since he was 15 years old. This CD showcases Joel's fluid fingerpicking and slide playing via old chestnuts and originals. This album was recorded live with no overdubs in Madison, Wisconsin, which showcases Joel's passion for delta blues, ragtime, old time guitar and early American roots music.
