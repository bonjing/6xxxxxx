,TorrentG0110,2010-12-24T17:08Z,Thanks a lot for this! It's people that share like you that's the reason why I put my rips up here as well! Thanks again! Good job keeping 5.1 - I would have downloaded Alice In Chains but I have the real DVD. :)
,TorrentG0110,2010-12-24T17:30Z,"You lame fuckers lol - don't make the seeder send every packet to everyone. Up your upload bandwidth Jesus.

I got 250 KByte/sec going here and nobody sending me, with green check for network. Losers! lol"

,tenkre1,2011-08-13T20:53Z,hey man can you do one in MKV format please
,bhobson333,2011-09-17T16:24Z,"I avoid MKV because it is not as widely supported as AVI and I have found the MKV tools to be inferior to AVI tools.  It has a few advantages over AVI, but not enough to make me switch.  If you must have MKV, try renaming the file to .MKV  That will often work, as the internal codecs are very similar."
