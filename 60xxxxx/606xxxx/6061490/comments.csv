This is only the second one I've downloaded(in the process) and the first one was really good quality, how is it done? Or is it a 'trade secret' still?  :)  I'm looking to convert(shrink) files I already, any tips? Thank you, regardless of tips or not, it's appreciated! Happy Holidays!"

,tant_d_walf_mama,2010-12-28T04:08Z,"Thanks YIFY! I am finding more quality small downloads like this one and some instructions on how to do it. I do not have a regular connection, but when I am connected I want to be able to seed amap and smaller files will help with this.

I just watched this last night and it was great!

A/V a 10 as far as I'm concerned. The movie was even better than I had thought it might be.  :)"
