Try to remember: ""As you think, so shall you be."", and at least read [url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/caitlin_moran/article5483397.ece]this article[/url] before you watch something you won't soon forget.

I can sit through most anything, but I'll pass on this one. I've seen enough of what goes on in this world, thank you very much ;)"
