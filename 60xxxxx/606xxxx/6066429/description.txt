PLOT:

A motley group of business students in Berlin, Germany
sign up for Takahashi Corp.'s assessment weekend, hoping
to land one of the coveted spots with the consulting
company. Under the watchful eye of a company
psychologist, the team-working and improvisational skills
of the aspirants will be put to the test in a
survival-type situation. But nothing goes according to
plan - the group arrives to find the base camp completely
destroyed. Trapped in the woods with no food, no shelter
and no way to communicate with the outside world, the
real characters of the students come to light, as one by
one, they start to lose their heads
