[T],bobnjeff,2010-12-26T06:06Z,if one of you guy's or gal would be so kind as to help me out with  trueHD to a DTS conversion or point me to the right spot i would be more than happy to put them in  a dts track but tryin to get info out of people is like pullin teeth.

It's very nice quality.

The only problem is that I'm not quite understanding how to use and work with the subs.  I use MKV to VOB and need to split the files because of FAT32 hard drive and PS3.  I didn't even see an option for subs on GOM Player.

Any ideas?"
