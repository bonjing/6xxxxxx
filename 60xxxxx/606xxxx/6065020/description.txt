Wallace & Gromit is an arcade platform adventure where the player has to 
liberate the zoo from the evil clutches of the maniacal Feathers. 

The diabolical penguin has incarcerated all the baby animals in order to 
persuade their parents to do his bidding and manufacture gems from the coal 
being mined using the incredible diamond-o-matic. Wallace & Gromit have 
smelled the fishy presence of Feathers and developed an elaborate plan to 
infiltrate his domain.
