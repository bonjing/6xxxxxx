This compilation covers the First album all the way to the first compilation (Capital Punishment: The Megadeth Years Dread and Fugitive Mind also made it to the ninth (The World Needs a Hero) album) This compilation is heavy on the first five capitol records (Peace Sells to Youthanasia) albums plus hidden treasures on top of 2 tracks from the first (Killing Is My Business), Seventh (Cryptic Writings), and Eighth (Risk) albums including some b-sides(demos, live tracks, and rarities). A majority of the tracks are the remixed versions from 2004. For some reason the original mix of Rattlehead was used instead of the 2002 remix (The 2002 Remix of Mechanix was used though). I recommend this album for first time megadeth buyers that don't want to buy all the albums and doesn't want to buy the more expensive Warchest that is mostly full of rarities,demos and live tracks than the hits and fan favorites. 

P.S. Every track that was on the second compilation (Back To The Start: Greatest Hits) is on here except the studio version of Symphony of Destruction.
