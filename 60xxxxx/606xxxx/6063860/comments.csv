Because you obviously don't understand much about world affairs and politics.

Cuba would find Assange an even greater threat than the people in our democracy who like to do things behind closed doors find him."
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-25T07:27Z,"I don't necessarily agree with him or support him, but I am glad that there is an opposing force that pulls against the mentality of absolute secrecy.

In fact, the people who are most upset about these ""leaks"" are the ones who would prefer to be able to operate without any oversight, in absolute secrecy.

Things done in the dark tend to be really dirty.  Sunlight is the best antiseptic.  

There should always be a reckoning for your actions.  If things remain secret for eternity, there is nothing to motivate people to try and stay on the proper and right course.

I would actually suggest that anyone who believes Cuba would support Assange would probably actually feel much more comfortable living under that absolutist regime.  They execute anyone who divulges secrets or speaks out against the government.  

But they don't tell you that on Fox News, they only tell you what their Australian Globalist owner wants you to hear at any particular moment."
,goupe,2010-12-28T03:51Z,Assange and the brave people who send WikiLeaks classified US Gov't docs that expose war crimes are the real heroes of this story.
