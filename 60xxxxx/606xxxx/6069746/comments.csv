,LJE111,2012-04-28T21:54Z,"Video breaks up throughout the movie - other than that the audio is good and so is the video but not worth 8GB. Have seen just as good in a smaller file size. Looks pretty close to 720 to me. I wouldn't keep it even if it didn't break up because of size.

With that said - I always appreciate it when someone takes the time to upload movies and such, so thank you anyway insinuendo! :)"
