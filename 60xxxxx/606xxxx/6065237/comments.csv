,maustin,2012-01-26T21:48Z,"Oh -- my apologies to the uploader. I misread, this is ""Volume"" 8, not ""Season"" 8. So, with that in mind the torrent is actually quite good. :) 

Just be aware that Volume 8 contains about half each of season 7 and 8, so if you want the complete season 8 then make sure you look for the word ""SEASON"" in the title of the torrent. 

Again, my bad, thanks uploader. ;)"
