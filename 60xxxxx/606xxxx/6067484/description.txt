Synopsis
Georges Moreau, a truck driver, is involved in a serious accident. Traumatised by his experiences, he knows that he must avoid strong emotions and any kind of stress.  Recently married to Olivia, he hopes to start a new life by opening a restaurant on the National 7 highway, although he is none too pleased when the truckers start flirting with his all-too-pretty wife.  Opposite the restaurant there is a petrol station owned by a man named Pieri, whom Georges begins to suspect of having an affair with his wife.  Doubtful of his wifeâ€™s fidelity, Georges realises that he is heading for a nervous breakdown.  A dramatic outcome is not far away...
