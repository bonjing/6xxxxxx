Should I cancel and dl this instead?

I have followed the steps from your other movies (like Shrek3d). IF I convert to m2ts I can stream it to the ps3 but no sound. If I replace the audio file first with mkv merge I get an invalid file when trying to convert to m2ts. Also, how does one copy a m2ts file onto the PS3?

Thanks with any help."

Use power dvd 10 mark 2,then go to 3d settings(small arrow next to 3d) and select 3d viewing device nvidia 3d ready pc/monitor.

I don't know if you will get this message but if anyone else wants to know why this rip is not in avi format and questions why it is in mkv format. 
MKV format is considered the best ripping format, same as mp4, but all others avi, mpg, etc are known to lose quality during the ripping process. MKV basically rips the video without tampering with the quality. Ripping movies into AVI; especially ripping 3D movies, the mkv format would be the best. 
You could download a program to change the format from mkv to avi so you can watch it on your TV, but soon you will discover you loose a lot of the quality of the video during the transfer."

The media player in the TV must be better at rendering the video than whatever you're playing with.
I play via USB on my Samsung 40"" 7 series and it works perfectly.

,cooljonni,2011-03-27T11:24Z,Got it working guys and wow what a film its amazing. it wasent working before as i was connecting my lap to to the tv throught hdmi but the tv was not merging pictures properly because it had the source of file from the lap top resolution or the graphics card on the lap top. any way i dident have a usb flash drive bigger then 17 gig and the ps3 wasent recognising the huge file over the wifi. so solution was downloaded a program called ps3 media server and poped the avatar file in there then my ps3 over the wifi found the file and i just copied it to the ps3 hard drive and then clicked on the control the 3d button and sellected the side by side pictures and voula poped my glasses on and i was smilling big time. hope this helps any one cause when i had these problems i know it can be very fustration so i hope it help ill keep seeding enjoy guys/girls p.s refering to the last comment id this sony tv is 3d compatible oviously needed to play the file then if you have a ps3 the i suggest my method if not ps3 is present then not sure why it woulnt work and also every 3d tv should have options some were in the menu look for it if you cant find it then tv mabe doesent support the file type just guessing here good luck

,raymw,2011-04-04T12:04Z,"Just started downloading this as already downloaded a 13.7 GB version which turned out as that horrid Red/Green glases version which I would not wast my time watching.  THis looks like it is proper 3D for shutter glasses (SIde by SIde I believe this is)


Anyhow the big news I saw from browsing on this subject is that in many cases if you change the file extension from .MKV to .AVI then this will play on most systems.  Sounds unlikely but try it, surprised me too.  

My Samsung 46C7000 (and Samsung Blu Ray player) plays MKV files fine from a USB memory stick but not over the LAN using DLNA from my NAS drive, but simply changed the file extension to .AVI then all is fine and they all play perfectly.  18GB is not possible to put on a USB stick of course so you need to do this until  the superior MKV files are more accepted by various systems."

Use Nvidia 3D Vision player, and download K-Lite codec pack. (Google it)

Install the codec pack and then open the avatar movie file in the Nvidia 3D Vision player. (You have to select ""all formats"" to see the .mkv file)

Select: Side by Side left halfpicture left, and switch to fullscreen.

Enjoy the movie in 3D!"

,itisnoita,2011-05-20T05:03Z,"Sorry guys, my question has most likely been answered in some way already, but since I'm a chick, and I pretend to be a tech freak and know it all, I still want to get a second opinion and make sure I understand this correctly... So I have a 3D TV, obviously, it's a Philips 40PFL8605H. So is it really true, that I can download a 3D film, say Avatar (that the a'holes have binded to Panasonic for like forever and it costs like a million even as a pirate copy on ebay..) And watch the 3D films ON my 3D TV through my PC, only using nvidia player?! If this is real I will FREAK OUT cause then I spent like 600USD on a piece of shit useless blu ray 3D player! Gaaah!!! So is this so? I can play this movie on kvidia and watch it in a real 3D mode on my tv with the stupid glasses on etc? I do have a PS3 also in case it wouldn't work through my PC (which has no 3D anything on it) Although I've only been playing games on the PS3 so far, and I'm not so familiar with the other functions on it... But yeah, what I'm trying to ask is; What is the easiest, best way to watch 3D films, I have a Fujitsu PC with i5 Core processor and a Philips 3D TV like I mentioned...and a PS3 in case my piece of crap PC is useless...I downloaded that nvidia 3D player now also, do I need anything else? I have a codec for matroska from before... I just can't believe it if it's really this easy! And then I will shove that Philips 3D player up some Philips corporate VD's ASS for fooling me to think it was essential! Grrr!!! Yeah, well, enough ranting...Insomniac mode, I'm hyper. Please reply if anyone can make any sense of this. Cheers! (gÃ¥r bra pÃ¥ svenska tai suomeksi kans! ;)"

FYI for the people wondering/having trouble playing the files.....

1) ONLY YOUR TV HAS TO BE 3D
2) Your TV must have Side by Side mode (for SBS rips)
3) The files will play off any external HDD that your TV can recognize.
4) The files will work through a Media Player (ie.WDTV Live...awesome cheap player BTW)
5) Haven't tried the 5.1 yet cause I'm a lazy mofo....but will update when I have.

Peas yo."
