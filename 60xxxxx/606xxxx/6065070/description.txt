The Smiths - Unreleased Demos and Instrumentals (2010)



***Vinyl Rip***



***Bootleg***









The Smiths were an English rock band, formed in Manchester in 1982. Based on the songwriting partnership of Morrissey (vocals) and Johnny Marr (guitar), the band also included Andy Rourke (bass) and Mike Joyce (drums). Critics have called them the most important alternative rock band to emerge from the British independent music scene of the 1980s. The group were signed to the independent record label Rough Trade Records, for whom they released four studio albums and several compilations, as well as numerous non-LP singles. Although they had limited commercial success outside the UK while they were still together, and never released a single that charted higher than number 10 in their home country, The Smiths won a growing following, and remain cult and commercial favourites. The band broke up in 1987 amid disagreements between Morrissey and Marr and have turned down several offers to reunite since then.

Everyone knows that The Smiths made depressing music. Their songs were crafted to enjoy in your bedroom alone, when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re feeling forlorn and poetic. But what you may not know is that the band also dabbled in some reggae music. Yes, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, reggae. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe us? Take a listen below to the shelved reggae version of one of their most well-known cuts, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Girlfriend in a ComaÃ¢â‚¬Â. Can you imagine Morrissey with dreadlocks?

According to SlicingUpEyeballs.com, the track is a part of a bootleg vinyl LP entitled Unreleased Demos & Instrumentals that was ripped and uploaded online by fans. Other notable goodies include two Johnny Marr instrumentals and an alternate version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sheila Take A BowÃ¢â‚¬Â. According to fans, the tracks came from a proposed 2001 Very Best of The Smiths two-CD set and a Queen Is Dead outtake compilation. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for more details regarding the history of each outtake, you can head over to Extra Track for a track-by-track breakdown.
