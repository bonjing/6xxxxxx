Vybz Kartel
Most Wanted (2009)

Adidja Palmer is Dancehallâ€™s one-man cartelâ€”a razor-sharp lyricist with the type of style, delivery, and dexterity that made him an instant success; a keen business man that has launched several successful brands; and the leader of one of the Dancehall industryâ€™s most powerful troupe of formidable talent. Over the past nine years, Palmer has made an indelible mark on Jamaicaâ€™s wildly popular urban music landscape as the indomitable Vybz Kartel.
