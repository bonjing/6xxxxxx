,lordkaosny,2010-12-30T20:06Z,"@T3RM1T
Quoted from the NFO...  ""Difference between this and v1 ......well better res, better rip due to using source files, higher bitrate, no watermarks ""team Serenity"" and also tweaked differently compared to v1. Audio is our own again and needed to be resynced due to using the untouched source files."""

Screw you ... A select few Americans wrote and produced the movie .... Let me ask ... how many great pieces of cinematography are coming out of your country? Oh ... NONE !!  That's what I thought ass wipe !! STFU .... If it weren't for Americans, you'd be stuck watching boring BBC documentaries. Yeah, you're right, I'll agree, the movie wasn't great .... Make sure you thank the Americans when you find a flick you like,..... cause, no doubt, it would have been produced in the land of the free MoFo !!"

,peestandingup,2011-01-02T04:34Z,"I'll just leave this here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

So yeah, guys. I'm pretty sure USA directors, writers & studios are responsible for most of the worlds greatest movies of all time.

Granted we're fuck ups in a lot of ways, but damn it we know movies. Deal with it or get busy making better ones."

,Wheezy,2011-01-02T06:26Z,"@peestandingup

Nice link but it just shows that you FAIL! 
The three highest grossing movies on that list were directed by non-Americans. 
James Cameron is a Canadian and Sir Peter Jackson [yes he is knighted, something an American cannot receive] is from New Zealand.

The other movies on that list are mainly for kid's like Toy Story and Harry Potter hardly any substance in terms of direction and content.
Not to mention that they had to make Harry Potter from a novel written by a British woman, then murder it on screen with shit actors, directors and the ever changing set layout."
,razmataz101,2011-01-02T06:28Z,"@peestandingup

by ""most of the worlds greatest movies of all time."" i hope you're not counting James Cameron (Canadian), Peter Jackson (New Zealand), Christopher Nolan (British, or at most British-American, London Born), Lewis Carrol (for Alice in Wonderland - English), and.. we all know who wrote the Harry Potter franchise. Also, Andrew Adamson (Shrek 1, 2 - New Zealand)... the list goes on.

Don't get me wrong i love american movies (most of all since... american studios make the industry), and I the love the US television shows... bar a couple of UK ones, but please don't say that 'USA directors, writers' are "" responsible for most of the worlds greatest movies of all time.""... give the credit to everyone involved, not just americans... since you'd be leaving out some big non-US names."

Audio.. 3 (total pirate quality, sounds like every line is getting flushed down a large toilet)

looks and smells like a cam on crack, sorry, but I will wait until someone actually has the real deal... (where is axxo????)
