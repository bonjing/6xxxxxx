Pinball game, based on five different themes, including Jungle, Techno and Metal. 
The first set of tables has a lush tropical look, with butterflies floating over 
the game as you frantically bash buttons in an attempt to achieve Flipnic's 
surreal objectives. The challenges include saving pink flamingos from the jaws 
of hungry crocodiles, destroying UFOs, and feeding hungry monkeys by knocking 
bananas into their waiting paws. Flipnic features 50 levels, 60 missions, and 
unlockable multiplayer mini-game modes, such as two-player Pinball Soccer and 
Pinball Basketball.
