Allmusic Review:
First off, A Very Larry Christmas is mostly Larry the Cable Guy's syndicated radio "commentaries" -- the ones where he gives his down-home observations on different topics into a microphone that's way to close to his mouth. There's some other odds, ends, and little ditties, but this is more audio-bookish than a traditional album. That said, it's very, very funny. When Larry tries to be a part of his church's singing Christmas tree, he can't understand why his "Wine 'Em, Dine 'Em, 69 'Em" T-shirt isn't allowed at choir practice ("Where does it say that in the Bible?"). Larry is an absurd, lazy, hedonist from America's heartland who has way too much time to think about things. Don't take as offensive his idea that nonbelievers and folks of different faith should stay out of the Targets and Wal-Marts at Christmas time so the Christians can grab all the deals. Along with his knowingly out-of-date catch phrase "What the hell is this, Russia?" Larry is hoping you laugh at him more than with him by totally missing the real meaning of Christmas and by making plenty of other dimwitted blunders elsewhere. These "commentaries" are much more Larry as a character than he is in his standup routine, a slow character like Charlie Weaver or Jethro from the Beverly Hillbillies. Think Jethro with a South Park mouth and a bit of Blazing Saddles sensibility, and you'll stop worrying that he means everything he says. He's got talent, he's highly entertaining, and most of his jokes work well past the first listen. All these things -- along with some choice fart jokes -- overcome A Very Larry Christmas' slapped-together construction and make it worthwhile.
