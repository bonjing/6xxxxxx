,dumbults,2010-12-25T02:12Z,"Your guide on How To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent) does not work for me.may stil work for others.
I set number of connectios to 500.
I set the download/upload limit to  Unlimited.
The speed i'm getting are. upload about 120kb/s an download speeds of around 100-200kb/s, but when i set my upload speed to 20kb/s my download speed run to over 1030kb/s or 1mb/s"

,JDFan,2010-12-26T04:40Z,@dumbolts -- you don't want to set uploads to unlimited or it will slow downloads down due to the overhead involved with high speed downloads -- you need to leave about 10% of your upload capacity for the connections to send communication to each other for the send\receive signals - but you also do not want to set it too low or you are not sharing a good % and it's not right to hit and run -- so best to set the max upload to about 10% under your available upload bandwidth to keep your downloads fast but still share at good speed also !

some moments where vivid accurate, non-blur motions can literally take your breath away... sadly, because of the (still pretty good, but) lesser video quality, I feel as if some part of this has gone missing... thx anyway tho XD"

,squishyrob,2011-02-25T12:54Z,"@ jgem, buy it then. or upload a perfect quality copy that comes in at 700mb. sorry, whats that? oh, you cant thats right. many thanks to the uploader for this film that i dont have to pay for now thanks to his efforts. and how is it if you go out and eat a meal that was shit you complain and they dont make you pay for it but if you watch a shit film and complain they wont do FA? the film industry brings it on itself. if i watch a great film, ill buy the blu ray. now thats an incentive."

can ask something..how you get that subtitle .idx + .sub??
Are you convert subtitle .srt to idx+.sub??
