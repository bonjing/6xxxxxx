,Metroidn1f,2010-12-30T22:10Z,"Hey guys, you can do this your self if you want and have the time.  Use Roxio 2011, but it will take a long time.  You can use stereoscopic or anaglyph.  Even if the move is not 3D, you can make it 3D in what ever way you want.  But for anaglyph, it only uses Red Cyan, but you can swap it to Cyan Red."

,rexojohn1236,2012-02-01T09:54Z,"i am downloading this. Can i watch it on television- LG Cinema 3D with the glassess provided by LG.
Plz reply guyz. Its urgent & important. Plz.

Can I watch it with the glassess provided by LG."
,rchrdcrg,2012-02-20T07:21Z,"OK, to all the people who seem a bit daft about the 3D in this...
This is for the old style red and blue glasses. It is NOT meant for 3D TVs and stuff like that... it'll still work on those, but you still need red/blue glasses, not passive or active shutter glasses and stuff like that. This is basically the same idea as old 50s monster flicks for us cheapskates who can't afford a real 3D TV... personally, I love it! I was amazed to even find this here."

and for everyone who is wondering: NO!! you can't watch this with shutter or cinema glasses. you NEED red/cyan glasses!! like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Glasses-Pro-Ana-movies-Computers/dp/B0036NP3CS/ref=pd_cp_p_0

they also work with nvidia or AMD(ATI) 3d for games.
