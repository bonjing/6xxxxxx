        Based  on the  first of  seven books  by acclaimed  Australian
        author, John Marsden, Tomorrow When The War Began is the story
        of seven teenagers who return from a week-long camping trip to
        find that Australia has been invaded by a foreign power.

        Banding  together to  fight gurellia-style  agaist the  enemy,
        this is not a  typical heroic war movie  - it is a  terrifying
        situation where  they must  sometimes use  little more  than a
        knife or  a belt  to murder  a soldier  in cold  blood. It's a
        graphic tale  of the  violence, the  blood, the  fear, and the
        insanity of war.

        These kids are  underdogs, they're not  going to win  the war,
        they're more likely to  end up dead in  a ditch than send  the
        enemy  retreating,  but  it's their  land,  their  parents and
        friends in prison  camps. They give  a damn and  they'd rather
        die fighting than give up.
