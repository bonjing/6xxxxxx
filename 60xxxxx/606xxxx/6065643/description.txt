[*] [color=#CC9933][b]Difficulty Modes[/b][/color]
Choose your own difficulty. The more treacherous of a path you choose, the greater the rewards that are waiting for you. Ultimate Mode provides the Ultimate experience, with permanent death always looming over you.

[*] [color=#CC9933][b]Guild System[/b][/color]
Make a guild. Join a guild. Taunt the other guilds. Life is grand when you have friends to share it with. Hang out casually, face off against some fantastic foes, or help that guild make a name for itself in the guild ranking battles. Get a guild house and customize your experience.


[*] [color=#CC9933][b]Auction House[/b][/color]
Located in the Bootleggery, Auction Houses serve as a central hub for item sales. Sellers post items for sale and donâ€™t have to be tied down while doing so. Buyers have a central place to look and donâ€™t need to scour player merchant stalls.

[*] [color=#CC9933][b]Player Mounts[/b][/color]
Famous heroes donâ€™t walk; they ride in style. Choose from numerous mounts including giant basilisks, mysterious unicorns, illustrious stallions, stealthy tigers, and even two-headed dragons. The best mounts offer additional seating.
