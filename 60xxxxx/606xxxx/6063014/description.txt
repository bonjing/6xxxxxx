ATTENTION PLZ: IT'S NOT JAMES ROLFE'S ANGRY VIDEO GAME NERD VIDEOS

~~~~~~~

Finnish Angry Video Game Nerd known on YouTube as 1svaffel and previously known as Isvaffel and S4t4nmaster.
His name is Jaakko (pronounced as Yakko :) Petteri Jarvinen, his favorite color is green, he has beautiful finnish accent and he's not angry at all.
There is a little "cult" following him for his odd-style videos (except reviewing games he has done almost every kind of video).
If you look at this situation from third person view, you'll see that it's all a big parody of James Rolfe (calm reviewing without cursing, though there're exceptions) and his lickspitting fans (in comments all Jaakko's fans praise Jaakko like he is some kind of god, though he is). He pisses off the fans of James Rolfe for two years (I think) using the name AVGN.

Some funny facts about Jaakko:
- He wanted to become youtube partner to fund World Parrot Trust

- Besides of course Finnish he knows German and English and I think Japanese languages
- He hates Sonic, though he likes anime and manga
- He's composer and makes introduction music in his reviewing-videos
- He made a song and wanted famous internet people to sing it in chorus, so he sended e-mail to James Rolfe, president of Estonia, Spoony, Lowtax, moot and others asking them to join:

and he got the answer only from cabinet of Estonian president:

so Jaakko had to sing it alone

Some unneeded info:
I used this torrent (google "Jaakko - Isvaffel - S4t4nmaster - 628 Video Virtual Library") as starting point and downloaded all other his AVGN-videos from his current youtube channel with 480p quality till 24th of December 2010.
Now we've got 868 episodes of his great and original show, plus 24 episodes of his Let's Play "Zelda - Ocarina of Time".
