                    Murder on the Orient Express.            
                    In Istanbul, Hercule Poirot boards the Orient  
                    Express to London alongside an array of  
                    glamorous international passengers. Later, when  
                    a ruthless American businessman asks Poirot to  
                    watch his back, he refuses. The next day,  
                    Poirot awakes to find the train stuck in a  
                    snowdrift and the businessman dead. With the  
                    train cut off from civilisation, Poirot  
                    investigates the murder - and makes a decision  
                    that will change his life forever.
