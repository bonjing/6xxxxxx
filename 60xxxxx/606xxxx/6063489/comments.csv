,keysofanxiety,2010-12-30T20:01Z,"CaribeanPirate- this torrent contains ANOTHER torrent.

...and that torrent is the EWQL VOTA. I did this because TPB was screwing up with the Uploads, I'm not being deliberately awkward. 

If you took the time (about 1 second) to download this torrent (which finishes nearly instantly, may I add), you'll find that the other torrent DOES contain the 925MB Rar file of Voices of The Apocalypse, and it's not a fake. 

Back up your statements before saying them, don't blindly accuse things of being bullshit when other uploaders have gone to a lot of trouble to zip and seed this to the torrenting public."

,edm_ddd,2011-01-29T13:07Z,Thank you mate. Keep uploading these orchestra torrents. They are greatly appreciated!
,turtle123abc,2011-02-03T23:27Z,Anybody wanna help me with installing these sounds so they will be functional in Sibelius using kontakt player? I'm not sure what to do with all of the .nki files.
,sweet_x_lady,2011-02-11T00:51Z,damn it.. cannot install it with 64x
,keysofanxiety,2011-02-11T18:47Z,"To those of you struggling with getting this to work:

1) Download Kontakt Player 
2) Load the .nki files directly from Kontackt
3) Set the MIDI inputs/outputs (I use a MIDI keyboard for the input)

It's that simple. Alternatively, you can use GIGA studio (to follow instructions upon installation for this method, go to: Start-Quantum Leap- vota help)"
,keysofanxiety,2011-02-11T21:24Z,"Sorry, forgot to add- Kontakt Player is also a VST plugin. 

If you load the .nki files FROM Kontakt (click the icon that looks like a floppy disk, then click 'load'), a screen'll pop up. Manually search for the .nki files in your folder. 

To get VOTA working with Sibelius using Kontakt, it's exactly the same method as you'd usually use- that being, configure the MIDI inputs/outputs on both Sibelius and Kontakt to work together. 

This all works perfectly, I hope you're all enjoying it. If you've got any more issues, I'll be happy to try and help you with them :) "
,keysofanxiety,2011-02-11T21:28Z,"@sweet_x_lady-

You may not need the stand-alone program to get this to work. If you import the .nki files into Kontakt player, as I explained above, this should work on a 64bit OS. 

Hope this helps. "
,flyko,2011-03-11T01:30Z,"Ummm... Every time I upload these files to Kontakt, it says they are demos. They work for awhile, but soon they will stop working and Kontakt asks me to activate them. Any idea how to fix this?"
,keysofanxiety,2011-04-05T16:37Z,"@Flyko: 

Please ensure that your Kontakt player is fully registered & fully cracked. Native Instruments are quite weird; a few of my programs such as EZDrummer seem to flow in and out of being registered o_O 

Secondly- are you sure that it's asking for the .nki files to be registered, or the Kontakt player itself? 

There's a big distinction. What's the actual error code/message?

,TheGoldenMoose,2011-06-21T22:46Z,"Great torrent, no problems at all. Cheers:)"
,kiyoshi67,2011-06-23T02:18Z,"Anyone having problems with the consonants in Kontakt 4? All other choir patches work perfectly for me, everything except the consonants. In the women, they play as a barely audible ""chk"" and some of the mens play back as a truncated consonant.  However, the actual .wav samples play back just fine for consonants in both choirs.

FYI, the VOTA text app works fine for me too in Vista x64, assuming you use a midi loopback like the one included or LoopBe1 which works for me. VOTA trys to say the words, but without consonants I may as well use the keyswitch or mod vowel parts.

Also, thanks for the upload keysofanxiety, you really saved my life on a project I'm working on."
,Jambokwadzo,2011-08-18T12:19Z,"Is there a chance to upload Dutch voices like 	 

Acapela: Femke
Nuance Realspeak: Claire 
Nuance Realspeak: Laura

Belgian Dutch voices like
Acapela: Jeroen
Acapela: Sofie
Nuance Realspeak: Ellen

That would be great!"
,pirikogos,2011-09-27T06:28Z,"hey my friend thanx for your upload, 
please tell me how do you install this to work with cubase?"
,Fractalz,2012-04-01T00:15Z,Any way you could maybe get Voices of Passion?
,mcalldp,2012-06-21T01:53Z,Using KontactKt 2 in Cubase and can not even get this to show up in Cubase anywhere. If I go for just the nki file impoirt in Kontakt through cubase says can't use these files. Wasn't sure where to put the library either was getting db error on start up of program in stand-alone moode. I put it in with the program and that fixed that then also put it in my NKI Kontakt folder for import through Kontakt in Cubase...that's where I am stuck- any help? +2 for voice of passion!
