Here's my second upload. Once again, ThePirateBay was playing up, so I've uploaded this torrent. Enclosed in it is another torrent, which is the "Voices of the Apocalypse" torrent. Once again, apologies for the inconvenience with the torrents.  

To the best of my knowledge, it's not a stand alone VST plugin, so you should be familiar with Gigastudio if you're contemplating downloading this. 

Once extracted/installed, go to Start> Quantum Leap> Vota Help if you're struggling with getting this to work.

The actual file is 1.72 GB, zipped into a 925 MB Rar file.

Please note that the first few leechers will have to be patient, as I don't have the fastest broadband, so please bear with me and seed when it's completed. 

Only download this if you know what you're doing. 

Happy composing!
