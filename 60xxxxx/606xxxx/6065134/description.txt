For the most part it was a very promising debut album . 

Like many 1st records it could certainly have comfortably dropped a couple 

of tracks and came closer to being an excellent debut album . Their are 

echoes of marianne faithfull, bjork and maybe even the cranberries in places 

but martha does sucessfully retain a good deal of her own personality in the 

songs. 

The 1st 4 tracks are my favourites , "bloody motherfucking asshole"  sounds a 

little too overwraught and gauche - who the fuck would swear like that anyway 

??! 

The closing "whither must i wander" (a robert louis stevenson text) is pretty 

chamber-folk that closes  the record nicely after a couple of weaker songs, by 

showing another dimension of her talents .
