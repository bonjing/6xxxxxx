,dirkdar,2011-01-27T05:03Z,"Works great! Thank you Win7nerd for an excellent torrent. FYI: If you get an installation error and have been playing the trial version, uninstall the game and remove any references to the game in your Windows registry. Re-install the game and you should be good to go. I had to do this for Win 7. Cheers all!"
,Win7nerd,2011-01-28T07:04Z,best to use an uninstaller for those types of errors cuz you never know what u may delete that may be important
