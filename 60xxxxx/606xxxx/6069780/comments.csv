,dasani,2011-02-05T15:20Z,i got this to work on kmeaw 3.55 and gaia manager 2.07 (internal) just thought i would share this. Haven't actually played just ran it till the title screen so far
,wiloh,2011-02-08T20:31Z,"yes it works on kmeaw 3.55 with multiman, but i had some problem extracting it on the computer. it took superlong time and i kept on saying that the file name was to long. maby it was super many small files what so i know. but i would have been better if the torrent wouldnĂÂ´t have been an .rar file. couse the size was practicly the same after extracting.

,wiloh,2011-02-08T20:34Z,"update, game crashed after a bit in to the gameplay. gonna try the other torrent instead, seems more reliable"

,you.wish,2012-06-01T07:13Z,"This works, but is a terrible way to pack a game. It will take ~2hrs+ to extract, because it's a solid archive with a 64K dictionary size. Ridiculous. Learn how to compress, webchella. You only make a solid archive if you're compressing the exact same kind of file, like text, not a random mix of already-compressed binary files and text files. Extracting a solid archive is extremely slow compared to a regular archive, and coupled with the tiny dictionary size makes it worse.  Also, any corruption in the archive makes all data that follows that corruption corrupt, as well. To anyone else, d/l this from the other torrent."
