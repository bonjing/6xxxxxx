This set started with Maya's gown. It has a classic look to it, so she thought it would look good if we used an old telephone as a prop. She's right, and she had alot of fun pretending to get a phone call, and then switching places with the phone. This is really Maya, she's very expressive, and she puts alot of her personality into this set.

Maya is a genius. Talking to Maya is talking to someone whose lights are all on. She is amazingly intelligent and has the ability to either solve great problems of thought and science, or win a million dollars on Jeopardy. I'd bet on Jeopardy because she seems to like modeling alot more than solving math problems. Personally, I'd enjoy the math more, but that's why I work on my side of the camera. Maya's got some great antique jewelry that matches well with her sophisticated style. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in natural ability, but hey...she's smart. Driving is another matter though. Maya's a genius, but I wouldn't get in a car with her behind the wheel.
