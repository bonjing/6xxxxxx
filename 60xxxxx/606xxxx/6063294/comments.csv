please seed...:S"
,Teddikilla,2011-02-10T18:54Z,"It's cool guys. I'll do some more seeding.
:P"
,Teddikilla,2011-02-10T18:55Z,Just since there seems to be a whole load more leechers than seeders. 
,Teddikilla,2011-03-26T16:31Z,"Guys, PLEASE FUCKING SEED! I can't keep uploading so much, Why am I wasting my bandwidth if Cunts don't have the decency to seed for even an hour or two? The People that seed are the reason you have the files on your pc now (or will), also, set your upload rate higher, it will help Everyone download faster if you do that, including you. The more you give the more you get back. 
Thanks all seeders, to leechers, suck a gargantuan elephant cock."
,Pologil14,2011-05-22T11:04Z,"pls seed.,downloading at 9 kbps.,slow.,"
,Teddikilla,2011-06-26T18:35Z,"I tested the connection, and I was pulling 1.2 - 1.4 mb/s average. Some people are downloading this fast, some slow. I've seeded this torrent at 34.8 atm, uploading at 800kb/s so Idk what's wrong."
,Blacker.Death.Metal,2012-04-21T08:56Z,"Wish someone would comment on quality, or completeness of episodes, or flaws in any episodes..."
