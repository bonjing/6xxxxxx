I'm terribly sorry but i can not seed this anymore,because my computer crashed so the file is gone.
I have the same musicvideo already upload again in an another torrent.
I hope you people can forgive me for all the trouble. "

Bullshit. I work as a Samsung TV salesman and believe me, AVI is THE predominant movie file out there. Mkv is still as not as popular as MPEG and MP4 filetypes. RMVB is the really dead one."
