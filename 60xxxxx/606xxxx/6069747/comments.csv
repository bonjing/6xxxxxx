u should hv read those comments by me...i said already while making the list some points if u remember...
state of play i hv seen it nd its really nt a 2nd time watch so cant do that...
flags of fathers nt interested...
cinderalla man was always in the list just no source was available(so i didnt mentioned it)...bt now there is...

was this the reason that u didnt commented for some time that i didnt replyed...lol"
,himansu_007,2010-12-29T08:42Z,"Of course not..

,muthineni,2010-12-29T08:56Z,"
@prashanth..
skipping this .got a smaller 400mb one days earlier coz the whole movie is a coffin.good quality or not we cant see anything good rt?
 lol.
And 400mb would be good to keep even if i dont like it at all. thats the main reason actually.
will get ur interview with vampire. btw u r 79 on ahashare. not bad. but we'll get u below 50 soon"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-29T10:02Z,"@himansu
oh ok..

@muthineni
ya 50 will take time its a long way..

i felt that this movie needs big size because of the darkness..dark scenes, fog scenes,scenes where there is dust blowing..scenes like these need high bitrate...
although this is p2p world lot of choices..so choose what may please u..:)"
,akindayimcan,2010-12-29T12:16Z,"thank for this movie with great quality and waiting for IWtV :)=
