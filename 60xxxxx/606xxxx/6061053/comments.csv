well yes since I can remember seeing them since the early 60s and my parents saw them from the beginning of jet air craft."" It's not new. As some young people think.

[V],joshua13,2010-12-23T20:14Z,"""Our innate intelligence tells us these are not mere vapor trails from jet engines"" 
actually mine tells me that the are vapour trails.

You will hear jet engines are ""too efficient"" to produce visible exhaust. But that's foolish The burning of jet fuel is the combining of hydro-carbons (derived from oil) with oxygen. Even if 100% efficient that makes  tons of exhaust, naturally. Neither the H, The C or the O (plus others elements) are destroyed. Jet new compounds. But is it visible?  The burning produces among other things invisible CO2 and lots of invisible gaseous water (H20) This cools and condenses to very small droplets (""vapour"") - well behind the jet so you can't see this while riding on one.  This of course is visible, and makes up the bulk of the trail. Chemtrails? of course. water is a chemical :-)"
[V],joshua13,2010-12-23T20:19Z,"Last if the spraying were true, it requires a VAST conspiracy of silence which my innate intelligence finds hard to swallow. Aircraft engineers, jet fuel makers, and anyone who understands the working and chemistry of jet engines with jet fuel, those who install the sprayers, maintain planes, fix sprayers, reload them etc,  those who sell these chemicals to the conspirators, likely all the pilots and so many more in every nation of earth would know and have to keep silent. 

It more exciting to believe in the conspiracy. The truth is rather dull to most folks. Go read a good thriller or watch one instead. "
,Thejohndoemofo,2012-06-27T06:53Z,"joshua13, I agree with a lot of what you have to say...But I was raised in the military as a child, seeing military aircraft all the time, and the trails they left behind evaporated very fast.
Everyday, as most people, I can look in the sky and see dozens of trails. Almost all evaporate immediately. What this documentary is asking is what are the trails that don't evaporate quickly? What are the ones that spread across the sky? There are plenty of news reports about military ops purposely spraying for research. What are the environmental effects of this research? That is what they're asking..."
