,karliboy,2011-01-06T22:40Z,i unrared both files and NOTHING! i thought it was a bit fishy with 2 files. dont waste your time on this one!
,jamesy84uk,2011-03-30T11:37Z,"I downloaded this, and unrared and it works absolutely perfectly. I don't know what error karliboy has experienced but the reason there are two files appear to be because the original uploader split the archives to CD-R size of 700mb, hence why one file is 698 and the other is 502.

So yeah, thanks to webchella for a good upload :-)"
,jamesy84uk,2011-03-30T11:38Z,"Also I should add, I DID get an error when I hit ""extract here"" because winrar couldn't create (or find, I can't remember) the path specified, but just go into the rar to the iso file and extract it to where you want it to go, it should work no problem."
