,over_line,2011-12-23T09:06Z,"thanks! cool little game, kinda timely, ha ha. enjoyed the trip, has some linear silliness (just keep going to all the places you can, if stuck, at one point something will occur) which holds one up in a time-warp, ha ha. thanks for making this available, you rock, Hero_No_1 and allsmartgames for making this such an easily managed download (simply download torrent, open folder, sis boom bah, there is the *.exe ready for you to install and play, no cracks no *.iso, no nothing in the way but fun fun fun).
