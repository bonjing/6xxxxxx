The prey take off into the bush with a head start, a map and a compass. The
relentless Mantracker is on horseback armed with an arsenal of forensic skills.
The hunted have 36hrs and over 40 kilometers to outrun Mantracker â€“ how they
escape, that's up to them.

This isn't about rules or money - just bragging rights. The prey are looking for
glory and Mantracker is looking for them.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relationships will be put to the test this season â€“ watch friends, teammates,
couples and co-workers take on Mantracker!

Season 2 features hour-long episodes that go deeper into the minds of both
hunter and hunted. The terrain is more grueling than ever before and Mantracker
is counting on his sidekick to know every inch of it. The prey already know each
other, but will their bond help them to the finish as they work as a team, or
will their relationship haunt them as they struggle to reach a consensus on how
to beat Mantracker?

Friendships are tested, phobias are confronted and egos are on the line in the

competitive athletes and close friends. They're also moms out to smash some
perceptions: just because you look great doesn't mean you can't bust it in the
bush. But Mantracker's hungrier than ever â€“ he lost to a team of two women last

of strength, focus and determination in the wild remote wilderness of Grande

But Erica and Kendall's drive to succeed and prove their potential make them
stellar opponents. By leaving surprises in the bush for Mantracker, will the
women successfully get under the tracker's skin and make him lose his focus, or
will the downtown divas succumb to the grueling landscapes that make hours spent
on a stair-climber and treadmill seem like a walk in the park?

It's the rainiest, muddiest and slipperiest fall on record in northern Ontario,

trained and disciplined Martial Artist and self described smartass, break out
cheeky diversions and carefully crafted escape and evade techniques that force

team, or will their different personalities clash and cost them the chase?
