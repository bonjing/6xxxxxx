,harrr5,2010-12-30T17:19Z,I'm getting audio only.  What software should I use to view on my Mac?  I've tried Quicktime and Divx Player and neither is working.
,muk0690,2011-01-02T10:35Z,@harrr5: Use K-lite codec pack. Or use KMPlayer. I don't know whether they are available for mac. Just google it.
