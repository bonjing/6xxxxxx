                    Four part drama retelling the classic biblical  
                    tale. Joseph and Mary arrive in Bethlehem, but  
                    discover they are not welcome - Joseph's family  
                    know of Mary's apparent betrayal. When Mary  
                    goes into labour, Joseph searches for somewhere  
                    for her to give birth, settling on a stable  
                    behind an inn. Thomas the shepherd is driven to  
                    violence in his rage and frustration, until he  
                    learns that the talk of the coming of the  
                    Messiah is not just words. And as the stars  
                    align, Balthasar, Melchior and Gaspar hurry in  
                    disguise to Bethlehem, desperate to be present  
                    at the greatest moment in history.
