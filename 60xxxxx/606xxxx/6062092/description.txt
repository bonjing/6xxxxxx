Storyline

In Jasper National Park, the wolves, Kate and Humphrey, have known
each other since puppyhood, but they are on the oppose ends of the 
Western Pack's social structure with Kate as the energetic Alpha 
daughter of the pack leader and Humphrey being the good humoured
Omega. That social structure forces Kate to accept an arranged 
marriage with Garth of the Eastern Pack to unite the packs for peace,
regardless of Humphrey's hopeless attraction for her. Before that union
can occur, Kate and Humphrey are captured by the park's rangers and 
sent to an Idaho park as part of a wolf repopulation project. Mindful of 
her duties, Kate is determined to return to Jasper and Humphrey offers
to help with the assistance of two odd geese. However, as this 
disparate pair struggle through the dangers to get home, a growing
mutual appreciation of their talents and then a deeper love threatens 
to disastrously complicate everything if they make it back.
