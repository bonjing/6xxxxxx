it must be some thing else in your pc m8 this works fine no virus at all

try malwarebytes free edition to check for virus and spyware thats all i can think is wrong with your pc good luck let us know the results"

I would of suggest that you execute the file sandboxed.That way you will easily see what other processes are running at the same time.Use ""Sandboxie"" for this to make sure.
Also if you found autorun.exe in your temp.directory  i strongly recommend that you scan your computer properly for malware/trojans etc..

Good Luck"

[V],Slickinator,2011-02-01T23:05Z,"and so u know there is no virus in this ,just the loader gets a warning if your security is set very high"
