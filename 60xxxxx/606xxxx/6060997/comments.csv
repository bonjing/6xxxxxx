I was wondering, do you have an email or something i could write to you at? Because i want to discuss how many episodes you have on your computer, to see if you could put together a burned-CD/DVD for my mom, of a collection of AMC episodes!! I'd be willing to pay! I just really want to catch her up so she can start watching again..........when SOAPnet left basic cable, she had to stop watching it! And she's been watching for 30 years, so i feel really bad ya know!??


Let me know!! 
I'll check back here later! "
