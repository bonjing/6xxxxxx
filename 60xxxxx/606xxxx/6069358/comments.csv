,enonumus,2012-04-10T00:49Z,"LMAO.  Can't believe people are surprised or disappointed that this isn't a sequel to the 1997 James Cameron film.  What the hell kind of a sequel did anyone think it would be?  HELLO!!!!  The ship SINKS to the bottom of the Atlantic at the end of the movie.  Jack dies along with about 1500 others, Rose dies at the end in her sleep after throwing the diamond back into the ocean.  CASE CLOSED."
