- (OBVIOUSLY see hidden files =yes Protect/Hide system files =no)
- In Explorer set folder View to Large Icons
- Right click the target folder, then customize, then change icon=>All the path to the icon INSIDE the selected folder
- Accept, accept, apply, OK
(The folder ico changes BUT to make it movable=)
- Open the folder and select Edit the hidden file Desktop.ini
- In the line IconResource CLEAR ALL THE PATH to the folder, only leaving the icon name; like:
IconResource=IconName.ico,0
- Save the file and close
NOW YOU CAN MOVE THE FOLDER EVERYWHERE WITHOUT LOOSING THE CUSTOMIZATION.
(Works with ANY folder)"

Also, looking in the pictures, I see cover for B-Wing, defender of the empire and others i've never heard before; THAT games really exists? I ask because in 86 Im 3-4 yrs. Thanks for the work and share. Really great upload and the same for XWAlliance"
,sebastianpalm,2011-01-30T12:04Z,"TienShen: Short answer, they really did exist, back in the days of DOS and floppy disks. The missions were then included in the collectors CD-ROM editions, then updated for the X-wing trilogy with new graphics.

Long answer: Read the wiki articles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_X-Wing_(series)
