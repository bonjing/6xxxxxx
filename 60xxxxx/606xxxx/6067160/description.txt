Notes: "The sounds of the street filtered the windows along with the diffused March, 1969 light. A fan whirred somewhere in an apartment nearby. The whispers of history's ghosts settled across Beale Street for another day's work. And Furry played and sang again."

Recorded March 5, 1969 in Furry's apartment near Fourth & Beale Streets, Memphis. Furry performed with his guitar, in bed, leg off.
