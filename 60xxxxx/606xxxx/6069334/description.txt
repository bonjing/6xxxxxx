This is a DTS 5.1 conversion created from a vinyl rip source utiiizing the SPEC method (ArcTan mode) as found on www.surroundbyus.com.

Only playable on home theater equipment and PC software capable of decoding a DTS signal.  Otherwise, you will hear static.

It is not recommended that you downmix these tracks to stereo, transcode them in any way, or make any changes other to them than how they are presented here. If you are not a fan of stereo-to-surround conversions, while I do recommend giving the SPEC mixes a chance, if it is not your intention to do so, please respect those who do get enjoyment out of these mixes and do not troll or flame on my, or anyone else's, posts.  

This is a brand new mix of the album, using an excellent vinyl rip by firefoxussr, as source.  Please feel free to use my previous mix of the album as a coaster.

Enjoy.
