Chris Tomlin returns with his much-anticipated new album And If Our God Is For Us..., which features the new single â€œI Will Followâ€ and a new studio recording of "Our God," the anthemic declaration of faith that has already spent numerous weeks on top of the Christian radio charts.  The new songs on And If Our God Is For Us... came from Chrisâ€™s experience as a worship leader over the years, and currently at Passion City Church in Atlanta, led by communicator and pastor, Louie Giglio. As the songwriter behind the worship favorites â€œHow Great is Our Godâ€, â€œJesus Messiahâ€, â€œHoly is the Lordâ€ and â€œForeverâ€, Chris continues to write songs that connect people to heart of Jesus and lead them to a greater worship of Him.
