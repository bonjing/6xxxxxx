He didnâ€™t. I picked an image of him I liked. I doubt Prof. Hitchens would be thrilled that I upped his article at all. Donâ€™t blame him for what *I* did.

â€œI guess the God he doesn't believe in has a sense of humor by giving him smoking related cancer. May Hitchens Rest In Hell.â€

So, the G-d that YOU apparently believe in (I assume itâ€™s one of the big three monotheistic versions) is perfectly fine with YOU condemning someone to the eternal anguish of hellfire and pain? I seem to recall all three saying something about judging others, and also about redemption and forgiveness. Hitchens has expressed his failure to rationally believe in the divine, which this article has nothing to do with, and for that YOU are eager and happy to banish him to Hell. Do you suppose your line of thinking and implied arrogant ignorance might have something to do with him not accepting your personal version of the man who lives in the sky? I make no comment one way or the other on the existence or opinions of the Deity, but I have to believe He would like a better PR representative than YOU. What a charming example you are of the grace and wisdom offered by religion. You make atheists snicker and the competent religious ashamed. You aid your professed enemy. Be silent."
