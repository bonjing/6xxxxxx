Dark Shadows the complete episodes (part 3 of 5)

DVD-Rips

encoded as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC with HandBrake. The complete Dark Shadows released in five parts totaling 129Gbs. Including all bonus interviews from the DVD's. The order of the torrents follows the DVDs starting with the introduction of Barnabas Collins and running in sequence to the end. The fifth and final part will be "the Beginning" collection, pre-Barnabas. This torrent collects DVD sets 14-19.

I have kept the original episode titles from the DVDs. I did not rename the episodes with their original episode numbers. The number ending the title string denotes the episode order (1-11, 11 being the bonus interview) As far as I can tell the quality is some of the best of the DS torrents out there, it was made using HandBrake's "high Profile" feature H.264 Video Codec/MPEG-4 Container
