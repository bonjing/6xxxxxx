shouldn't u put movie's poster instead of goku pic"
,muthineni,2010-12-24T04:54Z,"@ jarman
this is a very good love story my friend. i rarely appreciate rom coms but this is the best in its genre..
but if u really want to cry over a love story try 'my sassy girl (2001) original korean version'
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293715/
@ prashanth
you too should give this movie a try in ur free time. youll even forget its subtitled"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T05:16Z,"@jarman
ya buddy u wont be dissapointed a bit...this has everything happy moments, sad moments n comedy which will make u smile....Hugh Grant is the best in romantic-comedy's....
n abt the pic i said that i m nt able to upload at bayimg dont know why and tpb accepts images from bayimg only..so this GokU's pic will carry on...

@muthineni

dowload didnt finish yet but screen shots really very bright...maybe your best upload i will see after download finished...
if it is possible can u indicate your next uploads in which release hereafter ? HDScene or Z warriors ?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T06:23Z,"@akind
ya it is really good rip..bt all depends on source and how the movie is shot(like this one has bright colors, inception's original bluray looks dull in colors) ..i dont change any settings...

ya the american480p 5.1 is 710mb(HDscene) already ripped it...
..stranger than fiction 480p(Z warriors)
and the next two atonement630p(HDscene)
buried720p(hdscene)..."
[T],MitZep,2010-12-24T06:24Z,"hey i thought yu wud upload as a z warriors release

[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T10:26Z,"@MitZep
u can store this too..1.3gib is nt that big as compared to 2.5 or my source 6gib...

@prank,himansu
welcome guys...
prank when a torrent is uploaded in one section it says image tag from bayimg..it does nt accept other sites images i think because i tried once it with my predators and the result was i was nt able to upload the torrent...

@akind
i gave a link to tutorial of megui in one of my recent posts...try learning from that.."
,akindayimcan,2010-12-24T10:30Z,yes i am trying to learn it from your link...is that program can convert an .avi format to .mp4 ?
[T],MitZep,2010-12-24T10:54Z,"i think yu cud hav encoded the same to say a size of 700-800mb but becoz of the hd scene thing yu increased the bit rate
1.3 gb for a romcom is too big for me...."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T11:16Z,"@MitZep
no problem ur choice..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T11:19Z,"@akind

[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T12:38Z,"@mzk
no its nt gone its running perfectly well..."
,hardik_860,2010-12-24T13:12Z,"thanks prashant...
great quality........
keep them coming...."
,_Dux,2010-12-24T13:18Z,"Hey Prashant, just a question - is it possible that you stick to 2hour+ long movies (like this one) when you do a HDScene release?

The reason I'm asking is because a 2hour+ movie would probably be on 2CDs anyway and would take 1.4 GB of space, so a HDScene release of about 1.3 GB would be similar in size and people wouldn't have the feeling that it's too big... 

But a shorter movie which you can do in 500MB with your excellent quality and then you do it in HDScene release of 1 GB+... It just feels like too much space if you know what I mean...

But anyway, keep up the excellent work, we all appreciate it!"
,rakiem,2010-12-24T13:34Z,thanks for the up:)

[T],MitZep,2010-12-24T14:57Z,"im in a fix nw in this fight between quality and size 
500mb rips of yify and gunnersrock are sometimes blurry and not that gud and the excellant quality rips are of 1.5 gb onwards
in an ideal situation i wud want gud quality brrips size ranging from 600-1000mb with no blur, no grainy which play well on my 17inch pc.... "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-24T15:28Z,"@MitZep
watch ur tounge dude..in ur previous comments also u were saying as if ur ordering me or u do me some kind of favour so that i should upload according to u....
and in ur last comment also...i dont care what u want ur geeting this for free take it or leave it...simple.."
,kanha,2010-12-24T15:53Z,"@prashant22
thanks for the nice movie....."
[T],MitZep,2010-12-24T16:08Z,"hey i wasnt saying this to yu personally jst commenting so that someone might be able to help me
and i nly wrote this on yur page because it gets the most views and thus more comments if i wanted yu change yur encoding method or something i wud hav asked yu directly i just want people's views
im not ordering yu or anything, im actually quite grateful yur doing this favour to us
didnt mean to insult yu at all   "
,muthineni,2010-12-24T17:28Z,"@mitzep
here s a simple solution dude..
Download all the z warrors releases... they r the best you can get between 700-1000mb on the whole f.ing net.quality almost secretmyth.
If ur movie of choice is uploaded as hd scene release (1 gig or more) and u want it in 700mb go to kickass and 20-40. they r also great.
As for yify.. that guy has a great taste in movies but the size sometimes is too small n quality not perfect. So i go there for rarer movies .
source: my own research. trust me.
Others like u urself said vary their quality from good to blurry. 
pheww..long msg. i hope i helped"
,_Dux,2010-12-24T17:40Z,"Wow, amazing statistics! I wonder how high the numbers go when you upload it on all your sites...

Anyway, I get your point dude, just keep on ripping and giving the best quality... :)

P.S.
I've just figured out that the best rip I saw from you (Cyrus) is in 480p... I guess resolution isn't that big of a factor then, even on my 24""...
