Also, English subs are partially incorrect."
,bgschiko,2011-02-01T10:11Z,The english subs are horrible. Translated with dictionary or translation program by someone who doesn't speak english. It spoils the whole movie!
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-02-02T23:42Z,"So get other subtitles from subscene.com
Also the movie isn't corrupted.Use a better player man if you want to have no problems with movies."

Sounds corrupted to me ..."
