Kicking off with the fat guitars of "Mambo Sun," Electric Warrior winds through all of Marc Bolan's obsessions, from sleazy teenage rock & roll to spacy mysticism. "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" was the well-deserved hit, full of lust and flamboyance, but it's by no means the only good thing here. With the trashy blues stomps of "Jeepster" and "Lean Woman Blues" sitting next to the space-age rock of "Monolith" and "Planet Queen," Electric Warrior has nothing but teenage kicks; it's glam rock at its absolute best. Without question, the definitive, classic T. Rex
