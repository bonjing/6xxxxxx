,Dragossani5,2010-12-30T17:06Z,"I've updated the game with this update, but have different weapon stats as it should be in 1.10 (according to http://elementalwarofmagic.wikidot.com/weapons-armor-equipment). For example Oak Spear should have 9 attack mine has only 4. Can someone check it in game? Thx"
,medusanuk,2010-12-30T21:49Z,"i also notice problem with 1.1: shrines should provide global mana but they give bonus to unit essence, not available building beacon of hope, town hall building and much more...

take updates from others site but have same problem, cannot understand what is wrong"
,peter980,2011-01-03T15:43Z,"To fix mixup with pre-1.10 data:
-reinstall patch
-delete (or rename) DataZip.exe from game main folder"
,prfella,2011-04-11T09:17Z,"Deleting Datazip.exe will get past the loading screen. However, now that I get to the selection screen, I cant click on anything other than ""options"" ""workshop"", and ""exit"" . I cant click on new game to start a new game. Anyone know how to get around this?"
