,CADETbrazil,2010-12-28T04:38Z,"Thanks for upload this nice game. It works well, I saved the game after a playing a while, but when I clic on ""load game"" it crashes on desktop, the only way is to start a new game... Any tip?"
[T],Ex_Exist,2010-12-28T05:52Z,"CADETbrazil,
install patch 1.0.1 (copy all content TRiViUM\1.0.1\ to install game folder and use Xenus2_KeyGen.exe for activation game."
,klord2010,2010-12-28T15:15Z,I heard that all the VAs are gone... just subtitles. is this true?
,lonestar55,2010-12-28T20:50Z,Yes there are no vocals in the game at all. Fucking Game Factory Interative simply cut it out. There are vocals only at cutscenes. Need to find a way to copy them from the russian version...
,CADETbrazil,2011-01-01T15:46Z,"Unfortunately after reinstaling 3 times with patch and everything as needed, the game still crashes on desktop when click on LOAD button. Cannot play from save point."
,yan338,2011-01-02T03:41Z,"The 1.01 .exe crashed when opening, fixed by changing compatibility to ""disable desktop composition"" and ""disable visual themes"".

Hope we can get the Russian VAs."
