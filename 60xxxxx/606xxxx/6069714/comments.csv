,banan2k5,2010-12-30T12:16Z,Any clue when the 720p HDTV of S07E06 will be out?
[V],xtrancex,2010-12-30T14:19Z,banan2k5 sorry no idea but it`s fukin funny whatever the format ;)
,balanced,2010-12-30T15:32Z,"No - no it's *NOT* funny whatever the format.  There's nothing funny about grainy, non-crisp, shitty video that sacrifices quality for speed of download and does nothing more than to encourage that sort of nonsense."
[V],xtrancex,2010-12-30T20:37Z,@balanced zzzzzzzzzz upload it yourself i`m struggling to find any shares from you accept this stupid comment :P Happy New Year COCKSPLASH !
,xfear,2010-12-30T23:19Z,"Yeah this is absolutely NOT a DVDRip. This isn't even out on DVD yet, the season literally just ended last night. Please don't bullshit about the source man."

[V],xtrancex,2010-12-31T01:09Z,"your all doing exactly what i would do... downloading episode 6 to go with the 5 hdtv episodes you already had.. ""last time"" i was looking for episode six & found this in the process i don`t care about the source or the naming convention i did want to watch episode 6 though. so when i shared this i shared the whole thing not just episode 6. BECAUSE I`M NOT RETARDED :))"

Balanced, not everyone has HD capable equipment for the 720p stuff.  Why don't you bear that in mind next time before you post snarky little comments."
