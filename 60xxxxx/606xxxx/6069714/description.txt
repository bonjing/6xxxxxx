Peep Show is back: the multi-award-winning, critically acclaimed comedy now returns for its seventh series.

Mark (David Mitchell) and Jeremy (Robert Webb) are still sharing their flat in south London, but their journey through life is becoming ever more complicated and bitterly funny. Hear their deepest, darkest and most socially unacceptable thoughts as they navigate their way through a surprising role reversal: Mark, the inhibited, obsessive white-collar drone, is forced to rethink his life after becoming a father, whilst wannabe musician Jeremy, a lazy man with big ideas, finally finds himself in possession of money, power--and, finally, responsibility.

Follow Mark and Jeremy from the birth of Mark`s baby to his christening. We also meet Mark s parents for the first time, when the boys attempt to celebrate a traditional family Christmas. And a disastrous New Year s Eve party crawl culminates with Mark and Jeremy facing choices that could end their friendship forever.
