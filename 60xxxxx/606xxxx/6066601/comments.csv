,allsop1,2010-12-27T09:56Z,Thanks for sharing- but i found it not worth the trouble.Alls it did was tweak a few of the setting to make it look like it was actually working. And apon uninstalling it it actually made utorrent slower.i found that i am far better off not using it. but thanks anyway.

,whazzup3929,2010-12-29T06:01Z,UncleDaddy...do you think we r fucking stupid? a 56 k modem couldn't fucking handle that much speed u noob..fucking retard  trying to act all bad ass...

well first of all you shuld concider that the broadband company you're bound to, paying bills etc.. won't give you more speed then what you pay for, so allready there you're locked from their servers.
second.. the lines has limits you know. i'm not sure what ""dial-up"" is, if it's like adsl, the old tele-connection or whatever.
3rd thing to concider... not that it's something to think about, but anyways. even if you have limitless power-up's and gods right hand, your harddrive has some limits too, it takes time to store data into the HDD from the net, so here people say ""hey, i'd rather run 2 programs than one.""
4th quote: even if your DL speed is unlimited, the seeders have to share alot to fullfill your day-dreams.

i've downloaded stuff from here for years but i have never heard of anything like 8mb/s, not even with fibre."
,joshster321,2011-02-13T13:13Z,Great download really quick all good serial easy to use perfect :) thanks
,alkox,2011-03-02T12:44Z,"Hey ThumperTM can u please crack TORRENT BITCH PRO. Its one of the best torrent client......
Please....."
,akaismac,2011-03-15T07:33Z,"probably works for people with a higher bandwidth than i have, i don't see much of a difference but i know there is since it's a highly praised piece of software xD
thanks thumperTM
keep it up"
,wullie7362,2011-03-23T14:51Z,"@UncleDaddy.
I've been reading the comments with interest, i can't believe a moron would say he got 8mbps from a dial up, i use BT infinity (fibre optics) with download speeds of 40mbps but the most i get from downloading a torrent is about 3.7mbps so 8mbps is not possible, if you want to tell a lie then say something that is believable you fucked up moron."
,Smurfage,2011-04-29T03:56Z,"@wullie7362 - sounds like your connection is being throttled, I'm on Inifinity too and best I've had up to now from torrent download is 24mbps (with a 4.6Gb download)"
,rst108,2011-09-01T20:24Z,"@Wullie7362

You dont understand bandwidth terms, Your ISP advertises your maximum download speed in Megabits per second (mbps), utorrent and other programs usually measure it in Megabytes per second (MB/s) Notice the capitalised B. 

There are 8 bits in a byte and therefore you have to multiply yoiur MB/s speed by 8 to get the mbps speed. 8mbps is actually 1MB/s. your 3.7MB/s is 29.6mbps. you still dont get max speed but some drop is expected. i get 37mbps on BT Infinity."

thanks for upload though, appreciate it."

,killer274,2011-12-20T12:41Z,"ok all of you you saying that 8mbps is not possible are more stupid than the guy with dial up ( who was joking). mbps mean mega bits per second that mean that to get mBps (mega bytes per second) you need to divide by 8. so 8mbps is realy 1 mBps.

Also i have used my university connection before( 100mbps) and I get 12.2 as my max. Its rare but it happens. AVG is 6MB/s"
,sir.cracks99,2011-12-25T03:24Z,killer274 has a point but also uncaping your modem will allow rediculous speeds but is slightly illegal and 9 times out of 10 you will get caught cuz the service providers have some really high end software with very  well paid professionals using them to monitor  network activity including speeds and such things so i advise against that
,a3sir,2012-01-06T07:53Z,only for 32x
,firaskalam,2012-05-04T17:42Z,idont konw about this but there aprogram and get me from 40 ks to 400 kbs amzing 
,Noxtus,2012-06-03T06:06Z,i have also found that this software has not only not made downloads faster but made them actually slower.
,Kable78,2012-06-20T03:52Z,It suczzzzzzzzzz!!!!
