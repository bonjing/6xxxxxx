Series 1 Episode 2 Christmas with Gordon: Stuff the Turkey!

Gordon shows there's more to Christmas food than a big bird, with a succulent honey glazed ham with pear and saffron chutney, to an amazing winter pumpkin soup made with the help of daughters Holly and Tilly.

For Boxing Day supper he rustles up a light and fragrant salmon nicoise with a tarragon dressing, and a delicious pudding of panna cotta with pomegranate glaze.

But if you want to carry on the indulgence, then Gordon has the answer with his alternative to roast turkey, a special festive take on beef Wellington. Then there's a tasty treat of vanilla shortbread with crÃ¨me fraiche and clementines, and a rich and warming mulled wine.
