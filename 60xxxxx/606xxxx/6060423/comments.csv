,nyroi,2010-12-23T23:59Z,There is something wrong with the sound
,aldrinstryder,2010-12-24T03:18Z,is there? i hope there's not.
,davidsask,2010-12-24T11:40Z,I am beginning to wonder of late if posters of movie torrents even bother to check their content anymore? This is waste of time and should be removed ASAP. Like many of late there is no proper sound and also hard encoded subs!!!
,deathtrooper30,2010-12-24T18:23Z,GD download speeds suck anyways! Move along nothing to see here!

V: 8 (Not much to judge, the whole thing was filmed in the box)

I read the above comments, and I have always gotten great torrents from raymondhome, so i game it a shot. All the other commentors don't know what they're talking about, the video and audio were spot on. There were subtitles, but if your're using VLC player (which you should be using that or something similar) just go to video> subtitles> disable. This was a surprising good movie, I didn't think I would like it, but I did, the ending was very good.

Thanks for the upload raymondhome!"
,jarooko,2010-12-29T22:36Z,"A great rip! Sound is a pure 10, and the video... well, there is not much to discus about the video, because the movie is what it is, but considering that, the video is also great.
THE SUBS ARE NOT HARD ENCODED.
I can't believe the comments for this is rip. What the hell did people DL...

This is a GREAT RIP, like all movies UP-ed by raymondhome."
,jarooko,2010-12-29T22:39Z,"And yes, I forgot... If you don't know how to turn of the subtitles from the player, you have two files that come with the movie, with .idx and .sub extensions. So, to get rid of the subs, just delete these two files. It ain't rocket science."
,ramikaz,2011-08-15T19:29Z,HARD Subs is the way to go!!!!!!!!!!
