Little House on the Prairie: PILOT - The Premiere Movie
Directed by: Michael Landon

This is the two-hour TV movie pilot episode that served as the premiere for the long running, much beloved series. Direct from DVD rip, so run time is 96 minutes without commercials. Since it was created for television, it was not filmed in widescreen, and the 4:3 aspect ration is true to the original. Original air date was March 30th, 1974.

For any Little House fan, this is an absolute must. Unlike the series, which was "based on" the Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (and strayed farther and farther from the books as the seasons went on), this is an actual movie version of the book 'Little House on the Prairie". It details the story of their move from the east to Wisconsin, the trials and tribulations they encountered, and ends with the family leaving for Dakota Territory--where the series, and further books, took place.

A little hard to come by these days, since it seldom gets rerun on television and isn't included in the Season One box set (sold separately!), this TV-movie is one of my absolute all time favorites. Enjoy.
