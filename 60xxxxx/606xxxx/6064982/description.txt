RIP Linux -Recovery Is Possible  

You'll need at least 512MB of RAM and a 686 CPU to boot and use it.
There's a 32bit kernel and a 64bit kernel.
You can also use this Windows USB installer.
Choose "RIP Linux" from its menu, then browse to
where RIPLinuX-11.3.iso is on your hard drive etc.
It should work with any ISO below, but your USB
flash drive should be at least 256MB.

Verify the ISO under Linux or Windows.
md5sum -c RIPLinuX-11.3.md5 "It should say OK!"
