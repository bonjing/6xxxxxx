,Kaffbon,2010-12-29T17:00Z,"So, the game works and all, no bugs except for the character sort of getting stuck in the ground. I can still walk and all, but it makes a loud noise and he looks weird, that doesn't affect gameplay though.

But this bug does:

Apparently the devs are trolling the pirates. I watched a video on youtube of one of the levels, and the sawblades in my game move at LEAST twice as fast. I can not complete the level simply because it's impossible to pass these rotating sawblades. I mean the ones on the sticks that go in circles, not the stationary ones. Any fix for that?"
,Titanium11,2010-12-31T08:26Z,"Thx dude! And to all those who are complaining about trojans and viruses and shit: GET OFF THE PIRATEBAY and go BUY the game if you're so picky! REMEMBER, you are getting this for FREE..."

,Corepdata,2011-01-09T16:03Z,"I have gone through many things before i got this to work. I'll tell you how:

If you get the ''mini-dump'' error, use this link and install the directx: http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/DirectX-9.0c-Redistributable.shtml

If you get stuck on the level 3, do this:
1. Go to the installation folder (C:>program files>super meat boy)
2. Delete the UserData folder
3. Start the game exe.
4. Shut down the game
5. If you'll get some new stuff into the installation folder, that's good. (they should be like [your user name]-swarm folder and ''playername'' text file.)
6. Make a new folder called UserData.
7. Move the new stuff into that folder.

After that you shouldn't freeze on level 3. Your progress and setting will be saved too.

I hope I helped some people here :) I try to solve more stuff if there seems to be."
