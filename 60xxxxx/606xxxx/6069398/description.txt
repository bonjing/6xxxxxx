Transfer from an old LP record.

Dear Music Lovers:
  When this album was first contemplated, an impartial poll was conducted to find the songs America hated best. The result was a tie, with 3,270 melodies vying for first place. To record them would have taken twenty-two years and, by then, the songs undoubtedly would have become best sellers again.
  So we decided to pick twelve or more tunes written since the turn of the century which typify the reasons a song's popularity may fade. Actually, most of these are good songs and they didn't die a natural death-either they were murdered by the artist or committed suicide through overplaying. Songs, like people, get tired. After ten million whirls a carload of Geritol couldn't get the music to go 'round again.
  But don't mourn for these melodies. Old songs never really die-they're revived and revived and revived. And time is a great healer- it can even mend your funny bone. these musical milestones made you laugh a few years ago, and I hope you find our new versions even more hilarious.
														yllacisuM yours,
														Spike Jones
