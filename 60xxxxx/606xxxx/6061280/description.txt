The Moody Blues' Core 7 albums: Days of Future Passed, In Search of the Lost Chord, On the Threshold of a Dream, To Our Children's Children's Children, A Question of Balance, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour, Seventh Sojourn. All in their expanded forms from the recent SACD releases. None of those abbreviated releases, either: if there is a 2-disc release, it is here.
