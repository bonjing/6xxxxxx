[V],phatwarez,2010-12-24T05:07Z,"Yes sir. They're all sitting here ready to go, i'm waiting for a decent seed:leech ratio before I upload the rest, so the more people seed after they finish, the faster the others will get uploaded."
,texasplayboy_23,2010-12-24T09:58Z,Sounds good...thanks brother
,tua09788,2010-12-26T01:07Z,"Thanks for uploading...I just finished dl'ing this and tried to play it using VLC. I hear the audio, but see nothing but gray...any ideas?"
,some-young-guy,2010-12-27T19:11Z,"When VLC is greyed or blued out, you need to minimize everything and right click on your desktop and select personalize (or from control panel).  Once in there, select Display Settings (last option) and you'll get a new window.  Ensure that the Resolution slide bar is slid all the way to the right (High Res) then click apply.

On another note, I tried to view this torrent last night and the video frames kept freezing up, not to mention that VLC was really eating up a lot of CPU, much more than usual.  If this can be corrected by the uploader, please repost this game b/c I really want to watch the last quarter of this game as it is being called the game of the year in many circles."
