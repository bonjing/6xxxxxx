2007 Paper Sky   CD  GECD668

Quiet but authoritative plucky folk that occasionally gives way to rockier moments. Weaver's raspy vocals are oft-compared to Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen. He writes dark, brooding bluesy tunes similar to those two artists though fails to deliver their gut wrenching realism. He succeeds when he steps outside the formula and messes around with different sounds and more tantalizing rhythms. Unfortunately he does so too rarely to make the disc a solid listen all the way through. 

There are, however, definite highlights.
