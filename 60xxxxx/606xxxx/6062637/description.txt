...................................NFO:.................................................I.Survived.Beyond.and.Back.S01E01.HDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Description: "I Survived... Beyond and Back" reveals one of life's greatest mysteries by profiling the
extraordinary stories of people who have literally passed on to the other side. The series combines the
compelling and emotionally gripping stories of "I Survived..." with the unexplainable experiences some
people have when they are pronounced legally dead. Through first-person accounts and testimony from the
medical personnel and family members who were present, "I Survived... Beyond and Back" not only explores
the survivor's encounter with death, but also the ways in which it has changed their outlook on life
forever.
