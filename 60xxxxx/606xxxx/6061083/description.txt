Pitbull Feat. T-Pain â€“ Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor) Lyrics

So listen up
Let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Said let her go, lalala
Baby girl wanna play, let her go
Got it Pain?

Hey baby girl what you doing tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store (hey, hey baby)
Youâ€™re giving it your all when youâ€™re dancing on me
I want to see if you can give me some more (hey, hey baby)
You can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want (hey, hey baby)
Pump it from the side, pump it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back and the front (hey, hey baby)

Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala

Ooh drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey baby
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh you got it cause you
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh donâ€™t stop it
I want you tonight

Iâ€™m a??
Self paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now Iâ€™m around the world getting paid
Girl problems, no problems
Donâ€™t hate the game that wonâ€™t solve it
I want to get with you mami
Now let me see where the Lord??

Make money, make money
This chicka right here gotta eat baby
Scared money donâ€™t make money
Thatâ€™s how it goes in the street baby
But enough with the the nonsense
Baby girl take a shot to clear your conscience
Not a goon or a God, Iâ€™m a monster
Cause I hit all baddest woman in the world, gangsta

Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala
Oooh baby, baby lalalalala

Ooh drop it to the floor
Make me wanna say hey baby
Yeah, you can shake some more
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh you got it cause you
Make me wanna say hey baby
Ooh donâ€™t stop it
I want you tonight
