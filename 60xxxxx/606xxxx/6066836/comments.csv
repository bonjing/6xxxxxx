Battlespire and Redguard. "
,yklusia,2010-12-27T15:48Z,Those are spinoffs and not part of the main elder scroll saga
,HerrLucas,2010-12-27T17:25Z,"Exactly, there are only four games in the 'The Elder Scrolls' series. Battlespire is part of a second series called 'An Elder Scrolls Legend' and Redguard is part of a third series called 'The Elder Scrolls Adventures'."
,EmbMe,2010-12-28T00:17Z,"My misstake then, would still be awesome if ye would have putted em in the pack for a more ""complete"" pack.

Still greatly appreciated for the current pack ofc ^^"
,MYSTiiKSHOTTZ,2010-12-28T00:41Z,Really looking forward to playing these will seed thanks
,HerrLucas,2010-12-28T00:43Z,"Maybe I'll upload them in a Spinoff-pack. The next time I have too much time, that is."
,HerrLucas,2010-12-31T01:42Z,"Btw, I'm planning on making more torrents like this one so please, feedback in any way is welcome."
,serenity3212,2011-01-25T02:10Z,"daggerfall literally installs itself, that's the one I grew up with and the best!
Awesome! thank you so much. Plays well so far. The version we had growing up you could play it all you wanted but you couldn't play the story line lol."
,serenity3212,2011-02-02T22:11Z,in daggerfall the game won't let me play past the 20th of second seed at all...?
,SIlux,2011-02-07T10:18Z,"SEED Please. I will be. Thank you to the uploader, you sir are a god amongst men."
,SIlux,2011-02-08T23:54Z,"Fantastic stuff. Easy to install instructions, all the tools you need to do the install and a top quality pack. Thank you."
,jd03,2011-02-19T05:41Z,"I got the error you said at first run. After I uninstall the expansions and run morrowind, can I reinstall them? Or must I play without them forever?"
,jd03,2011-02-19T05:48Z,"Actually, the errors occur regardless. Something about weather chances not equaling 100% and some thing being 10 when max is 8."
,HerrLucas,2011-02-19T22:03Z,"@jd03 
That one is a bitch. You should try some googling, I don't know sorry. It's one of those very persistent Morrowind bugs, really frustrating."
,mpon90,2011-02-26T20:35Z,hi. i installed the elder scrolls and followed you instructions but when i started playing it came up a screen wich said i was missing MFPlat.dll so i fixed that and started playing again. . . now the MFPlat.dll doesnt come up. . the game simply freezes what should i do?
,mpon90,2011-02-26T22:08Z,or i should rather say that my char is freezing not anything else 
,HerrLucas,2011-03-02T22:57Z,"@mpon90

,mpon90,2011-03-03T15:59Z,oblivion the elder scrolls
,jfinity,2011-05-01T21:01Z,When i try to install update v 1.2 to oblivion i says old file not found. 
,cheme917,2011-05-24T07:07Z,"This game are and will always be the best, thanks ill seed as long as possible"
