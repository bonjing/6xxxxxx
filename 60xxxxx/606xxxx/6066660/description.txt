La Purisima Mission

Season 2, Episode 3 - Air Date: 06/19/09

The Ghost Adventures crew investigates the haunted occurrences at the La Purisima Mission in Lompoc, California. The former Spanish residence of padres, soldiers and the native Chumash is beautiful, but the air around it is heavy with the tragedy of disease and war. At La Purisima the sounds of flutes and the voices of the long-gone inhabitants still linger. Trapped within its white-washed walls, the spirits seem bound to this land, forever locked in their struggle with each other.
