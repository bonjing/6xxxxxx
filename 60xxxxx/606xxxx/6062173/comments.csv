,RoyLess,2010-12-25T07:39Z,"I strongly disagree with Cheatstfu.

This movie is a prequel to the first one and the story is based around Frankenstein, not Statham.

There are some characters that come from the first one too.

There is only one thing I can say and I BEG for you to read.

The ending is phenomenal. I know this is a straight to DVD sequel (prequel) because of the plain back story which just explains stuff about the first one. But, I must say, the ending was jaw dropping.

This DESERVES to go to the theaters just because of how well put out it was yet went to DVD for not having any major actors, but the story just flows as good as the CGI on Avatar & TRON.

I suggest you watch the first one and watch this one after, it is damn well worth it.

This is definitely NOT a bad movie, there are far more new movies out now that are worse than this. This is well damn worth your time.

That is all, the ending was extremely well planned, set up, constructed and executed.

It will leave you saying ""Hell yeah!"" as long as you follow the story and pay attention to the characters.

This is first straight to DVD sequel that I damn well can say did an amazing job."

The Death Race name is just a cheap trick to get viewers, it is nothing like the original.

See Death Race 2000 instead, from 1975 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone. Alot cooler, and a direct inspiration to Carmageddon."

Of course its gonna have the same cars!!!

I'm a huge jason statham fan and when I saw this didn't have him I thought it would be utter straight to DVD garbage. I was COMPLETELY WRONG. 

The movie is a prequel, showing how and why Death Race was created. If you remember from the first movie, the girl Jason Statham drives with mentions her first partner, Frankenstein. This is the telling of Frankenstein, so obviously a different actor must play that role. Don't be like me and sit on this movie. After seeing it was 2nd place out of TOP 100 for a month straight I said ""why the fuck not"". By the end you'll be writing a comment just like I am to promote how fucking wicked this movie is."

this problem usually occurs if you have a sound card in your PC? its pretty simple to solve. just go to the sound card setting and change the number of channels to 4. if that doesnt work then try some other channels. should work. change it back when the films done."

,elforiamoon,2011-07-23T15:00Z,"Makes sense to put Jason Statham in both movies, even if Frankenstien did die.. because A) This is a prequel that's actually a sequel.. and b) Jason Statham's character wasn't who died as Frank, if you remember right. "

V8's sound more like hot 4s or Rotaries lol... otherwise I enjoyed it. "
,goodprick,2012-03-05T02:16Z,"why do so many people have a hard on for Jason Statham? he is likeable but not really a very good actor. If your the sort of person who likes to watch Statham movies like me, then you should have no problem watching this one!"
