,11western,2010-12-28T05:07Z,Good game but kind of short!!! already finished. Where are the other ones? At the end it says feb 2010 for the game so I guess it's a typo and means feb2011. other then that a good game but not hard to figure out. GREAT GRAPHICS!!
,rezor664,2010-12-28T06:58Z,"This is only episode 1, there are a total of five episodes. The next episode is set to be released in feb 2011."
[V],HMVinyl,2010-12-28T09:51Z,"Im actually pretty surprised at this game, I wasnt expecting much, but it's actually good enough to be a BTTF game. Mostly point and click gameplay, but the voice acting is superb and the story is pretty tight too..

Thanks rlf-rls!"
,desdea,2010-12-28T16:14Z,"perfect download, works perfectly, congratulations for the torrent, waiting for the next episodes."
,nosaj128,2010-12-29T05:55Z,"I'm a little jealous that most people are not having any problems playing this game. I do exactly what it says to do, install, copy cracked etc and when it starts the opening skips like a scratched cd. Then the first 10 seconds of play there is a black screen w/ a little bit color red near the bottom right. I see the Doc disappear and Marty waking up in his room. But as soon as it cuts to the Docs lab where the sale is happening it's all black again. 
I visited the sites and reviewed what can be done to fix this error. But they don't cover what my system has,..  it has VIA Chrome9. I've tried many driver updated etc., and NOTHING. So like I said, I'm a little jealous. "
,kamy81,2010-12-30T16:08Z,It's so frustrating. I can't seem to understand where to paste the cracked file because i keep being asked to login before playing

[T],rlf-rls,2011-01-21T13:27Z,In torrent folder Back.to.the.Future.The.Game.Episode.1.Its.About.Time.RIP.PROPER-Unleashed you have another folder named Unleashed... install the game and than copy the file BackToTheFuture101.exe from Unleashed folder to the game instalation folder and overwrite then play game :) Simple as that

,chazz1488,2011-01-23T05:32Z,"Works good, thanks for the upload mate"
,Mcfly696,2011-01-23T12:11Z,"I had to register so I could thank you. This upload works perfectly and I had a blast playing it. Thanks rlf-rls for the quality rip.

Also, for the few of you that don't seem to understand the insanely simple install instructions... Once you install the game, do not run the game. What you want to do first, is grab the crack that is located inside the Unleashed folder that you downloaded in this torrent. The crack is named ""BackToTheFuture101."" 
Right-click on the crack, press Copy. Then, go to the install game directory. Default on Windows should be something like: C:\Program Files\Telltale Games\Back to the Future The Game\Episode 1
Do not drop it in the main folder. Drop it in the Episode 1 folder and overwrite the BackToTheFuture101 file already there. Then, once that's done, just double click that new icon and enjoy the game. "

,reah2011,2011-06-13T23:48Z,"Copy cracked content from the included Unleashed folder and overwrite

this means, open the folder called UNLEASHED. Click the application icon and right click, choose COPY.

Go to C: - program files - telltale games - back to the future the game (this may change depending on where you told the installer to put the files.

then choose a FOLDER called Episode 1. right click anywhere inside the folder and choose PASTE. 

then choose to OVERWRITE and/or REPLACE the existing file with that name.

hey presto, now you can play! :)"
