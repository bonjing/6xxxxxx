Is there any way you can post the DTS audio file only?
I ask because many of us have the Chinese Bluray, and it of course has the Chinese audio track only. 
I'd love to be able to mux your DTS to my 720p!
And I'm sure a hell of a lot of others would want to, also - as many, many people got that Chinese language Bluray.

Any chance?"

,cinesimon,2010-12-24T11:41Z,"Sorry I meant to say - I would get the whole DVD, but I can't afford to. Here in NZ my ISP has hiked prices and cut capacity. 
And as I have the Vision 720p already,(along with many others), I was hoping to just download the audio track.
I completely understand if you're just too busy to do it - just thought I'd ask.
Thanks so much for all your hard work!"
,cinesimon,2010-12-24T11:50Z,"Something funny going on with the comments system
Anyway: yes I would just get the whole thing and do it myself, but I can't afford to - here in NZ my ISP has cut capacity allowance and raised prices - which is why I was hoping to only download the audio track.
I understand it's a funny request(though in this case it may well be used as so many have the Chinese audio bluray), but just thought I'd ask!

Thank you for all the hard work you put in, by the way."
