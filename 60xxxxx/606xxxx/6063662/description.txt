                    A chilling drama based on the Edwardian ghost  
                    story Oh, Whistle and I'll come to You, My Lad  
                    by MR James, adapted for BBC Two by Neil Cross.  
                    James Parkin has just left his wife in the care  
                    of a nursing home. Pensive and in emotional  
                    turmoil, he travels to their old favourite  
                    destination for rambling in an off-season  
                    British seaside town. There he encounters an  
                    apparition on a desolate beach, which begins to  
                    haunt him - with terrifying consequences.
