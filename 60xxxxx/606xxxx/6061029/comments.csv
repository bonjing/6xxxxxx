,Gr8BSer,2011-12-17T05:57Z,"Those of you that complain about the D/L speed check your settings, either your not opening up your U/L speed or your history shows that you yourself do not seed. This file was slower then I am used to but, I finished this torrent with an avg. speed of 472kB or 3.78mb which ever you prefer, off of no more then 7 seeders most the time just 2 seeders. It is not the number of seeders that sets your d/l speed, it is the speed at which the seeders and peers u/l that sets your d/l speed. I know it is easier to blame others, but look at yourself first.  What ever the reason is for all you whinners out there DAMN you are getting this for free. If you don't like the wait then go and buy it. I bet you get home from the store and bitch about how hard they made it for you to shoplift the crap you got.

By the way great d/l thanks alot
