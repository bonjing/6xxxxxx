,redmetoc,2011-01-07T01:42Z,"thanks for the up.

for neil802, there are two ""SRT"" files, one for each of the AVI files.  Not sure what the ""SUB"" file is but if you use VLC Media Player you should be fine with the two SRT files --- after you rename them to match the corresponding AVI file names exactly."

My.Beautiful.Girl.Mari.2001.XviD.2AUDIO.CD2-WAF.Chs.srt	11.26 KiB

Those are Chinese.
There's no way to use the English file."
