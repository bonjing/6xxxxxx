This is the fourth disc from Newfoundland native Amelia Curran. Recorded in a bedroom, simple organic arrangements by Phil Sydore accompany Ms. Curranâ€™s lone strumming, leading us willingly through misery. â€œIâ€™m just a Tuesday in a world of Friday nightsâ€ she sings on Just a Tuesday. Though she paints a bleak picture throughout, you wonâ€™t want to run a warm bath and slice from wrist to elbow. Listen to mandolin and accordion frolic through tunes like the gorgeous All the Ladies. The interplay between clarinet and trombone harkens back to For Him and the Girls-era Hawksley. Tom Waits is an immediate comparison, but she finds herself naturally on a crash course with Will Sheff of Okkervil River. Perfect for the Times Change(d) crowd.
