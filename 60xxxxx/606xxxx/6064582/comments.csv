Video- 7 Just a little blurry, and dark. It was always a dark movie though.
Movie- 8 Still like the old one, but they did a good job making this one.

Overall- 8"

And if you still don't trust it, Download the SAMPLE first."

Not the greatest quality but it being free and a fairly quick download, I give it an 86% approval!

Thanks to the uploader! Thanks to the filmer! Long Live the Pirates! ARRRR!"
,jeremias_mto_doido,2011-02-08T17:34Z,"mimimimi, stop crying...

Download the sample file and make up your mind if the movie deserve the download...

Based on a cam work:
A7
V7
Better than average cam work's out there, but a little far from dvdrip..."
,CM1337,2011-02-10T06:16Z,"In my opinion; V: 6 A: 5
The video is very grey, even for a cam it's not great, I deleted after downloading. Audio goes out at times and can't hear important parts."
,omghax,2011-02-26T06:12Z,"obviously a camera, audio has a constant buzz and the video looks like it was recorded on an iphone"
,jesuisnate,2011-02-28T08:44Z,"Loved watching this in theaters. The story is no more original than James Cameron's Pocahontas (lol), but the visuals were worth forking out some fifteen bucks to see.

I don't see how you people can say the quality of this rip is outstanding. This shit looks like something off of a cellphone, and the audio is off a smidgen but recognizable nonetheless. Not to mention a guy walks up and out right in front of the camera (which, however, is expected because it's not from a DVD anyway). It's 'average' at the most, and viewable - but certainly not something I can enjoy.

I will be buying this on Blu-ray, regardless of the fact that I don't even have a Blu-ray player. Ha"
