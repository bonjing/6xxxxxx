This series a direct theft and dump on TPB from the UK media site THE BOX dot BZ. The OP listed themselves as anonymous, so much thanks to everyone involved with that great site - just want to make sure credit is given to the correct folks. In accordance with the rules and requested behaviour from that site, I am creating new torrent files to distribute these more widely, but the torrent itself is unchanged.

All following notes are from the original torrent, since the series has not yet shown up on IMDB.
