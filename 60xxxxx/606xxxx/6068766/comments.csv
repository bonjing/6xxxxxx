I've been downloading this for almost 6 hours, I'm at 20.777 ratio, and now I have no seeds, only peers.

I have a 25/25 connection, and I'm only getting 4 or 5 kb/s download, while I've been upping at 700k - 1.5mb/s per torrent.

You still only show 0, 1 or 2 seeds per torrent.

Something ain't working right."
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-28T12:49Z,"Now I'm only getting 0.1kb/s down.  No connected seeds, and ETA of 13d16w.

I tried to help out with your torrent by leaving my 25 megabit/s upload speed open.  

On one torrent, I've uploaded 6.9 Gb, and only downloaded 286 Mb.

Now I just have to quit your torrents.  They just aren't working.

It's a shame, because this is a good series of documentaries that people need to watch."

,PhilLesh12,2010-12-29T06:39Z,"I just restarted your torrents in my client, now, and they seem a lot more ""healthy"" today.

I'll be seeding for at least a day to keep them going, once I complete downloading.

My ISP is pretty reliable, and I have 25mb/s upload.  Fiber optic all the way to the house! :)"
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-29T06:48Z,"what do you have to do to reset?

If it's only doing an ""ipconfig /release"" then ""ipconfig /renew"", you can write a .bat file in notebook, and then use scheduler to have it run ever morning.

If it's a bit more complex, you can still use scheduler to do it, with a little bit of creativity.

'Course, if it's a problem with your gateway/router, yeah, that's not so easy.  Unless you go old school and get a lamp timer to plug your router into.  I know how crazy that sounds, but it might work.  I use them for lights all over my house, and never thought of using them for a router or to reset a computer or whatever, but hey, it will do the job."
