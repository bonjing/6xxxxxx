-Smotri.com (it's in English)
-Metacafe.com

Youtube/Vimeo/Dailymotion doesn't allow truth but you might find small segments.

Don't Go West 3.0 is in the works and will be one of the most important documentaries ever made. Alex the Celtic Rebel can be found on his wordpress page"

,killzoomer,2011-07-25T00:32Z,WOW!!!!! When i finally got the time watch this on my PS3 about an hour and 8 minuets in asome sort of protection lock stopped the video and said i can' watch it on that device (PS3) -_-
,Fuddhed,2011-08-22T14:44Z,"""a very educational documentary"" my ass. Hours and hours of aimless clips and some nut rambling about how he sees anal sex in everything from cartoon starfish to swirling galaxies depicted in movies with no cohesive or coherent presentation whatsoever, nor even a scholastic effort.  Christ, I've seen homos actually make a better argument for the same premise. This was hours of crap by some autistic retard with a Nero home video edit kit and a ton of free time. Unwatchable.

Thanks to the uploader for sharing, naturally, I guess I appreciate HIS effort to  make it available for analysis (which is a lot more than I can say for the producer/writer), but holy hell that was horrible! Documentary- hah!  Wadda joke. If I see the guy that recommended this crap to me I'm gonna smack him.

No offense, LennyB- I do appreciate your effort to make it available, I honestly do. But he content.... I can encourage others to watch it only to see how NOT to make a 'documentary' and hope people are smart enough to see REAL hollywood propaganda and subtexts, not some maniac aspies who thinks a momentary scene with a city-street man-hole cover actually is code for anal sex. Fucking idiot. Art Bell on LSD would sound lucid next to this dipshit producer. A sophomore AV volunteer with a phone camera could make a better film.

By all  means- download so you can see for yourself!"
