,benhenry6969,2010-12-28T16:35Z,Thank you for posting this. Do you have episodes 3 or 5 from this season that you could upload?
,IrishQ,2010-12-28T20:06Z,"tyvm for this scenebalance!

I'm also looking for S08E08.

I have both S08E03 and S08E05, but a tiny upload speed.  Reply here if that's no problem..."
,benhenry6969,2010-12-28T23:55Z,"IrishQ: Definitely no problem, as long as you don't mind me keeping up the download until they're finished.  I really appreciate it!"

and

I hope it will work, as no trackers are working for me (openbittorrent 'offline (timed out)', thepiratebay 'HTTP error 404' and the udp versions 'invalid URL').  I think that it should work via PEX.  If not, please point this n00b in the right direction.  lol

I'll keep seeding for at least a week."
,IrishQ,2011-01-01T21:49Z,I found S08E08 which I'll up tomorrow...
,IrishQ,2011-01-02T11:27Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6077829

Again, even if it shows 0 seeds, I'm here via PEX for at least week."
