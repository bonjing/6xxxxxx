,siggy13,2011-03-20T04:29Z,Can I download without the subtitles?
,jollyroger1721,2011-08-06T20:54Z,@Siggy. Hey just use VLC player. It's my favorite player anyway as it plays anything including dvd and blu ray codec all in the FREE download. It's a great player and to turn off Tekken subtitles in VLC just turn them off under Video < Subtitles track
