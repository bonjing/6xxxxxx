Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Trek attitude says to give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
