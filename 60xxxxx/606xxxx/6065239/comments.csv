,AIMANNY,2010-12-26T06:44Z,sound not working
,seedMeister,2010-12-26T17:23Z,"same. miss tennant, new doctor is meh"
,Llamaduck,2010-12-26T22:36Z,"Same. Matt Smith sucks, yet I still watch the show 'cause everything else about it rocks. =P"
,Lordnils,2010-12-26T23:24Z,"I am from the old school. Grew up watching Tom Baker. At first I hated Peter.
David was great, but come on people! Give Matt the chance he deserves! He IS the Doctor."

and replace any - for -- after translating ;)"
,Dragncore,2010-12-27T17:19Z,"..Tom Baker is still the best Doctor ever after 47 years of Doctor Who! Yes, Peter was ok too. ;-)  Tennant was good, but I don't miss him one bit. Matt has embraced the character well in his 1st season he IS THE DOCTOR. Its the nature of the show, but I guess you could always go watch Torchwood or Sarah Jane(K-9 FOREVER!!) instead if he is not to your liking. LOL!"
,Livens,2010-12-27T17:33Z,Thanks for this. SOUND works FINE. Doctor who is Doctor Who. Either get used to the new Doctor's or stop watching the show.
,bhobtoo,2011-01-01T05:46Z,"Long time fan, and I have to agree with Llamaduck. If they would dump Matt Smith and keep Karen Gillan they would have a much better show.

BTW, thanks for the upload and the massive seeding."
,CNUTFCKU,2011-01-01T05:46Z,"Overrated, over budgeted, load of old bollocks that needs another Jon Pertwee. A Dr who sends you to behind the sofa..."
,danijel.james,2011-04-18T04:39Z,"David Tennant is the funniest Doctor by far. Matt is a tosser and the Doctor is a respectable and middle aged man, not some 20yo punk that sucked a lot of cock to get into the position. He's by no means of any use as a Doctor. The Doctor is amazing. Matt sucks!"
