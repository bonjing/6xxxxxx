[V],Koedje,2010-12-23T15:11Z,"you know that aint true, dont spam my torrents please."
,User897,2010-12-24T10:37Z,"You are wrong.  This is the Special Edition version, not the original from 1980.  Get your facts straight.  The version of the film here is from 2004 or 2006, which means it is from the 1997 Special Edition, plus tweaks made to the film in 2004 for the first DVD release and then the repackaged DVD in 2006.  Your description even states ""(special edition)"", so before you call me a spammer, you might want to check your fucking facts.  As it stands, your torrent is incorrectly named."

,imakbari,2011-05-31T14:22Z,"i'm so confused
how can episode V be released in 1980 when episode I was released on 1999?
I'm absolutely sure that Jar Jar Binks is a totally computer generated character, so it wouldn't be on the 80s. "

are you fucking stupid???"
,hazmatt23,2011-07-10T16:41Z,"@Furdeck, I think that's a rhetorical question.  They obviously are."
,cinevicio,2011-08-24T22:23Z,"@imakbari

I'm tired of this shit. Ok, here we go: there are 3 and only 3 (three) episodes: I - Star Wars (1977); II - The Empire Strikes Back (1980); III - Return of the Jedi (1983). That's ALL. Evth else is PURE CRAP. "
,thelock76,2011-10-28T03:39Z,CRAP... inescapable subtitles!!!  DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT GERMAN SUBTITLES
,heathnied,2011-10-29T08:01Z,"IV - A New Hope
V - The Empire Strikes Back
VI Return of the Jedi

cinevicio's dates are right but everyone just refers to A New Hope as Star Wars because it was the first one made."
,iCnOverlay,2012-02-01T02:11Z,"Annoying subtitles, shitty quality video even for a 700MB file. There are better downloads out there. Try http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6702498/Star_Wars_Episode_V_-_The_Empire_Strikes_Back_(1980)_BRRIP"
