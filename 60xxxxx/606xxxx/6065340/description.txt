Game information:
=================

HEAVEN is a new PC game!

Welcome to Heaven. It's as simple as that. Developed by Genesis Works
LLC, "Heaven" is a PC DVD ROM Adventure video game. It's the first of its
kind. Using their "World Immersion Technology" (WIT) game engine, Genesis
Works was able to bring you the most advanced adventure gaming experience
to date.

Heaven dares to take you to a world never before seen on the computer
screen. Towering cathedrals made out of shimmering gold, streets paved
with solid crystals, and vista so gorgeous, truly an awe inspiring
experience. Heaven is truly on a biblical scale. All of its visuals and
environments are inspired from old biblical text.

Your gaming experience starts on board the experimental space shuttle - the
USS Genesis. The ride is bumpy, so get ready for an intro like no other
game.

You play the young but adventurous astronaut Commander Joshua.

MERRY CHRISTMAS 2010
