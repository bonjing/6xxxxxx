,somedude.1001,2010-12-28T13:54Z,extremely shitty movie anyway
,DontPissMeOff,2010-12-29T12:07Z,I don't know why people hate this film. I really liked it and marked it 8/10 on IMDB. It's better than War of the Worlds in my opinion. The effects are great  and the ending is satisfying. 
,CGN3,2010-12-29T21:26Z,"What is the quality of the movie can you rate it ?

,Enverex,2010-12-30T21:15Z,"DontPissMeOff: IMDB says 4.6, not 8. Also everyone I knew that saw it said it was complete crap.

Quality also doesn't look that great from those screenshots."

,aafz02,2011-01-01T16:26Z,"Hey Enverex!! 
""DontPissMeOff: IMDB says 4.6, not 8.""

He didn't say otherwise, if you read his post properly he says...  ""I really liked it and marked it 8/10 on IMDB""  HE liked it and so HE marked it 8/10."

,lontrus,2011-02-26T16:04Z,"to Leonidas123 ...
at least it is a 720p like title says not 527p and like all the rest of the torrents what say 720p in title but are 1280x544 and so on what is no 720p...

i expect 720p on 5gb file not 544 526 527 and so on for the hight on the screen ... 16:9 is 720p not 2.35:1

ty for the real 720p"
,nakedfromthewaistdown,2011-03-12T20:41Z,"Please do not waste 90 minutes of your life watching this film, it's awful.... just awful.  Go back to scubs Turkleton"
,ericv1984,2011-03-21T06:19Z,This movie SUCKED and you can tell by the screenshots that it's not a true 720p BluRay rip.
,defendor,2011-03-24T21:32Z,average quality and the films is a pile of wank! wouldn't bother with the d/l
,minus_zero,2011-03-28T05:26Z,"A/10
V/10
M/ - minus fuckin 3!!!! it sucked bigfoot's smelly cock, so go ahead and DL you'll never get that 1.5 hours back in your life!

P.s. I not one to usually comment other then A/V/M but this movie most be stopped.. think about it, some guy sitt'in at home on a sunday night all depressed and says to him self ""hummm, this trailer looks kinda cool, I think I'll give it a look see and take my mind off my shity life for a while"". Then when the movie ends his life just sucks that much more, and BAM!!!! he blows his fuck'in head off!!! Is that what you want to see happen???? Didn't think so.. So do everbody a huge fav and stop seeding this nugget of golden shit...
thanx byebye! "
,shadowkillaa,2011-03-29T07:36Z,"I've been waiting along time for an HD rip of this movie. But this rip is truly dissapointing... Its waaay too blury compared to other 720p Rips. If you want a good quality rip, better off downloading from another uploader."
