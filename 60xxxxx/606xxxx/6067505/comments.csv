i saw the above link.

well, i knew where imdb link was. The reason why i always write a comment (if u notice it will be the first comment ) with an Imdb link is for the people who are new to the torrent world or more specifically new to tpb. most of these people dont see the imdb link and well they just dont know what movie is about. Almost all people know about the Imdb link, but still there are exceptions :) 

So for the good of such people, i post this link, and obviously i dont post on all torrents, i just do it on urs, because i know that ur uploads are excellent. Very soon many people will leave .avi and go for .mkv

This is the same reason why i have posted links of screenshots on most of ur torrents. ( I hope they help ). 

One more thing,

Riddler is good with .mkv but i have compared a few movies uploaded by him with urs.

i feel urs is better.

And with YIFY and MKV Guy, i dont like them uploading such small size rips.

700-800 mb is good. it balances out size and quality.

1.36 gb - not at all happening.

Well i guess i have written quite a lot.

Thanx for the upload though. (and for the reply :)




P.S :   i was searching for transformers 1,2 in .mkv near 700mb size. no one has uploaded it on tpb yet ( at least no good rips ). So u might like to upload them.
