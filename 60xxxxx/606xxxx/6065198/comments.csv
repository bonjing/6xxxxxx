plz tell is it real or fake and if real then how about the quality?"
,chopmax,2010-12-26T11:01Z,"@shailu212
A comment telling an upload by eztv is real or a comment about the quality is useless. It doesn`t contain any new information. Eztv has a perfect track record."
,DueZor,2010-12-26T12:03Z,Fake.. Its just a black screen with no sound and its 6:16:27 long!
,DueZor,2010-12-26T13:20Z,ups.. wrong window
,RomanS23,2010-12-26T19:16Z,"WORKING!
Both episodes are original. Still, officially show start on January. These episodes are published âpre-airâ probably as a promo of this TV show. Enjoy and greetings from Prague!"
,egk,2010-12-27T00:04Z,I watched S04E01 with no problems but this one would not play for me. I tried it with Zoom Player and VLC and it would not do anything in either of them.
,SgtMacTavish,2010-12-27T22:16Z,"@shallu212

,Lyllosan,2011-01-01T16:31Z,"Actually as a huge leecher of eztvs stuff I can tell you that he doesn't have a perfect track record. I remember several incidents, uploading an old episode with the name of the new episode, wrong name on wrong series etc etc."
