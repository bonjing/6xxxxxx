ORFF Carmina burana - November 3-5, 2010

San Francisco Symphony & Chorus

Carlos Kalmar, conductor

Ragnar Bolin, Chorus Director

Timing: 62:35

Soloists: Joelle Harvey, Nicholas Phan, Keith Phares


Carl Orffâ€™s famed cantata Carmina burana occupies a vastly different realm: its erotic energy and sheer visceral power have installed it among Western musicâ€™s most iconic works. Alfred Schnittkeâ€™s whimsical Moz-Art Ã  la Haydn, a clever nod to the preeminent voices of the Classical period, prefaces music by the father of the Classical style himself. Haydnâ€™s Symphony No. 97, one of the composerâ€™s beloved â€œLondonâ€ Symphonies, illustrates his characteristic elegance and charm.

Carlos Kalmar will conduct at the November 3-5 performances, and San Francisco Symphony Resident Conductor Donato Cabrera will conduct November 8.

The Crowden Allegro Con Brio Chorus features students from The Crowden School, a coeducational independent day school specializing in the musical growth and education of children in grades four through eight. The Crowden School combines an intellectually-engaging academic school day with a daily music program. It has attracted support from an array of musicians, including Yo-Yo Ma, Midori, Philip Glass, Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, John Adams, and Simon Rattle. SFS Chorus Director Ragnar Bohlin, whose two sons attend Crowden, frequently volunteers his time to work with the choruses. The school is part of the nonprofit Crowden Music Center, which has over 6,000 individuals attending classes, workshops, rehearsals, and concerts each year. Crowden is committed to reaching out to children for whom music education would be otherwise unavailable, through its onsite and outreach programs with Berkeley public schools and community centers. Laura Kakis Serper, Director of Choral Music for The Crowden School, has directed many choral groups, including the Kairos Youth Choir in Berkeley, which she founded, and the SF Girls' and SF Boys' choruses. She is the Choral Director of the adult choir at Oakland's Ascension Cathedral, and often a soprano soloist in a variety of venues. She received her degrees in Music Education and Voice Performance from University of the Pacific Conservatory of  Music, Westminster Choir College, and Aspen Music Institute. In January 2010, she received an honorary commendation at the Senate for Kairos Choirâ€™s twenty years of service to the Bay Area Community, by State Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner.
