,AlexCCCP,2011-01-27T04:35Z,"Update 4 includes all previous updates, no other files required. Works fine for me.
This is the SAME as the other skidrow update 4 torrent except this is UNRARd by inferno."
,Aphax,2011-01-29T21:23Z,"Please help! The game was working just fine, but as i love mods, i wanted to run it with NVSE, which rewuires me to have the latest update of the game. I installed the update, and copied over the cracks, but now everytime i try to launch it, in all possible ways, it crashes instantly, and gives me the message ""FalloutNV Has stopped working"" Please help!"
,Aphax,2011-01-30T11:34Z,"Okay never mind, thanks for the update, it was just something with my mod load order"
,mikev55,2011-02-09T07:05Z,"Is there some kinda weak cheat mode in this r somthing? I just opened my game and had new items, lameeeee"
[T],Calypso127,2011-02-10T06:12Z,"no cheat mode, just the DLC items"
,planescaped,2011-02-10T07:53Z,"Hopefully this will make the Script Extender Work.

Sucks balls you can only ge the patch through steam."
,lolpingu,2011-02-11T20:43Z,So can anyone confirm this makes NVSE work?
,Dourig,2011-02-21T10:31Z,"Dear SKiDROW / -iNFERNO,

I recently downloaded Fallout New Vegas and was taken by surprise when I learned NVSE would only work with Steam.

I have tried since 2/20/2011 at 9:30 PM till now when I am posting this comment to find a way to get only the update so that I may play a game that I had already bought for the console.

I thank you guys for this update, I cant effectively express my gratitude right now, you cant even begin to imagine my frustration during this.


Keep up the good work."
,Spollero,2011-02-23T22:16Z,Do you have access to the legit update 5 with Dead Money included. Because the one on this site has a computer breaking virus in it.
,tehhiphop,2011-02-28T05:31Z,Much love.  Per usual works perfectly.  Thank again.
