1990s are an indie rock three-piece band from Glasgow, Scotland.

The band's second album, Kicks, was produced by Bernard Butler and was released on 23 March 2009. This twelve-track sophomore effort included the glam-stomp of 'The Box', 'Everybody Please Relax' and the single '59' (the video of which was shot on the number 59 bus around Glasgow). It boasted a beefier, harmony-driven sound, whilst maintaining the band's trademark style and wit. Kicks also featured a guest turn from former The Long Blondes singer Kate Jackson, who lent backing vocals to the track "Kickstrasse." NME wrote that "like Supergrass and British Sea Power before them, 1990s' refusal to be difficult and consistent greatness makes them a hard concept to market. But a fantastic one to listen to."
