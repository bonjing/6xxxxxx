This story is all about a ambitious boy named Seenu (Ravi Teja) who dreams of becoming a don. He always likes to be called as â€˜Donâ€™ Seenu since childhood due to the strong influence of the Amitabh Bachchan starrer â€˜Donâ€™. He grows up with just one passion - that of becoming the World's No: 1 Don. Thanks to his enterprising nature, he gains access to the cream of the city's dons, and uses his cleverness to play off the top two - Machiraju (Sayaji Shinde) and Narsing (Sri Hari), fierce rivals - against each other. Seenu wants to join one of these dons and grow up in the ranks. He joins hands with Machiraju(Sayaji Shinde). In the process he is given a task to go to Swiss and win the heart of Narsingâ€™s sister whose marriage is fixed with the son of the super don Mukesh (Mahesh Manjrekar). Seenu goes to Germany and wins the heart of Deepthi (Shriya) and later, he discovers that he was shown the wrong girl. The wrong girl is none another than Deepthi (Shriya), who is the sister of Machiraju. This leads to various turns in the plot. What happens next is all about how Seenu achieves his dream of becoming a don and live happily with Deepthi.
