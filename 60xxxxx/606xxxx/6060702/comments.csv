,freeholay,2010-12-24T10:41Z,"This torrent uploader has four torrents. I downloaded this torrent and it produces only a black screen on VLC. On Quicktime which is supposed to run mp4 video natively, QT gave an error message saying it couldn't find the proper information to start the file.

There is audio with the file. 

The size is suspect as well. 

I am guessing this is just ab bad encoding and it sure isn't .avi format.

There have been attempts to post corrupted and bad files on Part 1 of this 24/7 installment so I am skeptical that this is a valid torrent and at the very least it's just a very incompetent encoding of the video file. At worst, it's another example of someone trying to upload garbage to disrupt torrent sites.

I wouldn't download this torrent. The two posters above me are way too promotional about this torrent. 

BOTTOM LINE: This torrent is MP4 and the poster has only a few torrents posted and no SKULL beside there name. While not everyone has the trusted mark of the skull beside there name, I found this torrent did not work for me.

There are other part 2 torrents out there for this 24/7 installment. Search for ""penguins capitals"" and they'll pop up... it might take a little longer to download until the seeds catch up but you won't be downloading a questionable torrent if there is a skull beside the name."
