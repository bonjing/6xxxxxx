C4Eva (in association with Team Jungle & Team Xecuter) released the iXtreme LT+ v1.1 modified FW for all retail revisions (32, 36, 40, 46, 47, 58, 59, 78, 79) of the "phat" Hitachi DVD drives (GDR-3120L):

Official release of the iXtreme LT+ for Hitachi (FAT Models)
- Supports AP25 backups for Hitachi 78,79
- Other Hitachis (32,36,40,46,47,58,59) updated to conform to LT spec
- Optimised PFI code to accomodate AP25 SS data
- Defeats current AP25 protection
- Protects console from logging AP25 violation for a period of 3 minutes, turn off/on console on black screen bootup before your 3 minutes is up 
- Full disc stealth used by default
- Waveless booting , disc images are assumed to be correct!
- Split-Vid used as default

If booting an AP25 title without AP25 SS on 78 or 79 game will not boot but will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12611 for approx 3 minutes
If LT+ encounters an unknown AP25 challenge, game will not boot but console will still be protected from logging AP25 violation on current dash 12611 for approx 3 minutes

AP25 SS are region specific for region locked games

LT+ for slim 9504 and 0225 is progressing, soon.
