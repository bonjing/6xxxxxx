First Animal Rhymes (Early Learning Centre) [OGG] [twistle]

Now for something completely different ... Some Animal Nursery Rhymes !  Not my usual listening, you understand, but this CD was on my desk so ... *shrug* :)

Some of these are very silly, and quite a few I have not heard elsewhere.  Not all may be considered 'suitable' by everyone, however.  I don't know who, for example, thought it would be a good idea to make lots of pig noises for the terrors to gleefully copy.  I recommend listening through the lot, and picking out the better ones for a playlist.

Sung in British English.
