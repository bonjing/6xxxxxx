Completing Thomas Arslanâ€™s trilogy on the Turkish community in the Kreuzberg district of Berlin, A Fine Day is lean and luminous in its chronicling of a young womanâ€™s search for love. Deniz, a â€œregally placidâ€ (Variety) twenty-one-year-old, freelance actress is enlivened by the uncertainty that lays before her now that she has dumped her boyfriend, seemingly on a whim. With her brisk and confident strut, she appears out to conquer the world, her gaze sober, focused, and in search of that special someone, whom she may have found in her enigmatic neighbour Diego. A Fine Day is a sumptuously shot yet refreshingly economical, Rohmeresque moral tale (a direct nod is made to the French master when Deniz takes a job dubbing Un Conte dâ€™Ã©tÃ©). The other influence is Pialat; a story Deniz recounts at an audition recalls his Ã€ nos amours, which featured an adolescent Sandrine Bonnaire also in search of first love. An ambulatory tendency is discernible in many of the Berlin School films, in which meandering city-searches become metaphors for charactersâ€™ states of longing and self-discovery. In this case, Arslanâ€™s camera rarely strays from Deniz, framing her tightly as she strides through a Berlin in full summer bloom, its radiance matching hers. Punctuated with music by Morton Feldman, A Fine Day is â€œstrewn with the gentlest of ironies and coincidencesâ€ (Eddie Cockrell, Variety) and is a pure delight.

Arslan's previous feature Â»DealerÂ« suggested a poised talent, a sure eye and a composed sensibility brought to bear on a 'still waters run deep' portrait surely inspired by Bresson. His follow-up maintains the promise, though the template has shifted towards Rohmer, with a meandering female protagonist (shown dubbing Â»A Summer's TaleÂ«), a good bit of talk and some string-pulling. A 'day in the life' snapshot, it's likewise reminiscent of prime Richard Linklater, in both its episodic linearity and its deployment of lop-sided set piece dialogue - as Deniz (Turhan) leaves her lover, surveys romantic plights with old family and friends, submits to a curiously sparse job audition, shares ideas with strangers and eyes up boys. It's a study of the proverbial hungry heart, profiled mostly through speech but also through Deniz's roving eye and the daily pattern of her peregrination. Not as substantial as the aforementioned models, mind, but lucid and definitely intriguing.
