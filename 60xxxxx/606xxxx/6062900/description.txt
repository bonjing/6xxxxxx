1: A delightful story exploring the relationship between a man and his dog, a wise and perceptive friend who sniffs trouble in a potential relationship.

2: When visiting the stores and shopping centres, do people spare a thought for the man sweating away inside his Father Christmas costume? Do they wonder how he might feel about the spirit of Christmas? Might he prefer to be at home with his family and his cat Rudolph?

3: A lovesick swallow longs to migrate south towards the warmth and the light.
However, he stays behind to carry out the wishes of the Happy Prince, a gilded statue looking down from a giant column and observing the behaviour of the rich and the poor in his city.

4: A canine lapse in concentration causes chaos during the making of an illicit movie on a remote piece of railway track.
