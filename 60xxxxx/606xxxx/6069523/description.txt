Edguy played with no bassist in their earliest days before Tobias Sammett began playing the instrument. Tobias Exxel joined soon after the recordings of Vain Glory Opera finished as Sammet wanted to focus on singing.

Tobias Sammet has made guest appearances for Aina, Final Chapter, Revolution Renaissance and the Nuclear Blast Allstars project.

Markus Grosskopf of Helloween played with Edguy for one show in August 2010 as Tobias Exxel's wife was due to give birth at the same time.
