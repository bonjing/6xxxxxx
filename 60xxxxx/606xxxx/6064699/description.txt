For sheer impact, the Clash rank second only to the Sex Pistols in the U.K. punk explosion of the mid-70's; for consistency, growth and longevity, they are peerless. An explicitly political band, their music crackled with raw energy on their first releases, but their sound broadened as the songwriting of guitarists/singers Mick Jones and Joe Strummer matured.

A love of reggae (Junior Murvin's "Police And Thieves", work with Mikey Dread) and classic 60's tunes (Bobby Fuller's "I Fought The Law") gave them a depth that most of the punk movement lacked, and pushed them in directions both obscure (the dub songs on the "Sandinista" set) and popular ("Rock The Casbah", a top 10 hit).
Entertainment Reviews:

Entertainment Weekly
"...tear-down-the-walls punk....the Clash's most protean tracks make current alternative rock sound diluted and compromised." - Rating: A-

Q - 4/00, p.107
5 stars out of 5 - "...a 63-track telling of one of rock's more labyrinthine yarns....we travel from a 1977 demo of 'Janie Jones' to the unedited version of 'Straight To Hell'....about as good as record consumption gets."

Melody Maker - 2/29/00, pp.48-9
5 stars out of 5 - "...represents the finest body of work a British band has left since The Beatles....concentrating heavily on their finest 2 albums [THE CLASH and LONDON CALLING]....Perfect."
