This is not a parable 
This is a terrible 
This is a terrible thing 

Yes I will rhyme that, after, after all I've done today 
I have earned my wings 

It happened today. Hooray! Hooray! 
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray! 

We'll leave the allegory to a different Bible story 

[ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/it-happened-today-lyrics-rem.html ]

Out of deference, defiance, the choice 
Closing on a promise, after, after all I've done today 
I have earned my voice 

It happened today. Hooray! Hooray! 
It happened. Hip, hip, hooray! 

Oohs, and aahs, and awws
