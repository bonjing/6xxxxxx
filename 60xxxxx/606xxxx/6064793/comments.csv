,felesar2,2011-01-03T08:44Z,"what in the hell. . . I swear that was the fastest download I have ever seen for a file this size.
Generally it takes me 30-60 minutes, depending on traffic. This one was done and seeding before I had even finish querying this morning's downloads.
The other 3 torrents I have up right now are chugging along, avg 350-450 kB/s, and estimated time complete is avg 25 min. This one was crazy fast though. I don't even care if the content sucks, it DL'ed so wicked fast.
I did manage to check it, popping through and fast forwarding, and it's standard FXG quality, which is to say, it's the best quality out here on scene.
But wow, that's some crazy ass download time.
Cheers"

This gave me a trojan horse but my virus detecter deleted it, the movie stops sometimes and give you a black screen but to be recorded with cellphone it's a little good"
