,vinnievuik,2011-01-08T13:25Z,"Thanks for uploading this, it works fine. It costs some time to get the license working, because I didn't read your remark the the key should be copied into the installation directory.

@shacky003
Indeed, I first downloaded WinRAR from the WinRAR site, before I could open the file. Not very handy!"
