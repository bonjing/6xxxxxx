upload more iTunes decrypts (if they have an english audio track).  They are the professional quality.

rutracker has a large selection."

might be worth browsing from time to time as well."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-28T17:45Z,"like here is a good torrent I found  trolling

only problem is they dubbed over the default AC3 with RUS, least I think that's what they did.  The AAC track sounds untouched.

These are iTunes dumps."
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-28T17:54Z,thanks but no
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-28T17:55Z,i know ur trying to help but im not interested. ive got my sources n i know what im doing :)
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-28T18:34Z,Didn't say you didn't know what your doing.  Just noticed you have upped some web rips before and I thought they were pretty good.  I'm even promoting one.
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-28T19:15Z,"I upload whatever pops up first (if someone else hasnt already uploaded it). if there is a healthy hdtv torrent, i'm only gonna upgrade to bluray :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-28T19:49Z,"these iTunes decrypts are superior though than the HDTV copies.  There aren't any flaws in the encode or transmission.  Anyhow, just was seeing if you were interested.  I'll probably troll these sites myself to find completed series not on BluRay."
