,ekagrata,2011-03-16T23:27Z,"ive copied the nocd crack, and everything and updated the game files, but i still keep getting the erorr ""initilization failed"" any suggestions on how to fix?"
,zanos1,2011-03-17T09:40Z,"for people that don't know, i just figured it out.
install power iso.
register.
in the bar at the top click mount and mount the aom d1 vcd file to F: drive.
go to my computer and run it.
install the game, insert the disc code.
it will tell you to insert disk 2, re open power iso and mount to F: drive aom d2 vcd
it will continue then ask for disk 1 so re mount aom d1 vcd to the F: drive.
it works."
,ekagrata,2011-03-17T23:53Z,"i managed to get it working by playing it through the diagnostic section of it.

through the start menu, goto the microsoft games folder (if that is what it is called for anyone else) then run the game from one of the diagnostic functions, either no sound or safe video.... after a few plays through that it will work, sound and all :)"

for those having trouble, dont use PowerISO instead use Daemon tools lite, thats what I used and it worked with me.

,j_s_bach,2011-10-28T18:19Z,"Hey bitches, i know a lot of you will be very sad when they install the game and realise that the maximum resolution supported by the game is 1024*768, even though your pc support much higher. As a result you see a crappy screen.
There is a solution, just visit this link
http://www.nooblet.org/blog/2008/age-of-mythology-widescreen-resolution/

If its down for any reason, just right click the shortcut, hit properties and in the target leave a space and add this: xres=1600 yres=900
1600 and 900 should be replaced with your resolution."
,Algathonix,2011-11-04T11:18Z,"Okay, for anyone who isn't bright enough to install:

if you haven't installed power-iso, install it. open AOM_D1 with power-iso and mount it. then hit open the disc you mounted it to and start the setup. when  asked for secon Cd mount AOM_D2 (don't close your installation...) and then hit okay, when they ask you to insert first key do the same thing.

then mount AOMX and install it, after you are done open the nocdcrack and replace it with the original (fast way to get there is rightclick the shortcut you made, and then click go to directory or something. paste it and replace the file...) ur done"
,Repinski,2011-12-04T18:22Z,"So I downloaded this and am having a couple issues and would like some help.

1) When I try to make an online multiplayer account I get a blank blue box with an ok button that when pressed does nothing.

2) I'm having issues getting the expansion. The main game and the update to 1.10 worked wonders but I never used the AOMX ISO file and when I try to mount it and then open the drive to activate an install it says the following. ""application not found""


Any help would be greatly appreciated. The main game works though which is the important part but the expansion and online play would be fabulous if i could get them working."

,InYourFace2nite,2011-12-25T21:38Z,"never mind i fixed the problem if anyone else gets this error when starting the game just 
Start Age of Mythology in Safe mode, and then change the Screen Size setting in the game. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Click Start, and then point to All Programs.
2. Point to Microsoft Games, point to Age of Mythology, point to Diagnostics, and then click Age of Mythology - Safe video.
3. When the game starts, click Options on the startup menu.
4. In the Screen Size list, click 640x480x16, and then click OK.
5. On the startup menu, click Exit.
6. Start the game as you do normally.

,TheEpicWon,2012-01-05T20:57Z,"Guys what the heck do you do with the .VCD files? Like I tried this so many times, once I was able to mount the first disc somehow and got it to install but once the program asked for the second disc and I mounted it I had no idea why it wasn't accepting it, I've been trying to get this thing to work for two days. And some people are saying you can just mount the .VCD files, but I don't see how you can, it won't let me mount them. So I have 3 PowerISO files right now, and I have Daemon Tools and PowerISO installed right now, and I have no idea how to get the first CD to work, which is a powerISO file. Whenever I DO mount it, I go to 'My Computer' and click on the G: drive (the drive it is located on) and all it gives me is a .VCD file inside the powerISO file (the powerISO file is the mounted one). I am really lost and have no idea what to do. If someone can figure this out that would be greatly appreciated, including what to do once you have the first CD installed."
,con3jo23,2012-01-23T19:13Z,i followed all steps everything was completed but when game starts it only goes by the starting video and them it says initialization failed and i also tried the safe mode and it also says the same what can i do

How do I make the crack work for the original AOM?"
