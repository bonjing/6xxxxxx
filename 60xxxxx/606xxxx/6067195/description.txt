Another of Max's many media projects, this one airs on Iran's Press TV.

In this edition of the show Max talks with the director of Plunder: The Crime of Our Time and investigative journalist, Danny Schechter. Danny Schechter says the economic situation in the US is much worse than most people think. He says everything including the media is controlled by the big banks and companies. He believes that there is an information war going on and if they succeed in destroying WikiLeaks the next target is the internet itself.

expected it?
Check out my torrents blog for info about what I am

Some sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an 
uploaded torrent's description, so I have included 
the blog's web address in a file included with this
torrent named:

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
