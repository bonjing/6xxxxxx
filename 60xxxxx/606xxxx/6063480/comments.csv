.. And yet you searched for TS3 , and clicked on this torrent.

@nedgreb
Samma hÃ¤r , kÃ¶pte Sims 1 samma dag dÃ¥ den kom ut , var sÃ¥ fÃ¤st vid spelet , men idag har man spelat allt mer sÃ¤llan , man blir ju Ã¤ldre o bÃ¶rjar ha ett liv.

Aja kan rekomendera att du laddar ner TS3 eller nattlivs expansionpack separat frÃ¥n annat torrent , dess som finns i svensk eller multiplangause material , fÃ¶r om ngt av de Ã¤r pÃ¥ svenska sÃ¥ blir hela spelet pÃ¥ svenska oavsett vad du sattit fÃ¶r sprÃ¥k pÃ¥ de andra expansionpack."

Tp all downloaders, I suggest you first download and read all text files. This will allow you to understand what is included so you can download only what you need/want instead of the entire file. This approach should speed things up.

EVERYONE PLEASE SEED! Once you have downloaded what you want, please consider allowing the remaining files to download so that you may seed to others. Thank you.

,ganadorf10,2011-01-05T21:19Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    

Does anyone else notice that the main game files are in .rar files? I think I'm a average knowledged user, but I can't figure out how to mount or burn this image type. How do I do this?!!! I've been trying to use PowerIso to somehow change the format, but it's not working! No where in the instructions does it say how to mount or burn these. It doesn't even say exactly which files to mount or burn. I'm running a Windows Vista 32 bit.

By the way, EvilAsh34 is right, while downloading, skip the prima guide and then you're good to go. These seeders have just turned into leechers!!! >:(

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,ganadorf10,2011-01-05T22:22Z,"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ok everyone! To the people with the problem I had: You need to extract the files. My computer just did not reconize the file, so I had to look on google and found a .rar extractor. Here are the steps that should have been included:
1. Download the .rar extractor: RAR Extract Frog it's free and does the job well
2. Go into RAR Extract frog and click, ""unrar."" 
3. Use the recommended settings and then start
4. You will then have the .iso you need.

To highcall: Thanks (NOT) for confusing the heck out of me. I spent 4 hours trying to figure this out. I'm not really mad at you, just frustrated. This was a learning experience though, so I can thank you for that.

Have fun everyone! I'll keep seeding at least what I have!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
,sb099,2011-01-07T05:19Z,"wow, guys. *facepalm*
