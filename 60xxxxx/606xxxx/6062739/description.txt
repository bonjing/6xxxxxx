[W4F PRESENTS]: Ninja.Warrior.S12E01.PDTV.XviD-W4F




[AIR DATE] 2010/12/05

[RELEASE DATE]: 2010/12/05

Genre: Japanese Game Show/Obstacle Course




Description:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_%28TV_series%29


Its another series of Ninja Warrior! This is Sasuke 12 from 2003.


And just to clarify the labeling scheme, this is the first part of
the 12th original Sasuke tournament. This is the most logical labelling
for Ninja Warrior fans, ie not following the original American broadcasts.





"Nooo, Kinnikun! That's so disappointing!"
