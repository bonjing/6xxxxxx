Is there any way you can post the DTS audio file only?
I ask because many of us have the Chinese Bluray, and it of course has the Chinese audio track only. 
I'd love to be able to mux your DTS to my 720p!
And I'm sure a hell of a lot of others would want to, also - as many, many people got that Chinese language Bluray.

Any chance?"
