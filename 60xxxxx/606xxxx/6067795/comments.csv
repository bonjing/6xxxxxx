,r0tt3n,2010-12-30T10:13Z,Awesome - so glad they made another episode.  I thought the first was fantastic. Woohoo!!
,r0tt3n,2010-12-31T01:29Z,"FYI - this video makes explorer crash when it tries to generate a thumbnail for the video.  I have Shark007 codec pack installed, so it's technically whatever codec is responsible for mkv that's at fault.  Moving on..."
,r0tt3n,2010-12-31T11:54Z,"After discussing this with the creator of the codec pack I'm using to play back this file (shark007), he informed me that the issue is a faulty mkv encoding.  View here for more info if interested:"

,arzus,2011-01-17T14:01Z,"FuckMonopolyMan, you're truly an a**hole, you must know that. Why don't keep any spoilers to yourself?"
,kalinin92,2011-01-17T20:07Z,"Why is it 1.2GB? is it longer than the first one, or just in ""wrong"" format?... arzus, second that"
,Thorneater,2011-01-18T13:20Z,"love the show. Hope they'll get all the funding they need...

First one was, ok, interesting... second episode really opened things up and gives us a mistery we want solved and an unpossibility everyone does indeed wish is possible.

This series gets a 10. (esp. considering the small budget)"
,alexvicious,2011-01-25T18:43Z,"FYI I tried to watch this file through my WD TV media player and it crashed. After the crash I had to reload the firmware or else no video, audio, image was loading. Through VLC it works ok."
,2831008304,2011-01-26T01:10Z,"Anyone got any advice for playing this without disturbance? I use VLC and never have problems apart from occasionally *.mkv files. I don't understand it, no amount of tweaking settings helps. The same was true of 'Dirk Gently' recently released as *.mkv. I couldn't watch until it was kindly repacked by someone else. At the moment I cannot watch this and no repack yet. HELP!"
,r0tt3n,2011-01-27T02:23Z,"Moderator, if you read this, please remove FuckMonopolyMan's comments - it's a completely blatent spoiler.  What a jackass."

,flatusgass,2011-04-21T16:40Z,"""hope you like Motown""????

This is easily the second worst writing I have ever witnessed in a production of this scale. Sure, there is worse, but to find worse you have to watch skits put on by kids on their Youtube videos. This is truly some of the most contrived, pretentious, and child-like writing I have seen from an otherwise semi-decent production. Whichever dullard wrote this is clearly playing ""grown up"", and trying way too hard to emulate the well worn path of bad-hollywood dialog, instead of writing anything honest. Idiot pretender. No other element (except the equally laughable acting) of this projects production is as lame as the cheeze-whiz dialog this infant came up with. Who writes like this?

Bad acting, you can almost stomach on something like this, since it's such a budget production. But someone should really fire the idiot writer, or beat him/her to a bloody pulp with a semen and booger-stained copy of ""Screenwriting for dummies""."
