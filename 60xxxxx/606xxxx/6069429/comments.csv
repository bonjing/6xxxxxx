Maybe you can help me. I'm lookin for a movie called Big Shots (1987) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092655/

If you could find and post that one it'd be really awesome.


Also any old skool Gary Coleman flicks too.

Audio a 9 only b/c it goes out of sync near the last 20 minutes...but no big deal!  Thanks for the upload.  "
,aussy1,2011-05-06T12:54Z,"I downloaded it.
CLicked on the folder then clicked on the movie.
it then said 'windows explorer has stopped working' then restarts. Everytime i click on the
bruce almight folder now it keeps repeating that.
Obviously a fucking virus/spyware/malware. Dont download it!"
