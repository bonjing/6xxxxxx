,ofpirate,2010-12-28T22:31Z,"same as above comment - also unzip, unrar seems redundant?"

,BDSMers,2011-01-01T19:49Z,cannot unzip/unrar. reports that file needed is missing
,mammon78,2011-01-03T16:36Z,"I get a missing file warning as well.  It unpacks fine to a .r00 file, an .nfo, and a file_id.diz. But when you try to unpack the .r00 file it says it's missing a .r01 file.  Any idea how you got it to work caxluis?"
