There is well known bug in dosbox 0.74 so that the stereo sound is reversed in Fade to Black; if you know how you can compile dosbox with this patch:
http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=25827
so that you can reverse the stereo putting swapstereo=true in the mixer section of the configuration file.

Note: dosbox is NOT included. It is up to you to install it and make the shortcuts.

Have fun.
