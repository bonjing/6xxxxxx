,ghstnthmchn,2011-01-31T19:04Z,"Hello;

Had a question regarding the install of this.

I wanted to do this as an upgrade, and not a clean install.  Do I need to burn this to a disk or can I just run this from my desktop (where I saved the folder)?  And if I'm burning it, do I burn everything or just the .iso file?

Thank you four your time, expertise & the torrent in general;
JD"
