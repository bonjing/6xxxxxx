 Album Info..: 
 
 Great White followed their breakthrough effort, ...Twice Shy, with the well-crafted, professional Hooked. Although the band wears their influences on their sleeves -- the bluesy wail of Led Zeppelin and the lean, driving riffs of AC/DC being obvious touchstones -- Hooked is a consistently rocking, high-quality mainstream hard rock album. It didn't achieve the commercial heights of its predecessor, probably because of the lack of one instantly recognizable killer single on the level of "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" or "Rock Me," but Hooked still stands as one of Great White's best efforts. Highlights include "Call It Rock N' Roll" and Desert Moon."
