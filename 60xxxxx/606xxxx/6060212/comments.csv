,hammer669,2010-12-30T23:12Z,btw for some reason I now get TomTom Europe showing up all the time in my App Store updates.
,spiiiitz,2011-01-01T00:43Z,"Yeah same thing here hammer. Blueeyeblond do you have a fix? In my app store it tells me I have an update for Tomtom Europe to version 1.6.

Also, it might just be me, but does map share work
With this custom ipa?

Thx"
,MADDSPD,2011-01-02T05:37Z,"I also cannot get Map Share updates to download. I even tried deleting the app and installing fresh.  Could it be because of the custom compiled map? I keep getting the ""Unable to update map corrections. Please try again later"" message...

TomTom Europe update keeps popping up for me in the App Store as well; no biggie though... Obviously the app needs to be based off something; and since there's not a USA/CAN/MX version even available afaik then maybe blueeyeblond based it off the Europe main app..."
