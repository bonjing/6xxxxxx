tried running it as admin?it works fine at my side here."
,gorgang,2010-12-29T09:30Z,"Installed it, moved patch to directory and ran it: still wants code to start. This thing work?"
,shacker8,2010-12-29T15:52Z,"Same issue here as Gorgang.  Installed it, copied the file, ran it...still asks for registration when you open it."
[V],kentucky-kid,2010-12-29T22:07Z,"have u guys click ""patch""?not just run the patch alone,u need to make sure the patching work is done."
,gorgang,2010-12-29T23:05Z,Huh?
,gorgang,2010-12-29T23:13Z,"'have u guys click ""patch""?not just run the patch alone' is confusing. Again, the patch was transferred to the installed magix directory, run until a kind of green ""ok"" showed; but, when the program ran after this patching, it still asks for registration code. 

Note: the tiny patch image is rather tricky to see and read and use. I appreciate the effort to make this work, but some user-friendly tweaking is needed."
,Mercureality,2010-12-30T16:59Z,Same issue as gorgang and shaker8. Clicked the patch icon/text and retried the launch but it still asks for the license. I am running on XP with no user names/admin set up and any help will be greatly appreciated K-Kid. Thanks in advance :) 
[V],kentucky-kid,2011-01-18T13:06Z,hmm thats weird. i'll try come up with a fix for it soon. probably the patch doesn't works with xp. idk.
,cam55555,2011-01-21T00:46Z,Norton 360 said there is a Gehenna.exe/Trojan_gen_2 in the patch file
,Creyz1,2011-02-03T11:41Z,Patch doesnt work on XP
,mazdarati,2011-05-25T18:24Z,i dont have any more space in C/ so i have all off it in D/ but every file is in D/ so i made an map and put everything in that map where to put patch?
