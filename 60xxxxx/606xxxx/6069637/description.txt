Freedom of ChoiceNow in use on over 150 projects, the Vision Engine gives you the freedom to create the type of game you want (MMOs, FPS, RPG, casual, serious, etc) on the platform of your choice. It has been carefully optimized to efficiently utilize all available hardware resources on all major platforms, including PC, Xbox360Â®, PLAYSTATIONÂ®3 and Nintendo WiiÂ®, and now even browsers.
