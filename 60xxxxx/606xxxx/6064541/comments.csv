,yosoyusuario,2011-01-02T06:13Z,"You know what, MKVONLY? From now on, You are my hero. I mean, too many languages in just 2.19 gib? I guess that's what hillwaker means when He says ""The way all multi-language uploads should be offered!"" (Please, hillwaker, let me quote You.) Thanks a lot, MKVONLY, and keep on with the good work. By the way, if someone could sugest a very good reproducer, 'cause sometimes I have troubles to find a specific lenguage   "

I have been looking for a quality torrent of this movie for quite a time. Superb quality!"
,weaping_reaper,2011-01-28T06:42Z,"What the fuck is this shit?! You mean I have to sync this shit up myself?! I have to use VLC as the video, and WMP as my audio?! What kinda torrent is this?! @ billyrust1 said something about merging? 

I'm giving this torrent a thumbs down for the next 3 days. If someone can tell me how to merge the Video and Audio, I'll come back and give 5 thumbs up because I really like this movie and the Video quality is a 10.

Sum help?"

,KickassWashingMachine,2011-02-14T03:56Z,"Interestingly enough, though, this is 16:9 while the original DVD release was 2.35:1. You'd think the 16:9 format was achieved by cropping away the sides, but actually apparently the 2.35 format was achieved by cropping away the top and bottom. Go figure!!!"
,weaping_reaper,2011-02-20T00:30Z,"@KickassWashingMachine, Thanks for the help.. that's all I wanted :-D"
