Stepping out from the raucous crowd that is the 11-piece folk ensemble 

Bellowhead could be viewed as something of a risk for vocalist, cellist and 

fiddler Rachael McShane â€“ itâ€™s one thing to be carousing in a chorus, but 

quite another to hold the stage all on your own.
Happily, as with fellow Bellowhead member Jon Bowdenâ€™s superb Songs 

From the Floodplain album of earlier this year, the gamble pays off 

handsomely. Within seconds of the yearning start to The Gardner, you know 

you're in the presence of something very special.

A traditional ballad, it sounds like it could have been written yesterday such is 

the freshness of tone and the lightness of touch that McShane exhibits. Her 

vocal is one that is conversant with the history and reputation of such a tune, 

but is utterly unencumbered and far from intimidated.

Away from McShane's sparkling performances, the core group of James 

Peacock (piano, keyboards), Jonathan Proud (bass) and Adam Sinclair 

(drums) provide supple and engaging support. The horn-augmented 

skitter-funk of Maid on the Shore wheels through tricky signatures as well as 

rocking it up as McShane herself tears off a blinding fiddle solo.

Elsewhere, elegant and understated arrangements Captain Ward, The 

Drowned Sailor and opener Miles Weatherhill wouldn't sound out of place 

on an ECM label jazz album. Cool spacious keyboard runs, inquisitive and 

prowling bass, and neatly polished drumming not only lift the instrumental 

stakes, but serve to elevate McShane's voice.

And what a voice.

Folk music enthusiasts who've been around the block will be able to tell you 

where they were when they first heard Anne Briggs or Sandy Denny. In a few 

years a new generation of listeners will be able to do the same when it comes 

to Rachael McShane.
