Boot Options explained:

1. hiren boot cd 9.6 >

2. fix NTLDR issues:
To fix your ntldr missing error,

3. windows ME boot disk:
It has support to run fdisk operations as well as MBR tools too.

4. MRI BOOT cd > updated 2 Dec 2008: (cracked)
It has many security tools, like kaspersky, panda, mcafee, spyware doctor, trend micro, spy sweeper with antivirus, evido.. Also it gives you full ntfs and fat access under gui (this cd loads with vista pe), at the end of scanning it will allow you to edit start up settings of your OS even delete those entries with their files too, also this cd has hard drive management tools and pc checking tools like pc check etc as well as recovery console.,. Believe me this cd has everything that u need to fix any system that has viruses or any other issues. It even lets you edit Osâ€™s start up and registry.â€ Boot from MRI PE â€œis main bootable option there, to run multiple virus scans and stuff, go through with all process until it leads u to the explorer type interface where you can access your ntfs and fat32 drives. Plus I have delete true image 11 from its menu to save dvd space, as it was not needed at all while we have acronis echo server (it is way costly then home version hehehe).
Plz note that your system should have at least 192 MB memory to run this..

5. Universal xp with driver packs:
â€œ1st image (xpsp2. GHO) â€œ

I have taken it from a Chinese board, actually I did test MANY ghost releases, and I liked only this one, I have selected sp2 for some reason, as I know some of my mates (even at SRN too) who still prefer sp2, and above all it will not have any driver conflicts as some users r reported to have issues with sp3, this one has driver packs of sound, graphics (custom made), mass storage, WLAN, LAN (these 3 r official BTS packs which I have included, after restoration of image, when your system will restart, and load windows, then before this, a selection dialog will appear, you SHOULD select all driver packs to extract, as I had to edit packs to enter BTS packs.. Then at desktop you will see An eXPerience folder, plz apply those tweaks (those r from tiny xp full from ultra dvd, I have chosen it coz it belongs to last sp2 release. By the way this xp has hotfixes till july 2008, (except sp3), it will have office 2003 and win rar installed by default.. Follow this to install.

â€œWhen ghost32 ll load, click ok > load > partition or disk > from image > select xpsp2. gho on root of dvd. When setup will complete, click reset computer thatâ€™s it â€œ

â€œ2nd image HD-Pre-Install. GHO by blackbalfur (SRN) â€œ

Well this man â€œblackbalfur â€œis a remarkable computer expert that we have at SRN, he has invented many ways to install xp from different ways, the way that I am going to describe is very interesting,
First of all let me tell you that he has used untouched xp sp3 from MSDN as the base of his Pre-Install XP image, he just included serial for us, for language selection etc you will have to do it yourself!,
Ok, suppose you have a pc which has no usb boot support, no cd rom etc, then just simply take HDD from that pc, attach it with your working pc, boot from this dvd, and boot ghost by selecting â€œUniversal xp â€œwhich is below MRI option, (by the way u can boot from norton ghost in hiren boot cd too) after you boot from it, click ok > load > partition or disk > from image > select â€œHD-Pre-Install. GHO â€œfrom root of this dvd and then select your slave HDD (HDD of other pc that you have attached to your system) and select its partition 1 Â© and accept any notification after selection of partition of targeted HDD, when this process will complete, click â€œreset computer â€œand thatâ€™s it, youâ€™re DONE!, take that HDD out, and put it in its original pc, and let it start, you will see like windows installation screen, just treat it in casual way when you install windows, after that it will take you to setup, it will ask you if you want to repair or install, press enter for new installation, then first select same partition you selected while ghost process (most probably c) and hit â€œconvert file system to NTFS â€œthatâ€™s it, set up will copy windows files, and restart, and then normal windows installation will begin,,

PLUS u can restore the ghost image to the target HDD even within your working system (where u have attached HDD), go to root of my dvd and you will find a folder with name â€œprograms â€œit is used for my pe image, open it, and you will see a folder name â€œGhost 11 â€œthere you will find 3 important files â€œghost32 â€œ(By using this you can restore or back up images, it is windows version of ghost 32, while at boot prompt of this dvd you will use dos version, thatâ€™s the only difference), â€œghostexp â€œ(by using this u can edit any ghost image), â€œghostsrv â€œu can restore it while in servers..

Go make a cup of coffee, watch news, and after you come back, your system will be ready for u.

(IMPORTANT NOTE: as this dvdâ€™s boot menu says â€œboot from c â€œand has no timer, it does not mean that you cant boot from any other drive like D or E, you can first hit enter at â€œhiren boot cd â€œthere you can select â€œhard disk â€œit will detect active partition (partition with OS or where you restored ghost â€œand will load it.)

\" You can always install this in your system if u need untouched xp sp3 , since all other operating systems on this dvd are heavily modified..\"

6. Last xp 20.1 with driver packs:
It is by RON, it is also very popular OS, and is heavily modified and eye candy..

7. intoXicatorâ€™s live pe: (antivirus updates 2 Dec-08 )
