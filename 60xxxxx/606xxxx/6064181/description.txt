Tales Of Glory And Tragedy is the third release by the one woman neofolk project Carved In Stone. The woman behind this project goes by the name of Swawa, though her real name is Ilona Jescke. She has performed in various metal bands, such as Dark Intention and Paimon. She eventually ended up being a member of the pagan black metal band Taunusheim, which has released NebelkÃ¤mpfe on Scharzdorn in 2005. As said, this release is her third one, after the MCD The Forgotten Belief (2002) and Hear The Voice (2004), both released through Schwarzdorn as well.

 the third track, SÃ¸rg Aldri, which is in Norwegian. Very versatile on the language aspect indeed.
