Comic Book: The Movie is a 2004 direct-to-DVD mockumentary directed by and starring Mark Hamill.

The story revolves around comic book fan Don Swan and his battle, at least in his mind, against a fictional film studio which is about to announce a film based on his favorite superhero, Commander Courage.

Most of the movie was filmed at a San Diego Comic-Con. All the interviews with attendees while Hamill remained in-character were unscripted, for a realistic look.

The stars of the movie are primarily known for their work as cartoon voice-actors: Billy West, Roger Rose, Jess Harnell, Lori Alan, Daran Norris, Jim Cummings, Jill Talley, Tara Strong, Arleen Sorkin, Gary Owens, James Arnold Taylor, Maurice LaMarche, Debi Derryberry, and Tom Kenny. Other actors include screen legends Sid Caesar and Jonathan Winters.
Cameo appearances in the movie include Kevin Smith (filmmaker and comic book writer), Hugh Hefner (originator of Playboy), Stan Lee of Marvel Comics, Lloyd Kaufman (filmmaker and president of Troma Films), actor Bruce Campbell, Peter David (comic book writer), Paul Dini (comic book and animated series writer), Bruce Timm (comic book and animated series writer), David Prowse (who played Darth Vader opposite Hamill in Star Wars), actor Peter Mayhew (who played Chewbacca alongside Hamill in Star Wars), actor Jeremy Bulloch (who played Boba Fett alongside Hamil in The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi), actor and voiceover performer Edd Hall, special effects designer Greg Nicotero, and Matt Groening (creator of the comic Life in Hell and animated TV series The Simpsons and Futurama).

This was a pretty tough movie for me to find, not sure it's necessarily worth it - kind of in the spirit of the two Trekkies movies, but not quite as good - but to help out anyone else who might be looking for it, please help spread it around by seeding it as long as you can, at least until reaching a 1:1 ratio.
