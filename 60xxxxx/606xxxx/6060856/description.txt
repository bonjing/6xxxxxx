Blues for Boston is lloyd Thayerâ€™s much anticipated third album, released in response to constant requests by his fans for an â€œall bluesâ€ cd. And so these 13 songs are just that, all blues, played in Thayerâ€™s incredibly unique style, which combines elements of old time Delta masters with modern ideas and stories of today.

Thayer plays all of his songs lapstyle on squareneck resonator guitars, including a 1929 National tricone. Also included on this cd are several songs played on lap style 12 string guitar, with the strings raised by a piece of bone that Thayer cut himself. The 12 string adds a haunting, almost sitar like quality to songs like Fred McDowellâ€™s â€œYou Got to Moveâ€ and Thayerâ€™s own â€œEverybody has to Sufferâ€. Last, but not least, and always a crowd favorite at festivals and shows is the song â€œFlat Footâ€ which is played on a home made one stringed diddley bow.

Thayerâ€™s medley of Skip Jamesâ€™ â€œKilling Floorâ€ and Bob Dylanâ€™s â€œMasters of Warâ€ has already been receiving airplay on radio stations across the U.S., while his one chord free improvisational arrangement of the GrandMaster Flash song â€œThe Messageâ€
draws rave reviews wherever he plays.

In addition to eight powerful original songs, another standout track is lloydâ€™s version of the Son House classic â€œWalking Bluesâ€, which features Thayerâ€™s improvisational skills, as he explores classical Indian melodies which share so much common ground with Delta style blues of old.

Lloyd has recently opened shows for Johnny Winter, John Hammond, Harry Manx, Paul Rishell and Annie Raines and many others. After his opening sets, audiences are usually left shaking their heads and asking â€œWho ARE you?!â€ or â€œWhere have you been HIDING?!?â€ or â€œHow do you DO that??â€.

Endless hours of playing on street corners and subway platforms have honed his songs and skills the old fashioned way, one song, one note, one heartbeat at a time. With the release of BLUES FOR BOSTON, lloyd Thayer is sure to emerge from the underground, one song, one note, one heartbeat, one friend, at a time............
