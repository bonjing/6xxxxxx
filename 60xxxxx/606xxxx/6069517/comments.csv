[V],twentyforty,2010-12-28T20:38Z,"@banukaknight: I have uploaded ALL episodes of ALL seasons of Lie to Me. L2me is my regular show from the first episode.
But, you're right, all my torrents are ""dead"" by now. And - for worse - I cannot upload season-collections in months to come. Sorry."

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-29T09:30Z,"@skillet92: Even if whole idea guys from torrent-stats.info was good, these data is valid as TPB stats.
I KNOW how many finished downloads each torrent has (I can see amount of data transfered, how many times I have pressed Reset Totals and started from zero - they don't. Cannot. NONE of the public trackers I use doesn't function from 2007. even remotely reliable."
,skillet92,2010-12-29T19:06Z,"oh...sorry didnt know abt it!
i jus thought it would give ppl a better idea abt the correct number of seeds in the torrent!
Sorry!"

,racxie,2012-05-25T13:12Z,"For some reason it plays perfectly up until just after the title, then it starts having trouble decoding and runs into all sorts of problems such losing the audio and the video becoming all jittery/laggy.

I've tried playing it using VLC, K-Lite Codec Pack & on my 360, but the same happens with all three. Any ideas?"
