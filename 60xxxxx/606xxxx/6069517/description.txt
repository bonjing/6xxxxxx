Adam, a lonely man with Asperger's Syndrome, develops a relationship with his upstairs neighbor, Beth.

NOTE: I asked myself, regarding the release of my personal "Best Movie of 2010", 
             which one would I remember?
             Now you know.
             BTW, I said "my personal", have I?
             Do not look release date for theaters, I was guided by 
             release of my encodings (and appearance of DVD/BluRay/HDTV media).



     
             Happy New 2011.
