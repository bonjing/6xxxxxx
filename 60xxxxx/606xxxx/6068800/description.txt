Disillusioned charlatan Reverend Cotton Marcus (Patrick Fabian) comes face to face with pure evil after recruiting a documentary film crew to capture the final exorcism of his career. For years, Reverend Marcus has taken advantage of the faithful and desperate. Now it's time for him to finally come clean. Just as Reverend Marcus prepares to shoot the film that will set the record straight, he receives an urgent letter from a desperate farmer. The devil has taken possession of his beloved daughter Nell (Ashley Bell), and Reverend Marcus is their last hope for salvation. Up to this point it's been all fun and games; now things are about to get serious.
