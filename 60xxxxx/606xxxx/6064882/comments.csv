,MattandBri2008,2012-06-06T05:48Z,"@Shonnnyyy and anyone else who doesn't know how to download torrent files: you need to go to http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/complete?os=win (supposing you have Windows) to download uTorrent. Use uTorrent as your device for downloading torrent files. Also and very importantly, you need to download PeerBlock and have it running any time you're downloading from a file share site such as this. I've uploaded it and you can get it by going to http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7329555/Peerblock_Setup. I know it's been a while since this question was asked, but hopefully it helps anyone who is asking the same question."
