NOTES: For best performance I suggest you use KMPlayer(find it with google) for playback
These movies were made especially for PC and they don't play on a PS3.If you want to re-encode for PS3 or test for other devices be my guests.
I'll ask everybody to stop with the ''it doesn't work'',''it's out of sync'' comments because I tested the movies before I uploaded them and they work fine.
