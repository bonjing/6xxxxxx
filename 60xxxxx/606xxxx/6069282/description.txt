Beavis And Butthead Mike Judge Collection (1993-1997)

The show centers on two socially inept rock/metal-loving teenage boys, Beavis and Butt-head , who live in the town of Highland, Texas. They seem to have no adult supervision at home, are woefully undereducated, and are arguably a little dim-witted. Although they are teenagers, they are young enough that they are barely through puberty. They attend high school, where their teachers are often at a loss as to how to deal with them, although in many episodes the two skip school altogether. They occasionally work part-time at Burger World and sometimes other side-jobs when people mistake their odd behavior as outgoing and assertive.
