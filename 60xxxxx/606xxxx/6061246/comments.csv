,rlc9125,2010-12-23T21:17Z,How about YOU seed!  1 seeder and 50 peers and my dl speed is .02 and no there's not a damn thing wrong with my client.
,Lucy1948,2010-12-23T21:50Z,"I'm currently uploading some 15 torrents. There is only limited bandwidth available to me.

If you had bothered to share anything with the community (yes it is always those who share the least who moan the most) then you would know that it is not easy.

Now be patient. Or else go to Itunes and pay a fortune for this music!"

,whizkid8888,2011-12-28T04:23Z,"Nice torrent, but my only complaint - there's a LOT of redundancy.  I had to delete about two thirds of the torrent before I synced it to my iPod, so I didn't have four of the same song.  Nothing too big... just be aware you can't download it and put it straight on an mp3 player.  =)"
