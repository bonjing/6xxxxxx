,johnny-27,2011-11-09T14:33Z,"This game is just awesome. I don't remember from which torrent I dl'ed it (it wasn't this one) but I can highly recommend it!

So.... I've been playing it now for a while. I completed it a few times. I won all the trophies of all the mini-games, puzzles and survivals. I got the Golden Sunflower (yeah!!). I got 13 flags on Survival Endless. My Cash is 453,800 dollars. Crazy Dave's shop has nothing more to offer and my Tree Of Wisdom is 62 feet high and has finally run out of wisdom. Is there anything more to accomplish?? I'm gonna grow my tree to a hundred feet but I fear that this won't get me anywhere :-))

Cheers!"
,johnny-27,2011-11-11T15:30Z,"ok, my tree is 90 feet and there seems to be a supply-shortfall on fertilizer... I completed 20 flags of survival endless, how's that? :D
btw, what's your favorite plant? For me, it's the doom shroom! You better not fuck with a doom shroom! LOL"

,Tribellion,2012-01-04T16:12Z,"johnny-27, yes there is one more thing. Growing your tree of wisdom to 100 feet gets you a surprise. You can look it up in google if you don't believe me. Cheers!"
,Jan_Vat,2012-01-07T23:51Z,"Hey guys. I've been looking for this save file, I'd like to play this on another computer as well as hex edit so I can give myself a bit more cash. But I really can't seem to find it. It's not in the actual game folder. I've tried google and they say it should be user1.dat but there's no such file on my computer. Also tried my username but no luck.
I'm thinking because this is cracked and all that so it may not work the same way? Any ideas guys cos I'd really like to find my save game!! Thanks in advance"
