,ddanopia,2011-01-01T03:47Z,"Try downloading it, TPB does not serve you a file. It's probably a server-side fault. However the magnet link works, I am using that and already hit 0.05% ;)"

Get it now, while you can.
Please keep seeding for a few days after you complete so others can get it."

,timotay89,2011-09-17T06:33Z,"I started this a week ago and everything was fine.  Then literally overnight, everyone vanished.  No seeders and no leechers.  If someone could go back to seeding for a bit, that'd be awesome.  Then I can do it a bit myself after that."
,kev2011,2012-03-25T04:14Z,"TY. Amazing quality. Ill seed as often/long as i possibly can. Relatively fast DL, with the few seeders left."
