,crpearso,2010-12-29T00:59Z,"Hey HD-R-US, What program are you using to make these? Handbrake sucks ass.

I know it requires a BluRay disc drive in your PC which I have. Thanks"

,Kadoma,2010-12-29T06:43Z,"Again, you don't NEED a Bluray player to view these, as it says in the description, if you open up the ISO file, the movie is in the BDMV/STREAM folder, named ""00000.m2ts"". VLC can play this. "
,Kadoma,2010-12-29T06:45Z,"HD-R-US, thanks for the hard work! Any tips or a link to info on how to make Bluray player compatible iso files would be appreciated. "
,crpearso,2010-12-30T01:39Z,"I know you don't need a BluRay player. 

You need a BluRay Drive in your PC to read a bluray disc to make the ISO's he is making. I was asking what program he used to make the ISO's."
,pathless,2010-12-30T17:45Z,"Really enjoy these files, HD-R-US, always top notch a/v. I just have a couple questions.

1. Can these .iso images be burned to a disc for playing with Media Player Classic or do I need to extract them first?

2. Is there any chance we can get the Millennium Trilogy, cuz that would be sweet."
,Kadoma,2010-12-31T10:40Z,"@crpearso.
Got it. I misunderstood the first time around. "
