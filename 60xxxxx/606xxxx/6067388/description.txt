Killer of Sheep examines the black Los Angeles ghetto of Watts in the mid-1970s through the eyes of Stan, a sensitive dreamer who is growing detached and numb from the psychic toll of working at a slaughterhouse. Frustrated by money problems, he finds respite in moments of simple beauty: the warmth of a teacup against his cheek, slow dancing with his wife, holding his daughter. The film offers no solutions; it merely presents life â€” sometimes hauntingly bleak, sometimes filled with transcendent joy and gentle humor.

The film was shot in roughly a year of weekends on a budget of less than $10,000, paid for partially by a Louis B. Mayer grant of $3,000, and also out of the pocket of Burnett himself, who at the time was working at a small, boutique casting agency by the name of Chasin, Park & Citron. Shot on location with a mostly amateur cast, much handheld camera work, and an episodic narrative with gritty documentary-style cinematography, Killer of Sheep has been compared by film critics and scholars to Italian neorealist films like Vittorio De Sicaâ€™s Bicycle Thieves and Roberto Rosselliniâ€™s Paisan. Burnett cites Basil Wrightâ€™s Songs of Ceylon and Night Mail and Jean Renoirâ€™s The Southerner as his main influences.

The film stood apart from many of the more overtly political independents of the day in its understated simplicity. Burnett explains, â€œI come from a working-class environment and I wanted to express what the realities were. People were trying to get jobs, and once they found jobs they were fully concerned with keeping them. And they were confronted with other problems, with serious problems at home for example, which made things much more difficult.â€
