All known audio recordings from the ill-fated yet historic January, 1978 US tour.

1) Jan. 5th, Atlanta
2) Jan. 6th, Memphis ("Problems" is believed to have been played that night yet no recording has ever surfaced)
3) Jan. 8th, San Antonio
4) Jan. 9th, Baton Rouge
5) Jan. 10th, Dallas
6) Jan. 12th, Tulsa (only :64 seconds of "God Save The Queen" is known to exist from this show)
7) Jan. 14th, San Francisco

Please comment if you have better recordings. I can't believe no one's ever compiled this tour before. Cheers!
