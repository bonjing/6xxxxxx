PLOT:

Lewis Hicks (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a reporter and
journalist specializing in writing about the crime of
murder. Instead of writing his next story, Lewis becomes
the story when his new girlfriend is sadistically
murdered, and he is the only suspect. Lewis investigates
the murder himself and finds the killerâ€™s journal with
his past victims and a death list of his future prey.
Lewis believes that he is the only person who can stop
the killer before time runs out for his next victim.
