The very first episode!

"The Library of no Return, ep S01E01 of The Zack Files.


We get to know Zack, Cam and Gwendolyn Killerby, a great part by Katie Boland, who was then acting the pants of anybody. Amazing she never got an award for it.

Zack Greenburg gets in trouble. Paranormal sort of trouble ....
