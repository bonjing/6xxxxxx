Julia Bradbury follows in the footsteps of Alfred Wainwright in this wonderful series featuring stunning aerial footage. Using Wainwright's Pictorial Guides of the Lakeland Fells, Julia discovers the treasures of the Lake District.

We accompany Julia on four of Wainwright's 214 illustrated walks, as she climbs to the top of the legendary fell walker's final resting place, Haystacks; shimmies along Sharp Edge to reach the summit of Blencathra; absorbs the rugged beauty of Castle Crag; and takes on Wainwright's ultimate challenge, the tallest mountain in England, Scafell Pike.

Also featured is the compelling documentary Wainwright, The Man Who Loved The Lakes which interviews those who knew the legendary guide writer exploring the life of the eccentric Lancastrian.
