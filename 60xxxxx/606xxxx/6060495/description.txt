- Readme.txt (3 KB more or less, again :)


WHAT YOU NEED/HAVE BEFORE RUN? 
------------------------------
- For Vista/7 you only need a virtual drive prog (I recommend PowerISO), for mount the image and install.

- VISIT the Markus page http://www.markusegger.at/Software/Games.aspx AND READ VERY WELL ALL NOTES related. 

- You also can find detailed info (from MarkusEgger) on file "Instructions.html"

- YOU MUST HAVE a joystick/gamepad

- RECOMMENDED (x older OS): Get OEM CD-ROM/image to run the game AFTER setup and config 

- NOTE: Pilots files (.plt) from previous versions dont work with this.

-----------------------------------------------------

This version is based on:

  (mostly) by Markus Egger ("THE MAN", who made the installers/this possible) at his page:
