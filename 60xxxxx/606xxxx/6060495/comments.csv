,TienShen,2011-01-05T09:50Z,"THANKS A LOT!!! IT REALLY WORKS
Is there some way to change the graphic detail? BECAUSE every change I make IN-game seems to do nothing.  Still much better graphics than X-Wing. Maybe only with me. My final vote: 9.1/10 for the work of the uploader, for the game itself and because VADER RULES!"
,lukas205,2011-07-09T10:27Z,"I cant seem to install, When i click from the launcher, it just pauses and then goes away any idears people?"
,Tuzito,2011-07-13T02:45Z,"Lukas205, do you follow ALL the instructions as described? If so and you still having problems, post here and we solve it. BUT 1st READ CAREFULLY ALL THE STEPS."
,DarkSavage,2011-09-02T17:25Z,"Loved this game so much growing up, Thank you for giving it back to all of us!
The problem I'm having is the game launches correctly and I can register my pilot, but I launch a mission and within a few seconds it freezes and I have to shut my computer down and restart. Help please"
,Tuzito,2011-09-09T00:26Z,"DarkSavage: You probably need the update at http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/tie-xcs.html  YOU MUST Create your pilot before enter the game. If you have time download the Bonus Pack on my TPB page, here you foeund ALL the stuff, from the how to's crack, update, tweaking, activate 3-D, etc. Dont't go for the compatibility mode. Just change the options in-game. Hope this help."
,desharna,2011-10-03T22:14Z,"Game is working great except for the display on my monitor. Some of the sprites aren't the right color, and when I'm in a mission, the blackness of space appears yellow.

Any ideas out there? Thanks."
,Tuzito,2011-12-20T19:06Z,Try switching the 3D config in-game... and low the debris and planets level too... that should work
