I think I tried loading the Windows Activator when I first installed it, but it got an error and I just ignored it at the time, but now that I can't use any of the features, I really need to re-visit that error.  :D

,livingenzyme,2011-02-16T13:28Z,"Look, people, if you don't know that you have to deactivate your user control setting first before implimenting the activator, you shouldn't be doing this in the first place.  Go to the store and buy a genuine copy if you want to remain a regular user."
,pseye,2011-02-20T21:52Z,Does it have sp1 installed? Thank's for info.
,HerpesThisMonth,2011-02-21T23:22Z,"@ livingenzyme

First off, implying that people who are not computer savy shouldn't use this program make you completely ignorant.

And to the uploader of this torrent, it would be nice to put steps on how to use the activator properly for the people who don't know how.

I still have yet to get the activator to work and as such my operating system does nothing but load and say that my copy is not genuine."

,JayCo1337,2011-04-26T23:20Z,Computer-User. I respect what you do and hopefully you have a solution for me. I have downloaded the ISO. and Burned it using Active. But when I try to boot the CD.
