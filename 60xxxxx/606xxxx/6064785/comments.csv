Thank you for hours of pleasure.

[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-12-26T05:46Z,"Hey, The Ol'Faart.   You can't be that much of an old fart.   At least you've got the wisdom of Youth; you are savvy enough to love the Blues.   So drink the blues.   Someone commented the other day that you cannot drink the blues.   Did not have the heart to point out to the commenter that blues is actually more of an abstract noun as opposed to a concrete one...which means that theoritically one can drink the blues.   The commenter thought that he/she/it was intelligent...a tragic testimony to the theory of nothing not worth knowing can be taught.
   Guess what...?    I'm fuckin' drunk again.   Drunk on the Blues; 'cause I am, and always will be, drinking them."

.... and the 1st album I bought....?
Colosseum Live!"
[V],nightissuchproximity,2010-12-26T09:29Z,"Hey, GDaym8

I saw the Beatles live back in '63.   A now long since demolished Odeon cinema in Edinburgh, Scotland.   My mate was the caretaker there and he got me a backstage pass.   I stood in the wings while Lennon gave the definitive masterclass in how to sing rock 'n' roll.

Also saw the Stones being arrested in Edinburgh about the same year.    And later saw the Stones at Elland Road 'cause the first choice of venue...Wembley...was all sold-out.

And am ashamed to admit that the first album I ever bought was actually Val Doonican.   Yeah, ok...I was young...and lurking in the shadows of the real tragedy of youth."
,GDaym8,2010-12-28T02:22Z,"It was the jacket that sucked you in night!
That .. and the aspirations of youth.
Val was getting the women, after all.
Just not quite the same sort of women as Deep Purple or the Stones !!"
