,FatFreddy22,2010-12-24T03:32Z,"@bob1960  no you cant, because when you do, it detects you have a cracked password and username and it wont let you install the update."
,tommo39,2010-12-24T11:32Z,SO no new update signatures for 5YEARS!!!  get real mate
,jimto,2010-12-24T13:46Z,not able to update?
,omc1977,2010-12-24T14:57Z,Thanks for your efforts...but I have to agree with the others that if you cannot update the database this is fuckin useless. Better off to go to the sites available online with the keys. Download the trial from the website and enter the keys guys. This will also ensure you a clean copy of the program without any hidden bullshit. Been doing it this way for awhile now and it works like a charm. When the product key expires just go find another online.
,vanillasky79,2011-01-09T16:32Z,this is a fuckin shit.
,bestchamber,2011-01-10T12:30Z,no update???? damn. Useless Antivirus. Haha
,FatFreddy22,2011-01-11T00:10Z,"@Torrenters 
                        This antivirus is not shit... it has the virus log of December 2010, sure it may not protect from newer viruses, it will detect all others, out of millions of older viruses that are still high risk, would you rather have this? I WOULD! new viruses dont come out that often, maybe a little over 10 a year."
,LEERV,2011-09-02T02:36Z,".eXeElite - You stated that a little over 10 viruses a year come out, what are you some kind of moron? What a PRICK. Listen...The Anti-Virus Software companies employ people to create more complicated algorithms and spread said Viruses into Cyberspace...Then they charge Joe Public x amount of money to prevent them. TAKE A STEP INTO REALITY FRIEND!!!!! WAKE UP PEOPLE."
