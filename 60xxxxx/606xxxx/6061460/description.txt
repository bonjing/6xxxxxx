Amazon Review:
Chip Davis and Mannheim Steamroller's The Christmas Angel has been panned by several reviewers as being a sad rehash or unacknowledged greatest hits album. However, any true fan of Chip and the Steamroller knows that this CD is the soundtrack to a televised ice skating show that aired on NBC back in December of 1998 and will be airing again December 2000 on NBC (It may even become a Christmas tradition). The music, for the most part, is from previous Christmas recordings, but it has certainly not lost it's magic! The story, narrated by Chip and Olivia Newton-John, is a bit unusual, but makes more sense when watching the ice skating performance.

Allmusic Review:
Even though their music is easily enjoyable by listeners of all ages, Christmas Angel: A Family Story is the first album Mannheim Steamroller has made that is directly targeted at family audiences. Not that the music sounds that different -- it's still the Fresh Aire we have all grown to love -- but the music tells a story that should delight children and parents alike.
