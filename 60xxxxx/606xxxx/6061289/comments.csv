,Vikingman1111,2011-12-28T23:18Z,"This sharply told story is similar to The French Lieutenants Woman"" in the sense of a modern fable based on the mores and styles of the great Victorian novels. Donki just doesn't know, and that is his loss. As a film, it is very close to the story, but I think the writer had a better grip on the point of it all: emotional and physical freedom vs conformity of behavior and ignorance of spirit. "
