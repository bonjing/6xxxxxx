[V],globeplus,2010-12-27T17:38Z,"The game can be used anywhere on the computer and have a nice menu interface for the 4 episodes from the ODDBOXX .

enjoy ..."
,minus111,2010-12-27T20:31Z,"globeplus,thanks for this upload and the ones in you have done in the past.
I had a small request that,if you could upload call of dutys all games or atleast 2 and 3,i wana play it again."
[V],globeplus,2010-12-27T20:59Z,To minus111 : this game is an exception from more old games and with 6 and now the 7 (black ops) from that nice series i don´t really understand why you want to repeat 2 and 3 but even respecting that try to find torrents for that ones . 
,mrsam1999,2010-12-28T04:08Z,"Hi Globeplus..thanx for this game and many others that i have downloaded from u..I have a request; could u please find, rip and download the old 90's PC game 'Trash-it' ? It used to run on DOS and was so addictive !!"
[V],globeplus,2010-12-28T12:08Z,"To mrsam1999 : i am shore that maybe you can find that one somewhere to download , i have plenty of work for the moment that you never believe it but anyway it was a real pleasure spend close 12 hours working this file , getting the game clean in more than 4 giga less and absolute complete with a nice interface for any of the episodes , it was a long work but worthy .

Happy gaming !!!"
,minus111,2010-12-28T12:35Z,Thank you very much for your reply! :)
,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-29T10:31Z,"needs more seeds i think but i will comment for the curious about it's working or no... great games, have been hopeing to see them here, can't beleive you got it to 1.9gig"
,soldierofthelam,2010-12-29T14:36Z,"horrible rip
video is terrible, in strangers wrath it freezes up right at the beginning.
download the skid row version, then you can use the Oddworld.com patch for it to play right.
good effort globe but this one is just plain horrible

video 4/10
game freezes-strangers wrath
main launch buttons don't line up in munch or Abes oddysee and exoddus.

,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-30T05:29Z,"well i won't be seeding this, good try globe@, but not enough seeders and game is a bit slow... or maybe it freeze didn't have patience to find out"
,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-31T00:56Z,i decide to give one more try if you open the file on some games (abe's oddysee/exodus that i've tried so far) you can play game better than with autorun.exe
,calilsolis,2011-01-01T21:18Z,"abbes exoddus: ok
abbes oddysse: black screen and ctd
munchs oddysse: randoms ctd’s
stranger’s wrath: ctd after push “start game”

,RooJo434,2011-01-16T16:44Z,"thank you for this, i don't care if it'll be glitchy or laggy this is a decent size rip for all four games well done globe"
,RooJo434,2011-01-16T22:18Z,"how did you get oddworld stranger's wrath to work globe coz when i run it there's just a black screen and sound (windows 7)

does this work better with vista?

how can you get stanger's wrath working?

i would be extremely grateful
and thanks for this globe"
,pratik911,2011-01-23T19:05Z,"Pls globeplus, could you rip dead space 2. Really loved the first one. Can't wait to play this one."
,wogsta100,2011-02-07T09:22Z,"Thanks A Heap.
Also Everytime I Play Munchs Oddesey Is Crashes After 10 Minutes.
Any Answers to Fix It?
Thanks All Apreciated"
,BeatUpTorrent,2011-03-08T15:33Z,"All games in this RIP work fine, exept for ""Munch's Oddysee"" I had to patch it up.

Yet, I still have a question.

Is there a way to change the controls? Did anyone managed to do that?"
,Yenrock7,2011-04-02T09:54Z,We love all of your works globeplus!!
,crazy-about-freddie,2011-04-25T09:49Z,What was ripped?
,Wixmef,2011-07-27T13:09Z,"I've only tried Stranger's Wrath because that was the game I wanted to play the most (already got exoddus and oddysee). Well, I could get to the part where you go into first person for the first time and there it just went nuts and I couldn't see anything.

Guess I'll try out Munch's Oddysee now then."
,Wixmef,2011-07-28T14:35Z,"After playing Munch's Oddysee for like 3 minutes it crashes, all the time, shit torrent, also video quality sucks."
