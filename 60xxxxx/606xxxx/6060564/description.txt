Past Masters is a compilation album series by The Beatles released in 1988 - the initial two volumes were released on 7 March 1988 on separate CDs and a double collection two-record set followed on 24 October 1988 in the United States and 10 November 1988 in the United Kingdom. When The Beatles' albums were first released on Compact Disc, this series was put together so that The Beatles' entire catalogue of released work would be available on CD. None of these songs (in the versions included on this album) are found on any of The Beatles' original non-compilation albums released in the United Kingdom up to 1970.
