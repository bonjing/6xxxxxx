The original upload stopped uploading. I did a force recheck and it was only 99.9% so  I remade and uploaded the new torrent here. Old link(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6031462/NORTH-TO_ALASKA_DL_Custom_Split_To_2_DVD5_Discs). Don't know what happened. Hope this fixes the problem. Am running both torrnts. Currently shows seeding O.K.
