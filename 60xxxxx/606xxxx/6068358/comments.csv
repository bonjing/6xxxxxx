[T],reactor90,2010-12-28T00:16Z,looks like MP3 and looks like a very high bitrate if bothered to look at the torrents contents.
[T],MARCELODRGZ,2010-12-28T05:14Z,"Had bothered to put a little more info, no? ... anyway it should sound good if in 320 or 256. Whatever ... Thank you for sharing anonymous and thanks for your excellent observation Reactor90!"
