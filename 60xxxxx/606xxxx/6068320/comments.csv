Note: This rip is lacking subtitles/narration for the speeches of the germans and french civilians, so their speeches are a total miss, also it's missing the famous ambush by Michael Wittman."
,Hojew,2011-01-03T20:48Z,I don't think it's that the series lacks subtitles.  I think the release group just overzealousy cropped the original broadcast and the subtitles are simply cropped out.  You can see that it's been very cropped because only part of the Discovery World watermark is visible in these rips.
