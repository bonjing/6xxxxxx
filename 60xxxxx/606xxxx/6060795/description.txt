 Album Info..: 
 
 New Musical Express (12/24/94, p.23) - Ranked #5 in NME's list of the 10 best 
 compilation albums of 1994. Rolling Stone (1/26/95, pp.59-60) - 4 Stars - Excellent -  "...the set best serves as a reminder of the Beatles' multiple gifts....It captures the last possible moment when playing rock & roll could be unadulterated fun..." 
 Musician (3/95, p.88) - "...proof that the range and clarity of The Beatles' sound was the result of years spent covering the great R&B and rockabilly hits of the '50s..." New Musical Express (12/3/94, p.41) - 9 - Excellent Plus - "...this is the motherlode, the ore from which [the Beatles'] future art was smelted. No pop band would ever have such a rich source of fresh material to work from..." Q Magazine (1/95, pp.266-267) - 3 Stars - Good - "...on the cusp between their influences and their innovations....The Beatles were not important because they played such a storming version of 'Johnny B. Goode,' but...because they found a way of transcending 'Johnny B. Goode' altogether..." Entertainment Weekly (12/9/94, pp.74-75) - "...a reminder that the Beatles made an indelible mark as songwriters, record makers, and personalities....a quaint memento of a time that sounds more innocent than its  mythology now dictates..."
