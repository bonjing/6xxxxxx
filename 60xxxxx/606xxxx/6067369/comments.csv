,richardpa,2010-12-27T23:49Z,"Decent TELESYNC copy and a steady download...
A/6
V/7
There's a few focus and flickering problems with the picture and the audio jumps in and out of sync in a few places. 
All in all not a bad copy, If your not wanting to wait for DVDRip then this copy might be the one for you...
Many Thanx to heist for the rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a steady download...:)"

,billyboy999,2010-12-28T07:17Z,"And the award goes to ....@665w4w2d for being the millionth clown to say the phrase ""If you don't like it go to the theatre and watch it ""(I fixed your shitty spelling by the way) .....I HATE that shit man!!! If I wanted to go and spend 20 notes at the cinema on this or any other movie then I wouldn't be on here trying to illegally D/L them!!!"

,grranimal677,2010-12-29T02:46Z,"BillyBoy999: If you are going to criticize someone for something like spelling (it bugs me too but it's petty at best), at least make sure you're correct.  ""Theater"" is actually the preferred spelling of that word in the US, and acceptable English anywhere. I'm sure someone as smart as you can figure out how to google if you don't want to take my word for it.   Or don't, the irony of calling someone's spelling ""shitty"" when your own lack of spelling knowledge is glaring makes your shitty comment good for a laugh. "
,felesar2,2010-12-29T16:07Z,"Sorry uploader, but I'm with the spamming shithead above me, I'm going to see it at yourspamwebsitesucksmyass dot com

Fucking spamming morons, jhc...
This is a decent TS. There are worse out there. This is completely watchable. Normally not a fan of heist torrents, as I stick to the usual trusted sources, but this one made me come try 'em out. Glad I did."
,glassjaw2,2010-12-29T16:34Z,actually grranimal677you are the on who is wrong theatre is how we brits spell it in england and being that it is our language so if YOU are going to correct someone why not make sure YOU have your information correct

,winami3,2011-01-12T17:41Z,"Quality of video & audio is so bad, I had to delete it."
,theoangelo,2011-01-17T02:32Z,"shut the fuck up you morones, it's not a Hemingway screenplay allright?! it's not directed by Terrence Malick or Michael Haneke, Sven Nykvist didn't do the cinematography on this one OK? it's a fuckin shit comedy, good for laughs, so jus' watch like that and quit your fuckin' moaning you bunch of twats.

Greattings from Chile. thnx uploader."
,liljuarez_boi,2011-04-04T23:54Z,billyboy999 well then stop fucking complaining about how bad videos are if you arent going to pay for them. Free doesnt = best quality.
