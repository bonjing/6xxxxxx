Worked like a charm on Win7 (32-bit), for an old Epson Perfection 1250 Scanner. No current drivers/software available from Epson (don't ya just love 'em?), now it runs great â€” so thanks again :-)"

,UsedDildo,2011-05-01T10:44Z,"I just took a punt and installed this on my Win7 x64 using my old 2000-model Agfa SnapScan e50 and blow me, the fuckin' thing works perfectly! Wow! Thanks uploader."
,vivatpb5776,2011-08-12T13:54Z,Downloaded quickly. Installed seamlessly. Works perfectly. Thank you uploader.
,vivatpb5776,2011-08-20T16:43Z,"The only problem I have noticed is when saving the file as a .pdf, the application has to be closed in order to move or rename the newly created .pdf. Annoyance? yes...but definitely not enough of an annoyance to justify uninstalling the software."
,vivatpb5776,2011-08-20T16:46Z,"Amendment to last comment...

Make sure you click ""Last Page"" when finished scanning a document you saved as a .pdf. This will release the file and allow you to rename and/or move the file."
,didi286,2011-09-30T19:38Z,"Worked for an ancient Canon Canoscan LiDE 30, Windows Vista 64-bit; no driver available from manufacturer.  Screw planned obsolescence -- this works perfectly!  Thank you SO much."
