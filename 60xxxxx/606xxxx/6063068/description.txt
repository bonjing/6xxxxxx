Why wait till January 9 to see the first 2 episodes of Californication?

In the fine tradtition of Showtime programming getting leaked 
over 2 weeks before the next season begins, it's happened again!

I'm surprised nobody else posted these yet, so for once I'll get 
to post something NEW for a change and in this case maybe even 
be first on this and one other torrent site I use.

But it's up to you guys to keep this well-seeded, and that way 
tomorrow I can upload the next episode. The only reason I'm 
not doing both in one torrent, is because my upload bandwidth 
is limited and I'm expecting a massive turnout.

These were done by someone whose wife works for the cable company,
and are from their Showtime promo DVD that she got to take home.
Her husband did the encoding, which is why this file is so large 
(the next is even larger at over 500 MB) but the video quality is excellent.

The theme this year is Hank is estranged from both his wife and 
daughter (yet again) because of his behavior, and it's no secret 
that he's going to trial on criminial charges of statutory rape. 
This going to be one hell of a season!
