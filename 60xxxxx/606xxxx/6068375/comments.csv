,mernay,2011-01-03T05:33Z,"Nice attempt, but the application force closes after every single thing you try to do (add files - force close. Burn - force close). It also makes all DVDs unrecognizable by any other software (DVD Cloner, Windows Media Player, etc). Must overwrite some sort of driver.  "
,4lp5,2011-01-05T22:58Z,"Installed, working fine..

Just a small note, the installed version is: 10.2.11000.12.100 and not the one which it shows on the title."

,sbmkd,2011-03-19T23:01Z,"Was going to download this because my trial ran out. Then I just put in the serial posted by iamutham into my trial and it registered fine. Just block IT and the separate update app that comes with it via your firewall and you should be fine. And don't click update (derp).

And like I said, I didn't download this so I have no idea if it works or not. If you don't want to risk it, just go to the nero website and download their trial."
