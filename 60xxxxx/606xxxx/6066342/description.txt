This book is about the Ubuntu Operating System and is the book that helped me get free from Closed Software and embrace true computing freedom.  It's simple enough for a n00b to understand and is an excellent reference.  I've paid for the hard copy since I like to have tangible copies I can read if I crash my system and need some help and I cannot recommend this book enough.

The Ubuntu Pocket Guide And Reference was written by Keir Thomas and is available free at ubuntupocketguide.com

I included a text file with the text from ubuntupocketguide.com/legal.html as it appears today (December 26th 2010) as I upload it.  I do this simply because I am by nature a paranoid person when it comes to file sharing.  Though I'm not concerned about Keir Thomas suing me I'm not very trusting of anyone who he might sell the rights to down the road.

I'm uploading this in hopes of preserving it for future generations if for some reason Keir takes down his website for the book be it for financial reasons or otherwise.  This book helped me so much I wanted to share it.  It's also my first torrent upload so be kind :-)
