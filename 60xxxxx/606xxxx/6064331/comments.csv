,AcePredator,2011-01-10T19:11Z,"Thanks so much for uploading these Jeopardy episodes. I've been a fan of the show since it returned with Alex Trebek, but I've lived in foreign countries for 16 of the last 17 years. I've followed the show the best I could during that time, but I haven't been able to actually watch it until now. I really appreciate the effort you're making and will seed the shows I download continuously to help out others. Thanks again so much."
