A.Warning.to.the.Curious.1972.FS.H264.mp4	231.7 MB

--- This is an unparalleled piece of British eeriness. Filmed on location at some lonely piece of coastline in East Anglia "A Warning to the Curious" is based on one of respected ghost story author M R James stories. It concerns a legend regarding three buried crowns of angle-sea. The main character goes searching for one of these (hes a historian or something) and wakes up the nasty (and very scary) ghoul of William Ager the crowns protector. Cue very sinister yet never obvious happenings and a creepy ending. This is part of a superb series of MR James ghost stories serialized by the BBC and is well worth seeking out.

---Waited for four days for repeated airing, first one was bad and ugly
but that haven't happened... and decided to up this one (480p was
encoded, but I consider these 30 MB difference as a waste - 'cause airing
was criminally low in quality.
