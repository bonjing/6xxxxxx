I can send you a .dlc container for jdownloader as e-mail attachment and you can choose the movies and the pace of download.  //

OK. But could you elaborate on that? I have no idea what it is.

Also, any suggestions for a good comedy series (sitcoms)?
Nothing on the lines of Arrested development or The office please.

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-23T16:52Z,"@strmppl: jdownloader is a program for automatized download of the files from file-sharing servers. .dlc is a file he can use and where links in encrypted form are stored.
It is a must have. Just do Google - write down in Search bar a word jdownloader. It is free, well known program and used by millions for years.

Do the same on Youtube, many tutorials in many languages is available there - if your connection is too slow to watch them on-line, use Firefox browser and Download Helper extension for browser and save those video-guides for off-line watching."

I'm curious about any human heart and
A warning to the curious.
Hope things are good for you
:-)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-24T10:29Z,"Thank you.

@valu59er: I wish that you more frequently write your comments. I am sick worried about some of you, especially now when lilars is gone.

@all: ""Thanks"" is not just a matter of my own vanity, nor can substitute a true gratitude - but it is a written confirmation ""I am right here"" from many of you I know for years. We never met eachother, but it gives me (and to you guys) some sense of community and belonging to something bigger."
