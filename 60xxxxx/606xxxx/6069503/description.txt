Flash Builder and Flash Catalyst: The New Workflow 

The Flash Platform is changing. Flash Builder and Flash Catalyst have brought a new separation of design and coding to web development that enables a much more efficient and streamlined workflow. For designers and developers used to the close confines of Flash, this is a hugely liberating but at first alien concept. This book teaches you the new workflow for the Flash platform. It gives an overview of the technologies involved and provides you with real-world project examples and best-practice guidelines to get from design to implementation with the tools at hand.

Who this book is for?

This book is intended for people that want to understand how design and development are brought closer together with Flash Catalyst and Flash Builder 4. Although it can be quite helpful to already have some basic knowledge of Flex, the book will provide you with an overview of the main features and lots of coding examples that are explained in detail.
