BAD BOY
Label Wolf
Orig Year 1993
Format:Flac


The Delta-rooted mid-'50s Vee-Jay label classics by perennially underrated Chicago guitarist Eddie Taylor, who stepped out of Jimmy Reed's shadow long enough to leave behind "Bad Boy," "Big Town Playboy," "Ride 'Em on Down," the bouncy "I'm Gonna Love You," and several more brilliant sides. Fifteen songs in all, including five from 1964 that are scarcely less impressive than his previous stuff. ~ Bill Dahl

Personnel: Eddie Taylor (vocals, acoustic, electric & slide guitar); Vera Taylor (vocals); Johnny B. Moore (guitar); Larry Taylor (acoustic guitar, drums); Willie Kent (bass); Tim Taylor (drums[
