Recorded in 2004 at the Blue Note in New York, Out of Nowhere finds James Carter
paired up with fellow Detroiters Gerard Gibbs on organ and Leonard King on drums
for the unofficial sequel to Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge. While the trio
revitalizes the standard "Out of Nowhere" and breezes through Benny Golson's
jazz classic "Along Came Betty," the fireworks really get under way on
"Highjack." The tune signals the fervent arrival of its composer, guitarist
James Blood Ulmer, and by the conclusion the quartet is joined by fiery
multi-saxophonist Hamiett Bluiett. Carter and Bluiett then take center stage for
a baritone sax duet on "Song for Camile," Bluiett's beautiful ballad initially
recorded with the World Saxophone Quartet, of which he is a member, on their
organ-drenched 1995 date Breath of Life. Ulmer directs the proceedings through
Chicago blues territory with a quick and loose "Little Red Rooster," which leads
into R. Kelly's 1996 pop hit "I Believe I Can Fly." Now, before indifference
gets the best of you, in the hands of these musicians the tune receives a quick
conversion from ballad into a quasi-Latin groove, through burning funk -- in
which Gibbs absolutely shines -- and finally the reeds irreverently take it out
honking and squawking in a manner that would have made Lester Bowie smile. Like
its predecessor, Live at Baker's Keyboard Lounge, Out of Nowhere provides an
admirable cornucopia of modern jazz from Carter and friends.
