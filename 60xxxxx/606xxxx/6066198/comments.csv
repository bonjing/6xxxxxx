,hairyassapeman,2010-12-27T00:00Z,This is like the holy grail for Railworks players. Thanks!
,D4rkH3art,2010-12-29T21:14Z,1 seeder and 217 leechers?  At least share instead of doing a hit and run.
,Railgamelover,2010-12-29T21:50Z,"I think not many people has already download the full 100%, so far as I can see, more than 60 people are already over the 90%, so if they are a 100% there are a lot more of seeders."
,saunj008,2010-12-30T13:24Z,"First of all thanks for uploading! Having problems with a few of the add ons, With the west coast mainline add on, everytime i load a scenario it comes up with the error consistbuilder - unable to load rail vehicle - class 86, it also says this for the mk3 coaches. The track is also missing on this route! having this unable to load rail vehcile with a few other addons too. I have followed the installation intructions and deleted blueprints, so im not sure why it does this. I have railworks 2 on steam. Could anyone help? thanks!"
,Railgamelover,2010-12-30T13:50Z,"It look likes the class 86 and mk3 Assets aren't installed properly. Try to reinstall the WCML and be sure to overwrite all existing files. Also the missing track look likes a file missing problem. 
Have you disabled the automatic update of Railworks in steam? Maybe that overwrite the WCML files."
,saunj008,2010-12-30T16:09Z,"ive tried what you said, but unfortunately it wont work! :(. With the A4 LNER pack, the engine dosent make any sound, and the drivers are standing on the chimney of the engine! Nevermind i guess, quite a lot of the add ons are working for me, plenty to play with!"
,supersteve2345,2010-12-31T00:16Z,Thanks for the upload mate. I can't use the 02 or 08 class if I click drive by train only buy drive by route is it meant to be like that? Or did I do something wrong
,Railgamelover,2010-12-31T14:29Z,"@velvetpliers: That's exactly the reason why I've made this torrent, many add-ons are to expensive for what you get. I think in a few months there is coming a part 2 of this torrent with all that wasn't in this torrent or has released recently.

@supersteve2345: Some loco's don't show up in the ""drive by train"" list indeed, there's nothing wrong at your side. It's because some older add-ons hasn't locomotive information included so Railworks doesn't now which locomotive is in a scenario."

,Railgamelover,2011-01-03T08:30Z,Class 380 is in the torrent! ;)
,hunnicuddler,2011-01-03T19:56Z,"Yes, I found it.. ta! found out why WCML North was crashing.. too higher setting for scenery or something.. no railway stations, but once that was set low it worked, but once out of Scotland the scenery was ok.."
,arob1292,2011-01-11T17:04Z,"railgamelover, a few of the add ons don't show up in the object filter list in railworks therefore not being able to use them but they are installed. how do we fix this? it seems it is only happening with the RSC add ons as all the just trains and armstrong powerhouse add ons work. Hope you can help.. many thanks "
,Railgamelover,2011-01-11T22:36Z,"Are you using a legal (Steam) version of RailWorks? If so, disabled the check on startup for RailWorks and disabled automatic updates in Steam.
You've checked all the RSC boxes in the Developers list?"
,arob1292,2011-01-12T03:27Z,"thanks for your response
yeah i am using a legal version. I tried disabling automatic updates but nothing and how do you disable check on start up?

yeah some of the assets show up in game on the developer list on the right in the editor but do not appear on the left list where you can place them on the track if you get me (yes i ticked the boxes aha)"
,arob1292,2011-01-12T16:15Z,i just got it to work by installing skidrows railworks 2 but I would like it to work on my legit copy :/ shame
,Railgamelover,2011-01-12T18:13Z,"I think it's because Steam checks on every startup all the RSDL and RSC assets and if they arn't original they are replaces by originals. 
Becaus I don't use Steam myself I don't now much about it, but try to play in the ""Offline mode""."
,arob1292,2011-01-12T18:54Z,I've searched all over steam and I can't find out how to put it into offline mode but I guess a quick google would give me the answer. May just copy the skidrow crack which has steam files and then just click the railworks icon instead of loading steam and see what happens

Did you happen to come over this problem.

The wagons in Canadian Rail and AP2 (intercity) are  screeching and is very annoying, and I am pretty sure that's not how it's suppose to be. 

However the Canadian Rail Wide Nose all the wagons are fine.

To install I have unpacked all the rar's, then selected all the .pak .rwp and installed them, then I just copied all the files from assents; contents; Inputmappers; JustTrains, etc, over.

I have a youtube link but they don't seem to allow it."
,Messerschmitt,2011-04-07T18:09Z,"Oh, I have a thread open in steam forums under Railworks, the youtube videos are available there. The title is screeching sound.

Thank you very much"
,Messerschmitt,2011-04-08T07:28Z,"Oh, never mind, I re-installed it and I guess I will be installing 1 by 1 instead of all at once to identify easier if one of the packs screws something up.

If anyone knows which packs screws the sound please let me know.

Also, wanted to mention how much I appreciate Railgamelover, for your upload, and I noticed this is not the first pack.

Looking forward for the future addon and want to thank you in advance! Really really appreciate it for giving us this. Railworks is 100x better with all these addons."

,analjuggern4ut,2011-07-19T14:34Z,"Sir, thank you so much for this and your other great uploads. They are most welcome. However, I have a minor problem with ""Newcastle to York - Modern"" route. It is missing some critical files, because of which the Pendolino scenario does not work. It complains that the following rolling stock are missing:

- 37-042 EWS
- JT RES Mk1 BG (faded)
- Intercity Swallow 47973

On the product page

http://www.fspilotshop.com/product_info.php?currency=MXN&manufacturers_id=342&products_id=2882

it is told that the route should include the following repaints:

    HST: Great North Eastern Railway GNER (blue with red stripe)
    HST: National Express East Coast NXEC (blue with white stripe - transitional livery)
    HST: National Express East Coast NXEC (grey/white - current livery)
    HST: Cross Country (silver/pink/brown mauve - current livery)
    Rail Express Systems RES 47 and Mk1 coaches (faded/weathered)

It seems that at least the last one is missing from your upload. I was able to install the missing Intercity Swallow 47973 from another upload and 37-042 EWS from UKTrainSim, but cannot find ""JT RES Mk1 BG (faded)"" anywhere. It would be great if you could include that in your next upload. Thank you once more and keep up the good work, it really is appreciated!"

,dukekrieg,2012-01-28T22:13Z,"I torrented Railworks 3 and I just finished torrenting, I tried everything, extracted files and installed the packages. When I get into the game, however, they just don't show up! No error messages, no glitches, just doesn't seem to exist... Anyone got a fix? Does this torrent even work on the new version?"
,dukekrieg,2012-01-30T22:36Z,"@Railgamelover is there anyway to fix the error where it says: ""Error: Vehicles failed to load."" ?"
,Dirrrrt,2012-03-22T15:37Z,"@ Railgamelover

Do these add-ons work for Railworks 3?
Because I have a problem to find the install directory of the legal game."
