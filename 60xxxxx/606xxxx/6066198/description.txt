RailWorks Add-ons 2011
Over 125 RailWorks Add-ons!                                                  

Here a new version of the RailWorks Add-on pack, this time much more Add-ons (see list) and easier to install, no more password protected *.rar files or something else. All Add-ons are tested by me personally with RailWorks2 v114.1b an works great! If you want to download RailWorks, I advise you to download the "RailWorks.2-SKIDROW" torrent here on the TPB which is version v114.0b and update it with the upgrade in this torrent (v114.0b_to_v114.1b.rar), that works fine for me. It's possible that the files also works with an older version of RailWorks or even with RailSimulator, but I hasnâ€™t test that so I can't guarantee anything. Of course these Add-ons works also on a legal version of RailWorks, but please note that every time Steam updates RailWorks the Assets that comes with RailWorks will be overwritten! Have fun with it!

How to install?
At first extract the *.rar file with WinRar or something else, then there are two options:
-   *.rar file contains a *.rwp file; Install this using the Package Manager in Railworks by pressing "Install" in the "Package Manager" tab and select the extracted *.rwp file, RailWorks will install the Assets now, if ask overwrite existing Assets.
-   *.rar file contains "Assets" and/or "Content" and/or some other folders; copy the folders to the main folder of RailWorks for example "C:\Program Files\RailSimulator.com\RailWorks 2", if ask overwrite existing folders and files.
Now you can use the installed Add-on in RailWorks, sometimes it's needed that you delete all "Blueprint.pak" files in the subfolders of the "Assets" directory to show up the installed Add-ons!

Note: With some files there is an Readme.txt enclosed, please read that file carefully for installation instructions!
