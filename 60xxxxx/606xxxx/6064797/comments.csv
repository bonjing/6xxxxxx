,muthineni,2010-12-25T20:20Z,"gonna skip this ..but thank you.
got another version before u announced...
Actually movie is not just a comedy..it get much serious as story progresses.
and waiting for atonement yaar.. heard so much about it. 1gig should be perfect."
[T],MitZep,2010-12-25T20:25Z,"hey so nw yuv started uploading 480p also
hw much of a quality difference is there between 480p and 720p?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-25T20:56Z,"@frapper,prank,jarman,himansu
welcome..

@animefann
no i did said before it is himansus request..u must nt hv started downloading my torrents at that time i think...

@mitzep
jarman asked the same question
check this
"""" if u use KMplayer then open the movie right click go to pan&scan -> presets -> zoom to ultra widescreen...

if u use media playerclassic then go to view -> pan&scan -> zoom to ultra widescreen...""

do the same with any of my 720p's in which i hv used 750-800kbps video bitrate....
u'll see that this will look a little bit better...when bit rate is too low for 720p then it flickers(like tubelight u can say..u'll see it mostly in movement scenes, very light movement scenes too like when someone moves his head here and there)....i hv realized this now...thats why i hv started using high bitrate for 720p's...atleast this high so that it may nt flicker..."""
,akindayimcan,2010-12-25T20:58Z,"thanks for this upload bro

[T],MitZep,2010-12-25T21:19Z,"hey thanx for the reply
just one more question
(hope yur not irritated by my constant questioning)
for encoding 720p is it better to encode from a 4gb 720p or a 8gb 1080p
in other words is 720p to 720p better or 1080pto 720p is better? "
,_Dux,2010-12-26T02:39Z,"I like the switch to 480p, as I said, Cyrus in 480p looks amazing even on my 24""!

Is there any chance that Buried will be like this one or The American (480p, 700MB)? Sorry if I bother you mate..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-26T06:28Z,"@akind
Welcome...don't be sad its life..

@mitzep
Bigger the source better the result...8gb 1080p better than 4gb 720p..

@dux
Buried--a 720p 1.10gb

@all
No more off topic comments from now on..they just ruin my page...u all hv seen that...u can just say thanks if u want to...
I won't be replying to any off topic comments..."
,DSIN,2010-12-26T07:45Z,"Gr8 movie.. was already in my ""to dload list""
thanx..
dloaded the sample.. A/V - 10/10.. looks better than 720 of same size :)
P.s : looks better in ultra wide screen mode :D"
,apple016,2010-12-26T14:34Z,"OFF TOPIC
woow i missed lots of hot conversation .dang lol
but 'DSIN' i did'nt expect that thing from you. u are the one who said respect every uploader's work. but what happened to that mate??. well diff. people diff. taste i think u will agree with me.
AND dude i dnt like u r comment in which u said some thing like that 'there is no need to lick uploader's feet'. no one is licking no one's feet. its what we called respect not licking or say begging. NO Offense.
but i agree avatar is good movie with bad script.
and godfather is good cant deny.
but in last you guys patched up like decent persons.DSIN your request and suggestion abt movies was very useful to us .so keep commenting if prashant allows you(becoz i dnt knw abt that)
becoz of goku, you, and few other guys i haven't req. any movie yet.
Becoz i get every good movie without requesting.
AND yea  as 'muthineni' said prashant u r good and have patient. i must add u r good as human-being and DSIN you too but i think you are naughty guy.
as i said earlier 
 'I assume we all are frdz here ,frndz fight ,like,love,patch up,with each other .thats what i called understanding. its very good you both are frnds again(i hope this is ryt).
@prashant+@DSIN=just dnt fyt again ,lol.otherwise i'll tell to your mommy and make her to punish you guys lol. 
sorry for long comment prashant ,cant resists my self.

ABOUT MOVIE
haven't DL yet comment after DLing."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-26T15:26Z,"@apple
dude its ok...bt plz dont comment abt this topic anymore because discussions never end...so lets put a fullstop now to this topic...

@all
i said that no more off topics..bt u can ask me abt encoding problems if u hv some...
mainly this off topic thing is abt dont post comments on what movie u like or what movie u hate because it offends some or the other....

and lastly first of all no offence DSIN...if u remember i said i help my frnds...i was trying to help u too bt u missunderstood completly...believe it or nt bt u get frustrated if someone says ur choice bad...and so do me and so do others...
although i juste played a bit with u nt for fun just to make u understand that u should nt use words like u used while replying to mzk ""no one gives a damn abt ur bloody openion"" and sort of things which u said....
i said played because thing is i hv nt watched godfather yet i said it bad n boaring just to tease u...so that u may realize now u should know what....
bt that play turned into a fight sort of thing which in the first place i dont wanted nd i lost my cool too used words which i shouldnt hv used as i dont even know u...
and yes i like ur movie taste u know that very well..bt ""u should respect others taste too""..this was the only thing which i was trying to make u understand....
and i dont think anyone here will say what u said""my movie taste is bad""..although i still fell u were trying to tease me too..
i m a fan of every genre..nt just romance..my uploads tell that...

i thought of nt writing this bt after reading apple's comment i also couldnt control myself..

and lastly i think after reading so many good comments abt godfather i should watch it..;)
akind requested it too bt as it is too long so it would take too much time for me to encode it so i didnt accepted it...
bt may be as i hv learnd abt the 720p 480p thing i may do 480p's of it..480p's take half time to encode.."
,jarman007,2010-12-26T16:12Z,it would be great  if you could do godfather.......happy to hear that
,DSIN,2010-12-26T16:20Z,"^ u r right abt the teasing thing... ur movie taste is good .. & yeah i got carried away too :-/
but u haven't watched Godfather??? how can u do that ...?? (rhetorical Questions)  just 1 suggestion.. wen u do watch it.. don't expect too much.. then u'll surely love it :D

@all : check this uploader out.. http://thepiratebay.org/user/Herakler/
good 720p quality uploader in 700megs :)

@prashant : i think u included Back to the future trio in  ""great LIST""... herakler just uploaded that... so r u still goin to do it? or will skip them & include some of those movies which were requested back then& were left out ? :)"
,muthineni,2010-12-26T16:25Z,"480p should do just fine...
actually 720p is not necessary for godfather coz the makers used a kind of dark feel to the whole movie. even the colors r different. . a lot of discussion went into that apparantly.
http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film2/DVDReviews41/godfather_coppola_restoration_blu-ray.htm
u should do one and two sometimes.. three is not in the league"

[V],prashant22,2010-12-26T17:39Z,"@J007,muthineni
ya will see..may be first 2 if 3rd is nt good..

@DSIN
ya i saw he uploaded that...so may be i'll skip it bt its just may be...
the list i made well i said i will choose only 15 bt i included more than that there was all movies which seemed good and whose sources were available...the once which were left out were nt good or sources were nt available if good...

there is no room for any addtions or new requests now...nt even 1%...i said i will start the list on 15th today is 26th and nt even one movie from the list is out...
hope u all understand and give me a brake with requests...

,abhiG82,2010-12-28T10:47Z,"very nice rip and good movie as well. this encode looked crisper then some of the 720p ones that you have done. keep up the great work of sharing these awesome rips with all of us. If you are taking requests, see if yo can do Hero (2002):
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/
The visuals and sound recorded in this movie really screams out for a decent bluray rip. there is a 4.6G source in case you'd be interested:
