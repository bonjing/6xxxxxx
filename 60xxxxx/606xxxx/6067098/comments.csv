,JinnaWinkus,2011-01-07T18:01Z,Please can you explain how to get the name and key so I can play this game!!  Thank you

,cursty,2011-04-08T10:49Z,"the keygen works like that:
install game, when you are asked to put in key, first copy hardware fingerprint into keygen
hit ""generate
copy the name and the generated key into the game reg
play"

,Furiousone911,2011-09-12T00:56Z,Can't get it work past entering the Mansion.  I get a memory access violation every time.  Tried running as administrator and it didn't help.
,Maniac678,2011-10-29T21:30Z,"Honestly, Wendy99's uploads are far better than that. "
,Goodquality2012,2012-02-07T10:38Z,"This is, without a doubt, the WORST attempt at a torrent ever. First off, the Keygenerator freezes open, Secondly, the game itself FREEZES and crashes as soon as you click to go up the stairs. USELESS. 

Seriously, Dodgy uploads like this should be removed and the uploader be banned. "
