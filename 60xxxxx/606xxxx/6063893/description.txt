PLOT:


High-powered fashion photographer Claire Jameson finds herself stranded in middle America on the way to her dream Christmas-time wedding in Aspen. Unable to get another flight or rent a car, Claire is reduced to begging for a ride. When the rugged former artist turned teacher, Tom Pullman and his 13-year old daughter Hilly kindly offer to take her, none of them realize that their journey is just beginning, and it will leave all of them in a very different place than where they began.

Claire can't wait to tie the knot with her handsome multimillionaire fiancÃ©. But her plans for a storybook Christmas Eve wedding in Aspen are derailed when a huge storm paralyzes the entire Rocky Mountain region. Forced to hitchhike to reach the aisle, Claire meets widower Wes and his 12-year-old daughter. Though it's hate at first sight for the adults, over the course of their arduous three-day journey, Claire and Wes come to realize that their initial preconceptions about each other are all wrong, and an undeniable attraction develops between them. On the eve of her wedding, Claire is forced to ask herself a surprising question: is Wes, a man who is seemingly wrong for her in every possible way, really Mr. Right?
