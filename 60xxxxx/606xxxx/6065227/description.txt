Seven months ago, on a rainy March night, sixteen year- old Willowâ€™s parents died in a horrible car accident. Willow was driving. Now her older brother barely speaks to her, her new classmates know her as the killer orphan girl, and Willow is blocking the pain by secretly cutting herself. But when one boy â€”one sensitive, soulful boyâ€”discovers Willowâ€™s secret, it sparks an intense relationship that turns the â€œsafeâ€ world Willow has created for herself upside down.
Told in an extraordinary fresh voice, Willow is an unforgettable novel about one girlâ€™s struggle to cope with tragedy, and one boyâ€™s refusal to give up on her.
