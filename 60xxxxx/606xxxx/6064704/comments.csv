,typek1999,2010-12-27T19:11Z,Watch out! On the Aerosoft website only the FS2004 is available at the moment. And the torrent is anonymous.
,karakorama,2011-01-06T17:58Z,"typek1999, donÂ´t watch out nothing, the guy is saying that he install on FSX, not that the file is for FSX.  You can clearly read on the title ""FS2004_Aerosoft _German airports 1 Stuttgart"". 

 I always upload trusted files as Anonymous, so what is the problem with that?."
,xypto,2011-01-12T14:12Z,the e-mail given for registration ends in @aerosoft... Is this OK?
,typek1999,2011-02-02T19:06Z,Dangerous file!!!!
