I read online on this error and well i read that it had something to do with Windows 7 itself. Months later this problem finally stopped! 

My question is, will this problem occur again since i plan on formating my current version and installing this one..
please let me know and thanks! :)"

,nicodemus1,2011-01-13T00:06Z,Wonderful!! What a great job you have done Computer-User !!...But i'm having trouble with Win 7 and i need to talk to you!! and I can't send you a PM to your Suprbay account :( 
,nicodemus1,2011-01-13T00:18Z,"Dear Mr. Computer-User.

First of all let me tell you that it is wonderful how you dedicate so much time and effort to bring us the programs, like windows 7, to common people like me.

However there are some issues I have with the â€œinstallationâ€ of Windows 7 professional.  I had a series of problems which I believe are linked together. 
First, when I tried to burn win 7 as a bootable DVD using nero it said that the .iso format was could not handle  the size of the image, it said form me to change it to a .UDF format (I still canâ€™t find a way to do so), so I had to burn it as a data DVD. I tried to use that DVD through the boot option of â€œboot from CD/DVDâ€. It didnâ€™t work. So I used a virtual drive, and it worked perfectly. It installed with no problem at all and I was happy for some days. Then on the third day I decided to format the partition, for I needed space to give it to windows and also to install ubuntu. This is where everything went down.
I used a partition program to format that partition in which had my old windows. When it finished I couldnâ€™t enter win7. It didnâ€™t pass from the loading point after the part in which all the storage is detected, and it did detect the hard disk in which both windows were installed, and then the monitor went black and stated that there was â€œno signalâ€. 
So I tried to install ubuntu, and the same thing happened, it went black and the â€œno signalâ€ appeared. 

I formatted the HD in another computer that I have and tried to install win 7 through that computer.  Everything went well until it started to expand the files. When it got to like 47%, the monitor went black and the â€œno signalâ€ appeared again. I tried again to install ubuntu, and the same thing happened.

So please! If there is a way that you could help me I will greatly appreciate it.

,a7xdan,2011-01-14T18:55Z,"Heeeeeeey Computer-User

My friend was telling me that when you install a downloaded copy of windows 7, then use the internet, microsoft can tell that it has been downloaded, and they can shut down your pc? 

This had happened to him but i know other people who have downloaded windows 7 and have had no problem.

Ive never downloaded and operating system before so could you please tell me if i am taking a risk downloading this? 

Thanks Dan. :)"
,a7xdan,2011-01-15T01:47Z,"Ohh and also, 

i noticed that you said to burn the ISO onto a DVD disk at the slowest speed possible, what happens if i use the fastest speed? lmao(:"

Did you burn the ISO. onto a DVD at the lowest burn speed possible?

,DonCorleone7,2011-01-16T21:53Z,"Just make sure you burn the iso image at the slowest speed possible, and it should work fine. As for my question, if anyone else had the same problem as me, just download a windows 7 activator and it the computer then reads the windows as activated. Again, great torrent and works perfect :)

A DVD Disk Hold 4.7 GB Of Data, You Should Not Be Getting That Message This Torrent Is Only 2.73 GB.

Did You Use 1 Of The Activation Programs On Windows After You Installed Windows? :)

No They Can't Tell What You Have, What He's Talking About It The Activation Method, After You Use A Activation Prgram Too Activate Widnows, And You Download The KB971033 Windows Update, Then Sometimes Windows Will Not Be Activated Anymore, All Other Windows Updates Are Cool, Just ""Hide"" That 1 Windows Update.

Yes, Did You Burn The .ISO File Onto A New Blank DVD Disk And Burn At The Slowest Speed Possible.?

Set it to give as much as you take and you'll download quicker as more will have the pieces.

Hey guys downloaded this torrent and it works well kind off, i found out that from if you already have windows 7 and want to upgrade it for example you need the XP Mode, all you have to do it type windows upgrade anytime under search in startmenu and then using one of the activation codes provided from the torrent, insert when it asks u then click upgrade, all under 10 minutes!! fucken Awesome!! hence do not have to download the whole torrent just the activation codes!! only works if you have a currently windows 7!"
