,Star0589,2010-12-31T02:08Z,Why is it that so many people are having trouble finding the forgetful goblin? Please tell me how to find him :)
,NorthBayLady,2010-12-31T04:05Z,"I can't seem to find the forgetful goblin.  Mira says that he is at the Lake Lookout on the right, but I don't see him.  I need to find him to continue on.  Help"

,pudzzy,2011-01-01T10:13Z,â˘Back away from the vista to find goblin
,Star0589,2011-01-02T03:49Z,The goblin simply is not there; when you back away from the vista there is no one in sight
,Franks1968,2011-01-03T20:40Z,"Still can't find ""Forgetful Goblin"", any & all help please."
,gummii88,2011-01-07T07:11Z,i played through twice and no forgetful gnome...i googled it. bfg has a forum about it...theres a bug in the game. you cannot get past it. unistall and play the trial version the rest of the way through if your playing online. if not play the trial version from the beginning. suuuper lame but thats how it goes =)
,rajahpheonix,2011-08-10T13:49Z,"I agree with you star0589 and northBaylady,
I have got to chapter 4 and I back away from the vista to find no goblin there.
I really think its unfair on what gummii88 said
I don't see why that can't fix it so that we can go on with the game, I really enjoyed playing the game.
I mean if there is a bug in the game they should fix it please. So that we can play on and finish the game."
