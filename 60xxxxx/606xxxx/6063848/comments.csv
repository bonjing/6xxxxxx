is a better rip.

[V],globeplus,2010-12-25T10:19Z,"To sender70 :  i think you are wrong because the type of files for this game certainly donĂÂ´t justify a borring setup.bat , it is a matter a correct analysis of the files that the game have and if it is possible to evitate that type of procedure , why not ? Why the users have to wait getting a little complexated if the game will be ok ? Can work like that , but the ripper must turn the work more pratical as possible and that is part of the job .

Thank you for your comment and happy gaming no matter is the file ."
[V],Shroo,2010-12-25T15:14Z,"@globeplus

I thought I will never have to come here again, but you asking for it.

you skank we dont disrespect your files and yet you manage to do that just because someone posted a link to one of our games. No one understand what you are talking about so just stick to making rips and your lame descriptions. Leave us alone and we leave you. But if you think you can trash around think again."
[V],globeplus,2010-12-25T16:31Z,"To shroo : i think you are missing thr real point and that is a better analysis about the game to decude if it is really necessary a setup.bat , it a matter to turn the game file more praticak as possible to the users , it is only a construtive critic , not a repreension .

Cheers ."
