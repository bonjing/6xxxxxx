,Danderpie,2012-01-18T02:36Z,"So I guess I'm the only retarded one, but I can't seem to get it installed.  I downloaded the torrent, followed the instructions, but maybe I missed a step.
I created a temp file, copied all the files to a disc, burned the disc, reinserted it and started the setup.exe from the disc.  The installer got stuck about a third of the way in, with an error message saying it couldn't find any mission data at all.  

Did this happen to anyone else, or did I miss a step somewhere?  Thanks!"
,Tuzito,2012-03-03T05:30Z,"Danderpie: Try to install virtually and avoid to burn a disk. Why? The OEM disk has been modified to run in 64-bit... if you put the disk n run setup you installing the older version... Mount the ISO  (strongly recommended PowerISO), open explorer on it, look for the Installer (no Setup) and run... Dont forget to create your pilot BEFORE 1st run and you'll be ok. Hope this help."
,Tuzito,2012-03-03T06:13Z,FOR ALL: Go to the official page and download the patch/update called xwaupd202.exe ... You're welcome.
