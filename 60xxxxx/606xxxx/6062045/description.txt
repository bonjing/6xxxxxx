FINALLY (RELOADED & PROUDLY) I BRING TO YOU, MY SEEDERS & LEECHERS, THE 3nd PART OF THE X-WING TRILOGY...

	==========================================================
		Star Wars: X-WING ALLIANCE (Collectors Ed?) 2 CDs
		   (patched & tested on Windows7x64)     
	=========================================================

DESCRIPTION:
-----------
This are the modified X-WING ALLIANCE Collector's 2 CD-ROMs (XWA_DISK_1 & 2) in order to install and run this from ANY Windows up to Win 7x64.


KNOW ISSUES:
------------
- Its common, after you run setup and  try to run it, nothing happens. Restart/log-off and you will run it.

- You MUST create your pilot profile and do the hardware settings


DESCRIPTION/LIST OF FILES WITHIN THIS...
----------------------------------------
- XWA_DISKs.7z (664 MB) contains only the ISOs of XWA (1.18 GB)
- XWAcover.jpg  (137 KB) 640x815 Cover Box Art
- Readme.txt (3 KB more or less, again :)


WHAT YOU NEED/HAVE BEFORE RUN? 
------------------------------
- You only need a virtual drive prog (I recommend PowerISO), for mount the image and install.

- VISIT the Markus page http://www.markusegger.at/Software/Games.aspx AND READ VERY WELL ALL NOTES related. 

- You also can find detailed info (from MarkusEgger) on file "Instructions.html" in the disk

- YOU MUST HAVE a joystick/gamepad

- RECOMMENDED (x older OS): Get OEM CD-ROM/image to run the game AFTER setup and config 

-----------------------------------------------------

This version is based on:
------------------------
- Game Version: 
  From "Threedots_dead" "Star_Wars_Flight-Sim_Gems(X-Wing_TIE-Fighter_XWA)"
   at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3526002/

- Info, patchs, and other stuff:
  (mostly) by Markus Egger ("THE MAN", who made the installers/this possible) at his page: 
  http://www.markusegger.at/Software/Games.aspx

- THANKS to all others not mentioned here who was involved; starting with G.Lucas.

- To all of you, brothers & sisters pirates, who share without ask something back, and
