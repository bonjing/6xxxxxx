Maya's feeling a little sleepy, but the music soon picks her up. We had the music playing loud, which was sort of contrary to the whole sleepy theme, and she wound up doing more dancing than tired stretching. You can see it in the last few pictures in this set.

Maya is a genius. Talking to Maya is talking to someone whose lights are all on. She is amazingly intelligent and has the ability to either solve great problems of thought and science, or win a million dollars on Jeopardy. I'd bet on Jeopardy because she seems to like modeling alot more than solving math problems. Personally, I'd enjoy the math more, but that's why I work on my side of the camera. Maya's got some great antique jewelry that matches well with her sophisticated style. What she lacks in experience she makes up for in natural ability, but hey...she's smart. Driving is another matter though. Maya's a genius, but I wouldn't get in a car with her behind the wheel.
