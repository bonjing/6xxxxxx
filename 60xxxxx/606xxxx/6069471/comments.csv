,Neo300x,2011-01-01T04:29Z,"To make sure that the program doesn't automatically update ever:
1. Open ""c:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"" in notepad with administrative privileges.

2. Type ""127.0.0.1 www.internetdownloadmanager.com"" without quotes after the line ""#	127.0.0.1  localhost"".

3. Save the file.

4. Now even if u try updating the program manually. it will Give an error.. Tada!! :)

By the way, Happy New year everyone!!"
