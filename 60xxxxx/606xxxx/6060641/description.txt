 Album Info..: 
 
 The stronger songwriting on 3 Doors Down's multi-platinum sophomore effort, Away from the Sun, was encouraging, especially after the rote post-grunge of their 2000 
 breakthrough, "Kryptonite." But the hit single "When I'm Gone" resonated in 
 particular with American military personnel and their families, who identified with lyrics like "Hold me when I'm here" and "Love me when I'm gone" as deployment to Iraq became imminent in spring 2003. That populism guides Seventeen Days, the Mississippi band's third full-length album.
