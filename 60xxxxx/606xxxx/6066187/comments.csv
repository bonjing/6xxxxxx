Anyway many thanks VLis will give it a try :-)..."
,d-animator,2011-03-29T14:03Z,"Great rip!! thanks.
The quality you'd expect from a Blu-Ray rip of this size, great picture (not at all blocky or pixalated).
Would definately recommend this dl, took less than 30mins to get at 1mb/s. As it's not Blu-Ray but a BRrip I'd say V-8 and A-8, though for what it is I'd say 10/10. Hope this helps and Great up VLiS, thanks again."

Anywho...

A: 8
V: 8.5
M: 8"

As I've experienced differing results from those posted by others for various torrents..I cannot say what YOUR experience will be like.

That Said..this one..for me..is PERFECT! Literally..the..'Reason For Being' for Torrent Option and Culture Sharing..Perfect. V-10/A-10/Widescreen/Directors Cut..Flawless. No Crunchies no Problems..Flawless.

Thank you again.

P.S. I'm taking this opportunity to address the ""Seeder"" issue; (Sorry) But fact is..some of us..are still Small Town/Very rural Mountain or otehr locals. We literally..no exaggeration..Can Not ""Seed"" effectively. It is not Selfishness or ""Convenience"" for us the choice is literally..""Seed Or No Web"". Nothing workd if we are seeding. So we still try..leave it on ""At Night"" etc..but people need to realize we are all not urban ""Super Web"" Corporate Subscribers. I would if I could..it is a reality..like TOR..for some of us..its not ""Simple Yes Or No"".

Please Understand.

Thanks."
