,meowmixmann,2011-01-06T03:41Z,"game is glitched, not sure if its for everyone but I had to uninstall it more then half way through because an item wasnt showing up ( I checked multiple walkthrough's to confirm this )"
,Suepetal,2011-01-09T02:24Z,"I also am having trouble. In the ship one of HOG's you cant find the pirate... I have gone over the page with a fine tooth comb and no luck. is there an update or fix for the game please.
P.S. keep up the great work on HOG's, I am hooked on them"
,heatherose,2011-01-17T00:55Z,yeah i had the same problem. First problem I've had with a wendy99 game.
,fairyboi88,2011-01-19T11:27Z,"I have to agree with all the other commenters about the Pirate in of the Hidden Object Hunts. I've checked walkthroughs thinking maybe there is something I'm supposed to do, but alas still nothing."
,Darkman-xxx,2011-01-19T19:12Z,I have too this problem where is the Pirate?
,leggieuk,2011-02-24T16:39Z,I also have the problem ... !! no pirate anywhere ? I hope wendy will be able to fix this problem as I am really enjoying the game
