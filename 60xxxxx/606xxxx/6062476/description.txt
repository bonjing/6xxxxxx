 The movie 'Life Express' is the story about an 
 urbanized couple Tanvi and Nikhil, whose life's
 pace revolves around their respective careers  
 so much so, that they have no time to spend    
 with each other or start a family. The film    
 is also the story of Mohan and Gauri who live  
 far away from the daily hustle and bustle of   
 big city and are leading a poverty ridden life 
 in a village and the challenges they face in   
 their day -to-day life. The film deals with    
 motherhood, love, aspirations and priorities   
 individuals make in their lives, touching upon 
 major societal issues, solutions and trading   
 of human emotions for personal benefits.
