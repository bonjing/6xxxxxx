Storyline

Roy Munson was raised to be the best bowler in the world (trained early on by his father). But a fellow bowler, Ernie McCracken and a misunderstanding with some rough punks, leaves poor Roy with the loss of his bowling hand! Not to let this get him down, he gets a prosthetic hand and becomes a traveling sales man. But it's really all down hill for him from that night on until ... One day he meets Ishmael who's a Quaker that sneaks away from the farm to bowl (his fellow Quakers would disown him if they knew)! Roy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer and he'll make him the best bowler the world has ever seen. Reluctantly Ismael agrees to go on the road and shortly afterward actually finds that life outside the farm is quite fun. Soon their paths cross that of Ernie McCracken who is still top ranking bowler. While Roy's career and life have landed in the toilet bowl, Ernie is still drawing huge crowds and all the babes! They both square off for the ultimate bowling championship ...
