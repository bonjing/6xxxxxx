,saffirp2,2011-06-23T04:27Z,"To confirm, this worked perfectly for me on Windows 7 64 bit. I think it is 32 bit (not sure) but it worked great. I tried all the other ones - 4.0.1164, 1139 etc etc, none worked. 

HEre's what I did. 

Installed the .msi
unchecked the 'launch SmartFTP now' at the end of the install. 
Ran the patch (avast asked if it should be in the sandbox, but I ran it in the normal mode)
Browsed to the smartftp folder in program files(x86) and selected the .dll file. 
Patch was successful. 
Started up SmartFTP."
