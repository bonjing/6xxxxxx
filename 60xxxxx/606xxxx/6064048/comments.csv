,no_limit1,2011-01-11T06:58Z,"excellent torrent.

the album itself is also very good. they completely redeamed themselves with this one. god knows they had to after plastic beach. god that album blew!"
,krazcain,2011-01-20T20:02Z,"I thought plastic beach was bad... I think this is actually worse. No_limit1, you got my hopes up for nothing. lol At least I kinda liked the last song in plastic beach (pirate jet). This one... no. There's not one song I like, or even tolerate listening to. At all. Gorillaz... I am disappointed."
,buud,2011-01-23T10:54Z,The slow growers are the best though krazcain. Give Plastic beach a few more listens. I fuckin love it now.
,arvo_part,2011-01-28T16:26Z,Does anyone know a link where i would be able to find Damon Albarn's mali music i've been looking for it for a while now and i've had no luck :(
,Holdaas1993,2011-01-31T01:04Z,"Everyone says Plastic Beach sucked but most people never really listened to it, it's a decent album there's lots of songs people never gave a chance."
,skyrlopez,2011-02-18T06:08Z,"haven't heard much from this one but i'm starting to love Plastic Beach, a bit wierd at first but it grew on me... STYLO MO'FUCKAS!!!!"
,Slippy78,2011-02-21T16:46Z,"Plastic Beach is a masterpiece, i thought it was their best album to date."
,sole_fish,2011-03-10T13:01Z,Plastic Beach is epic. A true artwork.

,mediyama,2011-03-23T23:50Z,"While Plastic Beach might not have been as good and certainly didn't have the same charm as previous Gorillaz albums, 
it was still a well-made album and nice to listen to.

I hope this album is about as good/better."
