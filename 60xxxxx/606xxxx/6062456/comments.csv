,Kreegle24,2010-12-24T18:52Z,"""Installer Integrity check has failed""

Doesn't seem to work. :("
,SteXmaN,2010-12-25T03:54Z,"For me it works fine,using win7 32bit.
Tnx for the upload cant wait for episode 2 :)"
,vmelia,2010-12-25T08:45Z,I haven't played it yet but will definately buy it. I have bought all the 'Sam & Max' and 'Monkey Island' episodes and they do not disappoint.
,Dimmis80,2010-12-25T08:56Z,Its working for me great to.@Kreegle24 did u use the crack .Or if u use it allright did u update your DX drivers and your Graphicks card drivers.Can u install the game at all.??
,11western,2010-12-25T16:13Z,"I think I'm doing something wrong. I don't see a .exe file just the game and crack files. Installed game opened file location and tried to paste crack to ""back the future "" file and it says cannot load game data. 
when I start game I get a sign in window to create account with telltale, is this normal?
Thanks for the help..."
,SteXmaN,2010-12-25T17:05Z,"@11western for me its working fine
i installed the game with no prob
copied crack to install folder
and thats it"
,11western,2010-12-25T18:31Z,"understood but maybe I'm copying the crack wrong, could you please explain the correct way to do this. Is it a dll file or something? I don't see a .exe file."
,11western,2010-12-25T19:34Z,"Gonna d/l again, maybe I missed something, still could use an explanation of how to do this or what the file name is exactly. Not very used to cracks.
Thanks in advance and merry x-mas"
,Dimmis80,2010-12-25T20:03Z,"@11western when u download this game you get a folder with a setup exe and a folder with a Crack.Install the game and then copy/paste the Crack incide the Episode1 folder witch is incide the ""Back to the Future the game""main folder.Then run the game and u are cool dude.Its very simple.. "
,SteXmaN,2010-12-25T20:41Z,"This is the folder where you have to paste crack exe :

Program Files/Teltale Games/Back To The Future/Episode 1

You will be asked to overwrite and you click yes.
Then run the game from youre desktop shourtcut."
,11western,2010-12-25T21:08Z,"Thanks, thought I tried that but have redownloaded and will install and give it a shot...thanks again."
,11western,2010-12-25T21:29Z,"maybe it's because I'm running 64bit win7 or something but I've done all that now and when I launch the game the sign in screen comes up ( I've made an account) I sign in and it says "" looks like you don't own bttf"" etc.
after I paste the crack into ep1 folder I open it and have 
crack
pack
back to the future
fmodex
qtcore4
qtgui4
network...etc.
I'll try to figure this out cause I hate it when a plan doesn't work...lol"
,11western,2010-12-25T21:30Z,"ps , it never did ask to overwrite just need admin permission to write so I click on the shield."
,11western,2010-12-25T21:49Z,"Oh well I give up, I guess it's not for my enjoyment...lol, just wanted to see how the game was. 
tried reinstalling twice, pasting the crack and all that and I still get the sign in screen and that I don't own a copy etc.
Maybe their will be another version like an iso or something.
thanks anyway"

I hope this helps. "
,SteXmaN,2010-12-26T02:46Z,"You are puting the crack on wrong place,
you have to overwrite the original exe
and then run it.
You dont need the acount or what so ever,
just play the game,its good and its even better if youre the fan of the movie trilogy,like me :)"
,seedplease2010,2010-12-27T13:18Z,"@SteXman
how do you do this?"
,11western,2010-12-27T16:14Z,"Couldn't give up just like that...lol.
steXmaN, I tried to highlight the folder (bttf) then right click and paste the crack, and the list that I put up before is what I get. The bttf file doesn't open it starts the install process. So which dll do I overwrite it to? "
,SteXmaN,2010-12-27T17:34Z,"11western dude,
im so high right now 
so its difficult to write the answer
for your problem.

But i will try>
YOU HAVE TO COPY THE CRACK EXE IN Crack FOLDER FROM YOUR DOWNLOAD FOLDER

TO

LOKAL DISK C:/Program Files/Telltale Games/Back to the Future/Episode 1/.....
....RIGHT CLICK PASTE THE CRACK IN Episode 1 FOLDER.

And run the game from desktop shortcut if you
some how dont have the shortcut on desktop go to>
.....Telltale Games/Back to the Future/Episode 1
 and run BackToTheFuture101 aplication or make the shortcut>right click on aplication,
send to,Desktop and run it from there.
"
,11western,2010-12-27T19:20Z,"LOL...stexman, I tried propers d/l and it pasted good but when I start the game ( click new game) it crashes. Well at least I'm getting closer.
Thanks dude"
,SteXmaN,2010-12-27T19:33Z,"This release is working 100%.
I finished the game today and
its really good.
First adventure game that i enjoyed,"
,Pole_Star,2010-12-28T02:39Z,"Thanks. Working perfectly. Completed the game. 9/10. :)

Felt a bit short than other Telltale episodes though. Wanted to play it more and more.

Those having black screens or other crashes in fullscreen. If you have ATI GPU, the latest ATI graphics card drivers's new Catalyst Control Center version (10.12), the one that supports 6950 or something, is buggy. Install the normal one over it. If still not good enough then go to the previous version. ;)"
,Akromantula,2010-12-28T23:20Z,"My Christmas gift as well. =))))
I'm so excited!!! I'm about to click the .exe!!! Waaa!!! =))))))))"
,tooby77,2010-12-29T18:26Z,"I dont get any sound!! And yes my sound is on, watching a movie on other screen. Yes i have copied crack to the right folder.. Help whould be nice, coz its a nice game "
,tooby77,2010-12-29T18:37Z,cant save... what did i do wrong?
,tooby77,2010-12-29T18:38Z,"Sry for massive post.. i clicked the .exe file, and didnt get sound. but if i click shortcut i get sound.. nice.. But i cant save... why"
,Bujaaa,2011-01-01T13:30Z,"@toby77
Try runing the game as administrator."
,comedy,2011-01-03T06:14Z,"I see at least 2 comments where people have said that they've played all the way through, but I'm stuck at part 7.  I was wondering if the game had a built in error like Batman Arkham where it would let you play up to a certain point on pirated versions."
,LordReserei,2011-01-04T03:40Z,"Speed was great, worked without any problems.

OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit
Mobo: Gigabyte G41M Combo
RAM: 4Gb Kingston DDR2 876Mhz (overclocked)
CPU: Core2Duo E7500 3.2Ghz (overclocked)
Vid card: Asus EAH5670 1Gb GDDR5 (overclocked)
Catalyst: 10.12

The game's better than I actually expected it to be, can't wait for next month's installment. "
,Chadly,2011-01-27T03:25Z,Nice :) awesome download. Worked easily :) you rock DibyaTPB :) I wish more games were this easy to get working here in TPB. Thank you Thank you Thank you. Back to the future rocks ;)
,eggsbox,2011-05-07T08:22Z,Can someone post up the mac version of this?
,nosaj128,2011-06-06T22:18Z,I'm not sure if it's my graphics card or what (shouldn't be) but I've tried at least 6 different downloads of this game with crap for results. First the sound at the beginning skips until I change the quality settings in the options menu. Then the game only shows the video mode when interacting with characters not when actually playing. It will show the cursor and text but thats it. Anyone else bean having this same issue? i've tried everything.
,jegfaller,2011-07-04T06:11Z,worked like a charm
