What is Gamebryo LightSpeed?

Gamebryo LightSpeed is the newest leap forward in game development technology delivering the only professional technology for start-to-finish multi-genre/multi-platform game development.  The Gamebryo LightSpeed game development system enables rapid prototyping, rapid iteration and real-time updates, simplifying game development through a data driven framework that opens doors to exciting gameplay possibilities.

Gamebryo LightSpeed (LightSpeed) is built on top of Gamebryo, the multiplatform engine and foundational technology with more than 300 game productions worldwide across every genre. LightSpeed adds a game framework, scripting system, tools, and extensible infrastructure.

LightSpeed provides a pipeline and runtime solution that allows programmers, artists, and designers to quickly stand up content; then rapidly and continuously iterate on game design, level design, gameplay mechanics, core logic, and game assets; transition to full production; and ship. LightSpeed's functionality is designed to support two principal objectives of today's game developers:

â€¢Rapid iterationâ€”change the art, entities, levels, and behaviors and see the effect in your game without recompiling or restarting. This minimizes the need for game restarts and reduces development delays.

â€¢Rapid prototyping and productionâ€”quickly move game content into a playable form, enabling you to evaluate technology and gameplay mechanics and assess the look and feel of levels and assets, and build on that work throughout the production cycle.

Aimed to empower innovation, LightSpeed gives developers the tools to quickly realize ideas and be free to iterate throughout the development process.  From first construction through final polish, you can iterate faster and get your playable design into your team's and publishers' hands faster.
