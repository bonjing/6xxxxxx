 Album Info..: 
 
 Considering that Help! functions as the Beatles' fifth album and as the soundtrack to their second film Ã¹ while filming, they continued to release non-LP singles on a regular basis Ã¹ it's not entirely surprising that it still has some of the weariness of Beatles for Sale. Again, they pad the album with covers, but the Bakersfield bounce of "Act Naturally" adds new flavor (along with an ideal showcase for Ringo's amiable vocals) and "Dizzy Miss Lizzie" gives John an opportunity to flex his rock & roll muscle. George is writing again and if his two contributions don't touch Lennon and McCartney's originals, they hold their own against much of their British pop peers.
