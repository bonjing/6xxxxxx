                            ALPHA AND OMEGA


Two wolves who are trying to get home after being taken by park rangers

and shipped halfway across the country. Humphrey is an Omega wolf,

whose days are about quick wit, snappy one-liners and hanging with his

motley crew of fun-loving wolves and video-gaming squirrels.

Kate is an Alpha: duty, discipline and sleek Lara Croft eye-popping

movies fuel her fire. Humphreys motto - make them laugh.

Kates motto - I am the boss. And they have a thousand miles to go.

Back home rival wolf packs are on the march and conflict is brewing.

Only Kate and Humphrey can restore the peace. But first, they have

to survive each other...
