    This is the story of one simple invention, the vibrator, and its         
    relationship to one complex human behavior, the female orgasm. The       
    history of the vibrator and its medical use had virtually vanished       
    until historian, Rachel Maines, researching needlework patterns in       
    early 20th century women's magazines, ran across ads for electric        
    vibrators. Piquing her curiosity, she traced the origins of this         
    early electrified appliance and made an astonishing discovery. Under     
    the guise of a medical treatment, Victorian doctors had used             
    vibrators to relieve women of symptoms of hysteria by masturbating       
    them to orgasm. Why did women need this treatment? Female sexual         
    satisfaction was, and continues to be, misunderstood or, worse,          
    ignored. Almost 70% of women do not reach orgasm by penetration          
    alone. Yet, the social, legal and religious definition of "real" sex     
    is just that: penetration of the vagina to MALE orgasm. FEMALE orgasm    
    isn't even considered. Is it any wonder that a lot of women were         
    unsatisfied? Their dissatisfaction was labeled "hysteria." Symptoms      
    of hysteria were vague - being cranky, reading French novels while       
    wearing tight corsets, etc. It was a disease manufactured by doctors     
    creating a lucrative clientele and a mutually camouflaged procedure      
    that satisfied both. In the late 1920s, vibrators began appearing in     
    blue movies. The camouflage was blown. Doctors dropped the treatment     
    and manufacturers stopped advertising. The vibrator went underground     
    and it disappeared from the annals of history until Maines happened      
    upon it. In the 1970s, the feminist movement, the birth control pill     
    and legalized abortions ushered in the sexual revolution. Artist and     
    author, Betty Dodson almost single handedly brought the vibrator back    
    into women's lives because of an accidental discovery. When Dodson       
    and her lover used a barber's scalp massager on her clitoris, she        
    experienced intense orgasms. Inspired by this revelation, she began a    
    crusade to teach women how to have orgasms with vibrators - alone and    
    with partners. In 2004, thirty years after Dodson's happy discovery,     
    the female orgasm is under attack again. Former fifth grade teacher,     
    Joanne Webb, was arrested for selling vibrators to two undercover        
    cops in a small Texas town. She had broken a state law that prohibits    
    the sale of devices that stimulate the genitals. Texas and three         
    other states have enacted these laws, a backlash to feminism. In         
    these states, however, it is legal to advertise and sell Viagra. This    
    double standard for women has far-reaching contemporary implications     
    for sexual freedom, civil liberties and the right to privacy.
