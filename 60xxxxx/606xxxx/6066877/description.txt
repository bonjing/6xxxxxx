In a special extended version of the programme, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May embark on an appropriately seasonal road trip as they attempt to follow the path of the Three Wise Men across the Middle East.
They do so in a trio of open top sports cars, each wholly unsuited to the conflict ridden mountains of southern Turkey, the dangerous warzones of Iraq and the searing deserts of Syria.
Along the way they test the limits of mechanical and physical endurance as well as asking the vital question, what exactly is myrrh and where do you buy it?
