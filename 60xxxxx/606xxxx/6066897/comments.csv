,Tim_WLF,2010-12-27T20:58Z,anyone subs?
,GMozzarel,2010-12-27T22:20Z,"Thanks for the torrent. The show it was funny, but not ha-ha funny. More like deja-vu funny. 

Overacting and repetation is wearing Top Gear down. Hammond tries too hard making facial gestures being scared, suprised or what ever. Clarksons humour is very predictable, not so flamboyant anymore, and May is getting duller than ever. 

The next time again when they bumb into each others cars for laughs I'm going to say that okey now, now, this is over. "
