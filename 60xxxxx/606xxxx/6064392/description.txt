There where shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.  The angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were afraid.  The angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.  And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.

Wishing you and yours a safe and happy Christmas this year.
