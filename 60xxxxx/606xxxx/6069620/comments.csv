for years now i have been downloading your content and it has always been solid and reliable. thank you for that. Really, Thank You!!!

your screens and previews however are fucking ridiculous. Really, i have to copy and paste the link because you halfass the job. have a little pride in your work and common courtesy for the downloaders and give us a clickable link. its not that hard at all.

im not trying to come off as unappreciative because i really am a fan of your content. i just thought that after years of your postings i should finally say something."
