Looks like the 3 films have Spanish Audio only.
Since I speak the language it wasn't a problem, maybe the other language track are accesible using Nero , I might just try that.

Galapagos 3D has Audio Codec problem about 5 minutes into video, so that's no sound for the rest of the film.

I still haven't watched Into the Deep but I suppose it's also in Spanish.

If you like great 3D I recommend Under the Sea narrated by Jim Carrey.
