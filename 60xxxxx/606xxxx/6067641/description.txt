BBC The Private Life of a Christmas Masterpiece 2010 The Adoration of the Christ Child HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup

Painted over five centuries ago, Filippo Lippi's nativity is like no other: the birth of Christ in a dark, wooded wilderness. Its beauty inspired Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. But it also conceals a deeply personal story. It was painted for Cosimo de' Medici, a wealthy banker who feared that his money was dragging him straight to hell. The artist's life was equally surprising. One of the most celebrated painters of his day, Filippo Lippi was also a Carmelite friar, but he was no stranger to the temptations of the flesh.

The audio is a bit dodgy at 1 second which lasts for about 1 second. The problem was in the original broadcast although the TS file shows no continuity errors. The source video bitrate was about 6500Kbps average so I've used the same bitrate for encoding. To maintain a quality factor above 0.17 means that the frame size is limited to 1600x900 due to the BBC policy of broadcasting in low bitrate HD.
