,nittany,2010-12-23T11:12Z,"This one actually has good imdb ratings, I'll have to check it out.  I figured it would be a flop since it has Ryan Reynolds in it."
,andep2000,2010-12-24T02:13Z,Thx man. Great One!
,TooSwede,2010-12-25T12:26Z,IMDb gives it a 7.6! Should definitely be worth the download. +1 to nittany on Ryan.
,hacker7890,2010-12-28T00:01Z,Is it just me or is the sound quiet on this one? 
,Redundantos,2010-12-29T20:32Z,Now that's one movie you absolutely don't have to watch in HD. Because what you see on the cover is literally everything you'll see in the movie. It could easily be audiobook)
,ademirado,2010-12-29T21:41Z,Thank you!
,gabwc,2010-12-30T19:22Z,excelent quality and the movie is amazing.
,kruze1994,2010-12-30T22:48Z,"This movie is so awesome, my hands are now shaking. 10/10"
,RuLeXDM,2010-12-30T23:06Z,"I just finished watching the movie, the quality is awesome, but the movie is garbage.


***Spoiler Alert***
1.The movie is based on 1 single scene. Probably the cheapest movie EVER! 
2.There's only 1 character in the movie!
3.The guy never gets help, and dies buried alive. (That's the end of the movie)

I love Ryan Reynold's act performance, but the movie is just shit."
,Sefram_Verispot,2011-01-05T18:41Z,"@ RuLeXDM:

,Lopignon,2011-01-06T16:33Z,Seeeed please.. downspeed ~5kt/s
,Rodan.H,2011-01-08T13:43Z,"I did download this in 1080p by BOZX because of (like you all other guys) it has good ratings. I thought is sucked not because there is no action, guns, explosions and such but it was kinda boring but the end was cool. Thanks for the up aoloffline!"
,Kcirtap13,2011-01-10T20:36Z,"@RuLeXDM
You bloody wanka fucking homo u fucking told the end you fucking asshole, keep that shit for yourself.
KANKER HOMO! JEZUS CHRIST MAN COCKSUCKING DICKHEAD!"
,irishboym4,2011-01-16T08:15Z,stupid movie.  Good quality though.  Not worth the two hours i spent watching it.....
,ici-x,2011-01-17T20:35Z,"Don't get mad @RuLeXDM the guy probably saved u 95 mins of your time. The movie is just stupid... won't give any spoilers for those who haven't seen it yet... but believe u me, u r better off without it.
You basically have a casket, a stupid character, mobile phone and a zippo... and a few other things but that's not the point. With such a few details about a movie how can you fuck up a scene? But you can...

00:34:10 When he checks the battery he holds the phone upside down.

After this i just skipped to the end of the movie. "
,pystdante,2011-01-23T10:04Z,"@ RuLeXDM - I usually hate ppl who spoil the ending, but you DID mention 'spoilers' AND I wish someone told me that there is only ONE scene, for this movie is garbage, I kept thinking ""Hey maybe they will show when he was captured' nope, nothing but him in the goddamn coffin! What a piece of shit movie!!!"
,NerdsterX,2011-02-09T08:01Z,"Great Download and quality but unnecessary for such good quality
This film was black half the time and it was all this really was, was talking
The commercial looked good (it looked like there was a hole conspiracy going on) but truthfully, you just waisted 2 hours
THIS WAS THE WORST FILM EVER!!!!!!!! IT JUST PLAIN OLD SUCKED 
YOU MIGHT AS WELL OF RE-WATCHED THE GODFATHER OR SOMETHING ELSE GOOD LIKE INCEPTION!
THIS JUST SUCKED SO BAD 
A WAIST OF TIME BUT NOT MONEY LOL"

,TheBlackWhirlwind,2011-06-15T22:19Z,Anyone else having problems with the file causing Windows Explorer to crash?
,pushkin2011,2011-07-13T20:55Z,The visual value of the movie doesn't call for HD. Its entertaining value doesn't call for watching.
,tomcsi95,2011-08-04T13:35Z,"Thankyou very much! This is a perfect HD!!
THX!!!"
