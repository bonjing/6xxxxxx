,lenky,2010-12-24T18:28Z,"Hi Pokler, thx again it's well appreciated. Does that mean that you will eventually upload the sets that I requested?"
,Pokler,2010-12-24T19:51Z,"Yes, I will get there eventually. At the rate I am going now it will take 13 release before I hit Rane Revere at #202.

That is another reason for posting the set list. People can see what to expect.

Don't worry, I plan on seeing this through the WHOLE way."
,Pokler,2010-12-24T19:52Z,"Great, commenting works again for me."
