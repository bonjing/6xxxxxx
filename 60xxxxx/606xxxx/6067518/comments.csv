,Zack_K7,2010-12-27T16:38Z,"Crack is integrated.
Group name is SKIDROW."
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2010-12-27T18:24Z,"Yes Skidrow takes the credit, me only integrating the tenth update and the Skidrow fix over it all...

integration meaning taking the files of the tenth update and replacing the old ones or simply adding them into the coresponding location into the kit (not all files from the 10th update are replacing original files...some being totally new )"
