Rudy Van Gelder is widely regarded as one of the most important recording engineers in music history.  In 1957 he recorded Blue Train.  The excellent vinyl MONO version ripped by AKSMAN can be found here:

In 2003 Rudy Van Gelder went back to the original master tapes and remastered this STEREO version.  He included alternate takes of the songs Blue Train and Lazy Bird. Thanks to BOBVERENS for this rip.

You can never have enough Coltrane...
