Plot / Synopsis

A novel by Valerio Zurlini was the basis of the Italian Le Ragazze di Sanfrediano (The Girls of San Frediano). The story deals with the amorous escapades of handsome garage mechanic Bob. The first name in Bob's little black book is the tempestuous Tosca (Rosanna Podesta, who that same year played the title role in Helen of Troy). Before long, our hero throws Tosca over for a chorus dancer, a schoolteacher and a dress designer. Through it all, Gina, a girl who lives in Bob's apartment building, silently carries a torch for the grease-monkey Lothario. Just guess who Bob eventually winds up with.
