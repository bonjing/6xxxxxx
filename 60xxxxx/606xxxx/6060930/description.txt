It was the night before christmas, that the guys from the Swedish unsigned rockband BFM, decided to give there entire music collection to the people.
So they did a torrent file and put it on thepiratebay, for all people to download for free.
This is what a real boogie christmas should sound like. So play it LOUD!

The band has recently been heard on the german internet radio channel www.sqrr.de
and also on the english internet radio channel www.realhitradio.co.uk

So dont wait any longer, download now and boogie all night.

BFM whish you all a 
Merry Boogie Christmas 
and a
Happy New year
