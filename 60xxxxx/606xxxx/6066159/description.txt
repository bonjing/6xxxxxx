OK, boys and girls here it is - the most stupendous, exhilarating, spine-tingling 5-0 episode ever.  Well...maybe.  Anyway, this is the banned episode that did not appear on the season 2 DVD release.

If you are looking for DVD quality, then you are completely fucked.  This is a film rip that has been passed around for years.  It's kind of like watching old color commercials from 1965-75 on Youtube.  The audio is hollow and tinny. EQ will help tremendously.  I used the "jazz" setting on my Sony player and it helped a lot.

Enjoy and Merry Christmas!  Ho-ho-ho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
