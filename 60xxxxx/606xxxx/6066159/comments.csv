,D0gmeat,2010-12-26T15:30Z,"From Wikipedia:

""Bored She Hung Herself"", the 16th episode of the second season, depicted a Five-O investigation into the apparent suicide of a woman by hanging, which she was supposedly practicing as part of a health regimen. A viewer reportedly died trying the same technique, and as a result, the show was not rebroadcast, was never included in any syndication packages, and was not included in the dvd set of the second season released on July 31, 2007."

,Bynx,2010-12-26T16:55Z,"Monkey see, Monkey do.  How stupid is that?"
,420mandude,2010-12-26T23:08Z,"@MDGarp We would expect you to bend over and take it like you always do.

Aragont? Funny."
,Majty,2010-12-26T23:27Z,"Well.....I have to agree with the others, stupid beyond belief :S"
,Majty,2010-12-26T23:29Z,"I mean that the reason for banning that episode was stupid. One old lady died watching Passion of the christ in the cinemas, and that isnt banned as far as I know.
I dont think yanks are superior in the stupid department."
,V_tom,2010-12-29T23:19Z,Request: Season 3 and 7
,pooket,2010-12-31T02:12Z,"There is an alternate explanation as to why this episode was banned:
""This episode aired once on Jan 7, 1970. Due to it's portrayal of the Hare Krishna, a lawsuit was threatened. To settle any possible legal problems, CBS agreed to never air the episode again. This episode never aired in re-runs or in syndication and was not included in the Season 2 DVD release of the series. As far as I've been able to ascertain, the oft found story that it was because of fears of copycat hanging deaths is a myth.""

I don't know which story is correct, but just because everybody believes one story is true because it appeared on Wikipedia doesn't make it true."
,XONi49,2011-01-11T12:19Z,just remember people all wiki sites allow random people (i can make an account and say i'm the king of england) to post anything i want to the site if no one objects it says there
