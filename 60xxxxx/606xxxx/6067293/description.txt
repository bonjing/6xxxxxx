Here is the classic driving/shoot 'em up game Interstate'76 Arsenal released from Good Old Games (GOG.com).  Enjoy this DRM-free release, working on the latest Windows operating systems (XP/Vista/7)!

What's cool about it:
    *Includes the original Interstate'76 and its expansion Interstate'76: Nitro Pack
    *Cinematic atmosphere, fast-paced action and an immersive story
    *Awesome soundtrack with funky disco tunes

This torrent also includes the manual for the game in the included ZIP archive.

Please support GOG.com and their effort to revive classic PC gaming without DRM-bullshit by visiting their site, buying some games (all games priced $6-10!), and spreading the news!

Cheers mateys!
