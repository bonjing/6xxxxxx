,chrispm84,2011-01-14T10:06Z,This was one of my top 10 games when I was a kid. Thanks Danger! I'll seed til 500%. 
,Elwood42087,2011-01-15T01:07Z,"I've been looking for this game for years, thank you for the quality copy. Will seed as long as possible to keep this awesome game alive. "
,kimjongwil,2011-01-27T10:15Z,i remember it being pretty freaking frustrating too
,Shitpoop,2011-01-29T03:45Z,"Don't waste your time if you're on a Windows 7 machine. The game runs great, but is unplayable because the cars bounce around like they are made out of rubber.

GOG.com's forums are crammed full of people with this exact same problem since Feb. of 2010, and there isn't a solution in sight without serious nigger-rigging.

Fuck this. I am so glad I never bought a game from GOG."
,Cyberdevil,2011-02-04T21:07Z,Classic. :)
,mrgladstone,2011-02-12T06:46Z,PLEASE SEED!!!! been downloading around 5kb/s aaaaand it jumped up to around 25kb/s T_T need MOAR!! NO EXCEPTIONS!!

,Elysium07,2011-04-13T06:11Z,"Great torrent, thanks for the GoG uploads! Would be great if you could get Guilty Gear X2 up. :)"
,RapierApe,2011-05-22T03:59Z,Wish I took Shitpoop's advice. I just wasted about 4 hours trying to get this to work on Windows 7 (64). It's hopeless.
,zionlion131313,2011-05-29T20:50Z,Great Upload dANGER_boy.  Now I'm searching for I82 even though I heard it was not that good...GoG does not sell it.  Thanks for everything.
,zionlion131313,2011-05-29T21:30Z,"I found Interstate 82 at ""TehParadox"" but you need to register for free.  They also have it on here at TPB but with only a couple of seeders.  You will need to d/l a no-cd patch for it.  Good luck everyone."

,nerd1337,2011-10-25T23:49Z,"This is one of the best games ever!  I am so happy to see there's a Windows XP/Vista/7/x64 compatible re-release!  I just tried to play my own Win95 copy in Windows XP mode and it still didn't work, even though it's worked in XP in the past.  Ah well, who cares now that I can just play this version.  Great up!"
,sixor,2011-11-02T13:02Z,"thanks, it works on win7 but bad, the colors are lke 256 colors, really bad, this is GOG fault, a release without quality, maybe it works fine in xp"
