,katsuya-urusaki,2012-04-07T06:35Z,"sounds like the first season... second season she uses a girl to come out of hell and exact ""revenge"" on people. hell girl goes even deeper into darkness."
,katsuya-urusaki,2012-04-07T06:37Z,"second season is this description... After Ai Enma's supposed death after the events of the 1st season, her three helpers, Ichimoku Ren, Wanyuudou and Hone-Onna live out their lives in relative peace. This is suddenly shattered when Kikuri returns to recruit them. Meanwhile, Ai mysteriously reappears from the dead and uses the body of a young schoolgirl, Yuzuki Mikage, to continue the Jigoku TsÌÅ∞shin operation. Yuzuki is aware of Ai's presence however, when she can see what Ai sees."
