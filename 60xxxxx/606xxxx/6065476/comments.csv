Enterprise Is A Volume Edition Yes, But No, Once You Download 1 Of My Torrents, Windows Update Will Be Fine, You Don't Need Too Keep Installing My Newer Releases. :)"

,seven7Up,2011-01-12T09:35Z,"@computer-user Thanks for all the December downloads. Mad skills.

One question. I've been able to install, register, and use Driver Genius on two machines before installing on a 3rd. On the 3rd machine, it keeps asking me to register when I want to fix my drivers. It accepts the key I had already put in before updating every time it asks me, but won't ""fix"" my drivers and still asks for Registration? Any idea why?

(The other two machines I used the key first, then did a scan, fix, etc. The 3rd machine I used the key, did an update because my ""database"" was more than 15 days old or something, scan, fix, register, scan, fix, register, etc.) 

Thanks again for all the work and uploads!
Interesting to see what W7's SP1 will bring."

Just saw your comment to ""heartsurfer008"". I'll DM you. I should read first before asking stuff. My bad."
,seven7Up,2011-01-12T09:55Z,"@computer-user

Tried sending you a private message with the link you provided to ""heartsurfer008"", but it said you aren't accepting private messages. My username on the forum is seven7up. If you could be so kind to message me maybe.

Sorry for all the comments one after the other."
,seven7Up,2011-01-12T19:07Z,"@Computer-User

Last comment I swear.

It seems after using the key and then doing that ""database"" update is not a good idea.
I installed on a 4th machine and after using the key did a normal scan with the big green button and works fine. I'll try to uninstall with RevoUninstaller and see what happens with a reinstall.

That ban thing on suprbay sucks."
