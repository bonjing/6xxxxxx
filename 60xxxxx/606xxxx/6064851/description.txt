FTV Girls - Janelle & Michelle - Big Ten
			
Janelle: I had some nice classy dress clothes with me but Michelle didn't bring any with her.  So we went to the studio FTV house and we picked out a black dress for her to wear with her black heels.  I have a matching pair too exactly the same brand (but mine is size 6, I have small feet!).  When we were both fully dressed up we looked like two girls out to a prom or something!  We went upstairs so I could show her my cover pages on the wall.  
Michelle: These shoes are hard to put on, I know Janelle is used to wearing heels but I'm a sneakers kind of a person.  She has to help me with the straps, they are a pain to put on.  I don't think my feet are pretty either, so I'm not into wearing heels that show off my feet.  She started to go down on me right there again but aren't we supposed to go shoot outside somewhere?  Well we did end up going to do a scene at a cafe but I got stage fright and I couldn't do it.  The very last part of the video its just us taking a lunch break and talking about boyfriend problems.
