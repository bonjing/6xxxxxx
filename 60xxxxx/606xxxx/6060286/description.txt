                          Helena from the Wedding


is the writer/director Joseph Infantolino's first feature film.

Shot mostly in sequence in and around a small cabin 

in upstate New York, this nuanced and funny portrait of marriage

and anxiety in the late blooming professional class revolves

around one dark night of the soul of Alex Javal, who is feeling

so out of sorts that he fails to appreciate his new wife,

Alice and the new life she represents.

The story takes place over the course of a weekend long New Year's

Eve party that the Javals host for their closest friends and one

unexpected guest, the very beautiful and very young Helena...
