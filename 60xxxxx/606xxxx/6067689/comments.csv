Thank you Computer-User."
,dayexday,2011-11-15T21:50Z,"i bought an acer netbook preinstalled with windows 7 starter but the boot sector apparently is corrupted. i downloaded this torrent. Extracted the contents of the iso file to a usb and tried to boot from the usb on the acer netbook. It makes it to the screen where it says ""setup is starting..."" but doesn't go past that. Not really frozen because i can still move the mouse cursor. Any idea what's wrong? "
,wilco1000,2011-11-17T23:45Z,"This works well but why say it is just Windows 7 Starter when in fact it is all Versions.
It makes a difference when people only want Starter!"
