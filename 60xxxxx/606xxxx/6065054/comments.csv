Audio level way down. Had to crank up the volume and plug in the earphones. Awesome episode though. Many thanks."

I believe the BiA release is not the same but is ""Doctor Who Confidential"", which us a ""making of"" sort of show that has been around for a while now as a companion for every episode of DW in recent years."
