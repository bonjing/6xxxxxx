,sxypanther,2010-12-27T18:45Z,"Cant get any of the crack codes to work, tried about 100 different ones.  Are we supposed to put a certain persons name in the crack file when you hit generate? thank you"
,nihilxs,2010-12-30T20:44Z,u have to put in the HWID code too which appears when it asks for name and key. it works and it's virus free. have fun!
,pshobe,2011-01-04T22:00Z,Okay so maybe I'm a mega-tard...but I am not able to use the crack....my generator will create the code...but again...I am lost on the name to enter...HWID...uh yeah...can you get more specific? LOL!! Sorry :)
,pshobe,2011-01-04T22:16Z,"OMG I got it finally! LOL...for those megatards like myself:  
1. open game to name/key 
2. copy Hardware #  ****-**** (whatever yours says)
3. go to key generator (in downloaded files for game) and copy into HWID box
4. enter name of game into name box...duh
5. generate code
6. back to game....enter the name you put in generator into name box...and code generated into code box...simple eh? LOL
7. submit and it should work...did for me anyway...
Good Luck Mega-tard!!! LOL"

Until the items are found, you can not proceed.

Real shame as the game was really good and bug free up till this problem."
