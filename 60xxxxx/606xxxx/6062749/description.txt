Harlem Slim is from New York (hence the name?) and now resides in Houston TX working at Fullers Vintage Guitars and teaching. He has recently made a shift to flamenco music. A musical direction I have also taken after many years of listening and playing the blues. But this CD is pure Delta Blues played on resonator guitar with plenty of slide work. I believe some of these tunes are by Slim, but most are classic delta covers. Dyin' Crapshooters Blues is an excellent effort as is Poor Boy.
   

Another release by Harlem Slim. This one starts off with some distorted electric work, there are a couple of them on this one. Harlem's also got a couple guests on this one as well. But it mostly comprised of his familiar vintage 30's resonator sound. Good stuff!
