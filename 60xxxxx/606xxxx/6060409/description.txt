Icing conditions can and do exist throughout the year across most of the USA. Explains weather phenomena likely to produce ice and how to avoid those areas through careful preflight planning. Examines icing forecasts/reports, the go/no-go decision, the use of anti- and de-icing equipment or (if all else fails) how to deal with a plane-load of ice.
