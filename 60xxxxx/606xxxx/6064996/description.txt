my previous upload of this show was not the dvd9
version but this is.



KISS
Atlanta, Georgia 1996
Date: 96-10-01
Venue: The Omni

Recording: 1 cam PRO NTSC Dual-layer
Quality: 9
Menu: yes
Comments by Mick E. Gee: Thanks to Ron for the tape and Deuce8pro (Matt) for the transfer.
1 cam pro shot (Peter/photo pit cam) 5.1 surround and 2.0 stereo

Comments by NCB: This is the version with only two cams. First 40 min is Peter's cam only
and then it's the photo pit cam for the rest of the show (which is a bit dark and has a few shots
of nothing). Picture quality is excellent though and audio is soundboard and kicks ass.
