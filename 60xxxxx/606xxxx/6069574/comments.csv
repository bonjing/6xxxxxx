It shouldn't be ""practice makes a man perfect"", It should rather be ""Experience makes a man perfect"".

We get to learn something new everyday.

,Volomon,2011-05-19T01:55Z,"""Experience makes a man perfect"", would mean there's a limit to experience and since the experience is undefined it's all encompassing.  Meaning experience is an unlimited potential, meaning man can never be perfect.  ""Practice makes a man perfect"", refers to a limited aspect and that the perfection is in something he seeks, singularly."
