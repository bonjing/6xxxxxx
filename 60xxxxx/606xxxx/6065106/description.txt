Our Prophet (saas) is a blessed person to whom Allah (God) revealed the Qurâ€™an, the last righteous Book, and made an example to humanity with his moral perfection, taqwa and closeness to Allah. Our Prophet (saas) fulfilled the great responsibility he was given in the best way possible, summoned people to Allahâ€™s path and became the one who guided all believers to Allahâ€™s path. As is known, All-Mighty Allah supported our Prophet (saas) with many miracles from His Sight. Our purpose in this book is to remind people of some of the miracles Allah granted to our blessed Prophet (saas) He made exemplary to all people with his superior morality, profound faith and all his manners and words. By Allahâ€™s leave, throughout his life, our Prophet (saas) showed many miracles to people. Some of these miracles were witnessed only by his followers while some others by a great majority of unbelievers. Some of the miracles of our Prophet (saas) are conveyed in the Qurâ€™an while some others in our Prophetâ€™s (saas) sayings and in various explanations of Islamic scholars. Our purpose is to show our blessed Prophetâ€™s (saas) miraculous aspects to people and to summon them to make the Qurâ€™an and our Prophetâ€™s (saas) Sunnah a guide to themselves.
