The complete Dublin concert of december 18th, 2010 sans the audience talk intermezzo's. But this one has all songs and the quality of the picture is superb. The sound quality is very good. Taped by a member in the audience from the side of the stage. We see everything and sometimes even get a glimpse of what happens backstage..
All credit go to a person calling himself 'flamesniper89' for recording this great concert.
Meat is in topform and the songs are very much enjoyable. This concert shows how great the Hang Cool Tour has been! Grab this!!!!
