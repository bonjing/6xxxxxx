SUMMARY:
Miser Ebenezer Scrooge is awakened on Christmas Eve by spirits who 
reveal to him his own miserable existence, what opportunities he wasted 
in his youth, his current cruelties, and the dire fate that awaits 
him if he does not change his ways. Scrooge is faced with his own 
story of growing bitterness and meanness, and must decide what his 
own future will hold: death or redemption.
