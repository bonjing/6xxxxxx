I strongly suggest using NEOSPEECH JULIE TTS voice pack in combination with JAWS.

because it sounds like a real girl

here is my well seeded torrent.

I'm french man,
I use JAWS in french.
cracks are good for JAWS 1101461 32 bit.
but not for 64 byt.
I test crack of JAWS 11.01447 but it's not working.
In french, There just 2 version.
1461 et 1471.
so for 32 byt it's working but not for 64 byt!
It's possible have crack for 64 bit version? for version 1461 or 1471?
thanks!"

It's been for months now; the latest Jaws update was 12.0.525.
Jaws 11 is beginning to run out of support for new versions of programs like Firefox 4/Messenger2011/IE9; these apps may be supported in Jaws 12 but not in Jaws 11.
I hope the crack is out soon! I can't wait any longer!"
,azer000,2011-04-17T12:41Z,"Yeah, please try and find the crack for version 12, Glitch. I'm counting on you! Internet Explorer 9 and effing Messenger are incompatible with Jaws 11 and the idiotic guys from Microsoft made rolling back to older versions impossible! Please help."
