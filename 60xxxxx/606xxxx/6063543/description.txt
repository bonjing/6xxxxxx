No One Killed Jessica is an upcoming Hindi film starring Rani Mukerji and Vidya Balan, produced by UTV Spotboy and directed by Rajkumar Gupta.
The movie is based on the controversial Jessica Lal murder case.
The title and the script are actually inspired by a headline carried out by The Times Of India in 2006, when the accused in the infamous murder case were acquitted by the lower courts, leading to nationwide protests, reopening of the case and subsequent sentencing of the accused, and not the case per se.
