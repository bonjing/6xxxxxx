Lost Channels was called a "beautiful" album by both Uptown and The Georgia Straight and "pleasantly inoffensive and well-constructed" by Toro. The band's sound was compared to "the jangly folk-pop of Fleet Foxes [and] hushed intimacy of Iron & Wine".

One reviewer praised the album for "some standout songs" and the "obvious" talent of Tony Dekker, but criticized it for forgoing "much of the mystique that made its predecessor [Ongiara] so intriguing" and not having that album's same "lasting appeal". However, the reviewer at the CBC praised the album as being the group's best, saying:

There's a magical, warm quality to the songs on Lost Channels, a richness and collective spirit that hasn't always been present in Great Lake Swimmers' songs. The Swimmers' first two albums, while still lovely, often felt a bit too breakable, that the airy arrangements supporting Dekker's plaintive confessionals might dissolve if you listened too hard. The seeds for a rootsier sound were planted on Ongiara and now they've come into full bloom.
The album was a shortlist nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize.
