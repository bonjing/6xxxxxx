,valiokas,2011-02-12T03:19Z,"could anyone paste some cut of instructions as to how to install apps from pc to jailbroken Iphone, cause i'm having trouble finding anything of use. 
I am not very new to torrent world but this install is killing me.
Thanks in advace"
,valiokas,2011-02-12T17:37Z,"here, i found something my self..it explaned alot fore me:

No, it will not work on non-jailbroken iDevices. You need to jailbreak yuour iTouch or iPhone first.

The simplest way to do that is thru your touch/phone - open Safari and goto www.jailbreakme.com and ""Slide to jailbreak""

Then load up Cydia....then follow these steps.... Cydia -> Manage -> Sources -> Edit -> Add

Enter the link Ã¢â‚¬Å“http://cydia.hackulo.usÃ¢â‚¬Â 

Then add the Appsync addon (this stops iTunes deleting the apps you put on the jailbroken device)

Did these steps and there was no problem with anything. Thanks alot for upload!"

,gallar,2011-03-28T17:44Z,works on 3.0?
,Scopse,2011-03-30T14:14Z,"Thanks alot for sharing this, working great on iOS 4.0 (iPhone 4) Jailbroken with jailbreakme and using Appysync.

Can even download the map correction updates and the text to speech is a nice update over TomTom v1.4 I was using before.

Anyone having problems, you must have a jailbroken device and you must have appsync installed.

Thanks again."
,djernie2,2011-04-06T14:36Z,"Where did Dutch language go?
