,MxGaza33,2011-01-05T22:52Z,"Hi Slicknick, Im dissapointed you wont be uploading the live races in HD. Im fairly certain most people look forward to it in HD, SD looks rubbish! I beg you to reconsider!"

Pity about the live races - I know it's hard work editing them down and splitting the 450 and Lites heats and main events. Supercross is just so much better in HD.

For anyone having trouble playing the 720p files, I would suggest doing a fresh install of VLC player, especially on a lower powered pc. I find VLC player uses less cpu than WMP or Media Player Classic, and if you have a more powerful cpu, you can enable post processing options that can improve the picture quality.

Here's hoping RV has a great season!  "
,slicknick610,2011-01-09T22:21Z,I would like to upload everything in 720p but it would take too long. The files would be over 4 gbs.
,Popgumman,2011-01-15T10:34Z,Thanks for the uploads :)
