,mekilla122,2010-12-27T23:19Z,"hello computer-user
i'm currently downloading this, and i was wondering if you need to put this program on a disk and load it that way. I don't have a disk tray on my laptop, which is what i'm trying to get premium on, and what i'm using now to download. So is there any way to just run the installer from the uploaded files? Do you have to go into the file folder and install the applications seprately?"

,GTR-Mclaren,2011-01-11T01:48Z,"Hey Computer-User.....some questions

Right now I have the Vista 64 bits sp2 OEM....pirate of course xD

the OS install like an OEM...and works like one...even with all the updates and things

but I want W7...so....your version install like an OEM version ?? I mean...write the iso in a disk...boot from disk..select the kind of install...and so ??

and what about the updates ?? my first copy of W7 keep telling me that it was a pirate version...how can I evade that ?? that thing appears in your version ??

sorry for the noob question :)"

No None Of My Operating Systems Are OEM,

All Of My Operating Systems Are Full Retail & Untouched, The Only Thing I Do Is Integrate Windows Updates :)"
,Raventhorn,2011-01-13T13:35Z,"@GTR-McLaren (and anyone with the same question)
To avoid this you have to use either a valid license key, a ""Windows Genuine Activation"" (WGA) hack or a Windows Loader.
As I can see in the file list, at least 2 of these options are provided, the WGA hack (or Activator) and the Windows Loader.

I used a loader myself, and have been running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 for a year now without any problems. Cant say anything about the activators as I havent used them myself"

,kiranrcse,2011-01-23T06:25Z,"How can i install it from USB,,,, since this is an ISO file, Can I copy the contents on to a USB through virtual drive and install it from there.. I want to do an upgrade....."
,frankrock,2011-01-28T06:36Z,"@tokins210: I'm assuming that this was pre-installed on an OEM PC/laptop? (dell/sony etc..) Then the answer is more than likely no. I'm currently download this now, and if the ISO is a geniune Retail image, it's set for a retail serial. You would have to manually edit the ei.cfg located in the ISO. There are plenty of tutorials online on how to do this, maybe use PowerISO to edit the file? But in that file will be about 6 lines or so, one will be [Channel] and underneath will say Retail, change that to say OEM, and you will be good to go. 

I believe you can also see if the serial will work by starting the installation in Windows and it should ask for the CDkey, enter it there, if it works, hey, it works, if not, read the above :]

BTW Great torrent. speedy seeds and it's nice knowing it's an untouched ISO (minus updates)
Thanks!"
,frankrock,2011-01-28T07:43Z,"Yeh, this definately isn't an ""untouched ISO with updates"". It has all the unattended install crap and other stuff he has added to it. I def prefer a clean, crisp retail DVD. oh well. looks like I'll have to try and edit it myself."
