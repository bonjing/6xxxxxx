Thanks for the reply. 

I may have a fancy name but when it comes to IT I am just a greenhorn. 

The world of computers is becoming so complex that even when something seems obvious one can't know 100% sure what to expect, so it's better to ask... not least because the surprises tend to be negative (it's the Murphy's world we live in!).

For example, this being the 21st century, and the Acrobat having reached No. 10 (and adorned itself with a fancy 'X') one would expect proper power in all its functions. In my case, I was hoping to find a decent OCR capability and a useable Read-Out-Loud -- but no!

It's exasperating, how primitive the tech still is. Can you believe the default voice for ReadOutLoud is still that tin-can SAM! And it can't even recognise
end-line hyphens as word-splitters, hence uttering 2 'words' in lieu
of 1 -- this alone makes the function barely usable (on top of the voice itself being insufferable).

The only good point is that it is possible to change the voice to another; I have a preference for NeoSpeech Julie, but this does not solve the problem of non-recognition of word-dividing hyphens, not being able to define pauses (between paragraphs etc.) so I end up having to export/import text into TextAloud...

This problem is even worse in case the source PDF is non-text. I did an OCR on a *hi-resolution* PDF so that I could input text into a Read-Out-Loud prog (TextAloud), but the ACROBAT OCR output text is so bad it's a torture to either read or listen to. With the resultant OCRed text (full of odd characters, misspellings, strings of 2 or 3 words without spaces etc.) the Acrobat's Read-Out-Loud  function is perfectly USELESS, so the only saving grace is that if you transfer the OCRed text into TextAloud, NeoSpeech Julie is usually able to interpret spaceless strings of 2 or 3 words correctly.

Makes one weep, really. And with that sort of non-performance they expect us to PAY for Acrobat?!? I am really thankful for a service like PirateBay so that one can test software and then decide whether to buy or not.
"
,LupinArsene,2011-01-22T19:05Z,"My earlier rant notwithstanding, this prog is not entirely useless when it comes to its main function, the creation of PDF files, so I think I'd like to keep it on the computer since I've already invested so much energy.

This brings me to the activation issues. I decided to use method 2 ""Adobe CS5 All Products Activator by MPT (Fixed)"" because I had read somewhere that this is the only method that might potentially allow future updates, but I don't seem to 'get it'. Do I need to wait for my trial to end and only then run ""Adobe CS5 All Products Activator by MPT (Fixed)""? Essentially my problem seems to be the same as what ArcAngel66 is asking on Page 1, so I hope someone can shed some light on this .. 

Thanks in advance!
