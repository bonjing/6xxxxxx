The prey take off into the bush with a head start, a map and a compass. The
relentless Mantracker is on horseback armed with an arsenal of forensic skills.
The hunted have 36hrs and over 40 kilometers to outrun Mantracker â€“ how they
escape, that's up to them.

This isn't about rules or money - just bragging rights. The prey are looking for
glory and Mantracker is looking for them.
