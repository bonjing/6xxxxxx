Easier Way out if you think this is too much..
Use Revo Uninstaller... Select Waves & click on Un-install.. then after when its done.. Hit the scan option to delete the remaining registry & files & folders associated with it.. Hope this helps.. :) Merry Christmas & a Happy New Year in advance....

Hey many people using older versions having issues & also have to be sure that you have removed all the older versions of waves the way it has been explained... By the what OS are you using.. I believe Windows Xp is it ?? Let me know... Also let me know the Graphics Card that you are using... But people with newer OS & softwares are not having any issues... "
,emmav10101,2011-01-01T05:58Z,"Thanks Creepy for the reply, I'm using WinXP my card is a GeForce 8600 GT, I think you're right though....its probably my old version of Cubase thats not displaying the GUIs properly. Thanks man for your time and help."
,jjfadfurkle,2011-01-09T14:10Z,"this @#$@#$%!$ torrent infects your computer


right when waves installer launched  some fake ""free anti virus"" app with a full gui started running along side the Waves installer.

 ever since then windows update wont work- system restore wont work and other lame stuff you would expect once infected is happening on the system

waves works perfect but you will be hosed"
,Creepy_wonder,2011-01-11T17:17Z,"@ jjfadfurkle... 
Don't post bullshit here... I am personally using it so as hundreds of other users..probably a lot more than that... If that happened with you.. your computer must be infected even before you installed this... & moreover its not created by me.. Its a Team AiR release.. n you don't want to mess with that name... I hope you understand what i mean... anyway.. Play fair always..."

,pheard,2011-01-29T02:15Z,"Nevermind. I figured it out. Once I copied the plugins from the Waves folder chosen during install, into my DAW's plugin folder (along with the waveshell,) and restarted my computer, it was all good. Thanks for the upload."

@skapoosh... yeah for me too.. :) glad you liked it...

@pheard... happy that you could figure it out. sorry couldn't reply to you earlier...

@123break... un-install all previous versions first & follow the guidelines as to how to remove them properly written in the text file... then re-install it... Let me know if that works.. if not . let me know how you are installing it...

Basically i have followed all the guidelines in the read me txt and still getting the error. 

I have installed it as : 

Extract .rar's to desktop. 

Extracted again to desktop (Waves v7 exe)  

Installed to program files/waves & Vst plugins folder in program files/Steinberg/Vst plugins. (As admin & installed new graphics card drivers) 

When installed i can see them in Cubase but every time i load a plug in up it says & cubase crashes : 

'Loadlibrary failed with error 126: The specified module could not be found

Any suggestions or ideas would be much appreciated? 

Thank you for a great upload!!! :) "

Just a good, clean, package. It IS bundles a little fuckey, with a rar inside multiple zips. People do that sometimes, deal.
Huge thanks to the uploader, and remember, if you like the software, buy it! Although in this case, the demo period will be pretty long, the software is a bit pricey."
