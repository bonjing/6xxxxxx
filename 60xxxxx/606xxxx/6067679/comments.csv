,Apneatic,2011-01-01T10:02Z,"Forgive me if this question has a simple answer, but I can't figure this out or find an explanation anywhere. How do I play this file once it's finished downloading? This torrent has lots of individual files...do I need a program to compile everything so it will play back? Thanks for the help."
,savedinak,2011-01-21T01:12Z,You have to use a program such as Corel WinDVD or try downloading K-Lite codec and using the Media Player Classic.... its been awhile since I've had to do it. Google your question if you're still having trouble.
