,rippervanwinkle,2011-01-26T13:55Z,Unfortunately BOZX doesn't do subtitles fully/properly.  There are non-English parts in this movie that require English subs.  But English speakers don't want English subs for the the whole damn movie!  What's required is English subs for the non_English parts.  The full subs track is not a good substitute except for deaf people.  BOZX you did the same thing with tora tora tora.  You notice how few seeds these releases retain even though they are excellent films?  There's your reason.  Thanks for the release and your efforts but without the right subs it's no good.   I'm doing what lots of other people obviously did: deleting this release and finding another version.

,tpbuser8,2012-03-10T10:38Z,Aspect ratio is not 2:35:1 (widescreen with black bars on top and bottom) like LTT rip!
