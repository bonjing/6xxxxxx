Feelin' lonesome this Xmas, I'll shre this bit of treasure with my fellow freebooters.

Ninon Sevilla (one of the great Mexican stars) was actually Cuban, and started out as a dancer. She seems to have talked the Mexicans into doing a truly Cuban movie, even if the location-shots have a Mexican feel. The soundtrack is worth it alone, this is a great collection of Cuban music at the time when it was at its height - not some retropective served up by old men. We get to see how dances like the Limbo were originally performed - more suggestive than nowadays. I read somewhere that Ninon Sevilla, though white, absorbed a lot of black culture though her devotion to Santeria. 

Rita Montaner, one of the most famous cantaoras, appears as herself.

NS most famous movie was Aventurera, but that has already been shown on TCM.
