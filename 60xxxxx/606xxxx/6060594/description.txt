Swedish artist Tobias Froberg has recently spent his time hanging out with friends. Not only did he log production duties the forthcoming offering from Peter Moren- the Peter of Peter, Bjorn and Jon but he spent some time working on his own, third release Turn Heads. His new album features a gaggle of his mates including Peter, Norwegian chanteuse Ane Brun, the heavenly Brit singer songwriter Kathryn Williams, the troubadour Tietur, Existensminumum and TorbjÃƒÂ¶rn Zetterberg (Folke). He even made it a family affair, working with his father, jazz musician Ante FrÃƒÂ¶berg.

Although Froberg invites his buddies along to create music his albums have his personal fingerprints all over them. His first two releases, For Elisabeth Wherever She Is (2004) and Somewhere In the City (2006) are both self produced. Both records are much loved all over the globe, while Elisabeth was nominated for a Swedish Indie Grammy.

But being a renaissance man, not only does Tobias produce and play on his records, he is the drummer for the band Boulevard of Broken Bones AND is a writer. He is, amongst other things, one of the very, very few who got to meet and interview movie director Ingmar Bergman, for a book.
