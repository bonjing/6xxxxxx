,deoed99,2010-12-27T00:08Z,I have sound but most of all talk is on left speaker. In 2 ch mode. All other sound is normal.. I dont think this movie is made this way. Im Using Vlc
,deoed99,2010-12-27T00:21Z,Sorry. I meant the right channel.  Tried Media player classic and have no sound at all. Mayby need to download a newer verson of Vlc..
