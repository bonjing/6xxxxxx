wat did they say in d email??"
,.Leto.,2012-05-02T02:44Z,"Wow! This torrent is almost dead so it took almost 3 days to get it but it was really worth it, quality is amazing. I've downloaded several other 4.5Gb rips of this movie but with ZEKTORM all details are clearly visible. Definition is so much higher here!
Thanks a lot :)"
