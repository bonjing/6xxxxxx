Thanks."

Umm, there is no activation. When you make a payment, they send you an email with a unique link that takes you to the download page. There are several download options, including via bit-torrent and most of the games even have Steam activation codes.

All you needed to do was send them an email if you didn't receive theirs, and they'll send you a free gift code back. Even if you didn't actually pay for it, they'll still send a download link

This is what I had to do with the first bundle, since their email was being blocked by Yahoo's spam filter at the time. I've purchased every bundle since without a hitch.

The only real reason for it to be on TPB would be to make an additional mirror and provide access to the previous Bundles long after they've expired. "
