I know it requires a BluRay disc drive in your PC which I have. Thanks "

,crpearso,2010-12-31T00:36Z,"@Kasse74, the Subtitles are built into the ISO, the subtitles in the folder are for if you view the file on a PC and want subs.

To use the subtitles on your PS3, use the way you turn on subtitles with everything else."

[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-04T13:34Z,"crpearso - Sorry for the late response. I'm touring Europe at the moment, so not online frequently. In answer to your question, all of the software we use is open-source, but if you want a somewhat automated application that will give similar results, I would recommend Dean's MultiAVCHD used in high-quality, 2-pass mode. By the way, no blu-ray drive is needed to read or write the image, a DVD burner will do, it just won't 'autorun' the movie from disk, so browsing to the BDMV/STREAM/00000.m2ts file is the only option for playing from a DVD drive.

kasse74 - Glad you got your issues sorted. If you want to burn the image with different sub's, you will need to remove one subtitle to create disk space for another, and use TsMuxer or a similar application to add your own language choice. It is nowhere near as complicated as it sounds, but it isn't a newbie task either. If you want to just play them on your computer, you will need to find/download the .srt format subtitle of your choice, and load/add them to your media player once the movie is loaded. How you go about doing that will vary with the media player that you are using - for example, with KMplayer, you would just right click the screen, left click 'Load subtitle', browse for the file you downloaded, and click 'OK'.
