,Lucifalle,2011-08-02T20:21Z,"Careful people, I've been playing this game for a while now with no problems, but a recent Avast scan of my computer reports a Win32:Malware-gen in the VELoader.dll game file. I also suspect that this might have been the cause behind strange changes in my firewall settings in regards to this game. I'm deleting this download just to be on the safe side."
