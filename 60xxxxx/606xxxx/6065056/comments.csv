Thanks"
[V],globeplus,2010-12-26T21:27Z,"To sender70 : thank you for the suggestion but the game is to short in size to justify a rip , you donÂ´t need me for that , get this one that is an action adventure point and click with a mysterious ambience with puzzles to solve to keep going on the game ."
