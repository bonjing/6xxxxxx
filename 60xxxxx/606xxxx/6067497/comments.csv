Cant find subtitles, help please."
,Hamashedo,2011-06-06T08:20Z,"Soo, what are we only seeding 3&4 on this one?  Got Saw 3 and 4 at 98.2% and 100% respectively, and then immediately my d/l went from 800 kB/s to 1.4 kB/s. Start seeding everything, maybe? I'm uploading at 50 - 100 kB/s and thats with regular usage and several other things slowing it down.  When I go to sleep, after I get this, I'll seed at 600+ kB/s, and I'll seed this 5 times over. But, first, I'd have to get the damned thing. So seed, please. Thank you."

V- Varies by scene and movie, 3 - 7 at best.
