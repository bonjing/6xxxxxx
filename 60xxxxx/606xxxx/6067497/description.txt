The franchise revolves around the fictional character of John Kramer, 
also called the "Jigsaw Killer" or simply "Jigsaw." He was introduced 
briefly in Saw and developed in more detail in Saw II. Rather than 
killing his victims outright, Jigsaw traps them in situations that he 
calls "tests" or "games," to test their will to live through physical 
or psychological torture. Despite the fact that Kramer was murdered in 
Saw III, the films continue to focus on the posthumous effects of the 
Jigsaw Killer and his apprentices by exploring his character via flashbacks.
