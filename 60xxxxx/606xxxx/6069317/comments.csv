[V],twentyforty,2010-12-28T16:03Z,@himansu_007: Nope. That's not a movie. LOL... No.
,DSIN,2010-12-28T16:39Z,"Thanx For the movie...
R requests open???"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-28T17:09Z,"@DSIN: You probably have seen my ""till January 6th"". Then... but one-two per week would be encoded and upped. I am nice, but not stupid. And - I do not like to be ass-raped, by gang of raving lunatics.

In fact, last week made me thinking to pull the plug out. Had 28172 downloads and fucking 27864 pure Hit&Runs (without seeding a byte back)."
,nitrogun,2010-12-28T18:42Z,"Dear 20-40 - think this way rather....

Iy you lived in a small town of 28172 souls, and you could count 308 of them as friends, then you would be considered a well-loved person. 
Many of us feel privileged to have 5 good and true friends in a city of a million. So your ratio is really not as bad as it might seem. "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-28T19:58Z,"@nitrogun: It's not about me, never was and never be. Number of Hit&Runs tell us who are the people in your imaginary town. They TAKE something for good. Got that?

Every-fucking-thing CAN be depleted. Everything is limited in quantity. Only Oprah thinks differently about love, but we know that wasn't true. Everything has limited supply. Every damn thing.

If I seed 150 files (in average) - it is crucial that majority SHARE what has been given. If they give (pass to others) just a part of what has been given - people who are behind can get something of that and - pass that through to others and so on and on.

If majority are fucking hard-fisting bastards - they fill their bellies, their mouths and pockets - and RUN away. They take and they go - and what has been taken - sooner than later WOULD RUN OUT.

Let suppose that I run a cinema in your imaginary town, OK? And - I run movies one after another, day by day - for free.

But - there are some limits: My imaginary  Theater has limited number of seats, right?

And these seats has been occupied by the same bunch of local hooligans, bastards, small-time thieves, punks and idiots. They take a dump here and there and take a piss whenever they like and wherever they like. 

Well, these bastards took the seats - they occupied the cinema like what Nazis did to Poland.

And I should be lucky seeing how decent folk, who love seeing movies but cannot go to theaters 'cause they are too poor to pay the tickets stays out, occasionally shouting ""let us in, get these punks out"", ""we wanna see that movie too"".

They keep decent folk out - all the good people  I am doing this for...

I have opened my doors because of them and not for the punks and their  shit."

p.s: iÂ´ll be sharing!"
,DSIN,2010-12-29T04:59Z,"@20-40- pardon my english.. but does that mean u'll do 1 or 2 requests per week??
btw u r right ... if i upload a movie & more than 90% ppl hit & run.. i'd never share on that site again.. & u r uploading for idk how many years now..
hats off to u man... :)"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-29T08:57Z,"@zakimar: As I said to muthineni (2nd Comment) - I don't have it anymore.

@DSIN: Probably I would go above that, if I spot even shred of understanding that this is NOT a download service, but file SHARING site.

@ks85: I am nice to normal people and definitely much older than people think  I am. Also, I am in all this shit from dawn of time (bought first computer in autumn of 1983.) and even though - I am rather surprised with constant degradation of humanity in general. WWW is just a pinnacle of that."
,ks85,2010-12-31T19:36Z,"I do agree with you in that matter... Mr. 20-40 cof cof (respect to the elder) :)
Happy new year,

Best regards,
K."
