This is no reflection on the upload, just a heads up to those, like myself, who may get caught out"
,MitsEvX,2010-12-27T12:48Z,Indeed a great upload! Thanks! :D
,suzuki600srad,2010-12-27T16:17Z,"thanks for this, i know the film got slatted, but i want to make my own mind up, it seems that alot of people liked the second instalment, i thought it was the worst of the lot. cheers for the up dude."

Bummer was wanting to see this."

,Heesten,2011-01-14T20:26Z,"Do not download this one, its REALLY slloooooow!"
,hyeguy123,2011-01-17T18:00Z,"Will TsMuxer be abler to turn this into an avchd dvd9 or dvd5 disk?

Just wondering because a lot lately, when I've been trying to make my hd mkv files into avchd disks, TsMuxer has been rejecting them stating some sort of error that the files aren't formatted correctly or something like that."
,bluntdrunk024,2011-02-16T00:36Z,"This Torrent is, in fact, watched.  I got a DMCA notice from someone using my router.  Tracked the file in the email to this torrent, as well as the ""3-d"" version, and another bluray one.  I didn't even get to watch it, and I already got a notice.  This ones hot."
