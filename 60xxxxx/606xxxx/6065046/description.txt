Mysteries of the Bible: Cain and Abel

Their story is one of the most chilling in the Bible: a tale of cold- blooded murder between the world's first brothers. But while Genesis records the identity of Abel's killer, the world's first death remains, in essence, a mystery. What compelled Cain to kill his only brother? How did he do it? Did Cain realize that he was capable of ending Abel's life? And what of the strange paradoxes in the scripture: Cain's fear of strangers in an unpopulated world and the sudden appearance of a future wife? In this fascinating investigation, modern scholars work like detectives, searching for clues in the 17 verses that describe humanity's first tragic crime and explore its ultimate message of resiliency and hope.
