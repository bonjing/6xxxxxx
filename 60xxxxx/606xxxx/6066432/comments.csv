,stratoman,2010-12-26T20:23Z,Where are the seeders? Something wrong with the Torrent? 
,Ryan_16_Thorn,2010-12-30T06:14Z,Need seeders ! plz
,Blackout1051,2010-12-30T20:45Z,The reason there are no seeders is because this torrent was just uploaded. Right now its just the uploader seeding. in a few days there should be many more.................hopefully.
,Blackout1051,2010-12-31T08:03Z,"Looking at the peer list almost everybody is stuck at 53% could the original uploader turn there computer back on, and anyone has the complete file please seed (i doubt anyone else has the complete file)."
,karel001,2010-12-31T09:51Z,Where are the f*cking seeder 
,Blackout1051,2010-12-31T14:59Z,Original Uploader Seed!!! everyone is strugling to download this. At the moment everyone is at 53.8%
,whodafak,2011-01-01T16:49Z,seeding now.. got problems with my internet bf.. thanks
,Beathovens,2011-01-28T19:37Z,THANKS!
,codak29,2011-02-20T22:39Z,128k bitrate? Why is it so hard for some people to rip at decent quality? Or at least state the bitrate so I don't waste my time.
,purplefb,2011-02-23T17:53Z,"Why are some people so ungrateful, complaining about this or that - what we should all be doing is offering thanks to the uploader who bothered to put it up in the first place

So... thanks for the upload."
,StoneBoneDrew,2011-03-14T23:18Z,"I'll seed as long as possible! I'm getting 800 kb/s! Thanx for the upload \../,"
,StoneBoneDrew,2011-03-14T23:20Z,"800 kb/s! Keep seeding! \../,"
,Hardak,2011-05-09T09:05Z,Is this mp3 or FLAC? It looks aweful small for a discography. Please provide more info.
,sensemanifold,2011-07-09T17:14Z,"Awesome upload/download.  This is a great archive of a great band, and the DL speed was dabomb.com!"
,WushuTricks,2011-08-02T22:49Z,Why only 128kbps? This isn't the early 2000's anymore.
,mattiblack,2011-09-29T02:48Z,128k is fine for PC or portable - FFS this is a 1GB discography - if you listen and particularly like an album then get it in FLAC or APE.
,bil_gr7,2012-01-23T14:29Z,128 is crap. Who listens to 128 anymore? Erase that shit.
,JoabW,2012-03-27T00:04Z,"Thanks for this. If you don't like the 128 then dl another torrent. I want my music portable it's just not realistic to have files x4 the size.
THANKS WHODAFAK"
