,WhosYa Daddy,2011-01-29T21:02Z,"I cant make this work. I followed the instuctions. Mount game, install game, install patch, copy bin and activation to game folder, run activation-->play. 
When I try to run the game, the ""Start"" button is greyed out, and I cant start it. 
Help please."
,WhosYa Daddy,2011-01-30T12:16Z,"Never mind. Put the activator in the bin folder and run it, ya`ll be good.
Terrible instuctions from the uploader by the way ^.^ "
