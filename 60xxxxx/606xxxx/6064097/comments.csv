Quieter moments fair just fine, but those involving action (i.e. explosions, large vehicles and lots of background noise) have the quality of being passed through a tin can. Not really sure what happened here; if not for the audio, this would be a great upload."

A-4!
Good picture but tried the file on 2 different LCD's and sound is muffled and sounds like you are watching with earplugs in. What a waste of my time!"
