,amartya61,2010-12-24T07:13Z,watch the movie !!! its in great high qualiy !!! seed plzzz
,Saki33,2011-01-03T18:24Z,"Seed? I wish. I have a 2.054 overall share ratio and after a day only have 1.3% from 33 peers, and none with 100% online. I am only able to connect to 10 of the 33 peers, all of whom have the same percentage I have. It's a pity since this is the only high res at a reasonable size. Unless the uploader begins sharing it, there is little chance this torrent will not die. This one hasn't been up long, so it seems that once again the first ones just grabbed it and got off. Typical ingrates."
,Saki33,2011-01-03T21:37Z,"It really is pathetic. Only keeping it in my torrents because it isn't taking up much space and out of curiosity. Someone new starts downloading and downloads relatively fast, until they gather 32 MB and then it is over because that is all that anyone has. I am currently connected to 12 other peers and no one has more than that. Fuggedaboutit! Not going to happen unless uploader comes back online with it, but appears he has abandoned it, and not even assuming he ever uploaded 100% of it. Possible that he watched leecher after leecher jump off almost as soon as they completed and got pissed and said the H with it. Have done that myself; seed an upload until I have uploaded 500% only to see people taking and not seeding. I just finally stopped doing it, and I never ever got thanked. Oh well, who cares?"
,Saki33,2011-01-04T16:59Z,"Latest update is that one seeder came online for a short time and then went offline again. Highly unlikely anyone will ever complete this one unless amartya61 seeds it again. This uploader started several torrents on the same day, maybe too many for him, and maybe overextended his bandwidth.

With BitChe I found a 3.98 GB Director's Cut that has five seeders at the moment. It's an m2ts file, recognized by both WMP and VLC, but not by my Samsung tv's player. I renamed the file extension and it played.

That was the smallest high res version I could find that actually had seeders. Unless the uploader comes back, you will never succeed with this one."
,Saki33,2011-01-04T20:20Z,"Here it is. It's for PS3, but it will play on just about anything. Change the file extension if you need to. 
Terminator 2 Judgement Day DC 1080p AC3 5 1ch HDDVD PS3  3.99 GB
8 seeders 5 leechers
I found it with BitChe but you can find it at btjunkie.
I've already downloaded and it's excellent quality."
