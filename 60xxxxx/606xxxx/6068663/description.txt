Work Done



Well i want to thank Serenity and IMAGINE for the video and audio.Onto the work done.

To begint with it was heavy in red then it was to dark.So i lowered the red and adjusted 

the gama in it.Then it was onto the saturation heavy on that too so adjusted that also.

The file had signs of macroblocks so i used a macroblock filter to take out as much as i 

could but be warned there is some left but light.It also had 3 spots with glitches in it 

so i cut those out they were very small about 3 seconds each.Hope you all enjoy.BDK
