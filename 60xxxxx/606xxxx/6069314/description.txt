synopsis:

Cee Bee Beaumont, girlfriend of rock n\\\' roll star Lonnie Lord, is kidnapped by the dastardly Chain Gang, forcing Lonnie to take action. He and his friend Titus Twimbly transform themselves into the masked marvels Rat Pfink & Boo Boo, the champions of down-trodden, harassed and just plain put-upon women and children everywhere. Unleashing their trusty metal steed The Ratcycle, the dynamic duo begin their search for Cee Bee, checking out go-go parties where rock n\\\' roll-besotted youth dance the watusi. Narrowly escaping many dangers, Rat Pfink & Boo Boo defeat the Chain Gang and rescue Cee Bee, but their pleasure in a job well down is cut short when they are threatened by Kogar the Ape, who has escaped from a local zoo. After defeating the rampaging primate, the three are the celebrants at a parade held in their honor. \\\"Rat Pfink a Boo Boo\\\" is a Crime-Stoppers Textbook classic that proves that the American Way always triumphs over vice in the end.
