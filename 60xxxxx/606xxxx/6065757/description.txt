JOHN BRIM ICE CREAM MAN
Released: 1994

Format:Mp3@320

John Brim (April 10, 1922 â€” October 1, 2003) was a Chicago blues guitarist, songwriter and blues harp player. 

Brim picked up his early guitar licks from the gramophone records of Tampa Red and Big Bill Broonzy, before venturing first to Indianapolis in 1941 and Chicago four years later. He met his wife Grace in 1947; fortuitously, she was a capable drummer and harmonica player who played on several of Brimâ€™s records. She was also the vocalist on a 1950 single for the Detroit based Fortune Records, that signaled the beginning of Brimâ€™s discography.

Brim recorded for Random Records, J.O.B. Records, Parrot Records (the socially aware â€œTough Timesâ€), and Chess Records (â€œRattlesnake,â€ his answer to Big Mama Thorntonâ€™s â€œHound Dogâ€ was pulled from the shelves by Chess for fear of a plagiarism lawsuit). All of his 1950s recordings for the Chess label were later included on the compilation LP/CD â€œWhose Muddy Shoesâ€ (which also included the few recordings Elmore James made for the label; because they share this LP/CD, it has sometimes been assumed that they performed or recorded together, but this is not the case.) On some tracks Little Walter played the harmonica, whilst Jimmy Reed, Snooky Pryor, or James Dalton were also featured blowing the harp. Cut in 1953, the suggestive â€œIce Cream Manâ€ had to wait until 1969 to enjoy a very belated release. Brimâ€™s last Chess single, â€œI Would Hate to See You Go,â€ was waxed in 1956 with a combo consisting of Little Walter, guitarist Robert Lockwood, Jr., bassist Willie Dixon, and drummer Fred Below.
