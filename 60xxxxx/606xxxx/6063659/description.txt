Heart of the Alien

=============

Heart of the Alien is a sequel to Another World and continues the story directly from where the original ended.

The game switches the player's role from Another World; this time the player takes control of Buddy, the main character's alien ally from the previous game.

=============

The game was released in the 1994 for Sega CD; but it has been ported to PC with the name of Heart of the Alien Redux.

See here:
http://hota.sourceforge.net/

This package puts together the iso of original CD; the original audio tracks (in .mp3) and Heart of the Alien Redux compiled for Win32.

So, to use you just need to unpack and start hota.exe from its folder.

I noticed a mistake in the readme.txt I wrote: the --scale=2 option does work full-screen. Only the --scale=3 does not.

So once you saw the introduction you probably want start the game with:

hota.exe --scale=2 --fullscreen --room 7

So you get full-screen game scaled with x2 algorithm, --room 7 instead skips the introduction.


=============

Keys:

Alt-Enter - change between windows and full-screen.

Arrows    - left, up, right, down.

After the intro (or after skipping it with ESC) you will be in the code screen. To begin you have to select a level via password.

The first level code is:
