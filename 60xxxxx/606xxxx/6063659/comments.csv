,wtfgamer,2010-12-27T08:31Z,wow. rare classic. thanks.
,etpirateb,2010-12-27T10:21Z,"Yeah, this should be fairly rare.

Even if Heart of the Alien Redux works fairly well it is not documented and it is not famous. So it is easy to get stuck with meaningless error messages like `cannot open GAME3.bin'.

In order to help everyone (and learn something about Win32 cross-compiling) I puzzled how-to start everything and make a ready to use package.

Since there are no hate messages I assume it works fine.


Happy to see someone that appreciate."
