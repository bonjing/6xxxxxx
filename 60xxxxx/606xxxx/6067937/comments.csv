,SKS-TPB,2011-03-23T11:17Z,this was SHIT
,EdgeRatedR,2011-05-10T04:48Z,"i dont know why but when i downloaded this and i opened my download folder to watch it, windows explorer iwas not responding and then it restarted by itself. i downloaded this twice to make sure it was it what caused this and it is. the only way to fix it was to remove the movie from utorrent. it doesnt look like a virus though or anything. just weird."
,EdgeRatedR,2011-05-10T04:52Z,apparently from what ive read online its the divx format which fucks up my windows explorer. its the first time its happening though. so no worries about the download
