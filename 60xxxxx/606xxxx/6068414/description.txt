On August 14th and 15th, 2010 Phish played their 12th and 13th shows at Alpine Valley Music Theater - all 2-night stands since 2003. \\\"Alpine\\\" as it is affectionately known, is a steeply-sloping amphitheater with a big lawn and raucous crowd perpetually bursting with energy right in the band\\\'s faces due to the angles of the place. The angles all aligned on Saturday August 14th - the focus of the Alpine Valley DVD.

This box set features the complete August 14th, 2010 performance on 2-DVDs, as well as 2-CDs, and bonus video featuring highlights from the following night, August 15th, 2010, including AC/DC Bag, Divided Sky and Stealing Time From The Faulty Plan. The three-song combination that opened set two of the 15th rounds out the bonus material with Ghost > Theme From The Bottom > Big Black Furry Creature From Mars. Alpine Valley 2010 combines into a four-hour DVD-CD collection of must-see and must-hear release from Phish at their current top form.

The nearly three hours of music was recorded that night using 57 channels of digital multitrack and carefully mixed and mastered in 5.1 Dolby surround and PCM stereo. The video was a 7-camera shoot (16:9 widescreen), recorded and post-edited in High Definition.
