One of the finest vocal harmony groups operating in Jamaica in the 70s, Mighty Diamonds consisted of Donald Shaw, Lloyd Ferguson and Fitzroy Simpson and were famed for their sweet harmonies and soulful style. This, their debut album, comprises songs that were massive hits for the band in 1975 and 1976, such as the stepping classic "Right Time" and the rocking "I Need a Roof". Recorded in the legendary Channel One Studio and backed by The Revolutionaries, featuring Sly Dunbar's whip-crack drumming and Robbie Shakespeare's distinctive bass style, every tune on this album is a rock-steady classic, combining some of the tightest reggae around with mellifluous yet sternly righteous rasta vocals. No surprise then that Right Time is regarded as an essential roots reggae album. --Duncan Thomson
