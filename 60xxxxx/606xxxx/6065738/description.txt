[quote][color=deepskyblue]In the 1960s, many musicians on both sides of the Atlantic picked up acoustic guitars and sought to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Woody Guthrie. Some went on to have chart success, fewer have maintained successful recording careers to this day, and hardly any have managed to evolve with the times, taking on the best innovations of others while continuing, themselves, to be innovative.
In the USA there's Bob Dylan, and in the UK there's Ralph McTell. In the 1980s and 1990s it was not always easy for such troubadours to find a place in the contemporary music scene; too poetic and relevant for "middle of the road" or AOR, but not quite comfortable in the folk scene.
