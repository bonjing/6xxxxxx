"Finally" is a 1991 song by the musician CeCe Peniston. A dance mix of this song was made, and this remixed version was used in many dance music compilations. "Finally" became Peniston's first (and biggest) hit song, peaking at number five on the US Hot 100 in January 1992 and becoming her only U.S. top-ten hit to date. Prior to that, it was also successful on the US Dance chart, where it spent two weeks at number one in late 1991. In addition, the song peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart in a remixed version.

In 1997, "Finally" was remixed by Eric Kupper to enhance the overseas issue of singer's 92's album Finally, which was re-released along with her greatest collection The Best Of CeCe Peniston, only in Europe and the Japan.

The new remixed version of the song entitled "Classic Funk Mix" (aka "Finally '97) successfully re-entered the British charts, peaking on September 13 at number twenty six in UK Singles Chart, and brought Peniston record of having three chart entries with the one and the same title (in March 92, in September 97).
