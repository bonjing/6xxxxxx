Freedom Scientific JAWS 11.0.1471 32bit (by Glitch)


Hello to the pirates of this world, this is Glitch,

Here is the 32 bit crack for JAWS 11.0.1471.
The installation and cracking instructions are
similar as in my previous releases.  Once again, I am
not the creator of the crack.  However, I hold the
packaging, batch file, and installation guide to my
name.  The installation guide is included in the .7z
archive file.

After the torrent download is complete, extract the
archive with 7-Zip File Manager.  To download the
File manager, visit www.7-zip.org and download the
latest version.

As usual, questions or comments, post them here.

Enjoy.


Signed,
Glitch


PS. Regarding the crack for JAWS 12, the status on my
end is still a negative.  As soon as I find it, I
will send out an announcement to the list.  But, if
you find it before I do, kindly let me know and I
will issue that announcement and spread it to the
blind pirates of this world.  Thank you.  ~Glitch

JAWS (an acronym for Job Access With Speech) is a screen
reader, a software program for visually impaired users,
produced by the Blind and Low Vision Group at Freedom
Scientific of St. Petersburg, Florida, USA.

Its purpose is to make personal computers using
Microsoft Windows accessible to blind and visually
impaired users. It accomplishes this by providing the
user with access to the information displayed on the
screen via text-to-speech or by means of a Braille
display and allows for comprehensive keyboard
interaction with the computer.
