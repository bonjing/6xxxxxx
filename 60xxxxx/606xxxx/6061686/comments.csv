I do the upgrade from 11.0.1461 to 11.0.1471 and it works! All my settings are preserved!"
[T],mp3pro1986,2010-12-29T22:43Z,"Hello Glitch

Thank you for all your great work.
Jaws is a very expensive program and when you are blind, you really need it.

It is nice that you will keep jaws somewhat up-to-date. I look forward for the 11.0.1476 crack or the 12.0 crack.

Happy sharing in 2011!"

Can anybody upload the Mobile speak V 4.6 crack?"

I agree with mp3pro1986, Jaws is very expensive and you are a lifesaver for many of my blind friends who canÂ´t afford to buy an original."

,lgwolf58,2011-02-14T21:47Z,"Hello.  Like the others here, I do deeply appreciate the work that those who make these cracks available do for us.  This is something I simply cannot afford to buy!

Having said that, I do need to ask a question.  Is there currently a crack. of any version, that will work  on a W7, 64 bit system?  I've tried two, but neither worked.  Any help I could get would be seriously appreciated!

Thanks, guys!
