All your old stuff will be moved to a folder called Windows.old after it's done, simply move them all back ;)

Oh and to those of you worried about viruses. MSE did find 2 or 3, but they only showed up because they are keygens/adware. Nothing malicious AT ALL. Certainly no trojans.

Those are in the ""File Sharing Programs"" and ""Extra Activation Programs"" folders. You don't need them anyway.

Had this for almost a year now, Have to say, No problem at all. 
At first i did have a problem, Getting it to recognize itself as Genuine. First i removed the genuine recognition software by using the programs provided in this download. Then, I used the activator ( forgot which one,sorry ) Then, I updated my Windows 7 with the  latest updates with the Windows Update, Then, after that i went to check where the windows activation part should be, and it was genuine. All good from then. Nothing fucking up like black screen that says ""this version of windows is not genuine"" like other people sometimes have."

I've been using it for my BOOTCAMP on my mac and its perfect!

Just wondering though, I've done windows update but didn't include the one you said not to and there are more updates. How many more do I have to look out for and ignore?

Thanks
