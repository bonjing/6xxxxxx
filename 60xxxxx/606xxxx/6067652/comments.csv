,triste2k,2011-12-22T18:21Z,"Please please please, when creating this kind of torrents there is no real benefit compressing the files. Torrent protocol is _designed_ for big files. If I want to seed and still see this films, I will need to wast double of the space to actually uncompress and still seed the files. Thanks"

,GothBoy8,2012-06-04T09:27Z,"Don't download, it's missing Four Rooms and From Dusk Till Dawn. And half of these movies shouldn't even be here. And I wouldn't really count the movies that he produced as part of his ""Filmography"". And it's missing half of them too. "
