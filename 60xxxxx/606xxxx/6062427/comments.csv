,Bshroom,2010-12-29T17:39Z,"Thanks for the encoding work m8. Really takes alot of tweaking and time to get a movie into such a small package, and still have it look good.

Those encoders with pre set settings for dummies work ok, but usually you need good old tweaking of settings and know-how. Sometimes they even make the portable files larger than the original.

So a big thank you to Twentyforty, for his time and effort. Well done. :-)"
