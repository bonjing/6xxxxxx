I came across this CD via Avax, and really want it in hard copy.  Alas, it seems to have been discontinued, and there are the usual reseller scum on Amazon trying to get $100+ for it!  Hmpf.  What better justification do we need for torrents? :)

This is an outstanding recording of some well-known items from the repertoire.  The medieval.org link below gives a listing of the choir members, and there are some really big names in there.  Beautiful balance and tone. Beautiful acoustic.  Convincing interpretations.  Frankly, perfection.

Allegri's Miserere is the highlight here : it is not quite the same as the version we are all so used to ...
