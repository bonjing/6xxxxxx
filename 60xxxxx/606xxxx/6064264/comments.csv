,js1972,2011-11-08T05:51Z,"Dear peeps, FLAC is lossless, and it keeps the source files whole and uncompressed which is better for trading. Pick up the free Traders Little Helper program or something to convert and compress FLAC files easily to any bit rate of .mp3 you want. As far as trading goes, lossless keeps the music the same as it is on the source CD. So, thanks for upping the FLAC here."
