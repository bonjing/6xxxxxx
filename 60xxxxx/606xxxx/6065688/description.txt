This project started in 2002, first to make a liveCD with 3D drivers and free games, then becomes an original linux distribution (doesnt' depend of other distros). LinuxConsole is an original distro, it aims to be innovative. It was the first linux distro to have 3D enabled on liveCD, a great work was done to install it safely from Windows (95 to vista), and now the jukebox makes customized livecd/liveusb very easy to build.
