This performance by Jewel is phenomenal and probably the greatest I've ever heard from her!


I had a much better quality audio source for this, so I took the time to re-make the audio from the previous upload here while I remastered:

(It was a bit of a pain because the tracks were split for CD Audio. I had to sync each file up, but it was well worth it!)



This file has much better audio that I re-muxed so thank you so much to the original uploader and enjoy this better audio version available here now!!! I had been looking for this for about 10 years now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!

If you listen closely, you can hear the VHS "rumbling" in the original. This file contains none of that, and is much "cleaner". Good job to me, lol!

IMPORTANT NOTE: The original file (and this file too) is out of original aspect ratio. I recommend one of two things:

1) Re-encode the video to 4:3 aspect ratio.

2) Use Media Player Classic Home Cinema to set the aspect ratio to 4:3 (Video frame | Override Aspect Ratio | 4:3) while watching.


Merry Christmas, enjoy and please seed!
