Don't download!"" ""It's a virus!!"" I just get the sound, no picture! Fuck you uploader! don't download this shit!"" and I could go on for hours :p don't get me wrong, if people post something like: ""I can't seem to work this out, can somebody help me out?"" then I and many others would be fine to help out :) but posting shit just because of incompetence?! humility will help you a lot ;) just saying :)"

,yokillernick,2011-06-05T16:12Z,why do those lionsgate people use so many big words i could barely understand what they wanted but anyway thxs for upload
,foreveralone,2011-07-12T13:36Z,"Of a curious note some of the swarms on this torrent are infected by mpaa snoop shit, also fun fact about peerblock, it currently blocks over 1billion ip addresses for the normal user (that's 1/4th of every ipv4 address their is)
Also on their site it says 2.4 billion ip addresses in their entire block list, that's OVER HALF of every ip address (in ipv4) 90% of which are to obviously NOT anti-p2p mobs
Extremezone and the group responsable for the release are not at fault, just be careful when downloading this one.

Scared the crap out of me when i got that warning, gonna lay low for now, lol jk, not rly."
