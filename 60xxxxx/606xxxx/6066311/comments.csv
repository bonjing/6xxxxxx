Though thank you for upping this one."
,masterac,2010-12-26T19:30Z,"NOT a BR-RIP, look like R5, if this is the BR, someone forgot to turn on the ""focus"" button lol.

not sharp enough"
[V],neon,2010-12-26T19:57Z,@masterac ....STFU you idiot
,djbigjohn1963,2010-12-27T00:21Z,"Watchable! Picture-8 Sound-10 if others are worried by reviews then this would be the copy to download as it's near perfect quality and the sound is great, Thanks Neon Rainbow for taking the time to upload, have a great holiday BJ"
,masterac,2010-12-27T10:05Z,"dude, i am comparing your screen http://www.rapidhdd.com/images/134453vlcsnap-2010-12-26-15h15m04s181.png to the R5 i download december 9th (Skyline 2010 R5 XviD AC3-FLAWL3SS), and i see no difference.
(time : 26:05), so either way the movie is suppose to be blurry or something wen't wrong when you rip it.

but thx for the STFU, always appreciate that kind of argument."
,hairyassapeman,2010-12-27T11:47Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Hope it isn't blurry like the one dude said. Very much appreciate the up, though."
[V],neon,2010-12-27T11:57Z,ok masterac i take it back...just read the info :)
