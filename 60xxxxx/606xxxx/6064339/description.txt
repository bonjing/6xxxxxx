Cole has admitted that she should not have released 'I Ain't Thru' as the lead single. She stated, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The label didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really want to drop the record because they knew Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ that people wanted a more intense, soulful record from me about love and I really should have followed (their) direction,Ã¢â‚¬Â she said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“But I wanted that to be a statement record. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like saying, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m doing me, you know. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have no regrets for nothing that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m doing.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â
