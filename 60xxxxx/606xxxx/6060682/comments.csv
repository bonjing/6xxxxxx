,User897,2010-12-24T10:33Z,"You are wrong.  This is the Special Edition version, not the original from 1983.  Get your facts straight.  The version of the film here is from 2004 or 2006, which means it is from the 1997 Special Edition, plus tweaks made to the film in 2004 for the first DVD release and then the repackaged DVD in 2006.  Your description even states ""(special edition)"", so before you call me a spammer, you might want to check your fucking facts.  As it stands, your torrent is incorrectly named."
,questionsleepZ,2010-12-24T22:36Z,Yeah dude. User897 is completely right.
