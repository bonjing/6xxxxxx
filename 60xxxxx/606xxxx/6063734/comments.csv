When I am installing it requite register so can you tell me how to fill register or any serial need?

Thanks"
,lazdplace,2010-12-28T00:42Z,This is a scam.  A spyware.  STAY AWAY!
,shandriswc,2010-12-28T15:09Z,"Hey lazdplace, you're totally WRONG. The program is not a scam.

Get off you real scammer!"
,tfowler7,2010-12-30T13:50Z,"sciou,

A serial number was not required in my install,
I used a standard business name to register and
had no problem,
If this causes install problems, let me know.
Thanks,

,yellowbeard68,2011-06-09T20:13Z,THANK YOU tfowler7! Program works perfectly (windows 7 64 bit) I put in a bogus name on register and skipped all the other info and it accepted just fine - also it auto updated and I have run it twice now and watched a couple of training sessions with no problems. Thanks again!
,glanzend,2012-01-29T15:27Z,"Thanks tfowler for sharing this with us.
But I have a problem after I installed the program and clicked ISI Launcher.exe there is this notification box which said :""This application cannot run with out a valid serial number""
How can I solved this since I've already fill all the registration box, but still couldn't run the program "
