PLOT

Based on the first of seven books by acclaimed Australian
author, John Marsden, Tomorrow When The War Began is the story
of seven teenagers who return from a week-long camping trip to
find that Australia has been invaded by a foreign power

Banding together to fight gurellia-style agaist the enemy
this is not a typical heroic war movie - it is a terrifying
situation where they must sometimes use little more than a
knife or a belt to murder a soldier in cold blood. It's a
graphic tale of the violence, the blood, the fear, and the
insanity of war

These kids are underdogs, they're not going to win the war
they're more likely to end up dead in a ditch than send the
enemy retreating, but it's their land, their parents and
friends in prison camps. They give a damn and they'd rather
die fighting than give up
