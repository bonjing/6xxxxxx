thanx"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-28T03:37Z,"If the torrent it slow, make sure you are uploading to at least 25 Kb/s as you get priority once you have uploaded the previous piece. Thank you.
"
,alirasheed,2010-12-29T22:42Z,"Please seed... its impossible to wait for 37 weeks for only season 6,5+extras"
,VirgilCan,2010-12-29T23:28Z,"Thanks for the upload however this is horribly slow.
I am uploading at 50 Kb/s and looks like its going to take 5 days to pull down series 6 only :("
,knightrider1989,2010-12-30T23:52Z,hi Sniffer_V i just wanted to congratulate u firstly on this high quality torrent but at the same time urge for more seeders..i have been trying to download this for a few days now but there are litteraly no seeds at all!! :(
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-31T10:33Z,"It's uploading at 85 Kb/s at the moment. It's worth the wait. I appreciate it's taking a long time but it's got twice the files the normal ones have got. Stay strong, not long now."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-31T11:18Z,I've just upgraded my internet connection to 50Mb. It is now uploading at 200 Kb/s. Won't be long now.
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-31T22:12Z,"If you click on the trackers tab on Utorrent you'll see at present there is only 1 seed, me. It's uploading at 200 Kb/s so it's ploughing through it. Won't be long now until it's done. Please everyone, when it's done seed for as long as possible."
,tazi76321,2010-12-31T23:39Z,"even if it's terribly slow,i just wanna say a big thanks from Algeria.
I'm a huge fan of lost and what you've uploaded is exactly what i've been missing.
A big thanks again"
,tazi76321,2010-12-31T23:45Z,"I forgot one thing,when it's done i will seed as long as possible cause this torrent is just awesome."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-31T23:47Z,"tazi, thanks. Greetings from sunny England. :)"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-01T00:22Z,Yeah it does that. Mine's showing 65 seeds. I think that just means that there is enough already uploaded for 65 complete seeds. Unfortunately they've not all got different bits so they haven't got a complete seed between them. Click on Peers and you'll see there are plenty of people with 70%+ but only me with 100%. When they get the other 29% there will be loads of seeds. It's such a large file that it seems to be taking forever. As soon as we have some proper seeds the speed will shoot up. I'm still uploading between 180-200 Kb/s and will continue to do so until it's all been done many times over.  
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-01T01:50Z,"JrEye, if you like that kind of stuff, click on my username and you'll see a few more tv shows that I've done. All in HD and all have all the available extra's too. The Soprano's is a good one as is Dexter."
,elvis-nl,2011-01-01T13:09Z,"not bad only a few days in and already a good ammount of leechers. :D
We need original seeders please.
The contents looks great.

Holland @ the TOP :P"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-01T21:07Z,"All the tv shows I upload are the highest quality available on the net. I usually use DVD's but if not available I use HDTV rips. I always put on as much extra stuff as is out there too. Definitely worth downloading if you like complete series and all the behind the scenes stuff. Next up, The Wire when Lost has finished. We're at 90%+ now. Lost will be finished today."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-04T01:46Z,"I've just started downloading this to see how fast it is now it's got seeds, I got 5Mb/S, the first time I've ever had it. Woo, thanks guys, keep seeding.   "
,Adrianzr1,2011-01-04T05:11Z,"hi buddies, i'm trying to download this torrent but it's too slow, hope i can download it soon to seed it =)"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-04T06:37Z,"It's got a lot of files, everything available is in it. It was very quick for me when I tried it earlier. I'm still seeding it and there's quite a few now. Stick with it, it's a great show and the files are great quality too."
,1curasGray,2011-01-05T03:16Z,Please carry on seeding ! ill seed back once downloaded 
,skullsplitter,2011-01-06T14:14Z,This sure as fuck ain't HD...
,thundra,2011-01-09T03:26Z,"Thank you very much for this torrent! I just started downloading and I can't wait to rewatch what I believe to be the greatest series ever broadcasted on television. It all looks very well organized and to any future downloaders I would like you to know that it currently appears virus free. I plan to comment with confirmation on the quality of all the included files as soon as I finish downloading it. Again, thank you very much Sniffer_V, and thank you to everyone who is seeding this. I certainly plan on seeding this for a long time."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-09T07:50Z,"Thank you very much Thundra, it's very nice of you to say so. I'm sure you'll enjoy Lost again as I got the best quality files possible. You are correct that there are no viruses, I have no interest in doing anything like that. If you like decent tv series and decent downloads, click on my username and you'll see the other TV shows I've done. 

Enjoy lost again.

Charlie the best !!! You all EvERYBODY"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-10T22:34Z,"There must be something wrong with the way your downloads are set up. Are you using Utorrent? It's the best by far. Under Preferences, make sure you have at least 100 connections, make sure your download rate is set at 0 (unlimited) and your upload rate is at least 25. If you still have no luck, stop the torrent do a Force Recheck and then start it. If it still doesn't go any faster, do a speed check."
,benneke666,2011-01-11T00:50Z,Heeeeereyaa we go!!! LOST al over again.Too many people with guns running back and forth over a freakin'g island that' s also running back and forth...in time.MEN I want what those writers are using in their breakfast me thinks ;-))
,benneke666,2011-01-11T00:54Z,oh forgot....Thanks for the uppie.Sniffy!!! Will be seeding as long as I have a PC {;-)
,prija,2011-01-11T13:36Z,Sniffer_V- I m using BitTorrent 7.2... could that be the problem ?? 
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-11T14:17Z,"Use Utorrent, it's much better."
,rawdon,2011-01-12T15:41Z,"@Sniffer_V: The file list doesn't contain any subtitles. Where can I find compatible subtitles? 
Or, are you planning to release the subtitles separately in another torrent?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-13T16:28Z,"I don't have any subtitles. I would recommend downloading subtitles in your language from your usual source and changing the name of the files to match the name of the files in here. It should work then, but I'm no expert on subtitles, I never need them. "
,FRivera,2011-01-16T17:59Z,10x Sniffer this kicks ass. v8 a8.
,end_game2012,2011-03-05T03:52Z,"The seeding on this torrent is PATHETIC! I'm on season 5 episode 5 and I've been uploading at over 350kbps the whole time, sometimes upwards 600kbps. I've uploaded over 90GB of data but I always download at shitty speeds. Right now im downloading at around 70kbps.... fucking lame. I'm using utorrent and on a good torrent with good seeders I can download over 2.5mbps. 

So all you leechers out there stop freeloading and start seeding. My ratio is 4.7 and im not even halfway through season 5... wtf? I've already uploaded nearly 5 times more than I have downloaded!!

112 seeds, 1465 leechers.... fucking pathetic"
,ILOVEFIGSNEWTONS,2011-03-08T04:58Z,end_game  thats because you have a fucking gay ass computer.   I downloaded this in 1.5 days at 2.4 mbps. Why ? Because i have the bestest and fastest connection. sucks to be you mother fucker 
,NYer21,2011-03-15T23:13Z,Is there a reason why I don't have an audio?
,pwnstr26,2011-03-17T01:39Z,any chance people could seed a bit more?! jeezus at this rate ill be done in 2 weeks
,MrUbique,2011-03-20T18:02Z,"Thanks for the uploads Sniffer_V! Onto the last season of The Shield atm and then can get stated on this :D

What's with the seed comments??? uTorrent > files > right click the episode you want > high priority > sorted!

[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-03-29T22:13Z,"I don't know why you guys are getting a slow download, I've just tried it and I was getting over 2Mbps. It must be your settings."
,scuba.do,2011-04-04T12:52Z,"Why do I see loads of cunts in the list who have 90% completion when they've only uploaded 10meg? Bunch of tossers, I hope the cunt of your mother seals shut!"

,gamecreator7,2011-04-30T11:18Z,Thanks for this upload!! I am a huge huge fan! I am planning to get the box set anyway that comes with the white and black stones etc. This file has a lot of the deleted scenes and things I never saw before. This is the best show ever and I've watched it over 10 times I think I've lost count actually. Good stuff thanks.
,devil_82,2011-05-13T02:35Z,"your dvdrips are really nice quality. Most of the Tv shows are as good as anything else on the internet. I was looking for the tv show ""Rome"". Could anyone point me to a good quality source"

,crispyman01,2011-05-16T03:12Z,"@ assholes like artug92;
quit complaining about seeds. with the sheer size of the files i'm surprised there were 192 people kind enough to download the enirity of it AND still seed it. I've downloaded the entire thing in pieces, but seeded the whole time. i uploaded more as a peer than i did as a seed. so quit bitching about people being ""greedy"" by not seeding. not too many of us with 52 gigs spare memory laying around. on a more positive note, thanks a million for the up."

""The video and audio are perfect. This is the most complete collection on the internet and the highest quality.""

Rofl there are some Lost complete seasons in 720p, ac3 sound (dolby digtal) a real rip from bluray. Again, avoid that download if you're looking for higher quality.

,AreJustBest,2012-04-14T18:15Z,"There is another way of download the series a lot faster, but then you wouldn't get the amazing quality this torrent has, and you would have to work a little yourself.
First thing you should do is to download Replay Media Catcher 4. Then you have to go a site that streams lost and Media catcher will start downloading the episode. You just have to start the video and it will begin downloading. When you have done this with every single episode you will have the complete serie. The download speed using this technique is extremly high, but of course it will take some time doing this, but defentily worth it.
If you wonder what Replay media catcher 4 does. I can tell you now. Basicly it just downloads the stream that the site is giving you. So you don't really lose any quality. And if the stream is secure, which it most often isn't, it will start recording as the streaming comes through. That means you have to watch the whole episode, but still worth it. But remember if the stream isn't secure you just have to press play once and you can go to the next episode. You can even close the tab.
Hope this helps someone out there !"

Can you help me find some subtitles of Season 2? All of them start synced and goes through video losing sync. Maybe FPS issue? What is the exactly release?

Language: pt_BR.

Thanks for the awesome torrent!"
