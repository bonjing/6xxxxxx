,shinobiXRT,2011-01-13T12:29Z,"a good selection of actors cant save the fact that being an american made film about the orient is going to obscure the facts and bias the point of view.

trying to make out that the most blood thirsty, violent war mongering country in the world was a meer pass-a-by in WW2 is non-sense.

still, its a detective romance/ rebel uprising in decadent shanghai makes for the lack of facts. Dont expect a documentary, but it beats watching another of those 999,999 type of american movies about american teenagers in american high school showing how superior america is."
