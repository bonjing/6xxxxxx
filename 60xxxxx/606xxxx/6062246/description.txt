Review

Review of the previous edition:

'The book underwater photographers have been dying to get their hands 
on...'
'..anyone interested in taking up underwater photography would benefit 
from reading this book.'

Professional Photographer Magazine
"...it contains clear demonstrations of technique, illustrates the equipment and takes us through examples of how to achieve results similar to the author's"

Review of second edition:
"We liked the writing style, the extensive captions that explain how each of the tens of colour images were taken and the general layout of the book. If you have some experience in underwater photography and want to go beyond the snapshots, this is the book to buy."
Diver magazine, Oct/Nov 2000
