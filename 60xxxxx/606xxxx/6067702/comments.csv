,ar1990,2010-12-27T17:47Z,"hey could you plz try and upload all the 5 seasons of ""MY WIFE AND KIDS""

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273855/

plz reply soon..."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-27T17:49Z,"Regarding Inception - conception is not possible, ever. I said that whenever was asked. DVDrip is good enough for that over-hyped piece of good PR-ing."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-27T17:59Z,"@ar1990: I uploaded just few seasons of shows I followed through (as they have been in my Schedule) or have encoded for whatever reason. I never have nor can upload seasons of TV shows of others. Google or Search torrents. I know for sure that ALL seasons of My wife and kids are available in XviD form, since I encoded requested Pilot maybe year back."
,muk0690,2010-12-27T19:53Z,Thanks for Tron. And I do agree that about Inception
,r-0987,2010-12-27T20:36Z,THANK YOU!! 
,muthineni,2010-12-28T03:22Z,"thank you..
i was gonna ask for this
+1"
,strmprpl,2010-12-28T13:04Z,"Well, OK. 
And for the record, I too think it is over-hyped. But then again, I think Avatar too is. Maybe more so."

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-28T22:43Z,"@strmprpl: Second that, absolutely."
,flacochavez,2011-01-01T16:38Z,"Nice work, great movie............"
,thedarkrai,2011-01-01T20:22Z,"wao.....720p of two open seasons....can we expect 720p of the 1st movie as well??
it'll complete the collection :D"
[T],PeteSapai,2011-01-03T00:53Z,"Video: decent (but not good. 720p is not yet ready for 700mb releases, imho)
Audio: 64kbps (aka low quality)
It's good if you don't have the bandwith (or hdd space), but I do and I'd rather see a 1.4gb (or more) version of this with at least better audio.
Anyway, I know I have high standards and there are lots of people not as spoiled as me ;) so I guess this is good enough for lots of people.
Thanks for sharing!"
,freespirit_10,2011-04-18T08:18Z,"I have a question, it may seem silly to many people on this site but I  am very new to downloading video's and can not figure this out. 

After I have finished downloading a movie, is there a simply and reliable way of sending through a comment to rate it without having to copy down who I leeched from and search for the particular movie again. I find it very time consuming and lately I havent been writing any comments. Thank you.
