"The Time (Dirty Bit)", also known as "The Time (The Dirty Bit)", is a song by American hip hop group The Black Eyed Peas from their sixth studio album, The Beginning. The song was released as the album's lead single on November 5, 2010. The chorus of the song samples "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" from the film Dirty Dancing.
The song has peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, becoming the group's ninth top ten hit. It peaked at number one in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy & New Zealand while also charting inside the top ten on most European charts.

The music video for "The Time (Dirty Bit)" was released on November 23, 2010 and was directed by Rich Lee, who had previously directed the video for "Imma Be". It opens with a zoom-in to a city street where, as will.i.am sings the beginning, his head pixellates and transforms into a television screen where Fergie is projected during her solo. The video then cuts to sweaty dancers at an underground nightclub, who, along with the Peas, also variously become pixellated throughout the song. The avatars seen on the cover of the new album 'The Beginning' appear as posters, and the BlackBerry PlayBook appears as product placement, seen animating them and making special effects in this video.
