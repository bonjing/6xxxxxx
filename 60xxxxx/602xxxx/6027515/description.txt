Amazon Review:
With this collection, fab '70s pop star Olivia Newton-John reaches for the star at the top of the tree. Wisely choosing to work with country vets Vince Gill and Clint Black, pop crooner Kenny Loggins, and the London Symphony Orchestra, Newton-John creates a companion her 2001 holiday tour. Piecing together an album in patchwork-quilt fashion, she stitches four tunes sung on Loggins's 1999 TNN television special and borrows six other traditional songs from a limited-release Hallmark album she made in 2000. Newton-John adds her own forgettable "Christmas Never Felt Like This Before" and an unreleased version of "The First Noel." While the orchestral arrangements are soaring and the country flourishes convincing, Newton-John's collection is best suited to fans.

Allmusic Review: 
Olivia Newton-John's The Christmas Collection finds the singer in fine voice as she interprets some of the season's classic songs, as well as some original material, in a slightly countrified setting. Together with the London Symphony Orchestra, Kenny Loggins, Clint Black, and Vince Gill, Newton-John delivers gently festive versions of "The First Noel," "Silver Bells," "White Christmas," and "Silent Night," among others. While the original song, "Christmas Never Felt Like This Before," is nothing special, Christmas Collection is still a pleasant-enough holiday album, particularly for Newton-John fans.
