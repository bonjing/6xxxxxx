I am from Greece, working on a program that works with the Autocad. The version I have is for 2004. I wanted to ask if they'll be easy to send you the 2008 version and if you could help me with your knowledge to crack the program. If you have any doubt about who I am, the website of the company that sell it is www.art-cad.gr but the bad news is that you can not download a trial version like in Autocad, if you could find a solution I will be grateful. I wish you the best for the new year!"
