Generally, the whole futuristic subgenre of racing games are the same
things. All of the Extreme Gs, WipeOuts, PODs, etc, are the same:
Weapons, high speed,crazy tracks, and techno music. 
Think of Kinetica as a futuristic SSX. It's not on snowboards,
but the entire set-up is quite similar. The colors in Kinetica have
that same shiny quality to them as the ones in SSX did. 
They're really rather nice. The racers look quite good.
The levels range from very dark to very bright. 
All futuristic cities are dark metropolises. 
Some of the lighting effects are really nice.
