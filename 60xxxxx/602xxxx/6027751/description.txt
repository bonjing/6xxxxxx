A Taste of Iran                 

In a new four-part series, the BBC Iranian Expert Sadeq Saba travels around his home country meeting its people and exploring the culinary history and culture of the different regions.

A Taste of Iran will be a journey of discovery of a land and its culture through its cuisine. In a series of four documentaries BBC Iranian expert Sadeq Saba will guide the audience through different regions of Iran as he explores the culinary history and culture of Iranians.

But what differentiates this series from other travel shows and films about Iran is the access of the filmmakers to ordinary Iranians across the country and the filmakers depth of knowledge about Iran and Iranians.

In his journey through Iran Sadeq will meet interesting characters who will tell him about all things food related and beyond. He will travel to four regions of Iran and in each region he will find an extraordinary variety of food as well as cultural and historical backgrounds.
