Jack Ryan, the former president of the United States, is out of office, but not out of the loop about his brainchild, the â€œCampusâ€ - a highly effective, counter-terrorism organization that operates outside the Washington hierarchy. But what Ryan doesnâ€™t know is that his son, Jack Ryan, Jr., has joined his cousins, Brian and Dominic Caruso, at the shadowy Campus. While a highly effective analyst, young Ryan hungers for the action of a field agent.

The Campus has now turned their sights on the Emir, the number one terrorist threat to western civilization. A reclusive figure and mastermind of vicious terrorist acts, the Emir has eluded capture by the worldâ€™s law enforcement agencies. But now - with the help of ex-CIA agent John Clark and protÃ©gÃ© Marine Colonel Ding Chavez - the Campus is in on the hunt. The mission: to bring the Emir in - dead or alive.
