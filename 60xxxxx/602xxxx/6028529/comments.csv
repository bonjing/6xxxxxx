[V],twentyforty,2010-12-10T19:06Z,"@sci-toon: I am older than you assumed, obviously. I grew up watching MASH and A-team, even if A-team is shoulder-to-shoulder with Walker,Texas ranger... (for kiddies or ""slow-in-development"")
Trash is best left behind - MASH us good however, but for-sake-of-god... 12 years/seasons is too much.

M*A*S*H is 47.34 GIGA even as XviD DVDrip (I just checked out) and if you are so crazy to get it - become a member of some warez-stuff forum, acquire jdownloader and knock yourself out.

""Call"" us after 6 months - 'cause you'll need one month for download and another five to watch all episodes."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-10T19:28Z,...pardon - 48.21 GB and I saved .dlc and can send you that one as reply to your e-mal message.
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-10T20:30Z,@sci-toon: OK then. Click on my screen-name then on couple of recent torrents and in long Description there find my address (I do not want to re-post it 'cause of huge amount of spam-email I receive). Remind me there and be quick.

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-11T11:19Z,"@dragonballz: That ""Only"" could be ""translated"" as ""Rest is shit, encodes are ugly"".
LOL... just kidding, in fact, I don't care about. But - ""Thanks"" are necessity to keep shows in my sight."
