Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but i'd think you'd find in the opinion of the majority of people that spoilers fucking suck!

How to block it?  It is simple.  Download Peer Blocker and make sure it is running when you are downloading torrent files.  It is not perfect but it is very effective.

The Corporate slime-bucket geeks will go through their IP address list and find the ISP (internet service provider) for each.  They will send a letter to the ISP complaining about the IP address user.  By law, the ISP must send you the letter.  ISP's don't want to do this and they bitch about having to do it.
