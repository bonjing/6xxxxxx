IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:The.Last.Exorcism.DVDSCR.XviD-TWiZTED
AUDIO:The.Last.Exorcism.DVDSCR.XviD-TWiZTED

Well first off we retagged this a screener as we don't think it's a dvdscreener or certainly don't look like one, but we could be wrong ....could have just be ripped poorly or whatever, so without see the original source files it's hard to say. Anyway for this we thought the colours were off and was also too strong....so we made a script and added lines into it to fix this. Audio is just muxed straight of the source we used. Still no overly happy with the colouring but does look alot better in our opinion.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
