You can upload a folder with all last season's subtitles .I prefer your mkv files versions and  I can use the avi files subtitles .
                                                     Thanks"
,soundtrekker,2010-12-10T11:36Z,"well, baietica, that should be no problem, I'm going to upload the subs for 4x01-4x15 right away. I've tested them for the first mkv episode, and they run precisely on time, since both mkv and avi have the same running time!"
,soundtrekker,2010-12-10T12:22Z,"The complete subs for all 15 mkv episodes will be part of each following mkv upload, starting with episode 4x07.

The files will have been renamed to the mkv file names, so you don't have to do it yourself. The subtext files for episode 2 will be the fixed one (there were problems with the files when I uploades the avi file of episode 4x02).

All you have to do is arranging the files accordingly  - all three files (.avi, .sub. and .idx) have to be in the same folder to run the subtext.

Best regards,
Soundtrekker"
,soundtrekker,2010-12-10T12:35Z,"I will add all the subtext files for episode 01-15 only once, with the next episode (4x07).

All the remaining mkv uploads (4x08-15) will only contain the individual subtext files - no need to upload more than necessary, I think!"
