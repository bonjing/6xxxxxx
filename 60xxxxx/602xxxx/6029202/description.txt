One mysterious day, around the small English village of Midwich, a strange barrier appears, which when crossed causes people to fall down unconscious. From the sky, a strange silvery object can also be seen in the centre of the village. The next day, all is back to normal, or so it seems. Months later, all the women of child-bearing age are found to be pregnant, and as the children are born, it is obvious that there is something more than a little different about the children of Midwich...

The novel was filmed as Village of the Damned in 1960, with a script that was relatively faithful to the book. A sequel, Children of the Damned, followed shortly afterwards. There was also a remake of the original in 1995 by John Carpenter set in Midwich, California and starring Christopher Reeve in his last film role before he was paralysed in a riding accident.
