[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T17:05Z,"HolyRoses. If you expect a film from 2003 not to look great, you know nothing about bluray :/"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T21:27Z,I know enough to know that film negatives degenerate over time.
,sctehking,2010-12-15T04:35Z,This looks just fine for a film like this. The visuals were never eye popping and what not. This picture is perfect for what it is. 
,cierraberra21,2010-12-23T19:11Z,can you make this in mp4 for ipod with subtitles?

I recommend using YAMB free software; just drag drop the .mkv and the .srt files and it will merge them into an .mp4  
Or, use AirVideo (server) software on your home PC or Mac plus AirVideo (client) software on your iP*."
