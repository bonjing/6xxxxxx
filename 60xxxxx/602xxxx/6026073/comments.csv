,mikeawesome2010,2010-12-10T00:40Z,awesome. does anyone know why hell's kitchen is so difficult to find torrents for these days?
,eskebe,2010-12-10T01:15Z,^^^Probably schedule conflicts.  Same goes for American Chopper: Sr. vs Jr. series.
,theorulez,2010-12-10T01:18Z,@mike I'm not sure but its a pain when it was backed for a while and then when your right at the end of a season its no where to be found =.= ... Another good show if you like comedies is Blue mountain state.

What a shame."
