thanks for ur hard work mate"
[T],pkaji123,2010-12-08T09:45Z,"No this is version 2.0.1 which was realeased today,look at the file name ""OTK2010V201.zip""."
,SirMaxy,2010-12-08T10:43Z,"Thank you pakaj123 for this superb activator..the previous version activated office pro plus,Visio premium and project pro for me ,,, and (promodsharma) there is no doubt that this is 2.0.1 donÂ´t know how you could miss that :)"
,Antonvn,2010-12-12T15:08Z,"Thankyou  pkaji123 for your good work!!!!! 

This verson is indeed improved above version 2.0.0, I would need to add an exeption for the false positive Symantec AV gave about the activator executable. I no longer have to do that. It surely isn't a virus or anything, as I have checked this application and it does NOT make any malicious changes to my computers. I know many people about that are very happy with your posted fixes! Keep up the good work."
,bobcarny,2010-12-12T23:52Z,"I get an error that says ""Failed to start C:\Windows\KMSEmulator.exe"". If I try to manually run it windows says ""cannot open the file, you may not have permission to run it"". Despite running as admin and taking ownership.

I turned AVG off as well via task manager."
,jicaraca,2010-12-13T06:44Z,Exceptional !! Gratz 
,SirMaxy,2010-12-13T16:46Z,"@bobcarny most likely your firewall is blocking it, because the KMSemulator works itÂ´s way trough (localhost 127.0.0.1)"
,Endymyon,2010-12-14T21:43Z,Kick ass!!!  very awesome job mate!!!
,bobcarny,2010-12-16T21:25Z,"I still get the error even when I turn off my firewall, this happens on both of my computers. It's very frustrating because no office activator works because they all use KMS activation, which doesn't work for me.

Does anybody know of any other activation methods?"
,shaaani,2010-12-17T08:25Z,"it is 2.0.1

thnx to uploader"
,FilmfanWillem,2010-12-20T19:31Z,"The activator works fine on my laptop. 
Afterwards when I installed it on my desktop, it said the Toolkit has a virus or unwanted program ""SPR/Tool.Keygen.BI.38""!! 
How dangerous is this? Can I ignore this message Pkaji??"
[T],pkaji123,2010-12-21T17:02Z,Its a False Positive..
,comski,2010-12-22T22:48Z,"sweet thanks, works here took a couple of goes but hey... :-)"
,bobcarny,2010-12-24T00:45Z,"I'm fully updated on windows 7, I dont know why no KMS activations work in my house."
,SAMIAM72,2010-12-31T08:31Z,"WoW!!! I have downloaded all kinds of crud, from win7lxe loader extreme, to fake kms whatevers (not sure exactly what that is) but none of them worked, wait one had me active for a day and then the next day showed I was in my grace period with 27 days left (I had it for 3 or so days thus far). Downloaded this torrent from pkaji123 and Ive never seen anything like it. The EZ Activator is what when through whatever files and fixed them removed fake keys, temp keys etc... and activated it!!! It is for the 180 days and hopefully it is just that as insane cool in another 180 days!! Thank you pkaji123 for such a cool product. This piece of software would be worth at least 50 or so dollars!! Get it you will love it! Thanks again!
PS does anybody know how I can remove the side ads here in pirate bay of all the 15 year old hotties with huge boobs?  I work on my computer with my 7yrold, 5yrold and 4yrold around me and this crap stinks to have showing up. Any help much appreciated!! "
,Giocool,2011-02-05T05:24Z,"As a student in college I thank you!!!
It worked like a charm; and quickly too :)"
,Giocool,2011-02-05T05:26Z,"SAMIAM72 download the google chrome web browser and when you have it use this: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hkggcdanhcfibkhpfiogkoaodjalekcc

Problem solved :)"
,olite,2011-02-06T10:48Z,"@Giocool -- Cheers, nifty little plugin there."
,olite,2011-02-06T10:51Z,"Ahh, this one works for me (one that came bundled in the ISO download didn't). Shame it only gives upto 180 days... but it beats the popup and red bars lol."
,ArmedHalo,2011-03-04T21:32Z,"Hello everyone,

A friend of mine told me about this activator and i am having trouble with it. i have windows 7 home premium x64 fresh install my hosts file is unmodded from what M$ has, i have Office Professional plus (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6182157/MICROSOFT_OFFICE_2010_PROFESSIONAL__PLUS_X64_%5Bthethingy%5D_) fresh install never launched, turned of AV and stuff but i am getting failed still? am i missing something? either post new comment or u can email me ReArmedHalo[AT]gmail[DOT]com.

,koakingII,2012-01-29T22:11Z,best person ever
,wanderlustus,2012-04-13T20:09Z,"Ok, downloaded and installed and craked Micro Office just fine, but two files popped up on ESET NOD32 anti-virus check with this message: ""Potential Threat Found (2) HackKMS.A and HackKMS.B""

What's the deal with these?  Did no one else installing this see these warnings?"
[T],FaeGiN,2012-04-17T01:00Z,"Wow man wanderlustus, did you not read the description on false positives?
Look at what you said:
Potential Threat Found (2) HackKMS.A and HackKMS.B

I'm no virus scanner author byut I would say with confidence that the clue is in the title of those 'viruses'.
POTENTIAL THREAT
HACK MS?  (Hack MicroSoft?)
Make more sense now?
Your scanner is simply stating the obvious, it is telling you that some bad person has downloaded a program that might harm the operating system... which is the truth! The virus scanner doesn't realise it was YOU and that you wanted the programs for that exact reason, to HACK MS operating system.
I hope you have got it now. Disable the AV, then use the program. . .
Or, if you do not trust this info, delete the files and go on your way lol. . ."
[T],FaeGiN,2012-04-17T01:01Z,"Add those files that eset is complaining about, to the ESET EXCEPTIONS as they are what make the crack work!"
,nano404,2012-04-19T13:19Z,Excellent! Thanks much!

,jzxeg12,2012-05-08T00:29Z,Thank you very much pkaji123! I've been searching the net for this for awhile now. Problem solved! 
,j33p_Lover,2012-05-24T04:24Z,"Took a little bit of figuring out but i'm not real computer savvy.....after i figured it out tho, it worked great :) thanks"
,redhot11,2012-06-17T16:40Z,"did not work for me. I went into product licenses tab and clicked on check.
this generated a key which I entered into the product. It accepted the keys successfully and then did some configuration.

But on restarting the product it sayd 

""this copy of Microsoft office is not activated.
This copy of Microsoft office is designed for corporate or institutional customers. connect yoru computer to your corporate network to complete activation. your system administrator can help.

forgot to mention that the kmsactivator.exe is being caught by McCafee for hidden trojans."
