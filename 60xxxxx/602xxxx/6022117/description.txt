Great Roots album and wonderful recording.......

"Naked and raw is perhaps the best description that can be given to the 60 minutes of superb musical works that can be heard on this album. Ras Mek Peace was recorded using only 2 tracks, one for vocals and one for instruments. Incredibly, the tracks were put together using no mixing board, no filtering, no compression, no equalization, no noise reduction, multitracking or overdubbing."
