This is a small local band out of Oklahoma (I'm not sure exactly of the town, but it either is near or is Moore). The name is stylized as ACTION!, however I tend to use Action! Do what you want. This EP was given to me by a mutual friend of the band and me. I'm fairly certain they aren't on the Tubesâ„¢ yet, but maybe they'll begin to surface after a while. They're very good and pretty unique.

[b]I've included both lossless FLAC and 320kbps MP3 versions of every song, so download whichever folder you prefer.[/b]

Pardon me, I've never reviewed music before (If anyone can write something better, please message me or something):
It Begins combines lyricless, electronic epics with songs with raw vocals and garageband-esque rock. They are somewhat reminiscent of early White Stripes albums. This EP is guaranteed to take you to another world.
