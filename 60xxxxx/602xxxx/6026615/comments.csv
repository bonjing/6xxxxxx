,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-12T17:43Z,"Watch out, this is a re-encode. There are plenty of genuine rips here on the bay already, e.g.

,KickassWashingMachine,2010-12-12T18:26Z,"And please, Holy Roses, when you do a re-encode, would you NOT write ""BRRIP"" in the title as it's misleading? If anything, you could at least add that extra ""RIP"", so you'd have ""BRRIPRIP""."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T21:16Z,they are all rerips.  this is designed for a specific purpose.  you are not my target audience.
,JG7854,2010-12-15T00:06Z,"Hi Holyroses,
What is the difference between this rip and The Town? I ask because of the playback problems I am having with latest ATV software of the spinning wheel but no movie loading up.
This film works great, but The Town won't load like all the others when I play via my AV Receiver.

p.s. Ignore comments above about Re-Rips, your uploads are fantastic quality and all excellent. Just a shame ATV 4.2 is playing up."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-15T16:39Z,"apple tv v2 firmware is fubar.  Put your Dolby Digital setting to auto or off.  all else fails, do a restore and then also put your DD to auto or off.

read all the comments I have documented regarding the latest rendition of ATV 2 firmware.

I have documented all the work arounds there.  There is nothing wrong with the file.  All the movies are encoded identical.  Same procedure is done for everything, they are all done in batch with same parms over and over."
,JG7854,2010-12-16T00:01Z,"Thanks, I will have a read through.

I got my second ATV 2 today, with the original iOS, and guess what....it works fine with everything! Rang Apple Technical, explained I have two exact setups, one with new firmware, one with old firmware, and the problems, finally I think they have acknowledged there is an issue with software and not my system.  They say Technical will get back to me in 24 hours, also said if I want to swap my ATV with latest software for a new one (with old software) then they will be able to do this for me.  Just leaves me wondering when exactly they will update the problem.
Thanks again."
