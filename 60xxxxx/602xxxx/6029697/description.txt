PLOT:


Stacy Holt, an associate producer for a daytime talk show, is confounded by her boyfriend Derek's unwillingness to talk about his previous relationships. Egged on by her co-worker Barb, Stacy sneaks a look at his personal digital organizer, scores the names and numbers of his exes, and sets up interviews with them--all in an effort to get closer to her man. Her plan starts to unravel, however, when she becomes friends with one of the women.

Brittany Murphy will capture your heart in this wickedly funny film about a really nice girl who's a disaster waiting to happen. Hired to work on a tabloid TV show, Stacy Holt's life gets turned upside down when she is persuaded to explore one of the show's themes, and snoops through her boyfriend's Palm Handheld. But she's forgetting one thing: in the world of daytime TV, there's always a shocking surprise in store - and she's about to get a big one!
