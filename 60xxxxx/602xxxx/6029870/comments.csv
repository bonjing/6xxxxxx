,dlarrym1111,2010-12-16T21:53Z,"@dkhere: Keep up with the times, a SCREENER is a DVDRIP. The ONLY difference is that it is supposed to be restricted for viewing unless you have special permission from the movie studio that made the film. . . For example, Movie Reviewers that are BIG TIME names Like Gene Siskel or Leonard Malton. These real DVD's  are also made to be viewed by people in the film ACADEMY (as in the ADAMEY AWARDS). They end up on the web because someone at the Studio itself or a person that was able to handle the DVD that is an employee of the TV studio where a Movie Critic's show is made. Anyone that is lucky enough to have an hour or so and a FAST as HELL lap top can copy the disk and return it before anyone is aware it was even moved from where ever it is kept.  SO, for ALL who are un-informed, if it is a TRUE SCREENER, it is the exact same quality as the retail version and is DEFINITELY NOT a CAM nor is its quality super shitty like most CAMS are. It may have a ""watermark"" in the form of a message explaining that this is only been issued for the purpose of movie reviewers and is not for the public. A message like this will appear at the top or bottom of the screen maybe 4 times spread throughout the film and these WATERMARKS may only last 10 or 15 seconds and are usually smaller text then even a subtitle so in no way does it diminish the quality or watchability. I have seen comments like this person made all the time. It is amazing that there are so many people that will NOT download a given film because they wrongly think a Screener (sometimes abrevreated as SCR) is some type of CAM. The audio is the same as the retail as well. If it will be a BLU-RAY when it hits the stores, the SCREENER will be Blu-Ray also. hope this helps some of the NEWBS

,Jack_Reacher,2010-12-18T01:39Z,I bet Gene Siskel wishes he could review another fucking movie.
,Fcharles14,2010-12-18T19:37Z,"I see everybody is commenting on the movies quality but not the fact that this ""Title"" is ripped off from Bruce Lee's Game of Death. I just have one thing to say about that...glad you are all downloading it and not buying it. XP~"
,lynx_ca,2010-12-19T13:38Z,"dlarrym1111
nice explaination. though you lied a little about the watermarks. 
sometimes it covers the whole screen, and sometimes it has a serial number on it. also it usually asks you to call a number if you obtained it illegally. which of course none of us do. 
but all in all, nice breakdown. now you gotta do it for region-5, so they understand that is not a cam either lol. "
,lynx_ca,2010-12-19T13:42Z,"maybe had he paid his taxes they would have let him make a better movie, maybe the prison warden was the director.  whatever the excuse is.... this movie was absolutely terrible, the director was using special effects from an 80's horror film, the actors (aside from wesley snipes) i have never heard of, and only seen a couple times.. 
the plot? terrible, the story? terrible, the script? terrible... in fact the only thing that was good about this movie is the overall concept. 
wesley snipes worse movie, id rather see him dress up as a woman again."

,Dannylinder89,2010-12-21T00:37Z,Thanks. Great movie
,golabskii,2010-12-22T23:32Z,@dlarrym1111  umm dude i think your an idiot because if your talking about TS being true screener then you got caught in a vortex of idiot... that means tele sync and its no where near perfect quality

,dlarrym1111,2010-12-30T07:30Z,"@lynx_ca - 1st thing, I didn't LIE, and I am not really upset, because I didn't get the impression that you were trying to slam me. It seemed you were adding to some of the subject matter in my comment. (a LIE is to KNOWINGLY deceive another). Having said that, You are totally correct about the variations of watermarking DVD's.

One other thing to note: 

I personally have not come across a watermarked SCREENER that covered the entire screen with a huge ""X"" or other character.  However, I don't doubt your word that this type of watermarking is being used. (We are dealing with HOLLYWOOD DOUCHE BAGS AFTER ALL. . LOL) 
ANYWAY,  I am fine with your points about the things I neglected to mention, and gladly accept your constructive criticism.
For the record, My MAIN point wasn't the watermarks themselves, but to explain to any NAY SAYERS, a scenario showing how a DVD quality RIP can show up on a site like this one even before a given movie has come to a theater. Some do not see how this is possible.
 So, @lynx_ca, I truly hope you and anyone else reading these comments now see that I wasn't telling lies. I n fact, I owe you a respectful THANK YOU! You had  some very valid and accurate information about said subject. I am only protesting you using the term ""LIED"". I don't think anyone wants to be labeled as a person who lies, especially when I didn't, I am only only guilty of not mentioning even more types of watermarking found on SCR/SCREENER DVD's."
,dlarrym1111,2010-12-30T08:05Z,"@golabskii:  It feels to me that you felt   was trying to call me out and rag on me. ACTUALLY  had some very true and very constructive things to add, You just wanted to start a bunch of mud slinging and name calling. You had ZERO to add to my point (which you apparently didn't understand because TS Audio had NOTHING to do with my point. I didn't even MENTION TS AUDIO anywhere in my comment. As for what ever you were saying, I can't comment because it isn't even a real sentence. I really just feel sad for you and pity your aimless existence. Not to be mean, but seriously, you can't even write??? Did you miss school the day they taught grammar and diagraming sentences???? I don't feel any need to elaborate any further. anyone reading can see your some kind of WAKO - WING NUT!!! LOL."
,uglyrtard,2011-01-05T11:10Z,"SCREENER (SCR)

A VHS tape, sent to rental stores, and various other places for promotional use. A screener is supplied on a VHS tape, and is usually in a 4:3 (full screen) a/r, although letterboxed screeners are sometimes found. The main draw back is a ""ticker"" (a message that scrolls past at the bottom of the screen, with the copyright and anti-piracy telephone number). Also, if the tape contains any serial numbers, or any other markings that could lead to the source of the tape, these will have to be blocked, usually with a black mark over the section. This is sometimes only for a few seconds, but unfortunately on some copies this will last for the entire film, and some can be quite big. Depending on the equipment used, screener quality can range from excellent if done from a MASTER copy, to very poor if done on an old VHS recorder thru poor capture equipment on a copied tape."
,uglyrtard,2011-01-05T11:11Z,"TELESYNC (TS)

A telesync is the same spec as a CAM except it uses an external audio source (most likely an audio jack in the chair for the hearing impaired). A direct audio source does not ensure a good quality audio source, as a lot of background noise can interfere. A lot of the times a telesync is filmed in an empty cinema or from the projection booth with a professional camera, giving a better picture quality. Quality ranges drastically, check the sample before downloading the full release. A high percentage of Telesyncs are CAMs that have been mislabeled."
,glabos,2011-01-13T06:19Z,"As far as the actual movie is concerned all I can say is Thank God they finally locked up Wesley Snipes so we don't have to suffer through any more of his mindless dribble !!!

By the way, for all you die-hard Snipes fans, he recently tweeted that he is in dire need of Astroglide and Preparation H !!!
