A/V - 10/10

Movie 4/10

Not funny att ALL, and as a drama it just fails imo.. (perhaps because I can't relate to this ""special minded"" kid.. 

But I would say, there is way better movies out there to spend your time on, 
""take him to the greek"" is a quite funny movie with same actor jonah hill, recommended 10 times more then this movie, but you should make your up own mind about it I guess..

Peace."
