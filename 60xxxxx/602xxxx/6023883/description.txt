A story about courage, integrity, and trust in God

Babylon forces invade Jerusalem and carry away many of the city's finest young people, including Daniel and his three young friends: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. During a series of events in Daniel's lifeâ€”serving King Nebuchadnezzar, being placed in jail, interpreting the king's dreamâ€”we learn the values of patience and trust. When Daniel is thrown into the lion's den, he proves that God still rules over the affairs of men!
