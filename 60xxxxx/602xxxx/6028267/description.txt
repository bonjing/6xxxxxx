    Bumbling crooks Butch and Toby pose as priests in order to elude         
    being arrested by the authorities in Africa. Butch and Toby deliver a    
    statue of the Virgin Mary from Africa to Amsterdam. Unbenownst to the    
    clueless duo, they're really smuggling diamonds. A group of equally      
    inept mobsters give chase.
