a while back linkin park had the ""Catalyst"" remix contest....

they said they would include the winning track on this album and it would be distributed to all buyers/listeners.

pretty much, linkin park was going to help promote the winner on their new album by including that remix track.

they said it in video blogs and posted it in the prizes area of the rules.

i still havent found 1 copy of this album with the winning remix track included.

i think linkin park LIED to everybody!!!"

,ShadowDragonXXI,2011-01-27T19:49Z,"The remix track you mention is in fact on the album. It's a hidden bonus track that can be found tagged on the end of ""The Messanger"" (track 15). I had it on mine before I accidentally sat on the disk. They mentioned in the promotions that it would be on the BestBuy-Exclusive (which is where I got mine), so try tracking down one of those.

Good sound, excellent seeds and transfer rates. For anybody else looking for the Remix Contest bonus track it's not on this torrent."

,laned130,2011-06-09T16:42Z,"@Laxidate - was that really necessary?! Especially since you're wrong too!!! No it's not 320kb/s, but it's not 90kb/s either - my rough calculations make it around 240kb/s average."
