The Fugitive.S04E02.Death Is The Door Prize.DVDRip by OSiTV (with English subtitles)


For those who wish to play the show on stand-alone DVD players, I'm going to upload the episodes in avi format, including English subtitles.

The upload of the mkv files will continue also - the mkv files are slightly better in video quality with higher resolution, but they don't have subtitles and can't be played on stand-alone DVD players.	



NOTE:

You can find an alternate edit for this episode here:

SECOND UPDATE Dec. 10th, 2010 (The first update was removed by me!)



The 2 subtext files are wrongly named! Here's what you have to do:

Rename "the.fugitive.401.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.sub" into "the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.sub" - that's the apparent part with the wrong episode number!

Then also rename "the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.subs-ositv.idx" into "the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.idx"! For some reason, when appearing in the usenet, the subtext files always are named with the "sub" in the files, which have to be removed and replaced with the "xvid" part. Of course, all the three files have to be the same name before the dot, otherwise there's no use for the subtext files! When renaming the two files here, I wasn't carefully enough!

Now all should be fixed, there will be no replacement files in this case!
