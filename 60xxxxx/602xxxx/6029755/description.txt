 About the Game

The Polynomial is a 3D spaceflight music game with abstract, mathematically generated scenery and models which are set to the music of your choice. You fly around in a very strange universe, shoot the enemies, meet and protect the friends, collect bonuses, fly through wormholes, and so on, all while rocking out to the music.

You can play the music supplied with the game or build a playlist of your own songs; you can even use microphone as music source. The music animation is highly configurable with multiple visualization types.

If shooting up stuff is not your thing, maybe you'll like using it in editor mode to create unique fractal artwork. Or you can set the difficulty to none and concentrate on all the non-killing action and enjoying the beauty.

The Polynomial features an innovative scoring system. Scoring is based on continuously timed counts of your actions in the past 1, 5, 20, and 60 minutes of your play, as well as on how much you can do in the space of one lifetime without being killed. If you are playing for the score and you screw up early, you can just keep on playing â€“ thanks to the unique continuous scoring. All of the timed counts are running simultaneously and your scores are constantly updated.

There are multiple scoreboards for different types of action, as well as a combined score which rewards you for balanced play. Conversely, if you just like flying around and don't like shooting, you can try top the scoring in just the flowers you have collected or wormholes you passed through â€“ and if you think you are very bad at this game, you can try to get the high score in number of deaths.

PC System Requirements

    - OS: Windows XP / Vista / 7, 32 or 64-bit
    - Processor: Intel Core 2 1.8 GHz, AMD Athlon 2GHz, or better recommended
    - Memory: 1GB
    - Graphics: Shader Model 4.0 or better, 256MB (512MB or better recommended),
      NVIDIA GeForce 8600GT /       ATI Radeon HD 2400 or better -
    - Video: OpenGL: 2.1 , GLSL: 1.2
    - Hard Drive: 100MB
    - Note:The Polynomial requires OpenGL 2.1 - compatible graphics card with at
      least 256MB of video       memory (512MB recommended). There is a list of
      compatible cards: NVIDIA: GeForce 8400 and better       (e.g. GeForce GT
      260) work well with all effects. AMD/ATI: Radeon HD 2000 series and better
      work well       with all effects. Dual-GPU cards might require use of
      Catalyst 10.4 for compatibility. Intel, other       integrated graphics with
      no specialized video memory: Performance strongly depends on the
      memory       bandwidth, cache, and other factors. Try the demo first. Note:
      NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT works but       particles do not move to the beat
      (Waves Animator does not work). Other cards below recommended
      specifications: Some effects (or entire game) may fail to work. Try the demo
      first.
