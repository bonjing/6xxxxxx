,Wolfyy7,2011-01-02T21:27Z,"Long time user, first time comment, Only version that works for me as well. All I did was extract the first RAR folder into a folder I made up named Super Meat Boy, then moved the remaining folders from, ""Super.Meat.Boy.READNFO-CPY"" without extracting them, then mounted the large bin file with MagicISO and then opened the file  opencpysi, installed regularly and thats it! THANKS!"
