Just have to download, no need to install anything. 

To play online open SAMP.exe

Thanks a lot for the torrent uploader."
,fothatt,2011-02-13T21:05Z,"What the f*ck  is the path for the saved game files in this version?

It's not in C:\Documents and Settings\(username)\My Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files
and it's not anywhere in the AppData folder...

Where does it put them?"
,fothatt,2011-02-13T21:14Z,"Found it. Was running it in Win 98/ME compatibility mode so they were stored in
C:\Users\Public\Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files"
,dzajony,2011-04-10T21:58Z,hey  i have a problem :( when i click on the shorcut of san nothing hapens. no eror no screen nothing!!
,CCALLUMM,2011-04-30T16:24Z,"Great, works perfectly, Mods can be added to and work.

Game freezes when you click new game. To overcome this, run the gta_sa.exe under compatability mode for windows 98/ME and it will work perfectly xD"

,armageddon1,2011-11-12T05:07Z,i dl this last night and accidentally deleted a couple files and cant recover them. So today i just deleted the game and when i try to download it again after maybe 20% in it says access denied.. I'm using bittorrent. Why is it denying access? I've never had this problem.
,armageddon1,2011-11-12T08:38Z,"ok, i guess fifth times the charm, it finally downloaded completely. BUT, when i try to join the multiplayer it brings up the screen with one romanian room to join but as soon as i click to join and enter my screen name or handle, it stops responding... only thing i can come up with is i have version .3a  and his is .3c.  I guess maybe thats the problem, but then where can i play this game online? "
