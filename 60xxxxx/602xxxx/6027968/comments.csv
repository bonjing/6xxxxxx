I keep seeing torrents that say ""DC"" but it's really the unrated cut that was originally released about five years ago.  i'm looking for the newest one, which I believe came out last year.

Cheers"

,n00bOfTheTorrents,2010-12-10T14:17Z,"Runtime is 88 minutes, so this is the director's cut. The unrated version is 98 minutes, and the theatrical version is 91 minutes."
