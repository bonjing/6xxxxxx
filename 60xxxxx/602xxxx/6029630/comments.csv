,ZR145,2010-12-14T22:39Z,why is no one ripping the new ones?
,hoffy97,2010-12-15T04:19Z,This one appears to actually be S08E01.  It matches the description on Discovery's page.
,ZR145,2010-12-15T09:12Z,"i know this is new, all thou scenes at the end are cut off, but i havent seen a post anywhere for the new season what are the scene groups thinking!"
,Dinwoodie,2010-12-16T06:33Z,Thanks for the upload mate! I've been waiting for the new episodes to appear! Keep up the great work!
,xenterx,2010-12-17T20:39Z,All the good stuff is cut off :(
,hoffy97,2010-12-18T05:29Z,"TVRage updated the numbering, so this now matches S01E09 (the S07E09 posted is a special, not a regular episode)"
