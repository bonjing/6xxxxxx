From Wiki:


Chicago is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Chicago, Illinois. The band began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, becoming famous for producing a number of hit ballads. They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to The Beach Boys in terms of Billboard singles and albums chart success among American bands, Chicago is one of the longest running and most successful pop/rock and roll groups.[1]

Chicago re-teamed with producer Phil Ramone in October 2010 to begin work on a new album.[2][3]

According to Billboard, Chicago was the leading U.S. singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 38 million units in the U.S., with 22 gold, 18 platinum, and 8 multi-platinum albums.[4][5] Over the course of their career they have charted five No. 1 albums, and have had 21 top ten hits. 









The best of - 40th Anniversary Edition 2007


The Best of Chicago: 40th Anniversary is the two-CD greatest hits and 31st album by American rock band Chicago, released by Rhino Records on October 2, 2007. It contains two discs containing 30 of Chicago's top 40 singles, similar to The Very Best Of: Only the Beginning, though not quite as comprehensive. It is the fourth compilation of past hits released by their label since beginning of the decade. Most of the songs on this compilation are presented as their shorter length radio-single edits, as opposed to the album versions.

Although no indication is given on the discs or the cover, the album should also be considered as 'Chicago XXXI' (31) in their official numbered order of albums, as it is preceded by Chicago XXX (30) in 2006, and followed by Chicago XXXII: Stone of Sisyphus in 2008. This is further emphasized by the display of albums on the band's website.
