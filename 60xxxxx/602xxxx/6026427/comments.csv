use this program paired with dosbox. D-fend makes dosbox run the program (commander keen) without having to type in command line every time. The instructions can be googled."

seriously, to anyone reading this, don't even bother.  the tard who uploaded this botched the directories.  you pretty much have to rename EVERYTHING to get it to run in dos.  and on top of that he bloated it with so much of his on self-advertising bullshit he deserves to have his balls chopped off."
