,tideomega,2011-04-21T09:49Z,"My install isn't running right and I followed the instructions to the letter, but during my install a window popped up called ""BS.Player codec manager and had about 6 or 7 that it had to install for my program to work. Has anyone else had this problem ? I sure it was my fault or my computers for the reason for my problem.

Please help and tell me should I uninstall and do a clean install."

,globalpuffer,2011-07-11T01:57Z,"@tideomega - Go ahead and install the missing codecs.  That is one of the cool things about BS Player.. that it recognizes what you are too dumb or lazy to install yourself and it fixes it :)  (I'm not calling you names bro, just makin a point) so dont worry, no need to uninstall or clean anything.. just install the bs player and let it to what it thinks is best.. it's a great program

@staraptoras  Uhhh, as far as I can tell, (check http://www.bsplayer.com/ )this is the newest shiny-est version.  If you know where to get something even newer, then you must work for Webteh, and be one of the developers, so why are you getting it here? hahahaha

and @ ChattChitto thanks again for another masterful release dood.  You are one of the few.. you are a pirate GOD."
