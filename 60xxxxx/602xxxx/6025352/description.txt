The Fugitive.S04E04.Sharp Edge Of Chivalry.DVDRip by OSiTV (with English subtitles)


For those who wish to play the show on stand-alone DVD players, I'm going to upload the episodes in avi format, including English subtitles.

The upload of the mkv files will continue also - the mkv files are slightly better in video quality with higher resolution, but they don't have subtitles and can't be played on stand-alone DVD players.	



NOTE:

You can find an alternate edit for this episode here:
