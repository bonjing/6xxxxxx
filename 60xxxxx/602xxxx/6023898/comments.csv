,eatmecaptain765,2011-09-23T01:51Z,"http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5389144/The_Botanist_-_About_Ghosts_%282010%29

Download this.  Not at all as heavy as SLAYER, but has a nice hard rock groove.  Saw them in Austin."
,margloto,2011-11-01T15:41Z,Great torrent! Thanks!
,darkfrost,2012-02-09T08:32Z,Zibbik you saved me again. As a mega thrash fan I own these CD's already but I recently moved and now they're all packed up. You saved me from having to dig waist deep in storage for some classic metal! No amount of thank you's via this comment can convey my true gratitude for this kick ass torrent but THANK YOU anyway...seriously!!
