    Giant Pandas were on the brink of extinction but now       
    they are coming back, thanks to an extraordinary          
    conservation project. The Chengdu Research Base in       
    central China is at the heart of a project to breed 300   
    pandas, and then start introducing them back into the      
    wild. It is the most ambitious and controversial          
    conservation effort ever mounted.                        
    Shot over two years, this film follows the pandas and     
    keepers as, through visionary science and                  
    round-the-clock care, they edge closer to the magic       
    number of 300.
