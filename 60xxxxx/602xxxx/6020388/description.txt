Originally formed in 2004, members Eric Rachmany (vocals/guitar), Matt Velasquez (vocals/guitar), Rory Carey (keyboard), Wesley Finley (drums), and Marley D. Williams (bass) met in college while residing in Isla Vista, a beach side community in Santa Barbara. Throughout 2004-2005, Rebelution began to build momentum through consistently playing local shows and by independently releasing an EP.
    
Rebelution released their first full-length album â€œCourage to Growâ€ in June 2007, which would become the breakthrough album for the band. The album was praised for its crafty melodies, socially-conscious lyrics, and savvy musicianship. â€œCourage to Growâ€ went on to garner mass downloads and radio play on stations such as San Franciscoâ€™s Live 105 where their single â€œSafe and Soundâ€ was played on heavy rotation, with spins on San Diegoâ€™s 91X and Los Angelesâ€™s KROQ. The album was selected as iTunes Editorâ€™s Choice for Best Reggae Album of 2007. In addition, â€œCourage to Growâ€ peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart.

Two years after their last album, Rebelution released their sophomore full-length album â€œBright Side of Life.â€ On August 4, 2009 â€œBright Side of Lifeâ€ was officially released and dominated the iTunes charts, solidifying the 1 spot on iTunes in the reggae music genre, and the 3 spot for top albums downloaded in the United States in all genres of music. The album reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Reggae Albums chart.
