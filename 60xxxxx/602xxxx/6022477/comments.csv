,Sandizza,2010-12-30T20:42Z,"I'm not sure I understand - issues #67, 70, 71 and 72 aren't CBR files, but RAR archives filled with PNG screenshots. My CBR reader won't support them."
,muckymucks,2010-12-31T00:54Z,Anybody know when issue 80 is coming out? It's two weeks late!
,marxm,2011-01-03T00:51Z,@Sandizza Just change the file extension to .CBR.  CBR and CBZ files are just RAR and ZIP files respectively with the images inside.
