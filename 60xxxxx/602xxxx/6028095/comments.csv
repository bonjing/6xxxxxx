,aradiel,2010-12-11T20:44Z,"If you want movies currently being shown in cinemas then you're stuck with cam and TS copies, unless a digital screener shows up.

This movie wasn't that bad. Nothing special, but then what was anyone expecting?"
,snowbirds,2010-12-12T06:23Z,LOL.  Just the picture of 50 Cent scowling his baddest gangsta scowl was satisifying enough.  I don't think I'll torture myself watching this...

,Subjazz,2010-12-15T07:40Z,"He cannot even 'act' mean in the photo hahaha 
this movie is not even worth ""50 cents"" "
,Subjazz,2010-12-15T07:42Z,I think Val Kilmer must have owed 50 cent some drug money cause he would have to do a lot of blow to be in this movie.
,Dex507,2010-12-15T21:34Z,"Please don't underestimate the movie and judge it by it's cover (which really sucks lol).
I thought the same, but it's really a good movie, trust me.
Thanks for the torrent!"
,philly12,2010-12-16T22:06Z,Its a shame to see Kilmer starring with such a talentless beeeeaaach like half a buck. All he has is that raising his eyebrow thing. What an ass
