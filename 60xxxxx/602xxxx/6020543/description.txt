Amazon Review:
Ireland's world-class ambassadors the Chieftains seem determined to play with anyone who is anyone, regardless of genre. On The Bells of Dublin, they do an exceptional job of teaming up with the likes of rockers Jackson Browne and Elvis Costello, as well as songbirds Marianne Faithfull, Rickie Lee Jones, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, and Nanci Griffith. There are many resplendent performances here, the least of which is Costello and company's raucous "St. Stephen's Day Murders." Like a banquet of traditional Irish fare with some updating to accommodate individual guests, Bells is the kind of holiday record you don't want to end.
