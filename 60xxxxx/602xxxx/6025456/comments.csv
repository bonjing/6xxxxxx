,lokust167,2010-12-20T18:53Z,"I hope this is the rip of the retail version of the BluRay disc that was officially released on December 7th 2010. The upload date seems to suggest so....

Anyway thanks a million for the upload Joeblow89"
,lokust167,2010-12-25T20:18Z,"The quality of the print is excellent.

But it is not exactly 16:9 [or 1920X1080] aspect ratio, instead it is 2.4:1 [1920X800].

Anyway, downloaded and the movie is totally worth it.Thanks for the upload."
