                    E4's BAFTA-winning superhero comedy drama  
                    Misfits returns for a second series, starring  
                    Robert Sheehan, Lauren Socha, Nathan     
                    Stewart-Jarrett, Antonia Thomas and Iwan Rheon  
                    as a posse of social outcasts who have acquired  
                    superpowers during a freak storm. In the fifth  
                    episode, Nathan is violently killed again and  
                    he suspects that Jessica, a charity worker from  
                    the community centre, is to blame. To make  
                    matters worse, Jessica seems to have targeted  
                    Simon as her next victim so the gang decide to  
                    track her down before she can strike again.  
                    Kelly meets Bruno who is on the run from the  
                    police. She hears his thoughts and he thinks  
                    she's beautiful. Has Kelly finally found her  
                    perfect man, or is there more to Bruno than  
                    meets the eye?
