,slicedt,2010-12-13T05:29Z,"thanks alot for everything thethingy!

Uhh ... could someone explain what the different training dvds do? I need one just to learn the basics of illustrator. ex. brushes, swatches, etc.

I have a new wacom device and would like to learn how to use it in illustrator. It's more of a pastime then profession.

thx,
