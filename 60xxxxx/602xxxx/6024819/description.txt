Winner of the Special Youth Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, Jean-Claude Brisseau's (SECRET THINGS, THE EXTERMINATING ANGELS, A L'AVENTURE) acclaimed film presents a brutal, shocking and poignant look at the lives of impoverished children living in the Paris projects.

Bruno, a 14 year old boy, has just moved into a high-rise project with his hard-working mother. Barely earning enough to support them takes all of her time, leaving Bruno alone to fend for himself. After he is befriended at school by the streetwise, battered and deeply troubled Jean-Roger, Bruno is soon out thieving, destroying property and harming people with a vengeance, before long catching the attention of the police...

DE BRUIT ET DE FUREUR is a trailblazing and visionary portrait of contemporary social malaise, featuring extraordinary performances from the young leads. With startling realism Brisseau denounces the dangers of a boxed-in society and questions the responsibilities of those charged with the care and education of children.
