,ddawg,2010-12-10T03:58Z,Do you really expect anyone to download a mystery torrent they know nothing about. How about a track listing a little info about what they're downloading?  Have you noticed that the fools who flood TPB with  abunch of crap they can not possible seed simtanelously rarely if ever have any leechers and almost never ever ever have any long term seeders.
,chbrla,2010-12-10T06:39Z,"Ok ""Dawg"".  If you don't like how I do it, get it somewhere else, or go die, I don't care, but don't bitch to me."
,ddawg,2010-12-10T08:49Z,"Hey moron, I haven't downloaded any of your tripe.  A 3rd grader could do a much better job of putting a torrent together. You are a F'ing idiot!"

chbrla, thanks for this.  Not my cup of tea, as I was able to unravel the huge ""mystery"" but keep them coming!"
,chbrla,2010-12-11T21:26Z,"Calm down, little doggie.  I think most people can use Wikipedia or AllMusic themselves to solve this mystery you worry about so."
,ddawg,2010-12-13T08:47Z,rjordan21 your torrents are pretty much a bunch of crap too...
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-13T15:31Z,"ddawg, coming from you that means literally......nothing."
