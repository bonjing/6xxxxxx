Hello friends,

Thanks for your continuos support!NAVIGATOR team wishes to thank all the people who keep downloading our lists.There's more and more of you each month, and we're trying hard to choose only quality stuff and include it in our playlist and make it more FRESH!!! 

Anyone who is interested in sending your own stuff (via links to downloads), we would gladly listen to your music and include it in our list or radio show if we find it good, so more people would hear it...

As always, our own radio show is on the internet radio stationevery Tuesday 7pm CET. There you will be able to hear some new stuff before we upload it on the net.

We also included artwork from our good friend Andrea Rankovic. Every month you will be able to use her artwork as cover for Navigator's Fresh!! Indie Playlists.

P.S. Special Offer this month will be two more playlists. One of them lists Best Indie songs for 2010, other best indie cover songs for 2010 chosen by Navigator team. You can try to find this lists starting from the second part of december.
