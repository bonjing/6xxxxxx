A handsome edition of the original 1981 text, this 20th Anniversary Edition makes available to business and marketing professionals--including tens of thousands of Ries and Trout groupies, worldwide--the work that forever changed the way marketing strategy is done. This new edition features commentary from the authors that offers fresh insight into why positioning a product in a prospective customer's mind is still the most important strategy in business, and includes numerous examples of campaigns that followed, or didn't follow, Ries and Trout's thinking.
