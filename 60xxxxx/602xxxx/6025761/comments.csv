,Yorkfield,2011-06-06T21:29Z,Can anyone who has DL this file please report whether this is the unlocked or the free (limited)version ? Thank you.
,clsmoove,2011-07-30T08:33Z,"It's the 0.8.0 version loaded with a load of xmas midi songs. No code/module/unlock for learning pack. I would give this a miss as there is a more recent version. The only other info in the torrent is where to get midi files:-

Quote from SongSite.txt
""When you pick a song just right click and save as to download it.
Then when you want to play the song just right click the downloaded song and play in synthesia"""
