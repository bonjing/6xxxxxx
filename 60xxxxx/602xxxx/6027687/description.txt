Showcasing the much-loved superstar's mesmerising final recordings alongside previously unreleased material, Michael is the posthumous album from Michael Jackson.

Packed with big-name collaborators, and with outstanding production throughout, this stunning collection is a worthy testament to the 'the King of Pop'. Opening with a triumphant duet with R&B superstar Akon, "Hold My Hand" is an epic and soulful ballad with rich gospel undertones. Other guests include Lenny Kravitz on "(I Can't Make It) Another Day" and 50 Cent on the excellent "Monster". For all the high-profile guests, it's Jackson himself who inevitably steals the show. The swing-influenced single, "Breaking News", is an instant highlight, while the tear-jerking finale, "Much Too Soon", is set to break hearts worldwide. With ten previously unreleased tracks, this optimistic collection doesn't dwell on poignancy, instead serving as a masterclass in catchy, three-minute gems.

Michael completes the picture of a true talent. It's a fitting release of the highest magnitude from arguably the greatest pop star of all time.
