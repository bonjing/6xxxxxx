,SinCityTm,2010-12-13T22:01Z,"Fast Download..Good band ...covers are okay, but the new song was a real disappointment  "
,G-rave-Miki,2010-12-14T11:30Z,"Don't download, and wait for 320kbs version.
Because this sounds like sh*t.

And KBS means basicly the sounds quality. So faster download, but bad quality. That's no big deal with the most genre but it is i.m.o with Post-hardcore music. "
,G-rave-Miki,2010-12-14T11:32Z,But anywayz still lots of thanks for putting these stuff online!
,kevinnroxx,2010-12-15T03:58Z,"i hear theres gunna be a dvd with this. with all the new vids and shitt, are you gunna upload that too??"
,Daltonmenn,2010-12-18T01:37Z,"thats not true at all. 320 is as high as an MP3 file can go. MP3s are a very lossy format. The highest possible quality is FLAC(lossless) which is 1,440 kbps. All CDs are in FLAC when you buy them in the store."
