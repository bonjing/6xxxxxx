,hoebywan,2010-12-11T12:28Z,To those making racist comments here. You are just showing your own fear and ignorance. I feel sorry for you and I am glad I don't dwell inside your tiny skulls. Not a fan of Hindi films myself but it takes all cultures to make up the world. You have some serious growing up to do.
