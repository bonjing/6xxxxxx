Whoopi Goldberg: Direct from Broadway (1985)
 
Between 1980 and 1984, Whoopi Gooldberg developed a one-woman show "The Spook Show", which was first presented in 1982 and later toured successfully around the USA and Europe. After opening at New York's Dance Theatre Workshop in 1983, the show became an immediate critical success and was seen by director Mike Nichols, who moved it to Broadway the following year in a revised form simply titled "Whoopi Goldberg".

In 1985, Whoopi played to sold out audiences at the Lyceum Theatre, winning a Theater World Award and a Drama Desk Award for Best Solo Performance. The performance was taped by HBO and broadcast as "Whoopi Goldberg: Direct From Broadway", and an album of the show, "Original Broadway Show Recording" won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording of the Year in 1985. 

The show brought her to the attention of Steven Spielberg, who cast her as the star of his version Alice Walker's acclaimed novel, The Color Purple, a role which jump-started her film career and earned her an Academy Award Nomination and a Golden Globe win for Best Actress.
