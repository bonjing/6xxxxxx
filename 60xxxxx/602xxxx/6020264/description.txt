"Hot in Herre" is a popular song and single performed by the hip-hop artist Nelly, and was released in 2002 as the first single on his album Nellyville. The song's producers were The Neptunes. "Hot in Herre" incorporates the hook from go-go performer Chuck Brown's 1979 #1 R&B hit "Bustin' Loose."

"Hot in Herre" has been covered by a number of artists, including The BossHoss; Jenny Owen Youngs (whose version also has an accompanying video on YouTube); Coldplay; Wang Chung, on the television show Hit Me, Baby, One More Time; Canadian electronic artist Tiga, who remade "Hot in Herre" with Scissor Sisters lead singer Jake Shears on vocals, giving it a more monotone, electro feel (this reached #46 in the UK); and Widespread Panic, whose cover was featured on an episode of The O.C., is featured on their album Jackassolantern, and was performed at one of their famed Halloween shows at UNO Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. In the live version of "Jocko Homo" on Devo's album, DEVOlution is Real: Live in Central Park, Mark Mothersbaugh briefly sings the chorus of "Hot in Herre" before Jocko Homo's "O-HI-O" breakdown. Jill Sobule covered the song acoustically at a live performance in Seattle with Melissa Ferrick. The small-time Minnesotan band "The Pickle Farmers" recorded cover that is similar in theme to that of Jenny Owen Youngs. DJ hero 2 has the song remixed with Regulate (song)
