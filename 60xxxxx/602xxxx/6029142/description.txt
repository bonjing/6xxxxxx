    * Backup Reports: Detailed backup reports can be generated each time the backup is updated. The contents of the reports can be 

configured.
    * Backup Report Emails: Backup reports can be automatically sent to an email address. That way you can be up-to-date on the state of 

your backups even when you are on a business trip or if the computer is simply a server in your attic.
    * Network support: Files and folders on network drives can also be backed up. The backup data can also be stored on network drives if 

that is desired.
    * Encryption: Backups are strongly encrypted and protected with a user password. The encryption algorithm can be configured, if that is 

desired.
    * Compression: Backups are compressed intelligently to save space. Different compression types are available: from fast ones with 

moderate compression to slower ones with excellent compression.
    * Scheduled: Backups can be started either automatically at scheduled times or manually by clicking a button.
    * Storage Types: Backups can be stored on hard disk, USB sticks, network drives and Ocster Secure Storage.
    * Supports Ocster Secure Storage:
          o Stores the files in professional data centers
          o Much safer than using hard disks or USB sticks
          o The backups are protected against fire, water damage, lightning, theft, hurricanes, ...
          o Multiple copies are kept in different locations
          o The data is transmitted to the data centers via a highly secured internet channel
          o Available for a small subscription fee.
    * Incremental backup: after an initial full backup only the changes to the previous state are stored. This saves space and reduces 

transfer times.
    * Open File Support: Files and folders that are in use can be backed up as well.
    * Hard Link and Symbolic Link Support: Hard links and symbolic links can be backed up and are properly restored as hard links and 

symbolic links.
    * Special Files: Compressed, encrypted and sparse files can also be backed up.
    * Encryption Algorithms: Backup can be encrypted the following algithms: AES 256 Bit, AES 128 Bit, BlowFish, Cast-128
    * Compression Algorithms: The software supports the following compression types: ZLib, LZMA Quick, LZMA Normal, LZMA Best
    * Small File Optimization: Through smart uses of compression the software can achieve high compression rates, even with many small 

files.

System Requirements

    * Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 (the 64 Bit version of each operating system 

is also supported)
    * 512 MB RAM
    * Free space on hard disk: ca. 125 MB

* The exact value can vary because the speed depends on the file and folder structure of the data to back up. However, the new version is 

always quite a lot faster than its predecessor.
