Herein lies a complete set of symphonies by Nikolai Myaskovsky, a Soviet composer whose works deserve to be better known. This set contains all 27 symphonies, several overtures and other miscellaneous orchestral pieces.

Performed by the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Svetlanov. These files come from a 16 CD box set.



Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
