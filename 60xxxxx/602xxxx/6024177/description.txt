Colin Devlin is one half of the critically acclaimed 'The Devlins', whose brand of acoustic-pop produced 4 stellar albums in the 80's and 90's. Here Colin goes it alone, and quite honestly, there seems to be little difference with what he did previously and it's all lacklustre at best. Three tracks standout, 'Raise The Dead', 'Democracy of One' and 'The Heart Won't Be Denied', but the rest are forgettable. Great to see Emm Gryner making an appearance on this album where she helps on backing vocals and piano. I think that this one will disappear off the musical radar as quickly as it surfaced. Shame, because Colin is certainly a talented individual.
