Jacques Feyder - Le Grand jeu aka The Full Deck (1934)
 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025198

Language	French
Subtitles	English

One of Jacques Feyderâ€™s most memorable romantic dramas, Le Grand jeu features compelling performances from Pierre Richard-Willm and Marie Bell.  Whilst the film is skilfully focused on a doomed love affair played out by the lead actors, it has an epic feel in common with many of other Feyderâ€™s films from this period.  

The desert location and poetic realist ending invite an obvious comparison with Julien Duvivierâ€™s 1935 film, La Bandera, which achieves a similar high standard of technical and dramatic quality.
