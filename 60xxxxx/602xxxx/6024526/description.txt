Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82Ã»92) is a music compilation video released by the British pop band Tears For Fears.
It was released in 1992 in conjunction with the band's first Greatest Hits album of the same name,
and features an identical track listing including the new track "Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down)"
which became another UK Top 20 hit for the band. Like the album, it also omits the band's Top 40 hit "The Way You Are" from 1983,
despite a video being made for the single at the time of its release.

The video collection was reissued on DVD in 2003 with a different cover featuring a still from the "Sowing The Seeds Of Love"
promo video under Universal Music's "Classic Clips" imprint. After the "Tears Roll Down" album made a return to the UK top 10 in 2004
(twelve years after its first release), the DVD was then reissued with the original white "sunflower" cover.
The video and DVD releases also have the same track listing though the DVD includes a 5.1 surround sound audio option as well as 2.0 stereo.
