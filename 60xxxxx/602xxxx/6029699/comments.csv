[T],ajaxen94,2011-01-30T17:16Z,episode 12 has been put back 1 week to feb 4th along with Smallville for some unknown reason you will just have to wait i'm afraid
,ust2,2011-01-31T07:17Z," Weird.. E12 said ""New"" on my digital cable's info, but i'm never home friday nights to actually watch it so i'm not sure if it was.

 Oh well I guess I can wait another week, pretty much everything this week was a repeat for some reason though, getting bored as hell!"
