,mizhop,2010-12-13T06:42Z,"Outstanding quality short of HD!  Dunno if it's the movie, or if it's meant to be part of the soundtrack, but the music clicks somewhat noticeably later on in the film, but it does NOT take away from the watchability whatsoever... i'm surprised this torrent isn't higher in the list. EXCELLENT up!  Thank you Hero#1, and to all the seeders!
