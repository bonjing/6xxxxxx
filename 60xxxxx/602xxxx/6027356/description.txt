Thursday, 09 December 2010


[sebaygo1]


Filling in for Peter is Michael Pento, who will interview Catherine Mann, professor of global finance at Brandeis University, on the recent sell-off of U.S. Treasuries and how the Democrats\' scuttling of Obama\'s tax bill could impact markets. Later in the show Mark Calabria, director of Financial Regulation Studies at the Cato Institute, will join us to discuss how the Federal Housing Authority is considering creating more havoc in the mortgage market, and whether a new Congress could spell a brighter future for the banking industry. 

Michael takes calls on politics, finance, and the economy.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the \"big 
 picture.\" A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you\'ve researched it yourself.
