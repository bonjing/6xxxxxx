,lordtalix,2010-12-11T23:23Z,"This may be a stupid question, but is the initial sudo code that needs to be pasted into Terminal exact, or does the file path need to be adjusted?

I get to the point of opening Photoshop to click ""Deactivate"", only ""Deactivate"" is grayed out and I can't click it.  Will the software work if just a serial is entered?"

I installed it and everything, but i didn't deactivated it, I just used the serial number instead of clicking continue trial and it seemed to work fine?
Is it gonna crash anytime soon?"

Thanks a lot !"
,linux231,2011-01-25T02:04Z,"Thanks heaps! Works perfectly.
I followed your instructions up to where you start photoshop. When I started it, it had the options of starting the trial or entering a serial. I entered the serial and it works. (At the start of the installation I did click trial). Just wanted to say, incase it helps anybody.

Anyway, thanks! :D"
,magalona18,2011-01-25T14:11Z,works great! had to create admin password though to make terminal work! coz i left it blank during setup!

,thrillzone,2011-01-26T21:44Z,"It worked perfectly for me, except when I quit photoshop and opened it again, Adobe Application Manager popped up and it asked for a serial number or to use it as a trial.

What's going on?"
,CoutureDesBibelots,2011-01-26T22:15Z,I have managed to get as far as step 4.  Can I please get some assistance because I don't know what a 'terminal' application is or how to open it to paste in the code.  Your help would be much appreciated.  Thank you.

,imc02115,2011-02-06T05:46Z,"this worked fine, thank you. ""deactivate"" was greyed out, but it didn't matter, i closed and reopened PS and entered a serial and there was no issue.

btw - for ppl having problems w/ entering your password in terminal

1.) it's your OSX password - your main account password

2.) there is no cursor, when you are typing, you are entering text. just hit return and all will be well."

,nouchka,2011-04-16T22:21Z,"thanks very much it works great ^^ !!

@foreheadface 
you have to run the trial version & go in help menu, deactivate isn't grey anymore so you can click it..."
,TigersBlood,2011-04-21T11:39Z,The reason the Deactivate is gray is because you are opening it as a trial. try and put in the serial number and then deactivate.

I followed all the instructions, my host files are correctly modified, yet after I enter the serial number (valid, I get the green check mark), am I just supposed to click close or do I click continue?  Because if I click continue, it takes me to the activation page and it seems that nothing I am doing is ""fooling"" adobe's servers because it's asking me for an adobe login or to create one.  Is this normal and should I just press continue?  Every time I open PS, the Adobe Activation manager pops up asking for either the serial or to continue the trial.  Is this supposed to happen?  At what point does the Adobe Activation stop popping up, if ever?"

Worked flawlessly, just make sure to click ""patch host file"" button.

My process:
1. Installed trial version CS5
2. Closed CS5
3. Ran core keygen using patch host file button      before generating keygen
4. Closed core keygen
5. Ran CS5 and deactivated permanently
6. Closed CS5
7. Opened CS5
8. Used generated keygen

Had no problems here guys.  Works great.

In order to access hosts now open terminal and enter (sudo nano /etc/hosts) Without the brackets of course.

Once you're in paste the text as it says in the instructions, you must use your arrow keys to scroll down and across inside the terminal. Once you have done this press ctrl + x followed by enter. Do not use cmd + S as this will only save the file into your documents.

I tried this on TWO operating systems - both Lion and Snow Leopard 10.6.8 (the most current version at time of posting).

I followed the instructions verbatim and didn't skip any steps.

On BOTH systems, the option to click ""Deactivate"" was gray and un-clickable.

So, I ignored this and continued on. After trying to to print something, photoshop CRASHED and MY WORK WAS LOST. I re-opened it and tried again. CRASH AGAIN.

Thanks, but no thanks Cyberpiraten. I think it's time for you to get out of the torrent business."

I kept cleaning off and reinstalling because of the Application manager prompt popping up.  On a third try.  It popped up again.  After the terminal drill, reset host application, etc.  So I just follow the instructions that adobe stated to do.  Download application manager (don't do it) or reinstall.  I reinstalled. or attempted to the point where you can add a serial # or do trial.   3rd trial, I skipped the trial.  I just went through the list of serials.  And one worked.  Now, the who suite works.   Make sure you have little snitch.    Good luck"
,vanTorX,2011-09-28T06:19Z,"@ jonmaxx 
The deactivation feature is for people who run two (or maybe more) copies of Photoshop on LAN on different computers. To use Photoshop on the second computer you need to deactivate it on the first one. Not sure that's exactly how it is but that's the idea. I keep it activated and use it on one Mac. IMO the 'activation/deactivation has nothing to do with successfully cracking. 
And those who have not entered serial yet have the choice to deactivate greyed out, it only becomes active choice once you enter good serial # 
(but then as I said you can leave it activated if you don't plan to run another copy of the program on another computer at home. In fact to run this copy I think it has to be activated or maybe it activates automatically once you start the program - provided good serial was entered originally.)

BTW I would just ignore this thing about malware, I don't know about anything and have it installed since this spring. 

I believe you can print but I am not the user of the Mac in question, will test it tomorrow."
,vanTorX,2011-09-28T06:30Z,Just tested printing on that old install of this program running on SL 10.6.8 (orig install was on 10.6.5 or so) and it works just fine. In few days I will install clean Lion and install this program into it and test it again.

,triley,2011-11-08T00:57Z,"10.7.2 users: 

Download a free program called 'Little Snitch'. Don't worry about the hosts file, you won't need to change it in the way noted in the torrent. Install as normal, when prompted for a serial during installation click 'trial version'. Once installed (make sure little snitch is running too), run the program - it will immediately prompt you for another serial. enter one of these:

1325-0150-1163-7532-1626-3430
1325-0178-1927-9019-0123-2254
1325-0702-3693-1544-9166-3515
1325-0549-2240-0071-3409-1342

Little Snitch will then report that the software is trying to access adobe's activation servers. click 'forever' and 'deny'. Enjoy.

Thanks for this great torrent. Good work. After installing these, I can't visit Adobe.com.. I guess this has to do with the fact that it is blocked via the hosts file.

,bananatechs,2012-06-27T06:12Z,"If you're getting errors at step 4 read this http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2754/os_x_edit_file_using_textedit_as_root_superuser/

Basically what you want to enter is 

sudo open -t /etc/hosts/ /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts


If you have trouble at step 5 in text edit (which is where this didn't work when my friend tried it) 
go to the torrent download > hosts folder > open the document that says 'this is how the host file should look' 
I copied the text in that instructions file and put it into my mac's text edit document (easiest way to make sure there isn't any error on your part when editing the text) 

after this all the steps worked. Before doing this I DID NOT get the option to decative, I didn't even get it blocked out - it just wasnt there. Some of you tried entering a serial - maybe so that you could actually be active as to deactive. I thought this anyway and I tried it because I wasn't understanding why it wasn't working. 

Anyway do what I suggested for step 5 and you will be able to deactive. after that all the steps work just fine. If some of the serials provided in instructions don't work don't worry - any working serial will do. 

Hope this helps for anyone that's having trouble. I could be wrong, but as I said, it works for me now. I opened and closed the program a few times to make sure I wouldn't be asked for a serial again and it's fine. 

You will need an Adobe ID to enter after deactivating - do this. A thank you screen from adobe will come up. Basically you now have the software, Adobe thinks it's registered. There really should be no more problems. If I get any more problems I'll try solving them and post anything useful. But I think this should be it. This is my first time using a Photoshop torrent so there was a bit of confusion but it's ended well. 

Thanks Cyberpiraten! "
