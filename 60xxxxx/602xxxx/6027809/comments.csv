what is your problem mp4 is good it works on ps3 why dont you either convert it or burn it OR just be grateful your getting it for free!!

thanks amanrulz great quality as always"
,guy_wild,2010-12-11T18:50Z,"@DarthExile You are ignorant and an idiot. 

Converting this to a format the PS3 can understand is a piece of cake. Even for a lameass like you. Download ConvertXtoDVD and Bob's your uncle.

And even more - shut up with the bitching, it's free, ain't it?

A 1000 thank yous to amanrulz. U *do* rule."
,AH6194,2010-12-12T15:45Z,Why is there blurring for the commercials at the bottom of the screen? 
,AH6194,2010-12-12T15:56Z,"Or the ads, whatever you call them.."
