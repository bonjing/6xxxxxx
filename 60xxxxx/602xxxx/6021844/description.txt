	Irving's classic tale is now told through the animated Disney feature by the voice of Bing Crosby. Ichabod Crane comes to Sleepy Hollow to fill in as a pedagogue in the town. While there, his heart beats when he sees the beautiful Katrina Van Tassel who is the flirtatious village beauty. Brom Bones however, the village hero, is not about to let Ichabod take his Katrina, so he attempts to stop the pedagogue at all costs- even if he has to twist the ghostly story of the Headless Horseman to his advantage.

	Here's another I can't find anywhere for downloading. This is the original that I dubbed from the Disney Channel in the late '80s. It includes the introduction about the life of the writer, Washington Irving - really nice!

It's a fair, VHS quality copy, but personally, I think it's quite watchable. Hope you can enjoy. ;-)
