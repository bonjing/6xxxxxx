Warcraft II Battle NET Edition with fixes for Windows 7 by mudlord.

This is a complete rip of the game. All single player components of the game are intact. It is *not* intended for multiplayer, so if you want multiplayer, buy the game.

Via heavy modification of the game, I saved around 300MB of the original image size while keeping everything intact. This includes all music, speech, cinematics and the map editor's components, with no loss of quality. This also has been cracked manually by me for your pleasure. For Windows 7 users, I developed a hook DLL to wrap DirectDraw to OpenGL, so pallete problems are a thing of the past.

I mainly created this release for myself, but since I figure that old games deserve community patching for the greater good, I decided to make this public.


To install, simply run the installer and follow its prompts.
