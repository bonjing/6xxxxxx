Plot: Roll out with Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Arcee, Ratchet, Bulkhead, and
more
as the heroic Autobots battle the evil Decepticons. Now that big bad Megatron has a
rare
element that lets him rule over life itself, "Team Prime" needs human help more than
ever.
That's where the Teens -- Jack, Miko, and Raf -- come in. As they work together to
defend Earth, the drama is just as intense as the heavy metal action.
