,MaximilianKohler,2011-03-30T22:18Z,"@Cespur
lol not sure what player you're using to watch it but with VLC the video is 7 at the lowest, most of it is 8
he ripped it from a blue ray disc down to 700mb size so of course it's gonna lose quality, if you want more quality you gotta download a larger file."

,Fre0n,2011-07-09T10:31Z,All we saying that this torrent is mislabeled - it is not Hi-Res. As I browse through Hi-Res torrents I see more and more torrents which are 700 MB or 2 GB in size. They are not Hi-Res!
