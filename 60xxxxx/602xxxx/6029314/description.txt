Doctor Faustus is a 1967 film adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus, written in 1588. The first theatrical film version of a Marlowe play, it starred and was directed by Richard Burton, (Nevill Coghill is also given credit for directing), who played the title character Faustus. Elizabeth Taylor made a silent cameo appearance as Helen of Troy, an appearance at which critics of the day invariably sneered. The overriding consensus of the critics was that the Oxford student Andreas Teuber stole the show as Mephistopheles.

The film is a permanent record of a stage production that Burton starred in and staged with Coghill at the Oxford University Dramatic Society in 1966. Burton wouldn't appear onstage again until he took over the role of Martin Dysart in Equus on Broadway ten years later.
