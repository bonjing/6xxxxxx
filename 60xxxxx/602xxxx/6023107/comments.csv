its not only online with developer cd-key???"
,leetality,2010-12-09T14:07Z,@Rando_q1 It's just an expansion pack. You still need to get yourself a legit account with the previous expansions and an active subscription to play with battle.net or find a private server already running cataclysm (highly unlikely).

,marceleon,2010-12-13T17:57Z,"i am sorry for the stupid question but, this is the entire game world of warcraft with all the expansions or just the expansion cataclysm?
if it is the entire game let me thank you very much, here in brazil internet connection is not very good, downloading by torrent is mine only salvation.
other question, i am almost certain that it is US but i will ask any way, its US or EU"
,heroin99,2010-12-13T18:40Z,"@marceleon This is the Cataclysm expansion pack + all older content as far as I can tell..

Its confusing because the last expansion i.e, Wrath of the Lich King was also a 8GB DVD and it contained all the old content as well as the expansion pack.

Most probably this is too contains the base game + first 2 expansions + cataclysm expansion

But IDK if its US or EU, guess we are boned here.. hehehe"
,heroin99,2010-12-13T18:41Z,"Ignore my last comment, made an error.. I meant to say THIS IS JUST THE CATACLYSM EXPANSION. You will still need to have everything else installed before you can install this."

,zhongguohua88,2011-01-02T22:22Z,@lemonpledge007 You need to buy the game to play on American servers. You do not need to buy the game to play on Taiwanese servers but it is rather complicated to set up an account if you cannot read Chinese. There are ways to play on Taiwanese servers with an English version of the game if you really want to go through that trouble.
,Whatjusthappened,2011-01-03T19:46Z,"When you buy the retail version (box) set of WoW it comes with a free month of game time I think. Since you can also download this for free off of their website you're just paying the typical monthly fee. If you don't mind sticking with Wrath of the Lich King a bit longer, go to moltenwow and play there; it's the best private server by far."
,jokha,2011-01-04T21:04Z,don't ask stupid question ppl!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you want cataclysm you still have to get an activation key for your account... if you want to get cataclysm YOU HAVE TO BUY IT! there is no way to get it free.

,Torx8,2011-01-06T11:06Z,"TO ALL THE PEOPLE ASKING ABOUT THIS ISO!!
This ISO is ONLY the EXPANSION pack, you STILL need ""WORLD OF WARCRAFT"", ""THE BURNING CRUSADE"" and ""WRATH OF THE LICH KING"" installed before installing this EXPANSION.
Also this game is an MMO-game (MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER ONLINE) - so there is NO singleplayer, has never been any singleplayer and will never have any singleplayer options.
To play you need to 1) Pay for all the games and all the previous expansion packs + also need to pay 13â‚¬ per month to Blizzard. or 2) You find a PRIVATE Server where you don't have to pay for anything at all. Though it WILL take time before Cataclysm is supported by PRIVATE Servers.
Now stop asking questions."
,Torx8,2011-01-06T11:12Z,"Also, never trust anyone selling gold or selling anything at all concerning the legit world of warcraft since the sellers will (with 90% certainty) steal your account information if they ask you for the information. You SHOULD get an Authenticator.
Also you will get banned for buying gold or using bots."

,MundiTec,2011-04-30T03:29Z,"Ao contrario de muitos comentÃ¡rios anteriores ao meu. 

Nao Ã© necessÃ¡rio ter todas as licenÃ§as para utilizar esta .ISO do WOW, 

Para comeÃ§ar a jogar basta ter apenas a primeira licenÃ§a que Ã© a do WOW ClÃ¡ssico.

A unica limitaÃ§Ã£o caso o jagodor nao tenha todas as licenÃ§as serÃ¡ que ele verÃ¡ todos os mapas mas sÃ³ terÃ¡ permissÃ£o para entrar nos mapas que a licenÃ§a do jogo permite.

Exemplo: 

O Jogador baixou esta ISO  do Cataclysm, mas so tem a chave para jogar o Classico
Entao ele verÃ¡ todos os mapas do WOW mas nao poderÃ¡ sair de Eastern Kingdom, nao poderÃ¡ passar do Level 60 (Level Maximo 85)  e dentro de Eastern Kingdom ele nao terÃ¡ acesso as areas que sao referentes aos Burn crusade, Lich king e Cataclysm. 

Baixar esta ISO Ã© mais rapido do que baixar o Jogo completo direto do site da Blizzard. 

Apos baixar estes 7GB de imagem e instalar no PC, o Launcher.exe serÃ¡ executado e irÃ¡ baixar mais 8.1GB  e atualizarÃ¡ o jogo para ultima versÃ£o, pois a cada semana sai no mÃ­nimo 4Mb de atualizaÃ§Ã£o e varios Packs (correÃ§Ãµes de bugs) ja sairam apos o lanÃ§amento do Cataclysm. 

Um total de 23GB apos tudo baixado e instalado, e esse tamanho continua aumentado a cada semana.

Logo esta ISO nao se trata de pirataria porque ela sem as devidas licenÃ§as sÃ£o inÃºteis.

Atualmente para jogar Ã© necessario comprar no minimo a primeira e no maximo 4 licenÃ§as, Que sÃ£o: a do Classico (permite ir atÃ© o Lv60), Burn crusade (permite ir atÃ© o Lv70), Lich king (permite ir atÃ© o Lv80) e Cataclysm (permite ir atÃ© o Lv85).

Todas as licenÃ§as (4 atualmente) sai em um total de + ou - R$130,00 (conforme a cotaÃ§Ã£o do dolar)
e claro se comprado direto na loja virtual da Blizzard. (us.blizzard Stores)

Apos comprar a licenÃ§a Ã© necessario pagar a  mensalidade que sai por R$23,00 a R$30,00 dependendo da cotaÃ§Ã£o do dolar. 

E como a Blizzard esta com sede no Brasil esse valor segundo rumores deve cair apos a versÃ£o oficial do Jogo em Portugues Brasil. Algo previsto para julho de 2011.

Ahhh .. Baixar esta iso e atualiza-la deixa o jogo menor comprado a quem esta fazendo update  desde quando so existia o Classico.

Valeu 

Baixado e aprovado."

,possumboy,2011-08-29T18:46Z,"A few round-up comments, off the top of my head.

First, Torx8 put the most relevent comments in this entire thread, if you have issues, go read this users post straight away!

Now, to try to help all the people that seem to be confused about authentication keys... The easiest thing to do is to try to think in these terms;
Its the KEY you are buying when you buy a legit copy, NOT the game as such. You can download all of this software direct for free from Blizzards own webste, always could. Its the KEY that costs the money.

As has been said before, the contents of this torrent will NOT get you onto Blizzards paid, legit servers.
It will however get you onto your choice of private server. (Dont ask me how to do that, go research it yourself, like I and the rest of us did.)

If you want to play the legit game, you have to pony up the cash, simple as that. If you dont HAVE to play the legit version, find a private server. You'll be fine.

The point of this torrent is that its a quicker download than the one from Blizzard. Thats it. So if youve lost the disc, you can do it this way. Alternatively, its for the use it was designed for. So that you can download the content then buy a key from Blizzard to play on their regular, legit servers, without haveing to go out to the shops and buy a copy or wait for the one ordered online to arrive. Its purely for the users convenience.

As to the versions needed. You still need ALL of the previous content, ie WoW, TBC, WotLK.
You then need to patch it all up to the patch the private server you have chosen is working from. 

You can find the patches individually online, simply download them and apply manually up to the patch you need to be running from.
Don't try to update your install from Blizzard as you may end up with a version that is too advanced for your server. At that stage you'll have to essentially start again.
Once again, dont ask me where to find the patches, go research yourself and stop being a brain drain on the rest of us. If you do, you'll never need to ask again! Wont that be nice?!

Hopefully, this has answered most of the questions (if people bother to read all this stuff) and you now have a clearer idea of what you are talking about.

Please try to inform yourselves first! Believe me, we all started knowing nothing, but some of us chose to learn. Knowledge is power, and there are far too many powerless people here!"

Thanks .BONE. for posting this in the first place! ;)"
,LittleMrJ,2011-10-05T00:51Z,"Since when does WoW require key-codes? I'm currently looking at a 5 disk set of the original WoW, the Burning Crusade expansion, & Wrath of the Lich King. They all have authentication keys on the CD covers, but anyone whose ever installed the shit KNOWS that you're NEVER asked to enter a key, ever.
If Cataclysm happens to be the first WoW disk which requires a key entry, then just crack that shit, you idiots. I can't believe how some of you are acting as though it's impossible to use this torrent.
Blizzard is making bank from server subscriptions, not game sales. If you have a cracked Cataclysm copy, just add it to your previously expanded WoW folder, & then pay for the Blizz server...you'll be good to go! It ain't like you have to register the fucking program with them.
I've never before seen such idiotic questions & dumbass responses in all of Pirate Bay as I see here.
Do NOT download this expansion from the official server, or you WILL be required to enter a key unless you reinstall everything from the beginning (you can't uninstall an expansion once it's overlapped onto the previous game), but a cracked disk will work just fine (unless it's a burn of the official download)."

,capmoq,2012-01-07T14:08Z,"Hey guys this is your chance to play on the best Cataclysm server in Europe. No lag, no crashes!
The server is Romanian but a new international realm ""Exodus"" was opened.
This is by far the best and most superb server out there.
It's patch 4.0.6 but works with all patches (4.0.6 - 4.x.x). You can download the game from Blizzard if you want to.
PVP is working 98% and most of the Cataclysm instances are scripted.
NOTE - Replace all (.) with dots - remove the ()
IF you want to give this server a chance then follow this link:
wow(.)freakz(.)ro/register.php?inviter=1654
First 10 days it's instant lvl 85!!!


Here are the steps:
1) Register on the link
2) After registration go to WoW - Data - enGB - realmlist(.)wtf (open with notepad).
There replace set realmlist xxxxxxxx with set realmlist wow(.)freakz(.)ro (the first line).
3) Then go back to wow(.)freakz(.)ro site and on the left panel click on ""Download Launcher"".
4) Install the launcher to the WoW folder.
5) Launch the game, log in, create a character and have fun!


It's as simple as that! My name on Exodus realm is Capmoq / Plight / Prodigy.
Feel free to ask any question in game! See you out there ;)"
