,jaidi,2010-12-10T03:12Z,"Hmmm, there's always one eh Dean? If isover2010 has an issue with torrent sites then why is he/she here in the first place and why does the idiot not take up the 'problem' with the site rather than picking on individuals who are doing a great service to their ex-pat fans?
Please don't let it bother you Dean, and thanks again for your extra work this week. X"
