Heres a steam of the show if you want it to stream, http://www.spacecast.com/toddandthebookofpureevil.aspx."

,KUrt7,2010-12-11T23:05Z,The streaming on space doesn't work if you live outside canada.  I've managed to find the first 4 episodes but 5-10 are proving more difficult.  I've tried uploading the first 4 but something's not working.
