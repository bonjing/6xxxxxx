Full Sedona Method video course made in 1992 by the now-extinct Sedona Institute.

When this was made, Lester Levenson was still in charge of all course materials and the way it was taught so it is in a very pure form.

Therefore this may seem a little different from todays courses by Hale and Larry.

Included is the workbook used in the course, and the complete chart of emotions with extra pages about each heading.

The workbook comes in two parts (both included in the same file). This is because the course is meant to be done over a two-week period.

This is the pure Sedona Method, as the creator intended.

Enjoy.
