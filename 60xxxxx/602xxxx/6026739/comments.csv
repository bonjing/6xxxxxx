,ddawg,2010-12-10T04:02Z,Cut back on the discount 'stoopid' pills and try posting one torrent at a time ensuring your torrents are FULLy seeded before moving onto the next.
,chbrla,2010-12-10T06:42Z,Done deal....provided you lay off the smug prick syrup.  You seem a little addicted.
,ddawg,2010-12-10T08:50Z,I'm addicted to quality postings... rather than a buch of mystery crap some twerp decides to pollute TBP with
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-10T12:07Z,Thanks chbrla for posting something I probably wouldn't have discovered myself.  Impressive body of work Abdullah Ibrahim has!  I'm looking forward to it.  Especially after the deluge of Christmas music recently.......
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-10T12:18Z,"ddawg, who elected you to moderate the content of TPB? At least listen to something before you open your mouth and let the world know you're a fool. Let me guess you were one of those 2-dimensional idiots who got her ass kicked for saying ""stoopid"" shit in High School right?  Perhaps you're still attending?  Run along and fa-la-la....."
,chbrla,2010-12-11T21:23Z,"rjordan, I'm glad someone appreciates these posts.  This is maybe my favorite Ibrahim, so I put it up first, but I have a few more to post soon."
,ddawg,2010-12-13T08:50Z,rjordan21 you are one of the biggest losers I've seen on the sites...
[T],rjordan21,2010-12-13T15:34Z,"ddawg, coming from you that means literally......nothing.  "
,Jack2BADJ,2012-02-06T22:29Z,"If I might just say, thanks for the music. I love Abdullah Ibrahim! Lotta Magic!"
