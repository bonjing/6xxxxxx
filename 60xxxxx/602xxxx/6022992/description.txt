    The desire for freedom and escape has driven human         
    inventiveness through the ages. In this episode,          
    Wallace and Gromit explore incredible transportation     
    inventions from around the globe.                         
                                                               
    In our 'Contraption Countdown' the focus is on peculiar   
    transport devices, and we find out how to cross the      
    River Thames in a plastic bag. We discover the            
    intention behind laser propulsion in the creation of       
    flying saucer technology, and meet Cedric Lynch, an       
    illustrious engineer who invented electric tricycles,    
    as he competes in the world famous TT race on the Isle    
    of Man with his electric motorbike.                        
                                                              
    We take a trip to St. Petersburg in Russia and meet      
    Mikhail Puchkov, who has spent the last 30 years          
    building his own submarine. We meet Sir Clive Sinclair,    
    who devised the first digital watches, home computers     
    and pocket calculators, but who still has plans to       
    revolutionise personal transport.                         
                                                               
    Jem Stansfield looks at Brunel's Atmospheric Railway      
    system, and discovers that perhaps it wasn't the         
    failure history remembers it being.
