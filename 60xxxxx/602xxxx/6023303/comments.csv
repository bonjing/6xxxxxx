,iAmJeSuS,2010-12-09T10:20Z,Wheres the SD version? and why is everyone seeding and leeching S21E08? Usually today this time the new episode is out like 1000+ seeders...
,acc_secret,2010-12-09T10:55Z,"Everyone is seeding S21E08 because Eztv just posted it today. It's an old episode that Eztv forgot to post when it aired, so they had the brilliant idea to fix this mistake today, and many people don't see that it's an oldie.

Now, we're indeed waiting for a SD version of episode 13 :)"
,danroberto,2010-12-09T11:08Z,"where's the EZTV version? 
s21e13 is up again for some reason..."
,SilicaStorm,2010-12-09T18:26Z,"still waiting for the 350MB version S21E13.

I too downloaded the ""latest active"" Survivor torrent to find it was an episode from several weeks ago.

Why upload this torrent at the exact time it is posted each week?

Not like EZTV to pull pranks.... "
,solidpuma,2010-12-09T20:15Z,"Eztv didn't pull a prank. Is a simple a human error of mixing 2 episodes they hadn't posted.
Only rest us know how long will it take for them to post ep13 or if they will skip altogether."
,arbnormusic,2010-12-10T01:19Z,this torrent basically sucksss.. do NOT download it.
