Description: 

SoundHound is an awesome app, very much like Shazam, which can listen to and identify music; however SoundHound goes a step farther by allowing you to identify songs by singing it, humming the tune, typing or speaking into the phone! Available for both Android and iPhone, once a song is tagged you get access to a lot of info about the artist including bio, related songs, and videos, option to buy the song with link to Amazon MP3 store, social sharing options, and lyrics if available.

Features:

  -  The world's fastest music recognition on tunes playing from a speaker
  -  The world's only singing and humming search
  -  Instant lyrics and artist info
