10 Episodes in total featuring: BUTT-O-WEEN: 'Tis the season for terrorizing your neighbors. And these classic Beavis and Butt-Head episodes have tricks and treats so sweet you'll get a stomachache. The hapless mischief-makers dress up for Halloween, hang out with a psychopathic murderer, screw up lame pranks, and go door to door selling candy. So, smash that pumpkin and turn off the lights. Beavis and Butt-Head are about to make you scream -- with laughter. BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO CHRISTMAS: 'Tis the season to be cool, as Beavis and Butt-Head star in their own twisted versions of two holiday classics. The ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future struggle to teach a scrooge-like Beavis the true meaning of Christmas, while Charlie the Angel comes down from heaven to show Butt-Head how much better life would be without him. Will Beavis and Butt-Head learn their lesson? Does a snowflake have a chance in hell?

Note:  To watch this movie on your PC, you'll need to download and install a virtual DVD drive. I recommend Virtual Clone Drive, by Slysoft.  I also use CloneDVD to burn, but most other DVD burning programs will probably do the job.
