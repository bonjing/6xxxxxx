,wilknights3,2010-12-10T18:18Z,full album with all album covers thanks for the upload!
,ceilingtracer,2010-12-11T19:46Z,"track 14 isn't the bonus track to the CD.  It's not even Kanye, its some douche named King Kayvan.  It is one of the shittiest songs I've ever heard. "
,wilknights3,2010-12-15T16:52Z,No one is a bigger douchbag than kanye. I thought the last track was kanye...sounds as good as him or better. 
,techjunky1,2010-12-15T17:31Z,"@ceiling, You got a cd quality (320kbs) full kanye album for free. If you want to complain about bonus tracks go the the record store and buy it, cheapskate. As far as king kayvan goes, it's a really catchy tune. 

@wil, I agree with you on that!"
