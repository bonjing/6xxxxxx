,drgonz1,2010-12-11T16:05Z,Seems like the plot for Lars von Triers - Antichrist... is it just as fucked up?
,stan66,2010-12-11T20:40Z,fake fake fake
,costello66,2010-12-11T23:55Z,"Excellent quality and fast download. Thanks! The Lionsgate embed that pops up now and again doesn't interfere. The movie wasn't as good as I'd hoped, but it was worth watching."
,formyself,2010-12-12T06:42Z,Great quality but a terrible movie...very depressing and boring.  What a waste of time!
,Metalprofi666,2010-12-12T16:23Z,boooooooooooooooring!
,bychance,2010-12-13T01:16Z,"stan66, you're the only fake here."
,MongHead,2010-12-13T03:19Z,how the hell do you upload on to this site?? 
,dlarrym1111,2010-12-13T05:49Z,"@monghead - you need to download some free Bittorrent client software. For a mac I;d get 'TRANSMISSION"" for a PC clone, uTorrent. If you have a mac that is newer, running OS 10.5, w/Intel processors, you too can get uTorrent. My Mac is a PPC, Not Intel based so I can't run uTorrent. U Torrent may have been one of the 1st out there that when run, ran without too many hickups. By now its pretty stable. It has the most features then any of the other Bittorrent Apps. If my Mac could run it, I'd prefer utorrent. I highly recommend you research the protocol at 1 of many many forums on the subject. Regular click on the file to download it WILL NEVER WORK. You MUST have a BitTorrent app to retrieve any of the files you see on this or any other BitTorrent site. good luck!"
,Uday123,2010-12-14T01:56Z,thanks
,robiegoldwell,2010-12-16T03:02Z,you need to download and install utorrent then press magnet link xx
,Phatfish,2010-12-19T22:02Z,"@drgonz1:

Yes, It's as fucked up, unfortunately not in that good way, but, just plain stupid.

Having a 43 year old hag play the role of a women that lost her child and talking about maybe having another one. BUT no ""IT TOO SOON.."" 

MMmmkey...

DERP"

Great quality. Thanks raymondhome."
,Sebastian_b,2011-02-16T14:03Z,Got a copyright infringement notice from Comcast for downloading this. Comcast is probably about to pull the plug on my connection. Dang. 
,maknojetski,2011-02-18T11:23Z,I just got an infringement and I had peer guardian running. Shit they were quick. Had the torrent running for 2 hours only! Those fuckers are getting smarter..
,Guija,2011-02-23T05:22Z,"Excellent quality, but crap movie for Danielle Steel's readers though. Thank you!"
,frijolito,2011-02-25T00:32Z,"No infringement notices here. I doubt that those guys who posted actually got them, they sound more like industry shills to me.

While some people may get those notices, most of us don't. Go ahead and seed without fear everyone. If you're really paranoid install peerblock and chill the f out."
,rexus07,2011-03-03T19:35Z,"Hey Frijolito
I copped an infringement notice also. Have the latest updated PeerBlock running.
