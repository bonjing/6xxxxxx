Notes: Sam Chatmon was never put in the limelight with the Mississippi Sheiks. In fact, there are plenty who do not even consider him a member of the famed group. This CD puts him in the light he deserved. Donning a nice Gibson L series guitar and a nice Santa-Clausish style beard, Sam Chatmon busts forth every single track on this recording with all of the pep this aging bluesman could offer. He hits upon every single style popular back in his day, including traditional country blues songs, more folkish type songs, a bluegrassy type band on the last two tracks, Mississippi John Hurt style fingerpicking on "The Chatmon Family Rag", and even a nice bluesy Tribute to the master, W.C. Handy with the St. Louis Blues. He also pays tribute to his brother Bo Carter (Armenter Chatmon) in several of his songs, including "Old Devil" and "Let's Get Drunk Again" (Cleverly titled "I Got The Whiskey"). He also tributes Bukka White (Shake 'Em On Down) and Jimmy Rogers (That's Alright), and even his old group, the Sheiks (Sitting On Top Of The World). Sam belts out his blues licks, snapping strings left and right, and having just a good old time talking between the verses when he's not singing.

If you never got to hear Sam at his finest, and always felt he was never put forth enough (Walter Vincson was good, but played way too much), this CD is for you. Even if you loved Sam's recording with the Sheiks, it still is for you. And last, if you've never heard country blues and want to listen to an originator, yet modern recordings, PICK THIS ONE UP. Don't let the import sign fool you, these are fine quality and the cream of the crop. Thanks for giving one more go before you left us, Sam. We all miss you.
