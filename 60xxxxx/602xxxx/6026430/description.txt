A highly entertaining rock documentary, Let the Good Times Roll combines film clips from the 1950s with footage from a rock & roll revival show filmed in the early '70s. As is not always the case with such things, most of the artists are in fine shape in their latter-day performances, with the Coasters jiving their way through "Charlie Brown," Little Richard acting as outrageous as ever, Bo Diddley electrifying the crowd with a loud blast of wild, primal guitar stomp, and Chuck Berry trading licks with Bo on a killer version of "Johnny B. Goode." One of the few movies about '50s rock that well and truly rocks, Let the Good Times Roll is a movie to play loud.

This version was ripped from a TV broadcast on Turner Movie Classics, and every once in a while their logo shows up at the bottom of the screen, but it was broadcast totally uncut, in widescreen with no commercials . This is a great copy of the film.
