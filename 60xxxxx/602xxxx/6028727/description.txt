Key Conversations for Positive Change--SAY IT RIGHT FOR BUSINESS AND CAREER SUCCESS
Whether youâ€™re trying to motivate a team, negotiate a contract, make a sale, ask for a raise, land a new job, or terminate an employee, the conversations you have will either help you succeed or undermine your goals. Communication expert and leadership coach Shawn Kent Hayashi has spent more than two decades studying how the things people say impact their business and professional lives.
