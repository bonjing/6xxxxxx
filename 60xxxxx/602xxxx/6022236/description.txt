Sorry we're late with this and the next few releases, but they got pushed further back so we could work on other releases like the HP's... so sorry folks :) Right... for this we made a small script which contained crop, resize, white balance, rgbeq, sharpness, contrast and brightness. We felt the AR was way off on the source and also the colours not dead right. We fixed what we could and it's pretty decent on both video and sound... won't be everyones cup of tea but it sure beats the cam release :P

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
