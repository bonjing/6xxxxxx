Storyline: Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) and Wally (Jason Bateman) are best friends. Being unlucky in love, Kassie has decided to have a child using artificial insemination. Wally doesnâ€™t like this idea, but he isnâ€™t capable of admitting to himself, let alone to Kassie, that heâ€™s in love with her. At Kassieâ€™s artificial insemination party, Wally gets very drunk and spies the sperm donorâ€™s sample in the bathroom. Wally was way to drunk to know what he did that night, and Kassie has moved away because she doesnâ€™t feel that New York City is a place to raise a child. Now 7 years later, Kassie has moved back with her son Sebastian. While she is looking to get Roland (the sperm donor) more involved in their lives, Wally canâ€™t help but notice the many striking similarities that he and Sebastian share.
