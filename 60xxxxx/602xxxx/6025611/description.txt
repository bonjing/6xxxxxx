HQ rare promo music video. "Evil Woman" is a song written and recorded by Electric Light Orchestra.

First released on the band's fifth album, 1975's Face the Music. Released as a single in late-1975, the song became the band's first worldwide hit. According to Jeff Lynne this song was the quickest he had ever written, in thirty minutes, originally as 'filler' for the group's Face the Music album. The song placed in the top ten on both sides of the Atlantic in early-1976. The song became a hit again in the UK in 1978 when it featured on the ELO EP. The lyric "There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in" is a tribute to The Beatles' song "Fixing a Hole".
