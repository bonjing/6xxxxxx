,kavii123,2010-12-20T05:05Z,"It'd really be great if someone can crack this. Of course thousands of us cant pay anything, but millions of thanks to whom who cracks."
,mflvnv,2010-12-20T20:01Z,"To derekboy and kavii123: 

You don't need a crack. All you need to do is copy all the files from the CD (or where ever you got them) to a folder in one of your root drives. For example most people have a C: drive in which the OS is installed. So you would create a folder here and copy all files in this directory. Mine looks like C:\Fluenz You can then place a shortcut from the .exe on your desktop and run it successfully. Hope this helps. By the way, does anyone have access to level 4 & 5 of French Fluenz? Im also looking for Italian. Thanks for any help..."
,kavii123,2010-12-21T12:50Z,"Thanks mflvnv for paying attention.

I did try what you told here and other things but still it doesn't works

-It was not being mounted with power ISO nor with magic. so I mounted image with ""DAEMON Tools"" it was mounted but when I run the program error is ""seem like you did not inserted DVD, please insert :( ""

I also copied all folder after mounting; by unhiding all of them and pasting them into a fresh folder on the location you told (2nd time-I did try with win rar as well) and paste a shortcut on desktop then it says ""seems like you are you using back up files""

it is quite strange for me that it works on your machine how did you manage.

kindly let us know if you have any other way."
,Jharoo1,2010-12-21T19:43Z,"Dear Kavii123, you need to do the following.
1) Mount the iso file
2) Copy all files including hidden files to a folder in your hard disc.
3) Download the patch at http://ifile.it/kuw4gvc
This is a rar file which contains a text file with instructions and a fluenz.exe file. 
4) Replace the original file in the folder copied in step 2
5) Run the setup file the first time and then it should work. 
6) Subsequent times run the fluenz.exe files
7) No emulator is required. All the best !!!!"
,kavii123,2010-12-22T11:51Z,"Thank a ton jharoo, for the file you provided. now it works like a charm :)

,derekboy,2010-12-25T17:52Z,"@mflvnv:

I don't have italian but the way I found this torrent was going on FilesTube and looking for them. It took a long time to download all 20-or-so parts from the file sharing websites but it got the job done."
,madbrainz,2011-01-19T22:51Z,"Jharoo1

,Kusari42,2011-01-20T02:11Z,Could someone please re-upload the patch? I would love to get this running.
,mrronald,2011-01-22T10:33Z,"Download Fluenz Spanish 2, http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5182758/Fluenz_Spanish_2

Copy the Fluenz French 1 to your harddrive (including hidden files) and then copy fluenz.exe from the spanish version into the french one, then it should work."
,banky13,2011-01-27T09:07Z,"please !!!
   can someone upload that spanish fluenz.exe file alone so that one who already downloaded this french Fluenz torrent need not required to download the whole spanish fluenz torrent and that is  just only for getting fluenz.exe .and patch it into the French Fluenz in order to work it as suggested by mrronald."
,James.D,2011-02-02T08:39Z,will anyone seed?
,James.D,2011-02-04T09:11Z,"it doesn't need a crack, just open the iso on a virtual drive ie demon tools and open from disk don't install"
