Longford and Mahajan are astonished by the discovery of the skeletal remains of two bodies in an underground fallout shelter. They discover that the two are Detroit's answer to Romeo and Juliet, a young Caucasian woman and an African American man who had been missing since 1967. However Longford realizes that to find the murderer, he'll have to confront the ugly prejudices of the '60s that still permeate the city. In a surprising revelation, his long estranged father, a former cop, offers him a piece of crucial information. Meanwhile, Fitch, Washington, Stone and Sanchez investigate the brutal murder in Mexicantown of a young Latina, an undocumented immigrant who had few places to turn when she became pregnant.
