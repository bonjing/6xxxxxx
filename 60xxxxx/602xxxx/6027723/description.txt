It's no exaggeration to say that he's the most exciting name in clubland right now, with a Grammy nomination, a Juno award for Dance Recording of the Year for his CD collection For Lack of a Better Name, a performance at the 2010 Winter Olympics and MTV booked him as the house act for their 2010 Video Music Awards. Over the last years he's released a string of club and radio friendly chart-toppers, and this album promises to produce an equal plethora of hits.
