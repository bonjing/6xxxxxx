,zelious7,2010-12-17T03:38Z,"When doing the access control list repair and the registry reset, does the subinac.msi need to be installed to a particular directory?  I was trying to follow your directions step by step since i removed your cs4 versions and I'm getting install errors for your cs5 versions.  I assume I have a reg issue.  When doing the access control list repair as your steps say, they say to have subinac installed which i did, then run reset.cmd, although it finishes i don't think its working for me properly. All of the cmd lines when i run reset.cmd say   ""  'subinacl' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.""

,zelious7,2010-12-18T20:27Z,i got it figured out thanks though none of your fixes worked><  i ended up having to go to the payloads and install the microsft.msi files one at a time and find the permission error in regedit for a few of them.  some how cs4 uninstall to install cs5 messed them up.  anyhow after fixing owner ship on the bugged out permissions with microsoft.msi files i was able to install them.

,brynnie,2010-12-30T18:25Z,"Sooo... i hope this comment doesn't make it in the ""dumbest comments ever in TPB""... but here goes...

Mr TheThingy... i have already had a torrent ""crush"" on you from a few months back when I was able to snag a MUCH needed CS5 from you (which,by the way, enabled me to start working for this guy at home doing his graphics stuff... meant a lot cuz i was recently let go from a job i LOVED because of this schtupid economy. Got me back to work and able to pay the mortgage, keep the lights on, feed my kid... and yeah - YOU are to be thanked for that. Couldn't afford 1/4 of what freakin' Adobe asks for CS5, the bastids...anyhoo - I digress...)

So since then I've had a lil' ol' place in mah heart for you because of the share and the FANTASTIC 'how to' instrux you included. I was/am new to this whole torrent thing, but totally nailed the install thanks to you.

Fastforward to today...

So a few days ago, my dumb ass downloaded some funky .tga viewer from cnet that was supposed to help me quickly view .tga files... All it did was trip up my hosts file or license thing or w/e... i dunno'... but it threw me back into ""trial"" mode... I was like panicking cuz i have all this work to do and of course I ignored the 'you have xx days left' message until the last two day remained. I dnld'd your cs5 fix and all is well with the world once again. Plus I watched the vid you did explaining Hosts files and kinda' started the crush thing all over again. Your voice is SUPAH sexah. So yeah... I've had a couple drinks today cuz it's NEW YEAR'S FREAKIN' EVE... but still... this blathering on is totally heartfelt. Wanted you to know you really made an important impact in my living and financial situation. 2010 turned out WAY better than it would have if I hand't had your help. Here's hoping your 2011 is everything you hope for and way more.

,DiFrek,2011-01-14T11:44Z,"I think I made a bit of a mess, if someone could help me out, it'd be much appreciated.

I had the CS5 Master Collection installed and working alright for a while now, but somehow my hosts file must have gotten altered, as all of sudden the apps asked for a new serial. I tried to fix the issue using the steps included in this torrent and went as far as a clean install, as the steps before it weren't successful.

I made sure the hosts file is correct. The install refused any serial I gave it, thus I installed as trial. I replaced the dll files and started up Premiere. It works, however it seems to remain in 'trial mode'. How can I force it to unlock the extra presets? The deactivate option is grayed out in the help menu, so I can't try a new serial."

3 Press OK.
4 Delete c:\program files (x86)\adobe

6 This time you'll get registration information.
Accept, and Director crashes :)

DEP may be closing the toolkit. Add the program to the DEP exclusion list, or just turn DEP off completely and save yourself a lot of trouble in the future. 
Start Menu>R-click Computer>Click Properties>Advanced System Settings>Setting under Performance>Data Execution Prevention tab. The first option should be checked, but if you still have problems, select the second option, and add the program to the list. If it does not help, then the problem is related to something else. "

The dynamic link between premiere and after effects does not work when the DLLs you provided, replace the original ones. 

i've always had this same problem with other torrents and i can never figure it out. it simply says that i need adobe production premium to use dynamic link.

------------------------------------------------
While I agree that REVO uninstaller may be the best uninstaller on the software market, be assured that REVO uninstaller DOES NOT always remove all traces of the application, either in the installation directory or the registry. It may... but it can miss when apps get sneaky or the installation is not correctly done.    

REVO trace will remember and remove all the registry entries placed there during a ""Traced"" install but an application can add to the registry when it first runs after installation. REVO doesn't catch these entries or remove them during uninstall. Thus code remains that can compromise additional installs.

The best tool against this is ERUNT, (Emergency Recovery Utility NT) a free registry backup and restore by Lars Hederer.  You can get it here: http://www.larshederer.homepage.t-online.de/erunt/ 

ERUNT is amazingly fast, taking only two seconds on my 32 bit machine!  Thus you can use it in the background to copy the registry without disturbance to whatever is running. 

I have ERUNT setup to copy the registry multiple times. It runs at every boot, and I have it automated to run daily at 6PM, and before REVO. Additionally, I have an ERUNT icon on the desktop so it can be run before any install.   

ERUNT copies ALL registry entries .  Others only get ""most"" registry entries. I have it configured to save with a filename that provides the date and time (including the second) and a reference to what triggered it. (automated or manual) to assist in restoration. This is easily done using suggestions on Lars web page.  (read EVERYTHING CAREFULLY!)  

I have been using ERUNT on my triple booter (Linux, XP, 7) for the last six years without failure or error.  Highly recommended! "
