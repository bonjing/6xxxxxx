Thousands of delegates from around the world have been meeting at the plush Moon Palace Hotel, which has been surrounding by a tightly controlled security cordon. More than 20 miles away, in downtown CancÃºn, thousands of peasant farmers, indigenous people and social movements from across the globe have gathered at an alternative summit organized by Via Campesina.

- Whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg: Julian Assange is Not a Terrorist

WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will remain in a London prison until a British court takes up a Swedish request for extradition for questioning on sexual crime allegations. An international group of former intelligence officers and ex-government officials have released a statement in support of Assange. We speak to one of the signatories, Daniel Ellsberg, the famous whistleblower who leaked the Pentagon Papers about the Vietnam War in 1971. "If I released the Pentagon Papers today, I would be called a terrorist," Ellsberg says. "Bradley Manning and Julian Assange are no more terrorists than I am, and I am not."
