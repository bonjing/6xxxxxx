 3-1 Bravo is attached to 21st company U.S. Marines on a series of raids to flush out drug trafficking operations in Dand district soth of Kandahar. It's a far cry from the hearts and minds missions of the past, and Corporal Manson has an idea for an outreach program that might serve to engage Afghan youth: equip them with video cameras so that they can document their own lives in an unmediated way. When one of the young videographers is wounded, Manson discovers that what he has recorded puts all of their lives at risk.
