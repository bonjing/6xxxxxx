I AM SO HAPPY FOR THIS... was searching for a decent torrent...yipieeee :)

there was a good 1080p source but i needed 720p for my collection & this one has commentary too

wowww.. thanks :)"
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T11:02Z,Already got a copy of this. Didn't think you were like BOZX.
,abhikrit,2010-12-09T11:26Z,now searching for a different copy of THE TOWN (extended)
[V],aoloffline,2010-12-09T11:51Z,"   Johnny the ipocrite ...YOu renamed your hddvd bourne trilogy to bluray( i did not think you ware so low) :-) I guess you will foul a few with that ...
   I knew you ware a egoistical,hungry for fame(never understood why.we are on internet..are u so obscure in your real life?..) prick,but you also care for torrents like i do,so it was ok
   You should be glad that i uploaded the best copy available for this trilogy,but instead you act like a baby becouse it was not uplaoded by you...Do u want me to give u the torrent file so u reupload it under your account ,so everybody will say how great you are..? 
   I'm waiting for your - signature 
  And btw i told u i will quit uploading soon ,i really meant it,you should relax.."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T13:09Z,"I always supported you, because you're a good uploader. I also thought you were a decent bloke but you've proved me wrong. It's not about the uploader - it's about the contents, and you know perfectly well that duping is counter-productive. BLURAY and HDDVD are equal in quality. I have renamed the HDDVD torrent so that people like you (who are evidently unaware of this fact) are not put off it.

I have never been egotistical or claimed to be great, buddy. You're a kid."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T13:12Z,@abhikrit. The Town is here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6010289/The.Town.EXTENDED.720p.Bluray.x264-CBGB
[V],BOZX,2010-12-09T13:54Z,"ok jonny we accept u r 65 yr old young man, so with that respect we r kids....... we bow b4r u in Chinese Style..... :p
And the best part u r always right !!!!!!!!!!!!!! ........
jonny  : ""Never Back Down"" "
[V],aoloffline,2010-12-09T14:34Z,"You ware ok with it reuplaoding so many of your torrents ,similar or different encodes (into the wild,juno i think,volver..becouse i refresed the peers by reuplaoding + that they had DHT enabled)..
   That's why i uploaded them ,cos i saw they ware from your accounts and not loder's and knew you deleted yours,so the torrents got a second chance...
   But this is too big for ur ego...Too bad,u started it calling me names,you could had PM' me,we'we could had found a solution..
  Bluray may be similar to hddvd,but saying that this encode is similar to TLF is wrong.Don't the best movies deserve the best copies on TPB!!.. With you the answer is NO unless they are uploaded by johnny/GoodFilms"
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T14:36Z,"No one is always right, but I'm right about you, Bonny. If you can find something to dispute, then be straight instead of your childish ""u r always right"" crap."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T14:38Z,"aoloffline, you are wrong about and I think you know it. It's good to replace dead torrents. But not healthy ones, and certainly not when they're so big."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-09T14:40Z,*about me. I have never made it about me.
,abhikrit,2010-12-09T14:50Z,"@ jonny.. yeah i do know about CBGB release...just searching anything other than it...


and @ all of you people...just stop fighting guys... each of you are great uploaders...you guys have uploaded most of the finest HD torrents...& people like me who have a huge collection of movies will always cherish your uploads, aol is a great uploader, & jonny you have provided us with tons of great bluray movies...& BOZX.. you too are amazing, your uploads equally amazing,the new bluray or the all time amazing movies,all of you guys have provided us with everything,stop fighting buddies..

[V],BOZX,2010-12-09T16:08Z,@abhikrit : are bhai yeh toh hota hi rehta hai.... en logon me thoda confusion hai... sab clear ho jayega....
,abhikrit,2010-12-10T03:47Z,"@ bozx...

arey bhai i didn know ki Indian ho..wah wah :)"
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-10T06:19Z,"if it wasn't for drama the internet would be a far less interesting place.  aoloffline you can't leave, i got too much to do to do your job too."
[V],BOZX,2010-12-10T09:04Z,"@abhikrit : nice :p....

****about me. I have never made it about me.

LOL.....
"
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-10T11:07Z,"BOZX. It's not funny... it's true. Just because you have a serious ego problem, doesn't mean we all do."
,digs5446,2010-12-10T13:53Z,this is BRILLIANT.  DTS and commentary tracks.  thanks for going with a decent file size to ensure a good video bit rate.
[V],BOZX,2010-12-10T14:06Z,joni i wl gv u ***** (5 Star Rating) for being not funny at all............
[V],BOZX,2010-12-10T14:08Z,"y can't u just chill.....  like Rihanna........ 
now u say every one has ego problemo.... 
what do u have on offer.... Un-Ego....
:p"
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-10T14:45Z,"The only person with an ego problem is you, bozx. Sticking your name on the filenames like you have something to do with it. And this was between me and aoloffline, so why don't you mind your own business."
[V],BOZX,2010-12-10T16:19Z,"like sticking my name u don't like then what cn i do... its ur problem not mine.... u think is egoistic i let u think that way... bcoz ur mind is filled wid trash  which were in WALL-E......

Gro up buddy... 

Dhondu beta just CHILL...."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-10T16:37Z,"Grow up, bozx."
[V],BOZX,2010-12-10T20:24Z,"i am a kid and stil growin every day....

:p"
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-10T23:40Z,Nah but I wasn't doing this shit when I was a kid.
,abhikrit,2010-12-11T07:58Z,ah...you guys should stop now..
[V],BOZX,2010-12-11T11:12Z,since i am far more intelligent as a kid than what u were at the same age like me......  u learned later ... i learn faster....
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T13:23Z,"If you were intelligent, you'd know how to keep your torrents alive, like the rest of us do. That involves deleting the ones that are past their USE-BY DATE http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5586820/Back_To_The_Future_Trilogy_1080p_HDTV_x264-BOZX"
[V],BOZX,2010-12-11T16:58Z,now i am intelegent na.... :p
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T17:08Z,"You will never be remotely intelligent, bozx. You can't even construct a coherent sentence."
[V],BOZX,2010-12-11T20:30Z,"thats bcz i am a kid now... how can u expect that much of intelegence now....
gro up bddy..... think smart..."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T23:55Z,You either have it or you don't ;)
[V],BOZX,2010-12-12T05:18Z,so u think i don't have it... let it be ur way... ur thinking doesn't make any difference....
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-12T12:42Z,"You've shown the world, buddyboy :/"
[V],BOZX,2010-12-12T20:33Z,u see only a part of world.... and there is noting to seennn my DEER
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-17T02:02Z,You really make no sense whatsoever. 
,PlummaJoe,2010-12-25T16:56Z,"After all that time downloading, videos starts and stops after a couple seconds on VLC player, why? Not my computer or anything, tried downloading MPC + the stuff in the NFO still no good..."
,PlummaJoe,2010-12-25T17:05Z,"Correction! Only the first one doesn't play at all, the other 2nd seem to work great and look awesome, thanks uploader.
But anyone have any ideas on why the first one wouldn't work?"
[V],-jonny-,2011-01-07T12:49Z,Download CCCP
,garybracket,2011-10-17T06:29Z,"I like K-Lite's ultimate pack versus their Lite pack and I'm not much of a fan of CCCP. When I have problems, I just use K-Lite's full featured pack."
