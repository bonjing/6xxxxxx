Juxtapoz magazine presents a gallery of underground artists who 
influence much of the fashion, graphics, and new art we see today, 
and its readers are the tastemakers who discern the newest cultural 
trends. Full color layouts presenting painters, street artists, 
sculptors, cartoonists, and photographers are featured along with 
interviews, rare portfolios, sketches, and reviews. Juxtapoz is the 
brainchild of Robert Williams, world renowned artist and father of 
the widely popular school of cartoon surrealism. Target audience 
is teens to hip adults.
