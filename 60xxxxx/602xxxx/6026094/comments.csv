Has screener watermark ""Property of Lionsgate. For Awards Consideration Only"" that pop's up now and again but this does not spoil the movie in anyway...
Good copy and an Excellent movie...

,spydrz,2010-12-20T23:44Z,is this on an r5 multifile ... i have no idea how to burn those
,MoviesR101,2011-01-03T09:16Z,"@ spydrz - It is an Rar File! 1st you will need to use Winrar or Winzip to Unrar these files (or unpack them). Once you have unpack both files CD1 and CD2, you can use a File Joiner to combine the 2 files. Now you can use convertoDvd and the burn to Dvd...Enjoy!"
