Designed for direct playback on Apple TV, iPad, iPhone & iPod Touch 4th gen, PS3, WDTV, Xbox360, Popcorn Hour, VLC.

WDTV Live user update to at least 1.01.24 firmware.

Apple TV 1st gen user update to 3.0.2 firmware. Use custom iTunes movie sync option "Automatically include the 10 most recent movies along with selected movies."

Apple TV 2nd gen user do not set preferences to auto play subtitles.  Seems to be overlay issues in firmware.  Select subtitle by holding down main selector button after video has begun playing.  If you receive Dolby Digital sound via TOSLINK then set Dolby Digital mode to ON setting.

If you have updated your Apple TV v2 to firmware 4.1 and videos take an exceedingly long time to begin playing then there was an update problem.  Restore your Apple TV v2 on a computer using a micro usb cable.  If normal restore doesn't work then use a DFU restore.  Use PwnageTool to assist in placing unit into DFU mode if necessary.
