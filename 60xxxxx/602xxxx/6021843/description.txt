One block buster story that follows a tug of war between two underworld gangs trying to outsmart each other. Chinnaâ€™s (Prakash Raj) gangâ€”the smaller of the twoâ€”, struggles to overtake Periyavarâ€™s (Raghuvaran) gang, until a man named Sekar (Vikram) gives Chinnaâ€™s gang new life. Sekar is a man of steel, physically and mentally, who had idolised Chinna in his childhood; he is similar to the character Bhima from the ancient Hindu epic Mahabharata. Sekar challenges Periyavarâ€™s group and puts Chinna on top.
