Den skjÃ¸re aristokraten Maud Lilly og tjenestepiken Sue- to kvinner fra to vidt forskjellige verdener- mÃ¸tes under mystiske omstendigheter. Det viser seg at disse to har betydelig mer til felles enn bare lengselen etter et annet liv. De fargerike miljÃ¸ene skifter fra de fine stuer til Londons mÃ¸rke smug, i denne utrykksfulle BBC- filmatiseringen. Den prisbelÃ¸nte miniserien bygger pÃ¥ den verdensberÃ¸mte forfatteren Sarah Waters elskelige roman om svik og forbudt lidenskap i det viktorianske London. 


In the dark and twisting alleyways of Dickensian London
the story of two very different young women collide with
terrifying consequences...

Twenty year old petty thief, Sue Trinder, is part of an elaborate
scam to defraud a wealthy heiress, Maud Lilley, of her inheritance.
Encouraged by Mrs. Sucksby who has looked after her since she was
orphaned, Sue assists conman Richard Rivers in his bid to elope with
Maude before having her committed to a madhouse and claiming
her fortune for himself.

But Sue's plans are turned upside down when she falls in love
with Maud...and the tale twists further as the two young women
are seperated just as they begin to realise the strength of
their passion for each other...
