	NOVA traces the development of Hitler's V-2 rocket through rare footage obtained from the National Archives -â€” some never broadcast before on television.

	(Taken from the back cover:) If HITLER'S SECRET WEAPON, the V-2 rocket, had been ready six months earlier, would the Normandy Invasion have taken place? This NOVA special investigates this question and looks at the dozen years from 1933-1945, the time that Germany took an "idea" and transformed it into a huge and intricate supersonic missile. The V-2 rocket went from "futuristic fantasy" to "military reality" becoming the most advanced and devastating weapon of its time. HITLER'S SECRET WEAPON features rare test-shot footage, exclusive interviews with the fathers of modern rocketry, Werner Von Braun and General Walter Dornberger, and displays the awesome destructive power of the V-2 after its assaults on London and Antwerp. Produced by Francis Gladstone and Patrick Griffin. Written by Francis Gladstone. Original music by Tom Phillips.

	I can't find this one anywhere for downloading, so here's my original NOVA VHS, first broadcast in 1977. This is a good quality video copy and quite watchable. Please enjoy.  ;-)  This is an MPG4 H264 ACC NTSC format file - good quality and smaller file size, hopefully for quick downloading.
