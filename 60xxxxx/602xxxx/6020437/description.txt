Deleted Scenes (1:07:51)
Like the material in the Extended Cut, none of these deleted scenes will alter your perception of the film, but there's some fun stuff for fans, including Sully taking a vision quest-type hallucinogenic drug trip. The footage is presented in various levels of completion, from raw motion capture and rough animatics to sequences that are only missing green-screen elements. Once again, the runtime is roughly 68 minutes, but only 45 minutes is new. The rest is there to give context to the individual scenes:

    * Scene 19 - "Stingbat Attack"
    * Scene 20 - "Pandora Rules"
    * Scene 21 - "Jake Meets Norm"
    * Scene 26 - "Jake Sees Decanted Avatars"
    * Scene 30 - "Norm is a Living God"
    * Scene 35A - "Breakfast with the Scientists"
    * Scenes 36A-37 - "You're in My World Now"

Capturing Avatar (1:38:26)
Here's where things get good. Capturing Avatar is a four-part, feature-length "making of" documentary by Laurent Bouzereau that explores every facet of the production, from the germination of Cameron's first ideas for the script all the way through to the film's blockbusting release. In between, you'll see the technological challenges of having to invent an entirely new and innovative motion capture workflow, as well as sequences about the creature and sound design, the casting, the score, etc. My favorite bit was seeing Cameron walk around a bare stage with the digital "camera" that he used to see inside the CGI world, framing shots exactly how he wanted them before sending all the info off for finishing at the WETA Workshop.
