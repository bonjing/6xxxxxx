,chedderz66,2010-12-08T08:47Z,"This has got to be the slowest torrent I've ever tried to download. Everyone Im connected to is like stuck at around 7 to 10 percent and crawling at a snails pace...and yes, my Utorrent is set up and posts open.  thanks anyway for the upload"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-08T09:10Z,"@chedderz
Keep patience...my upload speed averages only 35kbps..so it will take time...try downloading it tomorrow there will be enough seeds..."

[V],prashant22,2010-12-08T10:48Z,"@DSIN
welcome anyways...:-P
if ur nt downloading this u will miss something.."
,akajaykarthik,2010-12-08T11:47Z,"hey! ur uploads r cool man..bt al r in MPEG-4 formats..why dnt u try MKV..?
jus askin...ny reason 4 tat..?"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-08T12:10Z,"@akajaykarthik
If u r in a illusion that mkv is better than mp4 then let me tell u its nt..they both give same quality..
mp4 is compatible with dvd players. ps3, xbox360...so u can watch these mp4 files nt only on ur pc bt also can play them on ur tv through those devices...
mkv cannot do that.."
[T],MitZep,2010-12-08T12:46Z,"wats with fight over mp4 and mkv both formats are gud and besides yu dnt need to encode from mkv to mp4 or vice versa yu can just mux them top get same filesize and same qaulity in under a minute so wats the prob...
prefer whichever format yu want... its your wish.... "
[V],prashant22,2010-12-08T13:56Z,"@MitZep
no dude its nt a fight..some people dont know the difference so i hv no problem explaining the difference.."
,akindayimcan,2010-12-08T14:20Z,"thanks bro for avatar extras...it is a good bonus for us...

about mp4 or mkv i prefer mp4 and goku 61 together...small size good quality and mkv didnt work on my bravia...so i am happy with your torrents so much :)=...

dude what will you upload next..."
,DSIN,2010-12-08T14:40Z,"Well both mkv & mp4 have their advantages..
mkv can store multiple audio/video/subtitle streams.. mp4 is compatible with most of dvdplayers/tv/etc
no difference in audio/video quality :D

@prashant :seriously, for me this movie is nuthin but FLASHY crap.. & watchin how they made such a plotless crappy movie... yeah thats sure missing something :)"
,prank0007,2010-12-08T14:45Z,"i used 2 search goku on tpb everytime(habit of mine) n since morng didnt seen this page.it has only g for goku.finally got it on click of ur name.just can't patience.thnks buddy epic coll. dude.
