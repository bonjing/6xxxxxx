[T],trialNerror,2010-12-11T08:57Z,"Was anyone else having trouble getting on TPB an hour to almost three hours ago?

Would have had this posted sooner, but it seemed the bay was down for a bit.

Does anybody else know about the ICE and COCIA ordeal that's been raising a ruckus in the torrent world lately?"
,gacgirl,2010-12-11T09:13Z,Thanks so much for this!!! No more waiting 2-3 days for Ghost Adventures!
,Nickyboy7,2010-12-11T15:23Z,"Pirate Bay is chugging like mad for me today. Taking forever to load a few pages. 

Thank you for this new episode. You always deliver the goods no matter if it's Ghost Adventures, Ghost Lab, Ghost Hunters or Destination Truth. You are awesome and I want to marry you.

Sadly we only have one more episode of Ghost Adventures to go for Season 4. I thought it got off to a bit of a bad start but it's picked up nicely. Last weeks episode with the ghostly arm was one of the best shows they've done. I'm hoping Destination Truth returns early next year. We are due another 7 or so episodes for Season 4 as we've only had 8 this year, then it stopped. Season 3 had 15 episodes.

All the best dude. Keep up the great work. Much appreciated. We would be lost here without you uploading all these great shows."

Many series on SyFy have a mid-season break and Destination Truth returns to finish season 4 in March 2011.   

Gagh, that sounds so far away, doesn't it!?

Thanks everyone! "
,ToneZone,2010-12-12T02:25Z,"Yeah, TPB was not working for me earlier as well.
No idea about the ICE and COCIA ordeal.

Thanks for the up!"
[T],trialNerror,2010-12-13T02:49Z,"ICE, COICA*, MAFIAA, ICANN... There's more organizations than ever trying to shut down all torrent sites and any other site suspect of sharing copyright material.

It may not be internationally, but is surely a serious concern in the USA.  Blacklists and controlled internet is what the government wants.  There are bills currently trying to be passed which will allow the government to have that power.

I personally don't plan on being on TPB after the end of this year solely because it's too high-risk.   So you might have to get GHI and DT from tNe over at KAT or LT.  xD"
,DeBo21,2011-01-05T17:52Z,Thanks for the uploads trail. Im trying to catch up on all the sick ghost shows. im all caught up on the destination truth I just wish it wouldnt take so damn long to download for me. anyways why is it i cant read all ppl's comments? i get so far to the right and then it cuts off so i miss a nice chunk so when you said somthing about destination truth and when its coming back i couldnt read it all. lameness. anyways thanks a lot.
