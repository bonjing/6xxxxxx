Yes, this version has some mistakes but most importantly... On track 7, ""Skating"", this new remaster has finally included the bass solo at the end; about 10 seconds! You see, the original version fades during the bass solo at the end and I always thought that was a pity. This version is way better. At least for that particular track."
