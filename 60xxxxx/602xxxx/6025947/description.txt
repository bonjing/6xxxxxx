just a little something i thought i'd upload for christmas. used to watch this when i was a kid so there's probably more people out there that haven't seen it in a while. it's ripped from my old vhs copy so apologies for the quality. hope you enjoy. merry christmas, bah! humbug!

running time: approx 50mins.
