Anyone Captain Sim 707?"

,Jimstalk,2010-12-11T08:27Z,yesterday i bought the b-52 driver from captainsim.The aircraft is amazing. if someone thinks that he can crack it then i'm going to upload ONLY the installer

ThatÂ´s great but here in the Swedish shop we are all waiting for the Captain Sim 707:)

Is it difficult to crack the B-52?"
,Jimstalk,2010-12-11T11:54Z,I HAVE NO IDEA DUDE
,rapterman,2010-12-11T12:01Z,you tight fucker Jimstalk why bother putting it on here then 
,aarque,2010-12-11T15:12Z,"Ya Jim, I'm not sure where the disconnect is. If this plane is anything like the other CS products, the installer does not complete the installation without the ACM verifying the password from an online database, then downloading the remaining files. There is no real way to ""crack"" a remote computer to get it to download the files or give up a password, even a Greek pilot should be able to comprehend this. Why wouldn't you want to upload the rip? And if not, why even mention it at all?

A380-800, thanks for the share, you are very generous. I'm sure most of us didn't even expect this treat."

Use your brain asshole.How are you going to fly with the b52 without installing and are you going to install it when the program asks for online authentication??I need someone i can trust in order to give him the order number and the installer and this person wont be you shithead!!!"

,Kcirtap13,2012-05-08T22:45Z,The only thing i see when i want to fly it is the person sitting in it? Does anyone know what to do?
