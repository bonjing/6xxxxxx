A young man from Germany (Klaus Grunberg) leaves home and travels to Paris. Hooking up with a group of hippies, he is enamored by an American girl (Mimsy Farmer) he meets at a party. The two leave for an island off the coast of Spain and become lovers. He becomes aware she is a heroin user and warns her about the drawbacks of narcotics. The American girl allows him to sleep with her girlfriend and try heroin. After an LSD trip, the girl leaves him and he takes too much of the hallucinogenic drug. Pink Floyd provides the music for this film that decries the excesses of the counterculture.
