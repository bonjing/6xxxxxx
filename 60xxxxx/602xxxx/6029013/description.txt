Ashampoo Burning Studio 10 is a major update that improves almost every aspect of the program, adding many new features and capabilities in every part of the program. It also introduces a new Movie Editor for editing and combining your videos before burning them to DVD. The Movie Editor has functions for cutting, transitions, fades, subtitles, titles and more, plus a point-and-click DVD menu editor with animated themes for creating great-looking interfaces for your DVD movies. The new version also packed with improvements, new features and fine tuning that make all Burning StudioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s functions more powerful and even easier to use.

Anyone who has ever struggled with complicated disc burning software is always amazed when they try Ashampoo Burning Studio. This is how software should be: Instead of studying complicated manuals you just choose what you want to do and then follow the instructions displayed on the screen. For example, to make a DVD you select Create a Video DVD and the program guides you through the steps of adding clips, building menus and burning the disc. This doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mean the program has been ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdumbed downÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â: Burning Studio is a complete and powerful disc burning suite that also satisfies advanced users with all the tweaking features you expect from less accessible programs.
