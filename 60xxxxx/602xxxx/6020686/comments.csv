If the tea partiers would watch this, they would be shitting their pants in confusion and anger.

Too few people in America get to see ""the news"" without the filter of American editorial control.

Just read Time and Newseek, or watch more than one network's national news, or watch a bit of each of the 24 hour cable news channels, and see how they all report on the exact same stories, none of them report on things that the others didn't report on.  Even though there are thousands of news stories each day.  They all report on only a handful, and spin it whatever way fits their editorial viewpoint.

But the big problem is that there are stories they avoid reporting on, and how each nation's news organizations only report a limited selection of the news, and THEY ARE COORDINATED, they all report only the SAME stories."
,PhilLesh12,2010-12-08T11:08Z,"...  What I mean is, no matter if you watch Fox News Channel, or CBS Nightly News, or CNN, or MSNBC, we are all being told a NARRATIVE.

Every country has their narrative.  It supports the ruling elite and the wealthy patrons who manipulate our politics.

Tea Partiers thought that the problems were caused by a black guy who is socialist, and that the Republicans are the party that can save them.

If more people watch this show, they'll learn that it isn't a party situation, it's all about the people in control and their supporters and patrons setting up a system that basically favors the incumbent.  

And by ""incumbent"" I mean all political, social or economic incumbents.  The people who already have wealth, influence or power have solidified their positions by dividing populations and making everyone else fight among themselves.  That keeps them from becoming a threat to their respective incumbencies.  

We live in a world of ""I've got mine, and I'll be damned if you get your's"" because that is a threat to their well being."
