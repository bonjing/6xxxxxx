[b]CNN - Fareed Zakaria GPS, December 5 2010: WikiLeaks | Bill Maher[/b]

This week on GPS: Just what have the 250,000 diplomatic cable from the latest WikiLeaks document dump proven? Nefarious backroom dealings? The secretive inner workings of the State Department? Or do these documents show that American diplomats might actually be good at their jobs? Fareed offers his take.

And to help make sense of WikiLeaks, the financial crisis in Europe and its effect on America, we've assembled an all-star GPS panel. Niall Ferguson of Harvard, Richard Haass of the Council On Foreign Relations and Gillian Tett of the Financial Times.

Then, 2010 was a catastrophic year. Devastating earthquakes led the list, but the year also brought an uptick in climate-related deaths -- from floods and droughts, heat and cold, . What's it all about?

Next up, someone Fareed calls "one of the sharpest observers of American politics and life-in-general out there." Bill Maher, the host of HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher" and one of this county's most prominent stand-up comedians has had Fareed on his show before. Now see what happens when the tables are turned.

And finally, a last look at when nationalism, is perhaps, out of fashion.
