A noted educator's account of some of the more stimulating and surprising branches of mathematics, this volume profiles the mathematical mind and the aims of mathematics. Five introductory chapters offer conceptual groundwork, and subsequent chapters present lucid, accessible explorations of non-Euclidean geometry, matrices, determinants, group theory, and related topics. 1955 edition.
