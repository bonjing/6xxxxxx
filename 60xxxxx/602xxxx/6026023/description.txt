Complete Clapton is the Hall of Famer and 16-time Grammy winner's first career-spanning collection. From "Crossroads" and "Badge" to "Layla" and "I Shot The Sheriff," from "Cocaine" and "Lay Down Sally" to "Tears In Heaven" and "Change The World," the 36-selection Complete Clapton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ featuring all 13 of his solo or group Top 20 Pop hits Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the musical companion to a remarkable life.
 
To coincide with his new autobiography, Complete Clapton is a 4 LP's (2 DoLP's) career-spanning compilation for rock artist Eric Clapton, released on October 9, 2007.
 
As with The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks, each DoLP has been compiled by different record companies: Part one, virtually identical to The Cream of Clapton by Polydor, and Part two by Warner Bros. Records.
