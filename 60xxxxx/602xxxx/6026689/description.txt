	This is Disney's version of "Xmas karaoke!" What a great way to learn the words or just help get into a holiday mood. This one always brings back fond memories for me. It's out on DVD now, but this is my copy of the VHS from 1988. I think it's quite good quality for a VHSrip. Hope you have a wonderful holiday season! ;-)  This is an MPG4 H264 ACC NTSC format file - good quality and smaller file size, hopefully for quick downloading.

P.S. I put this under "music video" because I wasn't sure that any other category really fit this type of offering. :-D
