"Classy Christmas Pt. I and II"

Michael could not be happier when Toby (Paul 
Lieberstein) has to take a leave of absence and 
corporate sends Holly Flax (guest star Amy Ryan) 
to cover for him. Pam (Jenna Fischer) is forced 
to do a second Christmas party after Michael 
(Golden Globe winner Steve Carell) wants the 
party to be on the day Holly returns to 
Scranton. Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) 
regrets agreeing to a snowball fight with Dwight

Is 'I know you are but what am I" the best you
can come up with ? I guess when you know youre
wrong, its the easiest fallback.

Enjoy :)
