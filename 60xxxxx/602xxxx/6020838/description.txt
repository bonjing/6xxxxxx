"Ni Una Sola Palabra" (English: Not Even One Word) is the first official single released from Paulina Rubio's Spanish language album Ananda. It is Paulina's third American pop hit, entering at #98 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The music video was shot in Los Angeles, California on July 28, 2006 beginning at 3:00 PM and extended until 6:00 AM the next morning for a total of 15 hours. The video was produced by Todd Young and directed by Paul Boyd. The video features Paulina Rubio as super hero Pauwer-woman, whose habitat includes the skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles. During the video, Rubio rescues a young girl from a group of criminals. "Ni Una Sola Palabra" is also Rubio's first music video (since 2001's "Yo No Soy Esa Mujer") to feature her Pomeranian dog, Miranda. The music video was released on Latin music video stations on August 31, 2006.

Paulina performed the song on "The Jay Leno Show" becoming one of the few Latin artist to do so. She also performed Ni Una Sola Palabra at the 2007 Latin Billboard Awards.

The song was written by Xabier San MartÃ­n (member of the Spanish band La Oreja de Van Gogh) and was released on radio on July 24, 2006. The song was released on iTunes Store on August 15, 2006, becoming Rubio's first digital single after fans petitioned for a legal way to obtain it prior to the album hitting stores. The single was certified Triple-Platinum in Spain in Spring 2007 for more than 60,000 downloads.

Rubio said the following about the song :
â€œ 	"Ni Una Sola Palabra" is a song that captivated me from the first time I heard it, the lyrics, the rhythm... I can relate to it completely. In the process of its recording and production, it shone right from the beginning... I am very happy to be able to hand out something that I am very proud of. I love it! And I hope that people will enjoy it as much as I do.

Ni Una Sola Palabra debuted at #4 on the Hot Latin Tracks becoming Rubio's highest debut ever on the chart. The song went on to become a huge success peaking at #1 on both the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Pop Airplay charts for several weeks. It has also managed to chart at #98 on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her third song to chart there. As of December 11, 2009, "Ni Una Sola Palabra" ranked as the 59th song of the last ten years in the Top Latin Songs Chart from Latin Billboard.
