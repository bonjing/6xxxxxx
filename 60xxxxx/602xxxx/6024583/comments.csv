,p3rri,2011-01-24T01:42Z,"WARNING! This one includes a virus, TRUST ME, I even checked it 3 times! My antivirus, avira, did not alert me but my computer got very busy and I found out that when running the set-up.EXE program that besides not working and getting an error about a missing file it also spreads some infected programs around your computer and runs them in the background.

So do NOT download this torrent, there are plenty of alternatives ;)"
