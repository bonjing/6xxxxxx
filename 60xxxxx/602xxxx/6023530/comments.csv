http://www.bilderkiste.org/show/original/7129187903308/3.png

(AR 853 x 480, 853/480=1.777 which is exact 16/9, 
like 1920/1080). 854/480 would be 1,779.
The other x264 torrent uploaded on this tracker is forced-encoded to 854 x 480 probably because the encoder thought 853 is odd & wrong.
Just because we like even numbers better is nothing wrong about 853 ;-)"
