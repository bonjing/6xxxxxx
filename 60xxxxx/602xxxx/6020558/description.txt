This is a rather melancholy album with themes dwelling continually on the dissolution of the family and abandonment by the father. The songwriting is very much in a storytelling style, and although there is a slight hint of pop to the songs it's the folk and blues influences that really shine through. Although every song is replete with understated beauty, some personal favorites include the opener "I'd be broken", the more upbeat "I'll see you", "Tell me you're joking", and "I'll remember you".
