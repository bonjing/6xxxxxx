,inuse,2010-12-21T16:58Z,I can't get the audio working on any of these episodes using VLC 1.1.5 or Perian. Bummer.
,RedPlatypus,2011-01-01T02:42Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TORRENT!!!
Just as the others have stated, the audio is screwed up for every episode. All the other Simpsons torrents from Crisp are V 9 A 9 DVDrips except S10E5 ""When You Dish Upon A Star"", which also has audio issues, the rest of Season 10 is fine though. Thx for the effort. "
,krishatesworld,2011-01-21T04:54Z,"Same issue. Sucky audio. The sound is there, it's just garbled and sped up. Maybe wrong sample rate was used when encoding? All other seasons are fine that I've tried. 5, 7, 8, and 12 all seem to work so far..."
,krishatesworld,2011-01-21T21:39Z,"Okay, apparently it plays fine in DIVX Player as well as Air Video on my iPhone, but QT/Perian and VLC hate it."
,Listless88,2011-03-12T03:45Z,plus this isnt playstation 3 compatable
,Unrestrained,2011-04-02T01:48Z,"SHIT torrent, take this down it's worthless."
,bounded,2011-05-23T22:31Z,"WARNING: Useless download, audio is screwed."
,trongable,2011-07-18T01:38Z,Audio works perfectly fine with Windows Media Player. Does not work in VLC.
,Leo247,2011-08-09T04:09Z,Sounds work OK with Windows Media Player and JetAudio.
,rofldinho,2011-09-10T03:24Z,"Low quality rip. Also quite a few of the episodes jump about and have parts of them missing (so like it'll go from the middle of one scene to the middle of the next, as though 3-4 minutes were edited out). This isn't just audio out of sync (I don't have that problem), it's that entire sections were cut out. I re-checked the download and that seems fine, so I think this is a problem with the rip for this series (other seasons from TPB seem fine)."
,barber89,2011-11-03T06:11Z,thanks for the comments! helps alot wont downlaod! why are there 22 SEEDERS?!
