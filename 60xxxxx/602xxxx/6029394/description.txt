Summary:
In the age-old battle between cats and dogs, one crazed feline has taken 
things a paw too far. Kitty Galore, formerly an agent for cat spy organization 
MEOWS, has gone rogue and hatched a diabolical plan to not only bring her 
canine enemies to heel, but take down her former kitty comrades and make the 
world her scratching post. Faced with this unprecedented threat, cats and 
dogs will be forced to join forces for the first time in history in an unlikely 
alliance to save themselves -- and their humans.
