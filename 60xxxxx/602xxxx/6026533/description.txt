"Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas"

When Abed (Danny Pudi) wakes up in stop-
motion animation, he takes it as a sign 
that he and the group must re-discover 
the meaning of Christmas. Meanwhile, Jeff 
(Joel McHale) and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) 
become growingly concerned about Abed's 
mental health and enlist the help of 
Professor Duncan (John Oliver). The group 
undergoes hypnosis to explore Abed's 
winter wonderland and soon unravel the 
truth behind Abed's madness

Enjoy :)
