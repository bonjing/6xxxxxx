Planet Hulk is a 2010 direct-to-video animated film created by Marvel Animation and released by Lionsgate Home Entertainment. It is based on the "Planet Hulk" storyline by Greg Pak  and Carlo Pagulayan.





The Hulk awakes on board a shuttle which crashes on the planet Sakaar. Imperial guards appear and attach an obedience disk to the Hulk, which instead of being controled, the Gray Hulk/Joe Fixit's mind surfaced into the Green Hulk's. From here the Hulk later wakes up on an imperial transport enroute to a colosseum, weakened after coming through the portal and imprisoned with Hiroim, Korg, Miek, Elloe Kaifi, Lavin Skee, an Android and a few hived natives.

The slaves are forced to fight for their freedom in a succession of 3 fights. Lavin Skee takes charge, making battle plans for when they reach the colloseum for which Hulk shows no interest. Their first opponents are Korg's brothers. Despite Korg's refusal to fight, the Kronans attack his team. The fight leaves Lavin Skee impaled and the natives dead before Korg decides to destroy them, and sees Hulk trying to escape. But, when he realises the leader is the Red King he tries to attack him after killing the Great Devil Corker, and ends up fighting the Emperor's lieutenant, Caiera. Red King shoots the Hulk, but doesn't kill him due to the displeasure of the crowd. The Red King secretly plans Hulk's death.

The other gladiators hold a service for Lavin Skee and form Warbound, revealing their pasts to each other. Elloe also tells Hiroim that some civilians believe the Hulk is the true "Sakaarson," a title the Red King claims. The next day a crowd outside of the arena chants the name "Sakaarson" for the Hulk, who doesn't accept the title. The other gladiators ask him to fight with them until they can win their freedom, and Hulk his own. They fight the Wildebots, and succeed.

Later, Caiera tells the Hulk her story: as a child, creatures known as "Spikes" attacked her home-town and the Red Prince (now the Red King) emerges, killing off the Spikes with his Deathâ€™s Head guards, after which Caiera pledges allegiance to the prince. She worries Hulk's popularity will turn the people away from the Red King. She encourages him to escape that night but Hulk refuses. That night the resistance comes to rescue the gladiators but the Hulk refuses to go, warning there's a trap. Elloe leaves, and the rest of Warbound are forced to listen to the resistance fighters being attacked.
