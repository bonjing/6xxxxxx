Take the files you got from:
Tron.[English.ADDON+Nothing Happens FIX].JoeKkerr

And put them inside:
Tron Evolution\Binaries\Win32Live

Then open: Patch_Tron.exe

Wait till it finishes, don't look at the bar because it will stay at 40%, just look at the percentage in the title, when it's done the percentage will disappear.

After that you will have some new folders inside Win32Live. Cut them and go back to Tron Evolution main folder, then paste and replace all.

Open the game from GridGameLauncher.exe ,, it now opens with me, but asks for activation gonna try to find a solution for that."
