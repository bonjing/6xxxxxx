,zorchtorrent,2010-12-10T02:10Z,"Well, do  you have something substantial to say? 
I'll be waiting to see your fact-filled show... OH WAIT - you don't have one. When you get to thte bottom of the bottle, tell us what you find, ok?
:)"

,Herkimer,2010-12-13T17:18Z,"Please, I'm a huge follower of Glenn Beck, and I would sure like to know why he's wrong. He seems to have every fact doc'd out the yin-yan, and nobody calls him on anything substantial. I can't believe I've been duped by this guy!
Please, put up somebody's name, or web site that refutes (refutates/Palin?) this guy. I just spent $40 on gold because of him and the finance guys he has on his show. And that I did my own homework as he suggests, too, but still, how could I have been duped?

Herk.

But zorch, you keep uploading this nut, as I've got lots of HD space I need to fill up. Many thanks"
,nextcell,2010-12-14T11:57Z,"Funny. We who watch this sort of thing, and read as much as we do, if we comment on the left in a forum or whatnot, actually have something to say.
Instead of nasty BS with no substance.
Doesn't take a smart person to even figure out why."
,NWS2000,2010-12-28T22:28Z,"ZorchTorrent, the lefty libbies on here will do all they can to discourage you from uploading... except use fact. That's because the left doesn't deal in fact, but in fancy fantasies concocted by their lord and god, George ""Soros"" Schwartz... the jew who sent Jews to their deaths.

Those who hate Beck are left-wing Dems, which itself is the party of hate, the party of the KKK, the party of segregation, the party of communism, the party of any and everything American.

Of course they'll argue otherwise - that's in the Cloward and Piven book too.

Keep uploading Zorch - please. I don't have TV here... just Internet (for now), and it's meant a lot. I do enjoying researching all Beck presents... I have yet to find his facts wrong."
,AI57489,2011-01-01T21:27Z,Thanks!
,Herkimer,2011-01-05T22:47Z,"I think some people might have missed my self-depricating humour directed towards Tronik and Geekhillbilly. 

I love Beck. I challenge any to prove him wrong. I'd love to hear to it.

Keep going Zorch! Where are January's?? I'm dying up here in Canada!

Herkimer"
