,ragman420,2010-12-10T06:56Z,Very handy tool.  I have an older version and this is actually all you need because almost everything you do with the installed part makes you restart then it finishes during the boot process. 
,ragman420,2010-12-10T06:56Z,Thanks Man-o-tor!
,ragman420,2010-12-10T07:04Z,I did find out by trial and error if your drive is encrypted you must suspend the encryption or it will fail to complete the task if anyone is using Windows BitLocker drive encryption.  Just a heads up.
