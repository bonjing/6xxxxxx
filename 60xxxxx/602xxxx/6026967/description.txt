Ahoy fellow Pirates!

This is one of two tools I searched the Internet in vain, when I started to move my personal files to another partition, to keep them safe in case of system crash, etc.!


Paragon Partition Manager 10


It's the famous partition manager: ready to boot and manage your partitions.
There is no easier way to handle your partitions, than with this fantastic tool!

This is NOT the whole program to install on your computer!!!
It is just an ISO, which you'll just have to burn to a CD in order to have a bootable full version of Paragon Partition Manager 10.
No nasty installation and figuring out how to make a bootable image â€“ it's all done and ready to use!

As I never could find one that actually worked, I made it myself and decided now to share it ;)...

Just burn the ISO and boot from CD!

seed and enjoy!
