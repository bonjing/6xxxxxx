Mormon Tabernacle Choir - Songs From America\'s Heartland

For reasons passing understanding, the OP decided to up this as a single FLAC track. I have split it into VBR 190 (ish) mp3 files. However, since some of you really love flac, I have left the original flac files as they were. Therefore, download and pick the style you like. In any event, there is some truly lovely music here.

Songs from America\'s Heartland is a feast for choral music lovers or singers. While there is some pop-schlock (\"What a Wonderful World,\" \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\"), the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also performs some classic arrangements of old American songs. John Rutter (yes, a Brit) is well represented with the opening and closing rousers \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" as well as his folk-song set, which includes the a cappella hoedown \"Sourwood Mountain,\" the gorgeous \"Black Sheep,\" and the bouncy, get-up-and-dance \"Down by the Riverside.\" Also represented are James Erb\'s luscious eight-part a cappella \"Shenandoah\" and Mack Wilberg\'s fiendishly difficult \"Cindy\" for 10-part chorus, four-hand piano, and lots of percussion. The 300 voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir perform with conviction and beauty, and Jerold Ottley conducts, accompanied by piano, organ, and full orchestra. --David Horiuchi
