Description:
Episode 6: R V LANGHORN

Unable to resist her charms, Cleaver agrees to defend an old flame - 
now a successful radio shock jock Eddie Langhorn - who's charged 
with inciting racial hatred. Meanwhile, his tax case catches up with 
him and he's placed on remand. Then he learns his father has had a 
stroke. Scarlet, acting as prosecutor on the Langhorn case, is 
stumped by Cleaver's impressive defence, but Barney comes to her 
rescue. Cleaver despairs when he realises his client has conned him 
but allows himself a glimmer of hope when Missy arrives unannounced 
once more. But she's come to tell him that she and David are getting 
married!
