,zesty1,2010-12-10T04:21Z,It starts to install but then disapears  WTF?
,brunohll,2010-12-10T10:18Z,"It seems to work.. but I don't seem to have DirectX 11 compatible hardware!! EEK!!
:P
So I can't run this benchmark until I upgrade.. 
I might not even be utilising DirectX 11's full potential on Win7x64 gaming.. 
This is worrying.. "
,daMouse,2010-12-12T16:31Z,Be sure y'all have fun with that Wikileaks backdoor now.
,DemonicBlaze,2010-12-30T05:48Z,@brunohll Use 3DMark Vantage. That might work. It didnt work for me cuz i have a widescreen and it said resolution not supported. I'll be fucking blazed if this shit doesnt either.
,Trexian66,2011-01-30T17:44Z,"Keymaker is compromised.

Trojan reported by Malawarebytes "
,gfw4lyfe,2011-01-31T08:32Z,Idiot. It's a KeyGen. Most AV programs flag them as malicious.
,kght22,2011-02-03T22:16Z,"bit torrent shit is ""watch your own ass"" software. if the damn thing will make an acceptable key it shouldn't matter if it has a trojan or keylogger in it, if your fucking with this shit you should know wtf your computer is doing anyway."
,leezaal40,2011-02-12T05:29Z,"Virus or trojan etc in keygen:
Eset smart security 4 says keygen is infected and has deleted it before rest of downloaded has even completed so i think its safe to say it IS infected"
,Rhainor,2011-02-14T21:37Z,"AVG Free flagged both the keygen and the crack as threats, BUT the description was ""BackDoor.generic13.WQV"" -- ""generic"" usually means the AV program saw a *portion* of the program that looked *SIMILAR* to known malware, but could not identify it as a specific piece of known malware -- which is quite common for keygens and cracks, and doesn't mean a damn thing."
,Smurfeaters,2011-03-09T03:13Z,"For those who don't want to run the keygen:

3D11-PRO-WY6JW-JKVWY-3QN3V-HSXZW-PLLJU"
,mgcg88,2011-03-20T03:24Z,"Just for telling:
THIS DOES NOT RUN IF YOU DONT GOT A DX11 GRAPHS CARD!"
,JMT3EBAotP,2011-03-28T08:18Z,"'daMouse' and others are telling the truth. The Keygen does not work at all, I believe that some Keygen Teams are reliable, but AVG showed a Backdoor.Generic Trojan, and the ""CORE10K.exe"" file locked up and acted much like a malicious trojan. Think people, this could be someone posing as a Keygenerator, in truth just an Identity Thief using Keyloggers on you! Food for thought!
P.S -- 'Smurfeater's' Key is Valid. Use that instead"
,Gh057man,2011-06-19T13:35Z,@zesty1 Yeah I'm having the same problem. Using XP with SP3.
,Gh057man,2011-06-19T13:43Z,Oops... should have read the comments. If this won't work with anything less than DirectX 11 then XP = fail! Looks like this will have to wait until a W7 upgrade :(
,Deadlight2,2011-07-14T18:59Z,Upgrade to 1.02 - key no longer works :(
,koocat102,2011-11-14T10:05Z,"why would you upgrade something with a false key? 

Did you fall down and smack your head against the pavement?"
,Pride808,2011-11-16T07:34Z,"Retarded people are retarded. The keygen, like most keygens, is a false positive. Which means your protection is picking it up as a threat based on it's name. Get some real protection like BitDefender and it knows wtf is a false positive. 

Thx Smurfeaters. The only one who actually helped. I am up and running... full version.  "
,Farlo113,2012-01-01T22:45Z,"I couldn't get the verification to work, whenever I disabled my internet or blocked the program in my firewall, it just says ""Online activation failed"" and tells me to try again.  Of course with the internet enabled it says that the code is wrong.  Any suggestions?"
