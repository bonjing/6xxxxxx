Could you give us an ""Install order""?"

Naturally the program, then what do you want.

Then you can create the full Boot Disk, like this:

,TheEmpathicEar,2010-12-10T16:10Z,"Ok, thx. I thought I remembered someone ""stressing"" that you had to install ""Plus Pack"" before ""Add-ons"" or vice-versa - who know??"
[V],nikita200,2010-12-10T18:45Z,Is indifferent.
,x25m,2010-12-12T05:45Z,2 questions....is the installler untouched or modified? And do I need to block the program from connecting to internet?
