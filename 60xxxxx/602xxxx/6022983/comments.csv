Burn it on a CD."
,administrador_BTGM,2010-12-13T21:05Z,Dear Monopoli_easter in my post I specified clearly that the game must be burned to a CD-R 700MB. Read the entire post you will see the specification. Hope you enjoy this exciting game!  Hugs.

First i tried to burn it with Magic ISO, and later with Alcohol 120% , but neither of it works. 
What program did you use to burn the CD?"
,administrador_BTGM,2010-12-29T17:07Z,"Shatza77,
I always use the ""UltraISO Premium Edition version 9.3.6.2750"" to burn my CDs and DVDs. You must properly configure the program!!!
In the ""Write Method"" select ""Disc-at-Once (DAO)"" and, use the lowest possible Write Speed. I always use ""Write Speed 3X to burn DVDs and 8X to burn CDs"". 
It is also important to use good media. 
I usually use ""DVD-R 4.7GB SmartBuy"" and ""CD-R 700MB SmartBuy"". These medias has worked well for me. Other media already had problems, for this reason, try not to use these different ones that I indicated. 
I'm SURE, the ISO file is perfect and Working!!!
Hopefully you will get success by following these tips. 
Hugs,
