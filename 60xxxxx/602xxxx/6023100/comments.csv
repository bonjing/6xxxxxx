The other day I tried to download the Rockets vs. Bulls, also uploaded by you, and after more than 12 hours I only had 0.6% and I had to give up. Now I started to download this 2 hours ago and now I only have 0.8% and the download speed is 0 (zero). If you can't do this then please stop. It's a waste of time. I appreciate the good intentions but unfortunately it's just not working out for you or me."
,jeanluc79,2010-12-09T11:11Z,After almost another hour I am at 1.1%.
,jeanluc79,2010-12-09T12:59Z,"After more than 4 and a half hours I am at 1,3%. That's it, I'm done! I will never attempt to download something uploaded by playdeep23."
,jeanluc79,2010-12-09T13:00Z,...but where are the other uploaders of NBA games????
,Playdeep23,2010-12-09T22:53Z,"I am really sorry for you jeanluc79 but I guess your connection is also slow, and you are probably the type of a hit and run and dont care to seed for others,well my uploads are not intended for you, I will be glad if such moaner like you will not disturb me and waste my time. Get a life dude!"
,jeanluc79,2010-12-09T23:51Z,"Actually I have a total ratio of 9.557. I guess I got there by not being the hit and run type. This particular torrent that you uploaded had a over 5 ratio when I decided that I had to remove it.
Also my connection is fine- I figured that after being able to download from anybody else except you.
If anybody has actually managed to download this please do tell!
""Get a life dude!"" Seriously?! First of all I do have a life. And second, although I did express my disappointment I believe I've done that in a polite manner. If you can't admit your failures the least you could do would be to show that you have some manners. That's just my opinion. You do as you please."
,Playdeep23,2010-12-10T02:10Z,"Why hate the world dude, you are losing your temper and manners too, so you change the meaning of polite? Well its time to leave you alone. Anyway folks Bulls vs Cavaliears coming up next;-)"
