Herein lies a set of music by Tchaikovsky. Contains the three string quartets, as well as a string sextet titled "Souvenir de Florence". This comes from a 2-disc set.


Performed by the Borodin String Quartet, with Yuri Bashmet and Natalia Gutman on the sextet.


Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
