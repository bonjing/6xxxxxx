        Looking for trouble

        Moon Blake  has just  been thrown  into an  adventure that  he
        wasn't expecting.

        Moon has lived in the  wilderness with his father for  as long
        as he can remember, surviving  on whatever they can find.  But
        Moon's  life  changes forever  when  his father  dies,  and he
        stumbles into the hands of  the law. When Moon is  turned over
        to a boys home,  he is determined to  escape in a stolen  bus,
        with his new found friends and the lovable bloodhound sent  to
        track  them.  Moon  leads the  boys  through  an action-packed
        adventure filled with chases, captures, and danger, where  his
        survival skills  might not  be enough  to keep  them one  step
        ahead of the authorities.

        Moon's journey  teaches him  firsthand what  friendship really
        means, in this wonderfully touching film starring John Goodman
        (Monsters Inc,  The Big  Lebowski), Jimmy  Bennett (Star Trek,
        Shorts, Snow Buddies), and  Clint Howard (Night At  The Museum
        2, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Austin Powers).
