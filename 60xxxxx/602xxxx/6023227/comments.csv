May I request no rars ? Firstly, Rars have a bad rap, because of all the crap torrents [containing grey ware, Viri etc..] so A lot of people jus tavoid them..and they waste time, Yours to Rar the avi and then mine to unrar it.. Rars rocked ten years ago..and are almost totally useless IMO they were t osave space and to allow downloaders t oJus tDL one rar to replace a faulty file... back in teh day it was t osave HD space..but we only had 10-20 gig drives back then..now.. I run with three terra bytes of HD space, Space is not the issue... Time is.. ..
 Just sayin :)

Thanks for The UP !"
