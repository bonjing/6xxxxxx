From Wiki:


BjÃ¶rk GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir  (born 21 November 1965), known as BjÃ¶rk (pronounced /ËˆbjÉœrk/ BYURK in English), is an Icelandic singer-songwriter, composer, actress and music producer, whose work includes seven solo albums and two original film soundtracks.

Her diverse and eclectic musical style has been influenced by many different pop and avant-garde musicians and genres,[1] including alternative rock, jazz, electronic dance music, classical, folk, ambient and trip hop. She is known for expressive vocals in a broad soprano range, as well as for her unique costumes and music videos. BjÃ¶rk has also collaborated with many other musicians, beginning in the post-punk bands Tappi TÃ­karrass, KUKL and the Sugarcubes, the latter of which brought her wide attention outside Iceland. Since the 1980s, BjÃ¶rk has sung most of her songs in the English language.

BjÃ¶rk's 1990s singles "It's Oh So Quiet", "Army of Me" and "Hyperballad" charted in the UK Top 10. Her record label, One Little Indian, reported in 2003 that she had sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.[2] Her work has been critically acclaimed.[3] She has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, one Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards. For her performance in Dancer in the Dark, BjÃ¶rk won the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.[4] She was ranked #36 on VH1's "The 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll"[5] and #8 on MTV's "22 Greatest Voices in Music."[6] In 2010 she won the Polar Music Prize. 







Greatest Hits 2002


Greatest Hits is a compilation album released in November 2002 featuring the songs of Icelandic singer BjÃ¶rk. Although not all of BjÃ¶rk's singles are included on this collection, all of the songs on Greatest Hits were released as singles. The tracks were selected by fans through a survey on BjÃ¶rk's website. Greatest Hits presents the songs in descending order of most-popular votes, with the exception of "It's In Our Hands" which was a new song and appears at the end of the compilation.

There were two online surveys preceding the release of Greatest Hits. The survey that gave the tracklist was one where fans voted for their favourite single-tracks. Another one was conducted simultaneously where fans could vote for their favourite of all her songs, albums tracks as well as B-sides. This sometimes is the cause for some confusion about the authenticity of the fan-selected tracklist concept because interestingly enough the results from the single-track survey doesn't always match with the overall survey. For example, "Hyperballad" was the song receiving most votes from BjÃ¶rk fans on the overall survey, but appears as the second track on Greatest Hits. The results of both surveys can be seen on BjÃ¶rk's website.[1]

Several of the songs are presented in their radio (or single) remixed forms, most notably "Big Time Sensuality" (the Fluke version featured in the promotional video, and not the shorter "Minimix" as featured on the single). "Possibly Maybe" includes the famous electronic sounds that were temporarily deleted off the Post version of the track, and "All Is Full of Love" is presented in its single version.

As with many greatest hits compilation albums, some of BjÃ¶rk's biggest singles were absent. The most obvious omission is "It's Oh So Quiet", her highest-charting UK hit. Also missing are "Alarm Call", "I Miss You", "Cocoon" and "Violently Happy" as well as any pre-Debut material.

The tracks "Human Behaviour", "Big Time Sensuality", and "Venus as a Boy" are taken from BjÃ¶rk's 1993 album Debut. "Play Dead" was originally released on the Young Americans movie soundtrack (1993) but was included on some editions of Debut.

"Hyperballad", "Army of Me", "Isobel", and "Possibly Maybe" are from the 1995 Post album. "All Is Full of Love", "JÃ³ga", "Bachelorette", and "Hunter" are from her 1997 Homogenic album. Finally, "Pagan Poetry" and "Hidden Place" are found on her 2001 Vespertine album.

The artwork on the CD was produced in collaboration with Icelandic contemporary artist GabrÃ­ela FridriksdÃ³ttir. It is the only one of BjÃ¶rk's album covers that includes both a logo and a title.

Greatest Hits was released on the same day as BjÃ¶rk's Family Tree box set, which contained a "greatest hits" disc on which the songs were chosen by BjÃ¶rk. Greatest Hits and the greatest hits "as chosen by BjÃ¶rk" have seven tracks in common.

The Greatest Hits album was also listed on Blender magazine's "500 CDs You Must Own".
