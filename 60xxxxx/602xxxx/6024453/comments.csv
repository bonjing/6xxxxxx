(from Pitchfork)
Original Black Flag and Circle Jerks frontman Keith Morris teams members of Burning Brides, Redd Kross, and Rocket From the Crypt for this vital blast of classic hardcore. First Four EPs crams 16 tracks into just over 17 minutes; it's packed so tightly, an extra second here or there could feel like one too many. This is lean, propulsive hardcore, played just as it would've been in L.A. circa 1981. The live-in-a-room recording lets you all but hear the sweat drip on the mic, Morris' hair slapping into Coats' amp. And the breathless intensity of Morris' vocals is matched by the one-and-done feel of the musicianship. In an indie rock landscape that typically values complex arrangements, subtlety, and good taste, OFF! are not just refreshing, but totally necessary. In an indie rock landscape that typically values complex arrangements, subtlety, and good taste, OFF! are not just refreshing, but totally necessary. It's an economic shithole out there right now-- the same conditions that led to hardcore in the first place. This music is built for a climate of frustration and powerlessness, and its bare-knuckled punch-in-the-face is a long-needed wake-up call to nostalgic escapism. Get mad instead."
