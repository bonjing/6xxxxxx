,wanna-bac,2011-08-06T09:34Z," To the int'l audience unfamiliar w/ US tv:
 TV producers (especially those of popular shows) create ""Holiday Specials"" 2 compete for times of higher viewership. Thus this ""Warehouses-13 Xmas Special,"" a ""stand-alone"" episode (of NO season, actually.)
 The reason? More viewers=higher ratings=higher prices charged a show's advertisers. (TV in the US is big busine$$.)
 Torrents omit commercials -- why a 1hr US tv show is a 43 min torrent -- the ""missing"" 17 mins is advertising. (Is all a competition for the ""almighty dollar."")"
