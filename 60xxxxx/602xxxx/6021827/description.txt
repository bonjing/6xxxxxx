Christmas Special. Enjoy.

.: Plot :.

Warehouse 13 is an American  science fiction series that premiered on July 7, 2009 on Syfy. The series follows United States Secret Service agents Myka Bering (Joanne Kelly) and Peter Lattimer (Eddie McClintock) as they are reassigned to the government's secret Warehouse 13, which houses supernatural objects. They are tasked to retrieve missing objects and investigate reports of new ones.
Executive-produced by Jack Kenny and David Simkins, the dramatic comedy from Universal Media Studios has been accused of "borrowing" much from the 1980s television series Friday the 13th: The Series. It has also been described as "part The X-Files, part Raiders of the Lost Ark and part Moonlighting."
The series premiere was Syfy's third largest debut to date, garnering 3.5 million viewers. It also has a near 50% female viewership. Since the start of the show, the first six episodes have all made the top 10 highest rated series episodes of all time on Syfy. This including episode 6, "Burnout" (August 11), which got 4.4 million viewers, setting the record for highest rated show ever on Syfy.
In August 2009, Warehouse 13 was renewed for a second season, beginning on July 6, 2010.
