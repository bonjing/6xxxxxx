    How did an insignificant cluster of Latin hill villages    
    on the edge of the civilised world become the greatest    
    empire the world has known? In the fifth programme of    
    the series, archaeologist and historian Richard Miles     
    examines the phenomenon of the Roman Republic, from its    
    fratricidal mythical beginnings, with the legend of       
    Romulus and Remus, to the all too real violence of its   
    end, dragged to destruction by war lords like Pompey      
    the Great and Julius Caesar.                               
                                                              
    Travelling to Sicily and North Africa, Richard tells     
    the story of Rome's century-long struggle for dominance   
    with the other great regional power, Carthage. It was a    
    struggle that would end with the total destruction of     
    this formidable enemy and the transformation of          
    landlubber Rome into a seapower, and the Republic into    
    an Empire. But with no-one left to beat, the only enemy    
    that Rome had left was itself.
