,gmeades,2011-09-25T02:40Z,"The secret to self-hypnosis recordings is to play them for 30 days in a row while going to sleep, and two or three times a week while sitting upright with your eyes closed.  Then you'll get the results you're looking for.  I've used a lot of them over the years, and always had good results."

From what I've heard, NLP is highly debated among the scientific community, but I've also heard what gmeades said...that you have to listen to the recordings for at least one month before you start noticing changes. And the changes are supposed to target your unconscious, hence you may not even notice they're working on your conscious mind once you've listened to them long enough. I think it's worth a try. I think there's somewhat of a difference between NLP and subliminal messages. I don't think subliminal messages hold any water."
