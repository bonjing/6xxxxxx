All You Need Is Now isnâ€™t Son of Rio, but itâ€™s the best album Duran Duran has released since then, a collection that manages what their best material always has, blending art with grand gestures and popcraft. Itâ€™s nine songs full of the promise and thrill of 1981-83. But even more than Ronson and Duran Duran have let on, itâ€™s also an album clearly in debt to the future, a sleek and sexy future where a guy in his early 50â€™s â€œdriving up the Autobahnâ€ is still the same superhero who wrestled hot chicks in a Sri Lankan swamp all those years ago. This is the sound of time stood still, of a feeling of reckless and sophisticated abandon launched decades forward without skipping a beat.
