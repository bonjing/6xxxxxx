What happens when 150 Goths, get together with 2500 norms on a seven day Caribbean cruise? You can find out by watching Goth Cruise, the modern documentary, on the Independent Film Channel.

Disregard everything you know about Goth culture. Goth Cruise is a landmark documentary that takes a candid and ultimately redefining look at what it really means to be Goth.

The film highlights a handful of the 150 goths, through interviews and short videos that take place before the cruise. Then - we get to watch them in action during the cruise.

The film is 74 minutes of gothtastic fun. We get a chance to understand how each cruiser became who they are today and what goth means to them. For some, its an attitude. For others its the music and fashion. The background music (a mix of punk and industrial) in the film is outstanding and includes Siouxee and the Banshees, The Cure, Voltaire and Rome Burns.
