K'ed, kd, k'd or in this case ""key'd"" (admitedly I've not seen it spelled that way before) is a term used in the world of Mac warez / pirated software.

It refers to software that normally requires a license key to register it, but has been cracked by someone so that it is in effect pre-registered (no longer requires registration), or will accept any registration key. The prior is more common.

So K'd is short for keyed... which is a term someone has invented to refer to software that has already had its license key system taken care of prior to you receiving it and installing it."
