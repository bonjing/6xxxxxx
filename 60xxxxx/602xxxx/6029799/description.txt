Two demoted fighter pilots battle evil as high flying masked vigilantes.
Mechanics by day, the masked Swat Kats trio are a crack force defending Megakat City from criminal masterminds and monsters. Well-crafted, meticulously-animated children's science-fiction in faithful anime style, with well-rounded characters, ongoing storylines and rakes of humour.

One of the best cartoons i watched as a kid. Just love it.
Dont think it needs much description.
