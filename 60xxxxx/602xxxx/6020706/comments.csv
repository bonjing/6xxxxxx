,Pygo,2011-07-03T06:23Z,"Your inability to enjoy something over-commercialized but still pure in essence sickens me nsofast. It should be ""against the law"" for people who obviously cannot find a single iota of joy during a pleasant holiday because it is mixed with something that was made, obviously, ONLY FOR YOU!!

Don't make some opinionated statement and make it sound like fact, either think about what  and how your typing or DON'T WATCH THE SHOW!!! "
