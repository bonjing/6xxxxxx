 Harlan.In.The.Shadow.Of.Jew.Suess.2008.DOCU.DVDRip.XviD-SPRiNTER  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327726/
 Audio: German
 Subtitles: English

 Date: 2010.12

 Director: Felix Moeller
 Plot: Though almost forgotten today, Veit Harlan was one of Nazi Germany's most notorious filmmakers. His most perfidious film was the treacherous anti-Semitic propaganda film Jud S (1940) - required viewing for all SS members. An unrepentant and blindly obsessive craftsman, no figure - save for Leni Riefenstahl - is as closely associated with the cinema of the Holocaust years. (Harlan's epic Kolberg (1945) was the basis for Inglourious Basterds (2009)'s pivotal film-within-a-film Stolz Der Nation.) This documentary is an eye-opening examination of World War II film history as well as the story of a German family from the Third Reich to the present; one that is marked by reckoning, denial and liberation.
 Genre: Documentary
