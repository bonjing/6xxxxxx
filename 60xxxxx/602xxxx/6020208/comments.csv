,BILLSAW1,2011-06-16T22:25Z,"Sorry to bother you but the ""how to install"" file is missing :(.  Could you please post it in comments?"

,xjd77,2011-08-26T00:20Z,"Used Replay VC for quite a while. Recently wanted  to capture some YouTube vids and found that when I tried to record I got perfect audio but the video started to stutter. Replay VC had always worked fine but I'm no expert as too why this problem happened so I decided to check out alternatives. Searched around and tried some other software but found that they were buggy and lacked the simplicity of use that you get with Replay VC. Eventually found a bit of software that the gamers use to record their play and then post to YouTube. The software is called Fraps and is absolutely brilliant. As easy to use as Replay VC and an ideal video capture solution for grabbing those YouTube vids that you need to have on your hard drive. This is hardcore gamer stuff - so no record button just a single hotkey to start and stop recording. Here's the link if you want to give it a try:

,nightelff,2011-09-12T03:28Z,Thankyou works great on win 7 x64
,JjEjFjF,2011-10-02T06:11Z,I get no sound
,Mr_Dizzy,2011-10-02T18:54Z,"I'm running on Windows 7 (x64) and it works great.

If you don't get sound just try each different option in  Settings/audio setup test. Also try changing the video format (to windows media 9). This worked for me.

Even though this does work, if you're downloading from common site e.g. youtube, metacafe, dailymotion etc, http://keep-tube.com/ is much more efficient."

,BiciBg,2011-11-08T15:17Z,"Sorry guys, I thought I have responded to this, apprently I havent. I can assure you that the Read me file is in the torrent and is installed at the end. Anyway for those of you who couldnt find it, I have edited torrent decription with the ""how to crack"" doc"
,BiciBg,2011-11-08T15:17Z,"ok, i cannot edit the torrent for some reason so here it is...

How to crack????

1. Relocate RVCap.exe in Crack folder to C:\Program Files\Replay Video Capture

	- Replace RVCap.exe in ""C:\Program Files\Replay Video Capture"" with the RVCap.exe in the crack folder that 	you have just downloaded

2. Enter ANY number as the Registration number when asked (for example: 1234, 333, 9012345....etc)

	- Alternatively open settings and click on ""Enter / Check Registration"" at the mid-botton of the window 	and then enter any random number"
