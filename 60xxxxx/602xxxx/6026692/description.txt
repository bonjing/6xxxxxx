"The Doctor in the Photo"

Brennan gets a glimpse into her own 
life when the body of a brilliant and 
career-driven surgeon is found in a 
rough neighborhood with multiple 
fractures in her skull and no 
indication as to how or why she was 
there. While the team investigates 
the case objectively, Brennan 
struggles to separate her own life 
from the victim's as she perceives 
many parallels between them the more 
she learns about the victim's past. 
Meanwhile, evidence found at the 
crime scene brings the team closer 
to solving the case, but it's 
Brennan's unique perspective that 
propels her to retrace the final 
events of the victim's life. With 
the reassurance of a new friend and 
Jeffersonian security guard, Micah 
Leggat (guest star Enrico 
Colantoni), Brennan makes a 
discovery about herself and learns 
a lesson about taking chances.

Enjoy :)
