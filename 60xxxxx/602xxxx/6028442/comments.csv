,niarlttep,2010-12-14T18:04Z,"Hi !

Again, I don't know what to do

     - and with ""MAGNET LINK"" : ""Magnetized transfer - torrent metadata needed""

Please ... tel me what to do 
It will be so nice...
 Thanks"
,iamaemokid,2011-03-03T05:27Z,"Thanks worked as usual.
Love the Pirate Bay.
Also for other adobe products the host blocker works for them also.
Or if you wanna just download the product, get from Adobe then follow the directions. All work.

Thanks again for the serials"
,unminute,2011-03-10T07:17Z,"hi, I followed the instructions but cannot deactivate premiere. The deactivate button is not active. I'd appreciate all help. Thanks in advance!"
,Nolan92,2011-03-20T01:25Z,"I had already had Premiere installed, but using your instruction's helped a treat. Thanks man!"
,carl-swede,2011-05-23T23:00Z,"Hi! I'm having some troubles installing this properly and was hoping that maybe someone could help me!
I've installed the program and is looking for how to launch nr. 4 in the instructions part. 

Where do I paste it? Nothing really happens when I paste it in Terminal in the programs menu. Or am I supposed to paste it somewhere else??

And where do I paste all the stuff in nr. 5?

Would really appreciate all the help I can get! Cheers! And thanks for the torrent!"

,killbush,2011-07-11T00:40Z,Thank you so much!
,geekyfun,2011-08-25T22:00Z,"same problem as said above by some, on clicking ""download this torrent"" im getting ""404-not found"" error...! help!"
,welken,2011-08-28T19:03Z,"Hello All, thanks Cyberpiraten for you effort!
...everything worked out well with me, except for 2 things:
-I'm not sure, if the flush -thing in the terminal application worked...I pasted, but as nothing happened after, I had my doubts.
- I also wasn't able to press Deactivate in the help menü, as the button wasn't active.
Is it necessary? (I didnt dare to paste the serial numbes before having pressed deactivate)
Doesn anyone have an idea?
Thank you very much and keep it up!"
,Ace_McCloud,2011-08-30T19:15Z,"Hi, I'm having the same problem as Carl-Swede.

When I paste that line it warns me about 'sudo' and asks me to input my password. I do that and nothing really happens. Would someone be able to advise me on how to get past this part.

Thank you in advance. I'd really appreciate the help, and know it must be annoying answering what may seem like dumb questions."
,Ace_McCloud,2011-08-31T01:09Z,"Problem solved. To activate the sudo command you have to have a typed password for your computer. I didn't.

Now, however, I'm stuck on the same bit as unminute and welken were. Did the flush work? And why doesn't the deactivate button show? Can anyone help with these questions?"
,Henstelfs,2011-09-02T01:27Z,Please seed! It's downloading at 10kb/s and thats for everyone!
,dmxaster797,2011-09-13T03:31Z,"Hi

This is what i tried to make it work.
First i started a new project, when here, something that tells you do upgrade (or similar) appears. 
I accepted this and when it was done, it allowed me to deactivate.
After deactivating, it quits the program, when i opened it again it gives you the choice for the trial or the serial number.
I used the third sn.

So far its working, hope this helps."
,macuff,2011-09-18T21:15Z,dos this onely work for premier or do i get all of the programs?
,rochercide,2011-10-11T11:06Z,"I have Lion on iMac and when running the first sudo on Terminal asks for a password (I assume it is the admin passwd)and then it says cannot connect to the URL... and that's so far my experience with premiere, appreciate any help or comment that can come across...
Gracias y esperanos, (I can't wait to Nov.4th :)

,triple1o,2011-10-20T12:18Z,Does HDV work for anyone? 
,MissD1989,2011-11-13T13:36Z,"I spent 7 hours downloading this and all I got in the end was a rar file secured by password and a text file with a ""magic link"" from which I suppose to download the password. Obviously it is not possible to download the password without doing another step: 

""Complete the Quick Survey to Continue

- bullshit."
,MissD1989,2011-11-13T13:37Z,Does anyone have a password for that rar file?

,gbull,2012-04-03T06:18Z,Cannot get the deactivate thing to happen for me... suggestions please?
,violet1143,2012-04-06T11:16Z,"Was it just me, or is anyone else encountering hangups on using the Titler/New Titles tool? No matter what I do that bloody tool causes premiere to hang up."
,jackajm,2012-05-03T13:48Z,It says when pasting the activation blocker in txt edit that i do not have any permission. Could someone please help.
,Genomului,2012-05-05T07:15Z,"Why is there no Adobe Premiere, the installer wants to just install 45 megabytes of NOTHING."
,goya87,2012-05-19T23:20Z,"hi i have installed the software and as i am unsure why the deactivation will not be able to click it in trial mode? can you please tell me the why and how i can activate the whole lot.

thanks"
,w3hacker,2012-06-17T05:10Z,"I followed the steps perfectly. I made it to step 4 where it then asks me for a password after pasting the ""sudo"" code in terminal. It will not let me type any letters and can't input a password, preventing me from reaching step 5. 

I tried with and without internet connection. No luck. 

Running Mac OS X 10.7.2

Help.."
