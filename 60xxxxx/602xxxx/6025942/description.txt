Here's a collection of BeOS CDs I found on torrents/emule. Most came 
without a CUE or TOC file, so they burned incorrectly as a single track 
(they actually contain 3 tracks, except PR1 and Dano). I split them in 
tracks and repackaged them.

This torrent includes:

BeOS PR1 (MacWorld Edition)
BeOS R4
BeOS R4.5
BeOS R5 (Gobe software)
BeOS R5.0.3 (Gobe software)
BeOS Exp/Dano (no TOC/CUE, since it is a single track)

Also included:

boot/
        Boot floppies and ISOs for R4 and Dano, and TOC/CUE to burn a 
        bootable Dano CD.

bigfs/
	BigFS-1.4.zip, a filesystem driver allowing you to mount the
        PPC tracks from x86 BeOS (you can get it from bebits.com too, I
        included it here for your convenience).

Also note: PR1 is PPC only (BeBox and Macintosh). Tracks contain an 
Apple partition map, they mount fine in BeOS (and Macs, I guess) but 
they won't be much useful on other systems.

And last, but not least: these CDs are probably only useful for 
historical reasons, if you actually need a recent BeOS-like OS you 
should probably use Haiku: http://haiku-os.org/
