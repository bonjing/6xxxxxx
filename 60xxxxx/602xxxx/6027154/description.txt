ISSA (Isabell Oversveen) is a 26 year old singer from Oslo, Norway.
The woman has been kicking around the music scene since she was 17, 
working with many local bands and record studios and winning much praise and support from both the Norwegian and international music industry.

Issa has put out a great album. 
The woman sings with enthusiasm and style, and will bring a smile to the 
face of even the most jaded rock fan. Musically solid, slickly produced, very radio-friendly, incredibly upbeat and positive without being vapid or sugary, "Sign Of Angels" is a winner.
