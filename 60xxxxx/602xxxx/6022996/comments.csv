,fee1818,2011-03-01T19:45Z,"one takes the time to film a movie to share with other and people are so rude about it. if there is no other option and you don't want to wait to a better file, just be thankful for someone that had take the time to post that. geez!"
,RichardHighHopes,2011-03-07T02:47Z,"Agreed fee1818, but ONLY if the uploader is not trying to deceive by pretending it's a Screener when it's in fact a f**king CAM piece of crap that only the desperate are interested in.  If desperate ppl are willing to accept CAM quality, then fine, good for them, but uploaders who upload CAMs and try to pass them off as Screeners deserve be roundly flamed.  Cantona65 and Amigotwo rightfully warned us about this crappy CAM and saved many of us from wasting our time.  Thank you guys."
