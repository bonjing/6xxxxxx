An interesting documentary I recorded on VHS almost 15 years ago about Charles Herald who was the first person ever to use radio to broadcast voice, music and entrainment. He did this 10 years before radio got its "start" in the early 1920s. The quality is pretty good for a 15yr old VHS tape. I cleaned up the audio a bit as well as the video. This is my first torrent so if something isn't working please post a comment.
