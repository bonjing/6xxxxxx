Ahoy fellow Pirates!

This is one of two tools I searched the Internet in vain, when I started to move my personal files to another partition, to keep them safe in case of system crash, etc.!


WINDOWS 7 PE


It's a clean and above all simple WINDOWS 7 rescue enviroment,
which comes with 'Total Commander' and a few other features to
handle a complete move of your Users-directory to another destination for example.

As I never could find one that actually worked, I made it myself and decided now to share it ;)...

Just burn the ISO and boot from CD!

seed and enjoy!
