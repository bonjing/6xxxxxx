,shatru,2010-12-10T17:31Z,"if anyone  have Partition Manager 11 Server, please please share it.........."
,Darkdragontc,2010-12-10T17:56Z,"It works off the USB also, just copy the files to USB drive and boot it off there, i just test it now and it works great.

You will need to extract .iso file from winrar to do this.

As for this, it works great, however it doesn't detect my lan card or wireless card. Is there anyway around this or fix it up."
,omc1977,2010-12-10T18:49Z,@dark I suppose it may be possible to run it in some type of virtual machine or is there not any type of wireless drivers as long as your Virtual machine detects your connection that is. Otherwise it might be time for drivers. Thanks for this upload.
,mEmOkIrI,2010-12-11T10:14Z,"keep it up dude

+1 added for your awesome work!"
,Darkdragontc,2010-12-11T17:06Z,"@omc1977 actually i wasn't running it on a virtual machine, anyway the wired drivers worked, i tested it out, it needs time to be worked on. Now i wonder if they anyway to add any other apps to this, just in case."
,omc1977,2010-12-11T19:18Z,@dark Thanks for the update of what you have found out. Have not had time to mess with it at all. Was thinking of installing as a primary OS on a little project I have going. I still think I will go back to a stripped version of Xp Though.
,lujara,2011-02-08T17:04Z,"Is that really Win7? Because I got a XP PE which got almost 600mb, and that should be the same small but still Win7??"
,blombardo,2011-03-03T20:02Z,Best product EVER... someone should add this link to Wikipedia under Live CD's...  took 5 min to load on an old p4 with 1gb ram - worked great.
,cokes79,2011-03-29T18:21Z,"Nice work.  One question though:

Where exactly are the PE Tools, like ImageX, DISM, etc?"
,truced_animal,2011-04-20T19:50Z,"Download was very fast. thanks for the seed.
I mounted the ISO with WinCDEmu and scanned all files with McAfee: No Virus found.
Then I run it in Virtualbox. Note: You have to use IDE (not SATA) as the controller to boot from the ISO.
Network is available after running ""PENetwork"" (link on Desktop).
Great Torrent. Thanks a lot!"
,redback38,2011-07-12T13:19Z,"its a great disk,small and quite ok for older comps,so it will boot quickly on little ram,nice work:-).if anyone would like an up to date,current version win7PE,you can get it here http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6527695/win7pe_rescue_annon_tor_Browser_apps_suite built 8/jul/2011....and its packed with truckloads of rescue/browser/utorrent/MBR/data rescue/ type stuff.works great on newer comps with good(2-4GB)ram.and all up to date versions:-)"
,pironte,2011-07-15T05:19Z,"Hi ManOtor,

I downloaded, extracted onto my External HDD, changed the BIOS to boot from USB but it doesnt boot.

have i missed out something here?"
[V],manOtor,2011-08-05T03:31Z,"@pironte:
Like it says in the description:

""Just burn the ISO and boot from CD!""
So no booting from USB :(."
,RRB123,2011-11-03T04:08Z,Hi! manOtor is it in  english? because most downloaded pe are russian version. also it contain acronis true image home as portable? for other user use xboot for boot from usb windows 7 pe. thanks for upload. i download it.
,spiderr,2011-11-21T05:10Z,This thing really was awesome to use... MiniPE wouldn't boot on this lady's laptop but this worked fine... had spybot ready to either run from the ram drive or install on the HD or install and then delete off the HD once done. The options alone were awesome. Thanks :)
,spiderr,2011-11-21T05:11Z,P.S. Yes it was English.
,avimal00,2012-05-20T22:10Z,thanks!
