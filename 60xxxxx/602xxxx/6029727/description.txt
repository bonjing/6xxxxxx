Product Description
==================
Are students learning the whole truth about Darwin's theory of evolution?

According to a growing number of scientists, the surprising answer is no. They claim that many of the most famous "Icons of Evolution" - including Darwin's "Tree of Life," finches from the Galapagos Islands, and embryos that look remarkably similar - are based on outdated research and sloppy logic. They say students are being hurt by the failure to present both sides of an emerging scientific debate over Darwin's theory.

Come explore this fascinating new conflict over evolution in the classroom - a conflict based on science, not religion. Learn about the controversy that engulfs one town when a teacher actually tries to tell students that some scientists disagree with Darwin.

From the Galapagos Islands to China, Icons of Evolution will take you on a fast-paced, fascinating journey into one of the most controversial issues in today's public arena. 


"True science and freedom of thought are inseparable, but as this video shows, some scientists prefer power to truth."
- Philip E. Johnson, author of Darwin on Trial
