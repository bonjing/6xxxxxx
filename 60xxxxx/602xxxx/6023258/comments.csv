This is the same audio as the other cams currently on the site, but it looks like this replaced the video - good part is, it is definitely clearer (when the camera is not adjusting to the movie, which does happen a lot) and certainly more detailed and less color-washed. HOWEVER, big minus is that the top.. maybe inch or so of the movie screen is missing, so it cuts off and can be very annoying and can miss certain details (for instance, the look in someone's eyes meant to convey something).

td;rl - All in all, pretty good for a cam, and if you can dealt with the cutoff, very watchable. The audio has it's ups and downs, but fairly decent for a cam. Overall rating for 6.5 of 10. "
,NodesOfRanvier,2010-12-09T09:03Z,"A: 7 - decent for cam (aka has some echo)  some parts muddle together when background noise/music.  1 part for a few sec. the audio isn't in sync (no biggie)

V: 8 - 2 problems are the auto focus issue (not horrible tho, i've seen much worse) and the top cropped off a bit but only really noticeable in maybe 2 parts

you've all seen cams.. this is better than average, i'd say go fer it if you wanna see the movie.
thx fer upload."
