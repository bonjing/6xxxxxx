John Cassavetes has been called a genius, a visionary, and the father of independent film. But such rhetoric threatens to obscure the humanism and generosity of his art. The five films included here represent his self-financed works made outside the studio system of Hollywood, on which he was afforded complete control. Populated by beatniks, hippies, businessmen, actors, housewives, strippers, club owners, gangsters, and children, the films are beautiful, emotional testaments to compassion. Cassavetes has often been called an actorâ€™s director, but this body of workâ€”even greater than the sum of its extraordinarily significant partsâ€”reveals him to be an audienceâ€™s director. The Criterion Collection is proud to present Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under the Influence, The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, and Opening Night in stunning new transfers.

SHADOWS
John Cassavetes 1959
John Cassavetesâ€™ directorial debut revolves around an interracial romance between Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), a light-skinned black woman living in New York City with her two brothers, and Tony (Anthony Ray), a white man. Shadows is a visionary work and the forerunner of the independent film movement.

FACES
John Cassavetes 1968
The disintegration of a marriage is dissected in John Cassavetesâ€™ searing Faces. Shot in high-contrast 16 mm black and white, the film follows the futile attempts of a captain of industry (John Marley) and his wife (Lynn Carlin) to escape the anguish of their empty marriage in the arms of others.

A WOMAN UNDER THE INFLUENCE
John Cassavetes 1974
John Cassavetesâ€™ devastating drama details the emotional breakdown of a suburban housewife and her familyâ€™s struggle to save her from herself. This is one of the benchmark films of American independent cinemaâ€”a heroic document from a true maverick director.

THE KILLING OF A CHINESE BOOKIE
John Cassavetes 1976
John Cassavetes engages film noir in his own inimitable style. Ben Gazzara brilliantly portrays gentlemenâ€™s club owner Cosmo Vitelli, a man dedicated to pretenses of composure and self-possession. When he runs afoul of a group of gangsters, Cosmo is forced to commit a horrible crime.

OPENING NIGHT
John Cassavetes 1976
In John Cassavetesâ€™ Opening Night, Broadway actress Myrtle Gordon (Gena Rowlands) rehearses for her latest play, about a woman unable to admit that she is aging. When she witnesses the accidental death of an adoring young fan, she begins to confront the turmoil she faces in her own life.
