At the conclusion of their sleepover, The Housewives hit the pavement with trainer Ben. See which Housewife quits the competition early, and find out what the women do that hits too close to home for Jennifer, making her mad at the group. Then, Alana confronts Gloria about her lack of participation. Will sparks fly, or will the women agree to work on their friendship? Next, Gloria shares why she believes the other women are trying to sabotage her relationship with Michelle. When Michelle confronts Gloria about being defensive, Gloria goes on the attack.

And, Dr. Phil meets with the women to discuss what they have learned about themselves so far. Who recognizes her own negative behavior, and whoâ€™s still in denial? Plus, Gloria meets a matchmaker and learns an embarrassing truth.
