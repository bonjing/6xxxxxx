...................................NFO:.................................................The.Nine.Lives.of.Marion.Barry.PDTV.XviD-MOMENTUM

Description: Although Marion Barry became internationally known for his very public downfall, the story
of his life before and after that event is less widely known. "The Nine Lives of Marion Barry" explores
Barry's improbable personal history through archival footage of him as a young activist in the '60s and
rising African-American political star in the '70s, chronicling his resurgence on the D.C. political
scene in 2004 with his most recent campaign. Directors and producers Dana Flor and Toby Oppenheimer
received unparalleled first-hand access to Barry and his ex-wife Effi (who died in 2007), as well as many
others close to Barry throughout his life.
