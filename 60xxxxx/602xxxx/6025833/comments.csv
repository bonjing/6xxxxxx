,Becos225,2010-12-09T21:31Z,Fake!!!!
,dunno76,2010-12-09T21:52Z,is it? 
,dclucky2477,2010-12-09T21:53Z,"@Becos225 how is it fake you f**kin moron?  It's an avi file and it's the correct file size.

If you actually downloaded it and it's the wrong show or episode then just say that.  Don't just assume it's fake because it's the first upload from an anonymous user."
,dunno76,2010-12-09T22:06Z,@dclucky2477 does the file work?
,azitromax,2010-12-09T22:22Z,"So, is it fake or not? "
,coorta,2010-12-09T22:23Z,"well i have managed to get the start of the episode within about 2 seconds, but noone is seeding the rest. strange "
,coorta,2010-12-09T22:25Z,"by the way, it is episode 14 of season 8. we just need the rest to be seeded to see if it is the full episode. currently their is only 1 minute and 41 seconds of video available. "
,coorta,2010-12-09T22:27Z,"hmmm, only 3 comments seem to be showing. and not one of mine is showing :s"
,dunno76,2010-12-09T22:41Z,DOES IT WORK OR NOT?? :D
,coorta,2010-12-09T22:48Z,"well, after almost 30 minutes trying to download, nothing seems to be coming through at all. still stuck at 5.7% downloaded. it could be just me, but I highly doubt it, as the first minute to 2 minutes of video I had in seconds. "
,coorta,2010-12-09T22:50Z,"@dunno76 so far, no. you only get about 1 minute and 41 seconds of video. the quality of the video is brilliant. I just wish I could get the rest. I dont doubt we would all appreciate the full file, and give the uploader top marks for the upload :)"
,mikeawesome2010,2010-12-09T22:53Z,so does anyone know if this is the real deal yet?
,GWSucks,2010-12-09T22:54Z,"@dclucky2477 what's your issue you lousy buggerman?

Someone daft like yourself wastes time downloading an obvious fake while others in the know utilize the Dupecheck Project."
,Hypn0,2010-12-09T22:59Z,its real....
,mikeawesome2010,2010-12-09T22:59Z,utorrent is showing 180+ seeders but you can only download 5.7% then it stops. and i cant seem to connect to any seeders at all
,dunno76,2010-12-09T23:07Z,My fault... i'll try again
,Hypn0,2010-12-09T23:15Z,there is a new one 
,azitromax,2010-12-09T23:18Z,"I also tried to download it, but it was too fucking slow... I'll rather wait for a trusted uploader."
,BultUlla,2010-12-09T23:24Z,"Try this one
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6026073/Hells_Kitchen_US_S08E14_WS_PDTV-LOL
I'm at 80% =)"
,UBERACE,2010-12-09T23:25Z,"stops at 5.7, dsnt wrk"
,dclucky2477,2010-12-10T00:06Z,"@becos225 allow me to apologize for my previous comment as it was obviously uncalled for.  I will certainly not be so hasty in my judgment from now on.

@gwsucks I know, I know, I got duped didn't I!?!  I will certainly take your kind advice.  My apologies to all for the rudeness.

Technically it wasn't a fake but what does it really matter, the point is it didn't work :)"
