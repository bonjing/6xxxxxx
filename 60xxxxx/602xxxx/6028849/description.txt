This Week's Show: Libertarian Year-in-Review

With 2010 coming to a close â€¦ has this been a good year for freedom?

For this week's FBN show, I ask an all-star cast of libertarians to answer that question and assess the biggest stories of the year.

Columnist Larry Elder, blogger Megan McArdle, Harvard Professor Jeffrey Miron and Cato Vice President David Boaz take on tax cuts, the debt commission, Obamacare, Donâ€™t Ask Donâ€™t Tell, and the failure of Californiaâ€™s marijuana legalization proposition. Weâ€™ll also hear from conservative columnist Ann Coulter.

Also: This yearâ€™s election restored divided government. That should make us libertarians happy, right? Itâ€™s a start, but Tucker Carlson tells me we shouldnâ€™t expect much to change.

Finally, some good news for liberty. The Supreme Court said citizens can trash politicians. And that people in cities can own guns. And Fox Business got a new libertarian TV show â€“ not just mine, but Freedom Watch with Judge Andrew Napolitano. He joins the program to tell me how liberty fared in the courts this year.

The show re-airs tomorrow at 9 p.m. & 12 midnight EST, and Sunday at 9 p.m. EST.
