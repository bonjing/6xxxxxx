Wonder why there isn't any comments... :("
[V],bubanee,2010-12-12T04:23Z,"your welcome.. :))
as for comments i've noticed that lately too.. more people tend to say something at demonoid than here.. maybe that's where everyone is going now.."
,hjhgj866,2010-12-13T15:26Z,"Thanks so much.

I don't understand why most people are downloading the crappy bitrate version, also on here?"
,Grapepop16,2010-12-14T15:53Z,"i cant find squat on demonoid most of the time.

as for comments.... half of the time, the comment box here doesn't work. people prolly got fed up with it. ... actually, im sure even now i'll have to hit the submit button 20 times for the comment to go through."
[V],Team_xRG,2010-12-15T13:58Z,"comments ... are a bit of problem...... 
thnx btw :)
and bub i think other reason is ur not always activ enow.. so maybe people dont search ur name..
but i must confess u are the best music uploader around :)"
[V],bubanee,2010-12-17T09:57Z,"Thanks Team_xRG.. your right i'm not active as much these days.. not enough time to do anything really.. but when i get the chance i tend to throw a few up in a row and then gone again.. lol   

@hjhgj866.. yep it's the same for movies as well most seeded movies are the cams and as for music it's the transcoded V2s turned into 320kbps.. yep the whole torrent world is backwards!

,561Hero,2010-12-17T18:52Z,"People want things quick. No one wants to wait around to download full quality media (I do). Also some just don't have the space (I do). I have a lot of Spanish music if anyone is looking. I am slowly making my whole media library .flac if anyone is looking for something I will help if I can. All .flac all have .cue and all are accurately ripped.

=) THANKS =)"
[V],bubanee,2010-12-19T12:12Z,"561hero.. you should join some sought of spanish forum and 'promote' your torrents that your going to upload.. :)) 
it'll pick up! "
,Jabdy69,2010-12-19T22:58Z,"Gr8 upload man.

,nikoHD,2010-12-28T04:01Z,Thanks heaps bubanee. Your uploads are always great! I'm not sure if you take requests but if you do could you consider doing a Damien Leith Discography? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Leith That would be awesome. Thanks again for the quality cd rip :-) 
[V],bubanee,2011-01-01T06:38Z,"thanks raja.. HNY to you and yours as well.. :))
