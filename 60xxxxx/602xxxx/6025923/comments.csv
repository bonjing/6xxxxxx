,Brat001,2010-12-09T22:45Z,thanks for the quality vids but why the sudden format change from vob's?
[T],SgtRlee,2010-12-10T01:33Z,"The VOB's, which i have more of, are from downloads, these are rips i did off of DVD-5 and DVD-9's i have. i tried creating VOB's but got better results with mp4's from the program i used"
,Brat001,2010-12-10T05:17Z,understandable :) i am just happy they aren't mkv! those things can be a resource and player nightmare
