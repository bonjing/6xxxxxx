,22ndWave,2011-01-11T00:13Z,"Hey man. Huge fan of what you're doing. Especially the post that included 'Academy' although one track was missing from that. One from a german compilation, 'Tell Em (If They Don't Know) ' but regardless was SO GLAD to get my hands on their stuff. Great underrated band.
There is one band however who I am having trouble tracking down their work. I know you posted 'Different World' by East Of Java but would it be possible for you to upload their complete works or at least the stuff before 'The Imp And The Angel'. I think there were 3 singles plus B-sides. Great band i'd love to hear more from and if anyone can make it happen its you. God bless, man and... 80S FOREVER!"

Thanks for all the amazing and impossible to find songs, man. 80s forever for all of us!"
