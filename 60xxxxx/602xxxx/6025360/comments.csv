,Stinkisar,2010-12-12T19:58Z,"Seems no one has done the subs yet, so what's with the seeders, seeding something u cant understand lol

Seems like a reli good movie :'("
,Philonetic,2010-12-14T22:29Z,Subs plzzzzzz.  We need more people uploading Asian cinema etc.
,john depp,2010-12-17T16:13Z,"Maybe seeders are all korean speaking users and don't require subs.  Is it that difficult to think this possibility?  If you can't think, just shut up and seed."
,Stinkisar,2011-01-15T08:42Z,Any news on the sub? still cant find one :( and i want to watch it soo bad :O

Dunno if these sync with this version. I'll let ya know when I know."
,BaiZe1,2011-03-05T15:11Z,"You can find subtitles everywhere but they are not sync with this version of the movie. I suggest to you guys to download GOM player first, it has an option where you can adjust the time speed of the subtitles :) btw the quality of the video is very good :)"
