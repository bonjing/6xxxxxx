This is a the full-length version of the fireplace video first aired in Victoria, BC Canada in 1999. It was conceived as a means to allow the TV station staff to take the week off between Christmas and New Year's Day.
Viewers warmed to the video immediately. When regular programming resumed, some fans decided to stage a mock protest. The local media covered the event. Within days, the story spread across the continent and the "Burning Log" re-kindled the TV fireplace tradition that began as a 17 second film loop on WPIX in New York City back in 1966. 
And yes - this is the one with the now famous "Arm". Hope it adds to the warmth of your holiday season!
