,TheAre1973,2011-02-11T05:14Z,Finally someone who uploaded an mp4 high quality rip of this movie. I cant stand mkv files as they are always so grainy compared to mp4. Windows people I guess like mkv. For me and many other Mac users mp4 is much better. Thanks to the uploader. Keep them coming in mp4.
