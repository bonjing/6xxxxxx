,Crunchinator,2010-12-12T09:22Z,"The game is playable, to say the least.

But for some reason, there is a certain level in World 1's Dark World that makes the game keep on crashing for me.
I don't know if anyone else has had this happen, but if it's common, hopefully another update comes out soon.

- Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit"
,telep_man,2010-12-12T10:47Z,"Crunchinator,

Why does it work on your PC and wont work on mine, thats not fair! Is it a driver thing, perhaps? What graphics card do you have?"
,Radolfz,2010-12-12T12:02Z,"yeah why does it work on other pcs?
It crashed on mine :("

,Crunchinator,2010-12-14T01:45Z,"UPDATE: Alright, so maybe my computer was having problems that same night. This game should be A-OK to download, folks.
Don't thumbs it down just because you don't know how to install games properly.

@ telep_man: I have an ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics card, with an AMD Athlon II X4 610e Processor (2.40GHz). If your computer seems anything reasonably equal to mine, you should be good to go. Just check for updates on your graphics or DirectX."
,pleomax2011,2010-12-14T19:08Z,"How do you copy your old save games. I mean the save games from Super Meat Boy v1.0u6-THETA to this version?

Or do i have to start the game from beginning?"

Not a virus. False positives.

Ask anyone else."

,telep_man,2010-12-18T18:21Z,"I used that link from ravi84m, said I was up-to-date, then I installed the latest Catalyst (10.12), still crashes."
,SiCCnD,2010-12-19T03:02Z,"is this the version that wont say ""Could not create render device""? if so, wouldnt it be easier if you just made the patch instead of having to dl the full thing again?"
,drhobo007,2010-12-19T06:21Z,I finally got it working but it can't save any progress.  I starts all over every time I open it.
,telep_man,2010-12-19T17:59Z,@drhobo007: HOW???
,drhobo007,2010-12-19T21:08Z,"I just downloaded the thing from ravi84m and ran the program as an administrator.  That's it, also my virus protector said it found one or two Trojans while installing.  That might be why it can't save my game "
,TyLeR_Co,2010-12-20T13:55Z,i run windows vista and the only thing wrong with the game is that some cinematics are a bit slow but other wise great upload

,camelx79,2010-12-22T00:15Z,"I had the same problem of crashing every third level (Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate) By running the exe in comapatibility mode for Vista sp3, i managed to get the crashes to stop, and the game now saves on exiting as well. Hope this helps!"
,Cunz,2010-12-22T01:06Z,"ty camelx79
i run the game in windows vista compatibility only, not sp3 as it does not appear here"
,drhobo007,2010-12-22T01:16Z,"Thanks @camelx79 I tried the compatibility mode and it now works and saves the games!  I didn't have service pack three Vista, instead I used service pack three for the XP."

,madhorus,2010-12-23T05:08Z,"When I run the .exe it gives me three errors in red: ""Unable to create uninstall.exe"", ""Unable to install Super Meat Boy.exe"", and some third thing. Then it tells me to reboot windows and try again. Yes, I have done so.


Any suggestions? Running on Vista 64-bit"

,ComX,2010-12-24T02:28Z,"@dibokiler

Install direct x 9 or just download the file at www.dll-files.com and put it where you have the supermeatboy.exe file. Also try google next time and you wont have to wait for someone too answer."
