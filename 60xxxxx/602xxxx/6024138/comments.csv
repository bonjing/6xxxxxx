,zdude555,2010-12-09T15:23Z,Somebody source this thing & get us a 2GB 720p rip plz :)
,mulisha05,2010-12-09T18:47Z,"Come on guys bump your upload speed up, mines set at 1mb/s. The reason torrenting sucks is because greedy people don't wanna share!"
,pizzahut123,2010-12-09T20:57Z,this is why private trackers are much better. 1mb download speeds where public trackers like these have greedy basterds just taking and not leaving shit.
,AnshulBansal,2010-12-10T07:47Z,This is 6.5 GB file & still not full HD. 1080p means 1920x1080 but this is 1920x816. Please upload true Full HD.
,u9hq5yqh,2010-12-10T15:38Z,"AnshulBansal, there would be no way of getting an actual 1920x1080, because it was originally made in a wider format, so if you want an actual 16:9 file, you'll have to cut out some content from the sides. its just called 1080p to make things easier."

Inform yourself before posting non sense comments."
,LigGeorge,2010-12-14T19:30Z,"It's always the same.Most 1080p torrents have at least once ""this is not full hd"".
The resolution is mesured by the width not from the hight."

,Payne25,2010-12-15T11:11Z,"wow thank you so much for this, great Quality burnt to a DL disc and watched on blueray player and was superb"
,adonaij,2010-12-25T01:09Z,"To: u9hq5yqh
Your WRONG. Movies are produced as 1920x1080p.
To:AnshulBansal
I AGREE. Even though animated movies requires less data/size, they tricks us and say its 1080p. It kind of irritates me, because 50% of the torrents are like this in TPB. But lots of uploaders seeks for a E-penis and they know that torrents with less size but ""good quality"" attracts us. And the result is more downloaders"
,adonaij,2010-12-25T01:12Z,"I know that BOXZ has written down the pixelformat, so I dont sound like an idiot. But people often don't notice that and less people know about pixelformats, just that 1080p is better than 720p."
,cb8709,2010-12-27T16:35Z,On My PS3 I get no sound! Perfect picture.

If the ripper were to provide you with 1920x1080 video, a lot of data would be lost encoding the black bars over and under the image itself for movies that are wider than the 16:9 format. It's actually better to have it less than 1080 high.

I can understand it may be hard to understand if you've never done any sort of digital photography, video editing or video encoding, but believe me, as long as a movie is 1920 wide, you're not losing a single pixel from the original picture. Rippers are just reducing the final file size by removing the black bars from the file as they are not needed.

The only loss in quality comes from the conversion from Blu-Ray's H264 or VC-1 codec to the X264 codec used in the MKV container (Which is why you can have a 90 minutes movie at only 6.5GB versus the BD source at 18GB)."
,Scare!,2011-01-05T23:00Z,"Is this a re-encode of http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6023025/Legend.of.the.Guardians.720p.Bluray.x264-CBGB ?  I'm looking at both, freezing on the same frame in each, and this one doesn't seem to have any more detail than the other, and the other might even look a bit better.  Hard to tell though."
,Scare!,2011-01-05T23:30Z,"Yeah, looks like it.  The NFO file is the same, with CBGB's ASCII art, only the encode numbers are different.  Neither mentions a source.

These others credit ""1080p CBGB"" as their source: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6046191/Legend_of_the_Guardians_2010_720p_BRRip_x264-HDLiTE , http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6025681/Legend_Of_The_Guardians_2010_720p_BRRip_XviD_AC3-ViSiON , and http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6025421/Legend_Of_The_Guardians_2010_720p_BRRip_XviD_AC3-ViSiON_BOZX

I can't find a 1080p version by only CBGB (without BOZX), is it on another tracker?

If there isn't one, then http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6023025/Legend.of.the.Guardians.720p.Bluray.x264-CBGB must be the source for this and the other recodes."
