This is a documentary about three of the people most responsible for the birth of radio as an entertainment medium, Dr. Lee De Forest, David Sarnoff, and Edwin Armstrong. I recorded this originally over 15 years ago on VHS. The quality is quite good for an old recording and I cleaned up both the audio and video a bit. I hope you like it. As I cannot find it elsewhere and PLEASE SEED afterwords. Thanks
