I really came to fall in love with the whole lo-fi pop scene this summer, and I wanted to see what I could come up with. After writing â€œLetâ€™s Fall Asleep Togetherâ€, the last three just sort of happened in the span of a few days.

I know that itâ€™s starting to get cold, and that carefree love songs about beach life may seem out of context, but I hope that you guys can look back on your past summer, and let these songs remind you of some of the good experiences you had!
