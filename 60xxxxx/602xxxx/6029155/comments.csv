,MIXicant,2010-12-20T05:21Z,"not sure what's up with this file.  DivX Plus Player crashed when opening, as well as Media Player Classic - Home Cinema.  VLC Player wouldn't play anything when I opened the file with it, and Windows Media Player showed a grey screen with no audio, but moveable seek bar without crashing"

i have searched many but all are 1920x800p.
plz help."
,BigBlack6Pack,2011-04-21T22:12Z,"1080P means 1920x1080 pixels. But if the aspect ratio is 2.4:1 there will be a black border on top and below. To decrease file size, that black border can be cropped, so that the picture only shows the actual movie. That's why it's 800 px. The main thing is that the 1920 width hasn't been tampered with.
This movie IS 1080p! "
