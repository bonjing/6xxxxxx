,gazettegal,2010-12-13T20:47Z,"@2010isover yet your belief in that statement hasn't stopped you from creating an account and checking out sites like this? If you don't agree with sharing, then you shouldn't be looking for torrent sites."
,gazettegal,2010-12-13T21:04Z,"@2010isover  oh and btw, if you knew anything at all, you would know that cbc.ca/coronation provide their episodes online on their own site for free and itv.com also provide the episodes for free viewing online, but there are technological restrictions that make it difficult and/or impossible for people in certain countries to access these videos and a full set of archives takes up too much space for their sites.  

So it is by the awesome efforts of people like albiondean that make it possible for those of us who need it, maybe for a missed episode, to be able to get to it.

albiondean, you rock and your efforts are greatly appreciated!  I've seen your handle cross my screen on a number of occassions now, here and on other sites (Corrie was the start of that for me) and if you're a choice, it's the first download I pick.  I'm surprised you don't have VIP or at least Trusted status here, because you definitely deserve it!  Clean and hi-quality downloads is all I've ever gotten.  Thank You!"
