,sidekick2,2011-05-13T03:05Z,"Thanks for saying that it isn't in English. I can't believe I downloaded the whole thing and it has Spanish, Japanese, Chinese and something else but not English. 

wtf man"
,sidekick2,2011-05-13T03:13Z,"Nevermind. It seems only a few short pieces actually lack English. Thanks, though I wonder if they were even made with English?"
,sidekick2,2011-05-15T02:40Z,"I really have to apologize. There are just so many video files that I was greatly confused. There is nothing excluded with this torrent- though be advised you are downloading multi-language video files, separately from video files that are english-language. That is a slight problem, but technically the entire dvd is there so nothing to complain about. "
