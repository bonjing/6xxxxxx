,snairin,2010-12-24T05:08Z,"Hi HD-R-US,

Merry X-Mas. I just downloaded the movie. Awesome. But still, just to share my concern. Is'nt the black color too much in the screen? Am using a Dell HD LCD monitor.

Thanks a lot for the movie. Merry Xmas & happy new year

,f665r43,2011-01-05T01:37Z,First of all THANK YOU for all the great uploads!!   I have a problem when I download a 1080 p copy and mount it on a virtual drive there is no sound>  the picture is amazing but impossible to watch without sound   any suggestions??
,downloader979,2011-01-07T04:57Z,"I know this must sound like a dumb question, but just wanted to clarify- because these are in the blue ray format, they will not work on dvd players, correct, or will they? i'm a bit unclear on this."
,harry16,2011-01-07T07:01Z,This is Just great really excited for this was just searching for such movies Which are disc images....  I assume this is the exact image of that available in the market sorry still downloading so don't know But i got a query will this work on my BOSE LS 48? it is not Blu ray compatible but is surely hi def compatible.... :)
,eculeader,2011-01-08T21:19Z,"incredibly annoying..

this is not real 1920 x 1080. as someone up said it's 2.35:1 aspect ration, not 16:9 so there is black on the edge that as far as i know cannot be remove aside editing the video so they are removed and then saving it again. really annoying and disappointing. i hate when people keep that black screen bull. "
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-09T22:01Z,"@f665r43 - You're welcome. It must be an audio codec issue, although many computers will not play 1080p smoothly, or in-sync, because it's incredibly resource-hungry.

@snairin - Thanks, and Happy New Year to you too.

@eculeader - If a movie's aspect ratio is 16:9 you will see the black letterbox bars whether they are encoded into the video or not, unless:-

1. Your monitor has a screen resolution equal to 16:9 (which it won't have).
2. The movie's aspect ratio is 4:3, and not 16:9.
3. The movie's width has been cropped, rendering it not 1080p/720p.
4. Your monitor has a zoom facility.

It just so happens that AVCHD format REQUIRES full 1920x1080 or 1280x720 resolution to work, otherwise it throws the aspect ratio out, but there is nothing to be gained by removing ""black screen bull"" as you call it. And since when did a movie's aspect ratio have anything to do with a video's resolution anyway?

You really should do your homework before you post such ignorant comments, or stick to downloading things you know something about, like ebooks on stupidity?"
,SNOOOOOZ,2011-01-11T22:01Z,why the hell i cant play it? darn chlonedrive img... sry im bit dumb on this. anyone?
,murrambingi,2011-01-13T10:53Z,"Thx for the upload HD-R-US,

Great quality but it took a while to convert this one after extracting the video file, it seems maybe you are purposely creating hard work for those who want to make it into a different format or resolution, anyhow i successfully accomplished converting it to the way i wanted it and i must say it is perfect quality even after the conversion good job keep up the good work and thx for the challenge :)

V = 10
A = 10
M = 8"
,stephenjrthomas,2011-01-13T12:27Z,Good job. Love you guys
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-13T20:13Z,"murrambingi - You're welcome, and thanks for the feedback. I assure you that our only purpose is to produce the highest possible quality movies for their size, with AVCHD file/folder structure so that they can be burned to cheap media if so required. Everything we do is in accordance with that - nothing more, nothing less. Obviously, if you want to convert to a lower quality format to re-upload, that is your prerogative, and of course, any conversion will take time.

Not aimed at you in particular, but to the people that still don't understand aspect ratios/video resolution:-

If watched at full-screen, you will see black bars on a movie that has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 whether they are cropped out of the video or not, because the movies simply weren't filmed to fit on most TV/monitor screens. Those mattes also do not add anything to a video's filesize, so if you are removing them for any reason, you are wasting your time.

,ThereICK,2011-01-14T13:51Z,"You Rock HD R US.  

To all the idiots.  
1. Get VLC Player.
2. Double Click ISO file.
3. Double Click BDMV folder.
4. Double Click Stream Folder.
5. Double  0000.m2ts 
6. Use VLC Player to play 0000.m2ts file

THAT IS HOW YOU WATCH IT DIRECTLY ON YOUR COMPUTER"
,g8vin,2011-01-18T20:39Z,"hi there HD-R-US great torent i just wondered if u would tell me what software u use to create these files, i have tried and tried with no sucsess"
,murrambingi,2011-01-19T02:02Z,"@HD-R-US,

No i am not trying to re-upload, but i am interested in converting it to avi format and reducing the size to 720x320res as i have not bought my widescreen yet, and yes i do understand resolution and aspect ratio, but you also have to understand is when you minimize the resolution and change the format, that you need an awsome copy of what you are going to reduce (if you want a some what good quality)
And no i dont crop my movies/videos as i want to keep as much of the quality as possible, oh and sorry if you took offence to what i said in my 1st comment it seems you are only trying to get the best quality :)"
[T],HD-R-US,2011-01-19T05:23Z,"@g8vin - Cheers. If you're looking for similar results from a GUI type application, MultiAVCHD will come close. Not the same, because we encode manually with x264, eac3to, AviSynth, etc etc, but close.

@murrambingi - I have put your username forward for Trusted Uploader, so fingers crossed..."
