"Schaffer The Darklord, STD for short, is a nerdcore rapper. We know each other because we both host burlesque shows in NYC. Only so many people can work craigslist, typographical fonts, or having sex with your own clone into a song. STD is on this select list. He's very refreshing. By STD standards the Bender is pretty straight forward, a song about going on a three day, life-ruining, drug-induced bender."
