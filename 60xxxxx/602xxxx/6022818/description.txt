Herein lies the complete works of Anton Webern. This is the second box set of Webern's works conducted by Boulez. 6 CD's, released by DG.

Contains individual tracks, sorted by the title of the work, as opposed to CD images.



Encoded in FLAC compression-level 5.


**Tagging is done as follows:
Artist == Composer
Album == Name of the work
Title == Title of a part or movement in a work
Genre == The performer(s)
Track == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.

I've done filenames as "%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title"


If there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.
