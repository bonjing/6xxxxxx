,thermal_audio,2010-12-18T03:09Z,"thanks for your work.  not just this one.
very important to capture original mixes when they're good.

this one seems to be better the others i've listened to.  don't know if it's the source or if you're improving the craft.  

whatever the case.  thanks.


jumping jack flash by the rolling stones was never really released as a track on a regularly released album.

it was really a single only and appears on ""best ofs"" and collections.

i'm wondering if the quality of the single is superior to that of the compliation LPs?

i guess that makes a request for anyone to capture HQ PCM and then compress to lossless.
