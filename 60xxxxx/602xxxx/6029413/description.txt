-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  THIS IS THE "COMPACT" VERSION OF THE TORRENT

 All the sound files are of reduced quality (64 Kbps, compared to 192 Kbps for
 the "Complete" version of the torrent). The sound quality is acceptable on 
 portable music players (MP3 players and IPods), but if you're going to listen
   without headphones, you're better off with the "Complete" version of the 
  torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6008874/Michel_Thomas_Complete_V3)

                         THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE TORRENT

This torrent is an update, which only contains only which weren't in Version 2
 (seeded at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4331704/Michel_Thomas_Complete_V2)

  The complete torrent - containing all the files listed in this document - is 
                                  also available

1. DEDICATIONS

  This torrent is dedicated to the life and work of MICHEL THOMAS (1914-2005),
   a man who invented an ingenious and original method for teaching languages.

 Thomas might easily have shared his work with the world. Instead, he chose to 
keep it to himself for fifty years, revealing the "secret" to just a handful of
  wealthy celebrities prepared to pay his extortionate fees. Thanks, Michel!

  The torrent is also dedicated to the team at Hodder Arnold, publishers of
 courses in eight new languages (most of which are pretty good). They are also
 compulsive liars, I'm afraid to say. This little exchange on the official MT    
    Facebook page is typical of the misleading advertising the company has
                           been using since the 1990s:

    Abhishek: I have completed [the] introductory spanish course but when 
    [will] I be able to understand spanish movies...is it be possible after 
    [the advanced course]??

    Hodder Education: The Advanced courses will take you to the standard of
    an English A-Level, so you should be able to follow and understand films
    after completing this level...

  Finally, this torrent is dedicated to the original Joe Kane, compiler of the 
 earlier versions of the torrent. Joe passed away a few months ago and, believe 
 it or not, one of his deathbed requests was that his torrents should continue  
   to be seeded. Version 3 of this torrent has been produced to honour this
                              request. Thanks, Joe!

2. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for downloading this torrent. It contains:

 - All the Michel Thomas Method recordings now available for native English 
   speakers - 196 CDs of material covering 12 languages
 - Copies of the booklets which accompany these courses
 - Transcripts of all the courses published before 2007
 - Two new courses, in French and Spanish, from Paul Noble (who uses a method 
   similar to the one used by Michel Thomas), and copies of the booklets which
   accompany them

The courses for native French speakers have been moved to a separate torrent.

This torrent does not yet contain:

 - Any of the courses produced for native Spanish speakers
 - Any of the courses produced for schools
 - Transcripts for most courses published after 2007
 - Scans of the two books about Michel Thomas ('The Test Of Courage', a 
   biography by Christopher Robbins, and 'The Learning Revolution', by 
   Jonathon Solity)

If you have any of these, please upload them.

Technical information:

 - For Version 3 of the torrent, all the sound files have been re-ripped from
   original CDs
 - New, consistent metadata format which ought to make the sound files easier 
   to use in portable music players (64Kbps bitrate)

3. HOW TO USE MICHEL THOMAS

Not used Michel Thomas before? 

It's better to do one language at a time (not all twelve simultaneously). One 
CD a day would be realistic, but you can stop studying at any point during a
recording and pick it up where you left it the next day.

Study Foundation first, then Advanced, then Vocabulary (if it's available for
the language you're learning), then Builder (if it's available).

If you're learning French, German, Spanish or Italian, there are Review courses
available which summarise material from the Foundation and Advanced courses.

The Foundation courses used to be called "Basic" courses. You can also find 
"Introductory" courses, which are identical to the first 2 CDs of the 
"Foundation" courses.

For full instructions, read one of the course guides in the "Booklets" folder. 
(The instructions are more or less the same for all courses.)

Happy learning!
