"Dance Dance Revelation"

It's Luke & Manny's first school dance and 
everyone gets in on the "fun" -- Jay and Phil 
have to take the boys on a mall run which 
becomes quite stressful; and Claire revels in 
the school dance committee duties, but gets a 
little jealous when Gloria shows up to help. 
Meanwhile, Mitch and Cam are horrified to 
learn that Lily is biting other kids on the 
playground.

Enjoy :)
