Amazon Review:
These sophisticated jazz singers prove just how much their vocal versatility has always embraced pop, doo-wop, rounds, and a cappella music when the foursome explores 10 Christmas songs on a disc that previously was available only in Japan. The group transports "Jingle Bells" to the '40s in a sweeping nostalgic turn and do a knockout take on Charles Brownâ€™s low-down "Merry Christmas Baby" that showcases how elegantly funky they can be. An Acapella Christmas balances the more sophisticated harmony singing the group is known for alongside straightforward versions of "Christmas Is Coming," "Good King Wenceslas" (complete with kid voices), and an otherwise forgettable blatant play for radio on "My Grown-Up Christmas List." But with can't-miss readings of "Christmas Time Is Here," "White Christmas," and a totally magical exploration of "Toyland," the Manhattan Transfer delivers the kind of holiday record certain to please first time listeners while satisfying longtime fans.
