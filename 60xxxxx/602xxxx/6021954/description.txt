Soren (Jim Sturgess) is a young, adventurous Barn Owl who loves hearing stories from his father, Noctus (Hugo Weaving) about the legend of the "Guardians of Gaâ€˜Hoole", a legendary alliance of owls dedicated to doing good works for the owl kingdoms; the most legendary being Lyze of Kiel. His younger sister Eglantine (Adrienne deFaria) is fascinated by these stories. While Soren is telling Eglantine the story of Lyze defeating Metalbeak, leader of an evil army, their older brother Kludd (Ryan Kwanten) scoffs at them, telling Soren he has a "soft head" filled with dreams. Soren replies by simply saying "Thereâ€˜s nothing wrong with dreams." One night, while branching, Soren and Kludd accidentally fall out of their tree. They are attacked by a tasmanian devil, which scars Kluddâ€˜s face. Soren attacks the tasmanian devil to protect his brother, but it turns on him. When Soren begs Kludd to help him, Kludd leaves him to die and tries to escape himself. Before the devil can kill Soren, however, two owls swoop in and kill it
