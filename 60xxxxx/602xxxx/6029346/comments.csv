,loquorlicker,2010-12-11T08:35Z,This shows a recurring pattern of HACKTOOL
,loquorlicker,2010-12-11T08:37Z,It also passes a ESET scan.  But it is a RAR archive inside a ZIP archive inside a RAR archive. Three levels of unneeded hiding. You'd have to be a stone cold idiot to run this.
[T],carter67,2010-12-11T13:04Z,it's make me laugh when I read some of the idiotic comments left about cracks.
[T],carter67,2010-12-11T13:21Z,AND AN OTHER THING IT RARRED SO MANY TIMES SO IT GETS THROUGH THE CRAPY ANTI-VIRUS PROGRAMS YOU USE AS THEY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CRACK AND THE REAL TROJAN OR VIRUS!! 
[T],carter67,2010-12-11T14:44Z,@PiratePatch  Thankyou. It's for folks like yourself I upload and share the software I download from private sites.
