False positive? Maybe..

I also tried to run the application inside Sandboxie to check how it runs.. but nothing, the application did not even execute.. which is kinda suspicious..

No offence to Chusca (the other torrents I've had from you so far all appear clean..), but be careful with this one.. Is up to you, of course.."
,Jamstar,2010-12-09T12:50Z,"@promodsharma. *ALL* Portable Programs? Sorry, promodsharma, but that is just simply not true. A portable application is simply the original application 'virtualized'.. it is fooled at runtime into believing it is directly interfacing with the original operating system and all the resources managed by it, when in reality it is not. It's operating environment is essentially 'encapsulated' within the file (which is why Portable applications are invariably bigger than the original non-portable versions), and certainly does not set-off anti-virus alarms most of the time.
However, it is still possible that the original file (before being made portable with tools like 'ThinApp'), was a cracked, patched or even infected version to start with (or encapsulated with the original file)
Some Virus scanners could therefore possibly identify those cracks and patches within the portable app, and report them as malware, when in fact they are false positives.. maybe..
OR it could be malware attempting a system change before executing the Portable (which is not possible in Sandboxie.. which is why the application possibly did not even start when I tried to run it in Sandboxie) ..possibly..
Remember, recently written malicious code isn't necessarily detectable for a while until it is identified by Anti-Virus software, which could be sometime later.. when it's too late!

To be safer, it is best practice to use software like Sandboxie to run programs like this, (its free too!)
http://www.sandboxie.com/

Either way, it could just be a false positive. Sorry guys, I'm not trying to lecture, just to let people know they should be aware..

Anyway, I'm sure Green Skulled Chusca is aware of this too, and has no such malicious intentions (no offence, Chusca:)

Take care, Promodsharma and Chusca.. happy torrenting:) ..and thanks for the uploads!
(apologies for the massive comment too.. hehe!)

[V],chusca,2010-12-09T15:56Z,"promodsharma partner as always thank you very much for your help and always perform the translation into English. Jamster partner say that his words offend me much less that we are all here to expose the problems and fix them. All qe programs and I guarantee I climb a lot and increases have been previously analyzed by antivirus and I would never upload anything infected. The companion promodsharma already know a bit the way I work and I think that you can tell if I've ever uploaded a virus program. As you said you are often false virus and should not be given any importance. Corrigo quite my job to get you best. Thanks and regards promodsharma and Jamster. I have a green skull and will be for something, do not you think?"
,Jamstar,2010-12-09T17:08Z,"Hola Chusca.. hehe.. :)
No worries.. I guessed you already take great care in ensuring all of your uploads are clean.. Yes, you don't get a green skull for nothing!
Sorry if you think I might have scared some people from downloading your torrent, it was not my intention. It's just to help people become more aware of safety generally with all torrents!

Chusca & Promodsharma,  thank you both for your hard work and good attitude.. :) Looking forward to more..

Take care, and have a good Christmas!
