[T],MitZep,2010-12-11T12:35Z,"hey prashant i had a question there is this guy on 1337 rapid ripper who does brrip at 350 and 480p..
his quality is excellant.. i always thought brrip or hd was only 720p and above but his screenshots are also great so im confused which is better 480p or 720p ripped from same blu ray source considering size and quality??  "
,DSIN,2010-12-11T13:27Z,"^ Bluray r originally 720p & 1080p ... but brrip is an encoded Bluray Rip.. so it can be encoded in any vertical resolution...
be it 480p, 352p or even 272p.. 
Quality... it depends on Video Bitrate... 
With same Video Bitrate... the file with lower resolution will have more Quality :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-11T13:30Z,"@DSIN
I doubt that too..

@Mitzep
First of all HD is only 720p n above...less then 720p doesn't come in HD category..
Nd a 480p of suppose avatar with 468 kbps video bitrate will be equal to a 720p with bitrate 1500kbps that is if u talk bits/pixel wise..they both will look same on suppose a 17""..bt as u""ll increase the size of ur screen 480p will start looking worse..all due to bitrate..so ur choice should be a 720p if u hv big screen..
Bt then if u make a 480p with 1500kbps then u can pack more details in it as compared to 720p with 1500kbps...so in that case ur choice should be a 480p..."

I have a question for you, why did you make Movie 13  and some of the early ones in a different resolution (512 x 288) and almost all the other in 576 x 336? It is hard to combine movies that aren't the same resolution?"
