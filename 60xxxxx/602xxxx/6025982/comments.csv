If Someone Can Tell Me How To Download This Using Utorrent, I WILL SEED TO 10.000

I PROMISE.!!!!!!!!!"
,Sprite0,2010-12-11T22:40Z,"I've changed my mind - use of uncompressed tar is not a good enough reason to bypass this torrent, especially since it would take me a very long time to create a proper alternative, and the benefit from compression / being able to select which files to download isn't this great.  I'll just seed this (I have multiple seedbox accounts), and extract to multiple HTTP mirrors in a little bit."

Please seed!  You can also help by getting a seedbox, which will spread information for you 24/7 at lightning fast speed without affecting your home connection.  An account with just a few torrent slots and 20GB space usually costs $5/month or less, and you'll be supporting a grass-roots business that helps promote freedom of speech!"

Oh god, who gives a shit about malware. If you didn't run Windows, you wouldn't have any problems.

Be smart, install Ubuntu on your computer. It'll run better, and it's virus proof."
