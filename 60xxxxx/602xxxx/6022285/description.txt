"Wins and Losses"
The producers of The Shield produced a 15-minute "promosode", which premiered on Google on February 15, 2007, to bridge the gap between Seasons 5 and 6. The episode focuses on the aftermath of Lem's death, including his funeral and flashbacks as co-workers reflect upon Det. Lemansky's life.

It is not the best quality, but considering I could not find it here on TPB, and only managed to find a complete copy of it buried in a complete series torrent elsewhere, this is the best I can do.
Supposedly it is included on the Season 5 set, so if anyone rips a better version, please seed it do not forget to provide separate subtitles!) and drop your link here. Thanks!
