Released By TEAM DELiRiUM on 01-09-2003 as a 2cd iSO

We bring this rip for those on lesser bandwidth and so it can be left installed on HD without taking up much room at all:)

The sound problems with the original
are all fixed. A new interface for easier
viewing of the tutorials has been made.

The help section does call official
Steinberg websites so your firewall
may squeak at you, but it's only a port 80
call, same as any browser. :)

It's stuck at 1024x768 like the original.

Have fun and LEARN!!
