          =====================================                             
                                                                            
          Compatibility Fixes                                               
                                                                            
          - Anti-aliasing quality control added to Graphics Settings        
            screen.                                                         
                                                                            
          - Improved compatibility with Shader Model 2.0 graphics cards.    
                                                                            
          - Fixed cases of invisible and garbled text on the title          
            screen and settings screen on some systems.                     
                                                                            
          - Some lower end video cards which formerly just drew a black     
            screen should now display the game.                             
                                                                            
          Poker & Gameplay Fixes                                            
                                                                            
          - At the end of a hand, winners of the main pot and any side      
            pots all announced individually. (Previously, only the          
            winner of the biggest pot was announced.)                       
                                                                            
          - Each round, the minimum raise starts at the big blind until     
            someone raises, after which the minimum raise is the amount     
            of that last raise.                                             
                                                                            
          - In heads up (one on one) play, the dealer is now the small      
            blind and first to act pre-flop.                                
                                                                            
          - If a someone folds and is part of a side pot, and after the     
            fold only one person remains in the sidepot, the sidepot        
            gets cleared and paid out to that one remaining person.         
                                                                            
          - The tutorial now automatically comes up once, the first time    
            the game is played. It is still also available on-demand        
            from the Poker Help screen.                                     
                                                                            
          - Players who have a straight flush, four of a kind, full         
            house, flush or straight will now get the appropriate hand      
            achievement even if everyone else folds to them in that         
            hand.                                                           
                                                                            
          - Fixed issue causing character tells to rarely play.             
                                                                            
          - Fixed issue causing only one of the player's hole cards to      
            display when skipping dialog.                                   
                                                                            
          - Improved readability/consistency on the unlockable Strong       
            Bad card deck.                                               
                                                                            
          Content                                                           
                                                                            
          - Two new poker tables available on the Unlocks screen:           
            "Poker Night" and "Inventory Security"
