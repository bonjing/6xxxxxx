AFROSKULL - [drop-dead funk]
Afroskull is greasy persuasion and bad gris-gris. A New York City funk/rock collective by way of New Orleans, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Skull is a sonic gumbo that is one part Funkadelic and one part Black Sabbath with generous helpings of Zappaesque runs and jazzoid horns.  The interplay of their heady musicianship and fat bottomed grooves helps to keep les bon temps rouler all night long.

To Obscurity and Beyond, their first album in nine years, is a tempestuous marriage of rock, funk and jazz.  Dripping with ecstatic elaborate arrangements, Joe ScatassaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s production and original compositions are hell bent on keeping you shaking your ass and banging your head. Joined by Ronnie Cuber (baritone sax, bass clarinet), of Mingus Big Band and Frank Zappa fame, the lush brass orchestrations compliment and combat the underlying full throttle gonzo spunk. Punctuated by two spitfire vocal tracks, the mostly instrumental offering stampedes, but never tramples.  To Obscurity and Beyond further separates Afroskull from the majority of their peers as it marks the return of their uniquely fierce and unrelenting voice to the scene.
