Michael Jackson - Dangerous Bonus Disc (2010)


This is reportedly the bonus disc that was supposed to be included with the Dangerous album, but was shelved for whatever reason. This album includes a lot of alternative versions of already released songs, but also some unreleased tracks. "What About Us" is the original version of Earth Song.
