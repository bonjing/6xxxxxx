This is my second try on posting this:

Riverdance The Show 1995

About this DVD:
As far as I know this performance has yet to be released to DVD. For my own needs I rendered a VHS HiFi mint condition tape to DVD using Nero Recode and a little time. I feel that the finished product's quality and the archival importance is worth posting as an ISO image.

This first performance featured Irish Dancing Champions Jean Butler & Michael Flatley, the RTE Concert Orchestra and the Celtic choral group Anuna with a score written by Bill Whelan. Whelan had also composed Timedance an early version of Riverdance for the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest, performed by Planxty. Most of the show's choreography was done by Flatley.
