The file is an ISO image, primarily made for DVD burning but it can also be mounted to a virtual drive (daemon tools lite or alcohol 120%) and played with media players such as VLC. Thanks for the ul !"

I've downloaded it twice and eventually figured out how to convert it from iso to something I can see but the problem is this . . . I've tried burning to disc and can only get the main title and an image with a girl and a white back ground.  Doesn't go any farther in playing than that even tho you can see there's more.  2nd is that when I do convert it, it says there is no audio file to convert.  Only video.  HELP!!!"
