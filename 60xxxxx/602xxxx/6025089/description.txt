 Description:
 Documentary which takes viewers on a rollercoaster ride through the wonderful 
 world of statistics to explore the remarkable power thay have to change our   
 understanding of the world, presented by superstar boffin Professor Hans      
 Rosling, whose eye-opening, mind-expanding and funny online lectures have made
 him an international internet legend.                                         
                                                                               
 Rosling is a man who revels in the glorious nerdiness of statistics, and here 
 he entertainingly explores their history, how they work mathematically and how
 they can be used in today's computer age to see the world as it really is, not
 just as we imagine it to be.                                                  
                                                                               
 Rosling's lectures use huge quantities of public data to reveal the story of  
 the world's past, present and future development. Now he tells the story of   
 the world in 200 countries over 200 years using 120,000 numbers - in just four
 minutes.                                                                      
                                                                               
 The film also explores cutting-edge examples of statistics in action today. In
 San Francisco, a new app mashes up police department data with the city's     
 street map to show what crime is being reported street by street, house by    
 house, in near real-time. Every citizen can use it and the hidden patterns of 
 their city are starkly revealed. Meanwhile, at Google HQ the machine          
 translation project tries to translate between 57 languages, using lots of    
 statistics and no linguists.                                                  
                                                                               
 Despite its light and witty touch, the film nonetheless has a serious message 
 - without statistics we are cast adrift on an ocean of confusion, but armed   
 with stats we can take control of our lives, hold our rulers to account and   
 see the world as it really is. What's more, Hans concludes, we can now collect
 and analyse such huge quantities of data and at such speeds that scientific   
 method itself seems to be changing.                                           

                                Enjoy!
