Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention

Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention is a BBC One science show featuring the animated claymation characters Wallace and Gromit, made by Aardman. The BBC said in a press statement that in the series, "Wallace will take a light hearted and humorous look at the real-life inventors, contraptions, gadgets and inventions, with the silent help of Gromit. The series aims to inspire a whole new generation of innovative minds by showing them real, but mind-boggling, machines and inventions from around the world that have influenced his illustrious inventing career."
Peter Sallis reprised his role as the voice of Wallace. The filmed inserts are mostly narrated by Ashley Jensen, with one in each episode presented in-vision by Jem Stansfield (Wallace's science correspondant who looks at ideas that "never got off the drawing board"). John Sparkes also voices a portion in the unseen character of archivist Goronwy.
