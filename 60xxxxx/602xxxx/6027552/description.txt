"Raise Your Glass" is a song by American singer-songwriter Pink from her first compilation album, Greatest Hits... So Far!!!. It was released as the lead single in the United States on October 8, 2010. The song is written by Pink, Max Martin and Shellback and is produced by the latter two. The song received critical appreciation, who named it a party anthem and praised its catchy chorus. It peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Pink's second solo number-one single and her third overall.
The music video for the song began filming on October 4, 2010.[3] The video itself is based around one of Pink's real-life experiences, and features a celebration of gay marriage, expressing her views that people should not feel any differently towards gay marriage than straight marriage. Pink commented on the video in an interview for MTV: "I threw my best friend's wedding in my backyard â€” she is gay and she married her wife, and it was absolutely beautiful. At the end of it, her mom said, 'Why can't this be legal?' and started crying. It was just the most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen, so that's why I'm doing it in my video." The music video overall promotes gender, racial, social, sexual orientation, religious, and species equality; with regards to nonhuman animal rights, it tackles specifically bullfighting (with P!nk defending a bull from a matador) and the dairy industry (depicting a calf feeding on human milk). P!nk dons a balaclava and black clothes in some scenes, which is a reference to the Animal Liberation Front. The video was released on P!nk's official website Tuesday, November 2nd at 6PM EST.
