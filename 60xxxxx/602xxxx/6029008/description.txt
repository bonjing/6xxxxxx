           The teenagers Marcus, Liz, Craig and Nina are camping in       
           the remote outback of Australia. While driving on the          
           road, a road train crashes on their car that leaves the        
           road in a serious accident. The quartet survives and           
           Craig breaks his arm, but their car is totally wrecked.        
           However they see the train truck parked on road and            
           Marcus and Liz walk to the vehicle to ask for help. They       
           do not find the driver and soon Craig and Nina arrive.         
           When they see the driver shooting at them, they decide to      
           carjack the road train. Soon they begin to act strange         
           possessed by some evil force.
