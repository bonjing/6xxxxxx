,sunisstar,2010-12-18T02:58Z,Together with Paranormal Activity this is the best horror flick of the last 10 years
,Mathlol,2010-12-26T08:04Z,"Wow, after scannign through many movies, I've concluded the encoding settings gives a ""soft"" touch, much like TmG's work.
Not a fan."
,RickDart,2011-01-02T11:31Z,"Okay, the movie is bad. I mean is alright. It's sorta boring. Paranomal Activity is great. [Rec] was definitely one of the top horror flicks of the decade. i only watched REC recently and it blew me away. It's been a long time since a watched a decent horror movie. Downloading the sequel right now"
,Woreyel,2011-01-10T07:12Z,"Another M. Night Shyamalan masterpiece, I've heard many reviews about this movie, about how it's boring, and just plain crap, but the people who say this are just looking for total Americanized money making thrillers, that have no thought put into them at all.
   I thought this movie had a fantastic twist, superb actually! Oh and by the way the quality of the torrent is top notch, I can't find a pixelated area in the movie at all! so 10/10 for the picture!"
,ruben10111,2011-01-13T19:07Z,"If you're up to horror movies that's made ""perfect"" this will probably not be your best choice, but if you like the somewhat meaningful horror-movies that gives you one hell of an experience, press ""download this torrent""
