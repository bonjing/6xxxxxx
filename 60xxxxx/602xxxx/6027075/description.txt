HQ rare promo music video. "My Doorbell" is the third track by the American alternative rock band The White Stripes from their album Get Behind Me Satan (2005) and the second single to be released from the album. The song is piano-driven and primarily uses three chords: F, B flat, and E flat, although a C is also played in the bridge section of the song. Also there is an A- flat that resolves back to the F before the next verse. The song garnered The White Stripes a 2006 Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals.

This video for the single was directed by The Malloys, filmed in black-and-white, and features Jack and Meg performing in front of a crowd of children. The video premiered on August 19, 2005 on Nickelodeon following an episode of Unfabulous that featured Jack and Meg White.
