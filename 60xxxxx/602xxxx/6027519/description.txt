Having played with the likes of Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Mike Stern, Hiromi, Zakir Hussain, Branford Marsalis and John McLaughlin, the multi-instrumentalist/composer, Tony Grey is releasing his third album as a leader, Unknown Angels - a work of expansive emotional range, great personal significance and stunning virtuosity.

Unknown Angels is the most fully realized statement yet from an artist who may have started late but has certainly made up for lost time.
