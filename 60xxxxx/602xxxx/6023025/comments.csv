Movie was Great!"
,danielcsilva,2010-12-11T19:07Z,"There is something that i don't understand!
Why the releases always say 720p or 1080p, and most of the time (95%), doesn't have 720p or 1080p.

For example this one has 544p
(is 1280x544) 
This suck, because almost every one have 16:9 screen's, and must see the movies with the black bars."
[V],HolyRoses,2010-12-12T01:35Z,movies aren't made that way.
,hellking20,2010-12-12T10:07Z,thanks great upload
,famegirls,2010-12-14T20:00Z,danielcsilva: there is a difference between 1.77 aspect ratio movies and 2.4. The widescreen tvs sold are 16:9(1.7) so a 720p or 1080p fill the whole screen. Many movies are made at a 2.4ar so you have the letterboxing and thus not a true 720 or 1080p when mastered.
,Rafiq07,2010-12-15T13:38Z,can anyone seed it.... its too slow out here in saudi arabia...
,Krabaman,2010-12-18T09:21Z,Great quality!!!

,Mathlol,2010-12-26T03:18Z,"Thanks for the up. Decent, but oddly the not good for the size at all. Should check the screen people.

The flawless release by chris-aksel has far better screens.

[V],aoloffline,2010-12-26T13:43Z,"MAthol pls don't post any comment.You only embaras yourself..
The flawless source is 720p cbgb (which means this),so if the screen looks better ,than the encode is not transparent..
That;s why you won't see flawless ,vision...and groups like that in my uplaods

and btw if you compare a rip of a rip ,with this,than you watch movies on your 17 inch PC,and listen to pc speakers,in which case i recommand to you dvd rips :-)"

,jm413d,2011-01-09T03:50Z,"I don't have any problems watching anything I DL from TPB, but when I DL BR movies is there something better to watch with than Win MP? My PC Monitor is a 40"" Sony Bravia 1080p HDTV using it's sound card. Is there something out there that I should be using?"

I have downloaded plenty of HD and Blueray movies from TPB but this is the only one that doesn't have audio when I play it on my HD TV but there is audio on my pc.

Thoughts?
