 ""MY RELEASES ARE ALWAYS .AVI AS IS. NO SPECIAL SOFTWARE IS REQUIRED. YOU NEED TO HAVE THE RIGHT FREE CODECS INSTALLED ONLY

aXXo RELEASES ARE NEVER RARED OR PASSWORDED, IF YOU FIND THEM ELSEWHERE DON'T DOWNLOAD, THEY WILL BE FAKES OR A SCAM FOR SURE.

ALSO REMEMBER : TORRENTS WITH THE aXXo TAG NOT LISTED ON THIS FORUM ARE FAKES OR THE TORRENT IS DEAD ""

and the last dated release on that site is dates in 2008,plus I'd also heard from other sources that he had stopped releasing a couple of years ago so how come these all claim to be his work? 
I'm not saying they are fakes, with the number of releases on this account I seriously doupt they are fake, just questioning who actually ripped them and why they feel they have to use someone elses name instead of their own."

Alot of the movie torrents lately are huge files...
Ripping at 700Mb's is easy and Sceneline is doing a good job. Stop complaining....
Who cares if he writes aXXo? Seriously?

Thanks for your time and the ups
Happy Holidays

I've downloaded a few of Scenelines files. They are always small movie files that are good quality for 700Mb' rips.Very easily done. 
Stop complaining, they are legit.Instead thank sceneline for taking the time to provide you leechers 

Thanks Sceneline
Happy Holidays
