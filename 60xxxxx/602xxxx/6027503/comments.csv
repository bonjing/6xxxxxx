,mallrat_ld90,2010-12-27T14:24Z,What is that battery app?  I really like that all tiny and still much more exact.

,bluesskyflyer,2011-12-06T11:36Z,"Installed on my HTC Wildfire (after changing the extension to .apk) but it wouldn't open. I uninstalled it and went back to Slideit keyboard, but now that wouldn't work either. In fact then I had no keyboard at all on my phone!  Thought I'd f.cked my phone. Anyhow I uninstalled Slideit and reinstalled it and phew, thank christ it was all ok again. I prefer swype but the new version is so huge, 12mb's, it takes up too much memory. Slideit is ok."
,bluesskyflyer,2011-12-07T18:01Z,"Further to my last, I bit the bullet and reinstalled my legit swype. (It's only a question of registering and getting an activation code.) Slide it was ok, but I got fed up with mis-spells and mistakes that I never got with good old swype. It was worth making some space on my phone to reinstall it.
PS It maybe that this version wouldn't work because of the Wildfire screen resolution?"
