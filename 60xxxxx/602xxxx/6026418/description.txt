E M Forster
A Room With A View (Unabridged)
Read by Joanna David
Length: 7 hours and 23 minutes.

This hilarious and touching novel embodies Forster's favorite theme â€” the "undeveloped heart" of the English middle classes.

A Room with a View stars Lucy Honeychurch, a charming naif torn between lingering social and sexual Victorian proprieties and her own emotional needs.

Forsterâ€™s outrageous spinsters, pompous clergymen, and outspoken patriots add wit to what is, in the end, not only a comic masterpiece but a compelling romance and social critique.


Enjoy and Seed!!
