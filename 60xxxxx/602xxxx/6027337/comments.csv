,pastamanpastaman,2011-01-21T05:09Z,How does this work exactly?  I don't fancy entering my social security number into pirated software.
,coyote0630,2011-01-22T06:01Z,"pastaman... i personally have been using a system like this  i.e. ""pirated"" as you refer to it as    for about 10 years or so and have NEVER EVER had any sort of problem... just because the software is ""copied"" doesn't mean that there has been any security breaches, if you are running a good AV program then it is gonna catch any trojans or backdoors that are imbedded (theoretically of course)"
,coyote0630,2011-01-22T06:04Z,and TY to both floorpisser for the upload and to Tippy for the multiple state info. (nice find dude)

,nate2170,2011-01-26T13:02Z,"El_Guapo74: For windows 7 and Vista,  browse to the c:\users folder, then find your login name and the rest is exactly the same as Wwtippy describes."

,sneekR,2011-02-05T23:36Z,"Just discovered this trick. 

DOWNLOAD ALL STATE FORMS YOU NEED *F-r-e-e

-Install TTax2010
-Opt for automatic updates

DO NOT START THE APP YET. 

-go to RegEdit (type that into search/run bar in windows)
-go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software>Intuit>TY10
-in window on right, right-click, select new>string value.

-heres the fun part. take your state's 2 letter abbr, encapsulate it inside 'w[insert 2 letter abbr here]iper'. ex. CA state would be 'wcaiper'. (make sure its lowercase). 

-double click new value and enter '1' in data field. 

-start up TTax2010
-scan for new updates (it should ask to do this automatically) or go to Online>Check for updates

*note - messing with registry values can mess up your pc. dont go fooling around in there. 

you heard it here first. "

,mast3rJd,2011-03-07T21:38Z,"the regedit works beautifully, as an aside, if you modify the string value to a larger number, it seems to let you install as many as you want all at once.  thought it might help. I installed 8 states!
woohoo"
,mast3rJd,2011-03-07T22:10Z,"re-seeding this in the home and business variety with the instructions for how to get free states
hope this helps, I installed 8 different states this way to test it out.

,natturner,2011-03-10T02:23Z,has anyone actually filed electronically using this yet?  does it work?  is it safe?
,benzL1021,2011-03-14T09:10Z,"Is it okay to use the e-file method, or because this is cracked should I print it and mail it?"
,gwasshoppa,2011-04-03T18:47Z,Download works fine. But I used the regedit method to get multiple states but I'm still being asked to pay for my second state. I'm using XP. Any suggestions?
