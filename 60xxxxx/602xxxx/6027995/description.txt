Release Info 
http://www.daan.be/

Daan is a Belgian band and solo project, formed by Dead Man Ray
member Daan Stuyven. When playing live, it consists of:

Daan Stuyven (lead and guitar)
Steven Janssens (guitar)
Otti Van Der Werf (bass)
Isolde Lasoen (drums)
Jeroen Swinnen (synthesizer)
Gregory Frateur (backing vocals)

The first album bearing the "Daan" label, "Profools", was released in
1999. It's a compilation from various tracks recorded by Daan Stuyven
between 1996 and 1999. The Dead Man Ray rock-influence is obvious,
though this album already contains some electro.

The second album, "Bridge Burner", was released in 2002 and was their
big breakthrough. The biggest hit, Swedish Designer Drugs, marked the
beginning of a career in electronic music. At the same time, Dead Man
Ray decided to take some time off, and Daan Stuyven was able to focus
on Daan.

They carried on making electronic music and added kitsch. Their third
album, "Victory", was released in 2004. Again, the album is a huge
success, and includes the hit singles "Victory", "Addicted", and
"Housewife". It quickly achieved golden status, and Daan received the
Zamu award for best album in 2004.

In the summer of 2005 Daan released "Type Ex", a single containing
two songs: Type Ex and Ex Type. This single would be included on his
fourth studio album "The Player", which was released in 2006.

Daan Stuyven is also a popular soundtrack composer for indie films.
In the fall of 2005 "Cinema", a compilation album of his soundtrack
compositions, was released.

His fifth studio album, "Manhay", was released in 2009. The album saw
a return to the more rock/pop-influenced sound of his first solo-
album and his Dead Man Ray-era. The album does not contain
electronics, synths or beats.

Today Daan has recorded a new acoustic album in the ardennes.
Together with Isolde Lasoen on vibraphone and percussion, and Jean-
Francois Assy on the cello, he revisited some of his favourite own
songs & lyrics from the last 10 years, in an absolutely minimalistic
way. The record is released now for the extensive 70-days tour this
winter + spring next year.
