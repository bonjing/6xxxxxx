All fakes? Or am I missing codecs? Where do I get em?"

[T],tzanev,2010-12-08T06:34Z,"I have never had a problem playing .avi files, not even with Windows Media Player. Just get VLC mate and you'll never have to download any codecs. Thanks VTV!"

,Yeet2k,2010-12-08T07:44Z,Windows 7 with every god damn update I can think of :(. I've been using VLC for years without issue but for some reason this file won't play.
,JRKandoit,2010-12-08T08:44Z,VLC has worked for all previous episodes. There's no reason for it to not work for this one.
