,logansmama,2010-12-09T18:11Z,"I don't go posting on listings for your porn or whatever other ""crappy tv"" you watch, so please don't be rude here.  Not everyone watches or likes the same programs; the world sure would be boring if we all liked the exact same things."
,cruisingbull,2010-12-14T02:02Z,"@logansmama: Thank you for this torrent. I am also looking for the Caribou Hunt (4) and EP 1. They were on the board last time I looked, but not now. Can you help? TIA"
,cruisingbull,2010-12-14T02:09Z,"@exhell: I don't understand your antagonism to Gov. Palin. Have you protested the several skits lampooning her? Or are you in favor of those? IMO, she is a thousand times more intelligent, has more integrity, and more courage than the PoS presently sitting in the Oval Office. Now, you have had your say, and I have had mine. How about we let it go at that, and both praise the contributors to this board who have made programs available to us that we would normally not be able to access. Thank you."
,gr1zzly,2011-01-05T03:03Z,"logansmama: Thank you for this!  Can you post any more episodes?

exhell:  Sarah Palin represents everything that's great about America.  The liberals and socialists hate her, and the liberal-controlled media attack her and smear her.... are u a mindless dolt who is brainwashed by the liberal media? 

Thank God for internet and all other media beyond the control of the crazy leftists!  The socialist liberals can't control and regulate everything!!!  (Although scumbag Obama had his FCC pass new regulation for internet service providers... he is trying to stick his leftist government hands into the internet now).
