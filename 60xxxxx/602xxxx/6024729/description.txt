Introduction

In Windows XP, I was used to turning on "Show icon in notification area when connected" and Windows would display a blinking icon to indicate network traffic on the System Tray.
In Windows 7, all I can get is a static icon to show I am on a network, no animation to show me the traffic.

I figured out that the animation feature had been removed from Windows 7, so I decided to create a simple application to satisfy those people (including myself) who want to see when data is coming and going on the network.
