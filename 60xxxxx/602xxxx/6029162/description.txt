Full HD Video, New Modules, Data Disc Menus. Ashampoo Burning Studio users are unusually loyal, with good reason â€“ this programâ€™s speed, simplicity and efficiency are simply unbeatable. Over the years the Ashampoo programmers have turned the program into a full suite that can handle all your data, audio and video burning and authoring tasks, without sacrificing its famous ease of use. In version 10 they have once again added a wealth of new features and modules, but the program is still amazingly intuitive to use â€“ everything is explained as you do it. The main focus of this premium version is even better authoring capabilities for building video and audio discs using the latest formats. HD and Full HD video (720p and 1080p) are now fully supported for Blu-ray discs, and all the encoding is handled by Ashampoo Burning Studio 10. All the authoring tools have been overhauled and the video encoding quality is even better than before.

And there is now also a new Audio Player with which you can play audio files and audio CDs without leaving the program.
