Last Train to Paris is the upcoming fifth studio album by American rapper and producer Diddy, scheduled for release from December 13, 2010 through Bad Boy Records (Interscope). The album follows Diddyâ€™s alter-ego as he travels from London to Paris to regain a lost love. In April 2009 Diddy formed Dirty Money, a group consisting of Dawn Richards (formerly of Danity Kane) and singer-songwriter Kalenna Harper. The group performs on this album along with a total of sixteen guest vocals from the likes of Grace Jones and Drake to Usher and Lil Wayne. To reflect the corture concept of the album, Last Train to Paris also features vocal segues from designers and editors of the fashion world including Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and Tommy Hilfiger amongst others.
