PLOT:


Three brothers against an army. Justice knows no boundaries. 

As Wyoming settles into its first year of statehood, a fresh set of battlelines are being drawn across the land, pitting rich cattle barons against newly arrived homesteaders. Caught in the cross fire are the three Hammett brothers, Cain (Tom Berenger), Harry (Luke Perry), and Dale (Adam Storke). When hired gun Hunt Lawton (Burt Reynolds) starts forcing settlers out through fear and intimidation, all three Hammetts choose to stay for separate reasons. But as the countryside erupts into a full scale war, they are forced to choose sides and fight to the end.
