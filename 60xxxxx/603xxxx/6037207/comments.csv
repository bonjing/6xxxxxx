Maybe the easiest solution for you folks that doesn't speak foreign, is to download the missing 2 files from scenebalance torrent.

Direct download link:
http://torrents.thepiratebay.org/6037218/The.Spliff.Report.2010.DVDRip.XviD-REACTOR.6037218.TPB.torrent

Scenebalance is also a VIP and have submitted a torrent with rar's. 

1. Stop the torrent
2. Choose the subs.rar and subs.sfv (size of them is only 1.66MB).
3. Skip the other files
4. Start the download of the torrent again"
