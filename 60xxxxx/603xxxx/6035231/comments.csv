,caulkins,2011-01-27T04:37Z,"Thanks for catching up with these.  Unfortunately, I'd gotten out of the habit of checking for them and now there are no seeders left for this one.  Could you possibly re-seed?"
,caulkins,2011-02-19T23:49Z,Still no seeders.  I've been doing my part over the last three weeks by reseeding several other Degrassi webrips that needed it.  Will no one help with this one?  I've seen as many as seven people at one time trying to get it.
