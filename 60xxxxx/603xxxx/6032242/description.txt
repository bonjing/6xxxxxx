Professor Toto Multi-Media Language Education Series was created for 2 to 12 year olds to learn a new language naturally. As they laugh and sing with Professor Toto and his student Sophia, Eric, and a driving giraffe, they make a seamless transition into a second language. Don't miss that prime time to learn another language.
