The Alchemyst is a contemporary fantasy which opens in modern day San Francisco when brother and sister, Josh and Sophie discover that the owner of the bookstore where Josh works is the immortal French alchemist, Nicholas Flamel. Flamel and his wife, Perenelle, are the guardians of the Book of Abraham which they have protected for centuries. This is a collection of the most powerful spells in the world. When Dr John Dee discovers the Flamels\\\' whereabouts, he attacks and snatches the book. Josh and Sophie intervene to help Flamel, but now they too are being hunted by Dee and creatures that predate humanity.

All of the main characters in The Alchemyst series are based on figures from history or mythology.

Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel both existed. Nicholas was born in France in 1330, and not only do his diaries and writings exist, his house at 51 rue de Montmorency still stands in Paris today.

In his diaries he writes extensively about discovering the Book of Abraham, and his long quest to translate it. He claims he discovered the secret of the Philosopher\\\'s Stone â€“ how to turn base metal into gold - and also the secret of eternal life.

From being a poor bookseller, he became extraordinarily wealthy and founded schools, churches and hospitals in Paris. In recognition for his charitable works, there are two streets named after him and Perenelle.

He lived simply and when he died in 1418, his tomb was broken into by thieves looking for his vast wealth.

His tomb â€“ and that of Perenelle â€“ were both empty.

In the centuries that followed, there were several sightings of Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel across Europe.



THE MAGICIAN

After fleeing Ojai, Nicholas, Sophie, Josh, and Scatty emerge in Paris, the City of Lights. Home for Nicholas Flamel. Only this homecoming is anything but sweet. Perenelle is still locked up back in Alcatraz and Paris is teeming with enemies. Niccolo Machiavelli, immortal author and celebrated art collector, is working for Dee. He\\\'s after them, and time is running out for Nicholas and Perenelle. For every day spent without the Book of Abraham the Mage, they age one year-their magic becoming weaker and their bodies more frail. For Flamel, the Prophecy is becoming more and more clear.

It\\\'s time for Sophie to learn the second elemental magic: Fire Magic. And there\\\'s only one man who can teach it to her: Flamel\\\'s old student, the Comte de Saint-Germain-alchemist, magician, and rock star. Josh and Sophie Newman are the world\\\'s only hope-if they don\\\'t turn on each other first.




THE SORCERESS

Nicholas Flamel\\\'s heart almost broke as he watched his beloved Paris crumble before him. The city was destroyed by Dee and Machiavelli, but Flamel played his own role in the destruction. Sophie and Josh Newman show every sign of being the twins of prophecy, and Flamel had to protect them and the pages from the Dark Elders.

But Nicholas grows weaker with each passing day. Perenelle is still trapped in Alcatraz, and now that Scatty has gone missing, the group is without protection. Except for Clarent-the twin sword to Excalibur. But Clarent\\\'s power is unthinkable, its evil making it nearly impossible to use without its darkness seeping into the soul of whoever wields it.

If he hopes to defeat Dee, Nicholas must find an Elder who can teach Josh and Sophie the third elemental magic-Water Magic. The problem? The only one who can do that is Gilgamesh, and he is quite, quite insane.
