Jon Snow interviews the novelist and former spy at his home in Cornwall, discussing his life and career. The author recounts his childhood with his father, and his MI6 operations during the Cold War in the 1960s. 

He also reflects on his best-selling book The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. The programme features clips from TV and film adaptations of his works, and John reads extracts from his acclaimed Smiley novels.

Since the end of the Cold War, Le Carre's novels have characteristically portrayed the malicious  machinations of global corporate power and the duplicitous assistance it gets from  the Western intelligence community. 

His latest book is Our Kind of Traitor and deals with the Russian kelptocracy and the help it gets from Western bankers.
