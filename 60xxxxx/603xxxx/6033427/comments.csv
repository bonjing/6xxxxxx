,Strikefear13,2010-12-14T05:48Z,"Still doesn't make it a pc game.. shouldn't be advertised as such.  KEEP IN MIND ANYBODY ATTEMPTING TO DOWNLOAD THIS.  IT IS A WII GAME, NOT PC."

,swordsmanofgale,2010-12-17T14:44Z,"Hmm guys I need some help :(.. I downloaded this iso and I downloaded a version of dolphin from their website, but when I open dolphin it says that my iso seems to be ""invalid or not a wii-iso"" How do I solve this? Is it possible that I got the wrong version of dolphin? Im not a very technical girl but I love fatal frame and this is probably my only chance to play this game, so I hope you have any idea~ "

,A.Wesker,2011-01-17T14:51Z,"Cant belive this but it actually works, is in english and the emulator has been added to the game making it like a normal pc game. Mount, install it and start from desktop, nothing easier than that."

,Superdownloader,2011-04-03T18:32Z,Im only getting a black screen with background music. Whats an OPENGL PLUGIN like lynch said before? Do I need an extra program? HELP!
,autoprimephilippines,2011-04-04T16:25Z,"pefect..just downloaded it,some tweaks and there you go. i just wana ask colobocxxx6,everytime i open doors,there's a stutter..like hangin and dropping fps a bit..after that stutter,my fps drops from 30 to 22 and that cause the slow motion..if there's a tweak for this that you could tell me,i'll be glad to know it.its so cool that it looks like it was made for pc. thanks"
,T50Cal,2011-04-08T04:09Z,"Alright 

Step 1: Mount & Install
Step 2: Run Exe on Desktop


 It does not work, all that happens is vmware dialog box appears on the bottom right, and it implements fatal frame 4 in my processes (taskmanager).




@autoprimephilipphines  - What did you Tweak? am I suppose to be using Dolphin or something? cause as I saw the uploader simply said mount & install - click exe - sounds simple but I'm guessing there is more behind it?

Common someone anyone help, write a comment. support D: common!"
,T50Cal,2011-04-08T04:16Z,"Anyone who has gotten the game working, explain what you did.

Game still refuses to launch

Specs:
i7
GTX 460
4-gigs of ram
etc. etc. etc.

whats up why wont it start, what exactly do you have to tweak? why didn't you say what you tweaked D:?

o_o heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp :[ me :3"
,T50Cal,2011-04-27T14:58Z,"Alright, I decided to download another torrent and got the game to work. wEnglish Patch :D 

  I'm pretty disappointed in the support, I would not recommend anyone who is wanting to play fatal frame on dolphin. Id recommend gamerguy wiiscrubber torrent for dolphin. works good 30+FPS latest build.

How to shake it? thanks ^_~"
,timered23,2011-12-25T01:34Z,"This game runs perfectly in my com as well, HOWEVER I have the same problem as kaito_k. I shook my whole com and only these 2 words appear on the screen "" GAME OVER"""
,Ecto_Corvus,2012-01-13T16:34Z,Is this a ROM for the Wii emulator? I haven't seen anything proving this was released on PC
