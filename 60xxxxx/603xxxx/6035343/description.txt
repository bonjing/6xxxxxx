This book (1740) contains the most complete exposition of Hume's philosophy:


All knowledge comes from impressions and ideas.

Impressions are more forceful and lively than ideas.
 
There are no abstract general ideas.

Memory and imagination preserve and arrange our ideas of particular things.

We consider and communicate these ideas by the use of general terms.

Certainty relies on our intuition of similarity or difference among these ideas.

Our knowledge of causality is nothing more than a habit of expecting 

a sequence of events because of some previous occurence.

There is no necessary relationship between events.

We should remain skeptical about any conclusion reached by human reason.
