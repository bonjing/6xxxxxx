         This is the story of a disaster like no other. When Mount     
         Vesuvius erupted, it rained 8 million tons of debris          
         onto Pompeii it sealed the fate of more than a thousand       
         people. But it also sealed the city form the world:           
         preserved it, protected it, like nowhere else on earth,       
         the rediscovered Pompeii gives us access to the ancient       
         world. And now, with new findings and new insights, we can    
         tell the story of the ordinary people caught up in this       
         disaster. These are the forgotten men and women who lived     
          when Rome ruled....and were buried when the volcano blew.
