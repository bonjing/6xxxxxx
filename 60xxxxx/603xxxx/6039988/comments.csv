,CnC-FTW,2011-08-31T21:03Z,"Want to know how to play online?  Without the CRACK? I'll tell you...

1.) The game needs to be installed successfully and all that.
-------------------------------------------------------
2.) The generals.exe and game.dat have to be the originals [NOT THE CRACKS] so replace them.
-------------------------------------------------------
3.) You need a mini image you can download one here     

http://www.cncmaps.com/index.php?showtopic=4653

-------------------------------------------------------
4.) Once downloaded you need to mount this mini image to a virtual drive like you did to install the game.

-------------------------------------------------------55.) Once mounted, just run game through shortcut BAM your online

,CnC-FTW,2011-08-31T21:06Z,"I forgot to mention you need a valid online key (which I have...I'm not going to sell it.)

You can make a free gamespy account at gamespy.com all you need from there is valid cd keys.

If you buy the first decade those keys will work fine.

if you use Win 7/Vista:

Install the game as usual, download and install the latest patch.
Then navigate to your user data directory and create the folder:

C:\Users\XXXX\Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data
or
C:\Users\XXXX\Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data

inside the folder, you should create a file called ""options.ini"".
Add the following commands:

BuildingOcclusion = yes
DynamicLOD = yes
ExtraAnimations = yes
FirewallBehavior = 9
FirewallNeedToRefresh = FALSE
FirewallPortAllocationDelta = 0
GameSpyIPAddress = 0.0.0.0
Gamma = 50
HeatEffects = yes
IPAddress = 0.0.0.0
IdealStaticGameLOD = Low
LanguageFilter = false
MaxParticleCount = 5000
MusicVolume = 49
Resolution = 1680 1050
Retaliation = yes
SFX3DVolume = 64
SFXVolume = 57
ScrollFactor = 80
SendDelay = yes
ShowSoftWaterEdge = yes
ShowTrees = yes
StaticGameLOD = Custom
TextureReduction = 0
UseAlternateMouse = yes
UseCloudMap = yes
UseDoubleClickAttackMove = yes
UseLightMap = yes
UseShadowDecals = yes
UseShadowVolumes = yes
VoiceVolume = 70

To create a file (for all those who don't know) open up Notepad and simply copy and paste the information above into the file.  Then save the notepad file into the directory as ""options.ini"" without the quotations.  Start up your game and enjoy!  I'm not sure if compatibility mode effects anything, but I ran it without any of that nonsense (no admin privileges either)."
,AK-89,2011-12-27T07:33Z,Where are the serial keys?
,ahalsy,2012-01-28T19:48Z,i downloaded this game and it works perfectly but i have a problem with the game screen its not full screen and im trying everything and it isnt working im working on windows 7 64 bit 
,RogueTrooper7,2012-02-05T10:57Z,"IF THIS GAME DOSEN'T LOAD THEN DO THIS:

The way I fixed it was:

In 'My Documents' (usually at C:\users\YOURNAME\documents) there should be a folder named 'Command and Conquer Generals Data' or 'Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data', which was put there when you installed the game.  You need to create a text file using notepad and save it into this folder.  However, you must click 'save as' and change the type drop-down box  from text file (.txt) to 'all files'.  Then save the file as 'options.ini'

Before you save, paste this text into the file to get you started:

AntiAliasing = 1
BuildingOcclusion = yes
DrawScrollAnchor = 
DynamicLOD = no
ExtraAnimations = yes
GameSpyIPAddress = 0.0.0.0
Gamma = 50
IPAddress = 0.0.0.0
IdealStaticGameLOD = High
LanguageFilter = true
MaxParticleCount = 5000
MoveScrollAnchor = 
MusicVolume = 55
Resolution = 1024 768
Retaliation = yes
SFX3DVolume = 79
SFXVolume = 71
ScrollFactor = 50
SendDelay = no
ShowSoftWaterEdge = yes
ShowTrees = yes
StaticGameLOD = Custom
TextureReduction = 0
UseAlternateMouse = no
UseCloudMap = yes
UseDoubleClickAttackMove = no
UseLightMap = yes
UseShadowDecals = yes
UseShadowVolumes = yes
VoiceVolume = 100

This is simply how the game remembers what options you picked (music volume, brightness and the like) and  you can change them once the game is running using the options menu.

Now the key bits - firstly, make sure that you have full read/write permissions for the Command and Conquer Generals Data folder - do this by right clicking on the folder, then  properties then the security tab and change the permissions for all users.  It might also be worth making sure no files are ""Read-Only"" in that folder.

Then change the game's compatibility mode by right clicking on the game in the start menu, clicking on properties and then the Compatibility tab.  I used the ""Change settings for all users"" button at the bottom and changed to Windows XP (SP3), as well as checking the ""Run as administrator box"".

Hey presto! It worked, debunking the myth that C&C Generals will not run on 64 bit systems (as some people have been saying).  In fairness, I haven't tried online multiplayer yet, just a few skirmishes.

Good Luck!
THANX TO ABBEYHUNT"
