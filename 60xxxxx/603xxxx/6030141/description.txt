My requests/suggestions for episodes or web specials:
"The TSA Role in the Police State" (operating outside the 4th Amendment)
"Total Information Awareness" (in Europe see FP7, Project Indect and Adabts -
the Automatic Detection of Abnormal Behaviour and Threats in crowded Spaces,
which includes internet monitoring and audio/video surveillance drones in/over
cities)
"Economic Hitman / Privatizing Resources" (corporations and banks taking over
nations - ties in with the "World Wide Water Conspiracy")
"World Wide Mind" (all peoples minds linked together - human hive metality)
...and more...
