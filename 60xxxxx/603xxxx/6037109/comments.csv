,Revolver31,2011-02-05T02:07Z,ye plz on season 2 at 1080p 
,schniederzero,2011-03-03T23:52Z,any word on season 2 hd?
,CakeMonster,2011-03-05T15:59Z,I might do season 2 sometime in the future but it will be hard since it just like season 1 it is not available anywhere so you need to find each episode separately on the net and then merge them all into a complete season 
,Shoobox,2011-04-09T15:09Z,"not hard at all,
go to Ez-Tv and look for SW-TCW under shows.
they have all seasons up to date in HDTV"
,CakeMonster,2011-04-10T15:16Z,"What do you mean, eztv.it only has ""normal"" quality not 1080p, as far as I can see, anyway I will be seeding a 720p-1080p season 2 torrent very soon. I have almost completed it :)"
,dark_dice,2011-05-23T11:11Z,need seed!!!

,black_shadow_1981,2011-06-16T15:46Z,"i liked the 6 star wars films but never seen this show, im 30 years old will i still like this or is it really just for kids?

thanks"
,CakeMonster,2011-06-21T10:13Z,"This is for anyone who wants some nice action and sci fi and a splash of comedy, the show gets better by each season :)"
,williamballs,2011-09-03T04:53Z,"i know its a long shot, but i would love a torrent for season 2 that looks as consistently good as this one. the others just dont match up... 

great up, btw"
,remedio,2011-09-11T09:52Z,8 seeders 38 leechers?
,CakeMonster,2011-09-11T20:33Z,"There are actually way more Seeders and Leechers. The pirate bay listing is not accurate, download the torrent and launch the torrent and after 10 min you will see for yourself"
,sebee,2011-11-02T12:16Z,is it just me or is the season missing episodes from the start the opening shows previous battles on the first episode and as you continue through the series it seems like its missing other episodes showing past events yet you havent seen anything .. altho the quality is excelent
,spinweasel,2011-11-04T12:45Z,is this bluray or hdtv ?
,CakeMonster,2011-11-06T04:52Z,"@sebee

Check Imdb for full episode list, also there is a movie which you should watch before the first episode

@spinweasel Bluray"
,2luk3duk3,2012-01-15T15:51Z,"I'm seeding as much as I possibly can, others should do the same!"
,CakeMonster,2012-01-15T19:43Z,"@2luk3duk3

Nice ;)"
,Thieutje,2012-03-31T12:37Z,Are there english subtitles for these (which release has them already synched ? )
,CakeMonster,2012-04-01T21:37Z,"@Thieutje

All files are in english and have no subs

The movie might have several audio versions but atleast one is english

But maybe if you search the web you can find some"
,elgitar,2012-06-26T22:38Z,"Definitely seeding this, no matter how long it takes me to download it. Thanks for the torrent!"
