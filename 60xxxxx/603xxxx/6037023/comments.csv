,inferna_hermit,2010-12-13T20:04Z,does it need patch #1 ?
,inferna_hermit,2010-12-13T20:05Z,and thanks for uploading
,loongear,2010-12-13T22:02Z,"Could someone test and write the results here? To me, this game has been stillborn but I would still like to see if I will enjoy it or not when performance is not an issue."
,GMDFUCKU,2010-12-14T00:52Z,I tried this shit and it makes the game crash after 5 secs of being at the menu. pure fucking junk
,GMDFUCKU,2010-12-14T04:38Z,so i reinstalled. same thing.
,attattatt,2010-12-14T15:02Z,"Delete the leftover savegame directory with the savegames and settings (unusable anyway), it will work."
[T],Coolguy33,2010-12-14T21:54Z,After a few tries i can get the gme to run as administrator.
[T],Coolguy33,2010-12-14T22:01Z,"My bad, i can't. It's the old exe 1.0 that is working.  :("
,kaliver,2010-12-14T22:36Z,"yep, works on my reloaded version fine. didn't have to reinstall or anything, just deleted my save files and settings, installed the patch and copied over the dll files. i backed up everything just in case but it appears to work.

and at release i allowed the release date check to go through but cancelled directly after that finished. afaik that's required and it doesn't do anything but confirm that it's ok to play the game."
,Binky66,2010-12-15T10:45Z,"I did everything said here, I even removed all entries in the registry and reinstalled, but it still wants to go online and activate. So it doesn't work. Atleast for me."
,viperstrikes,2010-12-15T14:06Z,"Ok so what I did was.
1 Deleted the saved games.
2 uninstalled the game.
3 Reinstalled and did the release check 
4 Copied the crack which by the way only had .dll files and no .exe
5 tried to run the game using the shortcut on desktop as well as the updated .exe version 1.1.0.1433.
6. It askls for the serial number for online activation.
I don't think you can do it any other way. This release sucks big time.Any explanations."
,overhax,2010-12-15T15:02Z,Block Arcania.exe with firewall
,viperstrikes,2010-12-15T15:27Z,"@P2P4L1f3 your response is very encouraging. So according to you the only thing which is messing it is the registry entries. Ok I will try to remove the entries. Also, tell me which OS you are using,I'm using x64 vista sp2."
,viperstrikes,2010-12-15T16:44Z,I emptied the registrty and deleted everything that goes by the name of arcania gothic 4. Still not working. By the way did u use any exe crack other than these dll files
,vinpirate,2010-12-15T17:35Z,"well this work, 
install this on top of the skidrow release 
B4 u play disconect from internet will do the trick"
,jookkor,2010-12-17T23:44Z,"Works perfectly, no pre-patching required. I installed clean from Iso (I used Reloaded)  opened the Iso and ran the directx setup blocked the arcania.exe on my firewall, ran it, cancelled it, installed the skidrow patch, copied skidrow's Dll's into the main directory and now it works absolutely perfectly. 
I've tested playing and saving/loading as that was an issue with some previous cracks. No problems here at all.

My only complaint is that within the game itself I can not seem to beat my ugly girlfriend to death with my sheperd's crook. But that is not the fault of this crack.
You guys with problems make sure to run that dxsetup on the iso in the support/directx folder. You may need to update your physX as well which is found in the support folder.

Thank you for the upload."
,kaliver,2010-12-18T01:22Z,"i ran into a snag with my already-cracked version. could i trouble anyone to upload their data0.pak from a clean install? i suspect that reloaded's version is what's wrong, and i stupidly forgot to back it up before overwriting. if someone wouldn't mind throwing it on one of the file services i'd be very grateful, thanks. i don't really want to download 7 gigs just for the 200mb file if i can avoid it, heh."
,newmouse,2010-12-19T02:45Z,"Empty your save game folder of all files 
or it won't install on a game that has been played.

Need to start a new game @@@"
,kaliver,2010-12-19T23:21Z,"Well if you're like me and cracked the game at release and deleted your ISO, the SKIDROW update will break your game after tutorial island. It would appear it's because of data0.pak, as the rain distortion is fixed now that I've replaced it with the original. I had to re-dl the whole game again and figured if anyone was in the same situation as me they'd appreciate only having a 200mb dl, so here you go: ti.ny.u.rl com  fixarc

^ you'll have to fix the URL yourself.

Just drop it in your data folder like you did with the old reloaded crack."
,The_Countess,2010-12-20T19:44Z,"got it working.

i uninstalled the game using both uninstalls i had in my install folder.
then deleted the whole folder.
i then reinstalled the game using the iso that came with the reloaded release.
i DIDN'T use their crack.
-i tried to install patch2. and got the error.
-started Arcania.exe. let it install securom and then cancelled.
patch2 then installed properly.
copied the skidrow crack into the game folder.
tried to start. it crashed.
deleted the ghotic4 folder in my documents
started game, and it works."
,loongear,2010-12-30T16:15Z,Good god! I can see that the patch worked but why won't someone tell me if it cures the damn graphic lag or not? This is all I want to know!
,e666,2011-03-13T17:57Z,"thanks for this
cheers"
