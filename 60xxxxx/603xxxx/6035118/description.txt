                    Film version of director Rupert Goold's  
                    highly-acclaimed production of Macbeth,  
                    originally staged by Chichester Festival  
                    Theatre and later a sell-out hit in the West  
                    End and on Broadway. Shot on location in the  
                    mysterious underground world of Welbeck Abbey  
                    in Nottinghamshire, the film is set in an  
                    undefined and threatening central European  
                    world. Immediate and visceral, this is a  
                    contemporary presentation of Shakespeare's  
                    intense, claustrophobic and bloody drama.
