,Ludee,2011-03-22T23:13Z,"I can't really see the usage.. 
Even if there's any book you would want in there, it would be impossible to find it O.o"
,p00p3don,2011-03-31T15:25Z,"if you can't see the ""usage"" of quality non-fiction books, you're an idiot with a small brain, and little or no education or imagination.  congratulations on being a dumb ass - if I were you, i'd just kill myself and get it over with...."
,Luckfest,2011-04-17T12:18Z,"Ludee, if you use a email book manager called Calibre (which is free) you can find any book in a jiffy.. I am using it and have more than 4000 books and I can find any book I want with the tag.. and to Mandarp, it might be useless to you.. but for some of us, it is God sent. Thanks a lot to the uploader"

,wretchedcongregation,2011-06-09T22:11Z,"This is far from useless. This is great.
I guess some people would just rather be happy in their stupidity and ignorance than actually learn anything, though."
,Ardeet,2011-06-28T10:46Z,"Thanks very much for this upload. There's some up to date, useful sources of knowledge here."

Unfortunately, piratebay is becoming infested with wankers like these who think that because they've been on ebay they are now computer savvy!

Stop tossing off at all the online porn and learn what computers and the internet can do for you.

Nobody would really want all the books in the list. Just download the torrent and when you put it into your utorrent or equivalent program just select the books you want for downloading.

Oh yeah....I forgot you trolls have got screwed-up eyes and sticky fingers.....in that case, just piss off!

Thanks to anonymous for 1: Having the time & inclination to compile these e-books and 2: Taking the time to upload. 
Much appreciated."

Many, many thanks for this upload."
