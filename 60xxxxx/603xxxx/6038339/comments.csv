I don't ever have that kind of time on my hands. I do however have time to watch this show - intro and all. It only takes about 45 minutes and is never a waste of energy or thought. There are those who claim that television-watching causes Alzheimer's disease, but to them I say right AND left key. I don't ever have hat kind of time on my hands. I do however have time to watch this show. It's pretty awesome. Pineapple."

I guess people don't understand the point of them, so let me explain- say you have an 8 gig iso, one big file, takes a day to downlaod. If for some reason a bit of the data gets screwed up on it's way to you, you just wasted a whole day of downloading, and need to download the whole 8 gig's again. Now with a split rar, it takes the same amount of time to download, but in this case if a piece gets messed up, you just need to re-download that smaller 500 mb(or whatever) file again to get it working properly. Don't have to wait all day again.

Saying they are pointless, or dumb, just shows ignorance on the user. How hard is it to click on one file? You do the same with non split rars."
