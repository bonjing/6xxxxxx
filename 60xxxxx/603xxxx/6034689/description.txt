Adam Carolla & Dr. Drew in mid 2001.  I will seed this for a while and see how it does.  I have about 250 some episodes total.   Thanks to the Aceman from Lovelinearchives.com. Unfortunatly the site was shut down.  

This includes 28 episodes.  Would love it if others could take over the seeding in a while and I can upload more of my collection.  (My available hard drive is quite small at the moment...  Thanks TPB) 

Enjoy when music is not doing it. Great for listing to at Boring Jobs.

MP3 audio / all shows an hour and half.
