,tron62,2011-04-23T20:03Z,"First you should google utorrent, then download utorrent and save it to your pc, it is only small in size, and the best torrent program, in my opinion, if you are lucky it should without you having to configure your router, it will ask if you want an exception in windows firewall, check the box and that sould be it, I will check back regulary, so if you any problems just ask, depending on your internet speed, you will need to have your download upload ratio set correctly get the best speed possible, hope this helps, it it does let me know, Cheers. Mark"

,tron62,2011-04-23T20:07Z,"download this program, utorrent,  run the program and thats it, need more info let me know."
,tron62,2011-04-23T20:12Z,"download the program called utorrent, is easy to install and only tiny in size, but great program."
,tron62,2011-04-23T20:24Z,"ray91666, these are avi files, I dont know anything about macs, but on a pc, you would use divx player vlc, flv,? however I do not know if these programs will work on a mac, also power dvd? "
,faheyd,2011-04-25T19:20Z,"@ray I'm pretty sure VLC has a mac client.

Also, for all, (not debating you on stuff), get peerblock and use it in addition to utorrent."
