,Notor1ous,2011-01-05T06:38Z,"Just 3 and a half weeks to go!

This is taking too long, i could have every episode downloaded today by downloading single episodes."
,Notor1ous,2011-01-06T19:33Z,Download finally completed with an elapsed time of exactly 2 days.
,THE_SK1TZ,2011-01-06T20:38Z,There is way to many Peers people. Please seed! Its not to much to ask. At least seed for an hour. If everyone does it for an hour it should be ok. I dont why people need to be so greedy. If you can leech you can seed as well.
,Sten1972,2011-03-28T15:55Z,Great quality! Does anyone know where to find english subs for episode 12?

,CometGO,2011-05-31T04:09Z,I like how no one mentions that Showtime is tracking ip addresses through this torrent. This season isn't even worth a C&D order.
,Sobchak,2011-09-05T22:17Z,Does anyone have a link for the e12 subs please?
