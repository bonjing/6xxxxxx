,mbisdagame1,2010-12-13T14:16Z,"Lol @ broke negros complaining: The is an HD torrent, for real men who have nice tvs and good internet."
,Joker-Face,2010-12-13T16:57Z,"@mbisdagame1:  Stop whining, everyone knows 1.46 is a large torrent and highly unorthodox. I'm willing to bet you deleted it to download a smaller file, with the exact same quality. So stfu and stop being a hypocrite. "
,SergeantSpoon,2010-12-13T19:38Z,"Lol @ mbisdagame1.

I'm a negro with a 50inch Full HD TV. ^^
This Torrent is awesome! 

All I wanted to say, bye."
,KhaosGT,2010-12-14T02:48Z,"mbisdagame1 Has a point in a way... 1.46gb is not bad for a 720p HD Version.  With good internet/seeders it dl's quick anyway, so stop complaining and APPRECIATE! :)

Thx btw"
