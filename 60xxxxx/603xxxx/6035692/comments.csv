,sdhzoaat,2011-04-06T03:16Z,@ thecarters1228.... you suck!!!!
,Nebulosss,2011-05-04T15:33Z,"The quality of this torrent is great, but there is something wrong with the torrent. I have my upload set to 150 kb/s but the number jumps allot. Also the download speed is never constant.... And the average is about 50 kb/s...."
,pirat3bay,2011-05-28T04:05Z,"Argh, Rita (girlfriend) was fine through 1,2 season. At Season3 I actually wished Dexter could just SHUT HER UP, or should I say SHUT HER DOWN..."
,pirat3bay,2011-05-28T04:06Z,@Ph3l0n:  and how do you know that??

,kevijay,2011-07-18T20:11Z,no-one using peergaurdian anymore??? I've never had a e-mail from anyone i download shitloads
,holyguitar90,2011-07-22T02:59Z,"it doesnt matter if u run peer blocker or something like that. to under to scan ips/block them u need to no what ones are tracking you. and that just cant be done. with running a normal torrent. plus the people that do track, there ips are always channging. what i am saying is. it just really pointless to download something that will protect you from outdated ips. (if u removed bad trackers) better said trackers with low seed/leechers. and u dont seed. ur chances of not getting caught went up 95%. other words peerblocker/and so on, arent really needed. and do little to help from the start.

,chubi3,2011-08-20T18:57Z,DONT DOWNLOAD! THIS TORRENT IS BEING TRACKED! JUST GOT EMAIL FROM ISP TELLING TO DELETE!

,guest29,2011-09-03T06:05Z,been downloading for 2 days and only at 7.3% why is this torrent so slow?
,StanlyManly,2011-10-06T07:52Z,Thank you very much for the upload.  Downloaded very quick and ran perfect on a PS3.  Video and Audio were just about as good as it can get.  Thanks again.
,altonina,2011-10-12T02:38Z,"Thanks so much. Though I only peeked at E01, the quality seems fine w/ A/V in sync. Idk if it was the S/L ratio or light traffic on my network, but this was the fastest torrent I ever downloaded, w/ a rate of at least 250 kB/s. I will keep seeding."
