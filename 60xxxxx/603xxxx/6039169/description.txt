BEN WEBSTER PLAYS DUKE ELLINGTON
Label:Storyville
Format:Flac

This CD is a collection of classic melodies from the repertoire of Ben Websterâ€™s famous employer of many years, Duke Ellington. The CD is compromised of three live radio sessions with the Danish Radio Big Band In 1969 & 1971, plus three live concert sessions with three different backing-trios (Finland in 1967, Denmark in 1969 and Sweden in 1972). Two of the tracks â€“ with Clark Terry, Kenny Drew, Red Mitchell and Bobby Brooks â€“ are previously unissued. Aside from one tune. All the performances with the Danish Radio Big Band are Based on Ellingtonâ€™s original scores. The quartet sessions are also great, including two â€œreunionsâ€ â€“ one with Benâ€™s boss from the early 30â€™s, Teddy Wilson, and the other with fellow Ellington alumnus Clark Terry. That Ben Webster was one of the undisputed jazz-greats on the tenorsaxophone- both in a big band and small group context
