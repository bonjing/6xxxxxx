,bzeboymenz,2010-12-20T01:30Z,"Come on guys, please seed the torrent.  I'm trying for 4 days now.  This DVD is really needed.  Thanks.  I will appreciate it."
,bzeboymenz,2010-12-20T01:41Z,"klebel, can you send me the files through http://www.filedropper.com/ so I can help to seed this file?"
,jyh3,2010-12-24T01:16Z,"It's been nearly 10 days and there has been no seeder. This ""Klebel"" fella apparently isn't comin' back. I say we call this dead. How Disappointing..."

,nononononono,2011-01-14T13:46Z,"Works perfectly on my 2007 550i

Seeding for over a week now - get it while it lasts!"
,biggs0007,2011-02-21T07:10Z,"klebel or nononononono do you simply burn the wrar .iso file as an image? Or did you have to first unzip it, and then burn?

In a nutshell what exactly are you suppose to do with these downloaded files to get things to work?

Thanks..."

,biggs0007,2011-02-21T08:47Z,Figured it out and worked like a charm. Thanks
,meb99,2011-02-24T05:51Z,"biggs0007, how did you burn it, new to this as well and need help! on a mac here also, does that make a difference?"
,Phasers,2011-02-28T18:32Z,"Worked great in a 2006 e60 (5 series) with iDrive. Took a few min to update the software then everything was normal.

Only thing is I burned on Memorex DVD+R at 4x with IMGBurn and sometimes I get a disc read error. I plan on reburning at 2x on a computer with a slower burner as this should fix it."
,sinx5,2011-06-22T23:07Z,"Hey guys. I burned it with Nero at 1X, and the system does not recognize it. I have a 2009 X5 35d, and from what I have read on forums this should be the right version. Any suggestions?"
,auiya,2011-08-15T17:15Z,"This does NOT work for the e85 Z4 m roadster, and probably other models of e85.  "
,sonnyforellie,2011-08-31T06:12Z,Has any one tried this for 2008 328XI.  I can't seem to get this to work...any suggestions!!!!
,sonnyforellie,2011-08-31T06:18Z,Has anyone tried this on 325XI.  Ican't seem to get this to work..PLEASE HELP!
,tumberi,2011-09-20T06:45Z,Tried on 2008 x5. It works but keep getting Disc Read error. I might have to try burning it in lower speed than 4x.
,bropane,2011-10-16T20:17Z,"For everyone having trouble getting this to work, when you burn the image change the book type of your disc to dvd-rom. I did some research on how to get burnt navigation discs to work and when I burned my dvd+r into dvd-rom I was able to get my mkIV computer to recognize that it was indeed a navigation disc. Sadly though the professional map dvds aren't for the mkIV so they still didn't work but I believe that if you guys did this they would work for you."
,shroomer33,2011-10-24T06:09Z,"This didn't work on my 2006 330cic convertible.  The torrent also didn't claim to work on my car, so I'm not upset.  What DID work with my car is this:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5669001/BMW_2010_North_America_Nav_High_pamber_65-90-2-158-157_%5BPresto%5D

Try that out if you have an E46 or a BMW not listed above."
