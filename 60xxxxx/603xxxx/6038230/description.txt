This is a collection of different files I have found that happen to work for me.
I did this because nothing else worked. I take no credit for the files/cracks, 
only in putting them in one lovely place.




1. Install Sims 3

*** EDITED HERE ***
*** PLEASE READ ***

I had realized that the instructions I provided are not 100% correct. 
Be sure to download this update from the Sims Wiki patch-archive.

        http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe

        Update to 1.15.xxx   (NOT 1.18.xxx as initially indicated)
	
2. Install Downloadable Content
	Copy 'Documents' folder to C:\Users\%username%\
	Install the two neighborhoods

3. Install High-End
	Update

4. Install Wolrd Adventures
	Update

5. Install Ambitions
	DON'T UPDATE, INSTALL FASTLANE FIRST

6. Install FastLane
	Update Ambitions and then FastLanes

*** EDITED HERE ***
*** PLEASE READ ***

        The update provided in the torrent for FastLanes is the wrong patch.
Follow the link provided to apply the propper patch. 
http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/Sims3_5.4.4.009001_from_5.0.44.008001.exe

Following this step, update the Base Game to 1.18, from its current 1.15.
If you do not update, you will not be able to install Late Night.

7. Install Late Night
	Update

8. Apply No-CD Late Night crack, and play
       	Back up originals before applying cracks
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\The Sims 3 Late Night\Game\Bin	
	(Crack tells you that it is an unoffical mod that may cause bugs. Hit continue)

9. Use the cracked TS3EP03.exe to play! Enjoy it for free!



Sorry about the edits on step 1 and step 6, I thought I had it all perfected before I packed it, but I hope this all helps.
I also realized my disc 2 and 3 are mislabeled. (Disc 2 is called World Adventures and is actually High-End Loft Stuff, vice-versa)
Just follow them in the order they are numbered. That is what works.
