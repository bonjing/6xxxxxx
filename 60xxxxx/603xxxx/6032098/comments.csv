Superb, and thank you, istrahd!"

We are all greatly indebted to you for processing these audiobooks into torrent files.  I hope many people discover the fascinating historical and psychological writing in these books

10-14 years ago I devoured the full series, stopping at the 20th book.  I had been introduced to O'brian's work with an audio cassette of ""Master And Commander,"" read by an English actor named Richard Brown, and eagerly went from that to the paperbacks.  Now preparing for some long-distance driving I was happy to find the last few books available in mp3. (And I'll be sure to seed them.)

Thanks again for offering this prize."
