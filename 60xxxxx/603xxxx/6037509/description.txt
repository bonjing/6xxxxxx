Magica started in February 2002 as a project of Bogdan Costea, guitarist (at that time) of a local gothic metal band, Interitus Dei. The reason for starting this band was Bogdan's desire to play the music that he likes: heavy metal & melodic rock
The recordings for the 1st album (having more of a demo purpose) started in spring 2002. After two months of intense work, the material was ready. Twelve power melodic heavy metal songs, in the vein of Rhapsody, Nightwish and Helloween, which show the high potential of the band. The album, entitled "The Scroll of Stone", tells the story of princess Alma tricked by a demon, she loses her soul and so her quest begins. She has to find The Scroll of Stone, the only thing powerful enough to break the demon's spell. "The Scroll of Stone" was produced in Romania by Sigma Records and was well received by the media, in spite of the lack of promotion. The second album, "Lightseeker", has been launched in October 2004 in France through Underclass Music. Magica's first video, "Bittersweet Nightshade", was ready on February 10, 2005. Magica has been featured in the famous "Metallian" and "Rock Hard Magazine". In 2006 the band had the pleasure of touring Europe opening for After Forever and Nightmare, Apocalyptica and Leaves Eyes.

The third album is called Hereafter and was released at 19 October 2007 via AFM Records Germany. 2 videos were shot for this album, " All waters have the colour of drowning" and "Entangled". In November 2007 Ana was invited to take part in the huge Hellish Rock tour alongside Helloween, Gamma Ray and Axxis for 3 months of intense touring.

The band's latest release is called "Wolves and Witches" and was released through AFM Records in October 2008, the band is currently in search of a serious booking agency.
