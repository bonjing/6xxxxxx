,ozcarp92,2010-12-31T10:32Z,"@Leviathan6969 this torrent works perfeclty and the patch named ""WoW-3.2.0"" takes you from 3.xx to 3.2.0"
,snake1250,2011-01-03T05:38Z,Thanks for this torrent. Its exactly what I needed.
,Jahrvat,2011-01-29T00:13Z,It works TNx a lot \m/
,Webberjo,2011-01-30T08:15Z,"""WoW-3.2.0"" takes a while to start. Give it a min to load; just 'cause it doesn't pop up instantly doesn't mean it doesn't work."
,Djoxy96,2011-02-11T18:59Z,"Thanx, perfect thing for private servers!!!"
,s0rrow,2011-06-30T20:09Z,does this work for mac?

,Ouriel123,2011-09-26T15:34Z,Does this work on the EU version of the game?
,Novelisk,2011-11-09T07:43Z,"Can you not read, dumbass?  it clearly says in EACH filename enUS, so no, it won't work on the EU version of the game.  "
,promade,2011-11-13T19:36Z,"3.2.0 took 7 minutes to load lol, and i was afraid of getting an error during it (because it's the biggest file, and it needs the most time to update), but.......i have to say......that.....  EVERYTHING WORKS FUCKING PERFECTLY ! :) I can't thank enough for the upload, i can't find a torrent which includes all the patches, only shit torrents,  thank you very much, i keep seeding"
,CyberBandit,2012-05-23T10:49Z,"Excellent :)
1.5 mbps download ;)"
,kevalalajnen,2012-06-19T13:01Z,"I'm pretty sure this works on the EU client too. You just won't be able to log on to the EU servers, but you can't do that with 3.3.5a anyway."
