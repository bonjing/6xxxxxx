Each book has been individually compressed into rar files, split at 3.5MB for the couple I've checked.

So each book is already unnecessarily split into tiny segments.

Then, each of these rar files is packed into a zip archive with NFO and SFV files.

Then, each book is in its own directory, along with more NFO and SFV files.

It's going to take me half an hour just to decompress these damned things.
I'm assuming each RAR archive will also have NFO and SFV files - I'll know when it's all downloaded - so I'll have 5 times as many of these files as books.

AAAARRRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!

FYI:  ZIPing a RAR file doesn't compress it any more, dammit!!  Neither does RARing a ZIP.

It would be pretty easy to write a script to do all the archiving, but what's the point?  It just makes it a pain in the ass for downloaders to unarchive.

Now that my rant is over:
This looks like a pretty good collection.  I am actually glad/thankful it was posted, but lay off the archivers, for crying out loud!"
