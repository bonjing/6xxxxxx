,azrielle,2010-12-13T04:34Z,"Do you get Royal Pains, by any chance?  2nd season should be coming up, 1st season is a lost cause, probably.  Many thanks, too many items to mention."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-13T07:06Z,"@Nemona: Somebody asked that already in July, and I uploaded all my White Collar encodings to MU. I can send you direct links as an reply to your e-mail. My address is in LONG torrent header almost every day. Just click on my screen-name and on one of the recent torrents of mine.

@azrielle: Sorry, just the pilot episode of Royal Pains was good. After that I endured few eps, then dropped it forever."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-13T07:56Z,"@dark_defender: Do not make me sorry for fulfilling your request (just uploaded to seeding server).
Do NOT do that anymore, you should wait would I answer or not - then act as you wish.

It is MISUSE and it is called ""advertising of other torrents"" on one uploader's thread.

Please."
,dark_defender,2010-12-13T09:13Z,"@twentyforty: I am sorry man dint know the rules. I dint think in that fashion but i should have. I am no way acquainted with that uploader and such thing wont be repeated.

I cant find a way to delete or edit my comments. Can you tell me how to, so that i can delete it?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-13T10:35Z,"Righty... BTW, comments cannot be edited."
,dark_defender,2010-12-13T11:27Z,"Then i will make sure i don't need to, in future."
,jon4fun,2010-12-13T11:51Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

@ ALL - Please LOGIN (create an account if you do not have one) and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents you DL from 20-40. 
It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated for the genius that it is!

Cheers
Jon"
