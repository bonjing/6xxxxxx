"Road to the North Pole Pt I and II"

Stewie's favorite thing after his teddy bear, 
Rupert, is Christmas. So when he hears that 
Santa is making an appearance at the mall, he 
begs Brian to take him so that he can tell 
Santa in person what he wants for Christmas. 
Brian begrudgingly takes Stewie to the mall, 
only to get the brush-off from Santa. As a 
result, Stewie and Brian travel to the North 
Pole to find Santa and teach him a lesson in 
holiday cheer.

Enjoy
