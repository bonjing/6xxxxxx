,Ste-360,2011-01-13T22:39Z,"Ok guys, i was just wondering if somebody could shed a little light on my problem. This is the first time i have downloaded a 360 game so i went on you tube done a little research. I have a modded xbox 360 Hitatchi drive plays coppied games no problems. I downloaded the file extracted it applied the new patch with ppf-o-matic3 to get away from the ap25. I then ran it in abgx360 level 3 showing no faults atall. I then burned the iso in ImgBurn at 2.4x on layer 1913760 using Verbatim dual layer dvd's. When i put the game into the 360 i get a play game with no picture of acb when i click play it says the disc is unreadable. I have updated the xbox 360 to the new version via flash drive but still no joy. Any ideas ? Much appreciated!"
,cool0,2011-01-14T05:13Z,"Might have been my fault, but the game freezes at the loading logo every time. I even burned the disk twice to see If It was IMGburn. nope. there goes $1.50 down the drain. I'm trying a diff torrent now will see what happens after it finishes."
