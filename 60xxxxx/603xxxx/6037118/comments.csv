,Arcane_Ether,2011-01-25T19:23Z,"I've been a happy user of old Nero 7 Ultimate for years, no problems there.

I tried to install Nero 7 to my friend's computer, running Windows 7, no go. Not compatible.

So I Torrented this Nero 9. Install went fine; the Torrent, crack and program all work well.

However!

Nero 9 has a a painfully long install, sloppy and confusing layout, and doesn't come with an Image Mounter for ISOs and BINs.

Bad Nero! Go to your room!"
,Sgr76,2011-01-26T06:13Z,"100% NOT WORKING!!!

Even after you delete ""NeroPatentActivation"" the program will still try to force it. Failure to comply will result in your disc not being big enough to burn the project. "
,nourddine84,2011-07-08T14:18Z,"it takes forever to install hahahaha
