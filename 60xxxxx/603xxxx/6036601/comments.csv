First of all I cannot identify the file format and when I try to use the media player it comes up with an error message ""Unable to play this file"" It then says the file is a undf type file Wotsup Thingy as this only happens on some of your brilliant stuff. You rock man but I need help in this respect PLEASE!!!!"
,maelyna,2012-06-07T07:22Z,"Great tutorial, but the video freezes ALL THE DAMN TIME. Can you re-upload the videos? There are several times where I can't follow them because the video is still showing the first frame but the guy is typing and clicking everywhere and not being very descriptive. Makes it really hard to learn when you can't see what you are supposed to be doing."
