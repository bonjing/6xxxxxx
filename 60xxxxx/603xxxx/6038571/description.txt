K. Flay, Suburban Rap Queen
4.2 stars out of 5

This is a very solid album; for a dorm-room-recorded debut from a 'green' MC, it's amazing. That's how I am with DIY and indie stuff: it still has to bring it.
Th beats are apparently self-produced, but they don't quite have the obnoxious feel that often plagues such things.

Track 1 is an intro I don't have

Track 2 - Suburban Rap Queen
* Great title track, and great title for this non-male non-urban rapper

Track 3 - Not Gonna Happen
* A crisp 'I've had enough' statement apparently aimed at a manipulative friend.

Track 4 - The Whoosie Song
* Maybe a few messages, but mainly works as a fast upbeat track. (Track 7, How I'm Rockin', is also a party.) "Damn..." backing vocal repeated a bit.

Track 5 - Hey Ladies
* Understandably has had enough of sexism, particularly in the rap industry. Track 11 (Frat Party) takes similar aim at the louts at certain parties. "I will stimulate your brain, not your dick, you idiot."

Track 6 - Red Meat
* Ironically not ranting against female objectification, but rather a really funny track ranting in favor of literal red meat. The omnivore in me is quite amused by this non-vegetarian anthem. :)

Track 8 - Bang Bang
* Straightforward anti-imperialism cut

Track 9 - Saved and Track 10 - Drama
* These couple of serious slow tracks admittedly feel amongst the album's low points.

Track 12 - I See The World
* A fairly haunting and powerful track about her world compares to the harsh environment that was rap's original incubator.

Track 13 - Time Stops
"Time Stops for no one, and you're one of millions"
