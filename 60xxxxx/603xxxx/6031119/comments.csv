[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T17:49Z,It would make sense to include this tracker in your uploads udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com/announce
[V],BOZX,2010-12-11T18:00Z,"if u r aware how TPB works...u won't ask for this ...
its added by default.... from TPB... and for the rest of others not from TPB there is exodus and publicbt which scrape the same..."
[V],-jonny-,2010-12-11T18:36Z,"No, bozx, they are different trackers."
[V],BOZX,2010-12-11T20:10Z,"ok nxt time i will add  but truely i don't beliv in openbittorrent...tracker keep failind quite often...

[V],-jonny-,2010-12-12T00:19Z,"I don't want you to do anything, bozx."
