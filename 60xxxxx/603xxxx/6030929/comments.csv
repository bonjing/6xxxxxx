You made my day!...."
,brianxxx,2010-12-22T18:50Z,"Love it. Thanks. But in the future, I would recommend the 'sceners' out there bundle this with the Plus Pack. It is basically a necessity.

I have the Acronis Corp 10 version but it does not offer full SSD support. Fuck you very much Acronis for dicking me after spending money on CORP level products! They say version 11 will have full SSD support. Too little too late so I am jacking the HOME version here for free ya bitches!!!!!!!!!!!! lol"

,chicken-,2011-01-29T21:56Z,brianxxx so you're blaming Acronis for you're ignorance in not reading what the program supported before purchasing it?
,chicken-,2011-01-29T21:58Z,"thanks for the updated version, every time I go to use this piece of crap it stops working.  Just tried loading version 5105 which worked fine after install and it freezes as soon as you click anything just like every other version.  Acronis makes buggy crap but when it works it's handy...

brianxxx - try reading the supported features of programs before buying them and then blaming Acronis for your lack of research."
,chicken-,2011-01-29T22:03Z,"How about not raring the damn torrent so we don't have to download the whole damn thing just to get the serial?  It's free to download the trial on Acronis site, I wish uploaders would stop being newbies."

,jargij,2011-06-12T01:07Z,"the serial is... almost there.... 100%

,below90hz,2011-07-17T02:43Z,"dudes back off of Brianxxx. I know exactly how he feels, you would think by 2010 a company whose whole business is based on hard drives would have SSD support by default.

So don't try and act like you never bought something only to find it lacked a key requirement you hadn't thought to check before purchasing. We've all been there, so your can check your condescending attitudes at the welcome page."
