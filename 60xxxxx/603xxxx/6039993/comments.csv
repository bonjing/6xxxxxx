,omc1977,2010-12-14T20:30Z,For some reason I was unable to unpack the installation file. I did however download this EXACT version from the manufactures website and used the product keys provided in the torrent. They worked like a charm. I did disconnect from the internet during the whole process and did not turn on the net again until process complete. Very easy. Either way you helped me out and just wanted to say thanks!

,Nocturnal_love,2010-12-30T02:29Z,"Okay, I absolutely love this program but I am running into an issue. I burned a film to a DVD-R and tried to play it on my Dvd Player. It will not play it. It states that it maybe a non-playback DVD?

I have run into this issue before. Any thoughts on what I am doing wrong? "
,xtremality,2010-12-30T06:38Z,How Fast does it convert AVI to DVD?
,BloFish,2011-01-01T11:27Z,"Mr ChattChitto
your ups are very appreciated. I also enjoy the music you add to them, but it would be nice to know who the artist is. Could you include the artist name or song in your splash? thanks again for your ups"
,BloFish,2011-01-01T13:21Z,"@xtremality

some can take up to an hour"
,theoriginalphantom,2011-01-03T18:15Z,"@xtremality
As BloFish said some can take upto an hour but in the main it takes about 20 to 25 mins.
CC thanks again for your ups mate, quality as usual."
,ps3_4_eva,2011-01-09T20:00Z,"whenever I convert I either have no audio or nothing on the DVD whatsoever? haven't tried DVD-R's just DVD-RW's, is this the problem?"
,djamirku,2011-01-09T20:57Z,thanks man work nice
,BloFish,2011-01-12T22:30Z,"Found out you can open the file using WinRar and you can see whats inside. 
Mr ChattChitto, Im not trying to mess with your file, just wanted to know the name of the song is all. 
I thank you for all your ups and you are deeply appreciated and respected, here and abroad...
I wish you a joyous and prosperous new year!"
