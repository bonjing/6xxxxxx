,UltraLame123,2012-02-19T12:25Z,"this torrrent is fast as hell,goes sometimes twice as fast as my connection allows,imma listen to it now :D"
,MyWallet,2012-03-19T02:31Z,"I'll tell you the truth on this torrent guys. 

It's missing stuff from EPs and albums. Most of the EPs/albums/compilations on here only have one song and are missing the others.

Everything is mistagged/not tagged at all. There are MANY automatically added tags and artwork from beatport, dubjunks, and other sites.

But if you're simply looking for a mass of music from Datsik and Excision, just download this and move them into one huge album.

With a bit of research, you can use the files on this torrent to find and download other complete versions of everything on here."
