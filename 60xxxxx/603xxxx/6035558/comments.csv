,mortarupload,2010-12-14T02:42Z,"actually, source was a russian dvd. WB has always rarely released R5s and when they do they always lack quality. I over touched the darkness on this accidentally. Please when you leave comments consider that."
,mortarupload,2010-12-14T04:22Z,Talked to my source. This is a PPVrip. From a hotel in russia. And i have mislabeled it R5. Because it was a russian rip. Ok? Sorry for the inconvienience
