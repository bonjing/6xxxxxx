,Dhodg83,2011-02-21T06:51Z,"Dude what do I do with the files and the patch and stuff
PLease respond"
,cornelius007,2011-07-11T12:49Z,"it doesn't work,it requires original cd to start game."
,1336plus1,2011-07-26T19:04Z,"STEP 1: Mount the IMG file and run autorun.exe. Install the game like usual.

STEP 2: Run the v1.04 patch.exe

STEP 3: Open the crack folder in WinRAR. Extract patch-104.exe to the GameData folder in the install directory. (Where jk2sp.exe is). Run the patch-104.exe. This will patch the game to run without a disk or cd key.

STEP 4: Play!"
,halebopsux,2011-08-20T19:25Z,Thank you very much!! Works awesome :D But I've come pretty far into the game now and when I try to save it says in the corner of the screen that it saves as usually. But if I delete old saves it works fine to save. Any ideas how to get this to work perfectly? Otherwise this torrent is AWESOME! Download it and seed! :)

Sry for double comment but I wrote a bit wrong in the first :P"
,iikySticky420,2011-09-18T11:02Z,2.0+ download speed great so far letyou know if it works!
,Daemonseek3r,2011-09-28T06:06Z,"So mine says I need to burn disc image. But I shouldn't need to is what your saying? I'm not sure how to ""mount the image."" =/

By the way, the download was great it only took and hour and a half. =)"
,Angryjoey,2011-09-29T07:33Z,u gotta mount it with deamon tools or sum such shit
,Daemonseek3r,2011-09-30T00:13Z,Daemon tools? huh... okay I'll try and look for those. But if anyone knows for sure could you please tell me?Thanks. =)
,RC_Ebooks,2011-10-02T12:26Z,"Thanx, I am having a BLAST playing this game. Everything they did with this is good and it doesn't crash like MoTS always did."
,chaos21,2011-10-08T21:40Z,yes its daemon tools. you can also use poweriso. those programs add a virtual drive to your computer and you can mount the image in the downloaded file to the virtual drive. u should realllllly look something up about torrenting because you can potentially get into a lot of trouble. 
,SamAsh07,2011-10-13T16:20Z,Or people can just download ImgBurn and burn those img (.ccd) files onto their DVD-Rs or CD-Rs -whichever fits. And play the game.
,hyperspaced,2011-12-07T12:56Z,"game works perfectly, thanks"
