At 22, CÃ©line receives several shocks: her father dies and she learns she was adopted; she rejects her inheritance, so her fiancÃ© jilts her. She's suicidal. A nurse sees her weeping in public and takes her home. Her mother hires the nurse, GeneviÃ¨ve, to care for CÃ©line; GeneviÃ¨ve imposes the same work and meditation regime she herself used to recover from similar depression two years before. The film plays out the resulting dynamics: CÃ©line has mystical success in meditation, and neighbor children discover she has healing powers. Yet life remains painful. Meanwhile, the friendship is now the center of GeneviÃ¨ve's life. When CÃ©line leaves, GeneviÃ¨ve must cope anew with loss. Directed by Jean-Claude Brisseau
