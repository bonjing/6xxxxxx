HQ promo music video. "Get Out the Door" is the third single from Velvet Revolver's second album Libertad. This song is about a transvestite. Also, the song's solo features the use of a talk box by lead guitarist Slash.

It is the third single from Libertad, after "She Builds Quick Machines" and "The Last Fight". The band's official website started a poll on which track, out of "Let It Roll", "She Mine" and "Get Out the Door", to decide which song should be chosen as to be released as the third single. "Get Out the Door" won with 53.3% of the votes.

By coincidence, the appropriately titled song was the last song by the band to feature singer Scott Weiland before his departure from the band.

This music video for "Get Out The Door" was directed by Dean Karr. The Director of Photography for the video was Rocco Guarino. Rocco filmed concert footage of the band and took photos throughout the course of their career, then Dean used this footage to assemble a performance video.
