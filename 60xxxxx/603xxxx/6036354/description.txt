Marcus Burnett is a hen-pecked family man. Mike Lowry is a foot-loose and fancy free ladiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ man. Both are Miami policemen, and both have 72 hours to reclaim a consignment of drugs stolen from under their stationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nose. To complicate matters, in order to get the assistance of the sole witness to a murder, they have to pretend to be each other.
