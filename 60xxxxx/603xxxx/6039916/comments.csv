,swaynie,2010-12-15T23:12Z,SEED please
,tasian,2010-12-16T18:25Z,Any chance 130 mb. CAM can be better quality then 700 mb. CAM? Or just a cinema screen will be better quality?
,bychance,2010-12-17T04:07Z,The sample shows that it's almost as good as DVD quality. 8/10.
,PUSSICATx,2010-12-18T16:20Z,seed plz!))
,shanow2010,2010-12-19T15:44Z,"Pretty good for a cam, i'd watch it, but waiting for a better version for the kids."

,Coga95,2010-12-26T13:55Z,"I dont understand the peoples which are watching this movie in so bad quality you are just ruining to yourself.... not just this any movie, i am fan of Harry Potter and i still didnt watch the Deadly Hallows cuz am waiting for Dvd Rip this is just pathetic !"
,Nightwolf,2010-12-26T15:48Z,"When bychance said it was almost like dvd quality, i say, get a new dvd player. Its more like an old vhs quality V:3 A:4. But thanks for the upload."
,psg1488,2010-12-29T04:16Z,The quality on this movie sucked!  It looks like a moving watercolor.  Everything is blurred.
,RWAB,2010-12-31T01:15Z,"Stop saying ""pretty good for a cam"" It's not ""CAM"" It's a ""TS"" cam which are normally way better than regular cams. It SHOULD be near dvd quality so no it's not good for a ""TS."""
,RWAB,2010-12-31T01:16Z,"Stop saying ""pretty good for a cam"" It's not ""CAM"" It's a ""TS"" cam which are normally way better than regular cams. It SHOULD be near dvd quality so no it's not good for a ""TS."" "
,JAXXBOSS,2010-12-31T22:04Z,"RWAB.  STFU.  You have no idea what you're talking about.

A TS IS a CAM.  The only difference is the AUDIO."
,Torbax,2011-01-02T02:18Z,"LOL !! 
It doesn't matter what Cam or ""TS""or whatever it is ... The quality isn't Shit its WATCH-ABLE ...  
Don't get all cocky and demanding on better cam copy's because aslong as the movie isn't' available on DVD you won't get better quality then this"

,onli.temporary,2011-01-14T22:30Z,"Agree with psg1488 ""The quality on this movie sucked! It looks like a moving watercolor. Everything is blurred. "" Looks almost as if a filter was applied. Especially with some high frequency stuff like the grass and vegetation leaves you notice it."
,camo12345,2011-01-15T22:26Z,"Won't be downloading this one then. I'm used to screener and dvd quality movies... times are a changing, we gotta move with them.

But thanks for the effort, that's one thing i appreciate, times wouldn't change if there weren't people like you :) "
,Something_Clever,2011-01-16T06:11Z,"This is a good upload, it did not look like a moving water color to me or my children. The top of the heads were cut off in a few scenes but that didn't take away from it too much. We enjoyed it very much, thank you!

A/V 10/8"
