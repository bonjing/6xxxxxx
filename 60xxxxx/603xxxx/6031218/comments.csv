+1
are u doing devil 720p?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-11T20:40Z,"@nabarun69: Both titles are available here. ""Untegang"" is one long movie and even as [quark] can not be particularly small. I suggest doing TPB search on top of the page. There is two torrents alive with 1-1.34 GB encodings.

Search for: big+fish and you'll get
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5386053/Big_Fish_(2003)_HDRip_x264_By_RiddlerA

and people said that his rips are better than mine.

@madtown: Thanks my friend. Say Hi to ""your better half"" too.

@DSIN: I would try, but it hardly can be before Xmas. Do Google if you cannot wait."
,jon4fun,2010-12-12T01:22Z,"Hi 20-40,
Thanks for the encode/upload.

Cheers
Jon"
,DSIN,2010-12-12T07:22Z,"i'll wait man ... thanx.. 
But i'll expect them before new year...ok :D"
,strmprpl,2010-12-12T07:48Z,"I hope you got my mail regarding a few old movies. Do let me know if you can do them. 

And RiddlerA is good too. Except that the frequency/no. of uploads aren't that many.

Also, see if you can do a rip of 'For colored girls'. I know it is currently rated low, but the movie IS good. Though as a few critics have pointed it out, it could've been done a little more subtly. 

Anyway, here's the link -http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1405500/

Let me know!
Thanks"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T09:35Z,"@strmprpl: I am afraid I cannot right now, for many reasons. Out there is DVDSCR and we could expect DVD soon enough, what in turn, as many times before, made me feel stupid by doing few encodings of same movie in the row, pretty much unnecessary.
But I will look into it and of the movie is good... maybe I would."

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T10:56Z,"@himansu_007: Already done, but no upload slots, sorry. You have to wait or download from somebody else."
,r-0987,2010-12-12T11:19Z,"Thanks! It Works GREAT On a PS3, But Can U Tell Me How To Play It On a DVD Player?"
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T12:31Z,"@r-0987: You are here long time and yet you haven't read or you don't know:

*** 2-pass encoding for PC, PS3 or Xbox . ***
*** Video is H264; audio is AAC LC and container is MP4. ***

However, new DVD players and standalone media players have MP4 abilities. RTFM."
