Cheers!!"
,dark_defender,2010-12-13T16:22Z,"Hi 20 40,
Does ""REQUESTS ARE ""FROZEN"" means you are not taking any request as of now or what?
Plz elaborate.
Thanks!"
,muthineni,2010-12-13T16:35Z,"@ dark defender
sadly yes my friend. he said so in many other uploads that he ll not consider any till christmas."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-13T16:50Z,"@dark_defender: LOL: as I explained ""frozen"" mean like ""I'll look into/I can promise nothing/Maybe you'll get lucky"".

I have around 40 movies ""on stock"" (not encoded) and I can encode 1 or 2 every day. If I fulfill all requests placed - I can easily become public library and forget about the rest (TV shows for instance) - just because 80& of people are to lazy to Google for themselves.

Further, I am very very very ill - and I do have limits."
,dark_defender,2010-12-13T17:08Z,"@20 40,
Oh man!! Sorry to hear that you are ill. I am very well aware of the fact that you get loads of request everyday, after all you are best(among i know of) in this business :)

So i will just put my request and leave the rest upto you. Its your call anyway.

Iron Monkey
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108148/

Deadwood(i want 2 & 3 season, but ""if"" you will you will upload all seasons i guess )

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348914/

Even if you do not entertain my requests for whatsoever reason you have, it will be absolutely fine by me :) But if you do then

Thank in advance!!
