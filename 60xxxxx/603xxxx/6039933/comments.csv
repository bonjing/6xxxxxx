,hoff94,2010-12-23T19:40Z,How do i install it?
,Knightyme,2010-12-30T13:48Z,"To install:

un-archive file

If done right you will have 2 folders and 2 PDFs
Folders:
 - ZygorGuidesViewer (with files in it)
 - ZygorTalentAdvisor (with files in it)

PDFs:
 - Archaeology - Zygor Guides
 - Guild Leveling Perks - Zygor Guides

---

Go to your WoW Folder, wherever it is installed
 - open the Interface folder
  -- Open the AddOns folder

Copy the 2 Zygor folders, as is, into the AddOns folder.

Done.

You can also put the PFDs there as well for convenience, but they are not required for the mod.

---

The above is the same for any mod installed by hand."
