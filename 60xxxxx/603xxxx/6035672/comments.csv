This single fact would tie him to the recurrent theme of leaving the rural south for an industrial job in the north."

Little is known of either man. Mike Stewart, who recorded the pair for Adelphi called them among ""the least talkative"" artists he had ever encountered. They came to the makeshift recording studio set up in a motel room, played their songs, and left. Weston was also recorded by Pete Welding, issued in 1997 by Testament."
