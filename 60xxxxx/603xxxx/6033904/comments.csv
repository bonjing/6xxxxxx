Still waiting on the Incubus one, seeded 17X, and still downloading at an avg. of 8kB/s.

Just a thought."

I intentionally throttle down my new torrents so it takes a day or two to upload the complete file. The reason is to create a healthy swarm and ""lasting power"" so I don't need to babysit....so I can upload yet more goodies.

I understand you're frustration bro with a slow torrent. You could always stop it for a day or two then activate it again once there's many seeds.

Just a thought :)
