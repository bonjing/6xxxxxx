,liamtoh10,2011-02-01T18:47Z,"I cant get this to work. 
I have burned it to a double layer disc, and it looks exactly alike as some other bought discs, when I look in my computer. 
It even says in the mediaplayer, that it should be played in a xbox console. 
But when I put it there it wonÂ´t play.
Anyone for an answer?"
