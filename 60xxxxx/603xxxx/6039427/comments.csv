I recommend this torrent with one HUGE caveat: The folder path starts with 'shunkang@www.sexinsex.net' and ends with a string of Asian characters. If your browser will let you, delete the Asian characters, and add a '1' or '2' in their place. When I tried to move or copy the files, Windows could not handle the Asian string and crashed. I wound up creating new folders (without the strings) and moving the files there with BitTorrent's ""Right-Click\Advanced\Set-Download-Location..."" feature. After that Windows could locate the files. But it would have been simpler to fix it at the outset."
