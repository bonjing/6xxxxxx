,scoang6777,2010-12-11T17:30Z,"Thanx,these games are older,but still consider the best RTS games."
,motley666,2010-12-12T17:56Z,"I wish this was the english version, i couldn't play it because i wouldn't understand objectives. I am interested in Barbarossa, Green Devils, Kursk and Total Challenge if they are english versions. Talvisota would be a good addition to my Blitzkrieg collection so keep them coming and thanks. I also uploaded some Blitzkrieg missions for everyone to enjoy."
,scoang6777,2010-12-13T00:50Z,"Go to ""Blitzkrieg Map shop"" you can get all the Total challenges plus all sorts of campaigns and maps there."

,scoang6777,2010-12-13T21:05Z,"The campaigns I need are Barbarossa,Green Devils,Kursk and Talvisota."
