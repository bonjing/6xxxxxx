Did everything. The folder does not contain rld.dll but rldata.dll

Any1?

Thanks!"
,Lerianis2,2010-12-17T09:53Z,"I can confirm that for some reason with the crack given, it does not work on a 64-bit OS. According to the website for Disney, it should work on a 64-bit OS.

I think perhaps the crack is just a 'not working' crack. Reloaded has released quite a few of those recently on RLSLog.net, so I wouldn't be surprised if this one doesn't work as well."

,Alessamb,2011-01-20T01:01Z,"Any news?
Didn't work on a 32bit OS too."

,SilverATI,2011-05-31T03:40Z,"I use Windows 7 64 bit, Home Premium and the game works fine.

I extract the .iso zip and install it the usual way. Then inside the crack folder, copy all the 3 data there. Now go to your install folder, paste there.

When you install the game, choose destination to program file (x86).

Progrma file x86 is for 32bit programs, while the program file for program that compatible with 64 bit.

It works great for me :)
No virus and all that, I use Kapersky."
,Bear133,2012-01-14T00:24Z,"Help! I can NOT get this to work! Someone tell me where I went wrong, please! I downloaded the torrent, mounted the iso, used the ""setup"" file to download the game, then copied the contents of the ""crack"" folder into just about everywhere, and all I got were a bunch of ""inset disk"" or ""failed to initialize!"" messages. 
Also, I noticed that when I the game installed on my PC, there wasn't an actual ""application"" file, just a bunch of shortcuts. So, I tried copying just about everything from the torrent to my computer too and did the whole ""copy and replace"" thing with the crack folder, but again ""insert disk""
Would really appreciate if someone could give me any more detailed instructions/troubleshooting things. I have Windows Vista, 32-bit.
Thank you!!"
