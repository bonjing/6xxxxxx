The Showtime Original Series DEXTER ended Season Four with a huge dramatic twist. This season, Dexter goes from happily married husband to guilt-ridden single dad. Could America's Favorite serial killer be experiencing real human emotion? And how will it affect his ability to maintain an average-guy facade while satisfying his need to kill? As Dexter's secret life and new responsibilities threaten to overwhelm him, his ability to remain focused - and undetected - are being tested like never before.
