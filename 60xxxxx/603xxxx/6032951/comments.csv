I was going to fuck it up for them!"
,Frice,2010-12-12T17:23Z,"Thanks UFC staff for not revealing the fight that wasn't already over.

GSP v Kos? Of course its GSP by Decision. I would be upset if they ruined Howard v Alves personally. 

Kos losing is a foregone conclusion, I just want to see the dumb fuck get his face beaten in.

Oh yea if you aren't paid by the UFC you are just a troll and that is enough revenge for me."
,Frice,2010-12-12T17:25Z,"Guys Davors is a dumb troll but GSP v Kos was a foregone conclusion. I would be personally upset if he ruined any of the exciting fights (Howard v Alves).

Davors next time list all the fights. Then its easier to ignore your dumb troll ass."
