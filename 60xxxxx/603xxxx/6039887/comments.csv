,Jimstalk,2010-12-14T17:41Z,I AM SEEDING
,VED25,2010-12-14T17:59Z,"Not working good here, i dont see any landinggear, engine runs but you dont see it spinning. In the VC it all likes to be working, but the plane is not flyable this way here :("
,Jimstalk,2010-12-14T18:10Z,"THE 707 ENGINES HAVE TWO SPINS.JUST ZOOM ON THE ENGINE.

CANT SEE THE LDG GEAR??Ill make a quick search at captainsim forums"
,Jimstalk,2010-12-14T18:23Z,"i found this on their forums:


Hi guys,

I gave in and bought the 707 this evening, my initial findings are below, and help or pointers would be greatly appricated Smiley.

1) the engines fan blades dont rotate, seems like a static picture. which is very odd

2) the trim is hyper sensitive, there is a value where u click once and the aircraft dives/or pitches up rapidly

3) flashing textures [reading the relivent forum post now]


As a P>S i have no idea where to start with this, is there any plans for a tutorial from XXXX-XXXX, i would love ot learn how to fly this bird 








answer:

Hi Alex.

1) These engines on the 707, I assume, are like the engines on the 727. The fan blades at the front that you can see, don't spin in real life either. That's the way P&W designed them.

2) Yes it is. After takeoff (and you have raised the gear) turn the A/P ON. It will hold your current pitch, try being at about 12o nose up. I then use the pitch trim on the 2D A/P to adjust the pitch. I use the A/P pitch control a lot and only really stop using it when I am on approach and turn the A/P OFF for the landing.

3) I have this problem too. Just not often. I reload my 707 when it happens (I want my full cabin!) and it usually fixes it.

It's fun to learn to fly this lovely lady. Flying the 727 helped me a lot with flying the 707. I recommend that you get your hands on 707perf.zip from the Avsim file library, lots of great information in there.

I have never done a video for YouTube, I should learn, so I can show you what to do. Fraps was a pain though. I nearly filled up my C drive with videos that it was taking every time I pressed F9. Had me stumped as to why I was have memory errors and my C drive had only a sliver of pink in the pie chart. Besides that, I have no idea how to get convert them and upload them to YouTube. I know I should learn, so those who want help, please don't jump in here and start telling me what to do to get them up. Until I push myself to do it, you will be wasting your breath. Wink

,ePyrate,2010-12-14T18:47Z,It fly's but there is no landing gear and the guages are frozen solid. 
,ePyrate,2010-12-14T18:51Z,She fly's but it missing the landing gear and the gauges are frozen. I think this is an activation issue.
,1sh1g4mi,2010-12-14T19:05Z,"I'm afraid it is not operational like the B-52:

Almost all gauges do not work
While you can hear the switches clicking almost all wont move when actually clicked.
Landing gear is invisible
Flaps do not work
ACE is not responding

Again nice try but without actually crack it is not operational. At least the installer is now available for people to meddle around with."
,Jimstalk,2010-12-14T19:28Z,Yes at least use the installer and make a crack
,kbnsalem,2010-12-14T19:55Z,"Jimstalk, sorry for ask that, but in the other file (B-52 Driver) You told to do that, why don't you do it?

Jimstalk ĂÂ s 2010-12-13 18:15 CET: 

DO you have the 707?? Follow these steps:

open 707 installer

intall the plane in your own system using the order number they gave you

after installing it re-run the installer and click ""repair""

create a folder in your desktop named cs-707 or whatever
Run enablebutton(can be found in pmdg torrents) with admin rights(right click on program and then run as administrator)

change the install directory (Point installer to C/desktop/cs-707 or wherever you have your desktop with the folder you previously created.)

then click next (enablebutton must be open in oder to click 'next')

All the files will be installed in the folder cs-707

open u-torrent vuze or whatever you have

click new torrent or ""create torrent""

set as tracker : http://tracker.openbittorent.com/announce

locate cs-707

upload it on TPB "

,A380-800,2010-12-14T21:39Z,"This one does not works proper like all people say here but anyway it's a nice try with that enable button.
thanks for the upload."
,Jimstalk,2010-12-14T22:17Z,just use the installer in order to make a crack.Tomorrow im going to upload a RIP
,NvidiaPhysX,2010-12-15T17:10Z,"excellent try Jim, I created a rip and got everything working fine from panels to flaps. only one problem is that, landing gears are invisible."
