,michelasso,2010-12-14T03:37Z,never mind. It seems I started downloading it just after the file has been uploaded. So getting only leechers.

Subtitles are washed out somewhat against certain backgrounds."

Thanks a lot!"
,carsnkrak,2011-01-09T09:00Z,"movie did blow anus. 
it was like a move made by napoliean dynomite crew (low budget) not funny at all but they were trying to be like a secret agent but the film sucked"
,chat2som,2011-01-11T07:18Z,FXG you always have been my fav.. we can trust your video blindly.. far more better than axxo.. thanks for the upload.. you r the best
,Sharak23,2011-01-12T01:46Z,"PUUUUUKEEE 

 Anything with George Clooney in it is Garbage!

 He brings no personality to the table, his characters are so fucking boring and dull... he never gets naked, not even shirtless. He just wants to get paid for reciting lines, how did he become a famous actor. Man he sucks"

,Ozzy_fan,2011-01-18T01:25Z,"Hey FXG_TEAM, 
I am fairly new to Torrents compared to most people on here. Let me start by saying Thank you Very Much for all of your hard work on all of these quality ups of yours!!! Your u/l's are always top quality & I never have to read the comments for A=?, V=?. if it saysâ€¦ By  FXG_team, Itâ€™s golden! I always trust your d/lâ€™s !!! I was wondering if you & your team accept donations of any kind? I myself donâ€™t think seeding alone plus a polite comment here and there is thank~you enough. I do seed as often & as much as I can however. If I may ask another question. My G/F wants to see  â€œFlicaâ€œ & ""Flicka 2"" in a bad way, Would you happen to have them? I would love to have both for her to watch back-to-back. When sheâ€™s happyâ€¦ Iâ€™m happy :o)~ I will give you my email addy so you can answer my first & second questions, if you get the time. I appreciate you sharing all of these quality torrents with everyone. Thanks once again for all of your hard work...it is very much appreciated!!!  Ozzyfan

,glowaglowa,2011-01-21T19:40Z,"The copy is outstanding - a10v10. But why do people make such films? It's so unbearably boring that almost unwatchable. Why pay Gerge Clooney for playing in this shit? I'd rather pay the guy for, I don't know, shaving my armpits or singing happy birthday for my deaf aunt. "
