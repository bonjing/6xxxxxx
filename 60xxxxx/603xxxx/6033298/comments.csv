@prank0007: Yesterday I got new, fantastic streams for Transformers Prime. So far HDTV steams have been ugly and I, seeing devastatingly shitty ep.3 and unbearably crappy ep. 4., dropped Transformers out of the sight. So, I would redo eps 1 and 3 and rest only if these new sources keep high standards (more than 1000% better looking than DivX and 720p we have so far)."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T14:01Z,@muthineni: I did 320p this summer.

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T15:16Z,"@doyll:As I already told, my own software is useless for public.
However, be aware that with any conversion information can only be lost - copy is always degraded original. Always. If you can- avoid conversion, lost in quality is bigger than gains in size.
2nd rule is GiGo: garbage-in-garbage-out, meaning - if sources ain't of highest quality or are problematic on any way - outputs are often so ugly that all time and energy doesn't pay off.

For conversions to mp4 people use HandBrake with nice results. I know almost shit about, but I do know that Handbrake is Open Source, free, has designated forum and tutorials all over the Net. Just Google."

why are all yr moviepks always with less seeders.getting very low d/l speed.
really wanted to watch ODESSA File but hardly getting any speed.i hv a very low speed connection "
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T16:03Z,"@sinner77 : Either you get something terribly wrong or your ISP is able to kill your P2P traffic down.

I seed that specific torrent (movie-pack) with full speed (3 Giga per second) since day of the upping.

I pull current stats out (just now, for you):

Upload Speed:	974.9 kB/s
Down:	0.00 MB	Up:	37.21 GB
Down-Total:	0.00 MB	Up-Total:	37.21 GB

re: encoding software, I'm using MeGUI & downsizing my library too.

I use 2-pass w/ avg bitrate of 450.  It gets me close to 20-40's size with ""comparable"" quality.  Typical shows take 3hrs on my Turion64(1.8) and 30mins on my i5(2.66).

x264: --pass 2 --bitrate 450 --stats "".stats"" --slow-firstpass --psnr --ssim --output ""output"" ""input"" "
,silveroakleaf,2010-12-12T19:15Z,doyll:  try MeGui - I'm using it to downsize also
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T19:57Z,"@sinner77 :  Think about for a moment: I am usualy only one who have 100% in packs,so your torrent program must ask my program to release him a chunk of data.That is how torrents works. My best guess is that your program ask other peers who are not willing to share or give data to you - and because by your saying ""has slow connection"" consider and treat you back as ""incooperative"". Get that? Read that few times if needed. Further, as you can see from stats I therefore pulled out, I serve only 20 peers at the time, other waiting their turn. That's also how torrenting works. Right?

Now, add your slow connection  to equsion - what mean YOU HAVE slow upload too, and with all desision mechanisms present - you are obviousely ranked very very low - in inter-peers  communication you have such low rating that you - cannot come accross, sort of speak.

Such problem is MAGNIFIED"

Such problem is MAGNIFIED in torrents with great number of files in - even if I made ""chunks"" when torrent is created ridiculousness small - to make ""life"" easier for people on slow connections.

There is no effective way for you to get around this, but to choose torrents accordingly.

Usage of patched and too aggressive torrent programs is forbidden here and I treat them as hostile."
