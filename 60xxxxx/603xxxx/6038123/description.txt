Thelma Houston
20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Thelma Houston (2007)

Singer Thelma Houston is best known for her number one pop classic disco cover of "Don't Leave This Way." Originally a hit for Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes featuring Teddy Pendergrass, the Gamble & Huff/Cary Gilbert song soars through the gospel music-honed vocals of the Leland, MS, native. Houston's energetic performance takes the song in the same way that Aretha Franklin takes "Respect" -- with no disrespect to either artist.
