 Conclusion  

Built this from the chm that was floating around on the internet.

This is the best sales book I've ever read. I'd say buy it to support the author but it's out of print.

Thanks for the book Tim, I bought it and wanted a pdf. Couldn't find it so I made this. Hope it doesn't piss you off.
