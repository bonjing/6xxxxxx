,samiken7,2010-12-11T20:52Z,thanks once more 
,Bolt19,2010-12-11T22:02Z,"Thanks, but there is no plugin in this download, only 2 .psd (Photoshop image files)"
[V],thethingy,2010-12-11T22:20Z,"Bolt19, not all plugins are exe's and have installers, ""PSD file: Image file created by Adobe Photoshop, a professional image-editing program; may include image layers, adjustment layers, layer masks, annotation notes, file information, keywords, and other Photoshop-specific elements."""
,Bolt19,2010-12-12T02:03Z,"Correct . . . not disputing the fact that a .psd file may contain layers, but this is NOT a plugin, which is not an executable - although the installer may be, but is an add-on programs aimed at providing additional image effects or performing tasks that are impossible or hard to fulfill using Adobe Photoshop alone. This file does not accomplish any of these.

Thanks though for your files, I've used  a lot of them."
[V],thethingy,2010-12-12T02:54Z,"Bolt18, OK if you say so. "

What's the problem? 

Thethingy provides an amazing assortment of uploads that you can have at zero cost. What does it matter if the title does not fit your expectations? 

Please refrain from downloading if small issues are so problematic to you.

Remember that old saw . . . has to do with looking a gift horse in the mouth?

It's good advice.

Thanks again thethingy, while this file was not what I was looking for, you ARE THE GREATEST, I among many will always throw praise your way. 

You sincerely deserve it. "
