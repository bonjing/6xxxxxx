The Cam is acceptable, but barely watchable, as the details are hard to make out (couldn't read what was written on the piece of paper, though it took up nearly the whole screen), and the audio is acceptable too, but I'm waiting for a real rip.

For a cam: V/5, A/5

I really wanted to see this one! Thanks again for the effort, much appreciated! "
