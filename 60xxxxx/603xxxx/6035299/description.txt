Blondie - Dreaming [Top of the Pops 1979].VOB



Very HQ rare "Top of the Pops" tv show promo performance. Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006.

Each weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.

"Dreaming" is a song by the American punk/new wave band Blondie. Released in 1979, it was the lead single from their fourth album Eat to the Beat. It peaked at #2 in the British singles chart.

"Dreaming" was written by the group's principal songwriting partnership, Deborah Harry and Chris Stein.

The power pop sound of the record is one of its trademarks as is the opening line "When I met you in the restaurant, you could tell I was no debutante". The song is also influenced by the popular Phil Spector phenomenon, the wall of sound, which utilizes multiple layers of the same various instruments to create a full and voluminous sound or atmosphere.
