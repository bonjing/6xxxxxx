Thanks to neonrainbow!"
,jackson5more,2010-12-17T18:21Z,I think this movie gave me brain cancer.  Good rip tho - thanks
,therayne,2010-12-18T01:16Z,"Quality is perfect (V:9 / A:10) but the movie is really bad. Some dodgy production values, CGI, green screen etc. 
It feels like the script was written by a teenager. I normally have a high threshold for below average movies but this falls way below the line. Terrible, don't waste your bandwith - watch the trailer instead, you'll probably get all the best bits."
,Phatfish,2010-12-18T12:46Z,"A/V - Good, average dvdrip quality.

M - Well, I didn't have high expectations as I was hangovered as hell and just wanted to watch something stupid and simple.
However then It was totally unwatchable. Turned off after about 13 mins."
,dustbag,2010-12-18T12:46Z,"The previous spoiler comments must except one man's meat can be anothers poison. I would be grateful if u allow me to make up my own mind on the content quality as i expect many others would agree, thx in advance."
,lewjen,2010-12-19T10:58Z,pipe down dustbag you fag
,Plasmadude,2010-12-19T21:40Z,"Its a shame you fuckheads cant take a joke.
Perhaps the ying  and yang of the universe dictates you losers should do some bongs before watching such a movie. "
,dustbag,2010-12-20T10:04Z,"Thank god for evolution, otherwise we would all be swinging in the trees like lewjen"
,shaan117,2010-12-20T18:13Z,"@dustbag - lmao ""thank GOD for evolution"" a little bit contradictory don't you think."
,dustbag,2010-12-21T09:34Z,"@shaan117 Yes, but life is full of contradictions."
,baldrick98007,2010-12-25T02:38Z,"A rarity - a comedy that has funny moments.

Good quality and fun. Don't expect any acting or a storyline, but lots of piss takes of Gladiator movies."
,spain00,2010-12-25T14:55Z,this movie was horrible....  if you value your time and brain cells do not watch it.
,dsgjsd2,2010-12-28T18:04Z,No Bigus Dickus or Nortimus Maximus in sight but not that bad. Thanks for the dl!!!
