,asighkick,2010-12-13T23:48Z,"Question:

Will you be uploading the Five (5) X Factor Best & Worst episodes which are being shown @ 2000 Monday - Friday on ITV2 ?

To be honest, I watch this show not only for the great singing, but also for the horrendous auditions from people who think that they can sing!"

Any chance you could seed Season 5 Episodes 13, 15, 19 ?   I'm stuck on 85%."

,nikoHD,2011-01-08T09:05Z,Hi verovenlo thanks for all the x factor eps. I was just wondering when you will be uploading x factor season 8 as i'm not sure when it starts. And if you can would you be able by any chance to reseed x factor Season 5 episodes 14 to 21?
