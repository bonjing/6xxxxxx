,5X32C54B,2010-12-13T11:16Z,"The WikiLeaks cables are updated 2 or 3 times a day.  Every update contains all the previous cables plus the new ones added in the day's update.  Ergo - you only need to download the most RECENT version of ""Cablegate"" to get all of the cables.  

The reason for this slow release of the cables is explained here:
http://wikileaks.renout.nl/static/html/faq.html
Are all the embassy cables being released at once?

No. Instead of publishing the documents all at once, the organisation will be releasing the embassy files in stages.

Why not release everything now?

The embassy cables will be released in stages over the next few months. The subject matter of these cables is of such importance, and the geographical spread so broad, that to do otherwise would not do this material justice.

We owe it to the people who entrusted us with the documents to ensure that there is time for them to be written about, commented on and discussed widely in public, something that is impossible if hundreds of thousands of documents are released at once. We will therefore be releasing the documents gradually over the coming weeks and months. "
