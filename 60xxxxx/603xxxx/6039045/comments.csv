For unlocking 60 fps use hexeditor find string ""maxfps"" near this text you will find number 30 change it to 60 now run game use console and write ""cl_maxfps 60"" until now game will always use 60 fps and cant change to 30 back
Heretic II
I am found how to change resolution.
hexstring ""028001E0"" that represent 640x480 and change it to ""07800438"" it resolution 1920x1080. 
02 80 01 E0
(02 80 hex) = (640 dec)
(01 E0 hex) = (480 dec)
1920 dec = 0780 hex
1080 dec = 0438 hex"
