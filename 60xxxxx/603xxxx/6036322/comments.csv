[V],Subzero!,2010-12-13T12:31Z,"Iam uploading TPTB torrents, because IAM The Powers That Be ... the one and only, together with a couple mates (see above Tags!), so why dont you bother about things you have a clue about, such a wanking or summit. cheers and have a nice day."
,motley666,2010-12-13T13:14Z,"I know it man, i am a member of TPTB site, when it was uploaded it was saying ""by anonymous"" and i tried to support you, you misunderstood but tpb's fault. Now it's changed and your name is visible. Cheers!"

,motley666,2010-12-13T16:17Z,"@ Royhere

Did you actually read my second comment? If so, you would know i was not trying to be smart with subzero, i have downloaded many of his games, just read comments before you post please. You also must know that many users upload torrents of tptb anonymously without permission of ToeD or Shroo etc., after they have downloaded first. There are plenty of them floating around."

,hairyassapeman,2010-12-13T18:31Z,"In motley's defense, sometimes the upload is listed as Anonymous for awhile, before changing to the proper name with a skull, so go easy on him.  I've seen it happen before.

Thanks for the upload Subzero. "

[V],Subzero!,2010-12-14T17:32Z,min. 1GB ram dude!.
,capullio,2010-12-14T18:30Z,ok ta. is the game worth getting extra ram for?
,capullio,2010-12-14T18:31Z,is it worth getting extra ram for this game or not?
,capullio,2010-12-14T18:33Z,is the game worth the extra ram?
[V],Subzero!,2010-12-14T21:37Z,"well to be honest, you wouldnt come far with just 512mb nowaday, so hurry up, and install some more ram, 1gb is ok, but not good, best is minimum 2gb nowadays!, to have less probs with games etc. and in yer case, it worth to get more ram, for computing in the future. no matter if the game is worth or not... lol"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-15T05:43Z,"@Subzero!

Well, it may sound a bit stupid to you, but what is the meaning of ""Direct play""? Is it online play? Or is it something like Shroo's torrents which are ""ripped""? Please explain. 

And, by the way, I want to join Team TPTB. What should I do?"
[T],PirateBoy,2011-01-15T05:52Z,"@Subzero!

Well, I went to the teamtptb(.dot)com site and tried to register myself there. But, they kept asking about an Invite Code. Where do I get an Invite Code, dude? Please help me..."
