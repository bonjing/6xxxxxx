,hazeleyedpowell,2011-03-08T23:55Z,"I am just wondering, did I do something wrong? Because when I insert the disc the audio works fine, but the video only works on a flat screen tv, on a standard tv, the screen isn't in color and can keep the screen steady so it moves around the screen with static also. I use the Free McBoot soft mod."

,Achilles295,2011-05-11T20:33Z,"This is working on PCSX2 0.9.8.

Great game. Highly recommended to all Naruto fans."
,dothackjhe,2011-05-21T11:11Z,"There's no US release of Naruto Ultimate Ninja 5, but there's the PAL version of it which causes problem with the video output on some of our TV's. To overcome this, there's a software that will convert the game into NTSC from PAL. Here's the link for the tool: http://www.ps3iso.com/showthread.php?t=743 Credits goes to the developer of the tool."

,Seses209,2011-06-19T08:45Z,"To alexman96: To play it on the PC, you need to download a PS2 emulator, which can be found online; the best one is PCSX2, just type it into google and download, it's really easy to use..."

,aishwarya_26april,2012-03-20T09:27Z,this is not English >:(
,theclaw1,2012-05-14T20:32Z,"this uses PAL video. your TV has to accept that. all region PS2 hardware has full PAL support, and will output it when requested by a game.

 text and menus are English/French/German/Spanish/Italian. voice actors are original Japanese."
