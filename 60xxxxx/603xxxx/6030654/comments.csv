,cj4thee,2010-12-14T06:32Z,"Dear himansu_007,

With all Due respect, RippeR is doing a GREAT job in Converting all the Movies into mkv format. Please dont make him change his mind.
mp4 is pretty decent format but mkv is better...
mkv stands for matroska which is an open standard container/format which is clearly the next step in High Definition Video. where movies come in small sizes without loosing their Good looks...
Works great for me.
.
.
Keep doing the great job RippeR"

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6031113/Legend_of_the_Guardians_-_The_Owls_of_GaHoole_%28PSP__iPod__Zune%29

m4v is a workable alternative to mkv and mp4."
,himansu_007,2010-12-14T07:43Z,"@cj4thee
If u r not using multiple sub stream and not keeping ac3 track in mkv then better go to mp4 cuz mp4 hv nt that ...
Though the mkv are not playble in dvd players,."
