From Blackstone Audio.com:

Charlie Wilsonâ€™s War is the untold story behind the last battle 
of the Cold War and how it fueled the rise of militant Islam. 
George Crile tells how Charlie Wilson, a maverick congressman 
from east Texas, conspired with a rogue CIA operative to launch 
the biggest, meanest, and most successful covert operation in 
the Agencyâ€™s history.

In the early 1980s, after a Houston socialite turned Wilsonâ€™s 
attention to the ragged Afghan freedom fighters who continued 
to fight the Soviet invaders despite overwhelming odds, the 
congressman became passionate about their cause and procured 
hundreds of millions of dollars to support the mujahideen.

Moving from the back rooms of the Capitol, to secret chambers 
at Langley, to arms-dealers conventions, to the Khyber Pass, 
this book is a detailed and brilliantly reported account of the 
inside workings of the CIA.


From Wiki:

In the late 1980s Crile began the research and reporting on 
the Afghan War that led to his 2003 best-selling book, Charlie 
Wilson's War, which tells the story of how the United States 
funded the only successful jihad in modern history, the CIA's 
secret war in Afghanistan that gave the Soviet Union their own 
Vietnam. The support for the Afghans, which took place via a 
Pakistani corridor, according to some strained interpretiations 
led to a later jihad against westerners, which Crile claimed 
to have foreseen.Charlie Wilsonâ€™s War has been widely and 
favorably reviewed and is currently in its 10th printing. It 
is the basis of the Tom Hanks/Mike Nichols film, released 
in 2007.

George Crile was an award-winning documentary filmmaker and 
veteran producer for 60 Minutes. Charlie Wilson's War began as 
a 60 Minutes profile in 1988.
