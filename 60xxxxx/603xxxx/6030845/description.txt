Amazon Review:
If you only know Jackie Gleason from The Honeymooners, you may be surprised to learn of his renown as a bandleader and forefather of what has come to be called lounge music. Gleason's easy-on-the-ears music is redolent of swank parties and conviviality--concepts that are as timeless as his renditions of such smooth favorites as "I'll Be Home for Christmas" and "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." Unlike many name performers, he also stretches out a bit on this collection, extending the holiday vibe to a brace of wintry (but not specifically Christmas-tinged) tunes, including "I've Got Your Love to Keep Me Warm." If you'd rather be sipping a martini than another cup of eggnog, this is the Christmas album for you.

Allmusic Review:
With its soft-blanket strings and romantic bent, Gleason's orchestra was perfectly suited for Christmas music. His haunting arrangements make for some wonderful interpretations, especially the wistful baritone chorus of "White Christmas" and a dreamy reworking of "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town." One of the warmest holiday albums of all time.
