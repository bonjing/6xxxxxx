,Stephen304,2010-12-17T18:51Z,"HEY! I spent 5 mins and figured it out:

1. First extract pretty much everything, theres a lot of zip inside a zip going on, you should find:

Install exe -
Sony.Vegas.10.0a.B387.Includes.part01.rar/Sony Vegas 10.0a Build 387/SonVeg_10.0a_Build_387.rar/vegaspro100a_32bit.exe

Keygen program -
Sony.Vegas.10.0a.B387.Includes.part01.rar/Sony Vegas 10.0a Build 387/SonVeg_10.0a_Build_387.rar/Crack.rar/Crack/keygen/Keygen.exe

Crack program -
Sony.Vegas.10.0a.B387.Includes.part01.rar/Sony Vegas 10.0a Build 387/SonVeg_10.0a_Build_387.rar/Crack.rar/Crack/patch/Sony_VegasPro8_DVDArchitect45_SoundForge9_CRACK.exe

2. Install like normal

3. Open the crack program, click the first icon and browse to the ""Sony"" folder, normally at C:/program files/sony

3. Press the folder + icon (2nd icon on the top)

4. Enter a first and last name into the box below, im not sure if you have to use the exact same name later, so I put first and last just in case

5. Press ""Crack Me""

6. After its done, open sony vegas, click run as trial then at the next screen click register with another computer

7. Follow the instructions until it asks for a key

8. Open the keygen program

9. In the keygen, select Vegas Pro 9.0 (32 and 64 bit) Series

10. Copy the key on the bottom box and paste it into sony vegas, finish.

Enjoy!

I hope these instructions helped someone."

Viruses in the following plugins:
Blufftitler standalone
Borisred 4 3 2
ProDADvitaScene
Sapphirev 2
Vegas script collection

Rar-files 1, 8 and 10 affected. Rest seems fine."

,oudshoorn,2010-12-19T16:28Z,"stephen thanks for the explenation but i still cannot make it work everytime it says that the authentication code is wrong 
can you help me please i really need this
maybe it is because vegas is 10.0 and the keygen only goes to 9.0
please some help "
,Stephen304,2010-12-19T17:17Z,"@MrHaf May be true, I haven't used the plugins yet and I don't plan to so watch out people use your brains

Run that keygen, also there's a .reg file to fix a small bug its recommended to add that to your registry. I double checked this time, its registered perfectly and it's fully functional!"
,kanaps,2010-12-20T11:14Z,"Stephen304, AVG  got 2 infections from your link."
,lingardj,2010-12-25T23:11Z,"dont download link from Stephen304, two malware threats.

Scanned Using: AVG 10, w/Latest Updates (25/12/2010)"

You guys, are the ones going around to every torrent saying ""VIRUZZZ!!! DOWNT DOWNLOAD""
SHUT UP!
People have common sense and can judge for themselves what they want to download. you're NOT helping. If you want help, then you have to trust the person offering help. If you don't, then STFU and KEEP OUT OF THE COMMENTS.

Btw avast says the keygen i linked to is clean, but you don't have to take my word for it, (reading rainbow anyone?) scan it yourself, be safe, if you don't think its clean then don't use it. It's up to you.

burnedoutboy

afaik keys are different from computer to computer and most likely you will have to generate your own.

Also, my vegas broke, thats why im back here, maybe my instructions didn't work 100%, i reinstalled and its fine again. Perhaps you are better off getting a portable version."
,sammacco,2011-02-28T14:26Z,"For All Us The Stupid Ones!

Find the correct keygen for Vegas 10.

1. Right-click the keygen and run as the ""ADMINISTRATOR"".
2. PATCH the direction you installed (c:\Program Files?Sony\Sony Vegas 10)
3. Run Sony Vegas, you will be asked about the registration.... 
4. Generate new serial, copy/paste it...
5. Register from another comp. and click next.
6. Save file anywhere (you wont need it).
7. Copy paste Activation code.
VOILÃ - youÂ´re done!"
,cmorellato,2011-04-11T23:57Z,"Stephen's solution worked 100% fine, I closed AVG and run the program without any problem. It's an updated version of Insanity's software, including Vegas 10.0 tools. Thank you!"
,Adbekunkus,2011-05-05T21:45Z,"hi!
