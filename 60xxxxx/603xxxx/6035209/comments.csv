,heffeque,2010-12-13T15:33Z,"@Skatepunkisch: No, not that one. The one in the end, after the horribly version of ""my way"".
Also sounds in minute 11:58 to 12:20."
,fzer0,2010-12-13T16:32Z,I'll forgive that you called it a horrible version and still tell you the song you want is Claire De Lune composed by Claude Debussy.
