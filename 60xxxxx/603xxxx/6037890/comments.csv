[V],BOZX,2010-12-14T10:16Z,"Despicable Me :  yea i have wid Commentary track.... but i think it will be wild to again upload a 720p since i uploaded WiKi release already.....

more over seeders don't seed back that much.... which adds my misery...
i doubt very few takers for that file wid Commentary........."
