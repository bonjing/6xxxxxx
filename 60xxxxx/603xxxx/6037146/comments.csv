,Dragonite_9,2011-06-01T00:35Z,"Hard encoded subs I assume, since there are no .mkv, just .avi, and as far as I know they can not contain subtitles in a choose-able way (as .mkv's can), only hard encoded subs..
So no way of turning them off, I an say to 99% certanty, so I won't bother even download, just a heads upp to you other who are not Dutch..
(Thx for the effort anyways, but would appreciate it a lot if your releases NLT would contain soft subtitles in the future, just as easy to use, and makes us other able to download this torrent too!) "
