,udidwht,2010-12-12T00:23Z,@ Cat...With details like that I take it you were in the ranks of the Boys scouts and committed to  many a nights with camp counselor showing you the ropes.
,SimGameIt,2010-12-12T00:57Z,@udidwht Actually his anger stems from the boy scout leader not wanting to touch his skanky ass. Nope he had to peek inside the tent and jerk off while watching the other kids. It didnt help his sister raped him with a broomstick cause she wouldnt touch him either. He gave himself aids with a dirty needle just to be able to make up the story that he got laid. :-)

,aarque,2010-12-12T04:01Z,"Alright Jim, you rock. I'm sure it wasn't easy to gather a clean rip from your FSX folder, so thanks for the effort. Whether or not it works, it still will be useful to learn from.

And if some kid is posting irritating comments, trolling for confrontation, people wise up and ignore it. To respond to the troll is to encourage it."

Maybe is the Captain Sim 707 in the package!"
,Jimstalk,2010-12-12T10:43Z,"Shit.My pre-paid card has only 30 euros.I need 39.99 in order to buy the 707.Btw i suggest you to download the 707 demo from their site.It needs a strong computer

download it here:
http://www.captainsim.org/tools/x707/csd707_Demo.exe


Btw if you have the 707 installer and you dont know how to create a rip follow these steps:

open 707 installer

intall the plane in your own system using the order number they gave you

after installing it re-run the installer and click ""repair"" 

create a folder in your desktop named cs-707 or whatever
Run enablebutton(can be found in pmdg torrents) with admin rights(right click on program and then run as administrator) 

change the install directory (Point installer to C/desktop/cs-707   or  wherever you have your desktop with the folder you previously created.)

then click next (enablebutton must be open in oder to click 'next')

All the files will be installed in the folder cs-707

open u-torrent vuze or whatever you have

click new torrent or ""create torrent""

set as tracker : http://tracker.openbittorent.com/announce

locate cs-707

upload it on TPB"

does anyone else experience the same problem?

,Jimstalk,2010-12-12T15:16Z,"guys i know that this is not a hardware forum but i have a question:Whenever i try to load the concorde-x or 707 demo or the b-52 from captainsim in a payware airport like manchester extreme or FSD John F Kennedy my fsx crashes and im receiving the following error:Your computer has run out of available memory.Please restart flight simulator using different scenery or traffic settings.I had to reduce the scenery settings but the problem still persists (now during landing)

,Jimstalk,2010-12-12T15:17Z,"@smith231

,smith231,2010-12-12T15:49Z,thanks for the quick response but i already am using the latest version of FSUIPC and SP2/Accel
,Jimstalk,2010-12-12T15:51Z,"@VED25

Its too difficult.You'll have to make a new aircraft.cfg.Just download this one.Ive tested it.Install DCracks fsuipc and make sure to copy paste ALL the files (simobjects,gauges,uninstall.exe etc)  included in the folder in your MAIN fsx directory


@seannie150

So,the problem is not at the graphics card which costs only 30 euros..?You mean i need extra RAM??I have only two RAM cases in my pc??What should i do?"
,Jimstalk,2010-12-12T15:55Z,"READ THIS TOPIC.IT WILL SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM

http://www.captainsim.org/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1292118704/1


OR READ THIS:

On the Co-Pilots Side Panel.

B14. BATTERY SWITCH PANEL -
Turn on the Battery Switch (Shift+M) - Pressing Shift+M also turns on the 4 Generator Switches listed in the next section.

B01. ELECTRICAL PANEL -
Turn ON the Main External Power Switch.
Turn ON the 4 Generator Switches.
Turn the Frequency And Voltmeter Selector Switch to CENTRAL TIP BUS

B07. ENG START CONTROL PANEL
Turn on the Starter Switches for the engine you want to start first, they are in pairs (1 & 2, 3 & 4, 5 & 6 and 7 & 8).

I'm working on something more substantial, but I can and did get them started that way. Also. I did pull all engines into reverse (F2), then I returned them to the stop position (F1). I do this when N2 reaches 20%.

Hope this helps.

,lorum,2010-12-12T16:07Z,"Jimstalk

I am in the same situation like you here because i am having the same message ""Your computer has run out of available memory"" my computer havenÂ´t acting this before, my driver card is now Nvidia GeForce 8800 GTS 512 but i was thinking going to have MSI GeForce N460GTX Hawk 1GD5.


"
,aarque,2010-12-12T16:11Z,"jim, I do not believe your problem is a RAM issue, nor is a 32bit operating system issue. The person who wrote that is un-knowledgeable. There are no FSX programs or software that employ the 64bit architecture, only your basic operating system would, small advantage but I have 8gigs, Vista 64 and I occasionally get the ""out of memory"" message myself, usually when I am running other programs with FSX in the back round. The problem is actually a resource management issue, not raw storage space.

 My recommendation is to close unnecessary programs when running FSX and manually increase the size of your virtual memory, I believe I have mine allocated to somewhere around 16 gigabytes.

 You may want to have a look at this Microsoft support document, it offers several solutions:

,1sh1g4mi,2010-12-12T19:34Z,"I'm having trouble with this. When I load the aircraft the engines immediately die and I cant restart them.

My quick and dirty procedure in cold and dark state (preloaded Cessna 152 and shut down):

0. All throttle to reverse
1. Bat Master to on
2.external power on
3.generators on
4.tip bus selected
5.Crank engine 1 & 2
6.NH reachs 20% > throttle engine 1 & 2  forward to 1% thrust

Result: Nothing.

I don't get any fuel flow at all. Shift+e for auto start not working either.

I'm pretty sure the rip is working but I can't figure out why the engines die on me and why I can't get any fuel flow...

Any advise?"

,aarque,2010-12-12T19:46Z,"Jim, I still think you need to increase your virtual memory, you should at least try that solution, especially since you have so much hard drive space available.

 I do not have Win7 so can't tell you the procedure. For Vista64 I right click my computer tab in the start menu, select ""properties,"" select ""advanced system settings,"" in the performance field click ""settings,"" then from the performance options window select the ""advanced"" tab. The category ""virtual memory"" has a settings button, I select the ""custom size"" radio button and set my virtual memory at 14285 mb. You will have to restart for the changes to take effect."

,1sh1g4mi,2010-12-12T20:25Z,"I wouldn't do that.

I come to think your RIP is not working. 
I have input on the rudder but not on the control column and the ACE is not responding.
I'm not able to add, delete or change any livery.

The rereleased cracked version of the C 130 acted the same way before I saved a state in ACE which is not possible in your version of B 52 since the ACE is not responding.

I guess all these problems are related to the copy protection. Asking about these on official forums will only get you in trouble.

Nice try I guess... "

also ive tried ctrl+shift+f4 and it started engines up straight away and went in full throttle (great engine sounds btw) but then as soon as i let go engines shut down again.

2. yoke appears to be locked, not sure if their is a switch to unlock it? or if it needs engines running to unlock?
