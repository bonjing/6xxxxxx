,ripFuel,2010-12-11T23:54Z,Excellent quality! Season 02 is also available.
,chrisberry,2011-01-26T22:24Z,These are hardsubbed (the subtitles cannot be removed). NOT RECOMMENDED.
,ripFuel,2011-01-28T22:27Z,"No, they are not hardsubbed. An updated VLC player will let you choose English, Portuguese subtitles or none."
,Joe1Fixer,2011-03-09T04:24Z,"These are hard-subbed, no way to remove from the VLCstreamer on my iPad.   

Have to agree w/chrisberry, NOT recommended!"
,Joe1Fixer,2011-03-09T13:57Z,"However, they seem OK with no subs when played on PC and VLCPlayer.  

Subs only to appeared hardened on iPod and iPad.

Recommended for PC, not recommend for iP*d."
