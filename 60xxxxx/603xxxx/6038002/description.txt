iNK NOTES
Cleared up 99% of noise on track. Ran it through a dynamic processor and stereo processor. The PPV audio may have been studio, but it was recorded in mono... changed that. There was a lot of russian talk throughout the surround channels but I cleared that up with a voice removing hardware to keep the sound effect intact instead of doing it the lazy way of just muting. (Movie lovers who enjoy great 5.1 audio with a 5.1 setup can notice there surround speakers are being muted) Enjoy //iNK
