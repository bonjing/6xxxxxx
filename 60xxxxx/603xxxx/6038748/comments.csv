,Capt.Jambo,2010-12-14T21:00Z,"Hello, will this install nicely over KOMUNITA version of level-d.

Thanx for upload"
,1sh1g4mi,2010-12-15T13:33Z,Since komunitas version is basically only a all in one repack for idiots too stupid to install the first working version: Yes it will. 
,Capt.Jambo,2010-12-15T20:09Z,"""Since komunitas version is basically only a all in one repack for idiots too stupid to install the first working version: Yes it will.""

Since only a stupid idiot would answer like this, you probably installed it.

1sh1g4mi YOU CAN GO FUCK YOURSELF for all I care, a simple YES NO answer would do bitch."
,1sh1g4mi,2010-12-16T18:51Z,"No, your logic is flawed. Not an stupid idiot would answer like this but an asshole knowing more than you.
I'm indeed an asshole. Grab a helmet boy, life is hard."
,Capt.Jambo,2010-12-16T20:43Z,"@ catshit1

I know that 1sh1g4mi has uploaded many good things and I have always thanked him for it. What I do not get it why he has to be an asshole to me, I did not harm him in anyway, he doesn't even know who I am or where I'm from. I am not to blame that his life probably sucks...He just can't come here and treat people like trash just because he thinks he knows more, though, superior. Sad part about this whole mess is that he is not alone...there are more like him, in high places!

PLUR"

,OlaNordmann7,2011-01-01T12:02Z,"Excellent! Was really hoping, that someone would release this winglets-update for the excellent B763-aircraft from LDS - thank you a lot!!"
,airamerica,2011-01-25T17:49Z,Thanks For uploading this update =) It would be even better if someone uploads the V 5.1 Winglet 767 Mega Pack repaints for this.
,DVA8452,2011-03-04T19:31Z,"when i go to install a winglet livery using the repaint manager, it looks like it works. the livery folder makes it into the aircraft folder and the cfg file. but when i load fsx up, all i see are the default level d winglet colors.is there a new version?"
,Cruzu,2011-10-29T15:38Z,Can someone get the liveries for the winglet model? Because you cant get them from the website...
,Dylansb,2012-02-12T00:59Z,1sh1g4mi After treating Capt.Jampo in such a stupid way you can go and fuck yourself
