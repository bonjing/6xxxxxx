[V],joshua13,2010-12-13T23:17Z,"Friend, I wonder if your faith and the world would not be better served by sharing positive writings promoting Islam rather than every negative thing you can find to criticize others and accuse or imply the hypocrisy or immorality of other faiths. Such smear tactics, and charges of guilt by association do little to persuade anyone of anything they do not already believe. They reflect badly on you and your faith.
 This sort of thing is often perceived as the desperate attempt to bolster a weak faith, or to conceal a feeling that you yourself have that you are looked down on by others or the secret fear that you may in fact be inferior to others.

Why not rather show your pride in your beliefs and promote understanding by sharing writings which teach others about Islam?

May Allah bless you.  Go in peace. "
