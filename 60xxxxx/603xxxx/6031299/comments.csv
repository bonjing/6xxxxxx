would you mind seeding again for a short time please?"
,i_am_sid,2011-06-06T02:05Z,"Everyone is stuck at 99.8% because all are missing one file out of 34 files, which is 'ReadMeFirst.txt' file. It happened because by mistake I edited the readme file after making the .torrent file. And also editing a torrent is always disabled on TPB.
You have all the music files, all covers, and all cue files except readme file."
