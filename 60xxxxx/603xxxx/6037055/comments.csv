I know how to put files into a rar file, i'm promoting my site here and putting all my screensavers into a rar file isn't a good way to promote, 

Cheers."
,Cristo,2010-12-13T20:09Z,That is spamming and is against tpb rules

Now i erase all my website link, i'm not spamming now if i upload new screensavers without put all my screensavers into a one single rar file, is better to me and for the users to choose what screensaver download viewing the picture in the torrent post."

You need to see before say that, there is a checkbox to install or not the babylon software, if you dont want to install the babylon software just uncheck the checkbox and then install the screensaver. 

I'll report your comment."
