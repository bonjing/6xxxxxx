For instance Dutch and English are also available. In the standard install the western European maps are NOT included! If you use the 'Aura downloader' which is autmatically installed if you install this torrent on your Android, you can download the maps for other European countries. When I did this however, Aura did not start anymore."
,Beerend,2010-12-14T13:13Z,"Oh, after downloading the maps you just need to restart the device or clear the ram memory and it works! excellent!!

I am very happy with this download thank you very much.

,careman,2010-12-15T21:32Z,Working flawless! Very easy to install. The only problem is that it starts up in Russia when installed. It is possible to download ALL the maps you want from Sygic. I am VERY satisfied. THANKS. I have installed on HTC Desire.
,kacab,2010-12-19T17:58Z,Does this torrent includes map of Slovenia ?
,KOHb13,2010-12-19T21:23Z,No. But you can download id from your phone later.
,KOHb13,2010-12-19T21:32Z,After install
,wyxx,2011-01-08T12:15Z,"HI! Works perfectly on my Dell Streak- interface is good, satellite speed is good- I'm satisfied!!!

Thanks KOHb13!!!

One question- I didn't find option for multi stop route planning- is it there?"
,balintbalint,2011-01-14T17:56Z,So can I update the maps and other components any time with this activation?
,kacab,2011-01-15T17:05Z,"How about updates - currently, Aura is on 2.1.2.....new features and stuff :-)"
,balintbalint,2011-01-16T18:21Z,"I installed it on HTC desire. Works fine, but cannot update program components, so it stays 2.0 forever. :(
Anyway, I'm not sure of the way of updating maps, so maybe it can be solved."
,MeMuppet2,2011-01-26T20:19Z,"When I want to start Aura it comes with the message:
Not a database found in de map 'Res', please delete it and download again.
Anybody an idea???"
,mrja,2011-02-08T10:13Z,how to download new maps? and how to clean ram memory in lg gt540 optymus. 
,KOHb13,2011-02-08T21:26Z,"@mrja
To download maps - run Aura Downloader in your phone.
To clean memory - just restart phone."

,KOHb13,2011-05-02T19:49Z,"@st3n
Are you a marketing manager of tomtom?"
,Endru1983,2011-05-03T11:48Z,"Hi!

Unfortunatelly I have problems, hope you can help me!

1. I downloaded the file, but, it's size is not like here around 1 gb, it's in real 2 gb. Do you know why is this?

2.I do not find any APK extension file in it's folder, so I can't install it...

Do you have ideas why are these, and how could I manage the problem mentioned above?"
,Endru1983,2011-05-03T12:14Z,"Oh, sorry, the size is correct, but still isn't apk file..."
,KOHb13,2011-05-05T19:55Z,"@Endru1983
I donÂ´t understand your question. When you click on ""download torrent"" you have Aura folder and com.sygic.aura-2.apk file. This is it."

,sztikelany,2012-03-31T15:18Z,This might sound a silly question but can I always download the latest maps with the map downloader or just 2010 maps?
