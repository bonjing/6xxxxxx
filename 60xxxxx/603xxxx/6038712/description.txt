K. Flay, MASHed Potatoes, 2009

FLAC download; standard 44100khz stereo, but the bitrates are above the 1411 of CD quality. 24bit I assume

I like her use of samples. The lyrics are all hers [except for three well-placed featured verses], and they're all beautiful.
Many of the songs are quite upbeat (but not in the typical 'party' sense), and I also dig the other ones: Lockdown is a brilliant take on the criminal-"justice" system, Moneymakerz is an interesting iteration of its resentment, Heavy Cross-Out conveys its uphill battle well, and Crazytown's message is very interesting.

Have lots of other K.Flay material available in other torrents.
