"Donnie Fatso"

Homer spends New Year's Eve in the 
Springfield Penitentiary after getting 
caught bribing an official. An FBI 
investigator (guest voice Hamm) offers to 
reduce his jail time if Homer agrees to go 
undercover as an informant to investigate 
Fat Tony (guest voice Mantegna). When Homer 
forges a special bond with Fat Tony and his 
family, he becomes conflicted between his 
obligation to the government and his loyalty 
to his new family. After an unexpected turn 
of events, Fat Tony's cousin Fit Tony 
(Mantegna) seeks to settle a score with 
Homer, but winds up teaching him an 
important lesson.

Enjoy :)
