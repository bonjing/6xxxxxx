This is an acoustic set by K. Flay played for something called "Stanford Sessions" on May 25th, 2006. She got into music while a student at Stanford, so it makes sense.
Transcribed from YT videos to 128kbps. Sound quality is quite clear
The videos had several seconds of silence at the beginning and end of the videos; I edited those out but otherwise left the files untouched.

K. Flay (real name Kristine Flaherty) provided rapping/vocals only, but there was accompaniment on drum (named sounded like "Laurie Anderson") and guitar (name sounded like "Ryan Noreigna")

I have lots of other K. Flay stuff (including standard/studio versions of many of the songs from here).
