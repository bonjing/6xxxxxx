,OrpheusDude,2010-12-16T22:49Z,"Why are there ZERO seeders and 612 peers (!) and the whole things is jammed at 77.8%?  At least there are 18 complete, watchable cartoons if you download the maximum available.  This is by far the best copy I've seen of ""Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfes,"" which has some gorgeous animation in it."
