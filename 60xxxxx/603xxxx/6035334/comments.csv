,arlyn,2010-12-13T05:46Z,"Season 9 episode 7: brian writes a best seller is actually season 9: Episode 6 and aired on Nov. 21. 

Season 9 Episode 8: The road to the north pole is actually season 9: episode 7 and aired today Dec. 12, today. 

I have no idea why these episodes are in one file, or bundled together, or labeled incorrectly. seems to be, LOL did this on purpose for a reason one can only wonder about.

if someone should up the second half of this release and number it correctly. this is always a bad sign. the rest of this seasons releases by LOL will probably all be off a number."

Wikipedia happens to be incorrect, as it often can be. This hour long episode follows the formula that most network shows do, in that it is actually two episodes in their numeric order. So this actually s09e07-08. The wiki admin probably just hasn't updated or been informed, as I doubt the wiki'ers know the length of each episode prior to release and therefore cannot anticipate the circumstance. So don't stress on it, LOL and all of the other reputable scene groups are on point like always :)"
,oversoul53,2010-12-13T06:48Z,"family guy doesn't do that though, when they have an hour long episode it's only marked as one episode, not 2.

for example: Blue Harvest, Brian & Stewie, Something, Something, Something, Darkside,  And Then There Were Fewer, It's a Trap!

these are all all an hour long, but each is marked as one episode, NOT 2.

so Wiki is right, Pirate Bay is wrong.
