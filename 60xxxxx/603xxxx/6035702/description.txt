What do 200,000 Australians a month have in common? They are all engaging in self-harm. Whether it's cutting, scratching, burning or breaking bones, this need to deliberately hurt the body peaks in teenagers and early adults, yet little is known about the reasons why. This program seeks to understand the mindset of those who self-harm, and it explores a radical treatment through a world-first experiment.
