,petfly,2010-12-13T03:23Z,"it's real, i just watched it!
thank you for uploading =)"
,maxifam,2010-12-13T03:55Z,"This is NOT the final, nor is it S07E30. It is an exact copy of the file on here titled S07E29. I'm so upset that I've lost MB by having getting a duplicate file. This one is the Dec 11th show. "
,gloriousglenn,2010-12-13T04:03Z,Very Real!  Just watched it.  Nice one albiondean.
,gloriousglenn,2010-12-13T04:05Z,"maxifam you're wrong.  If you bothered to download it and watch it you'll find it IS S07E30 and it IS from 12th December.  He may not be the 'normal' guy that uploads it first, but he was this week!  Well done again albiondean."
,maxifam,2010-12-13T04:08Z,So sorry!!! My mistake. Yes this is THE REAL DEAL. Duh! My apologies albiondean.
