,listenherenow,2011-01-01T11:57Z,"LOL!!!!   

  This is funny, this movie is from 1982 - Eighty freaking Two dudes. 

  Its an actual RIP.   and you are rateing the audio and video below premium.  LOL  Halarious! 
   Do You Realize that what you are doing is crazy?    This is A/V 10 - 10  for the size.    i suppose you woudl bitch if you downloaed a episode of Bewitched or Our Gang if it were not in color.  LOL    Ha! 

   Man - i just loaded this up and previwed a little - it was hard to stop watching, I only saw this one time when I was in Middle school and I forgot Tons about it. 

  I can't wait to make my kids watch this with me. LOL Bajajajaaaaa!
