John Stagliano, the man credited with launching porn's gonzo revolution with the seminal Adventures of Buttman, displayed his filmmaking range and proved once and for all that story driven features can pack the erotic intensity and sexual ...    Full Descriptionexcitement often missing from big budget adult movies. 

Stagliano's liner notes reveal the inspiration: "In the shadows of your mind, a distant memory of sexual awakening refuses to die. Perhaps it was the first strip club you ever walked into. The erotic tension was so thick you could hardly breathe. In Shadow Dancers, I turn my most intense erotic memories, born in the dark corners of strip clubs, into visual reality. This is the story of a man's search for that ultimate long lost turn on. This was Evil Angel at the start, finding its way." 

From AVN's AAAA review (highest rating in 1990): "Shadow Dancers I & II is Stagliano's epic statement of the dance, the tease, and female body worship. Sex doesn't just roll off a bed in these two features, it's monumentally orchestrated. This may well go down as an adult classic."
