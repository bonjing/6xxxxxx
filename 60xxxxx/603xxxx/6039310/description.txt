Murder in the Title - A Charles Paris Mystery

Bill Nighy stars as actor cum amateur sleuth Charles Paris in this adaptation by Jeremy Front of the novel by Simon Brett.

As ever, Charles is his own worst enemy, a louche lush who can resist anything except temptation especially in the form of women and alcohol. His intentions may be good but somehow the results always go wrong
He's been out of work so long now he feels he may never get a job and he's driving Frances his semi-ex-wife mad.
So when he's offered a small role in an awful play up in Rugland she nearly pushes him out the door.
But as always with Charles murder is never far behind.
