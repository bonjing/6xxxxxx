Notes: This Wolf release features field recordings made in 1990 showcasing the unique styles of bluesmen Herman Alexander and CeDell Davis. Even though he was musically active in the '50s and '60s, CeDell Davis gained national exposure in the mid-'90s through his amazing recordings on Fat Possum Records. His left-handed bottleneck style was developed after his right hand became crippled at a young age. Herman Alexander is a street singer in Memphis. His guitar and harp playing were modeled after Mississippi Fred McDowell. While he has often been heard on Beale Street, he was rarely recorded. Both of these bluesmen play highly compelling, gritty music.
