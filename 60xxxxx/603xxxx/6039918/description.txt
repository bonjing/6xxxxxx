and Dairy Show on 29. Sept 1956. The filmer is positioned at the left 
side of the stage, so close that Elvis at one point nearly steps on him/her! 
The AUDIO is very good, considering the vintage.

Also included in this DVD is footage of the parade the same day, 
to accompany interviews with Gladys and Vernon.


Elvis' 1956 homecoming concerts in Tupelo were a great event for all considered, the city, the Presley family and every resident, including 14 year-old Virginia Wynette Pugh, who would later rise to fame eleven years later as country star Tammy Wynette.

The shows were amazing.
