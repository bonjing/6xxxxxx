Notes: From the far north of Australia but with his musical roots embedded in the deep south of the USA, Sugarcane Collins is a one of a kind singer-songwriter-guitarist. Inspired by the slashing delta blues of Charley Patton and Son House, the sparkling ragtime of Blind Blake and the powerful songster traditions of Leadbelly, Sugarcane sings passionately with a voice that is big and soulful, writes songs that are potent and rich with imagery and attacks the guitar with a driving rhythmic swing. He cut his blues teeth in rough canefield pubs and the dangerous waterfront bars of Cairnsâ€™ famed and feared but now gone Barbary Coast and his 25 year performing career in far north Queensland is the stuff of local legend.
This stunning album from Sugarcane Collins is a dark and vivid collection of thirteen songs plumbed from deep within the rhythms of life in the mississippi delta of the 1920â€™s & 30â€™s. With sparse arrangements, brooding production and the inspired musicianship of all involved, Sugarcane conjures up the cotton fields and baptist churches, the stale-beer smoke-choked juke joints and gutbuckets, the freight trains, prison cells and street corners of the south that gave birth to the blues. Everything about this album is remarkable. This is a masterpiece album from Australian bluesman. Simply - beautiful music!
