,propersina,2011-03-02T20:47Z,bitrate=)(/&%&%$?å¤š?
,igeekpro,2011-03-20T12:05Z,"It would have been nice to know that it's not all the same file format, some albums are WMA, some are FLAC, some are MP3. Most are WMA. Really a pain in the ass..."
,topherschout,2011-04-13T08:08Z,cool thanks
,sfergo,2011-05-07T00:10Z,You are a horrible person. If they weren't in mp3 format you should have told us. I added these to Itunes and it took ages to convert them. How can you do this to people? If you can't be bothered to rip them into mp3 format you should warn us. You are horrible!
,ovresmot,2011-06-01T21:46Z,"DO NOT D/L. Most of this is in .wma format, who the FUCKING FUCK wants that SHIT? Idiot!"
,ImrtlSaij,2011-06-11T21:49Z,you trolls mildly amuse me.
,dktr^,2011-06-17T04:47Z,"Good grief, trolls indeed.

Thanks sansque1122, I was looking for Join the Dots... :D"
,DianaMaclay,2011-07-06T20:00Z,"Mmm, some of the songs are in mp3 format, and some others wma format. Thanks anyway."
,Pakart,2011-07-23T18:03Z,"Why don't you convert 'em yourself, what's the problem? Too lazy or incappable to do it?
Thx for the ul!"
,wibbled,2011-08-03T16:16Z,I Agree. You are getting this shit for nothing. bunch of moaning twats
,boondoddle,2011-10-13T04:15Z,"Thank you, amazing"
,jlh1976,2012-03-24T11:48Z,"Thanks.  This is nice, but utorrent sucks now not letting you chose files before you download the torrent.  

Some of the songs are .wma so some mp3 players won't recognize them, takes time to convert them."
