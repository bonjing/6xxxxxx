[T],mrcoffee1026,2011-03-31T21:12Z,"It actually works fine.  Audacity is fine for audio, sure, but if you want video through a pinnacle capture device, you need their software.

Note... creates (slightly) jerky video when recording from VHS on a Win7 64-bit machine.  This is likely due to this one being 32-bit.  They do make a 64-bit Vista version... I'm not sure what the 7 version is.   This copy is 2.5.0.092... the latest on the website is 2.6.1 (not sure of the build).

I'd love to try the later copy, but Pinnacle won't let me download it (I'm not putting this serial into their form)."

,Bozana123456,2012-04-18T05:45Z,the link you provide is gone. I installed the program and it works but it wont detect my DVC-80 recorder. I went to the Pinnacle site and they wont even let me download the driver without the serial number and I threw the box away YEARS ago :(
