I have read all the books in the series at least twice & have collected the set in audiobook format from various sources over the past few years.  There are at least 3 releases that I know of, each with a different reader.  I am seeking to complete my collection of that version of the series which is read by Simon Vance.  I would therefore very much appreciate it if you would append the narrator's name to each of your uploads so that I can avoid wasting time & bandwidth d/ling versions I do not want.  Thank you."

Anyway, from you or anyone else a seed would be appreciated  :)  Cant wait to hear Jack so thanks!"
