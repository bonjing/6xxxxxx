Description:

Today Peping will happily marry the young mother of their newborn baby.

For a poor police academy student, there is no question of turning down an opportunity to make money.

Already accustomed to side profits from a small time drug ring, Peping naively accepts a high paying job offer from a corrupt friend.

Peping soon falls into an intense voyage into darkness as he experiences the kidnapping, torture and dismemberment of a beautiful prostitute.

Traumatized and helpless, this ordeal makes Peping search within if this experience makes himself a killer.
