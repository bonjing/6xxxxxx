This is a high quality, full resolution, high profile x264 DVD rip of Star Trek Voyager - Season 1.  These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch LCD/surround sound system.
