,Duder82,2010-12-13T04:26Z,Thanks so much. I was hoping you'd do Voyager as well.
,Duder82,2010-12-14T20:17Z,"Btw, do you have any plans what you'll do after Voyager? "
,JT5150,2010-12-15T04:05Z,@Duder82 Agreed.  DS9 and TNG was great quality!
[V],meech,2010-12-15T18:17Z,"I have ripped a non sci-fi series called ""The Shield"" which I will put up after Voyager.  However I do have plans eventually for Quantum Leap, Smallville and possibly Stargate Atlantis...not necessarily in that order.  If you have any suggestions...I can't make any promises, but I will certainly consider them."
,Duder82,2010-12-16T19:30Z,"SG: Atlantis and Quantum Leap would get my vote, if you are considering the order in which to post after Shield."
[V],meech,2010-12-17T03:43Z,And if you have any other suggestions for other shows (besides the ones I mentioned) to do in the future...I'd certainly consider them...no promises :)
,Lars_83,2010-12-17T13:06Z,I suggest Star Trek: Enterprise  :-)
,ipimen,2010-12-28T13:46Z,Babylon 5...luv that show :)
,Duder82,2011-01-02T19:38Z,"Yeah, Babylon 5 probably deserves good DVD rips as well."
,ipimen,2011-01-05T01:45Z,"I just remembered another great show that could use great rips: ""La femme Nikita""."
,dukeofurl,2011-01-05T20:47Z,"Just out of curiosity, how many seasons of Voyager are there?

I have a suggestion for the next series: Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles

Thanks a ton"
[V],meech,2011-01-06T18:44Z,"All Star Trek series (except the early canceled series ""Enterprise"") have 7 seasons.  Season 5 of Voyager is almost done and should (hopefully) be up by the end of the weekend."
[V],meech,2011-01-06T18:47Z,"Scratch that...I still need the last disc of season 5, so it might not be until early next week. (sorry)"
,dukeofurl,2011-01-10T17:27Z,Stargate SG1
,dukeofurl,2011-01-10T17:32Z,Star Trek: The Original Series
,Balinor13,2011-01-11T22:29Z,"Firefly, Angel, and Stargate Atlantis would get my vote. 

and thanks again for all your great rips."
,corein,2011-01-12T02:10Z,Stargate Atlantis would get my vote!
,dukeofurl,2011-01-15T10:55Z,"I am curious, why is season 1 so much smaller than the other seasons?"
,dukeofurl,2011-01-15T10:59Z,"I figured it out.  There are only 15 files in season 1, versus like 25 files in the other seasons.  But also, season 1 is having trouble in transport, utorrent keeps saying ""offline (timed out)"" on that one, but not the other seasons.  It still downloads though, just not as fast as the other seasons."
,troycop,2011-01-26T16:00Z,thanks very much. you rule.
,dukeofurl,2011-01-28T23:45Z,I had an idea for the next series that everybody would want:  The X-Files!  Everybody likes that show.
,Jevin,2011-02-19T12:50Z,SEED Pleasee!!!!!
,anaron,2011-03-09T16:48Z,I'd really like to see Babylon 5.
,AmazingPirate,2011-04-22T18:04Z,Took a while but I got it. Thanks so much!!! Now on to downloading Season 2...
,elindsey,2011-05-01T02:06Z,Anyone else getting lots of artifacts (enough to make it unwatchable) with latest version of VLC (1.1.9 win32)?
,quickbeam1213,2011-05-03T03:33Z,Why the hell are there 106 seeders and the download speed is so slow?
,cpthooker,2011-05-06T13:13Z,What did you use to make these in MKV?
,SwedishMeatball,2011-10-17T17:32Z,"Meech: 
Thank you for the wonderful torrents. I have only watched the first episode and it is awesome. Keep doing single season torrents, it makes life much easier. However, might you be able to do a torrent of the extras for the entire series?

Downloaders:
My first few downloads, I was concerned about exceeding my data allocations or slowing the downloads by using uploading for the available bandwidth. I set the uploads to 1kb/sec max.

I found out that my provider wasn't going to slow down or stop my internet access and that it did not affect my downloading speeds. So, I opened the uploads up fully. 

The other side of this is that I have noticed a huge percentage of leechers. I am seeding everything that I have downloaded, until I reach at least 2/1 ratio. Please give back to the community! Trek attitude says to give as much as you can, because it makes you a better person!

My uploads are set to unlimited, most of the time, on torrents I have completed.

The ones I am still downloading, I am throttling the upload back, if my download speed is less than my upload speed. So, if you are downloading this torrent, set the upload limits to 0 (zero) so they are unlimited! I will respond in kind!"
