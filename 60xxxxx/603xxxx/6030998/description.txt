This is Let Me In (2010) with English audio from an exclusive source that is not on the internet. English audio added and syned by me. Video quality is the same as the Russian cam that is floating around the internet. The English audio is pretty decent (IMO) for a cam. I could've used an audio filter to filter out the hissing but that would have greatly degraded the audio quality (what's left of it anyway).

To make it fit as best I can, first I had to chop off a bit from the beginning then I had to shorten the audio by 4 minutes and 40 seconds. This in turn made it play a good deal faster, however, it isn't noticeable at all because the movie is 1 hr. 47 min. Secondly, I had to edit out several parts of the audio to make it sync to the Russian cam. The Russian cam is missing an entire scene where the boy is walking down a hallway to his room. Also, there are multiple parts of the video where it is missing 2-10 seconds of video. This is throughout the entire movie. So, it took a good bit of audio editing to make it fit. I have no idea why the person who recorded it chopped out so much video. If anybody knows of a better and complete video source, please let me know because I have audio for the entire movie. 

Also, at 32 min. 58 sec. into the movie, on the part where the boy goes outside and finds his Rubik's Cube completed, you should hear the sound of somebody moving about, grunting and scratching. This is the cam holder and not the boy.
