,xdarkmavisx,2010-12-11T22:37Z,"It seems ok. Video is a little dark, but watchable. Audio ain't bad. 
 I still have a few minutes before the DL completes, but the whole film appears to be there."
,madpikey,2010-12-12T14:41Z,well fuck me its real little dark but watchable
,lvnn,2010-12-12T14:51Z,"Yes the movie is all there, this is real folks. It is dark and the auto focus bits (for me anyway) the audio is good, but its the first cam out there, I have been waiting for ages. A 6 V 5-6. Enjoy!!!!!"
