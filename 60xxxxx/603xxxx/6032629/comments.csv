With JScript, the ""Save"" button to edit the torrent turns grey and the torrent does not get updated.  I wait an hour and nothing happens.  With JScript disabled, I save to edit my bittorrent description and get a blank webpage even after an hour of waiting.
I checked on the piratebay forums and editing works for some people and does not work for others.  I will have to post updates through the comment section for now until the edit function gets fixed."

My main computer with the CBDA files is offline until I can pick up a linksys wireless n USB stick.   I installed a new, quiet fan for my ati 5700 and found that I had to take out my wireless network pci card to get the vga card to fit back in.  I will be back to uploading later this evening or tomorrow evening.

Set 6 is going slowly.  40 more comics to update.  I did a nicely done scanlation of Dainty Daredevil.  I would scanlate DD tells about Kites, too. There are 5 one pagers in Set 6 that can be done in addition to the other 18 one pagers that I could scanlate with the European comics.  I just need to scan in some B&W comics from my CBL set 6 that is currently waiting for me at the closed post office today.

Fantagraphics, publishers of the Complete Peanuts collection,  has just posted a notice this week that they will start publishing Carl Barks comics in the fall of 2011!

http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2011/01/exclusive-fantagraphics-to-publish-the-complete-carl-barks/

* 2 books per year: 30 books in 15 years!
* original colouring
* comic book sized hard cover format
* Duck comics written and drawn by CB
with essays, possibly comic covers, and a few extras.

Unfortunately, this collection will not include comics like the Junior Woodchucks, Scrooge the First (drawn by Tony Strobl), the last 3 DD comics written by CB nor any of the non-Ducks CB work like Riddle of the Red Hat or the Barney Bear / Droopy Dog stories and definitely not any of the later stories or paintings by CB.  

I have mixed feelings on the original colouring that was done by Dell comics since most of it was badly done.  Susan Daigle-Leach is my favorite colourist for CB's art. Her work can be seen in the out of print CBL in Color soft cover grahic novel series published by Gladstone.   The colouring in Gemstone and Boom comics has been very fine as well.

I'm not sure if I will go for this series because I was just able to finish collecting the CBL by Another Rainbow.

Still working on Set 6.

PS
I have picked up the rest of the Better Little books and the Fair Fiasco for Set 12.

In two weeks, I can stop working full time nights and get back to this project.

Good news!

A. The color HC Barks Bear book is going to be released this May from IDW publishing!  Preorders are available on amazon.com!

B. Boom comics is finally reprinting CB and other classic Disney comics along with the European Duck stories in US, WDCS and DD series this year.  
That's how Gladstone was publishing the Disney comics.  The only problem would be to publish only enough of these comics as there is a demand for them.  From what I have read, in 1998, Gladstone comics became bankrupt due to switching from a direct comic dealership sales to public sales.  Gladstone printed more comics than could be sold.  
Last year, Boom comics had to scale back all the HC disney comics sales due to lack of interest, too.  The Fantagraphics CB series could create more interest in Disney comics for better sales.

C. I was also able to pick up 3 Carl Barks VHS documentaries on ebay.
1.  The Overstreet World of Comic Books
Short interview with CB
(60 minutes, 1994, OverStreet Publications
& Threshold Video)
2. The Duckman: An interview with Carl Barks 
by Thomas Andrae 
(90 minutes, Gladstone, 1996)
3. Happy Birthday, Carl Barks! - 
Carl Barks\' 95th and 96th Birthday Celebrations 
(90 minutes, Nineteenth Star, 1997)

I'll see if the DVD from www.duckbusiness.com is still available.

Does anyone have CB the duck maestro on VHS that they can convert to an .mkv video for sharing?  That would be round out the CB documentaries nicely for Set 12.

bye for now,

,sk9348392,2011-02-17T00:35Z,"Dear kaarma33,

I was trying to download the older sets of the CBDA, but there are no seeders for 1, 2, 3, and 8. Can you go back in seed for a while? I promise I'll stay in seed for a long time, once I've downloaded them. Thanks!"
,kaarma33,2011-02-17T09:39Z,"Hello sk9348392:

I can seed the full CBDA Set 8, but Set 1 version II,2,3 can only be partially seeded by me because I delete older versions of CBDA cbr comics as I update them.

So, I hope thta other people will check into piratebay from time to time to see if seeding can be done.

Otherwise, once I finish preparing Set 6 and scanlating some one pagers, I was going to read over each CBDA set and scanlate one or two longer low quality, old stories for new CBDA Set versions.  It could be months. 

In other Carl Barks news:

Boom comics is now doing Carl Barks reprints!

Donald Duck 363 ""somewhere beyond nowhere""
10 page version, Daan Jippes art 
WDCS 715 HDL Life Saver
Daan Jippes art
WDCS 716 DD A day in a Duck's life
Daan Jippes art, no need for me to update my scan in CBDA Set 2"
,kaarma33,2011-03-04T17:34Z,"CBDA Update:

Work in progress

CBDA updates:
19 one pagers for scanlation, 
Luck of the North (Boom version, Thanks JoJo!),  
A Day in Duck's Life  (DJ Boom version, Thanks JoJo!)
and some bonus stuff  

Set 6
a. 25 comics to trim
b. HDL comics will have mostly Daan Jippes art
and the redundant Tony Strobl versions will 
be available in Set 12.  I am also including 
Carl Barks line art for HDL comics as well.
c. 9 one pagers to scan and then scanlate from the Netherlands Duck comics

Set 11
a. I found a news reader set of files for an old version of the Barks Bear Book.

http://binsearch.info/?server=2&b=Barks+Bear+Book+color+remix+%28missing+Andy+Panda+from+New+Funnies&g=alt.binaries.pictures.comics&p=ChickenRU+%3Cdikvanduk%40kwek.nl%3E&max=250

Could someone download this Barks Bear Book and the share on bittorrent? That would save me a lot of time for scanning. Thanks!

b. While updating the covers section for Set 12 with Carl Barks Collection, I found that Carl Barks had contributed story ideas to 3 Droopy Hound stories.  
So, I found Tom & Jerry's winter carnival 2 and then I bought on ebay the other two stories found in Tom & Jerry winter carnival 1 and T&J summer fund 1.  I expect those comics to reach me by next week.

********
It's been a month since I bought the the 3 VHS Carl Barks documentaries and they have not shown up by mail.   Hopefully, the tapes show up soon or they could be lost in the mail.

I'm still looking for Carl Barks The Duck Maestro VHS NTSC english version."
,kaarma33,2011-05-10T00:31Z,"CBDA update:

I haven't done much with Set 6.
I've been too busy  and tired picking up work shifts to pay for a bunch of CB comics, etc.

Which means I can start scanning CBL in color one pagers and some older stories for updates.
Duck Maestro and other CB VHS documentaries are now being converted to DVD for upload to piratebay.

As well, scans of the original old DD and pirate gold and Pluto saves the ship comics have been found and will included in the next CBDA set. 

Boom comics have been doing a great job of publishing CB/Daan Jippes stories!  Only 6 more HDL Woodchucks, Pied Piper of Duckburg and King Scrooge the first need to be published in English.

,midnightculture,2011-05-31T04:28Z,hey kaarma33 I'm a bit confused. is this the complete library of the Carl Barks comics or just the cartoons and extras ?

This bittorrent is only the Ducktales and other miscellaneous cartoons.  The complete CBDA set is currently over 30 GB.
