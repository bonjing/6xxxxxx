Future Tense(1990)part 2 of evangelsim trilogy

Three of the most powerful evangelistic films ever produced!

In the late 80â€™s and early 90â€™s, Mars Hill produced 3 hard hitting, award-winning evangelistic films. Though they were produced a decade ago, these short films are still being used today because they powerfully present eternal truths in an incredibly creative and compelling way.

Future Tense:

When that day comes, there wonâ€™t be time to make a decision.
