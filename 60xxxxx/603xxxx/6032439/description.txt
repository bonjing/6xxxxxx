I downloaded this off youtube - its usually a good idea to download instead of just streaming since most good stuff is taken away/banned/hidden

If you try to load the youtube page you now get this error
"This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by SVT"

Whats interesting is that this is a conference in Sweden, August 25, 2010 and the two women who are now accusing Julian Assange of rape are in the room and visible on camera.  Anna Ardin and Sofia WilÃƒÂ©n.

From reading accounts online, its at this event that the woman in the shocking pink jumper who is taking photos up the front, Sofia WilÃƒÂ©n, first met Assange and later had consensual sex with him.

Whats even more interesting though is that its the day after the 'rape' accusation by the other woman, Anna Ardin, who can be seen in this video calmly walking around the room delivering a microphone to members of the audience who want to ask a question - not really how you would expect a so called rape victim to behave?  helping to facilitate a press conference for the person who supposedly raped you the day before?  but then in both cases the rape charge seems to have been invented retrospectively days after the acts of consensual sex between adults!!

No doubt this video has been taken off youtube because its just more evidence that could expose the smear campaign on Assange and the Wikileaks brand.

Thank you Wikileaks for delivering us from our crooked rulers!


Time to wake up people!!  Lets all unplug from the MATRIX!!!
