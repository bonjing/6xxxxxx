The Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs video game reunites fans with 
Scrat, Sid, Manny and Diego in an all-new quest based on the upcoming
film from Twentieth Century Fox. As the unlikely herd travels across
the tundra and beyond, they stumble upon another world - a lush 
Dinosaur World teeming with jungles, mysterious plants, fierce 
dinosaurs, wild new adventures and several new friends. 
Taking on the role of more than six playable characters, including 
everyone's favorite Ice Age friends and newly introduced characters, 
players master their unique skills and abilities across more than 
15 action-packed levels. 

In addition to the expanded features of the single-player gameplay, 
for the first time in an Ice Age game, players can team up with 
friends and family in eight competitive multiplayer mini-games.
