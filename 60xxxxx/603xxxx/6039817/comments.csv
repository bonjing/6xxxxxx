,some-young-guy,2010-12-14T18:30Z,"With the economy at a very volatile position, horticulture knowledge will be an asset one will wish he had if the bubble breaks.  I'm not a pot head either, but I've researched this in the past and do know with great certainty that Cannabis cultivation implements techniques a cut above the rest of the horticulture world as you get into the balance of exactly what Nutes goes into your soil or hydro solutions, lighting schedules to maximize yields and synthesizing other conditions to get the absolute best out of the plant.

Many of today's plants have been genetically altered to include the suicide gene which renders seed production worthless.  Imagine tricking a plant into producing other plants indefinitely and having them always think that they are still in the first generation?  Welcome to cloning.

I can't wait to watch this and adopt the techniques back into my quest for survival.

Appreciate the Upload. "

,elohmenohpee,2010-12-15T03:13Z,"@neonrainbow lots of things cause memory loss... alzheimer's causes memory loss.... dope doesnt nesisarily cause memory loss, i remember stuff from when i was 4 years old im 26 and been smoking weed for more then 10 years, allthough i have quit now. Plus certain things like soduku and memory and things that make you think expand your memory retention, not to mention that it has been proven  psyco-active drugs harden your mind and make you less suceptible to mental illness and other mind altering sicknesses, While alcahol is legal it also affects your mind in a bigger way that 'Weed"" could ever, Are you American? because that would explain how you became brainwashed."
