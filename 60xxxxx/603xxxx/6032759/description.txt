Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl (Samehada Otoko to Momojiri Onna)
is a 1999 Japanese film directed by Katsuhito Ishii and starring Tadanobu
Asano. It is based on a manga of the same name by Minetaro Mochizuki
which was originally serialized in Mister Magazine circa 1993 under the title
"Daisharin" (Big Wheel). The current title was adopted when the comic
was published as its own book.
