,umaly,2011-02-23T05:10Z,its normal that there's static in the background?
,panza32,2011-02-26T03:06Z,"Yeah, some tracks/beats are specifically made with white noise in the background because some people find certain pitches painful. it's normal and doesn't detract from the quality or the end effect of the beat in any way."
,cognaudial,2011-04-05T23:08Z,What's the kbps? I know that unless the audio files of a binaural beat is at least 320 it's not going to work.
,panza32,2011-04-12T04:08Z,"I don't know where you heard that from. All these beats are mixed between 128-320 kbps. Plenty of the 128 work great. Adrenochrome is a good example, it tripped me out. Furthermore, 128 is the highest bit rate iDoser offers them in."
,Rmm056,2011-04-12T19:13Z,What binuaral beat would I use for vivid dream? And how does it work? Would I listen to it before I go to bed or listen to it as I fall asleep? And what binaural beat should I use when I'm new to this? 
,Rmm056,2011-04-14T04:43Z,like what doses do you recommend for beginners? 
,panza32,2011-04-17T04:00Z,"Everything depends on you. Everyone's mind is organized and wired differently, and being so, I can't say which would work best for you. I know that originally, Peyote was the first that actually had an effect on me. I didn't feel anything until the third time I listened to binaural beats.

Read the included readme, it says exactly how to use them."
,Rmm056,2011-04-20T19:46Z,"Alright cool thanks and I was just wondering , when I'm counting backwards in my head I start to doze off a lot . Is that normal or am I suppose to prevent that? Sorry for the questions haha"
,nockjesus,2011-04-23T21:11Z,"can anyone help me? i downloaded it but then i saw that the icon was this stack of books(which i fucking hate with a passion). How do i get the mp3 files out>or is there something else im missing? 

please help me ive been trying to find bbeats for a long time now thanks"
,Rmm056,2011-04-25T07:30Z,To have to download winrar( google it) then right click (stack of books) and open it with winrar then you can drag the files out to your desktop or wherever you'd like
,panza32,2011-05-02T01:41Z,"Dozing off when you're counting is totally fine from what I know. Your brain is still being affected by the beats even if you're not aware or conscious of that fact. So whatever happens naturally, just roll with that. Everyone's wired differently. And don't worry about asking too many questions, I'm happy to help out."
,Rmm056,2011-06-19T19:34Z,I could never really find a straight answer to this question. Are binaural beats bad for you in any way? 
,cancerlighter,2011-06-26T22:58Z,"Ok, so I'm looking for something to improve my overall intelligence. I have done my research and found that gamma beats would be best for this (right?). I will definitely try the simulated high but are any of these aimed at improving memory and problem solving? Which ones? By the way, I have been listening to ""pure binaural"" beats in the gamma frequency from youtube. Is a ""Pure"" frequency better or worse or same?"
,panza32,2011-06-28T00:21Z,"Binaural beats are NOT shown, in any study, in any shape or form, to have any negative or generally unwanted affect on the human mind or body. They are COMPLETELY safe.

I'm sorry dude, but life isn't World of Warcraft, you can't simply 'increase your intelligence' like gaining a level in a game. Your best bet would just to do like some Sudoku puzzles or something, I've heard that can help. Binaural beats are not your answer. Truthfully, I only uploaded them because they're amazing to listen to high."
,Rmm056,2011-06-28T06:29Z,Hahahaha world of warcraft. My favorite game :)
,Brianxv,2011-07-12T22:25Z,"Lol, yay world of warcraft. 
seed please C:"
,Shlyriix,2011-07-24T05:17Z,"Every time I try to open the files in anything but Windows Media Player it either won't open or says it's a damaged or unsupported file type. I just want to put it on my iPod. Could somebody help me out, please?

Thank you!"
,Shlyriix,2011-07-24T05:48Z,"Never mind, I got them to open in iTunes. The only way I was able to do it was by clicking ""add file to library."" For some reason it wasn't letting me drag and drop or open them from Windows Explorer."
,SchismMax,2011-08-22T03:06Z,hand of god is CRAZY
,steelangel442,2011-09-14T06:46Z,You rock man Thanx
,nbt83,2011-09-25T19:41Z,"Thanks for the upload........wanted to ask are they all ment to be distortion noise and pitched frequencies? only asking as some idoser tracks ive heard before actually have a music beat behind them but these ones dont? is that still ok and will it work? any info would be great
cheers"
,Nilazarach,2011-11-05T17:55Z,"To claim that the sounds evoke a brainpattern that is experienced by *this and *that* is ridiculous!
No, I believe that to be possible, but I do not believe the creator of this can state so. In order to do it you need to first have a solid! base of subjects (for instance 1000) monitored who all have similar brainpattern reaction to e.g. DMT. Then you must find a way to find what sounds may produce that pattern, and test it on a solid number of subjects to see if it really does what it is supposed to. . .
HIGHLY unlikely that this has been done, ever.

I therefore loathe that the tracks have rubbish titles, rather than informative, telling which tracks are alpha, beta etc.  "
,Vortexed,2011-11-11T02:41Z,Unpacks as 1 big file which nothing will play. using win rar and vlc. Any help appreciated
,ZeoNoPay,2011-12-11T01:18Z,oh man thank you for the upload :) I'll let you know how it works out 
,ZeoNoPay,2011-12-11T03:05Z,BTW whats up with the .7z file format? I found a way to extract it but why go that route?
,ninjasam,2011-12-31T07:32Z,"thank you very much :)
i don't know how to upload torrents so i'm just gonna seed this through 2012.

namaste"
,Shrnz666,2012-03-15T10:57Z,"thank you very much bro gonna try it tonight!!!!
