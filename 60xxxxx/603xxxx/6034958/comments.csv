,hoddi1,2010-12-18T02:52Z,"Warning You Need Windows 7 And Windows media Player 12 To Open And Play This Thing.
If You D/L It from The Real aXXo File You Will Get The Real Thing !!!"
,hoddi1,2010-12-18T18:41Z,"Sorry sceneline but i did download and that is what i got so don't spread garbage that isn't yours to start with...
I went back to aXXo and downloaded the right one there and had no problems thank you..."
[V],catflap,2010-12-20T03:09Z,"THIS IS A FAKE!

axxo hasn't released a thing for almost 2 years.

although this MIGHT be the real film, it
is DEFINITELY NOT An AXXO FILE.

do not download anything from this person
or you take the risk of getting screwed with
trojans, viruses, or passworded crap.

ANY NEW FILM WITH AXXO'S
TAG RELEASED AFTER MARCH 11, 2009
IS A FAKE.

yes, this is A FAKE in the sense that
although it might be the real movie, it
is definitely NOT AN AXXO RELEASE.

you would know that if you had actually looked
on axxo's REAL website home. axxo does not
have - AND NEVER HAS HAD - his/her/their own
website, but calls home on an RG's website.

you would also know that axxo has not released a thing
for almost 2 years. any new film released with
axxo's tag after March 11, 2009 IS A FAKE. "
