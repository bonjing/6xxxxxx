I Like It When You Die is an Anal Cunt album, released in 1997 on Earache Records as MOSH 169CD. It contains 52 tracks, with the average track length well under a minute.

The album was the first with the new line-up of Seth Putnam, Josh Martin and Nate Linehan and was recorded in 1996 at Headroom Studios, just before the band's 1996 tour with Mortician and Incantation.

The album was originally titled You're Gay and the album cover was going to contain a mirror, but this idea was later changed. Instead, the record features a lot of songs with the word 'gay' in the title, as well as various insults. Nevertheless, only one song on the album provoked an official complaint and that was the song "You Went To See Dishwalla and Everclear (You're Gay)", about which the label American Records complained. [1].

The band's vocalist, Seth Putnam has also stated in interview that this is his favorite Anal Cunt full-length album [2], and this opinion is reflected by many of the band's fans, as shown by the fact that the album debuted at #12 in the CMJ Radio Trade Magazine Loud Chart, before peaking at #10.

There is a guest appearance from Kyle Severn, from the band Incantation, who plays drums on the track "Kyle From Incantation Has A Mustache."
