,some-young-guy,2010-12-12T06:00Z,"I hope this is not the data that WikiLeaks released prior to being shut down.  If it is, please remove this torrent as that info is not only a threat to those that the info is about, but it will also be grounds for the govt to demonstrate just how long their arm really is and sink the ship which would plain suck.

Please think with your head, not your heart."

,Ezel,2010-12-12T13:42Z,"WikiRebels â€“ The Documentary

Exclusive rough-cut of first in-depth documentary on WikiLeaks and the people behind it!

From summer 2010 until now, Swedish Television has been following the secretive media network WikiLeaks and its enigmatic Editor-in-Chief Julian Assange.

Reporters Jesper Huor and Bosse Lindquist have traveled to key countries where WikiLeaks operates, interviewing top members, such as Assange, new Spokesperson Kristinn Hrafnsson, as well as people like Daniel Domscheit-Berg who now is starting his own version - Openleaks.org!

Where is the secretive organization heading? Stronger than ever, or broken by the US? Who is Assange: champion of freedom, spy or rapist? What are his objectives? What are the consequences for the internet?"
,Ezel,2010-12-12T13:56Z,"Unfortunately this release has been ripped with a 4:3 format when the video is 16:9. The full image is there but it is 'squished' :-/

If one uses VLC as a player change the aspect-ratio to 16:9 (default hotkey ""A"") and you get the picture as it was meant to be!

Also: Language is english, no subtitles which is really rare for a SVT-release."
,Ezel,2010-12-12T13:59Z,"The aspect-ratio of the video is set to 4:3 which is wrong, it should be 16:9. The whole picture is there but it is 'squished'.

If one uses VLC to play the video, change the aspect-ratio manually to 16:9 (default hotkey A) to get the right picture.

Also: Language spoken is english, no subtitles. This is quite rare for a SVT-release."
,gshuck420,2010-12-12T23:05Z,"Really good interesting doc. I dont say it was produced to favor either side. Didnt know Wiki had such a positive idea on how to open the worlds eyes so clearly. Transparency is a must in any form of government or its just stalin russia and hitler germany, where unfortunately it seems like america is becoming more and more alike as every year passes. Go Sweden on your right to free speech laws and unblacklisted media."
