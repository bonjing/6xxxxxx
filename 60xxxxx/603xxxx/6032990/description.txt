[center]Notes -



Audio is best to date, i am sure there will be line at some point soon....however, i went and got the cam audio so ppl could watch it, Video is mint!! there may be some points where it goes oos slightly, but i cut every 10-15 min, so it will not be by alot, any one have a problem with this please feel free to sync it your self!

If any encoders do want the source let me know - you know where i am!

Please feel free to spread this, but please leave nfo as it is!
