NOTES
VIDEO:For Coloured Girls SCR DVD ......... Thanks LKRG
AUDIO:For Coloured Girls SCR DVD ......... Thanks LKRG

Well we was firstly given the vobs to this by LKRG, so many thanks to them :) All we did was do a decent rip of it and also when for a bigger size due to the runtime. The vobs had some weird interlacing that the normal ivtc doesn't fix properly, but we sorted that out :) Also done our normal tweaks to the video. The audio was just ripped from the vobs and muxed to our encode. Oh this also contains the normal property of text across the bottom .....every now and again.
