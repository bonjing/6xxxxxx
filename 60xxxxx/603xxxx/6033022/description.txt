Matt Murdock is the new leader of the Hand and has built Shadowland, a prison/temple constructed on the ruins of a Hell's Kitchen building destroyed (along with numerous lives) by Bullseye during the Dark Reign event. Murdock returns to Hell's Kitchen from Japan a changed man and seeks to utilise the Hand as a force for justice. He first deals with and battles Bullseye, who had escaped from the Raft, and kills him the same way that Bullseye killed Elektra several years ago. The street-level heroes begin to question Murdock and his methods...
