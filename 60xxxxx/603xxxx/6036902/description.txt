Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the seventh and final of the Harry Potter novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The book was released on 21 July 2007, ending the series that began in 1997 with the publication of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone. This book chronicles the events directly following Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2005), and leads to the long-awaited final confrontation between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort.
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published in the United Kingdom by Bloomsbury Publishing, in the United States by Scholastic, in Canada by Raincoast Books, and in Australia and New Zealand by Allen & Unwin. Released globally in ninety-three countries, Deathly Hallows broke sales records as the fastest-selling book ever. It sold 15 million copies in the first twenty-four hours following its release,[1] including more than 11 million in the U.S. and U.K. alone. The previous record, nine million in its first day, had been held by Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.[2] The novel has also been translated into numerous languages, including Ukrainian,[3] Swedish,[4] Polish[5] and Hindi.[6]
Several awards were given to the novel, including the 2008 Colorado Blue Spruce Book Award, and it was listed as a \"Best Book for Young Adults\" by the American Library Association.[7] Reception to the book was generally positive, although some reviewers found the characters to be repetitive or unchanging. The film is in two parts shot back-to-back: the first part was released in November, 2010, and the second part is to be released in July, 2011.

Epigraphs
For the first time in the series, Rowling placed two epigraphs at the beginning of the book. The first is a passage from the play The Libation-Bearers by the Greek playwright Aeschylus. The second is a passage from More Fruits of Solitude by the Quaker leader William Penn.
Dedication
All the books in the Harry Potter series have dedications. On the dedication page for this book, the unusual layout resembles the shape of Harry\'s scar.
Plot introduction
Throughout the six previous novels in the Harry Potter series, the main character, Harry Potter, has struggled with the inherent difficulties of adolescence along with being a famous wizard. When Harry was a baby, Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, murdered Harry\'s parents but mysteriously vanished after attempting to kill Harry. This results in Harry\'s immediate fame, and his being placed in the care of his muggle, or non-magical, relatives Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.
Harry re-enters the wizarding world at age 11, enrolling in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He makes friends with Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, makes an ally in the school\'s headmaster, Dumbledore and grows to respect and fear the talented misfit, his nemesis, schoolmaster Severus Snape. Presently Harry is confronted by Lord Voldemort, who is trying to regain physical incarnation. Returning to school after summer break, there are several attacks on students after the legendary \"Chamber of Secrets\" is thought to be opened. Harry ends the attacks by killing a Basilisk and defeating Lord Voldemort\'s \"memory\" stored in an enchanted diary. The following year, Harry hears that he has been targeted by escaped murderer Sirius Black. Despite stringent security measures at Hogwarts, Harry is confronted by Black at the end of his third year of schooling and Harry learns that Black was framed and is his godfather. Harry\'s fourth year of school sees him entered in a dangerous magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament. At the conclusion of the Tournament, Harry witnesses the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. When the next school year begins, the Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the new High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. After forming an underground student group in opposition to Umbridge, Harry and several of his friends face off against Voldemort\'s Death Eaters, a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In Harry\'s sixth year of school, he learns that Voldemort has been using Horcruxes to become immortal. Horcruxes are fragments of the soul that are placed within an object so that when the body dies, a part of the soul remains and the person can be regenerated or resurrected.[8] However, the destruction of the creator\'s body leaves the wizard or witch in a state of half-life, without corporeal form.[9] When returning from a mission to discover a Horcrux, Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster of the school and Harry\'s mentor, is murdered by Severus Snape, a teacher at the school with whom Harry is consistently at odds and who Harry has suspected of being a Death Eater. At the conclusion of the book, Harry pledges not to return to school the following year and to search for Horcruxes instead.
Plot summary
Following Dumbledore\'s death, Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gains control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to hunt and destroy Voldemort\'s remaining Horcruxes. They isolate themselves to ensure their friends and families\' safety. They have little knowledge about the remaining Horcruxes except the possibility that two are objects once belonging to Hogwarts founders Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff, and the third may be Nagini, Voldemort\'s snake familiar. The whereabouts of the two founders\' objects is unknown, and Nagini is presumed to be with Voldemort. As they search for the Horcruxes, the trio learn details about Dumbledore\'s past, as well as Snape\'s true motives.
The trio recover the first Horcrux, Salazar Slytherin\'s locket, by infiltrating the Ministry of Magic. They then find Sword of Godric Gryffindor, among the few objects able to destroy Horcruxes (having absorbed Basilisk venom), and they use it to destroy the locket. The trio continually encounter a strange symbol, which an eccentric wizard named Xenophilius Lovegood (father of Luna) tells them represents the mythical Deathly Hallows. The Hallows are revealed to be three sacred objects: the Resurrection Stone, a stone with the power to summon the dead to the living world; the Elder Wand, an unbeatable wand; and an infallible Invisibility Cloak. Harry learns that Voldemort is seeking the Elder Wand, but is unaware of the Hallows and their significance. The trio determine that finding Voldemort\'s Horcruxes is more important than procuring the Hallows. They break into Bellatrix Lestrange\'s vault at the Wizarding Bank Gringotts to recover another Horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff\'s cup. Harry learns that another Horcrux is hidden in Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the school and find the Horcrux, the Diadem of Ravenclaw, and also successfully destroy the cup and the diadem.
The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, their many allies, and various magical creatures, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle. Harry discovers that Voldemort inadvertently made Harry a Horcrux when he attacked him as a baby, and that Harry must die to destroy Voldemort. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort, who casts the Killing Curse at him, sending Harry to Limbo-like state between life and death. There, Harry sees Voldemort\'s destroyed soul shard, then meets Dumbledore who explains that when Voldemort used Harry\'s blood to regain his full strength, it protected Harry from Voldemort harming him; the Horcrux inside Harry has been destroyed, and Harry can return to his body despite being hit by the Killing Curse. Harry returns, the battle resumes, and after the last remaining Horcrux (Nagini) is destroyed, Voldemort is defeated.
Epilogue
The novel, the last in the series, closes with a brief epilogue set nineteen years later, in which Harry and Ginny Weasley are a married couple with three children: James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna. Ron and Hermione married and have two children, Rose and Hugo. The families meet at King\'s Cross station, where a nervous Albus is departing for his first year at Hogwarts. Harry\'s godson, Teddy Lupin, is found kissing Bill and Fleur Weasley\'s daughter Victoire in a train carriage. Harry sees Draco Malfoy and his wife (revealed on Rowling\'s website behind the door as Astoria Greengrass) with their son, Scorpius. Neville Longbottom is now the Hogwarts Herbology professor and remains friends with the two families. Harry comforts Albus, who is worried he will be sorted into Slytherin, and tells his son that one of his two namesakes, Severus Snape, was a Slytherin and the bravest man he had ever met. He adds that the Sorting Hat takes one\'s choice into account, like it did for Harry. The book ends with these final words: \"The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.\"
Rowling\'s commentary and supplement
In an interview,[10] online chat,[11][12][13] the Wizard of the Month section of her website, and during her 2007 U.S. Open Book Tour, Rowling revealed additional character information that she chose not to include in the book. The first bits of information were about the trio and their families, starting with Harry.
Rowling stated that Harry became an Auror for the Ministry of Magic, and was later appointed head of the department. He also kept Sirius Black\'s motorcycle, which Arthur Weasley repaired for him, but he can no longer speak Parseltongue after the destruction of Voldemort\'s soul fragment within him. She revealed that Ginny Weasley played for the Holyhead Harpies Quidditch team for a time, leaving to establish a family with Harry. She later became the lead Quidditch correspondent for the Daily Prophet. Ron Weasley worked at George\'s store for a time, Weasleys\' Wizard Wheezes, then joined Harry as an Auror. Hermione found her parents in Australia, and removed the memory modification charm she had put on them for safety. Initially, she worked for the Ministry of Magic in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, greatly improving life for house elves. She later moved to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and assisted in eradicating oppressive, pro-pureblood laws. She was also the only member of the trio to go back and complete her seventh year at Hogwarts. Rowling also said that Dumbledore\'s relationship with Gellert Grindelwald extended beyond mere friendship, that \"Dumbledore is gay, actually\",[14] and harboured romantic feelings for Grindelwald.[15] Voldemort, she said, was forced to exist in the stunted form Harry witnessed in the King\'s Cross limbo after his death, as his crimes were too severe for him to become a ghost.
Rowling also explained the fates of several secondary characters. George Weasley continued his successful joke shop and married fellow Quidditch player Angelina Johnson. The couple had two children: a son named Fred, in memory of his late twin brother, and a daughter, Roxanne. Luna Lovegood searched the world for odd and unique creatures, eventually marrying Rolf, a grandson of the famed naturalist Newt Scamander,[13] writer of Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them. The couple had twins called Lorcan and Lysander. Her father\'s publication, The Quibbler, returned to its usual condition of \"advanced lunacy\" and is \"appreciated for its unintentional humour.\"
Other character histories revealed by Rowling included that of Draco Malfoy, who married Astoria Greengrass and had a son named Scorpius. Percy Weasley married a woman named Audrey and had two daughters, named Molly and Lucy. Firenze was welcomed back into his herd, who finally acknowledged the virtue of his pro-human leanings. Dolores Umbridge was arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned for crimes against Muggle-borns. Cho Chang went on to marry a Muggle.[16] Neville Longbottom became professor of Herbology at Hogwarts and married Hannah Abbott, who became the landlady of the Leaky Cauldron.[17] Bill and Fleur Weasley had a total of three children, a younger son named Louis, and two daughters, named Dominique and Victoire.
In the wider wizarding world other changes included: Kingsley Shacklebolt became the permanent Minister of Magic, with Percy Weasley working under him as a high official. Among the reforms introduced by Shacklebolt, was the removal of Dementors from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were also instrumental in reforming the Ministry.[11] At Hogwarts, Slytherin House became more diluted and no longer held the title as the pure-blood bastion it once was, although its dark reputation lingered.[11] Voldemort\'s jinx on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position was broken with his death, and there was a permanent Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher appointed. Harry also is said to come to the Defense Against the Dark Arts class to lecture several times a year.[10] Lastly, Rowling revealed that a portrait of Severus Snape, who briefly served as Hogwarts Headmaster, had not appeared in the headmaster\'s office, as he had abandoned his post. Harry later ensured the addition of Snape\'s portrait, and publicly revealed Snape\'s true allegiance to Dumbledore.[11]
Background

Choice of title
Shortly before releasing the title, J. K. Rowling announced that she had considered three titles for the book.[11][18] The final title, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was released to the public on 21 December 2006 via a special Christmas-themed hangman puzzle on Rowling\'s website, confirmed shortly afterwards by the book\'s publishers.[19] Asked during a live chat as to the other titles she had been considering, Rowling mentioned Harry Potter and the Elder Wand and Harry Potter and the Peverell Quest.[11]
Rowling on finishing the book
Rowling completed the book while staying at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh in January 2007, and left a signed statement on a marble bust of Hermes in her room which read: \"J. K. Rowling finished writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in this room (652) on 11 January 2007\".[20] In a statement on her website, she said, \"I\'ve never felt such a mixture of extreme emotions in my life, never dreamed I could feel simultaneously heartbroken and euphoric.\" She compared her mixed feelings to those expressed by Charles Dickens in the preface of the 1850 edition of David Copperfield, \"a two-years\' imaginative task.\" \"To which,\" she added, \"I can only sigh, try seventeen years, Charles...\" She ended her message, \"Deathly Hallows is my favourite, and that is the most wonderful way to finish the series.\"[21]
When asked before publication about the forthcoming book, Rowling stated that she could not change the ending even if she wanted. \"These books have been plotted for such a long time, and for six books now, that they\'re all leading a certain direction. So, I really can\'t.\"[22] She also commented that the final volume related closely to the previous book in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, \"almost as though they are two halves of the same novel.\"[23] She has said that the last chapter of the book was written \"in something like 1990\", as part of her earliest work on the series.[24]

Jacket art of Scholastic (US) edition.
The launch was celebrated by an all-night book signing and reading at the Natural History Museum in London, which Rowling attended along with 1700 guests chosen by ballot.[25] Rowling toured the US in October 2007, where another event was held at Carnegie Hall in New York with tickets allocated by sweepstake.[26]
Scholastic, the American publisher of the Harry Potter series, launched a multi-million dollar \"There will soon be 7\" marketing campaign with a \'Knight Bus\' travelling to forty libraries across the United States, online fan discussions and competitions, collectible bookmarks, tattoos, and the staged release of seven Deathly Hallows questions most debated by fans.[27] In the build-up to the book\'s release, Scholastic released seven questions that fans would find answered in the final book:[28]
Who will live? Who will die?
Is Snape good or evil?
Will Hogwarts reopen?
Who ends up with whom?
Where are the Horcruxes?
Will Voldemort be defeated?
What are the Deathly Hallows?
Scholastic also hosted \"Harry Potter Place\"â€”a magical and interactive street celebration at Scholastic headquarters in New York City, where the first U.S. signed edition of Deathly Hallows was unveiled on 20 July 2007. The festivities included a twenty foot (six metre) high Whomping Willow, face-painting, wand-making, fire-eaters, magicians, jugglers and stilt-walkers.[29]
J. K. Rowling arranged with her publishers for a poster bearing the face of the missing British child Madeleine McCann to be made available to book sellers when Deathly Hallows was launched on 21 July 2007 and said that she hoped that the posters would be displayed prominently in shops all over the world.[30]
Spoiler embargo
Rowling made a public request that anyone with information about the content of the last book should keep it to themselves, in order to avoid spoiling the experience for other readers.[31] To this end, Bloomsbury invested GBÂ£10 million in an attempt to keep the book\'s contents secure until the 21 July release date.[32] Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway.[33] There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalmentsâ€”that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the seriesâ€”would no longer be a deterrent.[34]
Online leaks and early delivery
In the week before its release, a number of texts purporting to be genuine leaks appeared in various forms. On 16 July, a set of photographs representing all 759 pages of the U.S. edition was leaked and was fully transcribed prior to the official release date.[35][36][37][38] The photographs later appeared on websites and peer-to-peer networks, leading Scholastic to seek a subpoena in order to identify one source.[39] This represented the most serious security breach in the Harry Potter series\' history.[40] Rowling and her lawyer confirmed that there were genuine online leaks.[41] Reviews published in both The Baltimore Sun and The New York Times on 18 July 2007 corroborated many of the plot elements from this leak, and about one day prior to release, The New York Times confirmed that the main circulating leak was real.[40]
Scholastic announced that approximately one-ten-thousandth (0.0001) of the U.S. supply had been shipped early â€” interpreted to mean about 1,200 copies. One reader in Maryland received a copy of the book in the mail from DeepDiscount.com four days before it was launched, which evoked incredulous responses from both Scholastic and DeepDiscount. Scholastic initially reported that they were satisfied it had been a \"human error\" and would not discuss possible penalties;[42] however, the following day Scholastic announced that it would be launching legal action against DeepDiscount.com and its distributor, Levy Home Entertainment.[43] Scholastic filed for damages in Chicago\'s Circuit Court of Cook County, claiming that DeepDiscount engaged in a \"complete and flagrant violation of the agreements that they knew were part of the carefully constructed release of this eagerly awaited book.\"[44] Some of the early release books soon appeared on eBay, in one case being sold to Publishers Weekly for US$250 from an initial price of US$18.[45]
In Nurmes, Finland, a supermarket sold copies of the English edition as early as 19 July, apparently owing to a misunderstanding on the part of an employee.
Price wars and other controversies
Asda,[46][47] along with several other UK supermarkets, having already taken pre-orders for the book at a heavily discounted price, sparked a price war two days before the book\'s launch by announcing they would sell it for just GBÂ£5 a copy (about US$8). Other retail chains then also offered the book at discounted prices. At these prices the book became a loss leader. This caused uproar from traditional UK booksellers who argued they had no hope of competing in those conditions. Independent shops protested loudest, but even Waterstone\'s, the UK\'s largest dedicated chain bookstore, could not compete with the supermarket price. Some small bookstores hit back by buying their stock from the supermarkets rather than their wholesalers. Asda attempted to counter this by imposing a limit of two copies per customer to prevent bulk purchases. Philip Wicks, a spokesman for the UK Booksellers Association, said, \"It is a war we can\'t even participate in. We think it\'s a crying shame that the supermarkets have decided to treat it as a loss-leader, like a can of baked beans.\" Michael Norris, an analyst at Simba Information, said: \"You are not only lowering the price of the book. At this point, you are lowering the value of reading.\"[48]
In Malaysia, a similar price war caused controversy regarding sales of the book.[49] Four of the biggest bookstore chains in Malaysia, MPH Bookstores, Popular Bookstores, Times and Harris, decided to pull Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows off their shelves as a protest against Tesco and Carrefour hypermarkets. The retail price of the book in Malaysia is MYR 109.90 (about GBÂ£16), while the hypermarkets Tesco and Carrefour sold the book at MYR 69.90 (about GBÂ£10). The move by the bookstores was seen as an attempt to pressure the distributor Penguin Books to remove the books from the hypermarkets. However, as of 24 July 2007, the price war has ended, with the four bookstores involved resuming selling the books in their stores with discount. Penguin Books has also confirmed that Tesco and Carrefour are selling the book at a loss, urging them to practice good business sense and fair trade.[50]
The book\'s early Saturday morning release in Israel was criticised for violating Shabbat. Trade and Industry Minister Eli Yishai commented \"It is forbidden, according to Jewish values and Jewish culture, that a thing like this should take place at 2 a.m. on Saturday. Let them do it on another day.\"[51] Yishai indicated that he would issue indictments and fines based on the Hours of Work and Rest Law.[52]
Publication and reception

Critical response
The Baltimore Sun\'s critic, Mary Carole McCauley, praised the series as \"a classic bildungsroman, or coming-of-age tale.\" She noted that the book was more serious than the previous novels in the series and had more straightforward prose.[53] Furthermore, reviewer Alice Fordham from The Times writes that \"Rowlingâ€™s genius is not just her total realisation of a fantasy world, but the quieter skill of creating characters that bounce off the page, real and flawed and brave and lovable.\" Fordham concludes, \"We have been a long way together, and neither Rowling nor Harry let us down in the end.\"[54] New York Times writer Michiko Kakutani agrees, praising Rowling\'s ability to make Harry both a hero and a character that can be related to.[55]
Time magazine\'s Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Fiction Books of 2007, ranking it at #8, and praising Rowling for proving that books can still be a global mass medium. Grossman compared the novel to the earlier books in the series thus: \"This isn\'t the most elegant of the Potter volumes, but it feels like an ending, the final iteration of Rowling\'s abiding thematic concern: the overwhelming importance of continuing to love in the face of death.\"[56][57] Novelist Elizabeth Hand agreed that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows caps off the series, but also made the criticism that \"...the spectacularly complex interplay of narrative and character often reads as though an entire trilogy\'s worth of summing-up has been crammed into one volume.\"[58]
In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of the Christian Science Monitor says that, \"There is much to love about the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly realised magical world to its multilayered narrative,\" however, \"A story is about someone who changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn\'t change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow.\"[59] In the 12 August 2007 New York Times, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that \"Rowling has won imperishable renown\" for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling\'s use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are \"abysmally long\", and that Voldemort \"becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain.\"[60]
Stephen King criticised the reactions of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work.[61] He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers time to read and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that the subject matter of the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.
