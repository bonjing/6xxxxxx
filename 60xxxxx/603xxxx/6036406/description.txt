Dijon Shariff Thames (born July 17, 1991), better known by his stage name Mann is an American rapper, singer, songwriter.

Art thrives on new voices. Music, in particular, tends to take major steps forward when emerging acts arrive on the scene with a fresh perspective. Emerging from Los Angeles is Mann, an 18-year-old rapper wise beyond his years whose fresh, positive, inspiring outlook on life provides his debut album, Mannâ€™s World, with a remarkable vibrancy. â€œItâ€™s a young world,â€ Mann says. â€œItâ€™s about being young and enjoying life. Right now, our world is so down and so negative because of whatâ€™s going on. My world is the opposite of that. My world, everything is on the up and up. I appreciate everything that I have and everything that Iâ€™ve gone through to make it to where I am today. The world needs an outlet and the kids need an outlet to be happy. I feel like I can do that with my music.â€
