\\\"It\\\'s not human and its got an axe.\\\" (sic)

 The summer between high school graduation and college, six friends hike into a remote forest high in the Colorado Rockies - the boys to climb the infamous Suicide Peak; the girls to be with their boyfriends and enjoy the sun and camping. But something lives deep in the forest, some terrifying relic of a horrifying tragedy that happened thirty years before - and it\\\'s out to hunt them down, to trap and kill them one-by-one until its purpose is fulfilled. A purpose so shocking it will haunt you for days. \\\"
