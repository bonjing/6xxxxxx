,Saki33,2011-01-02T05:23Z,"Thanks very much for the upload. I love this film. I first saw it on late night tv in the US back in the 50's. Years later I found it on VHS, but was disappointed that some scenes were missing, including the exquisite final scene on the train. The original French was 114 mins, so this one won't be complete either, but still longer than the US version on DVD. After the download finishes I will be able to comment about the quality. It is downloading very slowly. As so often happens with very large files, too many leeches are not sharing 100%. There are only 9 online now. I will do my part seeding it and I hope more of you will too."
