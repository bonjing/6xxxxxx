         When city slickers the Muppets join the ultimate            
       country boy for a camping trip in the scenic mountains        
       of Colorado, the Muppets adjust to outdoor living             
       while John Denver serenades them with his beautiful           
       music. With the clear blue skies, mountain streams            
       and wild animals roaming free, they all share the             
       wonderful experience of being out in nature with              
       friends. And what better way to end the day than              
       to sit around the campfire and sing songs and tell            
       stories together!

         In the second of their two specials together, John          
       Denver once again teams up with the Muppets - likely          
       the only time we will ever see Muppets camping! With          
       yet another Grammy-nominated soundtrack, there's              
       plenty of music here, but also quite an entertaining          
       story.                                                        
                                                                     
         Note that the DVD edition was marginally cut                
       following John Denver's 1997 death in a plane crash.          
       Originally there was a plane sequence with him and            
       Rowlf the Dog, which was cut for sensitivity reasons.         
       Some have questioned this decision however, since like        
       JFK Jr. who would die in another plane crash two years        
       later, he was in fact very fond of flying. To honor           
       this we have included the clip from an old VHS as an          
       extra, so you can enjoy it in its entirety. The first         
       few seconds are from the DVD, to more easily put it           
       into context.                                                 
                       Enjoy!

                 For the month of December we've decided to      
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent       
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and          
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings       
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.             
                                                               
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing     
         you new titles from the archives, including     
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips     
      and behind the scenes footage, from every     
          type of source available to us. Our goal        
        is to provide real insight into the vast       
     output of one of the greatest story-          
     tellers of the 20th century, and the         
           many talented performers and enablers       
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.      
                                                 
                    Sit back and join us as we go looking      
                  for the rainbow connection, and remember    
               to check back daily. We'll be listing them     
                       here as we go!
