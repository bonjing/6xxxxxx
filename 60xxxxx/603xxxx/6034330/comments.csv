,IngesFingers,2010-12-13T02:13Z,"After a quick scan through on VLC this release looks decent for a cam. The movie is complete, minus end credits. Audio is much much better than previous releases, though it appears to be very slightly out of sync for a short while early on.
V=6
A=6"
,Pingsterness,2010-12-13T03:42Z,"Judging by the sample, my god it looks good. Will see what the rest of it looks like, if the quality stays the same, seen DvDrips of worse quality. If it stays, truly a good 7-8.5/10 judging it by DVDRIP standards. Cam/TS? 10/10. "
,Mast3rShak3,2010-12-13T06:33Z,"Best Cam i have ever seen

11 Vid
11 sound"
,Pingsterness,2010-12-13T08:12Z,"Just watched it; video is good 9, audio is 8, it's out of sync now and then, specially at the beginning when it craps out for a moment as well. Other than that, definitely watchable, as good as DVDRips get :) "
[T],Smokey9t9,2010-12-13T11:01Z,I can't believe this is a TS. The quality is awesome. Not far off some DVD rips. I'm a trusted uploader with a fancy coloured skull so you'd better believe what I write even if you don't believe anyone else.
,etner24,2010-12-13T16:17Z,amazing quality for TS
,rawluck,2010-12-13T17:36Z,Great piece of work.

,psully,2010-12-14T00:20Z,fucking wank downloaded and ofter ages 1 min trailer
,OFFSMACK,2010-12-14T01:39Z,"Bravo! Froggie100, Nicely done, a very respectable upload for this Holiday season. To The poohpahs and naysayers, HUMBUG, they wouldnt know a good release if it bit em on the Backside. So as Tiny Tim said, ""God Bless Downloads Everyone!"""
,wayneking,2010-12-14T03:51Z,"you'll never find a cam too much better than this.  On my 16inch HD screen this looks like a DVD rip.

Amazing UL.  THANK YOU!!!!!"

,zorak1,2010-12-14T21:18Z,"Thanks works great, Kids loved this movie."
,ju5t,2010-12-15T00:30Z,"Really the best cam I have ever seen if the person who did this could be traced i would love to ask them what type of camera they were using if not for the slight blurs during fast movement i would not have even known it was camera once you get past the first few minutes the sound is sync and very well 
for a camera V/10, A/10 excellent viewing  "
,soupcip,2010-12-15T02:14Z,"I agree with the above.WOW what a cam this is.
Indeed this should be the standard for camrips from now on ;)
Really great work.
Besides a little image ghosting from the cam and a few minor imperfections in sound, its r5 quality.
The one who recorded the cam should consider him/herself awesome !"
,andykent1,2010-12-16T13:20Z,"By far the best cam ever, you really wouldnt notice the difference between cam and dvd apart from  a couple of very small edits, this is definately the new standard for cams to be compared too"
,andykent1,2010-12-16T13:23Z,if u can get a copy of tron legacy as good as that  i think youll break the dl records fo pirate bay lolz a 10 v 10 m 10

,ste003,2010-12-19T00:19Z,"i spent 3 hours downloading this file too find out its not a movie

,soupcip,2010-12-19T15:50Z,"Don't state that there is no movie, if the problem is you are obviously a noob(no offense).
the movie is in rar cabs, unpack the first .rar file and you're set."
,blombardo,2010-12-29T22:04Z,"For a CAM = a10 v10  Comparing to a DVD - A7 v7  Great copy. The full torrent name looks more like "" TS XViD - IMAGiNE (atomicbytes.me.uk)""  This is identical to the ""TS XViD AC3  LKRG"" version: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6035455/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_-_The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader_TS_LKR"
