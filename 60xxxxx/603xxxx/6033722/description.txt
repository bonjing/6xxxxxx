Progressive enhancement is an approach to web development that aims to deliver the best possible experience to the widest possible audience - whether your users are viewing your sites on an iPhone, a high-end desktop system, a Kindle, or hearing them on a screen-reader, their experience should be as fully featured and functional as possible.

Designing with Progressive Enhancement is a practical guide that both explains the principles and benefits of progressive enhancement, and explores detailed examples to teach you how, where, and when to implement specific coding and scripting approaches that embody broadly accessible development practices.
In this book, you'll learn:

    * Why common coding approaches leave users behind, and how progressive enhancement is a more inclusive and accessible alternative
    * How to analyze complex interface designs, see the underlying experience that will work everywhere, and add enhancements safely
    * A unique browser capabilities testing suite that helps deliver enhancements only to devices that can handle them
    * Real-world best practices for coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to work with progressive enhancement, and cases where forward-looking HTML5 and CSS3 techniques can be applied effectively today
    * How to factor in accessibility features like WAI-ARIA and keyboard support to ensure universal access
    * Detailed techniques to transform semantic HTML into interactive components like sliders, tabs, tree controls, and charts, along with downloadable jQuery-based widgets to apply directly in your projects
