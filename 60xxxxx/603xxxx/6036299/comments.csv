,Azakura,2010-12-15T02:56Z,"Does anyone else have an issue with the game taking a long time to load later on? I checked my save files and they are almost 1gb each (about 700mb). I don't have my old EU3 installations so I can't tell if this is normal but it definitely takes a long time to load a save and for an auto-save to save.

I tried using this as an expansion and stand-alone. Same issue either way. Anyone else having this problem or know how to solve it?

Btw, my computer is pretty good and I have my own computer repair service business so i'm not bad with computers or anything."
,Num13ers,2010-12-15T03:10Z,"It works. Just extract the files to your EUIII folder and then run the setup.bat file.

It should be noted that Divine Wind has higher graphics requirements. If you're having trouble getting a game to load, it may be because your computer is no longer capable of playing the game."
,Azakura,2010-12-15T03:23Z,"I said that the problem only occurred later on when I had more save games. My computer is able to run the game twice at least just fine. 

My computer is 4gb ram, dual core 2.8 and Geforce 9800gt so I know it's not a hardware issue. My drivers are kept up-to-date and my registry/driver is all clean and good. 

No idea what the problem is."
,Azakura,2010-12-15T03:26Z,"Also, the only problem is that it takes a couple minutes to save and then about 30-60 seconds to load. At first it would save in 5-10 seconds, it's just too long to save now."
,Azakura,2010-12-15T03:47Z,"I started a new game as Korea, it saves really fast now. I'm not sure if it's just because I was a Japanese Daimyo or if it's because it was later in the game. Will find out tonight."

@KaiseRiSultan
How do you reckon buying a game keeps it from crashing?"
,Num13ers,2010-12-15T07:26Z,"It should ALSO be noted that the game requires EUIII Complete Edition + HTTT expansion.

Divine Wind also requires pixel shader 3.0 support, while previous versions required only 2.0."
,Azakura,2010-12-15T07:31Z,"I found out the issue, my saves were 700mb (no one would even tell me if those were normal sizes or not) and as I suspected they were too large. Make sure you install this over the newest EU3 Complete/HTTT version so you don't experience any issues as I did. My new saves are now a good 7-10mbs which only takes a couple seconds to save/load."
,Babri,2010-12-15T11:37Z,Thank you so much. It works perfectly.
,DelaBoucle,2010-12-15T14:59Z,"@ Num13ers
My radeon HD 3850 does actually support pixel shader 4.1, so that shouldn't be a problem. Installing DW on top of my installation of EUIII+HTTT (as I did from the very beginning) doesn't make any difference."
,greed111,2010-12-16T01:10Z,"Guys, what patch version do you use? The one from april? Maybe there's an updated patch and thats why we had that loading scenario problem? I cant check it out cos I'm not able to use my laptop for a few days now. Hopefully someone will find a solution."

Yeah, I finally figured it out and managed to install the game. Apparently in Win 7 you need to grant the whole Eu3-folder full rights (to install/uninstall etc.) through folder's ""Properties"". That worked for me. 

Good luck! "
,EPDJ,2010-12-21T19:35Z,"Wow... someone on the net was actually right =o

Goldste1n is 100% correct though, if you give full permission to the folder, the BAT will work and install the game properly for W7(I hate this OS..).

I was waiting for a proper release from skidrow or reloaded, but since this works.. I might as well play a couple games. 

Enjoy~"
,spirinaite,2010-12-21T19:55Z,"I've tryed to give the EU3 folder permissions before, but still no luck. It says it can't find *.ogg files. I've looked in the sound folder and there are no *.ogg only *.wav"
,EPDJ,2010-12-21T20:28Z,"Spirin, try giving permission for all accounts and move every file into the eu3 folder(make sure the unpacker is there too, it sometimes won't copy over). I also put all of the .00-36 files in there as well.

If it doesn't work, try starting with fresh eu3 + HTTT files. I had to delete my copy of the game and start fresh to get it to work(instead of reinstalling, I duplicated the game files).

It certainly works though."
,fujikazu,2010-12-23T20:00Z,"You DO NOT need HTTT at all. The files will be 1 NFO file, .c00 to .c35, and the zip(.ace in 'properties') file. Right click the zip and pick one of the extract options, I used WinRAR archiver but also have 7-zip. Usually no need for 7-zip. DO NOT DELETE the zip files until you have used the setup.bat!! Or else, you will be left with only the text file as the setup.bat uses the files to unpack. You can delete the zip files after unpacking. I unpacked in a seperate folder from my HTTT install and as this says it is STANDALONE. Admins should not need to change any permissions on folders as they already have full control. I have Win7-32 bit and everything is fine.

This DOES NOT copy over to previous install folders(IN, HTTT) nor is it supposed to do so. It unpacks right where the setup.bat file is. Remember there is no need to have ever installed any previous version of this game for this download. If this got any clearer you couldn't read it.  S...T...A...N...D...A...L...O...N...E"

,DelaBoucle,2010-12-27T15:40Z,"@fujikazu

As for me and the other guys who get ctd's when starting a scenario, the problem isn't due to any standalone/add-on mix-up. It just doesn't work for our systems, yet (still hoping for some hotfix)."
,ziamatt,2010-12-29T01:09Z,"This download works, but it takes forever to save and load games. At first it's fine, but as the save files get larger it takes several minutes to save the game, which means every in-game year I have to wait several minutes for the game to autosave.

,bryk,2010-12-31T11:03Z,"It works fine,thanks for the great torrent. 

This standalone version quite obviously does NOT require installation of he base game + all three expansions. 

@ ziamatt: this is a known problem that apparently has to do with the achievements feature that's been newly introduced. Deleting the content from the achievements folder solved it for some people."
,Rikeus,2011-01-03T17:17Z,"Thanks for the upload! At the risk of sounding like a complete idiot, though, while I understand that standalone means it can function without previous installation, does that mean it also incorporates the features of the previous expansions or is it just Base EU III + this expansion?"

So to actually quit I have to bring up task manager and end the process or use the error box. Happens most of the time but not 100%, didn't do it just now after I started and exited(w/o loading save) as a test.

As for save/load times, this one doesn't take any more time than the previous games did for me but I created/edited some events so now my game says because of altered files the achievements are deactivated or something like that.

What does take more time is when I click a save file, it takes a few seconds to load up the game map, more than it used to it seems."
,fujikazu,2011-01-11T04:30Z,"To correct myself, the game says it's because the save is from another user or is edited that the achievements are deactivated.

I assume that's because I was testing the events I brought over from HTTT with the console. I made them with IN and when I imported to the HTTT events, I had some ""localization"" problems according to the game."

I wouldn't know why you're encountering messages that say there is a trojan. It may have to do with the way the file works, it happens with pirated games sometimes. Although this game never gave me any virus message, I've DL'd/played others that have but that's just what happens sometimes even with perfectly fine downloads. Trainers are commonly detected as some sort of virus also. All I can tell you is ignore/turn off your antivirus and play or go buy a legitimate copy.

@pirate117
I actually tried that just a few minutes ago before reading your post. I noticed my save was getting unusually large for the last few games I played. Got notepad++ so I could open up a 600+mb save and deleted a large amount of useless lines with ""nr="". Took file size to 12mb and works fine."
