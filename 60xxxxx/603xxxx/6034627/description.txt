What we did was use SERENiTY TS release and did our own encode from that. All we did was make a small script containing resize,white balance,rgb eq,sharpness,chroma,brightness,contrast ect. had to remove about 4 seconds of dupe frames at 3 separate area's. we used 28 seconds of the cam audio from MTV (Thanks mate) to fill a void as well..and sync it to our encode. Enjoy
