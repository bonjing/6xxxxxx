def a fan of your torrents.   Keep em comin' in HD!"
,Citrus12,2011-04-11T08:39Z,"I'm running into a problem: the files are read-only, and I can't seem to disable that and VLC refuses to open them because it says the filenames are invalid. What am I doing wrong?"
,warfizzle,2011-04-13T19:59Z,"These aren't HD. They may have been ripped from a Blu-ray but each video file is only 700MB. Repeat, NOT HD"
,DieFaster25,2011-05-07T08:08Z,invalid file name??
,jeetbasa,2011-11-16T13:19Z,"The video quality is great and it's HD, repeat it's HD.
