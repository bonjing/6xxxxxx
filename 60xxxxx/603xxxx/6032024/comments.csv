But please: Name your torrents following bibliographic rules found in the front of every book you publish:

Author, Title, Edition, Year, Library

Most of your torrentz are already in my library, possibly I even have more.

So if I have to download your ten even more MICROSOFT OFFICE 2010 EXCEL TRAINING MANUAL [thethingy], catch up the novitiates and delete the rest this isn't very efficient

Thanks in Advance

Sincerely yours
