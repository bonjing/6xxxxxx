,bluecar5556,2010-12-17T06:36Z,"     Did you hear the shocking news?  According to  http://www.demandprogress.org  Glen Greenwald reports that U.S. Army Private Bradley Manning is being tortured.  Manning is accused of leaking unflattering information about the Afghanistan war to WikiLeaks, but hasn't been convicted of -- or even tried for -- any crime.
     Manning is being held at the U.S. Marine brig in Quantico, and according to Greenwald:

Manning has been subjected for many months without pause to inhumane, personality-erasing, soul-destroying, insanity-inducing conditions of isolation similar to those perfected at America's Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado:  all without so much as having been convicted of anything. 
     Torture is outrageous and un-American, demand fair treatment of Private Manning by going to the following URL :

To demand an end to Private Manning's torture and call on the Army to give him a trial or set him free, also go to this URL :
