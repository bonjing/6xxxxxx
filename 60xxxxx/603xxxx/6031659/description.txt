Just get this. Seriously. If you've ever liked any singer-songwriter track ever, 

then there is no way you won't like this. The best example of the genre by an 

undervalued master who's finally signed for a label that might help get his 

music out there, every sing is a real gem and is a culmination of where his 

preious work was taking him.
