,wck,2010-12-14T01:06Z,"the quality is NOT very good.

SergeantSpoon clearly hasn't watched it.

It's fuzzy as hell, especially in dark scenes. There's also some motion artifacting and audio cuts out for split second occasionally.

This proper needs a proper."
,DannOrly,2010-12-14T19:18Z,"joserenat0... hahaha... successful troll is successful... Before I downloaded I saw ""I still can't believe quinn was working with..."" and made myself not read the rest, then was confused the whole time when he didn't work with anyone lol. wck is right this is a little fuzzy, but it's better quality than the 550 mb file, and best of all it's FREE, so I won't complain. Thanks for the upload once again eztv!"
