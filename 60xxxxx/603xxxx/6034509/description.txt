ReleaseNotes:

L.A. Woman is the sixth and last studio album that the American rock band The Doors recorded with lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in July 1971. The album's style is arguably the most blues-rock-oriented of the band's catalog.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 362 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

A new version of the album, titled L.A. Woman (40th Anniversary Mixes) was released on March 27, 2007 on Rhino records. It contains two bonus tracks: "Orange County Suite" and the Willie Dixon-authored "(You Need Meat) Don't Go No Further". The latter track was the B-side of the Love Her Madly single and features Manzarek on vocals. The track "Orange County Suite" was not recorded with the other tracks on the album, the song is originally a Morrison solo vocal and piano recording with music later overdubbed by the surviving Doors.

Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,
HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality
of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!
