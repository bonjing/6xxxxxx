it's not a big deal but your listening to the same channel twice technically.

Still a great rip!! thanks :D"

Why would someone rip in mono, when the files are played on a stereo sound system?

Would be ridiculous to have sound coming from only one channel, no?"
[V],HMVinyl,2010-12-12T02:23Z,"Mono playes out of what ever is plugged into it, it will play out of both speakers."
