"Hana 'a'a Makehewa (Desperate Measures)"

It's Christmas in Hawaii, but instead of 
celebrating, Five-0 is negotiating a hostage 
situation when the man who killed McGarrett's 
father resurfaces. The murderer, Victor Hesse, 
threatens to detonate an explosive that he's 
strapped to Chin Ho's chest.

Enjoy :)
