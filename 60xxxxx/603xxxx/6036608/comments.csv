,kidroyal,2010-12-23T22:21Z,"Working great off a DVD-R and neogamma.

@brian1900 - One of our mics wasn't recognized by the game.  Also I don't know if this game can be played off a HD since it needs a MIC in USB0."
,elmonomario69,2010-12-26T16:48Z,With mic LEVELUP http://www.levelupworld.com/rockstar-mics.html it doesn't work.   if anybody has a worrkarround to fix this.. please comment. the game works but not with any mic
,mojobaby27,2010-12-28T02:35Z,"You have to use a rockband or Guitar hero mic, my generic mic wouldn""t work either. Got a GH mic and worked no prob. $6 incl ship ebay."
,pos1al,2010-12-29T00:41Z,"I cannot get this game to boot, am I misssing something?  I've burned to disc and used a usb loader, anyine who has gotten it to work, could you please explain how you did it.  Using neogamma and wiiflow with ios 249 rev 20"
,impuls3,2010-12-31T17:33Z,"@pos1al

did you try running it with ios222 or 223? Usually that will get the mic to work also."
,cherryrussell,2011-01-01T03:19Z,"Hi, I have the same problem cannot get the game to boot and have tried iso 222 and 223 all I get is a blank screen using usb loader, using the disk it wants to update the system which usually overrides the usb loader and have to reinstall the system from the sd card again and back to square one.  "
,cherryrussell,2011-01-01T06:51Z,Correction The game dumps code and stops with a screen full of code not blank as stated
,pos1al,2011-01-01T14:50Z,I got mine working using wiiflow usb loader and ios 250.
,cherryrussell,2011-01-02T08:50Z,"Thanks, sorry still not working with Wiiflow and iso 250 and tried iso 222 and 223 but now i get a blank screen and no code dump."
,drydenm,2011-01-31T16:26Z,"IOS 250 and Wiiflow, Works Great. thkx"
