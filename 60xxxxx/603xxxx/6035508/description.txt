Toma Seikichi, 70, makes his living fishing from a small boat off the coast of Okinawa. He and his 12-year-old grandson Akira live in a small, tree-lined village in the northern part of the island which is surrounded by a white-sand beach and plots of pine and flowering bushes. On the cliff that skirts the shore sits an open-air burial ground containing the skull of a kamikaze pilot who was shot down during the last days of World War II. When the wind blows through the bullet hole in the skull, it produces a whistling sound. The locals call it the "Crying Head." It was Seikichiâ€™s father who brought the pilotâ€™s corpse onto the shore during the fighting, an event that Seikichi still remembers well. One day in spring, Shimazaki Kazue, 30, returns to the village with her son Masashi, 10. She has fled her abusive husband and has returned to live with her aging mother, Makato. Akira befriends Masashi, introduces him to the other boys of the village and shows him how to fish with a bamboo pole. Soon afterwards, Fujino Shiho, 70, comes to the village from the mainland of Japan. Long ago, the man she loved, Kano Shinâ€™ichi died as a kamikaze pilot during the battle of Okinawa and she has returned periodically to find what happened to his body. As his father had lain Shinâ€™ichiâ€™s body to rest in the burial ground, Seikichi stole a fountain pen that fell from the pilotâ€™s clothes and he still feels guilt about it today. Shiho pays a visit to Seikichi to ask him about the crying wind but he remains silent and will not respond. Meanwhile Kazueâ€™s violent husband has followed her to the island, and in defending herself, he is killed. Seikichi witnesses this act but doesnâ€™t inform the police, and, he takes Kazue and Masashi away from the village, down to the main city of Naha. Shiho decides to return to Tokyo and says goodbye to Seikichi. In the taxi, she quietly tears up the letter from Shinâ€™ichi that she has treasured all these years. She throws the small pieces of the letter out of the window into the sea. The fragments dance in the wind and some fall into the sea, but others ride the wind and are carried off far into the distance. Old Cut-Ear, a mysterious old man, standing outside his house looking up into the sky, blows a puff of breath at a pinwheel in his garden. As he does, the wind swirls around him and catches the falling fragments of the letter and sends them dancing into the sky. One piece flutters down next to the crying skull. On it is written the name Shiho, written long ago by Shinâ€™ichi. As it settles, the wind rises and from the skull that once lived as Kano Shinâ€™ichi the sound of the crying wind again begins to reverberate. The sound rings through the village and reaches Akira and the other boys at their fishing hole. In wonder, the boys turn their ears to the remarkably strong sound of the crying wind. Seikichi is standing inside the burial ground, the source of the crying wind. He has just buried the fountain pen in the cave, along with the knife that was involved in the tragedy that unfolded. He presses his hands together and prays to the skull, "Please watch over those," as large, white butterflies cluster and fly around him...
