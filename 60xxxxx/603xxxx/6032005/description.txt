Grip it and Rip It with John Daly in John Daly's ProStroke Golf
Featuring the unique and critically acclaimed ProStroke control
that allows players to craft and control real golf shots like never before

Sam Torrance and Peter Kessler provide lively commentary across 12 varied
and challenging courses, populated with interactive spectators to bring a
rich match-day atmosphere to life

Away from the tournaments and exhibitions gamers would expect from a golf
title, the Challenge Mode offers a series of golfing trials presented by
John Daly himself, as he takes players through the different disciplines of
the game, from putting and approach play to the world famous Long John drive
itself

With great control and realism, you can shape your shots and bomb down the
fairway just like in real golf. Beginners can hit good shots and experienced
players can hit great ones!
