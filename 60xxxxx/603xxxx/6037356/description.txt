SUMMARY:
Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker 
who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and 
can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. 
To say his life is "miserable" is an understatement. But one day while on an 
excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his 
life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound 
physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, 
shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric 
millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself 
and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to 
become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will 
kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of 
them will survive at the end.
