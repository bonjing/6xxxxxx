This is a self extracting exe file made in 7zip. Just click it and it will extract itself into the folder of your choice and you can start playing instantly, no install needed.

I actually uploaded the main launching exe file to jotti, just to show you that there is absolutely no virus inside of it!

There is the scan.

This has been tested online and works like a charm. For best multiplayer experience i recommend a program called gameranger. It makes you able to host online games as well as joining online games. It also eliminates any problems you may have when trying to play via LAN.
