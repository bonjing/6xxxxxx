,arebokert,2011-01-25T17:13Z,"@roardo1

When you start a game in aoe2 you have to turn off explorer.exe if you're running win7. Most people will probably tell you to dont do it, but it is still the only way. To turn off explorer.exe you just startup task manager and kill the process. When you quit the game you have to start it up again by going in to task manager and do file -> new task and type in explorer.exe and click enter."
,EpicFishFingers,2011-01-26T15:48Z,"Worked without even installing. Everything extracted to my Program Files fine (make sure to run as admin on Vista). Brilliant torrent. One thing though - as someone else mentioned, there's no sound in the cutscenes. But other than that, everything works just as I remember. Great torrent, much appreciated. The last one I downloaded was an ISO file that didn't even work once I burned it to a disc"

,arebokert,2011-02-01T17:27Z,"@gustavsjo

I don't know anything about the background music.

You should be able to start the expansion with the proper exe file, and if it doesn't work you could get a crack. you can find cracks all over the internet, so just search for it. "
,wakeupscreaming,2011-02-04T01:22Z,"Windows 7 as well. I have the screwed up colors. Turned off ""Explorer.exe"" and you can't click on the game to start it!"
,arebokert,2011-02-10T22:42Z,"@wakeupscreaming

Dude, you have to start the game BEFORE you turn off explorer. You alt+tab out of the game and then you turn off explorer.exe
After you've done that you alt+tab into game again.

This is one of MANY guides you can quickly find on google:

,Rimmer7,2011-07-24T06:25Z,The reason there's no background music is because the background music is played through the CD. The only way to get background music in a pirated version of this game is to download the ISO and either burn it to a CD or mount it on a virtual drive and disable your real drives since it plays the music from the first disc drive it detects. Kinda funny if you have some kind of music cd in the drive.

,weirdguy86,2012-05-11T11:07Z,"Thanks for the torrent. Couldnt find my old cds anymore so this came in handy.

One problem though. I'm trying to get conquerors patched with the unofficial UserPatch 1.1. This requires the latest official version 1.0c of the game. I downloaded the 1.0c from microsofts page but it won't work. It says ""retail version of the game is not installed on this system"".

What is the conquerors version in this torrent anyway? Is there some way in-game to check what version it is. There is a 1.0b readme in the folder but I dont think the game actually has this installed. For example the changelog on the 1.0e readme says the aztecs now get loom for free, but when I started a random game with them, you still have to research loom at the town center.

Any help?"
,arebokert,2012-05-12T16:29Z,"@Weirdguy86

One way of checking what version you are running is to startup a multiplayer game. Before actually starting the game, you can check your version number in the lobby by your name.

The reason for the patch not working is that the game is not installed. You only get the files and so the patch can't find an installation. You could try extracting the exe file for the patch and see if it is possible to copy the files directly into the AoE folder.  "
