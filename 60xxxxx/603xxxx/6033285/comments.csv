,MMorwen,2010-12-16T00:12Z,THANK YOU for compressing! And for keeping the list updated. :)
,bongman420,2010-12-24T09:42Z,"What's up with this torrent?  No file specified error, and magnet link shows 0 files when added to my client."
,Deevious9,2010-12-31T03:11Z,The .torrent file for this seems to be broken as well...  A shame!  I've been looking for a torrent like this for a while.
,Deevious9,2010-12-31T03:26Z,"Just wanted to let you guys know that while the .torrent file leads to a 404 (as of Dec 30, 2010) and the magnet file appears empty on load that the magnet file WORKS, it just takes a bit for the list to populate."
,dragon934,2011-01-03T18:13Z,"Hi, long time lurker, all the roms I've managed to complete have been fine with supercard 2, I'll be seeding it for at least 2 or 3 aswell once I've finished it at least (been on 64.4% for a while and struggling now)"
,Deevious9,2011-01-04T00:54Z,"I'm crawling along at 0-3KB/s and 64-65% completion as well.  I believe the only seeder is still the original uploader, though I am unable to connect to him.

Once I finish downloading I will happily seed for a few weeks at 2MB/s (that's bytes, not bits). :-)

BTW, kinda off topic as far as the torrent is concerned: Is there any standard as to the numbering of NDS Roms?  From all I've seen they vary wildly from site to site... Are any sites more inclusive than any other?

I saw the few sites the uploader suggested.  They all vary quite a bit, but I found the one he used for his numbering and it seems very thorough.  Just wondering if there are any that are more so (just wanna make sure I have a COMPLETE collection of USA NDS roms).


Thanks for the hard work, a2walonzo!  Much appreciated!"
,dragon934,2011-01-04T06:59Z,"@deevious9
I'm by no means an expert on this (been out of it for a while since my daughters dslite took a swim last year until I got her a DSi last week) I seem to remember quite a few variation and as such there is no standard, google ""universal numbering scheme ds roms"" and you should find a brief reason somewhere 
Though looking at other software in this torrent there seems to be an interesting file sorter/downloader which I haven't looked at before, not sure if its any good but an independant rom downloader would be great for keeping track on all the roms flying around! I'm sure someone can elaborate on this program"
,Deevious9,2011-01-06T20:41Z,"Yeah, no consolidated effort to keep the numbering congruent as far as I can see.


a2walonzo, any chance of you seeding this full speed for a couple days?  So far looking at the peer list everyone is stuck at 66.3% even after three and a half weeks. :-(

Like I said, I'd be more than happy to take over after I hit 100% considering you did the hard part of putting this all together. :-P"
,dragon934,2011-01-06T23:52Z,"I second that, seed it then once 2 of us have it, it can start populating exponentially (well kind of in a perfect world)"
,dragon934,2011-01-06T23:53Z,"Oops, I might have posted that a few times"
,dragon934,2011-01-17T19:14Z,"My patience has expired, I will support a more popular (if larger) torrent"
