Are you someone who gets bored easily? I have the answer. This type of training is my specialty and this DVD is just like a real personal training session with yours truly. I do this style of training at least twice a week and it kicks my butt. In saying that, I know that my mum can do this work out too, it is for everyone as I have covered every option. There are 5 circuits, each one goes for 5 minutes, so once you've done the warm up you can do all 5 or just 2, depending on your time. The more you do though, the better the results. You will work muscles you never thought you had and yet because of my methods of balancing the perfect workout, you will be surprised at how you can last the distance and do far more than you thought!
