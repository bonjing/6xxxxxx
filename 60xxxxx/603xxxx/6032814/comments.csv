Thank you for the great addon"
,baalika,2010-12-12T15:55Z,"Yay, thank you! Where on the internetz did you find this beauty? :)"
,aarque,2010-12-12T16:19Z,"Yes excellent rra137. This scenery is only out a few days and now we all can experience it. I doubt TPB will block anyone due to their affirmed open source stance. If you ignore the troll it will become bored and go away. It ""trolls"" for confrontation and to reply satisfies its perverse anti-social craving."
,rapterman,2010-12-12T17:13Z,Jimstalk stop been a  fucker wanker just because catshit is shag-in your dad you fucked up little mum shager

hahaha"
,OlaNordmann7,2011-01-01T12:01Z,"Thank you a lot for this excellent release, Iceland is very much needed for FSX!

faxafoli: if it's the Keflavik-airport you are
looking for, this is not included in this particular product from Aerosoft. The Airport will be released separate."
,BarrySoetoro,2011-01-03T01:11Z,"Doesn't work for me at all. No idea what the issue is... there's only 1 instruction. It's about the simplest scenery type to install.

No problems with any other scenery. No idea what the problem is.

Still, thanks for uploading. "
,merkava_bob,2011-02-04T21:35Z,"Hello I'm new to Pirate Bay
But in reply to faxafoli. What I found that I did wrong with the initial install was to add to the scenery in the wrong order, priority 1 and 2. 
I.e FSX\aerosoft\Iceeland X\Iceland X - priority 1 & 2 Folders. Folder 1 has highest priority then hey presto you get your autogen scenery of Reykjavik. Hope that this is of some help and guidance? Nice to meet you all"
,merkava_bob,2011-02-04T21:39Z,"Sorry forgot to say wonderful scenery package and much thankxx.
I was once stationed at Reykjavik and really loved Iceland."
,alexsig,2011-02-15T03:42Z,What is the trick to get this working? I install it in the right directory but it won't work for some reason. The manual is remarkably unhelpful.
