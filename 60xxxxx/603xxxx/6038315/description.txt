Fresh from his knockout bongo performance on Flight Of The Conchords, Todd releases his third full-length comedy album, this time touching on hard-hitting issues, from The Container Store to famous bass players, in his inimitable high-energy style. He's appeared on Letterman, Conan O'Brien, Carson Daly, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central's Friar's Roast of Chevy Chase, "Space Ghost Coast To Coast", and in his own two "Comedy Central Presents" specials. He also has numerous acting credits, has done cartoon voice work, and has done shows with The New Pornographers, Yo La Tengo, The Shins, Aimee Mann, They Might Be Giants, and Luna. Check out his previous releases, "Falling Off The Bone" and "Medium Energy", and look for him on tour.
