,press2010,2010-12-12T00:06Z,So here is a dumb question. What do you do with these. Do you direct windows to use them as a package to replace default system icons? Tia.
[V],thethingy,2010-12-12T01:12Z,"press2010, yeh you can, or google ico to dll then you get a free converter that will put all 118 icons into 1 small dll file that you can put in windows system 32 folder and replace your existing icons with."

,pneuma22,2011-01-04T18:52Z,Why would you use a .exe for this file if it were legit? If it were a legit file you just .rar the file and take ownership of the systemfiles that you want to replace icons for... This my friends makes no sense at all to allow and executable file to be overwriting and changing system files... No WAY!
[V],thethingy,2011-04-19T07:20Z,"pneuma22, the exe is just a self extracting rar, it overwrites nothing. "
