Jonny is from America, thatâ€™s for sure ... though he seems to live both in Nashville and Los Angeles at the same time; of course thereâ€™s a warm spot in my heart for him, as he was raised in Philadelphia.

Jonny lays down some blistering alternative country tunes in the vein of The Rolling Stonesâ€™ â€œCountry Honk.â€  He freely admits to his old school roots, even to his Dylanesque adventures, but let me assure you itâ€™s all about the process of building, and to that end Jonny Kaplan & The Lazy Stars are one of the hardest working bands out there.  Jonny seems to have effortlessly managed to capture a timeless feel for the seamy underbelly of life, making the darker side sound like the summer pulp fiction adventures of an outlaw on the run ... I mean really [!] a song entitled â€œSmoking Tarâ€ opens the album.  With his rootsy classic rock jangles on songs like â€œStill Lonely,â€ carrying a â€œSweet Janeâ€ riff that is guaranteed to roll over you all night long, and â€œGolden Yearsâ€ which will bring actual chills to your skin; all of the other songs are just enough off their axis to raise a smile from the grave of Gram Parsons.

This is one great piece of work that is hanging out there brilliantly, just waiting for you to discover it.
