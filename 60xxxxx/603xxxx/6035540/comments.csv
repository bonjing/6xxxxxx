Please seed.

Enjoy."
,weaping_reaper,2010-12-15T06:32Z,"Every episode is in AVI? Why not Matroska? or MP4?


             That shit is WEEEEEIRD!!!!"
,weaping_reaper,2010-12-16T01:50Z,"Been stuck @ 96.2 % for more than 2 hours, .. are you gonna seed this thing? Or should I just go on and give up now?"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2010-12-16T06:55Z,I've been seeding 24/7 since the last episode aired. I'll continue seeding for a long time yet. Are you uploading to others? You get priority on the pieces if you've uploaded the previous piece.  
,weaping_reaper,2010-12-19T05:25Z,"Yeah bubbah, I got it, Its a great torrent, still seeding @ around 70/kbs, but It's set on unlimited upload limit..



Thanks dude!"

@ihatethesun
wtf u talking about converting? the files are already .avi"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-09T09:17Z,"There are 140 seeds. There's no reason for a slow download. In preferences, make sure you can connect to a lot of peers. Mine is set at 200 the download should fly in. Probably worth ""Reset Bans"" in Utorrent, right mouse click on torrent and reset bans, then ""Clear Peer List."" You should be fine after that."
,Rmata07,2011-01-09T18:04Z,So these are all the seasons? 
,gjabsi_9,2011-01-16T05:04Z,im just downloading this for season 3 .. cuz no one else has a decent one lol 
,GrimeyMike,2011-01-18T22:19Z,"I am not usually one to complain seeing that we are all pirates in the same boat, but could someone please seed on this, i've been downloading in sections because the speed is far to slow to download a torrent this big, if people will seed i will continue seeding for a month after the download is complete, please help!!"
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-20T21:49Z,There are 191 seeds. Check your settings on utorrent. This is a super fast download.
,GrimeyMike,2011-01-20T23:13Z,"Yeah I have my settings on utorrent optimized to download as efficient as possible it's not uncommon for me to hit around 1 Mb/s, i just started downloading season 3 out of this torrent and i'm only getting about 12 Kb/s, though everything else is downloading as fast as usual :^(, i'm just glad someone has this uploaded, thanks Sniffer_V "
,BlitzSyn,2011-01-29T14:56Z,"Great torrent, but, it's kind of impossible to download it because hardly anyone is seeding it."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-01-29T15:16Z,There are 214 seeds.
,aminex,2011-01-29T18:38Z,Great torrent. Thank you
,dwest25,2011-01-30T20:34Z,"A lot of the episodes in @ least season 1 are corrupted, and won't play. "
,dwest25,2011-01-30T20:43Z,"Some of the episodes in season 1 (that I've tried to watch so far) are corrupted. The open, and then a few minutes into it, the screen garbles up, and stops. Try to fast forward to a different time, and it will to the same thing.

Sucks that you wait so long for something to download, and its corrupted. But thanks away - it is appreciated."
[V],Toilet_sniffer_V,2011-02-03T23:55Z,No they're not. They've been downloaded thousands of times and no one has ever said there's a problem. Nice try.
,tonym2112,2011-02-05T05:30Z,Thanks for the UP Sniffer. I will seed.
,petarst87,2011-02-07T21:41Z,seeeeeeed pls!!!
,Belila,2011-02-14T08:59Z,"Also having trouble with seeds. Yes, there's 420 (ha!) listed on my Bittorrent, but only five are connecting for some reason. I'm kinda of a newb bittorrent user, anyone have any advice to speed things along? Would rather not have to wait 5 weeks for one download, if it stays at 6kb/s, or 19 weeks when it decides to drop off again. Thanks. =)"
,resi10,2011-02-15T21:55Z,@Sniffer_V Thank you so much for this =)

,chefDL,2011-02-19T21:28Z,"Seriously, why is this so damn slow? I'm only downloading from 45 out of 200 peers...This better be good quality."
,chefDL,2011-02-20T21:14Z,Alright...Finally got everything downloaded. Took almost 2 straight days for seasons 3-5. But they look great. Play great on my PS3 too. Thanks for the upload.

Great torrent Sniffer, 30gb looks impressive. "
,WinterGr8,2011-02-24T00:10Z,"Uploading @25kbps as you suggested... Downloading @10-50kbps. Just trying to get the first season at the moment to see if I even like the show. Any other way to speed this up a bit? Most other torrents don't drop below 200kbps and usually run 250-380kbps for me. It's been going for over 10hrs now for 1 season. 

I'm not complaining, just wondering if i can speed it up at all. Thanks for the upload!"
,mavik12,2011-03-01T21:04Z,I just received a warning from my ISP. The only torrent that was tracked was this one so be careful.

,DmonHiro,2011-03-08T18:50Z,"What the hell is WRONG with some of you people? I downloaded the WHOLE torrent, all 29.52 GB in 7 hours. If you are getting shitty speeds, it's either your ISP, or your client settings.

,rahul_c,2011-03-10T12:29Z,Does selecting individual files reduce speeds?
,mav251,2011-03-10T14:21Z,"I really don't wanna complain hate it,but whats wrong with the seeds here,i am uploading at around 40 kbps but dl speed is only 10 to 15 kbps,n i have a net speed of 512kbps so when i say seeds suck...its serious this is the status,

,Cavi Mike,2011-04-09T05:36Z,I would have rather you had subtitles for the spanish spoken portions than the audiobooks and the rest of the 2Gb of fat you added to this.

I'm in a small town, and TW/RR are the only providers, so I don't want to get banned for TOS violation.  I've heard of anonymous torrenting, but there are so many different opinions and methods about it, I'm uncertain what to do .  So, do any of you have advice or thoughts on it all?  Thanks"

Same problem here, downloaded latest version of VLC and still have this problem, any idea's for a specific codec or something?"
,nittany,2011-07-09T10:14Z,"Damn, alot of people leaving comments that they got a DMCA letter from their ISP for downloading this.....they can't all be trolls making shit up so I guess I'll avoid this, other Dexter torrents on here have similar comments as well so I guess Showtime really wants people to buy this.

I was going to download this on usenet but I couldn't find anything like this torrent, most of the stuff on usenet is 30GB for just 1 season....I don't have the bandwidth for that."
,PryingOpenMy3rdEye,2011-07-13T21:06Z,"Hello Toilet_sniffer_V, thanks for the torrent. Downloaded it rather fast, don't know what all these whiny ass babies are talking about slow speeds....I averaged 500kbs throughout. 

I haven't found any ""corrupted"" episodes like all these assholes keep commenting about, probably just haters wanting to steer people toward their torrent.

Anyway I just wanted to say that these episodes dont exactly scream HD, at least when I've watched them on the laptop....I haven't yet hooked the laptop to the TV with an HDMI cord, but they just seem a bit grainy....is it just me? 

Anyway thanks again for all your work !"

As for this thing being watched, peerblock is blowing up the log with trackers, so just download peerblock or something of the like."
