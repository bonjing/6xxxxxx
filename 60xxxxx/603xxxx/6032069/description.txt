This is the full soundtrack from the movie Electra Glide in Blue, from 1973. It includes the song Tell Me by the late Chicago singer Terry Kath. For this song I also included a version without the intro talking of the movie for which this was written (since this was included in the OST). (I did that by cutting out the first minute or so with Nero). All files are in 320 CBR bitrate.

As far as I know, it never came out on CD but someone ripped it from vinyl and I found it on the internet, finally. Via piratebay tracking will be easier hopefully.
As you know, it was also the best song that the best tv series of all time, Miami Vice, choose out of all its episodes for its last, final episode Freefall.
Enjoy!
