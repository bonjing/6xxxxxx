I always use MKV2VOB for my MKV files and then play them on my PS3, yet when I do that with this file it freezes and won't play. You can fast forward a while and it will freeze on a different picture, while the whole time you can hear the audio. Did anyone else have this problem? But on the computer it plays and looks perfect! :)"
