,somi76,2011-03-04T19:48Z,"Tested, it really works, but there is one REALLY important detail missing here, which I found out after scraping several DL verbatims and googled for hours: before burning the maps DL DVD, you MUST set the ""Book type"" for the burning session to ""DVD ROM"" (default is ""DVD-R DL"").
I used DVD Decrypt to do this and burn the image.

andyTM: THANKS for sharing!"
,stalleyone,2011-03-16T10:40Z,"Thanks for the upload!

One question: Why is ""Unlock DVD MFD2"" required?  Why can't I just burn the image file to a DVD-DL and stick it in my RNS-510?"
,somi76,2011-03-16T22:56Z,"As I know, the original DVD has some protection mechanism inprinted by the factory on it, which you cannot copy using a DVD writer. The software in your navigation system will check for the existence of this protection and reject any DVD which doesn't have it. The patch alters the software to not reject the protection-less DVDs."
,stalleyone,2011-03-22T22:18Z,Could somebody post a torrent for the RNS-510 DVD? That would be much appreciated! I'll gladly seed as much as I can.

,a389,2011-04-08T07:08Z,"Hi!

I have tried it and did not work!

I've wrote the 2 firmware file to a CD-RW. The 1st CD made the firmware upgrade (was not necessary due to version was same as on the car's MFD, but it was finished successfuly after 40mins.). After I've took the 2nd CD, I saw that 2 lines for about half a second, then the MFD wrote: ""The navigation system is being activated"" , then ""incompatible DVD"". Then I took the Verbatim DVD+R DL with the navi data written with 2.4x speed. It said: ""Incompatible DVD, please insert a Volkswagen navigation DVD"". What somi76 wrote about this Book Type setting with DVD Decrypter, I've could not change the setting from DVD+R DL to DVD-ROM, due I did not have any offerings by the software. I use Pioneer DVR-215D with 1.22 (latest) revision.

What went wrong?

Thanks for help!"
