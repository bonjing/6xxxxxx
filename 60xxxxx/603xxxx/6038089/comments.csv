 and the PATH TO APPLICATION, go to your program files and Daemontools and select your daemon tool.exe file, or maybe its called DTLite.exe, select that one for path to application."
,xhavoc2,2011-01-03T17:19Z,"C, Press CLOSE and go to the create profile and press next to create a profile.

D,,  Now for APPLICATION, browse and go to programfiles/fireflystudios/stronghold 2/stronghold.exe ( meaning where you installed your game, go select its EXE file, where you start the game.)

E, Press next,  and you will see it asks for image mounting softare, change it to daemon tools or alcohol 120 (if you have it installed) 

F,  for backup image, select the NEEDS EMULATION.mds  FILE which is in your crack-patch folder in download folder.

Press NEXT NEXT NEXT AND FINISH.
STEP 10, 
Go to your hide emulation folder and you will see antisecurom 2 files, name antisecurom (i dont know what they do, just copy and patch in your installation folder of stronghold 2)

now use the PROSTOP and open it, Click hidden and CLOSE IT, REMEMBER to CLOSE IT or game wont start..
SO OPEN PROSTOP, PRESS HIDDEN AND CLOSE IT.

Now load the STRONGHOLD2 Disc2 1.4.1 from crackpatch folder on to your DAEMON TOOLS software like you normally would. and start the game using stronghold 2.exe on desktop, 
if error occurs then, close and start using   playstronghold2.exe on desktop"
,C559,2011-01-16T10:42Z,"I followed the steps twice and still having problems.

Pro Stop seems to not find anything to hide and says ""nothing to hide"", is there a specific folder it has to be in?"
,grantkemp,2011-01-19T21:03Z,"I get the same error ""nothing to hide"" any ideas?"
,Caiuscro,2011-02-03T01:21Z,"just install daemon tools LITE, instead of DT PRO and it will work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (and dont forget to change in cureROM the path for DT LITE)."
,gigebaba,2011-02-08T00:56Z,heeyy . little problem when i start to play the graphic is sooo white the brighness is sooo sooo high ! what to do ?
,bannoura1,2011-03-10T23:18Z,"Step 8 is a bit confusing, are you saying open all 3 rar files? then what?
And in steps a,b and c . at one point you have to uncheck a box to be able to change it to deamon tools at the next step.

and step 10 doesn't make any sense, i could'nt figure it out ""Go to your hide emulation folder and you will see antisecurom 2 files, name antisecurom (i dont know what they do, just copy and patch in your installation folder of stronghold 2)""

none of that is there.....
"
,undergrounddisciple,2011-03-16T01:21Z,"i've tried 3 times doing exactly what you said and i still get ""original disc could not be found or authenticated""
i think it has something to do with pro stop not finding anything to hide and saying ""nothing to hide""

anyone find a solution to this?"
,Erx31,2011-03-22T21:44Z,WHY so simple old game is so dificult to install download? WTF? can some post normal info? mount install play?
,caveman567,2011-03-27T17:36Z,"works fine for me.. upgrade to 1.4.1 then use the patch for that version from www.gamecopyworld.com

thanks for the upload trutabr"

,Ron-bodygaurd,2012-04-28T19:27Z,"Hi there,

I have got DAEMON LITE, but the first part I did with PowerIso and it works.

Now, my question and my problem: when I choose Daemon Lite and go to my Stronghold 2 file; I cannot find a single file which could be suited to DAEMON! Everything is just empty, no proper image files!


I would love some help!"
,Ron-bodygaurd,2012-04-28T19:38Z,"I'll rephrase it just a bit; to make it more clear!


Starting from point A onwards: whenever I have got to use DAEMON LITE, there are just no files which I can choose! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help with this amazing game"
,Ron-bodygaurd,2012-04-28T19:50Z,"At step F, can't insert a back-up file?!"
,Ron-bodygaurd,2012-04-29T14:03Z,IT WORKS FUCKING FANTASTIC
