The SSDE is an application that will allow you to free up much needed space on your desktop. It is as simple as dragging an icon into the add section and naming a button. Once you click save it will then add a button. It is as simple as that!


This desktop environment allows you to set up different users so that when you add buttons in only an administrator is allowed to edit the button settings. The program is password protected which allows you to easily hide shortcuts to programs that you do not wish any other people to access. All of your preferences are saved to the registry which makes this program much more secure.


In this application there are 3 different user levels in which you will be able to set and modify..
This program allows:
(*) 30 Game Shortcuts
(*) 30 Application Shortcuts
(*) Unlimited User Accounts


The controls to utilize all of these features are built within the application.


There will be follow-up updates which will improve security, visual affects and most importantlyâ€¦ user friendliness.
