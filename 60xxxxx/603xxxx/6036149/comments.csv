,apkguy,2011-01-25T17:41Z,I have a problem. The video is great looking and everything but I can't play this Video over xbox360 plug and play via my USB. I put the file on my USB and can't play it. When I convert the file to .mp4 with avc codec through format factory I get the subtitles at the bottom of the screen. I used tsmuxer it shows 2 audio files but no subtitle. What should I do. Anyways great upload 10++

,wirama,2011-10-19T05:32Z,"@ t-track


the title name of the movie is Step Up 3D, doesn't mean it has to play 3D all the time
so don't complain!"
