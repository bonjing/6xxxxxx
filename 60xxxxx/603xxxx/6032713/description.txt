
Bonded by Blood is an American thrash metal band, named after Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood. Like its labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste, Bonded by Blood is part of the thrash metal revival movement, whose aesthetic embraces not only the 1980s thrash metal music, but the fashion of that era. The band was formed in mid 2005 by vocalist Jose Barrales, who with the help of friends completed the band's lineup with guitarist Alex Lee, drummer Carlos Regalado, and bassist Ruben Dominguez.

Aside from being aficionados by the 1980s thrash metal, the band has expressed their love of skateboarding, comic books, and cartoons (most notably the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). At the time of recordings of the Extinguish the Weak EPâ€”while the band were rehearsingâ€”Barrales was listening to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song online and suggested the band to create a cover version. Initially, Bonded by Blood played the song in live performances, but after receiving positive feedback from the audience the band decided to record it. "Theme from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" was originally included on the Extinguish the Weak EP and later on Feed the Beast.

Here is their two albums:
"Feed the Beast"
"Exiled to Earth"
