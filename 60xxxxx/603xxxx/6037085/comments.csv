,keba68,2011-04-24T14:31Z,Left channnel sound quiet when playing in stereo mode with WDTV Live. Anyone else notice?
,keba68,2011-04-28T11:28Z,Nix that last comment... 3 year-old had changed audio settings on TV. D'Oh!
,vputelli,2011-05-31T09:41Z,"For me no sound at all when playing on WDTV Live but ok on Desktop.
Must be  a problem with the WDTV bos and not liking the DTS 5.1 codec.
Anyone has a fix.
The video quality is perfect."
,manl300000,2011-06-19T17:26Z,Do not work with WDMedia Player.
,lakers24tw,2011-07-03T18:17Z,Thanks!
,Nismo_02,2011-07-14T01:24Z,Use Divx Player or VLC Player. If Audio still off Download something called instacodecs. just google it and install it and it makes the audio start working on all three players.

Fantastic rip!

Thank you for uploading, insinuendo.

@scf0002 - Audio works fine on my non computer player. DTS is pretty standard."

Extremely clear. No glitches from what I've seen so far. Thanks for the ups."
