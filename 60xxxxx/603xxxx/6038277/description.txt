This is Chris Connor - Sings Gentle Bossa Nova (1965), for Paramount, once again, another female singer with that Julie London - Cry me a River mood, which is very adapted to Bossa Nova gentle singing. Chris Connor brings an innovative repertoire with Sings Gentle Bossa Nova, opening the record with a Beatles song, Hard Day\\\'s Night and keeps rolling with a nice repertoire with no Bossa Nova standards. This should please Loronixers as I got pleased when heard it today. Tracks include:

01 - Hard Day\\\'s Night
02 - A Taste of Honey
03 - Downtown
04 - Feeling Good
05 - Shadow of your Smile
06 - Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me)
07 - Can\\\'t Get Over the Bossa Nova
08 - Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte
09 - Dear Heart
10 - Baby, the Rain Must Fall
11 - Stranger on the Shore
12 - A Quiet Thing
