 Betty LaVette is one of the great singers of our age, and no stranger to interpreting othersâ€™ work either. Her version of Lucinda Williamsâ€™s â€œJoyâ€, from 2005â€™s Iâ€™ve Got My Own Hell to Raise, remains the definitive version of that song, and this from someone who thought the original couldnâ€™t be bettered. If youâ€™ve never heard it, look it up online, right now, and listen. Weâ€™ll wait.



Dolly Parton, Elton John, Willie Nelson, Sinead Oâ€™Connorâ€”when LaVette casts her net, she casts it wide, and more often than not, she manages to transform the song into something utterly newâ€”recognizable, but deeper, darker, and often more powerful. Her last record, a 6-song collection of soul standards like â€œChange Is Gonna Comeâ€ and â€œAinâ€™t No Sunshineâ€, was a logical extension of her 40+-year career. 



Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook takes on somewhat different material: a set of classic rockers from the 1960s and â€˜70s. Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Traffic, Pink Floyd, the Beatles (collectively and individually, except for Johnâ€”go figure) and more. This is classic-rock radio fodder, and LaVette shows courage in taking on such venerable tunes and placing her own indelible stamp on the material.



For roughly half the tracks, her performances are revelatory. â€œThe Wordâ€ is transformed from a bouncy Rubber Soul pop song to a from-the-gut plea. Ringo Starâ€™s â€œIt Donâ€™t Come Easyâ€ mines the blues for levels of resonance that the original never had, while Zeppelinâ€™s â€œAll My Loveâ€ trades Plantâ€™s fey chirping for LaVetteâ€™s angsty howl, accompanied by a sexy piano undertone. â€œWhy Does Love Got to Be So Sadâ€, from Layla, brings in horns to point up the funk buried in the songâ€™s DNA, while â€œDonâ€™t Let Me Be Misunderstoodâ€ lends emotional heft to an overly familiar song by the Animals.



Elsewhere, her reinventions are less successful, perhaps because the originals themselves are so perfect, or maybe because her go-to emotional stateâ€”eyeball-scratching angstâ€”isnâ€™t necessarily the perfect tone for â€œWish You Were Hereâ€ or â€œNights in White Satinâ€. Both these songs are wistful and contemplative, wearing their darkness and sense of loss gently (well, as gently as Roger Waters could ever manage), and LaVette misfires with her turn-it-up-to-11 emotional intensity. Moreover, her bewildering decision to re-order the verse and chorus of the Pink Floyd song, so that she begins with â€œHow I wish you were hereâ€¦â€ before any of the powerful verses that lead up to that punchline, is both mystifying and unsuccessful.



Other songs, like the Rolling Stonesâ€™ â€œSalt of the Earthâ€ and Trafficâ€™s â€œNo Time to Liveâ€, seem lightweight compared to other picks on the album, or even other songs by the bands themselves. (Iâ€™d have loved to hear her take on â€œDear Mr. Fantasyâ€, for example, or â€œWild Horsesâ€.)



The record closes with a live version of the Whoâ€™s â€œLove Reign Oâ€™er Meâ€, recorded live. It is a fitting bit of bombast to end a record which might have benefited from a bit less of it. But hey, itâ€™s Bettye. No one else sings like she does, as this record once again indisputably proves.
