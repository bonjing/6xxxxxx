,robbredd,2010-12-17T23:48Z,why would you post this as a FLAC file - do you have any clue of whats involved in converting this shit ?
,ddawg,2010-12-19T23:52Z,"robbredd did you just discover the internet?  Look, I only post lossless. I DO NOT POST LOSSY MP3's.  I also do neither post ape nor crappy Apple m4a's.  Converting is a snap.  BTW Winamp is capable of converting flac to lossy MP3's.  Users in the Flac section go through a lot of effort to avoid inferior formats like mp3 to ensure our posts are truly lossless."
