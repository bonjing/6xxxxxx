
Master sorcerer Balthazar Blake recruits a seemingly everyday guy in his mission to defend New York City from his arch-nemesis, Maxim Horvath. This is a DVD rip using handbrake.

I made this RIP around 1GB sinceI believe we've moved beyond the 700MB file size that was created when we were putting AVI's on CD-ROMs
