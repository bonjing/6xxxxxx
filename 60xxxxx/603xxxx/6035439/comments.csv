,zaier,2010-12-13T05:37Z,Thanks! This is the fastest download so far.
,zaier,2010-12-13T05:40Z,"@kb1513106

It is a new torrent, it has been up for about an hour.  More people need to download it before it speeds up significantly.  For how new it is, it is fast.  Much faster than the others up right now."
,Aeowon,2010-12-13T05:46Z,"Fast release!
I'm only connected to one person who has 100% downloaded but isn't uploading. Dang."

,kb1513106,2010-12-13T06:53Z,"@zaier Thx. Im new to this. Under ""seeds"" it says 5(3200) does that mean of 3200 people only 5 are actually seeding?"

,zaier,2010-12-13T08:23Z,"@kb1513106

I'm not sure what client you are using, but most likely it means that you are connected to 5 seeders of 3200 in the swarm.  There should also be number for peers (or leechers).  You will connect to peers (people who don't have the whole torrent) as well.  It will download the files in small parts from the seeders and peers you are connected to, so since you are only sending and receiving small parts it isn't necessary to have the whole file to share.  The seed number should (theoretically) go up when more people have the whole file, and more seeds means the downloads get faster for all the leechers."

,altoiddealer,2010-12-13T23:21Z,"I'm confused how the title of the season finale varies everywhere... I noticed on wikipedia it is listed as ""The Big One.""  After a google search it seems that many sites are regarding the episode as ""The Big One,"" too. All the other sites are regarding the episode title as ""Through a Glass, Darkly"""
,Master1995,2010-12-14T00:44Z,i think that is the big one at least that was what was written in the video
