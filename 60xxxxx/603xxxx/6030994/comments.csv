,Dril76,2010-12-14T10:38Z,"@anch8279 - Sorry but i can't believe that you got hacked coz of the addon mate. Try to figure if you did something else than this, like sharing your acc with someone else, opening suspicious Emails? Just a guess though..."

It's a wonderful guide, obviously! I have one problem though, one that has been bugging me for a while: Every time i complete a quest, the guide automatically starts skipping. Of course it's good if it skips only to the next step, but it doesn't stop just there. It just keeps skipping every step, over and over, either until it reaches the bottom of the guide or until i manually stop it by pushing the ""previous step"" button. This happens every time I deliver a quest, so it really bugs me. I have already taken a swift look into the options and it looks as if it only stops skipping for ""red"" steps, so it doesn't stop for the steps which are marked blue or grey.

tl;dr - Is there any option to change it's behaviour so that it only skips one step further every time you hand in a quest?

Thanks in advance!"
,TPBrullz,2010-12-15T03:33Z,"hi, made an account just to come here and thank you for all the zygor uploads.

i'm actually having a problem with it since cataclysm, in my lvl 80 the guide doesn't skip the quests until the lvl 80 quests like it should and like it used to if i started using the guide on a already lvled char"
,Eejanaika,2010-12-17T18:29Z,"I think that is easily solved with just skipping the guide to the [lvl 80-85 - Hyjal] section. :)

I found another bug: In the Deepholm section, the green dot that appears on your map is not fixed. Instead, it kind of ""hovers"" along with the direction you're going. It's annoying because therefore you can't easily fly to your destination, like you can with all other zones. "
