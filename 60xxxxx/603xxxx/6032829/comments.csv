Please may I ask if it is possible to upload a movie called '40 Carats'. I saw this movie back in the 70's and it is excellent. IMDB also give it a good rating.

There are many others trying to download this (40 Carats) from another uploader but the uploader and seeders have disappeared and the leechers only have 44.6% of the movie.

Please greenbud1969"
