[V],gansuk,2010-12-13T14:36Z,"@peeyoosh it means Nothing was removed from the game, and Only the intro movie was recoded"
[V],gansuk,2010-12-18T23:53Z,if you using the default folder from the installer the games launcher should be located C:\games\Fallout.New.Vegas-KaOs\FalloutNVLauncher.exe

,rohitch,2011-01-18T19:04Z,"After rebuilding when i click FalloutNVLauncher.exe i m gettin a menu to install.when i click on the install i get error""newvegas doent appear to be installed and "" installet could not be found.Please help.i have done the rebuild as per your instruction"
,Lorkken,2011-01-19T20:20Z,Great upload.Game works without any problems.
,Itsmejohn1,2011-01-22T03:24Z,I installed it using the installer and theres nothing called FalloutNVLauncher or anything with launcher in it just a whole bunch on winrar archives and files that are r30 r31 r32 and so on to r72
,Itsmejohn1,2011-01-22T03:24Z,Help?
,rattlehead93,2011-01-31T19:14Z,"so i downloaded this, and rebuilt it just fine. I hit the launcher.exe and the main screen popped up, but when i hit play game it said...

Failed to initialize renderer.
Hardware T&L required but not supported by Adapter.

Help anyone?"
,crums44,2011-02-04T15:38Z,"This is going to make me sound retarded.  How do I rebuild the program?  I unpacked using winRAR, and installed it.  However, every time i try to run the launcher, it says this:

The program can't start because steam_api.dll is missing from your computer.  Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem"
,bouncingbetty1,2011-02-19T04:43Z,"Works great, just takes some time for the game to rebuild."
,C0RNF14K35,2011-03-07T22:05Z,Works perfectly and runs very smoothly thanks for this greatly appreciated
,-Kuro,2011-06-28T03:54Z,"Kinda sad that I had to make an acc to tell people to seed for a game like this...

PLEASE SEED!!!
Thanks."
,McDowelstick,2011-08-09T14:52Z,"Played many Kaos ripped games and this is the only one I'm less than happy with. The unpacker doesn't rebuild the game according to how the original is. Some of the sound files have been altered and re-encoded improperly, resulting in no radio music in the game. More sounds could be affected too though I haven't played long enough to find out. Also the fallout.ini in the documents folder keeps defaulting to read only for some reason.

None of these things happen with the full version of the game, such as the one by Skidrow. I suggest new downloaders get that version instead. It's 3gb larger but plays 100% perfect upon install."
,doppellsinn,2011-09-05T01:20Z,"Gansuk, awesome as always. I have a request. could your team do the witcher 2, assassin of kings? thanks for all the good work!"
,migoroth,2011-09-25T06:37Z,"i do not normally leave comments, but when i do, they normally say FUCKING SEED!"

,Se7en47,2011-10-22T06:23Z,"OK this is going to sound stupid, but how would I burn this onto a disk? The way it installs isn't like the others I have burned, but without burning it I would have to re-install it ever time I turn my PC back on so....someone help me out please.

Great Torrent by the way! It works great, very smooth and incredibly easy to install :D"
,crypto2295,2011-10-30T11:29Z,Can u put DLC on this game
