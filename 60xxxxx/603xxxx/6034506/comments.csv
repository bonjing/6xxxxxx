The torrent contains only MP3 music files.
Only executable code can contain trojans.

Learn about false positives from virus scanners before you post any more stupid comments.

The anti virus software known for having the highest number of false positives is AVG."

Thanks for already clearing this up!!

I did an extra scan of the folder to make sure only MP3 files were in there... And yes, there are only MP3s inside the folder and no trojans whatsoever!!

So, to everyone else: save to download and enjoy!!
Merry Xmas!"
