Drive-By Truckers - Go-Go Boots (2011)







***ADVANCE***





Official release date: in the United States on February 15, 2011 and a day earlier elsewhere.






Drive-By Truckers are an alternative country/Southern rock band based in Athens, Georgia, though three out of six members (Mike Cooley, Patterson Hood, and Shonna Tucker) are originally from The Shoals region of Northern Alabama. Their music uses three guitars as well as bass, drums, and now keyboards. Like many alternative country acts, the Drive-By Truckers record in analog (using 2 inch tape). However, unlike the majority of their contemporaries, the Drive-By Truckers have consistently pushed their labels to also release the band's records in a vinyl format.

Go-Go Boots is the title of the upcoming Drive-By Truckers "R&B murder" album and is set to be released in the United States on February 15, 2011 and a day earlier elsewhere. This will be the Drive-By Truckers' ninth studio album (eleventh total). The album was recorded over three blocks of sessions resulting in 25 songs, which the band decided to split between The Big To-Do and its follow up Go-Go Boot's. After The Big To-Do's release, the band continued working on and tweaking the album throughout 2010. Go-Go Boots marks the eighth Drive-By Truckers album produced by David Barbe. Wes Freed will once again be providing the album artwork.

Guitarist and frontman Patterson Hood has described the album to be the band's "most different and most Muscle Shoals sounding album." The Drive-By Trucker's will include two covers by fellow Muscle Shoals artist Eddie Hinton on the album.
