A gaff card is a specially printed card designed to fit in with your normal deck. What makes these cards so powerful is that spectators have never seen cards like these. The shock of seeing a never-before-seen card produced magically packs a powerful, magical punch. Ellusionist has created the ultimate vehicle to train you in the art of using gaff cards.
