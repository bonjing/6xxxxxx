Kiss were always best known for their theatrical stage attire, explosive stage props and blood-spitting, fire-breathing antics, which is why many people continue to overlook the fact that many Kiss songs are tolerable at best. Even if the band's music is best used as loud background music for the band's visual extravaganza, the band did have a few jewels down the front of their bulging trousers. On You Wanted the Best, You Got the Best!, they let them hang down to the ground, preventing the need to buy a full Kiss album ever again. "Firehouse," "Calling Dr. Love," "I Stole Your Love," and of course "Rock and Roll All Nite" shine through, and for the deluded die-hards, there are three previously unreleased live tracks and an interview with Jay Leno sure to raise the room temperature a few degrees.
