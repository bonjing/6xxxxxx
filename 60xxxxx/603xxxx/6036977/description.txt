 The movie is about the city of Mumbai, and a  
 child who sells tea on its streets. In the    
 words of the director, "It's set at a time    
 when Mumbai wants to be Shanghai."            
 Amidst the mayhem of Mumbai's back streets, a 
 pulsating ambition to live life to the fullest
 thrives,despite danger stalking at every turn.
 And at the centre of each neighbourhood is    
 usually one good soul who always tries to     
 help everyone, resident or visitor - yet is   
 repeatedly exploited in return. Johnny        
 is one such individual.
