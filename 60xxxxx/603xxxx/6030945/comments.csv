,careyfleet,2010-12-11T15:41Z,"I'd like to appologise for slow download rates some may be experiencing. Remember, DOS-Carey is just me. I'm seeding from my PC on my home-broadband. There is no server! As DOS-Carey grows, my upload rate has to be evenly distributed among all the simultaneous downloads which makes it slow. I AM RELYING ON YOU TO SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!... DOS-Carey will die, if uploading becomes an issue.

Thanks,
DOS-Carey"
