         CEO John Fuller goes under cover to work in one of his        
         restaurants; John panics when he thinks his identity          
         has been exposed and fails to properly make a signature       
          hamburger.                                                    
                                                                       
                                                                     
                                                                  
      
       
         Release  Notes    
                                     
                                        
                                                                  
                                                                     
         Proper notes: 187HD's release has bad crop top and left       
         throughout. Also, while not a proper reason, their muxing     
         tool is broken and causes video to not play back in some      
         applications like MPCHC, so perhaps their coder can take      
         another shot at it. As for the read NFO portion, this         
         show is clearly not HDTV. It is upconverted widescreen        
         SD, much like Hell's Kitchen (US). Obvious signs of this      
         are the very soft picture, excessive edge enhancement,        
         and excessive cropping needed compared to other, real HD      
         programs on the same network. Also, the lack of a Presented   
          in HD logo at the start is a helpful sign.
