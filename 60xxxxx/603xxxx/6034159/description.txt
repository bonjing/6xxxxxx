    Contested Streets explores the history and culture of New York City      
    streets from pre-automobile time to the present. This examination        
    allows for an understanding of how the city - though the most well       
    served by mass transit in the United Streets - has slowly                
    relinquished what was a rich, multi-dimensional conception of the        
    street as public space to a mindset that prioritizes the rapid           
    movement of cars and trucks over all other functions. Central to the     
    story is a comparison of New York to what is experienced in London,      
    Paris and Copenhagen. Interviews and footage shot in these cities        
    showcase how limiting automobile use in recent years has improved air    
    quality, minimized noise pollution and enriched commercial,              
    recreational and community interaction. London's congestion pricing      
    scheme, Paris' BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) and Copenhagen's bicycle and      
    pedestrian infrastructure are all examined in depth. New York City,      
    though to many the most vibrant and dynamic city on Earth, still has     
    lessons to learn from Old Europe.
