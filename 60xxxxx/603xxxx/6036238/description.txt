This file is not exactly perfect. The source I got it from was not great. I re-encoded and did what I do to increase the perceived quality. Overall, not really so bad. If you're a fan of Rihanna, you'll enjoy this....but like I said....I did the best I could with the source I started with.

Video = MPEG-2 NTSC 720x480 (16:9) 29.97 fps Progressive

Audio = DD2 AC3 224 kbps @ 48 KHz

Duration = 3:42.855



High quality multiple image screen shot -
