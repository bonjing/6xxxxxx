,furio12,2010-12-16T05:19Z,sorry but i have been away from the torrent scene and am having problems installing this game. it says to mount or burn the image but there are only bin files and no cue or iso files so im not sure what i need to burn. also the last game i got from skidrow was very easy i just opened the setup exe file and it installed but this one isnt working. any help would be much appreciated thanks
,peebles,2010-12-17T08:05Z,"1. Mount image
2. Run Setup.exe
3. Enjoy"
,kingaza,2010-12-17T11:58Z,"this does not work, says file Mafia2-1.bin is not found after mounting, and brings up errors of infected files all over... im suspect."
,viny32,2010-12-19T14:01Z,"Thankx, works great!"
,richardje152,2010-12-19T17:04Z,"UUhm i have mount it ....

Plz help"
,cro_bully,2010-12-19T19:00Z,"i have installed,copied from skidrow but when i press on mafia II it won´t start!please help..."
,kingaza,2010-12-20T15:27Z,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD

this is not skidrow, search mafia 2 and select in the filters, games, then scroll down to the Mafia II-SKIDROW download with 1000+ seeders, i dont know what this is but this does not work, and has copied and pasted from the actual skidrow"
,PisstreeKeedas,2010-12-21T04:26Z,"The installer will not work. The douche that uploaded this renamed the setup files and they will not work with the setup.exe. Because I'm a stingy bastard and can't be bothered downloading the other one I fixed it myself. First extract the files with 7-Zip, then rename the setup-1.bin files to Mafia2-1.bin, Mafia2-2.bin, etc. You need to download http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial from there to be able to repack the ISO. Pretty self-explanatory."
,ruiner54,2010-12-21T23:47Z,"Pistreekeedas, thank you for pointing that out. That was starting to drive me nuts. I managed to decompress it and change the file names, but couldnt remember how to repack as an ISO"
,PisstreeKeedas,2010-12-24T02:58Z,"No worries ruiner54. Sorry if I sounded a bit grumpy. I just don't like people who upload torrents and then everyone says it works. It took me ages to find out that I needed MagicISO because, although I came across it once in my many internet travels, Google only showed repacking ISO files for PSP which was pretty annoying. "
,tony07,2010-12-26T17:54Z,"@pisstreekeedas

then reload the latest chapter you were on. Good luck!"
,jempa0,2011-01-14T01:33Z,hey so amazing
,PisstreeKeedas,2011-01-26T09:02Z,"@tony07 
No worries. I don't actually have time to make a video but you extract the .iso file with 7Zip or something similar. So in this case the sr-mafia2.iso file then rename and repack. Hope it helps."

,darkloanwolf,2011-03-08T10:12Z,"@PisstreeKeedas

Well, thank you for your help. I did exactly as you said, and still managed to fail with fixing this error. In-fact, the only damn problem I am having is the fact that it turns the files into *video* files, and for some particular reason, the setup is moved elsewhere in the repacked Iso. I have no more comment, I've downloaded 3 different versions of these stupid torrents, and now I've decided I'll just go buy this game in store, people should consider using the 1% brain cell capacity they seize to have and POST PROPER GAMES/TORRENTS. Thanks!"
,faisalthe1,2011-04-03T22:36Z,"@darkloanwolf:dude,just extract the whole downloaded folder using 7 zip extracter and juss change the name of those bin files as""Mafia2-1"",""Mafia2-2"" etc...worked for me,even i was pissed at first.:)"
