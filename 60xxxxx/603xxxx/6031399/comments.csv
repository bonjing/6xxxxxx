,ufchenric,2010-12-24T13:58Z,Thanx LigGeorge for all your hard work! A question if I buy a bluray-burner and burn the mkv-file on a bluray-disc will I get the sound (dts-hd) to work without having to remux it. I already have Samsung 3D-tv and 3D-bluray and Onkoy tx-nr808 with 3D.
,rrandan,2010-12-24T20:37Z,cannot get the sound to work. any way to convert it? did what txt file said with no luck.  Help!
,rrandan,2010-12-24T20:53Z,"sound says its not compatable. any way to fix this? I tried the txt file info with no luck.

Help!!"
,rrandan,2010-12-25T15:36Z,"got it to work

Very nice movie

Thank you very much!!!!"
,super64c,2011-01-04T23:16Z,"if this does not work for you, here's how i got it working.   my LG px950 3dtv only supports mkv level 4.1 which this is recorded in 5.1     

i used the program tsmuxer to change from 5.1 down to 4.1.   make sure you select fps 24000/1001 and level 4.1.   i unchecked add picture timing info and continually insert sps/pps.   under output, click demux and hit start.   

once finished you will have to add the mp4 audio track with mkvmerge.   the file to download is mkvtoolnix version 4.4   drag and drop the .264 file that tsmixer made and the mp4 supplied in this torrent.   click on each track and disable compression in ""extra option"" tab.   in the ""format specific options"" set the fps to 24000/1001.     

note: if you don't specify the fps in both programs, the audio won't be synced.

took me many hours to figure this out and now i can play it play it flawlessly in 3d via usb drive.   not about to let an inanimate object beat me!"
,super64c,2011-01-04T23:22Z,"oh yah, and thanks to ligGeroge for your work.   the quality is great, even after demuxing and remuxing!   i did hear you mention you may supply both audio tracks separately, which would be fantastic, but im not complaining."
,Mikee2185,2011-01-30T11:05Z,"100% quality, works great (real 3D). Thank you!"
,yarddawg,2011-02-19T18:06Z,"Members, I keep trying to download this using Miro. Each time I start, Miro indicates that it is downloading and then it goes back into start up mode. Any ideas why? I downloaded 3 previously and had no such issues."
,SpderMan,2011-06-04T18:18Z,"Hey LigGeorge, thanks for your uploads, I'm wondering if you can add the Spanish Audio Tracks for the 3D movies you uploaded, like the audio track you uploaded for How to Train your Dragon but in spanish, so i can mux it. Thanks dude and keep the good work man, you are the best 3D uploader!!"
