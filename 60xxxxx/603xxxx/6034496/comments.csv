,SystemFolder,2010-12-13T03:16Z,Just to let you know: #32 Kylie Minogue - Better Than Today.mp3 should be listed as a re-entry because it was new (#40) in your 28-11-2010 release and wasn't in your torrent last week.
,Furball1954,2010-12-13T03:49Z,"Keep up the good work oldskool, lots of us thank you loads and I always buy charity releases. I will not be asking HENRY! or maybe I willask him to keep his bullshit to himself"

,onlyfred,2010-12-13T17:33Z,"Is there a way to make a playlist file that would add all the top 40 songs if they still have the same name? This is because I only download the new one's each week.
Thanks for the continued uploads though, highly appreciated."
