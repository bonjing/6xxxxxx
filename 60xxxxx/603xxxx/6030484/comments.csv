(i realize Da Gov. and some other skilled people can always hack me, or ""look into what i'm doing"" but it would be nice to be able to use my cards other than at ATMs... Advertisement companies watch everything you do with your cards already, WHERE you shop, WHAT you buy, HOW you spend, WHO you are, and try to deceipher WHY? Sickening! But mainly i just don't want some asshole to get my card #s PM me on how to buy... you have my interest..."
,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-19T08:30Z,Oh shit! just browesed through your other ULs... If you can buy anything on amazon.com... it's outdated... for a while... thought this might be the latest... Oh well PM me anyway.
,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-19T08:35Z,"OH man! did they take PM away from this site? ... ... ... ... I can't find out how to PM you now, so either I'm drunk or it's been too long! "
,GrImMnEsS,2010-12-19T08:41Z,"NVM anyways, I want something from a true hackers perspective, I know it can be done, I just don't know how to stop it from happening to me! I wanted something unreleased, as you didn't provide a link here... i thought maybe i'd found it... it was a good breifing, and if you don't know what's possible, a worthwhile buy!
