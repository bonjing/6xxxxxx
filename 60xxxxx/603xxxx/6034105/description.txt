Amazon Review:
Through good times and bad, Johnny Cash has remained true to his roots--roots that have never sounded better-tended than on this pure country collection of holiday standards (and a few surprises). Split evenly between solo material and songs recorded with wife June Carter and the Carter family, Country Christmas runs the gamut from reverent ("What Child Is This?") to downright knee-slappin' (the grin inducing "Piggy Puddin'"). About the only thing the 15-song set doesn't have is a veneer of slickness to rope in the stuffed shirts. And who needs them at a Christmas party, anyway?
