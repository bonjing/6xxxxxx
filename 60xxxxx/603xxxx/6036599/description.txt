Alright, so I guess it's that time again.

Updating the Collection of Culture that I posted earlier this year.
(http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5402805/A_collection_of_culture)

So just copy pasting what I said last time.

This is a collection of images saved from various blogs, online communities, portals and imageboards.

We are children of the internet and our culture is just as important as that of our ancestors, and I believe that it should be free and accessible to everyone.

I want to thank the people who run non or low profit sites dedicated to spreading ideas, images and opinions for performing that service for us. And I want to thank the many heroes who will make crudely drawn MS Paint comics about video games, the neckbearded fanboys and fangirls drawing hilarious rule #34 and those who will make threads with original content even when it's not funny, because it's that creative spirit that shapes our culture and not the people sitting on their high horses comparing everything to the Renaissance masters.

For more details check the image associated with the torrent on the image board you found this torrent mentioned on.








Also archived as a .rar, if you don't understand why then try to make a .torrent file out of these files and see what tracker will allow you to upload a 10meg .torrent file before complaining
