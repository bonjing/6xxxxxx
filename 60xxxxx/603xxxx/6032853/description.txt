Michelle Bridges is a trainer on Biggest Loser Australia

 

Strength training is the FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH! This DVD incorporates both cardio fitness along with the all important strength training. This is how you shape, tone and define. I cover off all the major muscle groups with 5 minute sessions on legs, chest and back, triceps and biceps as well as the core. I have fuel injected this DVD with two, 5 minute cardio sessions, so you really get your moneys worth here! Mix and match or do the whole thing. By using minimal equipment youll see how easy it is to put together some basic building blocks to get effective and fast results in your own training.
