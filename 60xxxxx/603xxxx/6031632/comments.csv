M:7 -> A bit boring and the twists were predictable, but pretty decent overall.

If you get time, could you please release Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole? 

Thanks much!!"

,cirad,2010-12-28T04:04Z,"Normally, FXG_team is perfect and I always trust them for great quality. However, there was something wrong with this movie! It froze not even a third of the way in and then when I got it to play through that part, it froze later on again.. I couldn't get past the first third of the movie.

Everyone else has good comments so maybe there's just something wrong with my media device."
