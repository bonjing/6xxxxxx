Film Review
If there is one category of film which French cinema has done well in recent years it is the social realist drama, and Trois huit is a particularly distinctive and memorable example of the genre. With a grimly uncompromising depiction of male relationships in a familiar working class setting, the film is both disturbing and harrowingly realistic. The apparent simplicity of Philippe Le Guayâ€™s direction exposes the complexity of the relationship of the filmâ€™s two principal protagonists â€“ the near-psychopathic bully Fred and his seemingly willing victim Pierre. The nature of the relationship between the two men is both baffling and believable, with a curious dependency that could be mistaken for symbiosis. Pierreâ€™s lack of self-esteem makes him a willing punch-bag for Fredâ€™s pent-up aggression, implying there is something darkly masochistic in being a bullyâ€™s victim; perhaps Pierre feels perversely gratified by the time and attention that Fred gives him, the next best thing to the love that is elsewhere absent from his life. As befits a good piece of social realism, the film boasts some fine cinematography and faultless naturalistic performances, including exceptional contributions from the two male leads, GÃ©rald Laroche and Marc BarbÃ©.
