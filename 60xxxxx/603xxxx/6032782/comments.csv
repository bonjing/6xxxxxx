,sup3xtian,2010-12-12T09:55Z,what's new with extended version?Before I downloading it. I want this one because its 5.1 audio channel.
[V],prashant22,2010-12-12T10:25Z,"@DSIN
i knew it that out of all the people u'll definately notice and ask...ya i hv joined HDScene grp...its a new grp from a new site ""sceneungerground""...thefalcon007 asked me to be a part of it and i agreed...i will be doing my work as usual..bt will upload 1 or 2 movies as part of HDScene...as there rules demand 720p's more than 1gb...so i'll only do some new movies as part of the grp...and other requests n all as usual...

having said that i had already planned avatar to be 2gb as in whole 3hr movie i think 2hrs must be high bitrate scenes only...
i hv seen scorp's sample of avatar nd avatar extended..very bad really pixelated even on my 21""...nd he used 1000kbps bitrate..so i knew this requires more...btw it took 6(1st pass)+25(2nd pass)+1(audio)hrs to encode this...

@prank,frapper101 
welcome guys..

@sup3xtian
runtime of extended version is 2hr 58mn...means 16min more than the theatrical version(2hr 42mn)...enjoy.."
,kanha,2010-12-12T10:34Z,what's next....??

,DSIN,2010-12-12T14:41Z,"@prashant : great news... 
some guys might not like big sizes.. but i'm perfectly ok with it... u should do ""princess mononoke"" & ""total recall"" as HDScene releases :D
i know ""thefalcon"" btw ... he's one of the kingdom guys. 
& just registered to the site..
a bit too flashy... but looks great for a new site..
ty for the info.. will be looking forward for ur group releases ;)

,akindayimcan,2010-12-12T15:01Z,"thanks for avatar extended buddy...quality is fine as always...

btw ""the legend of guardians"" brrip is out from 300 director zack snyder... imdb link is here...

http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219342/

i watched it and this movie isnt for children...u can do it with small size but it is your decide...
"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-12T15:10Z,"@DSIN
thats why i will be releasing only 1 or 2 movies per week as part of HDScene...rest i will continue my work...so everyone will be happy...
as part of HDScene mostly i'll do new movies...
size will be b/w 1 n 1.5gb...or more specifically bitrate will be b/w 1300-1700kbps....so u wont be needing to download kingdom releases 2gb n more rips...

btw abt ur PM on demonoid..i think ur right..bt really leave it dude..."
[V],prashant22,2010-12-12T15:27Z,"@akind
welcome..n ya i will do it...
the legend of guardians
the town
the american..
i cannot miss movies like these..."
,DSIN,2010-12-12T15:31Z,"@prashant: great... so it sounds like HDScene will be bigger & better than kingdom & HDlite guys...
Wow.. i saw this coming... ure 1 of the big guns now ..hope u don't forget me ...LOL..hehe :D
abt HIM ... yeah i'll let it go... but that douchebag shld learn that world is full of more smarter ppl than him :D"
,DSIN,2010-12-12T16:16Z,"r u for real mzk...
its asking us to register like ahashare.. no big deal.. i did as did jarman & prashant..
its actually a very good site with chatting window & cool interface... 
far better that this tpb ...:D
& i think it'll be gr8 like Demonoid in no time... :D"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-12T16:20Z,"@DSIN
no dude...kingdom and hdlite r still the best grp...may be with time......
n since u hv 32"" so my rips with 1400-1500kbps will be enough for u...godd in quality as well as in size...
i made this decision because there is kickass,20-40 they upload in same size as mine nd there quality is good too..so i though why nt provide variety 1-1.5gb with 5.1 audio will be awesome...

@mzk
thanks mate...btw ur too lazy dude it just takes 2 mins to register..."

,pirate.kid,2010-12-19T05:59Z,"@prashant22

thanks dude... top-notch quality as always +1 added.

couldn`t  find what is added in this release though,i hope there are some more special effect scenes.

and since i am at it i have a request which i hope you would consider 

  Oceans Eleven 1960 + 3 new Ocean movies

have already requested to a couple of uploaders but haven`t got even a reply (funny thing is i only became a member hoping someone would oblige me)

ps. pls don`t give links to plutO realeses (have them already,want something with more quality)

and have a nice day :)"
[V],prashant22,2010-12-19T07:04Z,"@pirate.kid
welcome..
nd i wont give those links..bt sorry i m nt taking any requests for old movies till 2 months...i m full with requests or i should say overloaded atm..."
,pirate.kid,2010-12-19T12:15Z,"@prashant22

well... 2 months is sure a heck of a lot time, but thanks for the superfast reply anyway.
keep up the good work and be happy:)

@all

i was kinda hoping to avoid this but since there is no other way can someone post torrent/direct links to the Ocean`s (Eleven,Twelve,Thirteen) movies 720p (4/8gb per file)."
,pirate.kid,2010-12-22T05:42Z,"@mzk57

i have`em already but the uploader lost a bit too much quality in order to make them fast to download (good for slow bandwidth users)

anyway i found what i was looking for on demonoid and now i found it here on piratebay.here is the link if anyone else is looking for the Ocean`s series :

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5340513/Oceans_Trilogy_720p_BRrip_H.264_AAC_-_Westy1983

there aren`t many seedes but since it is on demonoid too it won`t die soon 

have a merry Christmas everyone :)"
