,Ramb082,2011-10-22T03:57Z,Nah I like the way they didn't quite follow the games as much because common... the T-virus was barely heard of after resident evil 3 nemesis which was like 8 years ago... they moved onto another disease created by some retarded guy in a mansion... lol the movies keep the story going in a straight line where'as there's like 15 resident evil games all over the place haha.
