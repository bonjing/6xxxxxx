,briarios_exm,2010-12-16T23:14Z,Has anyone figured out how to open the archives 
,ancientgames,2010-12-17T13:03Z,"It's a zip, so you have to open the -first- archive with winzip or 7zip."
,briarios_exm,2010-12-26T11:17Z,so i cant seem to get the archive to open i keep getting errors from winzip winrar and 7zip wtf i really want to play this game
,ancientgames,2010-12-26T21:32Z,"Just make sure to open the FIRST of the archives, not one of the other ones. "
,shadowwolf1917,2011-02-18T06:57Z,"Alright people, listen up. To install it and work it you need two programs. The first being DAEMON Tools or a similar program, and the second being a program called hjsplit. Use hjsplit to join the ZIP file pieces together. After that, extract the full ZIP. Mount the .nrg file with DAEMON tools and install. If it says something about a slide file and errors, don't bother worrying, just click OK twice and it will continue to where you setup your graphics. Set them up, set up your controls with the menu at the top, and then click Start Turok, There you go, it will work. Also, might I add, the graphics are god compared to the N64 version. In fact I almost jizzed when I saw them. Thanks for the upload!"
