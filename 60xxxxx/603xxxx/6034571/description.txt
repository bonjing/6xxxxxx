Moment of Truth(1992)Part 3 of The Evangelism Trilogy 

Three of the most powerful evangelistic films ever produced!

In the late 80â€™s and early 90â€™s, Mars Hill produced 3 hard hitting, award-winning evangelistic films. Though they were produced a decade ago, these short films are still being used today because they powerfully present eternal truths in an incredibly creative and compelling way.

Moment of Truth:

The truth is like a light in the darkness. When itâ€™s gone, all thatâ€™s left is the darkness.
