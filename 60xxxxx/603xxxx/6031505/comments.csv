I'll continue to upload once in awhile, but for now i need a break including from politics especially when it seems to be constant bad news for my sanity. Initially, I just wanted to help DBaum. The ""ONLY"" reason I kept uploading was because a lot of people don't have access to ""any"" progressive programming. And this really PISSES me off. I'll try to upload when I can. It just won't be daily. thanks happy holidays. "
