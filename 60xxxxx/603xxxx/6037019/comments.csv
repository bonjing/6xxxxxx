,defeatedsanity,2010-12-13T19:32Z,"Thanks OOO, Really appreciate the fact that you uploaded this season along with all previous seasons.

On another note what a huge disappointment I found this finale to be! Had huge potential after the lead up from the last couple episodes but it fell flat. Too many plot holes, loose ends and I found the conclusion to this season to just be plain lazy on the the writers part. I didn't expect this finale to top that of season 4 because I knew it couldn't and wouldn't but come on! Sorry for the rant, I realize the comments here are not intended to become a dexter message board I just found the need to vent.
