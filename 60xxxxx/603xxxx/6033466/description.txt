The other torrent is no longer working due to some technical discrepancies. Here is the new working torrent.

This saved game contains a tall cobblestone tower, a huge, hollow cobblestone diamond in the air, a small house, a carved side of a mountain, a deep, mind-boggling underground mine on the island where the water slide stops, a water slide, an almost finished roller coaster (need more iron to make more tracks).

1. Rename the folder to "World1" and copy the folder.
2. Open Start menu. Go to Run. (for Win7, Type Run in search bar and press Enter)
3. Type %appdata% and press Enter.
4. Go to ".minecraft" folder then to the "saves" folder and paste the "World1" folder.

I have no intention of spreading viruses/malware in the internet. I don't want any of it in my computer, so, I'm sure this torrent is 100% clean.
