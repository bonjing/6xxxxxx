From Wiki:


Yes are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968, generally regarded as one of the archetypal bands and pioneers of the genre. Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group, and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band has continued for more than 40 years and still retains a large following. They have sold over 33 million albums.[1] The band's music blends symphonic and other "classical" structures with their own brand of rock music.

Although the band's sole consistent member has been bass player Chris Squire, Yes are also generally noted for the distinctive high-register vocals of former lead singer Jon Anderson and the eclectic musical stylings of a succession of guitarists (Steve Howe, Peter Banks, Trevor Rabin, Billy Sherwood), keyboard players (Rick Wakeman, Tony Kaye, Patrick Moraz, Geoff Downes, Igor Khoroshev, Oliver Wakeman), and drummers (Alan White and Bill Bruford). Several band members became celebrated musicians and/or bandleaders in their own right, and a 1980 lineup of the band was briefly fronted by Trevor Horn (shortly before he became one of rock music's most celebrated record producers). The band's current lineup is Squire, Howe, White, Oliver Wakeman (keyboards) and BenoÃ®t David (lead vocals). 





Live at Montreux 2003


Live at Montreux 2003 is a live album from progressive rock group Yes. It features a live recording of the band's headlining set at the 2003 Montreux Jazz Festival. It is also available on video in DVD format.
This is the first official album to feature the classic lineup of Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman, Chris Squire and Alan White since 1996's Keys to Ascension. Until the release of Symphonic Live in 2009, it was the only live album to feature material from the 2001 symphonic release Magnification.
The year after their Montreux performance, Yes began a hiatus from recording and touring that remained after the cancellation of the their Close to the Edge and Back tour until the current In the Present tour.
