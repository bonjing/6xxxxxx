,PersonX99,2010-12-31T01:23Z,Crashed with Error 1334 on install.  Looks like a corruption in the Data1.cab file
,blackxino,2011-01-01T04:33Z,"ok I know how to get pass the stupid error stuff that comes up when installing.

check on Task Manager and stop this process called CyberLink Power Director 9 keygen.exe

that apparently is the program that makes the install think there are 2 installations running."
,blackxino,2011-01-03T04:10Z,"this program is garbage!

use Video Studio XPRO 3!

I swear down I can't even get any editing done with this program, I'm trying to load some mp4 files and it instantly crashes!

As soon as I open the program and starts to run, it eats up the whole RAM, jumping from 40k to 150k! By the time you do little thing it gets to 200k and instantly crashes!

Corel Video Studio Pro X 3 when the program starts, it runs at 40k! While doing some heavy editing it goes to 100k still running smooth!


The problem with PD 9 is that what ever video you add to the library, the program runs off it, acting like real time.

VSPX3 does the same but does use memory on the video library. The playback is SO SMOOTH!"
,djagentdark,2011-01-14T05:41Z,Well the problem im having is that ti just wont open. i start it up once after i register it and then the next time i go to open it it tells me that its stopped working before it even boots up. the only way i have found around it is to uninstall and reinstall it before i use it.
,apatrida,2011-01-17T07:18Z,Tested and the program works perfect. Excellent  editor

THANKS VERY MUCH."
,Rikplay,2011-03-14T20:25Z,"Very quick download, Installed perfectly with no issues, Entered the given serial, all perfect. after installation finished and i ran the programme it instantly stopped working and crashed and done this each time i tried whether i restarted or reinstalled it. I found quick time to be the issue, i uninstalled quicktime then it worked flawlessly. I then reinstalled quicktime myself online but im not sure how bad its needed as it ran without it. 10 out of 10 for me, many thanks to the uploader for a good quality torrent with clear concise instructions on how to install.
Also if anyone has trouble changing the host file you must change the permissions to allow users to write to the file."

,ulux,2011-04-14T20:15Z,"WORKS GREAT! 
The download downloaded VERY FAST and the installation was also fast, serial works and update works GREAT!!

MANY, MANY, MANY THANKS!!!!"
,repeater1,2011-04-18T21:37Z,"For anyone having trouble instaling + updating:
**************READ**************
1) install: ""CyberLink powerdirector 9.00.2330 by TheAaax9.exe""

2) Run Powerdirector and register with serial.

3) close Powerdirector

4) install update: ""CyberLink.2330_GM2_Patch_VDE101118-05.exe""

**************DONE**************

For the select few having trouble with audio. 
You'll need to uninstall quicktime. No PC should ever need quicktime installed for any reason. EVER. If you want to play .mov or any other Cr-apple proprietary video then just install a ""K-lite codec pack"". That will cover all video codec's you ever want to play encoded in any format from any system you can think of.

Good luck."
