This was Lev Kuleshovâ€™s directorial debut. This work is extremely important not only for Russian cinema; it became a landmark in the history of the worldâ€™s cinematograph. For the first time a specific method of montage had been used in this film, which came to be known later as â€œSoviet montageâ€. Despite the fact that Kuleshovâ€™s films had preceded many discoveries of Vertov and Eisenstein, his works are little known outside Russia. Among his students were Vsevolod Pudovkin and Boris Barnet. In the introduction to Kuleshovâ€™s book The Art of Cinema (1928), his former students wrote: â€œIt was on his shoulders that we crossed into the open sea. We make films â€“ Kuleshov made cinematographyâ€¦â€

Lev Vladimirovich Kuleshov (1899 â€“ 1970) was a Soviet filmmaker and film theorist who taught at and helped establish the world's first film school (the Moscow Film School).

Kuleshov may well be the very first film theorist as he was a leader in Soviet montage theory â€” developing his theories of editing before those of Sergei Eisenstein (briefly a student of Kuleshov) and Vsevolod Pudovkin. For Kuleshov, the essence of the cinema was editing, the juxtaposition of one shot with another. To illustrate this principle, he created what has come to be known as the Kuleshov Experiment. In this now-famous editing exercise, shots of an actor were intercut with various meaningful images (a casket, a bowl of soup, and so on) in order to show how editing changes viewers' interpretations of images.

In addition to his theoretical work, Kuleshov was an active director of feature-length films till 1943. Since 1943 Kuleshov was serving as the academic rector of Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.
