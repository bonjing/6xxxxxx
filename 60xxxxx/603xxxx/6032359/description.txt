"Partners"

Jack and Dan investigate a simple dine-and-dash at 
a local restaurant, but things become complicated 
when Jack's former partner, George Gluck (guest 
star Klein), who is now the assistant chief of the 
department, shows up after Liz's informant against 
a mafia kingpin is murdered. With a dirty cop 
behind the hit, and their lives on the line, 
everybody must learn that the only way to survive 
is to stay close to the ones they trust.

Any fans who still havent, it is time to let Fox
know they have to renew the BEST cop show on all
of television (Unless you are over the age of 50,
then the CBS crap is prolly more your cup of
Mucilex.) Email, write, buy it on itunes, watch
it on VOD, just let em know that Jack and Dan
need to return to bust some more punks.

Enjoy :)
