,jotaj1982,2010-12-17T16:01Z,"There is something very odd with this torrent...
We are all stuck at 63.5% and I already have 132 hasfails, which is just too many for me for regular torrents. 
When using DHT and Peer Exchange, you see 200+ seeders, which can never be contacted by the way, and all trackers only show 1.
Maybe is just me, but any comment would be appreciated."
,MoNgOOsE6,2010-12-18T00:01Z,"this had been upped to rlslog (different group)....trying to download all day and have crc errors with each episode.  i believe its a bad release.  not normal for goodfilms, i've downloaded many of your releases and never had a problem.  thank you regardless!"
[V],GoodFilms,2010-12-18T02:29Z,"It's a big upload, give it TIME!"
,Lars-1,2010-12-18T03:13Z,Yes it is a large file so quite slow but again... It would help if some of these selfish SOB's would give back by seeding after taking.
,jotaj1982,2010-12-18T03:34Z,"LOL Lars-1... you just don't get it do you? Can't you see there is only 1 person that was able to download the whole thing yet?? That is why there are no seeders besides GoodFilms.

@GoodFilms: Do you know why that odd thing with DHT may be happening? I have never seen it before and in fact I'm not using it right now because I don't trust it :S. I know there should only be at most 2 seeders and not 200+ as it shows..."
,TheChosen1_,2010-12-18T14:24Z,Why no seed? Just seed this please....
,TheChosen1_,2010-12-18T14:45Z,JUST SEED THIS !!!!!!!!!!!
