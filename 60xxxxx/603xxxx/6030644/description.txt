Drawn animation is the perfect medium for the dramatic tone of color and light in this story.

All the elements of great drama are found in the stirring tale of Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt and thwarting the Pharaoh's wrath to search for a land flowing with milk and honey. At the epicenter of the action is the development of Moses from a hunted, haunted young man to a wise, charismatic leader. As well as overcoming obstacles from the Egyptians, he had to persuade his own people to have faith, and such power had to be given to him by God.
