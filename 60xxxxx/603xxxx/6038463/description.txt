A while back, we invited BFW artists and our friends to submit songs for a BFW Christmas Album. 
We left the scope for these contributions quite wide - you could write a song with a Christmas or Winter feel, or maybe a song for your love ones, or even get out the sleigh bells and croon like Nat King Cole! It just had to be an original song - we aren't doing an album of ambient Christmas carols! 

What we got has astounded us. 
So we present to you The BFW Christmas Album 2010, a collection of 12 songs with the usual BFW flavour - from ambient to shoegaze to electronic to downright bonkers! 

Please share this album with your family and friends. 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!
