my description of this: the longest and most descriptive documentary of Monty Python. the most interesting thing to me is that all the surviving pythons are there, and what they say is interesting.

here is the official description:

Monty Python: Almost The Truth - The BBC Lawyer's Cut

Originally broadcast by the BBC in 1969, MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS quickly established itself as a British comedy institution, adored by fans the world over. Now, 40 years later, Britain's top comedians pay tribute to the iconic series. Features the episodes: 'The Not-So-Interesting Beginnings', 'The Much Funnier Second Episode', 'And Now, The Sordid Personal Bits', 'The Ultimate Holy Grail Episode', 'Lust For Glory!', 'Finally! The Last Episode (Ever) (For Now...)'.

This is the first time the Pythons have come together for a film project since 1983's Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.
