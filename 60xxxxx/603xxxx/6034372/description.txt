Nosferatu in Flight

English subtitles for Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922) For The Use of Those Watching Nosferatu on A Night Flight Arriving at Tehran Before Dawn







***** Please note that this is NOT a loyal translation of German to English. It is rather a free adaptation of available subtitles of the movie found on Internet intertwined with subtitles of the 1979 remake of the film by Werner Herzog. 
	
As the title suggests this subtitle is meant for a certain ritual of watching Murnau's movie, which is at night and on a flight arriving at a certain destination. However, this subtitle is carefully recommended for other nocturnal journeys reaching the destination before dawn. *****
