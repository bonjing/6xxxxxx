IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO:Spanish Cam ......Thanks mate :)
AUDIO:Line Lu     ......Thanks mate :)

Here we are with our encode of the Spanish Cam of this one. This is a fairly good video source, but we did do our normal work to it of increase brightness,lowered contrast, sharpened, changed the rgb eq and crop and resized. Turned out pretty good... The audio was just demuxed from LU's TS audio and muxed to our video encode... Thanks Bro Nice Work:):P

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
