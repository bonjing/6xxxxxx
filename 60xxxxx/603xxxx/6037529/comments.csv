I will Dl again just in case the first one was bad. "

A/6.5 
V/6.5 
Fairly Good Russian copy but the picture has been cropped quite badly and thereâs is slight focus and audio glitches throughout the film, If your not sure just check out the sample before you download the whole movie... 
Great Disney movie though... 
Many Thanx to raymondhome and IMAGiNE for the rip and Thanx to all the seeders for a fast download...:)"
