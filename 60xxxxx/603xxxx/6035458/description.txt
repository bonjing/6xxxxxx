                   Dexter - The Complete Season 5 (XviD/MP3)


Meet Dexter Morgan. By day he's a blood splatter pattern expert for the Miami Metro police department. But by night - he takes on an entirely different persona: serial killer. But Dexter isn't your average serial killer as he only kills people who fit a very prolific and precise "moral code" taught to him by his late father Harry (he didn't kill Harry, honest), and developed very thoroughly throughout each kill.

Season 5 picks up where the last season ended, and shows us a Dexter who tries to cope with the killing of Rita, his wife, and all the consequences that follow. With the kids at their grandparents and his sister helping him with the baby, he struggles with everyday life trying to find a balance again.
