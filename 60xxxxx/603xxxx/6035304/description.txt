Beck - Devils Haircut [promo].VOB



HQ rare promo music video. "Devils Haircut" is a single by Beck, taken from the album Odelay.

The music video for this song is directed by Mark Romanek. It features Beck walking through various New York City locations, wearing cowboy attire and carrying a boombox. At some points, the action freezes and the camera zooms in on Beck in tableau. Later the camera zooms in on spies that have been following Beck the whole time.

The video has references to the films Midnight Cowboy and The 400 Blows.

At the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards Beck won a total of five "moonmen" awards. Two were for The New Pollution, and Devils Haircut won three: Best Editing, Best Direction, and Best Male Video.

As is common with his Odelay-era songs, Devils Haircut is driven by a number of samples: the drums in the choruses and drum breaks come from Pretty Purdie's Soul Drums; the drumbeat during the verses comes from Them's cover of James Brown's Out of Sight; and the guitar riff was taken from another Them cover (this time of I Can Only Give You Everything from Them Again,) but it was replayed by Beck, rather than sampled.
