SEED YOU FUCKING CUNTS















Doesn't include most splits, but you can get those from the other torrent floating about.
What is different about this torrent is the quality of a number of albums.

Scratch or stitch, Charlie, MxBx 1998/13000 Miles of Light Velocity, Teeny Shiny, Cell-Scape, MxBx Singles 1994-1999, and Bambi's Dilemma are all in FLAC.
The rest are MP3 - mostly 256-320kbps.
