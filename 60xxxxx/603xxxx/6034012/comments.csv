,r-0987,2010-12-12T18:43Z,Could You Tell Me How To Add an external srt file into an mp4 file like make it 1 file or hardcode thwm?

[V],twentyforty,2010-12-12T19:25Z,"@r-0987: By using the mp4 capable player which could use subtitles in .srt format.

If one need to add just subtitle to mp4 (as I previously did but many requested external subs) .srt must be converted to TimedText with srt2ttxt program then muxed in existing mp4 with mp4box program.

Third way is doing full format conversion, re-encoding and I cannot recommend that. 

Standalone media players are too cheap nowadays (from 38 bucks upwards) and regarding huge amount time needed (and energy) and tremendous loss in quality - conversion should be considered as last resort. 

By the way - it's probably too complicated to explain here. This is torrent site, not encoding forum."

I used to occasionally frequent doom9 for advice when I was using Gordian Knot and XVID, but since my main computer went south, I haven't bothered.  I'm thinking it might be good to get back in, what with mkv and x264/h264 being freely available."
[V],twentyforty,2010-12-13T13:55Z,"@azrielle: Doom9 is not right place for keepin'it-simple and to ask questions freely - however, it is the best forum to browse, learn and get the new stuff. You can use Google for any encoding topic/problem you have or to get information needed."
