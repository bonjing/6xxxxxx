STORY
Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarves, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world.

Runtime.......:1h 45mn

IMAGiNE NOTES
VIDEO: The.Chronicles.of.Narnia.2010.Chapter.3.TRUEFRENCH.TS.MD.XviD-SERENiTY .. Thanks
AUDIO: Own

What we did was use SERENiTY TS release and did our own encode from that. All we did was make a small script containing resize, white balance, rgb eq, sharpness, chroma, brightness, contrast etc. had to remove about 4 seconds of dupe frames at 3 separate area's. we used 28 seconds of the cam audio from MTV (Thanks mate) to fill a void as well.. and sync it to our encode.

credit IMAGiNE & to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)
