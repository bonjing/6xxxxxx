        The Fantastic Miss Piggy Show is a one-hour television       
      special starring the glamorous Miss Piggy, who hosts her       
      own variety show, with special guests John Ritter,             
      George Hamilton, and Andy Kaufman (as "Tony Clifton").         
                                                                     
        Under the direction of Kermit the Frog, the Muppets          
      work in the studio control room and, amidst chaos, manage      
      to keep the show on the air. Throughout the show, a            
      romantic triangle develops among Miss Piggy, Ritter (who       
      is smitten with the pig) and Hamilton (who is deeply           
      uncomfortable with the star's romantic inclinations).

        Cashing in on the immense popularity of Miss Piggy,          
      Henson decided to create an entire hour long Piggy             
      variety special, with her performing various numbers,          
      surrounded by hunks of the day. The most interesting of        
      these is no doubt Tony Clifton (aka Andy Kaufman, or so        
      it is believed). The only explanation for this has to be       
      that Taxi was about to premiere its final season on NBC,       
      after ABC (on which this special aired) had cancelled it.      
      It's no doubt an interesting pairing.

                 For the month of December we've decided to      
                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent       
                 calendar will be celebrating the life and          
                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings       
               until his untimely death 20 years ago.             
                                                               
           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing     
         you new titles from the archives, including     
        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips     
      and behind the scenes footage, from every     
          type of source available to us. Our goal        
        is to provide real insight into the vast       
     output of one of the greatest story-          
     tellers of the 20th century, and the         
           many talented performers and enablers       
      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.

                  for the rainbow connection, and remember
