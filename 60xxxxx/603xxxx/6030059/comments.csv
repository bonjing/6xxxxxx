,Strikefear13,2010-12-11T22:49Z,Seems to be giving a missing .dll error when run.  I'm on Windows 7 32-bit.  The missing .dll is msvcp100.dll

If you get the missing dll error, it's because you dont have Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 installed

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86) :

,Mex27,2011-05-10T12:39Z,"Still crashing at start up, even after Visual C++ install =["
,Gaxn,2011-05-28T23:16Z,"Mine crashes at the beggining too. Using crappy onboard hardware, on XP x86. Visual C++ installed."
,Gaxn,2011-05-28T23:18Z,"Oh, and I don't think the hardware is the problem. I can play Runner (and plenty other games) smoothly."
,Simple-.-,2011-06-10T22:52Z,"Not working for me,sadly. When I open it,just black full screen appears,with sand clock in middle and visible windows task bar at the bottom.
It's not even in active processes,so only way to shut it down is to right click - close in task bar."
