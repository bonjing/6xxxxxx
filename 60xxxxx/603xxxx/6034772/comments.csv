ie. it's not required for online safety and stealth purposes.
coz i dont wanna take my 360 again to some pro to flash my lite-on drive from lt+ to lt+ 1.1"
,Charbis,2010-12-16T20:10Z,"Well, better PFI support i think means you may be able to use other discs and the other update is just improved back-up support, so unless those would be beneficial to you im not sure i'd bother. Wondering if this update has any added stealth though ...."
,Charbis,2010-12-16T20:10Z,edit* Back-up support fororiginal XBOX games

[2010-12-15 08:23PM UTC] #fw  c4eva, was there security vulnerabilities in lt+ 1.0 for liteon seen update for PFI scanning came quickly?
[2010-12-15 08:24PM UTC] #fw  1.1 isnt a security fix
[2010-12-15 08:24PM UTC] #fw  xbox1 compat and pfi enhancements
[2010-12-15 08:25PM UTC] #fw  yea I understand that, just thought surely pfi enhancements could be justified as making the fw more rounded and secure
[2010-12-15 08:25PM UTC] #fw  will i be ok if I just stick with LT+ 1.0 ?
[2010-12-15 08:25PM UTC] #fw  yes
[2010-12-15 08:26PM UTC] #fw  pfi to give better reading of disks,no security holes!


----So in other words, its not necessary thank goodness.  Didn't want to have to take my 360 apart again after I just put it back together.  Its just to allow xbox 1 backups and cheaper disks."
,kain.80,2010-12-22T11:25Z,what about LT+ for samsung who know?
,SamuDeAur,2010-12-24T01:12Z,"@Kain
