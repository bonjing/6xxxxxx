C4E's iXtreme LT+ v1.1 for LiteOn and BenQ - Hitachi 78/79 LT+ News
C4E released a new version of the iXtreme LT+ modified FW for ("phat") LiteOn (74850, 83850V1, 83850V2, 93450) and BenQ DVD-drives.

What's new/fixed:
- xbox 1 backup support (iXtreme compatible, DVD9 only)
- improved pfi support

There's also some WIP news about the LT+ FW for Hitachi-LG drives on team-xecuter.com:

Plus after much work and heavy testing, C4E has finished the LT+ for Hitachi 78 and 79 and it is confirmed that they now boot AP25 backups ! We are currently testing and hope to announce the official release shortly. There are also plans to make LT firmware for the older Hitachi drives but without Ap25 as itâ€™s not required. LT+ for Slims is the priority at the moment. FYI iXtreme 1.51 still works just fine with AP25 (many are still using the older Hitachiâ€™s on XBL â€“ however we canâ€™t guarantee that it is XBL safe so use at your own risk).
