,Nickyboy7,2010-12-12T12:23Z,"trialNerror is probably a ghost who is uploading all these  shows. I think you need supernatural powers to be able to upload all these ghsot shows so quickly.

Think about it, makes perfect sense...he is a ghost uploader. We should get the Kling brothers after him."
[T],trialNerror,2010-12-13T02:52Z,"The Klinge Bros.?  Ew, no.  But Katie, tho?  Mm, yes.  Send Kris and Amy, too, and I'll be one happy camper with a tent already pitched."
,ponku,2010-12-16T04:18Z,"Yeah, Science is showing an episode ahead of Discovery. They really need to stop messing it about like this."

When you buy episodes through an online video on demand service there's no logo.

I'm not some inside mole sneaking out episodes."

I watch GL, GH, and GA.
Ghost Adventures has to be the best one out of those 3.  Mostly because it's just those 3 and not a WHOLE production crew.  (I know they took an EVP analyst guy onsite before)"
