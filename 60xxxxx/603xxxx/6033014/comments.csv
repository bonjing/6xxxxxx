only way to change it is through VirtualDub or something like that i'd say...
can't make a copy properly? don't make a copy to begin with."

@Torx8  use the audio button on your remote to skip to the next audiostream :D

same for subs, use the subtitle button 

And I am still downloading but if the encode is only down to 97% of the original, this is a VERY GOOD copy so stop complaining about things you don't understand and learn how your DVD player works (or PowerDVD.. has also next audiostream button). 
So thanks uploader, whish only there were more people seeding, 1 seeder is not much :("
