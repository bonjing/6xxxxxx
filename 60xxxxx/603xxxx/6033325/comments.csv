,Znibro,2011-02-08T14:01Z,"""this film was shot during 253 gigs in 23 countries between 2008 & 2010"" - And all they came up with was 44 minutes of crappy footage. Jesus Christ this is pure shit, Don't even bother too download. "
,thechildofthegods,2011-02-11T00:32Z,"@znibro Why do you say the footage is shit? I'm genuinely interested, I found it a bit boring too..."
,shawnis,2011-04-20T13:48Z,Vilket jävlar liv ni lever! Men det förtjänar ni. Grattis grabbar. Ni gör mig stolt att vara svensk. Grym film också! Sätter min högerarm på att det är avundsjuka svennebananer som kritiserat här ovan. Jantelagen kan dra åt helvete! Gå och häng vid Mojjen istället för att gnälla på hårt arbetande framgångsrika människor.
