[center]Description

This is the official, action-packed review of one of the most sensational seasons the Formula One World Championship has seen in its 60-year history.

The battle for the Drivers World Championship raged all year, with four drivers â€“ Ferrariâ€™s Fernando Alonso, the Red Bull pair of Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber plus Britainâ€™s McLaren-Mercedes star Lewis Hamilton â€“ still able to seize the crown at the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi.

The chase for the championship was so intense that 2009 winner Jenson Button was still in the mix at the penultimate Grand Prix in Brazil, where Red Bull took the Constructors Championship with another incredible one-two.

Plus, 2010 saw the arrival of three brand new teams, amazing debuts from several outstanding young drivers and the return of the legend â€“ Michael Schumacher.

As ever, the Official Review boasts the highest quality footage, including exclusive on-board sequences, and full information on technical developments and regulation changes.[/center]
