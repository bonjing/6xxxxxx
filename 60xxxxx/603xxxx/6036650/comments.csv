Dont mislead by lame skull description"
,LucindaPirate,2010-12-19T21:02Z,"Thanks for the great Toolkit upload, ThumperTM. When clicking the button EZ-Activator, I get: ""Failed to start C:\Windows\KMSEmulator.exe"". The Microsoft.NET is in the C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET folder. It's the 4.0 version.
Any ideas what I have to do?"

PLz reply.How can I be sure that it is a false positive ???Microsoft has made Office 2010 hard to crack!!! At least it seems so as of now!!! "

,bhutu,2011-01-29T17:48Z,"Dear Thumper,
I a running Norton 360 ver. 4 with all the latest updates . It is blocking AutoKMS.exe and treating it as a Trojan !!! But the changelog boasts of reduction of false positives. How can I be sure that it is a false positive. Plz tell me which AV does not flag it as Trojan. I am waiting for your reply."
,donkerinternet,2011-01-31T20:01Z,This is the BEST I tell you and the only one I know that works on x64 version
,paizit0,2011-02-19T12:43Z,"I used the EZ-Activator (as admin etc.) but am still getting ""Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 cannot verify the license for this product. You should repair the Office program by using the Control Panel.""

Anyone knows what's the problem ? Thanks."
,twoonbay,2011-02-22T12:48Z,Well done my friend and I am happy to report success (Win 7 32 bit) and to seed out :)
,twoonbay,2011-02-22T12:52Z,@LucindaPirate....study the readme.txt a little harder.  At the beginning it has the list of things to do like Activate KMS first before EZ Activation...at least that's what I did.
