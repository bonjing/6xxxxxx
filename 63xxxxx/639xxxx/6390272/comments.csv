I wonder what would have happened if he hard realized that was his gift and had gone into gusiness of design and manufacture of great military unforms. He would have been like a rock star of today. The ladies love themselves some men in uniform. There would have been no flippin WW at all. Just big, big parade gigs all over the world. Judges get to vote on who has the best look best move and shit. Then, when some loser wants to vent at Hitler and his crew back in Munich, the rest of the world would be like, ""Oh, no you don't. He's the dude makes our shit looks sharp. Fuck off!!!""

Gaddamm!!! That would have been awesome.

As it turned out, Hitler was a right odious little cunt. "

Educated people know it by the Latin name 'non compos mentis' but less sophisticated people know it by the much more familiar name, 'stupidity.' There is no cure for it and none is anticipated in the foreseeable future. As such, you have my deepest sympathies. "
