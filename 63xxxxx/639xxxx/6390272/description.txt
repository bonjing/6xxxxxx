
Mark Weber, who is the director of the "Institute for Historical Review", says in his address.., "Is an Objective View of Hitler Even Possible?".

The fact that OUTRIGHT lies about Hitler and the Third Reich Germany are widespread and UNCHALLENGED in today's America (as it is also.., in most of the World) !!

The portrayal of Hitler and his regime is GROTESQUELY unbalanced.., not only in the "mass media".., but even in the supposedly.., "authoritative history books" and reference works about that era of history.

Mr. Weber has written extensively on twentieth-century European history.., and is a court-recognized expert on Germany's wartime policy known as the "The Final Solution"...


His presentation here, is 67 minutes long with a GREAT quality of  A9 / V9

As always.., after watching.., do your best to "pass it on".....

"Truth Does Not Fear Investigation"

AND...

"He who Wins the War.., also Writes the History"
