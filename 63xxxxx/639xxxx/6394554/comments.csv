,MelVeL,2011-06-23T12:14Z,Why do you encode at such high resolution .. I love your work but it's just that my home theatre won't read such high-res movies 
[T],CODYBOSS1969,2011-06-27T20:42Z,"@MelVeL :

When I take a challenge and encode something [usually a good  or, better, a winner movie] I chose the quality/dimension/resolution which is not released yet  !   The thing that you need was here for a long time  ago :  
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4521960/Amadeus-DVDRip.DC.AC3.5_1[Eng]1984.avi 
                  I don't say it cannot be done better at a resolution for DvD-Player [stand-alone ][that means max. 720x576]. I'll think about that !! 

Thanks four your appreciation ! Cheers!"

Because most movie lovers appreciate watching their films in as close to original video quality as possible. Preferably, at least 720p
Axxo and the likes is for teens and clueless people."

,dredragon,2012-01-18T21:48Z,People need to stop complaining on TPB. These people are spending time and bandwidth to bring you something free and saving you thousands of dollars. These are all virus free awesome downloads! They even come with subtitle attachments and different language tracks! But still people find a way to complain about something always. Remember limewire when songs didnt come with artwork and you had to hope a file didnt have a trojan and fuck up your computer? I'm just saying... dont be an entitled POS and be grateful! Thanks so much CODYBOSS1969!
