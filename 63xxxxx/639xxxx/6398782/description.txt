"To the Future!"

As graduation looms, Naomi (AnnaLynne 
McCord) makes a decision that could 
prevent her from graduating with her 
class. Liam (Matt Lanter) tells Annie 
(Shenae Grimes) that he doesn't want 
to go to college and Ryan (Ryan 
Eggold) asks Debbie (Lori Loughlin) 
to move to Paris with him. Meanwhile, 
an impromptu wedding takes place and 
Adrianna (Jessica Lowndes) is shunned 
from the group when they find out her 
scheme to get revenge on Silver 
(Jessica Stroup.)

Enjoy :)
