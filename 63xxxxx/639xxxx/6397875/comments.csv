Am I doing something wrong here?"
[T],GirlsOnlyPlease,2011-08-16T07:12Z,"See this is why I prefer Ogg/Vorbis audio with xvid, h264 or Theora video. This isn't the first time I've had trouble with audio on one my my uploads. It worked when I started seeding, now I can't get sound either, but I'm expecting it to be magically fixed at some point like my ""Wet Lesbian Weekend"" one was."
[T],GirlsOnlyPlease,2011-08-16T07:16Z,"If anyone wants me to re-encode this, or to re-upload this using the Ogg/Theora/Vorbis files from http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5818165/Girl_Crush_[2010]_Complete_split_scenes, let me know."
