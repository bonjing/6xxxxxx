Notes:

 - Not my rip/encode. I found it elsewhere, but I think it should be here too. Couldn't find it anywhere in physical form. The audio bitrate is a little overdone and would have made the video higher resolution, and there's some quantization banding when it's darker, but it's still a good enough encode to be enjoyable.
 
 - I seed using "Initial Seeding" which means that the torrent may show zero seeds; disregard this as I will seed for several days until there are other seeds.

 - Please make sure to seed as my upstream is rather slow (256kbps.) Small-scale torrents of hard-to-find large files such as rare movies are more vulnerable to dying if everyone doesn't seed to 100% or higher. Please do your part so free media will always be available. If everyone seeded to 101%, no torrent would ever die.
