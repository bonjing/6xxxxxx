,DayGhost,2011-05-15T02:36Z,I'm currently downloading this.. I'm still looking for a good season 7 tho... jus finished watching all of season 6 and i seeded it all back! gonna do the same with this. If i get it -_-
[V],manOtor,2011-05-15T04:49Z,"You are all welcome ;)!

@DayGhost:
Try the torrent featured in the KABLAM!!! (see description), Season 1-9; there should be a decent season 7 - if you use utorrent (although also other clients have this function) you can choose to only download the files of your choice.

Cheers"

[V],manOtor,2011-05-21T01:57Z,"Just tried redownloading and got 200 kb/s in the first minute.
Check your settings - upload should at least be at 90% if not unlimited."
