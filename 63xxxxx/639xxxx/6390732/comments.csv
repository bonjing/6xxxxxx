,mrbadness,2011-05-14T06:11Z,why dont you tell us what the fuck this is you dumb shit
,zzw1983,2011-05-14T06:22Z,@mrbadness Well aren't you a credit to the human race. If there were any justice you would have been dried to the inside of your daddy's condom. Mindless waste of life.
,slimo8567,2011-05-14T06:31Z,RailWorks is a train simulation game
,bry68,2011-05-14T06:55Z,if its a game it belongs in games
,quadro113,2011-05-14T07:50Z,Thx for the upload.
,zzw1983,2011-05-14T13:50Z,"@FB

Yeah, it wouldn't work otherwise.
Idiot.
Take your little opinions someplace where they matter. I didn't package this, I'm relaying it so those who couldn't find the original upload can get it.
Doesn't that truth make you feel like a big piece of shit.
Added you to the list of people who should have been aborted."
,zzw1983,2011-05-14T14:17Z,Maybe next time you'll do a little research before you flame. The only use for .rwps are to make installation/uninstallation easy.

""in future give better instructions in your readme, then we wont have to work it out for ourselves.""

Ok, first you accuse me of not knowing what I'm doing then you expect me to do the thinking for you. Typical mindless idiot. Look at the huge add-on packs uploaded, neither of those have specific instructions but I still managed to get them working as I imagine everyone who downloaded it did. I'm surprised you can even interpret the keys on your keyboard. Fucking wanker. Mama should have left you in the dumpster."
,zzw1983,2011-05-14T15:03Z,"Salvage whatever scraps of your dignity you can find if you want. You're still a moron. 
""Hi, I'm FBAntilles, and I don't know how to copy/paste folder""
""Neither can I spell DIDN'T, THEY'RE or ME TO"""
,phaids,2011-05-15T06:22Z,"@FBAntilles: You are. Don't bother replying.

Anyways... Thanks for sharing zzwl1983."
,zzw1983,2011-05-15T15:51Z,"You're very welcome phaids ;)
More to come, I'll buy the wagon sound pack and upload it soon. "
,CCALLUMM,2011-05-15T23:42Z,"people slagging this guy off, lay off him, the torrent works perfectly and your all just stupid if you cant do a simple copy and paste install. If you cant install it properly, then BUY the game. Idiots

Much appreciated zzw thankyou :)"
,zzw1983,2011-05-16T00:33Z,"Thanks ccallumm I appreciate it. Unfortunately we have people nowadays like mrbadness and fbantilles who are only tough when they're behind the shield of anonymity of the internet. These spoiled entitled brats should learn not to look a GIFT HORSE in the mouth (unless its their mothers demanding a quick suck). 

I appreciate Railgamelovers uploads which is why I wanted to help him out with a few of my own. Not much but every little bit helps."
,zzw1983,2011-05-16T00:34Z,"BY THE WAY:
There are a few minor bugs in the class 67 (speedometer and train length button) that will probably sorted out by RSC soon."
,Inoetea,2011-05-16T12:41Z,"To install this addons it's so simple. Good job, Zzw... --> Pendolino "
,zzw1983,2011-05-16T17:52Z,"heh, thanks pendolino! 
New upload today!
search 'Railworks'"
,Inoetea,2011-05-19T19:53Z,"Zzw, I've got something special for you."
