,Dulasync,2011-05-15T19:00Z,"Thanks for the upload.  Doesn't matter who likes it or not, you still did a great job to share."
,blue_dawg,2011-05-15T21:08Z,"Whether anyone thinks we ""right-wingers"" are nuts or whatever, the bottom line is the government, and especially THIS government, is forcibly taking our money in massive proportions and doling it out to those who support it's politics. That's wrong no matter how you slice it.   "

,nascarsuxx,2011-05-16T04:31Z,"@blue_dawg You have seem to forgot what caused this economic meltdown. It started when de-regulated the banks ..among other things, the clinton allowed the mixing of credit default swaps and then GW bush furthered deregulation of the financial industry, even to the point suggesting to privatize social security by investing it in the stock market. I laugh at all these people that just watch fox and call it facts without a second thought. I suppose from 2000-2009 nothing bad happened to the security of the US or to the economy of the US, it was just great."
,tynx,2011-05-16T07:32Z,"I live in one of those socialist countries you guys always mention on the news and in your boogieman speeches. And I got more freedom, better social safenet, and a way less corrupt, more democratic political system you lot ever will understand. America has become something twisted, weird and not trustworthy the last 30 years. Not the light and friend we all wanted it to be. Im no hater, but im seriously thinking that if you cant govern your self with your own peoples best interest in mind i feel that the rest of the world probably need to intervene. Wars, economical crisis, religious behaviors....and other crazy things that draw the rest of the world down/back years in progress must stop. You are the shining knight who in a short timespan become the town drunk/crazy. And we all suffer for it. My advice, read....take a breath and stop the crazy. Then maby this world of ours might be on the right path again. Be that knight, the leading nation again....we all once loved. "

,altern822,2011-05-16T22:30Z,"PEOPLE THIS IS NOT A DEBATE PLATFORM,
THIS IS A TORRENT SITE, PERIOD.

You people need to take your political views to your facebook, myspace or other personal pages.

We the people here at torrent download sites such as TPB only want to hear about A/V quality and a short comment, if it's a good movie or stupid. 
No spoilers and no personal political views please...

Thanks for the upload BOZX 
(Your the man or woman) 
I can't wait to watch it and to then comment on the quality of it, l8rs."
,nascarsuxx,2011-05-16T23:25Z,"I'd download it, but I keep getting a connection error. "

,Ardeet,2011-05-17T20:31Z,"The Red team versus Blue team debates and ""my country is better than your country"" play right into the hands of government. They love their sheeple divided, distracted and arguing like this.

Every time you play this futile game you waste energy that could be spent on seeing these people for what they truly are.

Thanks v much for the share on this one BOZX"
,waif68,2011-07-23T16:59Z,"Much thanx 4 the Great Upload. Just wondering, why are so many now converting vids to .mkv format for their uploads? Their is no significant difference in quality vs. size and .mkv glitches more during playback. And yes, I have latest codecs.
Anyways, a big Thank U!"
