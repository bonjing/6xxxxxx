The Mountain Goats - The Life of the World to Come (2009)(FLAC)









The Mountain Goats (stylized "the Mountain Goats") is an American indie rock band formed in Claremont, CA by singer-songwriter John Darnielle. In 2005, New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones praised Darnielle as "America's best non-hip hop lyricist." In 2006, Darnielle was included in Paste magazine's list of the 100 Best Living Songwriters.

For many years, the sole member of The Mountain Goats was Darnielle himself, despite the plural moniker. (During live shows, in what Frere-Jones describes as "a bit of ontological slapstick," Darnielle would walk onstage with his guitar and announce "Hi, we're the Mountain Goats.")

Darnielle remains the sole core member of the band, but has worked with a variety of collaborators over the years, including bassist Peter Hughes, drummer Jon Wurster (of Superchunk), singer-songwriter Franklin Bruno, bassist and vocalist Rachel Ware, singer-songwriter/producer John Vanderslice, guitarist Kaki King, and Annie Clark (of St. Vincent).

Throughout the '90s, The Mountain Goats were known for producing "militantly lo-fi" home recordings (most famously, on a boom box) and releasing recordings in cassette or vinyl 7" formats. Since 2002, the Mountains Goats have transitioned to a more polished approach, recording studio albums with a full band.

The Mountain Goats are currently based in Durham, North Carolina.

The Life of the World to Come is an album by The Mountain Goats released on October 6, 2009. The third track, "Genesis 3:23", was released as a free download via the band's website on July 28. The album peaked at #110 on the Billboard Top 200 albums on its chart debut.

Continuing in their exploration of religious themes, The Life of the World to Come is composed of twelve tracks, each one inspired by (and titled after) a single verse of the Christian Bible. The album's title comes from a line of the Nicene Creed.
