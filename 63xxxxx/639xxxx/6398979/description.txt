"Knockout"

Kate Beckett's investigation into her 
mother's death is reactivated when Hal 
Lockwood (guest star Max Martini, "The 
Unit") - a professional hitman with 
knowledge of Beckett's mother's murder - 
stages a spectacular escape during a court 
hearing. As police launch a manhunt for 
Lockwood, Castle and the team uncover 
evidence of a deeper conspiracy involving a 
mysterious figure with law enforcement 
connections who is linked to both 
Lockwood's escape and the killing of 
Johanna Beckett. The search for Lockwood 
and the quest to identify his co-
conspirator leads to a shocking and deadly 
conclusion.

Enjoy :)
