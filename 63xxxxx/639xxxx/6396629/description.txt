My, that Peter Berlin is quite a package!  One might have wondered (before viewing this) was it only skin-deep?  In fact he has plenty to say, but it might shatter your illusions.  The man seemed to walk right out of a Tom of Finland picture - so much that he even commissioned ToF himself to do a few drawings of him.

Plenty of talking heads, most notable being John Waters (his usual insightful self, been-everywhere, met everyone name-dropper that he is) and Armistead Maupin.

For a guy so obsessed with himself, he seemed a little lonely.  Never met his match, I guess... The excesses of being the object of your own art.



Brings to mind the Magnetic Fields song, When My Boy Walks Down the Street:

Grand pianos crash together when my boy walks down the street...

...Amazing!

He's a whole new form of life.
