###  Storyline  ### 
    
A man finds out that what you don't say to a friend is just as important as what you do is this story of how 
far you can bend a brotherly bond before it snaps. Since college, confirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily 
married Nick (James) have been through thick and thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are 
vying to land a dream project that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), and Nick's 
wife, Geneva (Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside down when he inadvertently sees 
Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur investigation dissolves into 
mayhem, he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. Now, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on 
the biggest presentation of their careers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth to his best 
friend.
