,rachel935higgins,2011-08-16T02:22Z,the subtitles dont work. Am I suppose to do something to make them work?
,rachel935higgins,2011-08-16T03:55Z,"I realize that this contains subtitles but they dont work I get this message when I try to click on the file:
Adobe Reader could not open... because it is either not a supported file type or because the file has been damaged (for example, it was sent as an email attachment and wasnt correctly decoded)."
