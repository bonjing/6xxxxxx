Since their 2008 debut, the Beijing group have become festival favourites in the west with their winning update of Mongolian folk song. It's unsurprising, then, that this second album adds more guitar muscle to their sound (founder Ilchi used to front a punk band), though a noisy guest spot from US axeman Marc Ribot does them few favours. The airy sounds of horsehair fiddle and lute, combined with the rumbling growl of "throat singing", remain their forte, flowing sweetly on prairie ballad "Zhang Dan" and more menacingly on rock-out "Golden Zhuo". An uneven but captivating meld of past and future.
