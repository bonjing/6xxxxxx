Amid the postwar boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, newly minted detective Cole Phelps is thrown
headfirst into a city drowning in violence and corruption. Utilizing groundbreaking new technology
that captures an actor's facial performance in astonishing detail, L.A. Noire is a violent crime thriller that 
blends breathtaking action with true detective work to deliver an unprecedented interactive 
experience. Interrogate witnesses, search for clues and chase down suspects as you struggle to 
find the truth in a city where everyone has something to hide.
Against an overarching plot of violence and betrayal, L.A. Noire challenges players to solve a series 
of self-contained cases as they work their way through the ranks of the LAPD. Each case features 
a distinct storyline with a beginning, middle and end, and each successfully solved case brings new 
challenges and leads Cole closer to the true story at the dark heart of the Los Angeles criminal underworld.
