John Rzeznik

Daryl Hall and the Goo Goo Dollâ€™s John Rzeznik know a little something about what it takes to be a lead singer in a rock band, and they put that experience to good use on a selection from the catalog of both groups on the 42nd edition of Live From Darylâ€™s House. The newest installment of the Webby and MTV O Music award-winning Internet series, which last year made its broadcast debut on WGN America to impressive ratings, will debut at www.lfdh.com on May 15.

The show brought together Hall and Rzeznik for a day-long session that included a stellar seven song set. The two collaborated on the Goo Gooâ€™s hits, â€œIrisâ€ and â€œSlide,â€ both from 1998â€™s triple-platinum Dizzy Up the Girl, with the former also appearing on the City of Angels soundtrack album, where it spent a record-breaking 18 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay charts and was nominated for three Grammys. Daryl and Johnny also perform a pair of songs from the Goo Goo Dollsâ€™ 2010 album, Something for the Rest of Us, including â€œHomeâ€ and â€œStill Your Song.â€ The three Daryl Hall penned numbers featured are â€œDid It in a Minute,â€ a Top 10 hit from 1981â€™s Private Eyes, â€œSome Things Are Better Left Unsaid,â€ on 1984â€™s Big Bam Boom and the rare â€œWant To,â€ originally included on 1997â€™s Marigold Sky, a co-write with the late T-Bone Wolk.

â€œIt was an amazing day of playing music with a legend and then sitting down for dinner afterward,â€ marveled Rzeznik about his appearance. â€œDefinitely a day I will always remember.â€

Says Daryl: â€œI love John! Heâ€™s a great singer with a quick sense of humor and to my surprise, a really professional cook. He can come over anytime and rattle those pots and pans.â€

Goo Goo Dolls have remained one of the most acclaimed songwriting forces in rock music for over two decades. The Grammy-nominated, multi-format chart toppers have enjoyed a string of hits that have earned the band the all-time airplay record for â€œThe Most Top 10 Hit Singles in History,â€ according to Billboardâ€™s Nielsen BDS-based Adult Top 40 chart. Singer/songwriter John Rzeznik has been the recipient of the Songwriters Hall of Fame Hal David Starlight Award, and has penned a series of hits beginning in 1995 with the #1 â€œName,â€ â€œIrisâ€ and â€œSlide,â€ followed by â€œBlack Balloon,â€ â€œBroadway,â€ â€œHere is Gone,â€ â€œBig Machine,â€ â€œSympathy,â€ â€œBetter Days,â€ â€œStay With Youâ€ and â€œLet Love In.â€ Goo Goo Dollsâ€™ newest album, Something for the Rest of Us, debuted at # 7 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, earning raves from such media outlets as Billboard and USA Today.
