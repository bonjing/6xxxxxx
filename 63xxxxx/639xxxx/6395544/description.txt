        Her story touched the hearts of millions

        Adapted from Waris Dirie's best-selling autobiography, 'Desert
        Flower' recounts the incredible story of how an African  nomad
        overcame considerable odds  and unspeakable traumas  to become
        an international modelling  sensation. The inspiring  story of
        an extraordinary, proud  and brave woman,  Diere's story is  a
        modern fairy  tale which  oscillated between  dazzling glamour
        and archaic  rituals. Full  of vitality,  humour and emotional
        depth and enormous compassion, 'Dessert Flower  simultaneously
        offers a  gripping  plea to  stop the  terrible  and  inhumane 
        tradition of female genital mutilation.
