,Tiresias77,2011-05-16T19:17Z,WOW...early Styx... This one is the real Styx (IMO).. Thanks you so much. Great video.
,cheborneck,2011-05-16T19:52Z,"@sabra2 have you d/l'd before? do you have a firewall? also, if i'm the only one seeding and there are many others already leaching, it's taxing my network so just leave it and it'll start eventually."
,Flyfisher61,2011-05-16T23:14Z,Thanks for all uploads from Wolfgang's Vault!
,cheborneck,2011-05-17T03:29Z,Your welcome. They have it set up to watch individual songs which is fine but I decided to assemble them into complete shows with added info. Time well spent and it's still FREE!
,Kilroy672,2011-05-18T03:24Z,This is way cool. What are the chances that we can get either or both of these concerts in mp3 or flac files? Would really love burn both of these concerts.
,cheborneck,2011-05-18T09:17Z,so you want audio only?
,Kilroy672,2011-05-18T13:02Z,"Well I downloaded both concerts, kinda nice to have in audio form as well to listen in car and home. If it can be done??"
,cheborneck,2011-05-20T04:44Z,I'll see what I can do. Gimme a bit.
