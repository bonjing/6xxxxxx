plot

The movie takes place in the year 2079. Forty five years earlier, Earth was attacked by a hostile alien civilization from Alpha Centauri. Humanity has been at war ever since, and all remaining major cities are now permanently protected by electromagnetic force fields as a safeguard against missile attacks from space. Democracy has been replaced by global military government as mankind struggles to defend itself against the alien enemy.
