Ubuntu 11.04 easiest way to install from windows.

run wubi application...
select windows installed drive : eg. c:
select amount of space for ubuntu : minimum amount of 4GB
select desktop enviornment...
install...

that\'s it.... simple and easy... :D

It can be use both windows and ubuntu at the same pc as dual booting system.

No need to do partitioning.

That\'s what I hated to do when I was installing ubuntu through a pen drive. But this will be the pain free way to install. You can also uninstall ubuntu as any other windows application. :D
