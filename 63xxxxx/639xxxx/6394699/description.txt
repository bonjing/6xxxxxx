The second EP from Christian Sibthorpe (or as we know him A1 Bassline) on his own label Tighen Up Records.

Much like his first release on Tighten Up, the Falsehood EP brings you long, well held and layered build-ups bringing you too massive drops of bass & 808 drums using old school breaks as fills.

This style is far from his older, more electronic & nu-disco styled house, but we can forgive him for the oh so heavy drops.

Tracklist:

01 - Falsehood (Original Mix) - 04:34
02 - Lumps (Technological) - 05:11



Don't forget to seed and say thanks!!!
