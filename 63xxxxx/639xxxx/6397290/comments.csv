,Papaoso42,2011-05-31T22:23Z,Upload is great and even at 99.7 percent you can still install it. The last .3 percent is a word file and pretty much irrelevant. The one problem with this program is that it uses 100% of your CPU while it is attacking your local secured networks and as a result it just fried my CPU. Luckily I had a spare but I am just writing this as a warning to everyone. If you are running it and it says that it is using 100% of your CPU then close it immediately. Be careful. 
,donkeydick121,2011-07-17T18:57Z,RobotDevil666x - It works for me and I did test it. I ran it on 2 wifi connections and it took more than 2 days on a fast machine with GPU support. Didn't find any passwords though!!!
,donkeydick121,2011-08-26T21:11Z,"Sorry guys. This software works but it's not very good I've tried it on three wifi keys several times and it found nothing.

I've even emailed Elcomsoft explaining the problem and had no reply.

Elcomsoft have a great racket going, selling software that doesn't work for only 1200.00. Even better than Microswift!!!"
,donkeydick121,2011-08-26T21:13Z,P.S. Don't know why it got stuck at 99.7. I left it seeding plenty long enough.
