- corrected text for Master of Mint text in /localisation/in_nomine_text.csv
- changed localised name of ali_bey_reformed_infantry from infantry to cavalry for all languages in text.csv (as it is actually cav by description)
- fixed Prussian Nation decision so nations with Prussian culture can form Prussia
- In /history/countries/sib - sibir.txt the Sibir are made into a steppe_horde and in the nomad tech group, like their neighbours
- corrected tax amounts in tooltip for vote_on_gemeinerpfennig_desc in httt.csv
- corrected factor=10000 to factor=1000 in Annex Egypt mission in Turkish_Missions.txt . Added any_neighbor_country = { tag = MAM } to Allow and Abort code, removed exists=MAM from both as redundant.

- Update burgundian_missions.txt for Liege and Brabant to grant cores to all of those nations, plus set new effects (the any_owned/previous_owner allows it to handle any provinces that they might have acquired instead of only their original ones) - which in turn required a new modifier to be defined in event_modifiers.txt .
- Modified Braveheart event in /events/MoreRandomEvents.txt to have all forces always spawn in Province 252 Highlands, instead of anywhere in the Highlands region.
- Modify Infamy parameters in The Hanami Festival - Sign from above (event 10009 /events/JapanEvents.txt ) to match the ones in event 10008 The Hanami Festival - Ill omen in the sense that they should grade from 0.1-0.5 instead of all being 0.1 , which makes little sense.


This beta should be save-game compatible with DW 5.0 but there are no guarantees. All suspected problems should be duplicated in a new game started under this beta before being reported.

Make a copy of your EU3 DW installation and install this beta over the copy only; that way if the beta install goes badly you will not have to reinstall the whole game.
