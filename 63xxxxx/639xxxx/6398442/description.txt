 The documentary takes a look at the prison's healthcare unit, where staff assess and
 manage prisoners who may be mentally ill and could pose a threat to themselves or
 others. Regular visitors to the wing include David Charlton, known as Strangeways
 most disruptive inmate, who claims to be disabled. Cameras also capture a prisoner
 trying to escape from the unit after biting a guard.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
