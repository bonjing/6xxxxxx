ExpanDrive 2.2.2 Mac OSX

ExpanDrive acts just like a USB drive plugged into your Mac. Open, edit, and save files to remote computers from within your favorite programsâ€”even when they are on a server half a world away. ExpanDrive enhances every single application on your computer by transparently connecting it to remote data.

New for 2.0
ExpanDrive 2.0 is a major upgrade. We've re-written the SFTP core and it's extremely fast. In addition we now offer support for Amazon S3 as a drive type in ExpanDrive. Our GUI has undergone a major refresh and FTP is much improved. More info is available here

Add FTP, SFTP and Amazon S3 to Finder
With ExpanDrive, you can securely access any remote file server directly from Finder, or even the terminal. No need to open a separate transfer client just for file transfer. ExpanDrive extends the way all applications on your Mac can access data.

Reconnect with grace
Once youâ€™re connected, you stay connected. If you change access points or bring your computer out of sleep, youâ€™ll stay connected. Our robust networking core ensures that if a connection is available, your drive is available.

Zero Configurationâ€”it just works
Our client is dead simpleâ€”there is nothing to install or configure on the server. No complicated instructions. No administrative hassles. Just use your existing login credentials to securely access your remote files.

Powered by MacFUSE
Using MacFUSE, ExpanDrive can do all kinds of things that traditional file transfer clients canâ€™t. MacFUSE is a powerful software library, developed at Google, that helps ExpanDrive to â€œextend Mac OS X's native file handling capabilities.â€
