Living In An Alternate World" (no label) is an early version of the "Living In The Material World" acetate, including outtakes, backing tracks and alternate mixes. The sound quality is excellent (studio recordings), and the cover is an attractive 6 panel insert with lengthy liner notes.

This bootleg is void of the usual repetition and sub-par rehearsal quality of many outtake CDs and is a fairly complete vision-in-progress of George's "Living In The Material World". It is labeled "2nd pressing" and first appeared on the Roaring Mouse label about a year ago.
