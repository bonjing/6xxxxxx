,mianna,2011-05-22T18:14Z,LOL @ Deserve a skull for and opinion? SMH if that was the case we all need to have a skull next to our names. 
,TTWH4,2011-06-15T01:28Z,i may sound like a total retard asking this but how do i get the Digital ID?
,assbastro,2011-07-05T02:44Z,I'm also not getting what Digital ID I should be putting in. Seems required in order to get the Authorization Code that the keygen wants to generate.
,billco999,2011-07-25T15:12Z,"Thanks for the upload... serial gen works, but what is the deal with the Digital ID? feel like a bit of a tool for being stumped on this!"
,billco999,2011-07-25T15:17Z,"lol @ me, i was being a tool. you click the request auth code thing and it gives you a digital id... then you put that into the keygen tool and it creates an auth code... then you go back and use that. works a treat! sweet! thanks Novanity!"
,traceyml,2011-08-23T01:31Z,every time i open it it asks for the serial # and everything after i put it all in 
,krysthal9,2011-08-31T07:55Z,"@traceyml and anybody else who has to re-enter the key each time they start Amplitube:

It looks like an issue regarding permissions in Lion. Amplitube stores authentication information in /Library/Preferences so the permission for ""everybody"" needs to be changed to ""Read & Write"" (default is ""Read only"") so it can write that it has been authenticated. 

For those who do not know how to do so, go to ""Macintosh HD"" or whatever your OS install drive is called. Double click on the ""Library"" and select the ""Preferences"" folder. Right click and click on ""Get Info"". At the bottom you will see a section titled ""Sharing & Permissions"". Click on the lock at the bottom right of the window and enter your password, then change the privileges for ""everyone"" to ""Read & Write"". Start up Amplitube and authorize. After that it should remember that it is authorized. I recommend setting the privileges back to ""Read only"" for ""everyone"" once you make sure it's working."
,blasko_88,2011-10-06T05:53Z,so easy and so good! thanks. 
,hhhhbk2,2011-12-20T02:13Z,Installed perfectly... however I get DAE error 720 was encountered every time I try and record. Please Help
,CarlDelain,2012-01-11T04:28Z,"For some reason none of the auth. codes i'm getting work. I've tried ten different serials from the keygen and then i put my digital ID in but the authorization code is always incorrect. Any ideas? 

G5 PPC mac. 2ghz core 2 duo. OS X 10.5.8

Thanks! "
,CarlDelain,2012-01-11T04:43Z,"*EDIT

Not necessarily incorrect, but it says the authorization code does not match my serial and digital ID. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks! "
,CarlDelain,2012-01-11T07:29Z,"I just used the keygen in the following torrent. 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5396113/IK.Multimedia.AmpliTube.v3.0.VST.RTAS.Incl.KeyGen-DYNAMiCS

Obviously that one is only going to work if you run it on a pc or bootcamp though. Worked perfectly the first time with this one though. Also downloaded and installed the amplitube fender plugin with this keygen. Love the amps in that one. "
,MrSurfer1,2012-02-24T00:28Z,"works like charm, thanks a lot.

,springneckelephant,2012-04-05T22:52Z,"Hi chaps, could some of you please seed this so that I am able to download it, thanks!"

This worked for me about losing all the keygen information.

For those who are stuck at the Digital ID Part, follow the steps:
1. Go to the page of the registration that requires the serial.
2. Paste the serial number.
3. Choose the option that says you don't have a Computer Registration number yet.
4. Choose the option that says you don't have or don't remember your IK ID or something.
5. Click next till the page that shows you your Digital ID and your Serial Number.
6. Copy the Digital ID to the Keygen.app
7. Back to the page where says that you don't have the digital number yet, and choose the option that says you have the digital ID.
8. Paste the Digital ID Serial"
