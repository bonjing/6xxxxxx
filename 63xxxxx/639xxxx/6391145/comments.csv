,headZ,2011-05-14T13:32Z,"The last episode of a show that started out epic and after the CW took it, it went horribly bad."
,rcr29budcar,2011-05-14T16:17Z,"Thats a pretty ignorant statement.  The network that the show is on has nothing to do with its quality.  The damn network doesn't write or direct the shows that it airs.  The CW is the pretty much the same thing as the WB was. And the quality of the shows have been as good on CW as they were on WB.  THE NETWORK DOESN'T WRITE, DIRECT, OR PRODUCE THE SHOWS!  Retard!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-05-14T16:25Z,"And besides the last statement, this JACKHOLE ""eztv"" thinks he's smart by putting a Star Wars clip up labelled as Smallville! Don't understand why people like you want to piss people off, but you should be banned from websited like this forever! Why? Because you're a dirty, lying, SON OF A BITCH! And I mean that in the worst way!  You're probably some little homo, who has no friends, and sits home posting crap to piss people off on the internet all day! Your complete trash! If I had the oportunity I'd kick your goddamn teeth out!  Well, thats all for now. I sincerely hope you have the best of days you SON OF A BITCH!"
,rcr29budcar,2011-05-14T16:29Z,"Why do you want to make people hate you? You've probably got better things to do, like jacking off all day.  Oh, sorry, you probably do that looking at gay porn while posting crap on the internet! Now I'm done. Really. Have a wonderful day son of a bitch!"
,BitHQdvd,2011-05-14T21:27Z,"@rcr29budcar... I don't know if you have PC problems or mental problems, but the torrent is exactly as stated and Good Quality as usual from eztv.

Great Upload !"
,jverz,2011-05-14T21:48Z,"rc29budcar has been trolling the other channels as well. Just ignore him. Thank you for verifying anyway, BitHQdvd."
,arr1829,2011-05-15T00:42Z,"why don't people include all the end credits ?!?
especially galling in this case as just as the classic williams superman theme starts it's cut-off after only a few bars. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
,arr1829,2011-05-15T01:21Z,and this isn't in dolby digital 5.1   :(

[V],blaze69,2011-05-15T17:18Z,"Goodbye Smallville, Welcome Superman :P

Great Video Quality. Audio ain't That Great.. But Thx EZTV Very Much For Making This For The Upload ...  d(>w"
,rcr29budcar,2011-05-15T17:25Z,"I whole heartedly apologize! The first time I tried downloading this it was a clip from Return of the Jedi. After reading the comments I downloaded it again and its perfect! I have no idea what happened the first time, but I was wrong and i'm sorry. This file is perfect and legit."
,Esmad3,2011-05-15T20:27Z,"Quality is fine, script is terrible. What were they thinking? Or are the ppl who still follow Smallville immune to sappy soap-opera style acting and content by now. ""Days of our Lives,"" but with more cgi. "
,joetigercat,2011-05-16T13:02Z,"thanks, ez, for all the smallville!"
