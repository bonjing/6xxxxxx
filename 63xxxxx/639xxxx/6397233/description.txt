This is the BBC 2011 Red Nose Day special edition of QI which was streamed live from approximately 1am to 2am on 6th March 2011. This file replaces \"QI.S08.RedNoseDay.Special.2011.avi\", which I posted on 15th May 2011. This new file has better quality video (but still from a screen capture): XviD AVI 720x400 780Kbps at 25fps, with mp3 224Kbps audio.

It is just the QI show, without the warmup, adverts, or retakes.
A separate upload includes the warmup, show, adverts and retakes.
