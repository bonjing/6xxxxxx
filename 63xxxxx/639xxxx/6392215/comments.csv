,aajkd,2011-05-19T13:45Z,The exact same version as this. You are also trying to steal the credit for the rips from Onionjack on Demonoid.

DivX instead of this mp4"
,bagwell1,2011-05-23T11:08Z,Great! Thanks a lot!
,feelenergy,2011-06-26T12:59Z,"Do episodes of this begin with the ""previously on The Killing"" segment (assuming that this is a show which has such a segment).

Also do these have the closing credits?

Thanks to the uploader in any case."
,TheSageM,2011-07-08T16:20Z,Thanks!
,marthafar,2011-07-11T13:43Z,"@feelenergy: the answer to both your questions is ""yes"". I'm using these mp4 files as the source for a set of DVDs, the first of which is here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6530907/"
,ashbrook,2011-11-30T22:51Z,Many thanks for the upload.  I'm really looking forward to viewing this series and series 2.
