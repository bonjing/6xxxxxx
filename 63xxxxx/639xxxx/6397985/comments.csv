Only 6 days to go. 

@ Salakutt 

Maybe it doesn't work with the popular torrent, this is real and cracked and it is almost double the size, although the other is compressed so i can't say for sure, haven't unzipped it yet.

Nothing to lose by trying though, so a torrent with the patcher and the crack would be nice so we rule that option out (or not). 

Also many thanks to the uploader and of course Skidrow."

Run www.speedtest.net

devide average upload speed by 10... 
So say upload is 3 Mb/s devided by 10 is roughly 300 kb/s. Set client to about 90% of that. So client upload speed 270 kb/s. Toy a little with that speed. like put it on 280 and see what happens or 260.

,Curath,2011-05-17T05:17Z,"Decided to check here while waiting for my DRM-free copy from gog.com to unlock. Nice to see a game company treat buyers as people and trust them to pay for the game even without copy protection to stop them from pirating it. They also refunded me with GoG store credit for the price difference between dollars and euros, so I don't end up paying 1â‚¬ for 1$, and can instead get a couple of free games with that money. Nice. I also hear that they have disabled geo-IP data collection, which allows people from Australia to manually set their location to elsewhere when purchasing the game from gog.com, and circumvent the Australian governments decision to import a censored version of the game."

I checked and it seems that it really is so far a false positive. I tell you what I did. I have Win XP SP3 and I use avast professional edition. The AVAST says it is a win32 malware gen. The msconfig file is unaffected and there are no attempt to override or bring anything from the net whatsoever. I also checked the system32 folder and the hidden TEMP folder from user foler (documents & settings). The game RUNS with the paul.dll file but I have to disbale the antivirus in order to play. I also run a memory check with avast and I did a boot scan with avast. I checked if browsers on my hdd have the same start page etc. So YES, I can say that that file is a false positive so far."

Dude I am not new here, I may have the double of your age though. I know what a crack is and how it works. I also noticed that with everygame even so the cracks are not reported as viruses. So far this is , it seems, the only exception in hundreds of game saw here. In the end, when this was the case (the antivirus reported it as a virus) , it still emerged at least ONE crack which was not reported as a virus so you are not right.

I downloaded the newest drivers from AMD (Not sure if you NEED to do this) and 2. I directly copied the paul.dll into the bin folder of the installation directory. I guess my antivirus automatically stopped paul.dll from transfering over so I had to turn it off to do that. Make sure to check to see if that dll is in your bin folder and if not, it should be! hope this helps"

These are also a couple of the bugs that are known to affect some people with the retail boxed and digital download versions of the game so it isn't the cracked versions here that are at fault.  The missing text is a compatibility problem with the Nvidia drivers apparently.  Turn off the 3D vision drivers and if this doesn't work try the new beta drivers from the Nvidia website.  The launcher problem has not got a single fix yet although some have managed to get around it.  For everyone else we just have to do what those who bought the box are doing and wait for the patch to arrive."

PAUL.DLL MOVE WORK-AROUND

The reason you cant move the paul.dll is cause its on the disc that you most likely mounted with deamon tools or such, go to your downloads folder > DVD2 > Sr-TWB2 > Right click the ISO open with winrar > Inside the winrar navigate to the bin folder > Drag the paul.dll from this winrar folder to your desktop > Move it from your desktop into the installation folder.

Thats as easy as I can make it, hope it works out."

IMPORTANT: if you partitioned your drive to have your OS on a single partition, then if the file was a virus, it would try to migrate to the C:\ Drive and Norton would stop it.

Even if you didn't, it would still be stopped as it's doing something it shouldn't and would be picked up by Sonar."

My understanding (although not 100% accurate, but i think it's somewhat though) is that pirated games like this have cracks. 

These cracks are originally the original file, only that it has been altered by groups of people like Skidrow and such, and anti-viruses are not programmed to know the difference between viruses and cracks, therefore when it detects that a file has been altered in some way, it automatically sees it as a virus, it usually thinks it's a Trojan virus.

That's my understanding of the issue at least, might not be completely accurate."

""You have to create a shortcut to the .exe file that came with the skidrow cracked content. You cannot run it from the ""Launcher"" that is created after installing the game.

I also made a shortcut to the Witcher 2 configurator so I can tweak graphics to balance performance/eyecandy. """

,missinglink1000,2011-05-19T03:24Z,"Once again for the text challenged:
Install the game
run the patcher found in the skidrow folder
TURN OFF ALL VIRUS SHIELDS
copy the paul.dll from the skidrow folder to the bin directory, commonly c:/program files(x86)/the witcher 2/bin
play the game.

Again:  TURN OFF ALL VIRUS SHIELDS OR THE AV WILL SIMPLY DELETE THE paul.dll AND THE GAME WILL NOT RUN.

And for those expecting a similar experience to the original witcher you WILL be dissappointed.  The witcher 2 was designed with consoles in mind so the combat system and just about every other system have been written for the gamepad jockeys.  Like all other devs these days CDProjektRed have sold out to Sony & Microsoft.  Thanks to the uploaders for saving me the money that I would have spent on this game had it even resembled the 1st one in gameplay."

,Nonpoint187,2011-05-19T21:05Z,"slackass99 is kinda right but it's the torrent program. People do not know how to set them up usually leaving everything at the default or an auto configuration which causes issues with download speeds. 


@Cyberdyne12 You're probably connected to me I am giving 1000 kbps out and I'm on Comcast not Verizon :D 

http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/71273042.png

So for everyone having downloading issues you need to follow these settings I am about to give.

Disconnect your router and hook your modem direct to your pc. Routers hold your connection back for various reasons I wont explain. If you're running wireless then you automatically fail at torrenting.

Do a speedtest at speedtest.net to determine you max upload speed.

Vuze users go to tools>options>transfers

Set your upload speed to %70 of your full upload bandwidth. This will ensure you have upstream left over so you don't choke out your downstream and that you're giving out potentially more upstream than you currently are at the moment.

Next set max connections per torrent to 0 which is unlimited and max connections globally to 0 as well. Set max upload slots per torrent to 20.

http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a349/APC18/Mytorrentsettings.jpg

Those are my settings with this connection type.

http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/71273042.png

If you have horrible upstream on your connection don't expect to see good download speeds because torrents mostly work off what you give in. I can upload at 1 MB/s which is %80 of my upstream but I download at up to 8 MB/s. Usually averaging 4 MB/s."

Somehow it kept blocking the start-up. Figured it was my virus shield that was blocking it, I just disconnected from the internet and turned off my virus protection. After that, I could play the game just fine.

Hope this helps, good luck :)"

Keep the Antivirus deactivated whenever you want to play. No need to disconnect internet connection.

Install
Patch
Deactivate Antivirus/shield
Copy-paste Paul.dll
Run game
Keep antivirus off when starting game

run daemon tools, make it to where only 1 file can be mounted at a time.

click on daemon tools and select device:1

browse till you find disk 1 of the witcher select open

click next a few times
wait till your prompted to insert disk 2

click daemon tools ####UNMOUNT DISK 1#### IN DEVICE:1 slot select disk 2

press ok on the game file to continue install.
when its done select finish. exit off the enter serial key screen.

####DO NOT TOUCH A DAMN THING####

(assuming you still have disk 2 mounted) go to my computer. select the virtual drive that disk 2 is running on. is prolly something like F:

DO NOT TOUCH ANY FILES INSIDE THE INSTALLED GAME

go to skidrow folder.
DO NOT COPY FILES

you will see a folder called bin and an exe file
DO NOT COPY FILES

run the patch from the skidrow folder. DO NOT MOVE TO GAME FOLDER.

AFTER U RUN THE PATCH. open the bin folder and copy the paul.dll to the bin folder of your installed witcher game

hit replace when it asks

i even included what not to do several times.

This issue is caused by trying to apply the patch after copying the cracked Paul.dll

1) unpack rar files, if you dont know how to do this, search and download winrar or some other rar opener.
2)Mount the image using Magic ISO or some other disk mounter; or simply burn the iso's to disks
3)install; when this is done, a screen will pop up asking for activation, close this.
4)explore CD 2 and click on the SKIDROW folder, run the patcher. DO NOT COPY THE PATCHER OVER TO DIRECTORY
5) if the activation window appears again, close it again.
6) while inside the skidrow folder, enter the bin folder and copy the paul.dll
7) go to your witcher 2 directory/bin and paste the paul.dll in there. replace.
8) go to main directory and click on the application that is named ""launcher""; this will bring up a menu, click on the options choice to select your graphics.THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU CAN DO THIS!!

,rustyreaper0,2011-05-25T21:12Z,"@Damcios2509
Okay, there are three possible problems as to why your game is not working.
1) you made a mistake because you did not follow the instructions exactly as they are written. If this is the case, then the fix is obvious.
2) the game is to graphically intensive or your computer and it cant handle it, in that case, upgrade your computer or don't play.
3) The game files may have been corrupted while downloading, try redownloading the torrent, let me know if you are still experiencing problems after checking all 3 of these problems. gl hf and gg"

Okay, now that you have told me that the updater is telling you that the copy is no good then i assure you that your copy of the game is corrupt. You can buy it if you like (which i recommend, and i will soon do the same), or you can attempt to redownload the game.

Be sure to run the patch as it says in the instructions. AND TO ALL WHO SAY FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IT MENTIONS NOTHING OF THE VCREDIST_x86. piss poor instructions. My launcher was not coming up at first. Not sure if this helped but i did transfer the data3 rar file into my install also. I tried the launcher again and it took at least 30 seconds to a minute to finally come up with the settings window. after that i was able to start up the game through the launcher.

Browse DVD 2 and go into the SKIDROW/bin folder...copy paul.dll into your bin folder in the install directory.  For some reason this file keeps getting deleted from the install directory.  When I copy and paste it back in, the game will then launch.  I hope this helps."
,TheBoyka,2011-06-04T19:18Z,works perfectly .. i didnt get any virus informantin on paul.dll
,vrocks94,2011-06-04T19:44Z,"this suggestion is for the guys who want the game to be in english only..................

hei u guys don't waste ur time by downloading this torrent instead of this , download the torrent uploaded by extremezone(BLACKBOX) only 6.33 gb.

i have myself downloaded the torrent by extremezone and it works fine(but only english).

extremezone torrent is kind of a repack only and ot works fine....
it decompresses the file and takes nearly 13.3gb of ur hard disk space.

the game lacks nothing not even a single cutscene.

on top of that u can patch the game also with the version 1.1 and then with the version 1.2.

u would find the instructions for patching in the comments of torrent uploaded by extremezone(blackbox) .

i'm nearly into the game for about 12 hrs and it is running flawlessly...

cheers to extremezone........"

,zyonix,2011-06-06T02:19Z,"To those having problems, remember to follow the EXACT steps.

1. Unpack the release

2. Mount or burn image

3. Install (game will auto start with a activation screen, quit that)

4. Run Patcher_EFIGS.exe from the SKIDROW folder on DVD 2

5. Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder on DVD 2 to the The Witcher 2installation folder

6. Play the game

That means not putting the skidrow files in before patching, i did that so I just did a clean install and started the patch before anything."

Just wanted to say game works great, I seeded for awhile after I finished and will be seeding again after I get some play time in.  The only issue I've had is the mouse lagging, and I'm almost sure it's not my comp, so I may just buy the game because it is most definitely worth it!

,nathanex420,2011-06-07T04:53Z,"Ive had no trouble installing or running this game, there is nothing wrong with this torrent. This is all i had to do perhaps it will be helpfull to some of you.

1.) Unpack both disk 1 and 2.

2.) Mount disk 1 using either Daemon Tools, or Power ISO. 

3.) At some point it will ask for disk 2, unmount disk 1, mount disk 2 hit OK.

4.) After install completes launch the game when prompted for an activation code fill the bar with all 1's (11111111111etc) hit ok and the updater should begin, ( there may be another prompt asking if u want to begin patching i forget) if there is hit YES.

5.) Let it patch for awhile.

6.) After abit it will inform u that the 1.2 patcher is ready select OK. ( this should also give u all DLC content available:-)

7.) Then just open up Disk 2 and copy the paul.dll file from in the SKIDROW folder, to your install directory and overwrite the original.

8.) Play the Fuck out of this kick ass game!!!!
     Thats It...

Hope that was helpfull for someone oh, Im running Windows 7 64bit."

2. Mount and install
3. When prompted for product key just hit enter and let it patch.
4. Play the game.

You don't need any crack to play this game 
Here's how to do it
1. Install the game downloaded from this torrent
2. Install Patch 1.1 > http://wpc.420c.edgecastcdn.net/00420C/files/P1_1/Patcher_1.1_International.exe
3. Install Patch 1.2 > http://wpc.420c.edgecastcdn.net/00420C/files/Patch2/Patcher_1.2.exe
4. Play

Thats it... No crack needed... + don't let the launcher to connect to the internet

I've been playing fine for a while on my HD5770, but today when a saved game or new game starts, most of the screen is black, it's artifact-ey as though my graphics card is dying. But Homefront and Portal2 still play fine, and common Windows apps too.

My on-board GPU, HD4200, for the sake of testing, is ultra-slow at the lowest settings but looks like one would expect, not a mix of black, grey, translucent, and transparent.

I'm wondering is it because my copy was internet-detected as not legal yet? I'm definitely buying a legal copy this week though. It'd just be a major bummer if the problem still persists them."

I had the same problem. Do you have any DLC's or mods installed? If so, remove them ALL then try to patch again.

Here's what i did.. (I followed instructions from earlier post) but skipped step 7.

1.) Unpack both disk 1 and 2.

2.) Mount disk 1 using either Daemon Tools, or Power ISO. 

3.) At some point it will ask for disk 2, unmount disk 1, mount disk 2 hit OK.

4.) After install completes launch the game when prompted for an activation code fill the bar with all 1's (11111111111etc) hit ok and the updater should begin, 

    ( there may be another prompt asking if u want to begin patching i forget) if there is hit YES.

5.) Let it patch for awhile.

6.) After abit it will inform u that the 1.2 patcher is ready select OK. ( this should also give u all DLC content available:-)

7.) Then just open up Disk 2 and copy the paul.dll file from in the SKIDROW folder, to your install directory and overwrite the original.

With the torrent above ^^ all you have to do is download the three disks, mount them one by one using daemon starting with the first disk and install. Then, you just mount disk 1 again to finish setup.

Then you just patch it to update 1.2, no cracks or anything. No DRM.

Why would you go for three discs and etc when you have this and a pretty good seed? My download speed was 1.3Mb/s. 

To you others, yes the game works fine and it's one of the best games ever in my opinon. The graphics are great if you can run it on max, but it still is as great if you can't because the storyline and gameplay is epic. I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10.

It's amazing to me no one else seems to have noticed this yet.  

Go check the file-version of your Witcher2.exe if you don't believe me.  It's also proven by how the Mahakaman Rune Sihil sword still won't import from a Witcher 1 save, and that's supposd to be fixed in patch 1.2.

This version of the game refuses to update past 1.1, and I can't find a manual download of the patch lets me install it for this SKIDROW version of the game.

Argh.  I hate SKIDROW.  There's ALWAYS some sort of stupid bullshit they fuck up on with their releases.

Does anyone know what version of the game SKIDROW cracked?
"
,EvilCorporateWhore,2011-07-17T05:32Z,"@ninotores

Well, you must be a fucking idiot because mine patched just fine. At first i couldn't get the 1.1 patch to work because of all the mods i had installed, but once i removed those i manually patched 1.1 then it auto-patched to 1.2 perfectly.

File Version: 1.2.6276.44681

...u mad?"
,ninotores,2011-07-17T06:02Z,"Calm yourself, kid.  I figured out my own work-around.  No thanks to dimwitted jackasses like you.

Like I explicitly stated, the AUTO-UPDATER does not work with skidrow's release.  It goes to 1.1 and any further checks say its the latest version.  And yes, this was without any of the after-release .dzip packs in the CookedPC folder.  I recreated this on 4 different reinstalls so you can say whatever fairy tale you want, I'm still fucking right about this.

HOWEVER, I figured out how to get 1.2 installed.  You just can't use the auto-updater.

- Install game, completely fresh
- Run patcher_efigs.exe from SKIDROW folder on Disc 2
- BUT DON'T COPY OVER THE PAUL.DLL FROM THAT SKIDROW FOLDER, CONTRARY TO THE .NFO'S DIRECTIONS
- download international version of patch 1.1 manually, install
- download 1.2 manually, install

Now it works."
,ninotores,2011-07-17T06:09Z,"The weird part about it all is that the patcher_efgis.exe in the SKIDROW folder on Disc 2 doesn't actually update the game to 1.1 (check the witcher2.exe afterwards, it's unchanged), but it somehow makes the game able to update to 1.2 later on.

If you just install the game, quit the activation code request, and then try to immediately install the real patches, they won't execute.  

And if you install the game, quit the activation code request, and then let the game auto-update itself, it goes to 1.1 and then claims its the latest version.

Why?  I don't know.  Skidrow has the laziest scene QA ever and this convoluted crap is sadly typical with their releases."

Oh, i'm perfectly calm, boy. It was you that was whining and crying like a little bitch because you're too stupid to figure shit out and feel the need to blame everyone but your own stupidity and lack of comprehension. Don't sit there and type bullshit like ""Waaah, waah, it's Skidrow's fault that i'm a complete fucking moron, waah waaah"" when thousands upon thousands of people have managed to figure this shit out on their own. Own up to your own ignorance, son.

I have this version, as i started in my previous reply, apart from me figuring out i had to remove the mods, mine patched perfectly fine. So the FUCK are you whining and crying about it's impossible to auto-update 1.2? If you had a working brain cell in that tiny, little head of yours you'd understand not everyone's rigs are identical, not everyone is going to experience the same issues when installing, and it's not Skidrow's responsibility to baby step every little whiny faggot through the installation. What you DON'T do is put all the blame on the team that provides fags like you with free games, and, if you DO have a problem, then GTFO and get your shit somewhere else. Capisce, kid? lol

Sound like your anti-virus program is disabling the paul.dll file. You need to disable it, add the paul.dll file to the folder, then make an exception path to the game folder so id doesn't keep deleting the file. After the file is in place, you shouldn't get those activation code messages anymore.

,theprivateba3000,2011-11-26T18:36Z,"great torrent.thnx 4 sharing n many thnx 2 Skidrow ;-)

below infos might help those having difficult installing the dlcs/patches:

at the end of game installation when the activation box appear n instead of closing it as Skidrow suggested, I click okay and the game does the auto-patch to the latest patch 2.1. n then i don't even need to crack the game nor run the ""Patcher_EFIGS.exe"" , i just click the game's desktop icon n the game run great.

i tried tis method cuz i've read the article on thewitcher web site:
"" 2. If you are installing the game for the first time or re-installing it, the game will automatically patch online to version 1.1 during installation.

The installation program will ask you for an activation code. However, as the game is now DRM-free, you can enter anything in the relevant field. Installation and patching will proceed automatically. No further activation will be required (my note: actually it will not allow u to type in anything so i just left it blank n click ""okay""). If auto-patching during installation does not work for any reason, download the patch manually, based on your region/version by selecting one of the links below, then run the .exe file to update your copy of the game.

,NeonYouki,2012-01-17T05:40Z,"I found this online.  Maybe we can use it to get our keys instead of cracking it?  I haven't tried it yet.  Also, if 2.0 changes this method, you can always try seeing if they hid the key by using the following command:

psexec.exe -s -i regedit.exe

This will allow you to see registry keys locked to the system user.  (Equal to root user on windows and more rights than admin.)  You need to get psexec.exe which is free as part of the sysinternals package from Microsoft.

    1.Press Windows+R OR click on the Start Menu.
    2. Enter â€œregeditâ€ in the text box (without quotation marks).
    3. The registry is now opened. On the left side of the windows, you should have several folders. Locate and expand â€œHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEâ€ (to expand, click on the small arrow or plus sign on the left).
    4. Find and expand the â€œSoftwareâ€ folder.
    5. Scroll down until you see the â€œAtariâ€ folder. Inside it you should find another one called â€œWitcher 2â€.
    6. Click on the Witcher 2 folder. Now take a look on the right side of the window. Find something that makes any reference to the CD key, such as cd key, license, code, serial number, etc. There you will find your Serial Number."
