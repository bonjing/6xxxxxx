These are all the English Perry Rhodan I have found, plus 5 Atlan Books.
They are all in txt so they will work on just about anything.

If you want to convert them to work in something that won't take txt then download calibre an e-book program that is free and converts most formats to any other format


There is the odd spelling mistake here and there but I have read all the Atlan and 104 of Rhodan and they make great reading.

Enjoy
