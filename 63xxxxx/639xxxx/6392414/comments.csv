I'm running a Windows XP Home Edition, Geforce graphics card 7600 1GB with 1GB RAM. 

the point of this was... Shall I bother downloading these games anymore?

the reason i ask is, as I said, Â£40 for the game on 360 with no hassle and just pure entertainment. 

or

download torrent, wait half a day for it to finish downloading and then after all of that, none of you guys actually have any answers apart from the repetitive answers you've been giving. If my computer isn't good enough, I'm better off spending the Â£4O on the game, rather than 400 quid on new graphics cards and ram for my pc. Oh, and a new OS as well...."

,v7DusK,2012-03-19T06:31Z,"Quite a fun game, cutscenes are silly and funny, great for the kids.

Story mode puzzles can be difficult to work through at times. Not as simple as one would think a Lego game to be.
Levels seem to become hypnotic and monotonous at times.
