Piracy is destroying the NZ music industry!! LOL JK. We don't have a music industry, and it's near impossible to pirate NZ music (there's currently 10 people seeding any blindspott albums). So this is for all you out there who want to listen to some of NZ's best music.

The Blindspott self titled album is from maz_d (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6208066/Blindspott_-_Blindspott).
I do not take credit for this work, am simply putting it into one torrent.
