This is NOT Starcraft 2 beta, this is Starcraft 1 beta and this also includes Brood War. After downloaded, you must unpack the .rar files with a program such as Winrar. Then you must mount the files you see using a program like Poweriso. Lastly, you go to your \"Computer\" folder where you see all of your drives and double click on the drive you mounted the game on. This should install the beta and now use the Beta Gate to log into Battle.net and play. Note that Starcraft is programmed to use Shareware version so you\'re limited to things. Also note that this is beta so expect freezes, long waiting times, and crashes! Still note that YOU MUST have the files mounted on your drive before you play.
