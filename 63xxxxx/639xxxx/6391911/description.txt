Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds is a real-time strategy computer game set in the Star Wars universe.

Players have a choice of factions and campaigns. The factions in the original game include the Wookiees, Royal Naboo, the Trade Federation, the Empire, the Rebels, and the Gungans. There are two campaigns in the game centered on the Wookiee race, and one campaign each for the Gungans, the Trade Federation, the Galactic Empire, and the Rebel Alliance. An expansion pack, Clone Campaigns, was released in 2002, adding two new factions and campaigns. Later that year, both Galactic Battlegrounds and Clone Campaigns were released in a box set, Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds Saga. No sequels have been made, although other Star Wars themed RTSes have been made such as Star Wars: Empire at War.

The games were built on the Genie engine, the same one used in Age of Empires, and Age of Empires II. Online play is mainly played through GameRanger, maintaining a small base of users. Mainstream online play was considerably damaged after Zone.com, the main site for online play, closed down all CD-ROM games on June 19, 2006 due to financial problems. Microsoft has suggested that the game be played now on GameSpy or GameRanger.[1]

The game features the voices of Tom Kane and Charles Martinet; Jake Lloyd reprised the role of Anakin Skywalker.
