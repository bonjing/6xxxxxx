But thats not all, update 4-5 will have random crash that I didnt have with other versions. What I did was to reinstall the game and applied update 1. it is the most stable of all updates. Never had crash with update 1 and could play coop with tunngle without any crash. *make sure the other person doesn't use the shitty update 4-5 and even 3."

Fake !! Fake !! Fake!!"

Just run the ""Portal.2.Update.4.and.5.exe"" then replace cracked content by Skidrow and the game is up to date.

But the file patch.exe seems suspicious and is not used for the update! Do not run it!"
