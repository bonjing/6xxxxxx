What is the problem with people like you? Have you played ALL these games? I doubt it. Instead of making a crappy comment about the fact that the uploader used ""Super Awesome"" in the description doesn't mean games like Minecraft or world of goo HAVE to be included in the pack. That ""Super Awesome"" to me means there is a hell of a lot of content for free uploaded from the goodness of wootloots heart. If you really had to comment could you not just have said ""thanks"" and if you're looking to download games like Minecraft and World of Goo for free then you're just a dick. Indie games are cheap and need/deserve all the money they can get!"
,Boagster,2012-04-12T18:57Z,P.S.  Thanks for the upload wootloot! Good job.
