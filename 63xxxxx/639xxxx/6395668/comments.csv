,RDawgg,2011-05-16T13:37Z,Vielen Dank für das Hochladen dieser Episode von Familie Kerl.
,Willyke93,2011-05-16T15:38Z,"Torrent isn't working for me, I load it in BitTorrent which then stays at 0 seeds and 0 leeches.

Anyone else having this problem?"
,bladesman123,2011-05-16T16:14Z,Thanks eztv
,cordblood,2011-05-16T16:36Z,Thanks eztv! =)
,krazyq,2011-05-16T21:28Z,"Willyke93 - works fine, use utorrent"
,galt42,2011-05-17T00:09Z,"Willyke93 - same problem here, ever since last time eztv went offline for a couple of days.  Haven't been able to see a single seed, leech or anything no matter how many it pretends to have.  (yes I use uTorrent).  No point in even trying eztv files anymore.  "
,candycanegl,2011-05-17T18:42Z,"galt42 - waah waah waah... I just downloaded this in 10 minutes, as usual with eztv. Maybe there's a problem on your end bc I've never had trouble."
,qwr10002,2011-05-18T03:24Z,there something with your computer im downloading it with the speed of 1mb/s .
,dlarrym1111,2011-05-18T09:48Z,"Great download. Very Fast and great quality.
@Willyke93 & @galt42-


I have no idea what your doing wrong, but this torrent downloaded perfectly as have the previous 200+ downloads of his torrents. Make sure your listening port is OPEN in your torrent client app. Also look at the list of trackers and if only 1 or 2 is listed, try some other trackers by selecting ""user added trackers.  It is very curious that literally tens of thousands of ""US"" Do not have any trouble and NEVER have had any issues with opening and using "
,Pike84,2011-05-19T03:07Z,"The torrent works fine - 5min for me.

Willyke93 & galt42 are either noobs or idiot haters."
,galt42,2011-05-19T05:13Z,Pike84 - you're correct - I am an idiot hater.  Can't fucking stand them.
,galt42,2011-05-19T05:16Z,"@dlarrym1111 - thanks for a legitimate response, although the way you put ""us"" in quotes is certainly backs up the notion that something is fishy...as the useless comments by candycanegl and pike84 suggest."
,jmettam,2011-05-19T12:19Z,anyone know where i can get a demonoid invitation code
,MrPirate8,2011-05-19T12:29Z,This is episode 17 - Foreign Affairs
,viothy,2011-05-20T02:47Z,thanks eztv!
,ebud,2011-05-23T03:52Z,"can't wait for e20 (the season finale) to be uploaded!!!
And, yes, it's called e20, because the one on this page should be listed as e19, like it is on FOX's website!!"
,ebud,2011-05-23T03:53Z,can't wait for the season finale to be uploaded!!!
,wipitiza,2011-05-23T05:41Z,"This is NOT Episode 18 ""It's a trap"" its Episode 17 ""Foreign Affairs"" ... BS"
,mp_morgan82,2011-05-26T01:00Z,None of these torrents for episode 18 are correct. they're all episode 17.
[T],scuba-doo,2011-05-27T14:41Z,it works great and is s9e18 ...
,rebel7777,2011-05-27T15:35Z,"Ok, let's try this once again. This is the 17th episode aired this season. I was able to calculate this using math... The scene screwed the numbering up a while back, if they tried to correct it most of you would probably be even more confused. Now the reason fox lists this as episode 18 is because the hurricane episode was pulled at the last second, notice that there is no episode 16. As far as this being episode 19, 8ACX19 is the production code, notice the 8 at the beginning and stop worrying about it, has nothing to do with anything that concerns us. Now, can we put this issue behind us and quietly wait for next season?"
[T],scuba-doo,2011-05-27T15:38Z,"sorry i posted that before i watched (as i trust eztv :P )

this is indeed s09e17  Foreign Affairs  05/15/2011
as i have downloaded evry episode of seaon 9 from eztv i checked each one. And found the error with the episode number started with the e07-e08 x-mas special (which should only be e07.

but quality is usually eztv quality...very good"

,Liquefier,2011-06-05T14:29Z,"@galt42 - pointless paranoia, these torrents have always ran perfectly. The guy who used the term ""US"" was merely establishing this point.

There is no great big conspiracy against you here, just you haven't/have done/not done something and it has caused you trouble.

I dislike the fact you try make out that there is some kind of trickery going on with the supreme and highly credible and reliable eztv just because you are too clueless to run a highly seeded and reliable torrent properly.

If you are d/l'ing from eztv and something is wrong, there's about a 99% chance it is YOU.

This torrent worked perfectly, thankyou eztv, now and as always."
,AndrewHeavens,2011-06-08T18:36Z,This is season 10 ? Well according to Play.com it is :S not season 9...what Wiki says it is ?! 
,xmassacre,2011-06-15T14:25Z,in the uk the seasons are split. So season ten as actually most of season 8 and 3 episodes from season 9. And its only 15 episodes. Sucks i know but thats why i buy the dvds and download the newest from eztv. Thanks again for the quality uploads
