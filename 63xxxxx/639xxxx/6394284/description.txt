Sara Cox and Scott Mills debut as commentators in the first of two Eurovision Song Contest semi-finals broadcast live from Dusseldorf. Performers from 19 countries vie for one of the ten places in Saturday's Grand Final, and UK viewers can help decide by voting. Scott also reports from a red carpet event while Sara interviews guests live in the arena and gets first reactions from the UK's entrants, the hotly tipped Blue.
