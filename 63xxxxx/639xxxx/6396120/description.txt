Britta Persson was born in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1981 and started writing songs while she was a student at the University of Vaxjo, where she was studying science. When not busy working as a lab assistant, Persson would occasionally venture out to perform her songs on campus and at local clubs (she was somehow wrangled into playing a Love and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Awareness event, where tunes like "You Are Not My Boyfriend" and "Defrag My Heart" doubtless had a certain resonance), and in 2005 began writing the songs that would become her first LP, Top Quality Bones and a Little Terrorist. With the help of Swedish rocker Kristofer AstrÃ¶m, Persson went into a studio in 2006, and with Persson accompanied by Peter Hermansson (piano and accordion), Joanna Eriksson (violin), Mattias Friberg (bass), and Per Nordmark (percussion), the album was finished in a week. Released in the summer of 2006, Top Quality Bones and a Little Terrorist became a major critical success in Sweden and received similar buzz throughout Europe.       (Mark Deming, Rovi)

2010 was a stressful year for Britta Persson. In September, she released her critically acclaimed album Current Affair Medium Rare, and her autumn diary was quickly filled with TV appearances, recordings and magazine interviews. But all this was just the result of a long period doing what she sees as her main occupation â€“ writing songs.
