,notoriousUE,2011-05-16T14:04Z,thanks a bunch! great torrent :)
,byers,2011-05-16T19:45Z,Skipping errors on track 5.
,Susquatch,2011-05-16T23:59Z,"byers -- I just double-checked the track myself and you're definitely right. I'm not entirely sure how I didn't noticed it when I listened. It's not a huge problem, but I'll see if I can find a better version, and if so, I'll upload a new torrent (the ""edit torrent"" function is still locked, unfortunately). Thanks for bringing that to my attention."

,rvnval,2011-05-26T03:14Z,"@byers, I finally found a version without those skipping errors. Is there any way I can send you by Private Message or something?"
