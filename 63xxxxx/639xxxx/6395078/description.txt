Many rate this the best song in this years contest, a very catchy number which drew a huge response on the night, I know I was in the Esprite Stadium and wish to say a huge 'Thank You' to our German hosts and the City of Dusseldorf, you were all Wonderbar...  Great camera work, sound, lighting and a giant 1 week International Party the likes of which will live on forever.
