INFORMATION FROM THE ORIGINAL RIPPER/UPLOADER:



"Mega-rare restored vinyl "Scrambled Egg" Speed corrected and rejoined!

OU: According to BootlegZone (LINK BELOW SETLIST), these as-yet unidentified tracks are early versions of "Back To The Egg". I picked this super-rare 7" vinyl in a record store in Milan, Italy in 1989. Unidentified means that exact dates and sessions are unknown, but some tracks are listed as being recorded in July and September 1978. It's a great, humorous set with a fine interview bookmarking the tracks. This EP ran almost a third of a semitone too fast. That's also been corrected.


Lineage: MPL001 LP -> sound Forge ->-34.8 cents speed correction ->Track split up ->FLAC via TLH, level 6, sectors aligned and verified, FLAC integrity checked.

Enjoy!
