,duranachampion,2011-06-12T17:40Z,"the picture quality is horrible. it is so bad that u cant even make out the face of the actors. audio is out if sync with video in the 2nd half.
i wonder why the quality is so bad? it seems that this film was never released on dvd and maybe malikjee ripped it from a vhs. I dont know. 
But my suggestion to filmlovers would be to get a better copy from somewhere else. "

,duranachampion,2011-06-19T15:56Z,"@vardhanj
This kind of attitude that you have displayed is very wrong. When we write a feedback about a torrents quality, we are not criticizing the uploader. We are actually giving relevant information to future downloaders. I totally disagree with your point of view, and would continue to write comments about the quality of malikjee's torrents. I am aware that he is doing all of us a big favour, and i am myself a huge fan of malikjee. But this doent mean that potential donwloaders should not know genuine facts about torrent quality."
