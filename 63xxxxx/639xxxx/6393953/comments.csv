So far I've not been able to find a reliable converter to PDF.  :-("
[V],malestrom_HH,2011-05-15T15:24Z,"Download the application from here

http://www.convertdjvutopdf.com/

Install and after selecting the djvu file,select ""export as"" and save it as a pdf. I tested it and it works. :)"

Thanks for all your great work."
,annabelle31,2011-05-15T19:47Z,"Thanks for pointing me to the converter, it does work. The files get a lot larger, but that's OK.

These books are old (1956?) but they are a very interesting read. I've only browsed them so far, of course. Wouldn't mind having the paper version for my bookcase either!

Anyway, thanks for being you, Malestrom! ;-)"
