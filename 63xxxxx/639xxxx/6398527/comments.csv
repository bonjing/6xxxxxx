English subtitles are available, however indirectly (720p subtitles can be used and will sync perfectly with 1080i, just experiment). There might not be a CtrlHD subtitle but one of the 720p subtitles will work with this. I use the 720p CTU subtitles. They all worked perfectly with the CtrlHD releases until this episode five. Then I used the 720p MrMoody subtitle for this episode and it worked perfectly. I get my english subtitles at www.engsub.net"
