,Nerd4ever,2011-05-15T11:07Z,"The show got potential, but the actor playing Arthur should really really go, everytime I see him, I just wanna gag, I do hope he gets run over by a mob of mutated drunken horses over a cliff. I do believe the one playing as Arthur's brother would be a better lead.

Anyway Thanks for the upload."

haha lol, yeah I'm inclined to agree with you actually. Also there were no black people in 6th century england, I'm in no way trying to offend someone, but when I watch a show about a 6th century king in medieval europe I'd like to believe I'm actually there, not in our ""supreme"" politically correct, multicultural society These things just ruin the experience IMO. Yeah and Arthur gives the impression of a total pussy. "

,ItalianWolfxxv,2011-05-16T13:01Z,"Greetings from Italy thanks for the torrent,I agree with all my fellow pirates,the actor playing arthur is wrong for the part,they should think about recasting it get a young Sean Connery he was the best Arthur and whats with Camelot being an old Roman ruin,its a fantasy show make Camelot a Fantasy city..But we still like the show here in Italy..the wolfman"
