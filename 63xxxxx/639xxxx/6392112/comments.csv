,necrovamp,2011-05-14T17:00Z,been waitin for this :)
,necrovamp,2011-05-14T17:49Z,"I have confirmed this is 100% working, the big thing you need to do, is make an OFFLINE account, for windows live
I am running it right now and can show creenshots and vids for proof.

Run with battlevschess.exe and then make sure when it asks you to make An account, try pressing home, and see if you can play without it, (which means you already have an account and its signed in) or make one, 
but do not make it a LIVE account, it is an offline account"
,necrovamp,2011-05-14T17:59Z,"Step by step

Wait for the game to start and you can see your mouse

1. Click the back button on the top left-hand corner (or press home key)
2. Press home key to bring the menu back up.
3. Choose the middle button to create a profile
4. At the first screen that only contains text, scroll Down and click ""Create local profile) which is a hidden link in the text
5. Complete your profile and play"

,necrovamp,2011-05-14T18:24Z,"For people new to windows live

After the game starts it should immediately ask you to create a profile

1. Click create new profile
2. at the first screen scroll down and click on the hidden link that says ""Create offline profile""
3. Pick your name, and then when it asks you ""Join LIVE free"", just select DONE"
