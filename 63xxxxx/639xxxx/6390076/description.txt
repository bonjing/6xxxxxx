It's my first bootleg from a 2011 concert. This show was taped from the audience. Unfortunately it's incomplete. But the 6 tracks that were taped are great. Meat doesn't sound that good but the entertainment value is high. During 'You Took the Words' Meat invited the crowd to come to the stage and the cammer was able to get completely up front. Giving this a very intimate feel. Batteries run out during 'Paradise by the Dashboard Light' but lucky enough someone else taped that and both videos are mixed together. Sound is quite good and clear too. Unfortunately the video isn't the very best but all in all this is a great DVD for the collection.
