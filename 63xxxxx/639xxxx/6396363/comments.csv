,Soawells,2011-05-20T05:40Z,"I'm having trouble with this dwnld.  I downloaded it easy enough, but when I try to open it, it doesn't play.  It takes me to windows movie maker where the file has an error symbol on it.  Any ideas what could be the problem?"
,sqlife,2011-05-20T09:06Z,"Thanks EZ TV! 
Here's the codec details for anyone wanting to know:
Codec: H.264 - MPEG - 4 
Resolution: 1280x720
Frame rate: 23.976


"
,powers987,2011-05-21T06:33Z,"@Soawells- I use VLC Media Player to watch on the PC, but usually I use the Aleesoft MKV Converter to watch it on my ps3 or psp. Start with VLC and move on from there.

Also, many thanks eztv, I specifically wait for your uploads week after week. Superb job, we all appreciate it very much."
,bbrhino,2011-05-26T02:58Z,"Thx EZTV for the upload and the quality you always give us.  
Will seed for at least a 1/1 ratio, as we all should."
,anonim1979,2011-09-26T21:01Z,"Bad Sound? Episode 1 and 5 not playing?
That is because:
!!!
This FIRST and FIFTH episode from CTU have
F@CKED SOUND.
!!!
They has stereo dolby digital with 5.1 dolby digital header. (check with MPC and media info and compare to other eps)
Many problems with decoders in TVs players and software that presume that coders aren't idiots and/or n00bs and can't cope with errors.
Use ""Avidemux2"" and copy video, reencode audio to stereo 384kbit AC3(aften), and output set to MKV. Save as ""ep01firststep.mkv"". 3 minutes and done.
Unfortunately avidemux generates unseekable .mkv's
You need to demux it using ""MKVextractGUI-2""
and then mux 2 generated files back using ""MKV Merge"".
Have fun.

---
Someone do this and put FIXED/PROPER ep. "
,anonim1979,2011-09-26T23:46Z,"Better and tested method, above can cut audio chanels:
1.
Demux using ""MKVextractGUI-2"".
You will get .h264 and .ac3 file
2.
Using ""MeGui"" open .ac3 file
Set AftenAC3 and click Config to set ""DirectShow"" as ""Preffered Decoder"".
OK,Queue, and in queue tab Start.
You will get  fixed ""...._new.ac3"" file
3.
Mux .h264 and new.ac3 using ""MKV Merge"".
Set fps to 2400/1001 for 23.976fps framerate.
Done."
