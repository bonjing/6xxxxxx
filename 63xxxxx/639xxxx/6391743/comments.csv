,hobbesknd,2011-05-14T22:37Z,@rhflem12345: Interesting way you have for motivating people.
,drumdum,2011-05-16T14:39Z,"I am blowed if I know what is going on. 

Dangerous Moonlight is a golden oldie that everyone's grandmother saw at The Grand in 1941. I can't replicate the vapour trails from the Woodbines that everyone smoked or the large quantities of high explosives being dropped by the Luffwaffe, but I thought it might be a nice gesture to upload my copy.

This attempt hasn't worked. I tried again and the upload finished early this morning, but there is no sign of it having reached Pirate Bay. Meanwhile I am wasting time trying to sort matters out and all I am getting are saucy messages from young Russian ladies (which are nice but forty years too late) and photos of lads showing off their six packs (which I always thought consisted of half a dozen Carlesberg Specials, but apparently not).

So, sorry I couldn't help but that is it from me.
