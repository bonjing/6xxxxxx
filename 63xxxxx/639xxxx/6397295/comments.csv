[V],twentyforty,2011-05-16T16:53Z,"@believenu: Yes, but as I'm not good last few days I wait for some dash of clarity and write properly. Sorry, I have your writing on (and in, literary) my mind."

,believenu,2011-05-16T18:30Z,"don't worry. take care, we do worry about you.. all of us including your ""family "" here."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-16T19:36Z,"@rajmxxx: I have it since yesterday - when you requested ""The Island"" and ""Superman Returns"". Should I erase both? Or not? How in hell with TWO fucking upload slots for movies (still occupied with movies already upped) I should work in reasonable manner?

Meanwhile, read what is written on THIS PAGE:

""Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.""

Guys - do not make me to question every request you would place. You wont like that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-16T19:43Z,"@formerly_azrielle: OK, I would try to get that, but the DVDs are on slowest server in Universe. Be patient, week or even two, I have no clue. As side note, maybe is rip to AVI more appropriate for people who have XviD capable standalone DVD players."
