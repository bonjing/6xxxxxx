I only found out after watching the prequel and being left confused as hell by the ending. "
,ninjette,2011-10-01T23:41Z,"actually it makes sense, the first movie happend after the second movie, and the third movie is before all of that as well. "
,swankyspank,2012-04-16T22:29Z,"@ninjette: you're right as far as the order, however the prequel (2nd film) actually lays over past the original. katie can't get killed by cops and then turn around and kidnap the baby...the alternative endings are nice, but only the theatrical one makes sense for the rest of the movies."
