,kabubuki,2011-05-17T08:10Z,Let's be thankful and show the uploaders some respect in whichever format they choose.
,Setrah,2011-05-17T14:07Z,We are thankful and by no means do we want to offend him. We just want to know WHY. Maybe there is some completely logical reason for our suffering with the RARs.
,neXib,2011-05-17T15:35Z,"The scene is conservative, so they still rar stuff and package by the volume limits. I fucking hate rars. But thanks still to the uploader."
,boltok,2011-05-17T19:28Z,"RAR files suck, but here's the unrar'd torrent I just uploaded:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6400908

Please seed."
,v1tal,2011-05-29T02:50Z,"disk space is cheap, so is internet bandwidth. fuck rar-files!!!

anyway: thanks to sceneline for this upload. much appreciated, mate."
,erik1991,2011-05-29T03:05Z,"Be grateful that they work for absolutely nothing, if you don't like the rars (take 10 sec to unrar seriously) buy the show on dvd.."
,jimbosworldorg,2011-06-05T00:52Z,why do all these [www.speed.cd] torrents get 404'ed from tracker.thepiratebay.org...?  It's SERIOUSLY annoying. >=\
