,willhelm.cz,2011-05-17T17:34Z,Malware generator...  not worth to download!
,rocco_sifredi,2011-05-17T18:15Z,"UPDATE

I checked and it seems that it really is so far a false positive. I tell you what I did. I have Win XP SP3 and I use avast professional edition. The AVAST says it is a win32 malware gen. The msconfig file is unaffected and there are no attempt to override or bring anything from the net whatsoever. I also checked the system32 folder and the hidden TEMP folder from user foler (documents & settings). The game RUNS with the paul.dll file but I have to disbale the antivirus in order to play. I also run a memory check with avast and I did a boot scan with avast. I checked if browsers on my hdd have the same start page etc. So YES, I can say that that file is a false positive so far. I hope that it helps."
,baliziom43,2011-05-23T19:58Z,i can't copy this fucking paul.dll .. please help..
,baliziom43,2011-05-23T19:58Z,and i have turned off my antivirus . I have NOD32.
,theRealKarmine,2011-06-29T23:33Z,even adding exclusions tends to be troublesome in nod32.  ive had to do this with all skidrow releases like ass creed etc/PoP (DRM hell).  best thing is just to disable file system protection from the systray icon then re-enable when done playing.
,kristianv,2011-07-26T07:46Z,"as soon as i extract, paul.dll disappears from my machine. as far as i know, my anti virus is off. help?"
,kristianv,2011-07-26T07:53Z,when i extract paul.dll it disappears and is removed from my machine.. no virus shields active. help?
