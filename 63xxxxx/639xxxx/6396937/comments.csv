Stop putting links/advertising sites on your tittle description.It's not only just one ,but like 20-30 different.This ends here.

Why not spend your time deleting duplicate torrents!!"

Why don't you get a life troll and stop sticking your nose to stuff that doesn't concern you.
Telling me what do to or not is kind of asking for it, don't you think?
What we do and not and why we choose to block certain domains ain't something we need to explain/justify to you or anyone else.This is for the best interest of TPB and it's users.

I won't ban your account for a simple reason.We're better than other sites and believe at freedom of speech.However there're limits as well when it comes to comments against staff/TPB crew.

Thank you for understanding and i honestly hope you get the hint./
