,Sugar_Skull,2011-05-19T17:37Z,"Ya man I'm learning how uploading works still, Didnt mean to step on your toes, I didnt realize it would use the same peers....Any way I took it down. I've been downloading for a while and just started uploading I want to give back."
,Sugar_Skull,2011-05-19T17:55Z,"Actually...I've got a question, I've got shit ton of music from different downloads and from cds I've bought over the years just all over the place man....so how do i make them ""fresh"" torrents without taking from other uploaders.....like what if i want to do a discog. Ive got 3 of the albums ive ripped from the cd and 2 ive downloaded online how do i go about that... Or Hypothetically  say I want to upload shotgun but i dont want to take your peers how do i do that? 
Also thanks for being friendly and offering advice man"

,DeepHole,2011-05-20T00:29Z,"What you're gonna do when you're sitting all alone
In your empty ass home with the motherfucking sawed-off
Pop off the rock ship, pop pop pop off the rock ship! (2x)

My nose is running like me from the police
It's been three weeks and I ain't got no sleep
Now I'm chilling where the players and the hoes be, 
With two broke hands trying to roll weed
Cuz I pop pop pop off the rock ship
You might maybe know a lot of things, baby, not this! 
And I'll do it all again for you, watch this, 
As I limp my ass back to the cockpit
Now start it up, let the engine roll
And all the people in the moshpit scream for more! 
(Yeah! ) You scream for more! (Yeah! ) And light it up
Cuz the way we live our lives seems right to us

Let me tell you people what you need to know
You've gotta plant a lot of seeds for your weed to grow
You've also gotta know when you need to run
You hear that click click click, that's the sound of a shotgun! 

Everybody jumps from the sound of the shotgun
Yeah in my neighborhood, everybody got one! (4x)
What you're gonna do when you're sitting all alone
In your empty ass home with the motherfucking sawed-off
Pop off the rock ship, pop pop pop off the rock ship! (2x)

Woke up in the morning in the county jail, 
And I can't remember yesterday that well! 
Hell I, can't remember when I slept that well, 
I told this girl I've been fucked and get my belt.
Cuz I pop pop pop off the rock ship
You probably heard it all before, baby, not this! 
Hear is the shout to you ladies with the hot tits
Courtesy of Limp Bizkit on some rock shit
(C'mon) Now here we go, (C'mon) start it up! 
Should I remind you motherfuckers that I don't give a fuck
(Hell no) I never have, (Hell yea) I never will
And I will always understand how the haters feel

Let me tell you people what you need to know
You've gotta plant a lot of seeds for your weed to grow
You've also gotta know when you need to run
You hear that click click click, that's the sound of a shotgun! 

Everybody jumps from the sound of the shotgun
Yeah in my neighborhood, everybody got one! (4x)

Everybody's got one!

Pop off the rock ship
