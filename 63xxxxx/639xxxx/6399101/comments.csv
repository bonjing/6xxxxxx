Because they're men attracted to other men.


Thanks eztv! Good as always! :)"
,aParadox,2011-05-17T19:59Z,"It comes from the old days of slower internet, where sometimes you couldn't get large files all at once over dialup- Like usenet, for example, parts are easier to complete a set.
If a group rar's something now, in the age of modern technology, it's just sad and makes them look like script kiddies who enjoy capitalizing every other letter thinking it makes them established in a scene.
But your explanation works too!

(As always, thanks EZtv for quick delivery of high quality content.)"
,m.lowe05,2011-05-17T21:33Z,"Why do people care if people do upload files as RARs?  WinRAR is free and it takes an extra 90 seconds to extract the files.  If you spend 2 hours downloading a file, what inconvenience is the added minute?  It is especially annoying when people bitch about it when the uploader has gone through the trouble of encoding and uploading the FREE files for the public."
,Burunduk999,2011-05-17T23:14Z,"m.lowe05, the problem is, that after you download the .rar, you either have to stop seeding, or to seed the rar (therefore, you can't delete it after extracting, so you need to keep both archived and normal version - and that takes quite some place)"
,pilpas333,2011-05-18T02:22Z,"Tnhx, very good quality and tnx 4 not rar it!"
,m.lowe05,2011-05-18T22:44Z,"Burunduk, I am assuming you are talking about having to create a duplicate file when extracting/unpacking the .rar file and therefore taking up twice as much space on your hard drive.  I can see the dilemma, but with video files you can simply unpack the .rar before you watch each time and it will take an extra minute before the movie starts.  I strictly use piratebay for movie torrents and therefore it is no inconvenience to have .rar files, but I see your point.  My original comment was a complaint to the users that bitch and moan about the format that the uploader has chosen to give them their free movies."
,RHW698,2011-05-20T16:20Z,"I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW STUPID SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ABOUT RAR'S !
DOWNLOAD IT AND EXTRACT IT, MAKE SURE IT'S A GOOD FILE. NOW, STOP SEEDING IT WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT AND DELELTE THE TORRENT FILE. DELETE THE RAR FILE FORM YOUR COMPUTER .
TAAAA-DAAAAAA !!! NOTHING LEFT BUT THE ORIGINAL NON-RAR'D FILE SUITABLE FOR VEIWING !!
TAKES A ME ABOUT 5 SECONDS TO REMOVE THE RAR FILE AFTER I'VE EXTRACTED IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!
DUH !"
,santaclaustrophobia,2011-05-20T21:44Z,RHW698 the point is that they don't want to stop seeding like an asshole.
