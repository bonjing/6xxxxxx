[b][color=blue]WINDOWS SERVER 2008 R2 SP1 - "THE $OEM$ PROJECT" - JUNE 2011 EDITION[/color]

[color=blue][i]aka "The 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse Project"[/i][/color]


We decided at W7V with Fibonacci and Secr9tos to create a $OEM$ folder that will install all necessary packs to get Windows Server 2008 R2 to a Workstation OS.

Till now the only way to do this was either to "sysprep" the release or use RT Server Customization Tool from Ben, involving lots of manipulations and maybe some errors if you are not acquainted with Windows Imaging and Deployment Techniques.

After lots of testing (almost 80 VM tests on all R2 Editions in 1 month) the $OEM$ Folder was ready.

I integrated "this folder" to all editions (Foundation, Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter and Web Server) in the same install.wim file

Works with : Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese-Hong Kong SAR, Chinese-Simplified, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese-Brazil, Portuguese-Portugal, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, and Ukrainian.[/b]

[b]The major improvement of this edition is :

1/ It's not "syspreppred" ! All is done with scripts and batches !

Many thanx to Fibonnaci and Secr9tos for their time and patience ! 

2/ All W7 Extras to get R2 to look like W7 work with the above mentioned LP's !

3/ Added K-Lite Codecs, Flash and Shockwave Players, Nightly x64 and IE9
