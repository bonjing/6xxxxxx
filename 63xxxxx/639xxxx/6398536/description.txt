This review is from: Fast Algorithms for 3D-Graphics (Paperback)
If you're looking for a book to give you details of Graphics programming, I would strongly recommend Fast Algorithms for 3D Graphics. Although Fast Algorithms was originally written for Dos and Unix, I found the text and source to be complete enough to be able to port the source to any Operating System. The text and the code is easily readable; I enjoyed reviewing the real-time shadow algorithm in particular. After reading the book I was able to understand a lot of the graphics work being done while working at Alias/Wavefront. Since then I have become more interested in 3D Graphics and look forward to reading "Open Geometry", Prof. Glaeser's next addition. Over all, I found this book to reveal a lot technical questions I had about graphics programming. The code provided a real time solution to the questions at hand, not like other books that give snippets or pseudo code.
