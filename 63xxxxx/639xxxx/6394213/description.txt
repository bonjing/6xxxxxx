Here is a game that some fellow class mates and I made for a class project. It is a arcade-style zombie game where you protect two barricades from the attack of zombies! 

For sprites, we used Metal Slug, Mario, and maybe some pictures we just found on the internet. Background music comes from the Call of Duty: Black Ops - Zombies Soundtrack. 

Try it out, and comment on it!
