,imJEROME,2011-05-15T15:07Z,WOW. It is good. I would pay to play this at an arcade. :D
,imJEROME,2011-05-15T15:29Z,"Ok. Umm. You just need to add a few sifferent backgrounds and bosses every x lvls and you have a facebook game waiting for you. Also, multiplayer would be good cause it would get boring after a while.. Umm. Make the game in such a way that more skill is needed, because now it is just a matter of spamming x. Just my thoughts. Think carefully about the facebook one! Would earn you some spare money."
,sockkid21,2011-05-15T23:46Z,Really fun! Add some new weapons and new levels and you've got yourselves a winner!
,suckone,2011-05-16T10:53Z,"Haha, I can't make any moneys off of this game, considering I used sprites from Metal Slug and Mario. That would be a lawsuit waiting to happen!"
,petschekr,2011-05-18T23:14Z,"Ok, i sound like an idiot asking this, but how do you click on the play button? UP and DOWN keys to change the main menu option but how do you select it?"
,suckone,2011-05-20T02:16Z,Simply press enter!
,petschekr,2011-05-21T21:43Z,That's the problem. Enter and every other key doesn't select the option. Am I doing something wrong?
,suckone,2011-05-22T11:46Z,"My apologies! I forgot we had made 'z' the main button. So for any options on the menu, up/down are used to highlight an option and 'z' is used to select them. Sorry for the confusion!"
,petschekr,2011-05-22T14:37Z,Thanks. Great game. Very entertaining.
