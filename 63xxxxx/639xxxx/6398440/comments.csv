,jimclip,2011-07-09T21:58Z,You are quite welcome....I do my best to put stuff out there that isn't already floating around (esp. if no lossless version is available). Love KT too !
,msorge,2011-07-10T17:14Z,"Do you happen to have any more of Tunstall's rare stuff (not including what you're sharing right now)?... I'd love to get my hands on anything else available, such as the Live Sessions, Live from SoHo, and Energy Live Session: Live from Switzerland EPs (all of which I'm pretty sure I don't have). Thanks again! :)"
