April 8, The Scarlet Tulip EP

Weâ€™re very excited to announce that you can now get your mitts on brand new KT music!! The Scarlet Tulip EP is exclusively available to download now through KTâ€™s online store and also available to pre-order on CD or Vinyl, or, if you are seeing KT during her current North American solo tour, you can purchase a copy of the CD from the merch stand.

â€œThe Scarlet Tulip EP is a really special body of work for me.â€ says KT. â€œItâ€™s the first time since I was very young that Iâ€™ve set about recording just my voice with finger-picked guitar. 6 of the 7 songs came into being during the year I spent writing for â€˜Tiger Suitâ€™. (â€˜Hidden Heartâ€™ was a song written for Bruce Parryâ€™s â€˜Survivalâ€™ project, to try and gain land protection for indigenous people of the Amazon.)

I felt a creative need to do something impulsive and autonomous, so this EP is partly to celebrate embarking on my first major solo tour, but also to get the songs out there into the ether as Iâ€™ve always felt there is something special about sending new songs off into the world as soon as they are done. Thereâ€™s something magical about it. 
 
It was recorded by my husband and drummer, Luke Bullen, in our solar-powered studio in the woods in the English countryside.â€
