,Delron41,2011-05-18T00:31Z,"And? How was it? It went str8 to dvd, but it looks pretty decent."
,Delron41,2011-05-19T05:10Z,"Wow. I have so many things to say about this one I don't know where to begin. First I thought, well this was obviously designed to showcase Megan Fox's hotness: we get it, she's an angel, but on second thought, it occured to me what this movie is really showcasing: DEAD CAREERS. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the upload though!"
