,Subol107,2011-07-21T23:47Z,serials invalid...
,Flawlessjess,2011-07-25T05:40Z,I followed the steps and it didnt work. Key is now invalid need either a new key or a patch for it.
,After_De4th,2011-07-26T01:49Z,Serials went invalid today 7/25/11. I've been using the program fine until now. In fact I was able to use it today for a little while before it informed the serial was not valid any longer.
