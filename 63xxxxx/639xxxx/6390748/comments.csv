,la_cross37,2011-10-17T18:34Z,"I only download one episode at a time (more if I already have one or more episodes to watch), but because I don't delete them I can still seed all the episodes I've downloaded. I'm currently watching season 1 and the quality isn't the best but it's still absolutely watchable.

Thank you for the UL!"
