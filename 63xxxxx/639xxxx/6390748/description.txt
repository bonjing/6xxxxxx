Note,
If you're coming back from my "Mayday, Air Crash Investigation (Seasons 1-7)" torrent, here are the changes you'll see:

Season 7 was renamed to Season 9.
Season 6 was renamed to Season 7.
New Mayday Special season 6 was added.
New Mayday Special season 8 was added.
New Mayday season 10 was added.

I chose to rename the old seasons 6 and 7 to keep them in line with the new wiki list of mayday episodes, which has been updated since my original seasons 1-7 upload. This measn that if you already have my previous 7 seasons, all you need to grab here are seasons 6, 8 and 10.
