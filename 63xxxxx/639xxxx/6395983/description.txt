A Very Potter Musical (performed and later released in 2009) begins with Harry's second year at Hogwarts. Professor Quirrell the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, reinstates the House Cup Tournament, and a champion from each House is chosen to compete. But when Voldemort uses the tournament to fulfill a plot to return to his body, things take a turn for the grim for Harry and his friends, who must find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes before it's too late. The story takes most of its elements from books 1, 4, 6, and 7.


A Very Potter Sequel (performed and released in 2010* ) begins immediately after the events of the first story, when Lucius Malfoy decides to use a time turner to go back to Harry's first year at Hogwarts and kill him before he can defeat Voldemort. As Harry, Ron, Hermione, Malfoy and the rest of the characters meet for the first time, Sirius Black escapes from Azkaban and the Ministry of Magic responds by sending Delores Umbridge to the school to watch out for Harry, and Remus Lupin also comes to Hogwarts to take up the job of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. Its story is mostly from books 1, 3, and 5.

I have taken A Very Potter Musical (in ISO format) and paired it with A Very Potter Sequel (Act 1 and Act 2, in .avi) for easier viewing pleasure. The volume is low in places, since it is a filmed play, so speakers may be necessary.


This is my first torrent, so I hope you like it. Enjoy the plays!
