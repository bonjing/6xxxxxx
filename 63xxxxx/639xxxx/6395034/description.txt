Victor Victoria is a most favorite of my movies personally in that I find
it does wonders for the spirit to have Julie Andrews show her Germanic
intelligence and wit in making clear that the spirit of the Irish will not
be deprived of its due. That means the best meal in the house and yes - the
house ought to pick up the tab for being graced with such a great spirit as
our own dear Ms. Julie Andrews is - and supremely so!


we ask for your seeding support for German language constituents
Danke!! Michael Rizzo Chessman
