John Stossel examines attitudes and opinions surrounding the forms and sources of energy we use. Is nuclear energy really safe? We have plenty of natural gas resources, but is it safe to extract? Aren't the oil companies just greedy, forcing us to buy in a rigged game? And, should government be in the business of taxing the use or production of some forms of energy, to subsidize other "good" forms?
