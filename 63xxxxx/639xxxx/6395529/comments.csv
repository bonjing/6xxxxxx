I wish I could watch this on tv, but unfortunately it's unavailable in my country..

For someone like me who lives in a country where tv in general is dominated by government-run channels and news in particular *always* has a statist/leftist slant, it's SO incredibly refreshing to see something like this.

So, seriously, thanks :-)"
