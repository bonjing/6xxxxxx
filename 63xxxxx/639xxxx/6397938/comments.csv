,macadamadman,2011-05-17T09:10Z,can anyone confirm if it works??ive alrdy wasted 2 disks on the other disk 1 uploads on tpb and neither work :-(
[T],PirateBoy,2011-05-17T09:54Z,Dude...this is AiTB....it is 100% perfect i m sure...i will work...:)
,elyolker,2011-05-17T13:10Z,It's not about AiTB or not. There are some new Wave shenanigans with this game. There have been conflicting reports about what it works on.
,macadamadman,2011-05-17T15:18Z,this does not work .crashed about 20 mins in
,d_larsson,2011-05-17T16:22Z,Is this game ap 25? I have IXTREME FLASH 1.4 or lower i think. Is there any way to play this game for me? Like patch in ABGX360 or something? 
,poncheck,2011-05-17T16:34Z,"It works, just checked, thank You:)
checked with abgx, patched to wave 2 with wave poatcher(i have ixtreme 1.51) burned with imgburn at 2.4 speed.I would have even bought game like this but I have no job at the time:/aaahh I'm just looking for excuses:/anyway thanks once again:)"
,jps48,2011-05-17T19:13Z,"This works 100%. Thanks a bunch. Burned with imgburn at 2.4x and worked first time. 

So far I really like it although I find it quite hard to get the interrogation questions correct. I'm about 2-3 hrs into the game. Its refreshing to see something different come to the gaming scene. 

Just wish it was on the PC the lack of AA as with any console game is killing me. Visuals are a little better then GTA IV I'd say. Quite impressive for the outdated video card in the 360."
,timmythedl,2011-05-18T01:53Z,wtf is with the shit dl speed? I'm uploading 300 & getting 5!? bullshit!
,Kickstan1786,2011-05-18T04:59Z,This shit doesn't work I wasted 2 DVDs doesn't work do not download people..I wasted I don't want u all to waste da dvds
,croci,2011-05-18T07:47Z,"This is waste of time. Only DVD1 goes throught ABGX360 like it should.

DVD2-3 there are CRC errors and so on (abgx360 v1.05)"
,Fan1,2011-05-18T09:47Z,From what i understand DVD2 and DVD3 dont work but this one does! Tried it myself! Just run abgx to create .dvd file and burn!
,GigaBoii,2011-05-18T13:23Z,"Burn with IMGBURN. You need 3 DVD+R DL discs in order to burn all three. 

Always run thru ABGX before burning ANY game.. DUH!"
,GigaBoii,2011-05-18T13:26Z,"Your worried about wasting a couple of DVD+R DLs, when you probably bought the cheapest ones you can get. What Kodak? Get a life. If you dont like it, upload it yourself, or go buy the fucking game. Losers. Always wining like you own the world or something. JEEZ!"
,FalconTheory,2011-05-18T15:34Z,I didn't downloaded it from here but the rip is the same. And THE FIRST DISC WORKS. For the 2-3 disc. No they dont even work with the patch.... At least the second i sucked so hard with that now.
,Kickstan1786,2011-05-18T15:47Z,U sure disc 2 and 3 doesn't work
,Kickstan1786,2011-05-18T15:58Z,DVD 1 video suckssssssssssss.....DVD 2 doesn't work at all...after patching also didnt work...DVD 3 not workin fuck uuuuuuuu I wasted 4 DVDs on dis shit u shouldnt have upload if dis doesn't work...just to show off dat I m da first person who uploaded the game
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T18:02Z,None of these discs work! After what's usually about 20-30 min into the game (the third level you could say) it freezes because the video crc is missing one file and no they are not releasing patches for disc 1 yet sometimes the disc doesn't need to read the file and it plays but who knows if more files are missing because abgx has no verified game data yet. Fair warning DO NOT PLAY ONLINE until the 3 DVDs are verified in ABGX or you may get banned (about a 75-80% chance).
,SuperTsubasa,2011-05-18T20:27Z,"So.. its working or not? pls ppl that have downloaded and play say something, and the game freezes?"
,Fan1,2011-05-18T21:01Z,Morons! Listen to me! I have 1.51 firmware. Download Disc1. Run abgx latest version on Disc 1. Convert to wave 3 (if using 1.51 fimware)! Burn with IMGBURN on Verbatim! Play! Download Disc 2! Run abgx! It will fail at VID CRC. Download video patch which is found on thepiratebay! Unrar that file so you have an .iso file! Open abgx. In the 'Manually patch or Extract File tab' click patch video and select the video file you just unrared (not the image of the game but the patch). Run abgx 2 times. Burn with IMGBURN on VERBATIM! Play! Disc 3: Repeat the same steps of Disc 2! It works with the same patch! Thats it!
,Fan1,2011-05-18T21:05Z,Correction! Seems the patch only works with the 2nd disk and not with the 3rd! Havent tried on the 3rd so can any1 confirm?
,kaus08,2011-05-18T21:16Z,"IT WORKS!!! downloaded, run into ABGX twice, and burned with Clone CD. (For those who don't know about the update for wave 11 games, first download the update 12625, and install it via pendrive... I have the iXtreme LT and the game works perfectly!)"

,SuperTsubasa,2011-05-21T07:36Z,what can we do on the first disc while we wait for the second one?like how many hrs of campaign of first disc and there is side missions too on the first disc?
,killakittens,2011-05-21T20:16Z,"ATTENTION THOSE WITHOUT LT FIRWARE: 
you can still play this game, or other wave 11 games, you just need to patch the wave file down to wave 3 with the latest wave patcher and then use the activator disk on your xbox that forgoes the security check. only do this on a banned xbox however as you will likely be flagged immediately.

the latest wave watcher can be found at librasoft [dot] fr [slash] 360WavesPatcherINSTALL [slash] INSTALL [dot] EXE"
,killakittens,2011-05-21T20:22Z,^^ i can personally verify this will fix any issues with all 3 disks as well as ive finished the game. you will need to also make sure your xbox is updated to the latest dashboard by downloading the latest version from m$ to a usb drive and updating it manually or you will get stuck in a continuous update loop from the disk since as it cant completely update from a burned game.
