,djtohkee,2011-09-29T12:54Z,"Katosan is full of shit, however its not 320kbps, its variable kbps (VBR)"
,djtohkee,2011-09-29T12:54Z,its VBR with the maximum peak of 320kbps
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-10-12T06:38Z,I'm sure it unpacks perfectly...just some people have problems understanding new programs they've pirated/purchased and they feel like venting when things aren't going their way. I know how to use winrar so .... Thanks for the up andy.
,xcrimsonprophecyx,2011-10-12T06:44Z,"As referenced my previous post, I have looked into this torrent and found what seems a single, perhaps. There is only one song, but it works. I don't know much about this band - just exploring -, but it works for me."
,700800900,2012-03-06T18:07Z,RAR unpacks fine but the file is NOT 320kbps but 270 variable...
