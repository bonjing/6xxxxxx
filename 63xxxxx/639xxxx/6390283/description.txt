|  Why an INT rls                                                            |

|  Suddenly after all those years, this kind of rlses are not accepted       |

|  anymore. The new scene rules sucks big time. Look at our last nukes.      |

|  Radio Express isn't a valid store anymore. It's true, Radio Express       |

|  isn't a normal shop, it's a radio service, delivering promo's. You got    |

|  to have a licence to have access, work for radio or be a registered       |

|  prof. DJ. What happened to the scene lately   The scene used to be the    |

|  place to find all the latest promo's before they were in the stores.      |

|  Isn't that allowed anymore   We are now in  2011, record companies won't  |

|  deliver promo cds anymore, it's all downloaded. And Radio Express is one  |

|  of those places. So how can we tag this rls   As a -PROMO_WEB-   That     |

|  option seems to be forgotten in the latest rules. We were never asked to  |

|  discuss about those new scene rules, and we didn't sign them either       |

|  (never asked). So we are left with one option, to release all our Radio   |

|  Express and Radio Ventures stuff as an -INT-. We are not happy about      |

|  this, makes us sad and frustrated, we used to do this for fun. But        |

|  were's the fun lately                                                     |

|  A question we asked ourself: What about all those Promo Only CDs,         |

|  MmsCanada, X-Mix, and so on... These are no ordinary webshops 2, same     |

|  thing. Nuke them 2 now    Have fun nukeboys, you are slowly killing the   |

|  scene. Good work kids !                                                   |
