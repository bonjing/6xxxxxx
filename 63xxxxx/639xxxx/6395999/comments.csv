,nooralmadi008,2011-05-16T22:04Z,how to burn the game if there is 3 dvd please help how
,Teffekai,2011-05-16T23:36Z,"To those stuck at 99.9%. 

You're probably just missing the abgx log, i.e. a useless text file that has nothing to do with running the game. 

So just burn what you have and play!!!"

,handsofthemoon,2011-05-17T10:57Z,"Game works fine, but for some odd reason I don't appear to be getting achievements.  Anyone else have this problem?"
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T11:04Z,Someone please seed!!! I just need 5 minutes of your time and ill seed for the next 2 days!
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T11:18Z,Someone please seed for just two minutes!!! I swear I'll seed for the next two days!!
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T11:20Z,Ugh this is ridiculous been sitting waiting at 99.9% for a seeder for about four and a half hours now....wtf is with people?
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T11:49Z,2.32 Kb is holding me back I mean seriously why is nobody seeding at all!?
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T12:03Z,"You'll have to sign up for an account but this is a great place to get games and this direct link will lead you to an awesome set including fully verified LA Noire D1 D2 & D3. Just follow instructions on top of page and scroll down to find games, all discs are verified on ABGX and no worries with people that don't know how to be polite and seed! Although I know it sucks for all of you who are at 99.9 and waiting as was I but I started my D1 at 3 and now I'm playin it. D2 just finished downloading and D3 is 4 parts away."
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T12:05Z,"Why did this just go from 1 seeder to 2 seeder when there are 0 SEEDERS! ROFL please fix this, matter of fact PLEASE take it off top 100 along with its two buddies that have no seeders... thank you for not wasting everyone's time. And no thats not for you nismo."
,piccy1997,2011-05-18T15:40Z,"Is there anybody who downloaded this??

bcs I will stuck at 99.9% too :("
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T17:50Z,This is bullshit man what kind of asshole posts something and doesn't even seed it for one fucking day! NISMO12 you SUCK! Please for the sake of everyone else on TPB DO NOT POST ANYTHING ELSE you lazy ass bastard!
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T17:52Z,"Nismo12 you suck dude! What kind of asshole posts something and doesn't even seed for a full day? A fucking douchebag thats who! Listen for the sake of everyone just fuck off and do not post on TPB again, BTW im asking the mods to remove your torrents since they don't fucking work ASSHOLE!"
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T18:31Z,I truly apologize to everyone who is at 99.9% however a formal complaint has been made to three moderators and I have been assured all nismo12's torrents will be taken down to being fake or illegitimate downloads. Once again I apologize to everyone but nismo12 and anyone else who finished this download and didn't seed people like that are douchebags that don't have a life or common courtesy. Also we won't have to worry about seeing anything up from nismo12 again as his account will be banned and any torrents from his IP address will be deleted IMMEDIATELY.
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T18:40Z,Try and delete my comments! Sorry everyone at 99.9% but nismo12's torrents are being brought down due to illegitimate/fake torrents and his IP banned from ever posting torrents again on TPB. Let this be a warning posting a torrent does not just mean throwing up a torrent and leaving it there.
,nismo12,2011-05-18T23:58Z,"hey asshole, i AM seeding and for being stuck at 99.9% that is the ABGX txt file. I wont put that on there. Jesus christ. spam much? and these work just fine bro, i am on disk 3 all from the same iso's that you are downloading. And guess what? I AM ONLINE AND NO BAN AND HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE THE SECOND I GOT THE FILES!!! Eat my balls and go spam someone else."
,bltzr,2011-05-19T08:53Z,"Hi nismo12, is it okey then to burn it even if it is only 99.9% finished, due to the abgx.txt file?? PLS answer.. thanxs"
,Nahmad3,2011-05-19T20:20Z,I'm stuck at 99.9% for 2 days.  Please seed
,yungro210,2011-05-20T20:08Z,what do u change the .txt to can anyone help and why is it stuck at 99.99%
,ryzee_119,2011-05-21T06:42Z,"To all those people saying that this gets stuck at 99.9%. Yes this is true, HOWEVER it is only because the file agbx.txt does not download.

why? I dont know. But it does not matter in the slightest. This file is a file generated by abgx and has no effect on the game whatsoever. So stop complaining.

Also, there is a common misconception about seeders and leechers. They have nothing to do with your upload/download ratio!. Seechers are users who have got 100% completion and continue to upload and thats it.
As no one is getting to 100% (only 99.9%) completion there are no seeders reported.

The file works perfectly. Please think before complaining. nismo spent alot of time uploading these.

Thanks!"
,Munama,2011-05-21T11:35Z,"You can burn it even stucked at 99,9%, it works perfecty.

Thanks Nismo for this great upload, works just fine."
