OK Gang the 3rd and Final instalment of various video tracks from DVD sources all over Europe.   If you wait 48 hours for my seed box to grab this your download will max out your internet bandwidth but as before the first 24 hours are going to be very very slow as my MAXIMUM upload speed on Bit torrent is being traffic shaped down to a pathetic 30 Kilo Bits per Second... Yes that is Kilo BITS not BYTES sigh...

It is time people for us to have our own revolt.   Why pay for bandwidth you do not get because your GREEDY ISP has over sold his bandwidth and the infrastructure can no longer cope.

How about someone going on Facebook and starting an INTERNET REVOLUTION and sort these buggers OUT once and for all.

I PAY FOR 4mbps NOT 0.03 upload speed  (4 mega bits up getting 30 kilo bits only due to traffic 'management' or shaping or basically not giving me what I pay for sigh.

COME ON WORLD LET's all SORT THIS OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Format MPEG2 or VOB (same thing)
Video mostly widescreen 16:9  some have square pixels and you will have to adjust.. Not my fault that is the way they arrive sigh.
Audio CD quality.

PS I have tried all the usual ways of getting round traffic shaping and none work, so this is not encrypted tracking or anything, it is in the clear but MY ISP does not want you to get this in a hurry.   Nothing I can do about that other than use my seed box in North America where I can upload this lot by FTP at full speed.
