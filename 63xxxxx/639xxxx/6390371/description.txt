Saxophonist Ulrich Krieger's Early American Minimalism: Walls of Sound II focuses on some of the earliest composed music within the minimalist style by three major figures of the genre -- Steve Reich, Philip Glass, and Terry Riley. These are some relatively rare pieces, more talked about than performed, and Reich's Reed Phase (1967) is not even acknowledged in his own published work list. Two of the works, Riley's Dorian Reeds (1966) and Reich's Reed Phase, were originally conceived for saxophone, whereas the others are conceptual pieces of unspecified instrumentation, or calling for an unusual manner of performance. Reich's Pendulum Music is for four or more microphones swinging above loudspeakers and Glass' 1 + 1 is scored for knuckles and a table top. In these latter instances, Krieger has realized the pieces according to their original instructions.
