""Not as bad as everyone says...yes this is a knock off F&F movie...it does have its flaws...the acting is not that great...the CG is horrible...and it seems like you see the same race scene a few times just with different cars...if you liked cars its a decent movie to check out...its definitely not the best movie ever made...but its not like they had thousands of dollars to spare.""

I'll pass. :-)"
