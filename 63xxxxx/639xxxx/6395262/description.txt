- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  If you're a Blue October fan, you MUST have this cd. Justin delivers the songs
  differently than Argue, and being acoustic the overall sound is different, but
  this one grows on you, and keeps growing. Colorado 5591, is fantastic, and the
  others are Blue classics that are excellent. Give this one a chance, you'll be
  happy you did.
