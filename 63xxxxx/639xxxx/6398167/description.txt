                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Robert Llewellyn looks at the science involved in the manufacture of a military
 helicopter's fibreglass rotor blades, which can spin faster than the speed of
 sound, and visits Singapore to see one of the world's longest automated railway
 lines. He also learns about a wave-generating artificial reef for surfers at the
 Dorset resort of Boscombe. Last in the series.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
