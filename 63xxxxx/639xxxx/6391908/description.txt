Since long is the Musica Antiqua KÃ¶ln my favorite for Bach. The quality of the recording and the quality of the instruments (they try to use instruments which sounds as they sounded in Bach's time) put them a step above the rest in my ears.

Here it's just nice to see them play in a serene and beautifull setting.

Altough the audio will not satisfy purists on the specs (my HDTV provider doesn't send losless audio), it's still MAK-quality and that's the most important to me.

Enjoy anf fly.
