This is a very russian performance which includes cymbalclashes not heard in western performances and roller-coaster tempos. Since the recorded sound is basically rather low, you might be knocked out of your seat at climaxes if you adjust the level according to the more quiet sections. The poem of ecstasy is discs highlight, a truly revealing performance, where (for once) the orchestration doesn't sound heavy but almost transparent in places. Not a top-notch orchestra perhaps, but committed and with a luxuriant stringsection.
