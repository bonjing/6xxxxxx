After unrar ing it all I get is a PKG file. Sorry but please help?"

,elto73,2012-04-14T10:56Z,"you need a PS3 running 3.55 CFW (custom firmware).  If you dont have this then I am not sure it will load onto the PS3.  Give it a try any way.  
Uncompress the rar file using your computer.  Save the .pkg file onto a USB stick (memory stick)
Insert the USB stick into your PS3
Go to game menu (on the PS3 home screen)
Scroll up and select ""load package files""
Press x and it should download the file from the USB stick to your PS3.
Then in the game menu you should see the Joe Danger application and you can simply select it to open the game. "
