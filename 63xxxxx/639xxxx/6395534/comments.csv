If you guys are having trouble trying to save the file once you retype the ZH-CN to EN-US, take the UIProfile.cfg out to your desktop, do the two changes and then save it, once that is done put it back to where it was (C:\Program Files\Trend Micro\UniClient\Uifrmwrk\). This is a one year subscription, i do not know if it will work once again after removal."

You can uninstall and use it anytime and many times"
