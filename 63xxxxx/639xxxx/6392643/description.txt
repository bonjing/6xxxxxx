Dr. Phil talks to mothers-in-law at war with their sons-in-law and the loved ones caught in the middle. Can these feuding families put aside their grievances and foster a peace?

Finger-Pointing Family

Greg and Amy have only been married for 10 months, but the couple says Amyâ€™s mom, Terry, is ruining their relationship. Greg says his mother-in-law is manipulative and controlling, and she even called Child Protective Services on him for allegedly abusing Amyâ€™s young children. 

Manipulative Mother-in-Law?

Donna, says her son-in-law, Steve, is an abusive parent who hits her grandchildren. Steve refutes this and says his mother-in-law is a â€œman-haterâ€ trying to ruin his marriage. Donnaâ€™s daughters, Rochelle and Shannon, speak up about the family drama, and youâ€™ll be surprised to learn who they think is to blame.
