I know its annoying to get requests only I have been searching and searching for a particular movie... cannot find it anywhere. If by chance you could get the movie ""Cellmates"" I would appreciate it!!! The story line is the one thats:  Worlds collide when hardened Ku Klux Klansman Leroy Lowe (Tom Sizemore) and Mexican field laborer Emilio (Hector Jimenez) are forced to share a prison cell."
