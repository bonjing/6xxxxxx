I have seen this here at this site before a couple of times, you can check this out but after those original 6 people got the torrent file it has become impossible for anybody else to get the torrent to download this great collection. You need to delete this listing and remake another torrent and relist this before anybody else will be able to download it. Thanks again for this awesome set and I will be checking back regularly to get the downloadable torrent."
