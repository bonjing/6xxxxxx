The Tubes are a San Francisco-based rock band, whose 1975 debut album included the hit single, White Punks on Dope. During its first fifteen years or so, the band's live performances combined quasi-pornography with wild satires of media, consumerism, and politics.

The Tubes started as a collection of high school friends from Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona. Two Phoenix bands, the Beans and The Red, White and Blues Band, both relocated to San Francisco in 1969 and eventually merged. The new bands core membership remained largely intact for more than a decade.

Recorded live on Jun 1, 1975 at the Winterland Ballroom (San Francisco, CA)
