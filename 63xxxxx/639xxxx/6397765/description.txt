** Review **

La colonna sonora del gioco Ã¨ stata composta da Jesper Kyd nel 2007. Sei tracce sono disponibili online per chi ha acquistato il gioco, mediante l'inserimento di una password nella soundtrack section del sito della Ubisoft. Altre tracce sono pure disponibili su "Kyd's MySpace" e sul suo sito ufficiale. Le tracce pubblicate, nel loro complesso, sono un misto di cori cantati in latino e cupa musica orchestrale, mentre la traccia "Meditation Begins" Ã¨ una specie di Saltarello con inquietanti sfumature, dark ed ambient, data da voci umane che sussurrano in Latino. Le tracce sono disponibili su iTunes Music Store e su Amazon MP3.


San Francisco â€“ October 16th, 2007 â€“ Today Ubisoft, one of the largest video game publishers, Yearsunced the score for the highly anticipated Assassin's Creedâ„¢ video game is being composed by British Academy Award winner Jesper Kyd. Players will become truly immersed into the mindset of Altair, the game's main character, and the rich environments of the game through Jesper's thematic score. The combination of epic orchestral compositions with acoustic, percussion and vocal performances delivers a deeply spiritual aesthetic with Hollywood flair. The rich and melodic palette, created exclusively for Assassin's Creed, will be discovered by players worldwide this November.
"We listened to many composers before finding the right person for Assassin's Creed. Jesper Kyd turned out to be the perfect match for the title because he is able to create epic historical pieces fused with both traditional medieval instruments and modern synth sounds," shared Jade Raymond, producer of Assassin's Creed. "For Assassin's Creed we wanted the score to capture the gruesome atmosphere of medieval warfare but also be edgy and contemporary. Jesper not only achieved this balance but also underlined the changes in gameplay and pacing in a way that immerses the player even further into the Assassin's Creed experience."
While the graphical beauty and detail of Assassin's Creed is quite evident visually, the music takes on the same level of precision and attention. Each setting within the game has its own theme and distinct musical identity, ranging from the tragedy-stricken city of Acre to the proud stoic stronghold of Damascus to the powerfully spiritual and multicultural capital of Jerusalem.
"I was inspired by the deep and engaging world of Assassin's Creed and working with the visionary team at Ubisoft Montreal was a fantastic experience," said Jesper Kyd. "It was truly refreshing to be given so much creative freedom for such a high profile blockbuster title and I believe we took it to the max."
In such instances as the surreal and hypnotic compositions that accentuate the Assassin's approach to his target, Kyd instilled his immersive style and film scoring techniques in Altair's meditation and stealth modes, while also capturing the action, combat and escape sequences with measured tone that crescendos into a fast-paced fervor.

While the song "The Chosen (Assassin's Creed)" by Intwine featuring Brainpower was made contributing to the game, it was not featured in the game nor its soundtrack. Other songs that were used in previews and trailers such as "Teardrop" by Massive Attack and "Lonely Souls" by UNKLE also aren't present on the soundtrack.
