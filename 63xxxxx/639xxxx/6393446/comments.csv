Chances are, the download will be just as fast if not faster.  Could you please explain?  Maybe I am just missing something here..."
,lievenazerty,2011-05-28T20:29Z,@GopherTee did you try downloading from sony it takes ages!!! and here it only takes 5 minutes
,KillAGuy,2011-05-30T21:29Z,@GopherTee I put this up when the Sony had just released the update so Sony servers were extremely slow 
,Mrcunt,2011-06-09T14:33Z,"This update must have a patch. I installed this  then pannicked cause i thought it might stuff up my 3.55 CFW but i can still use Multiman and now play 3.60 rips.

Thanks alot dude you're the best ;)"
,wesamazmy,2011-06-10T10:24Z,"is this will affect my (games and backeges) installed in my HD? 
iam new with PS3... "
,wesamazmy,2011-06-10T10:26Z,how I can insall this on my PS3?
,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-18T06:04Z,"Do not install this. There is no cfw beyond 3.55 and will be several months after realease if ever, not days or weeks. I have an ofw ps3 (to play what few 3.6 ones I buy used cheap that can't be played on 3.55) and and cfw for my bootlegs. This is ofw and installing it will screw you out of playing backups untill you buy another 3.55 ps3 = increasingly expensive. @Mcrunt I call bullshit without proof. And not another fake youtube video."
,Mrcunt,2011-06-19T02:33Z,"I'm playing Portal 2 at the moment.

,Fuqthegovt,2011-06-19T10:56Z,"All that is is a video of a scam website (probably farming traffic for ad $). And since comments on it have to be approved I bet there's 100's of truth tellers that are not posted. My comment was ""This is a scam, nice fake comments from probably a few people if not from the same guy that posted the video. cfw beyond 3.55 doesn't exist and probably be years before it does as sony learns from their mistakes. I'm sure kmeaw will make some sort of announcement if 3.61+ was ever actually made. Think about it, something this big is NOT going to be released anonomously. It took teams of crackers 3+ years to get the keys and security is even tighter now. It will take at least that long for 3.6+"" And I stick by it. Here's what constitutes proof by my standards: An unedited (no cuts/photoshop/censors/etc) continuous video showing some random ps3 disk going in ps3 slot and then of the system setting screen showing 3.61+ firmware, then of multiman booting Portal 2, in an empty room with just the screen and ps3 in the same frame the whole time (in case a fast one tries to get pulled by having a 2nd ps3 off the field of view). Proof like that doesn't exist because cfw 3.61 doesn't exist and most people don't want to go to that much trouble for a hoax. Maybe in a few years since it took that long to crack 3.41. At any rate I for one am not risking bricking my 3.55 ps3 then having to pay $400+ for another used 3.55. I even waited 3 months for other people to test kmeaw's before I took the plunge after people were bricking left and right on waninkoko's."
,Corbs6,2011-10-08T03:25Z,"This is fake. If anything be on the lookout for the JFW hopefully coming out before the end of the year. For all your PS3 news I'd recommend checking out 

http://www.ps3hax.net/

They are VERY up-to-date with all the recent PS3-Scene news. "
,Fuqthegovt,2011-10-17T00:57Z,Yeah at this point I've pretty much said fuck sony and their stupid ps3 and got a jtagged xbox360. sony can take their POS Uncharted series exclusive and shove it up their ass along with a battery acid enema.
