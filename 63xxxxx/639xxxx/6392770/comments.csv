,ssbdk,2011-05-16T13:03Z,"alriiighty then - i'm sure i'm not the only one who thinks this but Vuze is the best torrent program there is. That's said, now to the movie.

I can't keep thinking that some peeps are FUCKING stupid when they rate a movie..
so

V:10
A:10
M:2/3

I'll explain why: if its a DVDrip - it can only be 10? unless you calculate BRrip as well. because if it isn't top quality - it isn't dvdrip ? :-) then i'd be a CAM or a TS or whatever..

same for sound - either you hear it/understand it or you don't :)

@extremezone THANK for a great upload - shitballs-of-a movie but great upload - love your work man!"

The first 20 min of the movie were intriguing, but then the whole movie went downhill surprisingly fast. By the middle of the movie, you already get bored. By the end of the movie everything stops making any sense and becomes just ridiculous. "
,peray0,2011-05-17T07:04Z,"Ty extremezone, no doubt will this be in awesome quality.

For anyone bashing the movie, take this in concideration. This movie is intentionally made ""stupidly cliche"". Drive Angry is all about the action and comedy trough various stupidly overdone scenes. You shouldnt watch this movie thinking that it's godfather or anything. It's a comedy, a chill movie to watch !:D"
