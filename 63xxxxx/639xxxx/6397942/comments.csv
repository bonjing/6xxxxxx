[V],Big_dude,2011-05-17T01:41Z,"Uh AiTB did you check on the video issue is this patched?

Some reason I don't know if its a another form of copy protection attempt."

,Fan1,2011-05-17T20:07Z,Does this work without the frickin patch? Or is it patched? Some1 answer right now!
,Kickstan1786,2011-05-18T04:58Z,This shit doesn't work I wasted 2 DVDs doesn't work do not download people..I wasted I don't want u all to waste da dvds
,croci,2011-05-18T07:37Z,This release aint going throught ABGX360 v1.05 like it should.
,FalconTheory,2011-05-18T13:39Z,I ran it trough abgx a lot of time did everything I read. Still get a CRC error so I think its a bad rip. I do what i should so I think its the games fault. Prove me otherwise if im wrong.
,Kickstan1786,2011-05-18T15:57Z,DVD 1 video suckssssssssssss.....DVD 2 doesn't work at all...after patching also didnt work...DVD 3 not workin fuck uuuuuuuu I wasted 4 DVDs on dis shit u shouldnt have upload if dis doesn't work...just to show off dat I m da first person who uploaded the game
,DanoTheWidowMaker,2011-05-18T16:52Z,The DVD1 passes abxg just fine and plays smooth on my ixtreme lt 1.1 modded system. Don't listen to the others that dont know what they are doin. Its legit so I'm seeding. 
,DanoTheWidowMaker,2011-05-18T16:56Z,DVD2 (in abxg) was showing all good exept that the CRC doesnt match. This could just mean that ABXG hasnt updated the patch for deeper in the game. I'm going to run DVD3 here soon too. 
,daenameetae,2011-05-18T17:09Z,abgx is automatically correcting the video error now
,daenameetae,2011-05-18T17:10Z,"for disc 2, all others are fine except they are all ssv1 but abgx has all ssv2 files for all 3 discs"

The Video + V0 CRC's don't match on the first pass through ABGX but ABGX will fix this at the end of the first pass. The above is the report for the second pass. Make sure that you have the Wave 11 image in your ABGX StealthFiles folder and that your XBox has the latest 12625 dash update along with the latest LT firmware for your drive!"

,bitchmagnet,2011-05-26T07:02Z,"@galexwong95 - you need to get all waves after 7th, not just 11th. 7th too though if you haven't downloaded waves in a long time."
,bitchmagnet,2011-05-26T07:10Z,"and open ABGX360, hit Ctrl+F and check where your StealthFiles-directory is."
