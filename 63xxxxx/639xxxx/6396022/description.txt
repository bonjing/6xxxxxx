Gentle easy-listening to funk, dub, trip-hop and clear female vocals. Main language - Ukrainian, extra sauce - French. Russia has already released three albums, one more beautiful than another. From Â«LemonÂ» and not frowned on Â«SexÂ» and not vulgarized from Â«Tourist ZoneÂ» not lost cosmopolitanism. 
 In all seriousness can be recommended for listening in as the most adequate lounge in the former Soviet space. Because it is round and not sharp, as befits a good izi, with interesting and varied. Mix of languages, from Ukrainian to English words to convincing the French, generally sounds at the level of conceptual discoveries - though each of the adverbs is tested for compatibility with light music (and all - successfully). And Olga's "Little" Gerasimova such a lovely tone of voice and a perfected pitch, that sometimes you want to jump for joy, because, anyway, but really decent female vocals in our lounge area has not been since the first album, "Spring on the streets of Charles Johan.
