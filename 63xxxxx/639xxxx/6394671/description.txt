:Plot::
 Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) is a young dancer with a prestigious New York City ballet company. She lives with her overbearing mother, Erica (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer turned amateur artist who tries to control much of Nina's life.

The ballet company is preparing for a production of Swan Lake. The director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), has to cast a new principal dancer. The lead must be able to portray both the innocent, fragile White Swan and her dark, sensual, evil twin, the Black Swan. Nina is selected to compete for the part alongside several other dancers. After seeing her audition, the director tells Nina that he does not intend to cast her as the Swan Queen. When Nina visits him later to ask him to reconsider and give her the role, he tells her that her rigid technique makes her ideal for the White Swan, but she lacks the passion to dance the Black Swan. When he forces a kiss on her, she bites him. This he takes to be a great sign; he gives her the role.
