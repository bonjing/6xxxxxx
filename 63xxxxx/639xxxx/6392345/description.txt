Research by IDC shows that up to 40% of employee
Internet access is non-work related. While shutting
off Internet access is impractical, Internet
monitoring and access control software enables network
administrators to reduce unproductive Internet use:
GFI WebMonitor helps you boost employee productivity
by giving you the ability to monitor and control
Internet access in real time, ensuring that employee
web browsing activity is aligned with business needs,
and that any files downloaded are free of viruses and
other malware.
