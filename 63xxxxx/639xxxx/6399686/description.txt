[B][U][SIZE="3"]Plot[/SIZE][/U][/B]

Several hundred years ago elders in a tribe thought the best punishment of wrong-doers was death - by pushing them down a deep ravine to fall and die. Years later, a divorced woman named Sanjana, comes to live in a nearby house with her brother, Vicky, and two young daughters. She does not realize that the sum-total of the wretched souls have combined into one giant unseen and unfelt entity - who will force Sanjana to enter their dark, horrifying world - by luring one of her daughters in it, and start to sexually assault Sanjana. Sanjana attempts to fight this evil force is met by skepticism by people around her, and she must now make up her mind to give up her daughter, and start her life elsewhere, or continue on with her nightmarish life until the evil force finally kills her.
