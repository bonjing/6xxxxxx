 Product/Beta Release
 Here are some introduction:
 No personal computer exists in a vacuum. As elegantly designed as Macs are, a connected world means that their popularity attracts the attention of malware writers and virus engineers. Not only can malware and other threats attack the Mac OS X platform directly, but Macs can also serve as a carrier of Windows or Linux-based threats. Network shares, email and removable media like USB keys are easy ways easy ways for multiplatform malware to spread under the radar.

 The Macâ€™s meteoric rise in popularity makes the Mac OS X platform more likely to be a target for cybercriminals looking to profit from the perception that Macs are invulnerable to from viruses, worms, trojans and other threats. ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4 for Mac OS X brings to the Mac world protection that Windows users have trusted in and depended on: the smart proactive detection and small footprint of our ThreatSenseÂ® technology. ESET NOD32 Antivirus 4 will keep you and your network safe from emerging Mac OS X and cross-platform threats without system slowdowns. Advanced heuristic technology recognizes and nullifies novel threats while other AV solutions are still waiting hours or days for signature updates.
