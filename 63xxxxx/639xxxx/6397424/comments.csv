,DarthExile,2011-05-16T16:01Z,now why would you bother uploading flv and mp4 for wrestling torrents why ??? no one wants to watch this on the pc instead we stream and if your gonna waste a dvd you like to put alot of trash on it and this takes a lot longer for the dvd to burn this is why mp4 flv are fucking worthless ok especially for wrestling torrents 
,Syke123,2011-05-16T18:10Z,@darthpussy^^ didnt you say you have an suckbox 360 . anyway why dont you become an uploader instead of downloading torrents and every single time someone uploads a wrestling torrent i see your worthless and invalid points so if you wanna have a cup of shut the fuck up go for it.
