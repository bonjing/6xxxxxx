This is the clean edit of "The Lazy Song" by Bruno Mars.

Made with Audacity and a track of the song, it kinda sucks, but not much. 

It censors out (freaking, sex, etc) decently. When I did the vocal remover on Audacity it still left an echo of the word, so I tried to mask that the best I could.

No virus, 100% clean.


I do not own this song, but this song if (of course) edited for quick torrent use.



PM me if you have any questions.
