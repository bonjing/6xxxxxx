Absolutely beautiful overall, powerful when needed, delicate when appropriate and always sensitive to what, I believe, were Ravel's intentions. But these are also fresh interpretations that I felt that I was listening to for the first time, especially the "Pavan." I have almost all of her Bach recordings and I am in the process of wearing them out! The Ravel is on that same level. Very highly recommended, even if you don't care for Ravel. (review: amazon.com)
