EliteXpÂ® Autorun Fix 2.8.30 (Re-Fixed)

This small utility is very useful in the prevention of your system for the viruses that remove via removable drives. This utility can automatically detect and delete those viruses. Also, it has some registry tweaks that are used to recover your system from damages done by the viruses. As well, there is Startup Manager and Task Manager which will be useful in removing those viruses from the system.

Also, Now........ Startup Folder Enumeration N' partial dependencies removed.....Now, Startup Manager works fine under worst conditions too.. Fixed as much as I have seen errors..

Now, this utility runs perfectly in Windows 7 too...Check it out...If any problems, please mail..I couldn't run it in Windows Vista...Please Mail Me

You can send me the comments from within the tool and also can be used to immune the drives from AUTORUN.INF type viruses.
