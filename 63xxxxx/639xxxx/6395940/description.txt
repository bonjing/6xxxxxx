      5. Focusing Your Attention
      The basis of improving your memory: focusing your attention. Here, explore a range of topics, including the physiological effects of attention on your brain; the dangers of inattention; the benefits of enhanced attention; multitasking; exercises to improve your sustained attention, divided attention, and processing speed; and much more.

      6. Enhancing Your Memory
      In the first of three lectures devoted to memory, Dr. Restak proves just how essential memory is to your brain's optimal functioning. After surveying the details of memory and its roots in the hippocampus, learn ways to sharpen your sense memory and augment both your short-term and long-term general memory.

      7. Exercising Your Working Memory
      Focus now on working memoryâ€”the most important memory process of all and one that involves manipulating stored information. After an overview of the topic, dive into a series of engaging exercises that use your creativity, your powers of observation, and your heightened awareness to enhance and improve your working memory.

      8. Putting Your Senses to Work
      Imaginative memory techniquesâ€”such as mnemonic devices and personal associationsâ€”have been used to improve memory for over 1,000 years. Try your hand at some of them right here, including "chunking" numbers to aid in number recall, creating a vivid story to memorize words, drawing free-form designs, and playing mental chess.

      9. Enlisting Your Emotional Memory
      Turn now to an aspect of memory we don't usually consider when thinking about the subject: emotional memory. How did scientists uncover this specific aspect of memory? How does it actually work? And what kinds of playful exercises can you perform to help you relive the emotional experience of your past?

      10. Practicing for Peak Performance
      Exceptional performers aren't born with "superior brains." Rather, anyoneâ€”thanks to brain plasticityâ€”can achieve high performance levels in an area of interest through deliberate practice. Focus here on two aspects of deliberate practice: remaining fully aware of what you're doing, and concentrating on the most difficult aspects of your performance.

      11. Taking Advantage of Technology
      Take a closer look at the impact of modern technology on how our brains function. You'll explore the positive and negative effects of electronic journals, personal computers, and moreâ€”with a lengthy discussion on the impact of one of today's most powerful and controversial influences on brain function: video games.

      12. Building Your Cognitive Reserve
      Professor Restak concludes his course with ways to immediately start optimizing your brain fitness. These include trying new and unexpected things, learning in an informal and self-directed manner, keeping things in perspective, opting to prioritize instead of multitask, developing an appreciation for art and music, andâ€”surprisinglyâ€”preparing home-cooked meals.
