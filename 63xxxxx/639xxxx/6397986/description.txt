Featuring behind-the-scenes photos, outtakes, silliness, and a few words from myself on inked girls, flash brackets, what flashes I use and why, the "Speaker Vest", "Intent", procrastination, following orders, being a pervert, my worst shoot ever, "Danger Girl!", the word "Vulgar", "It's not the camera, asshole", coffee, music videos, and comic books, and a foreword by my good friend Joe Melone Jr."
