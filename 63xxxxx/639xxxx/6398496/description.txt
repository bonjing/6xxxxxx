Dancing in the Dark (1986)

Dancing in the Dark is a 1986 Canadian drama film. It is directed and written by Leon Marr based on a novel by Joan Barfoot.

The story begins in the present as unfolds along with scenes from the past about Edna, a woman in a hospital who each day writes down her memories. Edna cannot (or will not) talk to her doctor, and nurses have to take care of her basic needs. Edna's hospital surroundings give way to the bright colours of her home life as her memories surface while she writes. She is a devoted housewife, an excellent cook, and in love with her husband Harry (Munro) who often compliments her on her cooking, fills their conversations with his life at work, and they seem quite normal if perhaps a little boring. But then something happens that will change Edna's attitude toward herself, resulting in a hospital stay, and her stubborn unwillingness to talk.
