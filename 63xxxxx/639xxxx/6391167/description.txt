Harikrishnans movie revolves around Harikrishnan (Mammootty and Mohanlal) who are one of the most famous lawyer duo in India. To avoid confusion one is called as Hari (Mammooty) and the other as Krishnan (Mohanlal). They are known to take lakhs for single sittings. They head the oragnisation called Harikrishnan Associates, which consists of around 300 lawyers, all being their juniors.

Harikrishnans are known to take only the most important cases, while others are handled by their juniors. They get engaged in a murder case of Guptan (Rajiv Menon) who was allegedly killed by Gabriel. Gabriel is a friend of their sister ammalu (Shamili) and Harikrishnans become the defense lawyers upon her request. Harikrishnans begin investigation and come across Mira (Juhi Chawla), a friend of Guptan. Both of them fall in love with her. 

After some trouble over the matter, they rediscover their friendship and get involved in the case again. They discover that Guptan actually died due to poisoning by his relatives who were doctors. At the end Mira decides to go for a random method of choosing her lover as she liked both Harikrishnans equally. Two different climaxes of the film show either of Harikrishnans winning the toss for being Mira's friend; the losing person presumably becoming Mira's lover.
