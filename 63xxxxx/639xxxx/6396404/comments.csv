,Jester132,2011-06-02T23:13Z,"Hello all.  Just wanted to say that this works GREAT, BUT on my system (win 7 ult. x64 with WMP12) ""morphyre"" was not selectable as a visulization WHILE MUSIC WAS RUNNING.  Ran WMP from quicklaunch (i.e. not playing ANYTHING) and I could select it and then it showed up., BUT, WHILE music is playing, it DOES NOT appear.  but it works, and looks GREAT"
