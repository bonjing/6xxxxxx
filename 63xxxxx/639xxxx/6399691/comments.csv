,Stargazing,2011-05-24T17:07Z,"Just watched a Cage movie. Something about someone escaping hell so on, so on. And I have a feeling that this movie will be just what I need to push me over the edge. 
If it suprises me in a good way IÂ´ll be back with Audio/Video ratings. "

,igadoter,2011-05-25T13:52Z,"Stop you mfucker  complaining. No one interested in your opinion about the movie. It's all free. Did you forget that? Score A/V that's enough.  Or shut up your mouth.

Great thanks extremezone for the upload. You're really the big one. "
,ashen77,2011-05-25T22:08Z,hey igadoter - what have i told you about not taking your meds?
,Toke420,2011-05-27T02:42Z,"@igadoter

you sir, are a dickhead. the video is from extremezone so you would have to be retarded for expecting anything other than 10/10 for the A/V. the only reason people are reading the comments is for the reviews of the movie, dumbass"
,Kanyu88,2011-05-27T03:06Z,"I know I'm gonna get attacked here, only post about video quality, blah, blah...

But...

What is it with this movie, Drive Angry & The Debt Collector? Are the Christians trying to take over tinseltown? All are cheesy to the extreme, but had the potential to be something big... WTF?"
,stigmashocks,2011-05-27T09:09Z,I can't believe I survived until the end of the movie. Thanks extremezone..
,jager963,2011-05-28T04:24Z,"@igadoter lighten up dude were just messin with the movie makers/so called actors not the uploader. Everyone knows the world is a better place with extremezone in it. Your arument is that we cant complain about this movie cause its free. so if i come round your house and fuck you in the ass you wont mind as long as i dont charge you? 
well ok dude get the vasaline out and i will call a cab. "
,myryiah61,2011-06-07T06:20Z,"extremezone i don't care about the movie i just want to thank u 4 making movies available to me, i can't afford to go to the movies so i enjoy coming here and finding u and a couple of others for making a great evening 4 me. u all make it worthwhile. thanx a million."
