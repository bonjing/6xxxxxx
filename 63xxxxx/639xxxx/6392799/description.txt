The latest release of dark electro / industrial squad H.Exe. This is the first full-length album in the rapid career of this talented band and certainly one that is going to be an important milestone in their quest for world domination. H.Exe has been present on the Dark Independent scene for just around a year or so, but they are quickly gathering momentum and recognition. 

Killing Monsters follows band's proven recipe for destruction and good club-oriented music: crushing beats, catchy melodies and vocals spanning across all stages of insanity. The production layer is excellent and has all the bells and whistles one would expect from modern dark electronic music. 

The release is consistently aggressive, and however the tempo is varied, there are no songs that would let you catch your breath on the dancefloor â€“ and this is precisely what this music was created for. At least a couple of songs have a potential to become club hits in our scene.
