"Hot Cocoa Bang Bang"

Cleveland takes the entire family to a comic 
convention in an attempt to sell his comic book, 
"Waderman." While there, Donna is horrified to 
find out that Robert Rodriguez (guest-voicing as 
himself) is screening a Blaxploitation film that 
she starred in when she was younger, and 
Cleveland Jr., tired of Comic-Con being a 
playground for Hollywood to peddle their projects, 
gathers a band of geeks together to take the Con 
back to its true origins.

Enjoy :)
