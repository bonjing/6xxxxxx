,Delron41,2011-05-15T18:03Z,Is this PS3 friendly?
,nittany,2011-05-15T23:03Z,"@Delron

Don't play movies through your console, just go buy a $60-$80 WD TV Live off eBay and you'll never have to worry if the movie will play right on your PS3 again.  I have a WD TV Live and it has played back 99% of everything I've downloaded off here.

If you have no idea what a WD TV Live is, just go to Amazon and type it in and read all the reviews.  They also have a Plus version that supports Netflix and a ""Hub"" version that has a built in internal hard drive and a better GUI and shit."
,LupinII2,2011-05-16T04:52Z,"Or better yet, instead of paying $60-150 for a box that blinks, you can just use tversity to stream to your PS3. You'll save $60-150 by going with Tversity cuz its FREE. PS3 even comes with Netflix if you have the special INTERNET EDITION! Sorry Nittany, we PS3 users dont need your expensive blinky box just to stream content and watch Netflix, we got that covered."
,bradass,2011-05-17T15:48Z,"so to save $60-$150 you have to spend $300+ for ps3?  wtf.  anyone hear of using a blu-ray player you already have? so no expensive blinky box, or even more expensive game controller remote.  only took 15 minutes to have it on a dvdr and plays in any blu-ray player.  duh, Winning"
,LupinII2,2011-05-18T22:32Z,"@bradass

since Nittany was trying to tell a PS3 owner to buy something else, I was trying to tell him that we have no need for his blinky box because we can easily stream out media with tversity. I wasnt saying ""Go out and buy a PS3 so you can stream media."", I was simply saying dont buy a stupid box you dont need when you can just used tversity."

,SolaceG,2011-05-22T14:07Z,"^ true, but the WD HDTV live does work better though. "

Download Azurus! (free + you can download Torrents whit it )
google how to use it and thats it!"
,Bardyman,2011-06-19T12:35Z,"Why all the arguments? Buy an eight dollar VGA to HDMI and watch it straight off the computer on your glorious HDTV.

That's what I do, and it works one hundred percent of the time. No DVD/BluRay/PS3/Xbox/WD/Tversity/Cable/Satellite needed. Just the eight dollar cord. =)
