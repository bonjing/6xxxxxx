Since forming in 1997, the Appleseed Cast has morphed from one of the definitive bands of the emo era into a group that has continued to open up the possibilities of rock music. Whether cloaked in delicate melodies, atmospherics and instrumental experimentation, or stripped down to the bands spin on the basics of rock n roll, with each new recording fans around the world have learned to expect the unexpected. Middle States seems an appropriate title for the bands latest release. It could be read as signifying the bands home town of Lawrence, Kansas (a â€œmiddleâ€ state if there ever was one), the mini-lps place in the trajectory of the bands career, a piece that alludes to its progress between its gripping seventh album, Sagargatha (2009) and its already eagerly-anticipated eighth record (due out on Graveface in early 2012). Or, as the title track suggests, the middle stages and transitional periods of life. Heard through the lush, brightly textured harmonies led by singer and co-founder Chris Crisci, change is a pretty alright thing. For Middle States, The Appleseed Cast sequestered itself in its own recording â€œcompound,â€ having fallen in love with the freedom of crafting records without the time and budget constraints of a traditional studio during home sessions for Sagarmatha. The relaxed pace and familiar setting has served the band well. Opening Middle States is cinematic rocker â€œEnd Frigid Constellations,â€ a song that evokes so many feelings and imagery it seems epic despite its relative shortness. The finale, â€œThree Rivers,â€ contains many of the mini-lps most majestic moments and showcasing the bands live prowess and tight musicianship. The song marks the bandÊ¼s first completely improvised release, but with any luck it wont be the last. Middle States gives insight into a band that is constantly reinventing itself and growing stronger with each passing year. If the min-lp is a teaser of things yet to come, we can only say its working brilliantly.
