Here we have the Official Playstation Firmware Update v3.61. 

I decided to create this a torrent because i've heard people are having trouble downloading from the links that are posted on the official Playstation website.

To update your ps3 using this file you need a USB stick that can hold a 177MB file.

1. Put the PS3 folder that you've just downloaded onto your USB
2. System Update > Via Storage Media
3. Install away and now wait for PSN to be turned back online!

Happy Days!
