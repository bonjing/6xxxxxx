                      PLOT                       
                                               
                                                       
     

        Manchester United Football Club started life as Newton  Heath,
        a team founded  by workers from  the Lancashire and  Yorkshire
        Railway in 1878. This is where this DVD starts, recounting the
        history of  Manchester United.  Honours soon  followed and the
        first of seven First Division titles was won in 1908. With  an
        FA Cup win  the following year,  and another league  title two
        years  later,  Manchester  United  were  firmly   establishing
        themselves as a force in English football.

        The history continues: Old Trafford was bombed during the  war
        and we  witness the  painful rebuilding  process before moving
        into  an  era   of  great  success   and  tragedy  under   the
        inspirational management of Sir  Matt Busby. He was  the first
        manager to lead an English club into Europe before the  Munich
        plane  crash  prematurely  robbed  football  of  his brilliant
        'Busby Babes'.  But Busby  and 'United  were not  to let  this
        tragedy defeat  them as  Busby created  another brilliant team
        starring Charlton, Best and Law  that was to shine in  England
        and go on to win the European Cup.

        In the years  after Busby's resignation,  FA Cups followed  at
        regular  intervals but  the League  Championship continued  to
        elude United  until Sir  Alex Ferguson  built the  team of the
        nineties that  have gone  on to  win seven  premiership titles
        over the last  ten years. Built  around home-grown talent  and
        inspirational signings such as Eric Cantona, Manchester United
        moved into an  era of unrivalled  success which culminated  in
        the remarkable treble of 1999. But Manchester United's history
        does not  stop there.  Further championships  followed in both
        2000 and 2001 and this  DVD finishes at a time  when Ferguson,
        through the  signings of  Ruud van  Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastian
        Veron and  Rio Ferdinand  is building  another team  worthy of
        success at home and in Europe.
