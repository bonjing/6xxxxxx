,spiritcreature,2011-05-14T22:26Z,Thanks! Good upload.

,fillinthisspace,2011-05-18T03:38Z,"Well I've got to say.... it's an absolute joy to find an uploader who isn't stuck in some archaic 350mb per episode mindset. Even though Doctor Who has become totally gay (no fault of Matt Smith) I must say thank you for the torrent.

One question... without knowing what cropping was necessary or how the uploader crops and resizes etc... wouldn't 704x400 be closer to the original 16:9 aspect ratio?"
