              WinRAR - What's new in the latest version


  Version 4.01 beta 1

  1. Added support for file sizes stored in binary format in TAR archives.
     Some TAR archives use the binary size format instead of octal
     for files larger than 8 GB.
  
  2. Bugs fixed:

     a) "Repair" command failed to properly reconstruct structure
        of RAR archives, which contained at least one file with packed
        size exceeding 4 GB.

        This bug did not affect the recovery record based repair.
        It happened only if recovery record was not found and WinRAR
        performed reconstruction of archive structure;

     b) even if "Do not extract paths" option in "Advanced" part of
        extraction dialog was set as the default, WinRAR still unpacked
        file paths if called from Explorer context menu;

     c) after entering a wrong password for encrypted ZIP archive,
        sometimes WinRAR ignored subsequent attempts to enter a valid
        password;

     d) "Wizard" command did not allow to create self-extracting 
        and multivolume archives, when compressing a single folder
        or a file without extension;

     e) "Import settings from file" command did not restore multiline
        comments in WinRAR compression profiles;

     f) when converting RAR volumes having name1.name2.part#.rar name format,
        "Convert archives" command erroneously removed ".name2" name part.
        So resulting archive had name1.rar file name instead of expected
        name1.name2.rar;

     g) RAR could crash when creating a new archive with -agNNN switch
        if archive number in generated name was 110 or larger.
