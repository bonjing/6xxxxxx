Any Time Now (TV series)

Anytime Now was an Irish contemporary six-part drama series, set against the backdrop of the newly thriving and cosmopolitan Dublin, about the lives, loves, and libidos of three life-long friends. Nora Moggin (played by Angelina Ball), Kate O'Dowd (played by Zara Turner) and Stevie McCutcheon (played by Susan Lynch) live in Dublin. They have a combined age of 99. Between them they have slept with 47 men, broken 11 hearts, drunk approximately 5000 pints, bought one house, buried two parents, failed one marriage and produced one baby. They've known each other long enough to believe that their friendship, at least, is invincible"
