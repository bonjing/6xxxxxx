BOOK INFO:

Kwame Nkrumah remains a towering figure in African history. Inspired by Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s non-violent campaign of civil disobedience, he led what is now the nation of Ghana to independence in 1957. Nkrumah made Ghana a beacon of hope for not only Ghanaians but also people of African descent throughout the world. Perhaps no other African leader of the 1950s and 1960s personified the dreams, principles, and aspirations of this era. This thoroughgoing analysis of Nkrumahâ€™s political, social, and economic thought centers on his own writings, and reexamines his life and thought by focusing on the political discourses and controversies surrounding him.
