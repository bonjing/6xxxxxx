                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Gordon's Great Escape sees Gordon traveling to India to learn more about      
 Indian cuisine. The second series saw him travelling to South East Asia.      
                                                                               
 Chef Gordon Ramsay continues his culinary journey in Vietnam, where he 
 samples foods including still-beating snake heart, barbecued duck and  
 basket-caught squid. He also visits a snake restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City,
 tries to obtain a secret recipe in Hanoi, and learns how to prepare rice 
 cakes in Mai Chau, before hosting a pork dinner for some of the country's 
 food connoisseurs
