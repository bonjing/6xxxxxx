,pcsjith,2011-06-03T04:04Z,Hi thank u for uploading...can u pls explain the installation  and 'copying over' the crack files in a little greater detail. thanks in advance.
,gammatertiary,2011-06-10T02:47Z,"Run the large exe file to install the package.  Then copy the files from the 'crack' folder into the Vector installation folder, overwriting the originals.  Do this before running the application."
,james.winchester,2011-07-20T13:10Z,"Cannot do many important functions, such as take a photo and save altered files, being only able to do this with the start up commercial vectors supplied with the program. ""You cannot save a document in the demonstration version"". I have pasted the cracked files into C/  Program Files/ Vector NTI advance. Help?"
,gammatertiary,2011-07-22T10:43Z,"Are you sure you have overwritten the originals and not, for example, pasted a shortcut to the cracked files?  

It would have been prudent to have moved the originals to a backup folder first, in case you ever needed them in future.  Then you could be sure about copying the cracks."
,james.winchester,2011-07-23T09:21Z,"Found the solution (not a shortcut problem- originals were properly overwritten). For others with a similar problem: when in Vector NTI, go to HELP then LICENSE MANAGER. Under the applications tab, change each of the apps from Demo Mode to Dynamic License. All is then solved, no features blocked. 

Very useful torrent by the way. Cheers gammatertiary!"
,nwoodwar,2011-08-16T01:55Z,Thanks so much for the upload!  I did this once before on my old computer but lost the installation/crack folder.  So I should download version 11 from invitrogen then copy this stuff over?  Just making sure...
,ggyanwali,2011-11-23T00:28Z,Thank you very much but i got a question. Can we upgrade or else with this crrack version? or we shouldn't so that the server of invitrogen invalidate this copy?
,ggyanwali,2011-12-03T15:21Z,"When I tried to create a new plasmid molecule in the program it said 'the feature is not available in demo mode"". i've overwritten the original files with crack files and in license manager i've selected dynamic license mode. somebody help please!!!"
