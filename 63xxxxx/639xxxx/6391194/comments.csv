[V],joshua13,2011-05-14T14:00Z,"an't fix w/o deleting the torrent & re-upping which will screw it up for other people who have it from other sites.

go get the torrent at -h-3-3-t- or  -d-e-m-o-n-o-i-d-

the no input file thing is  a pirate bay problem they have had for a while now that seems to hit random torrents.   tpb is the biggest but has the crappiest server software!"
