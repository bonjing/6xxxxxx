Meet The HTC Incredible...

It\'s A stunning theme, every element of it has been skinned or created custom to give an authentic look and feel to it. The homescreen banner includes the trademark huge clock, as well as a weather slot, and the icon set matches perfectly. The bottom bar launches Contacts and Compose, and the homescreen allows for 6 user-defined icons. Two menus are integrated into the homescreen, one providing access to utility functions such as the Clock, Manage Connections, etc, and the other accessing the hidden Today screens. Hotkeys add another touch of function, making this a highly useful theme, while maintaining a high level of visual appeal.

Thank\'s please comment and ill keep em coming..
