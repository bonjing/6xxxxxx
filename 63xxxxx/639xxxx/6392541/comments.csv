,brian_15,2011-05-25T20:53Z,"Hey sry i didnt reply sooner but if you still havnt got it to work this is an easy way how.. 

) ok well plug your torch in your computer, 
) Then open folder to view files.. if you have an ""SD"" memory card you can use it but it doesnt matter if you use a memory card or not you just need to open the folder to view files.
) Then drag the folder called ""Htc Incredible"" in the WinRAR.. 
) Now you can disconnect your Torch and go to ""Applications"" on your phone,
)then""Files"" it will say ""All Files"" and ""File Folders"" Open ""File Folder"
,brian_15,2011-05-25T21:03Z,") Then it will say either ""Media Card"" Or ""Device""
) Choose The one you saved the file to and open..
) Now open the ""Htc Incredible"" file on your blackberry and look for the ""jad."" file (it's usually the smalles file in the folder)

) now it wil prompt you to download it.. 
) download then install and injoy (:  "
