Royal Society of Chemistry | 2010-03-01 | ISBN: 1849730202 | 326 pages | PDF

This book covers the fundamentals of solar energy, photovoltaic (PV), or photovoltaic thermal (PV/T) technologies, energy security, climate change and carbon trading. The book starts with an introduction to solar radiation, its propagation through the atmosphere and concepts of greenhouse gases. It then moves on to cover the history of solar cells and PV modules before focusing on the design and application of photovoltaic modules for electricity and heat production. The economics, cost effectiveness and sustainability of photovoltaic technologies are also discussed.
