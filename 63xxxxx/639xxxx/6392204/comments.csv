,bigbandbilly,2011-05-14T16:38Z,Hi I just wanted to explain further. For some reason when I pick 3or 4 or even just one out of your show packs .It takes all day and night even days sometimes all the while uploading almost as much as if I was down loading full bandwidth.I am not and will not complain to you twenty forty. I only ask do you know why this is the case with me. How ever when I DL a single show I get  much faster speed. Thanks for any advice on this . Billy out
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T16:41Z,"TV packs only - today is something that needs to be done this way. There is no difference in choosing and downloading single file from any pack, majority of people have been doing just that."
,bdlnaredi,2011-05-14T17:21Z,"thnx 20-40 for this

[V],twentyforty,2011-05-14T17:33Z,"@bigbandbilly: It is a combination of well known low (read miserable) efficiency of all torrent clients (programs) in case of so called ""partial downloads"" and ""modern times"", namely, by nature modern lines are asymmetrical (1000 kB/s download speed but only 50 kB/s upload) what practically diminishes EXCHANGE of bytes already present in ""swarm"" - feature on torrents rely on. 

Nowadays 98% of people in swarm are pure leechers - they suck others dry and give shit to others. When you place request to those swarm members - and you can place limited number of such requests in given time, you get zero, and you waste your request asking hard-fisting bastards.

Now - myself, my program, can establish also limited number of connections - and we (our programs) practically could never ""meet"" each other, like you shouting ""Gimme me, gimme me"" in middle of some crowd of local punks and hooligans which always find the way to fuck others up, get what they want and - run away.

Then - they practically make all what has been given to them to dissapear, forever - and seeders, who are there just to ""replenish"" network losses - must somehow give bytes taken away.
It cannot work better.

I cannot pay for more upload slots - and I cannot with just two slots I have for TV shows do nothing more - or more convenient for downloaders. I simply can't. Sorry."

[V],matimike,2011-05-15T00:11Z,a/v 10 thanks
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-15T07:45Z,Thanks.
,LJE111,2011-05-15T07:46Z,I always seed - but the last couple of weeks utorrent is constantly giving me red x's (error code) as soon as it completes dl and tries to seed. It's frustrating as I know folks want faster dl's and I can't seem to get in a seeding swarm.
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-15T11:16Z,"@LJE111: Options>Preferences>Queueing>Queue settings:
set Maximum number of active torrents (download or upload) to 98 - this number limits the number of torrents you have active at a time
and below, Maximum number of active downloads at 28
Options>Preferences>Bandwidth: 
set Global maximum number of active connections on 128, Maximum number of connected peers per torrent to 56 and Number of upload slots per torrent to 12.
UN-tick ""Use additional slots if..."".


This are the settings I have. Experiment a little, but not too much."
