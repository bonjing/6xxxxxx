"I am disillusioned enough to know that no man's opinion on any subject
is worth a damn unless backed up with enough genuine information to
make him really know what he's talking about." - HP Lovecraft

"When you do not know what you are doing 
and what you are doing is the best - that is inspiration." - R Bresson
 
Requests (or re-seed requests) should be posted in [COMMENTS] section of 
newest torrents.
Re-seed request should contain exact time and time-zone you're in.
Re-seed time-window is 1 (maybe 2) hours because server-time is expensive
and seeding speed is above 1 Gbps. If you have slow connection, 
just forget about old, dead torrents.
Re-seed chances are good for single torrents within the week 
of original day of upping.
Chances for re-seed of torrents older than week are slim to none.
"Out of schedule" shows or pilot-episodes may get uploaded randomly, 
if circumstances allow (i.e. free slots open up).

Do NOT bother requesting easily available titles. If I haven't encoded something new and current - I have my reasons for that.

Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.

Do NOT request inclusion of TV shows in my schedule; that's my call. The removal of some show depends on many factors, however, be sure that shows would be dropped if I spot lack of interest, hungry hard-fisting crowd or too high a number of Hit and Runs. These decisions are my own.
