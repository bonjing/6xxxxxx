         She has been referred to as the King Tut of China. Fu Hao,    
         the legendary warrior queen of China's first dynasty, was     
         buried with treasures of bronze, jade and ivory, more than    
         a hundred weapons and the remains of sacrificed humans. For   
         years archeologists could only speculate about the people     
         of the Shang dynasty, who were known for their excessive      
          drinking and passion for human sacrifice - until now.
