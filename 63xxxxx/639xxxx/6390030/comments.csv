1 believe in you, but I think I've shared with me at least 15 gigabytes so far. 
But hang in there it will work but unfortunately does not alll this with sharing so seriously. 
Only I can so I do not care about the rest. I never write to you to be there but I assume that you just do it. 
But unfortunately it's not that I'm going with all I know, so just IP ban if I know if they are static or dynamic IP."
