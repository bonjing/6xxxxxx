Armed and Dangerous is a third-person shooter action game, the camera hovering behind Roman, the player character, at all times. The game is played mostly on foot, with most levels incorporating usable gun emplacements, although there are some base defense levels where the player is inside a movable gun turret mounted on rails on top of a defensive wall; these levels are played in first-person.

Playable weaponry and equipment in Armed and Dangerous is a mix of shooter staples, including bolt-action and sniper rifles, submachine guns and rocket launchers, but also more unusual fare like the 'Land Shark Gun', which fires into the ground a rapidly-maturing infant Land Shark, a creature that 'swims' through the earth, seeking out and devouring enemies. Other unusual devices include a miniature black hole, a gas grenade that turns enemies against each other and a device that temporarily reverses gravity, causing enemies to 'fall' into the sky and Literally turns the World Upside Down, before the device shuts down, returning gravity to normal and returning affected enemies to earth, the fall killing them. Apart from weaponry, some of the later levels equip the player with a jet pack, allowing flight over moderate distances.
