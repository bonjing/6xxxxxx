,heyman1981,2011-05-18T11:46Z,^ no lol
,baloo2.1,2011-05-18T12:28Z,"1. I got full audio from the very first frame. If you haven't I suggest switching codecs or even media player.

2. The sound was a wee bit out of sync and it seems to be done deliberately. Fortunately there's an easy fix in Media Player Classic: from the meny select Play > Audio > Options > Audio switcher. You might find that the sync is preset 150 ms off. Set it to 0 and you should be fine.

If the sound is in sync, you probably haven't enabled Audio Time Shift at all, and then you don't have to worry about #2 above. :)

All in all, excellent quality. Many thanks to froggie100 for sharing!"

A - Ok for R5. No problem hearing the dialog or over the top annoying distortion.

M - I kind of enjoyed it. Thought it would be better though. Ironically, as the movie is about extreme intelligence, the plot goes full retard at several places. It felt like the people who wrote this movie didn't do ANY research before hand.
Maybe they should have been bothered with at least 5min of googeling. "

Each and every sub I try is the same one, where it seems like the movie was first translated to another language and then translated BACK to English, so the subtitles basically say the same thing that the actor says, but in other words... Besides that, it often misses words like ""today was the day I gonna kick it's ass"" WAS motherfuckers, WAS gonna kick it's ass!

So did any of you guys find proper English subs yet? I downloaded the movie ages ago and am waiting and waiting until the day someone provides proper English subs. GODDAMNIT!!"

DVDs should be made to R.I.P and thanked for providing years worth of enjoyable entertainment..

Most probably my comment might get removed.....I think it's important for people to the world of MKV prints in real small sizes with great qualities!! 

BTW...there are so many small size rippers...I don't understand why people still prefer these bulky file which are of DVD quality (infact less when ripped)"
