DEREK ST. HOLMES had worked as an integral part of TED NUGENT's band during the mid 70s sharing lead vocal duties with the self-styled Motor City Madman on many of his top selling albums of the period. Holmes, no doubt craving greater recognition, opted out for a solo career, teaming up with TED NUGENT bassist Rob Grange and ex MONTROSE drummer Denny Carmassi to create ST. PARADISE. A band that sounded not disimilar to what St. Holmes had been creating with TED NUGENT, if perhaps a little more melodic and lyrically lighter.

This video was recorded live on Jul 21, 1979 at the Oakland Coliseum Stadium (Oakland, CA) for Bill Grahams Day On The Green #3 which also included: Ted Nugent, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Frank Marino & Mahogany Rush, St.Paradise. Also called "The Monsters Of Rock" show.

The video is short and the audio is not that great. The worst of all the shows recorded that day. Unfortunately, this is probably of some of the only concert footage of this great band.

The Band:

Derek St. Holmes â€“ Guitar, vocals
John Corey - Rhythm guitar
Rob Grange â€“ bass
Denny Carmassi â€“ drums

Set List:

Tighten The Knot
Live iT uP (Incomplete)
