                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Featuring a man who stabbed himself in the leg after using a carving knife as a
 microphone during an impromptu karaoke performance, and a woman who nearly lost
 her fingers in an accident involving a printing machine. Plus, a plumber who had
 a severe reaction to a wasp sting, and a toddler who got a staple stuck in her
 gum. Narrated by Sheridan Smith.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
