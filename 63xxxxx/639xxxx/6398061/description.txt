Established in 1995 Renegade Hardware has undoubtedly cemented
itself as one of the most pioneering drum & bass labels in the
world, becoming a proven breeding ground for some of the biggest
names in the scene. To celebrate this milestone, Hardware XV has
been compiled. This release features some of the highlights from 
15 years of releasing groundbreaking music. With a tracklisting
reading like a who's who of drum & bass including cuts from the 
original pioneers such as Future Forces, Dillinja, Optical &
Fierce, Konflict & Future Cut to the biggest names in modern drum 
and bass: Pendulum, Noisia, Spor, Chase & Status & Friction.

Not just a collection of obvious classics (although there are
many) this album is a showcase of iconic artists and examples of
their craft that have helped shape and develop the label into
what you recognise today. A simply essential collection of music.
The definitive Hardware album!
