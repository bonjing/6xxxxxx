,mizhop,2011-05-15T00:40Z,Will not play in any player.  Very disappointing.  I expected more from SafCuk than this... =(
,mizhop,2011-05-15T00:43Z,"Terribly sorry, strike that last statement.  Last resort player (Windows) is where it finally worked.  My apologies, SafCuk!  NOT Fake, it does play."
,oldbreadbutt,2011-05-15T06:17Z,"seems to be working fine for me. which is kinda surprising given the track record of imerse's releases. anyway, thanks SAFCukO09."

,sonofdog,2011-05-20T12:30Z,Evereytime I play this my vlc shits itself and the cpu goes off the board. I then have to go to task manager to end the process which is running in the nineties freezing/slowing everything to a snail. It does play in WMP though.
