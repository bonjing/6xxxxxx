Also I have some probs with the server - will be solved in a few hours, so please be patient ;)!"

,throwthisaway,2011-08-05T07:22Z,This would be better without all the Kablam shit thrown in.  6 Minutes of Kablam commercials added into the actual movie files is gross.
,sysop1101,2011-08-16T05:23Z,"Don't waste your time. There are commercials in every video file. 
If I wanted commercials I would just watch it on tv!"
,grei_eba,2011-10-10T17:56Z,"dont download this one, the little mother fucker messed up the episodes. you suck, dude."
[V],manOtor,2011-10-11T20:06Z,"FYI:

It is only the first episode, that I recoded to integrate some teaser/trailer stuff which I have fun to create. I don't care whether anyone likes it or hates it. If the latter is the case with you, get your shit elsewhere!

The rest of the episodes is fine. They're the original scene releases!

Sometimes checking the whole torrent (or at least more than the first file) helps to not look like an idiot, when you are commenting ;)!
BTW:
Seeders:  709 "
