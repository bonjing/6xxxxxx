,xFNAxZaLaG,2011-05-16T04:48Z,says no fakes and no rars...but theres 31 files...and has rars
,arnshead,2011-05-16T04:54Z,Looks good.  Thanks!
,Jeearr,2011-05-16T05:05Z,It's good! Just use winrar to extract them all into the same folder.
,Pfeiftron,2011-05-16T05:10Z,This has got to be a fake right? Uploaded before finished on the East coast. has anyone dl'd and can confirm?
,Nephilim83,2011-05-16T05:17Z,"How's it gonna say ""no fakes and NO RARS"" when this is clearly a bunch of rars?  "
,Nephilim83,2011-05-16T05:19Z,EZTV's copy is up now:  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6395938/Game_of_Thrones_S01E05_The_Wolf_and_the_Lion_HDTV_XviD-FQM_%5Beztv  And unlike this bullshit it really does have NO RARs! lol
,merlinone,2011-05-16T05:58Z,Nephilim83 you are the man!
,ohitexplodes,2011-05-16T06:16Z,this is going a lot faster than the eztv. is it real?
,Mainers,2011-05-16T06:31Z,"Dumb ass comments from kids that know fuck all, the info states that its a rar file,sort off, or do you just no understandy englishy, mugs ? This uploader does not upload fakes, make sure you know what your talking about before you comment."
,Funsom,2011-05-16T10:51Z,Why the hell do all these kids dislike rars so much? Don't they know how to open them or something?
,Jack_Raiden,2011-05-16T11:37Z,"Hmm. These RAWR! releases gather tons of great seeders (thanks!), ratio. Verdict: Keep on fuckin' off, leechin' fools!"
,Rohan151,2011-05-16T17:15Z,"It's not that people don't know how to open rar files (though I'm sure newer people don't), it's that there's no point in having them at all nowadays. Do the people who compress potential torrents into rar files think they are actually doing people a favour, that they are reducing the size of the torrent considerably?

A video file - like this one - compressed to a rar file isn't going to reduce it's size. The same goes for other video formats, and iso's also. And yet a lot of torrents inexplicably have to be uncompressed. And then there are those torrents that have rar files within rar files! Why?

Compressed files are for those that are really big and that CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR SIZE REDUCED. You're not going to reduce video sizes, so why bother?"
,Master550,2011-05-23T01:50Z,"There is another reason why people dislike RAR's. Even though in this day and age hard drive space is cheap, it still means  uncompressing and viewing a video file takes up twice the space - 1) to keep the rar'd files and 2) to keep the video file. This means that people are more likely to delete (and hence, not fully seed, if at all) the rar'd files."
