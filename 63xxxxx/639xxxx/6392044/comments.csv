,Zerotic,2011-05-14T16:05Z,"Followed the steps, and it didn't work.

I performed a clean install of the SKIDROW game to no avail.

Perhaps it is not compatible with ""Update 2"""
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T16:12Z,"Its working with update 2 XD, See screenshots they were taken in Update 2."
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T16:14Z,"Its prob your firewall or Router.
Most problems are caused by Routers and not open ports.

I Suggest you use Tunngle, and use LAN."
,Deividas12,2011-05-14T16:59Z,"It keeps saying ""Could Not Authenticate User"" anyone know why? Or how can I fix this.  Thanks"
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T18:12Z,"Close steam, use greenluma"

,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T20:59Z,"Works and tested with UPDATE3

Dedicated server Test (Passed)
Client Test (Passed)

Both working and Displaying on LAN and INTERNET. in Freeplay server browser.."
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T21:01Z,"Just RUN update.3.exe, update, and thats it."
,NanoEntity,2011-05-14T21:04Z,"If you cant get it to work with Greenluma, try smartsteam."
,Heero916,2011-05-14T21:20Z,"Had to make an account to comment that it actually worked haha. All you gotta do is follow the instructions step by step, and if you have a current installation of Brink then you're really gonna have to uninstall then reinstall it to make it work."
,sage1210,2011-05-15T02:52Z,"i not sure about this.

it seem after update 2 for a while, some servers are locked or not let me join like it used to be.

and this happen on both smart steam or green luma.
"
,NanoEntity,2011-05-15T06:49Z,"You mean locked/private servers, thats a game feature, they just set the game to private so no one can join but them or friends if the game has password."
,501.st,2011-05-15T10:48Z,is there any chance to get me VAC Banned for this?
,Stabbath,2011-05-16T00:54Z,"Okay.  So I followed the instructions step-by-step, but when I try to join any server over internet, I get ""Cannot authenticate user"".  I am using greenluma."
,Stabbath,2011-05-16T01:57Z,"Fixed it.
-Updated to update 3
-Installed Tunngle
-Switched to smartsteam

Game is pretty good, too bad it's dead as hell."
,lorikano,2011-05-17T17:43Z,IF U HAVING CRASHES TO DESKTOP JUST RENAME THE INTRO MOVIES IN BASE/ASSETS AND THATS IT 
,add-54763,2011-05-17T21:47Z,"yeah works fine, thx guys ;)

,teenmeany1st,2011-05-21T06:45Z,"When i open brink, i see the launch splash image for like 3 seconds then it fades away, then nothing happens but when i go processes brink.exe is open but cpu is 00.
any help?"
,Jatt2613,2011-05-22T02:11Z,"@teenmeany1st - The same thing is happening to me, except the Brink process isn't even showing up. When I first installed it last night (following all the instructions listed here exactly), I could play and played for about two hours. But now today when I try to play, I get the splash for a couple of seconds, then nothing. Anyone have any ideas?"
,KidRapper,2011-05-27T14:10Z,"Now this is funny.

I installed the game yesterday, applied Update 4 & played it for some time and I noticed that the exclusive content like the Doom & Fallout packs (with weapons and clothes) were there.

However, I reinstalled the game today & added the MP patch, and things are well. (I even played a match online) but the exclusive content is missing.

Is it something to do with the MP crack guys?"
