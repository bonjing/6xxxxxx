How many uploads do ye need before getting a skull 'n crossbones affixed to thee title?

I've been sailin' around the Bay for many a year, and after downloading an Overtime from a scurvy Anonymous source is the only time my vessel has been boarded by the ISP Navy blockade.

Methinks there be a mutinous dog stowed away.

I shan't be walking the plank again on the word of a landlubber named superpunx.

Let this be a warning to thee:  Til superpunx earns his stripes on the high seas, trust not, lest ye be sent to the briny depths.
