Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World [Unabridged]
Jack Weatherford (Author), Jonathan Davis (Reader)



The name Genghis Khan often conjures the image of a relentless, bloodthirsty barbarian on horseback leading a ruthless band of nomadic warriors in the looting of the civilized world. But the surprising truth is that Genghis Khan was a visionary leader whose conquests joined backward Europe with the flourishing cultures of Asia to trigger a global awakening, an unprecedented explosion of technologies, trade, and ideas. In Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World, Jack Weatherford, the only Western scholar ever to be allowed into the Mongols' "Great Taboo" - Genghis Khan's homeland and forbidden burial site - tracks the astonishing story of Genghis Khan and his descendants, and their conquest and transformation of the world.
