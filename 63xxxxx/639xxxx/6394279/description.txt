This momentous album was conceived by NGDB manager, Bill McEuen, who wanted the country-rock band to be taken more seriously by their label. Without asking for a budget, he booked a Nashville studio and invited legendary local luminaries like Roy Acuff, Mother Maybelle Carter, Earl Scruggs, Merle Travis, and Doc Watson, as well as such revered pickers as Vassar Clements on violin and Norman Blake on dobro, to become part of this ambitious project.

The plan worked: this became the band's first gold album, although- curiously-on some tracks, such as "The End Of The World," "Cannonball Rag," "Wabash Cannonball," and others, none of the group members are credited as participating! That said, for anyone interested in great country songs by the likes of Hank Williams, A.P. Carter, Scruggs, and Travis played in authentic bluegrass style, this album can hardly be bettered.
The relaxed atmosphere resulted in some superb performances, and consistently high quality.

Moreover, the combined talents of the NGDB and their revered guests attracted sales from both old-time country aficionados, and younger country-rock fans. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band is still active-four of the members who played on this album feature on their latest (2004) offering. The band has also released two subsequent sequels-Volume 2 in 1989 and Volume 3 in 2002, featuring many of the same luminaries.
