Discover Acupuncture - the ancient Chinese practice of healing which involves painlessly and clinically inserting needles into specific parts of the body and stimulating them to release and redirect energy. Based on the proven belief that illness is based on an imbalance of the forces of yin and yang in the body, a fine needle is put into a specific point in the skin releasing yin or yang from the organs, which outs the body back into balance.
