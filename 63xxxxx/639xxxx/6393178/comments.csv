,hanzo2,2011-05-15T21:30Z,"I like RajMahal's stuff, another uploader to keep track of, like HDLite, 3Li, ReleaseLounge, sadbawang, etc.  Only the best.

This torrent one was running slow earlier and needed to be driven angry, but it seems to be picking up now :) "

V10/A9
His movies are G8 Video quality but sound is always AAC not AC3 he should change that (but that will give more MBs) if he goes that route he will be the best online. 
use Writing Application: MeGUI/Audio Coding 3
I personally prefer (Dolby AC3)
This movies it says MP4 but what i have downloaded from another site same was a .mkv!
MP4 is much better and can be played directly on HDTV with no need for a media player box.
Cheers mate and thanks again for the time and the effort "
,X3MEX,2011-05-16T13:15Z,"i agree with falconss AC3  is a better quality, there one uploader doin this  HOlyroses though the video bitrate is too high for me.. its a dream come true if RmD use AC3"
