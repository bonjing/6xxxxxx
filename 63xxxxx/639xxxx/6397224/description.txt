The full story of how America tracked down and killed the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. From the small Pakistani town of Abbottabad to the streets of New York, the programme speaks to eyewitnesses, victims of Al Qaeda's terror and military and intelligence insiders. There is also a look at why so many people were kept in the dark about the operation and whether the Pakistanis were really unaware of Bin Laden's whereabouts. As British soldiers take on the Taliban in Afghanistan and the public remain alert to potential terrorist attacks here at home, Panorama asks whether Britain can trust Pakistan to be an ally in the battle against terrorism.
