50 Powerful, Easy-to-Use Rules for Supporting Hypergrowth in Any Environment

Scalability Rules is the easy-to-use scalability primer and reference for every architect, developer, web professional, and manager. Authors Martin L. Abbott and Michael T. Fisher have helped scale more than 200 hypergrowth Internet sites through their consulting practice. Now, drawing on their unsurpassed experience, they present 50 clear, proven scalability rulesâ€“and practical guidance for applying them. 

Abbott and Fisher transform scalability from a â€œblack artâ€ to a set of realistic, technology-agnostic best practices for supporting hypergrowth in nearly any environment, including both frontend and backend systems. 

For architects, they offer powerful new insights for creating and evaluating designs. For developers, they share specific techniques for handling everything from databases to state. For managers, they provide invaluable help in goal-setting, decision-making, and interacting with technical teams. Whatever your role, youâ€™ll find practical risk/benefit guidance for setting prioritiesâ€“and getting maximum â€œbang for the buck.â€
