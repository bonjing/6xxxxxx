u have 100mbit isp? im sure not. Others may have even worse isp channel, so p2p is better in this situation than game launcher whose even cannot download without glitches...

imho: p2p rulez ;)

to anyone:
im now behind router so i cant seed 24/7
for the game though, she not updates that often(only expoit and bug issues). im be on lookout for major updates(like hd track textures update) and make torrent as soon as they out to public.

commaner out."
