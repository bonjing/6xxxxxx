,martialis,2011-05-16T17:40Z,"A=10 V=10, obviously

though it's split into 2 pieces, god knows why"
,adelarge655321,2011-05-17T02:49Z,"Well, it's a genuine version, and the quality is 10/10 on every level, so that's probably why it's in a two CD format. Finally!! I've been waiting for this movie for quite a long time, since it only played in theaters for a very short period round here and I regrettably missed it. Thanks a lot, TvTeam!"

,El-solo,2011-06-30T20:23Z,It could have easily been made into one file.
,goudacheese,2011-07-05T02:49Z,"It was split so it could be burned into CDs. Not sure why as a blank DVD is probably cheaper.

I'll go look for a single file"
,Snaffer,2011-07-18T12:45Z,Same.. Looking for a single file.
