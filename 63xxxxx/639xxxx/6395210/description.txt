Description

Krotki film o milosci (A Short Film About Love), the second of Krzysztof Kieslowski's Decalogue episodes to be transformed into a feature film (the other being A Short Film about Killing), takes a unique look at the emotional latticework that interconnects love, lust, and sexual obsession. Hypnotically engrossing, this picture delves deep into the psyches of its two main characters, employing irony, humor, and drama to weave a masterful tale of human interaction.

In A Short Film About Love, Krzysztof Kieslowski, through his collaborators, screenwriter Krzysztof Piesiewicz, composer Zbigniew Preisner, and cinematographer Witold Adamek, displays superb directorial skills, presenting a complex web of emotions and ideas with precise visual economy and effective restrained performances from a capable cast.
