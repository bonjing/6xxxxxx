,teh_firestart3r,2011-12-20T17:52Z,"It stopped working...

Tried to update my Nod32 (using nodlogin) and got a message saying that there's an update available for the software: 10.0.59.

Can someone upload it for us? I can't understand the website of the program because it's in spanish...

Thanks a lot"

10.0.59 is new version, someone please torrent it."
