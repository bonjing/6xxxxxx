If you've downloaded my "108 Windows 7 Dark Themes to Die For!" then you have some idea what kind of bad ass mojo that is goin' on here. I just don't like the fact that the only desktop wallpapers you see are just the ones related to each individual theme, you can't just see all of them, on random.. that is, not unless you do what I did, and extract all of the High Res. Wallpapers into one place, then rename them for posterity. It really is a sight! You'll see. Just download this torrent of some 261 High Res. pictures and manually change the setting in Windows 7 so that whatever theme you fancy, the desktop background, &/or the screensaver, will randomly choose photos from the folder you put these in, My Pictures is a perfect place. This is the final touch to my torrent (even though it isn't MY material that I created) .. you all should immensely enjoy the artwork collected here... Cool? All Right.... :D
