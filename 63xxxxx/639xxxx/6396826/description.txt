This album was critised by some Gaelic journalists due to the lack of Gaelic songs, however Runrig have realised that the big world out there does not speak or understand gaelic, they do understand good professionally presented music and lyrics. 

Siol Ghoraidh (the geneology of goraidh)is my track of choice, if you ever get a chance to see the video Live at Stirling Castle you will see and hear the anger, dispair and ancient history within the lyrics of the song.

In summary the best album to come out of Scotland in many years. Forgot the false Gaelic or Celtic music of some of the current groups coming out of the Britain, Runrig live and breath the experience and their music is not staged to be fashionable.
