If you're going to waste our time, at least say if it's an .avi or .mkv.

FUCK RAR!!!  Do you have a 10GB HDD or something?  I really don't get it anymore.

FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

@jkeller80
1. ""Warez"" are relased packed since before you were born. Do YOU have a 10GB HD with no space left to unpack, cause you can't be crying over the 5-10 seconds it takes, right.
2. If the torrent have x264 in the title name, it's always MKV. 720p and 1080p are pretty solid leads too.
3. FUCKING UNGRATEFUL NOOB, FLAMING OBVIOUS THINGS!!!!!!!!!!"

,herniator,2011-05-16T06:51Z,"Archived torrents are bad because most people will delete the archives after unpacking which makes seeding impossible.  I'll be damned if I'm going to keep two copies of all the videos I download, I don't have unlimited disk space."

,kosdarkman,2011-05-16T08:28Z,"All ranting aside RAR files inside torrents are a huge pain in the ass and you all know it. Why post them?

For those of you bragging about how the ""scene"" works grow a fucking brain. The entire point should be for you to make a proper translation from one system to the other not try to force old outdated ways of doing things on a newer better way of distribution.

And yes I've been there done that. I distributed warez when you were a twinkle in your daddy's eye. I had root on one of the biggest sites there was back in the day because a guy I worked with ran the site and I helped him. So stuff your ""scene"" crap up your ass. Back then t1's where huge and games came on floppy disks. We adjusted to CDs etc etc. You should do the same moron."

,ZeTomes,2011-05-16T09:27Z,"the question is, Genius ones, despite RAR being an outdated, oldfashioned, useless or NOT, or as the fashion pushes to think so, IT'S a criteron -  YOU are dowloading this, not the opposite. YOU aren't contributing to this community, the original seeder IS - YOU only have the job to unrar (oh... so, so, boooring) and were not YOU who had the work to obtain the video, to acquire its quality, to be meticulous enough to be syncronized with its broadcast... Well, bratly speaking, you only have to do this - Accept the Criteron of the uploader, or do loadly upload yourselves, with the same points of impecable quality the episode YOU are obtaining freely... but not ""RAAARed"" - until then, the quality of your opinions is equal or less than - BULSHIT!!! "
,Evilution,2011-05-16T09:28Z,"If unpacking the rar is too much work each time, get RARFileSource  ( http://forum.inmatrix.com/index.php?showtopic=7821 ) , set it up properly and you can open the first Rar-file in an archive and select whatever video-file within it and play. It works alrite if you donĂÂ´t feel like unpacking everything you download.
Works with Zoomplayer atleast, think i read there it was useable with some other player aswell, but i only use Zoomplayer :p"
,Dgcz,2011-05-16T09:30Z,"herniator has a strong point: most downloaders will get rid of RARs, which means bad seeding...

RARs have no benefits whatsoever but several drawbacks - really cannot understand why would anyone still use this method...
(and if for old tradition: why not use 1.44 MB slices? that was also ""rule of the scene"" once...)"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-16T09:32Z,"It's funny and educational to see the big mouthsz, the expertssz... the loaded guru-informaticszzz, and their amount of uploaded torrentsszzz, zeerossszzz. I told you more than once - GO BUY SOME DIPERSSSZZZ while available on stores! "
,everbleed,2011-05-16T10:24Z,"jkeller80's comment was really funny. While I don't get that angry at RARed torrents, I more often than not choose the uncompressed option if available. Yes, it does take only a few seconds to unpack but it still is a slight annoyance; perhaps a mental thing more than anything else.

It doesn't apply in this case because sceneline has good rep but in the case of unknown uploaders, one is always more hesitant because you can't see exactly what is in the torrent.

For those going apeshit over how it is a ""CRITERION of the uploader"" (sic), yes, I understand that but it's a nonsensical ""criterion"". What is the purpose? And for those who're saying how everyone should ""stfu because it's free"", well so is speech.

Credit to sceneline for the timely upload regardless. It's people like them who keep the scene alive. But yes, it would make life just a tiny bit easier if you didn't RAR that shit."
,rafael1234,2011-05-16T12:41Z,"to quote someone from episode 4 of GOT: 

""jmd88 at 2011-05-09 13:22 CET:
@ chair_tard, reverend_dak, exaulted

I usually agree with what TF's articles, but in this case, the person who wrote the article was ignorant of why multipart RARs are used. The articles assumption that the practice does nothing for the BitTorrent protocol is absolutely correct, but please understand that they are not being archived for BitTorrent downloaders. This archival method DOES have many benefits for older protocols like FTP and is also important on the Usenet.

Now to the important part. Automated scripts are used to download files from Usenet, FTP sites, or private trackers and post them here. This allows you to get you files much sooner and at much higher speeds. Prolific uploaders like sceneline could not comply with your request if they wanted to.

It should additionally be noted that packaging of already compressed data is NOT being done to save space by any stretch of the imagination. It actually makes the file-size ever so slightly larger.

If you want to complain, complain to sceners instead of pillars of our online community. Hint: You won't get very far.""

now why is it the people that whine loudest never have a single upload to their name
thanks sceneline"
,ZeTomes,2011-05-16T13:37Z,"The question is as follows and nothing more, while your opinions are based on lazy fingers with 0 contributions to this community, scavenging the most you can, don't giving a damn about people that HAD the WORK and WILL to put available these torrents so that YOU can freely acess data which eihter would cost you money OR would give you a headache to find it in a store, these people ARE the reason of piratebay existence and the possibility to ACESSING freely. So, if you reflect a little AND start to upload the CD or the movie that your papas gave to you in your birthday, probably, not for sure I admit, you'd realize what you think is an alter-guru-ego-techno-web, is in fact, POO, and the RAR stuff... well... why don't you go see if I'm online kay?"

I find it ironic that people whine about how easy it is to unrar the files. So why is it so hard for sceneline to unrar them before he uploads? That way all of us don't have to deal with two copies on our hard drives etc etc etc. Pot kettle black."

You have to be more specific I'm afraid. Are you trying to say:

1 - Nooo!!! please we want torrents RARed (with a disapointed tone - because there's this grop of moaning selfish moaners criticizing RAR compression);

2 - Nooo!!! (enough of opressing RARs) RAR to the people. (knowing freeware is not well viewed by politics, therefore the lack of exclamation)

3 - Nooo!!! Enough of RARs, enough of free stuff, we want to pay! (the lack of exclamation quotes this serious doubt about it - you realize you've put yourself in the middle of a paradox)

4 - You are reallt really asking to become a, integrated and honoured member of the ""Total BULLSHIT Dummies"" group??, (outstanding interrogation analysing his braveness for the tough job)

or,

5 - You want to win the contest of whom is capable of uploading minus (-) number of torrents (not physical possible tough.. yet..!) at the same time downloading thousands in contrast, and even more difficult, say the highest quantity of DUMB universal amiba brainless things...

Maaan you got muscle!
What a tough task you got ahead did you know that? (by the way, go see if I'm only online)"
,jmd88,2011-05-17T04:11Z,"@ Everyone screaming, ""Mommy, there are RARs in MY BitTorrent!""

And for the last time, scene releases,  high volume of uploads, seedboxes, and CPU usage caps. Think about it and why unRARing might pose a significant problem for some uploaders.

Also, EZTV actually provides it the way you prefer it, so there really is nothing to whine about. Sure, there is some delay, but it must be worth it considering how much as you seem to hate archives.

@ Dgcz

Honestly, if they deleted the files immediately, they were not going to seed regardless. I don't seem to have any issues deleting the extracted file when I'm done with it and continuing to seed the torrent.

@ Several people in this thread using the good ol' post count = penis size argument...

I have no uploaded torrents on TPB myself, but when I download something here, I seed back at least 5x. If there is already an upload posted, making my own would simply split seeding resources and harm the community. This is probably the same boat in which most users here find themselves. It is not fair to judge a user's contribution by his post count. Without a dedicated community of seeders, initial uploaders would not get very far. Most seeders probably don't even have an account here. Personally, I only have one myself to surf porn more easily."
,ZeTomes,2011-05-17T04:55Z,"well, i have to disagree with you about uploading or seeding being the same if not by the existence of some dedicated members. 

1st there's one thing called inter-library, a torrent database if you want: libraries aren't also (but mostly yes) constructed by dedicated members, they also (in a vast net of libraries) are by people that want to contribute somehow to the diversity* of that same library.

2nd there's this thing (phrase above*) called diversity which even being the most dedicated member you couldn't reach that same diversity within a vast net of contributors - simply put, because diferent tastes and knowledge are not measurable - take the example of Wikipedia.

3rd even if I contribute with one thing, and even that thing being a sub-genre of the same species (diferent resolution, format, language, edition, etc) that thing could be precisely what anoother person in the opposite corner was searching for. It's not virtual what I'm saying, I experienced that several times and it's one of the reasons I'm wasting the top of my fingers writing this.

and 4rth, well, 4rth is called community ethics which in simple terms says:

you're not obligated to upload things, but as the same way you don't have that obligation, you don't have the merits to judge or criticize the terms of criteria (of course when they are perfectly functional and are translucid in their purpose) of something that you'll use freely and was put acessible by someone that in opposition to you, decided to share.

Have I make myself clear or you'd like to take a look if I'm online?

Cheers"
,kosdarkman,2011-05-23T04:28Z,"sceneline has 138 seeds left a week later. eztv with the raw video file has 3000+. I think its pretty obvious what happens when you post rars. Most people delete the rars and stop seeding.

,jkeller80,2011-07-20T19:54Z,"I have had several comments about my little rant but the truth is, I have a Synology diskstation with 4TB and extracting a RAR is deathly slow.  

I love the Synology b/c it has a torrent manager built in and throws it to the appropriate folder but this is a bit I still don't get.

That is because:
!!!
This FIRST and FIFTH episode from CTU have
F@CKED SOUND.
!!!
They has stereo dolby digital with 5.1 dolby digital header. (check with MPC and media info and compare to other eps)
Many problems with decoders in TVs players and software that presume that coders aren't idiots and/or n00bs and can't cope with errors.
Use ""Avidemux2"" and copy video, reencode audio to stereo 384kbit AC3(aften), and output set to MKV. Save as ""ep01firststep.mkv"". 3 minutes and done.
Unfortunately avidemux generates unseekable .mkv's
You need to demux it using ""MKVextractGUI-2""
and then mux 2 generated files back using ""MKV Merge"".
Have fun.
