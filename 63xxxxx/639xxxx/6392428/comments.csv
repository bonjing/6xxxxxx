[V],extremezone,2011-05-14T22:49Z,yes false positive you need to add to firewall-disable av to play
,drmarco,2011-05-14T23:15Z,"cant extract the skidrow.dll from the iso file, can someone put the crack in another torrent?"
[V],extremezone,2011-05-15T01:03Z,disable your av first to copy/use crack
,Johnny1010,2011-05-15T02:11Z,"extremezone i disabled my av but the file still wont work, can u make a new crack torrent?"
,drmarco,2011-05-15T02:44Z,"still didnt work, crack torrent pls o/"
,Nightbreeder,2011-05-15T03:30Z,"Uninstall the game, reboot, always good to reboot. Then disable anti-virus, then start extracting and installing. Ur AV might be catching the file on the fly, so just start from scratch."

,ziggyb,2011-05-15T10:25Z,The skidrow file is Read Only.. that's why it doesn't let us copy it from the ISO. The computers asks for permission
,ziggyb,2011-05-15T10:30Z,spoke too fast... turning off the anti virus works... Why is it almost all skidrow cracks are seen as viruses now.. It wasn't like that before
,Mattyo9,2011-05-15T17:02Z,"Disabled AV completely, extracted crack from ISO but still unable to play."
[V],blaze69,2011-05-15T18:18Z,"SKIDROW Team have already explained, that the crack file may be flagged as a virus by most overly protected antivirus software Over @ RLSLOG.net.  Scene Release Groups always tests their crack and make sure It's working...  Please Just disable Ur antivirus Software before attempting To apply Crack. also Afterwawrds add The File Path to ur Antivirus Exclusion List... 
Also Saw a Moderator Shouted Nuked >> ? LOL...

Game Works Perfect.. Thank U Very Much Extremezone For Taking The Time To Make This Possible For Us To Get..."
[V],blaze69,2011-05-15T18:37Z,"@ ziggyb

developers these make Most Games With a Tighter SecureRom/DRM.. So Scene Group/Crackers have To Add More Effort Plus More Encrytion Into their .dll Or .exe Files. By Adding More encryption Into these Files, Most Antivirus Software Cannot Check The Bytes in these Files and Then Start to go Crazy Flagging It as a Virus In which it Is NOT :)"
,ziggydh,2011-05-16T01:13Z,what is the serial key?
,ziggydh,2011-05-16T01:14Z,pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
,necrovamp,2011-05-16T04:53Z,"I have confirmed this is 100% working, the big thing you need to do, is make an OFFLINE account, for windows live
I am running it right now and can show screenshots and vids for proof

Run with battlevschess.exe and then make sure when it asks you to make An account, try pressing home, and see if you can play without it, (which means you already have an account and its signed in) or make one
but do not make it a LIVE account, it is an offline account

Step by step

Wait for the game to start and you can see your mouse
For people new to windows Live

After the game starts it should immediately ask you to create a profile

1. Click create new profile
2. at the first screen scroll down and click on the hidden link that says ""Create offline profile""
3. Pick your name, and then when it asks you ""Join LIVE free"", just select DONE


For people Who already have an account
1. Click the back button on the top left-hand corner (or press home key)
2. Press home key to bring the menu back up.
3. Choose the middle button to create a profile
4. At the next screen which only contains text, scroll Down and click ""Create local profile) which is a hidden link in the text
3. Pick your name, and then when it asks you ""Join LIVE free"", just select DONE

You will NOT need a serial key
The skidrow.dll is a false positive, Disable your antivirus or add it to the whitelist, I also saw someone who could not even extract it from the iso after disabling antivirus, sometimes an antivirus will corrupt a rar or iso file if there is a false positive in it, in that case you will need to have your antivirus disabled while you redownload the file

I recommend AVAST free edition, using it for years, never had a virus"

,swordf,2011-09-28T01:07Z,"i was hoping this would be like archon ultra, but its not

its chess meets guitar hero in a lame way

battles are stupid, all you do is press an arrow key kinda like in guitar hero or those stepmania games, its stupid, theres no challenge to it repeatitive as hell, you can kill all enemy with 1 peon

u can also play classic chess but im a not a chess fan, 
so this game is not for me"

What operating system?

Prior Security Software?

Any security software still installed?

A possible reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.
You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:
