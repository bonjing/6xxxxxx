Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time 
I feel alive and the world it's turning inside out Yeah! 
I'm floating around in ecstasy 
So don't stop me now don't stop me 
'Cause I'm having a good time having a good time 

I'm a shooting star leaping through the skies 
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity 
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva 
I'm gonna go go go 
There's no stopping me 

I'm burning through the skies Yeah! 
Two hundred degrees 
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic man of you 

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time 
I'm having a ball don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time just give me a call 
Don't stop me now ('Cause I'm having a good time) 
Don't stop me now (Yes I'm having a good time) 
I don't want to stop at all 

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars 
On a collision course 
I am a satellite I'm out of control 
I am a sex machine ready to reload 
Like an atom bomb about to 
Oh oh oh oh oh explode 

I'm burning through the skies Yeah! 
Two hundred degrees 
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic woman out of you 

Don't stop me don't stop me don't stop me 
Hey hey hey! 
Don't stop me don't stop me 
Ooh ooh ooh (I like it) 
Don't stop me have a good time good time 
Don't stop me don't stop me 
Ooh ooh Alright 
I'm burning through the skies Yeah! 
Two hundred degrees 
That's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit 
I'm trav'ling at the speed of light 
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you 

Don't stop me now I'm having such a good time 
I'm having a ball don't stop me now 
If you wanna have a good time 
Just give me a call 
Don't stop me now ('Cause I'm having a good time) 
Don't stop me now (Yes I'm having a good time) 
I don't wanna stop at all
