Gogol Bordello is a Gypsy punk band from the Lower East Side of New York City, formed in 1999 and known for theatrical stage shows and persistent touring. Much of the band's sound is inspired by Gypsy music. The band incorporates minor-key accordion and violin (and on some albums, saxophone) mixed with punk and dub. The band has appeared in a number of independent films, most notably in 2005's Everything Is Illuminated in which the lead singer, Eugene HÃ¼tz, co-starred with Elijah Wood in a dramady\adventure story about the Nazi purges in Ukraine. The entire group was present for one shot in which they played a brass band. Gogol Bordello contributed two songs to the film's score, "Bublitschki", and "Start Wearing Purple".
