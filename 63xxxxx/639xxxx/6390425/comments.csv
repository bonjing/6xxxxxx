,djbaaz,2011-05-14T10:02Z,any1 confirm this?
,Fantafaust,2011-05-14T16:33Z,"I could confirm it, but I'm the uploader lol. Anyways, could anyone who downloads seed for at least 12-24 hours? It would really help the other people trying to get the game.

Oh, and when the game works, could you post a response on here if you have a TPB account?"
