Here's a complete season 2 in Xvid, if I didn't bollocks it up.  I have a dvr with USB that accepts .avi files; it\\\'s much more pleasant to watch on the big tv than sitting at the computer all evening.  In case anyone else has need of this format.

And since this is my first attempt at creating a torrent, if I did screw up please let me know, and how to fix it.
