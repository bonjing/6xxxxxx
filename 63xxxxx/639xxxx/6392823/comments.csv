,harvey_weinstein,2011-06-19T19:40Z,Quality's not great but it's certainly watchable. 
,wetmouse,2011-08-02T14:03Z,"Nor is there a whole hell of a lot of competition at the moment (Brigzy, you ingrateful ingrate! Where are you going to get a better season 2 right now?)"
,GhOsTRiDeROwN,2011-08-16T22:07Z,"Nice to be your first time man :) But for your next torrent, name it like other torrents here on thepiratebay, for example : 

Ice.Pilots.NWT.S02.XviD , but that is 100% up to you :) 

Have a nice day !"
,IcedCoffeeMate,2011-08-24T21:07Z,"dude, seriously i've downloaded and watched worse. If it's so shitty why don't you upload your own version? It's not half as bad as I thought it was going to be"
[V],mirogster,2011-10-13T20:34Z,"It's probably my upload (webrip .flv files), converted to xvid. Effect? Fckin huuuge file, with crappy quality - cuz from flv you CAN'T make HD quality. It's a fact, but some ppl just are, well ...soooo simpleminded."
