Thnx for the DL, please advise if the image would actually fit on a CD, as it appears to be more MB than the normal 700MB CD's, any advice appreciated"

,ak-100,2011-05-17T11:10Z,goin to download this.... thanks to you do_not_delete_me_blindly.... i hope it works fine as the previous version.....
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-05-17T13:32Z,"@phatpigeon,
 you did not boot from it, you just placed the CD in the optical unit and started your old (existing) Xp !

Enter BIOS, select the first booting device CD-DVD unit, exit bios saving the config. and when it says: ""Press any key ..."" do listen to it.

@Reneage, 
If there is a real freeze and not something else...there are many things that could generate it:
- dry thermal paste between a vital component and it's cooling device (GPU, CPU, N-Bridge, S-Bridge)
- unsupported overclocking
- bad BIOS config
- bad hardware jumper insertion
- unproper connection or function of a device (RAM, floppy, HDD)
- infected boot
- laptop PC that has a specific hardware ID made by the bitchy producer...that supports some special versions of XP...specially made for those rare laptops
- bad HDD formatting 
so on
try to observe it more, report something more specific so that we could focus on the issue "
,Twitch852,2011-05-17T14:24Z,"Nice! I had little to do, most of my normal changes were already done.
Remote Registry access off, ActiveX disabled (mostly), 
text in bold, even the folder options were already set.

Autoupdates is off in the control panel, yet the service is on.

I wanted to install it from within XP, but after reading the comments
I booted it. Was flawless.

Thank you."
,xGaribaldi,2011-05-17T17:06Z,@do_not_delete_me_blindly Can you please tell me how i burn this? i got some clean dvd-r 16x 4.7 gb. But im quite a noob. Can you please tell me if i can use those and how?

[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-05-17T20:09Z,"@xGaribaldi
it will not let you burn the image on a dvd disk
you must pick a CD blank
I think I know what confused you..me mentioning that 16X speed that somehow resemblances more with DVD standard...
NO ! all I ment was that you have to burn this image on a CD blank disk, using a slow speed burning, not a DVD blank !
to burn this on a DVD somebody has to do some changes for you, or use special tools such as alcohool functions or ultraiso to extract the boot info and reconstruct the content for a bigger disk format, reattach the boot info...but this is not the issue, pick a CD BLANK and burn it slow speed "
,ChimpyNuts,2011-05-18T02:02Z,"Hey mate I downloaded and tried to install it but I got this message ""\system32\hal.dll is missing or corrupt. Please reinstall it""
Any ideas?"
[V],do_not_delete_me_blindly,2011-05-18T11:06Z,"@ChimpyNuts
this happens when:
- somebody uses a poor quality CD blank
- CD blank it is scratched or dirty
- has an old non functional optical unit
- burns the image using a high unsupported speed
- it is malintentioned and tries vainly to scare others from using this (not ur case) ;)"
,rknight2010,2011-05-19T09:22Z,32 or 64 bit?
,rknight2010,2011-05-19T09:24Z,":O nvm

- English 32 bits version
- No serial, no activation (provided you burn a CD and install XP by booting from it on a clean partition)
- Bye a new, unscratched CD blank and burn this iso image using 16X speed, not 48X !

Optionally you may choose to install from the Utils Directory, usefull Full version software		"

,stanran,2011-05-22T08:53Z,"Would this work, if I used Daemon Tools Lite, to mount the Iso? .. Or will it only start the process, then stop, as freshly installing an OS, formats the drives, which would cause Daemon Tools to get erased during the process of re-installation? "

,inevit21,2011-06-03T02:33Z,"Ok for all those people who want to boot it via usb,so that use can install it in a netbook

*first dowload wintoflash (it is a software that allows to flash your os on a usb flash drive)
*download Daemon tools or anything similar like (alcohol etc)
*mount your microsoft xp sp3 image using the tool
*now again goto wintoflash and select the advanced tab and there you have options to select the os then press next
*set the windows source path as the mounted cd drive(in my case it is F:)
*set the usb drive as your flash drive eg E:/

press next,next and then it will format your usb and write the data into it

There it is you have a bootable winxp flashdrive"

,harryjohn09,2011-06-16T06:35Z,"Hi Uploader.. I have some issues about rebooting it in my pc:
1. I dl this torrent and mount it with daemon tools lite.
2. I burned it using nero 9 in minimum speed with a CD-R 52x disk. (burns flawless anyway)
3. Reboot my pc and change my boot settings to cd-rom but there are no set-up appearing, usually it appears and I should press any key so it will work but I didn't see any setup but instead it rebooted my old xp OS.
4.Just to make sure the cd works, Ive tried to install it in non-bootable method but it asks for key...

Hope there's a smart feedback for you Uploader!!

Thanks and Blessed be!!"
