[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-16T22:11Z,Always wait 10 - 30 minutes before seeders will appear.
,MasterFasterVDOWN,2011-05-16T22:18Z,"Chris-Aksel not the only difference. Stun uploaded the original rar files, but you uploaded the isos. Of course both torrents are good. It's a matter of preference.

I prefer the original rar files always. They come with sfv and thus I can verify file integrity.

I would suggest if you can to include with your torrents md5 and sha1 checksums for the iso images. That way we can always verify the files.

Before you say that torrents have internal hash check, I can tell you that nothing is guaranteed. For example, uTorrent has a big bug with its write caching method. Few times it can corrupt files, even though force recheck says that all is ok. It happened to me a least two times in the past. There is though a workaround for uTorrent to bypass this bug.

Anyway, sorry for my mumbling :D

Thanks for the upload and all your efforts. :)

Greets,
MasterFaster"

,xiIix,2011-05-16T23:52Z,"Who gives a flying fuck about hash checks and MD5 sums. I haven't gotten a corrupted torrent in YEARS and when they are, it's usually because they were corrupt before they were even uploaded. Seriously, it's so rare to get a corrupted torrent it's not even worth the trouble. If utorrent has a hash bug then don't use utorrent. I don't. I use a japanese client called Thunder and it's badass."

Don't agree. I think that no matter how much piracy exists the games companies will continue to gain a lot of money!

They say: ""With a pirate download we lose a sale.""

I say: No. Even if it was impossible for me to get a pirated game I wouldn't buy one, as I cannot afford. Sou you are not losing any sale.
Maybe I could by those legacy games from Steam, that are cheap, but not the fresh expensive releases. They are cheaper at US, but I'm from Brazil, here the import taxes are extremely high, making the prices on imported products go about 100% (or more) higher than at US. Not saying about the minimum wage here that is equivalent to US$ 377."
