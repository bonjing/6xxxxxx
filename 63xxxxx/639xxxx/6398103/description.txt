 RELEASE NOTES


The second installment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of
Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new
standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition
to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system
that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new,
modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and
sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and
believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story,
dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that
made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much
more advanced and sophisticated way.

Features:

A truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear
game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative
events are dependent on the player s choices and lead to multiple
different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time
gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and
packed with events.

A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter
seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and
attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of
the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt s personal theme,
in which he's looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how
powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to
play.

Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski's book series and
The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues
sequences, thanks to a new game engine.

New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in
which we observe the link between our past choices with current
actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.

Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of
best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide
an incredible, believable story-driven experience.

Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and
goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels,
powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions
we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further
actions in the game.

Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine
create a cohesive, fully accessible world!

Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life
and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the
game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or
close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.

Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a
wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers,
jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.
