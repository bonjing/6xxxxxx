,LordMaxxx,2011-05-16T03:24Z,"There is a CRC error in the archive. As a result - no voting, the music only (used winrar and 7zip)."
,ariete66,2011-05-16T12:09Z,Missing archive s.00. Can uploader fix this? And thanks for your effort.
,Hydra25,2011-05-16T18:13Z,"The uploader has made a new torrent, but you can also fix this problem yourself. Rename all the files ending in .r100 to .r127, and instead name them .s00 to .s27. If you do that, the file will extract correctly."
