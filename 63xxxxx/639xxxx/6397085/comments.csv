Returning hate for hate multiplies hate, adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.”

,thedarkknight215,2011-08-11T13:38Z,"so basically  PhiberOptix suggesting US should not  have killed osama bin laden?
i wonder if his family members were  killed by him him , he would have said the same thing ??easy to tell philosophy sitting in ur bedroom ."
,Badlend,2011-09-13T08:26Z,"Since there is an incredible amount of evidence out there about the Pakistani ISI, the United States CIA, the Israeli Mossad's and some NGO's largely unmentioned involvement of 9/11 and the incredible lack of evidence that links Osama Bin Laden to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 other than the fake video of a fatter, darker, and broad face impersonator apparently confessing to 9/11.  The 9/11 families of the victims demand for answers were largely ignored, until they went to the press. The spotlight prompted the government to issue the 9/11 Commission which was NOT a criminal investigation. But, a mere inquiry. There was outcry of the conflictive interests of the commissioners. Some had to step down. The commission report was proven to be largely inaccurate. There are record detailed in the movie ""9/11 Press For Truth"" that details the accounts of the U.S. having prior knowledge of the attacks, of the Florida hotel that Bush was staying at having surface to air missile present for his protection. But later lying to the media claiming it was out of the blue. I could go on for hours but all PhiberOptix is pointing out is that it is despicable to celebrate the death of another person. In this case a person that was possibly framed. Beside just go to the FBI's Most Wanted. The crime he is wanted for is listed as ""August 7, 1998, bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. "" Not to mention the report of his death is full of more holes then Osama's alleged corpse."
