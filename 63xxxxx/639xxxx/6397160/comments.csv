,nittany,2011-05-17T09:27Z,"You PS3 people should stop trying to play movies using your console then you won't run into that Cinavia crap.  GO BUY A WD TV LIVE player.

I've had a WD TV Live player for awhile, it plays back everything. I've only had problems with a few movies, but the new firmwares they have issued have fixed them. If you're a torrent/usenet person then most likely you already have one of these or a Popcorn Hour or a HTPC running XBMC. I have a popcorn hour A-110 and a WD TV Live.

If you're a noob and still don't understand why most people buy a WD TV Live player, then I'll put it in clear words. It's the cheapest/fastest/easiest way to play back your pirated movies/TV shows through your TV. Some people use their game consoles like a PS3 or xbox 360 but they have too many limitations. Why hassle with that shit when you can spend less then a Benjamin and get a player that can handle almost any movie codec u throw at it.
