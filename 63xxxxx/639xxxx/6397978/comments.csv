,smudge2007,2011-05-18T02:28Z,"One of the best comedy series produced by the BBC. Brilliantly performed by Dennis Waterman. Dennis Waterman (Tony Carpenter) is a self-made millionaire and owner of a booming executive car-hire business. He's made his way to the top but hasn't forgot his East-End roots, and, much to his snooty wife's disgust, he treats his employees like friends. There's Mrs Wembley (Joan Sims) the cook, Sam (Sam Kelly) the chauffeur and of course his personal assistant Maggie, none of whom he could live without. Follow this comical bunch of characters and Tony's troublesome daughter through trials and tribulations, in this sitcom about life when it's on the up! Absolu"
