,papitow,2011-05-16T19:31Z,1080p even better. Thanks BOZX
,Fred927,2011-05-17T22:43Z,Audio is protected by Cinavia.. You can't stream this to your PS3.. :(
[V],HolyRoses,2011-05-18T16:16Z,so buy a popcorn hour device.  your problem with the PS3 is never going to go away.
,imnangler,2011-05-19T21:35Z,"HolyRoses: I guess your just another jealous Xbox owner - the file works just fine and the quality is awsome with DTS audio...as is every other movie download. Get a clue.
Fred: You must have some sort of issue with your configuration. I use PS3 Media Server with CCCP Codec Pack and mkv@vob...you can also put in avsynth and tsmuxer for good measure. All free and are great."
,ferrit69,2011-05-20T11:15Z,"@imnangler Ah yes, im sure as an xbox owner they're supremely jealous of the PS3. Such things like playing online are only available via the PSN ...oh wait. LOL."
,imnangler,2011-05-20T14:35Z,ferrit: I didn't say anything about online capability...but I guess thats the only thing the Xbox has on par with the PS3...oh wait...the PS3 beats out the Xbox there too...lol. Your not clever...your JAJXO. I own both systems and the PS3 blows away the Xbox...sorry ferrit. Your prolly one of those console owners who still think the gamepad rules over mouse/keyboard combo. BTW - nice job letting the guy spreading false info on here get away but jump on me for the Xbox comment. But go on and continue to be a slave to MS as they do everything to screw their loyal customer base over. Get a clue.
,HalcyonJedi,2011-05-21T02:17Z,What about converting the file using MKV2VOB and playing it directly off the PS3 hard drive instead of streaming? Will the Cinavia still persist?
,imnangler,2011-05-21T14:24Z,The cinavia doesn't exist in my download. Please read the posts.
,imnangler,2011-05-21T20:00Z,I noticed that Ferrit69 hasn't responded - typical troll drive-by. I'm sure he'll make a good liberal.
,MJSisco93,2011-05-22T05:43Z,"imangler:  You're acting just as much of a troll as he was by saying ""I guess your just another jealous Xbox owner.""  Honestly though, if you think PSN is better than XBL I don't know what's wrong with you.  "
,imnangler,2011-05-25T04:55Z,A troll is someone who doesn't help but comments simply to be a dick. Where did I jump on someone before they said something stupid. I was trying to help the guy who thought the DL wouldn't work on his PS3. And when did I say that PSN is better than XBL? I stated the the PS3 (not PSN) kicks ass on the Xbox 360 (not XBL). Get yours facts straight or STFU. Geez...what a dumb-ass.
,imnangler,2011-05-25T05:04Z,"MJ: Now that I think about it...PSN is better than XBL as far as I can see. I find it easier to navigate, it's super fast and I don't have to purchase more points than the game actually uses (unlike XBL). So please tell me how the Xbox and/or XBL is superior to PS(and don't tell me game selection)."
,Laurentious2,2011-05-28T18:59Z,can i plug this vid with usb/external hard drive into a bluray player?will it work?
,MJSisco93,2011-06-01T07:55Z,"1.  Cross game chat with up to 8 people.  Honestly, I find it quite embarrassing that Sony is just now beginning to add a cross game chat feature, and Xbox Live has had at least a 1v1 cross game chat since launch, the 8 player cross game chat came in November 2008.
2.  As far as PSN is ""free"" let me say something about this.  The service may be free, but if you notice, they're starting to limit the free service, I mean that more and more are becoming part of the paid service.  For example, to start a party chat, you must be a member of Playstation Plus.
3.  PSN is superfast....so is XBL.
4.  I still don't understand what you mean ""you don't have to purchase more points than the game actually uses""?

One more thing, make sure you know how to insult someone before you do it.  ""I'll be he'll make a good liberal""?  Really dude?  Oh and don't forget ""Geez....what a dumb-ass""  Once you said that I knew you were under 13."
,MJSisco93,2011-06-01T07:59Z,"Oh, one more thing to add.  At least XBL wasn't down for a month because of hacking."
,imnangler,2011-06-01T23:34Z,"1- Who's trolling now.
2- PS3 is still free and Xbox has NEVER been free (Just like the other mud-flap you will make a great lib cause only a lib redefines a word to help their argument - free is free is free)
3- PS3 is a lot faster than the Xbox.
4- You have to buy groups of points on XBL - the points never add up to exactly what the game cost...so you ALWAYS have points left over that you can never get back. You didn't know this? The all knowing MJ? If you want i can draw you a diagram...i'll even do it in crayon.
5- Explain how calling you a dumb-ass guarantees that i'm in your childish age bracket?
6- ANYBODY can get hacked at ANYTIME...don't be naive.
Oh, and one more thing - how have ANY of your comments helped the persons in need on this thread? Again, typical lib drawl, label somebody the exact same thing you know yourself to be...a troll! Now, go take out the garbage kid."
,imnangler,2011-06-01T23:39Z,Laurentious: I don't know if that will work but I do know that if your TV has a media server built in and has a USB you can definitely do it that way...so I would have to assume that if your BD player has both too it will work also. If any of you need help with using your comp as a media server with PS3 just ask. It works amazingly well and unlike the Xbox you don't have to do ANY converting to play MKV 1080p movies...it will run them on the fly.
,MJSisco93,2011-06-03T22:44Z,"First of all, I'm a fucking conservative, so enough with ""lib draws"" and all that shit, and i hate people like you because it makes conservatives look fucking stupid.
2.  When did I ever say I knew everything?
3.  You're wrong about the adding up MS points.  They changed the amount you buy to even exactly.  On some purchases you even have an option to pay without using MS points.
4.  Free is free...true, but are you telling me you'd rather pay nothing for a piece of shit pick up truck, or pay not much money at all for a decent looking car?  Just because the pick up truck is free doesn't mean that it's better, just like comparing XBL to PSN.
5.  I think it's funny how you say ""who's trolling now?"", when you made a comment about how ferrit was a ""liberal"" for not responding, so I don't see why you're mad that I'm responding."
,imnangler,2011-06-07T16:02Z,"ROTFLMAO - Your one of those who hates the lib stereotype that your a lib in conservative clothing. I have seen it over and over - it's so funny watching libs who can't admit what they are - LOL.
Your comments and the attitude they convey just screams LIB!!! Sorry bud.
1- Well you act like you know everytthing when you so obviously don't. LIB LIB LIB
2- The MS points weren't always like that...if they changed it they did it recently. But that's ok I guess cause its MS - but when its PS its not ok, I refer to your comment: ""I find it quite embarrassing that Sony is just now beginning to add a cross game chat feature "" LIB LIB LIB
3- Now your going to try and explain how redefining a word to support your lame argument is ok. I told you I don't agree with you - I think PSN is better than XBL...but you'll keep beating a dead horse. LIB LIB LIB
4- I'm sorry if calling a spade a spade really annoys you. But I call it like I see it. I know the truth is difficult being what you are. LIB LIB LIB
Do us all a favor lib, be honest with yourself and true to who you are. Don't be embarrassed...be proud of what you are, even if what you are is a fact spinning, double talking, dishonest ignoramus.
I'll ask again - who have you helped on here? Who have you assisted with good advice? But then again you haven't answered any questions posed to you. And you wonder why I call you a troll.
FYI - when you curse and carry on like that it just exposes your low level of intelligence.
Oh BTW - how is that overheating and red ring of death problem working for you. I mean MS has had 3 iterations of the product to get it right and it still exists today. And how do you like the low def DVD player in a hi def world? But i'm sure you will explain all this away with more of your lib BS rather than admit the truth."
,MJSisco93,2011-06-08T20:39Z,"Lol if you want to think I'm a liberal, go right ahead, but you're incorrect.  I also think it's funny how you say LIB LIB LIB, when that probably makes you look less intelligent than my swearing...

I will say you're right about one thing, an opinion is an opinion.  If you want to believe PSN is better than XBL go ahead.  I'm not going to try and change your opinion bc that's not right.

Something I will have to say though, the RROD does still exist today, but I believe the problem is drawn out far worse than it really is.  You'd be surprised how rare the RROD is now a days."
,imnangler,2011-06-13T01:53Z,Uh-Huh
,below90hz,2011-06-19T21:04Z,"Ladies, ladies - you're BOTH pretty. lol"
,FpsM3rc,2011-06-24T23:39Z,^lol
,Jeepster1,2011-07-13T09:52Z,"Does anyone know if there is a 1080p 'AVCHD' version of this. 1080p AVCHD is such a good format lately as it is playable on virtually all Blu-ray players including the PS3 without the need for any conversions, transcodings or any of that processor intensive procedure. Naturally it would mean the uploader would have had to convert it from standard 1080p Blu-ray to 1080p AVCHD beforehand and saving downloaders the hassle of spending a couple of day's converting the movie.

Incidentally, I have to agree with 'imnangler'. I also own both the PS3 and Xbox and its the Xbox that gathers dust. I love that the PS3 is free (FREE) to play games online and absolutely begrudge and can't stand that money sucking Bill Gate's leech charging over the top for just about everything (another example: Legendary Mac OS X Snow Leopard 64bit rock solid OS Â£26 when it first came out, Windows 7 64bit Ultimate Â£299!).

When I was first disillusioned into buying the Xbox (ShitBox), I was frustrated and annoyed that it had NO WiFi network adapter (Â£60 extra if I wanted one), NO built in Hi Definition disk player, NO motion sensing/axis built into the fat-hand-aching controller, couldn't play AVCHD from consumer Hi-Def camcorders, couldn't play online for free, couldn't connect to a HD TV via HDMI cause originally it didn't have it (only component), problems with more superior DTS HD Master, etc, etc, etc.

Don't get me wrong, if you can afford and have both then I suppose you'll get the best of both worlds but stick to online gaming on the PS3, it's free after all. Shame that the recent hack attack was aimed at the 'free-to-play-online PS3 network' instead of the 'pay-to-play blood sucking Bill Gates network'.

I'm not being bias and if something has a fault or merit then I will be honest and point it out. Therefore the only thing (ONLY THING) that has always gone against the PS3 and is quite a fatal flaw in my opinion, is the problem with most of the games being only 720p and not the full 1080p. This is quite a bad issue because some HiDef 1080p LCD TV's have to 'down-scale' and therefore are not matching true one-on-one pixels with the TV's 1080p panel (also could never display full screen with a 'Just-Scan' mode). The result is that some pictures/games can look worse in 720p on a 1080p panel than they would on a 720p panel. Admittedly all Xbox games can display 1080p although many Xbox games are not 1080p source generated therefore Xbox cheats and uses internal 'Up-scalling' to give the next best thing. Why PS3 had this oversight and why it doesn't employ internal up-scalling is beyond me, I guess it was an overlooked design problem or the GPU has an issue. Still I prefer the PS3 weighing-up everything else.

Back to the torrent and many thanks to the uploader. I shall download and try to convert to AVCHD (takes a couple of days even on a quad-core giving 8 virtual cores).

I like this film having seen it before."
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-08-08T08:40Z,"To all those with Cinavia issues on their PS3.

If you have a DTS capable receiver, you can use PS3 Media Server and enable ""Keep DTS in stream"" option.

This will pass DTS wrapped in 2.0 channel LPCM thru to your receiver, bypassing any audio processing done by the PS3.  As long as the PS3 doesn't process the audio, it can't detect Cinavia.
Any DTS capable amp/receiver should be able to decode the 2 ch. LPCM and render it to 5.1 DTS audio.

I watch this movie on my PS3 with full DTS surround, and no Cinavia errors.

As far as you all arguing over 360 vs. PS3.

I run both, and I can say that without a doubt, the PS3 is a MUCH better media streaming device than the 360.  Not even close.

Gaming..........either or.  Depends on game.

Online..........PSN seems to have more grown ups, not so many knobs and little shits.

Graphics in game..........360 slightly

Menus/interactive...........PS3 much tighter, cleaner

BUT media streaming...............if you say the 360..............I call bullshit.  Only streams 5.1 with a very specific program (PMS MAGMA).  Otherwise 2 channel.
Many more supported filetypes on PS3, and ones that aren't, are easily 'transcode on the fly' with PS3 Media Server.  Transcoding to the 360 is 'hit or miss' at best.

,Vaxxer,2011-08-25T01:48Z,"Wow... What a cunt imnangler is... lol... PS3 has been hacked so many times anyway, and millions of people have have had their credit card information stolen because of this. so yeah, i think that pretty much crushes anything bad people have to say about xbox. lol, imnangler is probably just another cheeky PS3 owner who doesn't know anything..."
,imnangler,2011-08-27T14:07Z,"Vaxxer: Once again JAJXO!!! They are a dime a dozen and are incapable of having a mature discussion. Topic was over but you just had to troll on by...couple of questions:
1- State exactly how many times PS3 has been hacked - not the broad statement you made - to my knowledge it was once.
2- Do you own both systems? Because I do and I am doing a side-by-side comparison and giving my opinion. Where is your opinion coming from? Oh yea...according to you...if a company gets hacked they are permanently banned from having an opinion on their competition? if that's the case...your opinion means crap.
3- What purpose did your post serve? I mean other than letting everyone know that you are immature troll JAJXO!
Have fun living in your little bubble. And i'm sure you'll respond with more immature name calling instead of sticking to the topic at hand."
,Vaxxer,2011-09-01T00:12Z,"imnangler: Um, who the hell is JAJXO? Don't ask questions based on what someone else said. I find it funny that you think I'm a troll, just because I posted something you didn't like. When people don't know what to say to a person on the internet, they resort to saying they're a troll... Just calm down, and stop accusing me of being this ""JAJXO"". I also don't feel the need to provide these facts you request, because quite frankly, I don't give a shit. I don't need to prove anything to you, I'll just stick with my opinion and you stick with yours. I'll leave you alone now, seeing as you're one of those people who deals with things they don't like by flipping out and making accusations. I'm off to try and forget about your existance, and live life on a level much higher than yours."
,imnangler,2011-09-06T04:05Z,"Wow - OK...you have to be what...15? What an assinine response. I gave my opinion (and help) and you called me a cunt, and i'm the one flipping out. HAHAHA...your a joke. If you read ALL the posts you would know what it means. And of course you won't respond with anything but bullshit because thats what your full of. Oh..and also a shit load of hypocrisy. You won't answer the questions because you know they will make you look like the ignoramous that you so obviously are. If you didn't stick your nose in my existence you wouldn't have to be in it would you? Typical immature, dishonest, hypocrit that will grow up to be a great lib some day...keep it up kid...your on the fast track...but for now take out the garbage kid."
