,theshwag,2011-05-18T20:07Z,is that Kablam bullshit on every episode? There was ten minutes of bullshit on the first episode
[V],manOtor,2011-05-19T06:58Z,"@theshwag

No, only the first episode has additional Trailers, the others are all the original RIPs.
They are added to show people what else might be there of interest for them.

They run for exactly 3:45 minutes before the actual first episode of chucks begins - not 10 minutes!

And the KABLAM!!! is no bullshit, it's a section, where I promote my torrents on suprbay ;)!

If you don't like the ""bullshit"", don't download - it is that easy...
"
,theshwag,2011-05-19T19:20Z,"Well for 1 it runs before and after the first episode for a total of 11 min and 44 seconds. 

Secondly, I do thank you for the tracker, Chuck is a great show. I have previously gotten many trackers that you have uploaded, And every one of them have been of superb quality.

Problem I have with your advertising is that it's Hard coded to the episode, it is part of the file, I download trackers not only to not pay, but because the files here have no advertisements. No one is trying to hock their shit in my direction, or those that do I can avoid the files all together and not download the things I don't want. 

I know what I like and I will search for the shows I want. I don't need people trying to push it on me. Pimp your service by all means but 11 min is just a little too much.

You should at least put info saying that the first episode has 11 min of advertisements in the info so it isn't a ""WTF is this shit"" scenario like I ran into when I fired up the first episode. 

If I could un-download this I would have, but instead I guess I will just replace the first episode with one without 11 min of bullshit attached to it. "
,theshwag,2011-05-19T19:22Z,"Oh and Thank you very much for the rest of the episodes, they are awesome."
[V],manOtor,2011-05-19T20:16Z,"@theshwag:

Now that is something I can work with, rather than a ""bullshit"" rant ;).

O.k. - admittedly there are additional trailers after the episode, but I thought they might not really count, as most people just skip to the next one once an episode is over (at least I do - so I wouldn't even realize that there are trailers...).

I also accept that you feel like being pushed onto, although I wouldn't, as I like watching trailers, because sometimes I learn about a show I otherwise would have missed.

You are absolutely right about the Info, though!
I will from now on explicitly state in the description, that the first episode contains a few minutes of trailers.

I just really LOVE creating that trailer (and especially the KABLAM!!! teaser) shit and I want to share it show people that there is a nice thread about all kinds of tv shows on suprbay ;)...

But don't worry - next season I might not have the time to temper with the first episodes, then I probably will just include some extra trailers in the torrent and leave everything else as is :P."

Thank you very much for responding and taking into consideration your viewers point of view.

As a stand alone, I thought the trailers were in fact very entertaining (tho some more variety would be nice as I saw the same trailer in the opening and at the end - just nit picking tho)

You have renewed my faith in your trackers and I will continue to get your uploads as they are fantastic and well timed.

my issue was that you are using techniques that the main stream media are notorious for. Now I cannot speak for everyone and I am sure some people think I am being a total ass for making these comments. 

But, the original purpose of these torrents was to remove the Corporate Main stream Media jack holes from our viewing experience (and get stuff for free of course) 

I would hate to see such a great uploader like yourself be ""bought out"" and forget what the reason was for these torrents in the first place. It is happening to every great thing the internet has created. Youtube got advertisements, Hulu got plussed and so on and so forth.   

Now I don't want to turn this into a idealogical debate or anything like that, But if no one speaks up no one is heard. So I speak now and ask you a truly great uploader not to fall prey to the ideals that made us rebel in the first place. 

Thank you for your uploads, and the time you took to respond to my comments. "
[V],manOtor,2011-05-20T03:32Z,You are welcome :D !
,dxfwmad,2011-05-20T19:03Z,"v 2/10 a10/10 if you dont mind commercials this torrents for you, if you want your tv commercial free like me , dont dl, thanks anyway for tryin man0tor"
[V],manOtor,2011-05-21T01:48Z,"^^There are NO commercials in these episodes!!!^^
There are only two trailers and ONLY BEFORE episode 1!!!

I myself would rate
V:9/10
A:8/10

If you comment PLEASE check out more than just the beginning of the first episode. Give at least one other episode a try before stating that there is something wrong with the whole package!
Or just read the other comments.
Thank you!"
,dxfwmad,2011-05-24T05:23Z,"my apologies sir im used to the perfect rips (im a spoiled prick), without gratuitous ads at the begining and end, i thank you for the mere privilege of dling your high qual rips, and revise my rating to 9/10 on vid if it was only on the first ep but cmon theyre hour long eps i usually comment 5 min after the dl, your stuff is a million times better than the cheesy password protected rars, if you love chuck get this torrent im just a nit picky sob "
,dxfwmad,2011-05-24T05:35Z,"k lemme try this again, there are no commercials, at the beginning and end of the first ep theres garbage, but aparently the rest of it is good, considering the only other torrent is 20 gigs if you like chuck this torrents worth it, if it needs to be redistributed work the editing yourself on ep 1, it was a good rip and i appreciate it"
,gustitor123,2011-06-01T16:15Z,seed plzzzzzzz
,orchlon,2011-06-11T17:48Z,Episode 1 has 12 minutes worth of commercials on it 
,kmorley,2011-06-12T01:33Z,dood...for the love of god put a spoiler warning in your description...im dumb and started reading it and it pretty much ruined most of the season...
,alaap988,2011-07-10T00:46Z,"damn nice man
nice, i like the idea of kablam

and also thoughtful of you to include the chuck season 5 teaser
Mu-ha-ha :P"
,whirlyboy,2011-07-22T00:54Z,"I'm getting a hella slow download, seeders please?"
,SuBpk10,2011-07-26T08:54Z,"not goin that fast for me. any more people seeding would be grateful, ive nearly watched have of season 4 and want to be able to continue to the end with a gap in between while waiting for them to download"
,anguyen93,2011-08-21T06:40Z,"download then please seed, everyone. it's just courtesy!
it's been almost 20 hours and i'm @ 60%.. ahh i need my Chuck fix."
,alekk30,2011-09-27T19:54Z,this sucks... freezes 2-5 times each episodes... and ITS ONLY when something good/important comes up..
,oswi,2011-10-15T03:27Z,"I came, I looked & I read the comments but I will not be downloading as I want the programme & nothing but the programme.
Maybe you should not have hard coded the trailers but have them a a seperate file for those that want."
,MaGicbush,2011-10-20T07:06Z,"It's really not a big deal lmao, it's 11 minutes on only the first episode and the uploader did a good job with some of it honestly(effects, etc). Very good upload.

A/10
V/9"
,annallia,2011-11-07T01:40Z,Is it just me or is the audio out of sync on episode 11? Not at the beginning but towards the end it seems to be off by half second to a second.
,XWinderI,2012-03-23T12:52Z,"Thanks for the upload manOtor :D 
ps. Even if the first episode DOES contain a few Kablam stuff in it, it's not a problem. Considering that you ripped and provided the season for free, I suppose you have the right to put whatever you want in it. Thanks again xD"
,Ololoec,2012-04-29T14:03Z,Seeds pls.
