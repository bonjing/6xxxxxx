                               The Complete Season 4


Chuck and Morgan search around the world looking for Chuck's mother, Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (Linda Hamilton). After being unable to secure job outside of the government, Chuck rejoins the CIA without Ellie's knowledge.
Chuck and Sarah continue to have communication issues, and Chuck's search for his mother entangles him in a fight with Russian international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff (Timothy Dalton) and his far-reaching organization Volkoff Industries, whom she was assigned to infiltrate 20 years earlier.
Sarah tells Chuck that she is going undercover as a double agent to bring down Volkoff Industries and bring back Mary Bartowski. Sarah works undercover in Volkoff for a few weeks until Chuck devises a plan to take Volkoff down. With the arrest of Volkoff, the family rushes to the hospital where Ellie is in labor.
Clara Woodcomb is born as Chuck proposes to Sarah and she says yes. Following Volkoff's arrest Chuck and Sarah are sent to find Volkoff's successor, whom is later discovered to be his daughter, Vivian Volkoff.
