,galatiqua,2011-05-18T10:07Z,"Thanks 20-40. Brilliant quality. Didn't expect such good quality in 500MB. A/V: 10/10.
Keep up the good work."
,theaetetus,2011-05-21T08:08Z,"twentyforty: Why did you cut off the credits in the middle of a great song? Not making a rip of the whole movie, but breaking off part way into the end credits, is the most annoying thing about your encodes. It shows disrespect for the film. Usually I don't mind so much, but in this case, I really do.

But thanks for this up. This is a wonderful film, and without this rip, I might not have learned about it."
,praveenbhaijee,2011-05-21T23:06Z,Thanks Mate. A pleasure as always.
