12uel, why not buy it if you liked this rip (not done by me), it's nice to have the actual CD's of your favorate artists and bands. I also have their previous albums in Vinyl, Cassette and 8-Track tape (lol 8-Track) but for this album i only have this copy that i just found and posted here so far ~.~"
