,heyman123,2011-05-17T00:14Z,"It is region free, says on their website. Just so everyone knows."
,dreileon,2011-05-17T03:29Z,"@nooralmadi008 
Use imageburn to burn the file. Buy a DVD that is DL(Dual Layer) or 8.5 gb DVD. You need to Buy 3 cause this is a 3 disc game. Burn the DVD 1 first, then follow 2 and 3. "
,nooralmadi008,2011-05-17T08:18Z,@dreileon ok thank u man thanks for help
,nooralmadi008,2011-05-17T15:08Z,@dreileon can you explain what i will choose in the burnimage because i have burn the first DVD and how i will follow the 2 and 3 DVD inside the same DVD
,dreileon,2011-05-17T15:26Z,"@nooralmadi008 
Choose burn image file. Cause most of these uploaded xbox 360 games has this icon of imageburn. It's just as simple as that. "

,alex22408,2011-05-18T02:18Z,"can anyone please confirm if it works?
thankss"
,d15a5t3r,2011-05-18T03:29Z,Everyone needs to understand ABGX will not confirm the file until the game is fully released. While the game has started shipping only those who pre-ordered have a disk and hopefully an ABGX goon will have one to verify this ISO against. It takes time to verify every nook and cranny of a video game disk to ensure complete accuracy and no faults ending in bans.
,darklordz,2011-05-18T04:17Z,Use the same fix you used on DVD2 (LANOIRD2VideoFix). It works fine! Already done it.
,elturbo9077,2011-05-18T04:26Z,its would be nice if rockstar release this game for pc becuase this game seems very cool but sadly only for ps3 and 360

The Video + V0 CRC's don't match on the first pass through ABGX but ABGX will fix this at the end of the first pass. The above is the report for the second pass. Make sure that you have the Wave 11 image in your ABGX StealthFiles folder and that your XBox has the latest 12625 dash update along with the latest LT firmware for your drive!"
