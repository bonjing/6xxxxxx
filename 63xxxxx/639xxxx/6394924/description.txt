Chirpy is a 2001 animated short by director John Goras, winner of Best Animation at the 2002 New York Underground Film Festival.

After showings in Germany and the UK, Chirpy was banned in London by ruling of the Westminster Council in 2002.

Described by the director as his statement on modern pornography, the film follows the misadventures of a small yellow bird, which include the adult themes of hallucinogenic drugs and sexual intercourse.

Animator Bill Plympton has described the film as "one of the sickest animated films ever made".
