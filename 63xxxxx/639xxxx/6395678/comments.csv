,krist420,2011-05-16T03:03Z,"thx, by the way this is missing episode 19 'seahorse seashell party'"
,wullie7362,2011-05-16T03:05Z,episode 18 is not in here.
,wullie7362,2011-05-16T03:06Z,It's a trap is actually episode 21
[T],FaMoUz,2011-05-16T03:55Z,"@wullie7362 episode 18 is actually episode 17.. i renamed it episode 17.. n that episode is in this torrent.. n i renamed its a trap bkuz in the link below says that its a trap is the season 9 finale.. so that would make it episode 18


both of these links say there r 18 episodes in season 9 n it says the season finale is may 22nd

plz correct me if im wrong"
,oversoul53,2011-05-16T07:39Z,"no, you got it right, ""seahorse seashell party"" was canceled.

so there is only 18 episodes, the dumbasses who have been uploading them have been numbering them wrong. 

they thought ""Road to the North Pole"" counted as 2 episodes... the fucking retards..."
,rebel7777,2011-05-16T21:59Z,"Wasn't canceled, set to air next season. And yeah, you got the full season here, don't listen to morons who try to say otherwise. Some people just can't grasp the basics of math..."

Been trying to download for ages, the download speed just keeps dropping -__-

Much appreciated."
,wullie7362,2011-05-18T15:19Z,"@ FaMoUz.

I done a little research and your absolutely spot on with your episodes.
You have the full 18 episodes, sorry for my mistake.

@oversoul53

Your right mate that's where they have been going wrong with them counting the road to the north pole as 2 episodes but that was the information that was given at the time."
,wullie7362,2011-05-18T15:36Z,"I think they just assumed ""It's a trap"" would be episode 21 because the last series had 21 episodes."
,ronin6,2011-05-22T02:02Z,"man, this is slow dl speed.  there are 48 of 373 seeders and speed is 30k - ouch! and now it is down to 12k.  i normally get 1.2mb or above so something is slowing  the speed down and this is only dl i have active. "
