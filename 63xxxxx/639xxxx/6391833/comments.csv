,ralphedison,2011-05-15T13:29Z,"I found it here using a translator...

,ralphedison,2011-05-15T13:35Z,"I think it's just the same crack as 4.18 with few modified files, I just don't know for sure."
,Crunox,2011-05-15T19:49Z,How can it not fix the bugs? you have installed the patch right? instal patch >> place crack
,OhTehNoes,2011-05-15T22:59Z,"When i used the russian crack of the 4.24 exe, it did fix the bugs, and added the new building system in the game. When i use this crack, the bugs still persist and nothing new has been added. Its sort of a bum crack, if i do say so myself."
,OhTehNoes,2011-05-15T23:09Z,"Sorry for the double post, but yes, its just the 4.18 .exe with a few modded files. For games such as this, it has to have the updated exe as well for any of the patched bugs to be fixed, so trying to use the 4.18 crack with a few modded files doesn't solve anything.. "
,Crunox,2011-05-17T21:07Z,"I see. Now that you mention it, The adressed bug are still there... Why can the russians crack it and we don't?"
,reze40,2011-05-19T16:02Z,"Hello I tried this crack and its work, but the problem is when we see in industry, energy and food section the name is in french language, do you guys have the same problem too??"
,ralphedison,2011-05-20T04:31Z,Yes those sections as well as those in the contact screen becomes French.
