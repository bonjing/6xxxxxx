Lusk - Free Mars[/b] (1997)

Free Mars is the first and only album from the heavily experimental psychedelic pop band Lusk, released in 1997 in a Digipak-style case. The case and booklet list "The Hotel Family Affair" and "Black Sea Me" together as one track, but they are separate tracks on the disc itself. Despite this minor error, the album was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Recording Package. The album features an appearance by Tool drummer Danny Carey, as well as an assortment of artists and musicians from the Los Angeles scene.

Lusk included Paul D'Amour (Feersum Ennjin, Replicants, Tool), Chris Pitman (SexTapes, Guns N' Roses, Replicants, Zaum), Greg Edwards (Autolux, Failure, Replicants) and Brad Laner.

[b]Lusk - 4-songs[/b] (unreleased EP, 2002)

01. Hate The Sun
02. The Raft
03. ** 
04. Magus

** - These mp3s came straight from Paul's site and Track 3 was not there, so it's not in this torrent either. There was a YouTube video submitted a few years ago playing short 30 second clips of all 4 songs from this EP along with titles for each, but that video has since been removed. Anyone out there know the title of track 3 and/or have a copy of it?

Replicants was a side project of Ken Andrews (Failure), Greg Edwards (Autolux, Failure), Paul D'Amour (Tool, Lusk, Feersum Ennjin), and Chris Pitman (SexTapes, Guns N' Roses, Lusk, Zaum). The band recorded one album, comprised entirely of covers of musicians such as The Cars, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, Steely Dan and Pink Floyd, among others. The album is known for pitting John Lennon's bitter slam against Paul McCartney, "How Do You Sleep?", against McCartney's more lighthearted "Silly Love Songs" within three tracks of each other.

    * Paul D'Amour - Guitar, Vocals
    * Greg Edwards - Drums
    * Chris Pitman - Keyboards, Vocals

Maynard James Keenan (Tool, Puscifer, A Perfect Circle) provided vocals on Silly Love Songs.
