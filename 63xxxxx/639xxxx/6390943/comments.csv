,jmobius,2011-05-31T01:13Z,"@ainars1239 
It works fine for everybody else. Also if you want shop investments, go buy the game other than calling the game rippers 'gays' you freaking closet fag."
,Aloever,2011-06-10T01:43Z,No matter what they do they just wont fix the multiplayer -.-
,Banzay27,2011-06-25T20:19Z,"Installed Skidrow release, installed this, used the DLC unlocker from another torrent here - which includes v1.01 and a savegame, both of which I didn't use - and so far, so good.
I have access to the extra outfits the DLC unlocker, well, unlocks. Dunno about the Da Vinci Disappearance side quest itself, I'm early into the campaign yet, but if the outfits are unlocked, so should it be."
,XHaloX,2011-07-13T14:36Z,"I beat the game 3 times using Skidrow release, then before couple of days i bought it from steam for 19$ special offer which is a very good deal because this game worth buying.

So guys if you want to play multiplayer and you enjoyed the game, just buy it.

*Support the companies, which software you actually enjoy*

The multiplayer is really fun. just keep watching steam for offers.

P.S: you dont have to download the game from steam, just copy the installed skidrow release to steamapps\common\assassins creed brotherhood and click on download on steam, it will verify the files and within minutes you are ready to go."

,streetbum149,2011-08-25T13:09Z,"i agree with XhaloX, instead of whining about it not having multiplayer GO BUY THE FUCKIN GAME! if you want it so bad than 50 bucks shouldn't be that bad of an investment. ive argued over this shit hundreds of times, cracks and ripped games exist so people wont have to pay 50-60 bucks for software that's absolute crap. and so (hopefully) developers will lower there price standards and software will be much more buyer-appropriate someday. even for a good game 50-60 is WAY to high. especially with the economy being so far up the shit hole. so, with cracks i can play games B4 i buy them and see what is more worth my money. people will buy the good games regardless of weather or not cracked games exist just to get multiplay."
,streetbum149,2011-08-25T13:20Z,"also-banzay27 is correct, that dlc update comes with both the dlc and a savegame with 100% completion. still good to go through the story first, but now i don't have to get all those damn flags and other BS to get 100&. "
,marl10796,2011-10-01T16:51Z,"is the Da Vinci Disappearance is accessible here??
