Ultra rare interview [It was only broadcast once back in 1986 on the BBC's Grandstand sports show] with Iron Mike Tyson by Harry Carpenter,the BBC's Boxing broadcaster.
They discuss the greatest Heavyweights of the 20th century,together with archive footage of their best fights.
This is a really superb piece of broadcasting with fascinating insight from both Tyson & Carpenter.
Please note that this was originally recorded to home VHS tape so the quality is poor by today's standards but given the rarity & top quality content I've decided to put it out there as it will be a nice addition to any Tyson fan's collection or fan of the great Heavyweights of times past.
Running time is 49 minutes.
Please enjoy & seed.
