"After Hours"

Thirteen's ex-con friend, Darrien 
(guest star Amy Landecker), arrives 
at Thirteen's apartment unannounced 
and in need of urgent medical 
attention. When she finds out that 
her friend has relapsed into drug 
use, Thirteen promises not to take 
her to the hospital where the cops 
could find her and instead turns to 
Chase in desperation. Meanwhile, 
House deals with devastating 
information, and Taub begins to come 
to terms with surprising news.

Enjoy :)
