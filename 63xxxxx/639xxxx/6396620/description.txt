ASTRAL WEEKS is about the magic of improvisation, the suspended thrill of playing (and listening) on the cusp of discovery. In that way, the album is a perfect marriage of music and lyrics, as Van bends and twists the language in an effort to TRANSCEND the earthly significance of his words, to conjure a piece of heaven out of the frustration and pain that wracks his existence. Van fuses gospel and blues, the sacred and the profane. ASTRAL WEEKS is not a jazz album, but it certainly brandishes a jazz mentality: the triumph of feel over form, emotional release over craftsmanship. If you're searching for a true musical journey, in the truest sense of the word, then ASTRAL WEEKS is the apogee.
