Plot:
-----
Ex-cop Jack (David Bradley) receives an emergency call for help from his brother Philip (Todd Jensen) to the Caribic island of St. Keith, where a rich mad scientist (John Rhys-Davies) is taking men and transforming them into cyborgs, and selling them as killer machines.

Unknown to the cop, the mad scientist has put his brother under an operation, changing Philip's chest, abdominals and right arm into steel, transforming Philip into another of his killer machines.

The film has two sequels, Cyborg Cop II and III. The last was released as Terminal Impact in 1995.

Critical reception
------------------
Critical reception was generally, although not universally, poor. Halliwells Film Guide, for example, described it as a dim standard robot action fodder with a  violent, clichÃ©-ridden plot. Disagreeing with this assessment, M J Simpson, staff writer for SFX, described the film as one of the all-time great straight to video action flicks.
