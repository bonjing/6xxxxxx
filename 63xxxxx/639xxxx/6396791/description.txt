PLOT:

Tori and Jade compete with each other for the lead role in a play "Steamboat Suzy" (a parody of "Steamboat Willie") and is won by Tori. But when Robbie is rushed to the hospital, Tori jeopardizes her role to give him blood. Jade makes relentless attempts to keep Tori from showing up for the play, and Tori ends up giving up three pints of blood. Tori finally shows up for the play but is extremely faint due to the blood donation, but luckily Sikowitz fills in for the part. Meanwhile, Trina practices her hacking and coughing for the role of a sick girl in the play, but ends up getting tuberculosis after going with Tori to the hospital.
