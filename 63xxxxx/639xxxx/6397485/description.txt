"500 Keys"

When the Simpsons discover a collection of 
keys to every door in Springfield, Lisa 
stumbles upon an eerie hidden classroom 
beneath Springfield Elementary School. When 
she shares her discovery with Principal 
Skinner, the secret room mysteriously 
disappears and he takes the only key away. 
A determined Lisa uses her detective skills 
to lead her back to the room to solve an 
old school mystery.

Enjoy :)
