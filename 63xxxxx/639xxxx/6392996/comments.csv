[V],Chris-Aksel,2011-05-15T19:25Z,"@stickasaurus

This is because your antivirus already blocked the files in the .ISO file wich are in crack folder called ""paul.dll"" the antivirus blocked it and the torrent can't finish download. So what you can do is , turn off your antivirus & firewall , finish the download , mount and install. then re-enable your security stuff."
,stickasaurus,2011-05-15T19:50Z,@Chris-Aksel I disabled my anti virus and firewall and it's still the same. 
,takeda554,2011-05-15T19:54Z,great now i get a error saying something about windows installer during the instalation heeeelllpppp

,shauwy,2011-05-17T23:25Z,I said nothing ^ ^ crack works perfectly thank you very much;)
,corntan,2011-05-18T12:07Z,I did everything as per the instructions yet i still get the securom message... Is it because of not adding paul.dll to the exclusion list of the antivirus program? I'm using corporate McAfee enterprise antivirus. 
,Lerianis2,2011-05-18T15:42Z,"Crack doesn't work on Windows 64-bit systems. I've inserted Paul.dll in the C:\Windows\System32 directories and the SysWOW64 directory in the Windows directory.... neither works.

The crack might work on 32-bit Windows systems, not on 64-bit systems.

If I am doing something wrong, I apologize... please tell me what I am doing wrong, because this was supposed to be a simple cut & paste crack."
,Rotfuchs,2011-05-18T18:40Z,"hi guys. i mounted the game and installed it, but everytime at 100%, it says that something is wrong and cancels the installation. the first time it says that i need the dxsetup.dll, so i downloaded it. but now it still says that something is wrong with a windows-programm, but doesnt give me a name. i think that the directx9c installation doesnt work, but i should have it allready anyway. any solutions? "
,RedSoundman,2011-05-19T02:08Z,"This works perfectly on Windows 7 64bit. (2500K, 8GB RAM, HD6850). 
I followed the directions and have had no problems at all. Almost finished with the game, only three levels of Stranger Tides left.
Install, copy the two files into where your game is installed (c:Program Files (x86)/Disney Interactive Studios/LEGO Pirates) and play!"

,Goduxita,2011-06-03T12:05Z,"Everything works great, good crack, but there are some mistakes and I can't pass levels.
1. In ""At the world's end"", 4th chapter - The Brethren court, when you go to help that pale guy with some make-up there is a wheel and when I try to spin it everything works, but I just can't get the thing out of it [ WTF I'VE JUST WRITTEN ]. I've tried in many ways, but there's some kind of mistake, because that thing in the wheel is very bouncy.  
2. In ""On the stranger tides"", chapter 1 - London town when you start walking on the carriages, on the final one, with coal there appear two targets and you have to hit them with some coal, you pick up one peace of coal and throw it into the target succesfully, but when you pick up another peace of coal it isn't in you hand, then you pick another, and another, but nothing happens and target lefts unshoot, and I can't pass that fucking level.
3. This one is not very important, but when you're walking in the port and you try to turn to other character you at first turn into a dog.
Sorry for shitty English. "
,Goduxita,2011-06-03T12:08Z,"Edit: 2. In ""On the stranger tides"", chapter 1 - London town when you start walking on the carriages, on the final one, with coal there appear two targets and you have to hit them with some coal, you pick up one peace of coal and throw it into the target succesfully, but when you pick up another peace of coal it isn't in you hand { LIKE YOU DIDN'T PICK UP ANYTHING }, then you pick another, and another, but nothing happens, YOU RAN OUT OF THE COAL and target lefts unshoot, and I can't pass that fucking level.

I hope you understood this shit."
