Tuesdays With Morrie - Mitch Albom-viny

It s been ten years since Mitch Albom first shared the wisdom of Morrie Schwartz with the world. Now twelve million copies later in a new foreword, Mitch Albom reflects again on the meaning of Morrie s life lessons and the gentle, irrevocable impact of their Tuesday sessions all those years ago...

"Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it.

For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.

Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?
