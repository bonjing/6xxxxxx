In the Court of the Crimson King is the 1969 debut album by the British progressive rock group King Crimson. The album reached #5 on the British charts, and is certified gold in the United States.[2]

The album is generally viewed as one of the strongest of the progressive rock genre, where King Crimson largely stripped away the blues-based foundations of rock music and mixed together jazz and Classical symphonic elements. In his 1997 book Rocking the Classics, critic and musicologist Edward Macan notes that In the Court of the Crimson King \"may be the most influential progressive rock album ever released\".[3] The Who\'s Pete Townshend was quoted as calling the album \"an uncanny masterpiece\".[4] In the Q & Mojo Classic Special Edition Pink Floyd & The Story of Prog Rock, the album came #4 in its list of \"40 Cosmic Rock Albums\".[5] The album was named as one of Classic Rock magazine\'s \"50 Albums That Built Prog Rock\".[6]
