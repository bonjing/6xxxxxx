=============================

The X-Men anime is written by famed English comic book writer/creator Warren Ellis, 
and borrows story elements from famed Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrisonâ€™s early 2000s 
story arch for New X-Men, as well as Joss Whedonâ€™s mid-2000s run on Astonishing X-Men.
-----------------------------

For those who donâ€™t like anime, youâ€™ll be pleased to hear that this X-Men anime series 
(unlike the Wolverine anime) seems to be staying fairly true to the source material. 
Cyclops, Professor X, Beast, Storm and Wolverine all pretty much look like 
recognizable versions of themselves -- albeit â€œanimetedâ€ -- which, if you think about it, 
isnâ€™t too far from what a lot of American superhero cartoons are doing today 
(see: Wolverine and the X-Men).

06  "Conflict - Contested"  May 6, 2011
--- "Conflict - Gekisen" (Conflict-æ¿€æˆ¦) [/B]
 
As the X-Men arrive back in Tohoku, Hisako's parents inform them of strange things that happened whilst they were away. 
As Beast administers the vaccine to various mutants, some of which have already started going through secondary mutation, 
the other X-Men investigate the abnormalities, including a strange volcanic area by the river and a twisted metal bridge. 
As the Xmen fly towards the centre of the area in which mutants have been affected by secondary mutation, 
Emma starts hearing a painful noise and the Blackbird is shot down. Upon landing, the X-Men witness the Blackbird being 
attacked by living snow before they are attacked by another U-Man, who uses their powers against them. 
However, Beast manages to find its weakpoint, allowing the others to defeat him. They spot he has a mutant detection 
device before he self-destructs himself. As a snowstorm kicks in, the X-Men finds shelter in a lodge owned by Yui Sasaki, 
the woman Xavier mentioned, who was the headmaster of a mutant institute Hisako went to when she was little.
