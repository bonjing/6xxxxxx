Hugh Laurie visits New Orleans to explore the roots of the sounds that have inspired his lifelong passion for music, in particular jazz and blues. Cameras follow Hugh's personal journey as he discovers a new and authentic interpretation of some of the great songs which have shaped generations of musicians and defined so much of American culture. Taking a close look at the city of New Orleans, the film captures behind the scenes moments as Hugh prepares to record his own versions of blues and jazz songs. There is also a special concert in Latrobes in the city's French Quarter, where for one night only Hugh and his band perform alongside contemporary legends like Allen Toussaint, Tom Jones and Irma Thomas.
