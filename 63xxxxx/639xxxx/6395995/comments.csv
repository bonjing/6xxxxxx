Come'on people stop being bloody selfish, only 2 seeds and a swarm speed of only 1MB thats pathetic!!"
,euphoria4949,2011-05-16T16:51Z,"I think 80% is being conservative sceneline, it's probably more than 90%! :-( (Of course I wasn't blaming you sceneline it's not your fault.)

People you only ruin it for yourselves, soon enough people are going to get pissed off with having no seeds and getting stupidly slow download speeds that fewer and fewer people will seed as they start thinking ""well if no one else can be bothered to seed neither can I!"" 
Then thats it,....... no seeds = NO MORE PIRATE BAY!!
And its the same if not worse on all the other p2p sites.

It doesn't cost you anything to seed for a couple of hours, upload at least what you have taken!

Thanks sceneline perfect as always :)"
,olealex14,2011-05-16T17:50Z,I can't get the zip-files to extract. I only get the message that the archived file is corrupted. Am I doing somthing wrong?
,euphoria4949,2011-05-17T04:38Z,Yes probably because over 300 other people have DL'ed it and no one else has reported a problem. Try using WinRAR to extract if your haven't tried it already.
