But suddenly i can´t download any of the latest episodes of chuck, smallville and hellcats from EZTV and before i could download EZTV´s things under 10 minutes, what can have happened? And i´v tried by installing bit-torrent, and installing Utorrent again, but nothing works! Pleas help! I´m starting to panic :P"
