I just ripped the .vob files off the disk, you can use practically anything from WMP to VLC, it has Xvid codec, I don't own a PS3 but it works on the 360."
,RetroidPrime91,2011-05-30T18:24Z,"nevermind, it does work on the PS3"
,frm42,2011-05-30T23:33Z,"A dvd rip is when someone has made a copy of a dvd. This is at least in theory, many files are listed as dvd rips although it is someone having filmed the movie in a theater. The way to tell if it is a true dvd rip is.....has the movie been released to dvd!!! DVD rips are also alot higher grade."
,Monsterballz,2011-05-31T08:47Z,"@IRNMN1966 as said before, a DVD Rip is when somebody has copied the DVD onto their computer-when you download it, it's like you're watching the DVD and is generally very good quality. A lot of times, the larger the file for a DVD Rip, the higher the quality but if you're looking for an HD DVD Rip or copy of a movie, it should be in the description (720P or 1080P are common HD resolutions) of the torrent or the title of it however if you're just watching a movie on a laptop or smaller screen I suggest staying away from HD copies in order to save space and download time. 
I use GOM Player which you can download at Cnet.com I believe."
,Monsterballz,2011-05-31T08:48Z,"Also, thanks for the upload mate!"
,iTzAb3,2011-06-01T23:43Z,I downloaded it and watched it but i want to put it on a cd to watch on tv how would i do that
,iTzAb3,2011-06-01T23:43Z,I want to know how to put it on a cd to watch on my xbox or dvd
,RetroidPrime91,2011-06-03T05:43Z,"@iTzAb3  I use ConvertXtoDVD, you can find that program with the crack on here...it's the most simple program i've found so far"
,freyate,2011-06-04T05:59Z,"I watch my downloads on tv too, but I never burn them on a CD or DVD. 
I just place all of them on my External HD. It has 1.5TB so it has the room to store ALOT of movies/series/animes. (Actually the reason why I bought it)
I then have this DVD player which has a USB port. Most DVD players have them by now. 
Then I just plug in my HD to the DVD player and voila I can chose whichever movie/serie/anime I wish to watch on tv. But only if the content is in the right format and codec (.avi format, codec: xvid). DVD players have limitations =P

But I must warn you: some HD aren't accepted on some DVD players. I realised this with the External HD I use for school. "
,Keenus,2011-11-07T02:23Z,"fast download! by the comments im guessing this is a good rip, thanks dude!"
