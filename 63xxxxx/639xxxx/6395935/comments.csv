[V],polisdavid,2011-05-22T04:46Z,"Why do you upload files like this - didn't you install it first to see if it's working? If so, why not just put everything in a .dmg and zip it into one file?

I also, could get the keygen to work."
,Crimson_Stigmata,2011-05-26T00:54Z,Actually it does work. Only use the one that is in the .dmg file.
,babycribber,2011-06-01T23:09Z,"Worked great and it's awesome program that I had a little tinkering to do.You have to use the ""Purchase by Phone"" option. I got it mixed up then read the core.info and it all made sense with the instructions then. Great download, will be seeding this one!"
,Visionary4Sight,2011-06-21T05:24Z,Anyone know of this in a PC version? Wish I could use this one. :(
,pa701tw,2011-07-03T21:59Z,Installation code(XD3Ietc) from Painter is declared invalid by Core's keygen? I've tried variations but can't figure out the problem.
,lovkat,2011-07-05T21:51Z,You should choose Activate by Phone ... follow the steps and voilรก! :) It works.
,pa701tw,2011-07-10T21:44Z,"The instructions are fine, the problem is that the installation code provided in the ""purchase by phone"" page is not accepted by the keygen. Other codes in the same format can be activated, but the code needed (from corel painter) is 'invalid'. "
