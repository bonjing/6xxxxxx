Release Notes:

Three Trapped Tigers are set to release their debut album 'Route One Or
Die' through Blood and Biscuits on May 30th.

Three Trapped Tigers' debut album has been a long time coming. The band
made their name through some stunning love shows, mixing math-rock
rhythms, guitar pyrotechnics and screeching electronics.

A stunning live act, the London based band have already released
several EPs. Once vowing never to name their songs - preferring instead
to number them - Three Trapped Tigers dropped this schtick a long time
ago.

Focussing on actual songs, Three Trapped Tigers have broadened their
sound. Due to be released on Blood & Biscuits this May, debut album
'Route One Or Die' contains a blistering eight tracks.

Swapping numbers of genuine names, the band have confirmed tracks such
as 'Creepies', 'Noise Trade' and 'Cramm'. Ending with 'Reset' the album
is the group's most ambitious statement yet.
