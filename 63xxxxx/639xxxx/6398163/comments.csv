,00gab00ga,2011-06-05T06:16Z,"PS3 played it for 20 minutes then got all cinavia on my ass so I said fuck it,  I'll watch it with my PC connected to my 42"" screen.

Fuck you, Sony. Suck a bag of dicks.  I managed to watch your ID4 ripoff anyway. :P"
,voothai,2011-06-08T03:38Z,"This is the first h.264 video I haven't been able to play with mplayer with vdpau under linux.  totem is playing it, but it's pretty annoyingly not smooth.

mplayer is mostly saying:

[h264_vdpau @ 0x7fcae8f9d120]AVC: nal size 190982
[h264_vdpau @ 0x7fcae8f9d120]no frame!"
,voothai,2011-06-08T05:32Z,"I don't know why, but I ended up getting smooth playback with totem."
,voothai,2011-06-08T05:42Z,Video and audio: 10/10.  Flawless.  As it should be for 12 freaking gigabytes.
,blusniffer,2011-06-10T00:09Z,One of the slowest torrents i've downloaded. 12Gb running 22kb/s. I have DL 7 torrents in the time it's took me to get to 44%!   Bollox
[T],stevekasian,2011-06-10T10:10Z,"Yeah, what the hell is the deal with the speed of this thing? 8kbps? 12kbps... peaking at about 17kbps, then back down to 6kbps. This thing needs to be reseeded as a new torrent. I hate these slow-assed torrents with 2k+ peers on them. Just doesn't make any sense."
,koriuk,2011-11-02T10:03Z,I hate to sound ungreatful... or simple... but this is the third torrent for Battle Los Angeles that I have downloaded and none of them seem to work on my television. I was wondering if someone might be able to help me?
