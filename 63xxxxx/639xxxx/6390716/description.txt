1964 US remake of Kurosawa's classic Rashomon.  With an all star cast including Paul Newman as a Mexican bandido (reprising ToshirÃ´ Mifune's role as the thief in the origina), Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom, Egward G Robinson and William Sharner.  Not up the the standards set by the original (which, after all, is one of the greatest films of all time) but worth watching (but if you have not seen Rashomon, do not be turned off by this remake).  Plot: Travelers in the 1870s Southwest discuss a recent murder trial in which all the principles told differing stories about the events. Where is the truth?
