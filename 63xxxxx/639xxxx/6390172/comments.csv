,tranceaddict9,2011-05-16T04:36Z,Splitted tracks ruins it
,batchick,2011-05-16T07:31Z,"@tranceaddict9 - Who asked your opinion here......if u don't like them splitted there are other users of the bay that upload it as it is.......
split tracks really add fun as you can completly skip the tracks you don't like......

@-inspiron- : Thanks......I can understand the delay ;).....experiencing the same here......."
,erikdrol,2011-05-16T23:16Z,"Split tracks are perfect for me as my stupid phone can only fast forward at about twice the original speed.
The delay is very understandable .. it's that time of the year.
Anyway, a big thank you for the great uploads :D"
