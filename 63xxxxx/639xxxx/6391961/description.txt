Dr. Carol Rosin - A Call to Action

Carol Rosin will speak on her personal journey and how it relates to the UFO issue; personal experiences stretching from the classroom to the belly of the military industrial complex. Dr. Rosin will discuss her lifeâ€™s work leading up to an association with Wernher von Braun and other amazing people.

Carol Rosin is an award-winning educator, author, space and missile defense consultant, and was the first female corporate manager of an aerospace company, Fairchild Industries, where, among her other responsibilities, she was a spokesperson for â€œthe father of rocketry,â€ Dr. Wernher von Braun. Dr. von Braun revealed information to her about conspiracies to keep the existence of ETs secret. She has testified before both the U.S. House and Senate, and has traveled worldwide to consult with companies, organizations, governments, the intelligence community, candidates, leaders, and grass roots associations. She founded the original DC-based Institute for Security and Cooperation in Outer Space (ISC0S). Rosin is regarded to be the original political architect of the movement to stop the SDI and ASATs.

The Outer Space Security and Development Treaty of 2011 establishes a
framework and procedures to assure that space will be a neutral realm from
which all classes of weapons are banned and from which no hostile action shall
be taken toward Earth or the surrounding Cosmos.

This Treaty invites Nation States to become Signatories to this Treaty
and invites all parties, including Nation States, Indigenous Nations and Cosmic
Cultures, to commit to plan and assist in the orderly development and
implementation of a framework and procedures that will assure and verify that
space is and will remain a neutral realm from which all classes of space-based
weapons are banned in perpetuity.
