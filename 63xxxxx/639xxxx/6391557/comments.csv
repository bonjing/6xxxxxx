Some things in windows 7 ultimate won't work anymore, I prefer malwarebytes."

Notice the file that's left in the folder that cannot be deleted?  Anyway the trace is also left in the registry.

This download gets stuck on the ""Verify validity of license for signature updates"" window.  It stays there forever - and a day."
