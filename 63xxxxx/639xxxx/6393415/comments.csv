I too followed the instructions carefully but was unable to locate a user.config or config file after install. I looked in Programs as well as x86 Programs folder (Futuremark) where the program installed. Care to share where in your system you found the config file after install and subsequently launching the KG? Thank you,"
[V],Anacondaz,2011-05-17T03:28Z,"after install and closing the application
open the keygen as admin and click the disable online check 
a window will open with a folder open the folder and the next folder within that u will find that config file"
,Sorry-That-I,2011-05-18T00:07Z,"Thanks! The Installation was flawless!
Just needed to 2 extra clicks when disabling the online check..
Thank you again!"

3.Select upgrade later.[when you do that the user config file is created)

8.Generate a key from the keygen.
9.Run the Application and paste it in there .

,zBartmanz,2011-06-24T23:21Z,i have used the keygen and non of the serials are valid... wtf?? help
,pajeska94,2011-07-06T17:12Z,works perfect..tnx
,rmaddog,2011-07-08T09:13Z,"Nicely done.  I must admit it took me a minute to realize that ""running the program"" didn't simply mean clicking the ""register later"" so the main program screen comes up.  If I X'd out there, I couldn't find the user.dat file either.  It occurred to me that file would only be generated after an actual benchmark was performed.  Voila!  Merci Beaucoup!"
,Ronn96,2011-07-08T09:26Z,"07/08/2011 Program installs, is registered, and works, HOWEVER, when results are  evaluated by program , it CATCHES the INVALID KEY on PCMark7. I Tried MANY keys with Keygen, ALL come back as INVALID. MANY Thanks for uploader."
,Daman246,2011-08-01T02:44Z,Works Great Nice Torrent
,playboi14,2011-09-01T13:08Z,"Great work man, it was quick and easy and worked as expected. Saves me having to buy the product. +1!"
,austerus,2011-10-08T09:29Z,"Nowadays you will also get a prompt to update PCMark.

*Don't do that!* 

if you do, the serials generated by keygen won't work!"
,chuck90025,2012-01-16T20:14Z,"I don't know why no one would just paste their path here instead of telling people to go back to instructions over and over again.  Apparently some people can't find the ""User.config"" file for whatever reason.

My path on Win 7 is: ""C:\Documents and Settings\(My User Name)\AppData\Local\Futuremark_Corporation\PCMark7.exe_Url_ykbqclsqz21r43dyroz5poh5kywkfl01\1.0.4.0""

I hope this helps."
,zsolti_bacsi,2012-02-07T01:22Z,thx super perfect
,Madcap_,2012-02-07T10:38Z,"The keygen corrupted my config file, and made pcmark crash. I found a way around it though, for anyone else who might have the same problem this is what I did:

1. Delete the user.config file located in C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Futuremark_Corporation\PCMark7.exe_Url_ykbqclsqz21r43dyroz5poh5kywkfl01\1.0.4.0 (win7)

2. Run PCMark again, click register later etc, close the program and a new user.config will be generated. You might have to run a benchmark to get it to make a new config

3. Open the new user.config in notepad++ (or notepad)

4. Find this line:


                True


Change the value to False.

5. Underneath that, add these lines:


				False


6. Save this file, then run PCMark again. Use the serial from the keygen to upgrade.


That's all it is. Considering that's all the patch does, you could also achieve the same thing by blocking the program from the internet with a firewall."
,Madcap_,2012-02-07T10:52Z,"Ergh, super lame of thepiratebay to remove everything in pointy brackets. Kinda fucked up my post above!


Let's try that again:


1. Delete the user.config file located in C:\Users\(user)\AppData\Local\Futuremark_Corporation\PCMark7.exe_Url_ykbqclsqz21r43dyroz5poh5kywkfl01\1.0.4.0 (for win7, in earlier windows locate appdata folder by typing %appdata% in explorer address bar.)

2. Run PCMark again, click register later etc, close the program and a new user.config will be generated. You might have to run a benchmark to get it to make a new config

3. Open the new user.config in notepad++ (or notepad)

4. Find these lines:
setting name=""AutoSubmit"" serializeAs=""String""
value False /value
/setting

Change the ""value"" from True to False

5. Create a new setting key called Online, you can do this easily by copying the three lines for the autosubmit key, then paste it below, and change ""Autosubmit"" to ""Online"".

The value for this should also be false. It should look like this (except with point brackets instead of blank spaces):

            setting name=""AutoSubmit"" serializeAs=""String""
                value False /value
            /setting
			setting name=""Online"" serializeAs=""String""
				value False /value
			/setting

6. Save this file, then run PCMark again. Use the serial from the keygen to upgrade.



Again, fucking tpb deleted everything contained in pointy brackets, annoying as shit."
