dvd rip but like the rest for some reason the audio is out of sync.  However it is much better than anything else available to download on the internet, that includes pbay and minova, i would go with this one as the out of synch isnt to bad.  Thanks uploader, well player sir"

just as out of synch as the others, how can there be no copy on the net that is a quality dvd rip, it blows my mind. anyways by about the fouth movie its a secound or two out of synch, but hell, it beats paying for it right ? lol watching this rip is pretty much like hammering a fat chick, it feels good but you aint gonna bring her home to the folks or to meet your friends lol"
