::Release Info::

Release Title: BBC - Foo Fighters Live @ R1BW [MP4-AAC](oan) 2011

Encode date: UTC 2011-05-14

Storyline:


The only band to headline Big Weekend twice make a welcome return six years after
they rocked Sunderland alongside Kasabian, Chemical Bros and the Kaiser Chiefs.
Rope hit the airwaves early in the year, giving us a glimpse of what the newly
crowned Godlike Genius and his compatriots had in store for us, but Carlisle will
be the UK's first glimpse of the band on a festival stage this year.

New album Wasting Light might have been recorded in Dave Grohl's garage, but the
Foos will no doubt fine tune their festival set, ready to blast Big Weekend to
kingdom Cumbria.
