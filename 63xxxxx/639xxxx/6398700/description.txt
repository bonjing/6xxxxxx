he More than Complete DC-Now More Completerer!

Part Two

I know  I just put up the first one late on Friday. I know they are coming fast but don't worry. They should be seeded for many months to come. You will have time to get them if the history of the original MTCDC is any guideline.

What's This?
It's a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.
Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those "Pre-DC" comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some "Post DC" comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this. Here we go again.

This Second installment is: Action Comics
This comic has had many characters featured as main or backup, but obviously the most frequent and famous is Superman.

An interesting fake of Action #1 is included as the issue 1 of the main seres. It's meant to look like like a beat-up original but was faked from a reprint. The cover has been replaced by me with a scan of an undamaged reprint. Any copy of Action #1 is very valuable and no one will ever likely subject one to scanning. This is generally speaking the most expensive comic one can buy. Some copies of some others beat some copies of Action #1 but the record prices belong to Action. Not just because it is the first appearance of Superman but because it is the first true superhero story. Superheroes have had some slight influence on the comic business in the years since.
