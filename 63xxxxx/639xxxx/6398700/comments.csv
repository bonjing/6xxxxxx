[V],joshua13,2011-05-18T16:30Z,TPB is sometimes not good at seeing seeders. I did have a couple hour break on monday morning but otherwise I have had this continually seeded and now there are 3 but 2 show here. Don't worry about this one. Action comics I did a year and a half ago has 16 seeders still (it was not posted here). These are pretty popular
