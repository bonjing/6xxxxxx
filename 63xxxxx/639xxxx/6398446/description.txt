Make your ailing vocabulary go from merely good to exceptionally splendid and stupendous!
Your brain holds an impressive vocabulary of more than 20,000 words, but chances are you only use a small fraction of them. That fraction is usually filled with worn-out oldies that have lost their impact, such as interesting, good, and nice.. Now you can rejuvenate your vocabulary and rehab your verbal skills with this guide for using language to communicate more effectively in writing and speech.

Inside, you'll find more than thirty alternatives for each of the one hundred most commonly overused words in the English language. Along with a list of synonyms, each common word comes with definitions, sample sentences, witty quotes, explanations of why the word fails to communicate, and much more.
