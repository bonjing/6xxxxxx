     SUMMARY:
              She has been referred to as the King Tut of China. Fu
              Hao, the legendary warrior queen of China's first
              dynasty, was buried with treasures of bronze, jade and
              ivory, more than a hundred weapons and the remains of
              sacrificed humans. For years archeologists could only
              speculate about the people of the Shang dynasty, who
              were known for their excessive drinking and passion
              for human sacrifice - until now.
     NOTES:
              Hybrid. 24 25 and 30 so as always 30fps to minimize
              jerkiness.
