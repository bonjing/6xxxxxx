,pp_11,2011-06-18T19:41Z,why so much neg rep? Is this bad? can someone write a proper review please!
,lakers24tw,2011-07-02T13:05Z,Thanks!
,XxM24Ty,2011-07-14T22:28Z,"Thanks for the upload. But as a Johnny Cash fan, the songs listed above are NOT even close to what I consider his best. This song list has maybe 5 good songs in it, while all the rest are some of his worst.

The final hit he did ""HURT"" was a work of art, but who really wants to listen to a song which most fans believe was Johnny's way of explaining the pain and agony of his own death, which quickly followed by his wife's (June) death and next Johnny's? (Credit: Nine Inch Nails)

Thank you for the effort, but there are many far better collections that do not start out with his death-song ""HURT"" and contain much larger hits for the most part."
,XxM24Ty,2011-07-15T11:47Z,"My Bad! Song Selections not too bad!!!!

OK, I admit I downloaded this after I later recolonized more songs on this list. The song selection is not as bad as I first thought, my bad for that. I was thrilled to see ""One Piece At A Time"" about smuggling one car part out of a time out of a G.M. factory until he got enough to build a car!! This is a rare song most greatest Hits rarely include.

My only real complaint now that I have listened to this collection is that I feel it is Overly-Produced. I am an Audio Engineer, and I hear far to much EG and reverb on Johnny's voice, not to mention just a strong feeling of over-producing over all which, unlike The Beatles 2009 Remix, leaves a strong bitter taste of an un natural sound that I doubt even Johnny would of approved of. Yes, I downloaded it and just maybe it will sound better on my car speakers than on my small computer speakers. I can hear a very large difference in this remix, But I only feel it may of been too polished for true to earth natural ear fans of Johnny's work. I noticed a big remix in the highs and in Johnny's voice, which in a few cases sounded un-natural to me. However the song selection is better than I first thought. "
,XxM24Ty,2011-08-13T23:49Z,"Wow, this CD sounds AWESOME on my car stereo. Great for 320kbps. 

Is there ANY CHANCE of a FLAC VERSION? Thanks for this, my first impression was so wrong and now this is my favorite Cash's Greatest Hit's CD. I am sure all of Johnny's fans would very much appreciate being able to download this collection in FLAC.

Thanks again. :)"

,bllorx,2011-11-16T00:26Z,"LOL @ XxM24Ty... Take it to work and play it through some reference monitors (surprised you don't have your own at home!), then the real criticism can begin. ;)"
