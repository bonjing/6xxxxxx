,itomic,2011-05-16T19:19Z,Maybe they where upset becouse movie is rubbish !!

,moshster,2011-05-18T04:10Z,"There is no such thing as a Cinavia free version of this movie right now.  All formats of this movie have Cinavia protection (cinema, cam, telecine, R5, BDrip, BRrip, Bluray and DVD)  The soundtrack carries Cinavia as an audio watermark so it's impossible to remove currently."
,Eilmann,2011-05-18T13:38Z,"Perfect 10/10 quality!

I dont get it why some people say it sucks!

It was pretty epic...kinda ""goosebumpy""!"
,Delron41,2011-05-19T02:05Z,Fucking Cinavia!! You will not win you Bastards! This is the Pirate Bay! PS3'ers are out of luck on this one. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I wonder if this is a Sony thing? Those fuckers are so greedy. Puttin' spyware on their CD's and shit. I'm glad PSN got hacked. I hope it bankrupts those cocksuckers.

""How To Get Your Maxspeed (uTorrent)

You have a more efficient method? :)"
,vctrt1,2011-05-22T11:00Z,"Exactly at minute 20 I PS3 muted the ound and displayed a message ""Audio outputs temporarily muted. Do not adjust the playback, Cinavia Protected"". I use PS3 Media Server 1.21.1 and fat PS3 with latest firmware.
After doing the below I was able to watch the full movie without any issue:
1. Open file with latest MKVtoolnix (4.7).
2. Highlight Audio track then click on Extra Options tab
3. Change Compression to none. Default is blank and is to do compression. For some reason this triggers Cinavia...
4. Repeat the same for the video stream. Don't think this is needed but I did it..
5. Click Start muxing. This took around 10 minutes
6. Stream and enjoy full DTS audio"
,vctrt1,2011-05-22T11:06Z,"BTW, these are my PMS transcoding settings:
Keep DTS sudio in stream = checked
DTS/FLAC -> LPCM remux = checked
Remux when audio track is AC3 = checked
Remux DVD ISO video... = checked

I use MEncoder engine

,creek75,2011-05-23T21:11Z,"@vctrt1: PS3 bug or Sony trying to 'recognize' the film and prevent you from playing it.

Even with the subs,

A : 10

,Powerslave0,2011-05-24T00:20Z,"PS3 & CINAVIA try this:

1. Go to Sound Settings
2. Audio Settings
3. Optical Digital
4. Check all Boxes
5. Save settings
6. Go to Audio Multi Output
7. Turn on and say OK

Confirmed working from 3.10 to 3.55
Make sure your Sound System works with the options.

All you may need is the top 3 boxes checked. If you select the two Linear PCM options that aren't grayed out, it will say; ""if your device doesn't support the frequency selected the speakers may become damaged"" - Make sure your volume is low, but audible, so you can verify that you have sound."
,Delron41,2011-05-24T04:10Z,"@Powerslave0
Oh my god thank you dude! Works like a fucking charm. Cinavia free. I'm running the latest PS3 firmware (3.61) i think and it worked beautifully. You made my day dude! No more recode/transcode bullshit necessary. I'm running PS3 HDMI straight to my Sony Bravia 40"". No Optical lead necessary. Though you must recode DTS to AC3 for it to work on PS3 of course, but Cinavia is dead. THank you, thank you, thank you!"
,Delron41,2011-05-24T04:25Z,Update. This was working with Windows Media Player serving. Now its not. Tried it with PS3 MS and it didn't work. Back to square one. Fuck.
,Delron41,2011-05-24T04:38Z,"Yep. Tried the same method through HDMI and Optical outs, and it cuts both. Gonna try vctrt1's method. Weird, worked at 20 min. mark fine.???"

,SoundBarber,2011-05-25T04:58Z,"After reading some comments I'm not sure what to say. MKV2vob didn't mux the file at first but, after re-muxing through MKVtoolnix 4.7 it converted to PS3 mp4 (DTS to AC3 with the 'Always transcode DTS' checked). Burned to disc. I had already changed the PS3 sound settings from a pevious cold boot. It played fine. No Cinavia interference. So did ""Salt"" and ""The Social Network"" (which was already mp4 encoded) . PS3 is connected HDMI to a Sony Bravia."

Download MKVtoolnix 4.1.1 (for some reasons latest version doesnt work anymore at me) from http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix/old-versions#download or select the version from history.
Drag and drop the movie to MKVtoolnix(mkv merge GUI) , select to highlight the A_DTS , then down from those 3 tabs select  Extra Options . 
Let the Cues to Default and select Compression to None .
Click Start Muxing and wait to process raw video :)

,blusniffer,2011-06-09T23:35Z,"@soundbarber i dunno why it plays on your ps3 when everyone else gets the audio block. Maybe your firmware is out of date.
Also it's an audio watermark and no muxing, changing can erase it as it's in the BD player and movie audio."

,m4ch4r105,2011-08-03T20:05Z,"to anyone who has trouble playing this movie on the PlayStation 3... here is a workaround for the CINIVIA protection without having to download PS3 media server:

go to
1. settings
2. date and time settings
3. date and time
4. set manually
5. move up one year (if it's 2011, change it to 2012). this will give you another 20 minutes, so you'll have to do this about five times to watch this movie with audio... "
,Bellygrevios,2011-08-05T10:09Z,"to everyone out there with the extreme lag problems cuz u can't live without 1080p on your ps3 do this: 
upload movie to media server 
on ps3 triangle click on the movie and select copy.
your problem was your router or computer isn't strong enough to stream the data wirelessly so it started to transmit part of the video. just download it and your problem is gone."
,Ihatetpblogin,2011-08-14T02:51Z,"If you have a DTS compatible receiver, you can bypass Cinavia protection with PS3 Media Server, by enabling ""Keep DTS in stream""

This will send 2.0 channel Linear PCM to your receiver.  As the PS3 does not process the 2.0 Linear PCM, and only hands it off to your receiver, the Cinavia protection is not recognized, and no error willl appear.

This will work with any version of PS3 Media Server, and movies with DTS audio tracks.

No need to download specific PS3 media server versions, mess with date/time settings, or try the 'multi out' trick that doesn't even work anymore since the last few firmware updates.

Just be running any version of PS3 media server, and enable ""Keep DTS in stream"".  Your DTS capable amp will do the rest, and you can enjoy your movie, all the way thru."
,5amjr,2011-09-06T13:56Z,"Another cinavia theory wrong, i copied it from the ps3 server while steaming, put the disc in my ps3 and copied from there, both got cinavia loss of audio.
Regardless of the way u copy your still using a pirate file as the source and it will give the cinavia error/shutdown everytime!!!!"
