YOU ARE A SAINT. THANKS."
,MrFurious,2011-05-16T22:48Z,"Well I've got it and it sounds good but at the start is seems maybe 0.5 seconds is cut off. It seems to start really suddenly. Not sure if that's your fault or if it's the actual song.

10/10 though"
,luc-willems,2011-05-16T23:00Z,"Good quality, thanks!"
,luc-willems,2011-05-16T23:01Z,@MrFurious It's the actual song
,MrFurious,2011-05-16T23:04Z,"Okay, it was the actual song. This torrent is very good. You might need to change the album cover to something clearer and square (personal preference.)"
,MrFurious,2011-05-16T23:11Z,Here's a clearer version of the album cover (even though it's still quite small.) Will seed for a few hours. Last post now I promise :')
,SYNAESTHE5IA,2011-05-17T00:30Z,I've been checking TPB on and off all day for this! Thanks a lot.
