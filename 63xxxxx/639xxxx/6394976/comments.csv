Here are all of Egg's official CDs in one torrent. We've got the Arzachel Collector's Edition and The Metronomical Society released on the band's own label. Then we have the three Egg albums â Egg, The Polite Force, The Civil Surface â as remasterd by Paschal Byrne for Ecclectic Discs, or Esoteric Recordings, if you prefer the new name. The complete discography is here."
