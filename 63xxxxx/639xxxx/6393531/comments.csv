Tags couldve included. Modded, game, xbox, 360, xbox360, abgx, region free, etc etc. Other than that, looks great. Your learning a lot. I need to start uploading here. 

You should also check out...

Start uploading to a private site also. TPB is a public BT site, and people Leech alot. On a private site, people are more open to leaving comments, and helping out. Leeching on these ""private"" sites will get you banned. HEHE. "
