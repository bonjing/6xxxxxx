,kurn1207,2011-06-29T13:58Z,"Thanks a lot for these, really digging the smaller file size. As for quality they are pretty much perfect A 10 V 9. The reason these uploads dont look as good as his series 22 is these episodes were made 17 years ago using pencils and paper and have not been digitally remastered!"
