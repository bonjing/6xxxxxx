Story :

Taken from events of 1965, when a big market robbery occurred in Ayutthaya province. White Tiger, a notorious robber, teamed-up with two gangs, totaling 17 robbers, to carry out his plan. While one team broke into a gold store, another heavily armed gang surrounded the police station to block the officersâ€™ exits. Tiger Lamai betrayed White Tiger by stealing "his" gold, although Inspector Bhichit suspected White Tiger and threatened him and his cohorts with the death penalty. Finally, the chase ended extremely with a Mexican standoff, during which White Tiger was shot and Tiger Lamai died. Inspector Bhichit can close the case, although thereâ€™re still some doubt left: did White Tiger really die? Where is the gold? And who is really behind this audacious crime?
