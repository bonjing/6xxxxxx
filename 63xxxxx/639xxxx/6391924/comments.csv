sample included.......
Note: Not Taking Requests"
[T],MitZep,2011-05-14T13:54Z,"this has been encoded at a high bitrate and has 6 channel audio...
nw i have a proposition for everyone, i can also encode a 720p at my usual bitrate and settings for all my small size downloaders or i can encode a better quality 480p version..
yu wud get more sharpness but also more blockiness in the smaller 720p and no artifacts but lesser sharpness..

so it is upto you to decide, next upload wud be the 720p or 480p of the movie as per the demand..."
,smasudi,2011-05-14T14:31Z,"do whatever u want, but keep the size under 700MB."
,ajey_94,2011-05-14T15:00Z,720p >1GiB
,ajey_94,2011-05-14T15:04Z,@mitzep..pls stick to your standard size and quality wat u were doin in d beginning
,PhoenixRG,2011-05-14T15:52Z,Guys quality matters with size.he will also encode the smaller size too :)
,jayawarden,2011-05-14T16:49Z,"Quality Matters dude.....
Don't worry about size...
Encoded 720p at a high bit-rate only...
But don't rip in 480p...

Then finally it belongs to u.....
Thanks.... Keep on ur good work...."

[T],MitZep,2011-05-14T17:27Z,"@jayawarden wats your problem, i have said im not taking request and here yu are posting complete list of movies... im not doing any of these, do not post these lists again.."
,skillet92,2011-05-14T17:29Z,"i prefer your old rips!
1100 kbps overall bit rate is the best of yours!"
,hardik_860,2011-05-14T19:27Z,"don't switch from 1000-1100 kbps to 2500 kbps......for 720p encodes...
there are so many uploader who do 2-3 gb size.-like GOku61 ,3li, RMD ,krisskingle.....
and riddlera is not here too nw.....
yaa......
if u want to icrease quality ,then increase bitrate to 1250 kbps.......it would be nice...."
,i_am_sid,2011-05-14T20:13Z,"@MitZep
Your movie configuration is unique. There is no encoder out there who keeps this config. This config looks good on 32"" LED too. If you increase the quality, bitrate increases, and so the size and there are ""lot of encoders out doing the same or nearly same configs"". 
I think your previous rips are suitable for wide range of people. So please keep your previous configuration and maintain your uniqueness. Its always difficult to download big files with restricted bandwidth.
You can keep video bitrate upto 1200 kbps max and audio is upto your choice. And im in favor of 480p for smaller movies.
You can encode bigger size movies on demand rather than smaller on demand.
Wrote a lot of suggestion coz i/we love your encodes and dont want you to change the configs any more. I wish you consider it."
,i_am_sid,2011-05-14T20:17Z,"@Hardick
This TPB time lag, got us again!!!:)
Strange, we are thinking the same. I just took long to hit the submit button."
,.xDEADx.,2011-05-15T06:53Z,PLZ stay with ur original quality
,ajey_94,2011-05-15T08:51Z,ya...PLZZZ stay with your original quality and size
,messi_10,2011-05-15T09:02Z,"I think 1000-1100 was perfect enough. 'Maybe' you could set a higher bitrate for the audio, but I think it was clear enough at your earlier settings too."
,kanha,2011-05-15T09:55Z,"@MitZep
i agree with sid....plz stay with u'r old configuration...."
,veer1989,2011-05-15T10:23Z,"Please upload in High bitrate 720p only...
I'm a secret_myth fan, now he is gone...
so i like ur kill the Irishman rip, it is very good...

Rip ur movies in this quality only..."
,X3MEX,2011-05-15T11:09Z,"for better quality and manageable size, i suggest u go with the mid range 1500-2000 bitrate , with 6ch audio AC3 .."
,ajey_94,2011-05-15T14:52Z,"@veer1989 it dosen matter if secret_myth is gone there are many other uploders who does rip in this size...nd more over this s mitzep's 1st rip above 2GiB..nd we ppl who hav limited bandwidth cant afford to lose even him after riddlera, herakler, mr.kickass, pluto999...evn goku nd other

@mitzep PLZZ continue rippin wit ur standard config nd quality...nd we r more happy with dat than this big size ones"
,veer1989,2011-05-15T17:26Z,"@ajey_94
Same as with me, my download speed is only 58 to 60 KB/s...
I know RiddlerA was very good in small quality...
I like MitZep's old rips also...
But more bitrate gives more quality that all....

But finally it belongs to MitZep to rip...."
,edukees,2011-05-18T00:44Z,Should be excelent rips between 1300kbps-1500kbps (bitrate) and audio 2.1 (not 5.1 to keeping small size)
