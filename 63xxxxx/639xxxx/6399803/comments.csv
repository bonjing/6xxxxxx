235 GB is alot to D/L!!

Huge thanks for a HUGE upload even if you aren't able to post a preview pic torrent."
,CooleRRSA,2011-05-18T15:16Z,"You can find all previews there

,CooleRRSA,2011-05-19T18:36Z,"Just look at the link of the sets. It contain number of needed set. For example > http://tour.teendreams.com/cms/set/view/set=14553:model=6536:type=P

set=14553 it means that this set is in tdreams_14553.zip"
,etaion999,2011-06-11T00:15Z," This was a great idea horribly executed. Almost a month later and I'm at about 16% on part 1, haven't even attempted parts 2 or 3 yet.

 Thanks for the thought, but I give up. Break them up into smaller chunks and try again, maybe?"
,ninth1der,2012-05-18T20:03Z,"This type of posting would be better on a news group:
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.teen
or
a.b.p.e.teendreams

And it is unwise to post such large files.
In a newsgroup you would not post the entire site rip.  Instead you would post picture sets (model a, scene 2) as a .rar, .sit or .zip.  The entire rar should be segmented into 500kB to 2MB sections, and PAR2 files posted with 10% redundancy.  Then other fans would have 1000+ days to DL the segments and PARs, rejoin and enjoy. 

I do not want to sound like I am advertising for them, but great news servers providers:
Giganews
Usenetserber
Easynews
and others

Best News Group client for Mac OSX
Thoth
Mt Newswatcher (don't know if this one is 10.7+ ready)
Hogwasher (way too pricey for what you get)
Thunderbird (but the interface is not great for binaries retrieval)

Best Newsgroup Client for Windows?

Worst Newsgroup Client
MS Outlook
Mac OSX Mail"
