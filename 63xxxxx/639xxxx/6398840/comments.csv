it has been canceled"
,kobraone,2011-05-17T18:57Z,"Glad tbh, hopefully a good finally coming. Not sure how much more they could have put into a second season anyways"
,Biscuit101,2011-05-17T21:01Z,"Great Upload, Thanks nox55!

I'm glad it's only one season. It's been good, but theres not enough in it to make anymore. I hate when they take a good idea and try and stretch it out to make more cash, eg: Lost/Heroes/US Office/The Shield."
,Morlala,2011-05-18T07:51Z,The stuff in the Event is REAL according to David Wilcock - and is financed more or les by Pentagon etc - before the REAL disclosure comming very soon - check out his site; divinecosmos.com
,geoff777,2011-05-18T14:24Z,"Pleased it's been cancelled.

Pretty dire stuff.
Only downloading in the hope the whole cast dies in the last episode ....

I hate it when Aliens look human and it's set in the present day USA ....   cheap tv."

,Bob__Dole,2011-05-24T02:25Z,"It's kind of retarded when someone is pleased a show is cancelled that they watch, unless something they like more gets put into the timeslot to replace it.

Otherwise, you were free to change the *channel* any time you liked."
