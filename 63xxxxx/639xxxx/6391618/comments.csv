Thanks for the Surfaris. 

Excellent stereo sound on this cd.

And thanks for the FLAC files.

,mr.eclectic,2011-05-17T00:47Z,"FYI: It would appear the record company screwed up; track 23 is the same as track 14(Baja). ""Blue Surf"" is in fact missing. Otherwise a great cd....excellent sound!  Many tnx!!   "
