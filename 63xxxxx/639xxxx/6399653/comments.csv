,TempDude29,2011-05-17T12:21Z,Why did wbb.exe want to modify almost every program running in the background? Including my firewall/anti-virus program?
,Ubler,2011-05-17T12:28Z,"Great speed, downloaded in 20 minutes but the install wouldn't work.

iso mounted alright but the install gets stuck on 0% as it can't extract the caches. Left it for ages and retried many times but to no avail.

Such a shame 'cause it's a fast download. Now I'm forced to download the big version that goes shit slow. -.-"
[V],extremezone,2011-05-17T12:29Z,@TempDude29 this release it's virus free if you get anything it's false positive 
[V],extremezone,2011-05-17T12:31Z,"@Ubler see install screens posted above, it's from your system (maybe it's weak and for this reason you may wait 1-2 hours to install)"
,Stabbath,2011-05-17T12:31Z,Good shit man.  Will seed to death.
,fallengun04,2011-05-17T12:32Z,"@TempDude29 

In my opinion , maybe because when there are running apps, it could slow down the process of extracting and about the antivirus / firewall maybe because of the false postive files? 

Just my opinion hope it helps :|"
,premiado,2011-05-17T12:38Z,"extremezone,

are you able to get for us the launch day dlc ""troll trouble""?"
,SoundofSolace,2011-05-17T12:44Z,"@TempDude29 Don't take this as your answer but I am pretty sure this is a rip from the official game itself. I can't really say the answer for modifying your firewall/anti-virus but I would believe its so the anti-virus or firewall doesn't block or quarantine your game, and Idk if the removal of the DRM has anything to do with that - most games you need the CD or an activation code to play...I would ask almighty Extremezone cause he probably knows just trying to help. Like I said don't take these as your answers don't know much about it - just assumptions."

It was my comodo firewall/anti-virus that alerted that ""wbb.exe is trying to modify user interface for program (etc etc)"". It also included firefox, my iType software, ATI catalyst manager and so on.

Although I blocked the requests at the time, the game seems to work perfectly. Guess I'm a little paranoid. The last time I hit a virus from a torrent my master boot record was deleted/destroyed so I'm very careful with what I allow. :)"

Afaik there are about 750 seeders and 3100 leechers (dht/pex) so until the seeder number is higher then the leecher you will not get a high speed download, and half an hour ain't much, the first torrent I took got an avg @ 6.8Kbs during the 3 hours I had it up."
,premiado,2011-05-17T14:59Z,"@thebomb5,

in fact you have wasted your time. the 13.9G PL/EN version do work. Install game, once finished, a pop out will ask you to enter serial code, press accept and the patcher will start downloading. Once everything is done, just go to configurator, change the language from PL to EN and replace the paul.dll in Bin folder from Skidrow.  You dun need to use the Patcher_EIFG thingy."

,Blood_Monkey,2011-05-19T15:39Z,"ok 
the game is working without problems.
the key to install correctly is to WAIT , because it takes time to unpack then install , so it will take from 30 min to 1hour , 
to make sure that the install is running smoothly , keep an eye on the black_box folder size in your program files , you'll see that it's gradually increasing in size , also you need more than 13GB of space to unpack , so prepare like 20 gigs or something.
-remember , be patient "

then replace the paul.dll file in your bin folder with the one you just downloaded.

If you run the exe from the bin folder, for me the game started with no problems, and was at default settings...the gamepad is a bit sticky, but I'm working on it.  The game is 13.3 G..not including the 6.3 G of setup files.

Unfortunately, I can't seem to get high settings running smoothly, oh well it still looks pretty damn good on medium.  Thanks a lot for this, after buying La Noire and Dirt 3 for next week...well I still feel bad..but I will purchase a copy of this game (physical copy) soon."

Do you really think someone who has finished downloading and deleted the torrent will actually come back to this page, read your comment, and decide ""Oh heck, Leinhart wants me to seed so I'll readd the torrent and seed!""

NO! NO NO NO. Half of the comments for every new torrent is always ""WAHH WAHH SEEED SEED SEED""

The problem is there are 5000 leechers to 1000 seeders. This is because the torrent is NEW. Either wait till the ratio evens out (a few weeks) or shut up and download.

Also I can't bid some custom keys and the game is very picky in specs."
,Cogollito,2011-05-21T19:03Z,"@kolokythis

The Witcher (the first) had the same black bars, they've done that to give us the feeling of seeing a movie. And it is not a port, quite the opposite, it was programmed and made for PC, they will make it for consoles after a while."

i encountered this error and found a way:
the way of fixing this problem is almost idiotically simple.
basically you CAN'T type the install path using keyboard - you HAVE TO click your way through folders to select desired location. i tried several times using keyboard switching lower-case and upper-case to match my folder names (even tho it shouldnt be case sensitive) and even after selecting folder by mouse/browse button and erasing one character just to type it in again the same way by keyboard i got this error. that led me to only one conclusion - no keyboard typing, mouse clicks only lol...and poof, no ISDone.dll error!

1. create a folder on your hard drive where you want to install the game (before setup)
2. During setup, manually browse for the folder you created (Dont just write path with keyboard)
3. Remove ""MyProg"" path/folder that the setup automaticcaly creates somehow and NEXT..

the setup should continue..

After that, the game will start but in window mode! i have checked the settings and i did turn the window mode off.

,dothackjhe,2011-05-29T04:06Z,Just finished downloading and installing the game. Extraction / installation may take some time even at around 0.0% depending on the PC's hardware I think. Apparently the game requires a beefy computer for it to run smooth even at low setting. The game is most likely ripped thus can't be patched.

it can be patched mate just look at gani.slimshady comment in page 14 he figured out"

2.Extract your setup using win rar...

3.Make sure you have 20 GB free HDD in your pc....

4.Run the setup,Dont worry if it is freeze time in 0.0% give him some time to start the procedure.

5.when it reaches at 70.0% its give the same error dont press okei first copy all the files to another folder which have been extracted during installation.

6.After copying the files Press ok.

7.Now extract All 3 bin files with FREEARC In the same folder That you copied Last time.

8.Extrating may take time but you have to wait for it.

9.After extracting All the Bin Files The game is Ready to Roll..

There is no activation code. When asked for, just close. 

Btw I figuered out what the problem from my last post was. Apperently i ran the game with low graphics, as soon as I switched to high the game started working perfect. Incase someone had the same problem, you can´t do this while in the game, instead change in the launcher."

,vrocks94,2011-06-03T21:11Z,"hi guys this is in response to the message by  ""oCoreCyan"" . 

i also know that the patches are meant for the betterment of the game(like fixing bugs etc.) but this game has not even a single bug , the game runs flawlessly and on top of that if you patch the game then the game might not run properly cuz it has not an original installer , this is merely a kind of repack.


 If u still wanna patch it then after downloading the patch you just have to double click on the patch and then it would ask u the about location and then u will have to enter the location where u have installed the game and then install it.

my advise to u is not to patch it cuz the game lacks nothing not even a single cutscene............everything's fine 

the game only show problems when your system does not  matches the minimum requirements of the game otherwise it is running smoothly. "

I expect to have those features, also you say the game may not run properly if i install the patch well i already have the 1.1 patch which someone gave instructions on how to do so on page 14. Since posting my 1st comment i have no installed the 1.2 patch but not sure if its safe asin maybe the people who created the witcher can find out i have a illegal copy and maybe do something about it?

,svetkopetko5,2011-06-05T03:36Z,"@vrocks94
i agree that the boss fights are made in extremely dumb and lame way - it makes no sense.

- the kayran - you actually don't fight, you have to drop traps to get the tentacles, then do dumb console-type of moves that maybe if you are 12 you'd like it, but such moves are not related to the original gameplay in anyway.

- Letho - the dude takes no damage at first for unknown reason and at one point you pretty much kill him with 5 hits. makes no sense what-so-ever. he also hits you twice before your game has even loaded.....

it's pretty much a question of luck, not skill. zero balance.

- later in the game you get similar shit with other bosses, even bugs.. for example in the Dethmol fight you can't use group finishers (X) or he will bug and can't move forward... "
,svetkopetko5,2011-06-05T04:37Z,"I was having problems with installing patch 1.2 and posted a couple comments about it, but i found the problem:

patch 1.2 will only NOT work if you have installed any additional content, like items, skins, mutagen and skill tweaks and such.. you would have to find them all and remove them before installing the patch. it's safe to add them back in later.

i really hope there are no more patches for this game because i like modding and it's a pain to clean it up before every patch. patch 1.2 was important though - lots of bug fixes and other stuff that didn't make sense before."

Get the original witcher.exe and paul.dll from this torrent:

Copy and overwrite witcher.exe and paul.dll to their respective locations in the witcher game directory.

Download the Patcher_EFIGS from this torrent:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

This torrent contains the Patcher_EFIGS and paul.dll.  Do not copy over or do anything with the paul.dll from this torrent.  Just run Patcher_EFIGS from its torrent folder.

For English users, then download ""Patcher_1.1_International"" from the Witcher2 website.

That's it.  I did not have any mods or DLC, so I did not have to mess with the cooked directory.  Apparently, you have to delete such files before patching.

You are a piece of shit. Stop spoiling the frigging game. Why the hell would you post that? At least put ***SPOILER*** at the beginning or something.

Telling someone the end of a game IS the definition of what a spoiler is. You basically took away the climax of the game from me and anyone else who hasn't beaten the game. Considering Letho is the driving force for the whole story, it's a pretty fucking huge spoiler.

I hope that one day someone ruins a movie you have been dying to see or book or game before you get to see it. 

And you are so retarded telling someone you will ""kick their ass so badly"" online. Wow tough internet e-thug!!! You are so tough!!! I bet he is sooo scared that you are going to punch him through your computer screen. Grow the fuck up and stop ruining games for people.

1.First replace the cracked files with the original files

2. Run only Patcher_EFIGS from the skidrow crack. Dont copy paul.dll

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

3. Install the 1.1 patch from the official website named ""Patcher_1.1_International""

4. Before patching delete any DLC you might have put in the cooked PC Folder like Troll.Dzip

Its working!

I cracked it for my friend who live's next door and i'm sharing the info with all of you. . .(at least the patching) so. . . for the 1.1 patch after a FRESH INSTALL that's how I did it with my friend.
1. First replace the cracked files with the original files  https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377/The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EXE_-_SS
2. When you download and open this, just run the Patcher don't worry about anything else.
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW
3. Install and patch the 1.1 international version which you CAN get on the witchernexus.com, just type it in, in the search bar. The first time you update it will say some error and open the launcher, then close the launcher go to your CookedPC folder and take out the troll thingy. (If you don't get a error then still take out the troll thing and continue on to step 4). Then restart the 1.1 patcher with the troll thing out and it should work.
4. Then install 1.2 from the launcher when you click the icon to play the game
5. Put the troll thing back in the CookedPC folder and there you go!
Enjoy!"

I follow these instructions from OrangePillow.

STEPS : 

1. Installed the game, after it was done a window popped up. Closed it by clicking the cross in the upper right corner.

2. Started the Game/Launcher, waited till the update was finished.

3. After the update the same window from before popped up but this time I clicked accept in the bottom right corner.

4. Started the Game/Launcher to see what message I would get. An activation screen popped up in which you could insert information etc.

5. Well that's not good so then I copied the cracked paul.dll to the bin folder in the witcher 2 directory which replaced the existing one.

6. Started the Game/Launcher.  IT WORKS!!!


Note: I did not turn off my anti virus and                
         disconnect my net. No virus detected and  
         even did not install crack.

(Confirmed working on Win7 x64 Ultimate, no bugs, no errors, full playthrough, all content functional; follow instructions PRECISELY!)

1) Download this torrent (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6399653/The_Witcher_2_Assassins_of_Kings-BlackBox) and install according to listed instructions on this torrent's description page. *Do not install additional cracks or change any files at this point! *Do not install additional DLCs!

2) *this is the step most people with 1.1+ install problems fail to do*: CLOSE THE LAUNCHER! It may start automatically (and minimize itself to the system tray if you change windows) upon successful installation; you MUST CLOSE IT before continuing. *If you receive an error message to the effect of ""Failed to patch .... Launcher.exe"" while installing patch 1.1 as later instructed, YOU FORGOT THIS STEP!

3) Download the following torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6425377/The_Witcher_2_Original_Paul.dll_and_EXE_-_SS

4) Copy the 2 files in the torrent (Paul.dll and witcher2.exe) from Step #3 into your ""...\[INSTALL]\bin"" folder. OVERWRITE when prompted. "
,specterk,2011-08-03T07:19Z,"(CONTINUED)

5) Download the following torrent: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6398128/The.Witcher.2.Assassins.of.Kings_Crack_Only_-_SKIDROW

6) Run ""Patcher_EFIGS.exe"" from Step #5. ONLY run that. IGNORE all other files contained in that torrent!

7) If your Witcher 2 launcher automatically starts back up again at this point, CLOSE IT! If not, double check that it's not hiding in your system tray icons. Then, continue to step 8.

8) Download and install the official ""International Version"" (ONLY!) of the 1.1 patch from: http://www.thewitcher.com/patch/

9) After successfully installing patch 1.1, the Launcher will now autostart. Guess what? This time, you don't have to close it =)
WHEN PROMPTED to download latest version, select yes and allow the launcher to do its thing.

Patch 1.2 will automatically download and install through the Launcher. Once updated, the Launcher will auto-start once more."
,specterk,2011-08-03T07:20Z,"(CONTINUED) 

10) Now, again, close the Launcher. No caps necessary by this point, right?

I was also getting these errors as my previous post.
So I tried a couple of things, and voila.. I was able to complete the Installation and the Game is running flawlessly now.
These are the things I did :
1. Copied contents of ISO on Hard Disk in a Setup Folder.
2. Cleared the Space around 27 GB free for Setup.
3. Downloaded the new Setup.exe from the Torrent provided and pasted it in the Setup Folder.
4. Downloaded the Isdone.dll from the link provided and pasted it in the System32 Folder.
5. Closed all other applications running, even from the System Tray. (This is helpful for guys having 2GB RAM only as I do.)
6. Disabled Antivirus.
7. Started the Setup and kept on sitting patiently for around 45 minutes, but then was able to Complete the Setup without any Problem.

You will really appreciate all the patches. You can even patch it from 1.35 to 2.0 since patch 2.0 is now available.

There have been a ton of fixes. Several hundred fixes at least across all the patches. There is also tons of free DLC included in the patches, as well as added game mods, redone tutorials, etc.

Definitely worth checking out now that they have done some fixing to the game. After seeing how many fixes they've needed to make, it's really surprising they didn't just delay the game so they could have done it right from the beginning!"

Thanx a lot."

Listen you dumb fucks. When someone like extremezone uplaods a torrent and you can't figure out how to install it the first thing you should do is 1) shut the fuck up, 2) read the comments for the solution. SOMEONE has already explained it. Since so many of you are brain dead spaz mother fuckers it makes it much more difficult to find it because you are on here posting like a fucking retard forcing us all to have to go back 30 fucking pages to find the PERFECTLY explained instructions by people like spectre on PAGE 23-25. 

So..your first duty when coming onto these torrents is to waht? It's to SHUT THE FUCK UP and READ THE COMMENTS. Before you have a spaz attack and start puking out retardation in the comment section look for the fucking answer. 

As for viruses. More of you being a stupid little fuck. Extremezone, SKIDROW, etc. doens't put goddamn viruses in their torrents. They are TRUSTED uploaders that we all respect and trust for good reason. VIDEO GAME TORRENTS SPAWN FALSE POSITIVES FOR ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE. The cracks are considered to be a possible threat because it changes the fucking .exe of a legit copy of a game. 

So in summary, PLEASE SHUT THE FUCK UP and READ THE COMMENTS before your stupidity floats out of our computers and turns us into vegetables. "
