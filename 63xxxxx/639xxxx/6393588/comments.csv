2 things to note though,
- 1 this is just the torrent download of the same free software on the site;
-2 Hotspot sheild ad adverts to any pages browsed through it as said on their site 

""AnchorFree may deliver third-party advertisements (""Advertisements"") within the content of any web page accessed. Advertisements may be injected into the top of the page, inserted directly into the page content, or even displayed to overlay the page.""

Which becomes annoying therefore you are probs best getting a 'paid vpn' as well, you get what you pay for!

Cheers rickshoo for the effort though."
,growersgrass,2011-06-01T09:47Z,Ads are annoying. Here's the free VPN with no ads - www.proxpn.com

,ccglindsey,2011-08-20T02:24Z,"@growers:

Dummy. It isn't free, it is a free ""DOWNLOAD"".
the service has a monthly fee."

IP BLOCKING"" software only 'blocks' other machines from connecting to you. It 
does NOTHING to obscure your IP address, either internal or external in ANY 
WAY.
IP Blocking software simply has a big list of ""known bad"" IP's. IP's 
used by the **AA, government, spyware companies, etc, It keeps those IP's 
from making a connection to your machine.
Your ISP, on the other hand, could in theory (but doesn't bother to in 
practice) see every packet that leaves your machine. There is NO way around 
that.
If you use a secure proxy you can encrypt packets... FOR HTML WEB 
SURFING ONLY and your ISP will only see that you are requesting data from a 
proxy. However, this does NOTHING to hide your P2P activity. It ONLY works for 
web pages.
There is NO WAY to ""hide"" your IP address. Any program which 
claims to do so is simply lying to you. Period

Fact.............."
,JGNROMERO,2011-10-09T04:57Z,use ad muncher to get rid of ads

Great info! 'Spot on' mate! Unfortunately, I guess there are some who are still living in caves and believe that an ISP address can be hidden! "
