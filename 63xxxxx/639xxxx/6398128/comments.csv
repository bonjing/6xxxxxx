,dekiai,2011-05-17T07:19Z,It definitely comes up as a virus D= Only way you can find out if it works or not is to disable your antivirus program.. I'm not stupid enough to do that even if the uploader is trusted. Guess i'll have to wait for another torrent.
,Rovlad84,2011-05-17T07:58Z,"It's not a virus, it's an obfuscator (used by many scene releasers to hide their cracking techniques).

,Rovlad84,2011-05-17T13:02Z,Works fine with SKIDROW/EFIGS release.
,lukenek,2011-05-17T14:25Z,"Maza64 and for everybody that are having this type of problem:
1.Install game
2.Launch game(leave empty activation code and press ok), game will download and install patch.
3.replace paul.dll in bin folder with skidrow one.
4.Play game
4.install skidrow patch if game doesnt want to start.

PS. paul.dll can be seen as virus so your windows or antivirus can put it in quarantine, so disable security and allow that file to be used, and do not replace paul.dll before installation of patches!"

,OrangePillow,2011-05-18T02:59Z,"For the people that are wondering if it works for the ENG/PL version, yes it works. I had an error saying the game was incomplete while the update was running which made it stop everytime. 

All of a sudden it decided to not stop promptly while updating. And everything worked fine after.

My steps : 

1. Installed the game, after it was done a window popped up. Closed it by clicking the cross in the upper right corner.

2. Started the Game/Launcher, waited till the update was finished.

3. After the update the same window from before popped up but this time I clicked accept in the bottom right corner.

4. Started the Game/Launcher to see what message I would get. An activation screen popped up in which you could insert information etc.

5. Well that's not good so then I copied the cracked paul.dll to the bin folder in the witcher 2 directory which replaced the existing one.

6. Started the Game/Launcher and what do you know, it worked and my fun time could start.

This game is awesome and I'm buying it soon because they deserve it for making such a great game."
,Tigerluck,2011-05-18T05:31Z,"I will definitely buy this game, most likely the premium version too. However, due to my current financial situation I will have settle for this while I save enough money."

,AnilEranil,2011-05-18T17:19Z,"Hey people,
i have a problem.
every time i start the game, the launcher comes up.. i press launch game and then it says: use launcher to activate game. please help me

ps: i have installed the crack"
,DevilScream,2011-05-18T21:55Z,"Works with the ENG/PL.

1. Install
--------------------------------------------------------
2. DONT TOUCH ANYTHING, DONT CRACK THE GAME!!!
--------------------------------------------------------
3. Run the launcher, click 'activate' with blank field.
4. Let the launcher download patch.
5. Try to launch the game once more. If you didn't screw up you should see much bigger window with serial. Close that window and launcher.
6. Finally crack the game.
7. Run it and have fun.

WORKS PERFECTLY. If it isn't, then u must reinstall the game and repeat steps listed in the upper part of this comment. I wrote it by myself, without copy'n'paste. Also tried it myself, figured that out by myself.
Just FULLY WORKING CRACK!"
,RhymesMatter,2011-05-19T02:17Z,So the crack works and all but there is one annoying event that keeps happening everytime i open the pc....the dll thingy gets erased by my KIS2011! I know that's a false positive but it makes me recrack the game everytime i open my pc!!!You think they gonna release a more stable crack?
,fooflinger,2011-05-19T03:39Z,"how in the fuck do you grant the paul.dll admin privledges properly? 

I've torrented fucking hundreds of games and I've never had this problem...This is the most stubborn crack I've ever dealt with..."
,Rovlad84,2011-05-19T07:50Z,"Just get the SKIDROW release guys, at least you can expect them to release updates for theirs."
,DevilScream,2011-05-19T09:12Z,"OK, another advice for you, guys. Same as upper - I'm writing it on my own, so I know it's working.

PROBLEM:
-you can't even see/find the cracked paul.dll but you are sure that it has downloaded properly,
-you get an annoying error message with 'admin rights' while copying the cracked dll

SOLUTION:
Turn off the antivirus (if u can't then disactivate real time defenders/agents etc - it might require a reboot), because it has already blocked the cracked paul.dll and probably put it into quarantine...

If you get any other error messages that means you haven't cracked the game properly..."
,BruceWayneJr,2011-05-19T11:38Z,"Launch screen keeps reloading.

Got the paul dll to rar (after unmounting image) and able to place in bin (or just download a CRACK ONLY torrent).

Followed all you expert's advice, but it's mostly shit. Too many folks having this problem. I'll play the New Vegas DLC until somebody actually works this out."
,IceC0ldxXx,2011-05-19T14:47Z,"Cracking this game was easy, playing it as i type. allow Paul.dll, anti virus is blocking it. Problem solved."
,fooflinger,2011-05-19T21:27Z,"@Devilscream

I shut down all my anti virus software and continue to get the error regarding admin permissions...What do you mean end real time agents? Where can I do this?"
,Andrias,2011-05-20T02:19Z,"Going to spell this out simply for everyone, this is a V-I-R-U-S. It works if you take out/disable your anti-virus, I just learned the hard way that's a big sacrifice for getting one game to work. 

The moment you do this thing starts playing havok with your internet settings, I got rid of it by restoring to a point before i took my anti-virus out to let this thing install. 

DON'T DO IT!"

Paul.dll can't be copied, cutting and pasting however does work for me. If not, give yourself all powers (properties -> security)

Cut paste paul.dll to gamefolder/bin
and patcher to gamefolder

so i runnes launcher. It will ask for an activation key, but when you just press OK it will start patching. Afterwards you can play and everything works. Have fun."
