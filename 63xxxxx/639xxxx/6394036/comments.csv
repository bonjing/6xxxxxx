[V],DownTYU,2011-05-15T13:16Z,"@ 720pMiNiKiNgS

This will have to be the worst x264 compression.

Refference fr 2 and the encding is not even 2 pass.

And u used main profile to compress this...

Whats next baseline?

Like I said before add a sample to your uploads.

I want to download it...But ..."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-15T13:18Z,"Hey wait...

Did u use handbrake (regular>normal profile) to encode this?

OMG"
,720pMiNiKiNgS,2011-05-15T15:33Z,"never use handbrake and if u know as much as u talk u would know that useing media info would pick it up and would say handbrake under this section of info:

Writing library                  : libebml v1.2.0 + libmatroska v1.1.0"
,720pMiNiKiNgS,2011-05-15T15:47Z,"lol just read my comment back sorry didnt mean to sound off ...
i have watched this on my 42 and played fine i never expect 10/10 votes but the quality is as gd as any i have uploaded before."
,dkhere,2011-05-15T17:14Z,Can someone translate the above comments to simple english please?? :P
,720pMiNiKiNgS,2011-05-15T17:39Z,"lol DownTYU is on about encode settings and hand brake is an encoder if that helps .

any care to comment on quality."

,sadhu19,2011-05-16T15:55Z,"A-8
V-5
i am afraid to admit it but the video quality is inferior and not up to standards of a 700 MB movie. i have to re download it from YIFY...."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-16T17:45Z,"scOrp did the best rip...Sadly but YIFY's rip doesn't have enough x264 compression...
twentyforty probably did a good job but I don't like 480p vids."
[V],DownTYU,2011-05-16T17:46Z,Sadly noone uploaded the scOrp rip...
,sadhu19,2011-05-16T20:51Z,"correction V-2 instead of 5
it looks like TS not a blue ray rip. 720pMiNiKiNgS have done some fine work uploading good movies in small size but this is a disappointment. my advice avoid this torrent."
,bhai0072001,2011-05-17T16:29Z,"Thanks for this, dude are you doing Undisputed series...."
