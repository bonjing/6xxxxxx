Hi there
new version of vlc 1.2.0-git from today : May 15th :)
however impossible to let you know why no new update during many days till today.
Btw,beware : catalyst 11.5 and 11.5a hotfix seem make a problem on the latest official vlc 1.1.9.
hd acceleration seems now impossible for certain users so :/
However videolan.org have already started to investigate on it since AMD seems have confirmed this bug also...
as usual this new version of vlc 1.2.0-git still comes from nightlies builds branch section.
branch represent the latest stable beta release of the day.
Enjoy
regards
