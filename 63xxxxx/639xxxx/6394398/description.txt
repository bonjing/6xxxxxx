WiBit.Net began as a college sensation. It was a place where computer science students could post learning materials and teach each other what professors wouldnâ€™t (or couldnâ€™t). Those days are over, BUT better days lay ahead!

After a 4 year hiatus, WiBit.Net is back and better than ever. This torrent is a collection of most of the original material the guys recorded for the original website.
