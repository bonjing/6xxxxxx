Hello Guys, 
This is my 2nd upload and after a long time coz i had been sick....

Anyway this is a working version of Guitar pro 6 (pirated ofcourse).Since i've seen none working so far i decided to upload this.

Works for XP, Vista, 7 and for online and offline users.

Description and installation method is in the torrent.

Soundbanks are optional.Its not essential to run GP6.

By the way should I upload GP5 too? +2 votes for yes will do.If someones really desperate then you may vote twice.

My next upload Might be Linkin Park 4Ever
Might Take Some time though.
