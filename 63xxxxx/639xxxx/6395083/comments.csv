@weo fan
yes you are right I had problems with my account.
First time, he was cracked the second I had lost my email for recover and thirdly I might have done something wrong against the rules?

was a difficult period but the most important is that everything is working properly now.

WEO since 2008, I thank all the loyal downloaders who stay with me ;-)"
