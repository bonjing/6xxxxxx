,rsl87,2011-05-17T04:15Z,Does it work on the PS3 or am i just going to waste another 3G of my bandwidth?
,rsl87,2011-05-17T06:28Z,"Nope, doesn't work. Cinavia protected.. this is now the 4th one i've downloaded. I appreciate the effort but really what's the point if you're not even going to check your shit out before you upload it."
,sabby2013,2011-05-17T10:09Z,"lol this shit isnt made for ps3.. 
its made for pc viewing or get a goddamn dvd player they are cheap now 
i connect my laptop with tv.. works like charm"
,g0dsize,2011-05-17T10:09Z,"@ rsl87 The point is that not everyone owns a PS3 and can ONLY play movies thru that medium.  PS3 owners are a minority.  Period.  ViSiON is an awesome team [one of the best] and froggie is doing you a FAVOR uploading this so you can have it for FREE, and I'm sure people like you make them wonder sometimes why they do it.

Back on topic - decent film, but great quality upload as always 9a/10v"
,wrldgt,2011-05-17T18:56Z,@PS3 Owners: Some of us dont use crippled hardware to watch movies and have our own HTPC's that dont give a shit about protection.  Stop whining because your shit cant play it and either invest in something better or figure out a way to bypass the protection.
,rsl87,2011-05-17T19:16Z,You realize you guys all sound like complete losers right? 
,FrozenFlame05,2011-05-17T19:27Z,"always like the release of VISION,,, =)
thanks Froggie100.. =)
always trusted.."
,moshster,2011-05-18T04:08Z,Because of Cinavia I'm ditching PS3 as media player.  A dual core Atom/nVidia NetTop running Windows Media Center is now my media player.  Plays anything and everything without complaint.
,joej191,2011-05-18T08:09Z,"okay for you ps3 user's there are a bunch of muxers then you can tweak with the settings to bypass the block, ex. MKV2VOB duhhhh. now go to bed,,,"
,Powerslave0,2011-05-20T06:26Z,You can see a list of cinavia protected movies at the WIKI page for Cinavia.   MKV2VOB is no longer breaking Cinavia when using DTS to AC3 either.
,Crazy Bastard,2011-05-22T12:59Z,"@rsl87 

you use PS3 mediaplayer? just stream from your PC...

anyways good rip :)"
,Malasky,2011-07-08T15:12Z,Thanks froggie. Quality is good as always. And thanks to Vision for yet another cracking job.
,speedy1791,2011-07-13T14:28Z,hey crazy basterd did you know if you plug an external usb hard drive little or big {the one i got plugged in is 1.5TB} but small ones work too it makes the ps3 less hot because you dont need to go through the ps3 harddisk drive it skipp 100% less than streeming trust me;) and for the uploader much thanks exelent quality
,tcp030374,2012-04-07T18:23Z,Please don't bash the user if you can't figure out how to play these.  I get all my torrents through froggie and they're all the best out there.  I'm using VLC on a MacBook Pro w/mini display to HDMI cable  and get full Blu Ray quality on my TV.  Thanks again Froggie!
