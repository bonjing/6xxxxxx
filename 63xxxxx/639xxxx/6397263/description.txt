This is the BBC 2011 Red Nose Day special edition of QI which was streamed live from approximately 1am to 2am on 6th March 2011. This file replaces \\\"QI.S08.RedNoseDay.Special.2011.avi\\\", which I posted yesterday (15th May 2011). This new file has better quality video (but is still from a screen capture): XviD AVI 720x400 780Kbps at 25fps, with mp3 224Kbps audio.

This video includes the warmup, then QI (including two adverts for Red Nose Day), then a retake. I have also uploaded another file that contains just the QI show, without the warmup or adverts or retake.
