Some new ones in non-fiction that look interesting too.  Great work - thank you!"
,e4me,2011-05-16T23:47Z,I would like to thank you for this and other past e-books you have uploaded over the past months.  Especially for the transition to epub and mobi so even calibre is not needed for a good read.  Keep it up and thank you again.
