Frogatto is a videogame. More specifically, Frogatto is an open-source "platformer" or "jump-and-run" game, which means you're given a "cross-section" view into the world, and you help a small green fellow named Frogatto walk and jump between solid footholds without getting hurt.  There's a long history to the genre, so just by being in it we inevitably have a lot in common with other games, however, we're not trying to clone any specific game.
