I keep trying MAKING myself giving you the benefit of a doubt NLUPPER (All NL subs torrents are most likely your stuff, no matter the name you use), but you stubbornly insist on giving ERRONEOUS information regarding many (not all) of your torrents.

As of now, I have to make due with a prehistoric connectiction due to quata limitation (hate it) from my isp, so this download took 4 days! An I looked forward to see this movie, especially the extras. But in vain.

Thank you for nothing NLUPPER (I wold like to swear, but I'm learning not to)"
