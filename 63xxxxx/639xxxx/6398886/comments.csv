,rsl87,2011-05-17T08:00Z,Another cinavia protected one.. fucking shit.. don't say it's ps3 compatible if you didn't even fucking check to see if it was
[V],neon,2011-05-17T08:51Z,you want cheese with that whine
,moshster,2011-05-17T10:34Z,"Have to agree with rsl87, Cinavia has been around long enough for release groups to get their processes up to date"
,moshster,2011-05-17T10:35Z,"Worth also pointing out that Battle: LA audio track has Cinavia for (DVD, theatrical and BD) so there may never be a Cinavia proof version."
,rsl87,2011-05-17T19:11Z,"Clever come back... if you're gonna upload something that specifically says it's PS3 compatible without even checking to make sure that it is.. well then you just look like a fool, plain and simple."
,rsl87,2011-05-17T19:19Z,"No, I want you to change you're info for the movie because it's not true and you just look like a retard :)"
[V],neon,2011-05-17T21:55Z,cant edit the info rsl87...i think everyone got the point though :) ...and you still have a free movie :)
,ultimagic,2011-05-18T20:34Z,"this movie is not for free. it was stolen, stolen by us and stolen by demanding person ""rsl87"" who didn't pay."
