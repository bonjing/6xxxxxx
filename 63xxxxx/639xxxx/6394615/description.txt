DESCRiPTiON :

Addict  is a professional native VCL component suite that provides end-
to-end  solutions  for  adding  spelling check and thesaurus support to
your applications.

The  Addict  component suite includes many components and routines, but
the core of its functionality is:

Spelling  Check  -  The timeless dialog-based process of checking text,
suggesting replacements for misspelled words and allowing a user to act
upon each potential problem.

Live-Spelling  -  A  slightly  more  modern  solution  of  identifying
misspelled  words  with  wavy red underlines and allowing a user to act
upon    each    identified    problem    with    a    context    menu.

Thesaurus  -  The  ability  for  a  user  to lookup a word, examine its
synonyms and choose an appropriate replacement.

API  -  A  complete  set  of APIs allowing for text parsing, dictionary
lookup,  text  corrections, misspelling suggestions, thesaurus contexts
and more.
