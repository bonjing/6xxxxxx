To read files in DjVu format you can fit your browser with a plug-in found at  http://www.caminova.net/en/downloads/  but, in my experience, browser instability and crashing are not rare occurences (especially with netbooks), so my recommendation for a stable, small-RAM-print, stand-alone reader like the one in the description above."

[T],dynstab2,2011-05-31T16:10Z,"The PDF-to-DJVU transfer was not done optimally (large empty spaces), so make use of the magnification tool of the DJVU reader to get the most out of your lightweight Giancoli.djvu file. No matter what size you keep your window (it's best viewed full screen), you can always type in your own custom magnification % for optimal fit (just like for the Adobe PDF reader). Also you can navigate, although crudely, through the many chapters by expanding the bookmarks of the Contents tab on the left. And don't forget the torrentiquette: Seed to a ratio of at least 1.0 (those with slow connections exempted). If it's not worth seeding for downloaders, it definitely isn't for the uploader."
