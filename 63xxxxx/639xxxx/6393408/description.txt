eTextbook of "Physics for Scientists and Engineers with Modern Physics, 4th Edition" by D. C. Giancoli (c2009). Complete Version (3-volume set, chapters 1 to 44). A single largish bookmarked DjVu file (68 MB).
[To read files in DjVu format, you'll need a stand-alone DjVu reader. I recommend the one available at  http://sourceforge.net/projects/windjview/files/  (freeware; WinDjView + MacDjView). This DjVu reader works pretty much like your usual Adobe PDF reader.]

Comment: A lightweight alternative to this 800 MB PDF that is found posted elsewhere.

Once your download has finished, _please_ seed this torrent as often and for as long as you possibly can.
