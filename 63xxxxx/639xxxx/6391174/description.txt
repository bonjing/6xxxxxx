Called "a true master" by Irish Music Magazine, John McSherry is one of the finest exponents of the art of the Uilleann piping in the world. A founding member of Irish super-groups LÃºnasa and the now legendary Coolfin, John is finally releasing his first solo album SOMA. A fiery blend of pipes, whistles, guitars, bouzoukis and fiddles, SOMA mixes traditional tunes with John's own compositions

A masterpiece of restraint and nobility...His scattering
of self-composed tunes still bear many traces of his
rhythmic escapades with LÃºnasa. Aptly christened,
Soma is a highly balanced and controlled body of work. --Irish Times
