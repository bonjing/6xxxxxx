Checking SS

     Timestamp of Mastering: 2011/04/29 23:34:35
     SS Version: 1

Caution: This SS contains a value (angle 359) that will cause older versions
of iXtreme to return a detectable bad response! Make sure your drive is flashed
with iXtreme version 1.4 or newer. Alternatively, you may enable the option to
adjust angle 359 for compatibility with iXtreme < v1.4

     SS CRC = 9CD54355 (RawSS = 618A38EE)
     SS Media ID: B78157772F078328F32EB266-0D7A8F9F (matches game)
SS looks valid

Video partition found
     Video CRC = 7653FF84 (V0 = 2C7F4C77, V1 = DFEFC0BF)
Video partition does not match known data (probably corrupt but might be a
brand new wave if this is a new game and abgx360.dat hasn't been updated yet)
