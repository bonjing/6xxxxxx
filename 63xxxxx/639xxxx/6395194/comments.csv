,fadyman3114,2011-05-19T15:43Z,"Hi!
I downloaded your first disk upload but this disk when i put it in my xbox it says ""disk unreadable...""
How can i fix this cuz i dont want to waste any more cds? Anyone else whith the same problem?"
,geuheo28,2011-05-20T01:11Z,"wow perhaps you should put away the computer games an pick up a grammer book lol.  ok the torrent is fake, don't blame him for uploading it, why be stupid enough to dowload a torrent with no info and not from a trusted member lmao."
,manicradio,2011-05-21T04:07Z,This rip works perfectly is you have the most recent iextreme firmware and the most recent abgx360.  Great speed as well - average on utorrent 150 kB/s Thanks very much nismo12!  Ignore the moronic flamers.
,rekanhackan,2011-05-28T18:45Z,people does this work or not make your god damn minds up please i need it right now
,ggmmcc,2011-07-03T01:52Z,"Hey guys, the original disc doesn't have the size bigger than 8.5Gb so if I want to buy the game iI have to buy 3 disc? Or the game is packed to rar file or a iso file that fits up to 8.5Gb?"
,nismo12,2011-07-10T14:38Z,i don't know why you guys are having such an issue with this game...this is the exact rip that i have been playing and beat the game. Why the hell would i waste my own time on putting a fake copy up...seriously. Use your heads.
