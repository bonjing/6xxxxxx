,lol1122a,2011-08-11T23:51Z,"Very good audio and video quality. 

Subtitle quality is, at best, 5/10. While you can definitely understand what they're talking about, every line is chock full of glaring errors. Its bad enough to detract from the movie itself. The subs also give a very unprofessional impression, at one point the subber even inserts his own thoughts (via parenthesis)!! That said, from what I've seen, this is the best sub out there. Take it or leave it. "

wtf?! Are subtitles hardcoded? Because there's no way in hell I'll want them on screen if that's the case."
,AcidBarr,2011-09-18T04:34Z,froggie and extremezone have all my movies covered ;] great work dudes
,snowbirds,2011-09-21T05:55Z,"V: 10
A: 7

Subtitles: 4
Who would spend the time to translate a whole movie into subtitles, and then leave out translating the songs that characters sing, as well as everything written that appears in the film?  I don't get it.  Especially the written stuff.  This is obviously crucial to understanding the plot, but there is no subtitles for it..."
,Jeronwong,2011-10-25T04:52Z,"V: 5 (blurred out spot where the subtitles are, if you can tolerate that, then ok)
A: 9 fantastic 
S: 5 (doesn't translate the songs, like previous commenter said, but I speak Chinese, so it's ok for me)"
,Darkripper009,2012-02-29T21:01Z,How do I enable the subs? I only see the blurry bar but I never see a word appear :s
,f.kruger,2012-04-25T17:14Z,thanks froggie
