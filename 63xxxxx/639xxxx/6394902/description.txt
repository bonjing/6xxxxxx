And.... The Performance Gains Are Real!

Contrary to what you may think, file fragmentation is only a minor cause of reduced hard drive performance. The true reason for hard drive performance loss lies in the randomness of the placement of files on your hard drive and the "fullness" of your hard drive. The farther your hard drives heads need to travel between file accesses results in vastly slower file access. On top of that only a small portion of your files are placed in the highest performing areas of your hard drive.

UltimateDefrag3 is the only software product in the world to consider the importance of file placement. It gives you powerful file placement features that move your rarely used files out of the way and onto the slower performing areas of your hard drive and moves your frequently used files to the higher performing areas where data transfer rates are doubled. UltimateDefrag3 also enables you to confine your frequently used files resulting in lightning fast file access times.

The result is hard drive performance 300% to 400% that of quoted factory averages and you experience it as much more responsive Windows performance as well as faster performance of all your applications.
