Literally finds and fixes corrupt/deleted/missing partitions, and allows you to recover lost data easily (without having to format first), and does it a million times faster than the traditional way. This even works if windows is corrupt or won't load right. I was able to access my hard drive, even though the file system was deleted, and I managed to save the recovery files from windows and do a full system restore (Even though windows recovery failed to locate any recovery information on the drive). I love the interface too, it's just like windows. I seriously would have bought this if I knew how cool it is!

Though, I couldn't get the bootable usb feature to work right, and had to burn this program to a cd."

How i made a flash boot drive was to down load this extract it download the trial ver from the real site. Make your flash drive bookable with the trial version, remove what was placed on the flash drive, then put this extracted items from this download on to it. Worked well for me. Hope this helps."
