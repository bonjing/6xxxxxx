Who do they think they fool? Only themselves."

Well sir.., if by using the logic that the results of an ""official court ruling"".., must in fact..,  be ""proof"" of a person's guilt or innocence.., ESPECIALLY when one takes into account ""the alleged"" integrity AND justice of our court system today (or that of any other country's courts).., then I guess by that reasoning.., that Mr. OJ Simpson.., is in fact.., NOT a murderer of two people !!  Do I have that right ?  :-)"

Just because millions of WHITE people think that is laughably absurd (after being programmed by their TV PROGRAMS) doesn't necessarily make it so. Private Investigator Bill Dear solved the case. It was son Jason who Simpson was covering for. The evidence (real evidence, not planted) overwhelmingly shows this to be true. As for DAvid Irving, I don't know about the case against him, but in this documentary he starts out by RIDICULING the notion that a six year old boy, deprived of his own parents, given to Polish peasants to put into hiding because a powerful ARMY wants to KILL him and all of his kind should be considered a SURVIVER of the Holocaust. That was a load of crap."

,expometty,2011-06-22T10:32Z,"Nobody knows WW2 history like Irving, true historian.
And he has no reason to lie whatsoever, what would he? furthermore; why would he keep trying after all this? he's 100% sure he can't convince anyone because A) it's too late. 2) Zionism is stronger than him, the truth and God combined."

,skatanafate,2011-10-08T22:19Z,"I have read some of Irving's books, namely Hitler's War, Nuremberg and Goering's Biography. Whether you disagree with his POV or not (he's obviously a right wing and a Hitler sympathizer), they are an interesting read and he knows how to not make a casual reader of WWII history feel bored. Nuremberg is interesting that it notes with several examples that that while the nazis were certainly the devil, the allies weren's saints either. Thanks for the share."
