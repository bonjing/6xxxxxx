[T],tdkdemon,2011-05-16T12:44Z,not yet..i will upload rudos when its out...am also waiting for it..
,DarthExile,2011-05-16T13:15Z,why would anyone upload a rudos wrestling torrent who the fuck puts wrestling toeerent in mp 4 do us a fav and tell rudos to stop putting them in mp4 killing all of his wrestling torrent who the fuck watches movies and stuff on there pc really 
,DeltaPan,2011-05-16T13:35Z,"XWT - xtremewrestlingtorrents net, a private tracker, i'm member to as too are many other wrestling fans.

Usually sign ups are closed until after PPV's to avoid hit and runs by casual members.

But for future reference, when member, you can go to profile and be alerted via email when a chosen catagory has torrents added, so when selecting TNA PPV's you'd get email notification of every instance upped on XWT for the current TNA PPV, likewise WWE etc.

Waiting on an XviD or MP4 myself. : )"
,supa2008,2011-05-16T13:50Z,"Would prefer to wait a bit and download the bigger file that Rudos provides.  The higher res simply makes for an even better viewing experience.
Its about the best compromise between size and viewing clarity."

,DarthExile,2011-05-16T15:57Z,container : flv great job another worthless upload 
,MrUberMex,2011-05-16T16:14Z,"I'm so sick of ignorant posts like DarthExile.

Fact number 1: x264 (mp4) is proven to be better quality than xvid (avi)

Fact number 2: Anyone with a PS3 or an HD TV with a USB port and media player (almost any HD TV) can watch x264 mp4 files. 

Fact number 3: A lot of people do watch movies on there computer. PC remote controls are like $10 are then it's all good.

,rickyno1,2011-05-16T19:20Z,"Week after week after week, darthasshole whinning like a little girl about mp4 and anything else you dont like. The answer is simple go out and pay for satelite or cable and pay for the ppv yourself. That way you get the quality you want. Its free, so deal with it and stop getting ya pantys in a twist or fuck off somewhere else else. "
[T],n2kmaster,2011-05-16T19:37Z,"I agree with MrUberMax there, Mp4's are smaller so you spend less time downloading, they look great even on my tv out card to a 52 inch tv. @DarthExile, I upload tonnes of FLV and Mp4's as webripz. GET OVER IT! We aren't gonna stop listing to the millions of people here to appease 1 person. Thanks to uploader for at least making an effort. I noticed the bitchers are usually the ones who hit and run themselves and contribute nothing to the community."
[T],n2kmaster,2011-05-16T19:39Z,"And like i thought DarthExile is a non submitter, tell you what, we'll listen to you when you get your balls out of your moms purse and upload yourself."
,ccutting6,2011-05-16T22:18Z,"darthexile why don't you buy the biggest shotgun you can find load it with deer slugs stick it in your mouth and blow your fucking head off we are all fucked off with your bitching about mpeg 4 
big thank's to the uploader"
