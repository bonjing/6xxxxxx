[T],MelloYello,2011-05-17T18:25Z,You guys are welcome.  Sucks I mislabeled it Games of Thrones instead of Game of Thrones.  I don't show up in the search because of the extra 's' I added.  So my episode 4 has more seeds than episode 5.  Even though at the top it says edit torrent you can't really edit the torrent.
