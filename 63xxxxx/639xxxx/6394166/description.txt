The Monastery is a BBC TV series that involves five modern lay men with little or no experience of Christian monastic life sharing in the life of the monks of Worth Abbey for 40 days and nights. The Monastery Revisited reports on the progress of the five men and of the monks since the end of the series.
The Monastery was broadcast in the UK on BBC TWO in May 2005 and subsequently on several other channels around the world. This was the beginning of a cycle of BBC TV programmes that present the impact of contemplative religion on the lives of ordinary people. The Monastery Revisited was quickly followed by The Convent in May 2006, showing what happens when a group of lay women enter an enclosed community of nuns. March 2007 sees the broadcast of The Retreat when a group of men and women live together in a Muslim school of prayer.
