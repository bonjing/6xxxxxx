Weâ€™re used to thinking about the self as an independent entity, something that we either have or are. In The Ego Tunnel, philosopher Thomas Metzinger claims otherwise: No such thing as a self exists. The conscious self is the content of a model created by our brainâ€”an internal image, but one we cannot experience as an image. Everything we experience is â€œa virtual self in a virtual reality.
