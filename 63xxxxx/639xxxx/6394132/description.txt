The Science and Art of Using Telescopes-viny


Amateur astronomers have to start somewhere. Most begin by buying a modest astronomical telescope and getting to know the night sky. After a while, many want to move on to the next stage, but this can be problematic. The magazines advertise a mass of commercially-made equipment â€“ some of it very expensive â€“ which can represent a major financial outlay. The trick is to choose the right equipment, and then use it to its fullest extent.

Observing Skills: The Science and Art of using Astronomical Telescopes provides the required information. First, it explains how to get the best from entry-level equipment (that upgrade may not even be needed for a year or two!). Second, it explains how to select equipment that is at the â€˜next levelâ€™, and describes how use more advanced telescopes and accessories.

The book is organized according to observational targets, and although it concentrates mainly on visual observing, it concludes with a section on imaging and the equipment currently available â€“ from regular digital cameras, through webcams, to specialized chilled-chip CCD cameras.
Observing Skills: The Science and Art of using Astronomical Telescopes is the perfect follow-up to Moore and Watson: Astronomy with a Budget Telescope and Tonkin: AstroFAQs . It neatly fills the gap between these introductory books and the more advanced books in Springerâ€™s Practical Astronomy list.
