                Bigger on the Inside.
                The behind-the-scenes series sets sail for a journey
                on board the Doctor Who pirate ship. Acclaimed
                fantasy author Neil Gaiman takes us on a personal
                tour of the Doctor's magical machine, and there's a
                look at what life is like on a junkyard planet.
                Features interviews with Matt Smith, Karen Gillan,
                Arthur Darvill, Suranne Jones and Neil Gaiman.
