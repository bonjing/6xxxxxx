,fitzy89,2011-05-17T09:48Z,I will be offline for 2-3 hours but will continue seeding when I return.
,jdiggs56,2011-05-19T23:13Z,If you click the system info button on the settings screen. It still says it has 26 days left. Can anyone confirm if this is actually working or just removed the trial box at startup? 
,jdiggs56,2011-05-21T03:38Z,Well it looks like the amount of days left is stuck at the same 23 days for 2 days now. So thats all good. But just like how the DVD didnt work with the 3.1 patch. Now the whole bluetooth/phone section doesnt work in this release. Shitty.
,IBerber,2011-06-30T21:19Z,"I have same prob as jdiggs56. The number of trial days hasn't changed. When I go into the bluetooth settings menu all the buttons etc. are blank so you can't do anything. So try this, it worked for me. Instal the trial version, set everything up in the bluetooth menu and get it working. Then close CF, open Windows Explorer and find the file ""centrafuse"" and rename it like ""centrafuseTrial"". Then follow the instructions to apply the patched file ""centrafuse"". Now you can switch between the two by renaming the patched ""centrafuse"" to something like ""centrafusePatched"" and returning ""centrafuseTrial"" back to ""centrafuse""."
,fitzy89,2011-08-05T09:20Z,"Hi guys, sorry for the problems you've had, I don't use the bluetooth function myself, it didn't support the built in bluetooth on my system so I gave up on it anyway. DVD seems to work fine for me though using a generic usb DVD drive on an Archos 9 tablet. Sadly I don't have enough experience with it to help :(
The number of trial days does seem to stick on where it's at when you apply the patch, mine has said 22 days since I first uploaded this torrent."
