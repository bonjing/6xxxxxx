,prax83,2011-05-16T16:35Z,why 480p... are u going to upload 720p also?
,flextm71,2011-05-16T19:58Z,"This is NOT 480p! 624x264 low resolution. Another wasted brrip! Come on guys, join the rest of us in the year 2011."
,flextm71,2011-05-16T20:10Z,"480p = 720x(480 or less in the case of widescreen)
720p = 1280x(720 or less in the case of widescreen)
1080p = 1920x(1080 or less in the case of widescreen)
p = lines of resolution, scanned progressively"
