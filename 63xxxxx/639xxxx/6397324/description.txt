CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Encode:
well found an avi rip of that new series in low quality, was looking for the dvd itself, 
i found a dvd-5 reencode of it size 4.3gb with 3 audiotracks inside. but its a 4h movie 
so you can guess how good the quality is on that shrunk down.
without the audio space for the movie is just 3gb. wasnt good enough for me. so i continued searching for the dvd9 and finally found it in france. 
thx to warrior btw for getting me the complete full dvd9.
So i could really do a nice rip with high bitrate as source.

Now to the Actors, well i know 3 of them right on first sight, the other 2 from movies

Kristin Kreuk:   well known from Tv-Series "Smallville"
Joseph Morgan:   newest actor on The Vampire Diaries as "Claus" the Vampire/Werewolf Hybrid
Alex Kingston:  actor from "dr. Who"
Stephen Campbell Moore: played in the movie "Season of the Witch"
Emily VanCamp: actor from series "Everwood"

Since it was a 2part movie on the Dvd i am releasing it also in 2 parts since both parts have endcredits.

Source French DVD-9
