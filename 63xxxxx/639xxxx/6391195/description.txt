From the info.txt:

Free client version of Infantry Online, server software is actively being developed (reverse engineered?) to match the Sony Online version.

Need more players! If you remember playing Infantry Online ages ago, this is your call to arms to bring as many people back to the game!

Instructions: Extract all files to one folder, run Infantry.exe.
