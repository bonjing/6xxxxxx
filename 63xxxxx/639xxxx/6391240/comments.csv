It seems it doesn't see/recover from C: so you can't recover what you deleted from trach, and most files one deletes from an external hard drive first it goes to trash. weird program"
[T],FatFreddy69,2011-07-30T13:18Z,"I take back my word.
It shows just 1-2 KB for the file but when when you go further will show all the GB-s files to be recovered.
In fact this program is even better then EASEUS Data Recovery Wizard Professional because it recovered more, files that easus didn't find..
Cheers"
