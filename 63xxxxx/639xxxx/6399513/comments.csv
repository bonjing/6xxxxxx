,rajmxxx,2011-05-17T12:03Z,No problem 20-40. I already said that if you have time then you can. By the ways did you check out Passion Play. It seems to be a nice movie..
,DMVIN,2011-05-17T12:26Z,thanks
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T12:57Z,"@rajmxxx: Nope, I haven't. Megan is in it and that's good enough for me. Tomorrow."

@ ALL - Please LOGIN (create an account if you do not have one) and click the [+] symbol beside QUALITY at top of page for ALL torrents you DL from 20-40.  It makes a difference; shows you care and that his work is appreciated! Don't forget to seed back at least 1/1...

Be Cool !"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T15:31Z,"@rajmxxx: Listen, done both... here come my regulars from 2007, and very very few titles I haven't done already three-four times. Piece of friendly advice: use Search on top of the page and you would find almost anything, not my stuff, but good or even better than mine."
,bakured,2011-05-17T15:31Z,"Thanks a lot for all the great movies.  I try to seed for a while after downloading.  Any chance you could do some blu ray music concerts, especially Pink Floyd or Roger Waters"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-05-17T16:14Z,"It is my understanding that twentyforty doesn't do music concerts as his conversion technique isn't kind to multiple heads in crowds.  Makes them all turn to mush, as it were.

But if you ARE ever tempted to do some, I put my vote in for Within Temptation's Black Symphony performance as a 352P for iPods etc.
As well as Pink Floyd."
,bakured,2011-05-17T16:39Z,"Oh well, we can only live in hope :)"
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T16:56Z,"@formerly_azrielle : Concerts are fine if file-size doesn't matter
 or if they are available - I searched few months ago when you've mentioned WT's Black Symphony but I couldn't find BluRay available for download (and in reasonable manner). Latest music-concert-video I have encoded is  http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6357368/David.Foster.and.Friends.2011.Hit.Man.Returns.BluRay.480p.H264

(still seeded by me - good and fast)
and first Hit-man torrent is probably dead by now. I still remember my encoding of Last Waltz for my late friend lilars (Bob) some six moths ago.

That's all - and quite few uploaders are specialized in/for music videos - not me."
,gopesk,2011-05-17T17:02Z,"@20-40
could you pls upload 
""The Ghost and the Darkness""in 720p
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116409/"
,rajmxxx,2011-05-17T17:12Z,"I have searched everywhere 20-40. But got secretmyth, i.e., 2-3 GB. Your torrents are unique with great video & sound quality. And all the above you do the same with just dvdrip size. You are King dude. Therefore I always seek for your work. "
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T18:10Z,"@gopesk: No, I cannot, there is no HiDef source, never was and never be... out there float few DVDrips. Do plain Google download and fire-up jdownloader."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-17T18:22Z,"@gopesk: TPB delete selective words (you can write fuck, tough) - and my answer looks .... demented. 
What has been written is:
Do Google and in Search field write in a name of the movie plus year plus word download and hit Enter."
,gopesk,2011-05-18T15:18Z,"@20-40
yeah i know that already..before i used to download movies through searching on torrentz,rlslog,1337x,ahashare etc etc....and once i got to download your torrents, so much better quality with much less size,i got hooked onto tpb and now a days i usually prefer to wait for ur uploads and uploads by other quality uploaders rather than searching on other sites....
on tpb i got only few links with few seeds thats y i asked u....anywayz plz upload if bluray comes out..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-05-18T18:34Z,"@gopesk: Keep in mind that you search for something and can find a shit...  and I found your title on Google in five minutes - even on three different places. DVDrip - all three. 

1st. If I am in your shoes - I would be lucky to find anything.
2nd. Never ever look for rare things on torrent sites - logic implies that if some title is old and not very well known - out there is not many who would seed year or two, even longer.
3. Great downloads and some forgotten but great movies are on numerous file-hosting sites. Use torrents when suits better - but do not restrict yourself."
,gopesk,2011-05-19T19:39Z,"@20-4-
actually im already downloading dvdrip from other source thats y i asked u plz do it once bluray comes out....
anywayz point taken..."
