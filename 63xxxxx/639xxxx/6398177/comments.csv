Why will you go on a site that dedicated to Pirates..
Why do you write things on the wall warning us????. Would it not be smarter to just not say anything, and just leave a suprise in our mailbox.

Did you just log in to piratebay and jerk off while you pretend to be anothere person.

Could`t you just make a profile and pretend you are (eks)Angelina Jolie?? I would rather listen to her than you..

I download this game because i wanna play now??or tomorrow(because PEOPLE DONT SEED???)
I will buy this game when my money is in my bank account.

,missinglink1000,2011-05-18T00:21Z,"For people having trouble with the game just returning to the launcher on startup, or with missing or invisible text.  These are also a couple of the bugs that are known to affect some people with the retail boxed and digital download versions of the game so it isn't the cracked versions here that are at fault.  The missing text is a compatibility problem with the Nvidia drivers apparently.  Turn off the 3D vision drivers and if this doesn't work try the new beta drivers from the Nvidia website.  The launcher problem has not got a single fix yet although some have managed to get around it.  For everyone else we just have to do what those who bought the box are doing and wait for the patch to arrive."
,ImTheLaw,2011-05-18T02:19Z,"It was just a joke ... at least for now ;-)
But seriously, If you like it, and have some money to spend, please buy this game.
I'm not going to tell you what to do, even if I could... 
Consider only whether the game is worth its price, and whether you want to play another one.
CDProjekt just beginning their adventure with developing games. 
Unfortunately they not rich enough, to make another game's, if The Witcher 2 will fail. This type of market in Poland is just beginning to develop. 
If you prefer to play more game, from developers that only cares about money & make shity games, it's your choice. 
But if you like the brand that CDP created, you know what to do... :-)

,thrashblade21,2011-05-24T12:55Z,"@koreta Not just ATI cards. My Nvidia GTX 460 was having the same shit and I was freaking the fuck out trying to fix it (Which is weird because the first time I ran it I just set it to high and it worked perfectly). Found your comment, and gave it a whirl. Fixed my problem. Jesus fucking christ the colors. They were just terrible. So just a heads up - It's either anti aliasing in general or there are some select cards that don't work correctly with it on."
,gb949,2011-05-27T19:21Z,"after having followed the instructions to the letter, i'm also getting the ""Installed game version is invalid or incomplete"", before putting the SKIDROW files into the main witcher 2 folder... 

does anyone have a solution to this?
thanks!"
,Digitalweapon,2011-05-29T07:34Z,I got the game to run but there is no sound :( How do I remedy the situation? 
,Mars11,2011-05-30T06:35Z,"I get an error everytime I try to add the files from the skidrow folder to the installation directory. 

Cannot copy paul: Access is denied.

Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not currently in use.

What gives?"

,stogi1knobi,2011-06-11T02:53Z,This game is amazing... I will have to support the developers on this one.
,Craxim,2011-06-14T10:27Z,"to those getting slow speeds, i have no clue if this is true or not, but i was getting .7 kb/s until the very second i unlimited my upload speed, and then boom 600kb/s like normal, and still with a lower upload speed even though it was unlimited.  i have no idea, but what it seems to me is that they are punishing people who limit their upload speed with slow download speed.  again, could be wrong but its something to try if you're getting slow download"

,Jaihmaia,2011-07-17T08:18Z," I followed these instructions from OrangePillow at 2011-05-18 02:59 CET:

STEPS:

1. Installed the game, after it was done a window popped up. Closed it by clicking the cross in the upper right corner.

2. Started the Game/Launcher, waited till the update was finished.

3. After the update the same window from before popped up but this time I clicked accept in the bottom right corner.

4. Started the Game/Launcher to see what message I would get. An activation screen popped up in which you could insert information etc.

5. Well that's not good so then I copied the cracked paul.dll to the bin folder in the witcher 2 directory which replaced the existing one.

6. Started the Game/Launcher and what do you know, it worked and my fun time could start.

*It works and no virus.  Thanks"
,Helroy,2011-07-21T19:03Z,"Ok so far all games from extremezone have worked perfectly. However it took some time plus help from Jaihmaia this time (thanks dude!). You might want to add some steps to the instructions as to how to install.

AH HELL WHO GIVES A FUCK IT WORKES HERE NOW ANYWAYS HAHAHAHAA"
