This is the audio recording of Colin Hay, ex front man for the Australian band Men At Work in the 80s performing a live unplugged version of Send Somebody on the Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in May 2011.

The album version on Gathering Mercury is shite. Played at about 80% of the tempo of the live unplugged version it sounds like a dirge. This version rocks.
