I have been trying to duplicate HD-R-US format iso's and I believe that this is like their uploads. It was made with a program called BDtoAVCHD.  It was compressed with X264 in a 2 pass encode on  a Quad core processor and 4GB of memory. The process is completely automatic , you just pick the size you want the final file to be. I then used IMG burn to burn to DVD and tested it on a Samsung C6500 BR player. It reacted the same as HD-R-US discs and started playing after insertion. There is no menu. 																		************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************														This is from an MKV file please check the NFO file. It is in the HD-R-US style and there are chapters and English subtitles . The text file is info on the AVCHD iso file.																		************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************												 														Feedback is a must if I am to post more like this. Checked Demonoid and still no new posts from HD-R-US but there are still replies to PM's. Maybe they will rise again.
