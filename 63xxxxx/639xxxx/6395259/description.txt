The second season of the wildly popular Dragon Ball Z comprises the "Namek" and "Captain Ginyu" sagas. Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma travel to the planet Namek to find an even more powerful set of Dragon Balls that can restore the lives of Tenshinhan, Yamucha, Chaozu and Piccolo, who were killed by Vegeta during the first season. (Their souls continue to train with King Kai in the Other World.) All is not well on Namek: the arch-villain Frieza, who looks and sounds a bit like Truman Capote, also desires the Dragon Balls. If he uses them to obtain eternal life, he'll rule the universe forever. With a cadre of lieutenants that includes Vegeta, he slaughters the Namekians to gain the supernatural orbs. After his injuries have been healed by a magic senzu bean, Goku heads to Namek. En route, he trains at 100 gravities, raising his powers enormously. Vegeta believes Goku may be the legendary Super Saiyan that appears once a millennium--except he lacks the requisite love of battle. This version of Goku is less aggressive, and he uncharacteristically uses his brain (never his greatest asset) to defeat Ginyu
