Are they:
Windows 7 Ultimate with Service Pack 1 (x64) - DVD (English)
File Name: en_windows_7_ultimate_with_sp1_x64_dvd_u_677332.iso
SHA1: 36AE90DEFBAD9D9539E649B193AE573B77A71C83
ISO/CRC: 992B8FCD

Only this can confirm if it is the real kahuna or not!!!"
,spitzz,2011-05-28T00:20Z,"Is this torrent blocked?

For the last 7 days I am getting this message whenever I try to download:

""ERROR
Problem connecting to tracker - (10061, 'Connection refused')""

Can someone clarify? "
,trebbr,2011-06-17T04:20Z,"WARNING:

The hash for this download is completely different from the hash for the official TechNet file of the same name (Spitz above gives correct one).

SoLoR, explanation please???!!"
,trebbr,2011-06-17T05:45Z,"HASH VERIFIED!

Ignore my previous comment.  Apparently the hash given by the BT client is not the hash of the whole file.  Once the download completed, the SHA-1 hash calculated by a utility matched the one given by TechNet."
