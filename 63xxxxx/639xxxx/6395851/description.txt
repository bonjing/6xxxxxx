2) [u]The Debate: The Truth is Out There[/u] 

Birthers, truthers and conspiracy theorists. People who don't believe that US President Obama is American-born. People who don't believe that Osama bin Laden was killed. Why don't people "believe"? Is it cynicism run amok? Or are there legitimate reasons for questioning what we're told?
