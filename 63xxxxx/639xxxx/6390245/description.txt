[b]Thx Hive


CM8 Doing It Right The First Time :D


Hive-CM8 presents you first a BDRip of the new German Bluray "El Dorado". 
Its a new 3hour treasure hunter movie with 3 well known movie/tv-series actors.

Luke Goss from "Death Race 2"
Shane West from "Nikita"
and Erica Cerra from "Eureka"

German Bluray had English DTS-Audio on it and there is no known US-Bluray Date of it.
Since it was a 2 part movie also on the Bluray i will release it as 2 parts also, 
since both parts have endcredits.
There are some sentences with german hardcoded subs, not really necessary 
to understand but i wrote and attached english subs for that parts only anyway.
enjoy

This mini series brings in historical facts with a science fiction twist. 
It also has a "Indian Jones" feeling to is as Jack Wilder has training in archeology 
though has been trained to use it for treasure hunting. However, his training in both 
comes in handy with the amount of people after him and what he's searching for.. El Dorado. 
The story has them traveling to some amazing historical places in the Incan Empire.
