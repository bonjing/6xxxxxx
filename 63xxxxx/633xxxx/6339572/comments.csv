,PezDude,2011-04-27T07:12Z,Great game but isn't there a Mac native version around somewhere? I know it's been out on Steam for a while now...
,jonah_the_bear,2011-07-25T12:04Z,ridiculously fun and i hope you upload torchlight 2 when that happens. good job 
,Swining,2012-05-26T18:52Z,I'm going to speculate the steam-mac version is probably just the windows version like Left 4 Dead 2
