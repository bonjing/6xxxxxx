The Filth and the Fury: A Sex Pistols Film

2000 R 

Director Julian Temple's rockumentary toasts the godfathers of punk, the Sex Pistols, with an array of Pistols hits; interviews with controversial manager Malcolm McLaren and front man Johnny Rotten; and a look at Sid Vicious's tragic life. Chronically cranky and famously out of control, the band recorded only one album and imploded after 26 months. But their influence on the music world continues to reverberate.
