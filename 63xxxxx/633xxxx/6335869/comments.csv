thx TvTeam +1"
,DeltaPan,2011-04-22T18:47Z,"^^

Just because the username says TV Team, doesn't actually mean everything they upload is confined to coming from TV matey, it's just a username.

They also upload porn rips as well as movie rips, just mostly Television material, same as EZTV uploads porn and movies occasionally, etc.

Peace. : )

,spjh1978,2011-04-23T02:16Z,"thanks for the up 
but what a shit movie i mean come on this is so bad 
and that juno bitch sucks this will win at the raspberries awards for sure  think the world would be a better place if shit like this never got made again "
,sseanbroken,2011-04-23T03:43Z,"anyone know where i can find exorcismus? it was on comcast just like this movie.,. and wrecked with adrian brodey"
,WasclyWabbit,2011-04-23T06:51Z,"I know for sure this is on ppv.. thanks for the up, I sure as hell wasn't doing 7.99 for the ppv price, I might have bit on 4.99"
,eatshit2,2011-04-23T11:58Z,"WORST MOVIE EVER, DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
,WasclyWabbit,2011-04-23T21:26Z,"this movie is fucking awesome!  Don't hate because its a low budget movie that looks like it was shot with a home video camera.  Good story, wasn't a knee slapping riot, but was funny at times.  Ellen page is fucking hot in spandex.  It made me say 'OH SHIT!' 3 times, which is more than I can say for any movie made in years"
,cantdotheatres,2011-04-23T22:26Z,"Great post! Any chance of uploading ""Kill The Irishman""???"
,aroyals,2011-04-25T18:56Z,"yeah a few users said this is a bad movie and i'm usually hard to please in the way of movies but i got it anyway because of rainn in the office and i liked the movie, mostly because of the 2 chars being so similar. so yeah, if you love dwight even 1/2 as much as i do then this is the movie for you. Imagine se2's ""drug testing"" episode amped up a few times so dwight wants to be a superhero instead of a sherrif's deputy then BAM, you get ""super""

not relevant to the movie but made me think ""MINE WAS GREEN"" hahahaha, not very funny itself but comming from him, hilarious"
,aroyals,2011-04-25T19:14Z,"i meant to continue on (damn TPB's lack of 'edit' function, it's ONLY flaw as far as i can tell) but that kind of ""green"" line, not that funny itself but comming from rain, hilarious, made this movie awesome for me in the same way that if dwight was working in a funeral home instead of a paper sales office, BAM Arthur in 6 ft under

p.s 6ft is in my top 5 dramas of all time (with or without him, peter K needs another main role :( )

p.p.s i digress, i better log off, booze an internet just seems to make me crap on and keep typing

p.p.s.s hell... michael c wasn't even my fav in 6ft and dexter has been my fav show for 5 years now so give peter k another fucking chance amirite?"

Watchable. Thanks for the up!"
,gdogfolife,2011-04-26T03:02Z,"pretty watchable quality since it is a tvrip and not from a dvd after all. and yes it is the movie w/ ellen page, its confirmed in the imdb link up above. "
,tehnores,2011-04-28T01:43Z,"A bit blurry, but perfectly watchable. Sort of looks like watching it with a cheap plastic protector over the screen, if that makes any sense."
,clint513,2011-05-03T20:24Z,i have a dvd of exorcismos and it is pretty damn good its not the exorcist mind ya but it works!!!
,clint513,2011-05-03T20:25Z,another thing does anybody know how i can get a copy of the Germany version of we are the night it looks like an awesome vampire movie
,fraserfinlay777,2011-05-15T03:33Z,"Good Upload!

A:8
V:7

Many Thanks!"
,crapspray,2011-05-24T16:55Z,"Ignore the comparisons to 'Kick Ass'.  This movie is far more inventive in its take on the 'no-super-powers-superhero'- genre.  Plenty of dark humor, over the top violence, and an ending which does not fit the typically American 'happily ever after' mold.  

I give the movie an 8 or 9

Audio: 5 (fades in and out at times)
Video: 7 (picture seems slightly out of focus, but still watchable) "
,fr33.cheez,2011-06-02T15:13Z,Dude That was violent!
,Cameigons,2011-06-13T19:39Z,Feels like old VHS quality to me. Perfectly watchable.
,nefisto,2011-06-21T23:06Z,"AWESOME!!!! THANK YOU SO F****ING MUCH!!!
THIS MOVIE ROCKS THE F*** OUT"
,endingexistence,2011-06-29T13:33Z,"Awful image quality, didn't even bother watching. Thanks anyway."
,RedKing13_ca,2011-07-21T07:36Z,When the hell is this gonna get released for real?
