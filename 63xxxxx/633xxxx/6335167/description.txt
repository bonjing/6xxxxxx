RELEASE NOTES

Homefront Update 1 info:


FEATURES:

Ban list rework

- We now store two separate ban lists on servers; a local ban list, 
and a global ban list. The local ban list is for bans that originate 
on the server (via kickbans, etc). The global ban list is for bans 
that are initiated by a trusted ban list authority. The ban lists 
store the date of ban, the name of the admin who initiated the ban, 
the reason for the ban, and a URL field for any relevant ban evidence 
(demos etc).
 
New Feature â€“ DEMO URL

- A DemoURL can now be specified in the server playlist, this is used 
to indicate the location of stored demo files to userâ€™s in-game (see the     multiplayer options screen). A good practice for server admins would 
be to share the demo folder via FTP, this would allow users to grab demos 
of games they starred in, and also (very importantly!) allow users and 
anti-cheat authorities to download evidence for cheat reporting. 
Incidentally, it is now possible to dump all users unique steamID's from 
both in-game, and in-demos to the console or text file (this will make 
reporting abusive players and enforcing bans incredibly easy).
 
GAME BALANCE

- RPG's now deal additional damage to HMMWV's.
- Lowered m200 and m110 sniper rifle damages. The only 1 shot possible 
  is now  headshots.
- Flak jacket now has a lower BP cost, and a slight effectiveness buff.
- Diablo damage adjusted.
- Weapon is taken out of ADS and accuracy decreases when jumping.
 
OPTIMIZATIONS & FIXES

- The Rhino drones weapon attachment was not being properly moved with 
  the Rhino drone on dedicated servers, causing the rockets to fire 
  incorrectly. This is now fixed.
- We have added some animation optimizations for large player games.
- Several UI related improvements were added for large player games.
- Fixed scaling text zooming on Battle Commander when opening up the 
  battle chat or squad UI.
- Switched the buttons around on the load out rename confirmation dialog 
  to better abide by conventions.
- Improved SLI/CrossFireX support.
- A few reported issues with WinXP 64 bit edition have been addressed.
- Improved menu navigation with analogue controls.
 
GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS

- User feedback for kicks and bans has been improved.
- The intermission lobby now displays clan tags.
- Text chat is now possible in the kill cam, spawn selection, and 
  intermission lobby screens.
