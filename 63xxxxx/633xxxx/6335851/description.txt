Noticed tonight when E04 was posted that E01&E03 had not been posted in 720p. Here they are for anyone interested. Better late the not at all. Enjoy and please share. Added note, I just tried to unrar E02 from here (TPB) and Winrar says it is corrupt, (unexpected end of archive). I did 2 forced rechecks with U-torrent. Will post E02 in a few hours if no one else re-ups the file. Not my work. All props to the original uploaders.
