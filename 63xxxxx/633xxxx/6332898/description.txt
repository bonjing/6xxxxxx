           PLOT OUTLINE :

	   From the biggest festival to the smallest church social, 
	   Kenny Smyth delivers porta-loos to them all. Ignored and 
	   unappreciated, he is one of the cogs in society's machinery; 
	   a knight in shining overalls taking care of business with his 
	   faithful 'Splashdown' crew. Follow Kenny as he tackles every 
	   septic challenge that comes his way, culminating in a pilgrimage 
	   to that Mecca of waste management, the International Pumper and 
	   Cleaner Expo in Nashville Tennessee - or as Kenny affectionately 
	   calls it, "Poo HQ". With fly-on-the-wall honesty and wit, 'KENNY' 
	   lifts the lid on one of Australia's roughest diamonds as he juggles 
	   family tensions, fatherhood and sewage with charm, humour and unflinching 
	   dignity. "It takes a certain kind of person to do what I do... No-one's 
	   ever impressed; no-one's ever fascinated... If you're a fireman, all 
	   the kids will want to jump on the back of the truck and follow you to a 
	   fire. There's going to be no kids willing to do that with me. So, I don't 
	   do it to impress people - it's a job, it's my trade, and I actually think 
	   I'm pretty good at it." - Kenny Smyth Part philosopher, part comedian 
	   and all heart, KENNY is living proof that in sewage, like life, the best 
	   will always rise to the top.
