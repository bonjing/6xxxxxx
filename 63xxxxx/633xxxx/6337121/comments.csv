[T],theLEAK,2011-05-02T23:53Z,"@CGrizzy

Did you mount it using Daemon Tools or PowerISO? If not, download them from their official site. 

If yes, find a file called REASON_5_KEYGEN.EXE. If your using Windows 7, right-click and select Run As Administrator. When asks for the product version, click on v5 meaning Reason 5. Then click on generate, probably around 3-4 clicks. Hope that helps.

Any more problems, comment below. "

ATTENTION PIRATERS:

Cracking Record is possible but it takes time. Like Propellerhead, Steinberg has stepped up their security. Cubase 6 will be harder to crack as it needs a validation via USB"

Why are you saying thanks? You're not part of theLEAK, wanting to be praised. Saw your funny comment about cdub6959 on chess00master's torrent. He's delusion thinking he finished school. Set up a legit business? C'mon. Really? 




****Downloaders****
It is true; we're currently trying to crack record for those music addicts. There are other cracks available but all of them are trojans. Be patience.

first of all, i'm not extracting with winrar. poweriso is extracting for me. is that ok?  also, since i've never used any programs like poweriso before i'm not sure if i'm doing this correctly.  i must be doing something right, though, because the program installs.  damn keygen just wont work.

Yes. But the demo version will overwite Reason 5 (the file you've downloaded here).

The downside of this is that it's jsut the demo. But it's up to you. 


If you were to use this version of theLEAK, make sure you uninstall the demo version and reinstall this.

,vulster,2011-08-08T14:11Z,Can't find the keygen.exe anywhere. Deleted the torrent and all files and downloaded it again with anti-virus program but I still can't file the file :/ Mounting and everything works but still. How do I do?
[T],theLEAK,2011-08-08T19:21Z,"@vulster

Your Anti-Virus deleted. Normally, that is a false positive. Download this .txt file, where it has probably hundreds of serials.

@theLEAK awesome upload..."
,Val16bara,2011-09-10T19:28Z,"Regarding your post: "" 1) Uninstall any existing Propellerhead Reason 5 software on your system

2) Download this torrent (If you have done this already, go to step 3)

3) Once the download is finished, open PowerISO

4) Within PowerISO, you will see pictures going left to right at the top page: New, Open Add, Extract, Copy, Compress, Burn, Mount etc...

Once you see the word ""Mount"" , click the arrow pointing downwards and select ""Mount Image"". From here, you must locate the file you've downloaded.

5) Go to ""My Computer"", select ""Reason 5"" and double click on ""Autorun""

6) Follow the instruction on the screen. Once it finished installing, do not open Reason 5 yet

7) Open the keygen (For Windows Vista & 7 user, right click and select ""Run as Administrator""

8) Under the ""Product-Version"" tab, Select Propellerhead Reason v5.00

9) Generate the serial, click 3 to 4 times. Copy the serial number or CTRL+C


10) Open Reason 5

11) Paste the serial number (CTRL+V) and enter details

12) Press OK

13) Propellerhead Reason 5 will now install SoundBanks

14) Enjoy! ""

I'm not seeing a ""Mount Image"", instead it's trying to extract the files just like WinRAR."

,ruesk,2012-02-17T09:09Z,"Using Daemon

1)	Uninstall any existing Propellerhead Reason 5 software on your system

2)	Install Daemon Tools Pro (pirate bay).

3)	Download this torrent

4)	Once the download is finished, do not extract it using WinRAR. The zipped file is the iso file. Also, the Kegen is in the zipped iso file.

5)	Mount the zipped file using Daemon Tools Pro. To do this, open Daemon, create a new drive (or use one you already created if you have this program already) right click on the drive then select mount. Find the iso (zip) file the one you downloaded and select it.


6)	When it shows a picture of a disk that is your virtual drive. Double click the icon to open your zip file. Double click your zip file to unzip. Run your installation of Reason 5.

7)	Once it finished installing, do not open Reason 5 yet

8)	Open the keygen
Select v5
Generate the serial, click 3 to 4 times. Copy the serial number or CTRL+C

9)	Open Reason 5
Paste the serial number and enter details
Press OK

 Propellerhead Reason 5 will now install SoundBanks

,smokey41190,2012-04-15T21:59Z,"easy stuff guys
either have daemon tools or power iso installed
mount image by dragging the reason iso into one of the drives. (if u open folder from your torrent agent and it is not an iso image but it is a winrar file or something like that, then you need to uninstall winrar or other program thats showing instead of iso and then re-open folder and it should be an iso image file) then it should auto load, then you install and when it asks for key go back to daemon tools and right click reason image mounted and click open containing folder and find the keygen and select v5 then copy and paste or enter manualy and thats it! 
go to this link if you want pretty much every reason refill which are different sounds and loops 
dont forget to seed!!
