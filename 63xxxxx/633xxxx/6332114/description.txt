Biography:

"DJ Venez ft. StarCube is a new Swedish dance- and pop group formed in summer 2009.

DJ Venez from Sweden is still a bedroom producer, but hopes to grow into a big and commercial dance success. The groupâ€™s lead singer Christoffer â€œStarCubeâ€ Persson has previously sung for artists like DJ Peroxide - Starchild 2004. In the summer of 2006 Christoffer created a song that people would take time to forget â€œLÃ¥tsasvÃ¤rld/Promised Landâ€ which is a musical genre that Christoffer doesnâ€™t normally work with.

Christoffer has since he could stand on his own feet dreamed of singing techno, hence he is a child of the 90â€™s and grew up with his motherâ€™s eurodance CDâ€™s. Christofferâ€™s biggest music role model is the female singer Natalie Horler from the German group Cascada.

DJ Venez ft. StarCube will engage in their own works but mainly produce covers of the significant tracks that has followed Christoffer through out his childhood. Their sound is taken from fairytales and the forgotten part of the 90â€™s with a combination of the todayâ€™s eurodance that in Swedish is called â€œfjortis technoâ€œ.
