Katsuni, a world famous baseball pitcher, has been on a cold streak lately and her fans are not happy. In a press conference after answering some difficult questions, goes off on a diatribe, berating the fans who have turned on her. Keiran, an extreme fan, takes offence to this and decides to confront Katsuni in her locker room. Cornered, Katsuni thinks quickly on her feet, telling Keiran that she didn't mean "fuck the fans," she meant "fuck the fans," so she is forced to prove it to him what she meant exactly.
