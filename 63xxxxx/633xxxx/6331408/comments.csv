,raymw,2011-05-05T15:28Z,"Thanks for all your good work LigGeorge, I truly appreciate it very much.  Just one small request if you do not mind, is it possible to state what language subtitles are included if indeed there are any?  Just starting to download this movie.

Strange question as 3D TVs all can decode either side by side, top and bottom or direct form your 3D Blu Ray player of course.  Forget anaglyph as that is simply awful, terrible colour, poor 3D etc etc, and went out with the bloody ark I thought.  Without having a 3D set then best to download simple HD movies and not proper modern 3D versions which you wont be able to play as LigGeorge clearly adds at the bottom of his details text."
