,raffayello,2011-05-19T17:17Z,can some one post a tutorial for this iv already wasted to dl disks
,TheLXB,2011-11-07T18:51Z,"So, what we download is a zip file. Then I unzipped it and it was another zip file. Inside of that, there were 3 more. So, does this mean, that this download contains all 3 games, but we can't burn it, just one by one, which means, that it's only 3 uploads in one torrent instead of being 3 games in 1 file?"
