A great album for those who like both electronica and rock. While the instrumentation and overall feel is firmly within electronica (featuring mainly keyboards, \"bloops and bleeps\" and drum machines), the creators are obviously influenced by a lot of good rock and roll, indie rock, and dub, soul, etc. At the heart it\'s melodic and pretty, but there is also a considerable amount of experimentation going on.
