,AxxM,2011-04-23T11:17Z,"To my shame I hardly ever leave a comment on a d/l - being a compulsive downloader! This movie was oscar-nominated for best picture in a foreign language (don't know if it won) - I already had a copy, but THIS, MitZep, is OUTSTANDING- v10, A10 and I URGE people to d/l this and watch perfection. MEGA THANX 4 THE UP."
