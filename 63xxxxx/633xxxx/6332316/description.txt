Recorded September 13, 1955-October 18, 1957
Format:Mp3@320


The Fabulous Little Richard was the third album from Little Richard, and the end of his Rock 'n' Roll period. Released seventeen months after he had left the Specialty Records label, Richard had returned to religion and turned his back on the music that made him famous. Though he would briefly rescind that decision in 1960, and sporadically throughout his career, this album marked the end of his peak period. In order to make the record more accessible to listeners, over half of the tracks featured an overdubbed female backing group.
