Many fans consider this debut album by scottish band Del Amitri one of the greatest albums of that era (1985), but if you started listening to Del Amitri as an alt-rock band, in albums like Twisted or Some Other Sucker's Parade, listening this you'll think it's a different band. Here's no alt-rock, but the pop of middle '80s. It could be Elvis Costello or Aztec Camera, with sweet, complex, conflicted tunes and witty literate lyrics. Young talent.
