If you going to throw a torrent up
get your music correct first."

,Gratious,2011-07-04T10:30Z,"@Dj_nix Okay yeah later I did realize that, at the time I was just hunting down songs. Realizing piratebay didn't have all in 1 package at the time I made one since the other torrent had no seeders at the time, I went off it's list to lend a hand. So troll away or be happy that those songs that are there, are clumped together."
