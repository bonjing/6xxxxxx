The Pattern Wizard makes it possible for anyone to design their own stained glass patterns, from suncatchers to large window panels. With the Pattern Wizard's line, rectangle, circle, arc and curve tools you can draw perfectly with just a few clicks of your mouse. Then if you want to change a shape, you can simply click and drag it around. If you draw a design that's larger than one page, the Pattern Wizard will automatically tile it across pages. All you have to do is trim the pages and tape them together.

The Pattern Wizard can scan or open a photograph and place it in the background so you can easily trace it. The Pattern Wizard automatically calculates the approximate length of lead came you'll need. After coloring your pattern, it can also print a list of the approximate quantities of each kind of glass needed. The Pattern Wizard includes whole patterns and parts of patterns that you can easily change or insert into your own work. There are also 58 stock bevels that you can drop into your design.
