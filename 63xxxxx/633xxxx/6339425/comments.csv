I do make use of these on Mac and would gladly appreciate if somebody could upload CORE's Mac keygen for Adobe's CS5.5 suite if they have it. Thank you so much!"

,lemski,2011-05-14T23:53Z,"All,

Don't believe this is a permanent crack, from what I can see. Followed the instructions perfectly (downloaded 'trial' from Adobe) and initially no problem. Set my clock date forward to August 2, 2011 and it asks for another serial number. Ran the same keygen from this download yet no joy. The installation was on Windows 7 Ultimate.

Tried on my second Windows 7 machine (to ensure no legacy from previous attempts) and starting the installation with clock date set to 2 August, the serial is not recognised thereby prohibiting my proceeding any further. Set to 1 August, tried to install again and the serial is recognised. Again, after install, if the clock date is set to 2 August, serial expired pops up and it wont recognise other serials from the keygen. Set the clock date back and voila!

I conclude that 1 of 2 things is happening:
1) the serials generated by the keygen are temporary, lasting only a few months; or
2) I am doing something wrong and the keygen is perhaps not picking up some information (e.g. system) to make it permanent.

Note: my problem has NOTHING to do with activation, as I unplugged by broadband modem, and I believe have successfully blocked the activation from occurring. This problem appears to be serials-related.

I would appreciate it if other piratebayers could:
a) test their 'successful' installations by pushing their clock dates forward, and starting a CS5.5 app; or
b) advise me if I have done something wrong.

Did not have these problems with CS4 - hoping you guys can help. I've tried to be as logical / clear about what I'm doing.

Many thanks,

Lemski"

,Oddler7,2011-06-15T14:07Z,"I couldn't get this to stay permanent. I used several serials....each one I used from this keygen btw were all saying Invalid Serial. I had to go online to a website with a ton of stray serial numbers  posted and those were the only ones I got to work.

I'd open the programs up and then close them then reopen them and it would state my trial period ended and or the serial number was invalid.

I went to my Host files and put in the little digit code inside. I pasted it at the very bottom as a straight copy and paste and also on a seperate occasion with a ""#"" symbol each line had on all the previous lines in that host file to replicate it's style...[the directions on how to do it aren't very detailed].

,devl717,2011-06-21T13:36Z,"If it keep asking for serial, try this: just click cancel and it will look like you canceling to open the program, but after that the program opens normaly as full version (not trial version). This is just a tip, it works by me."

Did you by chance have zero days left on free trial? Mine is still ticking down and hitting cancel or the big X let's me use the program still but it may be because I still have 24 days left."
,ShadowLea,2011-06-22T22:49Z,"Guys, make sure you disable Read Only on the hosts file. (y'know, rightclick, properties). It resets the file if you dont. Also, (almost)everytime you run Windows Update or System Recovery, the hosts file gets reset, thus requiring you to re-enter the line. This might be what is causing the problem. Keep in mind that when the hosts file is reset, the code will not work again. (because the code gets checked and declared invalid in the program's files).

Also, if you DIDNT edit the hosts file, and you're having problems with getting the code to be valid, EDIT THE HOSTS FILE. Otherwise it wont work, period. SO DO THIS BEFORE ENTERING THE SERIAL! It blocks the program from checking the code on adobe's website. SO ITS REQUIRED TO ADD THE LINE!

You DO NOT NEED TO ADD THE #! its a commentary symbol and will EXCLUDE the line. All it shoudl say below the examples is (might say more depending on your windows version and rip): 

127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com

Thats it. (The localhost is not related to the adobe one, but it's just there (for me, atleast.)) 

If that still doesn't work, add all of these:

127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com

,cc600,2011-06-25T21:59Z,"Given the comments posted I have a few (but not concrete) theories.

1) The adobe CS5.5 suite REQUIRES a call home at some point.  CS5 never requires this - if you enter a valid serial it never is required to activate.  I downloaded a legit trial, blocked the activation process and entered in a serial.  Boom, it worked.  I would venture a guess that after a period of time without a call home, it disables itself and refuses any serial number.  I would imagine that if you had a legit serial and couldn't connect for whatever reason Adobe would be able to do something for you.

2) There is a bug in the software that even with legit serials (I have no way to test this) you will lose activation.  Again, Adobe would be able to fix this problem, but we can't exactly ask Adobe for help on this one.

3) The serials being generated and passed around right now are creating an ""extended trial"".  I doubt this is the case as there would likely be a window that shows how many days left.

4) The serials being generated are being attributed to the new subscription based service.  I don't know if this is likely or not.  I don't know how it works and if you log in and it checks your status every time you start up the program or if you are issued a serial that works until a certain day (or a certain number of days) then deactivates and requires a new serial that is in sequence with the first.

No idea, and this is all guesswork.  I haven't even been able to download the trial to try it legitimately so far."
,ShadowLea,2011-06-26T03:37Z,"Well...

For anyone saying it is working:  Here is a nice test for MC CS5.5.  

1.  In Pr, do you have access to HDSLR Sequence Presets?  The 5.5 Trial wont show those, nor would you be able to open previously created projects that used those.

How is that even possible with the hosts activation blocked?
If that's the case then people buying adobe products must need to put in a new key each month.
Or perhaps they have a database of names/activation numbers they check against when a legit copy connects to their servers.

Use 'sudo'. Above administrators in the privilege hierarchy is the ""root"" user who is the only the one authorized to do some low-level things in the system.

Many of definitions say its ""unwanted"" or ""not-a-virus-keygyen/adobe"" etc. So what I think is that the coding of this reveals too easily that it's a keygen so that's why so many alerts. :)"

,je1v1ima,2011-12-29T04:59Z,"I downloaded and installed this successfully a while ago, but Media Encoder is crashing now, requesting that I update... How should I go about doing that? Since I seem to have no other viable option. Is there a fairly simple way of only updating the one application? Or I'll update all of them, just how do I do it safely? Thanks"
,Dandy007,2012-01-18T19:09Z,"Hiya Guys n Galls,wud lk to jst say wat has worked 4me on installing n activating ""adobe CS5.5 master coll"".. ok Wheather u download frm ""adobe"" as ""trial""..or a ""torrent"" Which have used both!!

 Now ""FIND"" GOOD KEYGEN!!! I've been usin 1 Called ""UPDATED KEYGEN"" (tam/CORE) K Now go through each ""Adobe CS5.5"" folder/app..& ENTER KEY for each app 1by1 (Keep mental note v NAME n VERSION/BUILD) & enter Keys.
 Make sure to ""PATCH HOST"" files ethier by Keygen or Manually?? B4!!! BUT after UPDATED!!
 Downloaded frm Adobe i used E-mail add wid ""Adobe download Assistant""..U have 2! On this Way I NEVER used ""TRIAL"" but 1ce again I PATCHED n ENTERED Keys 1by1...On this 1 I found a REG LINE to put in,I'd Never done this B4..Think it was something lk (AdobeOnlineDefault)...Mayb Som1 More EXPERINCED cud HELP/CORRECT this if need be...???? ALL HAS/IS Working WELL for 1mnth+ now, This my 4th installation Now & STILL good...

Hope this Has helped...Take Care TPB!"
