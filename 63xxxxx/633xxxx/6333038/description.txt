Troubleshooting:

If the screen goes dark, do either of the following:
	Hold down ALT and press the TAB button, keep pressing Tab until you get the screen that tells you installation was successful.
	OR
	Press CTRL-ALT-DEL to bring up the task manager window.  Under the application tab, highlight the On-Demand setup, then click the End Task button.

If you can't seem to get it installed, it might be due to programs running in the background.  Even the likes of an anti-virus program can cause this to not install, so please understand if you have to turn everything off while installing this.
