,QMDMQ,2011-04-27T01:48Z,"Lenschow123, you can go get RAD Video Tools, which are used to play and convert .bik files. To convert to AVI is built it, it can convert to any exporting codec already on your machine, such as xvid, h264, or anything else supplied by a pack such as CCCP."

you gotta extract the .vpk's to access the .biks first then convert."
