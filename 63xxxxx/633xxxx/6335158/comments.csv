I just registered an account specifically to thank you for the MAGNIFICENT amount of effort behind your truly AWESOME and PROFESSIONAL made torrents : Burzum, Metallica, Dodheimsgard, Gorgoroth & other COMPLETE DISCOGRAPHIES.

Needless to say that FLAC(s) are more than welcome and I think a special ""Thank you!"" is in place just for this thing.
But to submit also the 320kbps (the highest MP3 quality) of the exact same thing (with Hi-Res covers, booklets and whatnot) is just the way things should've always been done.

I just hope YOUR manner of creating/uploading torrents becomes the new standard.

Looking forward for more of your great stuff.

Thank you once again, you've my (and I'm sure, MANY, MANY others') utmost appreciation!

P.S.
It's most unfortunate how these torrents don't receive a simple ""thanks"" when they deserve thousands."
