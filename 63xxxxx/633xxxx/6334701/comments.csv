,RiggsRx,2011-04-21T23:26Z,"This Update doesn't remove your savegames, it only makes a new folder to save new files. To start from your last save just go to your save folder path, which could be like this: 

C:\Program Files (x86)\Valve\Portal 2\portal2\SAVE

There should be 2 folders with a lengthy number as foldername. Check the date on to see which folder is the oldest and copy your save files into the new one.

@sasomange : Must be your computer. The game runs fine on my pc. No crashes after loading new levels."
,Soapeh,2011-04-22T00:46Z,"Yes, I'm confused myself. Do we need Steam running to play co-op? Or am I misinterpreting the patch notes which state cracked players can play"
,Persious,2011-04-22T01:28Z,I realy can't figure out how to play LAN. Could anyone show me the way?
,Persious,2011-04-22T01:37Z,How do I play LAN?
,Metatron3,2011-04-22T01:56Z,"The game still crashes after the ending credits. Can someone help me? I thought this update could fix it, but nothing changed. :/"

,scottyell,2011-04-22T11:56Z,uber quick nice one all those seeds out there
[T],rlf-rls,2011-04-22T13:25Z,"Guys make sure that you have no virus, all drivers, directx updated and supported program installed like XNA framework, Visual C++ , NET framework if so then look in the crash log and write here why portal2.exe crash in your comp. Only then somebody can help you.
(You can find crashlog in: control panel -> administrative tools -> event viewer)

I do not know is this correctly translated because i use different language version of windows, but you already know this :)"
,EndFED,2011-04-22T13:36Z,"Hi, it works when I connect online but I would like to be able to play without internet.

When I try without internet I get the = Couldn't Allocate any server IP port, tried 2 address then crash."
,Persious,2011-04-22T16:40Z,"Norton 360 - Detected a Keylogger inside portal2.exe

Anyone else got that?"
,Persious,2011-04-22T16:44Z,Ignore that post which I just posted. It wasn't portal2. But rlf-rls could you give us a clue how to play LAN with my friends? I tried trough console doing this: map mp_coop_catapult_1 but then I get this before my mate joins me: Your partner has disconnected
,Persious,2011-04-22T16:45Z,"What I posted was not right, there is no virus. But rlf-rls could you show us the right way to play online and LAN?"
,Sparrowhawkz,2011-04-22T20:45Z,"@Xander_swe

I get a #Valve_reject_LAN_game every time"
,Jamalnl,2011-04-24T13:55Z,"@ Sparrowhawkz and anyone else who wants to paly coop via hamachi, do this:

In the console:
Client and host:
-Make sure sv_lan is set to zero (default)
-Enter coop 1

Host
-map 

Client
-connect 

 That's all! Make sure u start connecting and hosting simultaniously."
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-04-26T16:26Z,Thank you! And thanks for not unpacking it. Scene releases FTW! :)
,iddanh,2011-04-28T17:14Z,"@Jamalnl

I tried it several times with no success. I tried both sv_lan 0 and sv_lan 1 and coop 0 and coop 1.

Here's a screen shot of the host:
