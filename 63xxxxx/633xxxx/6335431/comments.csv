,mrdoubleb,2011-04-23T08:52Z,"What's up with this new coding?? I've seen this for the past week with some HD files and I don't have audio now.

People have to realise not everyone is using a SW player and can update just like that. I'm using my Samsung TV's mediaplayer. It's been great so far with every HD file, but it does not recognize this new audio.

Worst of all, I can't even fix the file with MKVMERGE (4.7) which normally cleans up messed up files. :(("
