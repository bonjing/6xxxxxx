,Casevil,2011-04-20T08:27Z,"All of you who need an activation key - describe what do you do exactly to install the game, since I did not need any keygen or any of this kind, game just simply installed, I cracked it and it's going smoothly."

A few things need to be moved. Now Mine works, runs fine, but crashes just after it says its made by Valve"

Make sure you put the  client.dll and server.dll files in the c:\...\Portal 2\portal2\bin folder and NOT in the c:\...\Portal 2\bin folder... I made the same mistake at first and the game crashed. Now it works fine.

,DrTeddybear,2011-04-21T02:25Z,"Ok I downloaded one of the latest ""new"" portal torrents, a bit confusing, it was in russian. It Runs Perfectly, just had 2 add a couple of DLL files from the crack. I get to the main menu without a problem. I see SinglePlayer, Cooperative, Options, Extra, Quit. I click Coop and it says something about my internet, I click singleplayer and loading screen comes up, then when it fills says ""Steam Verification Denied""

,jmasta111,2011-04-21T04:49Z,"SAME PROBLEM! HALP! note: if you replace the client and server files it brings you to the screen that you have the singleplayer, coop, extra, etc. if you add in the Steamclient file it brings you to the NO STEAM, EXIT menu"
,Blavorn93,2011-04-22T04:06Z,"Help it keeps crashing when it gets to the main screen, saying something about PED or something, anyone know what's going on?"
,Klaytor,2011-04-24T06:13Z,"The game kept crashing for me too after a little gameplay, BUT I was using portal2.exe to launch the game. I decided to use Launcher.exe that came with the crack. Now I'm playing through with no crashes.

USE LAUNCHER.EXE NOT PORTAL2.EXE TO START THE GAME.

This should help some people having problems with the game crashing. I'm not saying it will help all."
