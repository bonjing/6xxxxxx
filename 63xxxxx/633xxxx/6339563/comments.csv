,jskaherf,2011-05-08T16:36Z,"Unlike the other shitty rips on the site, this is actually of the bluray and actually has subtitles for the Russian parts, but whoever ripped it ripped it with the bluray ""footage scan mode"" feature turned on so you get an overlay in the scenes that introduce technology which is pretty annoying."

,scothuman,2011-06-13T21:02Z,"I just wanted to expand upon jskaherf's comment:

Not only are all of the technology-introduction scenes overlaid, the overlays are completely useless and irrelevant to the plot/comprehension of the movie.  In fact, they actually obscure the items that they're describing, cover actors faces, and generally annoy the viewer.

It also makes the movie look like some hack-job done by a third-rate studio from the late 90s if you're not aware ahead of time that it's a ""feature"" from the BR, and not part of the theatrical release.  (I forgot to warn my wife, and she was confused by it).

If it were just that, I would just be a little annoyed, and probably wouldn't even be commenting.  But the best parts of the Iron Man movies are the fight scenes, right?  You get to see him in his suit actually kicking some a$$ and using all the high tech stuff that has been built up throughout the film.  A good action sequence can be captivating and thrilling.  That's my opinion anyway.

Well this rip has parts where the action scenes are INTERRUPTED (as in paused) in mid-fight (etc) to show some diagram of the Iron Man suit or other piece of technology, and those diagrams ARE SO INCREDIBLY USELESS as to be insulting to the viewer.   They completely destroy the flow of the final action scene of the movie, and they don't add to the viewers understanding of the characters or the plot.  It's on-par with the power going out in the theatre for about 5 seconds every few minutes.

I know, I know, it's free, and why should I complain?  I'm not complaining.  This is a warning to prospective downloaders.  They should know what they're in for.  My advice: Get the 1080p version with the hard-coded NL subs instead.  They are less obtrusive.

V: 9 (for 720)
A: 9
M: 8 (w/o BR extras)"
