,stuntz0rZ,2011-10-27T22:43Z,MagicISO didn't work for me. Ultra ISO did tho! PLEASE MAKE IT EASIER TO USE NEXT TIME UPLOADER. UPLOAD ONLY ISO FILES
,ang93ler,2011-11-24T04:44Z,"stuntzorZ, can you tell me the steps you did in UltraISO?  Did you still Extract with 7-zip?  In Properties I am unable to uncheck the Apple HFS+ box and I don't know if I should be selecting standard or Extended Joliet either.

If ""Burn DVD Image"" it just burns the .hfs file onto the DVD and I can't use it.  I can't convert it from .hfs to .iso either, I get this message: ""Invalid or unknown image file format"""

HELP!! I am fat! I need to work out!!"
