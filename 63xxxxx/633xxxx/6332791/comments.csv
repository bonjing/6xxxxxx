,OZZ1E,2011-04-21T11:39Z,"I take that back!! After entering your serialnumber, finding things that need to be updated the software says ""would you like to register and update now?"" if you select no it won't update the drivers, if you select yes you just come to the paypal page AGAIN"

Oppen SN-txt serial is in there!!"
,mystery666,2011-05-17T06:43Z,"The serial only works if you don't update the driver database. If you update the driver database it downloads a new application core that has this key blocked. Uninstall, reinstall and don't update driver database. at this point its only 15 days old so not a huge problem for me."

Click YES to register, and it will accept the serial, but DO NOT......

""UPDATE""
