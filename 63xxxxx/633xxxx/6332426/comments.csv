,ONeg,2012-03-30T15:56Z,I'm just now listening to the Prologue and it skips...like it was ripped off a dirty CD.
,westie420uk,2012-04-27T00:48Z,"Many thanks! Only the Prologue skips a bit. Tyrion with a Welsh accent? Not felling it, but apart from that its great. Listen to it when i'm too busy to read & i have found myself listening to it whilst i read!"
