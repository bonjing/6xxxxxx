Performance of Kenneth Macmillan's ballet recorded in Covent Garden in 1984, 
set to a score by Prokofiev and featuring Wayne Eagling and Alessandra Ferri as the young lovers.

Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet has long been one of the greatest successes in The Royal Ballet repertoire,
winning worldwide acclaim as an impassioned and thrilling view of Shakespeare's tragedy and of Prokofiev's glorious score. His sensual choreography poignantly captures the conflict between blossoming love and cankerous revenge. 
Romeo and Juliet calls upon the full forces of a great company of dance-actors to present the street fights of the feuding Capulets and Montagues in enaissance Verona, and also to convey the splendour of such scenes as the Capulet ball. It also requires a ballerina and a premier danseur able to express the raptures and despair that mark the young lovers' tragedy. In Alessandra Ferri and Wayne Eagling the roles are lived with tremendous intensity, whether soaring during the balcony pas de deux or caught in the last agonizing moments in the Capulet vault.
