NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALLSTARS  KEYS TO THE KINGDOM
Released:  4 April 2011 
Label: True North
Format: Mp3@320

Deep roots, improvising valor and live-Cream brawn come easily to this trio. Catching it all in the studio has been harder, like juggling snakes and feral cats. Singer-guitarist Luther Dickinson, his drumming brother, Cody, and bassist Chris Chew come close here by lacing hard stuff like "New Orleans Walkin' Dead" with a spare fireside tension in the closing good time "Jellyrollin' All Over Heaven" and a spectral version of Bob Dylan's "Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again" that truly takes the song down South.
