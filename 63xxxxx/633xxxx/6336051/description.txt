These files are in in FLV format. FLV is how I get them after downloading from YouTube.

FLV files will play directly on your PC using the VLC Media Player, a free download from www.videolan.org. If you need an AVI file, as I do to play in a DVD/media player through a regular TV, you can probably download the FLV file and convert it to an AVI file faster than you could download the double-size AVI file, especially while I'm the only seed.

I use the iWisoft Free Video Converter. Cyberlink PowerDirector will also work.

The video is in three parts, which is how I get it. The iWsoft converter can combine the 3 FLV files into one AVI file if desired.
