Only the first episode is 16 x 9 wide-screen format.

The rest are only 4 x 3 and cropped

Disappointing since you state these as ALL in wide-screen format - THEY ARE NOT!

You are partially right - the episodes 3, 4 and 5 are indeed in 4:3 format.
The episodes 1+2, 6, 7 and 8 are in 16:9.
That still doesn't excuse that I failed to check the files properly, and I am humbly sorry for that!

Konashine has a nice high quality pack:
