       How does a simple idea end up becoming a signature joke? Why do   
       some comics embrace profanity while others avoid it? Do           
        audiences really matter? In this one-hour HBO special, four
        stand-up legends --Jerry Seinfeld, Chris Rock, Ricky Gervais,
        and Louis C.K. --answer these questions and more as they let
        their guards down in an intimate, unscripted conversation about
        what it means to be a comedian, and how far each has been
        willing to go to push the limits of taste and originality for a
        laugh.
                            
                                 
                                                  
      
            
                                                     
                                                 
                                                                      

      We know who we are, where we came from, and why we're here. Do you?
