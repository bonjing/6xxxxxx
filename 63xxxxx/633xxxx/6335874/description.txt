Pinkly Smooth is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in the summer of 2001 in Huntington Beach, California, with The Rev (under the name Rathead) as vocalist, fellow Avenged Sevenfold guitarist Synyster Gates as guitarist and ex-Ballistico members: Buck Silverspur (under the name El Diablo) on bass and D-Rock (under the name Super Loop) on drums, implying most likely that it was the now current drummer for Suburban Legends, Derek Lee Rock.

Since then, the band has released only one album, Unfortunate Snort on Bucktan Records. Former Avenged Sevenfold bassist Justin Meacham was also featured on keyboards and piano on the album, but left the band soon after.
