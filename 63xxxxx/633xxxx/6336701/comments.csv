[T],musicalibera,2011-04-26T22:24Z,"Not playable?!? Really? Anybody else besides ""spootern"" having problems with these files? I most definitely don't."
[T],musicalibera,2011-04-29T02:40Z,"A word of advice spootem: try downloading all files before playing them next time... There's absolutely nothing wrong with these files, they all play perfectly, I've doublechecked - but thanks for trying.. I mean the feedback!"
