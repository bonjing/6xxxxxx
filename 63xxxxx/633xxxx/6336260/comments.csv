,bobisevil,2011-06-26T22:13Z,"Re: Installation Instructions: YMMV!

Personally, I've tried changing system locale, installing the program first, etc. None of 'em worked.

My personal problem was having an error message pop up after the AliceSoft logo after running.


I finally got it to work with these steps (hope this works for any frustrated peoples out there.):
1. download Applocale (from microsoft)
2. download registry changer from this site: http://alcahest.perso.sfr.fr/perso/apploc/applocale.html
(all it does is allow to use applocale to run a program by right clicking the program, it will probably(?) work without the right click option)
3. mount iso
4. download english patch from yandere
5. /b/ RUN ENGLISH PATCH INSTALLATION THROUGH JAPANESE APPLOCALE /b/
6. enjoy!"
,Squiggleblorg,2011-07-17T23:14Z,"I did everything the instructions said and still got the error message in gibberish, the problem I think is that I cannot be sure I got the right language when using Applocale because it just appears as 3 boxes, however during the whole installation it showed up in Japanese fine, and there seemed to be no problem with the install, can anyone offer any advice? really want to play this game"
,Squiggleblorg,2011-07-17T23:15Z,"Ignore that, all working fine now :P"
,Brienen,2011-08-12T13:35Z,"I'm not sure if AppLocale is needed or not, I've had this game  (not sure if this torrent) without it before. Regardless, if it is, and you're running an OS that isn't Windows 2003 or XP, gerrting AppLocale to install on your computer will be damn impossible unless you do this:

,Brienen,2011-08-12T14:13Z,"All other than that, just started it up, with patch, and its working awesome. Thanks man."
