All the individual rar files are actually zipped.

So tfash1.r00 for instance is zipped as tfash1.zip. Its the same for all the other files."

Stun provide things 'AS IS'.
Many scene groups doing that. (rar rar rar zip zip zip...)
So it's a good sign of not altered or affected.
It's a shame if you don't ask when you don't know."

This is the first game I've seen with this annoying double-rar/zip system and I hope I'll never have to see another one. Trust me, I'm not alone in hoping that."
