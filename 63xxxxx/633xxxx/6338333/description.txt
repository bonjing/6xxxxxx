 Release Notes
 -------------
 Video.Source....: R5 DVD9 (ELEKTRI4KA Thanks!)
 AUDiO.Source....: IMAGiNE (Thanks!)

 Did our usual work to the video. We couldn't find any line,so we synced and 
 muxed IMAGiNE's CAM audio to it. The Audio was a mess and had about a million
 glitches,luckily they were at non speaking parts. Removed the glitches,fixed
 the clipped peaks, and also used the Russian audio for non speaking parts as
 much as possible. So in short........Audio sucks......but will work until some
 line comes around. Also due to the glitches it is slightly off in spots, but
 it comes right back in sync. You been warned so.....no need for complaints.
 Enjoy!=]
