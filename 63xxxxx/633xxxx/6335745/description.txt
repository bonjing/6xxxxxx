Overview:

Copy Protect is unique software that lets you copy protect your audios, videos, documents and pictures so that they cannot be duplicated, copied or distributed by illegal means. It is the only tool that lets you fight the piracy of your media files like audios, videos, pictures and documents (lots of formats supported).

Copy Protect converts all supported formats into executable applications that run only in the drives they are prepared for. If these files are copied to another drive, they do not run and become useless.

These executable applications do not require any administrative rights to run and therefore there is no need to install Copy Protect at the other end to play copy protected media files

Furthermore, the program comes with a special built-in picture and document viewer that lets you view and read your copy protected files; and a built-in player for your copy protected videos and audios. With Copy Protectâ€™s playlist option, you can also organize and manage all your media files. 

Copy Protect will secure all your media files and prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted material. 

Installation Instructions:

1. Install The Software.

3. Done. Enjoy!!
