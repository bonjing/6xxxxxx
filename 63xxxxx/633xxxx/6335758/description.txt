A Grammy and American Music Award-winning songwriter/recording artist who has sold over 100 million records, Duff McKagan helped shape the music of an entire generation. He was a founding member of Guns N' Roses and Velvet Revolver, and formed Loaded in 1999. Though most widely know as rock's premiere bassist, McKagan once again takes front and center on lead vocals and guitars. Long time Loaded members Jeff Rouse (bassist) and Mike Squires (guitar) return along with drummer Isaac Carpenter who joined in late 2009. 

Recorded by Terry Date (Soundgarden, Avenged Sevenfold), the album follows the band's 2009 debut Sick. A feature-length film, The Taking (in the style of A Hard Day's Night crossed with The Song Remains The Same), is due this summer.
