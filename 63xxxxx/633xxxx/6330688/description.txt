Crowbar
Sever The Wicked Hand (2011)



New Orleans metal band Crowbar was originally comprised of vocalist/guitarist Kirk Windstein, guitarist Matt Thomas, bassist Todd Strange, and drummer Craig Numenmacher. Once known as the Slugs, the band's slow, grinding, heavy sound has alternately been tagged sludge metal and sludgecore, and has drawn comparisons both vocally and musically to Pantera, the Melvins, and Tad. Debuting in 1992 with Obedience Through Suffering, they subsequently signed to Pavement Music and issued albums including 1993's Crowbar and 1995's Time Heals Nothing. Drummer Numenmacher subsequently left the band, and was temporarily replaced by Jimmy Bower, also the rhythm guitarist for kindred spirits Eyehategod. Bower also played drums in Down, a side project for Pantera's Phil Anselmo and Corrosion of Conformity's Pepper Keenan that also featured Crowbar's Windstein and Strange. Guitarist Sammy Pierre Duet, formerly of Acid Bath, joined up for 1996's Broken Glass following the departure of original guitarist Thomas. Bower elected to re-focus on Eyehategod after playing on 1998's Odd Fellows Rest, and was replaced by drummer Sid Montz for 2000's Equilibrium. That association proved short-lived, however; original drummer Numenmacher rejoined later that year, around the same time that bassist Strange called it a career.
