Itâ€™s time for the new issue of this famous UK magazine in HQ PDF format, thanx to P2P source, enjoy! Nuts is a weekly lad mag published in the United Kingdom. It was the first weekly lads magazine to be published in the UK and is sold every Tuesday (originally every Thursday). The marketing campaign cheekily claims â€œWomen, donâ€™t expect any help on a Tuesdayâ€."
