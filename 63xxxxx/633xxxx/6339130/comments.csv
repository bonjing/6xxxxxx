,DPJaymo,2011-04-25T04:08Z,"These aren't archived, you can download individual episodes if you like."
,Crooked_Goose,2011-04-26T22:01Z,I'm pretty sure I love you
,Ecclesiast,2011-04-27T00:06Z,"Thanks, great upload!"
,rolandeld,2011-04-27T05:01Z,"Ignoring a few numbering discrepancies, I can't get ""Are You There God? It's Me, Dean"" to work. Re-downloading currently, but can anyone else confirm? It's the only file I'm having problems with."
,DPJaymo,2011-04-27T05:40Z,"Don't bother, the file is corrupt.

...Damnit.

You can get it here in the same format:

,rolandeld,2011-04-27T18:32Z,"Yeah, still broken. Oh well. Rest of the set is smashing, though, so thanks for the upload!"
,Watdabney,2011-04-28T01:25Z,"Looks like a great torrent, unfortunately there are no seeders.  Any chance of getting some??  Over 7 gig and nobody to help to seed makes a worthless torrent.

Thanks for the effort DPJaymo.  Now only if others would share the wealth....."
,DPJaymo,2011-04-29T03:01Z,"Sorry, tornados and such last night.  I'm seeding it again.

And yeah, seed you bastards!  I've uploaded 68GB of this torrent, give me a hand!"
,xdave89x,2011-07-17T08:23Z,"thank god people are finally seeding,i was stuck at 95kb/sec download,now im up to 550kb sick shit keep it up"
,abstractthreat,2011-08-28T17:53Z,Good quality! Audio and visual are both 8-9 rating. Never had any trouble playing with VLC Player.
,KGN-004,2011-09-09T04:25Z,"I like how you don't mention the source (TV? DVD?) or how the audio and video is encoded (mp3? aac? ac3? xvid? divx? h264?) or the bitrate and resolution. /sarcasm

Yeah, it's not as if that stuff is important and dictates whether downloading this 7 GB is a waste of time for me or not. /sarcasm"
,synchro_w,2012-03-23T06:50Z,"i am puzzled. i desperately want to upload whenever i can but i'm finding, even on torrents like this, that my low 135kBs is not wanted. i ul about 1-2kBs and just end up switching torrent off. why bother if the ul is so slow i'm just wasting electricity? i find it so hard to seed and get my ratio above 1:0.92. i did reach 1:1.18 once but dl'd something which put me back down to 1:093 and superseeding didn't help.
 i often ul at 3/4 of my ul max [90kBs] as that is often the fastest way to dl but my seeding just isn't needed. and i don't know why!!

wait!! it was seeding at 130kBs then for about 2 mins, now it's back to 0.3kBs"
