anyways.. bone thanks (: im going to check out the sample and comment on the a/v"
,Lilochiic,2011-04-23T14:24Z,"good for how long this movie has been out.
v/7 and a/7
video was slightly pixelated, but definitely watchable.
audio was a little bit echo-ey."
,BikeSter1476,2011-04-27T20:10Z,Thanks
,niteyez,2011-04-28T04:04Z,"This upload is utter CRAP, even for a cam. Ever heard of turning off ""AUTO-FOCUS""... This is painful to watch... even the title ""FOCUS Entertainment"" is HORRIBLY OUT OF FOCUS. The audio sucks, even with EQ adjustment it echos badly and the camera is tilted and pulled in throughout the movie. Not to mention the woman's head that appears at the bottom right of the screen intermittently throughout the entire movie. Couldn't you tell her you were trying to capture the film for some project and have her f'n MOVE! Wait for the DVD Rip which should be out and uploaded in less than a week. The movie sucks anyway despite what critics say. It looks like some wannabe director's first attempt at a feature film. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ATROCITY!!!!!"

,niteyez,2011-04-28T05:40Z,Please disregard the link in the comment I made previously. It was unfortunately a fake and probably contained a virus or some other malware. My bad...  The link has been disabled thanks to TPB. TPB rocks!
,thegooch666,2011-04-29T14:42Z,OMG! niteyez. FUCK OFF! You've posted the same god damn essay on several other torrents. No one values your opinion so shut your dirty sordid mouth. Trailer trash.
,lulu_the_hound,2011-05-01T06:27Z,"I would not say A/V=7 but definitely better than some other CAMs...maybe 5-6 both. Quite viewable, BONE always seems to do good work. "
,Skey78,2011-05-10T18:03Z,"Cam does seem to have a bit of focus problems but nothing that can't be watched. Thanks for the upload! Careful with the upload, though. I am blocked to the hilt and still got locked on by my provider for this movie. I have four more times before they shut me down for good. Whoo Hoo! The blocks held for almost 6 months though! :)"
