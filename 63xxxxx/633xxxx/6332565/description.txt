There seems to be a lack of a really good Tantric torrent, so here it is, took me a few weeks to find some of the stuff, but it was worth, I have the bonus tracks from the 2 most recent albums, and more, and the Broken Down EP, from what I could find was pretty much unseen in torrents, at least in any I could find, and what I did find were not usually properly seeded. Ok, now that you have some background of my work on this, lets get to the nitty gritty.

500x500 art, complete/accurate ID3's

Four Studio Albums
1. Tantric
2. After We Go
3. The End Begins
4. Mind Control

Single/Live EP/Compilation Appearance
5. Breakdown/Cliche'/Foresight
6. Broken Down...Live & Acoustic In The Poconos
7. NASCAR: Crank It Up

So there it is, please guys/gals, seed the hell out of this, the torrent community needs a good Tantric torrent.

Enjoy
