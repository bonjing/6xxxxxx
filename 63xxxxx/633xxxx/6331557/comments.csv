Isn't this file is in .rar format? How can I run or convert it?
Thanks."
,Mario1x1,2011-04-23T17:17Z,clariceo7 to open rar files you need to download winrar you can find it on google
,likewatever,2011-04-26T22:07Z,wat do i do
,Decker74,2011-04-28T00:52Z,"Those files are individually rared, so you have to unrar each one at a time, that's why your are getting missing file errors.
It's a bit of a pain to go through all the hoops, but it does unrar into an EXE file eventually."
,natashav,2011-05-07T08:27Z,"Yeah, you're so funny. I had to extract four times using two different programs to get to the end. Thanks but no thanks."
,gardma,2011-05-17T03:31Z,"It works PERFECTLY! I selected all, right click, ""extract here"" (process done 2x i think) and voila! The game plays perfectly. THANK YOU!!"
,Imatwork,2011-08-24T17:43Z,im no stranger to using these files but this seems to be a pain in the ass......cant get it to work used winrar to extract guess ill try winzip and see if that works
,Yamipanda,2011-10-05T13:52Z,"You're a big fan of raring, aren't you? :P
But it's a fun game. Works perfectly. Thanks!"
,DrMocha,2011-11-16T21:54Z,"This release is entirely retarded. Who the fuck would put a 100MB self-extracting archive in a fragmented rar in several .zips in a single rar?

Worst part is, the game even refused to work under Windows 7. Shame on the packer for having done such a dud, and shame on the uploader for having released it."
