Flashback to where the story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends from Wesleyan University, Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes.

Season Two

Ted and Robin are now a couple, and a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. Realizing she is not an artist, Lily returns to New York. She is reunited with Marshall, and the season culminates in their marriage. Everyone discovers Robin was a Canadian teen pop star known as Robin Sparkles in the early 90s, with a hit single \\\\\\\"Let\\\\\\\'s Go To The Mall\\\\\\\" leading Barney to lose a \\\\\\\"slap bet\\\\\\\", which permits Marshall to slap him in the face five times at any given time in the future, whenever Marshall chooses, which he does twice during this season. It is revealed that Barney has a gay, black brother called James (Wayne Brady).Also, Barney reveals that Bob Barker is his father, but in truth, his mother had pointed out Bob Barker as Barney\\\\\\\'s father while watching The Price is Right, but Barney takes a trip to California to be a contestant on TPIR anyway.

In the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on marriage. They didn\\\\\\\'t tell anyone in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall\\\\\\\'s wedding. The season ends with Barney excited at the prospect of Ted and himself being single guys on the town again, and ends the season with the phrase \\\\\\\"This is going to be legen- wait for it...\\\\\\\"
