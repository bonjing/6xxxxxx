           The Ancient Romans believed that the soul escaped one's        
           body with the last breath.  It was believed that last          
           breath held the power to cure disease and prolong life.        
            In 1930's, Dr. Robert Kaminsky devoted his life to            
           finding out how to harness the power in the last breath.       
           Susan Jordan owns a local novelty shop.  One item in her       
           shop, an antique box once owned by Doctor Kaminsky, draws      
           the interest of two men: Raif Collins who hopes it's           
           contents can save his dying sister, and Alex Poe whose         
           motives are more mysterious.  Susan quickly finds herself      
           in a perilous struggle to protect the box and the secrets      
           that it holds.
