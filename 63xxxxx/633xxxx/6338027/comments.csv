Although I have all of the codecs to watch BluRay movies, these don't play right.
On and off, many of the episodes freeze halfway through and the audio keeps going. Also, many of the earlier seasons will not let you seek properly. Instead of the total time utilizing the whole bar on WMP, the whole ~22min is only on 1/10th of the bar.
The audio and video quality is better than the torrents, these just have little quirks and issues."
