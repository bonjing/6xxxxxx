Release Notes
-------------
Video.Source....: R5 DVD9 (ELEKTRI4KA Thanks!)
AUDiO.Source....: IMAGiNE (Thanks!)

Did our usual work to the video. We couldn't find any line,so we synced and muxed IMAGiNE's CAM audio to it. The Audio was a mess and had about a million glitches,luckily they were at non speaking parts. Removed the glitches,fixed the clipped peaks, and also used the Russian audio for non speaking parts as much as possible. So in short........Audio sucks......but will work until some line comes around. Also due to the glitches it is slightly off in spots, but it comes right back in sync. You been warned so.....no need for complaints.
Enjoy!=]
