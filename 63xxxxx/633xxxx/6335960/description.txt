Some great songs here: timeless tunes with hooks and emotion. Ricky Ross and the band really did a fine job with this classic album. Intelligent lyrics, expressive vocals, original and not overproduced sound, and especially a delicate and relaxing feeling that pervade it from start to end, make of this album the ideal friend for many rainy days. Just relax on a sofa and listen: it will feed your soul and warm your coldest moment.
