Dr. Philâ€™s guests are living in toxic, abusive marriages with too many arrests, scratches, bruises, broken bones, holes in walls and damaged doors to count! Lorrie and Scott have been married for five years and both accuse the other of being abusive. Lorrieâ€™s teenage daughters say they canâ€™t take the turmoil anymore and worry about their 4-year-old brother witnessing the fighting. The teens want Lorrie and Scott to call it quits before one of them kills the other. Can Dr. Phil help this couple bring peace back into their home? And, Nicole and Coz say they have had many explosive fights in their five-year marriage. Nicole says Coz broke her finger and choked her until she blacked out. Coz says she threatened him with a butcher knife. Fed up with the fighting, Nicole took the children and left. Coz filed for divorce and is fighting for custody of his son but says heâ€™d be willing to work on their marriage if Nicole came back. Is there hope for this union? Plus, help give a voice to victims of abuse. Join Dr. Philâ€™s campaign to End the Silence on Domestic Violence. Take the pledge on DrPhil.com and become a Silence Breaker!
