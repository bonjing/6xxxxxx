,gmjh,2011-04-23T11:18Z,Can anyone tell me why it's only this one show where's theres thousands and thousands of seeds and peers and yet virtually none of them connect and it takes about 24 hours to download? Why just Fringe sharers?
,kofuchs,2011-04-23T13:06Z,@gmjh I guess it's something to do with this multi-universe thing...
,alectinho,2011-04-23T14:46Z,Thnx eztv!

,dongiovanni77,2011-04-24T23:57Z,"@gmjh 
it took me 5mins to download, and i didnt stop my other downloads.

dl peaked at 10mb/s
maybe consider getting rid of that 486 & 56k."
,gmjh,2011-04-30T10:57Z,I don't know what the problem is. Any other show downloads in a few minutes. I'm now doing ep 21 and it's the same thing. Thousands of peers and connections and none of them connect to me. I've given up trying to work it out.
