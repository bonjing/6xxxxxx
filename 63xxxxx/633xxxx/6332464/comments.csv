1: Everyone and their mother and their dog knows about 'thinkwithportals'. No need to spam for them.

2: Before you go and say something else stupid, maybe you should bother to to check what music is available at that site, then you will see that that their so-called soundtrack does NOT contain all the music from the game. Like most people, the one song I really wanted (this one), is NOT on their crappy incomplete soundtrack. Hence why torrents like this one exist."
