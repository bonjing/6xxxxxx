That which every one of us is looking for in this world is exactly the same thing. Every Being, even the animal, is looking for it. And what is it that we are all looking for? Happiness with no sorrow! A continuous state of happiness with no taint whatsoever of sorrow. Now, if this be the Goal, why is it the Goal? The reason why it is the Goal is because imperturbable happiness is our very basic nature!, And what is imperturbable happiness? Complete and total freedom, and that is freedom to do or not to do anything and everything. This is the real natural state, before, we encumber it with limitations.
