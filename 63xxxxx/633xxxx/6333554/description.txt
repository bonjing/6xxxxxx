In this debut album Terence Trent D'Arby put together one of the greatest soul albums since the peak of classic Motown. From the opening, gospel-tinged, If You All Get To Heaven, through the closing cover of the legendary Smokey Robinson Who's Lovin' You, D'Arby composed a record strong enough to warrant comparisons to the all time soul legends. The album reaches a peak amongst peaks in the 1988 radio hit Sign Your Name, that will forever be a staple of easy listening radio. This album would be D'Arby's creative and commercial peak, never again to be matched by his later efforts.
