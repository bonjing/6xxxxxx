Are these DVD's files from a Mac Computer. I can see them on my PC but I cannot burn a DVD on any burning program. Do I have to convert the MDL and MDS files ?"

Here is the site:http://www.imgburn.com/
It will create an image of the DVD and record it to disc.
It also offers options for the transition point between the layers if the disk is DVD 9."

Are you a Musician since you have all of these DVD,s ?
Anything wit BR is welcome. THANK YOU"
