Bill Maher: The Decider

2007 

In a scathing one-hour special, comedian and talk show host Bill Maher unleashes a furious and furiously funny attack on a wide swath of social and political issues, particularly the achievements of the George W. Bush presidency. The prizefighter of political incorrectness also delivers sharp jabs on drugs, sex, Iraq and immigration in this acerbic assault launched from the stage of the Berklee Performance Center in Boston.
