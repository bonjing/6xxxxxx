The adventure begins when the gang meets up with famous fright writer Ben Ravencroft (the voice of Tim Curry) for his hometown's big Autumn Harvest Festival. Things take a scary and supernatural detour when they learn that the place is haunted - by Ben's ancestor Sarah! Will the mystery reveal that Sarah was a good-hearted healer... or a spell casting witch? Before you can say "Scooby Snacks", the gang is on the case, tangling with bumbling mummies, monster turkeys - and (zoinks!) a ghostly secret hidden in the Ravencroft family's past! Grooving to the tunes of the movie's rocking band The Hex Girls (vocals by former Go-Go's guitarist Jane Wiedlin) and Billy Ray Cyrus performing the Scooby-Doo theme song, it's Scooby-Doo at his spellbinding, spine-tingling, super-sleuthing best!
