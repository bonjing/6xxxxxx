Release Notes

Radio Ventures is a company that provides new music to radiostations
world wide in the highest quality.
We changed the name of this rls in 'Web'.
The source of this rls used to be a real cd, the last months we
changed into a downloaded cd. The quality is still the same, but the
costs are much lower en and it saved us a lot of time. Nobody is playing
real cd's anymore on a radiostation. Because the quality is still the
same, we never thought about changing the name of this rls. The new rls
rules was kind of a wake-up call for us.
