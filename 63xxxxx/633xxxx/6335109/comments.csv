Also.......
While Foobar and VLC Media are decent players, Media Monkey is better for music. Auto-tag files by searching the internet; download podcasts on a schedule; customizable interface; sync with any mp3 player; support for FLAC, MP3, APE, AAC, and many more. I could go on for days, but I'll stop right there."
