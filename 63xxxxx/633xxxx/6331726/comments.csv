,Crater7,2011-04-22T03:23Z,"INSTRUCTIONS- 
1. Download and install â€œSteamâ€.  (Google it)
2. Make a Steam account and sign in.  It should automatically download components that you need. 
3. Download the Portal 2 torrent file.  Once it completes run the installer- ""P2_full_client_190411[csmania.ru]""

4. To install. (super spoon-feeding mode) When you run the executable file an installation screen will pop up, but it will be in Russian.  
     On the first page- click the button that points to the right >
     On the second page- select the top circle (as if you were agreeing to terms and conditions, but you didnâ€™t read them) then click the button pointing to the right >
     On the third page- you choose the folder Portal 2 will be installed in.  You can install it in the destination- C:/program files/steam/steamapps/common/ (Copy-Paste will work) or you can move the files there later, which can take a long time. 
     On the fourth page- just check the box and click next. (IDK what the box is)
     For the fifth page- uncheck the box (IDK what this one is either) and select the â€œEnglishâ€ language.  Click next.  Then click the â€œinstallâ€ button located where the next button usually is.  
Wait for it to installâ€¦. Once itâ€™s finished click the last button to finish.  

5. If you havenâ€™t already placed the files in Steamâ€™s programs files go ahead and do this now. Copy the contents of the Portal 2 folder and paste it into- C:\Program Files\steam\steamapps\Common (you may need to create the â€˜commonâ€™ folder)

6. To get it in full English- move the â€˜revâ€™ file to the desktop (so that it will not block you from editing the file).  Open it with notepad, and replace everything in it with this---

[Loader]

ProcName=portal2.exe

[Emulator]

#Language = English
Language = English
SteamDll=bin\Steam_RevCrew.dll
SteamClient = True
SteamUser = SteamPlayer

[steamclient]

7. Save the file.

Update 3 said I dont have to download the other patches, but do I really have to?"
,Zexous,2011-05-15T10:51Z,"As of yet, I cannot give an honest opinion of how the game works, but from what I can say right now, I pretty much hate this torrent right now, I've waited over 24 hours already, and only reached 35% with an ETA of another 12 hours... :(

Looking forward to playing, though."

,fernanduuu,2011-05-22T07:47Z,"I edited the rev.ini file as commanded, but when i play the game the file delete itself, so the game stay with Russian speech. I'd like to know what i need to do so the game dont delete the rev.ini"
,fernanduuu,2011-05-22T23:21Z,"Btw, i've installed patch 1 and 2 listed in page 2 and 3. Thats where i got stuck at. When i start the game, rev.ini is deleted. I tried installing patch 3 (skidrow) after that and it messed up everything. So i'm back with patch 1 and 2."

,DH3510,2011-06-16T12:42Z,"hey I was wondering the same question as Dirrf. s there any fix on the CTD issue? I love the game, it's just so annoying when the game crashes and you have to replay some levels, even though you saved. But thanks for the game!"

There are some information in English.
You don't really need to read this. There's text like ""this game was downloaded from csmania.ru"" and that's all."
