For all of you downloaders, we would like to give you some advice, 
you should at least be using an IP blocker such as PeerGuardian 2,
ipfilter (utorrent) Ultrasurf (hides ip) all are free and fairly 
easy to set up. 
The next level of security is an Anonymous Proxy or a VPN, both 
hide your IP address, but VPN hides everything you do online, I 
am afraid you have to pay for both of those, but will prevent 
ISP letters, I use a VPN which cost Just me Â£52 for the year, I 
think that speaks for itself !!!
