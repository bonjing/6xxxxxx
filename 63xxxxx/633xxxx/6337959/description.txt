GEORGE THOROGOOD & THE DESTROYERS 
ONE BOURBON ONE  SCOTCH  ONE BEER
Label: Rounder
Released: 2006
Format: Mp3@320

George Thorogood hasn't changed his sound one iota over the years, and his Destroyers (bass player Billy Blough and drummer Jeff Simon) have always given him a driving, simple backdrop for his rough-hewed vocals and spiky guitar playing. Not changing his approach (not that he should), though, means that his early records are still probably the ones to look for, and since this set takes key tracks (including his fun covers of John Lee Hooker's "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer" and Elmore James' "The Sky Is Crying") from his first two albums, 1977's George Thorogood & the Destroyers and 1978's Move It on Over, it makes a nice little sampler of where it all started -- and then stayed. ~ Steve Leggett
