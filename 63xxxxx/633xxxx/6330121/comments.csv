you've been warned, this torrent is malicious

,FatFreddy22,2011-04-20T21:41Z,"@Jorfnar
That's funny, but if you don't believe me, then go troll somewhere else. I Have been uploading torrents for a while and so far, each and every one works and every .eXeElite Fan trusts each one. Go crack your own torrent if you don't trust one. :\"
,Slitt,2011-04-21T02:58Z,"Used this...as soon as you start this it will install and run Winhost32.exe. Check it out in your running processes if you are foolish enough to install this even with this warning. Winhost32.exe will then connect to an IRC and download the real malicious software, totally messing up your system. I went through this but was able to catch it all in time. But you know...I guess you have to learn all by yourself. "
