,jbirdaspec,2011-06-10T04:05Z,Is anyone ever going to put a rip out of this movie?
,Nano11,2011-06-18T18:11Z,"@jbirdaspec

I would think not. It would be against the whole message of the film. 

Im willing to bet the average person who pirates movies absolutely hates this story."
,sean2112,2011-06-25T06:57Z,nano11 - You are wrong.
,theroyalist,2011-06-28T09:50Z,"@Nano11: yeah, it would be a little ironic, wouldn't it?...

Still, where is it?"
,kh7dd,2011-07-24T12:44Z,I believe some of the movie's message and I would download it. 
,diRteh,2011-08-11T00:53Z,Someone needs to rip and put this movie up.. Just sayin
,ebart36,2011-08-31T12:35Z,Just saw that the DVD/downloads will be available Fall 2011.

But I still wanna see it."

As you wrote that comment were you waiting for the federal govt. to come and take over that successful business of yours????  I doubt it, you were probably standing there with your hand out waiting for the fed. govt. to give you a hand out that they confiscated from a hard working, successful business owner, you know one of those ""evil"" rich people, you know the ones that make it possible for me and other working people to actually have jobs.  The jobs that we go to everyday so you can sit there with your hand out.  "
,DirtRich,2011-10-15T21:40Z,"I agree with cboushell.  Exodus, you are an idiot.  Btw, I've read the book, and absolutely loved it.  I was hoping to download it for the time being, and buy it in a few weeks, when I can afford to.  This isn't your typical Hollywood shlock, and those who really believe in its message should pay for it if possible.  Also, if you haven't read the book, please do so immediately!"
