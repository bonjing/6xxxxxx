How do i install?
Thanks"
,dothackjhe,2011-06-21T12:50Z,The game works for me. Just extract the rar file upon complete download. A folder should appear containing the 'counter strike source.exe'. Run that and the game would start updating itself. Play the game afterwards. Thanks for the share uploader. ^________^
