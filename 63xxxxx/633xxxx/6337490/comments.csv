 I ripped the disc myself and added only what it took to play it and a nfo.
 But most full disc copies I've seen are over 7 gigs,so I'm at a loss for an explanation,can only tell you its an exact 1:1 copy of the game with a crack included."
,xDUALITYx,2011-05-25T16:55Z,"Yes! this works perfectly! good and clean too; no need to even create an antivirus exception.

This is one of a very short list of [decent] pc games that actually support couch co-op/splitscreen multiplayer. There certainly aren't enough of those, and there's something wrong with that I say."
,mr4ny,2011-07-26T02:27Z,"Hey Tim, I've got a little problem with the game. 
It installs properly and plays perfect, but after about 5 minutes of less the game suddenly close with no reason. Is there something to do?"
,killer331,2011-08-11T23:24Z,"Works perfectly, thanks! "
,sliverattack,2011-10-05T18:49Z,"Yeah, I've been running into the same problem where the game crashes after 5 mins of gameplay. I'm running on Windows 7 and updated my nvidia graphics graphics."
