To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

After seeing the 'valve' logo and the 'source' info i get the 'portal 2' picture.. there the screen is 'frozen' for a while and i thought ""well, uhm.. it's loading like every other game"". But it just stops after that and goes back to my desktop. -.-""

,elcapizzo,2011-07-15T07:49Z,"After a little bit of confusion and mucking around I seem to have it working. Here's what I did:

1. Installed game as usual from main image torrent.
2. Downloaded the Portal 2 Update 1 (which also included the latest crack fix!)
3. Installed the Update 1 from the exe.
4. Copied over the crack file files into the main game directory.
5. Ran game from cracked ""portal2"" exe.

I was given a warning by Avast! saying that I was opening a potentially unsafe application and that I should run it in sandbox mode, however this would cause the game to crash. I tried running it without sandbox mode and the game loads and works fine. Hopefully no issues with malware but I'll do a full system scan just to be safe; seems fine so far (but you never know). "
,yellowbeard68,2011-07-18T23:49Z,"As usual, works great. Thanks extremezone and skidrow :-)

Playing on win7 64 bit, no problems with anything."
,xXxANOxXx,2011-07-22T09:39Z,"I installed the game, I updated, I copied crack but when i want 2 load a level at the last blue ball it crashes please helppppp"
,themastermorris,2011-08-10T21:06Z,the game runs fine and everything but it wont load any of my saves. it doesnt crash. it just gets stuck on what should be the loading screen with the portal 2 logo.
,elcapizzo,2011-08-27T16:49Z,"crashed after final credit cutscene (in space).. screen went black, portal2.exe had stopped responding, try to lo-load and i am told the exe is missing. try to paste the new exe and it will disappear. some people has mentioned virus issues so hopefully this isn't it.."
,inarihaku,2011-09-01T03:57Z,"even with this update i get

launcher error failed to load the launcher DLL

the specified module could not be found.

i DO have the launcher DLL, and i've re-installed..."
,zumm4554,2011-09-03T12:45Z,"Installed, applied this update, played and finished the game. Had absolutely no issues, it worked flawlessly. Thank you extremezone, thank you Skidrow. :)"
,Sup3rC00p,2011-09-22T21:23Z,errr im just getting audio but no visuals. is it my computer?
,SomeRandomBloke_,2011-11-02T20:17Z,"I'm kind of confused here, which one of the three torrents should i download that's working?"
,SpaceCadet6969754,2011-12-22T06:18Z,"Make sure you put the client.dll and server.dll files in , Portal 2\Portal2\Bin.
Not in Portal2\Bin.
Will see how it goes for crashing with this update.
Thanks."
