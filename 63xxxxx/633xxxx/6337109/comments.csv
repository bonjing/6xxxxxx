no this is not blu ray release.

@fezza93 
This is a fansub group. Admittedly a relatively bad fansub group based off some of the translations ive seen/noticed."

,hatedrain,2012-03-14T11:47Z,The second episode only worked for a couple seconds and then just stopped working.  The first episode also had troubles.  Haven't watched the rest.  Fansub translations not so great.  I wish I didn't take the time to download.

Also be warned, GG fansubs are abit...iffy"
