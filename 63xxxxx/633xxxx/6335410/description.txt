Alisha's Attic were an English duo of the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century. The two members were Shelly McErlaine (nÃ©e Poole) and Karen Poole, sisters born in east London (Barking and Chadwell Heath, respectively), England. Their father is Brian Poole of Brian Poole and the Tremeloes, a 1960s musical group. The "Alisha" referred to in the group's name is a fictional character created by Shelly and Karen, based on an imaginary childhood friend whom Shelly communicated with as a child. â€œAtticâ€ comes from the attic studio belonging to a composer friend, Terry Martin, where they originally recorded demos.
