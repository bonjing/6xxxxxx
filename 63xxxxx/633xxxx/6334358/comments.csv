However, at the second stage, the targeting reticule is frozen in place. Running as admin, tried different resolutions.. nothing is helping."

,lampoon246,2011-04-23T01:07Z,"The 2nd stage works with a controller, same for stages 4 and 5. I think the control config is messed up, even with 2 players WASD controls both players.

Anyone know if this is a problem with the real game?"
,barbaricfellow,2011-04-24T21:14Z,"Crazy as it seems , the mouse wont work after level 1 indeed ?!?!!?
I have spend  a lot of time trying to get a Trustmaster dual  analog control pad working with this game when configured with the  TocaEdit Xbox 360 controller emulator. But now the fire button starts the 2 player game when pressed. , and I cant find a way to solve it.
Anyone knows how?
THX in advance. "
