,zappandroger,2011-06-14T14:02Z,"This is the torrent right here. Along with the other link the author has provided, this is the torrent you are looking for. Whether you are building a new Mame cabinet or just playing on your PC, this is the torrent you want. Period. I have DL 90% of the others, and unlike those this torrent contains 100% (SO far can't seem to find a missing rom set yet) rom sets, screen shots and full setup.  I recommend getting the X-arcadce stick .cfg file from their website as the one included did not function properly, but other than that this is complete.  Just DL and go.  Many thanks for posting this, here's to emulation keeping things alive."
