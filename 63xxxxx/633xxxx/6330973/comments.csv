,mrdopeman,2011-04-21T01:26Z,good quality good sound shitty movie lol
,arielmercoledi,2011-04-22T03:04Z,"this is not a shitty movie, @mrdopeman.  in fact, it's one of the best ever within the genre, in my most humble of fanatic scream series fan (who, though agoraphobic,  went to the 00:01 thursday showing on secret imax) opinions.

when one criticizes something, one should explain their criticism unless it is uncommonly & obviously obvious & commonly understood as such excepting the oblivious.

so i'll ask that you either recommend to me some other films within the meta-referencing comedy-disguised-as-horror slasher genre that will educate me to your ostensibly superior level, @mrdopeman.  & if you do this for me -- for US -- i will be authentically appreciative, in that way that the stock of a successful public corporation appreciates.  if you simply just don't like, or don't understand, the genre, then i'd love to know which genre(& which films in particular within) that you prefer.  in any other case, i'll ask you to explain your deconstructive criticism of this masterfully-done work in a constructive manner, if you would be so f'king kind.

& thank you so much, @hiest, for the upload & for the sample pngs.

sincerely ariel,
arielmercoledi@meerkat.cc

long live black comedy grindhouse & slasher horror!"
,MoldyKittenz,2011-04-23T03:25Z,Agree with you ariel! I really enjoyed this one!
,priced324,2011-04-23T20:14Z,Ariel... how dare someone have an opinion (mrdoperman) without going into a mile long tirade to explain it.I think we should beat down anybody who doesn't like what ariel likes and do things the way ariel says to do them.oh what a wonderful world it would be if every one was just like ariel... ;C
,r1chee,2011-04-24T03:53Z,What the hell ever happend to a good old fashioned  TPB rating of A V M  now its just a shit load of BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!
,FORDEE,2011-04-25T00:14Z,"Oh Ariel, I'd say you need to calm down and just accept opinions as simply subjectivity. Not everybody has the time to deconstruct the previously deconstructed (I say this with the utmost self-awareness). Personally, I've gotten very tired of the pseudo-post-post-modern horror stuff and I couldn't help but feel that the movie came out 8 years too late (online streaming deaths, ""unexpected as the new clichĂÂ¨"", etc.) Scream was like the Reeces of horror brain candy. This fourth installment was like receiving Necco wafers on Halloween; the sentiment is there but the substance is a relic of a different time."
,jiveclive,2011-05-06T18:43Z,"Shitwits, it's a low brow movie. STFU have the old lady micro some popcorn, skin up 6 or 8 doobies and enjoy the movie and give it up trying to sound real intelligent about something stoopid and meant to be stoopid. Or try farting from your lowest opening instead of your mouth. That's just not cool. Mmkay?"
