Re-drawing and blurring the lines between psychedelia and sci-fi, between art and entertainment, between sound design and melody, "ISAM" is Amon Tobin's first album since "Foley Room" in 2007. Tobin has created the finest, most intense work of his very considerable career, an extension and refinement of everything he has achieved thus farâ€¦

The deluxe edition package will come with a full colour 10" x 7"  hardback book, which features exclusive images of the ISAM collaborative installation between Amon and Saatchi collection artist Tessa Farmer. The book also incorporates exclusive interviews with both Amon Tobin and Tessa Farmer, on the themes and inspiration behind ISAM, and on their groundbreaking project together.
