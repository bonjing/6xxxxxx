"100th Episode Pt I and II"

When Hank Hooper (Ken Howard) threatens to 
cancel "TGS", Jack (Alec Baldwin) 
convinces him to allow Liz and company the 
chance to do their 100th episode. To 
produce the best show possible, however, 
Liz must deal with less-than-ideal working 
conditions. Amidst the chaos of show 
preparation, Jack starts doubting a key 
decision in his life and Jenna (Jane 
Krakowski) contemplates motherhood.

Enjoy :)
