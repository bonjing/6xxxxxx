Description......: For the second half of the twentieth century, the Third Reich has been deliberated and dissected. Now, as the Greatest 
		   Generation fades into history, the image of 40,000 uniformed Nazis goose-stepping in perfect synchronization represents 
		   all most Americans know about historys most dangerously successful totalitarian government. Dig deep beneath the 
		   surface of our collective understanding of the Third Reich as HISTORY unearths what we dont know about the individuals 
		   who comprised one of the most fascinating and complex regimes of recent history. THIRD REICH: THE RISE AND FALL uncovers 
		   familiar anecdotes and fascinating details about the people who comprised the Nazi Party, and raids the treasure trove 
		   of archives the Nazis left behind, including rarely seen German newsreel recordings along with other unique footage 
		   carried home by Russian troops.
