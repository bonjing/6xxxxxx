Will seed for a little bit! Definitely worth it!"
,rigmar_radio,2011-04-23T20:12Z,I will wait for an MPEG2 or XviD copy.   I am very disappointed with a lot of the MP4 uploads on this site.   They compress the living daylights out of what was excellent quality sources sigh.
,ambdeep,2011-04-23T20:24Z,is this torrent fine?
,mtrawczy,2011-04-23T21:43Z,The file is only 20 min long?

,crakhed32,2011-04-23T22:19Z,quality isnt bad for the size
,farstanley,2011-04-24T07:20Z,so it's mp4. totem under ubuntu plays it ok
,archerXIV,2011-04-24T22:10Z,I had a problem with my finished file. It wouldn't play on any program and when I tried RealPlayer it seemed to be playing just about a second in the beginning but it kept skipping and starting over. Is this an mp4 problem you think? I'm going to try downloading it again.
,archerXIV,2011-04-24T23:27Z,"Yeah, I deleted the file, tried again and I got the same problem. =/ Help a noob out? I've never experienced this kind of problem. "
,parp555,2011-04-27T17:34Z,"Note: this only plays in VLC. Do not try to skip ahead, just watch. No idea why. Do not try to convert either. Need to fix."
,kanphetigogo,2011-05-18T18:56Z,Quality is decent but not amazing. I couldn't get it to play with windows media player which is weird since it's just an mp4. I was able to play it with Media Player Classic Home Cinema instead. Funky but still it's a nice file for those of us who can't wait for it to come out on DVD
