 An Egyptian royal couple, Muktar and Faktum  
 in the 80s badly need to get their mummies   
 back to life. They are told that the only    
 power that can work its magic on the mummies 
 is the one in the Shakthi Peetams in India.  
 Muktar sets out to capture the special power,
 but gets killed at the hands of the brave    
 Rudra who guards the Shakthi trident â€“ the   
 key to enormous power. Two decades later,    
 Faktoom gets the chance to avenge her
