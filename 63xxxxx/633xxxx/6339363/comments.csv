,SD_rocks,2011-04-23T20:28Z,"Yeah wow! Thats the fastest 720p I've seen lol...
Btw i thought the second episode had a different name so you naming it as Part 1 makes me ask a question whats the run time?"
,Voxi,2011-04-24T01:13Z,"This is just part one, 43 minutes long.  Keep an eye for part 2! :3"
,arr1829,2011-04-24T02:07Z,"thanks for the quick rip.
why isn't this labeled doctor who 2011 ?"
,darwinite,2011-04-24T03:52Z,The reboot is commonly called Doctor Who (2005) to distinguish it from the original series.  So this is season 6 of the 2005 series instead of season 33 of the original series.
,Tinny_pb,2011-04-25T04:44Z,"What's with the people who clicked -1 on the Quality thingy? Are they anti-piracy? There is nothing wrong with the quality of this torrent.

It's genuine; it's the complete first episode of series 6 (2011); the video and audio are excellent. A9 V10. Thanks, SAFCukO09.

Quick tip: if you don't like spoilers, do not watch the ""Next Time"" teaser after the end credits."
