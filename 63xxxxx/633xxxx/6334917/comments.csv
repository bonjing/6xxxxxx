,dlarrym1111,2011-04-24T02:32Z,"To:  . . . I swear, I am not unhappy or meaning to come off sounding like an""ingrate"". I want to ask if there is ANYWAY POSSIBLE, to re-convert this movie EXACTLY as you did with one difference. PLEASE set the frame rate to 30 fps. Because you have it set at 23.98, it causes a ""HICK-UP"" effect every few seconds of viewing. Maybe others are not having this issue but I tried watching it using VLC, QUICKTIME PRO vs 7.x , a media viewer written in DARWIN specifically ported for Mac (and does everything VLC and QUICKTIME does and uses many of the same codecs found in the QUICKTIME app.) I would look at my own software/hardware as the problem. but I have a copy of the recently released PREDATORS (w/ Adrian Broody. . . Why he's was cast as a ""tough guy"" is a mystery to me but he did ok?.?) ANYWAY, it is also put into a MP4 cont w/H264 video and AC3 audio, and this problem doesn't occur. I was confused to what the difference was, it made no sense. So, using QUICKTIME PRO, it allows you to get a report on all the details of any given movie you load. When comparing the data between the 2 movies that seemed to be made or converted from the original BRDVD in the exact same way, I noticed that the only difference was the FRAME RATE. The PREDATORS film was converted to 30 FPS (not 29.98 which may or may not have been fine w/ my various media players) and this movie -THE ISLAND- was converted ( as you know at 23.98fps ) You have it on your info below as 24 fps | and yes-It makes a major difference. Is there ANYWAY you could upload a copy with a higher frame rate rather then a fractional frame rate? I really do appreciate your time. Thanks, sincerely, DM"
[T],ILPruny,2011-04-24T02:48Z,"HA , HA,  is not my encode is a 3Li release.

[T],ILPruny,2011-04-24T09:44Z,"I dont encode 720p, you should have read the nfo which is included.
I see now that you have Mac, i think the procesor has less power for this x264 version.
I sugest you get the 720p xvid version.

,PauloFran,2012-05-04T04:00Z,"Awesome video quality. Thank you a lot!
The movie has become one of my favorite ones."
,jdankens,2012-05-27T06:08Z,"Good quality quality for size, looks like an older encode.  Granted this is a fairly long movie with a lot of 'moving' so large file size is required for real good quality

For a 720p:
V: 8
A: 8"
