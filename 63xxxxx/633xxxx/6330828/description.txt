With the aid and powers of the titan Prometheus, Will Rock rrampages through Lost Olympus, seeking the safe return of his love, Emma, and revenge for the murder of his mentor, Dr. Headstrong. Prometheus, fusing his spirit into Will's able body, seeks to wage a bloody vendetta against the god Zeus, who robbed him of physical form long ago. Half mortal, half Titan, Will Rock will stop at nothing short of toppling the pillar of the gods to wreak vengeance of mythic proportions, and to save a terrified woman in the name of love. They don't have much time, thoughâ€”on the eve of the next thunderstorm, Zeus will be able to take a new wifeâ€”and this time his sights are set on a mortal: Emma Headstrong.
