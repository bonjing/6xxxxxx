,GenEmperor,2011-04-24T09:28Z,Confirmed working on NTSC wii with neogamma. Just need to force NTSC and it works fine.There is a glitch that you may encounter with a gate not being open.This seems to be a problem with the game and not that something is wrong with this disk image.  The only way I found to get past it is to create a new file and start the game all over again. Good thing is the glitch area is not far ahead from the start of the game.
