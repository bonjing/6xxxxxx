this is my first torrent ok

simply run left 4 uncut then run l4d1 or l4d2 to know that it worked you will hear a sound like a beeeep if you are using it on l4d2 go to options multiplayer gor hight(you only have to do this once)

thats it if you own l4d1 on steam(non illegal) then in options.ini change the 0 to a 1 then when u click it will autorun l4d1(does not work for l4d2)

done
