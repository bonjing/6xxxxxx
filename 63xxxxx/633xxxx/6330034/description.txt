Jack is struggling to cope with recent events and decides to pay a visit to Ronnie in prison. As the pair are reunited, there's an awkward silence as they sit together but Jack finally asks the inevitable question of why she did what she did. Jack pleads with his wife to tell the truth, but all she says is that he should find someone who will treat him well. Ronnie blows her husband a kiss before walking away from him, leaving him devastated.

Charlie enters, clutching a cuddly toy. Kat is overjoyed and jumps up, running into his arms for a tearful reunion.
Meanwhile, the press arrive on Albert Square after hearing about the goings-on in Walford. However, Mo has an idea of how to deal with the reporters and grinds up some tablets into a dozen mugs of tea. She then hands out the cups to the press outside, but Alfie demands to know what she's up to, fearing that she's poisoned them. One of the reporters then comes into The Vic wanting to use the toilet, and Mo tells Alfie that she slipped laxatives into all of the cups. Soon afterwards, everyone gets a surprise when Charlie arrives at The Vic with a cuddly toy. Kat is thrilled to see him and the pair have a tearful reunion.

Over at the cafÃ©, a local reporter approaches Whitney and manipulates her into talking to him, telling her that he's from the Walford Gazette and wants to set the record straight because he doesn't like the way Ronnie is being portrayed by the national press. Whitney accepts his words and soon starts to fill him in on the situation.

Elsewhere, Ashley sees Mercy kissing Seb and tells Fatboy about it; Tanya struggles to come to terms with the events of the previous week; and Mercy tells Fatboy that she has visa issues, but he jealously instructs her to get Seb to sort it out before later informing his father that he's in love with Mercy.
