fyi guys any reg tweaks for any windows black might get deleted and a new wga download starts again
did this to my win 7 and xp pro installs so just uncheck the 2 entries in the vulnerability section in the version 4 beta 
otherwise looks nice and does a lot more tweaking cant wait for full version thks again adrian"
