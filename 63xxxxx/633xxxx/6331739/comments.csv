im very cunfused..
i got a picture, 2 text documents, and a 7 second clip of blank nothing"
,kalibcrone,2011-06-30T00:37Z,"found a solution to my previous problem.. i didnt have a video player capable of playing MKV video files. if anyone is having problems playing the video, download VLC .. it can play a very wide range of video types."
