A female vampire teams up with a nerdy delivery boy to help her bring in female victims, while a suave business executive/vampire slayer plots to kill her.

n this sequel to "The Vampire's Seduction", we find that Dracoola (Tina Krause) has been resurrected thanks to the nerdy Eugene (Zachary Winston Snygg) performing a spell over her ashen remains. Apparently, this vampiric female had been slain in the previous movie thanks to Wally Van Helsing (John Paul Fedele) slipping her a garlic sandwich. I haven't seen this movie, but that's the gist of what I got from the intro. Anyway, Dracoola is back amongst the mortals, and since Eugene is the one that resurrected her, she turns him into her personal slave. His one and only order is to kill the bumbling Wally Van Helsing, but thanks to Eugene's tendency to turn into a peeping-tom every time he walks by one of the neighboring houses, the job never actually gets done... and while he's getting off on watching these ladies, Wally sets out to dispose of Dracoola a second time in order to break the curse that has turned him into a bumbling idiot. A.J. Khan, Darian Caine, Katie Jordan, and Misty Mundae star in the loosely-related sex scenes of the movie.
