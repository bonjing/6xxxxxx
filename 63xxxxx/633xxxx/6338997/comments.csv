,MarkajvPirate,2011-04-23T20:24Z,Sound very muted and color almost washed out. BUT with VLC player and changing he audio to Full Bass and Treble then changing the video by moving the hue closer t the right it looks and sounds fine. Good enough to watch on a laptop. 
,sidneyivan,2011-04-23T20:41Z,Thanks For the upload. About the Quality...9 for the video and 6-7 for the audio...For now this is the best Quality..
,paulderby,2011-04-23T21:49Z,"the first (and hopefully only time) Imagine have let us down.  The audio is very very bad, not much of an improvement, than the cam audio

V-9
A-3

How Imagine say in the NFO that the audio is good, is beyond me"
