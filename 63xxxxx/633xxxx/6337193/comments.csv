Can you please give me the link of the websites, cause I don't understand anything of RuTracker, and I can't find TSY.
Thanks!"

,Thootjeajax,2011-04-26T21:15Z,"@dr.stantz
I didn't understand anything of rutracker before, but now I do.
You have to sign up, and then there appears a searcher in the middle of the top of the screen. Just typ railworks, and then scroll down the page, en then you'll see a lot of add-ons for railworks.
I hope you can understand my English, cause I am from the Netherlands."
