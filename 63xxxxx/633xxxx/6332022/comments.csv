oh and im on win 7, skidrows rip"
,ramrod126,2011-04-20T21:33Z,"It is excessive for sure. I played through the game once, on hardcore, with no cheats. Now I want to play through again, choosing different factions and thereby seeing different endings. This just makes it easier to do that."
,ramrod126,2011-04-21T18:09Z,"I didn't put perks in originally because I don't care if I have them or not but if you want to add perks just add this to the end of the test.txt file. These are the ones I would most want to use. Lady Killer, confirmed batch, other accuracy/weapon proficiency perks.
