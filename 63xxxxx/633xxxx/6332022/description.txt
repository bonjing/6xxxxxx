Because some people actually downloaded my Fallout 3 mod file I decided to go ahead and make one for New Vegas too.

This has been tested and confirmed to work on Fallout New Vegas retail package but I see no reason it wouldn't work with others.

1. Install game.
2. Place "test.txt" in the main game folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\fallout new vegas"
3. Start game and exit the Dr's house.
4. Remove all weapons and clothing and wait for any status effeccts to wear off
5. Use ~ key to bring up the console
6. type "bat test" without the quotes. Hit ~ to close the console
7. Bring up your pipboy and enjoy your new stats, weapons and items.
