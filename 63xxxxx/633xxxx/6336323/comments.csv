,LordGrave,2011-05-03T13:32Z,"I'm not sure about this, but I am under the impression that the game called With Fire and Sword released in Eastern Europe only and the international With Fire and Sword that should be released today are not exactly the same game. I think the Eastern European game has the story based on the novel, while the upcoming release should be a firearms-focused sandbox game, like the previous versions of M&B. I hope this is a translation for the Russian game."
,LordGrave,2011-05-03T13:33Z,"btw, please send to elfnecromancer@yahoo.com"
,jesaug205,2011-05-03T14:13Z,"@LordGrave:
I think that the novel inspired them to make a game that takes place during that era. Meaning that the easternEU game and the international version is the same. Only now they are translating it and patching it up. Thats how I understood things anyway :P

But this torrent/maillist is still bullshit and you should NOT but your emails here asswipes... srsly"
