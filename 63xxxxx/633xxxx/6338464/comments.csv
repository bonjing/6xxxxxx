,pantaylor,2011-04-26T01:37Z,"H Extreme. Was wondering if you or someone else could help me please. Your rips are great quality but I seem to have issues running them from disk on a DVD player. They run for 20sec or so and revert to the start. This is on any DVD player I use (x3) except my stereo which gets half way through the movie and then stops. I get that VLC is the best player to use on my mac and there is never an issue using it. Just want to watch them on a TV not the computer.

Any idea what I can do to fix this issue so that the dvd's play with your rips? 

Once again, thanks for all the quality rips.

Cheers"

Excellent download but the acting in this is wooden and clunky.

It may be a true story but it's cliched to death with the 'gangster movie' bible.

Still, worth a watch and not one you feel you've wasted your time on..."

,CaddySlim,2011-05-14T14:31Z,"Great job yet again! I live near the city of Collinwood where Danny Green lived. He is still talked about to this day. He is considered a local hero/legend. He would bring groceries to the elderly and help the poor. Sure he was a gangster and killer but he really did love and care for his city. This movie was actually filmed in Detroit but it was nice to see Cleveland in the opening shot.
