mrgoodbar- not sure was made with 7 sp1 professional student source disks. but all windows 32 bit and 64 bit disks have all versions i just removed the version file so that you could select all versions on both disks then put both 32 bit and 64bit disks together using Automated Installation Kit."
,ragman420,2011-05-07T00:21Z,Thanks!  It's harder to find these untouched than pre-activated so you can use them to reload valid systems.  I've been going nuts trying to find an untouched Vista SP2 x86 x64 AIO like this too.  I will definitely seed this.
,rizla12,2011-05-09T12:05Z,"So this is uncracked? Can I install windows with this and then use a crack (like windows loader or what it is called) on this? I mean, will I get the option to run like trial or something and then crack?

I never liked preinstalled cracks, thatÂ´s why IÂ´d prefer this. 

Thanks for answers."

,ipxpxpip,2011-06-01T23:52Z,after smashing an external burner and cursing at the mexican who's netbook it was I ended up doing a usb drive installation and it worked. Thanks for the upload bud. btw the piece of shit machine is an HP mini 210-1000
,amehar,2011-06-12T22:33Z,"@sun3moon9

x86 is the intel 32bit architecture. so stating x32 means it will work on AMD CPUs and intel CPUs "
,DaRkSe7eN,2011-06-29T12:40Z,is your is an inegrated Windows 7 X86 X64 all in one to SP1? and no components or contents were remove? this .iso file?..

,KCMM,2011-11-04T17:46Z,"Worked great. Had issues with these in the past, but this one worked wonderfully from USB.
