Tuesday Night Music Club is the spectacular debut album that launched Sheryl Crow into rock music consciousness. Certified seven times platinum and charting at n.3, the album spawned five Grammy nominations and three wins.  She was a veteran backup singer working with pop giants Michael Jackson and The Eagles, so this album was probably an eagerly expected corporate investment. If so, then this is the music business doing it right.
