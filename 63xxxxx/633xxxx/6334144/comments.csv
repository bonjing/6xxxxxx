Can anyone shed any light on why some of these torrents don't start? 

I did a search for http://torrentday.com and it came up with another private tracker site 

http://thorbits.org

that had a very fast and nice working American Idol S10E28 torrent. 

Once again, can anyone shed any light on why TPB trackers including http://www.torrentday.com isn't working? TvTeam was always been reliable as sunshine but lately a lot of their torrents aren't starting."

Its not just theese torrents, i have found many others that wont start..."
,hotwwwired,2011-04-23T01:45Z,I'm sure the guys here are working on this problem of torrents not starting. TPB usually outsmarts em all in the long run but there are some blips like this sometimes.
