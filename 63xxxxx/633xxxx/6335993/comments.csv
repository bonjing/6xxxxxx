,studentagain,2011-04-22T15:48Z,"This movie is soooo good!!! Better than Toy Story 3,2,1 put together! A must download! 3x!"
,johnnyb.goldb,2011-04-22T17:58Z,"Typical eco-BS that the euro's have been pushing. Man=Bad for everything. Europe has been co-opted by the radical greens, wake and smell the tea!"
,ashen77,2011-04-22T18:44Z,"johnnyb.goldb... LOL, your telling others to wake up after such a ridiculous statement?

,almightykay,2011-04-22T20:44Z,"dont believe what @studentagain said, he's a bare faced liar and a charlatan, and one would almost definitely want to kick him in the genitalia for suggesting so. this is simple put, a cheap gold watch. pixar set the bar too high. 
why they bother wasting money producing these things is beyond me, its not like there going to see any return on it."
,SecretAgentMan23,2011-04-22T22:24Z,havent watched it yet but it looks good. quality is deff good. only schemed through it and it looked like a good kid movie.

,tapper101,2011-04-23T03:31Z,"""studentagain""

He's lying, and he's a troll. This movie is terrible, just like the IMDB rating says and all the reviews.

,wkneil,2011-04-23T04:02Z,tnx a lot extremezome for this ups.. more to come..
,studentagain,2011-04-23T07:56Z,"LOL, some people would believe anything aka ""almightkay""  & ""tapper101""

Any decent downloader checks his imdb links before anything else. 

And since when did women start using torrents, huh ""almightykay"", stop this nonsense and go make me a sandwich ;D"
,TheyCallMeSkeelZ,2011-04-23T08:26Z,"Thanks for the UL extreme! If you don't like cartoons then please don't write it here on the comments, keep it to yourself. 

It took me a while go get good seed (I downloaded it yesterday when it got uploaded.) Thanks again. "
,SuperWurm,2011-04-23T11:02Z,"Johnnyb.goldb is right and I know it cuz I live in this focked up continent. Those green-left self-righteous  vegetarians preach for decades that the world is about to end because of the industry and the cars and the airplanes and the sigarettes and our farting and the cows who are farting. They wanna tax and control everything to keep the planet green. As if nature isn't able to do it her self. This planet survived meteors, vulcanos, ice ages. And now those green-left politicians think that the human species suddenly will kill this planet with producing too much CO2.
If one vulcano eruptes it produces 1000 times more co2 than all of our cars have ever done.
I get so sick of thos semi-liberal green coloured socialists with their crapy Greenpeace bullshit."

1,5 million isn't much compare to the Germans who watched this movie

,urlich,2011-04-23T11:55Z,"@SuperWurm-The current situation is difficult. See how fast the glaciers are melting. How is the ice disappeared in Antarctica and the Arctic. Nobody is saying that this is Armageddon. Not be easy. There will be a lot of refugees as a result of climate change. This will increase the number of wars and destabilize global political and economic situation.
Forget the communists, leftists and greens. See how the climate changed in the USA."

,Limbsay,2011-04-23T18:44Z,"Over the last 5 years I've watched hundreds of movies if not thousands, NONE of them has been as bad as this movie. After 1/3 of the movie I just couldnt take it anymore. Do yourself a favor and just drop it, dont download it and save your braincells from screaming out in agony!"
,jschenk,2011-04-23T18:52Z,"@SuperWurm
Have you? Riefenstahl was a genius."
,SuperWurm,2011-04-23T22:02Z,"@urlich
30 years ago my biology teacher told us that in de nearby future the ice on both poles and on some mountaintops would melt, because we're still at the end of two ice ages. And suddenly the reason is that it melts because of de co2 from our cars?
Why the sudden change?
Oh yeah I see, cuz you can't tax an ice age, but you can tax industry, cars, sigarettes, cows and farting"
,SuperWurm,2011-04-23T22:06Z,"@jschenk
Yes I did. She's a genius for her times.
Too bad she did some advertisment work for the wrong regime."
,htndabong,2011-04-25T01:57Z,"Horrible movie unless your a animal that wants to get rid of all humans. I burned this for my little brothers, what a mistake. My dad told me it was very anti-Human so I asked my 7 year old brother if he liked it and he said it was like Madagascar but not funny.    It was high quality though, Great rip extremezone"
,gnomethrower84,2011-04-25T05:07Z,excellent copy keep up the good work!!!! everything worked PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!
,rafiki101,2011-04-25T15:57Z,You guys do realise that humans are the only BAD waste producing species on earth. If we weren't here the earth would be a much nicer place. People are complaining it anti-human but of course its totally fine to see people destroying each other in almost every movie and no one says a word about it being anti-human. Since when has it become the norm to kill.
,Aton,2011-04-26T07:50Z,"Superwurm, you're a superloser. I assume you're an ignorant american since you know nothing about anything. Fuckin' retard. "
,stefniamoo,2011-04-26T17:55Z,"damn this was a horrible movie :/ really bad.
seriously. also way too much ""mmmmm"" and ""rrrrgrrrr"" ""ahaaaa"" honestly. insdead of saying thank you there was a 30 second ""mmmmrrrrgrrrr""
"
,SuperWurm,2011-04-26T19:05Z,"@rafiki1
If there weren't humans, nature, evolution, god or whatever would produce new ones.
The reason we waste, destroy or kill so much, must have a reason. If not, we wouldn't be like this.
Like George carlin said: Nature wanted to have plastic, so she invented humans to produce plastic:-)

@Aton: If you have read my postings a lil' better, you would have known from wich continent I come. It's a continent full of green, social, leftwing politicions, whom preach anything Al Gore wants them to preach. Without any critics or adding questionmarks to his propaganda.
Makes me asking myself who are the ones who stopped thinking?
Personaly I don't believe politicians anymore. Left wing, right wing, it's all chicken wing."

,Manduh,2011-05-13T21:39Z,"@studentagain 

I am a woman and to answer your question, (""And since when did women start using torrents,"")  I've been downloading torrents since about 2003 and have taught everyone I know to do the same... ""Women"" can be just as tech savvy as any man. So how about YOU get in the kitchen and make ME a sandwich! LOL"
,NitLions,2011-05-14T06:20Z,"@pal4pal, it should just seed on its own when you are finished dl'ing it. It should also upload while you are downloading, but only the stuff you have already downloaded. You should be able to control the speed that you upload as well. I usually upload at like 50 kbps while I'm downloading a bunch of files at the same time and then change it to unlimited when I'm done downloading. Or if Im just downloading 1 file I'll leave it at unlimited. If you don't want to mess with all that the simple answer is just leave it going and don't quit your program when you've finished downloading the file. Very simple, just don't do anything"
,COTTA,2011-05-29T21:57Z,"Good quality, of audio and video.
Also is a good animation movie 8.5/10

Thx ;)"
,dewandaru,2011-06-17T21:02Z,thanks extremezone...good movie
,MadroxLette,2011-06-29T04:20Z,Movie sucked and easy to sum up that some eco green tart that makes those extreme commericals that blow up humans to save a damn salamander made this piece of shit movie. I am sick of global warming and how humans are killing this planet. Such a load of shit people these days have to much damn free time and to much of an opinion on every damn topic. Sorry but animals are on the bottom of a food chain for a reason.... and until they are smart enough to do the shit humans do we are not gonna change a damn thing. Like it matters anyway
,ggun,2011-06-30T13:38Z,"Thanks Extremezone. The movie was a little too 'pc' for my kids though. When Holywood indoctrineates our kids in a lie, its a little too much for me.  The vast majaority of scientists, 30,000, claim 'global warming' to be a man made hoax. Now its 'global cooling' for the last 4 yrs?? When I was a kid it was 'gill plates' in baby humans taught in our schoolbooks which was later confessed to be a hoax too. Its a good thing Al Gore wasn't elected, as he would have been our worst pres. ever instead of Obama."
,pirateYoho,2011-07-03T13:14Z,"thanks for the movie.. and pls pirates why criticize the UPloader?, obviously he/she did not direct the movie!   But i would like to say thanks for both the movie and more importantly a chance for us all to comment on something that seems to be a informative discussion on the misleading of our society..  thanks extreme
p.s. quality is good! as usual 4extreme"
,Phatfish,2011-07-13T23:42Z,"Kalyn22:

Oh....so you scored the movie 91 out of 2?

I do understand why u liked this movie. The story obviously must make perfect sense to you...

Me,  myself who are not currently on acid had a hard time even following the story, not sure if there even was one.

,APHORDITE,2011-08-12T01:50Z,So great pic but cant get sound from Itunes Divx quickplayer that has happened before on rango going to try a different one from you hope the pic is just as good from the cover it looks like it
,debiais,2012-04-11T16:46Z,Why is it that none of the USA members who have this torrent share it???
