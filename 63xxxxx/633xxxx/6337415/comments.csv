,rtghrtyzx,2011-06-17T23:55Z,"The tpb topp 100 hundred makes me so sad. How to be millionare..how to get laid... mimic what ever or you gonna be that massive success. No fiction. I like to survive my boring life by hearing god audio books not that revulotion in your car. Be......just andl only listen an half hour in your bloody car. Im looser but I do love god to listen to books just for the love of god fiction and  not for making my life better, bigger , larger than life . My life is fucked but Mantest never gonna make it larger or what ever and firetruck to tpb100 top hundred for loving this sick stuff.   "

,rtghrtyzx,2011-07-09T01:33Z,"at least 70 % of tpb top 100 audio book list is about getting some(pussy or das geld).  If you have all the pussy and money in the world would you whore with leactures and books? No! No! I want to share with the world (for a humble fee)! No way its about selling snake oil to self help addicted morons. Does  Buffet stuff huge black dildos in his behind? What stopping you? Dont you wanna be a winner? If Warren,,,  "

dude i have a sincere request with you i.e. plz upload all the audiobooks in aac or m4a format dude cauz it would be easy for us to download in small sizes whereas if its a audiobook with huge speeches its unnecessary to download large file in mp3 format so plz next time convert all the audiobooks to  its smallest size as possible and upload ....."
