,pringlcj,2011-04-26T11:26Z,Doesnt work its only a demo version.... meaning it has no landing gear and the controls dont work so you cant use the elevator or airlerons
,saintamadas,2011-04-28T14:17Z,"Guess your abbreviation stands for Foolish Brainless Idiot. Why in hell will you upload an aircraft allegedly to be CS with a cockpit of a default 747 panel? Its better for someone to assume you don't think straight than to remove all doubts. Least i forget, kindly upload your legs in place of the landing gear so we send it back to you."
,vittupaa1980,2011-04-28T19:05Z,""" my legs fix for Cs 777"" :D"

,poopoo812,2011-07-12T06:45Z,"saintamadas, are you retarded or what? If you were smart enough you would know that Captain Sim has only released the external model. It's better to wait for the full version but CS is shit anyways"

When you next install something fresh, have your temp folder open and see what goes on in there and also if poss run a prog that tells you what files going where, maybe reg system, coz clearly there is a file goin somewhere outsidde of FSX ,So copying/paste the folders, Aint working,For none of your CS ups ( altho still apprieciated :) ) No control input/landing gear."
