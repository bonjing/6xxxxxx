Control the rescue workers who rebuild three islands in the wake of devastating weather! Remove debris to free trapped workers. Repair damaged restaurants, houses and sawmills to produce resources. And patch up bridges, helicopter pads and boat docks to restore the infrastructure. Then race against the clock to collect gems, put out fires and save stranded swimmers!

Rescue Team is easy to play. In each of the game's 60 levels, the player simply points and clicks where he or she wants each worker to go next. The challenge is contained in figuring out the quickest way to complete the goals, earning the most money and winning the best trophies. Players who prefer a relaxed experience can finish the levels on their own terms and still progress.
