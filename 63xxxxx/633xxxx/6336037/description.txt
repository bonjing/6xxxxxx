Proper Notes.....: OTV's release (aka Megafactories) is also 170ms out of sync and has blended frames throughout as does XTV's. It's
		   apparent that they are both from the same encoding source since both have the same audio glitch in the beginning,
		   same sync issue, and same frame blends. Since they are same source, I didn't make any new tinypics for OTV. These are
		   from XTV's.
