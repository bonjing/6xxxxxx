 Story

As the name indicates, the drama is based on the life and times of the same three characters and their friendship - Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie who are known as Faraz, Kashif, and Gulsher respectively. These are three passionate young men who wish to start their careers in the Pakistan army. In the initial episodes, ample footage is used to detail the backgrounds of every individual and the circumstances under which they enroll for the armed forces. Faraz is the Mr Perfect guy who does everything right while Gulsher is a polite and a simple minded shy person. Kashif is the original funny man responsible for providing most of the humor through his antics, pranks and mischiefs. Eventually the series morphs into a coming of age story where the lead characters realize that there is more to life than their present happy-go-lucky lifestyle as they (through the course of series) experience the true face of life in all its fragility and extremities - jealousy, heartbreaks, traumas and death. Another important character
is Shahnaaz, a confident, educated and well-mannered young lady, who plays an important role in the lives of these friends. Her involvement with them in the roles of friend, wife and confidante adds reality to the series that is poignant and touching on a personal level. The main theme of the drama is that every person should lead a goal based existence and that if one has the will and the passion, a person can achieve anything.
