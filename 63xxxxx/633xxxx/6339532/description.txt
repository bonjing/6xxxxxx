                Coming to America.
                Behind-the-scenes series about the making of Doctor
                Who. In Utah, the episode director tries to find the
                perfect movie-style backdrop to one of the most
                ambitious scenes to date, Matt Smith dons his stetson
                and gives a run-down of the USA filming and the crew
                talk about the thrills of filming in the Utah desert.
                Back on home ground, there's the creation of the Oval
                Office, the much-debated return of River Song and a
                whole load of backstage action from this spectacular
                two-parter. Featuring interviews with Matt Smith,
                Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill and Alex Kingston.
