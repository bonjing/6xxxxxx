Genre: Documentary/Music


Description:
The film is about a very special moment in the famous composer's 
artistic life. Composing with innovative minimalism for films as 
memorable as "The Draughtsman's Contract", "The Ogre", "Man on 
Wire", and most famously for Campion's "The Piano", he has reached 
an international audience. But now, Michael Nyman is about to 
become a filmmaker himself. Featuring unprecedented access to the 
composer and his working life, this film shows one of the great 
composers of our time in all his diversity and endless energy. From 
London to Berlin, in Mexico, Poland, the Netherlands and Portugal the 
film is also a journey through the musical world today. It shows 
Michael Nyman, the musician, in his concerts with The Michael Nyman 
Band and live collaborations with other internationally known 
musicians or orchestras. But throughout his journeys, this film 
discovers Nyman's increasing passion for filming and photography.
