plot

Bobby Saint and Mickey Duka meet with their contact, European arms dealer Otto Krieg, during an arms deal at the Tampa, Florida seaport. But the FBI intervenes and Bobby Saint is killed in the ensuing crossfire while Mickey is jailed. It is revealed that Otto Krieg, who was supposedly killed in the FBI shootout, is actually an undercover FBI agent and former U.S. Army Delta Force soldier named Frank Castle, who was shot at by an agent using blanks. Shortly thereafter, Frank retires from the FBI and celebrates his retirement at a party with his FBI friends and coworkers before heading to a family reunion at his father's oceanside home in Aguadilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Bobby Saint is revealed to be the son of powerful Tampa crime boss, Howard Saint, who is enraged by the death of his son. Howard and his right-hand man, Quentin Glass, bribe the FBI for confidential information about Otto Krieg and find his true identity. At Bobby's funeral, Howard learns Frank is in Puerto Rico and will be heading for London soon. Howard orders Frank murdered, but his conniving wife, Livia, demands that they kill Frank's entire family as well to "settle the score".



Part 2

Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson) has been the Punisher for six years as the story opens. He assaults a "beat the rap" party for a mob boss, Gaitano Cesare. Billy Russoti (Dominic West) escapes to his recycling plant hideout, and Detectives Martin Soap (Dash Mihok), and Saffiotti (Tony Calabretta), who were staking out the party, inform Castle. Castle infiltrates Russoti's hideout and kills one thug as he is exiting the bathroom. The gunshot alerts Russoti, and a brief fire fight between Castle and him ensues. During the battle, Russoti is thrown into a glass-crushing machine which does not kill him but leaves him hideously disfigured. Russoti later refers to himself as "Jigsaw" because the stitches in his face resemble puzzle pieces. Castle, who has taken cover behind the body of Nicky Donatelli (Romano Orzari), discovers that the first man he killed in the facility was an undercover FBI Agent.
