It stars Russell Brand in the title role, and Helen Mirren, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, and Nick Nolte with supporting roles.

Plot

A boozy playboy rascal named Arthur Bach (Russell Brand) is set to inherit a $950 million fortune if he marries an heiress, Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner), who his mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) thinks will make something out of him. However, he falls in love with Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig) and turns to his nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren) for help when he is made to choose between money and love."

Cheers and happy movie ..."

,steve.cooper,2011-04-23T22:37Z,hi there mate... would it be possible for u to share a few screen shots? many thanks...
,steve.cooper,2011-04-24T01:27Z,"don't waste your time guys.. its the worst cam ever.. shot from a side angle.. the same piece is also out in a worst quality of around 370 mb..

this one has just been tweaked as far as the contrast goes.. but overall not worth the download.. 1/10

nice effort none-the-less.. thanks uploader "
,joethetoe,2011-04-24T03:31Z,"steve has it correct, this copy is horrible video an audio, Especially for its size. "
,joethetoe,2011-04-24T03:33Z,this copy is horrendous. not even watchable. 
,blusniffer,2011-04-24T11:06Z,"There's lots of guys whose main aim is to get as many uploads as poss regardless of quality ( or the best under the circumstances bullshit) as it's quantity.
Only a fuckin imbicile would look at their uploads with pride when 90% of them are unwatchable cams like this one.
I agree with steve+joe what an awful waste of bandwidth!!!"
,frogshare,2011-04-25T01:34Z,"Stop uploading misleading torrents. It sucks. If you upload cam shit, tell us. But don't make us waste our bandwidth. What's the use in people luring in and then disappoint them? Do tons of seeders make you proud? Or why don't you give out a single piece of useful information about your torrents?"
,Officefx,2011-04-25T14:49Z,"why dont you ppl stop complaining geez, there trying if you think you can sneak into a theater with a hi def cam go for  it and upload something better otherwise post a/v and shut your fucking mouth"
,Warchief25,2011-04-26T00:01Z,I do not see anyone else posting this so even if it might be a little bad yall should just quit bitchin and go see movie if quality is that important to you. good job globeplus
,cigaretteburns,2011-04-26T10:37Z,This IS the same terrible cam that has NO ending! Do you not waste your time; a better version will come along one day soon. 
,TDawgls8,2011-05-04T18:28Z,"Waw i have never said a bad word about a torrent its free so i dont complain but OMG this is not even worth watching and such a waist of the uploaders time
