Hi guys.. I finally got this game to work.. 
I have played this a lot, and didnt find any buggs, tell me if you find any.. 

It worked nice on my macbook.

This is a cider port, and there is no need for downloading a engine for this to work.


This is my first torrent ever. 
I will seed this game for a while. 
If nobody seeds, you can always download this game form here.
