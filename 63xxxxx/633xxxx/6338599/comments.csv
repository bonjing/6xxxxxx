,Dinee,2011-04-23T19:56Z,"Hello
How to make this mnfsrever thing work?
Need help!
Thanks"
,pipotheclown,2011-04-23T23:35Z,"mnf only works as administrator, i cant get the hacked ones to work tho =/"
,pipotheclown,2011-04-23T23:37Z,i only get a loading screen if i open them with flashplayer to be more precise and the other file just gives me a blanc screen 
,stabstabby,2011-04-25T06:23Z,Yea to get the mnfserver to work you need to change the hosting files. After i did that tho i click on the 2 boxes and get a loading screen and a blanke one? what do i do
,renhoek3,2011-04-25T11:58Z,"@pipotheclown

For the hacked ones, open the prldr.swf file with your webbrowser, not a separate flash player."
,stabstabby,2011-04-25T19:55Z,ok so figured out the hacked ones. But the ones that use the server just don't work ive tried pretty much everything i can think of. If anyone can help plz let me know
,renhoek3,2011-04-26T00:02Z,"@stabstabby

How much useful help are you expecting when all you say is ""it don't work""?"
,stabstabby,2011-04-26T04:48Z,"Sorry. what i mean by it doesn't work, When i open the server no browser pops up then when i open my own like it says i can't get to the website. also when i open the prld file then the correct file nothing happens, but if you right click and hit forward you can see diffrent sceans. But whatever help is apperciated on the matter i will contunie to try and figure it out."
,MCXXX305,2011-04-26T05:25Z,same thing with me the regular ones work then the other hacked that you need to use mnf server dont really open up if you foward and backward it you can see some stuff but thats about it let me know if you have any fix thank you
,Cunz,2011-04-28T22:32Z,"right click the mnfserver and run as administrator, it should redirect u to the meetandfuckgames page but with all the games there for u to choose"

,Deadlyron,2011-05-07T19:28Z,"Hi all, I know how to run the unhacked ones with the server, however, can't run all the others. What do I have to do? Got Google Chrome and 7-Zip, may sound noobie, but help?!"
,renhoek3,2011-05-08T02:49Z,"@Deadlyron

Just double-click one of the flash files. When Windows asks you in what program to open it, select Chrome. The browser will start up with the game.

In case of the games with both a main flash file and a -prldr file, start the -prldr one."
,Deadlyron,2011-05-08T16:06Z,"I sincerely thank you for your awesome help! Obvious and clear!

I'd almost love you, but that'll be fag! So thanks mate"
,partime,2011-05-10T02:07Z,"Ok so i got the hacked ones to work, but when i click on the mnfserver11 application i set the user profile to Administrator but it asks for a password am i doing something wrong or can someone tell me the password, either way any help would be appreciated "
,spuncher,2011-05-10T09:20Z,"Run server with administrative rights, then open up chrome in ""incognito mode"", close all the other browsers, and normal chrome, type www.meetandfuckgames.com in the address bar in incognito window, voila..."
,partime,2011-05-17T15:49Z,"thank you for the help spuncher, i got chrome and tried it in incognito mode and it worked better but i still am confused on the run as administrator, i am the computer admin account, and opening it doesn't work, and when i click run as and then select admin it says i need a password, any help again would be appreciated "
,TaurenHunter,2011-05-19T20:31Z,"Can someone please help? I've got all but the ""protected"" games to work in google chrome. I ran the mnfserver as administrator and it will show the screen with all of the games. but when I click on any of the games it shows the loading but then its just a blank screen."

,belac96,2011-09-06T00:10Z,"help, i'm using a mac, and i don't know how to run the server."
,LightSpawn,2011-09-26T18:32Z,"So, I'm having the same problem as the other users with the Protected files. The First time I tried to run ""mnfserver11"", it said that it can't edit the hosts, and to do it myself. I did that and I tried to run it again. This time it said ""Redirecting 'www.meetandfuckgames.com' to your local machine.
Redirection already in place, no further action needed, continuing.

Error - Unable to listen on port 80. Are you already running a webserver on
this machine? (Possibly IIS?) Please stop that program before restarting
this program

You can try this command in a command shell to see what's on that port:
 netstat -abn""
I did the ""netstat -abn"" thing, and under port 80 it said ""Can not obtain ownership information"".

What the fuck?
Any help is appreciated."
,ak4712gauge,2011-12-22T06:14Z,"I know I'm a noob, don't really care, but could somebody e-mail me how to do everything? (not download it, i got that, but how to open it.)"
,SketchX,2012-01-02T08:04Z,too all noobs in order to play the games either run the server as an admin and then play normally or use your internet browser to play the actual files
,chrizumaan,2012-01-04T18:17Z,i tried wath cunz said. open a icnognito-window with chrome. works perfectly fine.
,Kellipoth,2012-01-08T20:56Z,"Glorify me! I had the same problem as the most of you guys (i assume) after i tried quit a while i finally got it!
1. download torrent 
2. the folder ""Protected(run mnfserver to play)"" has to be moved to the folder of your internetbrowser.
in my case i moved this folder to the folder: ""google""--> ""Chrome""-->""Application"" (depends on your internetbrowser!)
3.run ""mnfserver11"" as admin 

after the third step your browser shall open with the site www.meetandfuckgames.com there you got a the whole games voila!
dont forget jerking kills your breaincalls >."
,snakebit101,2012-01-21T10:16Z,"beautiful work love this shit n yes u will go blind if u, well u guys no the rest, anyway i had the same prob as everybody else n all the comments help a lot but iv still got just 1, i get 2 my browser with protected 1s n alls gd just doesn't load please help signed the last 1  "
,TeflonMike,2012-01-28T02:14Z,"Have tried all the suggestions here and still can't get the protected games to work with ""mnfserver11'  Have tried with firefox, ie, chrome and a standalone swf player ..  Any suggestions anyone? "
,Mithrans,2012-02-14T16:15Z,"Ok! i got it to work, all i had to do was to go to the host file, right click, property, Uncheck 'read only' run mnfserver11 :)"
,cl1ck,2012-03-03T04:01Z,"I dont know why but i ran mnfserver as admin. and i get to the page correctly, but when i try to click on the game it reads: The requested flash file /files/flash/star-slut-prldr.swf was not found in the current directory. What do i do???? please respond..."
,DraculaGamer13,2012-03-27T02:28Z,"Can anyone tell me how to run the already hacked ones? The ones that don't need mnfserver. Whenever I open the swf files with firefox is just asks me to open or save it, like I was performing a download. If I click open, its just goes back to the same menu. "
