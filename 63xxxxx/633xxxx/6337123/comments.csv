http://unity3d.com/unity/
Now to find the addon packs, if anyone finds any, please lets the rest of us know. Cheers."

Sorry if it's taking time, connections here in London, UK, even if you make unlimited internet package. Sky Broadband is not that fast compared to Virgin Media. Sorry again."

1. Install Unity

2. Unzip Unity.zip to your installed dir/Editor  (c:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\)
   (overwrite)

3. Start Unity and Select Manual Activation
   Click on Read License and point to the one supplied in Crack dir (UnityLicence.ilf)

4. Enjoy!

Not sure to be honest. If you do decide to update the crack and has a problem afterwards, download again. If there's no problem, spread the word. 

By the way, seed please. Thanks."

,Mobius96,2011-07-22T07:38Z,"I'm running Windows Vista Ultimate32bit.
Copied all the files into the C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor and I followed the instructions that were provided. The CRACK doesn't work!

I click on the exe file that included with the crack, it ask me to register. I click on manual, read license. I get the following error message: "" The file does not contain valid license and cannot be used."" I've been fucking around with this for the last 20 mins and read the other comments? WTF I'm doing wrong? This is s really pissing me off!!!

PLEASE HELP! "
