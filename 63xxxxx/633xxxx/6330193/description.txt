Blitzen Trapperâ€™s offering is the sub-two-minute â€œMaybe Baby,â€ a short and sweet pop nugget that consolidates the bandâ€™s characteristic twangy vocals and catchy guitar work into a neat, head-nodding, toe-tapping package thatâ€™s perfect for summer. Itâ€™s over before you know it, but that just makes it easier to replay infinity times. Check out â€œMaybe Babyâ€ and b/w ''Soul Singer''
