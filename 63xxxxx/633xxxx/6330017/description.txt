The plot follows the story of Zona Zamfirova (Katarina Radivojevic), a local rich man's daughter, and the vicissitudes of her affair with Mane (Vojin Cetkovic), an ordinary goldsmith. As it was undesirable for the daughter of a rich man to marry a craftsman, the two are at first divided, with the possibility of Zona marrying the son of other rich people, Manulac. Everything is, however, changed as Mane organizes a successful conspiracy to keep Zona for himself.
