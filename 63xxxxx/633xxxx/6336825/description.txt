Ch4 A Harlots Progress HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2006

In 1731 the artist William Hogarth produced a graphic series of paintings that lifted the lid on 18th-century vice and established his enduring reputation as a remarkable social satirist and the greatest British artist of his day. With a cast including Toby Jones, ZoÃ« Tapper, Sophie Thompson, Geraldine James and Richard Wilson, A Harlot's Progress depicts Hogarth's exploration of - and intimate relationship with - sex trafficking and debauchery in Georgian London.
