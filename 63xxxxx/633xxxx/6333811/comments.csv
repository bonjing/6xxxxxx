,Sinthyses,2011-04-21T21:23Z,"Awesomesauce, been waiting for this with baited breath. Just so you know, I've tried the cracked personalbrain.jar and the keygen with the pc version of 6.0.7.0 and it seems to be working although I'm still testing it so try this at your own risk. "
,philipca,2011-04-23T18:55Z,Having difficulties with the keygen.  I've unzipped the file but can't find it.  Help would be appreciated.  Many thanks.
,philipca,2011-04-23T19:56Z,Got it sorted now - not sure what I was doing wrong!!  Many thanks to the uploader for this.
[V],polisdavid,2011-04-23T22:21Z,"philipca,

Make sure you don't use the key generated file that's i the archive, run that .jar program press generate, and then save the new keygen file to your desktop."
,justeunautre,2011-05-03T02:35Z,How do you do the overwriting thing in step 3?
,justeunautre,2011-05-03T03:52Z,"In stop 4, how do you proceed to use pb.jar as a keygen? "
,nutella59,2011-06-04T21:49Z,Can you please give clearer instructions?
,SpecialAgentFoxMulder,2011-06-14T11:08Z,"The keymaker and replacement .jar appear to work just fine for the Windows version.  

So far so good : ) Thanks a bunch"
,nutella59,2011-06-19T10:04Z,PLS. clearer instructions for Mac :-)
,joeltang,2011-09-29T22:13Z,is this install able on windows?  this looks like it's for a mac.  I was able to extract the dmg file with poweriso but windows can make heads or tails out of any of these files.  Help!
,MooTheKoo,2011-10-07T21:43Z,"NICE! Have been hunting for a working crack for the Mac version forever... THANKS!

Just one question - the keygen includes a ""patch"" function. Anyone got this to work with one of the newer versions? I tried it with the latest 6.0.7.5 and the patcher tells me ""failed"" after working for some time, generated license files are not accepted... Any workaround or chance to get updates on this? "
,pooterdoc,2011-10-08T18:12Z,could someone clearly explain how to install for windows?  Thanks
,naimed,2012-02-11T17:44Z,How do i execute Step 3 on a Mac? The .jar.zip file opens without producing any jar files. Also when I double click a .class file nothing happens. This is a great program I would be grateful for any help to make it work ...
,Texan46,2012-03-17T07:28Z,"This is one of the world's great programs, in spite of being written in Java.  I installed it on Win XP 6 months ago - runs great.  I made my own install notes:

1. Install by running PersonalBrain_windows_6_0_7_1.exe

2. Copy PersonalBrain.jar into the install directory, overwriting the file installed there.

3. Use the ""keygen"" pb.jar (java must be installed), enter your name and click generate.
4.  Save license file ""BrainActivation.bract"" to your desktop.

IGNORE THE PATCH BUTTON.

5. Block or disconnect from Internet.

6. Start PersonalBrain,
   goto Help -> Upgrade to PersonalBrian Core or Pro Edition,
   Click ""Locate Activation File"". 
Select the previously generated file (Brainactivation.bract) and you're done.

That should help.  I'm Hoping someone will pick up the Brain 7 when it comes out of Beta."
