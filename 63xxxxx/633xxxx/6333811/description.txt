This truly wondrous program can organize your thoughts and brainstorming into a coherent package with Images,Web page content, and Text.

PersonalBrain Pro is a tool for collecting and organizing thoughts, files, and webpages into a coherent framework called a â€œbrain.â€ Just as important as the thoughts themselves are the relationships between them, and unlike most other organization tools, PersonalBrain avoids imposing external rules or structure on your brain.

There's a lot of connections in your head, but unfortunately sometimes they don't last. With PersonalBrain, your digital Brain captures all that intelligence for playback just when you need it.

With PersonalBrain you're never more than a few seconds away from any piece of digital information. Web pages, documents, images, notes... From people and projects to ideas and task lists, it's all there in an instant.

Take control by visualizing all your open loops, tasks, and ideas in your PersonalBrain. Syncs makes your ideas and to dos available from your desktop, web browser, or mobile device anytime.
