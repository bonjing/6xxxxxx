,MrDouglas,2011-05-12T01:06Z,"Ok, once again (this is the last post, I swear!), found what's really going on:

""Bad news for chef/TV personality Jamie Oliver.

ABC has pulled the the Ryan Seacrest-produced reality series, Jamie Oliverâ€™s Food Revolution, from the schedule during May sweeps.

The show, which follows Oliver as he tries to change the way kids and adults eat at home and in school, will air its four remaining episodes beginning Friday, June 3 at 9 p.m.

ABC says the Dancing With the Stars recap was a better complement to the DWTS results show on Tuesday nights, though emphasizes it is still behind the anti-junk food series. The network had pre-empted the third episode of Food Revolution for a DWTS-related hour last week.

Food Revolution has dropped in the ratings in its second season, with the premiere slipping nearly 40 percent from last year's series debut."""

stop eating so much junk in your school!"
,PhilLesh12,2011-05-19T02:41Z,"@Daff-e-Duck,

There's a core group of Americans, about 30% of them, that are completely ignorant and follow rather than think for themselves.

Unfortunately, that 30% watches network prime time TV, 24 hour cable news channels and MTV.  They prefer to have other people think for them, which makes them victims of the profit-motive junk food corporations who spend ad dollars on DWTS and other inane mindless entertainment.

The silent majority of Americans are actually pretty smart and self-aware.  They just tend to keep their mouths shut, so the bottom-feeding 30% get all the attention and everyone assumes that all americans are like those fat, poorly educated nutjobs.   (they also listen to a lot of screaming radio talk show hosts, so they hate people who don't have white skin)"
,AylaMM,2011-05-19T19:19Z,"That's fucking insane. Is there a petition or something similar that someone could create/link to so that the producers see that there are a lot of people who are intereste and want to see the show live on? 
It's annoying that I can't add to the ratings on the show by watching it on their own website etc. considering I live in Sweden. I mean, just imagine how many people would watch it on their own site instead of downloading it and the number of viewers they'd receive to show the REAL number of viewers. GAH."
