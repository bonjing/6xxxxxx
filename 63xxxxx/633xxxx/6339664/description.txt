NOTE: While this program offers none of the flexibility and complexity in image management the CS5 Bridge does, it does process so unique qualities if two or more photographs are taken in similar lighting and position setting.  THere is even an HDP Pro Photoshop merge program, that you can find under annotate that reveals this uniqueness.
