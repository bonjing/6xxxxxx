I messed up with some code on the first attempt. My son found the error when he started a new character and it has been fixed. Sorry about that.

Anyone that has played Fallout 3 using cheats knows it is a pain in the ass to type in all the crap at the console. This is a way to get the mods with only one console command. These are just my favorites. You can modify the test.txt file to whatever you want.

This has been tested and confirmed to work on Fallout 3 GOTY edition released by Unleashed
