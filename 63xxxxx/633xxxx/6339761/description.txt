Description:
How do you move monstrous mammals, enormous elephants, restless 
rhinos, hefty horses and speedy sharks?  You call in the services of 
the big movers.  These larger than life characters are working with 
the ultimate delivery deadline - their cargo must arrive on time, 
intact....and alive. Follow specialist teams of animal movers, vets and 
transport engineers as they attempt to relocate animals across the 
globe by air and road in new episodes of Animal Mega Moves.

Rhinos
In a bid to protect the majestic black rhino from the brink of
extinction, a plan has been hatched to move a breeding population
back to a reserve in Zambia, where they had been poached to
extinction in years past.  In a dangerous journey for all involved,
a team loads five rhinos onto a cargo aircraft and takes these huge
creatures 1,000 miles across Africa.
