This movie is set in the not so distant future of Los Angeles. The economy has gone bankrupt and Los Angeles has been over-run with violence, drugs and gang warfare. Corey Haim plays Griffin, who earns his living delivering pizzas while he tries to take care of his little brother. An old friend of his, Gary Lee, is the leader of a para-military gang pushing drugs, the Rollerboys. Gary joins them to help the police keep track of them.
