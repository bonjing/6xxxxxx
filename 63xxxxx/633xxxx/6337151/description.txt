From the Infowars web site ::

Alex talks with businessman and candidate for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in the 2012 election, Gary Johnson. He is the former governor of New Mexico, serving two terms. During his tenure, he followed strictly to an anti-tax, anti-bureaucracy program. In 2009, he founded the Our America Initiative, a nonprofit political advocacy committee promoting common-sense business approaches to governing. He announced his candidacy for the presidency on April 21, 2011. 


Alex also talks with regular Friday guest, Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster. 


Veteran newspaper reporter and Bilderberg sleuth Jim Tucker presents breaking news on Kissinger's push for ground troops in Libya.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
