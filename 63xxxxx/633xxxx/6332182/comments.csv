,pryingeyes,2011-04-21T18:55Z,"There's very little point to DLing 3.5 gigs through a torrent, including apps you may not need, when the individual apps are readily available at high speed from the Adobe website. Then all you need is the keygen from this site, which is a very small file."
,pryingeyes,2011-04-21T20:42Z,"Once again, people...THINK for a minute. The individual apps are available for free downloads from Adobe, and then all you need to do is download the very small keygen file from TPB. So it's your choice: download 3.5 gigs including files you don't need, with one seeder and 150 leechers (so you'll be here for a week), or go to adobe, download what you need at far, far higher speeds, and then download the keygen from this site in less than a minute.

Your choice..."
,NaZa75,2011-04-22T12:13Z,"I'm sorry but i'm not agree with you guys ! CyberPiraten always do great job and also have links for the individual software. Most of the time he have a lot of seeders ( look at the other torrent he have ) and i can download it as fast as on adobe website.
CyberPiraten always put a file with all the instructions too. 
So if you want the all Creative Suite downloaded at one time thats a good option.

Anyway you can't blame someone who do great job and give free stuff to people !

Keep on going CyberPiraten ! Thanks for the good job !"
,Hedkandi006,2011-04-26T11:25Z,"Hello Mate,
thanks for making Adobe Creative Suite CS5 Premium for Mac available. I have downloaded everything successfully. Following the instructions I have installed Creative suit, but It asked me for a serial number straight away ( other than in your instructions) I put the first from your after Effects No's in, which was accepted. 
Than I opened up Terminal and copied sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts into Terminal. Nothing happens. When I press return/enter a warning window pops up, about inappropriate use of Terminal. You instruct to paste all the Numbers shown in the instructions in-between  127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255 
    broadcasthost .

These numbers do not show up in terminal, so I don't understand where to paste them. Could you please explain ? Sorry to bug you, but I have know idea of all this ,-(

Your help would be very much appreciated, need to do work tonight and need photoshop desperatley.  Cheers, A."

I went to look for serial numbers in Google and just copied and pasted that one. And it worked. One thing I have to tell you, after you put in Terminal the line ""sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts"" PRESS ENTER. Then after that it asks you for a password. Type in your computer password without making any mistakes since it won't show you what you type. After you put in the password, PRESS ENTER. It will open the ""Host"" file thing where you can paste the entire file Cyberpiraten has named: ""This is how your host file should look"" Paste everything in that file in your host file exactly as is. Then (command s) save. Then open one of the programs and enter that serial or maybe another that can work for you. I did have to create an Adobe ID --- course was my hotmail account and a fake name.

I was having the same problem as you. Just upgraded to LION and got the same ""error"" message. I'm in no way a computer genius like most of these people. I know how to follow these directions and search the net, that's about it. 

the solution I came across (somebody can tell me if this is legit or not):

in terminal type in sudo pico /etc/hosts and hit Return
this should bring up a nano that looks exactly like what Cyberpiraten has in his instructions. Copy and paste to look exactly like the he mentions in his .rtf file.
Hit Ctrl O to save.

I had the same problem with the adobe ID.. I installed it with a serial number and an adobe ID I made, restarted my computer, run the hosts and when I opened any of the programs it would come up with the serial number, then prompt me for my adobe id again.. I'd put it in and it wouldn't work. It couldn't access my subscription?
Annoying.

Just so happened I had previously downloaded CORE keygen for CS5. I opened up CORE, patched the program and generated a serial number. I put in this serial number and it worked. I opened the next program and it asked me for adobe ID again, which it allowed me to just skip and no problems since! 

Hope this helps those with the same problems..

Thanks so much cyberpiraten for your awesome torrents and activation blockers.. Before downloading your dreamweaver torrent I had never done any torrent stuff before and it was so easy (once I googled what terminal was!! HAHA). You're a legend!"
,CrystalBella89,2011-08-14T11:21Z,"Hey guys,

I had the ADOBE ID problem.

I got the torrent & ran the dmg file.
I installed adobe creative suite using a serial number and an adobe ID I had made. 
I restarted my computer & ran the hosts.

When I opened the first program, it came up with a screen asking if I wanted to use the serial number or trial. I put in the serial in and continued. It then asked for my adobe ID which I put in. Then it tried to authorize it, which didn't work of course. Came up with the error ""cannot begin your subscription"" or something like that.

I read through here and realised I probably shouldn't have put in the serial number when installing.. OOPS. But I really didnt want to uninstall and begin again..

SO

I had previously downloaded CORE keygen for CS5. I can't remember where I got that torrent, but I can look for it. 

I opened CORE up and clicked on 'patch program' and then generated a serial number for creative suite 5. 

When I opened up a program I put this new serial number in, and it worked.. didn't ask me for an adobe ID.

I opened the next program and up it came asking for an adobe ID.. (crap!) BUT it had a skip button on the bottom.. so I skipped and TA-DA! 

No problems since and complete access to all the programs.

Hope this may help someone else out there.

A big big big thankyou to cyberpiraten for the awesome torrents.. before downloading your dreamweaver one yesterday I hadn't done torrent stuff before that had worked (a part from CORE which I had no programs to use it on!). You are a legend, and how you do the activation blockers is beyond me, but THANKYOU!!!!!!!!!! :)"

,mayo1984,2011-08-25T12:45Z,"Hi Cyberpiraten and anyone else, 

I can't find the 'Terminal' application, so I wont be able to open it and paste the text in it. I have no idea. Can you explain it to me in 'baby-ga-ga language' because I'm not doing this very often!

This is what I did untill now: 
1.  Clicked Adobe CS5 Design Premium. 
2. Click: Install (this took me about 25 minutes or so)
3. Click: Accept
4.  Fill in Serialnumber/ trial (I chose the first one  in the instructions.rtf file)
5. Then Adobe is checking my account and gives me the option: 'make an Apple ID' or 'fill in your e-mail'. I tried to skip this option but it doesn't work. I choose to add an Apple ID with a fake emailadress. (because I can't do anything else!)
6.  I installed every program in my applications folder.

 I couldn't find the 'TERMINAL' application at first, because you won't see it untill you installed. 
7. If I try 'home-icon' > applications (it's an empty folder)
8. If I try Macintosh HD > Program >texteditor (this looked like textedit.app but I got nothing)
9. or Macintosh HD > program > Applescripteditor. (nothing too)
10. or Macintosh HD >program >Helpprogram > Terminal ??? Is this it?
11. So I opened the Terminal black box. 
12. Then you say: â€œPaste the the following text between 127.0.0.1 localhost and 255.255.255.255 broadcasthostâ€ Well..there is no such thing as localhost and broadcasthost to find in the Terminal. 

9. You say: Run Adobe After Effects. There is no After Effects? So...I opened Illustrator, to try.
10.  Enter serial number. (chose the one from the top. It worked.)
11. Then you'll get: Enter your Adobe ID. I tried option 1: skip it. (doesn't work) option 2: entered my fake ID. 
12. Adobe says: â€œTry againâ€. We are unable to start your supscription for adobe creative suite 5 Design Premium blabla. Choose close and re-launche your product. 

The end. Can you help me please? It would be awsome. I googled my ass off to find out how to make this work! Thanks a lot. "
,Pratox,2011-09-05T13:23Z,"Hi There,

I was successful in installing this release.
However, I used a sightly different method to make it work:

1. When installing, unplug you ethernet cable or shut the wifi down.
2. Install with a Key (whichever)
3. Open the finder and on the ""Go"" menu select ""Go to Folder"". In the box, tip ""/etc/""
4. A Finder window window should open showing lotta files. Scroll down until you find ""host""
5. Copy the host file to the desktop
6. Edit it as mentioned in the instruction file (127.0.01 xxx)
7. Rename the original host file by whatever you'd like (ex: old.host) -> It will ask you for permission and you'll have to enter your admin password
8. Drag & Drop the modified host file (the one on the desktop) to the finder (it will again prompt for password)

We have followed the instructions to a T and for some reason when it gets to the point where we have to put in serial numbers it gets fishy.

After the serial is accepted it requests an Adobe ID... we've entered an old one and also created a NEW one and for some reason it keeps telling us to ""TRY AGAIN We are unable to start your subscription for Adobe (blah blah blah).""

,marquisdupre,2011-10-02T22:24Z,"Ok, I have downloaded each of these from adobe.com separately because I don't need or want the entire package - and have followed directions on installation as a trial, etc. Everything worked fine, but upon a restart, now all of my downloaded applications ask for a password again, and an apple ID and then when I put in a valid number and apple ID, it says it cannot start my subscription! I have seen others posting, but no solutions on how to bypass this and have it stop asking for my serial number. I used the blocker and everything worked find until I restarted my computer.

,gizzmoony,2011-10-16T23:46Z,"Downloaded and installed without any problems and it starts working like magic typing the first posted password. But after a few logins, it tells you the password is not valid. I am gonna try the other passwords see what happens..."
,gizzmoony,2011-10-17T16:12Z,Ok. It works. Second serial number on the list made it happen. Thanks Cyberpiraten. Great job. 
,bpdingo,2011-10-21T20:55Z,"many thanks Cyberpiraten!

the easiest way to crack (OSX Lion especially) is with the CORE Keygen.  Follow the read me.txt file and you will have a completely working CS5 without editing any files in Terminal, which in OSX Lion's case won't even work.

,ej1616,2011-12-11T01:51Z,"Ugh. Man, I can't get this to work.  Tried everything suggested in previous posts:

I uninstalled all adobe products and used an adobe cleanup tool to remove all adobe files.

Then I installed this.  I used the KeyGen patch, then the keygen serial. The serial works, but then it asks for an adobe ID.  I've tried making a new one as well as using an old one I've had and none of them work.  

How do I get it to skip the Adobe ID?

I've also tried the serial numbers in this torrent, but they also get the Adobe ID required and I can't by it.

Any ideas?

,FlyDread,2012-02-10T02:33Z,"Hey Thanks a Billion Bro for everything. I just have a Question or 2. I don't Know if Im doing something extremely wrong or extremely right. 

Let me start by saying i first got photoshop through some elses torrents through a lot of trial and error. I once Got a program named Blockade. It was supposed to Block adobe from connecting to my cpu. Now When i Downloaded Your torrent, I Don't see any Terminal.app to follow the rest of the steps. I simply install and then put in the 1st serial number. It works every time. 

Now Am i supposed to be doing something after i get the app because i tested a few it runs fine. is it my Blockade thats making this work without Steps 4, 5, and 6 or am i at Risk"
