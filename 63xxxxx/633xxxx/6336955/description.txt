Foolish Heart is a series of interconnected stories of love and betrayal. Minor background characters from one episode turn out to be major characters in others, and no one actor appears in all 6 episodes (although Sarah Strange is seen in 5 of them, and is heard as an uncredited off-camera voice in the remaining show). The characters listed above as regulars all appeared in at least 3 of the show's 6 episodes.

The series aims for the feel of an anthology show, as individual episodes range from anguished dramas to flat out comic surrealism. As well, the reappearance of writer/director/star Ken Finkleman's "George Findlay" character marks "Foolish Heart" as a sequel of sorts to his earlier shows "The Newsroom" and "More Tears", though there's no real on-screen attempt to explicitly link these shows together.
