,Yawako,2011-04-27T13:21Z,Weird.. I'm stuck I loaded this game via Softchip under 3.2u system menu with IOS 57 v5661 the game seems to be working fine but in early mission after I switch the 3 Primer then go outside the lobby for the crane but I can go any further.
,Yawako,2011-04-27T13:22Z,Cant go any further I mean
,Yawako,2011-04-28T08:07Z,"Nevermind I think its seems an error in my cheap game disc I now pass that damned gate after restarting it many times and the game is playable under 3.2u even via Disc Channel.

I updated this game to play online where does the data installed was it in my SD or in the built in Wii mem?"
,str112571,2011-04-29T02:45Z,after you update did it work online black ops says the same thing but dont trust it.
,Yawako,2011-05-01T15:58Z,"This game works online but my Wii random hangs really dont know whats causing it and in Mission Im stuck in Siberia, one of the door wont open. Its likely that this game was a bad rip or my DVD disc is bad. Anyways if you dont wanna waste some disc go get the other release

,xlos_crudos4x,2011-08-19T21:25Z,Seed please! :)
,xlos_crudos4x,2011-08-20T18:50Z,Took all day to download this. and when I try to load it into wbfs manager. It gives me an error saying it can't read it. Waste of time downloading....Anyone have any solutions? I think the file is corrupt....I might just delete it. I don't i've ever had an error like this
,xlos_crudos4x,2011-08-20T21:11Z,Never mind got it to work. It wouldn't open on wbfs manager because I was seeding it. I stopped seeding it for that moment and it worked. Thanks
,LymphN0de,2012-04-18T20:01Z,Needs more seeds. There is only 2 at the moment and uploading only about 5 kbps... Guess I'll have to wait a whole week...
