FULL 20 Minute workout, not included in Complete set...

Normally, and with the other torrents of this online, there is five minutes of bullshit at the beginning, and ten minutes of ads at the end. 

I removed all that, so it starts just before the workout, and ends when the workout ends. 

ENJOY!
