Good quality rip.  There are some parts of the movie in Italian so you must open the english subtitles.  To do this go to open file in VLC and browse for the movie file.  Then check the upload subtitle box and browse for the subtitle .srt file."
,mgd37,2011-05-14T14:27Z,Thanks. 
,tabbyann22,2011-05-23T08:48Z,how do i attach the sub titles to the movie so when i play it in my dvd player i have them
,boomboomroom,2011-05-26T22:22Z,"got an email from ISP, beware this torrent is tagged"
,mdf_karawang,2011-05-27T03:42Z,"@tabbyann22 

The name of movie file and subtitle must same. 
For example : 
- Movie file = The Rite[2011]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.avi
- Subtitle = The Rite[2011]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.srt
In this torrent just rename The Rite[Eng][Subs].srt to The Rite[2011]DvDrip[Eng]-FXG.srt, and you are good togo.

or

Do it the hard way, add permanent subtitles, but I won't recommend it, not an easy task.
However Auto Gordian Knot can do it for you.
Also there are a lot of similar applications, just google it."
