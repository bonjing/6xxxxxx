I took the liberty to start sharing under the TQMP label. I did so for two reasons: 1) because I downloaded quite a lot of your african jewels these last weeks and I really wanted to contribute ""in return"", and 2) because I read something written by one of your project fellow that left me under the impression that participation to TQMP was totally open and that there was no formal process to join.

Please let me know if I was right making this assumption and, anyway, thank you a few dozen times for your effort to widen our musical spectrum!"

He seems to have taken a break. But I keep going. Preaching to the choir/ So yeah, welcome aboard. As they say, it's an open bar. Or in my case, a coffee shop in Amsterdam ;)"

Too bad for Breezin, he had some really good stuff to share.... But I guess we have to pull ourselves together and take over the educational mission :)

By the way, feel free to ask me for music: considering the amount of stuff you uploaded I was interested in, I feel like we might have some tastes in common..."
