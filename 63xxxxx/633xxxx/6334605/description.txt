Hello... This is my first torrent upload




I found this program on google giving me an alternative in activating Mass Effect\'s DLC\'s because the program \"giveme2entitlements_v2.exe\" doesn\'t work for me as I have a dsl connection. It allows the user to select the network they currently use as in my case.

This program is not mine!







Instruction: (What I did)

1.)Download the program (in google if you don\'t trust this)

2.)open and then select your network (It will create a file named \"BioPersistentEntitlementCache\" located in my case in *...\\User\\Documents\\BioWare\\Mass Effect 2\\BIOGame\\Config\\...)
 
3.)done



P.S. If you used the program \"giveme2entitlements_v2.exe prior into using this I suggest that you delete the file \"BioPersistentEntitlementCache\" first



Special Thanks To:
The maker of the program... I\'m sorry I\'m unable to get your name
