   Gardiens de l'ordre (2010)

  During a routine night patrol, police officer Bastien, his long-term 
  partner Julie and the newcomer cop Simon are called out by a neighbor 
  complaining of the noise in another apartment. Bastien knocks the door 
  and out of the blue, the dweller opens the door and shoots him in the 
  chest. Julie shoots the man who is high on drugs and apprehends a strange 
  fluorescent yellow drug. They soon learn that the man is the son of a 
  politician, and they are forced to sign a statement saying that the 
  shooting was accidental. When the man recovers in the hospital, he sues 
  the police officers and the police department does not support them. 
  However, their chief tells them that they should find the trafficker that 
  sold the drugs to the man. So Julie and Simon go undercover to the 
  underworld of drugs.
