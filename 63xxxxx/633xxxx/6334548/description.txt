Product Description
Modern French Grammar is an innovative new practical reference grammar, combining traditional and function-based grammar in a single volume. It is the ideal reference work for intermediate and advanced learners of the language. The Grammar is divided into two parts. The first, concise section covers traditional grammatical categories such as word order, nouns, verbs and adjectives. The second (and more extensive) section is carefully organised around language functions and notions such as:
* giving and seeking information
* putting actions into context
* expressing likes, dislikes and preferences
* comparing objects and actions
Written by an two experienced teachers and academics, the emphasis is on contemporary usage. Particular attention is paid to indexing and cross-referencing across two sections. Students will find the grammar invaluable throughout their career with the language from `first-aid' to professional use.
This book revives learners' enthusiasm for grammar through an easily accessible, example-driven format and a pragmatic approach that complements today's teaching practices.
