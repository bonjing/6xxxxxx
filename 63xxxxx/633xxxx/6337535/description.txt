Imagine took a german tagged video which is really the old russian video with dubbed german audio, surely by mistake
The Real German Bluray has a very good quality unlike the russian one
Here is a quick comparison between the russian and the german bluray 1:1 http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/46064

The Intro and language at the introduction is also different
The russian bluray begins with "constantin film presents Animals united"
The German bluray begins with "constantin film p sentiert Konferenz der Tiere"

anyway, new video, far better quality
looks amazing now

enjoy http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1620449/
