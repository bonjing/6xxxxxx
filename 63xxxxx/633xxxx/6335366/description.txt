- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

  "Becoming a staple in the diet of any post-hardcore fan, Silverstein have
  returned with their fifth studio full-length, Rescue. Finally off Victory,
  it's time for them to hit the scene hard and get the recognition they've
  needed for years now. It fills all the necessities and expectations of a
  post-hardcore record: melodic chorus', gruff breakdowns, and adorable clean
  sections. But what has always set Silverstein apart since day one has been
  their punk and hardcore influences (on the re-release of Discovering The
  Waterfront, they covered Lifetime's "Rodeo Clown"), and Rescue sees this take
  charge a lot more. Coupling the signature sound they've developed with their
  punk background, Rescue is a full palette of beautiful colors, waiting to be
  painted on your ears.

  Covering all their bases, "Forget Your Heart" and "Intervention" have the
  structure and dynamic of Silverstein songs you've been hearing since When
  Broken is Easily Fixed. Clean lines with a tinge of reverb and chorus, chunky,
  mid-2000s metalcore riffs, and the dichotomy of the sing/scream dynamic
  executed with precision. What "Intervention" brings to the table, along with
  "Medication" and "Burning Hearts," is the classic, fast punk d-beat to the
  rhythm section. It pushes the verses on at a quick tempo that requires a heavy
  amount of head bobbing, and perhaps a bit of air drumming. This direct punk
  influence laces into many of the sections flawlessly like Silverstein has
  never done before. The songwriting and transitions are the best they've had
  thus far.

  Beyond the punk influence, "The Artist" plays out like a new-age hardcore
  track and features Brendon Murphy of Counterparts. On the harder edge of
  things, the intro to "Live to Kill" screams "We live to kill each other. We
  are the wealthy and the poor" completely a'capella that gives the opening some
  serious energy to feed off of. The dynamics are played well throughout by not
  clustering the melodic and harder songer together, but spreading them out
  giving it a roller coaster feel.

  Unlike the newest wave of super over-produced post-hardcore acts,
  Silverstein's Rescue may have one of my favorite productions I've heard in
  years. The levels are perfect as the bass bleeds into the mix to uphold some
  of the heavier riffs, but is given room to move and be heard during the
  slower, cleaner part. The snare and bass contrast perfectly with neither
  sounding too crisp and the cymbals sustain out perfectly without overtaking
  the mix when they ring out or cut off too early when they need to be silenced.
  The guitars hold the thick crunch from their Orange and VHT amps known for
  that tone and are shaped nicely into the mix.

  There's a very easy recognition of Silverstein's veteran status and that
  they're not going anywhere soon. Rescue reshapes Silverstein's best attributes
  into a post-hardcore juggernaut and continues to cement their lasting value
  and impact on modern music. While not the most progressive of pieces, the
  record is a testament to Silverstein's ability to reinvent themselves in
  interesting ways."
