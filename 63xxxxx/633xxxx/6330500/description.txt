Reaching outside the Eastern parameters of his work with pioneering 
Indonesian garage rockers Macha, Josh McKay casts a new and thoroughly narcotic vibe for himself under the Seaworthy moniker. Delivered as something resembling a song cycle, this collection of material blends equal parts organic and electronic elements to create a hypnotic vibe throughout. Beginning with the massive riff work underpinning the "Open the Gates" instrumental, the equally powerful slow drive of "I Met Her in the Candy Store" is offset by the entrance of McKay's soft vocals. The guest vocal work of avant Japanese vocalist Haco on "The Day" is a logical, but well-played addition to the roster of lush sounds. But it's dreamy tracks like "Sea Manta" and the brief "In Anticipation Of" that help keep The Ride aloft as a truly modern end-to-end listening experience. Mixed and mastered under reportedly pressing circumstances, the album not only stands on its own as a solo project but as another testament to McKay's deft visions in sound.
