Notes:  Comes with a booklet ! Made out of four sources to achieve completeness and best listening pleasure. 
  
 Concert:  This show belongs to the best our man ever gave ! It was the last one from a tour full of superlatives. All shows were sold out immediately and often extra shows had to be added to fulfill the ticket demand. The repertoire was excellent and Elvis and band were in high spirits. The crowd went crazy as soon as Elvis entered the stage and moved his little finger ! So sit down and enjoy a fantastic show with no weak spot. One of the best versions of Suspicious Minds, You Gave Me A Mountain, Memphis, Tennessee or What Now My Love belong to the highlights ! (Ciscoking)

With cover. Enjoy!
