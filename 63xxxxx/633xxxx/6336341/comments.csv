Can't thank you enough for your torrents - best source of classic films on TPB.

I've started ripping out my own DVD collection for uploading and have been experimenting with my X264 settings to finetune my rips. I'm pretty happy with the results but was wondering how you determine optimal bitrate. Also, do you use a different setting when dealing with high-grain sources? Some of the transfers from the thirties are bloody abysmal...

As I'm sure you put no shortage of work figuring this out I can understand if your answer to my question is 'pound sand' but I thought I'd ask...

Thanks again for your hard work."
[T],kriss_kringle,2011-04-22T22:02Z,"Hey there,thanks for the compliment.I use Megui and I have an option called bitrate calculator and I choose what bitrate I want the movie to have and it calculates the size of it.Also I'm using the AVCHD profile.Hope that helps,if you still have questions leave them in the comment.Peace!"
