All information was put onto the files so when added to iTunes all information will be preset (except full artist (featuring artists)list which will be in name)
EX: when looking at artist on list you will come up with Eminem not Eminem,Denaun Porter,Jeff Bass,Mark Bass but on song title it will have Backstabber f/ Denaun Porter
