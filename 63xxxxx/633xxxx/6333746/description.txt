My First Album Torrent And What Better Album To Start With Than... 

           ~The Wombats Proudly Present... This Modern Glitch~



I'm not quite sure how you're meant to rip these albums and i was going to use 
Audiograbber 1.83 but that would mean i would have to add the tags in manually because the album isn't on freedb so i have opted to use the itunes import using the mp3 encoder. Don't panic its 320kbps and VBR with the quality on high.

The other torrents for this album are all fakes so i decided to go one better and buy the album and share it with my fellow sailors. 

Hope you enjoy this release seed, comment then buy it.
