I'm actually surprised that there are so many seeders. I'm perfecting my German as I have a German missus and am working in a German environment. Are there any other reasons to learn it? Money and hot German girls, that's basically it. 

Anywho, thanks again. "

I was trying to look up to Dutch and French Learning Package in your page but I couldn't see through all your uploads, only those in the first page, and it didn't contain Dutch or French :)
would you please let me know if you have Dutch/French Language Pack? Thank you

Thanks also to the uploader here. You are very generous :)"

but there's also an updated version I made recently (ignore the Polish description), 14.2 GB
