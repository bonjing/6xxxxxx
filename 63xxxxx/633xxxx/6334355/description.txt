
Known for his TWO ground-breaking Holocaust trials in 1985 AND in 1988.., that resulted in the forensic investigation known as the best-selling "Leuchter Report".., Ernst Zundel is the world's best-known AND most successful "Holocaust Debunker" !!

Kidnapped on American soil in 2003 at the instigation of his political detractors (by "they".., you know.., those who are not to be mentioned!) and imprisoned.., first for 2 years in Canada.., and then another 5 years in Germany.

All this.., for the "Thought-Crime" of questioning the "orthodox" version of "The Holocaust" !!

Mr. Zundel's unrelenting struggle for "Truth in History" is grippingly captured in this documentary showing and explaining all of the many "goings-on".., before, during, and in between these two monumental trials...

This video is quite long (126 minutes), but with a more than "watchable" clarity of about A8 / V7 and quite worth your time to download and watch !!!

As always.., after watching.., do your best to "pass it on".....


!!! Truth Does Not Fear Investigation !!!
