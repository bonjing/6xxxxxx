,hairyassapeman,2011-04-20T21:05Z,I'd wait for a trusted uploader to upload it.  NEVER trust an anonymous uploader on this fucking website.
,Vvornth,2011-04-21T10:16Z,"Swelog uploaded Portal 2 yesterday and that was no fake/virus. I know it is risky when the uploader is anonymous but you can trust swelog.

Great upload, have a great day! :)
Thanks."

ANONYMOUS COULDN'T THOUGHT IT TO BE LEGIT BCOZ THE GAME WILL RELEASE APRIL 21. ITS NOT BY SWELOG. CHECK HIS WEBSITE GIVEN IN DESCRIBTION OF THIS TORRENT HE HASN'T UPLOADED IT FOR PC YET. After all its LEGIT. HAHAHA!!!
