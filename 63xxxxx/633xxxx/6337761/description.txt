Placido Domingo and Kiri Te Kanawa lead an outstanding cast in this production of Giuseppe Verdi's operatic adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Othello. The moor Otello (Domingo), proclaimed a hero after a great military victory, is driven by jealousy to murder when his devious comrade-in-arms Iago (Sergei Leiferkus) leads him (without cause) to doubt the fidelity of his wife, Desdemona (Te Kanawa). Georg Solti conducts the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, under the leadership of Bradley Creswick.
