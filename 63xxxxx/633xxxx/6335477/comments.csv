,Sativex,2011-04-22T05:17Z,"For the people complaining about rars, please try and do some research about the topic, you are just making yourselves look dumb. Almost every show and movie you find is first shared over usenet, they have a file size limit on usenet, that is why you see everything rar'd. For a site like torrent release, which puts out many shows very quickly, it would add a big delay to change every file.

If you are so hard up about rars, go wait for eztv or tvteam release. Just stop being ignorant to the issues. "
