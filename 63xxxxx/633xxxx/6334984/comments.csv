overcompressed video leading
to a lot of mpeg artifacting (boxy).
That's not enough to make it unwatchable,
but unfortunately it's missing the very end
of the movie as he's doing his best to get
the girl he loves. Quite disappointing."

,mugsy1063,2011-04-23T04:48Z,Missing the last 5-10 minutes but unfortunately the only one on here
,rst108,2011-04-24T01:02Z,"@FunstarRaver Are you trying to be cool by shortening everything down so your comment reads like you are retarded?

Torrent is a fair attempt, the missing ending makes it unwatchable obviously. But if another pirate made a cam that was missing another part of the movie then he could use this cam to edit in the part he missed. Why does no-one ever think about that before they make a stupid comment?"
,westcoastartist,2011-04-25T08:22Z,Great try with this movie it just really sucks that the end is missing.
,maxjay75,2011-04-26T15:25Z,Looks like it has been recorded with a cell phone and is missing the end V2 A3 Better off waiting for a better copy
,nicolajadegreen,2011-04-30T10:55Z,shame about the end but watchable thanks does anyone have ANOTHERHOOD realy want to see it
,darkfreedom,2011-05-01T06:44Z,I couldn't even watch this. the cam used to record this movie was out of focus making the video unwatchable. Audio seemed ok though.
,Thrinie,2011-05-02T00:10Z,"FunstarRaver, You fail so much i feel sorry for you, That you, yeah you try to pick on crazy-torrent guy, and blame him for trying to be cool, when you even can't write right, the only one that is trying to act cool is you, and you fail with it with abusing the English terms, with 2,4 and even u, wait what, you are to lazy to write, too,to,for and you? maah dude go and dig a hole and lie down there and never come up."
,GoodMusic2011,2011-05-02T02:14Z,very low quality cam.  sorry

,itcooleagles,2011-05-15T18:41Z,"@Thrinie Says the guy that types a complete run-on sentence with misplaced commas and missing spaces? If you're going to rip on a guy for his incorrect usage of the English language, perhaps you should heed your own words and attempt to type in a moderately coherent way."
