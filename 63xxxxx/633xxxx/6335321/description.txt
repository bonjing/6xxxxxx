Notes

The tracklisting on this piece of shit was all messed up. You can see that
on the tracklist track number 13 is suppose to be Queen Bitch. This track
actually does not appear on the album at all. Instead, all of the tracks
you see on the list from number 14 and down get moved up one track, so what
used to be track number 14 (Drugs) actually is now track 13, so on & so on

Next, track number 31 appears on the tracklist as Freak Girl Feat Gucci
However on the CD, the track is split so track number 30 is actually only
Gucci Mane's verse and track 31 is only Lil Kim's verse, not both featured
together in the same track like the tracklist says.

Everything should match up fine now

I know theres more features on the cd but its tagged like the pic shows

G'on let these 2 sluts slap it out

Enjoy
