,bert16,2011-04-22T03:47Z,"What I'd do if I had to use one of these programs to disguise my IP address in order to get a torrent file, log into the site, get your torrent, then close Super Hide (or whatever) so you can download with no proxy in between"
,saintamadas,2011-04-22T17:25Z,its  all crap. just pay a courtesy visit to the site as its my test ground...-                                              http://www.btscene.eu/details/2296388/Virtual+DJ+7+0+2.html                                        Let me know what you come with despite the crack been replaced as directed.
,bert16,2011-04-23T03:04Z,"Saintamadas: The program you mention in your comment refers to downloading music, not to hiding IP addresses."
,Reaper818dn,2011-04-26T00:23Z,I downloaded this to avoid a ban on a website. I installed and cracked it. I have it running and it say's it is using a fake IP but when i heck my IP on google it's the same and the website still has me banned. Any tips?

,dfickas,2011-04-27T02:33Z,"doesnt hide shit, i went to google checked a few ""check my IP"" and they all came back with my originall IP, I live in Costarica and wanted to watch a few shows online, crappy waste of time"
,bert16,2011-05-05T03:17Z,"Isn't it possible to disguise your IP via a proxy server, get the torrent file, then as you download eliminate proxies by going back to your regular IP?"
