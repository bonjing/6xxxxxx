BBC Good Food (UK), February 2011
â€œThis is a vegan diet book, but forget your preconceptions and look at the food. Isa is an amazing cookâ€”her recipes are delicious and written for people who want to lose weight, but not their enjoyment of food. She uses spices cleverly to make you forget youâ€™re eating low fat and ups the grain and veg content to keep you satisfied. Isa reworks favorites making them lighter and healthier. Her book is worth buying for the salad dressings alone.â€
