CloneDVD mobile converts your DVD movies quickly and easily into a
format that your portable device (Sony PSP, Apple iPod Video,
iAudio X5, Creative Labs ZEN Vision, etc) can play. You can also
convert your DVDs to other file formats, such as DivX, XviD, AVI,
MP4, etc.

Watch your movies on the go
With CloneDVD mobile you can put your favourite movies or TV
series on your mobile video equipment and watch them wherever and
whenever you want. Let the kids watch their favourite cartoons in
the car.

Incorporating the user-friendly interface of Elby's CloneDVD and
the well-engineered open source project MEncoder as the conversion
engine makes CloneDVD mobile a fast, easy-to-use and quality
product that is very reasonably priced.

Copying a DVD to your mobile video machine is achieved in a few
mouse clicks and without the need to rip it to your hard-disk.
Note that copying protected DVDs also requires AnyDVD.
