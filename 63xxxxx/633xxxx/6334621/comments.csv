Thanks a lot for this, sir. You are nothing short of a hero to us. Please let us know what we can do to help you."
,the_shroud,2011-04-22T01:58Z,Not one of the shows I watch but ..... Thank you anyways for what you do
,jotalopes,2011-04-22T04:04Z,"Glad you're coming back. Thanks for still uploading shows even with this upload ""speed""... "
,jmac85,2011-04-22T07:10Z,"We all assumed the worst. We're glad all but your router is well. Again, I insist...if there is anything your followers can do to help you in any way, please just name it."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-22T08:46Z,"In next 23 days I must ""invent"" the money for new router, because recent, broken one was taken by network-technician as ""unrepairable"" and new on must come instead. As many of my friends here already know, I ""operate"" (live) below the level of dignity for three years in row, and I doubt very much that I will be able to get money for new router at all.

Many of you are poor (simple, rude maybe, but truth). That's the reason why you came here and not download 1080p of your favored shows and movies - and that is the reason why I make extremely small-sized encodes even knowing that I would be much on much safer place doing perfect - MegaGiga encodes.

Most of people here (like 98%) never ever have dignity to left even one Thanks in 2 years of my TPB presence, and in five years before. They are Hit&Runners, who gives shit, two damnations and one flying fuck for myself and - for any of you. Make a quick look at my, let say, latest 20 torrents. You'll find - same screen names - their Thanks and comments. Yours. And you all see every day how much people download from me. In a week? Month? A year?

Coming from sheer number of downloads, people would think that getting help from such firm fan-base is something  guaranteed.

Sadly, it can't be further from truth.

Even if my e-mail is in every long torrent description - do you want to know how many people contacted me and offer donations, money, help?

Two.

Last year when for month and half I was on verge of giving up because my PC went bye-bye, do you know How many people sent even ten bucks (price of decent burger or one ticket to good cinema)?

Eight.

Can you comprehend why I call just handful of people here ""my friend""?

Friends have each-other backs. Friends do help, passers by offer condolence, good wishes and safe trip ahead."

@to all who can and want to help:

If you want to help me buy a new router and get back up to speed on ALL the show you love then please consider donating some cash to the cause as I CANNOT afford to buy it myself. My long term fans know how much I have to live on and it is simply impossible for me to purchase a new router without help from fans/friends. I am tied into buying it from my ISP â€“ a replacement of any kind will not work as my ISP has a handshake built-in to the router and will cut me off completely if I don't use their router. I ask all my fans/friends to please help me raise this cash. I have no idea how long my old router (originally provided by my ISP) will continue to work so time is critical here. Please e-mail me at twentyforty1@gmail.com  and help me come up with the cash to get back to full upping strength. For those who are willing to help with cash, my thanks in advance. For ALL well wishers, while I appreciate your sentiment and without being harsh â€“ words will not help."

I wud send some cash but neither do I have a paypal id nor a credit card. Life sucks and I am sorry you are gng thru a rough patch"
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-22T19:46Z,"@twentyforty

I have money to give you but I don't have any means to send money to you. I really pray that your problem solves.I know this sounds rude and inhuman. I download from you and you're the one of few sensible guys around here who encodes files at a decent size. I really hope you gather enough cash to buy a new router.

@People who have a paypal account plz send him some cash. He has done enough for you."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-22T19:53Z,"@DownTYU & DMVIN  : I don't have PayPall account too. I do not have bank account (what for). But help can get trough.

,guitarblues14,2011-04-23T17:38Z,"Thanks for CT ... I just came back on TPB & read about your router problems & though I can't send much by way of donations considering I'm still a student I'll make sure that I seed the shit out of all your torrents to ease up the pressure on you. My DL speed is 14-17 kbps & I'll be keeping my upload speed to 15-20 kbps & I know its not much but if anyone needs any reseeding & I have the said file I'll do that too. Sorry I couldn't be of much help to you, I wish I could do more ..."

,sharan007,2011-04-24T05:19Z,"@all
im  a relatively newer fan of twentyforty.So can anyone care to explain what he means by 'I ""operate"" (live) below the level of dignity for three years in row' and 'My long term fans know how much I have to live on'?
no need to say if it amounts to being nosey.
Im still a student so max i can do is seed and keep alive his legacy.my ul speed is around 40kbps so if any1 who doesnt wanna be a moronic hit and run can ask me to seed a nearly dead 2040 torrent from the recent past"
,sharan007,2011-04-24T05:20Z,"minus the ""if""..dont know why i put that"
