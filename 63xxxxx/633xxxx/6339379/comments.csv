,MyEnvious,2011-04-24T14:20Z,"Hey, i downloaded your torrent and i've followed the instructions but it still says to insert the cd and restart the application :("
,bmart95,2011-04-25T02:19Z,"Ok, MyEnvious, did you place the crack in the specified folder? If not try that and restart your computer. BTW, what OS are you running?"
,newsns,2011-04-25T05:57Z,"@MyEnvious
i had the same problem with mine, if your running 64-bit windows 7 , it won't give you full admin privilege to paste the crack into the program folder.  all you have to do is tell the folder in the properties to allow full access, then re-paste the crack and should work fine "
,bmart95,2011-04-25T17:20Z,"@newsns 
thanks for the advice, I didn't test this on Windows 7 x86 or x64"
,TempDude29,2011-05-09T17:19Z,"Just a random positive comment: I loved this game back when it first game out..Well I still do :)

Thanks for sharing it."
,roserbeam,2011-05-13T03:01Z,dont bother downloading this if you have windows 7 x64
,mohsanlin,2011-05-16T11:51Z,I get stuck at 51% plz help 
,bmart95,2011-05-17T04:13Z,"Hey, if anyone wants me to upload the original Age of Empires II, or any other Age of Empires, just give a shoutout and I'll do it."
,bmart95,2011-05-18T00:13Z,"@roserbeam
If you follow newsns's directions as follows, this game installs fine on Windows 7 x64: 
""If your running 64-bit windows 7, it won't give you full admin privilege to paste the crack into the program folder. all you have to do is tell the folder in the properties to allow full access, then re-paste the crack and should work fine""

hope this helps- b.mart.95"
,bizaka,2011-05-19T03:30Z,"Whenever I run the AOESETUP.EXE i get a message saying ""setup was unable to find, or could not read the language specific setup resource dll, unable to continue. please reboot and try again. 

.. whats the problem here?"
,bmart95,2011-05-20T01:07Z,"@bizka
Make sure you extract the Age of Empires 2_Age of Kings.rar to another folder, don't try to run it without extracting."
,bmart95,2011-05-27T02:10Z,"Sorry about that, I failed to explain that you can't run the game without extracting the rar. Winrar will let you run the .exe's without extracting but it will just give you a Windows error message."
,LusciouLuce,2011-05-28T03:18Z,"Hi guys, this is my first time ever attempting a torrent, and I'm struggling. Could someone kindly walk me through? I've installed the programme & run the update & got to the 'Insert CD' message. The install notes say to go to the installation directory, but then I'm stuck at the next bit - 'copy empires2.exe to the folder and overwrite the existing file'. How is this done? Cheer!"
,bmart95,2011-05-28T17:42Z,"@LusciouLuce
First, welcome to the Pirate Bay :)
To apply the no-cd patch. Copy the file empires2.exe in the folder that you downloaded to C:/Program Files/Microsoft Games/Age of Empires II/ and when Windows asks what to do, tell it to overwrite the previous file with the new one."
,izaki,2011-05-30T18:53Z,"Stucked at 51% for ""Full install"".... 8-/
But works fine with ""Typical install"".... :)
Thankxz for the upload.."
,zorbak5044,2011-05-31T18:52Z,Fantastic! Worked flawlessly
,no-name09,2011-06-03T21:39Z,Downloading..come back after download.
,destruct5,2011-06-07T22:21Z,"Currently torrenting, I have pretty high hopes for this so no worries.

I run a windows 7 vista to seed on and will copy info over to my dell optiplex gx620 and tell you my results."
,destruct5,2011-06-08T17:34Z,"Worked perfectly!
Although I forgot to mention, I run a windows 6 not a windows 7 on my computers.
To run without disk basically copy the aoe2 exe from one folder into the program files folder under microsoft games/aoe then paste over the one already there to bypass it."
,Eggmonster,2011-06-11T12:06Z,Hey i'm wondering where the properties folder stands to give it full acces?
,damienoud,2011-06-18T12:39Z,"@bizaka Yeah, I got that and fiddled around a bit. You need to set compatibility of AOESETUP.EXE to Windows XP. (Right click properties and go to the compatibility tab!)
Good luck!"
,J-ROD38,2011-06-22T11:03Z,"Please help, i have downloaded it, I have extracted all the files, and installed it but when i go to play it says ""insert CD"". "

,jps2011,2011-06-24T18:32Z,Running Windows 7 64 Bit works perfectly fine *the installation) didnt use the crack given and also for people having the GRAPHICS ISSUE there is a crack for it which fixes that :)
,jps2011,2011-06-24T18:34Z,"also the crack empires2.exe is in the folder you downloaded the torrent into, copy it and paste it into the folder you installed the game into

Could you post the crack that doesn't cause the driver issues? I don't have Windows 7 (I'm sticking with XP for ALOT of reasons) and haven't encountered the problem. Thanks. "
,anastaciamatis,2012-02-04T18:13Z,seeedddd pllzzzzz :D:D:D 
,midurix,2012-02-29T13:46Z,"If you get stuck at 51% on full install, try copying all of the files from the disc needed straight into the install folder. Then try typical install after. Worked for me on windows 7"
,AndanteXVII,2012-03-24T18:30Z,"Works perfectly! Install was smooth, and runs great. My only issue is the colors in game, they're extremely pixellated and I can't seem to fix them no matter what settings I adjust. I run an even older version of AOE on this machine and don't get this issue, so I'm wondering if it might be a problem with the torrent."
,AndanteXVII,2012-03-24T21:50Z,"UPDATE: I've discovered a fix for anyone having the color problem while in game. This is for Windows users.

1. Start the game as usual.
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc. to open Task Manager.
3. Locate process ""explorer.exe"", and end it. This will fix the colors in game.
4. When you're done playing, open Task Manager again, click File > Execute (or, New Task) type ""explorer.exe"" and done!"
