,flextm71,2011-04-23T19:00Z,"Actually, the sound seems to have a slight bit of feedback or something. It has a bit of an echo. In the beginning when the guy is in bed snoring it sounds like he is sleeping in a tin can, it was kinda funny at first, but then got annoying."

It's extremely watchable, but the sound isn't very good. I agree that it sounds like it was filmed in a tin can or underwater. The quality of the video itself is amazing though. "

,davidouu,2011-04-24T11:30Z,"First of all my thanks go to the U/L for taking the time and effort to make this available for us all.
However, this is not the finished article as the audio seriously lets down the overall package.
In a horror film where the audio is important for effect, suspense and reveal, this audio  is not up to scratch.
It is over processed from the original source which as a cam clearly needed a lot of tweaking to make it passable....and thats what this audio is...passable.
Video is great, movie i wont comment on as I could not be bothered to watch as the sound is distracting in the extreme.

,mufuti9,2011-04-24T11:41Z,"best copy yet I think, decent picture quality and sound is not much worse than one has to expect with line audio. i am waiting for a better release though, still not watchable IMO.

dont listen to all the morons voting 10/10 on all torrents, except when you are watching films on your 15"" monitor and the built-in throw-away speakers of that 15 year old monitor, like they do.

I also wanted to say this Movie was absolutely horrible. I love Ghost/Scary movies but this was comparable to what you see on the Syfy channel. Extremely cheesy, not entertaining what so ever. I feel sorry for anyone who fed into the hype and paid to actually watch this."

,kingoflight,2011-06-05T13:28Z,"I know the audio sucks for most, 

BUT 

If you are using VLC you can get it pretty good and it's only a few clicks. 

Open up the EQ he the select enable, then head phone pre-set then on put 2 pass on as well. 

You can also try the full bass and full treble pre-set if you want as that's pretty close too 

Hope that helps some people and encourages people to download this one as really its a good effort.

,Gelious,2011-06-05T21:29Z,"This movie is bad. Really, awfully bad. The whole idea is good and somewhat interesting but the realization managed to screw it beyond repair. Visual effects - almost none,computer graphics for about 3 seconds in the whole movie,  atmosphere of fear and terror - does not exist. Plot is boring.  Spirits are just actors in costumes. The other world is unimpressive.   It seems they really, really had very little money for production. Don't waste your time watching this crap (let alone buying it!).
The only REALLY good thing is the ending. Don't worry I won't spoil it for you) I strongly recommend to skip the whole thing and watch last 5 or so minutes."
,snowbirds,2011-06-07T07:51Z,"I rarely stop watching a movie just because the audio sucks, but this is one of those cases.  Video is 8-9 for a DVD rip, but I would rate the audio as a 3.  It sounds like you're listening to it through a 60 foot metal pipe.  As someone else put it; it's jank as hell.  

Thanks to the uploader for providing this excellent upload, but I'm waiting for something with better sound.

And to all you folks who whine and complain about other people who leave their honest opinions about the movie here: please stop complaining yourselves!  Letting other people know what the quality of this copy is like is called ""useful""."
