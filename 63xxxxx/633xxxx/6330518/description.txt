Based on the comic series of the same name, Young Justice will follow the adventures of the 
teenage superhero sidekicks Aqualad (the team leader, approximately age 15 or 16), 
Robin (age 13), Kid Flash (age 15), Superboy (age 16 weeks), Miss Martian (age 16 in Martian years),
 and Artemis (age 15), who have finally gained independence from their leaders and the privelege 
to start their own team (when the Justice League begins to experience difficulty avoiding the spotlight,
 and Batman decides a cover operations team is needed). Set in Earth 16, the show will focus on the heroes
 trying to see if they have what it takes to use their powers for good 
(without the aid and guidance of their leaders) while trying to overcome typical problems
 that come with a teenage personal life at the same time.
