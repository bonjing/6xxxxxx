,hotwwwired,2011-04-22T03:56Z,"I ended up snagging this one from http://thorbits.org which I found after searching for torrentkit and a few other trackers.  I don't know why these wouldn't start off TPB... that's the first time ever I've seen this type of non-starting torrent problem with some of the torrents (some work, some don't). TPB has always been maximum elite and reliable."
