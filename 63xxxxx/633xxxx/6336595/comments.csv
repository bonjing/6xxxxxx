Hi ! I am very busy these days and unfornatly only now i got some time to do this game file , the work was very tough after finding out that no valid capable editor for Valve archives (VPK) available , so it was needed the creation of a decoder to work correctly the files that was making the archive heavy , after the decoding the archive get exactly the inicial presentation , so not a single trouble to the user .

The file includes too a launcher to the game executable for the menus in 21 languages : cze,dan,dut,eng,fin,fra,ger,hun,ita,jap,kor,nor,pol,por,rom,rus,s.chi,esp,swe,tha and T.Chi .

The game is also portable and can be runned anywhere on the computer or external hard drive , easy also for discs recordings or flash drives transportation and of course less space on the hard disk space with the game ok and complete .

Thank you to the Skidrow for his cracking work and to kaos for the nice interpretation on the work in the VPK archives that gives me the correct inspiration to work the Decoder .

IT WAS A PLEASURE DID THIS WORK , SEE YOU !!!"

[V],globeplus,2011-04-22T21:36Z,"It looks like the dear concorrence donÂ´t loose the bad habit to give to my files negatives votes ... if the envy kills ... TPTB have a  frustating work with just a zipping file with the remove of the ripped files ... kaos showing valid work on the VPK archive with a correct analysis on the heavy files , so at least kaos try to do competent work what it is positive for a real ripping work , myself ... i have to confess that i got frustated without a valid VPK editing tool where was possible to manage the files inside the VPK archive , only the extraction and some clean or mod work then i analised the kaos work and made a reorganization with the same conception basically but with a quick more as possible decoder to get the worked archive more fast ready and what a perfect work after a few afinations and this is too valid work for real quality ripping work not bullshit zip files without any essence on the basic ripping work ...

Cheers and god bless all of you ..."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T00:00Z,"INFO : i maded a new nice minitool for the player got a QuickVideoConfiguration without the need to change the video settings only inside the game , this very small executable is placed on the front of the game folder like it is and can be launched anytime and it work fine but without the game running then the user can select resolutions , fullscreen or windowed , border to the window and a few more details , all accessable quickly from the front of the game folder without the game running .

[V],gansuk,2011-04-23T00:30Z,"wtf u think u doing globe whats a matter cant you do ya own rip u need to nick other ppls work now
kaos spent hours ripping this game and u just come along nicking there work
and let me guess you deleted the vids like always you need to learn how to rip proper and not just nick kaos or anyone elses work
for anyone out there who thinking of getting this dont hes prob done vids to very bad quality just to get it abit smaller than kaos rip
download kaos rip not only will it work 100% it will have nice quality vids and you will download it alot faster"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T00:42Z,"To DangerDan43257 : You missed the point or you donÂ´t get the correct idea , it is the next thing : the work on the archive is presented different with my own tools but basically the same conception , the true is that was an ashame that the opportunity of a real nice work that i had prepared before wasnÂ´t available to the possible users because i didnÂ´t get a valid VPK editor , so i rearranged in my own way with my tools with the same idea because was all that i got to work the vpk archives , of course without this tip on the basic work wasnÂ´t possible but i really taked good profit from that to make a fantastic portable game file in a nice way to the users , it is wrong to give good use to a nice idea or not ? and i leave it the work without finishing until i getted a valid solution ? Just the correct work under the circunstances and shore i can appreciate nice valid work ... see you and thank you for your comment ."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T00:48Z,"REQUEST : if someone knows a valid VPK archive editor that it is possible to change the archive files and save please share the link or if someone knows a link to a tool that creates a big multi-chunk vpk archive without any problems and correctly please say it too .

Thank you . "

[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T01:01Z,"To subzero : you are a lying because if it is someone that i know that probably gived negative votes is you , just cut the bullshit , it doesn´t look ok on you . Take care and you don´t need that ... honestly . Thank you ."
[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T01:39Z,"Note about the QuickVideoConfiguration that it is available in a before comment : IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHOOSE ANY WANTED RESOLUTION NOT ONLY THE ONES AVAILABLE BY DEFAULT ON THE VIDEO GAME MENU , if you want for example even if it looks ridiculous a very quadriculate screen like 480x480 , it will work too and so on , so can be enjoyable and useful this minitool .

HAVE FUN !!!"

,DangerDan43257,2011-04-23T09:49Z,"its nice work coz its a repacked kaos rip, it uses the game archives from the kaos rip (which is basically the whole game), audio & tools from the kaos rip, all hes done is repackage it, changed it around abit to look more like his. n then has the cheek to slag kaos off by saying they try and do competent work lol, just as we think globe couldnt get any wose, he pulls off something like this. and sum of you retards love him for this? whats wrong with you people!!"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T12:50Z,"To dangerdan43257 : that it is not correct , the basic idea for vpk archives it is the same and the essencial game files are normal included , they are part of the game but i have another files that make sense on the game folder structure , the way to work the worked vpk archives it is the same but with another tools but to really do the work must be like that or otherwise to put the archive back correctly it is impossible but what i did was a decoder that eliminate ununcessary time to put the archive together back and facilitate the work for the essencial tools to get the job done on the process .

Thank you for your comment ."
,DangerDan43257,2011-04-23T13:46Z,"its got kaos tools init you just removed there name, you even copyied most of there ~unpack~.bat nice attempt to hide the fact by making it run in the background lol, this is just the kaos release with downgraded movies. any dummy can check it. "

[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T14:42Z,"To DangerDan43257 : well that it is not correct , the minitools are necessary and i used my own one for one of them and the other got a little respect touch because i need it and was essencial but the decoder is mind , of course the main work at some part must make sense with the necessary work to put the archive correctly back but afinations on the process are necessary too to get the decoding of the worked archive more fast back , so i have my own part on the work too on this decoder like i said inicially , the basic concept is the same but the decoder is a well analised coding to a faster process to put back the archive , i hope finally you got the all correct idea about this subject .

Thank you and i respect your point of view but what happen it is exactly like i said now , you can believe me . 

Cheers ."

[V],globeplus,2011-04-23T18:34Z,"NEWS : After more work analysis and general research NOW i am capable to say that i find valid solutions to the vpk archives without the need of a decoder or desintegrated archives to get the work done , so in a next VPK archive file if it  hapen i will be absolutly in my own way doing my own work without the need of the help of some others work , i look to the general work on this games files like positive ripping work to put the games more pratical as possible to the users and the games itselfs can have many types of archives , some are more easy to work , others it is possible but tough work and always can happen files or archives very tough to do anything , on this type of archive in particulary was tough to get the work done correctly because it is complicate the edition of the archive but finally after more studys i find out the correct solution to work VPK archives if it is the case , well i simply needed more time than i tought to get the correct way to work this type of archives , i canÂ´t see myself in the future getting probably any trouble working this type of archives if it will be necessary , sorry for my acting on this particular file besides it is a nice pratical decoder but i made it lot of nice work first and it was ashame that at that point in time i didnÂ´t made it the file because the problematic work on the vpk archives , ok thatÂ´s all just a game file with a story but i am happy now with valid solutions for this type of archive in the future ... just life .
