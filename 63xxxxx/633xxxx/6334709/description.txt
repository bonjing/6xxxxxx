I was cleaning off a failing hard disk and came across all my old halo files. I have files dating back to when CE was first around. It is a nice feeling to go through and see how many customizations this game has had over the years, and how diligent the community was fixing problems with each new update.

This is all of the programs I have left after I lost a hard drive with a lot of folks work on it, but nevertheless a nice stroll down memory lane.

The aimbots, the sightjackers, fraps, chams, wall hacks, map hacks, and just about anything else halo you can imagine are in this pack.

Also some very nice UI's that make opening halo more pleasurable.

Note: I did not personally make any of these programs and would like to give a shout out to:
Limited,Patrick,Rec0, Skyline, Kornman,SilentK,Brandini, and all the rest that have made playing Halo CE such a pleasure.

Enjoy Guys,
