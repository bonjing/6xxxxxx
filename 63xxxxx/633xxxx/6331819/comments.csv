,1edson,2011-04-20T20:38Z,"if you are having problems with the game closing to the desktop, make sure you have the fixed crack:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6331819/Portal_2_Crack_Fix-SKIDROW  (this one you're at now)

and that you have copied it's contents to the right folder. The most common error is copying ""client.dll"" and ""server.dll"" to ""GAME FOLDER/bin"" when te correct is ""GAME FOLDER/portal2/bin"". 
The other stuff goes directly in to the default GAME FOLDER.

3.and now you copy the Steamclient.dll 1.0.01 and go to c:/progamfiles/valve/portal2 and now!! you open!!! the portal2 map and find the map called bin and paste the steamclient.dll file in there{again whithout opening the map bin,just rightclick on the bin map and paste the steamclient.dll file}.
4.and now{and this is the only different file compared to the original crack map thats with the complete torrent}you copy the sr-port2cf.sfv svf file and go to the c:/progamfiles/valve/portal2 map and rightclick on the portal2 map and paste it{i dont now what it does but the first time i tryed it without this file the game wouldent start up all the way,i did reinstalled the game after the first time diddint worked}and that worked for me.

Client: Type into the console... connect  replacing the  with an ip.

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the  with the name of the map of choice listed below.

HERE IS HOW TO FIX PORTAL 2 ON WIN 7
((  LISTEN CAREFULLY  ))

First, drag the file named ""LAUNCHER.exe"" into the directory of  Valve\Portal 2\bin

NEXT: Drag the file ""PORTAL2.exe"" into the directory of  Valve\Portal 2

THEN: Drag the file named "" STEAMCLIENT.DLL"" into the same directory of   Valve\Portal 2

THEN: OPEN the folder named Portal 2 from the crack, then open the folder named ""bin"" (STILL INSIDE THE CRACK FILE). Once you see ""client.dll"" and ""server.dll"", Then drag those to the directory of   Valve\Portal 2\bin

NEXT: THIS IS THE STEP YOU ALL FORGOT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A READ-ME. *******READ*******
 You need to drag the file named ""Skidrow.ini"" into the directory of   Valve\Portal 2

((((  THIS IS A MUST  )))) **This is what you all didn't do which caused the game to be rendered useless.**

~~  You can now forget about the left over .NFO file. That has nothing to do with the game being able to run  ~~

Once this is all done, you should now be very able to run the game. Please don't forget the most important step: GET THE CAKE!!!! ;)

there is one here;  portal2/valve/portal2/bin which is the wrong one

the right one is; portal2/valve/portal2/portal2/bin"

HERE IS HOW TO FIX PORTAL 2 ON WIN 7
((  LISTEN CAREFULLY  ))

First, drag the file named ""LAUNCHER.exe"" into the directory of  Valve\Portal 2\bin

NEXT: Drag the file ""PORTAL2.exe"" into the directory of  Valve\Portal 2

THEN: Drag the file named "" STEAMCLIENT.DLL"" into the same directory of   Valve\Portal 2

THEN: OPEN the folder named Portal 2 from the crack, then open the folder named ""bin"" (STILL INSIDE THE CRACK FILE). Once you see ""client.dll"" and ""server.dll"", Then drag those to the directory of   Valve\Portal 2\bin

NEXT: THIS IS THE STEP YOU ALL FORGOT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A READ-ME. *******READ*******
 You need to drag the file named ""Skidrow.ini"" into the directory of   Valve\Portal 2

((((  THIS IS A MUST  )))) **This is what you all didn't do which caused the game to be rendered useless.**

~~  You can now forget about the left over .NFO file. That has nothing to do with the game being able to run  ~~

Once this is all done, you should now be very able to run the game. Please don't forget the most important step: GET THE CAKE!!!! ;)

And to ""extremezone"" and ""skidrow"", Thanks for the files guys. Love this game! :)

If you right click the short cut to Portal 2 you can choos in ""Combability tab"" to always run as administrator and no more worries. No need to start the game from Launcher except the first time either so you can do this on a short cut directly to Portal2.exe"

,SirReno8,2011-04-24T11:12Z,"Sorry, but I just can't help LoL -ing @ the line ""Dear Valve Software, we are crackers, not your problem solvers!""

in the torrent description.  I know what you MEANT by it, and you're totally RIGHT about it (if indeed the legit owners ALSO experience the crash you fixed)...  but my twisted mind just took that quote in a completely different (and quite humorous) way..

---

---

LoL -- crackers!

---

Anyway -- good work, and THANKS for it, seriously.

---

..Please keep up the good work, you crackers..  LoL.

(disclaimer: i wasn't intending to seriously offend anyone..  sorry if i did..  i'm just a guy on the internet, having fun, enjoying humor when i see it.  whether or not a quote was INTENDED in the way it becomes INTERPRETED, is an independent factor, and in my opinion, FAIR GAME. That's a part of the artistic beauty of the world we live in :)

---

This is a great game, by the way.  I loved part one, especially the ending..  The song at the end was hilarious, and made it feel like it was WORTH having conquered all the levels..  I can't wait to beat part 2, but I'm only beginning, and with my hectic work schedule, I probably won't beat the game until a few weeks from now..  

Once the levels get harder, later in the game, I'll probably only ATTEMPT to conquer one or two levels per night, then quit..  then SKIP a few nights here or there, if I'm busy -- just like I did with part one...  the brilliance of that strategy, is that when I get to a new level, I'll at least PREVIEW it, and run around in it, just a little bit, to see what I'm UP against..  So even when I'm AWAY from the game, I'll be THINKING about it, while doing other things.. and then a PLAN will pop into my mind, and I'll be anxious to TRY it the next time I DO get home and play the game.

I purposely left the above description (of how I play part one AND two) rather VAGUE, because I didn't want to spoil anything for anyone new..  But BELIEVE me - you'll have a BLAST..  Cheers!

P.S.,
My co-worker always asks me, ""What's the quote of the day?"" whenever he sees me..  The next time I encounter him, and he asks me that question, I'm going to look at him and say, ""WE ARE CRACKERS."""

To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

,elcapizzo,2011-07-15T07:50Z,"Install the update and copy over the crack files also included in the update torrent. Fixed the appID issue for me.

After a little bit of confusion and mucking around I seem to have it working. Here's what I did:

1. Installed game as usual from main image torrent.
2. Downloaded the Portal 2 Update 1 (which also included the latest crack fix!)
3. Installed the Update 1 from the exe.
4. Copied over the crack file files into the main game directory.
5. Ran game from cracked ""portal2"" exe.

I was given a warning by Avast! saying that I was opening a potentially unsafe application and that I should run it in sandbox mode, however this would cause the game to crash. I tried running it without sandbox mode and the game loads and works fine. Hopefully no issues with malware but I'll do a full system scan just to be safe; seems fine so far (but you never know). "

,KyleKenx20,2011-07-25T21:59Z,I did everything like the usual same situation as the other Skidrow files copied and pasted everything into right folders (had to do that again cause i forgot to go to portal2>bin not the game file bin) and copied everything else as usual. I can start the game go to menu and start single player then it starts loading and doesnt respond -____- go to task manager and kill the process and try again it still no work anybody got any ideas?

,scrotty,2011-08-11T05:06Z,"How to correctly apply the Crack Fix to play Portal 2:

1: Download the crack folder

2: Extract the Rar file to an empty folder or the current open folder.

3: Open the Portal 2 Directory:
(Windows users) C: > Program Files(x86)/ may be different for non 64 bit users) Valve > Portal 2

4: Select the following from the crack folder:
-portal2
-Launcher
-portal2(application)
-steam
-Steamclient.dll
-Skidrow(Look at *NOTE* below)
(Do not open the portal2 folder from the crack folder, just select the whole folder along with the others)

5: Right click > Copy

6: Paste to Portal 2 folder(directory) and agree to any popups asking to replace or merge(it does it all for you)

7: Run Launcher as administrator.

*NOTE* May be optional but if you encounter problems when the game runs such as no steam or something else go back to the crack folder and open Skidrow. Then change PlayerName =(your choice, make it small) also, once this or any other file is in the Portal 2 directory folder it CANNOT be changed, if you try to save it there it will try and save it as a text.

Cont...
Problem:
Skidrow wasn't copied and the entire thing was put in the Portal 2 folder now cant change it.
Fix:
Copy the one from the portal 2 folder and paste on the desktop or open folder. Open it and change PlayerName since it's not in the portal 2 folder it can now be saved as the same thing not to a text then simply place the altered file back into the portal 2 folder and replace it.

Aftermath, Should be able to now play Portal 2. You can delete the crack folder if you wish. It's no longer needed.

,webfp,2011-11-05T19:48Z,"It took me some while to get it working, but it was a great game. Thanks Skidrow.
At first portal 2 kept shutting down or going mad (black screen, looping audio fragments) when I loaded my previous save. The way to solve this is to right click 'portal2.exe', click on properties and go to the 'compatibility' tab. Select run as administrator and switch the compatibility mode to 'Windows XP SP3'. Then close the properties and double click 'portal2.exe' to run it. It should work fine right now.
Next time you start up portal 2, it will probably crash again so the thing to do is: turn off the compatibility mode of 'portal2.exe' again. The next time turn it on again, then turn it of again, etc. You should all get the point, just keep switching the compatibility mode on and off."
