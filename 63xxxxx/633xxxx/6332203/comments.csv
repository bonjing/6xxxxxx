,Daker9,2011-04-26T15:23Z,"@hughl THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU !!!!!!! :)
Works great in VCL"
,blublagoo,2011-04-26T15:24Z,"Thanks for helping Hughl but I've checked those subs and although they appear to be in sync, the translation is pretty off in most parts.

Hopefully somebody will do a translation worthy of the film."
,Daker9,2011-04-26T15:44Z,"@blubblagoo I sample this srt file throughout the film and it seems pretty good to me.
Subtitle translations always leave something to be desired but at least now I can watch this film and know what the heck is going on without having to rely on my high school Spanish ..lol
Thanks again hughl!"
,Daker9,2011-04-26T15:53Z,"@blublagoo I spot sampled this srt file throughout the film and it seems pretty good to me.
Lots is always lost in translation and sometimes that can be pretty funny but at least now I can watch this film and know what is going on without having to rely on my high school Spanish ..lol
Thanks again hughl!"
,Daker9,2011-04-26T15:55Z,Ooops .. double comment posting ..sorry folks!
,theredhead777,2011-04-27T00:48Z,"English subtitles are needed for all foreign languages in this film
Languages:
Spanish | Chinese (some dialogue) | Wolof (some dialogue)"
,blublagoo,2011-04-27T11:40Z,"I have to disagree with you Daker9 because I think it's fairly dreadful. I checked numerous points of the film with this subtitles and while it helps in about 50% of the time, I noticed it missed words out or basically gives random and mis-translated responses to some dialogue.

I can accept that this may be fine for some people but to miss the dialogue due to translation errors and non-translation of dialogue leaves you missing the film.

I can wait. If you can't then accept this dialogue."
,mamarracha,2011-04-27T12:22Z,"Thanks for upload, can somebody please seed - i'm stuck on 91% . thanks "
