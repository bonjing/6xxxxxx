I don't even have to ask which of the mainstream parties you support. The Democans or the Republicrats....essentially one in the same and they've both been serving the ""public good"" for so long now. Well, I just don't think Americans could hardly stand all this prosperity, Low Unemployment, and respect and admiration from the other nations that's been ""HEAPED ON US"" in the past 30 years by all of your ""Economic Scholars"" with their ""Highly Enlightened sense of Democracy and Freedom"" "

Basic Training For Revolutionaries. It was once in hard copy format and then it was banned. You can read more about it here.
