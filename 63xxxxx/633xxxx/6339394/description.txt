WHAT IS VIRAL ACTIVISM???


Just like a virus of the body or computer, a viral activism project has 3 functions:

1. A viral activism project will duplicate itself,
2. A viral activism project will infiltrate anywhere and everywhere possible,
3. A viral activism project will spread from one infected host to the next.



How does The Vintage Cannabis Data Collection qualify as a viral activism project?


Simple! Just download the DVD set and follow our step-by-step disc copying instructions. Here's instructions 6-8:

6. Optional: Give as many copies to as many people as possible!
7. Optional: Mail the 2-DVD set to: prominent figures, prominent institutions, prominent publications, everybody else., etc.
8. Optional: Recruit other people to spread the CRET DVDs.
