,moshster,2011-04-20T10:42Z,The Blu-rays are a long way off yet.  Can anyone confirm if these are real?
[V],PetaFOX,2011-04-20T13:59Z,"Looks like blu-ray too me.
Try the 4 movie samples :-)"
,moshster,2011-04-21T01:27Z,"The samples do indeed look good.  Aspect ratios seem to be correct too.  And although these are 2Gb rips, the video looks slightly better than the previous HDTV rips."
,filmfreaks,2011-04-21T22:27Z,"it's real stuff.. . 10 v 10 a.. thank you, petafox"
,micmac33,2011-04-22T13:51Z,"Thanks a lot, excellent quality 10/10."
,moshster,2011-04-23T23:14Z,"DEFINITELY NOT Blu-Ray rips.  

Raiders has an channel logo pop-up on occasion plus there is Asian sub-titles.  Watch the opening scene in the Amazon when the year is displayed in English and an Asian characterset, possibly Japanese.  My guess is these are Japanese HDTV rips.  

Incidentally, the audio sounds very much like the track on Raiders is from the DVD release but has been nicely synched to the HDTV rip."
,moshster,2011-04-23T23:16Z,"The fourth episode is Blu-Ray of course :)  Quality of the fourth one is very good, in fact I'd replace my 4Gb rip with it to save some storage space."
,TheLifeOfRyan,2011-04-28T05:45Z,"please seed people i been downloading for 2 days and am only on 65%, come on"
,PabloZugel,2011-04-28T19:30Z,DEFINITELY NOT Blu-Ray rips.
,lordquad,2011-05-01T00:17Z,"I really doubt that the quality is really that good. If you watch this on a small (19-23"") computer monitor the quality would be perceived as being good but if you watch them on a 46"" 1080p screen I'm willing to bet a fortune that these files will not look that good."
,rlnplehshalo,2011-05-05T13:28Z,"Slow download speed, please seed! averaging about 20kb/s."
,Hexeneon,2011-05-09T12:39Z,thanks man.. will seed as much as possible...
,veer1989,2011-05-16T18:10Z,Thanks..
,altamashu,2011-05-21T01:47Z,"Ok I finally joined TPB just so say thanks, but for some reason I have no sound on the last 2 films ! ( crusade and Crystal Skull ) my VLC is fully updated and Im on a mac. The samples have sound, the full movies have none. WTF is going on ?!?! Any suggestions, please help ! "
,altamashu,2011-05-22T05:43Z,ok no kidding...there is no audio codec in the last 2 films.
,altamashu,2011-05-22T16:15Z,"Anybody else encountering the same problem with sound in these rips ? For the last crusade and Krystall Skull, there is no sound...only in the sample there is sound

There is no audio data in the rips....this is bull crap"
[V],PetaFOX,2011-05-24T22:41Z,"Shut up.
Nothing is wrong with the audio !!"
[T],zeromancer,2011-05-25T13:37Z,"Why delude people by delibarate lie about the source. The only blu ray rip here is kingdom of the crystal skull.

There are no release date yet for the blu ray editions, these are HDTV rips for crying out loud."
,altamashu,2011-05-28T07:32Z,"PetaFOX
Can you please confirm that Last Crusade and Krystal Skull have audio codecs installed and they are working fine on VLC on your end ? I redownloaded it from your torrent again and encountering the exact same problem again. I use updated VLC and this has never happened before. I am not spreading bull, just someone who wants to see the movies and cannot.

Great copies of the first 2 by the way, and brilliant audio on them too."
,Mathlol,2011-06-11T02:29Z,"Thanks for the great up Peta
Touche zeromancer."
,scynter,2011-06-17T17:48Z,"v/a: 10

,jameskm1984,2011-06-18T07:21Z,Download speeds are barely 20kb/s yet i'm currently connected to 50+ peers... how is this possible???
,real720p,2011-06-19T00:58Z,"This is not 720p (only 544): ""The number 720 stands for the 720 horizontal scan lines of display resolution (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution)""  -- https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/720p

People used to get this right. But not lately."
,SuperMegaPineapple,2011-06-21T22:17Z,could you upload rango please? ill seed!
,spazz890,2011-07-06T01:23Z,"For eveyone having problems with sound: In VLC, change the audio output from 5.1 or stereo to MONO. This is the only way the audio tracks will layer correctly.

Also, not Bluray but pretty damn clear."
,bragazar1710,2011-07-16T04:57Z,thanks.
,suzypie,2011-07-30T13:46Z,please seed... 
,beast360,2011-08-12T10:11Z,"Whether their blue ray or not,by far the best quality i've got access too.

A=10

thank you petaFOX"
,hell81007,2011-09-18T16:28Z,"Thanx PetaFOX.
a=10  v=10"
,tkm20,2011-11-04T15:21Z,Looks like these are only 6 channels for the audio. Anyone know how to knock it down to 2 channels for xbox 360 playback? Thanks.
,sheikhers,2011-11-11T15:24Z,"As said before, how can JBR say these are BR rips when the original trilogy isn't even available on that format? LIAR!"
[V],PetaFOX,2011-11-19T16:34Z,"The quality of the movies is like blu-ray.
Even if its not released yet.
I think its a hdtv japan release."
,AnonymousBasterd,2011-12-06T20:03Z,"@sheikhers

At least I got it for free with a quality on par with bluray."
,firexninja,2012-02-04T08:10Z,thank you!
,NuNu12,2012-02-05T04:56Z,"Wow, thanks so much! All 4 films were perfect! Great file size for such amazing Bluray quality.

A: 10
V: 10"
,pomipomi,2012-02-26T00:38Z,"Shitty torrent, I don't know what people is talking about, the audio is delayed, and the delay increases along with the movie, by half of it you can't keep watching (tested in the first 2 movies)"
,luciusj,2012-03-12T21:19Z,"thanks uploader for very good quality. I didn't expect it to be any better like someothers. it took a couple of days to complete because of the seed/peer ratio but I'm very happy with the results. i have been seeding for three days now and ill continue to as long as i can because these are great movies. thanks again.
Quality: 10/10 for both sound and video. "
,segasager1138,2012-04-07T00:23Z,"I've seen these films countless times on every medium imaginable: VHS, Laserdisc, DVD and various TV broadcasts. These rips are hands-down the best I've seen. I assume they were pulled from a broadcaster that obtained the full-res versions of the mints used for the DVD releases. Not full 1080 and not a new master, but by far the best out there. Fantastic work all around, plays smoothly on my PS3 and looks great on my HDTV."
,rambo786,2012-04-07T10:30Z,bluray not yet released..
,Haredrier,2012-04-15T16:04Z,"Great Torrent, Love all the movies except for the 4th; Good Job PetaFox!"
,PauloFran,2012-04-27T01:25Z,"Not that video quality.
Thanks anyway."
,Nammy13,2012-05-22T22:42Z,"Thank you very much, super prints + audio"
