In 1973, three years after Jackie's weekly series was cancelled, 
he and CBS struck a deal with General Electric
to sponsor this hour-long special -- again with the 
generic name "The Jackie Gleason Show".

The plusses: 

* The 1960s cast Jackie Gleason, Art Carney, 
Sheila MacRae, and Jane Kean all came back to play The Honeymooners again.

* Because it was the 70s, the writers could take on more 
controversial subjects for joke material including 
women's rights (mostly), drugs, and even birth control.

* No musical numbers! Well, not in this 24 minute sketch anyway...

It wouldn't be until a few years later when they did 
3 more specials, bringing Audrey Meadows back to replace 
the Alice Kramden (Sheila) who previously replaced her!

The minuses: 

The other non-Honeymooners material was edited out 
of this special. Whatever it was surely included Gleason's monolog, 
The June Taylor Dancers, and most likely a sketch with actor 
Gary Merrill (whose name appears in the opening credits). The end 
credits reveal there was a bit called "Back in the Twenties and Thirties".
