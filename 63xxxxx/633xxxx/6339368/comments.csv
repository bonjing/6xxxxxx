Open host file with notepad (Must be notepad!)

,zrafferty,2011-05-06T05:12Z,looks great has alot of seeders will give it a go see if it will be good for bundle with xna game developing.
,kokkeli10,2011-05-06T07:17Z,".7zip archive inside this .ISO is identical with trial you can download from Adobe now. So it is clean.

To avoid any malwares those extra files may have, you can do this:
1. Remember edit your hosts file (or set your fw)
2. Run keygen on virtual machine and save serial (then undo changes in virtual machine)
3. Unpack .ISO (with 7-Zip or similar)
4. Unpack MasterCollection_CS5_5_LS1.7z
5. Run Set-up.exe (from unpacked MasterCollection_CS5_5_LS1.7z)
6. Enjoy"
,blaatann,2011-05-06T11:19Z,forward your pc clock 3-4 months and see what happens

,blaatann,2011-05-07T01:31Z,"current keygen only lasts 3 months ++

,kokkeli10,2011-05-09T08:41Z,Now I got repeat that. It seems that Adobe have learned lessons. I rolled back CS 5.
,KengurBGD,2011-05-10T05:14Z,Great working perfect. Just i will add you must change hosts file before you do anything and restart computer. Also you should add more adobe adresses to host. For me UPDATES also working for this release. Only there isn't After Effect CS4 32bit replacement for After Effect CS5 64bit in this release.
,kokkeli10,2011-05-10T07:14Z,"I do have hosts file with lots of adobe addresses, but THIS CS5.5 WILL EXPIRE in few months no matter what you do (even without internet connection at all)."
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-05-15T13:18Z,"Thank you. This is both twice as fast as the trial on adobe.com, and it doesn't stop downloading at 20.98%. Fucking Adobe can't even code a fucking download manager which is fucking useless in the first place. Thank god for piracy."
,KickassWashingMachine,2011-05-16T09:13Z,"Next time, though, skip the ISO please - it doesn't make sense to wrap a downloaded trial installer and a crack in an ISO - it just adds inconvenience."
,lubomir8,2011-05-17T11:31Z,"worked just fine, until today... is there a more permanent solution for this problem?"
,Chjris,2011-05-18T20:54Z,"Works okay, but key expires every three months, and there is no extra content (DVD menus in Encore, etc.), so you have to DL them all manually, one by one. Does anyone know of a version with all the extra content (11-12GB)?"

rebooted and installed the old amtlib.dll crack which you can find my googling amtlib.dll and visiting the megarapid forum hit that pops up. 

i had 18 instances of amtlib.dll on my hard drive and i'd recommend something like file locator pro to quickly find them on your HD. windows search is just dreadfully slow otherwise.

anyway, can't guarantee this will work for anyone else but i let after effects attempt to connect to the internet and it didn't invalidate my serial so it appears to be good to go (after affects being one of the apps that REFUSES to start up if you don't let it through COMODO)."

After yer W7 Ultimate became Not Genuine and using DAZ to fix, now yer CS5.5 popped up with a demand for a serial.

Your crack and two different keygens including De_Guns were useless.

This fixed it:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5688410/Adobe_CS5_Activator_-_32bit___64bit_%5B2010%5D_-_%5BGuruFuel%5D

I had all the hosts entries that were given.  I hadn't loaded AcroReader (someone theorized about a common updater).  I'm using a Russian cracked Acrobat.

I have now taken the time to tell my (paid) firewall software to block all network access for CS and its startup (at system time) programs.

As a fallback I have portable versions of all the CS5 apps by some russkies.

Cos ya never know when MAFIAAs stuff will blow up!  ;-)"
