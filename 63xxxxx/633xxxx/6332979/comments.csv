If you had lived there, and had been forced to believe this from the earliest childhood, you too would have sounded as dumb and backwards as wasalnasar.

He can't help it. He is just a lost soul, wandering the desert for eternity. Sad, really."

'And Messengers Won't go To hell Because they didn't do any bad deeds or sin'

There you have it, mass murder and paedophilia are NOT sins, you've got to wonder at what kind of people are attracted to Islam."

You should by now realize that here you a just a figure of fun and people use your silly postings to ridicule islam, which is haram, so by inciting people to ridicule your religion, you are committing a great sin. Perhaps in fact you are AN ENEMY of islam and do all of this so people can make fun of islam, if so, you are certainly succeeding..."
