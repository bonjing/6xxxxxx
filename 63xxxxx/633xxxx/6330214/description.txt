From the Infowars web site ::


Alex talks with independent investigative journalist Wayne Madsen. Last week, during an appearance on the Alex Jones Show, Madsen revealed that the White House has targeted him for elimination. â€œThey want to kill you,â€ a government source told the journalist. â€œIt was perfectly clear that the phrase was not being used as a figure of speech,â€ writes Madsen. On April 13, Madsen told Jones unequivocally that he does not intend to commit suicide. Madsen said in order to protect himself, he has decided to leave the country.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
 
 !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !!
