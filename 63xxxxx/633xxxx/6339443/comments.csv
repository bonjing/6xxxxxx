,dlectro,2011-05-18T11:55Z,"@missSparky914
You can't mount/unmount with the archiver. You unarchive, then just double-click on the .iso and it will mount. Then you'll see the folder with the installer and the Crack folder with the install.txt within it."
,dlectro,2011-05-18T12:03Z,"@missSparky914
You should get Keka (google for it, first result). After you installed it, right-click on the .rar and open with...Keka and it will unarchive all the associated .rars.
The .iso will mount as a virtual dvd.
Installing the creative suite is not hard either, just follow its instructions.
The serials in the install.txt don't work. You'll need to run the keygen on a windows machine.
After that comes the crack, i don't know how to apply that... the instructions are not straightforward."
,dlectro,2011-05-19T11:02Z,"@chess000master
Enter the serial when there's no internet access. When you launch an app the Adobe Application Manager will try to validate the serial, if there's no internet access, it can't (otherwise it will tell you the serial is not valid, and you have to either enter a valid serial or enter the trial period).
If you haven't applied the crack, only launch these apps when you're offline."

,Fnnylgrnd,2011-06-06T04:22Z,"Yo dogs,

Here's how you apply that crack:

1. Copy it from the OSX folder paste it anywhere else (your desktop for instance)
2. Right click it to get the info, go to the permissions at the bottom of the window, change the permission to ""read and write"" for both the user and everyone.
3. open terminal and type: ""sudo pico user/desktop/disable_activation_osx"" (without the """"quotes and also make sure the path to the file is where ever you pasted that file. to make sure you have the pathway correct write click on the file and copy it and it will copy the pathway for you and you can just paste it into terminal after 'sudo pico '(*NOTE: there is a space after pico)
4. it will ask for your admin password. type that shit and hit enter.
5. it will open a new window and a bunch of things will be written saying it ran, something about ""127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com"" a couple lines of that a bunch of other stuff, some triangles, etc. it will be pretty obvious if you got it right.
6. you're done.

Make sure ya'll download little snitch and block the heck out of your shit. That password (1325-0004-8372-1259-6791-1046) that DJNITTI gave is good. thank you. "

I did get that problem where it asked for a CS4 serial number, but after a few tries it worked without a hitch."

go on finder and press shift,cmd, G 

this will open up a ""go to this folder"" window

type this:

/private/etc/

this will open up other file scroll down and find and textedit doc called ""hosts"" 
then add crack in here

hope this helps

,xxcrak,2011-09-03T19:08Z,"OK PEOPLE HERE IS HOW TO DEFINITIVLY STOP ANY ADOBE PRODUCT CONNECTING TO THE NET-=-  
Deactivate the Adobe CS Live connections at a system level.

The following data values need to be set to deactivate the Adobe CS Live Services internet connectivity at a system level. When these connections are disabled at the system level, it will override the users ability to enable connections through the user interface.

On Windows
Do the following:

1.Quit all CS5 applications.
2.Launch the Registry Editor: 
For Windows XP, choose Start > Run and type regedit then press return to open the registry editor, or...

For Windows 7/Vista, choose Start, type regedit, and press return when the registry editor appears in the results.


3.Create and/or edit the string value AdobeOnlineDefault: 
For 32-bit systems: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Adobe\AdobeOnlineDefault.




For 64-bit systems: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Adobe\AdobeOnlineDefault 
If the sting value does not exist, you'll need to create it (right click on the container and choose New > String Value).
4.Double-click this string value and set it's Value Data to ""0"" to disable; click OK.
5.Close the Registry Editor."

,g35holdem,2011-09-09T03:50Z,username221... How did you get around it when it asked you for a serial for CS 4?  Did you just use the serial for 5.5 again or did you use something else?  You said that you tried a few times and then it went through fine but what did you try?  Thank You
,g35holdem,2011-09-09T03:58Z,"OK All, I think I figured out a way around it asking for a second serial.  When it asks for the original serial, go to this site:

http://pastebin.com/XyG06a3g

IMPORTANT-- Choose one of the serials from the Multi-language/International Serials List. YOU WILL NOT BE ASKED FOR ANOTHER SERIAL!!!

 If you choose one from the first list IT WILL ASK YOU FOR A SECOND SERIAL so avoid.

Hope this helps!"

It installed, and I've added the 127... line to the hosts file. But every time I start a program, the Adobe manager thing tells me my trial expired and asks me for a serial. I put in a generated serial, then it asks me to login with my adobe ID. When I do this, it says the subscription fails. Why is this happening? I changed the hosts file and followed all the directions. Someone help please?"

@nos551, I had the same problem; and the way I got it to work was to use one of the multilingual serials posted by @putnut00 (thanks mate!) instead of the ones generated by the keygen so that the installer stopped trying to upgrade and made a fresh install of the Suite. Hope it works for u too! =D
