Description......: According to the Bible, Jesus came back from the dead and walked the earth for 40 days before ascending to heaven. But 
		   the New Testament reveals little about this defining miracle of the Christian faith. Using tools of history, 
		   technology, science and faith, HISTORY tells the little-known story. Long-buried non-Biblical sources, such as the 
		   Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, the Secret Revelation of John and the writings of the Jewish historian 
		   Josephus yield astonishing information and detail about these seemingly lost 40 days. Could Jesus' words in these 
		   ancient manuscripts contain some of his most important teachings, even though they were not included in the New 
		   Testament? The producers also build upon the CGI image of the crucified Christ created from the Shroud of Turin in The 
		   Real Face of Jesus to visually depict the moments when Jesus appears to his followers in resurrected form.
