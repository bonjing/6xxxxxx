,raynet,2011-04-24T03:04Z,Kinda pointless to put torrents in torrents
,killeraudiobookwizard,2011-04-25T02:16Z,well if the people who were downloading have ever contributed by uploading them selves they would know that the reason i put a torrent in side a torrent is that to get 50 gig sized torrent on piratebay is impossible so i bypassed that to get you the seeder a larger file so look in to thinking before you say something it helps lmao idiots

,vandergraaf1000,2011-08-13T15:39Z,It would help if the torrents within the torrent had any fucking seeders!
