,pepet96,2011-04-26T07:09Z,the turret opera is not included. It was the only reason I downloaded a 1.73Gb torrent and the one thing i was looking for was missing.

you can find the song on the bik video file ""sp_30_a4_finale5.bik"" in your game folder in the media-folder of portal2
and record it from there, there does (not yet) exist a full version of the song, hopefully valve will make one, support the game, it is really great!"

thanks"
