As few of you might already know,this is the full retail version.
100% clean and completely trustworthy.
Works perfectly like a charm :)
Before starting your download,set your personal up speed to 45 ko/s for
this torrent.
If you cannot download :
try to increase your upload speed,or wait while and till new peers will be present on torrent with you.
you must make a sort of chain between all other peers and you by giving a descent upload from your part and this especialy all in any torrent download.
don't forget to stay fair and so don't just downloading without giving upload.
I repeat again and again :
A good peer must always give some upload while downloading any torrent's file.
Rightly set your torrent client in mirror of your personal internet connection,otherwise,you will never be able to download right and good.
fast connection with low ping users will be forcibly largely favorised of course.
African,Greek,Indian peers,try to give more upload from your part since you might have slow connection with crap ping's response.(Not all peers of course)
Avoid any pause on any torrent from me,i prefer you stop it and come back later to resume this last one.
To clarify :
All peer who doesn't give upload enough will be instantly kicked,this will be a normal consequence of your bad job as well as if you will not give any upload at all of course.
never forget it cause it will still be the deal between you and i so.
No upload from your part will probably get no download by far as well.
therefore slow upload might get slow download.
...
If you like this torrent then help and seed with me asap as long as you can so.
Ty for understanding
a very nice day to all

kind regards
