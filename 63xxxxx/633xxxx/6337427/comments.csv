,kjaartan,2011-07-15T01:01Z,How do you install these? 
,Horrux,2011-07-28T21:07Z,"To install, extract all these to [drive]:\steam\steamapps\common\left 4 dead 2\left 4 dead 2\addons

Note that there are two ""left 4 dead 2"" subfolders within each other. Also, in order to run them, you need to install the ""Left 4 Dead 2 Add-On Support"" tool, within your Steam Tools"
