This movie is an interesting experience about the social phenomenon of immigration. Everybody that feel intolerance for those who come in our countries in search of a little dignity should take a look at this very well made story of people who live to the edge. The story is well developed and the actors are all lovables. A very particular mention goes however to Elodie Bouchez. This is the first time that i see a movie with her and what could i say, she's unbelievable. Her recitation is simply stunning, she really should win an award for this incredible performance.
