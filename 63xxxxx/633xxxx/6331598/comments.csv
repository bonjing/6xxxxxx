,bobbers602,2011-05-05T21:20Z,"I downloaded.  When I went to imgburn, it automatically began to unzip the file.

Sadly, it would not burn the disc, instead giving me the message that ""the file is broken."""

,hazeleyedpowell,2011-09-11T04:43Z,"Hey dude one question, would I get banned from Xbox Live? I know the Original Xbox Live network has been shut down. But I'm talking about when the Xbox 360 is reading the disc and detects it as Halo 2 and I click play game would Microsoft detect it and ban my console?"
,sakurinha,2011-09-15T23:42Z,Worked perfectly. My XBOX is LT+
