Game review 

---------------------------------------------------------------
The PC version of FIFA has been a little behind the curve when it comes to getting the latest and greatest technology the soccer series brings to its big brothers on consoles. Well, all of that is changing with FIFA 11, as PC players can now enjoy the same game engine that has been on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 for the last few years. It might still be lacking some of the features that console fans know and love, but there's no question that this year's FIFA on PC is a big step in the right direction. 

When you first hop into FIFA 11 on PC the differences are immediately evident when comparing it to last year's version. The 360-degree dribbling that was introduced in FIFA 10 on consoles makes its way into this year's game, so moves feel much more under your control than they have in the past. You can make finite moves with players like Lionel Messi and every other athlete on the pitch feels a bit freer for impressive runs when not confined to the eight directions of old. This also helps the general realism of the action which only ups the excitement level in the various stadiums.
