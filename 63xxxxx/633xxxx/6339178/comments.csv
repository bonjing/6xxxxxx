,sanved77,2011-05-15T20:19Z,@all_with_problems - Guys the problem with the game not installing is your antivirus. the games DVD is been programmed in a way that if its not in the DVD and in the hardware then it shows that as a trojan. So first close your internet connection then turn off your anitivirus and then install it will run fine then 
,sanved77,2011-05-15T20:30Z,"@all_with_problems - Guys who are having problems with the game not starting 
1)Compress the crack file 
2)Replace the crack every time you play the game
   It will work fine
If playing multiplayer please ensure that your antivirus is ON same thing with the firewall"

I installed the game and used the serial number 
4HAS-KJ2B-QGM4-MQGL-7RLD
Finally I replaced fifa.exe by the fifa.exe in the folder crack/Fifa 11 no CD crack/
When I use the old fifa.exe, the game asks for a CD/DVD.
When I start the new (replaced) fifa.exe, the busy-cursor appears for some time, and after that nothing happens."

,mar_enz,2011-05-24T03:53Z,"WARNING: VIRUS!!!

THIS DOWNLOAD IS INFECTED WITH WIN32:SALITY.

Infection confirmed by Avast, Symantec and Kaspersky.

It infected many executables, particulary other games. It also infected at least two system executables that run at start up, attempting to spread the infection (igfxtray.exe, and hkcmd.exe) (Fortunately, I had these disabled from start up, so the damage was minimized.)

INFECTED FILES CAN NOT BE REPAIRED BY THE ANTIVIRUS, AND ARE DELETED.

That is why it canĂÂ´t install unless you disable your antivirus. That should have been a giveaway.

Please remove this torrent, and maybe someone can re-upload a clean version."
