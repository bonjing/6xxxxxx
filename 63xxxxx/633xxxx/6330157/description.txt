NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Hanna 2011

Right firsat off thanks to LKRG for the release and hats off to ya The video had someone camera movement and is at a angle...also seemed to have some glare to it,but overall for a cam ..pretty decent Audio is better than your tinny sound cam....this had some life to it and you can hear whats being said so Anyway audio is untouched ,but the video we rotated a little bit ...not much and used a perspective filter to pull some of the camera movements....but anymore and we would lose the video.

Even after the rotate its still at a angle other we would have lost alot to get it level Also worked on the brightness,contrast,chroma,sharpness and also ran a denoiser over it aswell ....oh and changed the res to correct the AR...whoever due to the camera movement and crop it does slightly change AR throughout.

Overall for a cam ....watchable,but no good on these massive tvs 
Enjoy folks
