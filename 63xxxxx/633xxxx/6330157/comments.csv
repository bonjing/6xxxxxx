,niteyez,2011-04-28T04:08Z,"This is CRAP! Even for a cam. Ever heard of turning off ""AUTO-FOCUS""... This is painful to watch... even the title ""FOCUS Entertainment"" is HORRIBLY OUT OF FOCUS. The audio sucks, even with EQ adjustment it echoes badly and the camera is tilted and pulled in throughout the movie. Not to mention the woman's head that appears at the bottom right of the screen intermittently throughout the entire movie. Couldn't you tell her you were trying to capture the film for some project and have her f'n MOVE! Wait for the DVD Rip which should be out and uploaded in less than a week or just download the DiVx version found here: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6349886/Hanna_DivX . The movie sucks anyway despite what critics say. It looks like some wannabe director's first attempt at a feature film. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ATROCITY!!!!!"
,niteyez,2011-04-28T05:44Z,Please disregard the link in my previous comment as I have downloaded it and confirmed it is a F'N FAKE!!!  TPB has already disabled the link and removed the torrent. Tried to help but got bent over instead...
