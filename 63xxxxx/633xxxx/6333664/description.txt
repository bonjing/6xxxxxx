XP-AntiSpy English,

The xp-AntiSpy is a little utility that lets you disable some built-in update and 

authentication 'features' in WindowsXP.

For example, there's a service running in the background which is 

called 'Automatic Updates'. I don't know what this service transfers from my 

machine to other machines on the internet, especially the MS ones. So I play it 

safe and disable such functions. If you like, you can even disable these functions 

manually, by going through the System and checking or unchecking some checkboxes. 

This will take you approximately half an hour. But why wast time when a little 

neat utility can do the same in 1 minute? This utility was successfully tested by 

lots of users, and was found to disable all the known 'Suspicious' Functions in 

WindowsXP. It's customiseable, but comes up with the Default settings, which are 

recommended.

Is usefull that!
