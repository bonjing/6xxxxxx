A man finds out that what you don't say to a friend is just as important as what you do 
is this story of how far you can bend a brotherly bond before it snaps. Since college, 
confirmed bachelor Ronny (Vaughn) and happily married Nick (James) have been through thick
and thin. Now partners in an auto design firm, the two pals are vying to land a 
dream project that would launch their company. Ronny's girlfriend, Beth (Connelly), 
and Nick's wife, Geneva (Ryder), are by their sides. But Ronny's world is turned upside 
down when he inadvertently sees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to 
get answers. As the amateur investigation dissolves into mayhem, he learns that Nick has 
a few secrets of his own. Now, with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest
presentation of their careers, Ronny must decide what will happen if he reveals the truth
to his best friend.
