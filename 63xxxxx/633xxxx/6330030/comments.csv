,Vitruvian_Man,2011-04-23T01:32Z,"I've been trying to get my hands on a working license since new year. Tried tons from youtube, and both of yours, all simply show me that the license is not valid. Whether this indicates a problem at my end(likely) or your end i cant say.

Thanks anyway"
,xhizorx,2011-04-26T00:21Z,@Vitruvian I Don't know what the problem is. I'm currently using the license with no problems. try uninstalling and reinstalling avast.
