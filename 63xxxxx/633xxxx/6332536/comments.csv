thanx...

,wishUluck,2011-04-21T08:49Z,"No Eng subs my friend, apparently the file of them would be too big to be included into a Blu Ray disc and even more impossible to fit into a plain DVDrip. Or perhaps the uploader is just a prick (I think the second reason is a bit more probable). 

Well, at least this time he is honest about subtitles. If you look a few days back into his other upload (The Rite)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6320834/The_Rite_%282011%29_NTSC_DVDRip_DD2.0_NLsubs_DMT
he stated that he included Eng Subs, but he fuckin LIED.
I hope those who download his files do not seed back at all!"

@wishUluck 
Do you understand me if I'm saying that, probably not.."
,wishUluck,2011-04-21T09:32Z,"Go back at ""The Rite"" of NLUPPER002 and see how I thanked for the English subs, but there were NONE! Also, wise guy Torrent4nu, if you look at other torrents, like from SeedKey, Punisher l ALWAYS show my gratitude and always seed OVER 100% (something - of course - I can't prove - then again, I have no reason to lie about - BECAUSE I ASK NOTHING FROM YOU OR FROM NLUPPER002) I only stress the fact that it shows a shitty character to read a million times from other users to include Eng subs and to not do so (being no problem for you).
COMPRENDE Torrent4nu? Surely NOT!"

Oke indeed you got some nice comment about the English subs.. 

wishUluck bij 2011-04-16 07:37 CET:
Thank you so much for including English subtitles!

But when u see that there no any English subs on the release you say....

wishUluck bij 2011-04-17 09:09 CET:
No fucking English fucking subtitles as fucking stated!

probably can you do that also on a normal way
like ''NLUPPER you say there where English subs but that wasn't.. you can also aks can you re upload it with English subs..

but I know you are not a evil men and I understand it. you expected English subs.. and they are not there.. I got that also sometimes

Your English seems fine to me. Why do you need subtitles? I understand ""The Rite"" had some Italian dialog in it which required English subtitle but I don't think you'll need it for this one if you speak English. "
