ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most
Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of
Judgment. O Allah! Have Your Salat and Salam (peace) and

upon all of his companions.


Each person is born in a religious environment that is not of his/her own choice. From the very beginning of human existence in this world, they are assigned the religion of their family or the ideology of the state. By the time individuals reach their teens they usually accept the beliefs of their parents or that of their particular society.
However, when some people mature and are exposed to other beliefs and ideologies, they begin to question the validity of their own beliefs, and search for the truth.
