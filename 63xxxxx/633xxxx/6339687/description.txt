Michigan-based I See Stars are part of a growing mini-movement of bands whose ultra-short attention spans, molded by years of video games and restless cable channel-flicking, not to mention the Internets capacity to endlessly regurgitate pop culture of the past in search of a quick laugh, have melded with teenaged hyper-earnestness to create a form of music that somehow sits halfway between heart-on-sleeve adolescent torment and the relentless pursuit of exactly one response from the listener -- "Dude, that was awesome!" These songs shift on a dime from rave-ready electro breaks to downtuned guitar breakdowns, synthetic-sounding drum-pad eruptions, near-falsetto choruses, Auto-Tune outbursts, ominous waves of orchestral strings, and a sense of the epic seemingly defined by 80s movie soundtracks.
