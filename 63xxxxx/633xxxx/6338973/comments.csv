After rumors this month of Lil Wayneâ€˜s Tha Carter IV album being pushed back from 
May 16th to June... And the reason is â€œHeâ€™s still perfecting a few things, heâ€™s a 
perfectionist â€¦ changing a few lines,â€ Mack Maine said of Wayneâ€™s recording process. 
â€œWe also have a huge record that wasnâ€™t done yet. Weâ€™re in L.A. right now. We have 
a little studio time and it should be done probably by Monday.â€ PEACE!!!
