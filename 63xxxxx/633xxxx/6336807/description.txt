plot

The film begins with Ronny (Vince Vaughn), his girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly), his best friend Nick (Kevin James), and Nickâ€™s wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) all at dinner. Theyâ€™re sharing stories when Beth asks how long it takes to really know someone. Ronny states that you can never really know someone; Nick disagrees.
At a car show, Ronny is able to get him and Nick a meeting with Dodge in a few days. They celebrate with dinner with their ladies. While Nick and Geneva are dancing, Ronny tells Beth that he really looks up to Nick, who pulls him onto the dance floor. When they switch partners, Geneva tells Ronny that they love Beth and asks Ronny when heâ€™s going to propose to her. That evening, Ronny asks Beth if thereâ€™s a clock ticking; she says no, but if things progress, she wonâ€™t be unhappy.
