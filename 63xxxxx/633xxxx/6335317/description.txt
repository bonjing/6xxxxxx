     Grosse Pointe Blank is the witty, dark comedy starring John Cusack (Con
     Air; The Grifters) that's being hailed by both critics and audiences for
     its outlandish plot and irreverent humour!

     Unlike his High School friends who became respected professionals, Martin
     Blank (Cusack) found a lucrative career as a hit man. But the job has
     lost its appeal and Martin faces an uncertain future. Now, he finds
     himself back in his home town of Grosse Pointe to attend his ten-year
     High School reunion, complete one last "job" and take another shot at
     rekindling a romance with the girl he stood up on prom night (Minnie
     Driver - Sleepers). With Dan Aykroyd as a hilarious rival assassin who
     wants Martin to join a "union", Grosse Pointe Blank is a killer comedy
     loaded with action and laughs!
