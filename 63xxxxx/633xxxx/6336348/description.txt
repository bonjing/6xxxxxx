-< More Industrial Revelations >-

With Mark Williams (2005)


Mark Williams returns for a new series of the popular show highlighting the Industrial Revolution and it's many benefits. His personal asides to camera add to the engaging style of his presentation.


01: Bread and Beer
------------------
As the population exploded, demand for the two staples of Bread and Beer forced engineers to employ steam as a power source to produce the quantities required. Where once water-wheels and horses had played their part in grinding and ploughing, smoke-belching behemoths worked longer, harder and more efficiently.


02: What To wear
----------------
At once content to own one set of clothes that were looked after for as long as possible, people now wanted to be able to change what they wore. Mechanisation helped reduce the cost of clothing while improving the quality of the finish. But having more cloth was not enough - enter the sewing machine!


03: Gas On Wheels
-----------------
How William Murdoch's vision of self-powered road vehicles helped him discover coal-gas, formed from heating coal, producing the smokeless fuel coke which in turn led to the first smokeless horseless omnibus (Turbo Powered!) and the development of the carburetor for the modern internal combustion by Gottlieb Daimler.


04: Print And Paper
-------------------
As printing became more widespread, paper production underwent 'industrialisation' improving the quality and upping the quantity. The same methods are still in use today at Wookey Hole for specialist papers. And with more paper now available, the printing process improved to match the demand. John Baskerville was renowned throughout European libraries for the clarity of his typefaced books.


05: Under Pressure
------------------
Joseph Bramah was a prolific inventor who discovered that liquids could not be compressed and the science of Hydraulics was born. Mechanising the system meant that small forces could lift or move very large objects and soon all sorts of new engineering projects became possible.


06: Building A Revolution
-------------------------
The move from the country to the cities meant new house building materials. The humble brick was ideal for wide-ranging applications. With slate roofs and iron frames, beautiful new building styles were envisaged and concrete began to appear. When some buildings failed, a new science was born - materials testing, where new ideas could literally be tested to destruction thus saving lives!


07: Bright Sparks
-----------------
140 years ago, electricity was regarded as a fairground novelty. Sir Humphrey Davey's carbon arc lamp revolutionised light houses but it was Joseph Swan's incandescent light bulb that brought light into the home. Michael Faraday's work on magnets led to the development of electric motors and the novelty factor gave way to a new industry.


08: Heavy Metal
---------------
The demand for Copper and Tin led to all sorts of innovations in mining as shafts had to be sunk deeper than ever before. Copper, an excellent conductor, was used to revolutionise the fast emerging national communications industry. But the British Empire's needs reached much further afield and cables were laid across the world's oceans.


09: Cutting It Fine
-------------------
Once the highly secretive silk production process was smuggled out of China, the European Silk Industry was born. Sought after by the wealthy as a status symbol, the slow and costly methods of silk weaving led to innovation as to how this ultra fine material was processed to produce beautiful, complex patterns.


10: Machine Tools
-----------------
With so many textile industries already mechanised, no-one had thought about automating traditional skills such as carpentry or metal forging. With steam-powered engines at the hub, machine factories sprang up that could cut, stamp, trim, drill and mass-produce a wide range of large or small items, repetitively and accurately. This revolution led to new industrial standards so that parts were universally compatible.
