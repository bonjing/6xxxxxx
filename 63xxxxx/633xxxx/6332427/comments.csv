They promised big  scale warfare, lots of vehicles and weapons. It had barely anything of that in the singleplayer or coop. Multiplayer was terrible.
And not to mention the visuals look like garbage."

next time you sign up to post comments on a site, I hope you improve your creativity when it comes to user names rather then showing your undying support for a male actor you faggot.



As for the game it works 100, already half way through. And the game is very good, just like the previous one. If you are getting in error when launching then you are not smart enough to read the instructions as it clearly states not to delete the original 'RedRiverLauncher', yet add the 'RedRiverLauncherc' and use this one to play the game. Any other problems and it is user PC related. So the haters can continue to troll on,  because this game is great."

install game as instructed in the .nfo file. launch game from redriverlauncherC.exe. create local account in GFWL. in GFWL options open network information and check your network adapter. it should say Local Area Connection. if it does then from the games main menu click Join Game. when it finds no servers, creat server. make sure its set to LAN. from there it will take you to main menu again, and choose game mode (campaign, firefight, etc.) game will start, other players Join Game and done.

my problem was the game wanted to use the Tunngle adapter(I dont use hamachi anymore, but i'm sure these steps will also work). moving it to the bottom of the adapter list didnt help (control panel, network and sharing, change adapter settings, advanced, advanced, click on tunngle arrow/move it to the bottom). make sure your Local Area Connection is at the top. if that doesnt work, then right click on all the OTHER adapters in adapter settings and disable them. restart game-possibly computer- and check the GFWL network info and now it should say Local Are Network. and that worked for me! to be safe I also installed the game on one system with all X's for the serial, and the other system installed with all 1's as the serial. i dont think that matters tho. keep in mind you should re-enable those adapters for normal computer use when done gaming. I also saw some sort of adapter/registry override on teknogods or something, but I don't mind having to switch adapter for all of 10 seconds at a time to play LAN in my house with like 8 ping.

oddly enough my other system did not require any additional setup. as GFWL choose the correct local area connection/adapter. and needed no ports forwarded.

sorry for long post, hope it helps! now hopefully tunngle will get some rooms up for this!"

thanks for your post. I am able to see servers in the LAN Lobby menu using Tunngle. They already have a network up with people working on this.

The problem: even though we can see each others servers, when we try to join the connection is lost and it says 'Joining session failed'. So were you able to actually join a server and play ? I was told that teknogods have to release a fix for this, but if you already have this working please let us know tunngle settings if you can please ? thanks again."

for home LAN, log into game and GFWL. check network info in GFWL, if it says anything but your local area network, disable all other network adapters (tunngle, hamachi, other networks) in control panel except that one . also make sure the network info page now also says 192.168.x.x:50015.

http://teknogods.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5750

1 -Download and install Tunngle and join the Operation Flashpoint Red River network to find other players. Move Tunngle to the top of your adapter list found in (Win7) Network and Sharing Center>Change Adapter Settings>Alt Key>Advanced and use the arrows to move Tunngle up to the top.

2 -Download and run Teknohelper.exe , highlight your Tunngle adapter in the list and click  'set adapterkey' 

3 -Launch the game then click 'start injection' button in Teknohelper and let it finish. Before you search for servers hit F12 while in the game and you should hear a womens voice to confirm. 

4 -Make sure you are in a LAN session and search for servers and join. Have fun !"

I copied the content in the crack as directed, launched from the launcher ""C"" version.

Screen go black like game is loading, then comes back to desktop, I then check task manager and RedRiver.exe is running and the redrive securerom is running, but no program or game on the screen. I'm thinking it may be a video setting, it there a way to access the settings prior to start.

,BAARERBIER,2011-04-29T14:31Z,"Game DL'ed in less than 40 mins, installed and cracked no problem what so ever, thanks extremezone! always great uploads from you mate. Keep it up.

A little about the game. I was very dissapointed with Dragon Rising, waited so long for it only to find out that the game is so bugged that it was virtualy unplayable. However Red River has me impressed so far. They have gone for a more arcade style this time with weapon custumazation and ranks, this is not bad at all, but needs slightly more work in my opinion. Red River has sorted many glitches that Dragon rising had, for example the AI now actually try to do what u tell them and go over obsticales, unlike in Dragon Rising where your fireteam would get stuck and killed, this is a major improvement in the game and makes the game expireiance a lot more immersive. There are little to no graphical improvements in my opinion, I am still able to max out the settings on a 4 year old Machine, however that does not matter to me so much as the gameplay is what really matters and it has improved. Story line is also much better and immersive. 

Red River should have been Dragon Rising, in my opinion. Anyhow thanks codemasters for a good release, and thanks exteremezone for a great upload as always.

Has anyone bought the game and played online? Would like to know how online play is, as this is a big selling point for me. If online is good i will buy it. "

,Skyrat70,2011-04-29T18:03Z,"As I mentioned in a previous post, thank you extremezone and Reloaded for a great game post.  Yeah the game isn't without some issues, but honestly the more I play it (even just the quick Fire Team engagements) the more I like it.  To me it's much better then DR.  I live in US and just couldn't wait to try it (June 7th release) so here I am.  I consider this a demo for now, and plan to purchase when finally released here.  I'm AM sorry that so many are having technical issues!  Hopefully you'll get 'em worked out soon!"

,Emperor_Rosko,2011-04-29T23:34Z,"@BAARERBIER...There is no online for this game other than a 4 player co-op! Apparently they wanted it to be a ""intimate co-op experience with friends"". What a load of bollocks, i have a ton of friends on xbox live, but chances of me logging in at the same time as 3 mates, who are all up for playing red river at the exact same time are pretty damn slim! I think bringing a modern war combat game out with no multiplayer is insane, and it'll be in the bargain bins in no time and shelves will be bulging with traded in copies, and i hope it does, they should have had a set of balls and took Black Ops on!! Which is basically why they have left it out!"
,BAARERBIER,2011-04-30T02:03Z,"@Emperor_Rosko AHH what a shame about multiplayer. Its definatley one of the main features they should offer, and specificly focus on.

Maybe there will be an expasion to the multiplayer with some patches?"

Game works fine ,the only thing is that it asks for a number wan I want to join live !!

But you have to do so much in set-up  before U finally can play the game (not meaning install )

graphics are good, not like  Medal of Honor 2010 but good ,the game play is fast (maybe to fast for me I'm getting old LOL ) 

I can also fly the helicopters in this one ?

In dragon Rising I was number 56 on the world rank list. I don't think I'll make it that far again  in Red River .

Hi! I had the same problem with disconnected from the game. For me helped, create new offline account in Games for Windows LIVE, and turn of my internet connection. After that game works almost fine. On Radeon 5770 and QuadCore its goes not smoothly (AVG 22-26 FPS) on high settings in 1920x1200px and 2xAA. I have newest graphic drivers 11-4 and play on Windows 7 x64. Anyway, for me this game looks like Playstation 2 game in high resolution. I know graphic isn't most important but in 2011 it should be in high level. We buy expensive parts for PC and we should be demanding relatively high quality games."

You have to start the game with the proper file called ""RedRiverLauncherc.exe"", you see, there's a ""C"" before the extension, not the other file without ""C"". This file comes with the crack.

like splinter cell or ghost recon or rainbow six.

if your shot 3 times your dead.
1 time your hurt

3 times dead

,trazk1,2011-05-29T16:12Z,"I got the game to work after having the same errors that everyone else did..

Install games for windows BEFORE installing OFRR. Reboot.
Use the ""game"" application and not ""setup"" to install. You won't be asked for a serial. 
Copy over the included crack files from the CD and launch the game with the C one. 

It took me 3 tries with the installer and Games for Windows, but it eventually worked.

Don't forget to reboot after installing games for windows. Then install OFRR.

Good luck."

Those with the rld.dll failure, you have to have both .exe's in the folder.

,spystyle,2011-09-06T00:15Z,"Her is my 2 cents, just an opinion. My review

I don't like rap music

I don't like government propaganda

I don't want to sign in to ""Microsoft Windows Live"" to simply save my game 

The game starts with a government propaganda movie and it's delivered as if the expected target audience is retarded. It glorifies US presidents and demonizes US enemies, it's as if FOX news wrote it. 

That movie was annoying because the Bush and Bin Laden families are buddies in the oil business and have been for years. The original Bush fortune was from Nazi laundering. 9-11 was a scam and Bin Laden certainly didn't mastermind it. See Alex Jones for more information if you want. 

So the movie can be deleted, OK, not a big deal I guess. 

Then I need to sign in to Microsoft Live to save my game ? Lame. 

Then the actual game starts, a foul mouthed ""gangsta"" Staff Sargent is cursing and yelling and insulting the entire time. I got sick of it quickly. 

The graphics are OK, the game play is very restrictive, you are not free to roam as you were in the previous game ""Dragon Rising""

This was more in the style of COD and it's for people that love foul mouthed rappers, I don't like rap music at all. 

I really enjoyed ""Dragon Rising"", it had a flaw that the grass was too tall and the AI could see through the grass but the player couldn't LOL, so while I enjoyed playing it so much I decided to try the squeal - big mistake for me. 

I hate ""Red River"" - to enjoy it you must want a foul mouthed ""gangsta"" insulting you for hours, and you must believe the FOX news version of 9-11

What a piece of garbage this game is. A terrible stain on the Flashpoint legacy. "

,dumas1000,2011-09-15T06:37Z,"I doubt this game is smart enough to spew propaganda in an intentional attempt to further some seedy, underground agenda. It's just full of lazy derivative stereotypes. The endlessly cursing sergeant is annoying. The game is repetitive as hell, the missions are way too long, and it all feels like a generally pointless exercise that drags on for an eternity. The sergeant repeats more or less the same crap mission after mission, like he's just rambling endlessly for hours on end. I don't see any plotline or a semblance of character development. It's brainless.

However, the Windows Live thing is cool if you have an Xbox Live account and you can double dip your achievements. 

You don't have to pay anything to create a profile and earn achievements, by the way. Even on the 360 that service is free. 

Anyway, you can play the PC game, earn achievements, then turn around, play the 360 version of the same game, and earn the exact same achievements a second time. It's awesome. 

You guys do realize that you can gain achievements on Pirated PC games using a real profile while playing in offline mode, right. Anyway, this is a blowfest, pretty much."
