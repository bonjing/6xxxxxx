                           DESCRiPTiON 

 New series. Anna Richardson campaigns against the sexualisation of children.  
 In the first programme, she tackles two major high-street retailers that she  
 claims are responsible for selling risque clothing to youngsters, and arranges
 a myth-busting workshop to counter some of the rumours circulating in the     
 playground. Dr Radha Modgil also visits the nation's schools to question      
 teenagers about their opinions on sex.                                        
                                 Enjoy!
