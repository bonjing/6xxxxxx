You should not use it, brother!"
,annabelle31,2011-04-21T09:47Z,"People, don't be so harsh on wasalnaser. He can't help growing up in a region where civilisation has been held back by indoctrinating the populace with moronic beliefs by the ruling elite?

If you had lived there, and had been forced to believe this from the earliest childhood, you too would have sounded as dumb and backwards as wasalnasar.

He can't help it. He is just a lost soul, wandering the desert for eternity. Sad, really."

My mother came to me while I was being swung on a swing between two branches and got me down. My nurse took over and wiped my face with some water and started leading me. When I was at the door she stopped so I could catch my breath. I was brought in while Muhammad was sitting on a bed in our house. My mother made me sit on his lap. The other men and women got up and left. The Prophet consummated his marriage with me in my house when I was nine years old. Neither a camel nor a sheep was slaughtered on behalf of me."
