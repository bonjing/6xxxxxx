- Release Notes ------------------------------------------------------------- -

   Take one listen to Augustana's self-titled third album and it's clear that 
   this band has thrown off the shackles of playing it safe. Lead vocalist and 
   lyricist Daniel Layus has dug deep and emerged with a passionate, rootsy 
   rock collection that is distinctively American, recalling the muscularity 
   and epic sweep of albums by Tom Petty and Bruce Springsteen in their heyday. 
   The album is a shimmering blend of rock, folk, and country that manages to 
   sound both modern and timeless. The subtle, streamlined production by 
   Jacquire King (Kings of Leon, Norah Jones) lets the true beauty of Layus 
   soulful vocal delivery, as well as the band's barnstorming performances,
   shine through.
