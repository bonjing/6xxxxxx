,raindr0ps,2011-04-25T00:42Z,"Hey, eagerforcc. This looks good but I'm confused about step 6. Your instructions say enter command:

D(rive):CD BOOT enter
and then:
CD BOOT enter

Is this correct or is this a typo?
Thanks, this looks real handy."
[T],h4ck3r2012,2011-04-25T06:44Z,"This is the write content from the guide:-
D: CD BOOT and hit enter.Where âDâ is your DVD drive letter.
CD BOOT and hit enter .
Please follow instruction carefully."
,raindr0ps,2011-04-26T03:54Z,"Thank you. I was afraid that the second CD BOOT was a typo and I wanted to be sure. Better safe than sorry. Once again, thanks for sharing.

BTW, will this also work for XP and if not can you tell me why not. I also appreciate this info.

I will also post this reply to your other link in case anyone else is also curious. "
