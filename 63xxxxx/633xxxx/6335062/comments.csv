,R.Jonnys,2011-04-22T01:42Z,"serves for this torrent?

Mortal.Kombat.PS3-CHARGED"
,iscy,2011-04-22T03:39Z,"No.. it's for this one:
Mortal Kombat [USA][Multi5][Spanish][PS3][www.consolasatope.com]

""Mortal.Kombat.PS3-CHARGED"" is a bad torrent. Only a few files are good.. others are corrupted. I mounted its ISO on linux and hashed the files to compare with the release from consolasatope.. way too many are different. You better get the other torrent instead of looking for patches."
,R.Jonnys,2011-04-22T05:07Z,Thanks for the help.
,aguiladark,2011-04-22T09:47Z,"Well I don't known if I had the bad backups that you tell ""ps3-charged""... I must suppose to have the Usa.multi5... because all the intros and menus are in spanish... the problem is that i can't perform any special move or fatality...this file that you are sharing fix the problem?..how i enter this file in my game?in what file of the backups?"
,aguiladark,2011-04-22T09:57Z,I'm using gaia manager... would work this patch?
,-spook-,2011-04-22T12:22Z,Read your comments on the 'PS3 CHARGED' torrent and I'm downloading consolasatope's rip instead. Hope I can get it to work with your fix. :)
,iscy,2011-04-22T16:51Z,"@aguiladark The release from consolasatope is not spanish only. It's a clean rip of what is been sold in the US.

And yes, it will work with Gaia. I know that because I'm also using that backup manager. It's very simple, clean and loads faster than multiman."
,iscy,2011-04-22T16:55Z,"Also, do not forget about ""UP1018-BLUS30522_00-MORTALKOMBATPTCH-A0101-V0101-PE.pkg""

You need to install this (included in the consolasatope release) in order to fix the fatalities and some issues. It brings the game to 1.01."
,aguiladark,2011-04-22T20:12Z,thanks for your answer and support iscy... just some last questions... the file that you share is param.sfo... where i put the file? this would give th full version?

,eladious,2011-05-12T04:39Z,"Ok, I fixed my patch problem, now I have followed all your steps to a T, I see the game as a selectable game on my HDD, and when I start it, it shows the MK logo then goes black.  Any idea of what is happening?"
