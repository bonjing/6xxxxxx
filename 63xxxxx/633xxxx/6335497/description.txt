This is just the ISO file so you guys don't have to worry all about the WinRar stuff. All you have to do is just download the game and paste it onto the ISO folder within a PSP with custom firmware. Tested and working on PSP 2000 Prometheus 5.50 3 and PSP 3000 6.35PRO-B. Also, if Road to the Show does not work, then try avoiding using UMDs for a long time.
