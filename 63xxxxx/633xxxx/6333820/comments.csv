,vNa5h,2011-04-21T15:41Z,"YIFY IS A UPLOADER....AINT NO RIPPER...

STEALS OTHERS WORK"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-21T15:49Z,"@vNa5h
Takes so much courage to bitch about somebody behind their back--and btw, ask me how much I care!  And how many files have YOU uploaded? NONE! Go krap in your own sandbox."
,madtown4,2011-04-21T16:25Z,@vNa5h please go some where else...

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-21T16:46Z,"Interesting concept, bitching about stealing ""others work"" on site called thePIRATEbay.

Looks like  scream from MPAA payed shill.

... and as far as I know, giants as [eztv] or [TVteam] are just uploaders of Scene releases and they are doing immense job providing their torrents of TV shows and movies for people all over the world. BTW, Yiffy is encoder, very good one, and I think that any fool who throws mud on VIP uploaders should be banned immediately and such comments erased."
,ammotusker,2011-04-21T17:20Z,great 2 have u back...we were all sufferin withdrawal symptoms!
,Dr-nidO,2011-04-21T17:25Z,"glad to see you back, best of luck with your router...
totally agree with you on the last comment,
i love encoders but that does not diminish the work that up-loaders like eztv are doing

and btw YIFY is also a great encoder and totally agree that flamers should be banned..."
,spiritualiste,2011-04-21T18:24Z,"Thanks a lot for your constant unique piece-of-art shares...i am not DL it but just wanted to show you my respect and support...

,believenu,2011-04-21T19:36Z,"I missed you twentyforty.We are glad to see that you can connect at all. I am aware how hard it can be to have this as your only connection with the world around.I will support as you need. and if anyone can in the ""old world "" who has a router/modem that can be used by twenty lets see if we can find a way to get it to him.perhaps he can tell us type and model needed even if he can hobble a couple together we can somehow get it to him. we can be his legs. "
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-21T19:40Z,YIFY just downloads movies from 300mbunited and changes the track names in mmg and uploads them as his own rip.
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-21T19:43Z,See YIFY's millenium trilogy torrent and match the size of each file at 300mb blog if you need proof.
,jmac85,2011-04-21T20:03Z,"If there is any way we can help you out at all, please name it. Your loyal supporters surely will assist if they are able. (PayPal?)"
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-21T20:28Z,"@DownTYU (or should I call you Skullshaker?)
Quoting myself from YIFY's site:

When you are up to your ass in alligators, it is hard to remember that the original objective was to drain the swamp. Similarly, when the objective is to watch a movie that you cannot afford to see in a theatre, you tend to care not whence the source cometh. Considering the multitudinous and time-consuming hoops one must jump through in order to utilize the free links at 300mb--I refuse to fault YIFY for saving me the time and trouble. One would expect a purist such as yourself to have multiple pages of original encodes, but I notice that you--surprise, surprise--haven't done any torrents at all."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-21T20:34Z,"Most glad that twentyforty is back, however temporary or minimalist that may be due to uncontrollable circumstances.  "
,coolasad,2011-04-21T23:40Z,Welocme Back. Once I Have Downloaded the File I will upload as long as i can
,the_shroud,2011-04-22T01:55Z,"My vote's on banning the trolls too
Thanks 20-40"
[V],DownTYU,2011-04-22T04:06Z,"@formerly_azrielle

Have I for once said anything about YIFY's credibility? He does a good job by uploading scOrp rips to TPB. It also saves my time. Nothing againstyou Nothing against him after all he's a VIP pirate. :D"
