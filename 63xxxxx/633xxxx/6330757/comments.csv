,badboy503,2011-05-14T14:59Z,Can anyone confirm this is the english dub and that it works??
,hell1312,2011-05-14T21:44Z,it works you just need vlc media player and this is in english
,badboy503,2011-05-15T08:00Z,Yeah i was just curious about the authenticity of the english dubs since it hasnt been released in my country yet. But yeah i understand its a .mkv and i can play it through windows media player because i installed the codec for it.
