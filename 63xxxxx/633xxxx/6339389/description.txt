installation on dell XPS M140
 
Don't touch Bios, Defaults are fine. if you have a problem, then turning off execute bit in bios won't hurt 

use Ideneb 10.5.7
Qoopz kernel (better possibilities for sound support)
chameleon v2 IMPORTANT!!
batterymanager
voodoohda (audio) works but choppy and needs frequent reboots
can upgrade  AppleHDA using Qoops kernel and  taruga 1.20 after install

ethernet broadcom AppleBCM440x
video intel GMA900
install netgear wg111v3  under wireless if you have chosen to buy one as onboard wireless with encryption is still a nogo. 

there is a package (iwidarwin) if you are ok w/ unencrypted connections or just want badly to use built-in wireless


After install
recommend netgear  wg111v3 purchased separately
get safari 4.03Leo.pkg 
Apple HDA Patcher 1.20 from taruga (works with Qoops)  (included)
drag stack dump text file icon  over onto patcher icon....install, reboot, enjoy clear Audio -) 
stack dump from ubuntu live CD for Audio (working dump file from this model is included in the package :-)

TURN OFF UPDATES FOR OSX 10.5.8!!!
TURN OFF UPDATES TO ITUNES !!!
TURN OFF UPDATES TO SAFARI!!!



itunes 10.01 (since future versions require kernel in 10.5.8)

DO NOT use ideneb 10.5.8 combo update unless you are an expert  and have made a time machine backup!!!!! 

I recommend doing a time machine backup or disk clone  if you are a tinkerer like me :-)



unit will sleep just don't ever close the lid. If anyone nows solution for lid/wake issue please let me know 

Description: closing the lid causes the display to go off and it will not come back on until reboot..... Do not close lid until solution is found.
