Firstly... A MESSAGE TO ALL YOU HATERS: you're boring. 

Don't want to listen to Christian music? Then just piss off. I don't care what you think, I don't care what deiphobic crap you wanna type. I'm not trying to "convert" anyone and I'm also NOT CATHOLIC. I don't know any kiddy-fiddling priests and I think the pope's a dick. For argument's sake, say there is a Hell: the pope's going there.

I'm just sharing some of the better music (and some filler material too I'm afraid) from our God-bothering gatherings of notes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

So anyway...

This is almost all of my Christian music from Skillet and Gen to Iona and 100 Portraits. There's not enough decent Christian music on the web because my brothers and sisters often don't believe in torrenting. :-P

so the bands here are

100 Portraits
Enter the Worship Circle (100 Portraits and Waterdeep)
The Benjamin Gate
Blindside
Cathy Burton
Celtic Worship Band
Day if fire
DC Talk
Downhere
Eowyn
Firefly
Fono
Gen
Iona

nChant (I met these guys at Greenbelt festival in the UK and we do the token "goth" eucharist. Come say hi)

Phatfish (previously only the newer stuff... that mostly sucked but now I have "Purple through the Fishtank" and "Unplugged: Hope" back so enjoy. These albums are among my favorites)

Pillar
Plum
Sanctum (something Firefly was involved in but never released)
Sja Worship
Skillet
Third Day
Vineyard
The Violet Burning

I don\'t have complete band discographies and I\'m missing a few albums due to a headcase (like Phatfish\'s decent stuff), and some of these tracks sck, but there\'s good in each of these bands.

Enjoy
