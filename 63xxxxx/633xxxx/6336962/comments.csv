One less chinese dude is aparently no biggy as no one seems to care about it in the program. The program seems to ask ""A billion chinese people? whose going to miss a few of them right?""

Clearly the chinese lack of civilized behavior shines through brightly in this show. The savage and barbaric activities that are part of their everyday culture are front and center. Moreover, the ability of the chinese to try to parrot and ape modern civilized western culture is shown to be a fraud as the chinese continue to treat their most vulnerable members in their society as expendible... a real eye opener to show just how uncivilized the boastful chinese culture really is when it comes to simple humanity."
