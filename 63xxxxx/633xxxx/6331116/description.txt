Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son (also known as Big Momma's House 3) is a 2011 crime comedy film directed by John Whitesell and written by Matthew Fogel and Don Rhymer. The film is the second sequel to Big Momma's House (2000) and stars Martin Lawrence reprising his role as FBI agent Malcolm Turner. Jascha Washington declined to reprise his role as Trent Pierce from the first two films, and Brandon T. Jackson replaced him for his role.[3] It was released on 18 February 2011. This is the first Big Momma film to be presented in 2.35:1 widescreen.

The film is intended to reboot the series with a new leading character as well as appealing to a teenage audience as opposed to the first film's more mature target audience, although the previous film Big Momma's House 2 was more family-oriented.
