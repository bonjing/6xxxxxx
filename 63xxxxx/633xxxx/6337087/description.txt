WINDOWS 8 M1 UNTOUCHED ISO FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This ISO file is from the first, direct source, the Private FTP servers on a site Called Beta Archive. It was released even before "razvanripper's" torrent of the ISO file.


This ISO file is COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED AND READY FOR BURNING, PUTTING ON USB, OR MOUNTING ON A VIRTUAL CLONE DRIVE.

MD5 hash has been checked, and the ISO is not corrupt. If it is, you probably didn't download it correctly. If this occurs, please FORMAT THE PARTITION YOU TRIED TO INSTALL ON ASAP AND TRY THE ISO DOWNLOAD AGAIN.

So, anyways, for me, the ISO uploaded by rasvanripper is not working for me. It automatically corrupts at "Expanding Files - 20%"

If you have any problems with rasvanripper's ISO file, please try to download this one instead.


Please seed!
Again, this ISO is COMPLETELY 100% UNTOUCHED. THIS CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE FIRST SOURCE THAT GOT WINDOWS 8 M1, THE PRIVATE FTP SERVERS FROM BETA ARCHIVE.

Have fun and happy downloading!
