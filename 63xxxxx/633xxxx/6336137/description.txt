Archer Season 2 episodes 1-13

updated file names 
if you had the (1-12) torrent , remove it and replace it with this one 
all the files are the same only episode 12 has been added ...so lets 
leave the (1-12) torrent in the dust and continue with this one 

be sure to come back nexxt week for a new (1-13) torrent and etc until finished
which we all secretly hope this season never ends ......

 As Lana would say ....YUP	

Yeah so apparently I cant just edit the original torrent with a new one 
each week .... but at least you can remove the archer torrent from your client 
without deleting data obviously , and then download this new one each Thursday (or early friday morning )and tell yer client to check the torrent before starting it and chances are you will only be downloading the newest episode each week . Which should be good

It would sure be nice if the bay would let me update the torrent but whateves...

ohhhh wait I totally had something for this .....something about stripes and Solids

cheers
