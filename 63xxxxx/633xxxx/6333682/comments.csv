This video contains big errors - the basic right turn shown is out and out wrong and studying this will result in your developing errors which, if you are lucky enough every to be shown how to fix will take a lot of conditioning to iron out. I spend most of the time when I'm giving privates ironing out side-stepping on right turns from girls. It's a very bad habbit. Put simply I'd avoid this video.  Or in spanish: Este video contiene errores fundimentales yo que vosotros lo evitarĂÂ­a. O, por lo menos, eso es lo que opino yo como profesor del estilo de LA. Mejor evitarlo. Fin y punto!"
