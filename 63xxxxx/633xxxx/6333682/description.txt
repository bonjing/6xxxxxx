Discover how easy it is to learn to dance. This DVD is just like having a dance lesson at a studio. You've seen ballroom dancing on TV shows like Dancing With The Stars with John O'Hurley & Charlotte Jorgensen, Ballroom Boot Camp, America's Ballroom Challenge, and the Fox reality show, So You Think You Can Dance?.

Seductive steps. Exotic beats. Passionate movements, and explosive turns. These are some of the elements of the Latin dance known as the Salsa.

With careful and detailed instruction, they will guide you through the basic elements of this wonderful dance.
