Right. So the big pop-up demanding me to input an activation key before it even begins to install is just an early onset of alzheimers on my side, is it?

And the passworded crack/keygen RAR in the skidrow folder that sends me to survey bullshit sites is just my imagination as well?

You're peddling shit, sir. At least own up to it."

I did download from a different torrent, which I'm downloading this torrent as well. But the other torrent had what seemed the right files just passworded crack / keygen, and the installer requires an activation code... so I dunno we'll see I guess."

ignore the nubs that are saying there is an activation code required. either they don't have a clue what they are doing when it comes to a torrented game, or are just saying it to make you grab their trojan and keylogger infested torrents instead.
Never had a single problem with any previous extremezone release, and I doubt I will with this.

,Tracaine2,2011-04-20T01:37Z,"Thank you extremezone. I for one am very grateful for all that skidrow and others do here. Gaming is my passion, however I am also very poor. I barely afford a 25$ a month internet connection. I support the developers when and where I can, but usually at the end of the month there just isn't an extra 50$ to spend on something I may not even like when my baby needs food. The game companies can bitch about piracy all they want, but the fact is, they're not ""losing money"" at least not from me because I don't have it to spend in the first place.

I am simply happy to get a game and forget how much life sucks for a little while. So thank you again to yourself and all the others like you who help the poor and unfortunate like myself have a little light spot in my otherwise dreary life. That's more than any government or church has ever done for me. You, sirs and/or madams are heroes in my book."

This is their most important launch since that game and they are ready. And no peer block or guardian or hiding ur ip or doing both well not protect u. Just ask the people who got a letter from their isp even when they was using peer block and hiding their isp. Im sure some of u have already been caught torrenting illegally. Not trying to scare anyone, and skidrow is not a bad guy. But u can bet ur ass this is being watched and ur ips are being recorded the game has been out for almost 24 hours, ESA is on this like stink on shit!

Again, Peer Block is not a proxy or a VPN, and IP's cannot be traced through proxies. The only way to do that is to contact the proxy and request their logs, but the thing is proxies through services like ProXPN don't keep logs and their traffic is encrypted anyways so they wont have your IP.

the.iso file included tells u to open the skidrow folder inside it.  inside is a .rar file with a keygen and crack.   the crack is easy to get, just download from skidrow's other torrent.  the problem is the keygen!  no one has posted the correct password to the .rar file for those 2 files and skidrowgames.in is not it...that works for extracting the .nfo file inside and the .url file....but not the good stuff.

so i dont know how you have installed this game with no problems unless you are playing the game from somewhere else or if you bought it and used the activation key that you purchased.

please help us out...we just need a working activation key."

First increase your upload speed. If you have your upload speed set low, everyone will be leeching from the same people. If you increase your upload speed, the people that have less of the files than you will be leeching from you instead of the people you need to leech from.

Secondly, make sure you have protocol encryption turned on, and FORCED. and do NOT allow legacy connections. This now is the easiest way to speed up your torrents and prevent detection. Limit your open connections to under 50 for windows (10 per torrent or so if you like multiple torrents open)...

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect  replacing the  with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the  with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game. cant test it right now :("

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect  replacing the  with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the  with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

Have you done this before? Usually there are files in a cracked folder provided with the download. These generally replace the .exe's provided with the game installer to bypass Securom or similar anti-piracy measures. 

Bottom line: Copy whatever files are in the Skidrow folder and paste them in the folder you installed the game to on your local drive (usually something like C:\program files\(game publisher)\(game name)\) Look for the files they should be replacing. For example: if the file in the Skidrow folder is named ""Portal2.exe"", find the legit ""Portal2.exe"" and replace it with the one from the Skidrow folder. Hope this helped."

Download these:
(Install only Update)

(Instal only Crack File's)
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6331819/Portal_2_Crack_Fix-SKIDROW

Please make sure when you Copy Crack Files open your portal 2 install directory. When you Open Portal 2 Install directory you will see a folder called Portal 2(Open this Folder). so you will copy the bin files like this. 

C:Portal2/Portal2/Bin (Make sure you copy bin files in the right bin folder, there are 2 Bin Folders)

Also Make sure to Close Steam & only Run game as Launcher.exe  DONT OPEN Portal 2.EXE

I have been playing the game no stop without crashing im on the 12th Stage I even closed the game & restarted it, It does auto save but you have to complete the whole stage to auto save the game.

Only Use Luncher.exe to Lunch the game.

I Hope that helps you guys, I have been installing Pirate games from Reloaded & Skidrow for years. 

Follow my Direction's it should work."

,vdao1972,2011-04-23T07:37Z,"Hi, 

I am having trouble getting the game to install on Windows 7 Ultimate 64x.
After downloading and verifying the torrent, I mounted Portal 2 using Daemon Tools and started the install but folder Pak01_003 is corrupt and I cannot continue the installation. 
I did try ignoring the various corrupt files and installed the SKIDROW patch and crack. The launcher ran but after that, my computer comes up with a missing DLL.

Any ideas?"
,ThanksForPlaying,2011-04-23T07:40Z,I say re-check (verify) the torrent. That solved that error (for me)

2. downloaded crackfix

,renhoek3,2011-04-23T11:40Z,"From the positive comments I understand that this is a problem that only affects a percentage of people, but I do run into the Activate problem.

Here are the steps I follow:
1) Run setup.exe
2) 'Next' button
3) I agree to the license and click next
4) 'Verifying components', checking DirectX and such
5) Leave the install path as it is and hit 'Next'
6) Get the Activation window right after that

On the activation window there's one input box at the bottom, an 'Activate >' and a 'Close' button.

This _is_ show up for a lot of people, so Skidrow, please recheck your release."

,R0B0T1C,2011-04-23T13:11Z,"For anyone who wants to play COOP LAN... Here it is.

This is not mine. I found it on another page...

To play coop over lan:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect  replacing the  with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the  with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

Map List (In Order)

""mp_coop_start""
""mp_coop_lobby_2""
""mp_coop_doors""
""mp_coop_race_2""
""mp_coop_laser_2""
""mp_coop_rat_maze""
""mp_coop_laser_crusher""
""mp_coop_teambts""
""mp_coop_fling_3""
""mp_coop_infinifling_train""
""mp_coop_come_along""
""mp_coop_fling_1""
""mp_coop_catapult_1""
""mp_coop_multifling_1""
""mp_coop_fling_crushers""
""mp_coop_fan""
""mp_coop_wall_intro""
""mp_coop_wall_2""
""mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro""
""mp_coop_wall_block""
""mp_coop_catapult_2""
""mp_coop_turret_walls""
""mp_coop_turret_ball""
""mp_coop_wall_5""
""mp_coop_tbeam_redirect""
""mp_coop_tbeam_drill""
""mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1""
""mp_coop_tbeam_laser_1""
""mp_coop_tbeam_polarity""
""mp_coop_tbeam_polarity2""
""mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3""
""mp_coop_tbeam_maze""

""mp_coop_paint_speed_fling""
""mp_coop_paint_red_racer""
""mp_coop_paint_speed_catch""
""mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro""
""mp_coop_credits""

The current map name can be found in the console after it loads (for continuing at a later time) but all gestures earned will be lost, as if anyone cares.
Note that they may reroute you to the ""mp_coop_lobby_2"" multiple times in which case you just have to restart the process for the next level..."

There are many other files in there. I have tried to just copy the two fixed files, and the game just crashes at start up. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

E-mail me at jsvez2010@gmail.com

Thanks guys."

Before and after the update 1 + 2 installment, try placing the Portal 2 folder under Steam/steamapps//

Since the game runs by your steam settings, it'll be able to save and not crash, due to the fact it tried to autosave when it could not find your savegame folder. 

If that did not work, then try installing both updates, one update at a time, in the same Steam/steamapps/ location, and try again.

I will guarantee it will work. I should know, I didn't crash down the elevator and savefiles work :D"

,Difusal,2011-04-26T15:46Z,"This torrent works PERFECTLY !! And the game is awesome!

I don't have any crashes during the game. Probably because I installed it in this location:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Valve\Portal 2""

Although, the game does crash at the very end, when Wheatley is apologizing. I would like to fix that.

For the ones who are making questions, read the previous comments! There are tons of it, and they have the solution to your problems, I'm 99% sure of that!

It is possible to play the multiplayer online, just search on google or read the previous comments."

,rofalcon1,2011-04-27T00:23Z,"This is how I got it to work and I use Vista.

Download and unzip the original torrent, the update, and the crack. Like files in each of these will go in the same places.

You will open up the SKIDROW folder and you will see some files and a folder called Portal 2 with a folder inside called Bin.

Ignored the Portal 2 folder for now and copy just the files. You will need to paste these inside the game directory folder where you installed Portal 2 to. Mine was Program Files\Valve\Portal 2. 

Now you want to copy the files that were inside SKIDROW\Portal 2\Bin. Should be two files. Now paste these inside both Valve\Portal2\Bin as well as Valve\Portal2\portal2\Bin

Once you do this for the original torrent, the update, and the crack, make sure you use the newest Portal2.exe file to run it and run it under an administrator. 

Worked like a charm for me and fixed my crashes. Though it did crash at the very, very end of the game.

Hope this helps. Enjoy."

,stinkynut,2011-04-30T01:28Z,"Ok, holy fuck, fuck all of you retarded cunts. Seriously, use grammar faggots. 

This is what you do, so shut the fuck up and listen. 

Download this, install it. It will take a while. Get the fuck over it, people want this game.

After you install it, download the crack. Unzip the file. You get 5 files, launcher.exe, portal2.exe, skidrow.ini, and steamclient.dll and a folder named portal2. ignore that folder for now.

copy the 4 files to your programfiles/valve/portal2 folder. 

go back to your crack folder, open the folder named portal2. it has a folder named bin. open that and copy the two .dll files.

back in your programfiles/valve/portal2 you see a folder named bin at the top. THIS IS NOT THE FOLDER YOU PASTE THE TWO DLL's IN. You have to click the folder named portal2 IN THE PORTAL2 FOLDER and there will be a bin folder. open that and paste your two dll's (that you got from the crack file)

this should be enough to run the game, but valve fucked up. download the update 1 file. the directions on that are little more clear, but you run the update.portal.2.exe, update your shit, then copy and paste the 4 files (they're the same as the launcher.exe etc) to your programfiles/valve/portal2. 

there is also a bin file in the update. you paste the dll's from the update to the same folder you pasted the last ones in.

PROTIP: DO NOT TOUCH THE BIN FILE IN PROGRAMFILES/VALVE/PORTAL2/BIN

YOU WANT THE BIN THAT'S IN 
PROGRAMFILES/VALVE/PORTAL2/PORTAL2/BIN

for fucks sake you ignorant fucks. Now, how the fuck do I play multiplayer?"

To play coop over lan or Hamachi:

1) Enter the game one both computers and Enable Developer Console in the options.

2) Hit "" ` "" to open the console. Then type in... sv_lan 1.

3) The client should connect first as it disconnects if the host is in the empty game for a few seconds, but the client can wait forever.
Client: Type into the console... connect replacing the with an ip.
For example... connect 192.168.1.3

4) Host then selects the map by entering into their own console... map mp_coop_ replacing the with the name of the map of choice listed below.
For example... map mp_coop_start

5) The host will connect and the client will see the blue bar fill, finally entering the game.

,blackbare,2011-05-01T01:34Z,"I really appreciate extremezone and skidrow for their efforts to get this and other games available for evaluation.  Unfortunately my graphics card is not supported by this build. I have the G41 Intel Chipset on my laptop.  It surpassed the needed requirements to run the game, I am being told it is a ""name brand"" issue.

If Valve wants myself and others to buy and support their products they really need to stop boot-licking ATI and Nvidia and start thinking a bit more about universal compatibly.

Other than that issue, I am sure it is a great game and look forward to an upgrade patch for the graphics cards."

It's not my computer because I have a crack of the original Portal game and it works flawlessly. Every other game I have runs without problems. It seems to be this cracked version. Anyone know of a way to fix it? I'm about 3/4 into the game but it seems to be happening much more frequently now. It's doing it much more in the third quarter than it was doing in the whole first half.

,ko4jesus,2011-05-03T03:44Z,"@risket theres a new crack that was released. i heard the original crack had some problems which is probably the crack used in this torrent. just dl the new crack and use that and hopefully that solves it. I dont know why but some people say the game runs fine for them, others say the opposite. maybe the people that say it runs fine havent actually played the whole game yet..."
,ko4jesus,2011-05-03T03:48Z,"@nerdpcr did you install the crack into the installation folder after you installed the game. if not, open up the crack folder and drag and drop it into the portal 2 installation folder and click move and replace when it prompts you that message. if you did install the crack and everything, your computer might not be able to run the game. it wouldnt be a problem with the torrent itself because a lot of people have it up and running and extremezone is an excellent uploader"

I Myself had this problem, stupidly enough, i figured out that the crack (in the skidrow folder)
was in the wrong section, DO NOT put it into the bin folder, go into the Portal2 > bin folder (there is a folder named portal 2 IN the installation directory) you will see 2 folders, named client and server.dll, THAT is what you replace. ENJOY!"

Wondering if anyone encountered this issue/bug in CO-OP or is it just me that didn't solve a puzzle correctly:

I and a friend went from the beginning to level 6 where they are blown up by Glados.  When we reached the Hub we see the control panel that should have two red arrow buttons...doesn't have the red buttons and it shows like levels locked.  The reason I know this cause went and looked at a walkthru.  Also there is a portable wall across a pit that leads to the area where you go to the next maps that does not appear or rather it is not revealed.  

Is this a bug or we did something wrong and it's the puzzle messing with us...we were banging our heads all night long yesterday...PLZ HELP!!!"

If it freeze after the valve screen, on the portal 2 screen, it means the skidrow files are not at the right place : the ones in the portal 2/bin go in the programm/valve/portal 2/portal 2/bin.

For the appid probleme, if you have only 2 choices in the main menu like I had, just run the launcher IN ADMINISTRATOR MODE !

Step 3: Open the SKIDROW Folder

Step 5: Open the game using Portal 2.exe or Portal 2 (application)

Step 6: Seed and enjoy"

,alwaysan,2011-06-04T01:40Z,"@exodus1992: It happend to me with l4d2, if your pc has more than 1 processor ( dual, quad, etc) do the following  steps (this helped me with l4d2, dunno if it works with portal 2):

1. Open the game
2. Go back to desktop ( do not close the game, use alt + tab )
3. open task manager
4. in the proccesses tab, select the game process and right click it.
5. Select set affinity
6. Uncheck all the checkbox except the first. Example
  my lap is a quad core, so it shows 
 [x]>
 [x]CPU 0
 [x]CPU 1
 [x]CPU 2
 [x]CPU 3

 set it to:
 [  ]>
 [x]CPU 0
 [  ]CPU 1
 [  ]CPU 2
 [  ]CPU 3"

1. Installed game as usual from main image on this torrent.
2. Downloaded the Portal 2 Update 1 (which also included the latest crack fix!)
3. Installed the Update 1 from the exe.
4. Copied over the crack file files into the main game directory.
5. Ran game from cracked ""portal2"" exe.

I was given a warning by Avast! saying that I was opening a potentially unsafe application and that I should run it in sandbox mode, however this would cause the game to crash. I tried running it without sandbox mode and the game loads and works fine. Hopefully no issues with malware but I'll do a full system scan just to be safe; seems fine so far (but you never know)."

After you have done that, right click on the valve folder and uncheck 'read only'. Your game should now load properly!

,BangoSkank19,2011-08-19T03:02Z,"For those of you who get the game crash when you try to load the game after youve already played it at least once before, this is what worked for me.  If you didnt download the seperate skidrow portal 2 crack torrent, download that and reinstall portal 2 with that crack.  After that, everytime you try to play portal 2 again, make sure both the portal 2 game and your desktop screen resolution are set to 800x600.  

This will be easier for your video card to handle, and will decrease the chance of a crash due to your video card.  if this works for you, comment and tell people because it will increase chances for people to read many comments saying the same thing than finding one comment in a thousand."

I press Ignore, then I go to the folder after the installation, I try to copy the crack, but I can't. I don't have permission to copy WTF. Also, it doesn't install the Portal2.exe.

2. Right after the very last cut-scene that takes place in space, as soon as the screen cuts out the game stops responding. 

Pleas tell me how to fix these if there are ways. 

Also is it possible to get on multiplayer?? I clicked it and it said I wasn't connected to the internet.

Anyhow, just wanted to comment to say how terrrible the scene has become. In the past you rarely got a dl but today with these Skidrow being the most prolific 'wants' its all changed.

This 'Skidrow' are are poor coding group, really. Their shit rarely works. They don't attend to their business after either and fix what dosen't work - they are the worse kind of group. A group that pumps out shit and cares less. They are not in the essence of what free software is all about. They have little to no ethos.

In this game (for example) there is a 'Language' app - the only fucking thing that works floorlessly. Kinda sad.

Their Anno 2070 has a known and proven trojan in it. What the fuck is wrong with these guys?

I'm not using my bandwidth or risking a spanking by downloading anymore of their dissapointing shit. I've boycotted this group.

Oh, and by the way, my PC is motherfucking tiptop.
peace and take the advice ! NO downloads like this should be so troublesome, they are continually failing to bring out stable games and imo the TROJAN is unacceptable for a supposed reputable group. No group assfucks you who are worth their salt.

My problem is that when I try to install it half way through it I get a message ""file currupt"", asks me if I want to igonore,rety or abort; If I say rety, it just keeps happening, if I say igonore, the game keeps installing, but the problem is when playing the game I get a bunch of those blue ""Error"" in place of models, as I understand it those appear in the game when you're missing models, which makes sense because of the problems I'm having with the install. Obviously I can't try the rebuild cache option, because it would try to connect to steam to re-download it; But I can't believe extreme zobe would upload a currupted image either, I must be doing something wrong? I have tried to mount the image with Alcohol, Daemon tools, and power ISO, always with the same result, unfortunately I don't have a dual layer DVD writer to try and burn it.
So the question is, are there specific settings on the virtual drives that I need? A better virtual drive soft I could download? I also tried downloading the other image here at PB with the same eaxct results, in fact I'm posting this over there as well..

,fluxerik,2012-05-18T01:57Z,"Hay !

I downloaded and installed this one last week, that went ok. But whenever try to launch it i get the language selection pop-up and so i select a language. When i click OK the screen goes away and i nothing happens.... When i try to launch it again within a few seconds i get the error: önly one instance can be running at a time"". But only for a few seconds.

I literally tried every crack i found and reinstalled it a hundred times. I searched google for weeks now and i still haven't found anything usefull, not even someone with the same issue. 

This also happens with portal 1. I was able to play both portals perfectly a few months ago. I can also play almost play any game i want , i can  play skyrim on medium without too much lag, so i don't think it's a graphics issue.

Does anyone of you have a solution??

Please help :(
