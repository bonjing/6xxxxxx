RELEASE NOTES

Portal 2 draws from the award-winning formula of innovative gameplay,
story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry
accolades and created a cult following.

The single-player portion of Portal 2 introduces a cast of dynamic new
characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of
devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of
the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally
murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.

The games two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely
separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new
player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider
everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require
them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.

Features:

Extensive single player: Featuring next generation gameplay and a
wildly-engrossing story.

Complete two-person co-op: Multiplayer game featuring its own dedicated
story, characters, and gameplay.

Advanced physics: Allows for the creation of a whole new range of
interesting challenges, producing a much larger but not harder game.

Original music.

Massive sequel: The original Portal was named 2007's Game of the Year
by over 30 publications worldwide.
