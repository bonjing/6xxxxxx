         Rookie co-pilot Scott and Buffalo Airlines captain AJ face    
         their worst nightmare when low fog and engine malfunction     
         of the Curtiss C-46 Commando result in one of the toughest    
         landings of their lives. Ambitious young flyer Alex must      
         prove himself when Buffalo's chief pilot, Arnie, gives him    
          control of the 20-ton Douglas DC-4 for the very first time.

         we consider the spotlight segments part of the show since     
         the TV-PG-L logo appears and it is something a viewer would   
         not want to miss. also the length is 44:* which is typical    
         for MG stuff. If i cut the spotlights out then the show       
          is only 43* which is not standard NG run time.
