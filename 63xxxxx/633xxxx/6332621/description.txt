lil kims part from get money the best part of course 
 lyrics 

Niggas..betta grab a seat
grab on ya dick as this bitch gets deep
Deeper than a pussy of a bitch 6 feet
stiff dicks feel sweet in this little petite
Young Bitch from the streets guaranteed to stay down
used to bring work outta town on Greyhound
Now Im Billboard now/niggas pressed to hit it
play me like a chicken,
thinkin Im pressed to get it
Rather do the killin than the stick up jooks
rather count a million while you eat my pussy-pushme
to the limit get my feelings in
get me open while Im cummin down your throat-in
you wanna be my main squeeze nigga-dontcha
you wanna lick between my knees nigga
dontcha wanna see me wit Big and 3 down the ave.
blow up spots on bitches because Im there
Break up affairs lick shots in the air
you get vex and start swingin everywhere
me shiftee? Now you wanna pistil whip me
pull out your 9, while I cock on mine
and what nigga/I aint got time for this
so what nigga/Im not tryin to hear that shit
Now you wanna buy me diamonds and Armani suits
Adrienne Vittadini and Chanel Nine boots
Things to make up for all the games and the lies
Hallmark cards, sayin I apologize
Is you wit me, how could you ever decieve me
but paybacks a bitch motherfucker, believe me
Naw I aint gay this aint no lesbo flow
jus a lil somethin to let you motherfuckers know....
