,kcjo,2011-04-22T20:57Z,If it works I'll seed it. Not like that fucking skidrow shit that crashes every 5 goddamned seconds. but Im not bitter. 
,reenmini,2011-04-22T21:21Z,"I'd seed if I could get it first.

150 peers...and one seeder? WTF is this?"
,reenmini,2011-04-22T21:22Z,"I'd seed if I could download it.

150 peers and one seeder? WTF."
,harrisoniscool,2011-04-22T22:35Z,"Hey guys, if you need help, or want to support me i have a tut on how to get portal 2 here

http://lnk.co/G1U7K

thanks"
,theguywhosaidsawesome,2011-04-23T11:27Z,"I swear i will seed if I finish downloading, I will seed until I delete this game (which will hopefully take 4394 years)"
,theguywhosaidsawesome,2011-04-23T11:28Z,Seed please
,Leiemorderen,2011-04-23T23:59Z,"I'll seed for months if it works, and actually finishes...
Seriously, 1 seed? This must be a really new upload (or people are just being dicks)."
,snoopy315,2011-04-24T00:21Z,I'm a noob. it stopped and 96% and its downloading at 0.2 kb/s and says theres 0(0) seeds. what do i do or what does it mean?
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-24T10:57Z,It wants me to burn the game to disk? I don't have a 6.5 Gb disk!  D:
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-24T12:20Z,"Ok i extracted with winrar but now i can't run setup, some instructions would be really helpful for this noobasaurus ^^'"
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-24T12:24Z,"I see the problem, i have no setup-1a, is it in another folder or something? I can't find it :/"
,pberry,2011-04-24T14:23Z,You sure you downloaded this from this torrent? 
,pberry,2011-04-24T14:24Z,"The fail is called ""Setup.exe"""
,Leiemorderen,2011-04-24T19:01Z,"Okay, so the torrent finished, I mounted it with Daemon Tools, installed the game, and all works just fine, I get the Valve and powered by Source Logo's, but then I get what looks like it's  a loading screen (picture of robot guy) and then a message comes up that says ""Portal2.exe has stopped working"" and my firewall (that I just dropped) says that it will look for a solution. Did I do something wrong? I have a Windows 7 Gateway laptop with a ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 graphics card if that makes a difference. I am sort of a noob to torrenting games, so please bear with me..."
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-24T19:10Z,"I fixed my problems but then got exactly the same problem as above. It turned out to be some windows (i'm running vista btw so its not just 7) program stopping it working to ""protect my computer"" so i tried to disable it but it wont let me :/  "
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-25T04:25Z,"This is what stops me running it ""Data Execution Prevention (DEP) is a security feature that can help prevent damage to your computer from viruses and other security threats."" It won't let me create an exception for portal2"
,pberry,2011-04-25T14:44Z,"I am using AVG, I have no problems. Weird. errr you sure you cracked it too? ( used the crack and put it in the game folder )"
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-25T21:36Z,"I have no idea what ""the crack"" is. :S  And I assume you mean the steam games folder under my account?"
,xcrakz,2011-04-25T22:15Z,"do we copy all the ""skidrow"" folder to the game dir or just the portal2.exe file?"
,xcrakz,2011-04-25T22:17Z,do we copy all the skidrow folder to the game dir or only the portal2.exe file?
,Leiemorderen,2011-04-26T01:52Z,"Ok, sorry, I figured it out. I just put the crack in the wrong place =P
Great torrent! Thanks a bunch!"
,reenmini,2011-04-26T05:53Z,Where exactly does one put the crack?
,reenmini,2011-04-26T06:05Z,"Never mind that last question? What does one do when reaching the menu screen and the only options selected are ""No steam"" and ""exit""?"
,reenmini,2011-04-26T06:08Z,"Also, where can I change the APP ID as instructed in the skidrow file?"
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-26T19:45Z,Leiemorderen how did you fix it?
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-26T19:56Z,"Ok. I downloaded the torrent, it came up as a powertogo file. I used winrar to extract the files, they came out . I clicked the installer and it all installed with no problems and it appeared in a new folder in program files called valve. The game opens, shows the valve logo then crashes before the start menu. Where have i gone horribly wrong?"
,thatcooltroll,2011-04-26T20:06Z,"Ok. So I downloaded the torrent, it came up as a power2go file. I extracted it with winrar, I ran the install no problems. The game + files appeared in a folder in program files called steam (without skidrow) i try to run the application, i get to a loading screen then crash. Where did i go horribly wrong?"
,reenmini,2011-04-26T21:16Z,"Does anyone else get the menu screen where the only options are ""no steam"" and ""quit""? What do I do?"
,pberry,2011-04-28T02:10Z,"Here is some help:
Okay, go to the folder that you downloaded my file. The .rar file unextract it.
Go to the folder press setup.exe when the install is done. Go back to the folder and press on the ""SKIDROW"" folder. Mine is located at
E:\torrents\Portal.2-SKIDROW\sr-port2\SKIDROW
anyway copy all the files inside it.
Then go to the location WHERE YOU INSTALLED THE GAME and paste all the files there. ;') Then start the game simple"
,iamaemokid,2011-04-28T06:29Z,"So like so many ""seeders"" yet only getting 1.0 kb/s 49 are on right now, yet they are not seeding correctly.... thanks guys."

,Supa15,2011-04-30T14:00Z,"After 17 long hours of downloading i actually got this to work,but is this supposed to enable multilpayer or not because i really want to play co-op. thanks for the torrent."
,pberry,2011-04-30T15:05Z,^You can play coop with firends ( lan only ) tried it with my friends ;')
,Brando2600,2011-04-30T15:24Z,"So i've disabled DEP, but I still crash at the loading screen. I see nothing with ""crack"" in the name minus the .iso file. Help?"
,ProSkittlez,2011-04-30T19:11Z,"Worked for me.

Step-by-step instuctions:
1. Download
2. Extract iso file
3. Run setup and install
4. Copy and paste everything from inside your SKIDROW folder into your newly installed Portal 2 folder. (Mine's at C:\Program Files (x86)\Valve\Portal 2)
5. Press Launcher.exe inside the newly installed Portal 2 folder
6. Enjoy"

There is no point of the co op patch becuase
you go to developer consol ( ~ ) type sv_lan 1
and
map mp_coop_start

then on the second game

consol ~
connect localip of host

and done you are playing...."
,androidphonefan,2011-05-03T11:22Z,"Why does the installer title say ""Postal 2""?"
,stelis007,2011-05-05T16:48Z,"I installed the game, putted the files into valve/portal 2 folder BUT when i start the game (whith Luncher) it says ""AppId is not configurred"". Then the game starts but there is a screen with the NO STEAM button and QUIT. The first does nothing...I consider that you have the perfect pc that can play the game but everyone with this problem DOES NOT...
I wait an intresting solution."
,Aldana11,2011-05-06T17:57Z,"Oh boy i can't believe you people can even make it out of your homepage.

Step one: Download Torrent

Step two: Install

Step Three: Open skidrow folder

Step Four: Copy everything in that folder, and replace it where the original portal files are

Step Five: Seed"
,a_fellow_pirate,2011-05-13T05:59Z,I did everything perfectly the first time because of pberry's help and Aldana11's help I don't see how it's so difficult?

,guitarjoa,2011-05-29T23:44Z,"Wonderful! Works great on my 2009 MBP (xp bootcamp). Just install, drag crack files into the folder and it works (after a little tweaking with the video settings). Only problem is that my laptop gets too hot sometimes so the game quits, but with some extra quicksaves (F6), no problem. BTW game is better than expected... Thanks!"

Does not happen to me."
,sheepishly-Liz,2011-07-23T20:29Z,"thatcooltroll mentioned some months ago that they couldn't run the setup because a popup would say that the ""setup-1a.bin"" file couldn't be found. Later you said you fixed it but you didn't say how. My friend is having the same problem and I don't know how to help her since I didn't have that problem. Can someone please help???"
,sheepishly-Liz,2011-07-23T20:32Z,oh and the game crashes on me too...if there's a way to fix that that would be nice since I'm trying to go through the whole game with the creators' commentaries but it doesn't save the progress of the game when you do that.

,pberry,2011-08-15T18:27Z,"Okay to all the retarded, and stupid people.

Enough with spamming me on YouTube and saying that the torrent sucks. 

Learn to fucking read, please. 
I won't tell you where the help is but its on this torrent somewhere. Enjoy."
,BryanLink,2011-10-02T08:52Z,"I downloaded it and did everything you told me to do and when i start the game it just freezes at the Portal 2 Screen and no menu!!!
HELP ME!!!"
,Suriyel,2011-10-09T14:23Z,"I think I know what you guys are doing wrong and thats why the game always crashes right after it finishes the main loading. Notice the folder 'portal2' in the SKIDROW folder? The contents inside are suppose to go into ""Valve > Portal 2 > portal2 > bin."" Not ""Valve > Portal 2 > bin."" The rest of the files go directly into ""Valve > Portal 2."" Afterwards it worked for me. Hope this helped!"
,senorpianist,2011-10-17T23:23Z,U KNOW AFTER I PUT THE CRACK IN THE CORRECT FOLDER THE GAME STARTS BUT CRASHES REGULARLY.IT DOSNT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF U KEEP SAVING UR GAMES CONSTANTLY BUT IT IS IRRITATING NEVERTHELESS.HONESTLY IVE NEVER COME ACROSS A GAME WHICH CRASHES SO FREQUENTLY LIKE THIS ONE.REALLY STRANGE
,turrel,2011-11-29T17:37Z,"nice way to help your supporters berry,"
,rockeronthelookout,2012-02-18T15:38Z,"Hello all, first time posting here. Just downloaded this torrent, thanks extremezone. But I'm having a problem. NO IT'S not the crack! :)
My problem is that when I try to install it half way through it I get a message ""file currupt"", asks me if I want to igonore,rety or abort; If I say rety, it just keeps happening, if I say igonore, the game keeps installing, but the problem is when playing the game I get a bunch of those blue ""Error"" in place of models, as I understand it those appear in the game when you're missing models, which makes sense because of the problems I'm having with the install. Obviously I can't try the rebuild cache option, because it would try to connect to steam to re-download it; But I can't believe extreme zobe would upload a currupted image either, I must be doing something wrong? I have tried to mount the image with Alcohol, Daemon tools, and power ISO, always with the same result, unfortunately I don't have a dual layer DVD writer to try and burn it.
So the question is, are there specific settings on the virtual drives that I need? A better virtual drive soft I could download? I also tried downloading the other image here at PB with the same eaxct results, in fact I'm posting this over there as well..
HELP! :)"
,Helper84,2012-05-14T22:26Z,"I found out how this works and it worked for me. after you have this installed get the crack from extremezone. Copy steam client.dII, Launcher.exe, and portal2.exe over to program files(x86)/valve/portal2 and copy and replace them. Go back to the crack and go to  the folder portal2, then the folder bin. Copy both client/dII and server.dII. go back to the installed folder where you earlier copied and go to the portal 2 folder then bin and paste. With that it worked perfect for me and the game is great!"
