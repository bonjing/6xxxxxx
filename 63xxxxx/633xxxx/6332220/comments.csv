The tracks are VRB 256 (192~320 insane)

I'm very pissed that not 
Dino Merlin - Love In Rewind (Bosnia & Herzegovina) 
or
Raphael Gualazzi - Madness Of Love (Italy)  
won.

Also
the followings deserved better place (in my opinion):
Lena - Take by A Stranger (Germany) (remembers me of BjĂÂśrk)
Paradise Oskar - Da Da Dam (Finland) (beautiful and sweet)
Sjonni's Friends - Coming Home (Iceland) 
Evelina Sasenko - C'est Ma Vie (Lithuania)  (beautiful Barbara Straisand like song and well performed)
I agree with those who say Eurovision is political, (the pipeline might play a role here too ). I personaly will boycott next year's Baku Eurovision, they never have been European and never will, they certainly didn't deserve 1-st place. "
