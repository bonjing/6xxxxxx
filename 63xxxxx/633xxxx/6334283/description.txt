- Oscar-nominated Director Tim Hetherington and Pulitzer-finalist Photojournalist Chris Hondros Killed on Front Lines of Libyan Conflict

Award-winning photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros were killed Wednesday when they came under fire in Libya. Hetherington and Hondros, who had covered conflict zones around the world, were part of a group of six photographers reporting on the Libyan conflict in a particularly dangerous part of the besieged city of Misurata. We speak with Carroll Bogert of Human Rights Watch, who worked closely with Hetherington commissioning and disseminating his photos from war-torn regions. Most recently Hetherington helped photograph secret police files from the Quaddafi documenting the brutality of the regime. To discuss the life and work of Hondros, we speak with Christina Larson, a contributing editor to Foreign Policy magazine. We are also joined by Mohamed Dayem of the Committee to Protect Journalists about the increasing dangers faced by reporters covering conflicts in the region.


- Thought Control: Right-Wing Koch Brothers Caught Telling Thousands of Employees How To Vote

The Nation magazine has revealed that Koch Industries sent a letter to most of its 50,000 employees on the eve of the November elections advising them on whom to vote for and warned them of the dire consequences should they choose to vote otherwise. As a result of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling last year, Koch Industries and other corporations are now legally allowed to pressure their workers to adopt their political views. Koch Industries is run by the billionaire brothers, Charles and David Koch, who have helped bankroll the Tea Party movement and dozens of other right-wing causes, including the recent attacks on public sector employees and unions going on in many states.


- "Dr. Death" Agrees to Stop Evaluating Mentally Disabled Texas Death Row Prisoners

Last Friday, Texas reprimanded a psychologist who used what critics say were unscientific methods to examine at least 25 Texas death row prisoners for intellectual disabilities, two of whom were later executed. Dr. George Denkowski was the go-to psychologist for prosecutors who wanted to prove defendants were not mentally handicapped-and therefore eligible for the death penalty. Democracy Now! first covered Dr. Denkowksi in January 2010 in a video report by RenÃ©e Feltz that accompanied her story for The Texas Observer magazine. For an update, we're joined by Texas Defender Service attorney, Kathryn Kase, and by Dr. Jerome Brown, the psychologist filed the complaint that ultimately resulted in Denkowksi's agreement to stop evaluating people in criminal cases.
