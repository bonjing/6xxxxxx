                Echoes of the Dead.
                When a young woman is found dressed like a bride and
                drowned in a bath, it triggers a spate of ghoulish
                wedding-themed murders in Great Worthy. The case
                takes Barnaby and Jones to a donkey sanctuary, a
                heritage steam railway and a pub run by an ex-copper
                and former brothel madam. Could history be repeating
                itself?
