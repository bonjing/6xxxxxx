,allotrios,2011-04-23T08:16Z,Ooo! Does it contain the turret opera near the end? I heard the game files don't include that lovely piece. Such a shame.
,skelekitty,2011-04-23T10:55Z,"Aww, this doesn't contain the Turret Opera. Can we get that to, please?"
,nova216,2011-04-23T12:37Z,"Turret oepra should be in my other torrent ""Portal 2 speech"" but... there are a lot of files. 
PD: Im still looking for that file xdd if i find it, i let you know ;)"
,skelekitty,2011-04-24T03:10Z,"Thanks nova216, I would appreciate it if you could help me find it - there are a LOT of files :p"
,nova216,2011-05-05T13:04Z,"TUrret opera song is not in this torrent. EIther in my other p2 uploads... Portal turret opera is inside the final video, so cant extract that... SOrry people... :("
,XSuperToasterX,2011-06-09T23:52Z,"Everyone, the turret opera found just before the credit sequence is properly named ""Cara Mia."" You can probably find it with that title, or record a youtube video's sound with audacity. If you need any help, message me or something. If there isn't an inbox system, i'll check back here if you need help."
