Plot
----
The alien criminal from the first movie is dead, but he left a few eggs which are hatching now. The good alien (Lloyd Gallagher), who still inhabits Tom Beckâ€™s Michael Welden body, has been waiting just in case this happened. Unfortunately, his presence in the body has taken a terrible toll on it, draining it of life energy. Additionally relations with Beckâ€™s daughter Juliet (Kate Hodge) (now a cop) have deteriorated (possibly due to his bizarre behavior caused by the alien inhabiting inside his father). But when the killing starts again, they will need to work together to stop the new generation of aliens.
