,HelloDolly1,2011-04-24T00:39Z,"Great stuff. Great idea for a television show. But I would like to see Dave Chappelle here. He's a really intelligent comedian as well...

And George Carlin, if he wasn't dead."
,shimigami777,2011-04-24T09:48Z,Chappelle is a joke. Funniest man alive but couldn't play the game.
,SGAK,2011-04-30T19:58Z,I would have replaced Gervais with either Eddie Izzard or Patton Oswalt. 
,dlxmax,2011-05-04T06:06Z,Gervais was the man who brought this all together!
,AudreyFawkes,2011-06-05T10:39Z,"Hilarious. Ricky Gervais is a genius, probably the second best comedian next to Bill Hicks. 
Thanks for this!"
,killyourself,2011-06-06T08:26Z,@SGAK You're mental. Ricky Gervais is one of the most brilliant comedians of our time. Pure godamn genius.
