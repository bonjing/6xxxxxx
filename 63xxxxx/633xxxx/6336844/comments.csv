Personally, there are better ways and texts for learning Japanese, but this is what UNM uses.  It's stupid expensive at the book store.  The online version of the text book is $35.  The CDs and work-book are $100 more, so that's why I'm trying to help out here."

Thanks for the upload, would be sweet if you could get the whole package up. 

Nakama isn't a bad book; I prefer it over Genki. UCD students use Nakama, and they're farrrr more proficient than SCC students using Genki. Can't just blame the book though"
