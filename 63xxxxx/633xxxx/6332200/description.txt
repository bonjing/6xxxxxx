kuslig erotik och surrealistisk skrÃ¤ck blandas. Brutala, ruffiga S-M-scener och andlÃ¶st sensuella scener om vartannat i klassisk Lynch-stil. Dennis Hopper och Isabella Rossellini Ã¤r enormt bra --- Possibly the most influential American film of the 1980's, David Lynch's bizarre erotic mystery spawned a whole raft of imitations with its portrayal of the dark underside of American small-town life. Critics and audiences responded to Lynch's original and startling images of sex and violence and made the film a box-office smash. Blue Velvet is renowned for creating, in Dennis Hopper's Frank, one of the greatest screen villains of all time - "Baby wants to fuck!"

one of the best movies of the 80s
