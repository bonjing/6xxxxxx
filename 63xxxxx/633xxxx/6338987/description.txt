Three different TV appearances ('67-'70) including old interviews, performances and the commentaries about specific songs by band members. 

Whether you refer to him as The Lizard King or his self-coined anagram, Mr. Mojo Risin', the fact remains that Jim Morrison was as fascinating to watch as he was to listen to. Thus, any DVD that showcases this mesmerizing frontman, along with the rest of The Doors, captured live will always be of interest to any fan of '60s rock. And "The Doors: Soundstage Performances" turns out to be a doozy. It offers us rare footage of the band on three television programs: a Toronto show from May '67, introduced by U.N.C.L.E. agent Noel Harrison and featuring a boogying audience and an excellent version of "The End" (though edited of its Oedipal content); a B&W Danish program from 1968, sans audience, but dishing out five Doors classics in a row; and a PBS program from 1969 called "Critique," also without audience, but featuring a half dozen tunes from the band (including an ultrarare live performance of "The Soft Parade") and an interesting interview segment, during which Morrison makes some very prescient comments regarding the future of the music biz. Other highlights of this disc, for me, include a brief line reading from "The WASP" as an intro of sorts for "Love Me Two Times"; a nicely theatrical rendition of "The Unknown Soldier"; a fine, stripped-down version of "Wishful Sinful"; and the rarely played Morrison blues shuffle "Build Me A Woman." Surviving band members Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore were interviewed in 2002 for this collection, and their latter-day thoughts should prove of great interest to all fans of this great band. Finally, though others have groused about the picture quality of the PBS segment, I thought it perfectly serviceable...and really, where are you going to see it any better? My advice to all is to rent this one out, plop it in, crank it up and just enjoy until the music is, well, over.
