,RadleyGH,2011-05-06T11:44Z,"I don't know why nobody has mentioned, but the audio is completely terrible about 25minutes into the first cd. It never gets fixed.

The first 25minutes is perfect quality, both video and audio, and then suddenly the audio drops off and you can hear background noise and all of the voices and sound effects are very quiet (but you can still understand it).

Find another copy."
