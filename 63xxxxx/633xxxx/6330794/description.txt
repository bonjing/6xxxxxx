Charlie (1979) - Fight Dirty

Ripped from vinyl using a Technics SL-D205 direct drive turntable (that's at least as old as this album!) and a Stanton 681EEE cartridge. Turntable phono preamped through a Yamaha stereo amplifier and into PC sound card via analog cable. Not the best signal chain, mind you, but it does OK. Encoded to WAV using Cool Edit 2000. I was able to remove most of the pops and clicks with Cool Edit 2000. There is some remaining surface noise and a bit of turntable rumble in the audio that I was unable to remove without degrading the sound quality.
