          Down tempo dubstep and glitch-hop instrumentals. Marklar sees the prolific Heyoka refining his dense, driving, energetic sound as well as exploring some dance floor beats a little more than previously. The signature acidic zaps and fizz, dislocated melodic motifs and lumbering beats are all strongly in evidence. Pumping basslines morph from warping sub-bass depths to gritty, gurgling effected lines of thinner tone - often with more than one layer present. Synths warble, pulse and percolate in the mid frequency range forming a busy latticework of sound upon which playful high frequency lines dance and strut. The middle section of the album sees Heyoka picking up the tempo with some crisp drum and bass grooves that really define Heyoka as an artist.

          Now, out of my review tone, THIS ALBUM IS THE SHIT! Definitely download if you are a Heyoka fan or just a straight up Dubstep/Downtempo lover. Nonetheless, this is a great addition to the Heyoka archives and maybe your own archives of goodness, happy listening!

Oh, and P.S.
Please seed, my friends. My computer isn't the best and I can only seed for a bit so keep this wonderful torrent going!
