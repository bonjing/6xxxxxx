Description:
This well-crafted and timely thriller uncovers a terrorist plot 

stretching from the Middle East to the American West. When recently 

widowed Mountie Dan Graham pulls a dying girl from a river, her 

tremulous last words lead Dan to track down the girl's father, a 

washed-up conspiracy theorist reporter who has finally stumbled upon a 

genuine conspiracy. California bookseller Maggie Conlin searches for 

her husband, traumatized Iraq war contractor Jake, who has kidnapped 

their young son, Logan, and fled to Montana. Samara Ingram, an Iraqi-

British nurse whose husband and son were brutally murdered in Baghdad 

by renegade Western troops, takes slow steps toward retribution. 

Mofina (Every Fear) shifts smoothly and deftly among their stories 

until all three are drawn together in the final, suspense-packed rush 

to prevent a devastating moment of destruction and revenge.
