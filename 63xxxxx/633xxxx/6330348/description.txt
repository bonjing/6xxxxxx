The nation grew up with Top of the Pops and it was always a talking point, 
but 35 years ago a particular kind of Top of the Pops programme and tone held sway. 
This documentary explores Top of the Pops in 1976 - as a barometer of the state 
of pop and light entertainment TV.

It celebrates the power of the programme and observes British society of the mid 70s, 
British TV and the British pop scene. In 1976, glam was over and nothing had replaced 
it - the charts belonged to Showaddywaddy, Brotherhood of Man and the Wurzels, all to 
be found on Top of the Pops hosted by the Radio 1 DJs. If you wanted rock you looked 
to the Old Grey Whistle Test, while outside the charts a new scene was rumbling.

Contributors include Tony Blackburn, David 'Diddy' Hamilton, Paul Morley, Toyah Willcox, 
Showaddywaddy, Brotherhood of Man, the Wurzels and Dave Haslam.
