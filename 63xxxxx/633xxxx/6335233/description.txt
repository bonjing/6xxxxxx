Two years after the phenomenal success of Halo for the Xbox, Microsoft has finally ported this first-person alien shooter to Windows--just in time to promote the release of Halo 2 for Xbox. In Halo, you control the Master Chief, an enhanced soldier awakened from cryogenic sleep to save humankind from a nasty group of aliens called the Covenant. Although the PC version only adds a few maps and loses the cooperative mode, the impressive graphics, exciting gameplay, and variety of weapons and vehicles make Halo worth a try for any fans of first-person shooters.

First run the setup, next run Halo.exe to start the game.
