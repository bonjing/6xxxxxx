    A comedy/drama/horror film. Billy Jump is an 80's rock star.             
    Alexander Keaton is a corporate lackey with a cheating fiance. Vida     
    is an evil mother in-law who torments Jean, her daughter in-law,         
    incessantly. But Billy Jump is electrocuted by his guitar. Alexander     
    has his head chopped off by a samurai. And Vida is mysteriously          
    poisoned by tapioca pudding. Then the dead randomly start coming back    
    to life. They don't eat brains, but they do want their old lives         
    back. We follow the trials and tribulations of these three as they       
    try to pick up where they left off, to mixed results. Billy Jump is      
    trying to get his band back together for a big comeback, only to find    
    that his old band members aren't quite the same people they used to      
    be. Alexander wants his job back, but has been replaced by a             
    computer, and his fiance has taken his house and is shacking up with    
    another woman. Exhausted, he is taken in by a goth girl who has a        
    thing for dead guys, and a vendetta against her father, Alex's former    
    boss. Vida is determined to get rid of Jean once and for all, but        
    finds that Jean is no longer the weak-willed pushover she once was.      
    The rivalry between the two turns into an all out war once Roger,        
    Vida's son, leaves for a business trip. The three stories are            
    inter-cut together until we reach three action-packed pulse-pounding     
    climaxes, which tie up loose ends with some surprising revelations.
