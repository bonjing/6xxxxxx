,biRdyxLoCo,2011-04-30T20:44Z,Around how many players do you have on the server? 
,psolives384,2011-05-01T01:28Z,There are 20 registered players. I have uploaded 40GB+ which would equal 20+ more players but people are downloading but not registering. I made guest accounts to entice people to register. The more registered players the better. All servers start small. I need players help to grow too.
,Heavensmile,2011-05-01T09:37Z,"Okay,My player name is Zelf Eray,It will be nice to meet you guys."
,biRdyxLoCo,2011-05-01T12:24Z,Had a great time playing! Its an easy install and the server is great all it needs is more players.
,Heavensmile,2011-05-07T10:46Z,"If possible it would be cool to not play in a single game, because we are not a lot in this server, So to play in a normal game To join the others would be cool."
