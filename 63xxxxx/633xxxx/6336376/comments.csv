,eemekal,2011-05-29T19:06Z,how did you get the subs to work? i know all episodes are not subbed but i cant get any subs to work

Hm, do you use Media Player Classic? If so, you sometimes need to right click > filters > and then choose the right subtitles from there. That's the only thing I can think of. Sorry if this wasn't of any help :/"
,eemekal,2011-06-13T07:08Z,I have tried with +10 players and with alot of different codecs just cant get the subs to show... i ended up watching the dubbed version thx anyway
