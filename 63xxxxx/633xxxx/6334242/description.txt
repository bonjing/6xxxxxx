His own family is wiped out in an unexpected turn of events and Hao is forced to take refuge with the monks.

Note: Unlike the previous version which had Chineese hard coded sub(which made it hard to read the English soft coded sub). This version has a only English soft coded sub & the subtitle & video runs in sync. Thus easy to view. Also recommend you to use VLC player.
