,scyris99,2011-04-23T01:26Z,Why wouldn't you just use normal 7zip insted of this 9.20 one? I been trying to find it but most dl sites I have found its infected with.. things like viruses etc.
,scyris99,2011-04-23T01:32Z,Nevermind I found it on 7-zip.org I was using 4.65. I must be tired and not thining right. Hopefully this doesn't have the issues the other versions did where the mouse won't work on stage 2
