Auto-Updating? That's the first time I've heard that on TPB, but I'm not that regular these days..."
,SerialExperience,2011-04-24T01:18Z,The release automatically downloads and applies updates when you run it.
,Insomneac,2011-04-24T04:26Z,What server does it use for the updates?
,Unrealized_,2011-04-24T12:10Z,"@Insomneac

It uses SERiALEXPERiENCE's own FTP server. Autoupdating is done with a tool called UUE."
,guest27016,2011-04-25T17:28Z,Torrent works very well and the updater (UUE) works as it's supposed to. Seeds is the only thing preventing this torrent from overtaking the vanilla skidrow torrent.

You must start MP through the console, by typing the map name and then the client joining via IP."
