,SuperInfinity,2011-08-20T19:40Z,The sound quality is kind of poor. Are they all like this or is there better quality?  
,TheDragonsPrayer,2012-04-12T23:56Z,"since you seem to like older films as well, is there any chance that you may be able to upload a movie I have been looking for literally YEARS, it's called  ""Babes In Arms"" (1939) film with Judy Garland & Mickey Rooney, if you could upload that I would be eternally grateful!!! =*-*="
