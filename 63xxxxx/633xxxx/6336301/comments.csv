,jengle88,2011-05-22T09:36Z,Any light on this matter would be appreciated.

,jengle88,2011-05-22T22:40Z,"Ok no worries, will I loose any quality of the movies changing them from m2ts to mpg ? "
,ThatsMine88,2011-05-23T21:46Z,Thanks halfmonkey i love the PS3 -team releases thank you very much. Is HDME still the site the rest of the team uploads on or have you guys moved else where?
