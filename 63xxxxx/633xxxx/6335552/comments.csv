,Flogan,2011-04-22T06:04Z,"Dude its cos episode 11 and 12 were classed as one ep as they were joined together, as classy christmas.  But when ep 11 came out u named it as 11, not 11 and 12, which is technically correct, if not annoyin as hell.
But thats where the problem is, lol"
,Esquilax,2011-04-22T06:11Z,11 and 12 were combined into one hour-long episode.
,damire,2011-04-22T06:51Z,so which episode is training day....love ya work
,damire,2011-04-22T06:56Z,so which ep is training day?
,oldpsx,2011-04-22T08:47Z,"uhm, who cares ? "
,boris72,2011-04-22T11:30Z,"Why would you choose Will Ferrel over Ricky Gervais? Gervais has his brilliant character (better than Michael Scott as a character, and a better actor/comedian than Steve Carrel) already set up in David Brent and could easily just flow straight in. He created the whole thing and still writes epsidoes, and he rehearsed for the spot, so unless he pulled out due to time he should have been picked. "
,palten83,2011-04-22T13:53Z,"@boris72:
Although I think Gervais would also do good as new manager, the answers to you question would be:

- Ferrel is bigger in US, equal status as Carell. This is needed because The Office is a big show.
- The Office US is characterized by refresment/renewal, both in characters as in storyline. Gervais would mean a step back, as he is from the show that ""The Office US"" is copied from.
- The ambiance is ""The Office UK"" is different from the US version. More serious and depressing. Also too realistic to make up for 22 episodes in one season."
,bubble09,2011-04-22T21:06Z,"Guys. IMDB, in their infinite wisdom, decided to call the double episode (11 & 12) just 11.
Thereby calling the real episode 13, episode 12. From there stems this unfortunate problem.
It's really not that big a deal."
,takfelt,2011-04-22T21:34Z,"You guys are such whiners.  Here this guy has uploaded perfect videos the same day the episode airs every single time, and you're worried about the number he gives the file?  

Thanks for the uploads!"
,dallanlee,2011-04-23T05:57Z,"To clear up any confusion, this is correctly titled episode 21 ""Michael's Last Dundies"". Follow the dates from the epguides.com website and compare the upload dates from VTV. You can paste this link into your url:

http://epguides.com/Office_US/

I only trust epguides. They're correct like 99% of the time.

Thanks VTV!"
,allswelles,2011-04-23T10:17Z,"Many thanks for sharing this!

There are always problems with THE OFFICE because some episode guides count the double episodes as two episodes and some as only one.

The obvious solution for uploaders is maybe to list the episode title as well as the (assumed) episode number?"
,Hazmop,2011-04-23T13:37Z,"@Ssbay
Episode 11 and 12 were together as a double episode.. So the labeling is correct."
,DJ_Battlewax,2011-04-23T17:02Z,"First and foremost: THANK YOU VTV!

*however*
According to dictionary.com's definition, an episode is, ""Movies, Radio, and Television . any one of the separate productions that constitute a serial.""
Pursuant to this definition, the reason why IMDB and so many others are calling ""Classy Christmas"" one episode is because it technically is.  There's no set time for an episode; the longer episodes are just a bonus for special events.
Aside from the dictionary, the other ""common sense"" way to determine why it is considered one episode: How many times did the opening and closing credits roll?  Once at the start, once at the finish=one episode.
It's easy to find the episode I want; I just look at IMDB and add one, since I know that's what the great VTV is uploading the episode under.  But I agree with the whiners that they are incorrectly labeled."
,Yeeeheee,2011-04-23T20:55Z,"OH my god, thanks for sharing it but this show gets worse episode  after episode; as you keep hoping it's going to go back to fun stuff, they find new ways to definitely make you give up. This one is just absolute crap."
,fs_pilot2,2011-04-23T22:05Z,thanks :D
,SAMLT3M,2011-04-25T04:26Z,They mixed the xmas party with the ultimatum episode boys haha
,aroyals,2011-04-29T09:13Z,"my guess to the ricky gervais question would be that he's in the money, he already gets a ton of money from this, US show so why would he want to work his ass off when he already gets paid for doing nothing?

don't give me ""pride"" or anything like that, we know from the podcasts that he's lazy etc..."
,Ginlyf,2011-05-22T22:17Z,thanks! :D
