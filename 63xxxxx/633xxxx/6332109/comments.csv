,juzz88,2011-04-21T10:47Z,"k00ker, this is NOT a problem with the copy. I have an original copy of the game on PS3 and have the same problem, as do ALL users on BOTH consoles.

This is a problem with the game and Big Ant ARE working on a patch."

,wri0013,2012-05-04T07:58Z,Shame on you guys. BigAnt Studios is a small development company who didn't even make a profit with this game. I don't mind pirating EA because they can afford to cover it. Lay off the small companies and buy their games!
