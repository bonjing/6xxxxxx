,DrLex,2011-05-30T22:40Z,Please avoid encoding films with a Bits/(Pixel*Frame) figure below 0.1. Unless you have enabled all bells and whistles of H.264 you shouldn't even go below 0.15. The value of 0.062 for this film is too low. The bare minimum file size to get good quality for this film would be around 1.3GiB.
,kevinzee,2011-09-10T13:07Z,Thanks. Great quality for 720p in 760MB.
