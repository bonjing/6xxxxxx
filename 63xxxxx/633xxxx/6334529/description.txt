Plot:
-----
A murderous alien master criminal and a master of disguise from outer space arrives on Earth and begins to inhabit human bodies, using them as hosts to disguise itself so that it can move around undetected. The creature likes to commit violent crimes, such as armed robbery and carjacking, and is willing to kill anyone that gets in its way, including children and law enforcement officers. It also seems to enjoy driving Ferrari cars at reckless speeds and listens to loud heavy metal music, which leads to a confrontation with the police after it commits a bank robbery, killing five guards at the bank, and mowing down two civilians whilst trying to escape. The police officer in charge of the investigation, Sgt. Thomas Beck (Nouri), is baffled when the suspect will not fall after being wounded several times in a shoot-out. In the process the creature uses up its human host body (Chris Mulkey), leaving a corpse, and eventually moves on to its next victim with a record of poor health (William Boyett) while its host dies in the hospital after sustaining multiple fatal injuries during the shoot-out with the police. This creature commits a series of murders in Los Angeles while jumping from body to body (including a stripper (Christian), a dog, Beck's partners and closest friends Lt. John Masterson and Cliff Willis (Felder and O'Ross), and eventually a senator (John McCann), leaving the police department perplexed. In the process the creature transits from a small-time crook to a serial killing hitman up to a full-time political terrorist, scheming from petty thefts to a U.S. government takeover. Arriving on the scene is FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (MacLachlan), who is actually an alien policeman inhabiting the body of Robert Stone, Gallagher's friend (there was a real Agent Gallagher, albeit deceased; the alien has taken the name and identity of Gallagher but the body of Stone; Gallagher and Stone had been hunting when a forest fire killed the real Gallagher).
