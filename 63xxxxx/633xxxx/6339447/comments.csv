,HalOfBorg,2011-04-24T04:13Z,Nothing made by humans is ever perfect. This improves it a bit. At least in some ways.
,InTrek,2011-04-24T05:32Z,LOL @ Mike. Anyone who thinks Nemesis was perfection is a retard. Get real!
,InTrek,2011-04-24T08:12Z,"Is this the old version without the text in the beginning?

Hey, if Nemesis didn't work well, then how can it be under-appreciated? Nemesis didn't work. That's the entire point of fans trying to edit it.

I agree with the UL'er. There are specific areas in Nemesis that are fixed or improved to some degree in this version. In fact, quite a few now that I think of it. How is Worf's re-reaction not an improvement? How is downplaying the Argo not an improvement? How is B-4 whistling not an improvement?

I wouldn't put much stock into the people who rushed to post sweeping negative comments only one day after the torrent was posted. FYI, this movie is 90 minutes. No reasonable person would call it a ""short.""

Thumbs up to the UL'er, and thumbs down to people with an obvious chip on their shoulder."

Rape: Star Trek ?????

""Star Trek does not need gratuitous sexuality woven into its stories for support"" but ""I reworked the deleted footage to produce an entirely new rape scene. I hope you like it"". SERIOUSLY!!!!!!"
,filthygate,2011-04-24T18:25Z,"Obviously from the title this is not a new release. This torrent is for the very first xvid version. There is an updated AVI on the author's website that is smaller and includes the trailer. This is a very good fanedit with some amazing technical changes. The new opening titles I thought were very cool. If you like this fanedit you should consider downloading the 720p version.

Regarding the previous comment by drama01, you really should download and watch stuff before posting nonsense. The original rape scene in Nemesis is more violent and graphic. It also runs longer. I know what you were up to, though. You were assuming that Nemesis didn't have a rape scene, and that this fanedit added one, which would make a good excuse to rip on it. Oops!

I'm sorry to be the one to expose you, but the rape scene in Antithesis is shorter, less graphic, and less violent. In other words, there is less sex and less rape. :-)"
