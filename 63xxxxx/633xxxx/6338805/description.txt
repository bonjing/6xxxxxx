More speed and increased security!
 Over 13 years of experience in system maintenance and optimization of operating systems by MicrosoftÂ® stand for modern technology, efficiency, security as well as intuitive user guidance.
 
Over 100 improvements were incorporated into the new Ashampoo WinOptimizer 8 by contrast to its predecessor Ashampoo WinOptimizer 7. This results in more speed and therefore improved efficiency especially within system maintenance and the adjustment of WindowsÂ®. The cleaning modules registry optimizer, Internet cleaner and drive cleaner , for example, reach a plus of up to 500% in results.
 
In real time the new live tuner pools all available resources in exactly those places where they are urgently needed. Existing processor cores, WindowsÂ® priorities and assigned usages of applications are customized, in order to ensure a trouble-free workflow. The resource-saving live tuner runs in the background â€“ just a mouse click away.
 
Itâ€™s so easy to tune WindowsÂ®! Just answer a few special questions about your personal requirements concerning your WindowsÂ® system and our tuning assistant will automatically choose all suitable options.
 
The concept of the all-in-one user interface has been developed further for the Ashampoo WinOptimizer 8. Via the clearly structured main window you can immediately access all six function groups, in which over 20 modules with hundreds of options and functions are assembled.
