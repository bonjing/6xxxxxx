Pray that Allah (rsvp) will forgive you for this transgression, do not fail him again! "
,manosteell,2011-06-30T13:19Z,"Opposite of brainwashing (which clearly the media has done a great job of, on you already) Islam challenges one to use his God-given REASON to prove to himself with evidence (not blind faith as in other religions) or because he was born into, that Islam is the true prescription of God to the way of life. In the original Quran from over 1400 yrs ago, which is the only book to never have been changed or tainted = humans are formed from the fusion of semen and sperm, then forming a clot of blood, then muscle on top of bone = 1400+ yrs ago. The mountains are like pegs which keep the earth from shaking = 1400+. The universe is in the perfect mathematical arrangement, all the dimensions, cosmic energy, atomic proportions to sustain life on earth; any slight degree of variance and we would not exist (coincidence? evolution? Don't fool yourself) = 1400+. All these scientific miracles which were only discovered by human advancement and technology in the past 2 centuries, and a reason why most scientists who study the Quran revert back to Islam. Enlighten yourselves.  Use scholarly resources for research, not Fox news.  Read about the Illuminati and how Satan motivated Charles Darwin's THEORY of evolution and considers preachers of that theory among the highest rank of his misguided followers. You must have really come from apes, with your monkey point of view; because even the devil believes in God, so what does that make you???"
