You guys stand first in requesting movies, But when it comes to seeding you guys stand last,

Now don't start a war here, its not a criticism, its just an observation, You guys are first in one more thing, thats flaming and creating a war kinda situation by writing abusive comments.

Not all Asians, but most of them just hit & run with out seeding, that's not fair.

These guys deffjam555, StyLishSaLH and many others works hard for you guys and they gets nothing in return,

Seeding is the only thing you are asked to do in return of what you take, if you don't seed, then you don't deserve to get your request done.


I don't want any arguments here,
you should face the truth.

thanks to deffjam555 and StyLishSaLH for all their hard work :-}"
