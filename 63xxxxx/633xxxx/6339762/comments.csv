This is the best i could do, not exact but you'll get the idea.

In the Boer war between 1899 and 1902 New Zealanders fought for the first time on foreign land.

More than 6000 announced themselves voluntarily to side with the British and fight against South African Boers - farmer

After the end of the war some of the vanquished Boers joined their families who had lost their farms, the returning soldiers
Are apprehensive and decide to go in search for a new home in the far away areas of the British Empire.

On a side note for those who do not know about the war. The Boers were greatly outnumbered but could not be defeated due to their tenacity and guerilla style war. The only way the British finally defeated them was to take the fighters familyâ€™s and put them in the first concentration camps where one in three woman and children died."
