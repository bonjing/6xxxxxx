,floyd502,2011-04-23T12:40Z,"Thanks EZTV,  Been a fan of yours for a few yrs now,  But what is going on with your site?    I only dl episodes of programs I really like due to the time lag between the states and uk.  Take Dexter for instance UK is One whole year behind   Is this fair, I think not   And this is my pledge I will stop downloading as soon as these programs reach us at the same time or just several hours behind.   I feel like a second rate citizen compared to the states and other countries who get all the good shows first.   After all I am paying for a service which is not giving me the same goods as it is to someone else (or several million people) so for now I can only Dl the shows I love and hope that I dont end up in jail for being a second rate citizen."

,PhilLesh12,2011-04-24T00:09Z,"@floyd502,

They probably picked up the first season in syndication over in the UK, a year after it originally aired.  So it will always be a year behind, now.

An Idiot Abroad only started airing here in the US in the last month or two.  They obviously aired it on Sky1, then syndicated it ""overseas"" after a period of time had passed."

,knoxius,2011-04-24T02:26Z,"to answer someone's question: eztv.it site is currently being ddosed, which some of you might know isn't very nice thing to defend against. anyway, that is the main reason website struggles (it was on the news). too bad, i use it even more often than tpb, but hey.. hopefully they will be up and running again soon. just like always =)"

,ManLemon,2011-05-30T23:39Z,"@ DjByzantine, it's being seeded properly right now (few weeks late but still) but my main thing was that I did indeed try the Tube+ site but apart from it being insanely slow (never had that on any other streaming site) my AntiVir logged the player wich needed some plugin, as containing a trojan and spyware. It might be nothing important or malignent but I thought I'd share it anyway."
