Why are we doing this?  This is why:

Because the Syrian people want freedom, democracy for all of Syria, freedom of expression, the release of political prisoners, for political parties to be allowed and a free media.
We want a stop to the killings in Damascus, Daraa, Lattakia, Douma, Tartous, Izra and Homs. Without that we are slaves.
