"A magnificent film, handled with reverence, artistic appreciation and
admirable restraint" (New York Daily News)
This glorious epic is an inspiring,grand-scale recreation of the life of Jesus
of Nazareth, from His humble birth and teachings to His crucifixion and
ultimate Resurrection. Lavishly produced at a cost of $20 millions, enormous
amount for the time and honored with five 1965 Academy Award nominations, this
exceptional motion picture is exquisitely beautiful. Now fully restored to its
original theatrical brilliance with intermission and overture, it is truly The
Greatest Story Ever Told.
