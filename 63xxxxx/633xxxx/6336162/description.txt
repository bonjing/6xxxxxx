You always thought that the Fair Folk were just a myth: Leprechauns aren't real, there's no gold at the end of the rainbow, and there's nothing inside those heather-covered hills but heaps of dirt. But when your brother vanishes into thin air on Samhain night, you start to have your doubts. All signs point to a magical realm contained deep within the hills themselves! Bring Razz a beer. Discover the hidden world of the Aos Sidhe. Hear the wail of the banshee, visit the Gremlin mechanic, find the end of the rainbow, and face Medb, the formidable Queen of the Sidhe. Adventure is waiting for you in the magical, mysterious world of Celtic Lore.
