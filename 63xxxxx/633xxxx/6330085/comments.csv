,Ticondrius,2011-04-19T21:53Z,"Seems to contain an ISO, about 7GB in size.  Somewhat hesitant about this one, as there was a fake Skidrow release earlier, but I'm downloading it anyway to find out."
,Cinaed666,2011-04-19T21:54Z,"Downloading it now, if it's legit I will seed a ton, I encourage people to do the same!

I've downloaded from SKIDROW efore, and it's the best out there!

Also, buy what you play!

,Fox_Almighty,2011-04-19T22:12Z,"Fucking noobs can't even tell a scene from a fake... This is legit guys, safe to download as I compared the size and description and the files to the actual scene torrent in a private tracker. The reason I'm downloading it here is just to save my ratio from going down, lol :P

Happy gaming guys."
,Wolfbanes,2011-04-19T22:20Z,Will multi-player work on the torrent or not?
,Vertiphon25,2011-04-19T22:32Z,"Whatever this is, it isn't the fake Skidrow release that's been around for over a week.  Downloading, we'll see..."

Thanks to the uploader"
,Penna_ha,2011-04-19T23:42Z,"The game is working fine, and it is indeed Portal 2.

But for some reason it says ""Postal 2"" in the installer? :/

,Geezernort,2011-04-19T23:50Z,"Seriously guys, seed. I'll keep this seeding for at least as long as it took me to download it, if not longer so you could at least put a lil' investment in more people being able to play it"
,IcyD,2011-04-20T00:10Z,"103 seeds and 3193 peers...I can't download above 15 KB/s... Seriously, people, this is a ridiculously stupid ratio. My connection sucks, I can only upload at like 25 KB/s, and even I'll be seeding as much as possible.

Seed, you greedy idiots, seed. You're not the only one who wants this game."

,maumau82,2011-04-20T01:17Z,legit and working
[M],Eliteghost,2011-04-20T02:12Z,"If you post another torrent with your shit spam, Ill ban you. Password changed until you talk to someone in irc and stop posting your shit spam"
,sp0tty,2011-04-20T03:42Z,"stop complaining, this was uploaded like 3 hours ago and the demand for it is obviously hugeâ if your DL speed is so slow it's because the ratio of leechers to people who have finished the torrent is probably 5:1, let alone people who continue to seed. That said, seed when you're done! "
,DubstepSanta,2011-04-20T03:59Z,"I've downloaded and installed it, it is 100% working, great and fast torrent for me. Thx!!! I've registered on this website just to thank you. THANKS!!!THANKS!!!THANKS!!!"
,Not-Really-Living,2011-04-20T04:51Z,"Why must people leech this specific torrent so much? Seriously, give as much as you're taking. The 0.1 KB/s download speed is really annoying."
,privatepartz,2011-04-20T05:32Z,"my download rate keeps fluctuating between about 200 kb/s and 20 kb/s, but I usually download stuff on this internet connection at between 1-2 mb/s any suggestions on what I can do to speed this up or why it is going so slow for me?"
,iDoodly,2011-04-20T05:39Z,"hey in the install instructions it says 
""4. Copy all files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation"" ..
When i extracted it, the only thing was the ISO so what folder is it refering to? thx, btw im seedin"
,iDoodly,2011-04-20T05:40Z,"during install it also says, unable to transfer source file pk_007-28 or something like that :S any ideas? thx"
,tomcatt33,2011-04-20T06:18Z,"When I try playing it says ""AppId not configured"" and at launch it says ""No Steam"". I copied the files to the installation directory, am I supposed to use the Skidrow config file somewhere?"
,Lolmen,2011-04-20T08:03Z,"Looks cool! Certainly will try this one. It's DL-ing @ 50KB/s, Im sure that will get better though."
,riahc3,2011-04-20T10:10Z,"The ""Postal 2"" title is kinda fishy....It'll problably get nuked for that as it isnt a proper release but go to hear that this is working...."
,mograine123,2011-04-20T16:35Z,"alright, i've got an error saying a butload of .dll files have gone corrupt/wrong, and i'm at a loss as to what to do. anyone got some advice? i will seed if someone can give me a solution (re-downloading it now aswell)"
,DJKARMA121,2011-04-20T17:07Z,"i need an activation key
can anyone please help?"
,VeNoM56k,2011-04-20T17:51Z,"works 100%, dont be alarmed by the ""postal 2"" name. This torrent is perfect. "
,tapper101,2011-04-20T18:38Z,"Wow, I'm actually downloading this with a pretty damn good speed. Good seeding guys, I'll seed it back. 
Downloading under an hour, 1,5mb/s. Not bad considering how few the seeders are compared to the leechers.

Now let's hope my laptop can run this, hehe. It runs Black Ops, DA2 and what not, so I'm sure it will run just fine! :)

Just like the other guys say, it's definitely legit."
,jaffacak,2011-04-20T20:33Z,how do you burn the image if it doesnt fit on a dvd?? please help. Its 6.6gb and a dvd is 4.7gb argh help 
,1edson,2011-04-20T20:39Z,"if you are having problems with the game closing to the desktop, make sure you have the fixed crack:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6331819/Portal_2_Crack_Fix-SKIDROW 

and that you have copied it's contents to the right folder. The most common error is copying ""client.dll"" and ""server.dll"" to ""GAME FOLDER/bin"" when te correct is ""GAME FOLDER/portal2/bin"". 
The other stuff goes directly in to the default GAME FOLDER.

That's what i was doing wrong. Hope it helps!


And thank you for the great upload!"
,bigk2410,2011-04-21T03:34Z,Having some trouble installing this. i unpacked everything and mounted it. when i try to install it tells me the source is corrupted. Any help guys? Thanks!

,xTr3morx,2011-04-22T14:24Z,"Hey, i get confused when i download files like this, do i have to unpack all folders or do i unpack and mount the first one only?"
,xTr3morx,2011-04-22T14:27Z,"Nevermind, for all people who have the same query, i have unpack the first folder, then mounted, then run and the installer is running fine at the moment. I will post any problems."
,xTr3morx,2011-04-22T15:38Z,"Iv heard good things about the first portal game, but never thought it would be this good.
The games is working ausome, the high graphics run well with preformance, better than most games, also if you are able to use an xbox 360 controllor then go ahead and do so, it works just like the 360 and it picks up that you are using the 360 controller.

Dont overload your graphics or you may get an error and the game will close, if you decide to mess with the graphic settings then save first.

Great game, fast download, thanks to the uploader, who ever you are."
,xTr3morx,2011-04-22T18:44Z,"UPDATE!
Been playing for a couple of hours now but im getting pissed off, every now and then the game crashes and closes, its tolerable as long as you save alot and you computer doesnt take forever to load the game."
,xTr3morx,2011-04-22T23:27Z,"Update!
Sorry if im commenting to much, just trying to keep you updated.

I think this is a steam version without steam which would be why there are problems with it crashing and closing, ill test it with steam tomorrow,

9 chapters complete, Game completed In 5 hours, Bad i guess."

,Per05,2011-04-23T21:34Z,"The game crashes after going through the valve intro, you know the dude with a valve in the back of his head. then it says ""PORTAL2.EXE"" stopped working.

Help?"
,xTr3morx,2011-04-23T22:11Z,"If you have windows 7 then you should get a debug option, debug it, then you should beable to play, but every so often the game with crash and close so make sure you save often.

The crack works but not completely, i crash and close left often but it still does it, i think its a steam issue, but i have not tested."

Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks."
