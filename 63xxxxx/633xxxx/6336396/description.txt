RELEASE NOTES

More speed and increased security

Over 13 years of experience in system maintenance and
optimization of operating systems by Microsoft stand for modern
technology, efficiency, security as well as intuitive user
guidance.

Over 100 improvements were incorporated into the new Ashampoo
WinOptimizer 8 by contrast to its predecessor Ashampoo
WinOptimizer 7. This results in more speed and therefore improved
efficiency especially within system maintenance and the
adjustment of Windows. The cleaning modules registry optimizer,
Internet cleaner and drive cleaner , for example, reach a plus of
up to 500% in results.

In real time the new live tuner pools all available resources in
exactly those places where they are urgently needed. Existing
processor cores, Windows priorities and assigned usages of
applications are customized, in order to ensure a trouble-free
workflow. The resource-saving live tuner runs in the background
just a mouse click away.

Its so easy to tune Windows Just answer a few special
questions about your personal requirements concerning your
Windows system and our tuning assistant will automatically
choose all suitable options.

The concept of the all-in-one user interface has been developed
further for the Ashampoo WinOptimizer 8. Via the clearly
structured main window you can immediately access all six
function groups, in which over 20 modules with hundreds of
options and functions are assembled.
