I met Zac at a studio about 6 years ago, possibly more ?

Anyways, this is a demo he handed me and I just recently found it again.

Zac Brown - Ruff CD (Possum)
MP3 320kbps Stereo

There's some cool live stuff and early versions of "Whatever it is" and "Chicken Fried" along with the "full" version of "Big fat Bitch"
