,Zenaku_Yamada,2011-04-20T05:35Z,"Seem to be the same one like one post before, downloading it now. but without a key i don't think we can do much with this i wonder if the creak just let you play without need of a code. I'll post again here if i got it up."

Btw it sometimes crashes to the desktop, but not too often. "

,divinitymagic,2011-04-20T23:34Z,"Doesnt work for me, i never have a problem with AiTB or SKIDROW torrents, but once i start the game, it resets back to my desktop and it tells me I need to change the Data Excecution Prevention, however when i try to do this it states that ""This program must run with DEP enabled"" 

Im really gutted :-( - I must add this is not the uploaders fault, its my stupid fault but i hope someone can help..."
,divinitymagic,2011-04-21T02:28Z,"...Its all good! As i said, it was my silly fault, re-installed and works great, superb game, how funny is Stephen Merchant lol!"

,zorenzo,2011-05-25T08:11Z,"This is 100% working.. i had game crashes about 6 times while playing the whole game but its ok because there is an autosave so i just continued everytime it crashes.. i didnt put the update and crackfix, i just used d crack included in this torrent.. nice game:))"
,juccool,2011-06-23T12:35Z,every time if i start the game whit any torrent i download for portal 2 there comes this game wonÂ´t work anymore someone know the problem?
,lionbums,2011-12-16T22:21Z,"This game is working. It isn't working for you because you aren't copying the cracked info or mounting the .iso correctly. This works perfectly, only because I know what I am doing. Installing it and playing it all at once won't work, it will just screw up the game."
,lionbums,2011-12-16T23:49Z,"If you are using PowerIso and you see the list of items in the .iso, then click setup.exe, you are doing it all wrong. If you don't mount, it won't work. If you don't mount, it will ask you for an activation code to install (ex1stenZ and much more). "
,dcgillette,2011-12-31T02:17Z,well ive been downloading it for 9 hours and its almost at 50%... i guess it will be done when i wake up tomorrow
