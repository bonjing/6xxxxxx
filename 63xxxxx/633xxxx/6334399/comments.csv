,ViGery,2011-04-21T23:36Z,"The crack (paul.dll) is infected with trojan!!! Please upload a Crack-Only, without a virus!!! Thanks!!!"
[V],extremezone,2011-04-22T00:15Z,"false positive ""virus"" , disable your av to play then"
,maidensebbe,2011-04-22T01:41Z,is there supposed to be a .exe crack in there? i can't find one.. and the game isn't working i get a windows error during startup anyone got the same problem?
[V],extremezone,2011-04-22T01:54Z,on iso mounted file check for skidrow ffolder
,71460,2011-04-22T02:57Z,Fantastic. Thanks a lot extreme. Others uploaders only release mainstream games that are not that good. I like how you bring different games.
,dekiai,2011-04-22T07:01Z,Doesn't seem to work : ) the game won't launch even though i followed the instructions perfectly.
,dekiai,2011-04-22T07:20Z,"Can't launch the game =) uploader seems to be deleting all the negative comments too. 

The skidrow folder has only 1 file, I think its missing an exe. crack."
,dekiai,2011-04-22T07:21Z,"Looks like it was just tpb screwing up again, don't mind the ""deleting comments"" part."
,nismohks,2011-04-22T08:39Z,i get the crack is virus also
,nismohks,2011-04-22T08:40Z,the crack comes up as virus for me also
,maidensebbe,2011-04-22T11:39Z,there's just a .dll file in the crack folder for me :(
,muupp,2011-04-22T11:55Z,"Despite what extremezone mentioned above ,it's false positive virus warning,just disable your av then run it again."
,cerezza,2011-04-22T18:28Z,"There's just one file on skidrow folder (paul.dll) I followed the instructions but the game won't launch. 
Solution, please"
,cerezza,2011-04-22T18:39Z,"I realized what's the problem, when I copy the file it deletes itself. What can I do? I'm on Windows 7"
,cerezza,2011-04-22T19:36Z,"Nevermind, I installed the game in my user folder, now works, thanks!
I hate Windows"
,aajduke36,2011-04-22T22:01Z,i am stuck at the oracle exam.. how to pass this. thanks
,aajduke36,2011-04-22T22:07Z,"just found out... simple: the pictures that are displayed above on wxam must be in correct order in the list that is suggested.. for example duck, if she is on the first place, and on first place for suggestion than that is the correct answer, if not find another"
,maidensebbe,2011-04-23T03:06Z,"it worked for me when i disabled my virus protection. but it never detected anything threat, the game just crashed when i tired to run it. "
,Golbs,2011-04-23T10:32Z,"Any help on how to get this to work?
I install it and stick the ""paul"" file into the game folder, but when I click on the exe, nothing happens. Hence the game doesn't load. Don't understand it."
,Gelbs,2011-04-23T10:41Z,Can't get it to work.
,Gelbs,2011-04-23T14:21Z,Never mind. I disabled AV and works.
,ClarkKent7176,2011-04-23T19:08Z,"Special thanks to extremezone for the upload.

This game works. There's no crack .exe 
just copy paul.dll to installation folder.
For me, windows was looking for xmllite.dll
I downloaded it from http://www.search-dll.com/dll-files/download/xmllite.dll.html. Pasted it in the system 32 folder"
,JocX,2011-04-23T22:01Z,Anyone know if the game comes with spanish version?
,ktroendle,2011-04-23T23:25Z,"If you like this game and these types of games, you should pay for it or they won't be around anymore. Unlike large movie studios these game studios have little money to work with and the adventure game genre is struggling to survive as it is."
,ktroendle,2011-04-23T23:27Z,If you like this game you should pay for it. These studios are small and the adventure game genre is struggling to survive as it is.
,cdur,2011-04-24T02:44Z,"cool game, great up 
come on people, use your heads!! if you dont know to dl free stuff stick to paying for it. For all who cant play your a/v or anti malware is deleting /blocking the crack. you WILL have this problem for all paul.dll cracks (esp AVG). turn off heuristics and add the game dir. and dvd rom to exceptions. see your a/v manual for this - prob have to restart after adding exceptions. rurning off the tray in AVG will NOT work you need the other steps also. once in exceptions, no more problems. repeat for ALL paul.dll files. "
,kiwi810,2011-04-24T15:46Z,THX
,themos013,2011-04-26T14:07Z,Thx A LOT ... ur torrents are amazing :D

,mazui,2011-04-27T17:12Z,"Thank you! :)
the game freezes at some point [when the guy (Dan) needs to drive the car after visiting Dr.fly and Poet, he says ""Where am I going?"" and then the game freezes].
I hope it will be fixed.

Please tell me if you managed to pass that part or complete the game, so I'll know if it's a problem with the crack or with my computer.

SORRY ABOUT MY ENGLISH!!

Have a nice day."

,Skums,2011-04-27T21:16Z,It doesn't work for me also. I have disabled the A/V and copied over the paul.dll and when i start the game nothing happens. In task manager the game starts but after one second it disappears. Any suggestions?
,saifmax,2011-04-30T03:12Z,please guys some help i can't copy the crack file?
,saifmax,2011-04-30T03:57Z,"never mind got it working just turned the anti-virus off, the game sucks but, anyway thanks up loader."

,Marti95.,2011-05-02T16:28Z,"Virus:

,toooerstad,2011-05-05T03:43Z,"Hey! Can enyone help me with the activation key, pleas ?"
,xaleeeeeel,2011-05-05T14:51Z,"we need new crack
this one has a VIRUS for sure"
,h1vem1nd,2011-05-06T19:58Z,"To everyone screaming ""Virus!"":
Kaspersky, Norton, and McAfee generally detect crack files & keygens as viruses, even when they aren't. It has to do with the way the cracks are coded.

Switch to Avast or AVG; they're better, they're free, and they rarely give false-positives."
,jarof_flies,2011-05-08T01:25Z,I don't know if you've already worked this out .. but I couldn't get the file with the keygen/ crack in this download to even open let only work .. I'd appreciate it if you'd get back to me with an solution to my problem. since I tried looking around for it n' couldn't find anything.
,123keller,2011-05-14T06:45Z,Extremezone can you please upload just a crack for this game because all i see is a paul.dll file and Windows 7 wont let me copy it to the game installation folder. 
,Derc,2011-05-15T05:33Z,"@hahamanin
The truth? Scene does not want us P2P users to get these releases. That's why so many fakes float around and we are as lucky to find these on the bay. PLEASE seed at least 1 to 1 ratio."
,PoshRocks,2011-05-24T01:11Z,wtf is this? i've never heard of it 0_o
,ukidono,2011-05-24T19:30Z,"extremezone, paul.dll is trying to access some files in system32 directory according to my kaspersky,
please upload a new/fresh/non-infected version of it. thank you"
,Freaky_Freddy,2011-06-10T20:40Z,"Very fun game, i highly recommend it for everyone that like point-and-click adventure games!"
,welchandginger,2011-06-12T09:07Z,"can anyone tell me how to cut and paste dll.i keep getting ""need permission of everyone"" msg

Cut and paste won't work from DVD!!! (either physical or mounted, since it's read-only).
Try copy-paste instead."

Cheers matey, that helped. I've pasted a screenshot I took of how I did it with microsoft security essentials in case it helps anyone else.

http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/5708/exclusion.jpg

In 'Excluded files and locations', I browsed for my mounted drive for the game (G:\) and then pressed the 'Add' button to add it to the bottom box. I then browsed for the game install location (C:\Games\THBT) and then pressed 'Add' again to add it to the bottom box. Saved it and the game loaded and worked perfectly. English subtitles, English audio, glorious high quality animation. "
,vexvexius,2012-04-15T01:14Z,Worked well for me. Thank you
