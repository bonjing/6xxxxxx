,acabada,2011-05-02T23:41Z,I have downloaded 3 times and reports error in the iso file...
,IchiTheHarvester,2011-05-11T15:49Z,"Move the folder to your desktop or something, then try mounting it again.

I don't know about anyone else but my buttons keep dissapearing on the game when hovering over them.

Thanks anywho!"
,ninjagnom,2011-05-25T22:59Z,"I encountered no problems whatsoever in installing the game, and it started up just fine.

But once I get the game going, everything moves in slow motion for some reason. The sound is perfectly fine, just the graphics are moving awfully slow. Tried the usual reinstalling and rebooting computer, didn't work. So I decided to just go with the one with the 2nd highest seed count in PB.

Thanks anyway."
,ninjagnom,2011-05-25T23:45Z,Nevermind. Had the same problem with the other torrent I tried. I guess this seemingly awesome game and my computer is just a bad match :(

,din88,2011-08-05T09:43Z,game work perfect!!! but... how to save a gameplay??? can sumone tell me how??? or what i should do???
,Cleric21,2011-12-27T13:53Z,"_nefe_ I'm still downloading but I'm going to say that that is a false positive. Cracks and keygens are usually falsely tagged as viruses because they share a lot of similar coding.
Looking at your scan result kinda confirms this:
HEUR: (Heuristic) It isn't a recognized virus, but your scanner thinks it looks close enough to one to be dangerous.
Generic: It's not recognized as a speific trojan (because it could very well not be one) so it can't give it a name.

I'll scan it and post my results."
,Cleric21,2011-12-27T23:41Z,"Scanned with Kapersky 2011 several times over, no viruses anywhere."
,gdansby,2012-01-09T02:35Z,"@Cleric21
Right click on the game and try ""Run as administrator"". Should probably save gameplay."
,gdansby,2012-01-09T02:37Z,"Woops, wrong user person. I meant @din88"
,pirateFor,2012-04-27T08:39Z,Mac Version PLEASE!...
