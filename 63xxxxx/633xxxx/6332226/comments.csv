,kalbloke,2011-08-20T23:49Z,"I attended an anniversary quiz held on the Elvis anniversary on 16th at the American Centre here in Calcutta, India. (Won a T, too, as a prize!) And wanted to know about a song I heard just the once, with/to Juliet Prowse.
The song never left my head, and twentyfive-odd years  later !!, I discovered that it was based on Offenbach's Bacarole from 'Tales of Hoffman' !!
Did a google just now and found it in this upload of yours, jereop!!! Thanks a lot, friend !
Of course, you probably know that it is 'Tonight is so right for love'. So i checked out your link here.
Man !! You are amazing !
You have 550 records/cds all of Elvis !!
Thanks to you, this bloke sitting in Calcutta, India gets to hear, after 45 years !! an Elvis song he could never forget and never got to hear either !! until tonight, that is !!
Thanks, again !!

Cheers!!!"
