,wetWeasel,2011-04-21T09:57Z,"Thread Jack! (because this is your most recent torrent)

Any chance of getting your hands on the Blur Crane videos for the new Nikon D7000? I'd love a copy of the beginners and Advanced videos.

(I'd buy the DVD, but I get double shafted in shipping, AND having to pay import tax on things like this.)

Thanks for any help you can offer, and double thanks for all the awesome torrents that you support."

,imareare,2011-04-21T15:40Z,"While going through the video, I kept thanking you again and again for such & many of your uploads.
I am seeding it and will touch 4 share ratio
In my book of accounts I have to pay a lot of fees to you, for getting so meticulously trained in adobe applications.
How I wish I could have shown you the progress and levels I am gradually reaching because of these tutorials.
My hearty deep regards to you Thethingy."
