Is Paolini planning on writing other series?"

,seattleorthodontist,2012-03-12T19:20Z,xoxoxo perfect upload! awesome! thank you very much!!! these books are so expensive on the kindle when they really shouldn't be. i own everything in hardcover & sometimes i feel like they should include an electronic copy when you buy a hardcover.
,dataswife,2012-04-08T09:56Z,Always happy to help! Took me AGES to find non-PDFS of these so of course I shared them :D There are plenty of the 4th book around (wasn't released when I created this) so I don't think I'll bother uploading it... :D
