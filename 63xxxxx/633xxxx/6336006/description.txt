Recipe for a Nation

by  request  

I dedicate this Manual to the human species , who suffered so much from its self and from the cruel joke called â€˜motherâ€™ nature . 

This is not a fantasy , it is as real as you can imagine our collective future , so if you want to make it happen in your life time do your duty and use your skills to spread the Recipe across the internet and the world . 

Being just a messenger I only wrote the Recipe but it existed since the eternity of the Universe , regardless of language or DNA , it is a natural desire making it omnipresent in the history of any intelligent specie , in any galaxy .
To put it in my choice of simple words , it is as universal as your motherâ€™s wish to see you live in a better world . 

The numbers in brackets refer to each chapter web index found at the end of the Manual where relevant internet links are listed to prove that , indeed , you are not day-dreaming , this is not a fantasy and that all it parts us from Eden is your participation . 

Please read the Recipe to the end to understand the beginning which is not what it seems but only justifying the purpose of the worldâ€™s shake-up and the start of the Nano Revolution . Take a trip with Daniel and enjoy the coming future , itâ€™s shocking !
