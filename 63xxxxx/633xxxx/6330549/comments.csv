,necrogen,2011-04-24T13:24Z,This seems less like a soundtrack and more like a collection of every sound effect in the game :/

nah, it doesnt, for example, where is the sounds of the portalgun? :P or explosions?"
,stickcult,2011-04-25T05:10Z,"It is only the music, the sound effects are in a different directory.  However, Portal 2's music is pretty dynamic, changing depending on what you do.  There are some longer ""background"" music tracks in here, probably the music you're looking for, and also the short samples that are added into the music dynamically, such as the aerial faith plate or speed gel bits."
,Koyangi,2011-04-25T06:57Z,While file is the Italian song?
,art00rz,2011-04-25T13:51Z,"where is ""Cara Mia"", the turret opera played at the end? is it any of the tracks? I found turret vs laser but that isn't it."
,Koyangi,2011-04-25T21:55Z,Actually... I guess it makes sense that it isn't listed since it probably wouldn't be a separate file from the movie. :/ Guess I'll just rip it.

,skollatus2,2011-06-17T12:46Z,"Looks like I'll have to play the game to listen to the dynamic music, hehe."
,niichan,2011-07-12T13:28Z,Why is there a song from Kingdom Hearts II in the sound track?
