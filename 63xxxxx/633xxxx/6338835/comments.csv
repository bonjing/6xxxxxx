There is one more torrent very similar to this only that it is of 8.42GB but people have left comments there. So which one should I download?"
,vividh,2011-06-30T03:48Z,Should I download this one or this one - http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6104096/The.Good.The.Bad.And.The.Ugly.1966.EXTENDED.720p.BluRay.x264-HQF    ?
,jshityeah,2011-07-31T23:00Z,Handbrake didn't recognise this version. I've stuck to the other file.
,enonumus,2012-02-08T11:05Z,"If Handbrake doesn't recognize a file (it's very rare but it happens), try re-muxing it using MKV Merge or Yamb.  That almost always does the trick and only takes a few minutes.  If that doesn't work, trying doing the same with but with just the video track.  One of the two will work 99% of the time if you were able to play the original file and it wasn't corrupt.  If the second option only works, after you encode it to a smaller file with Handbrake you can mux the new video file together with the audio track from the original source file using one of the aforementioned tools.
