Secret Wars v1 Repacked No Ads

The series was conceived by Marvel Comics' Editor-in-chief Jim Shooter:

    Kenner had licensed the DC Heroes. Mattel had He-Man, but wanted to hedge in case superheroes became the next big fad. They were interested in Marvel's characters, but only if we staged a publishing event that would get a lot of attention, and they could build a theme around. Fans, especially young fans often suggested to me 'one big story with all the heroes and all the villains in it', so I proposed that. It flew. Mattel thought that kids responded well to the word "secret", so after a couple of working names bit the dust, we called the story 'Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'.'

Crossover titles include The Amazing Spider-Man; Avengers; Captain America; Hulk; Iron Man; The Thing; Fantastic Four; Marvel Team-Up; Thor and Uncanny X-Men
