                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Conclusion. Sally realises she has misjudged Mark Dobson when he rescues her from
 an attack by Richard Bury. The pair dig deep into Sally's past to find a reason
 for the cycle of killing, and pick up the trail when an armed man called Reith
 confronts her with the heart-rending story of his daughter. Once a student with
 a promising future, Jasmine Reith declined into drug addiction and prostitution
 following a series of catastrophes, and was abused and exploited by several people
 she turned to for help. She finally died in a hospital A&E department where Sally
 was the nurse on duty. Thriller, starring Ashley Jensen and Max Beesley.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
