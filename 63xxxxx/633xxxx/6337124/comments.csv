Let me assure you that all of our ""CRACKED"" applications are well scanned by up-to-date internet security, to be precise Kaspersky Internet Security 2011. You're lack of trust implies that this torrent or application is either corrupt or not genuine thus not downloading it from a reliable source - ""theLEAK"". The team and I try have tested every application we encountered and upload to TPB, thus ensuring Quality Assurance [QA] and Quality Control. Does that answers your question?"

There's nothing wrong with the file. It's been scanned thoroughly using Kaspersky Internet Security 2011. Maybe perhaps you should try downloading the file again and turning off your internet security for the mean time after the installation is finished."

,Sivos,2011-05-05T00:29Z,"Good lord, a bunch of arguments over this little torrent?  Just let us, the consumers, test this torrent out and find the solution ourselves.  If this torrent doesn't make it permanent, then we'll move on.  It's not like this is a one time try (meaning that if it fails we're permanently fucked) we can just uninstall and reinstall it and try again if we need to.  Just calm down, chess000master, if you freak out about every single bad torrent on this site then you would end up driving yourself crazy trying to get them disbanded.  Plus, if everyone listened to every negative comment that is posted on every torrent, then no torrent will ever be downloaded.  I find that most people who post bad comments on these torrents either do something wrong, don't know what they are doing, or just want to be douchebags.  It's not like it matters.  We'll download the torrent if we choose to, if it doesn't work then we'll try another and so on and so forth until we find the right working one.  Mind you I will try yours next if this one doesn't work, but I won't tear them down because you claim it's a bad torrent or because they are not well known on Google (like that really matters......really?).  And sure I may be wasting my time, and I will rate them as I see fit, but the fact you keep coming back and replying on what everyone who posts on here shows that you have some grudge against this guy.  I mean seriously, it's like you're sitting there watching this page every second of everyday, grow up man and move on.  You said all you need to say, we get it, you don't like them and there's probably a virus.  Just, get a life, man.  This is not the most important thing in the world, stop treating it as such."
,Sivos,2011-05-05T00:41Z,"Works perfectly.  If it comes back in 180 days that there is a problem then I'll be sure to comment back to inform you, but it doesn't seem like it.  And the so called Trojan you guys found, it's not a virus.  This can't really be the first torrent you downloaded with a file that is claimed to be a virus is it? lol  If your protection is giving you grief about it, just go into your protection program and put it on the allow list.  What it is is that some files have a script on it that says it is a virus when in fact it is not.  It's a torrent, not like they are fully licensed by any security to be legally put on your computer.  Any kind of back-hack or security risk will be labeled as a virus.  Thank you for the upload, easy to follow and works perfectly.  I honestly think chess000master (or Joshua if you will) was only trying to promote his torrents, this isn't the first good torrent he downgraded and promoted his own."
[T],theLEAK,2011-05-05T19:00Z,"@chess000master

There's a thing called ""product trial"", where you first test a product and if statisfied will buy it. In this case; try downloading, installing and if it works more than 180 days then you should stop advertising your torrent on this page and spread the word that this torrent works.

Before you criticise someone's torrent, try it first then that way you get a primary data result, then just assuming and speculating that someone's torrent is not PERMANENT ACTIVATED."

[T],theLEAK,2011-05-06T18:29Z,"@sw0079 + @Reloot

The EZ-Activator is there. It's a file called ""Office 2010 Toolkit"", you need to double-click on it and from there you need to select on ""EZ-Activator"".

Hope that helps."
[T],theLEAK,2011-05-06T18:49Z,"@@sw0079 + @Reloot

In order for EZ-Activator to fully work, you must have install a trial version of Microsoft Office Professional 2010 (Keys are included in the description box), once installed, execute the application called ""Office 2010 Toolkit""."

Don't listen to chess000master

1) It's not his torrent, it's theLEAK
2) There are less seeders in his torrent, which means it's not that reliable compared to theLEAK



BTW, quality rating does not matter in case chess000master would bring it up. Funny how he has +1225 votes on the ""Office Professional Plus 2010 'The only Damn Legit one on here'"" yet only have roughly around 200 seeders."

1) Remove any previous version of Microsoft Office in your system using EZ-Activator 

Do not uninstall it through Control Panel


2) Install Microsoft Office given in the folder.

3) When asked for a serial key, enter one of the following :

YCDJ6-QCY43-CP4JF-7V3GJ-67PRR
368D8-3XC4F-4VB4Q-96CRD-PBYFW


4) If successful, which usually does, Run the file ""Office 2010 Toolkit.exe"" to get what looks like this image

http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/5978/office2010tk201.jpg

5) Now, click on EZ-Activator, and wait a while until it finishes the process of activation.

6) Enjoy!

For anyone getting the same error, you need to install .Net Framework 2.0. I tried 4.0 first but the toolkit didn't work until I installed 3.0 over it."

,craigbrian,2012-01-08T05:18Z,"Works like a char, just be sure you have Microsoft Office 2010 Trail installed.

It cant come pre installed on your computer. and if it does DO NOT HACK IT tell you install the trial

you can get a free Trial key from Googling ""try Office 2010""

If your getting errors update you .Net Framework files you may have to download it manually

 after you install it RESTART your computer."

Works perfectly. If it comes back in 180 days that there is a problem then I'll be sure to comment back to inform you, but it doesn't seem like it. And the so called Trojan you guys found, it's not a virus. This can't really be the first torrent you downloaded with a file that is claimed to be a virus is it? lol If your protection is giving you grief about it, just go into your protection program and put it on the allow list. What it is is that some files have a script on it that says it is a virus when in fact it is not. It's a torrent, not like they are fully licensed by any security to be legally put on your computer. Any kind of back-hack or security risk will be labeled as a virus. Thank you for the upload, easy to follow and works perfectly. I honestly think chess000master (or Joshua if you will) was only trying to promote his torrents, this isn't the first good torrent he downgraded and promoted his own.

Hi Sivos, Can you verify whether this still stays activated after the 180 day period? or can anybody else advise? Thanks."

This might sound easy but I was wondering if this torrent is updatable once it's installed.

The installation worked perfectly by following your instructions but Windows is constantly updating it.

Should I worry and just uninstall or this torrent can be updatable no problem?

Thank you for your help. "
,DracoUltima,2012-05-14T22:26Z,"Hey, here's some help for those that need it..... 
1. Move the entire folder to somewhere where you won't mess with it. Leaving it in your ''Downloads'' folder might cause you to delete it so stick it in a safe place.
2. Install the program (X16-32007.exe). UNCHECK THE BOX THAT ASKS TO ACTIVATE IT ONLINE.
3. Enter one of the trial codes. When done, DO    NOT RUN.
4. Run the ''Office 2010 Toolkit.exe'', no need to extract it or anything.
5. Click on the button that says: EZ-Activator (green font)
6. Wait a little.....
7. Done!"
