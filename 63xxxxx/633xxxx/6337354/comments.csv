,banukaknight,2011-04-30T12:07Z,Tarzon rip is seriously eff'ed up.. voice doesnt fit on with video.. so dont go for that rip...
[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-05T08:06Z,"@banukaknight
Damn sorry about that. Just download a regular version of Tarzan and use mkvtoolnix to separate the audio from the regular and separate the video from here and merge them together! Should only take a few minutes.

The audio should still be 2 channel from a regular download so it will still be the same size!"
,ClassicsOnly,2011-05-06T19:07Z,I also had synch problems with Snow White and Pinnochio.  Anyone else have the same problem?  I've checked most of the other movies and no audio issues.
,ClassicsOnly,2011-05-06T19:12Z,"I also had synch problems with Snow White, Fantasia and Pinnochio.  Anyone else have the same problem?  I've checked most of the other Disney movies in this set and had no serious audio issues."

I've checked most of the other Disney movies in this set and had no serious audio issues.  Great set of movies other than the few with the synch issues. thanks much"
[V],mkvGOD,2011-05-12T11:49Z,"Thank you letting me know about the sync problems guys. Sorry about that! If you would like this torrent to be re-uploaded to fix the problems, join the conversation on my FB and let me know your thoughts! "

,CDLX5342,2011-06-28T15:23Z,"hey guys, just finished DLding recently and was pretty dissapointed to find a few out of sync. (the uploader is not to blame though, as these things do happen!) however I have found a quick and easy solution. use VLC media player and its inbuilt function to work out how far off the sound is in milliseconds, then use MKVMerge (a free program) and load the files. when the video file is loaded just click on the audio file, go to the bottom and click on the ""format specific options"" tab enter how far out it was in MS under under the ""Delay (in ms)"" box, click ""Start Muxing"" and it will output a new file in a matter of seconds! just tried with Tarzan with an offset of -5200ms and it worked perfectly and took about 15 seconds! :D anyway, hope that helps someone else out too. other than that....

firstly thankyou uploader, very good compression for the size!

for this compression size
A: 8
V: 8

overall quality compared to DVD rip

A: 6-7
V: 8

thanks mkvGOD, and thanks for your other torrents too! always good work, and nice to see more mkv compressed video circulating and saving me some harddrive space! :P"
,CDLX5342,2011-06-29T16:36Z,"oops! last one was meant to be audio 8, video 6-7! (also keep in mind that I am watching these on a 58inch HDTV, so on a small screen or monitor they would probably still look better :)"
,molvica,2011-08-27T23:44Z,so I can't get this to download. It is stuck at 0%. any help is very welcomed
,Randemhero,2011-09-10T13:47Z,You Are God
,freedomdwarf,2011-09-22T19:19Z,"Sorry, even with MKV, a whole movie at only 300MB or less is a bit too low on quality for my liking.

Nice selection but I'm giving it a miss - need much better quality."
,Joshnane,2011-09-29T22:39Z,"Definitely a few that did not download correctly.  Little Mermaid is pretty off.  Picture is low quality, but I'm not mad atcha!  This is the first time I've seen a less than perfect upload from you.  And it was only a couple movies.  ;-)"
,HecticEnchilada,2011-11-06T07:47Z,Currently downloading... How am I meant to 'seed' this? I'm new to this! :)
,somik0,2012-03-17T12:49Z,"DID anyone else have a auido-video problem with ""Up""? Mine had a really bad delay in the sound I couldn't fix it. Had to download another copy."
,moonbeam52,2012-04-12T18:06Z,THANK YOU VERY MUCH UPLOADER!!!!! GREAT TORRENT!!!
