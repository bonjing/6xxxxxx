,TheRedKnight92,2011-05-09T17:03Z,"I agree with RazorRoseEddie on this one. It's great that you upload these videos for others to watch for free, and in good quality, but having other information than about the torrent itself in the info is unnecessary. Anyway.. I hope you will be able to upload the other 11 episodes and keep the torrents alive, as having each episode in a torrent for itself often create problems. Well.. Good luck."
