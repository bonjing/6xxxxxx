,JerombaCZ,2011-04-21T07:42Z,multiplayer games ain't work properly even with original version.....doubt this will be better
,Anen87,2011-04-21T12:39Z,"Um, no idea what you mean by ""properly"", but I'm using this and I'm able to play multi player LAN games with this. I don't know if there's some minor part in the gameplay or the ""Online"" multiplayer option with an avatar that you're referring to. The ""Online"" mode doesn't work with this version, only the LAN part. I haven't noticed anything not working thus far. I'm able to both host and join LAN games with this version. And I'm doing so over tunngle, so there's almost always someone to play with."
,Arcaian,2011-04-28T09:47Z,"Whenever I try to make a LAN game, it comes up with :

""Failed to host game""

I know the Chinese crack or whatever said this, so I made a fresh install and only used your crack that you supplied, but it still says that. Anyway to get around this message and host ? I'm using the 64-bit version of SmartSteam."
,Bummeri,2011-04-28T10:27Z,Same Prob as Arcaian. failed to host.
,Sl4y3r69,2011-05-07T13:03Z,This is bs... doesnt even work. FAIL
,eXoflow,2011-05-10T16:17Z,"This torrent is fake. Neither the ALI213 crack or the FLT crack works on LAN, both disables steam. So why would you be able to play LAN if you merge them? lol......"
,Vire70,2011-07-16T03:01Z,"Can confirm that this definitely doesn't work. I've tried multiple cracks/patchs, Tunngle, Hamachi, Old Hamachi, SmartSteam, and several of them in conjunction, none of it gets LAN to work. There may be some way to do it, but unfortunately the people who write these guides always provide incredibly lackluster instructions."
