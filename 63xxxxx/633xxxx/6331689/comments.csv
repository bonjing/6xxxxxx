LOL  This concert wasi actually in February '94, right after Kurt's birthday and just a couple months before he left us all behind. :("

,nymphmanic,2011-07-22T14:14Z,"Well, for a bootleg it's pretty decent audio/video quality.  Never wrote down the setlist, sorry.  It was originally on a VHS tape...  Used a VHS to DVD converter to make it into a downloadable file.  I've also put this concert on CD, using a DVD to MP3 converter.  It sounds great on CD.  I can upload that if anyone is interested in that.  :)  Then, of course, I would include a setlist.  :)"
