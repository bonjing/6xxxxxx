Joe Satriani's solo tour of Calcutta, India. 

The video features priceless clippings of Satch's support staff doing technical stuff, mic checks, etc. 

It also features him practicing before the show and signing autographs at the airport. 

Contains some clippings of the local shredmaster Amyt Dutta though.

Just download and watch and you will know it. The video's okay.

Satch just rocks folks!!
