,Up_Load,2011-05-22T11:18Z,Is this the UK release? 
,ChaosAthena,2011-06-26T03:49Z,"Great torrent. If you have kindle for pc, just paste these files straight into your ""My Kindle Content"" folder located your ""My Documents"" folder. You can then transfer them to your kindle with your usb cord or pay to transfer with whispersync.

@Up_Load, No, these are probably not the UK version. When you download the files, the first book is actually still called Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone."
