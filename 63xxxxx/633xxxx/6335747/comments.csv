,XxM24Ty,2011-04-22T12:34Z,"Indeed, as a life long term Rush fan I must say the quality of these songs are among the best I have ever heard from RUSH. I hope to burn a copy to a blank GOLD CD (real gold cds are about 2 bucks (USD) each online. Then put on my Ipod in Apple Lossless format. THANK YOU!!! I will purchase this whenever I can find a new job, as I am unemployed. "
