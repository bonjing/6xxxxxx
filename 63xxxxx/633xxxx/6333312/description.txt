Product Description: This text will strengthen a student's ability to apply the laws of physics to practical situations and problems that yield more easily to intuitive insight than to complex mathematics. These problems, chosen almost exclusively from classical (non-quantum) physics, are posed in accessible nontechnical language and require the student to select the right framework in which to analyze the situation. The book will be invaluable to undergraduates preparing for "general physics" papers. Some physics professors will even find the more difficult questions challenging. The mathematical prerequisites are minimal and do not go beyond elementary calculus. This intriguing book of physics problems will prove instructive, challenging and fun.
