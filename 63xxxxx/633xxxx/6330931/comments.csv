,ggbaird,2011-04-20T17:53Z,I agree with Akrnines. Extremzone use to always have single file releases. Must be giving in to the scene. 
,flextm71,2011-04-20T22:39Z,"Again with the destruction of a bdrip! I don't get it. Why bother if you're going to destroy the video quality with this low resolution crap. Bluray is suppose to be high definition, that's what I expect to get when I download a bdrip. You do realize that it's the year 2011, right?"
,mcmolly,2011-04-21T00:50Z,"why the fuck do u people dl it then? if this aint good enough then dont fucking dl it and just wait, its as simple as that u ungrateful ass sniffers. thanks extrem u allways come true.

[V],extremezone,2011-04-21T00:53Z,"@flextm71 you do realize this is a scene upload , not personal encode? take the 720p version from my profile if you don't like this one"
,harrisventura,2011-04-21T01:03Z,"flextm71 you're a fucking tool. And you're right, you really don't get it. Why bother uploading you ask. Maybe the number of seeders and leechers will give you a clue. Destruction of a BDRip? Yeah, BDs should only be used for 1080p 4GB+ rips right? Idiot. Cheers extremezone. "
,PurityDeath,2011-04-21T01:04Z,"@flextm71

On the one hand I think that it's the uploaders choice no matter what their reasoning is.

On the other hand I'm so tired of seeing say... 5 uploads of movies or shows and the smallest file size is running 10k seeds 5k leeches and the 720 version is only doing like 2k/1k. I often wonder why everyone always wants the crappy quality ones, are they really all running old CRT monitors or something?

At least the larger files usually have better peers so they can DL/UL just as fast if not faster than the smaller file sizes."

,lentheric,2011-04-21T06:00Z,"@PurityDeath

In certain countries we have download limits and even though we'd love to download the 720p version we'd just finish our limits too early and be limited.

People can combat this by looking into internet providers and getting the biggest download limits until eventually an isp gives in and goes unlimited to get more customers."

,TheFonzOfTorrentz,2011-04-21T15:57Z,extremezone why are torrents lately hard to find. Like not as many good copys or even  great quality uploads apart from yours.So many movies that have come out and if it was last year wouldve been uploaded so ?
[V],extremezone,2011-04-21T18:50Z,"@TheFonzOfTorrentz maybe provides hoesn't have money anymore to buy dvd's , or maybe some of them 2010 movies have the release date/dvd/bluray date in 2011/2012 , i think this is the reason"
,shiz55,2011-04-22T00:57Z,"dont download, the second part dosent work"
,azzwipe74,2011-04-24T02:33Z,"i played it on ps3 and the second part does,nt work....is it the same on disc if i convert and burn?"
,darkrose6,2011-04-24T07:43Z,"@flextm71

Shut up you stupid noob! It's a BlueRay Rip, doesn't mean that it is HD quality, it only means that was the source... The title doesn't say BDRip 1080i.... Not everyone is filled with joy when they can see Vince Vaughan's eye lashes. It's a comedy, it's not like it's Avatar where some HD could really be appreciated. 


If HD Quality is so important to you, then suck it up and buy the BlueRay, otherwise stop CRYING like a fucking virgin one her first time, or even better, buy the BlueRay and make rips yourself so other twats like you will also shut the fuck up and just say thank you."
,devilsadvocate80,2011-04-24T14:34Z,"Thanks to extremezone for original torrent...I converted the BDrip to be a 700MB(ish) file to share.

,crosswriter,2011-05-03T20:31Z,is it possible to watch this on VLC? or do we need a bluray player?
,crosswriter,2011-05-03T20:42Z,can vlc play this version?
,Justanotherstupiduser,2011-05-06T04:16Z,"to people wondering if VLC can play it, OFC it can.. i yet havn't downloaded a video file that VLC can't read.. :P and good luck finding one"
,ust2,2011-05-08T21:58Z," CD1 is fine, but CD2 is encoded differently or something.. and it will not play on PS3.

 Totally sucked since we were able to watch the first half, but then it couldn't read the second."
,AMarks2815,2011-05-15T06:43Z,Great quality! Thank You extremezone!
,mrsalmon,2011-05-15T23:27Z,ugh!  Kevin James full frontal!
,seanwestonmoving,2011-05-21T04:14Z,"As always, as long as it's an AVI Video from extremezone I don't EVER have to second guess the quality.  Typically anymore I simply look up the Video and even if they don't have the most Seeders I will still download from Extremezone.  Not to mention I hardly ever look at the comments as I can honestly say 85-90% of the downloads I get from extremezone have ATLEAST an 8 and 8 for Audio and Video.  The Movie on the other hand of course is outta extremezones hands.  So all I wanna say is KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK EXTREMEZONE!!!!!  Your Hard Work is Very Much Appreciated!!!!"

[T],zerothdegree,2011-07-03T20:46Z,"why are people still making these 2 file movies as if people are still burning this to CD's?!! 1.) don't burn them at all just buy a external drive. 2.) there are recordable DVD's and Blurays if you must burn them to something.
anyway, thanks I don't have high hopes for this film; cast looks horrible. But I've seen just about everything else so I'll give it a whirl."
