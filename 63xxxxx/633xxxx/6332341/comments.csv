For those of you that hate the new intro/theme this is your day.  All 3 hours some newb at Mercury cut the commercials right into the  real show.  I've done the best I could with it, but left a bit on the front so you all know what I'm talking about.

Hour 2 towards the end of the hour I caught some inside stuff playing during the commercial break's music.  I left that in just in case it's interesting.  This is the stuff that the inside extremists get all the time supposedly."
