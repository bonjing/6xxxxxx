Greg Giraldo's second albm Midlife Vices is another scathing commentary on American culture and values from one of the best comedians currently (NOT ANYMORE) doing stand-up. It's smart, angry and very funny -- a pretty lethal combination -- and continues the critique of contemporary American the comic began on his first album, Good Day to Cross a River. If you saw the special on Comedy Central but didn't love it, give it another chance. Midlife Vices is one of the best comedy albums of 2009.
