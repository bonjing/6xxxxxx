Dakar Rally 2011 Edition
2011 ROUTE: A CASCADE OF COLOUR
After two editions in South America, the Dakar continues its exploration in 2011 of a continent which has impressive potential for new discovery. Heading towards the north of Argentina and Chile, the route skims the frontiers of neighbouring countries and takes competitors through ever more varied country. It's a cascade of colour.

This is just a collection of the whole rally made up of files that were separately available. I wanted the whole rally and could not find it hosted all together.
