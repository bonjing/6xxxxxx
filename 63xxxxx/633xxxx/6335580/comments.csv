[V],manOtor,2011-04-26T19:26Z,"First of all: What you don't like, don't download ;)!

Second: It's no ad - at the beginning of each first episode I merely present 2 trailers of what else is there for whom ever is looking for more.
And the KABLAM!!! is the place to look.
Besides, I just have fun in editing trailers or making those KABLAM!!!-teasers and I share it along with what else I have to share :D .
No profit to gain, hence no ad, just information.
And personally, I skip ads, but always watch the trailers at the movies or when watching a DVD.

So I am sorry I couldn't match your expectations, but frankly, I don't care ;)!
Cheers"

[V],manOtor,2011-04-26T23:06Z,"HDTV in the title means that the original SOURCE is HDTV.
The original scene releases of an episode almost always come in two codecs:
1 - H.264/AAC and
2 - XviD/MP3
In case of the latter the original source is converted into 624x352 pixels XviD (video) / MP3 (audio) (the codec is also mentioned in the title) to reduce the file size considerably.
A typical scene release file name for an episode in this codec and format looks like this:

title.of.the.show.S01.E23.HDTV.XviD-LOL.avi
-------------season^--^episode--------^release group

The tag ""HDTV"" is used to indicate that the original HD proportions (1920x1080=16:9) were kept.
That's why I also use HDTV in the title."
[T],FaMoUz,2011-04-28T22:25Z,manotor is correct but it also means that it waz recorded off of an HD channel but losses sum of its quality wen converted 2 avi

Well played, well played.
oh and loved the teaser trailer things :P"

,theartpirate,2011-05-01T01:43Z,Thanks Dude! cant thank you enough.
,chandlerboy,2011-05-02T08:21Z,"Thanks for pointing all of that out manOtor.

Was going to download from here, but all that sounds pretty shitty. Will look elsewhere and suggest others do too."

,Toke420,2011-05-12T02:07Z,"gay trailers at the start of each episode that go for WAY too long... download from elsewhere if you can, these trailers suck and are annoying as hell. uploader is a tool and a douche for adding this shit to it"

So you're telling me the original resolution was 1080p and you compressed this down to this format?

If that's the case please post the 1080p versions on another post and link it here (but re-compress it first in mkv or so that we don't get insanely heavy files), cba to watch this at 624x352 on a 55' screen."
[V],manOtor,2011-05-19T07:22Z,"@Toke420:

The ""gay"" trailers are actually ONLY before the FIRST episode and promote two other shows and the section I promote my torernts in on suprbay and last for 2:45 minutes - I wouldn't say that is ""WAY too long"".
I really hope your parents will teach you some respect for the work of others and slap that name calling out of you before you turn 15, otherwise I don't see you getting a girl-/boyfriend anytime soon.

@S3nd41

No, that is not what I am telling you.
The files presented in this torrent are actually the files the scene releases as soon a show has aired.
Besides the first episode I did not mess with them at all!

There are different sections here on TPB for different purposes: If you are looking for higher quality, maybe you should look in Highres-TV shows. If you are lucky someone posted what you are looking for ;).
But I only do the XviD/MP3 files, as I don't have a big flat at home yet, so I have to politely turn you down on your slightly demanding request.

Cheers"
,nittany,2011-06-09T06:11Z,"For those that want to get rid of episode 1 and the gay ass trailers the uploader put before it plays go here:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6132752/Archer_2009_S02E01_Swiss_Miss_HDTV_XviD-FQM_%5Beztv%5D

I actually couldn't watch episode 1 on my Popcorn Hour A-110, it refused to play it correctly but the other episodes worked fine.  It must be due to however the uploader edited his ads on.  Gonna have to get episode 1 from the link above."
,dogfeet,2011-06-22T18:16Z,good job manOtor!! You schooled these mofos right!  Thanks for the time and effort to put this on here for all of us to watch for free.  People dont seem to think how awesome it is to watch great shit for free.  Keep up the good work!
,dippyd27,2011-07-29T21:52Z,"wow, people are assholes. @manotor just want to say thanky-you so much for your upload. They say beggars can't be choosers. So this is to all you complaining fucks out there, what the hell have you contributed? for one im glad this guy has taken time out of his schedule to record, edit out the commercials and upload them so people can have this for free instead of spending 40 dollars on the dvd set. bitches"
,dippyd27,2011-07-29T21:56Z,"and for all you idiots complaining about resolution, download a converter and convert it yourself its not hard. Thing is it will turn 2.5 gb into about 8 gb which is not something i want taking of up space. who needs a hi def cartoon. Keep it up manotor, btw i dont think you should have to explain yourself to idiots, but props for doing so. :)"
,dmnrocha2,2011-08-08T18:14Z,Thanks manOtor don't let the haters get to ya =]

,wickywicky,2011-12-11T00:14Z,"The Kablam ads were very well done... a little different, but what the hell, right? Thanks for the U/L!"
,hshhshua8,2012-01-18T18:13Z,"Trailer is lame, and adding it changed the encoding on the file, so S02E01 doesn't match the rest of the season.

I find it ironigic that people thing manOtor deserves any credit for packaging up scene rips made by other people, then slapping his own trailer/name on them.   what a fucking tool!

Download elsewhere, don't seed this trash"
,magicks,2012-01-24T04:25Z,"Everyone complaining about the ""ad"" at the beginning of the episodes needs to get out of their suburban bubble and stop complaining about the FREE show you are downloading.  If you don't like how it's ripped then fucking BUY it.  You have no right to complain about the work people go out of their way to do so the rest of us can enjoy it.  Quit being a selfish asshole, you make the world a bad place with your idiocy."

,Kaz_Torr,2012-06-08T03:17Z,"You people are being not only UNGRATEFUL, but RUDE! Stop !@#$ing commenting if your going to be a little !@#$. People like S3nd41 are ridiculous. @S3nd41 Ive encountered your posts on many different torrents and they have all been negative or demanding! Seriously dude, get some anger management or get laid or something. YOU HAVE 1 UPLOADED TORRENT, WHICH YOU COPIED OFF OF ANOTHER USER AND RE-TAGGED! you haven't provided anything to the community, yet you think you have the right to trash talk these hard working freedom fighters? Have some !@#$ing respect. @Everyone else trash-talking this torrent, back off. seriously. Your ripping on someone and making them feel bad for doing work FOR FREE FOR YOU... think about it. if you spent hours editing videos, uploading them, decided to be a bit creative with them just for fun, and then had people posting like this, would you not be just a little bit put off? and would that not increase the chance of you not releasing the next season and just keeping the files for yourself, instead of being an active community user and fighting for the freedom of information?

@manOtor, dont worry, and please dont take these comments to heart, these people are !@#$ed in the head. your doing great work! Please dont get discouraged, and please keep ripping vids!"
