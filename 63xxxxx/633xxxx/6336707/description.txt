Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

PLEASE READ:

Starting next Tuesday I will be out of the country and will likely NOT be able to edit/upload the show.  Once I get there I will try it out and let you know.  Even if it's possible, the upload may be later than usual.
