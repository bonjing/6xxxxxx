,est1987,2011-05-23T21:37Z,There's no audio?
,Yberman33,2011-06-25T22:12Z,I have no problem with the audio on this one but i cant get the subtitles to get any where close to being accurate even with vlc sync programs. Have dowloaded subs made for outher uploads that fits better but still anoying. closest one I got was about 5 sec off.

We All Family, You are great,,  Thanks

for any file has more than on language, it is better to put the original language on MKV, and the next other one or two and could be three language put it separately,  MKVmerge are able to merge any audio language in less than a minute, 

Downloading files with many audio inside, take maybe 100 or 1000% in some case than using MKV merge


Thanks again"
