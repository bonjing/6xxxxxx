Powerful All-in-One
Black and White Workflow

 

Whether you are a professional or a hobbyist yearning for those days in the darkroom,

Silver Efex Pro 2 gives you all the power and control you need to create high

quality black and white images.


In the past, black and white tools often meant compromising on the quality of the

conversion or required a complex and lengthy multi-step process that didn't ensure

predictable results. We set out to create a single workflow solution that provides

everything you need for the highest quality results.

 
Great beginnings


Start with dozens of visual presets as starting points. If you like what you see,

you're done. If you want to go further, use an extensive set of global controls such as

brightness, contrast, saturation, structure, film types, toning, and much more to craft your image.

 
Selective editing and finishing touches


For the ultimate in selective enhancements, look no further than the revolutionary U Point technology for incredibly precise selections and adjustments. You can even use the Zone Map built into the software to help guide your edits. Finally, add a vignette, burn in the edges, or add a natural image border to finish your black and white masterpiece. Experimenting is fast and fun, especially with the ability to compare different editing states with the brand new History Browser.

 
Looking to the future


You'll discover that although black and white photography is nearly 200 years old, Silver Efex Pro 2 gives you the very best of that legacy in one easy-to-use tool, plus new capabilities that make it possible to do more than ever before. What will you do with it?
