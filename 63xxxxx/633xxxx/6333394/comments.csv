,myskoxe,2011-04-26T17:33Z,How do I install this on my Mac
,bluelarry,2011-05-17T01:09Z,how do you install this app the key gen asks for an installation id what is the installation id
,Hippiehomer,2011-05-29T18:31Z,"This is built for ""Windows"" you can't install it on a ""Mac"", you have the use the Mac version: 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6368725/NIK_SOFTWARE_PACK__Mac_Osx__Medicine_-_A.D_Cool_-_DeGun

***You have to click ""Activation by Phone"" to get the ""Installation ID"" and then copy that into the keygen and generate to get the codes.  "
,Trousers,2011-07-08T07:02Z,"AVG didn't like this at all...

Dont download!"
,piratebay,2011-08-05T04:20Z,"Virustotal report for keygen (xf-efexp2.exe):

5/43 detected it as a virus.

http://www.virustotal.com/file-scan/report.html?id=ce7c8cfdd31c71c9dc0d51fe6d4167a42ffb8b96981cdaf9f284deb29ca064b4-1312481174

Not sure if it's just a false positive, or if it is really a virus.

Couldn't scan the SilverEfexPro2-pl-ver2.000all.exe file because of file limit imposed by VirusTotal.

My advice would be to download the exe file from the NikSoftware site and use the keygen to activate it. It would also be a good idea to run the keygen inside a sandbox.

Google if you don't know what a sandbox is."
,daegen999,2011-09-02T01:42Z,My virus checker picked up potentially malicious software when opening this torrent + this torrent does not come with sufficient instructions. I could not get it to work like many others.
,daegen999,2011-09-02T02:46Z,Got it to work. Do what PirateBay said. The virus checker did pick up a virus but it blocked it. Silver is working fine for me. I love this program sooo MUCH!
,daegen999,2011-09-02T02:49Z,Silver Efex does run slow though. Its even more clunky than lightroom but its worth the time and patients to create amazing images.
,TorrentSpotter,2011-10-05T06:40Z,Most of this FREE virus scanners are programed to report files named KEYGEN as viruses...If you rename it you'll see virus scan wont recognize it anymore as virus...
,TorrentSpotter,2011-10-05T07:30Z,"It works perfectly...Install it first then open your Photoshop...Under FILTER, on the top menu, look down and click on NICK SOFTWARE...Then it will open some kind a registration window where you have to click on REGISTER BY PHONE...You will then get ID number which you have to copy and paste in to the field of already opened key generator...Once it give you serial just copy to the registration window and you are all done..."
,Akrnines,2011-12-04T10:02Z,"If this is the one from Demonid, and I'm betting it is, it does in fact have some 32bit TSD variant in it."
,prettything378,2011-12-26T14:02Z,"flags it as a virus through Security Essentials but no worries. Just follow the install instructions included with the download and then disinfect afterwards. No harm done and program works perfectly!
thanks Rico200!"
,massoud321,2012-01-25T20:55Z,It will change your host file in windows/system32/drivers/etc. -- it will add bunch of sites and also hide the file. it does not have per say a virus but it will take over your computer. Do not download it unless you know how fix your host file
,iamkdn,2012-03-13T20:44Z,"host file has disappeared, is this goign to cause problems for my pirated version of PS? "
,LJUSALF,2012-05-31T13:10Z,"The program had to open seperately and not in photoshop

Only one problem; how do you open a picture in it?? There is no meny for that."
