Hop 2011 N2KMaster Reworkz Version (No Flicker)

Created off: TS Release (Everyones swiping it as their own and its crappy actually)
Fixes Done:

Flashing/Flickering Problem totally removed. Involved using 2 passes with 3 deflicker filters, 1 pass with a motion blur to get rid of that head throbbing flashing problem.

Improved Coloring, tried to sharpen and smooth a bit, original version was very pixelated and needed to compensate for the motion blur. Picture isnt the crispest due to the use of all the filters and motion blur, it was hard to get rid of the extra trailing left behind with out the original horrible picture pushing thru on the bad flickering scenes of the movie.

1st pass with the deflickering plugins i notice quite a bit of the flickering was gone, about 80% of flickering was removed, so i used the same three deflickers the next time thru and and did what i could to solve the motion blurring problem i had created to remove the flickering. Its slightly blurry, if someone else wanna try to refix this one using my version to fix the audio and video a bit more have at 'er. I've already spent over 8 hours to get rid of the flickering.
