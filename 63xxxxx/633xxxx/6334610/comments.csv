audio 4"
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-22T02:35Z,"yeah i had to wash the TS release with filters quite hard, if you got a way to pass it thru again by all means giver, the flickers gone tho
Best i could do with whats there , it is blurry i warned you but no more flashing"
,Halo-101,2011-04-22T03:32Z,Skimming throught the audio seems the same but it looks a little better than IMAGINES and only minorilyb lurry .eg ..washed out kinda look in areas...colours look better ..hmm id sayy with sum sharpness and quality enchancing in virtualdub or vlc...A5.5 V7-8?
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-22T18:21Z,"It is the TS Release, that release has been duped about 100 times so far on here without anyone attempting to make it look better, audio isnt that great in my book, maybe a 5 max, specially when the soundtrack kicks in, lotta heavymetal guitar that sounded kinda muffled to me. Yeah the blurring was required to get rid of the nasty flicker from the TS release. Trying to see if i can get it clean without having to use motion blur, it was the only choice i had, 3 deflicker filters x2 and a motion blur pass just to get it to stop flickering so bad. I've watched it myself, my opinion, meh seen worse lol"
,Halo-101,2011-04-23T02:46Z,"yer..i tryed 2 watch it and i just hate motion blurring..i couldnt watch it so i just closed it and am waiting for a way to watch this in R5,DVDSCR or anything!..i would watch your version cause its greatly enchanced if there was a wayy to remove the motion blur but considering it was your only option gr8 work :)...is there any way to remove it ?"
,martincorleone66,2011-04-23T05:10Z,where do you get a deflicker program?
,Airush777,2011-04-23T13:03Z,"DON'T BOTHER,,,CRAP"
,xBSAACHRIS434x,2011-04-24T18:06Z,A4 V5 Thanks for the up and the hard work n2kmaster but Ill wait for better quality....
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-24T20:54Z,"@martincorleone66 look up Vdub and deflicker filters.
@Airush777 Eat my butthole you non submitter, come back when you actually DO something for the community.
@Halo-101 Im still looking into it, the deflicker doesnt seem to remove the flashing completely for some reason. I havent gaven up but over 2 days worth of work on this just to stop that flicker in the first place was quite a bit of work.
@xBSAACHRIS434x Thanks, its not the best, i warned everyone about the motion blur issue. Nice to see at least a thanks rather than a flame attack from someone who doesnt contribute a damn thing."
,dgjr1959,2011-04-26T06:09Z,I downloaded three of these movies. Will download it. Thought the movie was in 3d. Your work on it is commendable. And thanks for putting it all together and sharing. Won't here me complaining. Anyone who has put the effort as you have no one should complain. Thanks again. 
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-26T13:52Z,"Your welcome, yeah i dunno about the 3d tho, didnt hear that, but yeah so far this seems to be the only non flickering versions. Complainers are usually non submitters who leech and dont share themselves nor help seed a thing as well. Usually hit and runnners starving for attention so they sign up to mouth off at someone whos been around on here for a wall. I call these people MPAA marks (like in wrestling) cuz ""Its still real to them""..."
,jawznmyt,2011-04-27T03:12Z,thanx m8 best ive seen on here thanx for the commitment and i seed lol
,etherknot,2011-04-29T07:31Z,Great job. Thanks!!
,jperlick60,2011-05-01T15:55Z,is this for real of is it fake
[T],n2kmaster,2011-05-06T04:31Z,"yes its legit, ive been forced by my 9 year old son now like 15 freakin times to watch this version lol sometimes the work i do is appreciated in the places it matters, only reworkz this honestly so my kid had a better version to watch, he went thru that Rango BS of the same damn flicker, at least i have a semi fix for it now. Sucks tho i had to use motion blur, tried it numerous times over and over and over with the deflicker filters and couldnt get rid of it until i added motion blur and no other plugin would allow me to produce the same effect (downloaded like 100 some freaking plugins for Vdub and still got nothing even close to removing it) But at least i have a semi solution for all these kids movies cams that have that harsh flicker."
