Also, all the chapters are unlocked with this 'patch'.

For me, game ruined."
,IndoctriNation,2011-04-22T21:09Z,"@ sasomange: look on this site for several crashes/fixes to Portal 2 (some 29 issues =P): http://segmentnext.com/2011/04/19/portal-2-crashes-freezes-sound-stuttering-graphics-errors-performance-fixes/. Hope you'll solve it.

@ FX5: can't you back-up your savegames and put them back later?"
,xiIix,2011-04-23T01:59Z,It simply moves your savegame folder to a different folder. Drag and drop your savegame files to that folder=game not ruined. Sometimes a little lateral thinking is needed.
