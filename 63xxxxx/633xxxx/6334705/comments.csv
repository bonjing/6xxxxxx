,Philonetic,2011-06-03T15:11Z,"I know what Mozilla is.  Mozilla Organization is a nonprofit corporation spun off from the fast-fading remnants of Netscape, which was absorbed by AOL in 1999.  Firefox is a Gecko based browser.  Gecko is owned by the people who wrote it (or their employers). However, it's also licensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL. Anyone who wants to use the code can do so if they accept the terms of one of the licenses. That includes AOL, Microsoft or Bob down the road.  Firefox development and testing are mostly done by about a dozen Mozilla employees, plus a few dozen others at companies like IBM, Sun, and Red Hat.  Now, Firefox is Gecko which is Netscape, Netscape is/was owned by AOL, Time Warner owns AOL and also CNN, Time Warner is traded publicly on the NYSE.  Microsoft dumps millions into CNN, Fox, etc, the ""MS"" in ""MSNBC"" stands for Microsoft.  So it's safe to say when people develop for Firefox they're giving free development to Microsoft.  I can't complain though, Firefox is the shiznit."
