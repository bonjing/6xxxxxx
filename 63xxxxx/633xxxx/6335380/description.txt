"Paradigms of Human Memory"

As the study group gathers to assemble 
their 20th and final Anthropology diorama 
of the year, they begin reminiscing about 
their favorite times together - including 
a trip they made to a western ghost town, 
a last minute glee club performance, the 
clandestine trysts that Jeff (Joel 
McHale) and Britta (Gillian Jacobs) have 
pulled off and the cornucopia of costumes 
that Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) has managed 
to wear over the year. Meanwhile, Troy's 
(Donald Glover) pet monkey returns, only 
to disappear back into the school's 
ventilation system. On the case, Senor 
Chang (Ken Jeong) quickly dives in to 
retrieve the monkey - along with all the 
loot he has stolen.

Enjoy :)
