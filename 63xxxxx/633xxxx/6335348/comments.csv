,piratewhorer,2011-04-22T02:32Z,"Far from complete: missing the Past masters (for instance) but also other stuff. ""Something new"" and ""Beatles 65"" (and other albums here) are the Capitol releases of previously released EMI-albums etc. Where are Anthology vol 2 and 3? You can find much better torrents with the complete discography elsewhere. Do it."
