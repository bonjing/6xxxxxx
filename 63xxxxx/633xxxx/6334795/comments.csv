,MoldyKittenz,2011-04-23T03:17Z,I imported it into iTunes and it worked perfectly. But after a good 10 minutes it stopped working and it showed up as a corrupted file. Whats up with that? Respond ASAP
,Bellfry,2011-04-23T12:50Z,Is this real? Quality any good?

Not a bad copy, very watchable with a small bit of tweaking. The Audio is better then the video IMO, but the overall movie it a disappointment. They basically mashed the last 3 movies into 1 movie with a few new hot actresses.... thats about it. "

,Fallerup,2011-05-02T03:59Z,"lol brxbrx... nice pickup line ;) this is a new one, using sites like this. But hey, happy to help out, just ask what ever you want to know.

here are the basics however:

get a program that uses Torrent files (I use Vuze (google it if you like), but there are others). click the ""download this torrent (magnet link)"" button and double click the downloaded file and presto... it starts up.

hint: when searching for something, when you are done, press the SE putton to get the torrent with most seeders. Also, uploader names with skulls behind their names, be in green or pick, are trusted users, just like GreatMagician here.

there you go. If there is anything else, just ask. 

if it was a troll post, shame on me, but hey, whats 5 minutes of ones life when you have nothing better to do right? :)"

 Plzzzzzzzz Upload the movie posters of all the movies in one torrent.........."
,arielmercoledi,2011-06-14T01:02Z,"question: when we rate in terms of A & V on the 1-10 scale, do we factor in that it's a telesync, or come from a point of neutrality?

that is, if the best dvd-rip is a:10::v:10, is the best telesync a:7.5::v:7.5, or is the best telesync rather a:10::v:10 as well?

i care a lot about providing input for quality control, so i will thank anyone for their answers to my question.

cheers,
