,kv57,2011-04-27T09:36Z,Converting an Office document is not possible to me. I receive the message âAdditional files will need to be installed to create PDF from this file. Do you want to run the Acrobat Installer in repair mode?â. I have Win 7 32 & Office 2007 installed. Other features like scanning are ok.

computer. "

,tahreep,2011-05-26T14:10Z,"Thanks to XxFukenGruvenxX so much.
All your jobs are very nice.
However, I wonder how to install Adobe PDF driver.

This is the way I tried and failed in Windows 7:
1. Device and Printers > Add a printer > Add a local printer > Use an existing port > FILE: (Print to File) > Have Disk... > Browse... > \Adobe PDF Printer\Xtras\AdobePDF\AdobePDF.inf
2. Then here are 10 list of ""Adobe PDF Converter"". However, the names of the 10 items are the same. 
3. I chose each item and finish it. In each case, I couldn't use the print to print a txt file into PDF file. 

Is this wrong way? Please tell me how to install the driver. :D"

,persep,2012-03-10T13:48Z,"Don't bother installing the printer drivers for windows 7, 32 or 64, because you can't install them without the installer"
