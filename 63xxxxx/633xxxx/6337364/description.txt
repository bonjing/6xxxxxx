SYNOPSiS
--------
If you're like me and was unaware of the benefits of using Portable software, 
then i suggest reading about it. 

Notice how fast your computer is right after a clean install? That's because
it's not filled with trash from installed software. The more software you 
install, the slower, the more bogged down it becomes.

This is why i use Portable Software.

In the past, i neglected to see the benefits of Portable Software until i ran
into PortableFreewareDotCom. Then i started using strictly Portable, Stealth,
and mostly freeware and notice the performance benefits of my slow notebook!

Needless to say, i have been converted! I use nothing but Portable, Stealth, and
mostly freeware these days. I create a 2nd partition "D" where i put all of my
portable software. When i need to wipe my operating system, "D" drive is not
affected, and the portable software on "D" drive continue to work.

I highly recommend you read up on this.. you will notice the performance gains
right away! 

Cheers.. i hope this was insightful :)
