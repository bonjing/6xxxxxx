,BinkyDeath,2012-01-22T12:47Z,"rampage007 - Why are you only going to seed for a WEEK??? If it's a hard file to download cos there aren't enough seeders for you then you should seed for a lot more than just a week. You're basically saying you're a leecher and that seeding for only a week makes you feel better about being a leecher. It's a small file, so seed it please.
joaquimario - Don't be such a moron! It IS a high-res movie and this uploader usually does a good job. I bet you only read the title and not the description that gave the actual dimensions of the movie. ""720p x264"" in the title wasn't the pixel ratio. The 720p was to do with pixels (some uploaders just mean the file is over 720 pixels with this tag) but not the 264. I haven't downloaded the file yet cos there's not many seeders but that's probably the bitrate.
Width : 1 280 pixels
Height : 544 pixels
There's your dimensions. :) And it's high-res."
