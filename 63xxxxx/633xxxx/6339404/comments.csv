,soupcip,2011-04-23T22:39Z,"Thanks for the up.
About this episode though, it really really sucked imo.
Was looking forward to it but for me it was very disapointing.
I found it dull, cheapish and I am not even curious about part2.
Bummer."
,gfw4lyfe,2011-04-24T00:52Z,I'm uploading the SHIT outta this torrent 200+KB/s and I'll leave it active for 2 hours from now. 
,paul_mc_uk,2011-04-24T00:59Z,"have to disagree entirely with the previous comment. There were some lovely lines, the appearance by Badger from Serenity as ex FBI, and more teasers regards River's connection to the Doctor. Not the very best, but a good start to the series."
,soupcip,2011-04-24T01:14Z,"That's ok, I see your point. However, for me, I always liked the more happy, hilarious, outlandish, yes perhaps even the more simple doctor who. For me, this is 2 much complexity, too dramatic, just like trying too hard and not quite achieving. We'll see where it goes. But again, thats my opinion, others may like this. "
,dreamer98,2011-04-24T06:35Z,maybe you're all too stupid to understand tv shows.
,soupcip,2011-04-24T15:28Z,"dreamer , you have to resort to these kind of comments ? Says alot about you. Its not a matter of being able to understand , if you really believe that , then well, thats really stupid.
If I want to see intricate, intellectual tv shows, then I will watch those, I just don't like it in the doctor who format which for me always was nice and good fun , and it seems the format is changing a little, and I personally could have done without that. But you go on and call people stupid, you'll do great in life."
