,hotwwwired,2011-04-24T10:04Z,"A LOT OF TORRENTS FROM EZTV AND TVTEAM AREN'T STARTING TO DOWNLOAD. I THINK THE MOST RECENT LATE APRIL DOWNTIME HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH A FIX THEY MUST BE WORKING ON.

I SURE HOPE THIS LATEST SPATE OF TORRENTS NOT STARTING TO DOWNLOAD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRACKERS RUNNING RATIOS AND SUCH. TVTEAM RECENTLY STARTED POSTING ALL KINDS OF TORRENTS THROUGH ""TORRENTDAY"" WHICH DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO START. 

HERE'S HOPING THEY CATCH UP WITH THIS PROBLEM SOON AS IT REALLY HURTS THE SCENE HERE ON TPB.

TPB HAS ALWAYS BEEN ALMOST FLAWLESS... THE PROBLEM OF TORRENTS NOT STARTING LATELY IS NO FUN FOR SURE AND IT'S A SURE BET THEY ARE ON TOP OF IT AND TRYING TO FIX IT FOR US POOR SCHMUCKS OUT HERE WHO ONLY GET OUR CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT THIS WAY."

,eslachance,2011-05-01T04:37Z,"Huh. Interesting, this torrent is by eztv for a show that's on eztv, but it doesn't actually appear on eztv! It skips E18 and goes straight from E17 to E19. Very odd :|"
