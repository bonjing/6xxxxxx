This file is a compilation of resources to aid students in Australia for the preparation of their HSC (Higher School Certificate) exams (who do the Mathematics 2 Unit course). The resources include past exam papers, worked solutions, formula sheets, revision notes, teaching guidelines, syllabus dot points and much more! (Probably...)

Please note I did not create/write the material inside this torrent and I merely compiled it slightly and uploaded it for general access. Each respective school, educator, student etc. have full credit for whatever section they created.

Furthermore if the resources included have aided you throughout your HSC study/revision please continue to seed this torrent and pass this torrent along to others who may require it. Also feel free to drop a comment expressing any concerns which I will deal with as swift as possible. (Also note that the more recent HSC papers can be downloaded off the Board of Studies Website.)

If enough people request it, I will also attempt to upload a resource package for the 3 Unit HSC course.
