,dekiai,2011-05-10T19:50Z,Cannot unpack with 7zip =) Just getting an error saying that the file is damaged.
,saliko,2011-05-11T07:26Z,Really stupid way of packaging i think... but try to unrar unl.ttbs and klick the thingy that shows up :)
,Hazid,2011-05-11T19:00Z,"Just like Bigfourie said, you highlight all the files it downloads(that are extractable) and extract them to your current location.  I used WinRar and did just that, then ran the .exe.  Then clicked on game and every thing worked.

I did stumble around with it, had to re-download once due to not figuring out the extracting right.  But it can be done and does work on Win 7 at least.

p.s. I have seen other games like this before and I agree with saliko ""Really stupid way of packaging i think""."
,7Mystery7,2011-05-12T10:26Z,"I extracted all the files.
Then i extracted ttbs.
Then i clicked the icon, but when i tried to click ""Extract"" it gave me an ""Errorr!!""
Whoever made this can't spell.
Still not working for me"

,tixan,2011-06-13T07:16Z,My computer just freeze hwne I try to unrar THE SECOND rar file.. one is not enough ...
,tixan,2011-06-13T07:19Z,"I think the unpacking works only with winrar, not 7zip.

So this uploader suck ass."
,didscub,2011-06-23T10:11Z,"Srsly >.<

If you can't Unrar - do a bit of google work - don't give an uploader BS that took time out of their life to give you something for FREE!

Just an FYI - the numbers at the end of each rar segment tell you where to start (tt01 or sometimes 00) usually you just open the first one in numerical order and BAM you have something for free. If your PC stops responding just leave it, mine does it sometimes and its just because whichever program you are using to extract is eating up ALOT of memory. But I would always suggest Google, its there for info - use it.. Thanks MAFIAA. FTW"
,didscub,2011-06-23T10:13Z,"Oh - And I use something called RarFrog - its free, easy to use and works with nearly all Rar files, I've never had a problem with it. "
,gmjh,2011-06-25T11:37Z,I know how to unrar. And it extracted to get the .exe file which says 'this is not a valid Win32 application'
,jimbolimbo,2011-08-31T03:28Z,This packaging is crazy.. I cannot find the Exe. File -.-
,Sirius22,2011-12-25T08:45Z,LMAO at all the people who want to download torrents but can't figure out a archives.
