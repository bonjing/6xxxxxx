,Nero_BlackFire,2011-04-22T05:54Z,"hello Insp. thanks for ASOT everyweek!

I'm dropping by to suggest you edit the album artist on all tracks to Armin Van Buuren

I mean, how do ppl short these tracks on there libraries afterall?

best wishes,

Nero (always dl, rarely posting)"
,moronmoro,2011-04-22T12:40Z,"No, this is the right way to tag the songs. Tho, dunno if inspiron checks it but as I import these songs to itunes I have to make all of them part of compilation, so itunes can sort them right"
,Nero_BlackFire,2011-04-25T01:34Z,"AFAIK, the fields artist and album artist are the same on all songs.

If that's the correct way to tag it, then perfect.

I, nero, dunno how to sort them except by editing album artist to Armin, and setting winamp to sort by album artist.

maybe it's a winamp specific limitation."
