,goku_dbz,2011-08-27T20:31Z,"thanx pumpsoul.i am in great need of this game.will you keep it seeding for a while,a few weeks maybe so that i am able to download it."
,zaigrani,2011-09-05T13:13Z,"Finally we did it!

Thank you pumpsoul, but I have to say something.

We were here for days and you come several times per day giving us a few bytes, and then went. 

I can understand that you have no technical possibilities to be a real seeder, but you had to think about that before you uploaded the 28 GB large game. 

There were 30-40 peers waiting for hte last  1.5% of the game. The problem is, also that noone of them is still here to help seeding for other people. I will stay seeding for a few days, but my connection is also not good enough for fast downloading.

Pumpsoul, please, do not upload torrents anymore if you don't have possibilities to support it with seeding.

Best regards"

Great Advice my friend! I`ll keep in mind the next time. You`re totally right, but let me tell you that at the time i begin to upload this torrent i thought i could do this seed putting my trust in a pc friend`s, but this guy always forgot to start seeding and then, in the middle, personal problems, etc. But this last weeks, with you messages, i realize the troubble and, again like you said, FINALLY! WE DID IT! ^^

Thanks 4 b patient my fellows and my apologizes for being a noob seeder :P
Enjoy the freedom to share and play your favourites games :)"
