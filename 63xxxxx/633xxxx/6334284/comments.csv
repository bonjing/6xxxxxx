The 11111-11111-11111-1111X method only works now if you turn internet off before inputting this serial. If not the browse option doesn't appear. This changed happened going from 2010 to 2011."

Did you read the instruction, disconnect from the internet is written first.
But thanks for the comment and welcome...:)"

1]Delete existing key first.
2]now open command prompt.
3]Go to the folder where kaspersky is installed.
Example for me it was ""c:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011""
4]now run this command 
avp.com addkey ""path to key file""
Example for me it looked like this
""c:\Program Files (x86)\Kaspersky Lab\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011>avp.com addkey ""E:\antivirus\3D Stuff\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011 key files [21-Apr-2011]\KIS Key [Eagerforcc] (1).key""
5]now that should install the key.Check the license.

Note : If you get a error message the key is blacklisted."
