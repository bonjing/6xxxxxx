,wetmouse,2011-04-24T07:09Z,"""Historians universally agree that Thucydides was the greatest historian who has ever lived.""

That is the most ignorant statement I have ever read! Historians don't universally agree on anything. Thucydides was an important early historian - perhaps the most important, but his non-academic approach would get him kicked out of any first year history degree program in the Western World. Even a plagiarist like Stephen Ambrose was a better historian!"
