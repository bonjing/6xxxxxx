,nehoc,2011-04-28T23:13Z,"Found the subs, sorry - they are of course in the mkv file, not in separated file, stupid me. Works finely, superb quality."
[V],GoodFilms,2011-04-29T02:21Z,"Yes, and it is already mentioned that the original French track is #3."

,Mocanu,2011-06-12T02:47Z,"Hands off this torrent because the sound is Algerian French in very bad quality, mostlikely ripped from AlgerTV and it was then converted to DTS. Also my antivirus found a virus in mkv!"
