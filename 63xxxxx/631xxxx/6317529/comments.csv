,nickywicky,2011-04-14T09:00Z,@aroyals same thing happened to me when i downloaded 'takers'.i waited for the dvdrip on this one though
,hootieman,2011-04-14T09:02Z,"Good copy but yes, its confirmed, the subs don't tell the italian speaking parts... just says (italian speak) so far the PPV Rip is the best right now with the hard coded subs"
,hootieman,2011-04-14T09:03Z,"FYI when you start seeing PPV Rips from trusted people, expect the DVD Screeners to come very shortly"
,kukki2,2011-04-14T12:02Z,"It's nearly 2 hour movie. Shrunk down to 700Mb doesnt make it much better than that ppv crap, even arrow is scene and I assume they know what theyre doing. Wait for 1.36Gb if your pc isnt capable with HD. There's absolutely no need to ruin your movie experience with poorquality rips like ppv/this.

TvTeam script fails with subtitles and mirrors just .idx file."

Just remember that we've been around for hundreds of thousands of years and our current religions are new by comparison. Ahhh if only christianty handt wiped out the old religions of this world.

I don't watch movies for  religious propaganda or any propaganda for that fact. I watch movies to enjoy them knowing they are movies. This was like most exorcism movie in that it dealt with the Catholic church. Not all are about the church but most are. I did enjoy the movie and hope others will also.

Go to google and learn to find some ""non-English"" subtitles people. so that you can get subtitles for the non English parts.

You'll download an ""SRT"" file. All you need to do then is make sure that the SRT file has the same file name as the movie file, then play the movie."
