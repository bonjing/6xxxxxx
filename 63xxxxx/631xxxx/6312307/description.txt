Hey there.

I am in NO WAY associated with wallbase.cc
This is a scrape of the top 1000+ wallpapers on wallbase.cc on April 11th, 2011.

This is to give a sample of some of the great stuff on wallbase.cc
On wallbase.cc you can filter by Resolution, Minimum Resolution, Screen Aspect Ratio, Color Palette, SFW/Sketchy/NSFW and other things.

In this collection:
Everything is flagged SFW, but I make no guarantees that the flags are correct. A few of the wallpapers may be deemed Sketchy by some.
There are no other filters applied (Resolution, Aspect Ration, etc.), it is just the top 57 or so pages (all I could get before my script got a 500 error, and I figured it was a nice enough sampler.)

If you wish to know more about the Python script I used to scrape these, email me at anon.dq@gmail.com
ENJOY!
