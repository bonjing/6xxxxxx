,captainkhaos1966,2011-04-13T06:25Z,Thanks WMI. Any ideal why there is no preview for Virginia next week? Famegirls site has previews for Ella's next set then Sandra's then Ella again
,raptor215,2011-04-13T06:38Z,"happy virginia day...god i love this girl

i noticed on the site that she doesnt have a set next week?"
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-04-13T06:58Z,The members section is showing the same thing. More than likely a glitch on the owners part. I've included the preview for next week in this torrent.
,ragnarok_falls,2011-04-13T11:31Z,@webmodelsindex U rock dude!!!
,KraLu360,2011-04-13T12:19Z,"sorry but if you are blind to this set was already
and set exactly 92"
,famegirlzrule,2011-04-13T12:35Z,"I can confirm for all the people who are asking here and on other sites that Virginia has now quit at famegirls and for the moment they will be  running 6 sets of Ella and 6 sets of Sandra per month untill her replacement is found. I have been informed that FG's are negotiating with a Czech model previously known as little Amber / Diana which would be a perfect fit as all 3 girls are now based in holland for the next year or so.
Apparently the reason behind Vanessa leaving is that FG's want to phase in topless sets followed by full nude shots by July this year. Ella and Sandra have agreed new terms but Vanessa has refused outright. You will notice from 20th April there will be many pussy shots without panties under pantyhose but there will be no nudity untill the July 4th set which will be a Sandra set ....personally i can't wait !"
,jizzlobber72000,2011-04-13T12:59Z,"Awesome news....especially that Amber/Diana is joining. She has a great ass.

Thanks for the uploads WMI"
,cult22,2011-04-13T15:02Z,"famegirlzrule i don't know if you try to fool us but for sure you fantasy my dream.
I hope your right.
thanks webmodelsindex for the up
if they get nude i guess you will continu your membership?"
,Duper167,2011-04-13T15:21Z,Virginia is leaving?  Bonus!  She's always been the ugly duckling of the group and never really seemed to be all that into it.
,zipperneck2,2011-04-13T20:14Z,"@famegirlrulez
I'll believe it when I see it."
,socksoff,2011-04-14T01:22Z,Kralu360 seems to be right-this set looks amazingly like set 92.  Wonder what is going on?  Maybe there is some truth to what famegirlzrule says.  
,cult22,2011-04-14T02:22Z,famegirlrulez where did you gte your information?
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-04-14T03:18Z,"Virginia is not leaving. It was a typo on the part of the owner of the FG site. He made a similar typo not too long ago by naming an Ella set as Sandras. Virginia will be there next week, and the preview for that set is in this torrent."
,MotleyC,2011-04-14T05:32Z,"Well at least we won't have to wait very long to find out if famegirlzrule is lying. :)

I suspect he is so I'm not buying it but we will see next week."
,webbie64,2011-04-14T07:31Z,famegirlz...who is Vanessa ?
[T],webmodelsindex,2011-04-14T16:56Z,"The FG site has been fixed, it shows Virginia for next week. She has not quit. It was just a typo."
,cult22,2011-04-14T17:58Z,famegirlzrule you fool
,captainkhaos1966,2011-04-17T04:54Z,"Went back and looked and this is set 92. Some of the pics are different pic # but same pics but there are 6 more pics in #92. Nothing WMI did wrong, Fame-girls site messed up on that one. But atleast if they was gonna use an older set they picked a good one. She is hot as hell in this one"
,MotleyC,2011-04-19T15:44Z,I bit odd that they would use an old set for a new update. So according to famegirlzrule starting tomorrow we should see a difference. Now since tomorrow is Virgina we know we won't notice anything. So if what he says is true then the first chance to see is Ella's update on Friday. Looking at the preview it appears there is a **slight** chance that it could be true. I still don't buy it.
