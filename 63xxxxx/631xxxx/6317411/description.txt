"Barbra Streisand" is a disco house song by American-Canadian DJ duo Duck Sauce. It was released on 10 September 2010. The song peaked at number one in Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria. It became a top ten hit in Australia, France, 
Germany, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and the UK.

"Barbra Streisand" is named after the singer of the same name, and samples "Gotta Go Home" (1979) by German disco group Boney M., which in turn borrows content from "Hallo Bimmelbahn" (1973) performed by German band Nighttrain, as written by brothers Heinz and JÃ¼rgen Huth. The single's album artwork is modelled directly after Streisand's own 1980 album, Guilty, which features a picture of her and Barry Gibb on the sleeve. For the "Barbra Streisand" cover, Streisand and Gibb's faces are digitally removed and replaced with duck beaks. The song was first played at the 2010 Miami Winter Music Conference.
