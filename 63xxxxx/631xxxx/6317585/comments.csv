,jedarico,2011-04-26T12:04Z,"i couldnt help but notice that everybody who downloads this game stopped at 5.9%, and i just figured out how to seed this myself, so enjoy the download."
,emmanfg,2011-04-27T08:53Z,is it really the final patched version which is 2.3 released by team HGG?
,jedarico,2011-04-28T15:52Z,Thats what it said in ffinsider when i downloaded it there

,distynova,2011-06-22T21:59Z,"it works with 6,39 pro B6"
,Zeiken,2011-06-23T08:28Z,"@distynova Jesus throw that garbage away man. That ancient ctf has been pwned already.

http://psp.dashhacks.com/2011/05/29/psp-custom-firmware-6-206-356-39-pro-b6-released/#more-19389

This this cfw is overkill compared to m33 in what it can do! It more than exceeds it!
It does a hellofa lot more stuff than m33 can do! And it does it waay better!(Plus it works with all games no problem and all the homebrew and plugins new and old.)
Seriously dude, UPDATE! That will solve all your problems and open a door to newer stuff for your psp thats still stuck in the past. Dark Alex is no longer needed. The new coder  neur0n has beaten him. He IS better than Dark Alex! Waay better! "
,distynova,2011-06-23T09:58Z,"i said it work on 6,39 pro b6 wich means ive got it already dudes. thx anyway. it sucks ass that character name must be in japanese but ya cant have everything"
,darkpetal,2011-06-29T16:33Z,it doesnt hafta be. push select a couple of times when writing your name.
,Liadryyn,2011-07-04T18:38Z,"Works on 5.00M33-6, with Pegasus."

,Arre55,2011-07-17T21:47Z,do i need to do something with my psp first?
,lunatik3904,2011-07-29T15:39Z,"For all the people out there using GEN-C 5.03, you will need Prometheus 4 in order to play Monster Hunter Portable 3rd.

,lunatik3904,2011-07-29T15:42Z,"Oups, sorry for the double post.

Anyway, the site I gave you is all French, but all the downloads there works number one.

So, like  I said, those with ChickHen and GEN-C 5.03 will need Prometheus 5.03 for HEN in order to play Monster Hunter portable 3rd."
,demo218,2011-07-30T07:03Z,"it works! thnx, it's great!"
,OSUDragon,2011-08-02T23:53Z,@hobosandwich: you either add it as is to your memory stick or convert it to .cso (compressed iso) then transfer it
,Nekroid,2011-08-03T00:54Z,"I like the game it's ALMOST fully functional.. I don't know if this is my PSP or the ISO but when the Qurupeco video plays in the Urgent Quest after reaching the area, the video freezes when the peco roars and my PSP shuts down.. does it everytime.. so I don't know if I recommend this torrent.. let me know if you guys have this problem too.."
