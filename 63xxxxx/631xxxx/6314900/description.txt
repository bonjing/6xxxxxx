The Raven was Universal Filmâ€™s third and final excursion of the 1930s 
into the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Like The Black Cat (1934), the link 
between Poeâ€™s work and the end film is minimal â€“ indeed as is a common 
device in most Poe films, the works of the writer are slotted in by 
making the main character a Poe fan.

As well as being thematically similar to the earlier Black Cat, The 
Raven shares most of its plot flaws. Lugosi and Karloff share top billing, 
and together account for most of the screen time and characterisation; but 
the Thatcher family, who are the â€˜good-guysâ€™, get almost no character at 
all, especially Jeanâ€™s fiancÃ©e who should be the hero of the piece; by the 
end we are rooting for Voller not Thatcher. The sudden arrival of a random 
mix of characters at the party Voller organises, come out of nowhere, with 
no mention of them previously, or of who invited them - they also add a little 
needed comic relief that damages the horrific atmosphere. The filmâ€™s pacing is 
slow, and although the climax is strong and tense the ending is far too sudden 
and very poor. On a positive note, the film does have a few good sequences 
hearing Lugosi recite part of the original Poe poem is a treat; while Bateman's 
awakening after the surgery, as he sees himself in the mirrors, looks straight 
out of a Frankenstein film and is acted well.

The film's direction is mediocre, Lew Landers is little more than a studio hack, 
and with the exception of one nice tracking shot along a corridor, does nothing 
to bring out the dramatic gothic sets and torture chamber. The set design is 
decent although does not compare to the magnificence of the early Universal 
horrors, or the hellish art-deco designs of The Black Cat. Karloff's hideous 
make-up, from the expert Jack Pierce, looks okay in long shot, but suffers under 
the frequent close-ups. The music is a standard Universal affair, with the usual 
hints of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.

Bela Lugosi is on usual form as the creepy doctor, his line readings are as good 
as ever and he even pulls off a manic laugh without looking clich'; despite the 
film, he is on good form here. Karloff gets a lesser role, and spends much of the 
film with half his face plastered over, but unlike his famous Frankenstein (1931) 
portrayal he gets little chance to display any range, only the sequence when he 
awakens after surgery allow him any chance to act. Samuel Hinds as Judge Thatcher 
is pretty unimpressive, and it is a pity that Edward Van Sloan was not used in a 
part that would have suited him. The remainder of the cast fade into the background, 
none given a big enough part.

Ultimately, The Raven suffers from the same fate as The Black Cat (1934) with 
Lugosi and Karloff given most of the storytime, and no build up of the supposed 
good-guys. While the earlier film at least looked pretty good, Lander's direction 
here does nothing to bring out the gothic potential in the house or settings, or 
build up much tension. Bela Lugosiâ€™s performance is the only thing that saves the 
film from being completely forgettable, even Karloff suffers in an underwritten role. 
Recommended only to Lugosi fans or Universal completists.
