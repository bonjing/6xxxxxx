Description : Very good film about Tantra and Kama Sutra. Reveals 7 secrets of the tantric practises.

Quotes      : "The search for ecstasy is as old as human history. Long ago in India, a mystical sect called the tantrics, began experimenting with lovemaking postures, yoga, breath control and meditation. Over the period of some 2000 years they evolve way to attain through sexual union a state of blissful oneness, that their texts merely hint at." "...when you have exhausted every means by which you can become bodily one, it is time to realize that the true union is the union of mind and spirit."
