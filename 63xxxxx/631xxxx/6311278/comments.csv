,pixelbin,2011-06-21T13:11Z,"thanks for the upload of Governor of Poker 2. i've installed this a few weeks ago. at first (yellow cities) it worked perfectly but when i reached orange cities, it seemed to stop working after a player changes/transfers to another table. would you please tell me what's wrong and remedy of the problem? is there anyone having the same problem?"
,ztormur,2011-07-05T18:15Z,"Here is the answer about the game locking up at the end:

The game lockup in El-Paso has been resolved in the later version (v1.8 is current. Issue was fixed in v1.6).
We also added a check to try and get the profile playing again for the players with a ""stuck""-save file, but apparently this doesn't fix the savefile for all the players.

At this point the best/fastest thing to do is to start a new profile.
The lockup is fixed and shouldn't appear when playing the new profile.

With kind regards,

..... bumber i know..... been searching for ever. i didnt try copying my save game and reinstalling and all that. also i think im playing on the v. 1.0. Atleast thats indicated in the name of my save game. Also a 2nd bug exisit where you are able to leave the table but lose your winnings. not sure if there is a way to get by that one."

No viruss here guys, believe me ^^"
,hnccc74,2011-08-30T21:22Z,"the game freezes and the effects disappear. There is much wrong as
viruses and Trojan horses. KutDing is not a guy to recommend!
conclusion must be: KutDing ... FUCK YOU!"
,bomfunkemsis,2011-09-14T21:31Z,"Very good seed.
Great torrent."

,KevwinStanly,2011-10-12T20:37Z,Download it and it says that the file type is unknown or damaged :(
,atryd,2011-10-25T12:55Z,Works perfectly. Thanks for upload.
,kapriciouz,2011-11-18T05:00Z,"This is a buggy version of the game.  Once you get past the first cities and begin playing multi-table tournaments, players who just won the pot will often leave the table before collecting their chips, which causes the game to get stuck.

This IS a great game but this particular version must be outdated - it'd be nearly impossible to actually beat this one."
,stealthsilent,2012-02-24T17:31Z,"Whoops, no trojan on here ;) "

,supersonicsammy,2012-04-25T12:36Z,"notice how the people supporting the game make VERY CLEAR theres no trojans? 

they are lying pigs!

# trojans and several trackers are associated with this file; very hard to get rid of and very hard to detect.

DONT DOWNLOAD! VIRUSES INFECTING TORRENT!"
