Please uploader can you fix, useless as is. Don't waste your time."
,jakeblues1791,2011-05-01T06:27Z,"@Ausie2 ... Pls don't be so hasty in saying ""don't waste your time"", up to now, it's but only you who was unable to get by the serial number. Otherwise there would be more comments here. 

Now, for your benefit, I've tried a re-installation on my own pc, and the serial checked out fine (again).

Having said that, I can be of no further help at this moment.

Regards,
Jake"
