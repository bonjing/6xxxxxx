You can get the files from MVGroup or possibly eztv or possibly Demonoid. The easiest place to the files from is MVGroup."

You just need to login to forums[dot]mvgroup[dot]org and click on the tab marked ""MAIN TRACKER"" then enter ""South Pacific"". You'll find two versions: the Xvid and the HD version. Most of the torrents don't use the private flag so the torrents are open - no passkey needed and DHT/PES is allowed."
