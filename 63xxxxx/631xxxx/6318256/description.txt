Ex-Suede guitarist Bernard Butler here makes his solo debut. His taste here runs toward ornate string-encased ballads. Butler obviously has talent, there are germs of a great album here, but he lacks the discipline personally to drop weaker songs from the lineup when needed and to trim unneeded fat out of his material. A great promise not kept.
