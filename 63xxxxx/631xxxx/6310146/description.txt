Bowflex i-Trainer v3.4.9 for Windows | 674 mb

There are plenty of people wanting to get into shape, but they simply donâ€™t know how to do it, what gym to go to, and what specific equipment to buy.

If they finally chosen their equipment, often times they find them too difficult to use.

Those that may get the hang of things may have a hard time tracking their progress and realize they arenâ€™t going anywhere with the workouts theyâ€™ve been doing.

Going to the gym is okay since there are people there that will assist you and all of the gym-class equipment ready for use, but going to the gym takes a drive away and that can waste some money on gasoline and waste physical effort.

People wind up getting portable exercising equipment, but either doesnâ€™t have the right features or sufficient documentation on using the machine making it too difficult to use.

Getting a Bowflex Home Gym product is definitely the way to go since it has tons of revolutionary features that will get anyone in shape. Every Bowflex Home Gym product comes with both a comprehensive instruction manual and fitness guide, but for those who are completely new, something more visual is needed. Videos are thrown in to serve as extras to help demonstrate exercises, but they still lack interactivity. But the Bowflex Revolution i-Trainer Software does something different and turns your PC into a real fitness advisor and workout tracker.

The Bowflex Revolution i-Trainer Software is a wonderful add-on that should have been included with the entire Bowflex Revolution Home Gym system. It has interactivity features that no other program or video contains.
