,illiria,2011-04-13T12:53Z,"Forgot to tell - if you've installed my previous repack (with patch 1.02) - clean out your ""addins"" folder before installing this one. ""addins"" folder is in your game folder."
,GIS88,2011-04-13T12:54Z,thank you !
,illiria,2011-04-13T13:05Z,"@ GIS88

Anytime, and once again, really sorry it happened. I was repacking in a middle of a night, and I was drunk. >_<


Also preferable to have a savegame before you've installed previous repack, or it may say content is missing (that stupid unofficial mod I've included by mistake). I know, I know - sorryyyyy! Doing my best here. :P"
,AITDS,2011-04-13T13:07Z,"Hope this patch fixes the performance problems i experience running this game on DX11.. I have a powerful rig, GTX570 graphics card and the game still ran like crap, even on 'high' settings.."
,AITDS,2011-04-13T13:21Z,"The game seems to run a slight bit smoother, but still not optimal. "
,Ev1lm0use,2011-04-13T14:35Z,"Hello!
Exe files don't work with MacOsX. Can't you just make archive for MacOsX users to replace all files manually?

Thank you."
,Freaky_Freddy,2011-04-13T14:49Z,"Thank you for doing this Illiria!

and btw, i can just install this on top of your other DLC pack right?"
,illiria,2011-04-13T15:11Z,"@ Freaky_Freddy

If you have original DLC Pack (without patch), or DLC Pack with patch 1.01 - you can install on top.

If today you've downloaded my first torrent with patch 1.02 - there was an issue in it, clean your ""addins"" folder (in game folder) before you install this one.

@ Ev1lm0use

EXE files don't work on MacOsX? That doesn't make any sense... How did you install the game then? o_O My installer is no different from any other installer, it should work fine.

I'll upload raw resources for you as soon, as I can. You'll need to copy ""addins"" folder into game folder, install the official patch, and then copy the crack.

I'll make a new torrent called ""Dragon Age 2 DLC/Patch 1.02 for MacOsX"". Keep an eye for it."
,illiria,2011-04-13T15:26Z,"@ Ev1lm0use


Ok, here you go - for MacOsX:

,walksonpoo,2011-04-13T16:00Z,"After installing this, its now asking me to activate it?? "
,ragingdemon17,2011-04-13T16:19Z,@ illiria So dude will this patch fix the quest 'Who Needs Rescuing''? and do i have to install patch 1.0.1 as well?
,ragingdemon17,2011-04-13T16:23Z,@ illiria So dude what will the patch fix exactly? And can i install it without patch 1.0.1? 
,ragingdemon17,2011-04-13T16:24Z,my bad for the double post. couldn't see my comment
,onallion,2011-04-13T16:42Z,"Thank you, this is great! :)"
,9LivesBW,2011-04-13T18:39Z,"Thanks for the hardwork!, uhmm this seems a little late but the unofficial mod your talking about, are those only the custom skills added to Hawke? or are there more"
,calin05,2011-04-13T18:45Z,So this is with the patch 1.02 ? The patch works ? The fixes in the patch works in the game ? Could you give me only the crack for 1.02 ?
,walksonpoo,2011-04-13T19:22Z,"I see im not the only one with the activate issue. Any word on what we did wrong, if anything?"
,illiria,2011-04-13T19:39Z,"@ pad88

If it doesn't let you run the game without registering at EA - yes, you did something wrong. But I'm no wizard and can't guess what. :/

@ ragingdemon17 

BioWare claims it fixes ""Who Needs Recruiting"", but the users seem to still have certain bugs with the quest (taken from official forum).

You can install the patch without 1.01. Full list of 1.02 fixes is here:

http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age-ii/61-30995/dragon-age-2-patch-102-is-now-live/35-490774/

@ calin05

Crack only:

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6315942


@ 9LivesBW

It's a mod that allows Hawke to fast travel and change party members at any time. Mod is called ""Meta Game Abilities DA2"".

Link:

(If link doesn't show up, search Dragon Age Nexus for the mod)."
,illiria,2011-04-13T19:44Z,"@ walksonpoo

I don't know why activation issue comes up for you specifically. My guess would be is that Windows is the problem (VIsta/7?). It probably doesn't allow my installer to copy the crack over, for whatever reason. In my post above, I gave the link to another torrent. Try downloading crack from there, and replacing manually."
,spunky_fuffy,2011-04-13T21:02Z,"Dude, you are great! You got the patch working on the same day it came out, and that's a lot!

I updated the fix (and removed the addins before, as you said in your comment), and everything works flawlessly now!

Once again, thanks a lot!"
,fuzz16,2011-04-13T23:01Z,"is there anyway that someone could upload a crack only for the 1.02 patch to a file sharing website?

I am unable to torrent on my current network and I am looking for just the crack.

thanks in advance"
,Mirolsen,2011-04-13T23:31Z,"any idea why this dlc pack changing my dubbing to english? with 1.01 version was all ok, any way to fix this ?"
,Mirolsen,2011-04-13T23:41Z,"ok, i know what was wrong, nice pack anyway, thx ^^"
,gambit51,2011-04-14T00:30Z,thanks again 
,eure_hore,2011-04-14T02:39Z,"thx man, for your work ;)"
,uhappinow,2011-04-14T07:12Z,"@ illiria

Do I just execute this file even though I already have your ""Dragon Age 2 DLC Pack (with Patch 1.01)"" (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6243153/Dragon_Age_2_DLC_Pack_%28with_Patch_1.01%29_-illiria) installed? Execute it right on top of one another because I already have DLCs and everything from your previous version."
,socleri,2011-04-14T08:29Z,"Thanks a lot!
Works Perfectly so far!"
,illiria,2011-04-14T13:18Z,"@ uhappinow

Yup, just install on top of 1.01."
,Byokugen,2011-04-14T13:23Z,"Forks fine with me, I just have 1 question. 
When do you exactly escape the imminent danger?
I decided to finish my awakening first and import character, but last time I played with ur 1.01 pack and got all the way pass the Expedition quest, and still no items. So when do u exactly get them? "
,arlind92,2011-04-16T00:51Z,thnx for the gr8 help ....can i ask are u Albanian ?
,spunky_fuffy,2011-04-16T04:39Z,"@Byokugen:
Check out a second chest in Gamlen's home (or your home if you're out of the Deep Roads already). It should have a quest sign on top."
,PopcornCow,2011-04-16T13:05Z,"OK I have a really stupid question here,

I've installed it and i can find the files in the Addins folder BUT they don't show up Downloadable Content tab ingame and I don't get access to the DLCs.

Any hints of what I might have missed?"
,DarkMerc,2011-04-16T14:41Z,"nice work man can you do me a favor?
some want the dlc only so can you release that installer if you have some time? thanks...
good release but doesnt works for some TRY following my steps if this upload dont work for you:
i use the 3 dlcs exe installers from the dragon age 2 p2p pack and the activator v6 from haoose which fixe 1.02 patch compability and it works awesome:d
(antivan garote and ring of whispers are not working cause no one crackd them YET...)"
,deepandhard,2011-04-16T21:38Z,thank you illiria. works fine installing over your 1.01 patch

,kostkoll,2011-04-20T17:55Z,"I have a question illiria. Everything is in place with the patch, i load my game after my level 21 warrior beat Meredith, i get in the house, the Mabari is there, the items unlocked and usable, the Black Emporium is there, Sebastian is there BUT i have no active quests(although in my journal there is the one about going to the chantry) and i CANNOT go elsewhere other than my house and the Black Emporium! Any idea why that is so? Thanks for the upload by the way! It's by far the easiest to use!"

Overall, working very well, BUT, when I get to Gamlen's house and take the the items from the special deliveries chest, I can no longer save, quit or select a few other things from the game controls and menus.  Do you have any idea what I can do to fix this?  Thanks"
