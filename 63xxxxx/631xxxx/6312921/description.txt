As the season opens, the Winchesters are taken to a hospital in Memphis following a car wreck caused by one of the demon Azazel's henchmen. Though Sam (Padalecki) and his father John (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) make it out of the crash with minor injuries, a dying Dean (Ackles) is in a coma. He has an out-of-body experience, and is approached by a Reaper (Lindsey McKeon) who tries to take his soul. She reveals that if he refuses to move on, he will one day become a vengeful spirit. Meanwhile, Sam tries without success to save his brother, so John contacts Azazel (Fredric Lehne) and offers to make a deal; in exchange for saving Dean's life, he will give up his own life, his immortal soul, and the mystical Coltâ€”a gun capable of killing anything.
