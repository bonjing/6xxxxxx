,ust2,2011-04-16T16:51Z," A:5 (crackles and muffles during loud/bass-y parts)
 V:9 (almost DVDrip quality!)"
,ust2,2011-04-17T06:10Z," Audio actually sounded better on a TV than headphones for once.

 Probably closer to A:6

 Would be higher if not for getting a bit of desync early and often, and during loud parts as I mentioned already. 

 Defintely no reason to wait for a better copy though, more than good enough for how the movie itself was (not very good).
