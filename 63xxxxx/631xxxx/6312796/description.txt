'THE FAMILY ALBUM' was some years in preparation." says Harvey. "Songs were written and then slipped into the 'family file'. I knew the musical feel I wanted but could not find it until 1993 when I first heard The Bushbury Mountain Daredevils - a Birmingham band who played just what I heard in my head. So here it is, a Brummie album from top to toe. And I know what the 'Man who is Brum' thinks about as he stands there, the master of fire and stars. I know the lonely dreams that light his vigil, for I heard him empty his heart."
