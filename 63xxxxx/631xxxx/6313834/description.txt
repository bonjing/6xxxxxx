Prophecy.1979.DivX-NvadR      
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079758/
   
Prophecy was originally promoted as a straightforward monster movie. 
Although critics panned the film, largely due to the unconvincing 
creature and special effects, a number of reviewers cited it as a 
horror film with a genuine social conscience. Moreover, the ecological 
details about methyl mercury contamination portrayed in the film are 
accurate, informative, and far more frightening than the storyâ€™s monster. 
In recent years, Prophecy has gained considerable popularity as an offbeat 
cult film.

I love cheesy b-movies, but must confess that sometimes it is hard to 
shoulder through the low-grade filmmaking of most.  One of the advantages 
of Prophecy is that itâ€™s quite competently directed and the production 
(excepting the incredibly fake creatures) is comparable to other similar 
films of the 70s and early 80s. Prophecy boasts some really lovely scenery
(with British Columbia doubling as Maine) and some acting that while not 
inspired, doesnâ€™t cause one to cringe. You donâ€™t get that often in schlock. 

The movie opens with Spielbergian flashlight beams in the dark as something 
hunts a search party and later Maggie makes a grotesque discovery by the river; 
the she-bearâ€™s deformed offspring are caught in a net, warbling mindlessly.  
Itâ€™s scenes like these that make for nice, shivery, drive-in moments. Prophecy 
is also not without a twisted sense of humor. Classical music plays over scenes 
of an injured dog being air-lifted out of an attack site. Armand Assante, as the 
token Native American, stares stoically,  scans the trees for mutant bears and 
tries to forget the fact heâ€™s Italian.

There is a clear turning point in the film. A family of campers settle down for 
the night , and are awakened by something growling. The daughter and father scream 
in terror as the meatloaf bear approaches, but its clearly too late for them. 
The young boy, wrapped up tight in his bright yellow sleeping bag, pulls himself 
to his feet and begins to hop around the campsite like a big (mutant) banana. 
The beast turns towards him and swats him into a rock where both the boy and 
sleeping bag explode into a flurry of feathers. As a kid, the scene was terrifying. 
As an adult, its an hilarious, off-kilter moment worthy of cheering. After this, 
the movie turns into a rubber-suit monster fest and never looks back.

The bear goes after the cubs and trashes a camp. In a scene that is reminiscent of 
Jurassic Park, Assante, Foxworth and Shire flee in a truck as the bear lumbers 
behind, trying to swipe and nudge them off the road. The movie becomes so intent on 
its obviously ridiculous monster it even forgets about Shires doomed pregnancy, the 
logging debacle, and everything else.

However, Prophecy has an atmosphere to it that helps the whole thing go down.  It 
embraces the roots of a cheesy monster picture, but at some level it still operates 
on that dark, serious tone of the 70s that gave us movies like Deliverance and Jaws. 
Its not a scab on the knee of either of those movies, but utilizing that style makes 
it seem more legitimate. If you are a die-hard horror fan, you definitely need 
to check it out. Its not going to scare you, or make you reconsider eating the fish in 
Maine, but its such a spirited failure that it can't help but be entertaining.
