Portal 2 is a unique first-person Action-Puzzle-Platforming game that tests playerâ€™s ability to think and act creatively as they use the gameâ€™s ingenious wormhole creating portal gun to produce their own paths through otherwise sealed surfaces and across the open spaces of the game. Sequel to the original Portal game â€” the surprise add-on hit included in Valve Corporationâ€™s 2007 release The Orange Box â€” Portal 2 continues the storyline from the first game, featuring both new and returning characters, and poses a range of new challenges making for a much deeper game. Additional features include a new two player co-op mode and an original soundtrack.
