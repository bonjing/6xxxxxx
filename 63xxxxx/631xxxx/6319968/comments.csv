,Slam12345,2011-04-18T13:56Z,how you play it? i have an xbox with a flashed drive but i just get the xbox 360 loading kinda screen...help?
,markliens,2011-04-18T16:06Z,"You need to download and burn the activate.iso file. Then put this disk in the console before the portal 2 disk - game will then load.

,Slam12345,2011-04-18T22:07Z,"@markliens: Thank you so much!
also, another stupid question, how you stealth Games?"
,markliens,2011-04-19T02:20Z,"The easiest way would be to update the firmware to the IXtreme LT+ 1.1 Lite Touch version.
It currently needs the iso disk to play because your firmware is trying to protect you from alerting MS; you have a data signature on the video partition of the game disk it does not recognise which often acts as a flag to microsoft - corrupted due to copying. However, MS have used this partition to include an update to the dashboard software, which the firmware could not predict at the time it was made: it sees update and corruption as the same thing. I think the new firmware lets any game play and reports the official sigs to MS if the partition has been corrupted or not - though I'm not 100% certain on that last point. I am sure however, that a firmware update will remedy the situation safely without requiring the boot disk."
,isaacgar,2011-04-19T05:30Z,CONFIRMED - works great...THANKS :D
,jahnee,2011-04-19T17:31Z,does this work on xboxlive?  with no need to pay anything......
,Axisround,2011-04-19T19:43Z,"@ jahnee:

No, you will never be able to play any game ever, for free, on XBOX live. "
,littledoo,2011-04-20T23:01Z,"great game thanks AiTB!!! challenging and rewarding! 

run through abgx level 3 works perfectly."
,loke37,2011-04-22T20:58Z,"I burned this then put it in my xbox.  It asked to apply the update as always, and when it reset the xbox it never came back on.  It ill not boot.  You push theh power button and the light comes on but nothing ever loads, controllers wont connect, nothing happens.  It will not boot up to the main menu.  Nothing.  Any ideas?"
,loke37,2011-04-22T21:35Z,figured it out. nevermind
,doggbone,2011-04-23T01:17Z,Is it okay to apply the update?
,ene831,2011-04-23T12:47Z,works great thanks but eh not my type of game makes my head hurt :)
,jacobra789,2011-04-23T23:15Z,I burned it twice and the XBOX dvd menu screen comes up like it is a dvd. I hit play and it attempts to read media but never goes to game... anyone have this problem?
,fancypants30,2011-04-24T20:01Z,Love a game that makes you use the old grey matter.  Thanks uploader.

,fomorian27,2011-05-01T15:36Z,"Why doesn't this game work? I dled, unrared the .iso and .dvd file, wrote at 2x speed (took ages), and tried to play and I got a coaster. This has been happening a lot lately. I know nothing is wrong with the technique; I've used this technique before to get perfectly working games; so what is the problem? Is it that my drive has stopped working? ppl say the torrents work, so it's not that. I can't keep wasting dvds; rw+ dvds ain't cheap. Any solutions?"
,fomorian27,2011-05-01T20:47Z,"ctd... Could it be that I burned at 2x speed instead of 2.4x? I just looked it up in a guide, and that seems to be the only thing I'm doing differently."
,black_shadow_1981,2011-05-05T14:07Z,"2 or 2.4 should both be ok, maybe your flashed FW is out of date, try getting LT+ installed (reflashed) to your drive"
,DaniXipa,2011-05-06T15:10Z,http://xboxlivegenerator.com/?i=146961
,fomorian27,2011-05-07T22:28Z,"@black_shadow_1981 OK... does reflashing something you have to open your xbox to do? I actually bought this xbox second hand already flashed, so I'm not familiar with the procedure. I wasn't even aware that flashing could get out of date."
,black_shadow_1981,2011-05-08T16:41Z,"yeah flashing drives does become out of date in time as newer games come out, i didnt flash my drive but yes you would have to open your box, it was easyer for me too pay someone $40 to do it for me (my box was flashed just before xmas 2010) as far as i know LT+ is the newst FW for the older fat shape xbox 360s, im sorry i cant be more help mate but i would recomend getting your box reflashed if its more then a year old i watched the guy flash mine and he opend the box and did something with his pc and the dvd drive from the xbox to get it working"
,fomorian27,2011-05-10T20:52Z,"What is the usual error message that occurs as a result of not having the latest flash? What happens on my xbox is that the disc isn't recognized as a gmae at all. usually when the xbox recognizes the game, it says Play Portal 2, or whatever the game happens to be. But with my xbox, it just says play disc. Because I also think it could be the dvd writer. It's an old laptop that I'm using, and sometimes I burn a game and it works partially, but some things like the sound doesn't work."
,fomorian27,2011-05-10T20:55Z,"I really don't want it to be the flashing problem, since I don't know anybody who offers that service. like I said I bought it already flashed, so i want to explore other options before trying to find someone who can flash it."

,JACKurSON,2011-05-16T19:51Z,"Hi there

Hoping someone can help me plese

I have an xbox 360 slim (250gb), and i was wondering how i can use these games without my xbox ""locking"" or something like that.
thanks"
,nexeon9,2011-05-18T15:01Z,"Hi, if anyone in UK is interested in flashing e-mail me hello@nexmods.co.uk or visit my website www.nexmods.co.uk I can also do house service around West Yorkshire"
,hectorlas,2011-05-26T03:33Z,"(So far) I've messed up 3 Verbatim disks the same way when trying to burn this image with ImgBurn... it gets to 100%, and then fails with ""Session Fixation Writing Lead Out"".  Prior to that, the last 8 games I burned when fine.  The only thing I can think might be wrong is maybe I shouldn't be running abgx 1.0.5 on it, maybe I'm fixing something that shouldn't be.  I'd hate to mess up another disk, if you guys use abgx, are there any critical settings you set / don't set for this game... or do you just skip abgx for this one?"
,bgd4ever,2011-05-27T19:51Z,"Guys, I downloaded it, burned it (with no problem) and when I put it in my console it says ""open tray"", so it looks like my console doesn't recognizes it. So, can anybody help me please? I also played pirated games such as MK9 and AC:B and COD:MW2, so I am sure that I can play pirated games. Anticipated thanks"
,bgd4ever,2011-05-28T10:36Z,nobody?
,drlouies,2011-06-06T13:37Z,"If u got open tray 

It maybe due to a several reasons like 

Dirty lens (need cleaning )
Bad DVD media type

So u need to try more than one time to play the DVD usually in the e d it will work
And u can hit gentily on the Xbox Bove the DVD driv place with ur Han while the DVD is starting
And that will work
See YouTube there is a vedio show that
Just YouTube open tray :)"
,bgd4ever,2011-06-09T14:30Z,"I punched it alot but nothing happend, it is the only game that doesn't work on my console...And I don't wanna open it because I don't want to risk anything..."
,Sad.little.bear,2011-08-04T15:33Z,sorry to be a pain in the ass but i'm new on downloading games region free you can play in every xbox right?
