,darkangle98989,2011-04-12T23:13Z,The only thing that i ask of you if you DL this from me is to SHARE to 1.50 - 2.25 and don't be a LEECHER
,tonusmx,2011-04-18T20:58Z,"Downloading now. Will do update comment on validity when it's finished.

Props to uploader for having the balls to not post anonymous and stake a claim after throwing up the torrent."

,tonusmx,2011-04-19T03:21Z,"The wait wasn't an issue. A+ was for the first legitimate Against The World torrent on TPB. I didn't make it obvious but you can guess now what the extra 2 pluses are for ;)
