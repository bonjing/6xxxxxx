1) Not my rip, I have only found this in the internet, then made the torrent. All credits goes for original ripper, who is unknown for me.

2) Nothing more to say, I think. A bit shitty, underground production, but enjoyable for maniacs.

3) I do not know what version is this - for sure it is not the newwest one.

4) Unfortunately, I cannot seed 24h/day - so please, be patient.

Cheers.
