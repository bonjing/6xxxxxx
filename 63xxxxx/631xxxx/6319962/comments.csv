,Adkins05,2011-04-18T04:43Z,"OK. SO there is a lot of questions with this ISO rip.

First thing, To play and burn games you have to have a flashed Xbox360, your ISO, ABGX360, and X360 ISO Hacker (for MAC), A Dual Layer R-DVD, and a Dual Layer burner. Look it up on YouTube.

Secondly, I have burnt many games and I know what I am doing. This is a bad rip.

then:

1) make sure your xbox is flashed with the latest iextreme lt+ firmware
2) download a program called abgx
3) while in abgx go to the autofix tab, set to level 3
4)open the disc image file of whatever game you have downloaded in abgx
5) wait for the game to be stealth patched etc and wait till it has finished. you will be prompted to press any key to exit.
6)go back to the folder containing the games files and now click the and open the image file.
7)it should automatically open in the program imgburn (im assuming you have this? if not then download imgburn!)
8)put a blank dldvd in you drive hopefully a verbatim disc.
9) hit the burn button and wait for the game to burn........hey presto! a fully functioning new game.
10) MOST IMPORTANTLY! after all steps are complete, raise you middle finger high in the air and shout FUCK YOU MICROSOFT!!!!!!


im so tired of reading comment after comment by you insignificant little maggots that think you know what your talking about!!! jesus fucking christ,,, stay off tpb.......your really not wanted here....!"
,H3LL5CR3AM,2011-04-19T19:46Z,dumb ass its not real. lol all u gotta do is open the iso to see its just a systemupdate folder with a audio and video ts folder as in a dvd movie.there is NO GAME DATA on disk.

everyone else, one of two things is happening (and this goes for all the popular MK torrents right now)
a) this is working on certain xbox's and not on others for a reason nobody has figured or atleast mentioned yet

or

b) the torrents are fake

either way, if someone knows for sure what is happening, or has had a successful burn themselves, please speak up, otherwise everyone just be patient"

my friend , this torrent is work fine trust me ,

u dont need the iso to be a specific size to burn a game

some games have only 6 GiB  size and maube less (espically the old games ),the imgburn will burn the unusable space 

so just burn it and be sure to set the Layer Break to 1913760 and burn on 2.4x speed

and have fun : )"

yea i got .dvd after extracting ,

maybe u r not extracing with winrar ??

i once had problems using winzip ,

so am using winrar now ,

try winrar ."
,drlouies,2011-04-22T06:05Z,"@SoruBaddogai

yea they will not work cause the new update will update the dashboard ,

and when updated the dahboard will activate a AP2.5 schem that in certain games

that will not allow them to work again

and the games that have ap2.5 are 6 games :

COD black ops and modern warfare 2 ,halo reach ,fable 3 ,assassin Creed brothehood,
need for speed hot pursuit .

so the solution is 

to take the iso of the blak ops like example and re patch it through abgx360 ,follow this toturial

http://www.ixtreme.net/360-backups/abgx-tutorial-t5056.html

and u need the last ixtrem LT +1.1 to play AP2.5
IF u have a benq or lite-on drive .


BUT! if u have a original samsung or old hitachi drive u will not need any of these things above

cause these 2 drives are not able to check for AP2.5, and its safe to update dashboard .

so is better to know whats u drive type first and make sure if its original drive of the xbox not a spoofed one  ; )"

A problem which I noticed was that the older abgx version wasnt recognizing this iso properly (I have got the both the abgx reports posted in the comments) , so kindly re-download and reinstall abgx in an entirely new location, redo and re-save the proper settings as posted in one of the links above and it should work.

This game WORKS WITH NO AP2.5, have it working on LT 1.1 (no plus). 

Speaking of AP2.5, thanks again to drlouies, although must say even all versions of the six games u mentioned dont always have AP2.5, friend told me his Fable 3 had worked without it.

btw, do NFS Shit 2 and Crysis 2 have AP2.5?

Thanks to all the sharing community, and lets enjoy together rather than using hard words against fellow gamers."

Thx for the suggestion. I uninstalled ABGX360 and deleted anything that remained. I then reinstalled the latest version from a setup file into a different location.

Alas, no luck. Any other suggestions?"

Hi mate I'm a fellow Aussie and it appears you could have downloaded a FAKE! I downloaded my copy via usenet and it works 100% fine. I think if you try the other copy on thepiratebay you might have success (not guaranteed) if 
you check below there is some basic info from my working copy. I notice the filename of your .exe is textureloaddemo.exe which is what convinces me its a dud copy. Also mine shows 50 Achievements etc (more evidence yours is fake)anyway mate good luck and I hope thats all it is, to all others I think the people with working copies have downloaded the other torrent of the same name and then have commented in this torrent accidently, not sure but hope it gets sorted coz the game is awesome

Yes, you are right in observing that though the downloaded version is 1.05 for ABGX it still shows 1.02, but as long as you downloaded the latest, it should work.

As for the abgx report you posted, have not seen it on my pc, though have seen the two others, are you sure you downloaded this particular release by AiTB? Because this """"Size: 253766144 bytes (filesize too small!)""

.. size error would not occur if all your files were intact. As a fellow user commented earlier, you might want to Force Check the downloaded torrent via utorrent, just in case file sizes were altered. I unzipped via 7-Zip on Win 7 and it worked with no size errors.

A reminder to all, kindly do not burn till abgx gives a green, as if it hasnt there is already an error somewhere in your files. But if its green, then the game should work as I have tried it via only this torrent.

To ""nookief""

Not tried it on old non hdmi 360, but if abgx says its fine, then its probably an issue with your older 360, not sure though.

I have wasted 3 disks in this and 2 in the other with the same name.

,Jewrean,2011-04-25T12:39Z,"@nookief

1) It could be that your firmware on your flashed Xbox is out of date and cannot run the newer wave game. Either update your firmware or use an activate disc.

2) Again, it's probably the wave of the game, so use Wavepatcher to reduce it to a lower wave. I am doing that right now. I'll let you know if it works."
,KnightYn,2011-04-25T12:55Z,"To Jewrean,

Well good you could get it abgx verified, if its still not working then its probably your flash, sadly we dont know your flash or your drive so there seems to be no authentic way of verifying the same. btw what is the exact error its giving when u insert the disc?

Maybe you should ask the guy who flashed your 360.

Mine is with a Liteon Drive, flashed last Sep with LT 1.1 (No plus), I had updated my dashboard with the new kinect one via one of the games earlier, WWE All Stars, not this MK release. I havent ever used the activation disc and never had the need to Wave patch any game on this flash of mine, but of course the ap2.5 games are not playable.

One last thing Jewrean, dont throw this disc, it should work once you tinker with your flash, hopefully.

Caution: THIS MK release has some issue with updating the dashboard, kindly use some other source to update it, either a game or via usb.

To ""madshillz"" :
This torrent is confirmed working with LT1.1(plus NOT needed), meaning it doesnt have ap2.5"

,Jewrean,2011-04-25T13:56Z,"Ok got it working and here is a step-by-step guide for those of you who can't get it working.

1) Download THIS torrent. The other one is a fake.
2) Extract using WinRar.
3) Use Abgx to ensure the torrent worked without any corruption. Here is a Guide or you can use the other one that was linked earlier (which is probably better):

http://forums.afterdawn.com/thread_view.cfm/732074

4) Abgx should say everything is good. Next there are a few options:

A) Ensure your Xbox360 is flashed with the latest firmware and it should work. Burn the ISO and play.

B) Use Waves Patcher to convert the game to a lower Wave. It is currently Wave 11. I converted it to Wave 3. Use ImgBurn like you would for any other game and burn the PATCHED ISO.

5) ???

6) Profit"

Hi again mate now that we are pretty certain this is the correct torrent, I can only assume it is your flashed 360 firmware stopping you. I only recently got my xbox modded so am new to this myself. I don't have an activate disc or a wave patcher but I do know this game works (still need to pay MS points for online pass like alot of newer games but singleplayer is best) usenet does cost money (i.e $10 for 25Gb or $25 for 180Gb or $15 a month unlimited from news.astraweb.com) I only use it for high priority d/l's such as this game coz its max speed d/l's that work 99.9% of the time and I use torrents for the rest, a free usenet app is SABnzbd (.nzb is like a torrent file) and u get them from nzbsrus.com or other sites.

AND FOR THE AP2.5 GAMES ,u r right but not completly ,yes fable 3 worked without the patch ,but why ?

the ap2.5 was in the fable 3 from the first time it release ,and it was like the sleeping cell hahaha

when the 2.0.12611.0 dashboard came out ,it activate the ap2.5 in 3 games NFS hot pursuit,fable 3 assassin creed BH

offcours the NFS HP ,ACBH, didnt work cause they need the new dashboard to work ,and that will activate the ap2.5
and no one will notice that,
but for fable 3 it came out before these games and the new dashboard ,so it didnt need the new dashboard to work,
so when ur friend played the fable 3 on the old dashboard ,the ap2.5 wasnt activated,but now when he will update to the new dashboard 

he will not be able to play it again untile he repatch ap2.5
so thats what happend

and just to let u know and many other ppl , many games we have ,they have ap2.5 in them ,but they are not activate it yet

and u should be carefull,if a new dashboard came out and u updated and certain game didnt work and gave u black screen

immidiatly u need to remove the game from xbox and dont u put it back untile u make sure whats goin on,cause u will get flaged and that will lead u to banned


and for the shift 2 and crysis 2 they dont have ap2.5 for now that for sure ,but they have 11th wave.
