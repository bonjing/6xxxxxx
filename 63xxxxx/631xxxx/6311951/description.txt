        Academy Award winner Natalie Portman in an "utterly            
        fearless performance" stars as a newlywed trying to cope       
        with guilt and loss in this sensitive and compelling            
        modern drama adapted by writer-director Don Roos from           
        the novel by Ayelet Waldman.                                    
                                                                       
        Portman plays Emilia, a law-school graduate who falls in       
        love with her married boss, Jack. After Emilia marries          
        Jack, her happiness turns unexpectedly to grief                 
        following the death of her infant daughter. Devastated,         
        Emilia nonetheless carries on, attempting to forge a           
        connection with her stepson William and to resist the          
        interference of Jack's jealous ex-wife.
