Thanks for the upload."

Catch me by the Claire I'll be right there
niggas copy everything we say
Louie frames, eyes lower than my GPA
Ridin and Swirvin, kush Im blown
Doors wide, my trunk bark like eddie rolls
I dont take hoes I never tip tha stripper
I'm rich bitch, but you can call me cheap tha ripper
Shell toes? Yes
P.R.P.S Theres a man riding a horse on top of my chest
polo fresh, I am z' man
I be slam dunkin and tanqueray shots wit Lebron
I told niggas to keep it Carmello ok?
rolled past dave's told them hello and hey
Me and Cash on somthin' holy on 23's hoe

Back windows say MAMA MEL BICHO
Skateboarders grind, I grind too
Thats why you can catch me in DC shoes
I quit the team, but believe im ballin'
Want a verse? Put up a stack or quit callin'
30's on my Chevorlete call me supa dupa
Garage like roots I got more whips than Kunta 
Rivera sittin on the Bulls best hoopa
Ya'll still ridin 20's? ya'll some oompa loompas
Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
my 4 15's woke up thee neighbors
Interior croc-a-dile alli-ga-tor 
I drive a Chevrolet movie theater"
