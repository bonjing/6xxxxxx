,jimclip,2011-04-14T04:52Z,"V = 8, A = 6.5, thanks for sharing !!!

Very fast download. Picture is much improved over the ""TS"" version I grabbed here earlier, but the audio on this version is lower and of course isn't pristine quality either. It is what it is until DVD is released etc, still nice to have. But if you can, GO SEE IT IN IMAX or regular theatre....the IMAX version blew me away, unreal film...just don't go expecting a story line like The English Patient :)"
,atom995,2011-04-16T00:38Z,"I got download speed of 3kb/s with uTorrent, and 30kb/s with Miro.
Sample Video:
V: 7.5
A: 7.0

The Best Quality if you ask me. Better than Imagine and Tvt"
,atom995,2011-04-16T07:41Z,"I have 3 hours left before my download completes.
Going at 50kb/s on Miro.
I think it would have completed earlier if this file was compressed.

(I know, people dont trust archives)"

,ashen77,2011-04-21T01:38Z,"AWESOME movie, I'd defo wait for dvd copy or watch it at the flicks though. Its an OK copy, but to many fight scenes for a cam or what ever it was.

TY though, did a great job on making a crap copy pretty damn good. resssssssspec"

thank so much :)"
,bebe0169,2011-04-21T15:16Z,best quality i've found of this. V8 A8 just had to adjust my screens brightness and saturation :) good times
,satanmr,2011-04-21T21:07Z,"if this was done with a cam it is excellent.
thanks for posting it.

for anyone wondering about the quality - my opinion of the quality is that it is absolutely excellent for those who wish to watch it repeatedly or lazily at home.

but it doesn't compare to the theatre or a kickass dvd or blu-ray.  

but once again, excellent post.  worth downloading.

btw - this cuts off the end credits, and therefore, the you don't see or hear the song blu and dr gorski sing and dance to during them."

The audio is OK, a little tinny. The video is WAY too dark. However, it is pretty good for a cam. It is probably the second or third best cam I have seen. It REALLY needs a levels adjustment, half the screen is black most of the time. I can barely see anything, especially in Babydoll's dream world.

The movie itself is pretty retarded, I expected more from the trailers. The one redeeming feature is the music."
,subliminal_city,2011-04-22T22:39Z,"Nice a/v but seriously, what a piece of shit movie. Amazing that someone actually funded this garbage."
,xenixit,2011-04-23T12:08Z,"Ärligt talat.... Visst är det kul att tillgången finns och all kred till uploader, men det här är ingen bra kvalitet! Referenspunkten måste väl vara en BD Rip, och då håller denna A=3 / V=3......
Att se en film med denna kvalitet, tar ju död på hela upplevelsen! Ni som sätter höga 8:or och 9:or i kvalitet, borde verkligen tänka om......
Tack för upload i alla fall......"

,tonym2112,2011-04-27T17:30Z,"To all noobs...if your using utorrent...go to preferences>bandwidth and set global upload rate to 25. set max number connections and max connected peers to 500 each...
This should make downloads faster. 
Also...use VLC player it's free and it plays almost anything you can throw at it with no problems.
Just some friendly advice. Hope it helps.
Thanks Heist...you and your team do great work. This was a fantastic cam copy!"
