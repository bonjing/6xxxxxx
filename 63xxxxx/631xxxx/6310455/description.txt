http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124185/

Under the Skin is a 1997 drama film written and directed by Carine Adler starring Samantha Morton. It tells the story of two sisters coping with the death of their mother. One sister, Rose (played by Claire Rushbrook), who is married and pregnant, manages to get on with her life. Iris (Morton) feels suffocated in her current relationship and her life spirals out of control once she leaves her boyfriend, Gary (Matthew Delamere).

  Samantha Morton  ...  Iris Kelly  
  Claire Rushbrook  ...  Rose Kelly  
  Rita Tushingham  ...  Mum  
  Christine Tremarco  ...  Vron  
  Stuart Townsend  ...  Tom  
  Matthew Delamere  ...  Gary  
  Mark Womack  ...  Frank  
  Clare Francis  ...  Elena  
  Joe Tucker  ...  Sam  
  Daniel O'Meara  ...  Max  
  Crissy Rock  ...  Compere  
  Lisa Millett  ...  Sylvia (as Lisa Millet)  
  John Whitehall  ...  Man at station  
  Marie Jelliman  ...  Manageress  
  Michelle Byatt  ...  Woman In Lost Property  

Carine Adler's feature film debut takes a revealing look at a young girl's way of coping after the death of her mother. Adler broaches the subject with poignancy, sensitivity and strength. It is a brutal depiction of emotional devastation and grief experienced by the greatest of losses. The basic premise that men externalize their anger and grief, while women internalize it and head down a path of self-depravation, mutilation or promiscuity, comes from forensic psychiatrist Estela Welldon's book Mother, Madonna, Whore. Interesting concept, and one that could no doubt be the forum for much discussion.

As a film, Under the Skin is a powerful exploration, canvassing phases of denial, anger, self-hatred and losing all sense of self and self-respect. It shows the black sordid path to nowhere that a profound emotional tragedy or shock can bring. We humans are a complex lot, and our emotional persona is often hidden, even to ourselves.

The juxtapositioning of scenes such as the coffin being enflamed at the crematorium with scenes of sexual promiscuity are unsettling and make for emotional discomfort. The cast is tops, with a stand-out performance by Samantha Morton, whose plaintive, child/woman vulnerability is luminous on the screen. The notion of dressing in the clothes and wig of her lost mother, is not as bizarre as it may at first appear. And what she doesn't realise is that her aggressive self-destructive behaviour is responsible for her isolation and rejection. The jokes about the ashes - as is laughing at inappropriate times, is paramount to such awkward topics and situations. Compelling to watch, Under the Skin is sad, poignant, moving and revealing cinema. Insightful, it pierces to the core of human emotions, we become involved in Iris's journey.
