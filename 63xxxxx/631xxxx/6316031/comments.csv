,L3fT4D34D,2011-04-14T08:43Z,"OMG I CAN COMMENT. 

extremezone, I went through hell trying to comment on your uploads.. First, it wouldn't let me register, so I had to dig up an old account I made years ago which took me forever..

Then when I got it, it wouldn't let me comment, don't know why.. then a mod or someone helped me out.. and yeh..

I just wanted to say you upload the best torrents, and I appreciate all you're work. I download from you, and only you. 

Keep up the amazing work man ;) 

I will be sure to comment on everyone of your uploads, now that I can comment! 

Thanks again."
,heavydiamond,2011-04-14T09:36Z,"no brainer better than ppv ,commenting on when it dark or looking at a darkish colour it's a bit patchy ,by no way am i complaining about the uploader as he is solid ,this is about the source ,size maybe filters used also as this is a R5 they r very often inferior releases of the film ,i will have to wait 4 the bdrip or something thats all .dont get me wrong large tv's do this to films"

Not so much noticeable in the quiet parts, but come battles the sound quality is pretty horrendous. Plus in some places the audio is slightly out of synch, in some scenes quite badly.

Video is great and as you would expect."
,hurka79,2011-09-04T20:35Z,Thanks! But the audio is bad! i disappointed
,bragazar1710,2011-09-15T14:21Z,thanks.
,Lopes_221,2011-10-15T00:24Z,"extremezone thanks for the upload, but i gotta say not one of your better on the audio sides. in the scenes with heavy base my speakers seemed to be grumbly and a lot of times teh audo track was off by a few seconds.

,Yamiino,2012-01-11T06:19Z,"Video is fine and audio is kinda bad, however the worse part was the movie itself :P

90% of the time i was like ""uhmm... okay?..."""
,GDRGDR1,2012-02-14T06:02Z,"Mr_n_MrsDreadJonny - I got a notice from my ISP for this as well, and I was running Peerblock.

I could have something setup wrong, but either way Peerblock was running and I received the notice."
