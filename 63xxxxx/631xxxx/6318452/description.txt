StoryLine: 
*********

Police officer Benny is obsessed with American police cliches and livens up 
his own boring everyday life with dreams of duels with bad guys. But poor 
Benny and his colleagues doesn't have much to do in the small town of 
HÃ¶gbotrÃ¤sk. Most of their days are spent drinking coffee, eating sausage 
waffles and chasing down stray cows. Peace and quiet is the dream of every 
politician, but for the Swedish authorities, the lack of crooks is reason to 
close the local police station. When the cops investigate a suspected act of 
vandalism, they realise that they themselves may be able to raise the crime 
statistics high enough to stay in business.
