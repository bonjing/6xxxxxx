,Mutegrill,2011-06-26T14:27Z,"This is as the case with ""Jalla Jalla 2000 NORDiC PAL DVDR NightLive"":

""The quality of the MAIN movie is really horendous, hence the size; only 2,8gb. This is probably greatly compressed from a DVD9 version. You should have mentioned that the extras and the menus takes up 1,6 Gb. Sadly, it seems there is no high resolution alternative on Piratebay...""

This is the problem with ISO:s, itÂ´s impossible to determine the quality when you canÂ´t see the main movie VOB:s - If there are at least three full ones (0,99 gb) and one close to full in a 4,3 gb release, you can be quite certain the quality is ok.

Sorry to say, but I will be hesitant to download ""NightLive:s"" ISO DVD:s in the future, unless the technical specs is attached i the description.

But downloading was really quick though!"
