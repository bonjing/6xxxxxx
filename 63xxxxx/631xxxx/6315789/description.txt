This torrent contains a summary of a discussion of the Economic Calculation Problem, by economist and market abolitionist John O'Neill. It is taken from his books The Market and Markets, Deliberations and Environment. I have tried to present his view as faithfully as I could, and large parts of it are direct quotations of him.

This second part concerns epistemological arguments made chiefly by Hayek.

This was written for the purpose of an ongoing debate in regards to a Resource Based Economy, and was first posted the on the forums of the Zeitgeist Movement. This is no way to be taken as an indication of professor O'Neill's support of said organization, or even his awareness of it's existence. I believe a lot of this is relevant to a RBE, but bear in mind that non-market alternatives can take other forms than that. Bear in mind also that only the ideas in a single publication are represented, and do not necessarily give a complete picture of professor O'Neill's views, or even necessarily confirm to his views after the time of the publication.
