Work of director Mihajlo Obrenov
==========================
This is the collection of short films and music videos directed by Mihajlo Obrenov. He started his interest in video art and movie making during the late 90's. Finishing Film Academy he worked with a lot of industrial bands from Serbia and did many videos and experimental films. In 2010. he directed his first movie - Araneum - 77' sf horror drama. Many film critics stated that his work contains powerful visual aesthetics. This is a 'best of' collection containing mostly music videos he done for his own band - dreDDup, also some of his experimental movies, commercials and trailers included. I've inserted the link to his website where you can find more videos and his music. I hope you will find this DVD interesting.
