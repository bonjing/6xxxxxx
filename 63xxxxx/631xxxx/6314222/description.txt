Extended Prelude to Programming provides beginning students with a language-independent framework for learning core programming concepts and effective design techniques. This approach gives students the foundation they need to understand the logic behind program design and to establish effective programming skills.

This edition has been fully revised to offer students a lively and accessible presentation as they learn core programming concepts, such as data types, control structures, data files and arrays and program design techniques, such as top-down modular design and proper program documentation and style. Problem-solving skills are developed when students learn how to use basic programming tools and algorithms which include data validation, defensive programming, calculating sums and averages, and searching and sorting lists.
