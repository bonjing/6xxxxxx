PLOT:
Motor City moves the action to Michigan and explores the world of
dirty cops on the violent streets of Detroit. Marty Kingston
(Liotta) is an undercover narcotics detective who is shot and barely
survives a drug bust gone wrong to save the life of his partner.
When his partner is killed by a masked gunman four years later,
Marty must team up with the hotheaded homicide detective Dan
Sullivan (Hatosy) to investigate a string of brutal cop murders and
hunt down the cop killer. The investigation that ensues is shrouded
in deception and loaded with plot twists that question the line
between the rules of law and justice.[/size][/b]
