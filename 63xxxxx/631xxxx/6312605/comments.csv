,sarsapil,2011-04-12T18:12Z,"Zundel is a fanatic neo-nazi who lies through his teeth to try to convince people that the psycho and murderer Hitler was a nice guy (""the Hitler we loved"", he shamelessly wrote). He was put on trial in Canada and condemned, all his witnesses were shown to be liars, he was later freed on a technicality (freedom of speech carried to an obscene length, like allowing pedophiles to say why they love to rape young kids, etc.), when deported to Germany he was imprisoned there for the same crime of denying the holocaust, shitting on the memories of millions slaughtered
by the nazi mass killing machine. A sad, pathetic example of sick human being...  Just one example of the many deliberate lies in his videos: he says Ana Frank's diary is a forgery by the writing with ball point pen on it, much later than WW2, what they hide is that those writings were marginal annotations by people who inspected the diary AFTER the war, none of them refer to the text in the diary itself. And so with almost EVERY STATEMENT made therein. Of course, they know that for their true believers, those lies seem to ratify their fanatic beliefs and that is what counts for those sick people. David Irving, the ""respected historian"" witness, as they say, was condemned in a British court and the judge called him A LIAR in view of the evidence of the trial. And I could go on and on... Besides, he couldn't get a nazi aryan certificate because it seems some of his grandparents were jewish, talk of a screwed up guy..."

Ya know.., I find it quite amazing at times, how some people are so ""biased"" in their thoughts (and just resort to ""name-calling"").., that they seem to have an attitude that virtually says: ""I've already got my mind made-up.., so PLEASE don't confuse me with the facts"" !!

Also another important point to consider is:

""He who wins the War.., also writes the History"" !!

Yes / No ??"
