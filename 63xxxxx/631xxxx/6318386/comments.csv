,212hal,2011-04-29T04:25Z,"It's not perfect, its a fair ts version. Download a better version in case you're planning to watch this on a bigger screen. However some might have a better screen than others and some expect less than others too, so if you're in doubt, download and see for yourself. Just remember to upload what you download :)"

,silky23,2011-05-21T08:01Z,thanks
,millerman88,2011-06-13T21:57Z,GodDamnedTrollz..........Why are you saying FAKE and giving It large with the insults? It might not be the best but that's no reason to be disrespectful to someone who's gone to the time and trouble to give us this movie torrent. People give their time and effort to help others only to have an untermenchen like you insult him\her. It's ungrateful babies like you who will end up spoiling P2P for the many of us who appreciate and are grateful for It. Go BUY the full-price DVD If you're not happy. Your kind aren't wanted here.
,bignbeefy,2011-08-12T06:07Z,"at jay, for your ps3 u can stream them directly with ps3 media server. google it and download, its easy. thats what i use. it even supports reall time conversion for mkx files"
