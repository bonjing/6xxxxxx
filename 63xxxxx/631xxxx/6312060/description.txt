Linda Pressly reports on the controversial deal offered by Ecuador over an oilfield under
pristine rainforest. Ecuador is asking for billions to stop the field being developed, but
will the deal work?

Ecuadorâ€™s decision to forego potentially lucrative oil drilling in the Amazon forest in order to protect a biologically rich and fragile ecosystem represents a huge sacrifice for a small South American country which earns half its export revenues from oil.

In 2007, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa boldly halted operations at one of the countryâ€™s most promising wells. That amounts to 25 percent of Ecuadorâ€™s known oil reserves, which works out to about 846 million barrels of crude. The oil sits below Yasuni National Park, one of the most biologically diverse places on the planet.

Cleaning up depredations of previous exploration continues.
