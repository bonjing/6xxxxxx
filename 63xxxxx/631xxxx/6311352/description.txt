Changing his identity, moving from town to town with his guardian Henri (Olyphant), John is always the new kid with no ties to his past. In the small Ohio town he now calls home, John encounters unexpected, life-changing events-his first love (Agron), powerful new abilities and a connection to the others who share his incredible destiny.

VIDEO:I Am Number Four 720p files .... Thanks Addicted
AUDIO:I Am Number Four line ... Thanks m8ty , I Am Number Four ppvrip ..... Thanks IFLiX

NOTES:
IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........I Am Number Four 

Right here we go with another version of this,but this time with a new cam video 

The source was interlaced,filmed at a angle,was dull looking....but miles better than most cams.

So what we did was drop it in vdub so we could rotate the video level and pull the sides in with a perspective filter so we lose hardly any video....then we had to resize it and then add our normal stuff of brightness,contrast,chroma

sharpness etc...

Oh also for this the subs were in french so we made our own subpack and hardcoded english subs in yellow when needed.

Now the audio ....man what a ball ache.After a few of us trying to sync this with many different methods and getting nowhere,we

then noticed the video was different to the line audio....so we tried the ppvrip audio,and guess what ??that was bloody different aswell lol.

So in the end to make it complete we had to use both audio files ...main body is line audio with 4-5 gaps lasting from 22 secs to 1min of ppv audio.

Now because they sounded different and had different levels,we tried to get them close as possible by normalizing and hard levelling the audio then we used a hiss reduction and changed the EQ....you can see hear the change overs,but at least they sound better now.
Enjoy folks
