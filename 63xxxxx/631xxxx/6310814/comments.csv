,Shirays,2011-04-17T13:23Z,"Seriously, correct your torrent its not in english its in russian"
,KengurBGD,2011-06-09T19:08Z,"This is Russian release version. Game install's completely on Russian and you can't change it to English so if you need English release search for other torrent.
Only explanation how to install this is on English here. I don't know if uploader made this big mistake on purpose to promote his upload or he didn't check what he is uploading."
,Tuzazz,2011-06-25T18:54Z,"Got it easy to install k my English is not so good but you got to do this. 
1. Install game without Internet connection. there is installer luncher...
2. Mark everything what hes saying don't know what kind of letters but mark everything.
3. After installation run in you computers drive where you see the game TVM_GARGLD... open then run TRiViUM folder copy [Rome] file and all [Packs] files to Hard disk program files Akella Games.

AND IT WORKS GRATE!!! ENJOY GOOD GAME!!!"

,ooz28,2011-08-27T22:38Z,"delete everything in 

D:\oyunlar\gar\Âåëèêèå İïîõè - Ğèì - Ïğàâëåíèå Àâãóñòà\Local

the game will be english."
,ooz28,2011-08-27T23:11Z,"sorry guys, intro screen is english but the game didn't open."
,RadleyGH,2011-09-28T02:54Z,"Don't bother downloading if you are looking for an english release. Deleting the \local folder DOES NOT WORK. The game will not get past the launcher video.

I've also tried updating the game to no avail. Go for one of the reloaded ones, haven't tried either yet, so I can't recommend one.

NOT IN ENGLISH. THIS IS THE RUSSIAN VERSION."
,peppe2142,2012-02-19T23:31Z,"okay i was just about to give up on this torrent until i figured it out. first off, this file is indeed in Russian no doubt about it. The expansion is exactly what it is an expansion, therefore it must use the orginal files of Grand Ages Rome. 

Go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Kalypso\Grand Ages Rome\Local"" copy English.hpk. 

Now go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Akella Games\Ã‚Ã¥Ã«Ã¨ÃªÃ¨Ã¥ ÃÃ¯Ã®ÃµÃ¨ - ÃÃ¨Ã¬ - ÃÃ°Ã Ã¢Ã«Ã¥Ã­Ã¨Ã¥ Ã€Ã¢Ã£Ã³Ã±Ã²Ã \Local "" and get rid of Russian.hpk and now paste the english. 

Do the same in the Voice folder. 

enjoy :)"
