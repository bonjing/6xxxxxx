,CosmAvngr,2011-05-27T04:26Z,"I really don't get the trend lately of doing 720p with low bitrates. It leads to artifacts like crazy.

I picked up a few missing episodes here because BoB releases only has ep13.

BoB releases are lower resolution and 140MB but the video quality is better despite the lower resolution and smaller files.

,kalbloke,2011-08-20T22:34Z,"For those of us who are fortunate to have monitors larger than 26"" 720p is great!
Also smart uploaders like mkvGOD shrink the files to 2/3 a normal 700mb and give Hi-Def for larger monitors.
For us, its a win-win all the way.
And if, and like 80% of the world is, only on ASDL broadbands of just 50kbps than the smaller files make huge sense for, in reality, the shared seed/leech ratio give just 7-17kbps.
So hats off to mkvGOD and the way he has shown us the future of torrent-magic!!!"
,kalbloke,2011-08-30T23:16Z,"Hi CosmAvngr 
Thanks to mkvGod we are getting 720p for the larger 32in screens in small sizes.
In the real world, and NOT as in the rich world, we have to somehow manage with mere 30-50kbps.
So hats of to mkvGOD andYIFY for doing this.
Ofcourse there is a compromise but the screen size dictates it.
Cheers"
