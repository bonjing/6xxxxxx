:))"
,NitrogenUA,2011-04-21T14:08Z,"
karlopot, not yet, man.

RayMafnas, as people say, those monsters begin to react only after you inflict some good amount of damage. To tell you what - If you see that mob doesn't care about your attacks for a while, you're probably have nothing to do there, cuz when it's waken up you'll feel it's rage. From my perspective, only a party of 20-like-level heroes can take em down safely."
,partypoison,2011-04-22T14:00Z,does it work with 5.50 gen d (full)?
,Royboy510,2011-04-22T17:05Z,"@partypoison & everyone else

To play  this game, you need GEN-D3(2) + Prometheus 4"

,NitrogenUA,2011-05-28T09:08Z,"For GEN-D3 use Patapon 3 patched.rar.
And as far as i know, savegame import doesn't work in this version. Though, i have no US savegame to test that fact."

,pspmala,2011-07-08T03:10Z,NitrogenUA PLEASE HELP FOR HOW TO MAKE IT WORK IN M33 6 
,donatellomartie,2011-07-21T05:32Z,"Works on 5.50 gen d3. Copy the patched iso.

@NitrogenUA
Do you as well have the older versions of Patapon? Thanks for this, by the way."
,D.Coiote,2011-07-21T19:55Z,"Worked nicely on PSP 2000, 5.50 GEN-D3. Thanks a lot!! any link to the patching procedure? I tried patching Patapon 3 with no success :(."
,silencesummer,2011-08-05T07:47Z,"Nope, neither works for me. I get an error code for the unpatched, and the patched just sits on a blank screen. I've had God of War and FFVII working, but no luck with this. PSP 2000, CFW 5.0 M33, suppose I should update."
,NitrogenUA,2011-08-24T11:05Z,"For the guys with M33-6, yeah, most likely you should update. Nowadays it's pretty painless process, so don't be afraid to. I've heard of a Prometheus addon for M33-6, though, not sure if it will help, cuz my 5.50-D3 doesn't have it and still runs this game.

donatellomartie, i guess i do, though you can find 'em here:
http://thepiratebay.org/search/PSP%20Patapon/0/7/0"
,NitrogenUA,2011-08-24T11:36Z,"D.Coiote, speaking of patching procedure, i use the next one. (you need a psp homebrew called ISO tool to perform it and a PSP, obviously)
1)launch ISO tool, select you game's ISO in the list, press X. In the pop-up menu select 'Decrypt EBOOT'. It'll ask you two questions, with a big deal of safety you can answer 'Yes' to both of 'em. Then wait untill EBOOT is decrypted and replaced."
,NitrogenUA,2011-08-24T11:37Z,"2)after all pop-ups disappear, select you game's ISO again, press X again, and in the pop-up menu select 'Patch Prometheus'.
What patch should we pick? For most games you can use one of the latest patches like 'ME631', '06BETA1' or at least 'prometheus4'. Though, in some cases you should use game-specific patches, like 'KHHBS' or 'DJMAX3JP'."
,Asakato,2011-09-01T13:35Z,Cool game!! I love this game ^^
,Sn0okk,2012-02-20T15:01Z,"i have 5.50 - prime 4 and this doesnt work, when i start the game my psp shuts off? any advice? im a total noob with psp's"
