,Shunnabunich,2011-04-14T16:22Z,"Nice to see this, although I already own the Orange Box so I don't need it myself. What I'd really like to see, though, is Half-Life 1. I still haven't played it, and I'm sure it'd give me a new perspective on the story that comes after it."

,stefanbabics,2011-04-17T00:57Z,"!   C:\Users\Stefan\Desktop\Half Life 2 Collection\Half-Life 2.zip: Cannot create Half-Life 2\Half-Life 2.app\Icon

,stefanbabics,2011-04-17T01:05Z,cant unzip.. Please help?
,Yoss7,2011-04-17T05:19Z,I also can't unzip it. The Unarchiver just says that it can't extract the file.
,Yoss7,2011-04-17T18:39Z,"Well, I downloaded it again, and it still wouldn't unzip with the Unarchiver, but it unzipped just fine with the Mac OS X built-in Archive Utility."
,langweiler94,2011-04-21T16:10Z,"*cough*

This is and will be a cider-port. Being published by a big Publisher doesn't makes the game ""native""

*cough*"
,Ubik328,2011-04-23T21:47Z,"*cough

First do a google search to find out if there is a native version for mac before going off looking like a complete idiot.

*cough"
,DrBlackBeard,2011-04-28T21:12Z,Could use some seeders please =D
,dauberbanaan,2011-05-18T18:09Z,"@langweiler94: It's not a Cider port, but not a good one either. The Source engine uses a dynamic DirectX to OpenGL converter which is buggy and slow as fuck. Cider ports perform better most of the time :("
,dauberbanaan,2011-05-18T18:16Z,"@DrBlackBeard: 1MB/s down here, I don't see your problem."
