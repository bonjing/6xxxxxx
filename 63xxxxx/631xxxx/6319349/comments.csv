,Scofit,2011-04-16T01:01Z,Much thanks man. great job......
,arran13,2011-04-16T02:05Z,THHHANNKYOUUU! SOO MUCHHH!! BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE BEFORE IT CAME OUT!
,rra137,2011-04-16T10:27Z,"Thank you very much !
Wonderful plane."
,Jimstalk,2011-04-16T11:48Z,ive installed the plane but im experiencing some issues.Firstly the rudders dont respond.I tried to takeoff from tncm and taxiing was extremely hard.The only way to make this plane turn normally left of right by using rudders is only by enabling the autorudder option.Secondly the HSI (HORIZONTAL INDICATOR) seems to be  bugged.I made a bang angle of 80 degrees and the HSI didnt react.I added the information to the registry (as you said) but still no luck.Any ideas???
,zkalos,2011-04-16T13:00Z,This is the realistic way of steering this plane on the ground with differential brake. In the config panel in the realism option change the way of steering to linked the rudder from free castoring.
,martronn,2011-04-16T13:05Z,"same to problems here! rudderisworing but am unable to steer while the aircraft i taxing. and my HORIZONTAL INDICATOR stuck like if the aircraft is shutdown. 

gptto be something to do?? maybe its posble to use some gauges from the old prop duke??"

,martronn,2011-04-16T17:49Z,"People. go to you FlightsimulatorX\RealAir\Duke10

you find a setup programthere to fiks the rudder problem!!"
,Zimpilot,2011-04-16T18:23Z,Kickass torrent and a beautiful aircraft - I had the pleasure of flying one out of Johannesburg last month. However I'm experiencing problems too... I am using the program to change the castoring nosewheel to be linked with the rudder but it just isn't applying that to FSX. Any ideas?
,Zimpilot,2011-04-16T18:50Z,"Ok, I think I've found the problem. @jimbob43 You say to add those 2 files to the registry... where can I find the registry?"
,Scofit,2011-04-16T20:32Z,"There is nothing bugged with this great Aircraft. As far as the braking choose either preference, realistic or rudder steering. As far as the the HSI not moving? Just turn your avionics on. Man o man. Thanks again jimbo......"
,Jimstalk,2011-04-16T21:00Z,it has nothing to do with the registry.i fixed the issue with the rudders but another problem occurred.I cant engage the autopilot.....It seems that this torrent is bugged....Im not blaming jimbob but im afraid that the crack doesnt work 100%.Btw the HSI still doesnt move....any kind of help is appreciated
,Jimstalk,2011-04-16T21:06Z,"Ok guys ignore my previous comment.Ive just runned both .reg files with administrator rights and now everything works fine.....

@Scofit

Youre right..I had to turn on the avionics manually,Usually i press ""*"" (avionics master switch in my keyboard) but in this aircraft youll have to do everything manually.Both of my problems are now fixed 

thanks jimbob"
,crcjetty,2011-04-17T03:26Z,where do i find the configuration panel?
,crcjetty,2011-04-17T04:26Z,found it. thanks martronn
,rra137,2011-04-17T17:37Z,"Works perfectly well. I could even add the GPS from Reality :
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5613243/Reality_XP_WX500_and_GNS_WAAS_for_FSX_by_DCrack_--_NEW

If you want to use the GNS gauge with the Realair Duke Turbine
1. Install properly Reality XP (Read DCrack Readme.txt)
2. in the Realair Duke Turbine Config panel
   in Panel Options tick Use Reality XP GNS 530 and/or GNS 430
   Select GNS 530 Layout 1
3. open the 'PANEL.CFG' file in the Duke Turbine Panel folder, by default
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\SimObjects\Airplanes\RealAir Duke Turbine\panel
   erase it, copy the following text and paste it before saving the new 'PANEL.CFG' file.

,lemont1,2011-04-19T01:15Z,"Thanks Martronn for the path to the Configuration Panel... This was not so obvious where it was, as one kind of expects everything to be in the Airplane folder... Everything working fine.  To put the registry files in place, just double click on them one at a time... they insert themselves.... No digging in the registry needed!!  Many thanks to jimbob43 for sharing this.... The Previous Duke was great, but this is just awesome!!"
,lemont1,2011-04-19T01:23Z,"For configuration panel to change steering, open Windows Explorer and navigate to:
C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X\RealAir\duket10  and you will find the blue upside down V config panel... double click and away you go.....  All comms and navigation panels are set to manual by default so you have to turn them on in the cockpit using a little c button next to them or below them."
,heli3,2011-07-17T18:43Z,gut! req: Sibwings cessna Birddog (cracked)
,Crashboy1,2011-07-26T19:31Z,"How do you install the 1.2 update for this? It tells me I don't have the Duke installed. Does it need to be cracked? Will anyone crack it? Or will someone post some proper .reg files for this?

Thanks"
,Crashboy1,2011-07-28T19:41Z,"Anyways... did some digging around. It turns out that you can use 7-zip to extract the files in the setup file. There are two problems with this:

1. You got to use your best judgement as to where all the files should go (I managed to create a working VC).

2. There is no updated config manager that i can find. Without it you got to sort through xml files to access some features.

As i got it sorted out right now:
-I can't change the windscreen texture from dirty to clean;
-landing and taxi lights are still broken if you use an addon light pack;
-I don't really know how to change the panel configurations to accommodate the RXP GNS;
-there's no real access to change options for click zones and the others.

Some things do work, like the mouse wheel control for switches and improved click zones, to name a few.

Either way, i think you'd be better off waiting for someone to properly register the v1.0 installation so the v1.2 update can do it's job properly."
,Crashboy1,2011-07-29T22:43Z,"So i finally figured it out (like anybody cares...). Turns out it's something Win7 64 specific. Here's what to do:

1. Install this package;
2. Go to FSX\simobjects\airplanes\realair duke turbine\ add these to the registry!!!
3. right click duke.reg and then edit
4. modify these lines:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RealAir Simulations]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RealAir Simulations\Turbine Duke]

to read:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\RealAir Simulations]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\RealAir Simulations\Turbine Duke]

5. next go to start menu, and type regedit, and open it
6. go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\RealAir Simulations\Turbine Duke and make sure the install path matches that of your FSX, or else the update won't know where to install the files.
7. Install the 1.2 update as normal."

,Neto420,2011-10-21T10:28Z,THANK YOU JIMBO!
,Neto420,2011-10-22T08:47Z,Oh my god... This shit is just fucking beautiful!!
,ninwhite,2011-10-26T13:53Z,"The Installer will not let me go 'Next' after the Licence Agreement page. The only active options are 'Cancel' and 'Back'.
I would be grateful for any help.
Thanks"
,captray,2012-03-04T19:50Z,"Thanks jimbob43 for the share! Crashboy1, thanks a lot for all the explanations; There is, however, one question that remains unanswered: WHERE DO WE GET THE V1.2 PATCH? Because on realair's website you gotta have an account to download it, and in order to have an account you gotta buy the plane! "
