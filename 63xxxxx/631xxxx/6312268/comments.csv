,Tear_it_up,2011-04-13T02:25Z,The reason for the break is to get higher ratings to end the season and the demographics for the show. Most shows that have a younger demographic take 2 - 3 weeks off for spring breaks and then gear up for a fantastic finale to boost ratings through anticipation through the waiting and previews.
