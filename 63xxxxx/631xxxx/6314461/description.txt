My game review 8/10



The Good

    Believable Pacific theater environments  
    Often-impressive enemy artificial intelligence  
    Some cool verge-of-death moments  
    Solid objective-based multiplayer mode.

The Bad

    Long loading times  
    Some occasionally buggy artificial intelligence  
    System hog--tough to get smooth frame rates out of this one.
