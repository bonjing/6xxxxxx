,armysonx,2011-08-16T19:45Z,"Thanks for the effort, but there are some problems with this.  First I noticed that the track names on Young Lions are incorrect-- they are all off by one track.  Then I noticed that they certainly don't sound like 320kbps, even though iTunes says they are.  I'm no expert on audio encoding, so I don't know what the problem is, but for example, the cymbals sound bad, like on a much lower quality file.  I noticed this on several of the other albums.  In particular I compared this version of Side One to another that I had (which was VBR around 220kbps), and this version was clearly inferior.  I ended up deleting all of them and plan to find them somewhere else.  Also, iTunes says that Car Caught Fire is 192kbps."
