1) This is not my rip, I have only found this into the abyss of Internet, then download it and create the torrent. Credits goes to a person unknown for me.

2) After I have read a note on IMDB, I think this is the Director's Cut version, but I am not sure in 100%.

3) This is absolutely awesome Russian dark futuristic psychedelic/surreal gore story about a serial killer... and his headache. English subs are hardcoded. 

4) Production and special effects (both visual and sound) are truly great (as for the underground movie).

5) Highly recommended to anyone interested in inteligent underground movies, this is not only for gore maniacs.

6) Unfotrunately, I cannot seed 24h/day, so please be patient.


Cheers.
