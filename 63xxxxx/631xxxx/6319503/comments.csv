,shen123,2011-04-16T00:48Z,Anyone know if it works yet?
,apwhitelaw,2011-04-16T02:12Z,"This was released on another site and was said to be working. I usually choose torrents because they are faster, but I was getting over 3MB/s with JDownloader. Then it said I was over my limit, so I had to wait a while and whatnot, and then later it finally started going again at 100kb/s. Would have tried TBP in the first place but it was being really slow. At an average of 800 kb/s which is great because it should stay that way. Gonna be about 2 hours to finish. Then I'll let you all know how it is. There are 92 seeders so obviously people are supporting it. Anyways, seems like a small file, only 6GB compared to usual 7.5 or so, but then again, the first one was probably really small considering it was just one of a few games on The Orange Box. "
,grekpektis,2011-04-16T03:06Z,Does this work without ap 2.5
,apwhitelaw,2011-04-16T03:36Z,"Finished in about 2 1/2 hours I think. I don't remember exactly what my speeds were but I think I had like 1.5 or 2 MB/s. 

Thanks for the seeders, and we already went up 40 seeders since I started downloading. I'm seeding right now, and I'll let you know how it works, since no one else wants to comment. 

As for the above user, probably does not work without AP 2.5. Just update to the latest iXtreme."
,PegLeg86,2011-04-16T05:59Z,"The game works perfect thanks!

There is no AP 2.5 protection on this game... so anyone can play!"
,shehzaan,2011-04-16T11:45Z,@PegLeg86 wat does AP 2.5 protection mean?
,lam4747,2011-04-16T15:19Z,Anyone know how to get this to work with an NME chip? I have used the .DVD associator but the xbox still sees it as a dvd only.
,marcusabu,2011-04-16T15:48Z,works good and the game is epic
,conzeq,2011-04-16T16:46Z,"Works great - thanks!

(Tiny spoiler question):

Has anyone figured out how to solve first puzzle in chapter 4 'The Surprise'? I can't do it :"
,conzeq,2011-04-16T18:28Z,nvm
,pirato_se,2011-04-16T19:38Z,"thanks our lord!
Remember to seed, dont be pussies. Get your ratio to 1.2 thats perfect. Dont be leeching bitches."
,R4INS,2011-04-16T21:00Z,I'm getting 7.0-8.0mbps on this torrent.  Seeding at 2.5-3mbps.  Grabbing the whole thing in 15 minutes :-D.  Will seed the crap out of this 100:1 or so.
,grekpektis,2011-04-17T03:20Z,when I put it in I get x360 logo only.  I tried using abgx but the program said the iso was fine.  
,grekpektis,2011-04-17T03:23Z,How do I upgrade to the lastest iextreme.

,apwhitelaw,2011-04-17T06:01Z,"Worked fine for me. ABGX360 does not verify it because it cannot since it has not been released, so for the above person that was having that problem, just ignore it.

I have been playing offline on a different account to avoid being banned."
,shen123,2011-04-17T09:43Z,anyone played while connected to xbox live?
,privatepartz,2011-04-17T20:09Z,do you need to do something to an xbox to make it play this? like crack it or something? I've never tried using a pirated disc so i don't have the first idea how to...
,freddy147258,2011-04-17T22:02Z,@privatepartz you need to flash your xbox 360 
,freddy147258,2011-04-17T22:03Z,Thanks for the torrent works perfectly. If anybody isnt sure of getting it get it its totally worth it
,grekpektis,2011-04-17T23:26Z,For those who used abgx360 please tell me what firmware you have.  Thats the only reason I can think of that this isn't working
,drphildobaggins,2011-04-18T03:11Z,"Of course AGBX.net doesnt have the patch yet, but my ixtreme xbox was banned when i flashed it because i dont give a shit. 

Works perfectly"
,trilly,2011-04-18T19:56Z,Anyone know how to get it to work? Keeps on saying its a dvd movie. Other backups do work.
,qartvel,2011-04-18T20:03Z,"good..will check it soon.
thanks goes to uploader!"
,lakaikindaguy,2011-04-19T03:46Z,"You people are retarted. 

Verification fails if the game hasnt come out yet. Play offline

You cannot play this unless you have a dvd+r dl disk because it wont fit

Your xbox must be flashed to play a pirated game.

Dont play until release date because you will get banned.

Dont ask stupid questions idiots -_-"
,coolguymandude,2011-04-19T03:54Z,burned this and i got the open tray message over and over but it finally works lol
,johndabomb44,2011-04-19T07:02Z,"@ coolguymandude

I'm having the same problem with my xbox, it will just say open tray. Are you using Lt 1.1+? that's what I'm using and it still wont work."
,BogeyMaster,2011-04-19T20:04Z,TOTALY WORKING!DONT GO THE FUCK ONLINE UL GET BANED !!!! THX THE LOT :D D:D

,babbleM,2011-09-20T01:43Z,this worked great on the first burn! thank u - now seeding!
,Nath14,2012-05-31T12:35Z,**People downloading it now IT WORKS just remember to re patch with abgx360
,Xinthose,2012-06-03T04:32Z,so I got the open tray error as well; do you really have to flash your hard drive in order to play this?  I used abgx360 1.0.6; no amount of opening and closing the tray or banging on the back part of the 360 helped it
