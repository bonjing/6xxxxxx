             Elements of War - is a modern MMORTS, with a single-player   
             campaign included, set in the post-apocalyptic world that    
             has suffered a global technological disaster. The failed     
             tests of experimental climate weaponry completely            
             destroyed Washington, D.C., burying the government of the    
             United States under ruins. This caused a sequence of         
             ecological disasters all over the world and was also the     
             reason the European Expeditionary Corps were sent to the     
             USA torn apart by warring military forces. The story of      
             Elements of War will unfold gradually over the 12 missions   
             of the single-player campaign, in which you will command     
             the joint forces of Russia, Germany, France and USA.         
             Having completed the single-player campaign, you may go      
             online and choose one of the two warring sides, former       
             allies, fighting in a new conflict. You will engage in       
             thrilling battles enriched by highly detailed gameplay       
             animations, realistic particle physics and dynamic weather   
             that will affect gameplay directly. You will be able to      
             play as Russia or the USA in 10 types of PVE missions,       
             fighting marauder gangs swarming the land. To aid you,       
             there will be over 25 upgrades of military hardware, which   
             includes both existing units and futuristic weather          
             elementals and quite a lot more.
