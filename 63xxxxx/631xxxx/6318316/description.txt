Legendary blues guitarist BB King named Peter Green as one of the greatest exponents of
the blues, and the 'only guitar player to make me sweat'. If Green had only written Black
Magic Woman, his name would still have a place in blues rock history forever.

His three short years leading Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac saw the band established as one
of the biggest-selling groups of the 1960s. Yet at the height of their fame Green left the group,
with his life spiralling into turmoil as drug-induced mental health issues took control. Rumours
of his demise began to spread, and sightings of him became notorious.

After years battling his mental illness, Green is writing and recording again. Featuring archive
performances and interviews with Carlos Santana, Noel Gallagher, founding members of
Fleetwood Mac and Green himself, this film tells the story of one of blues rock's living
legends.
