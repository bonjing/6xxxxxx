,hootieman,2011-04-14T12:30Z,Does this have hard coded subs? all the other releases subtitles fail at the italian speaking parts
,the_comrade,2011-04-14T12:30Z,"great work, many thanks"
,the_comrade,2011-04-14T12:32Z,Does this have the english subs?
,theoriginalphantom,2011-04-14T12:38Z,Where did the other comments go?
[V],extremezone,2011-04-14T13:03Z,"from what i've seen on release sites seems this encode by arrow doesn't have hardcoded subs for italian speaking parts , so wait and check rlslog for a subfix/or better version bigger than 1gb wich i will upload it when will be available"

,Karayan,2011-04-16T00:54Z,"Thanks for the up, extremezone."
,jager963,2011-04-16T03:09Z,"Thanks Extremezone, keep doing what youre doing man. your ups are consistantly awesome."
,jzenman,2011-04-16T05:00Z,I'll vouch for Karayan's link. You need the English subs for just the non-English parts. I used his link and it worked great. Not a bad movie for a horror flick.   
,NASHD,2011-04-16T10:21Z,"thanks Karayan

,Count_Alucard,2011-04-17T00:39Z,"May i ask a favour? Im after a movie called one night stand staring Wesley Snipes.Its not available in Australia,only in the USA. Any help is greatly appreciated."
,5212justin,2011-04-17T01:00Z,hi could someone please help me i have downloaded the film and the subs from karayan's link but how do you get the subs to work with the film? many thanks.
,Manderz,2011-04-17T05:43Z,By far one of the fasts DLs I've ever experienced on PB and uT. Thanks for the FLAWLESS quality and the small file size. 
,Karayan,2011-04-17T08:46Z,"@5212justin - I use VLC player, its free to download, make sure the sub and movie are in same folder. For burning, i use converxtodvd, when using that it helps if you have sub & movie named the same or else you'll have to point the program to the subs location. Cheers, hope this helps."
,jimstarooney,2011-05-01T22:24Z,can i play this on an xbox with a flashdrive iv downloaded the vlc player cos iv read theres a lot of subtitles in this film will vlc work on my x box iv been using divx which is the best quality player? many thanks x
,tabbyann22,2011-05-23T08:53Z,i have the same problem i play movies on my xbox with a flash drive can i do that with the subtitles?
,krazyfeline82,2011-06-12T02:36Z,Cool movie excellent quality. Thanx Arrow your one of the best. 
,xMajesticMeteorx,2011-06-30T19:44Z,I heard it sucked.  But I bet it's better than Inception.
