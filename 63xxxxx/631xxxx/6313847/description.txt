The dynamic rock group KISS makes its feature film debut in a spine-tingling mystery that matches KISS's extra-ordinary powers against a demented genius inventor. Peter Criss (Cat Man), Ace Frehley (Space Ace), Gene Simmons (The Demon) and Paul Stanley (Star Child), collectively known as KISS, are scheduled for a sell-out concert at California's Magic Mountain amusement park when park-goers begin to vanish without a trace. Behind it all is Abner Devereaux (Anthony Zerbe), the eccentric creator of the park's life-like cybernetic creatures. When Melissa (Deborah Ryan) turns to KISS to help her find her missing boyfriend, Devereaux feels threatened and creates cybernetic KISS look-alikes! Featured is some of KISS's best music performed with stunning visual effects!


I could only find poorly transferred versions of this movie on torrent sites, with small resolutions and audio/video sync issues. The DVD version of this movie on Amazon.com is noted as a bootleg according to feedback. So I decided to transfer my original VHS to DVD and add menus. Enjoy! -gF 4/2011
