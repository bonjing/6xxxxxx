    It's the last few days of the school term and Alastair     
    Campbell has managed to get the Dream School kids         
    invited to Downing Street to put their points about      
    education to the Prime Minister, David Cameron. But       
    should he take 16-year-old Angelique, who swore at him     
    and stormed out of his class?                             
                                                             
    Andrew Motion, the former poet laureate, concludes his    
    poetry course with a special event for the kids'           
    friends and parents. Will his decision to persevere       
    with the kids after his tumultuous early lessons be      
    vindicated?                                               
                                                               
    There's an end-of-term test from Professor Robert         
    Winston and a sports day challenge against a local       
    school, masterminded by Olympic gold medal-winner Daley   
    Thompson.                                                  
                                                              
    At Downing Street, Alastair Campbell introduces the      
    students to David Cameron, the man who could do most to   
    help their generation. But will they use the               
    opportunity to get their message across?                  
                                                             
    And as the young people leave Dream School, Jamie wants   
    them to have proof of what they've achieved. So as well    
    as producing portfolios of their work and achievements,   
    he asks four of his top teachers - Rankin, Alastair      
    Campbell, Jazzie B and David Starkey - to give all the    
    kids a final assessment.
