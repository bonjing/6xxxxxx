Features:
â€¢ Tabbed Browsing: have an unlimited number of tabs to make jumping around between folders a one-click affair. Rename the tabs, shift them around, hide them, drag-drop stuff onto the tab headers... the tabs remember their configuration individually and between sessions. You often search your system for files added in the last 24 hours? Let a "finding tab" do the job at a single click!
â€¢ High end find files engine with tremendous power and amazing speed. Find files fully supports Boolean logic (up to 256 nesting levels), advanced pattern matching, Regular Expressions, whole word and fuzzy matching, binary string search, multiple location search (find files in all selected directories) and much more...
