Game information
=================

In Wildlife Park 3 the player becomes a  modern  animal  park  manager.  In
Campaign mode, 20 missions take him around the globe and set  him  a  range
of exciting and varied challenges. The player's imagination  can  run  riot
in the ever popular "free game" mode: the virtual wildlife park manager has
over 40 plant species, a range of  visitor  facilities,  numerous  building
options for enclosures and many more elements available to design and build
his own park. Of course he must also consider the needs of the 25 different
animal species and must hire and train animal keepers  to  look  after  the
animals  and  their  offspring.  Randomly  generated  quests  also  provide
variety nor should the "cute factor" be ignored in Wildlife Park 3 either

A number of innovations have made Wildlife Park 3 the most  successful  and
thrilling part of the series to date, as the management part  of  the  game
has been substantially  upgraded  compared  to  its  predecessor,  and  the
numerous park facilities  and  enclosure  types  can  now  be  individually
designed. The behavior and movements of the  various  animal  species  have
been faithfully reproduced and of course the  popular  animal  lexicon  has
been retained, which, besides the animal species,  also  contains  lots  of
background information on plant  species.  A  new  weather  system  affects
animals, plants and visitors alike: animals run for shelter in a  downpour,
plants wither if it is too dry, and visitors can quickly  buy  an  umbrella
in the park shop if it starts raining. An improved clothing system provides
a vast selection of different dress styles for the NPCs, each of whom will
have different requirements that must be satisfied
