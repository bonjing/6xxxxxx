Bopup Communication Server version 3.3.25.9259
Corporate instant messaging server for secure business communications
========================================================================

[OVERVIEW]

Bopup Communication Server is an instant messaging server for private IM, 
internal chat and secure collaboration over corporate and business 
networks. It provides Active Directory support and integration, message 
and file archiving, offline messaging and document distribution with 
a strong encryption of transmitted data. The server offers various 
authentication modes to accept user connections, manages user groups 
from a single place, supports and handles easy and very effective 
distribution of documents and important events from the IM server to 
employees and users.

Since the communication server is designed for business and 
enterprise-level environments it is intended to install and organize 
a private and internal chat system and real-time communication platform 
for companies with no outside access too. Bopup Communication Server is 
easy and fast to set up which takes about few minutes to get completed. 
It comes with embedded SQL server to host it's database or can be 
installed using an existing MS SQL Server software.

The communication server includes a built-in functionality to upgrade 
IM client software with uploading new versions of the messengers on the 
server. End-user messaging applications can be also distributed and 
deployed with pre-installed settings and options that reduces 
an overall time of software setup. And the IM client branding feature 
lets upload company's image, logotype on the communication server and 
show it in the messengers interface. It is highly important for 
companies and organizations that want to get their messaging software 
in a single corporate style.


Key features:

SEDURE AND PRIVATE COMMUNICATION
All transmitted messages and files are encrypted with strong encryption 
algorithms based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and CAST-128 
algorithms. That is the first and primary way to make corporate 
and business IM safe and secure. 

AUTHENTICATION MODES
The server supports various modes to authenticate and authorize 
connected users. Choose the best way for your corporate and business 
infrastructure from the available authentication modes: Simple, Windows 
Authentication (SSPI) and Private login/password.

MESSAGING GROUPS
The centralized management of user groups makes it possible to organize 
a flexible IM structure with a list of assigned groups and 
send/receive-only permissions set for each user. 

USER ONLINE STATUS
Online statuses allow users to see the current status of each user in 
their Contact List, i.e. Online, Away, Offline/Not available and control 
their own status. 

CONTACT LIST ACCESS
Users can organize personal Contact Lists and access them from any 
workplace and location. Users are informed if there are new contacts 
available on the IM server and if they can be added to their Contact 
Lists. 

OFFLINE FILE TRANSFER AND URGENT MESSAGING
Enable message exchange and file transfer even if some users are 
currently not available. Offline messages and files are automatically 
delivered by the IM server to the recipient when the latter goes online. 
Send urgent messages for high-priority tasks and notifications. 

FILE DISTRIBUTION
Easy, managed and secure distributing files and directories to client 
workstations. Important documents can be assigned and delivered to users 
from the server in a fully automated mode with a set of advanced flags. 

TERMINAL SERVER SUPPORT
The client software fully supports the Terminal Server, Citrix 
environments and the Windows XP Fast User Switching feature. Users can 
communicate even if they are connected to the same server via Terminal 
Client sessions or have open logon sessions on the same computer 
simultaneously. 

CONFIRMATION MODE
Activate the Confirmation Mode which pops up the client messenger when 
a message is received and keeps it on top of other windows until the 
user clicks the Confirm Message button. That is the best way to attract 
users' attention. 

CENTRALIZED NOTIFICATION
Send notifications and urgent messages and keep users updated on any 
events and information. These messages are automatically delivered by 
the server at the scheduled time at the specified intervals. 

MESSAGE AND TRANSFER LOGGING & ARCHIVING
Browse, search and view the entire message and file transfer archives. 
Print information for any period and for any person. 

INSTANT IM CLIENT UPDATES
The messaging clients can be instantly updated from the central IM 
server. This feature allows to keep IM client versions up-to-date and 
deploy new software updates and patches in a completely automated way 
without having to manually install it on all user computers.

ACTIVE DIRECTORY (LDAP) SUPPORT
Import user accounts from a global catalog and create the local users 
database on the server within a few seconds. Import accounts by choosing 
different criterias: by Organizational Units (OU) or by Groups. 
The server also provides integration options with a directory and can 
search and import accounts "on-the-fly" when new users connect.

ACCESS FROM A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE
Control the communication server and send messages directly from 
a command line interface. Send scheduled and instant messages to users 
and groups from third-party applications, scripts or batch files.

server. Just go through the steps of the Setup Wizard and get your IM 
system running in a few minutes.
