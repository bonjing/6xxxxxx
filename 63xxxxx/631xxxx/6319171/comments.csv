[V],wushdishmeen,2011-04-16T07:33Z,"Wrap Up is fixed but you need to join WDM network to get it because I'm not going to reseed the whole torrent just for that since it's such a small file.

It hasn't happened before this once though because I didn't start using the software I'm using now until just a week ago."
