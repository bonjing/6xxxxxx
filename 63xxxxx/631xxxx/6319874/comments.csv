,Drewbie1,2011-04-16T03:05Z,this torrent doesnt technically werk ....the tracker doesnt really exist ....instead its all about dht babay ...yeah ...so my client requires a tracker (and I give it one ...) but supports decentralized tracking ...which as i understand is the preference at this point so just throwing it out there to support dht/decentralized tracking whenever possible 
,Drewbie1,2011-04-16T03:26Z,you do know you dont have to wait for torrents to be complete before using them right .....Im just saying their are 12 files but you can watch any of them as soon as that particular file is complete...regardless of the rest... you can reposition priority so 12 is done first if u want
