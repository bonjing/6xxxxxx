,Too_Long,2011-04-12T17:54Z,DO NOT UPDATE TO 6.38
,tehteh123,2011-04-12T19:30Z,do not update to 6.37...
,Too_Long,2011-04-12T20:00Z,@tehteh123 I meant that if you have 6.37. But 6.38 seemed to be ok too. Sony cannot block their key for demos. Of course having 6.35 is ideal now. But having 6.37 is not the worlds end too: several nice games we can run free of charge :)

I was just wondering, in the EBOOT folder, what should you call the files. It only acccepts mine when they are called ""EBOOT""(.PBP) but i can't call more than one file the same name.

Would really appriciate a answer, and thanks for the upload, it works perfectly(I just can't manage to make all og them to work at the same time)."
