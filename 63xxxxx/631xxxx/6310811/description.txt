My musical education started at the feet of Sonny Terry and Brownie Mcgee at my gradeschool in 1956. My style runs through Delta, Piedmont, Rags, Ballads and Folk Blues. I listen to the recordings of the best players and steal licks and morph them into my own tunes and versions of acoustic blues classics. I have performed and taught at the PORT TOWNSEND BLUES FEST, and travel the US playing solid solo acoustic country blues. ~TDC
