,R780G,2011-06-04T03:23Z,"@arnu109,

I just tried to connect to a server and it says that I can't because it's using different protocol. How do I fix this?

Also, when I launch hlds.exe it says ""unable to load engine, image is corrupt"". 

Any ideas?"
,arnu109,2011-06-04T12:57Z,"R780G =>> That server you were connecting is fully steam'ed and on connection to that server your steamID is validated at steam's database.

And about that error, when do you get it, and where?

I'm using this install also, and no errors at startup or in console"

,aleskidash,2012-06-18T03:08Z,"Don't use Ciemnozielony's crack, he's advertising something dangerous. I can confirm this works installs and works perfectly fine on XP SP3. It uses a standard Clickteam installer which can be popular among quite the amount of torrents. I haven't known it to set off any false positives, but if it does that would be why.

I have a small suspicion that it UNINTENTIONALLY might fuck with your actual steam installation if you install it to the default folder (I may be paranoid) so just put it somewhere else and you're good

This works much better then the 1000+ seeders one because the top CS 1.6 torrent uses keybindings that makes your player spam messages every time you move using the WASD keys. Get this one, it works out of the box.

Hell, this game even works on the shittiest of graphics cards on software mode. 

Just add -dxlevel 80 (or 70 for directx 7) to the Counter Strike shortcut. This works with a lot of source games as well like portal and left 4 dead
