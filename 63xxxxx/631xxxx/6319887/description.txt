None of the files I will be uploading are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
I got fed up with the poor quality of a lot of Disney cartoons I downloaded,
and decided to do something about it. All have been re-encoded 
and cleaned up. No attempt has been made to "shrink" the file sizes.
All have custom menus using part of the original menus where possible.
I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

This is a 2 disc set

This disc, Vol. 1 combines D1 and D2 for the years 1930 - 1947 and has 
26 episodes

"Extras", some commentary and drawings have been deleted.The main intro 
has NOT been re encoded

Enjoy
