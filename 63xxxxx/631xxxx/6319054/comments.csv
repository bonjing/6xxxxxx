,thespike,2011-04-18T10:43Z,Its a good torrent for sure..Good quality..V10 A9..It had security on it so it cant be burned to a dvd which is a bummer..I like to watch movies on my surround sound system and this is the first movie that i cant convert to a dvd or even an avi file...Its very watchable and good if u just want to watch it on your computer because thats all you can do with it...If anyone has any suggestions on how to convert it to a dvd then id love to hear it...Cheers dudes...Happy viewing :)
