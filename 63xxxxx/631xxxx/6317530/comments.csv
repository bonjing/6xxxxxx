I truly wonder about the quality, will give rating soon (when it is in, and seen).
Though PLEASE try to sty AT LEAST above 1.2 gb..."
,Wrykolaz,2011-04-14T13:14Z,"I have checked the movie.
I run my monitor at 1600x1200, and the movie is a slight tad foggy, probably because of the  high-rez setting.
Despite this:
V:9
A: 9

KNOW THIS: I am a very critical viewer.
To less critical viewers:
V: a FAT 10
A: a FAT 10

The vidsize (a miserable 700 mb) takes the real good edge from the whole.
The less the size, the less the quality.
This movie will however be nearly perfect on lower rezzes...

Thank you, sceneline."
