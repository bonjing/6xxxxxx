From the Infowars web site ::

As the price of gas continues its unprecedented ascent through the stratosphere, Alex talks with pastor Lindsey Williams, who has revealed a plan by the globalists to take oil to $200 a barrel, devalue the dollar, and destroy the United States. 

Alex also talks with investigative journalist and former National Security Agency consultant Wayne Madsen about threats made on his life. Earlier this month, Madsen received word from a source in a foreign intelligence agency allied with the United States that the Obama White House wants him killed. "It was perfectly clear that the phrase was not being used as a figure of speech," writes Madsen.

Today's show went five minutes into a 4th hour to finish the Wayne Madsen interview.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as
 information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement 
 of the contents.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
