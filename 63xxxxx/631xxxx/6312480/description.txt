Logan's.Run.1976.(DD5.1).DivX-NvadR 
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/
      
In the year 2274, after the world has been decimated by a holocaust, 
a new society is built and resides in a domed city. However, it is 
forbidden for humans to live beyond 30 and you are given two choices, 
either to go through a ritual called Carousel with the promise of being 
"renewed", or go on the run and risk being hunted down by an elite police 
force known as Sandmen. Logan 5 is just such a man, and when he and his 
partner Francis 7 find and kill a runner, Logan takes an ankh symbol which 
identifies a person as a runner. When the computers of the city find out 
that Logan is in possession of the amulet, they order him to go undercover 
and find Sanctuary, the place where all the runners go to live out the rest 
of their lives. To ensure this, the computer adds four years to the time 
crystal on his palm to make it appear that he is on the verge of turning 30. 
Logan then meets up with Jessica 6, a member of the underground group that 
helps runners escape to Sanctuary. Logan then begins to run, but in the 
process realizes that there is much to live for and that he is just 
entering the prime of his life.
