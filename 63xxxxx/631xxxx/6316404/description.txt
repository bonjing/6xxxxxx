Recorded live at the Adelaide Festival Centre in South Australia, 
this production displays the magical partnership between Christine Walsh and Kelvin Coe 
who between them danced as guest artists with companies as diverse as the Bolshoi Ballet, 
the American Ballet Theatre and Sydney Dance Company.

Review:
This is an excellent production, with Walsh on fine form, with a delicious 'mad scene', and a truly impressive second act. Coe was up to the task, but his dark costumes rendered him almost invisible at times, and certainly didn't do justice to his performance. 
The drama was emphasised by the fine orchestration, and the camera work and direction for television was excellent.

The Production:
The lighting appears poor, with the first act looking brown and drab, the second looking very grey; this may be a feature of the DVD - it may be that the lighting worked well for the stage.
