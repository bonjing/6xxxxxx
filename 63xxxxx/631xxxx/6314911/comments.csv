,wullie7362,2011-04-13T05:35Z,There is nothing evil about cannabis!
,jiveclive,2011-04-13T10:03Z,"Wullie is right of course. Cannabis good, can of piss bad. "
,PhiberOptix,2011-04-17T16:30Z,"Cannabis is like a knife. It can be good. It can be bad. There is a danger that even if you use it for good it might end up hurting you.
This documentary is taking both sides in to perspective. It shows people with high anxiety disorder who uses cannabis to calm the neveres. It also shows people who has developed schizofrenia during use of cannabis at a young age.
It shows both sides. Something that should piss off most people. As those in favour of cannabis don't want to hear or see any critisism of cannabis. And those against it don't want to know it has any good uses.

I see it for what it is, just another tool that might hurt you, no matter how you use it. So unless you really need it, don't play with it."
