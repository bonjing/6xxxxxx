I could not help but notice there was really not much out here on this Kansas City based R&B group. Many older R&B enthusiast will know about them. I put this as a discography but its really more of a compilation because I did not include their later stuff. I will try to get that up there soon. 

Albums included:

Natural High 1973
Unreal 1973
go on and cry 1999
ultimate collection
