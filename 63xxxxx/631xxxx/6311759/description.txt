         Could Jack the Ripper have been the world's first             
         trans-Atlantic serial killer? Can 21st century techniques     
         and CGI 3-D autopsies crack this 19th century crime           
         spree, while reversing decades of investigative               
         assumptions? Retired U.K. murder squad detective Trevor       
         Marriott is determined to finally unmask the Ripper and       
          possibly link him to other murders in Europe and the U.S.
