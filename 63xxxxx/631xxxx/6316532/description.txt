The perverted little tale begins with a schoolbus stopping to the side
of the road. Lolita, played by Tammy, walks out of the bus as the really
catchy theme song plays, "Lalalalalalolita nice to everybody she meets,
She was young and didn't know yet not to love everybody she met, She
thought if she refused them that meant that she would lose them..." And
yes they plastered a line at the bottom of the screen right away to
alert you to the fact that "All performers are over the age of 18" (well
my mind can think anything it wants - nanny nanny boo boo!). Lolita is
walking in the woods to go home when her friend, Tigr- played by Chelsea
Manchester, walks with her and they hold hands (it is so cute!). You see
Tigr fo to her home and she finds her mom and dad doin the missionary
shuffle as she watches from behind a plant with amazement. The mom jerks
off the dad onto her chest but dad just can't get enough so he does more
missionary swingin and then to anal her doggystyle. He cums again and
this time on her back. Tigr starts rubbin her special private area over
her jeans.
