,salamlaith,2011-05-06T22:58Z,very very very nice program
,salamlaith,2011-05-06T22:59Z,audio works with WMP
,srikantk,2011-08-20T09:06Z,"Wonderful Show! Great Quality!

A=10
V=10

Audio will not work in VLC. Try WMP instead."
,QborT,2012-04-05T05:24Z,"The guy above that gave this a 10/10 is delusional, the quality sucks.  Heavily pixelated and doesn't look good at all, plus the fact that it doesn't have audio with vlc and the subs are hardcoded. Booo!!!. :(

I knew I shouldn't have wasted my time on this smaller encode (smaller encodes always suck).  Fucking waste of bandwidth.  I know some people like smaller encodes, but personally I think they are for amateurs."
