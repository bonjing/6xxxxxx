groet miepje 2"
,willemco,2011-04-30T03:55Z,"Agree with miepje2 but why is there no link AFTER the download process has finished that takes you back to the up loader to encourage placing a comment? Sometimes I can't even find back the original file because 5-6 days may have passed before my download has completed...
Often want to place a comment but give up as it's like looking for a needle in a hay stack."
