,oldtimer48,2011-08-11T05:53Z,"Sample A/10, V/10, according to other comment Icelandic or Viking dialogue is very limited and the remainder of the movie is in English, appears to be an excellent copy, thanks for sharing. I don't think it is an XXX movie, tags perhaps Action, Historical, Drama, I don't think the movie was ever banned??"
,oldtimer48,2011-08-12T05:32Z,"A/10, V/10, Birdsand is wrong there are working English subs stream for the whole movie including English / Nordic / Viking speaking parts which is great for the hearing impaired. The Audio is awesome, and the video crystal clear. TheFalcon007, you are very talented, keep up the good work, you are appreciated. Thanks for sharing"
