Hitman: Codename 47 is the first canonical entry in the Hitman series of video games. Developed by the Danish IO Interactive in Denmark and released by Eidos Interactive, in 2000 for Microsoft Windows, it remains the only PC-exclusive Hitman game. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is its sequel.

The story centers around Agent 47, a bald test subject branded with a barcode tattooed on the back of his head, who is rigorously trained in methods of murder. Upon escaping from a test facility, 47 is hired by the Agency, a European contract killing organization. His mission takes him to several locationsâ€”Hong Kong, Colombia, Hungary, and the Netherlandsâ€”to assassinate wealthy and decadent criminals.
