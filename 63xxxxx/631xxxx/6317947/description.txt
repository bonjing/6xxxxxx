*Note1: Bonus track "Give" included. This track was a bonus download, or iTunes 
 bonus.

**Note2: Singles include only the content that is unique to the single, in other 
  words, no duplicated tracks. The other tracks are just elsewhere in this discog.

***Note3: Not the 3 track version that was a best buy bonus, but the 5 track version, the 5 include the 3 from Best Buy bonus disc, and is the whole session. The 5 track also came with the deluxe of "Live In Cuba"

****Note4: Not to be confused with the self-titled DVD-EP, the difference is it contained the 3 videos they had made so far, and 2 live tracks, the same 2 live tracks are on this 4 track EP.

#Note5: Only 1 track here, the rest are already here, or not available (at least in my searching)

Enjoy!

PS. Please help seed this well, as some of this came from very poorly seeded/tracked torrents. And while this upload isn't all mine, I believe I'm the 1st to put it all together.

Thanks to CanadaJoe for the BBC track that was hard to find.
