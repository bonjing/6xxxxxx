,ProudFather,2011-04-14T07:11Z,"aXXodudez stop spamming us about your crappy site,I went there to check it out,Once i could get past the pop`ups,i tried downloading a torrent and My AVG told me it detected a trojan,I tried another and it worked,But it was a torrent from one of the other known names..lol
All you have done is taken other people`s torrents probably from here..lol.
and then you use the Axxo name to get the people that are not smart enough to know better.
Your site is Crap,And i advise everyone to keep away."

,Frice,2011-04-21T04:22Z,"All the negativity in the comments (well most of it) makes you think this movie is a wash. It actually isn't.

It has character development, intrigue, a subplot as well as an epic perfomance by Mr. Zane.

Im giving the film 7.5/10.
If you are in the drama movie crowd this isn't for you and the sex-scene is skippable (thats why I download!).

Overall a decent action flick especially for military buffs although some of the soldiers in the marines really were unbelievable as they lacked any muscle and obvious signs of intensity that only a bootcamp and a few years in combat can provide.

Thanks for the upload e-zone."

Probably the dumbest action flick I've seen since Flight of Fury. The actors actually tried to make the movie work but the screenwriters and technical advisors were on crack. Anyway thanks for the rip, you are the best."

,DevilNuts,2011-06-07T10:47Z,"@ Frice:

""...Overall a decent action flick especially for military buffs...""

Couldn't be farther from the truth, unless you are talking about the broke-dick (""I was gonna join, but I have a broken vagina, etc"") arm-chair chicken-shit, know-nothing 'historian' wannabes. 

Fun Fact of the day: Most real servicemen watch movies like this and immediately begin picking apart the inaccuracies, to the point of distraction - if there are too many, the movie is simply unenjoyable. This is one of those movies. 

For Marines specifically, proper wear of the uniform is emphasized to the point where any discrepancies on-screen, which would be invisible to the civilian viewer, stand out like a glowing beacon of shittiness. If the story and acting are good enough, small inconsistencies can be overlooked (A Few Good Men) and the movie may still be enjoyed. This is not one of those movies. 

If you want to see a movie that won't make a real Marine cringe with embarrassment, watch Battle Los Angeles (The obvious two exceptions are the prolific usage of the word ""lieutenant"" by enlistedmen - it is simply ""Sir,"" and the spelling out of ""F.O.B."" which is called a FOB (rhymes with ""knob.))

/rant. 

Thanks for the upload, and hopefully *somebody* is able to enjoy this floating turd of a movie. "
