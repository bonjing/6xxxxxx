Boxed Set, released on 7 September 1990 is a boxed set of the English rock group Led
Zeppelin's popular songs digitally remastered, on six vinyl albums, four compact discs, and
four cassette formats. Compilation and remastering of the tracks took place in New York
during early-to-mid 1990. A 30-page booklet was included for the vinyl and CD releases.

This boxed set contains two previously-unreleased tracks and a new mix. "Travelling
Riverside Blues" was recorded on 24 June 1969 at the BBC Maida Vale Studio. "White
Summer" was recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, London on 27 June 1969. The "Moby
Dick"/"Bonzo's Montreux" mix took place at the Atlantic Synclavier Suite in New York, in May
1990.

To differentiate this release from the future Remasters box sets, some world recording
industry associations have listed this under the title The Complete Collection (not to be
confused with the later 1993 release The Complete Studio Recordings).


"In an interview he gave in January 2010, Page made reference to the Boxed Set"

Oh, I'm now fully aware of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My
awareness was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set
in 1990. When you hear it all, song after song, you realise what a textbook it is for musicians
who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because
that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly
records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone
carries the flame on..
