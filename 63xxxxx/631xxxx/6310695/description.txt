BBC The Great Rift Africas Wild Heart 3of3 HDTV x264 AC3 MVGroup 2010

Series investigating the geological forces which shaped East Africa's Great Rift Valley and which make it one of the world's most wildlife-rich landscapes.

Part 3. Grass.
The valley provides the stage for an epic battle between trees and grass - its course influenced by volcanic eruptions, landscape and rainfall. On its outcome rests the fate of Africa's great game herds. In the Rift's savannas, grazers and their predators struggle to outwit each other, forcing one group of primates to develop a social system that paved the way for the evolution of mankind.
