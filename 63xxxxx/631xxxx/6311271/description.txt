Ripped from the new live stream from Glenn Beck's web site. I have edited out the  music played during the commercial breaks.

NOTE: Somebody screwing up at Mercury.  For the first break on each hour they played a commercial over the live show on the web broadcast.  I cut out the bad stuff and returned at the clear part.  You'll hear a scratch to indicate what I'm talking about.
