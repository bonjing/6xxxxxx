        Some may claim the title, some may think that they were the 
        originators but historic facts show that there's only one true 
        Godfather of Hardcore: Paul Elstak. With the start up of his label
        Rotterdam Records back in 1992 and unleashing his first release 
        under the Euromasters guise, Paul Elstak subconsciously created 
        the future for a whole new music genre, soon to be known as 
        hardcore. By steering the Rotterdam Records label in the direction 
        of worldly fame, Paul Elstak rapidly became the personification 
        of hardcore, copied by many but hardly equaled.

        As the inventor of the genre, Paul Elstak brought hardcore music 
        to the masses by developing a new event phenomenon and named it 
        A Nightmare in Rotterdam, nowadays known as Nightmare. With 
        infamous editions in the Energiehal in Rotterdam, Paul Elstak 
        created a tremendous group of hardcore fanatics and loyal visitors 
        of all Nightmare events to come. As the patron of hardcore and the
        creator of the Nightmare events, it was evident that Paul Elstak 
        would create his own Nightmare on a double CD sooner or later.

        Nightmare - Create The Future is Paul Elstak's personal blueprint 
        of how a Nightmare event should be portrayed. Similar to the 
        Nightmare event on the 4th of December 2010 in Ahoy' Rotterdam, 
        this Nightmare compilation is divided in two "areas": present 
        hardcore and early rave. CD1 showcases the very best of the current 
        scene, selecting furious tracks from the Paul Elstak lab such as The
        Evolution Of Hate, I'm Not An Addict and God's Will (under his 
        The Hitmen alias) and from icons such as Dione, DJ Partyraiser, 
        Tommyknocker, Tieum, Dano and many more. This first disc even 
        contains no less than three official Nightmare 2010 anthems!

        The second disc offers the very best of the past and considering 
        Paul Elstak's rank in hardcore history, who better than the man 
        who rocked the hardcore cradle to pick 'n choose the early rave 
        gems? An eighteen track travel through hardcore times offering 
        tracks from DJ Isaac, DJ J.D.A., Shadowlands Terrorists, Frankfurt 
        Terror Corps and Bodylotion amongst others, accompanied by Paul 
        Elstak classics marking the absolute hardcore milestones of 
        far-from-forgotten times.

        Sorry for all the fans, but no Turbo on it!

        Enjoy!
