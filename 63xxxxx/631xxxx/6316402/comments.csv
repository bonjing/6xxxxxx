The film begins with a mysterious old woman (Philip Friedman) near an ominously lit back window. She smiles and then the screen flashes to black.

A couple, Renai and Josh Lambert (Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson), and their three kids have recently moved into a new house. One morning, Renai begins looking through a family photo album. Her son, Dalton (Ty Simpkins), joins her. He asks why there are no pictures of Josh when he was a child, which Renai reasons that he has always been camera shy. After Dalton tells Renai he is scared of his new room, she calms him down and stacks a few books on a nearby shelf. Later, after finding those books laying on the floor, Renai tells Dalton to put them back after he looks at them, but Dalton claims that he didn't touch them. Sometime later, as Dalton is playing, he hears noises in the attic and goes to investigate. He steps on an old ladder to turn on the light when it breaks, causing Dalton to fall. He starts screaming after looking at a shadowy corner. Renai and Josh help him, then tuck him into bed, confident he only took a minor spill and scared himself. The next day Josh goes to wake Dalton, but he doesn't move. They rush him to the hospital where the doctors say he is in an unexplained coma. 3 months later, still in a coma, they bring Dalton home to care for him there."
