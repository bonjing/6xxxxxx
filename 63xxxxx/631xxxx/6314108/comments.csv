,cojon,2012-02-07T09:48Z,"Exceptional software!!! Many Thanks to F.O.S.I.  I have been getting at your small assortment of files for probably 8 years now!

For F.O.S.I., EASEUS and everyone....   I just recovered all but six files on a two Terabyte disk that was only lacking about 100GB of being full! 

Buy this software!  It is the absolute best I have seen!  I picked up several new 1TB drives to recover this 2TB drive to. I struggled for days with other recovery software--I got nothing useful. 

Then I tried EASEUS and it pulled all but a few files back!  It was not fast, taking a bit over 31 hours and knowledge of what I was doing, but I have the greatest share of my data back. It was psychological research data, and to me, priceless! 

If you take your time, insure you know what you are doing first by a bit of online work to comprehend disk structure, formatting, NTSF, or Linux EXT3 formatting and all that sort of technical info, have a working disk, and you recover to a different partition than the scrambled data was on, you will probably get your data back using EASEUS.  

Oh yes, a good old trick I should pass along.  

If the disk quits, makes noise, such as loud clicking, and won't read. You think it is shot and it contains important data that may cost a bag of gold to professionally recover, here is a real trick.    

Place the HDD in the freezer for three hours, then pull it, immediately hook it up and go to work with recovery. 

You are likely to be successful until the disk begins to heat up. When it does, back in the freezer for an hour (maybe two) and then back in the machine for more recovery. 

Repeat as necessary.

I once recovered the majority of an unreadable 800GB disk using this method!  Took a bit of time, but certainly made me happy.        "
,RavingRabbits,2012-02-15T12:07Z,"It works, all data recovered perfectly without loss, it works best if u didnt overwrite your recently formatted drive with other stuff. This has the ability to recover back in its original folders. The freeware software like recuva doesnt."

,lilome,2012-03-29T14:05Z,"You can always tell a good recovery software if it includes the PE partition & the EFI partition in the recovery proccess.........
And this doesn't 
But for recovery of your files it's alright."
,omersang,2012-04-02T14:38Z,Photo files are recovered but i can't view them. Please help. :(

,dseldown,2012-04-05T20:27Z,"OMFG, I had given up hope of recovery. This program works 100% Fucking Awsome!!
Running Win 7 64 - installed flawlessly!
I just went thru 7 HDD I had.  And recovered invaluable data I thought was gone forever. This Torrent is legit and rock solid, thanks TONS!!:] Also shows me that unless you grind up a HDD into pieces or use a REAL data program shredder, nothings ever really deleted!! To the Uploader you fuckin rock!!"
,FurrballFury,2012-04-18T00:06Z,"Thank you! This torrent saved my arse, I am running Win XP 32-bit and works perfect! Fast download (thank you for all who seeded) and fast install. Recovered 325 gigs of my personal stuff from my 'RAW' HDD. Once again i say, thanks MAFIAA for an arse saving download. =^-^="
,abohasham,2012-04-20T01:34Z,شكرا لك
,YamiKuro,2012-05-02T03:16Z,"Amazing program!
I had accidently formated my Data drive whilst reinstalling windows. I knew all my data was still there but just inaccesable. I tried R-Studio first; took forever, only found 200 out of the 7000 files on the drive and told me that they couldn't be recovered fully.
Then I tried this program and used the complete scan. It also took forever but when it was done I was looking at ALL of the contents of the drive, even the stuff you don't normally see in windows. ATM it has already recovered 5000 files and if you don't hear back from me then they are all fully recovered and I will be looking into buying this software for a job well done! 
Thanks for the upload MAFIAA! And thanks FOSI as well!"
