Windows 8 Build 7850

The build was compiled on 22nd September 2010 and is the Milestone 1 build.


This leak is quite old (~6 Months) - It won't have any of the fancy shit you've probably seen on the blog sites like the new setup UI, the new Welcome Screen and the new Aero Basic UI.

Indeed, it's not that dissimilar from stock Windows 7 - the only major change is the Windows Live integration in the superbar.



To early to download IMO and It's only x86.
Sad day at Microsoft yesterday..."

""this is fake its windows 7 enterprise""

okay idiots, lets look at build numbers.
the latest windows 7 with service pack 1, is build 7601. 

what does this say?

build 7850. go ahead and google that, tell me what comes up.
that's what i thought.

now if you are just going to criticize the uploader, don't even bother with saying anything at all. it's the real deal. and besides all that bullshit,

thank you for the upload :)"

,deHackerOwnz,2011-04-14T10:51Z,"All you fucking wankers screaming fake need to fuck off.

IF you actually had the IQ over 5, you would have searched Google for ""Windows 8 M1 leak"". You would then find out, that this build is still called Windows 7! This is because it was such an early build.

Grow the fuck up and do some research.

To the uploader: Thanks so much dude! Been waiting for this! Ignore the complete idiots, I worry about the education system these days :\"

Stop complaining and do your research, but apparently 99% of you can't do this. Thanks again razvan for uploading this leak"
,baracas,2011-04-16T03:46Z,"Its not fake there are a few things that aren't in windows 7, like the superbar.  But mostly its the same.  I wouldn't use it as your real os, but something to play with for testing purposes maybe.

Way to early to see any real changes they might put in.  Give it 6 months."
,supanut2000,2011-04-16T05:31Z,"ALL OF YOU MORONS...THIS AIN'T FAKE...CHECK WINVER AND IT SAYS 'BUILD 7850'. ALSO THERE'S A USER TILE NEAR THE 'SHOW DESKTOP' BUTTON; INDICATING THAT THIS IS NEW WITH WINDOWS 8.
EVEN WIKIPEDIA CONFIRMED THIS BECAUSE WHEN EARLY BUILDS OF WINDOWS VISTA LEAKED, SAME THING HAPPENED, AND THIS TIME AGAIN, EARLY BUILDS OF WINDOWS 8."
,supanut2000,2011-04-16T05:42Z,"Just to add to my previous comment, early builds of Windows 8 often have traces of previous Windows left behind. This is true for early builds of Windows XP, this is true for Windows 7, this is true for Windows Vista, this is true for Windows 2000 and etc.
Guys do a google search on Longhorn, Windows NT5.0, Whistler, and Windows 7 Milestone. You'll find that early builds often looked the same as the previous versions.
Also I can tell the difference because I experienced a BSOD in VMware while using this build of Windows 8."

,DarkLaunch357,2011-04-18T01:22Z,"thanks man i'm going to try this, though i have 22 GB of RAM and that'll be quite a waste using a 32 bit OS. I have some rapetime HDD here, real pc beats vmware anytime. and for you losers who scream fake, some russian guy uploaded all betas of Windows up to Windows XP. Windows 95's was the only one who did not have the earlier build's name. XP's build had Windows 2000's look, and ""Windows Whistler 2001 Professional"" on the winver name, since Microsoft doesn't rebuild the entire OS but rather enhances it's core and puts a new shell on it. XP you use, it's just an enhanced Windows 2000 with a nicer shell, 7 the same to Windows Vista. it's that simple guys, don't be retarded."
,DarkLaunch357,2011-04-18T01:24Z,"and by Windows NT 6.2, seems Windows 8 is just a further enhancement of Windows Vista building on the already made Windows 7 (6.1) core, just like Windows 2003 (5.2). I hope Windows 9 is actually Windows NT 7.0, because vista and 7 run like SHIT compared to Windows XP x64 (2003-based)"

,DARPA123,2011-04-21T20:30Z,"razvanripper - awesome upload!  Job well done!

To all you non computer tech people - get off the torrent!  This is not a Windows 8 ready for the box to be sold!  Just wait for the consumer version and buy it in your favorite software retailer!

This is legit, the real deal.  This is MILESTONE 1 which means the team at MSFT take the Windows 7 program as their foundation and build upon it.  This is why you see Windows 7 Enterprise listed in the ""My Computer"" properties box.  There are some new tweaked features such as the Portable Workspace - which lets you put Windows on a USB Stick just like Linux on a Stick, etc.  Type PWcreator - you will need a 20gb USB stick.  You will be able to run Winodws right off that stick once done.

This is NOT a stable Windows.  Do NOT download for your everyday OS.  This is for experimental use only.  For techies and geeks to try their own projects on the new OS and of course those that just want to see what is going on.  Windows Update WILL NOT update it to a full verison of Windows 8 when it is ready, lol.  Geez.   Since this is an Enterprise version it requires activation via a KMS Avtivation Server.  Search Internet and you can learn how to make your own.

Again, well done razvanripper!"
