,Allifan,2011-05-07T06:43Z,"Perfect quality, thanks.

Film is about the plight of rich business pricks getting laid off by corporations in the recession.
Maybe a good flick if pertinent to ones own life, but personally I found it boring. Good actors in it though, the prosperous, well-to-do, city types may enjoy this film."

,rashers18,2011-06-17T20:45Z,great pic quality but no sound
,Nabarun,2011-06-23T23:41Z,"It's fucking mono sound. I do appreciate the uploader's efforts. But the audio sucks. ""T0XiCiNK "" are a bunch of assholes trying to get some cheap publicity by tagging crappy mono crap with ""AC3"". Morons, people choose AC3 for the 5.1-channel audio - not for the name. I can't believe some of the users actually gave this ""A=10"" vote. I bet they are hearing impaired.
No offense extremezone, but please don't upload these morons' shit."
