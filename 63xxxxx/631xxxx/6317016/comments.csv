,fuckjews,2011-06-27T18:48Z,thanx for the upload good work I fuckin love slipknot peace!
,tal0nsyi,2011-07-01T14:13Z,"Yo dude, think ya might of got your dates mixed up a little bit. The self titled album was released in 1999 not 1989, the band didnt even exist until 1995! The 10th anniversary album was released in 2009 to commemorate ten years having passed since it was first released."
,theedge82,2011-07-11T22:28Z,"hey tal0nsyi, there was an self-titled EP by slipknot its just not the slipknot everyone knows about."
,azzian,2011-07-25T12:55Z,"@theedge82 yeah there was, and it was released in 1999, their demo was released in 1996. The band was formed in 1995 >."
,snowsquirrel,2011-08-07T17:42Z,"I just went with the dates I had from what I downloaded. Other than that, I hope you all enjoy the collection."
,blizz88,2011-08-17T05:13Z,"The album labeled 1989 should be 1998 guys. It was just a typo. Audio quality is 320kbps, excellent torrent. Only problem is track 12, the title track, is missing from All Hope Is Gone. Thanks for the download."
,blizz88,2011-08-17T05:16Z,Missing track 6 as well.
,GothBoy8,2011-08-21T13:00Z,"Slipknoy wasnt formed till 1994, so how could they have an album in 1989? TIME PARADOX! "
,z0mbiiesh0k,2011-08-31T20:19Z,the 1989 thing is just a typo guys chill lol
,MyxDamnation,2011-09-13T01:46Z,the 1989 self titled is not from the Slipknot you are all looking for. i have seen this same torrent multiple times and it all has the same shit. 
,spit3825,2011-09-17T05:57Z,thx
,henchbench,2011-09-27T22:52Z,"Just DL'd, my computer crashes on finish, and the files are linked to a process that is a jumble of letters? Hmm, virus."
,snowsquirrel,2011-10-20T00:17Z,@henchbench the problem must be with your computer because there is no virus. gtfo.
,BozoTheWicked,2011-11-14T17:06Z,"Azzian your also wrong. Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat was released in 1996, their demo was released in 1998 about a year before their self-titled [EP] in 1999."
,aldo2k6,2011-12-10T16:21Z,"you ungrateful wee bastard's so what if it dont got  all the Singles or track 6 go and find it your self you ungrateful bitch
by the way grate upload "
,gekko672,2011-12-14T16:04Z,"The 1989 slipknot album, is from a different group. they were also called slipknot, but never copyrighted the name. they were thrash metal, as far as i know. only and it didnt last, obviously. so dont get mad at the guy who made the torrent, he is right, that is also slipknot, just not the slipknot we all know today. as it was a completely different band"
,You_Muppet,2012-02-09T09:10Z,"Good quality torrent ... and music, to boot.

Thanks for this, SS."
,Hanaku,2012-03-02T07:30Z,"HOLY FUCK I CREATED THIS ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF HOW WRONG MOST OF YOU ARE WOW!!!
theedge82 right on! Corey was not introduced to the band untill later, the band was formed by Shawn (Clown) Number 6 if memory serves me correctly. you all should really get your fact right before ranting you non maggot wanna be's!!!!!!! FUCK!"
,Hanaku,2012-03-02T07:34Z,"SHIT! still cant get over it, being a LONG TIME SLIPKNOT FAN, I have all CD legit but scratched to shit from simple wear and tear. FUCK YOU ALL FUCK THIS WORLD...(someone finish it in Honor of the Late Paul Gray Number 2 Pig Boar Like mask). Rest in peace you talented mother fucker you!"
,HoosierVaper,2012-03-18T22:25Z,"I'm confused.  Clan is not an actual SlipKnot CD, so naturally that shouldn't be there, and Crowz isn't real.  It never actually was released, ever.  It's all fiction.  So what are those two albums supposedly in this discography? I've not downloaded yet because that alone throws me off.  "
,JoabW,2012-03-31T18:56Z,"To clarify. Clan is a fan album.
Crowz is a mix of unreleased songs and demos with a few Anders live.
The Self Titled is from a band called Slipknot that was around before the real Slipknot (or fake one)
At the time of 1992 our Slipknot was called Painface and changed there name after the song. 
Then Anders reformed Painface with some guys."
,JoabW,2012-03-31T18:57Z,"@Hanaku, you're even wrong....

Also, the band formed in fucking 1992, look it up"
,Gerellirra,2012-04-08T03:43Z,"If you are torrenting, please make sure you seed at LEAST until you reach a 1.0 ratio, failing to do so makes the system fail and the networking of all of this beautiful work people have taken the time to put up here for us wither.  Seeding does not affect your download speed, uploading and downloading are completely different, there is no reason not to seed. I will seed everything I torrent until 1.5 ratio. 

- Thank you snowsquirrel for the torrent"
,jj.jj123,2012-04-20T11:04Z,"Fuck you haters!! snowsquirrel has taken their time to upload you all music, and you cant even be grateful for that!!
