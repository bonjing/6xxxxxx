Lâ€™Oeil du malin is one of the earliest and best examples of the ironic suspense thriller for which Claude Chabrol is best known. It contains all the ingredients of a Chabrolesque thriller, including a relentless, lurking sense of menace, a fragile bourgeois setting, a mounting drama which builds to an inescapable tragic resolution and, naturally, a creepy musical score. Although the film is definitively Chabrol from start to finish, it pays more than a passing homage to the work of that other master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.
