,petr0vi4,2011-04-11T21:47Z,Stop posting this shit. IT IS FAKE.
,mu57ang,2011-04-11T22:22Z,FUck you bastard... Shameless motherfucker... Attention screamer... They should rip that skull from your name... I'll try my level best to report your torrent... Pathetic piece of shit... I hope you get cheated on for the rest of your life... Write 1.2 on your penis too even though it's 1.1 inches long...  
[T],rlf-rls,2011-04-11T22:26Z,"I checked and it works. I don't understand you guys, multi may not work perfect but the game has been updated. I checked the original patch 1.2 and it is the same. Check it out by your self first "
[T],rlf-rls,2011-04-11T23:06Z,"Fuck you too motherfucker, go fuck your self and report to your mother and then fuck her 1 km ass but but beware lest you be drowned in her shit. "
[V],Mbb15,2011-04-11T23:37Z,LOL at the rage comments
,Insomneac,2011-04-12T00:05Z,"Geez there's some ungrateful bastards.

At least rlf-fls is uploading, WTF have you losers uploaded?"
,xVitriolic,2011-04-12T00:25Z,"The displayed version number does show 1.2.0.0, but...

...why does it bother me that this crack is exactly the same file length, down to the byte, as the 1.1 crack? 

Im gonna have to agree with ShiftNoob unless someone can prove that this isnt just the 1.1 crack with the number edited. Not trying to hate here, just skeptical :/"
,yarbs,2011-04-12T00:47Z,"This has nothing to do with the uploader but itâs a fake, Iâve test it and none of the update fixes work so it must be the old 1.1 crack renamed to 1.2"
,Insomneac,2011-04-12T01:28Z,"Some of the fixes do work.

For example, the patch adds a crouch toggle."
,elessarGObonzo,2011-04-12T03:26Z,if it's the update you're worried about download it from Crysis 2 website like most people with a brain. it's the crack that's the concern. can we (pirateers) still play after patching to 1.2 is the question.
,elessarGObonzo,2011-04-12T13:59Z,game is running fine with this crack after patching to v1.2. crouch toggle is the only noticeable difference. i have started a new Profile ingame and all my Nanosuit Addons have switched over to it so couldnt tell ya if new ones are staying after exiting game
,EndFED,2011-04-12T17:10Z,I don't blame the uploader but when I log on it is Crynet servers 1.1 so I am like is this really 1.2 crack?
,mu57ang,2011-04-12T20:02Z,"I'am sorry about that little outrage there... I should've not said those things... I apologize and applaud you for your contribution to this community... 

All the best in life and may you go places... I know this shitty apology cannot take back what i've said, but still, just took a shot in the dark.. Peace and Metal forever... "
,brianxxx,2011-04-12T21:45Z,"At least you were man enough to apologize! 

Some of the other douches that complained make a career out of it here, constantly slamming out of ignorance or lack of patience and never do they contribute. Mistakes happen and sometimes, it just might be your system, and other times it might just be that certain cracks can be problematic. 

The scene releasers always fix their mistakes and the VIPs (colored skulls) that bring the content here are not out to screw anyone. "
,brianxxx,2011-04-12T21:48Z,"@rlf-rls
DUDE! That was a pretty fucking awesomely funny retort! lol 

I felt like that too when I used to upload and get nothing but spit & shit from the crowd! That is why I don't do it any more. Got sick of it and said fuck 'em...let them download viruses since they know so much."
,xVitriolic,2011-04-13T00:43Z,"The crouch toggle option added in update 1.2 works using the 1.1 crack, so saying that it works with this crack doesnt prove anything. 

The 1.2 original exe is slightly larger than the 1.1 original exe, while this crack is exactly the same size as the 1.1 crack. It looks to me like someone just took Resource Hacker or a similar tool and edited the version number to say 1.2.0.0. :/"
,DoodleBop,2011-04-13T11:03Z,"The other teams don't sponsor online play (razor, skidrow, etc..) so we're left over with the ""hackers wannabe"" who's usually 14 yo and think they can hack games. So what you get is trafficked exe's, sometimes it has virus, sometimes it just fucks up your game, or sometimes you just get a good laugh."
,Dave_247,2011-04-13T13:03Z,"The crack isen't working for me, I'm getting an invalid serial error.

The process is,
Install
Update
Copy Crack
Type in random serial
Play

Am I doing this right? Or have Crytek finally got smart?"
,dj1hp,2011-04-13T19:04Z,"crack  100% dont work. this is crack 1.1 only version write 1.2.0.0, when out new crack?"
,aNNunaqi,2011-04-13T20:42Z,"news! update 1.2 works, crack 1.2 newest 13.04.2011 1700

,Ex0duS_5150,2011-04-13T23:47Z,"@aNNunaqi
Oh yeah let me go right to that bullshit link you posted so i can catch a virus or some really neat maleware.. stupid Troll/fool.. quit eating your moms ass out shit for brains.."
,FiFtHeLeMeNt,2011-04-14T00:00Z,"seems the real crack is here , plz check :

,DarkMerc,2011-04-14T00:39Z,"Download from skull uploaders dont trust stupid no lifers without scull (well some unskulled uploaders are good but most are fake :d)
go download 1.2 repack from iND i tested singleplayer and it fixed nano catalysts and added togle of crouch some say that the repack is not proper and the cracker only changed the version number well... i dont believe them :d"
,DarkMerc,2011-04-14T00:40Z,FiFtHeLeMeN is another no lifer that torrent got deleted already :d
,xVitriolic,2011-04-14T02:42Z,"Except for the version number, this file is -identical- to the nogrp 1.1 crack.

Also, I got crouch toggle to work with the old 1.1 crack, so of course it should work on this one because its the exact same thing!

Still waiting for FLT to release their 1.2 crack..."
,k2kn,2011-04-16T10:14Z,"that's funny, as if the patch only is 1 changed exe, that only happened with dead space 2

of course some of the fixes will exist if the patch changes files unrelated to the exe"
,xVitriolic,2011-04-16T18:53Z,"@k2kn:
I know that the patch is multiple files, which is precisely why crouch toggle works with the 1.1 crack. 

Its just that some other users are using the working crouch toggle as ""proof"" that this is really a cracked 1.2 exe. If it works regardless of which exe is used, then it obviously cant be used as proof."
,coldplatypus,2011-04-17T05:38Z,"Hi

When i try to play this game i get the following error:
The program can't start because activation.x86.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.

Can you please help me with this?"
,Esmad3,2011-04-17T18:03Z,@ xVitriolic: Are u sure? There's 10 mb difference in size
,xVitriolic,2011-04-19T08:49Z,"@Esmad3:
Yes, I am sure, unless youre comparing it to a different 1.1 crack that I dont have. This file is identical to the nogrp 1.1 crack (except for the version number displayed)."
,SilentK1ller,2011-04-19T17:15Z,"Thank you all the SinglePlayer fixes work so this is a good Repack :)
A release from FLTDOX like in 1.1 Patch would be better tho :D"
,Reddoguk,2011-04-26T23:37Z,"FFS you guys are dumb as fuck.
Whose asking for a 1.2 crack are retarded.
THERE IS NOW A SERVER SIDE CD KEY CHECKER. IT CAN'T BE CRACKED!!!!!!

Only a keygen will work now and there won't be one anytime soon. Time to leave it alone or buy the fucking thing. "
,s3nr1,2011-04-30T08:19Z,"@Reddoguk STFU people wants to fucking update their fucking games and not necessarily want to fucking play it online. The fucking SP portion is a fucking bug fest and the fucking 1.2 update fixes several of them. So fucking take stick out of your ass, fucking useless faggot. "
