,s.lanso,2011-04-14T18:45Z,Has this worked on most android phones. And is it virus free. Thanks
,McLabia,2011-04-17T06:30Z,Anyone actually try this out?
,s.lanso,2011-04-17T07:22Z,"I searched the app online and I have been using it since it was mentioned here. Seems to be great. A one place to download Pro version of apps free. 
So less time looking here more on the app. 
If you rather download it on the main site you may at www.applanet.net. I thought at first it was just a fake app but nope it was real. It does what it says, you can access the paid apps for free and cool. "

,seventorrents,2011-05-09T22:53Z,Worked! Great thanks
,McLabia,2011-05-14T07:19Z,"It DOES work, however, if you go to applanet.com from your phone, it will automatically install. No reason for there to be a torrent for it honestly, but Thanks Demon."
