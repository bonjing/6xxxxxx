Conspiracies & Politics

Date: 04-11-11 
Host: George Noory 
Guests: Jesse Ventura, Alex Jones 
In the first half, Navy SEAL, wrestler, actor, governor, and bestselling author Jesse Ventura discussed his pursuit for the truth about conspiracies and the American political system. "I love my country but not my government," he commented, adding that the Democrat and Republican parties were akin to going into the soda section of a grocery store and only being offered a choice between Coke and Pepsi, in other words, a two-party dictatorship. The former Minnesota governor said he would consider running as Cong. Ron Paul's running mate in the 2012 presidential race if Paul would drop out of the Republican party and run as an independent. 

The US military is "the strong-arm of the corporations," and this has been going on a lot longer than you would think, he noted. Ventura talked about conspiracies in the JFK assassination, and the 9-11 attacks, as well as FEMA camps in the United States. For his TV series, Conspiracy Theory, they shot footage at a camp in Texas that had barbed wire facing in, in order to keep people from leaving, he reported. That particular episode only aired once, before being pulled from the schedule, he lamented. Ventura also spoke out in favor of WikiLeaks, and pot legalization.

In the second half, radio host Alex Jones shared his commentary on various current events, and revealed suppressed information. While there is concern about the spread of radiation from Japan, the US adds fluoride to tap water which contains radioactive isotopes, and now the EPA is raising levels of the amount of radiation that is considered safe in food & water, he admonished. 

Jones also spoke out against TSA's security procedures at airports, citing incidents where young children are invasively touched and even drug tested. Further, he warned that "federally funded goon squads" will soon be stationed on the streets, at train stations, and various checkpoints to conduct random security procedures as a way to break our will, and train us to be slaves..."and if Americans will put up with this, they'll put up with anything."
