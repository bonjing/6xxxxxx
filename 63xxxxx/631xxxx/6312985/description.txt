Yoko featuring Frenz on drums:
La Japonesa Salsera
Salsa Meets Funk.All original tracks are full of percussion but...no real drumbeat. Until now.
Frenz joins many salsa artists digitally by adding original,very funky beats to their music,making it a colloboration of salsa and fusion. The added sounds are mostly bassdrum,snare,hihat and crashes from real drumsets, and very nicely integrated into the songs with Goldwave,an audio editor.
