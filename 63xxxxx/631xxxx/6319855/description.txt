Three tales from the land of Argaea:

"Jherik's Tale" - a young cougar noble, frustrated with his family, finds peace in affection from an unlikely source.

"Helfer's Busy Day" - everyone's favorite weasel starts his day avoiding trouble and ends up having to avoid more and more of it, until he's hanging pantsless from a window ledge.

"Yilon's Journal" - before "Shadow of the Father," Yilon was *really* immature.

These extras are well worth the read and they fill in some interesting blanks from some of Kyell's other published works. I highly recommend this little collection especially if you enjoy Kyell's other books in the Argaea universe.
