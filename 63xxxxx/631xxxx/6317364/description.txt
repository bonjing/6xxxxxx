"The Musical Man"

Cameron is relishing his role as interim 
music director at Luke and Manny's school, 
and he's taking on the upcoming spring 
musical performance with a little too much 
zest and fervor. Meanwhile, Jay's brother, 
Tommy, is in town for a visit, and their 
relentless brotherly ribbing goes a little 
too far; and Phil convinces the family to be 
in his new realty ad, but when he goes as far 
as to wrap the family minivan in the ad, the 
results are unexpected.

Enjoy :)
