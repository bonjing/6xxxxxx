StoryLine: 
*********

Trevor Reznik is a lathe-operator who suffers from insomnia and hasn't 
slept in a year. Slowly, he begins to doubt his sanity as increasingly 
bizarre things start happening at work and at home. Haunted by a deformed 
co-worker who no one seems to think exists, and an ongoing stream of 
indecipherable Post-It notes he keeps finding on his fridge, he attempts 
to investigate what appears to be a mysterious plot against him and, in 
the process, embroils two women in his madness.
