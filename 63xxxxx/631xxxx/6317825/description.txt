An individualistic artist, top of class in the school of English folk rock, Steve Ashley forged this 1975 successor to his acclaimed debut 'Stroll On' in seemingly no time (hence the title). In fact, it was recorded some four years after 'Stroll On', which had taken three years bizarrely to find its home at the tiny Gull label. The intervening period found Ashley opening up as a writer and tackling a broader compositional canvas. Thus, while his roots in the 'tradition' are still evidenced here, 'Speedy Return' reveals a singer-songwriter working the bigger picture that would influence his later work with Topic. The core elements of Ashley are all in place here: the curiousity and love of middle England, its pastoral landscape, its people and their idiosyncracies, keenly observed with a tender humour peppered with occasional sharpness and anger at the folly of the human condition. 'Speedy Return' brings some of Ashley's most memorable songs, performed by a roll call of folk rock's finest, couched - as with 'Stroll On' - in the swooning arrangements of Nick Drake collaborator, Robert Kirby, who also produces. A bumper booklet of period images and entertaining notes make this reissue the definitive take on an evocative album of both genre and period.
