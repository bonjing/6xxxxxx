,jotalopes,2011-04-11T17:24Z,This movie is great. Thanks for your work!
,believenu,2011-04-11T17:44Z,"thank you, seeding is sharing.. I thought you did this one a little while ago and I missed it. I have a lot of the classics .. on vhs and as I am using funds to raise children this genus (20-40) is enabling me to treat my children to good and great movies without having to fund hollywood a second time.You are leaving a wonderful mark in all our lives..."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T20:22Z,"I've never seen this, oddly--never got the chance until now.  George Peppard is one of my all-time favorite actors.  Audrey Hepburn's Wait Until Dark is the classic thriller that all others must be judged against (which 20-40 encoded way back in October)."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T22:26Z,"Part of my cultural heritage, it is one of my mum's favored and of many people I knew. It's cheesy by modern standards, Mickey Rooney was totally out of mind, but Ms. Hepburn was great, as ever. Fantastic musical theme. Great camera. True classic."

,ThaGoatMan,2011-04-12T05:00Z,"Thank you 20-40, this is one of my favorite movies. Looks like your mom enjoys the finer things in life, send her my regards."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T09:19Z,"@ThaGoatMan: Thanks. My mum is 70y old retired schoolteacher, who dreamed about better life and loved Audrey."

If I burn this to dvd, would it play in a normal dvd player or do I need a special one to play high def?

Yes it will play back on your reg. DVD player.... But if you play this back with a Blue Ray player or a PS3 it will play back with a higher screen resolution so it will look even better on your Flat screen TV...enjoy"
