,aarque,2011-04-16T15:06Z,"Do you ever wonder if stuff like this is an attempt to sell the product? I think it would be an effective ploy. Sure, you give the pirates a chance to de-compile or crack your stuff, but if they can taste it and can't have it, aren't they just as likely to spring the $20? It is how Flight1 sold me Instant Scenery 2. It sucks, btw, SBuilderX is better and free and I can't share it because they use that F1 wrapper that is meshed to your OS and I don't even know if I can re-unlock it with my new motherboard installed, Vista keeps nagging me for re-activation...(but I will up it if anyone asks)

Just a thought, but I always wonder when kids seed demos and pay-to-unlock ware and they say nothing about it needing to be unlocked."
