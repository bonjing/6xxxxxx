,Ataractic,2011-04-11T18:48Z,"brat534: (if 2040 is too busy to fulfil your request) you can search for 'white collar season 2' at the top of the page; you'll find a 2.2 gig torrent. Quality will obviously not be of 2040's level, but size, I think, is in the range you're looking for.

2040: I'm not trying to link-bait (no links posted!) just thought would save you the trouble of replying. if I'm on the wrong side- I'm sorry; won't do it again (:"

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T21:57Z,"@brat534: I made Season One pack of WC and during past summer uploaded all episodes at MU and made them available though MU.txt in many torrents. 

In six months only few episodes were downloaded - don't laugh - THREE (3) times only. On start of Season Two - I encoded and upped first two episodes, back then as separate torrents (well, Pack haters are wrong). Do you know how many downloads W.C 201 and 202 have? 27 and 24 respectively.

What followed was logical - I dropped White Collar because of lack of interest, not because show was bad - I don't like to feel stupid by doing unwanted things.
For no reason - more people discovered that show at second half of second season, asked for it - and I encoded and upped all episodes till season-end.

After that, I re-upped ALL encodes of season two I have once again, as were requested, as ""plus"" in my daily and weekly packs.

Now - they are all gone - due to HDD crash I have a month back.

Anyone who can log-in, can make and up  torrents too. I helped whenever someone wanted to make season packs of my encodes. Most of the times I can't do it myself,  from bandwidth and time limitations - and now, I have no surviving W.C episode to start with.

@Ataractic: It's fine."
,skillet92,2011-04-12T04:56Z,Thanks alot for Mildred Pierce! :)
,Ataractic,2011-04-12T08:42Z,"brat534: it was there yesterday- I can't find it now! the uploader was 'anonymous' so we can't even request them; someone must have deleted it :(

I'm extremely sorry!"
,Ataractic,2011-04-12T08:47Z,"ok, no need to worry- I found another one. type ""White Collar Season2""in the search bar (without quotes, of course)- you'll get the torrent. I have downloaded it in case it gets deleted like the previous one :)

Quality is pretty bad though. I mean, it'd look bad even on handheld devices."
,Ataractic,2011-04-12T08:49Z,"brat534: The previous comment was meant for you. and you need to write season2 without any space between season and 2.

Twentyforty: Thanks for not minding this conversation, sir."
,linkass,2011-04-12T09:32Z,Request: Could you please upload all the parts of The Kennedys after it ends together in a pack? It would be swell!! :D
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T10:44Z,"@linkass: There is no need for doing that: all episodes were aired within one week, 1-6 are active in Weekly
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6308740/TV.Shows.Pack.1st.Week.Apr.PLUS.H264
and still seeded from server (in next 8 hours
 would be removed, so hurry) and last two you have right here."
,Ataractic,2011-04-12T18:14Z,brat534: I could have created a torrent from all the 2040 episodes I have- but my connection is too slow. you'd have taken at least a month to download the thing :D
,linkass,2011-04-13T10:40Z,thanks!! :)
