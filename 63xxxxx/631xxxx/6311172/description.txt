Load this torrent, don't start the download.
Click on "Files" tab (lower part of uTorrent program-window) - right-click 
on file you don't need - choose "Don't download". 
(uTorrent would show "Skipped").
Now, start with download.
Other torrent-programs offer very similar step.

Seed after your download is over, you'll seed only the files 
you choose to download. Please. 
Share with other people, best way you can.
But seed. Share. Do not Hit & Run.

REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN FROM REGULAR 
DOWNLOADERS ONLY. MAKE YOURSELF PRESENT.
PLAIN, COMMON, SHORT "Thanks" is better
accepted than ambiguous or stupid comments.

I can see your words only - not picture of yours (figure of speech, meaning - I don't know who you are, never met any of you and heard no "character" witnesses of yours).

Upfront, to tell you the truth: defending me when insults or stupidities are left as Comments - would give you dozen plus points automatically, and contrary to that - ignoring those and letting them on my concern, to waste my time and energy - deducts equal amount...
