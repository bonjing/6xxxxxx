This is the .flv taken from megavideo as featured on theaudioperv.com. Megavideo's 72 minute watch limit sucks and they keep taking 

the file down, so heres a torrent of the same thing featured on that site. It isn't HD or anything, but its still very watchable. 

Also since it was broadcast on VH1 in the United States, the language is censored -- no beeps just silence. But it is commercial 

free.

Until a HD cap comes around, this is better than nothing as its a nice documentary for anyone interested in the Foo Fighters.

If you don't know how to play this .flv file, go get VLC Media Player and enjoy.
