,Fimoreth,2011-05-05T21:29Z,"I found that if you've beaten the story already, when you enter the DLC you'll here some guys talk and have a loading screen that lasts forever. I found the fix through Google - just load up an earlier sequence and you'll be able to play it fine.

I myself used Sequence 5, Memory 1. Beyond that (and the fact that subtitles don't work in English version) it seems to work great! Good job"
