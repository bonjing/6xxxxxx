Assassin's Creed Brotherhood 'The Da Vinci Disappearance' DLC

Description: 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' tasks Ezio with solving the mystery of Leonardo Da Vinci's kidnapping by an underground cult known as the Hermeticists. To do so, Ezio will have to recover stolen paintings and a pair of new locations designed exclusively for the new DLC. 

In addition to the single-player mission, 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' will expand the multiplayer experience as well. Included in 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' is an all-new map, Alhambra, set in Spain's Albaicin of Granada. The map includes indoor and outdoor areas to provide ample opportunity to blend in before striking. 

Four new characters will be available to play as in 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' including Dama Rossa, the Knight, the Marquis and the Pariah. With those characters you'll be able to partake in two new gameplay modes: Escort, in which two teams of four must protect their VIP target while striking at the others'; and Assassinate, which is a straightforward Deathmatch mode featuring 6-8 players and a 10-minute time limit.
