[T],dynstab2,2011-07-08T03:28Z,Many pages of this file won't load correctly in Adobe Reader 9 and X (and Adobe Acrobat X) but will in Foxit PDF Reader 5 (and Foxit PDF Editor 2). 180 MB of native PDF for a book this small (~1.5 kpages) is certainly an indication that something is wrong with the file but this has yet to be elucidated. (PDF standard?)
