Carenado's C182Q Package. Includes long range version.

This is a FSX SP2 NATIVE package. Compatible with DX10. This is not the fs9 version with the FSX patch.

Note: This is a RIP, not an installer. 
100% Tested Working.

A very nice upgrade/replacement for the default C172.

Please seed to at least 1.0 ratio. Thank you, and enjoy. :)
