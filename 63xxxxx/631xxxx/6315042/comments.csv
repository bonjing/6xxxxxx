,muckguppy,2011-06-17T18:57Z,"Great quality!

thankyou for the upload.

After watching it I'm not sure WHAT to think.. It has some good ideas.. Overall it's a movie that wasn't sure what it set out to be.. 

It's worth watching.

There are a few cheap scares in it which devalue the process but overall it's got a meditative tone to it.

A *very* unfocussed meditative tone.. but yeah, whatever. :)

3/5 stars."
,muckguppy,2011-06-21T06:33Z,"ps. Dude! I love your uploads ..

this is a french made french languaged movie and does indeed include the english subtitles file..another poster had a problem w the subs..but they worked fine for me.i played the movie on computer not dvd player however  and as long as u leave the sub file and the movie file in the same folder they should work....i used gomplayer or km player media player and everything worked fine for me
