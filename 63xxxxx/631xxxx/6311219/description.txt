Giselle-Royal ballet-2006[iPod H264 DVDrip](with chapters)

The Royal Ballet mounted this 2006 stage production (by Peter Wright) of composer Adolphe Adam's ballet Giselle, 
with Alina Cojucaru, Johan Kobborg, Marianela NuÃ±ez and Martin Harvey as the principal dancers. 
Marius Petipa did the choreography; The Orchestra of the Royal Opera House lends added musical accompaniment.
 ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi

'Cojocaru's interpretation, everyone seems to agree, is one of the greatest of all time, 
and she continues to refine it with every performanceâ€¦ One of the things which makes Cojocaru so poignant 
in this role is a quality that one senses in the dancer herself. 
Something in the emotional charge of her performances, some fragility beneath the ballerina steel, 
emphasises the ephemeral nature of the art form. 
It reminds us that we must seize the day.' --The Observer
