 Hailed by ARTISTdirect for a sound "somewhere between the glitch-psychosis of Squarepusher and the catchier than hell dance of Daft Punk," Skrillex is the pseudonym used by Sonny Moore to differentiate his dance music from his band music. It was originally an old AIM screenname of his. Throughout 2010 Skrillex has become more and more a part of Soony Moore's life, having released the 'My Name Is Skrillex EP" for free and 'Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites' through Mau5trap on Beatport exclusively until November 19th, where it will arrive at all other digital distribution stores and websites.
