David & David\'s Boomtown is the first CD that made me say, \"Oh, I get it. Too Digital.\" That\'s why I turned to Classic Records\' 200g audiophile LP. On the downside, the record has, in my opinion, more surface noise than an audiophile LP ought to have. However, this disc strikes the balance that was missing with the CD. Full bass, warm sound, no treble-y harshness. This is the way to go with this classic album.
