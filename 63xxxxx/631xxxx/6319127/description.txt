StoryLine: 
*********

In rural Mississippi, Lazarus, a former blues musician who survives by 
truck farming, finds a young girl nearly beaten to death near his home. 
She's the white-trash town tramp, molded by a life of sexual abuse at 
the hands of her father and verbal abuse from her mother, who seems to 
delight in reminding Rae of her mistake in not aborting her. Lazarus, 
who is also facing personal crisis at the dissolution of his marriage, 
nurses Rae back to health, providing her with gentle, fatherly advice 
as well as an education in blues music. Rae's boyfriend, Ronnie, goaded 
by the man who nearly beat Rae to death, misunderstands the relationship 
between Lazarus and Rae, and vows to kill him. Lazarus, exhibiting a 
street-smart understanding of violence and its motives, calls Ronnie's 
bluff, senses that he is as troubled as Rae, and becomes a guiding force 
in the young couple's resurrection.
