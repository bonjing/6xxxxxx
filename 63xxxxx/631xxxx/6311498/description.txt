Showtime Sports announced an unrestricted access show, Fight Camp 360: Fedor vs. Rogers, on Thursday to highlight the November 7th event, Strikeforce: Fedor vs. Rogers. The special will feature an all access look at Fedor Emelianenko and his upcoming opponent Brett Rogers.

Fresh off the heels of Showtimeâ€™s Fight Camp 360: Inside the Super Six World Boxing Classic, to the networks General Manager Ken Hershman it makes sense, â€œThe response to our inaugural episode of Fight Camp 360Â°: Inside The Super Six World Boxing Classic chronicling the boxing tournament has been overwhelming. Because of the subjects involved â€“ the mysterious world champion set to fight a man living the American dream â€“ we had to turn our lens in this direction.â€

Director of the show Ron Yassan, who was allowed access to Fedors training camp in Russia, had this to add, â€œFedor is beyond captivating as a fighter, and more so, as a man. Itâ€™s a pure joy to film him so intimately as he strives for perfection in life and sport with grace and charm. While training for this most important match, he kindly opened up his life to us in and out of the ring, without the ego that often comes with being the very best at oneâ€™s craft.â€

The special will premier on Showtime November 3rd, with regular showings up until the event on November 7th. CBS will also make the show available in advance to its 200-plus affiliate stations.
