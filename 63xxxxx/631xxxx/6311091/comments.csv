quality upload for small file, good work vice rock, thanks"
,dsorc,2011-05-07T16:31Z,Aspect ratio is way off - flat land. Force it to 16:9.
,Coombsy007,2011-07-08T02:19Z,"Mate I dont usually comment on things unless they are horribly bad in some way, but the quality of this upload for its size blew me away, thanks very much"
,k3nd00d,2011-07-11T00:09Z,"Aspect ratio of this film is 1.85:1, not 2.35:1 as this rip is. Quality may be high, but everyone is short and fat!"
,hexrider,2011-07-26T18:02Z,"here's a temp. fix for the AR:
in BSPlayer, goto Video | Aspect Ratio & select 16:9 (or shift 2)
in MPC, start the movie, press 8 on the number pad until there is only 1"" black bar  remaining

video bitrate is 2263 Kbps & sharp!"
