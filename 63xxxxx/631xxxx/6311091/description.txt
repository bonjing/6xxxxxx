Storyline: 
             In a near-future New York, eccentric Ken Castle (Michael C. Hall) has revolutionized the gaming industry with his invention of self-replicating nanites that replace existing brain cells and allow full control of all motor functions by a third party. The first major application of this technology is a game called Society, which allows gamers to control a real person in a pseudo community (much like current simulated worlds such as The Sims or Second Life but with far more telepresence and mind control). This generally boils down to the players engaging in all manner of debauchery, such as deliberately injuring their "characters", engaging in sex with random people, and eating disgusting things because they don't actually have to taste it. As a result, those who work as "characters" in Society are very well paid for their participation. A second game, Slayers, is a multiplayer, third-person shooter game with death-row prisoners as avatars in genuinely lethal battles. Any inmate who lives through thirty matches wins a full pardon. Simon, a seventeen-year old gamer (Logan Lerman) has control over John "Kable" Tillman (Gerard Butler), the most recognizable face in Slayers due to having survived twenty-seven matches, far more than any other participant in Slayers' history.
