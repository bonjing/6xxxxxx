Artist: Gedo
Title: Gedo
Genre: Psychedelic Rock,Rock\'n\'Roll
Origin: Japan

Gedo, put together by ex members of M and Too Much . The group were a popular attraction on the fledgling Japanese \'rock\' festival circuit. Building up a hard core fan base of bikers .This live set released in 1974 is the group\'s debut album. First song \'Scent\' rocks fast n\' hard with energy levels in the red . The pace drops down to a bluesy level for \' Don\'t Run Away\' .The signiture tune \'Gedo\' has a riff identical to the Pistols \'Liar\'. \'Rock\'n\'Roll Stupid\' is done tounge in cheek. \'Dance, Dance Dance\' does what it says. Flip over to side two. Where \'Byoon Byoon\' and \'Rotten Life\' quickens the pace again. The band take a breather on \'At the Usual Place\'( a re-write of \'The Great Pretender\') . The penultimate track \'Completed\' is a killer and burns with the same high octane rock\'n\'roll intensity that the MC5 conjured up with \'Kick out The Jams\'. The final song is \'Tender Betrayal\'is a tender acoustic ballad....The albums ends with the heavy drone of revved up motor cycles.. .......Classic Japanese rock\'n\'roll..\"!!
