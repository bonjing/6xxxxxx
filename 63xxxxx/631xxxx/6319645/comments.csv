,TRUEsnake,2011-04-17T12:03Z,"works perfect nothing wrong with the file,
working english subs can be found on subscene"
,svgvkg,2011-04-18T20:04Z,"The extension on the torrent says xvid, however when I dl it, all I see are .rar files.
What is a rar file and what program plays it?"
,gjrmgjrm,2011-04-21T09:31Z,svgvkg: are you new? or retarded?
,OrcinusOrca,2011-04-22T12:41Z,"@gjrmgjrm : It would have taken you just about the same effort to answer him as to give him a smartass comment like that.

@svgvkg : .rar files are compressed archives. You need to unpack them with a prog called WinRar into the original file. You will find it free for download just about everywhere.

Not that it makes much sense to use that on these kind of video files in the first place. They are already compressed to the max, and you would just end up with a bigger volume than you started with."
,Cepsita,2011-04-23T05:45Z,"@gjrmgjrm: that's right, none of us was born knowing it all... We learned something just by trying and guessing, and other things, other people was kind enough to teach us how! 

@svgvkg: That's correct, as far as you have winrar, you can try to open the file with extension .r00 and the program will join all the pieces and open a video file... and you're good to go!"
,hollende,2011-04-23T18:21Z,"your fake comments on rars are even more sad than the fake rar torrents you deal, mr scenebalance :("
,tootalluk,2011-04-30T03:23Z,"@scenebalance
I normaly seed for a few weeks after downloading but when i get a RAR file i just extract the video and delete the RAR's as i dont want it twice and therefore i dont seed it there is no size differance so why use winrar"
,perthites,2011-04-30T11:45Z,"All these comments and not ONE on A/V?? 

@OrcinusOrca : BRAVO!!"

,pepparkatt,2011-05-10T21:34Z,"this episode is only 25 min, so don't download it I just watched..."
