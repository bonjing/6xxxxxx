,Shauncold,2011-04-24T15:07Z,I used the patch and all I get is a small box at the bottom of the screen with another box that keeps flashing around it. I'm not sure what this is but I still haven't got this game to work yet.I'm not new to the whole patch and eboot fix thing so I'm not sure what the problem is here. N E info would great.THANX
,bigbang212,2011-04-25T21:29Z,What is the patch for?
,josevaldo,2011-04-28T00:04Z,"Works Perfectly on kmeaw 3.55, it comes with a patch on the file named ""PATCH"", just install it and use the last version of Multiman 1.17.02. If Multiman asks to change the param.sfo just pick YES and go. 
Do not forget to enable your web on the ps3 and disable the auto-logon of the psn account, then when the game asks for login, just press circle and it'll skip it.
Great Game, i'm playing with move and it's amazing!!!"
