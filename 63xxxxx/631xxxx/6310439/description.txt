"Swan Lake" is a complex ballet written and orchestrated by 19th century Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. 
While his heritage and training caused him to struggle with the conventions of Western music, 
Tchaikovsky emerged as a unique voice that wasn't limited by the divisiveness of his Russian influences and peers. 
His unwavering melodic lines and commanding sense of harmony and thematic repetition has allowed his compositions 
to thrive and retain the impact they had when first performed.
