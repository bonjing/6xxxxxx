...And there's more. But maybe i shouldn't paste it all into one comment. 
So i guess what that means is Wizard_Castle.lvl is missing.
Skidrow.update.22. doesn't work either, same problem."

ive installed the update but it still did this before i installed it too..help? "
,guideo,2011-05-30T06:05Z,"Here is how to fix the ""stopped working"" issue.

First, turn off windows UAC (User account control).
To make it, open your control panel, type in UAC on the search box and then open it.
If you are using Vista, uncheck the box.
If you are using Seven, drag the control all the way down.
Click ok.
Reboot the computer.

Now, if you already install magicka, uninstall it, both the update and the game itself.

Run the Game instalation.
When finished, mark the two last boxes (Framework 3.5 and XNA).

Crack it.

Enjoy =D

If you wanna play the update, install and crack it normaly."
,Gennousuke,2011-05-30T13:35Z,or just right click and run as admin

I think your Graphics card can't handle Magicka."
