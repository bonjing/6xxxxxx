,nepa1288,2011-04-13T00:39Z,"okay... after some fact checks.... i think the file size is just fine, given tat prev two were below 400mb.

So the question remains... is it working fine... i mean with out any problems/errors/hangs??

,rerussar,2011-04-13T04:33Z,"Yes, it really seems to be the full version.
English, French, Spanish and Portuguese

@masamune8 and @nepa1288:
It doesn't work on 5.50 gen-d3 but you can update it to 5.50 Prome-4, I tested on my psp2000 and it worked like a charm.

Great game, can't wait to beat it!"
