Someone please repost this torrent for me ( would be nice if you can include the same cover image & ISBN tag - just copy mine is fine ). I don't want to keep too many ebooks under the same account. Thanks

New edition of a text that combines the most useful features of the traditional functional group approach to organic chemistry with one based on reaction mechanisms. Practical applications show how the subject is related to much of the everyday world. The 25 chapters cover topics including carbon compounds and chemical bonds, acids and bases, alkanes, chiral molecules, ionic reactions, alkenes, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry, radical reactions, alcohols and ethers, alcohols for carbonyl compounds, conjugated unsaturated systems, aromatic compounds, aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, chemistry of enolate anions, amines, phenols and aryl halides, carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids and proteins, and nucleic acids and protein synthesis. The included CD-ROM contains concept units, animated grapics, 3D models, and exercises and tutorials. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)
