Soon as it hits 0.25% done it hits error
Thanks anyhoo, will keep trying with other clients till I get it"
,strmi,2011-04-16T20:13Z,"The reason you're likely getting errors isn't because of the torrent client.  The names of the files (with the directories included) in some cases far exceed the windows restriction of 255 characters.  This restriction isn't a problem in Mac or *nix operating systems.

In Vuze, and I'm sure in most of the other clients, you can rename (right click the file name and choose ""Quick Rename"") the offending files to something shorter, and then tell the client to recheck the files and it will download properly. 

for instance: 
quick rename ""67 Band of brothers E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest - Stephen E. Ambrose""

to ""67 Band of brothers E Company - Stephen E. Ambrose"" and it won't be a problem anymore. 

You won't lose any information, the name of the book is in the folder name and the file  name for some reason, which is what's causing the problem for windows users.

Be warned, there were a -lot- of them in this torrent. "
