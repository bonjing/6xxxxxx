,tangocash,2011-04-12T19:30Z,"hi twentyforty, i want to thank u for the amazing torrents, great quality in very small size.

i have one suggestion/request ,

cud u make separate torrent for a tv show which has all the episodes of that show once the season of that show is over, for example season 1 of No Ordinary Family is over, but i have to download 20 torrents of ur tv show pack to get the 20 episodes of that show plus i have to look in every tv show pack torrent to see which one has a episode of the show.

i hope u will think abt it.

thanks and keep up the amazing work."
,psipsina111,2011-04-12T19:31Z,Thank you.
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T20:35Z,"@tangocash: I made torrent of full seasons for seven years. Sorely, it happens to be for shows you don't like.

Regarding your suggestion (after people have Columbus moment - America was discovered, NOT created by that gentleman) many people ask me the same. From time to time, I answer, but effect is - negligible.

Look what I posted yesterday, day before, day before that, last week, last month and like gazillion times during seven years:

Along answer yesterday
""Anyone who can log-in, can make and up torrents too. I helped whenever someone wanted to make season packs of my encodes. Most of the times I can't do it myself, from bandwidth and time limitations..."""

Specific thanx for Castle Endgame Mad Love SGU and Chicago Code

thnx for Crimson petal and the white from y-day as well

ROFL at Tangocash seriously you complaining about merely LOOKING into every TV pack? Seriously try encoding then upping a torrent and seeding it by one's self till others help pick up the slack (if that even happens or if one merely has leechers alone to 'help') some time and see the time involved in THAT endeavor then perhaps you'd appreciate the time and effort 20-40 puts in.  Take what is offered and be happy beggars can't be choosers after all, if you don't like how things are done fork over the moolah and by the DVDs!"
