Then I use it and starts fine but then, I made a big STUPID mistake...I downloaded the realflight g5.5 from the official website, and then when I tried to play the simulator, and it said that i can't, and i don't remember why...so I reinstalled and when i tried to put the serial numbers, the ""ok"" button doesn't highlight. Then I delete the realflight g4.5 that i bought long ago because I can't play it too since i installed the g5 (this torrent)...so I reinstalled again the g5 and the ""ok"" button doesn't work again, PLEASE REPLY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
