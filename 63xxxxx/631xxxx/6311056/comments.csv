It aired in the US."
,garfiel,2011-04-12T04:24Z,"Okay folks, looks like this did air in the US, dammed TV station here I recorded it off recons it was a world wide first airing.

Anyway It's 720 x 480 

I trimmed it a little from it's 4x3 aspect it was shown here at.

So should be listed as 
S8E21  Partial Terms of Endearment

Enjoy"
