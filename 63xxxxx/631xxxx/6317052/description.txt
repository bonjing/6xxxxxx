Release Description
---------------------

Blood Brothers Pt.3

In part three of this series, we get a glimpse at the final confrontation between Thor and Loki 
but we don't see the climax of the bout that shows exactly how Thor was defeated. 
The exploration of Loki's new persona is what really keeps me intrigued; 
Loki is determined to fight fate and continue his reign over Asgard after learning the hard fact that 
the universe has labeled all other versions of him in existence as the underdog.

This episode brings a less than exciting confrontation between Odin and Loki, 
but shows how Loki ended up being his adopted son. Sif and Balder are revisited, 
though nothing new is brought to the table. Overall the episode was really good; 
ending on another good cliffhanger that, once again, left me wanting more and asking more questions.
