SwiftKit is a Toolkit designed for RuneScape players by conveniently bringing together all common RuneScape tools and features from all over into one single application.

SwiftKit is an unique browser. However, this unique browser isn't designed for browsing websites. It's designed for playing RuneScape in and, as a result, is full of RuneScape specific utilities, bookmarks to popular guides/websites, and anything else required to give you the edge while still remaining within the games rules.

SwiftKit will be able to assist you in whatever task you may be working on in-game, whether your task is doing a quest, following a clue scroll, or just leveling up your favorite skill. Swiftkit will even be able to assist you in planning your next task with its multiple planning utilities such as the Quest Planner, Calculators and Highscore tools.

Update 1.61 - GE History Graphs

Over the last few updates we've been trialing a GE prices option in the Item Lookups. So far so good, so we've decided to take it one step further. This update brings a new button that allows you to view the price history graphs that are normally found on the official Grand Exchange. You are given the options of 30, 90 and 180 day graphs.

The feature seems to work really well with the exception of how slow the RuneScape website is. Hopefully Jagex release a "lite feed" of the GE like they did of the Hiscores. Until then there isn't much we can do about the speed.

Changes and Fixes:
+ New GE price graph button in the Item Database lookup.
+ Fixed a bug that caused SK to crash after 60 seconds from opening.
+ Fixed a bug in Advent Log Center that caused SK to crash.
+ Fixed bug allowing you to change screenshots while uploading in Viewer.
