,chandlerboy,2011-04-16T16:39Z,Why upload RARs in a torrent? That is hugely retarded. Congrats.
,unpocoloco,2011-04-17T13:53Z,"chandlerboy, Do you see the file with the sfv extension? google ""sfv"" or ""Simple file verification""
and all will be revealed."
,rannug_1,2011-04-18T12:51Z,Nothing is revealed by looking up what sfv means. I have to agree it's meaningless to encrypt small video files like this.
