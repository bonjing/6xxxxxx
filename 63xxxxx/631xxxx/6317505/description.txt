Synopsis:
Are you anal-retentive when it comes to keeping your PC clean? Do you hate 
installing software because it leaves trash all over your computer leading
to poor performance? Me too! Nero is one of the worst culprits. It installs
tons of trash on your computer and registry! It also installs and loads tons
of codecs that are loaded everytime you boot up your computer regardless if
it's needed. Needless to say, this dramatically impacts the boot-time and
overall performance of your computer. I can go on forever...

There are plenty of free and portable burning software available. But none have
the capabilities of Nero Vision/Nero Recode. Thus the reason i made this.
