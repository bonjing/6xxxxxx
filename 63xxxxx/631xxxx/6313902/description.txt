The second best band from Athens Georgia (after R.E.M.), the "B-52's" have a sound that you can't not like. It's retro happy weird sing-a-long music, and the two women have great voices to match it. The only thing that you could hate, or love, is Fred, who more or less talks his way through alot of the songs, kind of like that guy from "The Sugarcubes", but less annoying. This far-out and lengthy collection includes the big hits "Rock Lobster", "Private Idaho", and of course "Loveshack". My faves are "Mesopotamia" and "Song For A Future Generation", but they're all good. I wish this had another track from "Cosmic Thing", but no biggie. My suggestion would be to turn off "Channel Z", turn on your "Strobe Light", "Roam" where you want to, "Party Out Of Bounds", and join the "Deadbeat Club".
