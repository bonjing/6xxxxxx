Thanks Uploader."

,kylarthorne,2012-04-22T21:21Z,"Every time i try to run METT-Program-Player.exe it tells me: 
""Please insert the correct CD-Rom, slect OK and restart application.""
what CD-ROM???"
,fpxsi,2012-05-02T18:00Z,"First you should mount the METT.iso (located into the Micro Expression's folder) with a read's iso software (I used Daemon Tool) or burn it with a CD. Then, when the Autoplay options appear, don't run it from it, explore the folder. Locate the ""METT-Program-Player.exe"" and if you have Win7 (in my case) or Vista, I guess, run it as Windows XP SP3 [right click>properties>compatibility>compatibility mode>Windows XP (Service Pack 3)].

This worked for me, I hope for you too. Thanks for the uploaded."
