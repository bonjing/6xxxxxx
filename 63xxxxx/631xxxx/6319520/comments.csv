,believenu,2011-04-16T07:50Z,"Ok I am going to repeat this comment for a while(If thats ok 20-40) as some peeples are stund and don't get how easy it is to do..
By the way leeches are blood sucking slimey creatures which you burn off you so BEWARE!

for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even I my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...If you have a limit do at least 1:1 .take 500mb give 500mb simple.
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING.

,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T11:09Z,Still (Force-) Seeding Lost Girl (3.59 GB out of 2.2 GB initial size).
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T12:27Z,"@believenu: I'm fine with you repeating that, in fact I was doing the same, like gazillion times, making people sick of my constant repeating or preaching. 

It was before I was forced to came on TPB - and her - not only that low-level of fan-base was lost, but new ""breed"" came to  pay, stronger than ever.
Number of downloads dropped twenty times (what was hard to predict regarding that TPB was always ten times bigger than any other site) and number of Hit&Runs (not petty ones, when people exchange maybe too little) but pure ones - when they literary grab, giving 0.01% back and run away - have risen ten times and now is constantly in range 98-99 percent, and not only that torrents dies (what is predictable) but thy die too fast - before people on slow connections have even finished with download.
..."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T12:28Z,"...
When I spoke numerous times, how torrenting is something that gives special kick to small grabbing creature inside human souls - to grab something for free and then run away unpunished - wasn't well accepted, for well known reasons: people do not want to be preached (""look how thief gives a lesson""), they do not want to be pointed in directions other than their mental/social environment already has established as foreseeable path, and they came NOT here to share - but to GET something. Latter is the worst, but that is how it is right now.

It's kind of tittering with cleptomaniac part of every human mind. It's sad - but solidarity do not exist (as extension of empathy, one psychological category that is specific for humans) and - as many good things has been 'killed', not died out of natural causes. Some people say wrongly 'God is dead'. No, we managed do kill goodness inside, and consequences of our own misdoings we simply call wrong."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T12:32Z,"Many, many errors.

and her = and here
came to pay = came to play

I am not feeling OK, that's it.

Sorry."

,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-16T18:08Z,"@twentyforty
The .01%ers do it now because THEY CAN, whereas before, with their relatively slow-speed connections, they were forced to ""give something back"" while they were downloading at least.  Their motivations were the same then though, as now--take it as quick as they can, and run, before they are caught by the pirate police.  As Stephen Stills wrote in his song Stop Children, ""Paranoia runs deep""."
,punk67,2011-04-16T21:14Z,thanks as allways mate
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-16T21:15Z,"@formerly_azrielle: LOL There is enough idiots who think that they're faster than light (electrons) and if they download, let say, in twenty minutes and run away - by some magic their IP address cannot be  notified in many logs... LOL to that... Newsflash: ANY IP, even if somebody have just peeped in - is in few dozen logs automatically. I have it, any downloader can enable Logging and have permanent black on white, who, when, how much have downloaded, even a byte, even for a millisecond."
