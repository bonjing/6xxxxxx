The whole game is builded from scratch and nothing is used from the original. Now that the final version is out and was in the news SEGA shut down the download site. Hopefully they get to a understanding. 
Game Works Great!!!Thanxs Tavsen!!!!"

I've been doing this for a few months (it feels great) but now my penis has turned blue/black/purple and is incredibly painful. I'm too embarrassed to go to the hospital so I'm thinking of amputating it myself. Do you think I should play this game before or after I amputate?"
