[T],cad40,2011-04-18T21:44Z,@martincorleone66 If you can do better then do or stop moaning and give praise to uploaders not negative comments for all the uploaders  time and hard work to give you free stuff.
[T],n2kmaster,2011-04-20T23:38Z,"I'm trying to do better actually using this release, I'm pretty sure i've removed most of the flickering, i still cant tell about the audio or not gonna do 2 passes from the looks of it in order to stop the flickering and fix the gamma and color on it and do a third pass on it to clean up the sound, is the spanish version the same version, i was thinking splicing audio if their version is better"
,8rankinho,2011-04-21T17:45Z,If you want better quality just go to the cinema. Or wait for the DVDRIP version. Don't mock the uploaders who're doing the best as possible for free so you don't pay for a freakin ticket.
