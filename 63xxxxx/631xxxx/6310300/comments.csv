REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN FROM REGULAR 
DOWNLOADERS ONLY. MAKE YOURSELF PRESENT.
PLAIN, COMMON, SHORT ""Thanks"" is better
accepted than ambiguous or stupid comments.

I can see your words only - not picture of yours (figure of speech, meaning - I don't know who you are, never met any of you and heard no ""character"" witnesses of yours).

Upfront, to tell you the truth: defending me when insults or stupidities are left as Comments - would give you dozen plus points automatically, and contrary to that - ignoring those and letting them on my concern, to waste my time and energy - deducts equal amount... "
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-04-11T10:21Z,"I will report this :

NOTE: Zen Bud and other spammers:

      DO NOT advertise your torrents on threads of other uploaders.

      Zen Bud - this is a warning. I bought my first PC in Fall of 1983.

      That is rude, invasive, stupid and many pink and green skulls
      lost their status over that."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T10:40Z,"You MUST report this. Then TPB staff would look into upload-logs and see that this one is my third upload of same torrent.
Then they would look into comments-log and see your entries in torrents I deleted because of you.

I asked you very nicely and very reasonable thing.

You decided to go against."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T10:50Z,"... and in your obsessive-compulsive clicking on ""minus"" in the past and right now."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T11:10Z,"@ZB
I can't recall ANY of 20-40's movie encodes being AT LEAST a GIGABYTE smaller than what seems to be your standard size of ~2.5 GB; moreover, I also cannot recall anyone complaining about lousy sound quality either.  Food for thought?"
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-04-11T11:10Z,"Well were is the evidence ?

I cant find any spam!

I think you made a mistake :("
[V],Zen_Bud,2011-04-11T11:12Z,"""nicely and very reasonable thing""

I call it false accusations!

Stop right know!"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T11:54Z,"@ZB: Same as before, same ole, same ole'.

""...this one is my third upload of same torrent.

Deleted by me. Spammed torrents get - deleted.

How one defines spam?
After I asked you to stop advertising your torrents - and you have continued multiple times to post SAME message again and again (and I asked you to stop, nicely) - your message becomes a spam-post, unwanted, absolutely the same, repetitive posting.

This is NOT a pissing contest. All uploaders (especially ones who earned skulls) are doing the great job. WE must make example to others, not act as the worst of worse.

And: even if I have deleted your escapades, many people have seen it, ""formerly_azrielle"" was one of them, and many others too...

Behave."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T12:01Z,"*...NOT being AT LEAST...*

I can recall quite clearly the links you posted to your relatively crummy encodes, ZB, because I went there and looked them up, along with a few others.  I was particularly intrigued with the contrast between your encode, and 20-40's encode (or for that matter MY OWN  XVID DVDRip that I still have on my archive HDD) of Serenity.  And the complaints--about yours.  You're not even in the same League.  Or marketing niche, if you prefer.  "

i stand on your side as Â«evidenceÂ» cause i was the first one to DL your 1st post of Vertigo and witnessed all links posted by Zen-Bud (around 5) and also witnessed the post of a link to a fake Facebook account posted by:

@ ALL MODERATORS
i honestly think you had to be advised to take whatever actions you have to...for the sake of integrity of TPB's Mods and site...

INTEGRITY: as Wiki described:
Integrity is a concept of consistency of actions, values, methods, measures, principles, expectations, and outcomes. In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions. Integrity can be regarded as the opposite of hypocrisy,[1] in that it regards internal consistency as a virtue, and suggests that parties holding apparently conflicting values should account for the discrepancy or alter their beliefs."
,spiritualiste,2011-04-11T16:50Z,"@ ALL REGULARS
i strongly suggest to all of us to go the the FAKE Facebook account of Twentyforty and report it as fake (or false). This way, they will close it fast...
Thanks to the 20-40 fans..."
,believenu,2011-04-11T18:09Z,truly .I viewed it as well I never assumed that some would be that brave to post a fake link to false facebook account but I too have a record of this.
,froglog,2011-04-11T23:30Z,Thanks
,vkrishzz,2011-04-12T10:10Z,omg why this zen_bug nd abciscrazy doin all these stuff..hate these users...

,alvi-xdrt,2011-09-10T12:36Z,Looks like I came here after the torpedo wrecked it.....so....guys....A/V?? Anyone?? Thank you!!
,bud_1992,2012-05-01T14:14Z,"Thank you for the upload.  Don't let a few bad apples spoil the pie.  Some folks are just angry or delusional and truly believe they are right no matter what.  They waste most of their time trying to convince or prove to the world this and it really isn't important.  All the important things are passing them by, while they fight for an unimportant cause, we who appreciate the uploads enjoy them, and immensely thank you."
,LezDawson,2012-06-02T19:34Z,"I just tried ZenBud's rip - it's AWFUL. Jerky and stuttery even on a PC. On a BoxeeBox media player it's unplayable. Oh well, my search goes on for a good 720p rip of this, around 3-5GB."
,LezDawson,2012-06-04T02:05Z,"Found the ""proper"" re-rip! Posted here for anyone who wants it. Sample included in torrent.
