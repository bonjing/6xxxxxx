,geiche,2011-04-24T05:08Z,why does this thing want to mess with taskhost.exe?  Virus?
,nipunb,2011-04-26T10:52Z,"@geiche : dont post false comments, i've tested it myself. There is just a setup file and a patch file which patches a file in installation directory to enable full version.
There is no virus and there is nothing to do with any taskhost.exe file or whatever. Maybe it is a false positive.
This torrent is clean...."
