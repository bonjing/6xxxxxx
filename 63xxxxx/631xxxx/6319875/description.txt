
Description:

Asia are an English rock group formed in 1981. The band was labelled a supergroup and included former members of veteran
progressive rock bands Yes, King Crimson, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Uriah Heep, U.K., Roxy Music, Wishbone Ash and The Buggles.
Since 2007, there have been two distinct groups using the Asia name: a reunion of the band's original line-up
performing as Asia, and Asia Featuring John Payne as a continuation of the pre-2006 Asia line-up,
initially featuring three of its members.

Includes the complete albums ASIA (1982), ALPHA (1983), and ASTRA (1986), plus bonus tracks.

A re-pressing of 2002's excellent Anthologia: 20th Anniversary Geffen Years Collection,
this isn't just a loosely assembled collection of Asia's finest moments -- it's everything but the kitchen sink and
bandmember arguments caught on tape. For diehards who missed its initial pressing, this second time around is redemption.
This, quite simply, delivers everything fans could ever want (and in some cases need) from the supergroup
that was at the top of the arena rock game during the '80s. However, those who aren't die-hard loyalists would be
better served by checking out 2003's 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: "The Best of Asia"
as a viable substitute and a filler-free, less intimidating entry point into the group's catalog.
