Larry Clark's Kids (1995) - Region 4 PAL

I've tried to find the best quality copy of the film with the full uncut scene of the sleeping child (which was omitted from most PAL versions) intact.

I went on DVDcompare and found that the Russian version is the best version available.

So I spent a lot of time looking for the Russian Dvd with no success. I then came across the Australian version of the film, which had better picture quality than the American version (probably helps that is PAL), and is completely Uncut.

I'm not part of any special movie torrent sites, and wanted to give this to collector's who will appreciate it, but since I had no luck there, I decided to share it with you good folks instead.

Anyway, I present to you, the best quality copy of Kids in it's full DVD entirety. 

Enjoy
