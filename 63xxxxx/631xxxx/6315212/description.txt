Storyline:Bob Lee Swagger, one of the world's great marksmen and the son
 of a Congressional Medal of Honoree, is a loner living in the Rockies. 
He's left the military, having been hung out to dry in a secret Ethiopian 
mission a few years before, when he's recruited by a lisping colonel to help 
find a way that the President of the US might be assassinated in one of three 
cities in the next two weeks. He does his work, but the shot is fired notwith
standing and Bob Lee is quickly the fall guy: wounded and hunted by thousands, 
he goes to ground and, aided by two unlikely allies, searches for the truth and 
for those who double-crossed him. All roads lead back to Ethiopia.
