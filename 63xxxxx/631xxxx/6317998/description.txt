The Rolling Stones Singles Collection - The London Years was originally released August 15, 1989 in the U.S. only. There are no other compilations that include all the single hits. This is very much a Stones collectors album that encompasses the era of the 45 RPM single from their start in 1963 through 1969, with some things from as late as 1975. The set includes all the London singles and B sides plus all the Decca UK single releases that were not released in the US. Plus Brown Sugar and Wild Horses (which were recorded for Rolling Stones Records while the Decca/London contract was still in effect), Jagger's soundtrack song Memo From Turner, and the 4 single tracks (I Don't Know Why, Try A Little Harder, Out Of Time, and Jiving Sister Fanny) that were pulled from the Decca/London vaults and released against the Band's wishes in 1975 (from the controversial Metamorphosis album). The booklet that comes with the 3 CD set has notes on each song, so I will just outline which singles, B-sides, etc. came from which year for you here. I have also indicated which other US compilation albums the song appears on.
Code:
B = Big Hits (High Tide & Green Grass)
T = Through The Past, Darkly (Big Hits Vol. 2)
H = Hot Rocks 1964-1971
M = More Hot Rocks (Big Hits And Fazed Cookies)
