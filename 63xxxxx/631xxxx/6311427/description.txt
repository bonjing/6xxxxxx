         Underwater explorers in the Baltic Sea set out to bring       
         a recently discovered ghost ship - one of the most intact     
         ancient wooden wrecks ever found - back to life. By pushing   
         the frontiers of maritime archaeology and using the latest    
         technology, the team hopes to recover artifacts from the      
         ship, take measurements and create a 3-D model of the         
         ship with pinpoint accuracy - unlocking a treasure trove      
          of information.
