,xyperox,2011-06-15T19:07Z,NOT BOOTABLE INSTALLATION. Not worth for download. Cheers
,souz_anderson,2011-07-09T16:50Z,What can I do for the installation to be bootable?
,banzer,2011-07-16T01:28Z,"Wifi doesn't work, and it's not a bootable dvd. You can only upgrade using a setup.exe program. Waste of time, if you ask me."
