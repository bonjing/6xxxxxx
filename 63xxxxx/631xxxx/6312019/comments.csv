Quick and genuine question: What are the advantages of using multi-part rar files?"
,Kv99,2011-04-12T16:18Z,"@boltok
It's from the days of Usenet and unreliable downloads. If your download was messed up, you only had to re-download the corrupted rars, not the whole thing. Of course, now with bit torrent, they are completely useless and a waste of disk space + time. "
,meche89,2011-04-14T09:04Z,the rar name (how i nailed you mammy) may seen that is fake torrent but it is original with very high speed (1 mb/sec). thank you. but name leave suspicion.
