fully working power designer. I tryed to find one and have a lot of problems so when I finnaly managed I will share it now... in EDGE directory you will find 2 files one dll and one licence. when you install pd copy dll in directory and then from Power designer run licencing and use other file. it will work just fine... cheers...
