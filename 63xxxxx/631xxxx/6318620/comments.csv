,Normalcy,2011-06-29T08:11Z,"to get subtitles working move the .srt file to the same folder as the movie and rename it to the name of the movie (still ending in .srt not .mp4 obviously)

now open the movie with windows media player, or something else that supports .srt, which isn't very many players

make sure Play -> Captions & Subtitles is turned on"
,Trickee,2011-07-09T19:51Z,Holy shit... I have never heard of this. I have never seen a movie from Norway. But this looks great. I need to see this.
,kevinah95,2011-08-02T18:53Z,is it sound on this?
,livefree68,2011-09-01T01:09Z,"Thanks for the up m8!
I,ve heard this is a good flick.
Quality looks good!"
,livefree68,2011-09-01T01:11Z,Sorry...I've heard this is a good flick.
,repetitiousous,2011-09-30T21:14Z,Great quality. V10 A10. But the movie sucks. I can't take a fantasy film that does not even try to create the illusion for it to be real. It's no fun to watch when you see that it's all a joke for the makers. Blah. Didn't watch more than 1/2 hours.
