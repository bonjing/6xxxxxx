This is the Boston show to the best of my abilities, not much seems to be missing other than a little at the end.   For those wondering about the NYC show #2...  I haven\'t got enough footage to feel I can release appropriately, missing much of the show, and even worse, there is a dude with a complete copy that is ace footage, but wants $20 for a copy,  thats the price Id be willing to pay for a show ($60-$100+ lol), not a recorded copy!  Also been working more than usual so thats why im slower than the 1st 6 or so shows.
