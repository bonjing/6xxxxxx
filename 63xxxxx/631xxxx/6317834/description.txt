Update April 14, 2011
----------------------

This is a re-post of the Gebarck Star torrent I posted on April 11, 2011.  The sound quality is much improved on this version, I forgot to turn on my phono preamp on the last version when transferring from the vinyl and the last version sounded very thin with very little bass frequency.  I highly recommend re-downloading this version if you downloaded prior to the date that this is posted.
