You Don't Get Paid Unless You Win

The seven remaining teams depart from the Fountain of Joy in Kolkata and fly to Varanasi, India's most holy city. Arriving at a tonga stand, a Roadblock awaited, forcing racers to find six holy men called sadhus to retrieve pieces of a phrase, assemble them, and present them to a seventh sadhu to get their next clue. Directed to the Tulsi Ghat area of town, a Detour awaited at Swaminath Akhara: teams could make 50 fuel bricks out of manure and hay and then use other bricks to "Feed the Fire" to boil milk or retrieve hay bales from across the Ganges and deliver them to a homeower to "Feed the Buffalo". Successful completion awarded the Pit Stop location: Ramnagar Fort.
