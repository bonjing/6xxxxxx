So here is Yu Gi Oh 5D's complete season 3 in ENGLISH, 

most episodes are SUBBED, but those I couldn't find, I took the DUBBED version. 

It'll make you realize how edited (censored) is the US version and how the original 

is superior (even the opening and ending themes are better). 

Enjoy!!!

I owe this release to {C_P} and PrismWeapon, thanks a million guys!

THANK YOU FOR SEEDING AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
