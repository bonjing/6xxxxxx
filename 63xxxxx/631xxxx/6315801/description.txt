Sanford & Son comedian Redd Foxx left his NBC sitcom in 1977, 
after ABC offered him a larger salary for doing this comedy 
series to premiere the following season with thankfully 
almost no singing.

Both that and the "Sanford Arms" spinoff without him 
failed that fall,although Red returned to NBC and his 
most famous role in 1980 when "Sanford" lasted 2 partial 
seasons totalling 26 episodes! Not sure why that isn't 
on DVD yet either....but I liked it a lot.

Someone recorded this off-air when it first aired back 
in the day, so it has the original commercials and ABC show promos.

Redd's guests in this show (the only one I have) are
Don Knotts, Rodney Dangerfield, and sitcom actress
Lis Hartman (then known as "Tabitha").
