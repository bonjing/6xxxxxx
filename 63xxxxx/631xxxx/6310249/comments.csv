,philos0pher,2011-05-30T00:41Z,"good themes. if you want to be able to delete particular themes do the following:
1. install the themes (apply the universal patcher before that if you did not do so already)
2. go to windows/resources/themes and copy the /themes folder to another location
3. uninstall the theme package in Programs and Features in the Control Panel
4. copy/cut & paste the /theme folder back to the original location (c:/windows/resources/
(you will need Administrative rights for that)
5. click with your right mouse button, then select Personalize. Try out different themes and delete the ones you do not want by right clicking on it and selecting delete theme (note: you cannot delete a theme you are currently using)"
