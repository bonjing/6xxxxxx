,mcordell,2011-05-02T21:40Z,"The seeding quality was absolutely amazing.  Despite the fact that I only connected to 9 seeders and 7 peers, my download speed was 250 kb/s.  Outstanding seeding quality :) !

Quality of the movie was outstanding, however in a period of 5 seconds the audio was kinda messed up (you could still hear what they were saying, it just sounded a little tinny).  Great torrent Harrharrr!

Movie 8.7/10
Quality 10/10
Sound 9.5/10"
