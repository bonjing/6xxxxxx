                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Celebrated chef Raymond Blanc invites the cameras back into his working       
 Oxfordshire kitchen to share the culinary secrets he has gathered and         
 treasured over the past thirty-five years. The programme features a range of  
 recipes for cooks of all abilities that are inspirational, yet achievable.    
                                                                               
 In this episode, Raymond demonstrates the versatility of the summers juiciest 
 fruits. To begin, a simple but impressive berry-strewn pavlova. Next a spicy  
 cherry clafloutis sees the vibrant fruit cushioned in a bed of soft, sumptuous
 pastry. A ruby red fig tart adds a touch of decadence, and for the finale     
 there is an aromatic fruit soup topped with a delicate caramel cage and light 
 bubbles of champagne.                                                         
                                                                               
 Raymond also travels to Fife to visit a traditional fruit farm to witness how 
 his favourite variety of raspberry is grown despite the temperate climate.    
                                 Enjoy!
