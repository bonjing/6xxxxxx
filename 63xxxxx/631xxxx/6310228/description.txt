Garth Brooks remains the biggest Country artist of all-time. He harnessed the Country and Pop influences of has past and created a new kind of Country that appealed to different generations of fans and crossed over into the Pop market like no other artist before him. The album's centerpiece was an all-stops-out Southern-rock cover of Billy Joel's "Shameless." Another hit single, "Rodeo," boasted a slinky Creedence-style groove. Brooks's propensity for sentimental folk-pop clichÃ©s surfaced on the ballads "What She's Doing Now" and "The River." But "We Bury the Hatchet" and "Papa Loved Mama" were tongue-in-cheek attempts at honky-tonk and truck-drivin' boogie.
