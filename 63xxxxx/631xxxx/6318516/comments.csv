Its the legit song and it sucks cock just like linkin park have since there second cd if your a fan of rock / metal or nu metal don't download this unless your looking for a pop song."
,spmt2,2011-05-14T16:55Z,"this is not a pop song ........may be not as u thought, but it's good."
,frailwordscollapse,2011-05-30T22:42Z,"Yeah and LP hasn't sucked since their second CD cause that one was Meteora. Minutes to Midnight was the first one that was kind of a let-down, but it's still good."

You can't catch up with change."
