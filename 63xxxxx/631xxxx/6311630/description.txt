     SUMMARY:
              Underwater explorers in the Baltic Sea set out to
              bring a recently discovered ghost ship - one of the
              most intact ancient wooden wrecks ever found - back to
              life. By pushing the frontiers of maritime archaeology
              and using the latest technology, the team hopes to
              recover artifacts from the ship, take measurements and
              create a 3-D model of the ship with pinpoint accuracy
              - unlocking a treasure trove of information. Read
