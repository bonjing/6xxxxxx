(wikipedia) The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer is a British 1970 cult satire film written by and starring Peter Cook, John Cleese and Graham Chapman, and directed by Kevin Billington.

An early effort from some of the Monty Python boys. This is NOT a good copy. The quality is fine, but the file is slightly corrupted. There are a few moments when the video will freeze or jump by a second.

However, the only torrent I've been able to find for this film is composed of a bunch of rars and not fully seeded. I downloaded the 96% of that torrent I could, and reconstructed and extracted the rars to get this. 

Download it if you want, given those caveats. If you do download, please seed. And if you find a better torrent, PLEASE leave a comment.
