None of the files are mine, the credits go to others. 
All the files can be found on bittorrent sites. 
All have been re-encoded and cleaned up. No attempt has been made to
"shrink" the file sizes.
This has a simple custom menu
I will seed until there are enough seeders and then will upload more.

Some of the episodes are from a Road Runner Vol 1 dvd, Vol 2 was never made so some of the episodes are from Boomerang TV. The best quality ones were chosen for this disc. Do not be put off from the fact some are tv episodes, just burn to a disc and watch on a tv screen, much better than a pc monitor.

Enjoy
