,2000550,2011-09-14T22:27Z,this may seem like a dumb question ... but how do i burn these to a dvd or convert the whole thing to an iso to mount it if possible
[T],FatFreddy44,2011-09-21T01:28Z,"200550
Download ImgBurn and install, it's free and no spyware. Never had a problem.
You can just drag n drop the file onto the icon
There is no need to convert to an iso."

Just a thought
Some of the downloads are dvd5 and dvd9 so you need the correct type of disks, but I guess you know that."
,2000550,2011-10-06T00:48Z,"Yeah I knew about the dvd9 and dvd5 disc's but I didnt want to burn to a disc but thank you for the ImgBurn comment and thank you for the torrent this was my all time favorite show growing up ... seriously, thanks I appreciate it"

,Trinitylynne,2012-04-12T00:37Z,"Does anyone know if these are the edited versions ? I guess when they remastered them to DVD, there was some censorship. I'm downloading now, but I'm not sure if I'd even recognize the censorship once I'm watching them. However, I'd LOVE to be able to watch the originals! :) Thanks!
PS-I know some of you may have ready this same comment already, I've been copy and pasting it on these old cartoon comment sections, because I'm interested in getting the originals if possible-sorry if anyone has to keep reading this! "
