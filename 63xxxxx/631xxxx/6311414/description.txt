Synopsis

Organized around functional groups, this book incorporates problem-solving help, orientation features, and complete discussions of mechanisms. Wade explains concepts without taking the unnecessary short cuts that often lead to misconceptionsâ€”his hallmark problem-solving approach includes unique strategies and hints to help readers focus on the individual steps of each reaction and how they contribute to the overall reaction. Wade also employs the most efficient method of mechanism boxes with its two-tiered approach: Mechanism and Key Mechanism Boxes. He delineates the 20 â€œKeyâ€ mechanisms that comprise nearly all of the mechanisms students will encounter. Therefore, the book takes one additional and important step in helping readers identify and grapple with the smallest number of the most important concepts to understand.
