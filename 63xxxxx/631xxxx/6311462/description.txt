Snoop Dogg first announced that he was working on a sequel to his 1993 debut album Doggystyle  during a studio session with Hip hop producer and rapper Swizz Beatz. The two stated they knocked out eighteen tracks and Snoop ended the video out saying he gave him some gangsta tracks, some R&B tracks and some Hip Hop tracks. [2][3]  Snoop Dogg called off plans to release the sequel to his classic debut Doggystyle, instead opting for the title Doggumentary Music for his 11th studio album, set for release in March 2011 on Priority/EMI Records. "I have been in the game for so long and still have the same passion I did when I first started. I want my fans to ride with me on this one and know that I am so focused on bringing good music to them," explained the veteran MC. "It's called Doggumentary Music because this is my life and I want to share my music, and my process of making it, with the fans.
