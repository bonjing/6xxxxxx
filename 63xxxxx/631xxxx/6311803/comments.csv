Thanks again"
,scott25,2011-04-26T08:15Z,"Hmm, I never came accross this, I will burn a copy myself and have a look, It might be looking at the dvd type. I will test for you. give me afew days."
,dj_metty,2011-04-26T12:25Z,no input file?????
,pipster2k,2011-05-17T17:20Z,"click on ""magnet link"" and select your torrent client if you experience ""no input file"" :-)"
,cheese_face,2011-05-26T15:53Z,"For anyone having problems with the copy protection I managed to overcome this by using daemon tools lite to mount the image, it still didn't work so I went into preferences>advanced and ticked all the boxes and now it works. Not sure exactly why that works but it did the job for me."
,arsal51310,2011-06-18T16:02Z,"cheese_face is absolutely right! all you need to do is to download the DAEMON Tools Lite from

daemon-tools.cc/eng/downloads

and then goto preferences and then advanced and check 'Advanced Emulation' it'll ask you to restart your computer, so restart it and when you log back on again goto preferences and then advanced and check all the check boxes which should be 'RMPS' 'SafeDisc' 'SecuROM' & 'LaserLock' and press Apply so that the settings can take effect. ENJOY!!!

If you find this helpful at all, don't forget to say thanks to cheese_face and me. :)"

,Huewey,2012-02-05T22:35Z,"Hi, Okay I installed this, mounted with daemon tools, then got the counterfeit message. So I went back, clicked preferences, ticked everything under the advance tab, clicked apply, and nothing has changed? I still get my counterfeit message, thus cannot install! Please, please, please help! Ive spent long enough figuring it out!"
,Huewey,2012-02-05T22:45Z,"Ok, it's working now. If you're having problems like me, just un-install old version and re-install. 

I believe my problem was, I had an old version and updated it to new version. When I uninstalled completely, then used the version cheese_face posted. Worked a charm."
