I downloaded JSRF. Burned it with Alchahol 120%.
When I put it into my Xbox Arcade it just reads as a ""mixed media disc"" with the only option - ""X - Eject""

please help. is it a problem with the xbox or the disc?"
,azerbah,2011-06-18T08:10Z,"I've lost 3 DLs for this game. Ive dont everything thats in discription. I didnt used abgx. Ive unpacked and burned with speed 2-2.4x using CloneCD.
When i put burned dvd on my 360 it says this game is for older model of XBox and its not even in game libary. 
My advice is to not download this torrent bcoz its a rip of DLs."
