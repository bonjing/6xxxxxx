The third album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released in 1979, has long been
regarded as a classic, demonstrates the musical and songwriting virtuosity of a great
frontman and his amazing backing band. A mix of rootsy American rock 'n' roll and the best of
the British invasion, of jangling Byrds guitars and Stones-like rhythms, Damn he Torpedoes
was the album that took Petty into the major league and re-defined American rock.

This programme tells the story behind the conception and recording of the album and the
transformation it made to the band's career. Using interviews, musical demonstration,
acoustic performance, archive footage and a return to the multi-tracks with the main
protagonists, it shows how Petty, Mike Campbell, Benmont Tench, Ron Blair and Stan Lynch
created their songs and sounds with the help of co-producer Jimmy Iovine and engineer
Shelly Yakus. Additional comments from journalists and other producers and musicians help
tell the story and put the album into its rightful place in rock history.

Recorded in secrecy at a time the band was fighting for creative independence amidst a legal
wrangle with their record company, the album is imbued with an anger and a gutsy attitude
the situation had created. Many songs from the album are still played live and form an
important part of Petty's body of work, including Refugee, Here Comes My Girl, Even the
Losers, Shadow of a Doubt, Louisiana Rain, Century City and top ten hit Don't Do Me Like
That.

Damn the Torpedoes hit number two in the US for seven weeks, initially selling over 2.5
million copies, and launched Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers onto the world stage and into
superstar territory, standing as one of the great records of the late 70s and early 80s.
