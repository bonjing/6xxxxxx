You should have mentioned that the extras and the menus takes up 1,6 Gb. Sadly, it seems there is no high resolution alternative on Piratebay...

I hope this is not the case with: ""Kopps.2003.MULTiSUBS.PAL.DVDR-NightLive"", otherwise it would be a major waste of time.

This is the problem with ISO:s, itÂ´s impossible to determine the quality when you canÂ´t see the main movie VOB:s - If there are at least three full ones (0,99 gb) and one close to full in a 4,3 gb release, you can be quite certain the quality is ok.

Sorry to say, but I will be hesitant to download ""NightLive:s"" ISO DVD:s in the future, unless the technical specs is attached i the description.

But downloading was really quick though!"
