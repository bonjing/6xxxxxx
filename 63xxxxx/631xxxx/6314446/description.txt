Product Description

With the same design and feature sets as the market leading Precalculus, 8/e, this addition to the Larson Precalculus series provides both students and instructors with sound, consistently structured explanations of the mathematical concepts. Designed for a two-term course, this text contains the features that have made Precalculus a complete solution for both students and instructors: interesting applications, cutting-edge design, and innovative technology combined with an abundance of carefully written exercises. In addition to a brief algebra review and the core precalculus topics, PRECALCULUS WITH LIMITS covers analytic geometry in three dimensions and introduces concepts covered in calculus.
