[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T15:51Z,"Main goal of every downloader should be: ""Get rid of bytes received"".

It goes like this: I gave one packet of bytes (data ""chunk"") away - and wait till recipient gives that to other - and I would not send next packet till one before is passed to others.

Simple, right?

Be aware, that in same time last year I endured this ""protocol"" for two months - until all leechers, except normal human beings, have been gone someplace else to shit upon others."

,Ataractic,2011-04-14T16:01Z,".. and thanks for green hornet too! 

Though my download speeds are absymal (I hardly see speeds above 10KB/s), I seed until the ratio is at least 1. My upload speeds are almost always above my download speeds- around 15KB/s. Don't know how; One of the biggest mysteries of life (:"

i completely agree with your new measures against hit and runners. they are spoiling everything here. its not accepted in a p2p site. they should understand that if no one shares what he/she has then even they dont get anything.. sharing is the basis of torrents. so everyone please give back atleast what you take"

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T18:14Z,"Initial-seeding is OVER
http://bayimg.com/HaHgpaAdj
Learn that you must exchange the bytes received or you would never ever complete the download.

That is HOW torrents should work."
,Killjoy88,2011-04-14T18:25Z,thank you for your great work!
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T18:50Z,"Discussed and announced on South.Pacific thread, worth repeating:

>>x5x5x7  at 2011-04-14 10:59 CET: 
""twentyforty - doing my bit here... as well as in seeding. 

>>abj642 at 2011-04-14 11:36 CET: 
 ""@20-40

 i always give back what i take. i hope others also learn to do that (atleast those who can do i.e. with decent connections). p2p will not survive if all become so selfish.."" 

>> twentyforty at 2011-04-14 11:42 CET: 
"" Yes, x5x5x7... you, believenu and 24-27 generous, good, normal people, you all do.

 But, I have over 20000 downloads per week, and math is simple - majority, especially newcomers, anonymous small souls just grab and run - and we both know that people always have excuses in back-pocket.

 What happens is devastating: ones for my work is dedicated to (my small-sized encodes) stay deprived as before - torrent dies as soon as I stop seeding, and I seed by nature of my payed server, max. 48h.

 For worse, most of Hit and Runs comes from the people my work is devoted to, sort of ""shooting their own leg"" is done by same people who will wonder about dead torrents, unfinished downloads and brag here about. """

>> twentyforty at 2011-04-14 12:05 CET: 
 ""I know, abj642. For example, last week ""believenu"" generously packed my new encodes of Lost Girl in one torrent, upped and seeded.
 azrielle and I joined to help, because we have episodes already - and what I have seen is sad, stupid, devastating, immoral and worse: In front of my eyes 24 people came, grab their goods and - run away.
 Torrent is dead by the birth!

 Ask ""believenu"" was it worth? Answer would be ""Yes, it was. I helped, I shared what I have and I will do it again"".

 It just proves that good people are low in numbers, but great by heart, but sadly, grab&run mentality is much more close to human hearts than majority is prepared to admit.

 When they suffer the consequence of cruelty they helped to create, they would be first to scream about or blame somebody/something else.

 In fact, HollyBolly beast throw money away, for nothing. P2P and file sharing would do ""self-implode"" anyway, without outside assistance.""
***************************************
- ""Best way you can"" - I said.
- I never asked you too seed too long or too much - just for a while, to give others opportunity, nothing more.

But - seeing how really shitty CAMs have 562 seeders for months - is devastating.
Especially idiots who come to brag about quality of my BluRay or HDTV rips of movies...

Stupid, blind, inconsiderate morons whose foam from mouths drops right into  words they type.
My encodes are NOT SO BAD, and for a truth - I don't deserve it.

""But - seeing how really shitty CAMs have 562 seeders for months - is devastating.""

yes i have also seen this many times and laughed so many times seeing the sheer no. of seeds.i am yet to understand the mentalities of the people..

""My encodes are NOT SO BAD""

just one word regarding your encodes  ""BRILLIANT"". 
may be your being modest with yourself by saying that."
,jmac85,2011-04-14T20:27Z,"Thanks for this pack. Just for the record, I'll seed these until they hit 1.5u/1d. Then, later, I'll force seed it for awhile until I get tired of it or until my upload speed drops to less than 10% of what's available. My max is like 240 kB/s (12m/2m cable)."

Is this considered hit and run if I don't seed for the life of the torrent?  Would you rather I limit my upload speed and seed longer?  Thanks for Breaking In, Justified and The Green Hornet. "

,believenu,2011-04-16T07:24Z,"for most of people who are in my situ (I have a dsl line) or those on a regular cable which is open as long as computer is on even if I am not online I am seeding torrent I have d/l even i my sleep I am sharing with others . It realy is, for anyone who does not have a limited internet service(I would say a lot or most in The largest country in North America) easy to share .just leave utorrent running(or whatever one you use) .. check to see if it needs a forced start and go to bed. even if you have laptop.. just plug it in turn it on and go to bed it is simple and easy I leave it there until whenever and I only have a computer with 75Gb so if I can do it...
At the end of the week when this genus(20-40) does his weekly pack you can add it to his but d/l torrent select none or one you missed or would like to try and the rest would seed automatically..I know this has been explained too many times to mention but come on everyone give me a break .I am a true beginner at this but even I can do it.. 
remember SEEDING IS SHARING. "
