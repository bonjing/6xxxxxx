A great big hole in the bottom of my shoes
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey let me be your salty dog

Listen here Sal, well I know you
Rundown stockin' and a worn out shoe
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Down in the wildwood sittin' on a log
Finger on the trigger and eye on the hog
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Pulled the trigger and they said go
Shot fell over in Mexico
Honey, let me be you salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog

Let me be your salty dog
Or I won't be your man at all
Honey, let me be your salty dog"
