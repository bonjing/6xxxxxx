
 Hollywood Undead is a rap rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2005. The band originated in 2005 from a song titled "The Kids" that Deuce and J-Dog posted on the band's Myspace profile to positive reviews, leading them to form the group Hollywood Undead with their friends Johnny 3 Tears, Charlie Scene, Funny Man, Da Kurlzz and Shady Jeff. They later made Shady Jeff leave, leaving the band with only six members. In their first nine weeks on MySpace they had almost a million plays and by 2006 they were said to be leading MySpace's top unsigned artists list with over 8 million plays.
And not long ago they also had Deuce leave the band.
