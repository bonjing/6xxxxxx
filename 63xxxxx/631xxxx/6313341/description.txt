   BrÃ¶derna Karlsson (2010)

  The Karlsson Brothers is a "confusion" comedy about two identical-twin 
  brothers, each initially unaware of the other's existence. One brother 
  is a successful, perfectionist lawyer living in Stockholm. The other 
  brother lives in the North of Sweden with a wife and children, and is 
  a notoriously unfaithful ne'er-do-well. The brothers meet for the first 
  time as they go through their deceased mother's estate. Their meeting 
  leads to a series of challenging mix-ups, turning both their lives on end. 
  The brothers' differences prove gradually to be a source of strength, and 
  their newfound friendship will change their lives forever.
