,425paul,2011-04-11T18:38Z,Why are the seeds all offline?
,tealc89,2011-04-11T21:20Z,First time using this site to create a torrent.
,RITphoto,2011-04-11T22:10Z,"Thanks so much. Downloading now, will report back after I install them all. Great of someone to release updated versions!"
,RITphoto,2011-04-11T22:32Z,"That is, if anyone seeds...there are 2 and neither are makin' moves."
,425paul,2011-04-12T01:35Z,"There are NO seeders. We can't download without seeders. If you can't seed, then don't post stuff."
,425paul,2011-04-12T01:36Z,There are NO seeders. Please find some.
,RITphoto,2011-04-12T05:48Z,"I've seeded the 20% that I did get. My ratio is 6.5. However, I can't get the other 80% because OP won't seed. Come on now."
,tealc89,2011-04-12T06:44Z,"Guys, tell me how to seed this and I will, again this is my first time creating, let alone posting a torrent"
,vestidual,2011-04-12T09:41Z,Everything works except serial for colorEfexpro. Any ideas?
,RITphoto,2011-04-12T13:26Z,"Everything worked fine for me. Except I have one question; when installing Dfine (noise reduction), there are 2 photoshop plugins in another folder. what are these? They're in a folder called ""XiDenoiser"""
,tealc89,2011-04-12T19:27Z,Don't worry about those plugins. I saw them too and didn't do anything with them. Dfine still works perfectly.
,Brmatt,2011-04-13T00:56Z,"Also stuck on the Color Efex serials... Everything else works, though! +1"
,o0pp0o,2011-04-13T06:54Z,"Pls help!! I'm using cs5, after installing any of the plug-ins I PS will not start. but once i uninstill them than PS starts as per normal. Pls help me if you can... :("

Can you tell me how to get an installation ID in order to generate the Kengen?

Thank you!!!"
,david1688,2011-04-20T05:47Z,"tealc89,

I have made HDR working using your X-force kengen.  Now only Viveza.2 did not work.  there is no kengen for this one and replace the .dll file seems make no difference.  It appears to be a kengen is required to activate the software.

Thank you!"
,from666hell,2011-04-20T20:40Z,"@David 1688
Viveza should work fine just by replacing the right crack.It did for me anyway."

,umim,2011-04-25T20:03Z,"That README file is in RUSSIAN LANGUAGE and it is a proof of ignorance! tealc89,TRANSLATE IT,please!"
,LowKey01,2011-05-06T05:02Z,"Ok, what the fuck? you put the description in ENGLISH so clearly this wasn't intended for russians only. Translate the damn language, how the fuck are you gonna make us download this thing, and only to find out all the read me's are in russian, I do appreciate your upload but really. TRANSLATE."
,chickfuck,2011-05-15T19:05Z,thank you
,nicora100,2011-05-19T07:13Z,"I see the question many times

How will i generate the installation ID or what is the installation ID for HDR? 

I do not get an acces code

Please help
"
,loop01,2011-05-24T13:08Z,"Ok...worked it out.
After install, open the application.
A registration form will come up.
Click on PHONE REGISTRATION.
This will give you an installation ID.
Type it into the XFORCE crack and hit generate.
This will give you the serial and phone activation code.

ENJOY"
