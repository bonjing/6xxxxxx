The video is very dark and lacks of gamma. It's hard to notice background stuff and you really gotta look carefully which gives you headache. 

The audio is very poor, it's a lot distorted and sometimes you can't hear what they're saying and if you're trying to max the volume you just hear a louder distortion which fucks up your ears. However, the audio is on synch as what I noticed.

This is as expected from a cam. My advice is, wait for better quality. I've heard that this movie is good, don't waste your experience on such poor quality."
