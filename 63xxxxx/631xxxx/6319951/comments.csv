,bongo264,2011-04-19T22:24Z,Works like a champ!! You need to apply the fix in the previous link...
,Zagraab,2011-04-21T21:28Z,"can anyone play story mode?

when i try it freezes"
,Zagraab,2011-04-21T21:31Z,is the story mode working for anyone?
,iscy,2011-04-22T03:42Z,This is a bad torrent. Get the one from consolasatope and the fix I created. The fix is only 1 kb and will make that other one works like a charm on 3.55 KMEAW. I can confirm that story mode is working well. I'm currently at chapter 4.
,Zagraab,2011-04-22T12:19Z,"i got this one working, with eboot fix, but the story mode freezes, its wierd

anyway, why do i need to download tthe param.sfo?  Rogero manager patches it itself.

Also, the one from consolasatope doesnt need the eboot fix? 

Thank you for the help"
,iscy,2011-04-22T16:58Z,"@Zagraab If your loader can fix it, then you won't need it. Many people (like me) are still using Gaia which is very simple and doesn't modify PARAM.SFO.

If you run on a 3.55 CFW, you don't need a ""fixed"" EBOOT... the original works. Also, make sure you got ""UP1018-BLUS30522_00-MORTALKOMBATPTCH-A0101-V0101-PE.pkg"" installed."
,whataflyguy,2011-04-23T06:05Z,story mode works fine for me. 
,Arianz,2011-04-23T22:43Z,Could someone post me a tutorial on how to do this honestly i have pirated many pc games b4 but this is my first time for a console and the only reason i wan't to start doing this is for Mortal Kombat i tested the Demo and i fell in love with the game instantly. So please write down a tutorial or send one for me and ill be grateful. Many thanks your friendly gamer on PSN //T00THP1CK3R
,Arianz,2011-04-23T22:46Z,Could someone post me a tutorial on how to do this i so want to get this game but i dunno how to do shit like this on console only on pc i would be grateful many thanks.
,Zagraab,2011-04-26T01:27Z,"@whataflyguy

i installed pacth - changed param with rogero manager - changed eboot and the game works, but not the story mode

,scgpromotv,2011-05-01T09:56Z,got questions need help? message me utube username :scgsouth
,Damian1373,2011-05-21T19:22Z,"I just have one question..? Why does it say ""3D TV compatibility"" in the description when other sources have told me that this isn't 3D and I can't find the option to turn 3D on in the game's options?"

,remedy2,2011-06-26T09:06Z,"Can't get this to work on US PS3 Fat 3.55 internal HD.  Did the patch, not sure how to do this.  Messed around with the SFO file, it is 3.50 to begin with and I changed it to 3.55.  I just don't this this works on my console."

I download movies and burn them a lot for my son to watch but how would I make a ps3 game after I download it? Like how do I take the download from the computer to the ps3? The games can not be burnt on dvds can they? I'm sorry, I'm new to this. Could anyone tell me what I would need to buy or do to get the games from the computer to the ps3??

External HD:
1-Copy the game to ""GAME"" folder.
2-Install the patch
3-Enjoy =D
Internal HD
1-Copy the game to your internal HD with multiman or awesome files manager
2-Rename the game from ""BLUS-30522"" to ""BLUS30522""
3-Enjoy

P.S. DO NOT SAY WHAT U DON'T KNOW, ASK FIRST. IT'S WORKING 100%. Any doubt, just let me know"
,mlmbit,2012-06-01T20:57Z,"I forgot, on internal HD, after rename, you must to install the patch."
