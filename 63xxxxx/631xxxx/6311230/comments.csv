You had stolen the horrorspoke's torrent and uploaded yourself.

Thats a blody cheap torrenting."

I haven't ""stolen"" anyone's torrent, horrorspoke's is a scene release from which he deleted 2 files, I simply uploaded the complete release (which, btw, I already mentioned in the description).
Furthermore, your ""high quality"" 320k rip is a 128k webrip re-encode (something I also already mentioned in the description)."

,pilot234,2011-04-29T15:51Z,"Petesapai, I really wish for you to lose your skull.You're a f***** third rate troll who visits other uploader's torrents and leaves false comments. A cheap way of going about promoting yourself, but nothing better is expected of your kind."
[T],PeteSapai,2011-05-01T16:21Z,"@pilot234: wtf are you talking about? I never leave false comments, whenever I leave a negative comment (which, btw, is always about the torrent, never do I insult an uploader just because I don't agree with him) it is legit, and I only ""promote"" my own torrents when the other torrent is low quality. I can hear the difference between quality and 128k (or re-encoded from 128k) mp3 or files cut off at 16kHz. It's fine if you can't, I'm not leaving those comments for people like you, it's for people who (no insult whatsoever intended) have better hearing."
