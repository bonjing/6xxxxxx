I know there already are a million of these on TPB (well, actually, it's about 20), but nearly all of them are either direct web-rips (128k, high frequencies cut off, low quality) or a (usually 320kbps - so far none of the 320 rips are real) re-encode of these web-rips.

Furthermore, I know this particular rip has also been uploaded twice, and I usually don't upload duplicates. However, I like scene releases and I like them to be complete, and those other 2 are missing the 'proof' pics. If you don't care, that's ok, this is for the people that do :)

Anyway, enjoy this! And if you think this isnt enough bits, get one of these:
