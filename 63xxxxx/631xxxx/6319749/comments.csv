[V],globeplus,2011-04-16T00:37Z,"Scream 4 (stylized as SCRE4M) is an American slasher film and the fourth installment in the Scream series. It was directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson, writer of Scream and Scream 2. It stars an ensemble cast of David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Emma Roberts and Hayden Panettiere. Campbell, Arquette and Cox are the only returning cast members from the previous films.

Originally, the series was intended to be a trilogy, but after ten years, Bob Weinstein thought it was time for another film. It is intended to be the first of a new trilogy, with both Craven and Williamson signed on for the duration. Filming began in and around Ann Arbor, Michigan on June 28, 2010 and ended September 24, 2010. It was released on April 15, 2011."

,m0r1arty,2011-04-16T09:23Z,"It's in Russian, no subs for English and is a poor quality cam job."
,warlock2204,2011-04-16T13:38Z,"dont bother to download it.

[V],globeplus,2011-04-16T14:23Z,"Hi , as usual are always unhappy users for some reason , well it is true that the audio it is in russian because unfornatly is no valid files with english audio for the moment and it is a movie that it is only starting on the theatres but beside that i have to honestly give my congratulations to the guy that shooted this cam , it is a really excelent work , keep like that and the Dub plugins work was very nice correcting a little unfocus particles on the picture background and turning more alive the colors giving a general nice ambience to the viewer , it was really the best possible work under the circunstances but the audio in russian and maybe can take a while the english audio but if someone knows something useful that can help please be free to put the links on this comments .

Cheers ."
,m0r1arty,2011-04-16T17:35Z,"Hey globeplus, firstly thanks for the upload. I was just stating that it was real, in Russian and not very good quality. It is the real deal and I thank you hugely for getting this out there- I'm not complaining.

I just don't speak Russian - I would have watched it though in English, it wasn't terrible quality considering how long the film has been available and I'm sure many Russian speakers will be very happy.

I'm still seeding and hope to see a version which I understand shortly.

Thanks again."
,hostile84,2011-04-16T17:49Z,Don't bother unless you understand Russian.
[V],globeplus,2011-04-16T20:17Z," To m0r1arty : the ideak is to see cams in english nice shooted soon as possible too but unfornatly that it is not possible many times , needing to wait for that be possible with subtitles with the correct synchronisation applied on the picture do the trick too and that it is the best shot to watch the movie for the moment , Thank you for your comments ."
,Krille152,2011-04-16T21:12Z,"i wounder.. does anyone read the infobox or even the title? It says (in a very clear way) that its Russian and still ppl act like ""uuuuhh..mmm.... this must be in English.. uuuhhhuhuuu"" and then they get upset coz it's not in English.. make perfect sense =)

Thx for the up globeplus, even thu its no point for me to dl this (but im sure u made alot of ppl happy with this up)"
,flextm71,2011-04-16T22:45Z,"Well, considering the majority of us speak english, not russian, we have every right to complain."
,somebodyelse222,2011-04-17T00:21Z,"The arrogance is breathtaking - ""I speak English, most people speak English so because of that anything else is unacceptable...""

Thanks for the up, well done for being the first.

Next it will be, 'Well, it's only A/V 9/8, so not good enough'. Guys, if you don't like the (free) offering, go out and do better - it's that simple. 

If you can't or won't, STFU.

,Kilwish,2011-04-17T01:28Z,"Being that the movie is FREE, you don't have any right to complain. If its that big of an issue go watch it in theaters or wait until it comes to DVD. "
,hostile84,2011-04-17T01:46Z,@ krille152 stfu I was just letting people who DONT read that shit to not dl...most people just skip to the comments.
,hostile84,2011-04-17T01:47Z,Buncha cry babies on this bitch
,blusniffer,2011-04-17T02:26Z,"LMAO english speaking d'loaders saying thanks for a russian audio movie.
Look most of us give the normal thanks for torrents but u idiots who drop to your knees + bow everytime some guy/gal uploads a syllable need to go d'load some self-respect.

I only send the love when a torrent is watchable without the aid of an optician!!  lol"
,Krille152,2011-04-17T06:26Z,"@hostile84:
It's kind of bad if ppl don't even read the title before skipping to the comments, how do they even know what movie then are downloading? =)

@blusniffer:
Well, it does happens that ppl have used a russian/french torrent and sync the audio from a english one if the video is way to bad on it.
And even if thats not happening, whats wrong with saying thx to someone who actually breaks the law to let ppl see movies for free?"
,P2P-ftw,2011-04-17T08:07Z,"idiots are idiots or noobs, its is what it is, some wont ever get the process nor understand terminology.  If they ever grasp scene vs P2P in this day and age, itll be amazing!!  If I cap some cam audio when I see this, some would think I can make a TS, heh... FAIL!"
,m0r1arty,2011-04-17T09:16Z,"To the butthurts out there who always make the comments section more enjoyable to read because t's a reflection upon who comprises most of the outspoken section of our community:

I downloaded this to see if it was the real deal.  I commented upon it as to it's quality and mentioned there were no subtitles - something unstated in either title or description.

Why don't you thank everyone who enables you to get the quality and content your require rather than cry because you want to suck your dad's cock hoping to taste your mother's pussy again?"
,SwTc-klupido,2011-04-17T21:21Z,"bad sound,
bad video,
language russians xD"
[V],globeplus,2011-04-18T00:34Z,"To peeyoosh : do the next thing because it is impossible to me to upload the game anymore or seed , i donÂ´t have the file :

- copy with the right click mouse the folder with 99.8% with the game to the desktop then try use it like that following the txt with the instructions if you have it , check if you use the utorrent for example on the files tab , what is the file or files affected for the missing 0.2 % maybe doesnÂ´t really matter the missing block , sometimes files without seeds can get stucked by a circunstancial imprudence from the one of the remaining seeds , just analise this possibilitys without this mean that it will be ok or not to run the game . GOOD LUCK !!"
