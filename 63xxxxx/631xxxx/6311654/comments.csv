Sorry for the muck up, but it does work."

,roguetr,2012-04-04T04:58Z,"Files are not corrupt, as stated by the author they are ENCRYPTED.

Unfortunately no program on windows other than DVD Decrypter was able to detect this.

If you download this torrent, mount it with daemon tools, recreate the iso by ripping the mounted image through DVD Decrypter and all will be well.

Alternatively, find an image that isn't encrypted or submit your own :)"
