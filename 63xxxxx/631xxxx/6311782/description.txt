Kurt Vile is a guitarist and singer from Philadelphia. He was signed by Matador Records as a solo artist in May 2009.

His music has been likened to that of Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger and Tom Petty. His first album for Matador Records is titled Childish Prodigy. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, Sonic Youth bassist and singer Kim Gordon was asked, "Your guilty pleasure right now?" Gordon replied, "Listening to Kurt Vile's latest CD, Childish Prodigy. Guilty because I listen to it too much..."

Vile released two previous solo albums, God Is Saying This To You and Constant Hitmaker, on Mexican Summer and Woodsist, respectively. He plays solo shows as well as shows with a backing band called The Violators.

Vile's "He's Alright" is featured during the credits of Eastbound & Down in the second season's finale. Vile has been chosen by Animal Collective to perform at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival that they will curate in May 2011.

Smoke Ring For My Halo is Kurt Vile's fourth album and second official release for Matador Records. It was released on March 8, 2011.
