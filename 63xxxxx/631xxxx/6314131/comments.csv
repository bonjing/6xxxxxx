Easily Marvel's best series in a long time...You've got a lot of individual episodes and the main threat that ends the season is sprinkled about throughout the run. And it sets up next year with an obvious ""Secret Invasion"" story line...bring it!"

I didnt know that this show existed until Netflix recommended it - It is amazing!!! The voice acting and writing are superb - You actually feel like these characters are real and have real interactions not like many other superhero cartoons where you really cant relate or its so phony. Well done. :D"
