i used soundspectre's serial: Z504-3S3G8-2CGXD-GXNH8-X9ZLH

,Millerdis100,2011-04-16T09:45Z,"@ a1adin

Yes, the latest patch for arma 2 is 1.09 and it works fine with arrowhead.

The serial Z504-3S3G8-2CGXD-GXNH8-X9ZLH works also fine when you install. But it comes a problem when you try to patch OA and Reinforcements with the 1.59 patch.

But when you want to install OA with this serial then i don't think it would work at all."

and everone else this cracked version does not work, yes it installs fine and you can play it but fade is active which makes targeting impossible, hopefully a way to bypass it or a working crack comes soon,    also the only version of arma 2 that works is the reloaded version, im currently playing it on 1.09 with the ace 2 mod,    and operation arrow head works flawlessly with the mini image method which i explain in earlier posts..... hope this ones cracked proper soon :)"

,Reviewer,2011-04-19T21:19Z,"Just to confirm all the previous comments, this game does in fact have this FADE thing active on it when you use the crack. It will cause you to have inaccurate aim and the phrase 'Illegal copies may degrade"" will appear on screen during gameplay. This only happened when my computer was connected to the internet, and disappeared when I disconnected the internet, so maybe that has something to do with it.

However so far the game is still playable. Aim is inaccurate from far but up close shots can still hit targets. Plus I use my team mates to take out most of the enemies, I just like to give the orders and use stealth tactics. You can still drive and fly so the game isn't complete rubbish."
,Reviewer,2011-04-20T05:19Z,"-UPDATE-

For those who have a FADE problem, I simply went into my Firewall Advanced settings, and made an Inbound and Outbound rule who blocks Arma 2 server's IP, or whatever this IP those, and after that, I never had any FADE problem with Arma 2 and Arma OA. The only thing is that you won't be able to see any Arma 2 multiplayer servers, but I guess it isn't a problem eh? ;)

The IP is : 
From =>207.38.0.0 
           and 
To=>207.38.225.225

This applies for Inbound as well for Outbound rules. I know that if you allow the outbound but not the inbound, you'll be able to see multiplayer servers, but still won't be able to play.

Or get the game for their enjoyment without giving credit to the developer for making this outstanding game arma 2 alone you will spend about 30-100 hours on campaign probably good 15 on editor and a good few hundred hours on multiplayer with the modding and such you will have limitless options in this game:P i not tellin you guys not to torrent its just this game is not torrent worthly because it is so good:) 
,Comrade_Nikolai,2011-06-25T01:21Z,"http://www.arma2.com

The game is free, they just launched a free to play version, at the bottom of the page once ur get to the free arma section, are the mirriors to download, they only took a little out of it, and not include mods, but in return they allow DETICATED servers, to play online for FREE! :))))))) EVERYONE GO CHECK IT OUT, the more people we can get playing online for free the better, and this is legal DIRECRLTY from them"

,MrGoy,2011-08-20T18:58Z,"ArmA 2 programers team deserve to be paid for their awsome job. This is not the problem. The problem is that it seems they beat the crackers comunity. I doubt anyone could crack the FADE protection technique till now. I was wondering what is wrong with the craker fellas. Are you lazy to debbug the game DURING its execution and NOT ONLY during its installation? Because the real verification and checking stuff occurs while the game is ALREADY running. If I had the skills, I would do it by myself, but unfortunatelly this is not the case. I hope you gentleman get the power over the officers and make the underground world shine and raise again.

This crack doesn't work for me. Random shot spots problem.

See ya."
,who6988,2011-08-21T18:40Z,this has a RAT program in the files you have to open to copy skidrow files. for all of you that don't know what a RAT is its a trojan that lets you take over another computer it is the poison ivy RAT came right up on my anti virus so plz download at own risk 
,iahd,2011-08-24T04:00Z,How do I paste the files from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation?
,iahd,2011-08-24T04:01Z,How do I paste the filed from the SKIDROW folder to the game installation?
,josh109,2011-09-04T11:22Z,Will this work with the PAD Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA and still play online with the PAD Arma 2 OA?

,lolzillaXD,2011-09-07T05:14Z,"hey moeburn does that one work??

i dont wanna spend four hours downloading it just to see that its also screwed by that FADE bullshit like all the other cracked version out there.

plz answer, i wanna play this game!!"
,Sivos,2011-09-07T12:53Z,"@lolzillaXD

I just downloaded it, apparently it's kind of fake, but not really fake.  It's the free version of the game, but unlike the actual full version, it just has multiplayer and map editing.  Also, it lacks HD graphics, a campaign, modding, or putting on addons.  

http://free.arma2.com/activation/index.jsp?nonce=ac496af4aa7ca9a6c2701cee584ee3279ec48e469d352918e0432946b7ebd96c

There is more details right there.  I would just stick with this torrent and not venture off anywhere else.  I only downloaded the free one because it was only a 15 minute download for me and I was curious.  When it started I noticed it was only a few MBs in size, so I figured this was just too good to be true (given that this torrent is almost 8 GiBs).

This torrent does work, if anyone says otherwise they are just simply inexperienced and got stuck.  If you are worried about how long it will take to download, just leave it on all night while you sleep or whenever you are at work.  That way, you'll have something else to look forward to.

Hope that helped :D"
,lolzillaXD,2011-09-08T00:16Z,"Thx  sivos

welp then ill download both. im 70% done on this one and as soon as its complete ima download that one too.

really thx for the response"
,Sivos,2011-09-08T04:00Z,"@lolzillaXD

WAIT!  Don't download this torrent, I spoke too soon.  I submitted that comment after playing the first two tutorials thinking it was okay, then I went to sleep.  I just realized that this torrent is nuked with a fade, apparently is really is important to read previous comments, lol (I usually don't because it mostly consists of people calling this torrent fake or what not, lol).

DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION!!!!

The fade is a anti-crack thing for pirated games meaning you cannot shoot in a first person shooter game with this.

Currently I'm downloading http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6433693/ARMA_II_Reinforcements_%28good_working_FADE-free_copy and according to some comments and other places I've read, this one is fade free.  Your best bet would be to try that one out first, otherwise you might find yourself redownloading it over and over.  Sorry to say this one worked."
,lolzillaXD,2011-09-11T05:11Z,"lol ok sivos i was 70% done with this one, 

ill chekc the other one out

thx"
,ampageg,2011-09-11T22:42Z,"okay i usually dont comment on these but as posted before, THIS TORRENT IS DANGEROUS. I ended up with a backdoor trojan from this torrent. I somehow doubt that this was actually uploaded by skidrow."
,Gaastra_NAC,2011-09-12T23:58Z,"works great thank you for upload, the only thing i can't manage to work is playing on multiplayer, i get all session "" servers "" with a interogation like this "" ? "" in yellow, can anyone help me for that, .."
,us01,2011-09-24T07:18Z,"Oh hi, i will be using a generated serial over the skidrow. Wonder if the skidrow will allow online play."
,us01,2011-09-25T18:23Z,"bloop checking comments, now reveal!!! all"
,us01,2011-09-25T23:35Z,writting so i can see all comment
,us01,2011-09-26T19:33Z,"Game works.

Install with kegen serials, patch, done. No need crackpath. Online dont work off course you need serial that is in their database.

Don't know if FADE is active, i think this game just has slightly bad aiming but nothing too extreme very playable.

Is your mom hot?"
,humanboot,2011-10-09T05:11Z,"Okay, I've downloaded this, but I don't want to waste my bandwidth just to see another version fail. Anyone have a fix for FADE? I'm getting the accuracy problem and it makes everything unplayable..."
,TobNor,2011-10-16T16:12Z,"Is it possible to play with *only* this? not any other versions, or do i need a main game thing?"
,TobNor,2011-10-16T16:15Z,"Oh sorry, didnt read good enougth ;)"
,1389,2011-10-23T10:30Z,THANKS WORKS PERFECTLY
,efrenzy_15,2011-10-30T19:12Z,after the first scene i can do nothing my friend.what should i do?
,madaritisA,2011-12-13T11:02Z,Hello..!!!! it is playing online..????? 
,pokgais,2011-12-31T21:02Z,"Definitely FADE protected, the aiming is largely affected, and it is impossible to play effectively. Bullets will stray far from your cross hairs. Don't waste your time downloading this."
,conewizard,2012-02-03T10:21Z,i hardly comment on torrents but this one is fucked. installed a few days ago and its raping my computer with viruses. do not download
,zolfi3,2012-02-07T08:19Z,If you got problems getting this to work download operation arrowhead and lunch it and then this will automaticly be applied as an expansion.
