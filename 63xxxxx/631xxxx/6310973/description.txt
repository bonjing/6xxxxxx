BBC Spiral (Engrengaes) Series 3

Now reaching cult status in the English speaking world, this gritty French drama focuses upon the interactions of the police, the judiciary and the world of crime in one of the seediest Parisian suburbs. Engrenages translates into the English word 'gears', symbolising wheels within wheels, and this series delivers just that;- The Police and Judicairy (Justifiably) breaking the law and cutting corners to catch a serial killer who abducts women before dissecting them, and with corrupt politicains thrown into the mix, it all kicks off again.
