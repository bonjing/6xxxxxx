,Joshperz,2011-07-24T06:54Z,The audio is kinda crappy when the video has higher pinched sounds is that normal.. non the less im seeding and it works..
,Z_V,2011-09-03T22:59Z,@LJUSALF  That's the same thing. There is absolutely no difference. When the computer asks if you want to replace the file it also deletes it when you tell it yes. LoL.
,trialboj,2011-09-08T16:41Z,"THX, i hope i'll work 4 me too :D"
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-09-17T11:54Z,"The instructions are flawed. Please try giving all the details next time.

The program is having trouble working properly. I put the crack in the proper place and everything, but the downloads won't complete. I'll try tinkering with it a bit to see if I can get it to work..."
,Mr.Wolfe,2011-09-17T12:10Z,"No, I tried everything I could think of and it didn't work for me. Maybe it's a problem with Vista. I uninstalled the program now."

,mafeki,2012-01-09T04:48Z,"You don't need this software to get youtube videos. Just go to the link follow the instructions your internet browser automatically saves flash videos to a cache so all you need to do is open up your bowers cache directory open the files with VLC it wont have the proper extension but VCL opens them anyway If it's what you want make sure the video is done loading change the extension to .fla bust out AVS then convert it to a practicle format. I did it with chrome
