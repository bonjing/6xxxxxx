 A true classic music comedy dancing love and themes of predjudce and racism. "

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T10:28Z,"This is NOT a download site,
this is FILE SHARING SITE.

IF PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO STAY AND SEED 
AFTER THEIR BELLY IS FULL

TORRENT DIES!!!

Last 30 days I have steady 99% of Hit&Runs.

It cannot be forever.

ANTI HIT&&RUN MEASURES ARE ACTIVE NOW!!!

SORRY FOR ""COLLATERAL"" DAMAGE.

AND - NO REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN TILL FURTHER NOTICE."
,x5x5x7,2011-04-14T10:59Z,"@people - Understand. If twentyforty is writing in ALL CAPS ... he has had enough. Seed --> simple. 

@twentyforty - doing my bit here... as well as in seeding."
,abj642,2011-04-14T11:36Z,"@20-40

i always give back what i take. i hope others also learn to do that (atleast those who can do i.e. with decent connections). p2p will not survive if all become so selfish.."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T11:42Z,"Yes, x5x5x7... you, believenu and 24-27 generous, good, normal people, you all do.

But, I have over 20000 downloads per week, and math is simple - majority, especially newcomers, anonymous small souls just grab and run - and we both know that  people always have excuses in back-pocket.

What happens is devastating: ones for my work is dedicated (small-sized encodes) stay deprived as before - torrent dies as soon as I stop seeding, and I seed by nature of my payed server, max.  48h.

For worse, most of Hit and Runs comes from the people my work is devoted to, sort of ""shooting their own leg"" is done by same people who will wonder about dead torrents, unfinished downloads and brag here about."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T12:05Z,"I know, abj642. For example, last week ""believenu"" (Jane) generously packed my new encodes of Lost Girl in one torrent, upped and seeded.
azrielle and I joined to help, because we have episodes already - and what I have seen is sad, stupid, devastating, immoral and worse: In front of my eyes 24 people came, grab their goods and - run away.
Torrent is dead by the birth!

Ask Jane was it worth? Answer would be ""Yes, it was. I helped, I shared what I have and I will do it again"".

It just proves that good people are low in numbers, but great by heart, but sadly, grab&run mentality is much more close to human hearts than majority is prepared to admit.

When they suffer the consequence of cruelty they helped to create, they would be first to scream about or blame somebody/something else.

In fact, HollyBolly beast throw money away, for nothing. P2P and file sharing would do ""self-implode"" anyway, without outside assistance."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-14T13:20Z,"P2P/Hacker ethos has been subsumed/swarmed by petty thief/survivalist mentality.  If that is now the case, Public file sharing will soon cease to exist.  Becomes ""every man for himself""."
,semperlol,2011-04-14T20:13Z,could you please uplaod The Passion Of Jeanne of Arc(1928)?
,semperlol,2011-04-14T20:15Z,"sorry just saw that you dont take any requests for now,no offence"
,believenu,2011-04-16T07:34Z,"Yes it was worth it I just hope people realise that what goes around comes around I will contunue to u/l. some of the things I have I am still figuring out some stuff and will continue..I am not able to share a lot in this world but this is so easty to do. Anyone with a dsl or direct cable and no limits on u/l can just leave torrent(computer on please)running (force start if necessary) and go to bed , go to work , cook meals , no huhu no complicated procedure just sharing with someone else.. "
,geoffp,2012-01-02T15:48Z,"With only 3 seeders, the ranting by twentyforty is obviously wasted.lol "
,pgcorps,2012-05-13T14:25Z,Please seed. Been looking for this for ages. :(
