Credits goes to whoever made this... \/"

,is_there_no_one_else,2011-07-03T12:06Z,"They're in mp3 format, not .wav.  Huge difference."
,mediaferret,2011-08-05T09:27Z,"Are you blind? ""They're in WAV format"" when every filename ends in mp3. Seriously, get your eyes checked."

*SIGH*

Anyway, thanks for this. I have been looking for sound effects for my audio sketches, as well as for certain musical aspects."
