For 'Delta Crossroads', Robert Lockwood Jr., a former student of Robert Johnson, returns to his Delta blues roots. This 16-track album features Lockwood with only his 12-string acoustic guitar. It is rather strange hearing old Delta blues sung by one of its originals on a modern recording. All of the notes from the guitar are clear. Plus, his voice isn't scuffed up by the scratches and pop of the vinyl recording. Lockwood plays a mix of Robert Johnson tunes, a few of his own, and some blues standards including 'C.C. Rider'. With its high production quality and Lockwood's unique and possibly near-extinct style of singing, 'Delta Crossroads' is a strong testament to the endurance of a Delta blues original.
