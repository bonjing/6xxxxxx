,frogshare,2011-06-08T14:26Z,"Don't be confused by the screenshots. These are the original frame sizes, looking distorted. But when the movie is being played, it will display correctly with the correct aspect ratio / size."
,ramalan,2011-06-14T20:12Z,"If you're looking for the best copy out there, get this torrent. All other torrents I tried have a hazy and fuzzy picture.

But the quality of Bearden_Phantom's rip is very good. Especially when considering the source. As far as I know, for this movie there are no high quality sources available yet.

File size is ok, too. Because this movie needs more bitrate, so that you can actually enjoy the beautiful rainforest scenes. 

Thank you, phantom :)"
