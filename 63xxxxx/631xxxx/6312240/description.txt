"Chuck Versus The Family Volkoff" 

A bad day gets worse when Sarah (Yvonne 
Strahovski) throws Chuck (Zachary Levi) 
a surprising relationship curveball as 
the CIA orders Vivian Volkoff (guest 
star Lauren Cohan) assassinated. In 
order to prove Vivian's innocence, 
Chuck must put his trust in a dangerous 
ally her father Alexei Volkoff (guest 
star Timothy Dalton). Meanwhile, Ellie 
(Sarah Lancaster) suspects that her 
mother (guest star Linda Hamilton) is 
interfering with the search into her 
father's past.

Enjoy :)
