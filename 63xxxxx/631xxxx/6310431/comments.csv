REQUESTS WOULD BE TAKEN FROM REGULAR 
DOWNLOADERS ONLY. MAKE YOURSELF PRESENT.
PLAIN, COMMON, SHORT ""Thanks"" is better
accepted than ambiguous or stupid comments.

I can see your words only - not picture of yours (figure of speech, meaning - I don't know who you are, never met any of you and heard no ""character"" witnesses of yours).

Upfront, to tell you the truth: defending me when insults or stupidities are left as Comments - would give you dozen plus points automatically, and contrary to that - ignoring those and letting them on my concern, to waste my time and energy - deducts equal amount... "
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T10:31Z,"I'd go for this, but no room on the hard drive.  Superb movie, nonetheless."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T10:44Z,@formerly_azrielle: You should burn it on empty DVDR disks. 10 pieces (43 GB of storage space) is nowadays 2.2 bucks or less. I wish I have done so.
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-11T11:20Z,"OK, I can do that--just have to set up my portable DVD burner.  Don't expect I'll be seeding too long, so I'm downloading all the subs until I get it recorded, since it will be only temp storage."
,sandhu125,2011-04-11T12:35Z,Not into this genre !! Will wait for your next upload !! 
,rajmxxx,2011-04-11T13:18Z,"dear 20-40 i have downloaded your each and every torrent. please upload my requests
TAXI 2004 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316732/
ANACONDA 1997 - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118615/"
,vkrishzz,2011-04-11T13:27Z,i have read the story of this movie.....seems interesting...i will download it...
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T14:24Z,"@rajmxxx: I answered you already regarding Taxi, and Anaconda fits right in:

""Do NOT request movies which have IMDB score lower than 4.4.""

But - Anaconda is not bad, Jlo and Keri Wuhrer especially,  Ice, Jon Voight or Eric Stoltz are good too and probably low IMDB came from idiots who hate one of the actors...
So, Anaconda has go, Taxi no-go. 
Till weekend."

[V],twentyforty,2011-04-11T15:48Z,"@yalla33 :I love you too, but that movie never was released as BluRay - and regarding his old full-screen aspect ratio 4:3 I cannot encode nice rip and smaller than 800-1000 MB (even if BluRay exist).

looks as more reasonable choice."

,alexegovich,2011-04-12T01:16Z,"Congratulations, I have your website in my favorites from a year ago. I discovered your website searching nano versions of the chapters of my favorites series. Every day I check your website and find pleasant surprises. I've never asked any movie, but as you put four classic films this week I ask ""Arabesque (1966)"" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060121/"
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-12T11:59Z,"@alexegovich: I have burred some Arabesque XviD somewhere, but I think that 1.4 GB version is much better than old 700MB (not my encode) I have.
