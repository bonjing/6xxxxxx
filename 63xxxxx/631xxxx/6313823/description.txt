Description: 
Where did it all go wrong? That's the question that hangs 
over Michael Collins's fascinating documentary about 
council housing. More than a third of the British population 
lived in social housing in the mid-1970s. Collins takes a 
fresh line. He's an ideal guide - in 1974, he moved into 
the Heygate Estate, which replaced the south London 
house where he was born. This film is packed with vibrant 
social history, looking beyond architecture to consider 
how people actually lived. But, even by the late 1960s, 
modernist estates were being viewed as Britain's new 
slums - although not by the people who were being 
rehoused.
