Someone please repost this torrent for me ( would be nice if you can include the same cover image & ISBN tag - just copy mine is fine ). I don't want to keep too many ebooks under the same account. Thanks

Synopsis
This text provides an understanding of the principles of analytic chemistry and shows how these principles are applied in chemistry and related disciplines, especially in the life and environmental sciences. Written to be accessible to nonmajors yet detailed enough for advanced undergraduates, this sixth edition of the text contains new chapters on mass spectrometry and quality assurance, and moves experiments from the book to a web site. Integrated coverage of spreadsheets is new to this edition, and there is updated material on the F test for comparing variance, pH dependence of solubility, and Gran plots. Harris is affiliated with Michelson Laboratory. Annotation Â©2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR
