NguyÃªn LÃª is a fusion guitarist who has versatility, leaves space, and does not mind caressing a melody now and then. On 3 Trios, he is heard with three different trios, all of which are impressive and engage in close interplay with the leader. LÃª, who contributed nine of the 11 selections, is the lead voice throughout despite occasional solos from his sidemen. The music is adventurous and unpredictable, with even Thelonious Monk's "Straight No Chaser" being turned into creative fusion. 
3 Trios is worth checking out by fans of rockish guitar solos. (Review by Scott Yanow, http://www.allmusic.com/album/3-trios-r256672)
