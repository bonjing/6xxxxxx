,ericv1984,2011-05-03T00:51Z,Resolution is 1280x544 so it's not 720p like the title says.
,trash2can,2011-07-03T16:19Z,"@ericv1984
544px is because the black bars on top and below  are not necessarily have to be encoded. Your Player or TV add that space for you automatically. That saves bandwith and space on your Harddrive. The horizontal resolution on the other hand should be 1280px..."
[T],Vitamin_X,2011-08-13T14:19Z,"Wow! What a treat to the senses this movie is....
Folks, Don't miss this movie no matter what.
Thanks a million MitZep, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't have came across this movie."
