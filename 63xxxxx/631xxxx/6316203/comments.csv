And neither did you seed as well.

Lame....very very lame!"
,fitzy89,2011-04-14T00:12Z,"@Poddez
I did seed and I still am, I have uploaded 408mb since I started the torrent, there are currently 2 seeds and 1 peer, so I must have seeded right?

I know it is available free, but maybe some people want to download it without having to sign up to the Centrafuse marketing list (if you hadn't noticed, they ask for all your details before you can download it).

If you're so fussed, why don't you download it from them instead?"
