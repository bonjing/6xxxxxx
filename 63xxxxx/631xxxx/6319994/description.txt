Microsoft has released the first Service Pack for its Apple Mac OS X based Office for Mac 2011 productivity suite. New Office for Mac 2011 Service Pack 1 is applicable to all editions of the office productivity suites available for the Mac OS X platform.  

The downloaded update from the  Microsoft website will not work on applications that have been cracked (I tried). They has also released a second service packed, but I couldn't find that one un-cracked.

The first Service Pack of Office for Mac 2011 brings major changes in Outlook application. Also, do note that this SP1 won't sync MobileMe calendar while using the Sync Services. That's due to the recent changes in the MobileMe and we anticipate Apple to release a free version of MobileMe in the coming months.

Apart from that, there are several enhancements and fixes for the productivity suite. 

Features of the update for all Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 applications include:

* Improved security: fixes vulnerabilities where an attacker can use to
    overwrite the contents of the computer's memory with malicious code.

* Improved Stability: fixes an issue that causes Office for Mac 2011 
   applications to close unexpectedly when you open or use Office for 
   Mac 2011 applications.

    charts, SmartArt, and movies in Office 2011 applications.
