I'll seed after i download =)"

After you unzip tghe dmg, mount the dmg by double clicking on it.  You will be left with a folder call ""Office 2011 14.1.0 Update.mpkg"" - just double click on it and the installation will begin automatically."
,pryingeyes,2011-04-16T19:33Z,"Is there anything about this that is different from the standard update file available free from Microsoft? I installed that file (on a cracked version) and it worked fine, didn't re-validate. So unless there's something different here, there's no real need to make this available via a torrent."

pryingeyes,

I don't think there is a difference, I was just not able toinstall the Microsoft .dmg on my version of Office 2011.

But I'm pretty sure there the same things. - were you able to apply the Service Pack 2 (14.2.0) as well?"
,pryingeyes,2011-04-18T16:17Z,"I believe you're referring to 14.0.2, which was a prior release a few months ago. There is no 14.2.0 at this point. I don't recall whether I installed that update."
[V],polisdavid,2011-04-22T18:29Z,"pryingeyes,

You are correct again :_|"
,babis200sx,2011-07-05T18:06Z,"Thank you for this polisdavid. Just installed it on my MBP 2011 with 10.7 Lion and it works great. :)
There is an Update available, 14.1.2, I guess we shouldn't install it, huh?"

,sk83,2012-03-21T12:04Z,"Hi Polisdavid,

I had problem while installing the pack.
I followed your instructions...

unzipped dmg, mount the dmg by double clicking on it. I was left with a folder call ""Office 2011 14.1.0 Update.mpkg"" - double clicked on it and the installation began.

however, after Introduction - Read Me - License - in the step 'Destination Select' it is saying ""Office 20011 14.1.0 cant be installed on this disk. software required to install this update was not found in this volume""

can you pls help me in this regard.
cheers!!!"
