From the original album notes:
This heart-warming exciting and deeply earthy album is the third -and in many ways the most satisfying-recording by the remarkable Cannonball L Adderley Quintet. a group that has proven to be one of the major, and certainly one of the very swiftest, success stories in Jazz.
Like their first LP (the phenomenally widely-enjoyed Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco), this one was taken down while the band was in the process of acting upon and re-acting to a richly enthusiastic and more than room-filling night club audience. The setting is the most celebrated of southern California jazz spots, The Lighthouse, located in a suburb of Los Angeles The occasion was a one-day, Sunday afternoon and night stand by the Adderley group, the culmination of a month-long triumphal stay in and around L.A. (onetime stronghold of "cool" jazz) by this thoroughly warm and soulful band.
