A quiet and oh-so English revolution has swept through folkie collective Tunng since their last album, 2007â€™s Good Arrows. Not only have they lost founding member, singer and once-chief songwriter Sam Genders, theyâ€™ve added a new lyricist, renewed their acquaintance with electronic experimentation and embraced their inner adventurer. And, like all revolutions before they turn into despotic dictatorships, itâ€™s been a revealing, liberating experience.

It wasnâ€™t easy, however. Troubled by collective writersâ€™ block, they embarked on a tour last year with desert bluesmen Tinariwen, finding common ground in their very different musical heritages that produced a snaky, loose-limbed hybrid of both bandsâ€™ work that freed up their minds. Their asses, as George Clinton once predicted, soon followed, and after three albums that gradually toned down the blips and squelches, â€¦And Then We Saw Land is littered with electronic flourishes which take Tunng far beyond the â€˜folktronicaâ€™ tag theyâ€™ve been handed. In fact, if you look at it from the other direction, theyâ€™ve become less a folk band with bleepy bits and more the acoustic Hot Chip.
This set is dazzling in its breadth. The most traditional track here, the almost a cappella These Winds, could be a group of pub singers by a forest inn fireside, and yet itâ€™s sandwiched between By Dusk They Were in the City, which features a Thin Lizzy-esque guitar solo, and Santiago, which circles a cute synth melody and looped handclaps. And then there is The Roadside. If it was played by robots it would be hailed as Kraftwerk at their epic best; if it was shrouded in layers of guitars small indie boys would be throwing their caps in the air that Spiritualizedâ€™s return was nigh. But it isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s largely acoustic but has all the repetitive, explosive, shuddering and gliding hallmarks of a Motorik classic or an indie gospel masterpiece.

Throughout, there is a sense of rebirth, nowhere more so than in the voice of Becky Jacobs. This is the first time on an album sheâ€™s taken centre stage, and her new-found confidence swims through everything else.
Tunng were always the eccentric cousins of British folk: a band born in a basement that played seat-of-the-pants shows with Malian freedom fighters, at ease with traditional folk music as cut up loops and samples. That, however, is a world theyâ€™ve outgrown. Instead of shadowing the pack, this album puts them right up the fronT.
