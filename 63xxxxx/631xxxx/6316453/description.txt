
Synopsis:
Ciki and Nino, a Bosnian and a Serb, are soldiers stranded in No ManÂ´s Land - a trench between enemy lines during the Bosnian war. They have no one to trust, no way to escape without getting shot, and a fellow soldier is lying on the trench floor with a spring-load bomb set to explode beneath him if he moves. The absurdity of their situation would be comical if it didnÂ´t have such dire consequences.

With the two men stuck in a bizarre predicament, a frustrated UN sergeant tries to help. despite orders to remain at his spot. When a journalist waylays the sergeant while pushing for an exclusive scoop, she affects the unfolding of events and turns a news story into an international circus. With the worldÂ´s press waiting for an outcome, no one willing to take action(lest they accept responsibility), and a soldier still stuck with a bomb beneath him, Ciki and Nino try to keep their humanity amidst the insanity of war.
