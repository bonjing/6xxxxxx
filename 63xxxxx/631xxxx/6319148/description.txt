Inspirational, emotional and for an intellectual audience is how one would describe Guru. It has several things which work for it, the amazing script which has a close parallel with industrialist Dhirubai Ambaniï¿½s life, a strong inspiring storyline, characters which are close to real life which have shades of white, black as well as grey, cinematography which depicts a glorious era and is tremendously appealing, music that is worthy and finally conviction that even middle class people can dream and make their dreams come true. Guru is the story of a young Gujarati lad from a small village who dares to dream big, makes his dreams come true and finally even has the courage to stand up and fight to keep what is rightfully his own. It is also a love story that has several magical moments between the two leads Abhishek and Aishwarya. Guru by all means is an excellent film with strong content value, however it may only appeal to a select audience as at times the screenplay does tend to drag and slacken a bit, and also there are a few minor loopholes.

Guru has been written and directed by Mani Ratnam and is said to be a biopic on the life of the late industrialist Dhirubai Ambani. The film stars Abhishek Bachchan as Gurukant Desai, Mithun Chakraborty as Manikdas Gupta, Aishwarya Rai as Sujata, R Madhavan as Shyam Saxena, Vidya Balan as Meenu, Arya Babbar, Mallika Sherawat, Sachin Khedekar, Roshan Seth, Manoj Joshi etc. The music has been composed by A.R Rahman.

Gurukant Desai is a young ordinary lad from Idar village in Gujarat, but Guru as he is fondly called believes that his destiny has big plans for him. Guru dreams of making it big one day, but first he needs to move out of his village. Guru never manages to see eye to eye with his father, a stern headmaster who doesnï¿½t believe that merely by dreaming big, one can achieve greatness. Hence father and sonï¿½s ideologies always clash. Guru heads off to Istanbul in Turkey where he is first employed as a casual labourer. But soon he rises steadily with hard work and dedication and is given a promotion. At the same time Guru makes a few friends due to his affable nature. Guru is not highly educated but nonetheless dreams big. However he rejects the promotion after he has collected enough money and returns to India with the dream to start his own business.

He returns to his village and after his father hears his plans of starting a business, he is snubbed once more. But Guru does not mind as he knows that his dreams and ambition will take him further. Guru decides to get into the cloth business, he has part of the money and then asks his best friend Jignesh (Arya Babbar) to lend him the rest and become his partner. Jigneshï¿½s sister, Sujata (Ash) becomes part of the deal and the three Guru, Jignesh and Sujata set off for Bombay the land of dreams. Here Guru learns the hard truth of life that it is not easy to make oneï¿½s dreams come true. But Guru is determined and does not believe in the term ï¿½noï¿½ and hence he breaks into the trade business after facing plenty of obstacles. Here he then realizes his bigger dream of starting a polyester factory. His relationship with the various people that come into his life grows, his relationship with his ever supporting wife Sujata, his relationship with his brother-in-law Jignesh, his relationship with his father like figure Manikdas Gupta etc.

Guru begins his business with a single polyester factory, Shakti trading and then the rate and growth of his business takes a phenomenal turn and reaches alarming levels in a short span of time. On the way, Guru loses a lot as well as gains; he loses several relationships, but gains and amasses wealth and the trust of common people. But it is the reporter Shyam (Madhavan) and publisher Manik Das who decide to expose Guruï¿½s underlying corrupt practices to reach the top. But the brave and fierce Guru readily takes on this challenge too. Guruï¿½s struggle, hard work and most importantly his dreams never cease.

Mani Ratnamï¿½s story of a rags to riches boy is inspiring and the common man yearns to believe in this story. The middle class often witness their own personal struggle of making it big, when they see the protagonist Guru encountering obstacles and battling them fiercely. Mani Ratnam gives a very realistic approach and a very believable factor to this larger than life story. Mani Ratnam keeps the viewers engrossed with the various twists and turns in the protagonistï¿½s life. Mani explores relationships in detail, between Guru and his wife, Guru and his mentor Manikdas, Guru and his father, Guru and his daughters etc. Each relationship has been well defined and continues to grow and develop through the film. Mani Ratnamï¿½s script has immense strength and potential, even the performances he has extracted from his actors are brilliant and the climax too is kept subtle but impactful. Mani Ratnamï¿½s ability to transform his vision onto the big screen is simply charismatic and his style of execution is realistic but yet striking.

There are a few loopholes though, the story although of a simple villager and that of the middle classes may not exactly appeal to these very audiences as the script and screenplay is more for the intellectual audiences. There are a few loopholes too, like the loose end of the relationship between him and his brother-in-law. Also the film at times is based more on the dialogues rather than showing, more emphasis is placed on the personal life of Guru and a bit less emphasis is given to the growth of Guruï¿½s enterprise. Also the second half tends to slow down severely and at times also tends to drag on a bit. Lastly the malpractices undertaken by Guru during his climb to the top are not shown, but a lot of technical business terms are used in the end such as evasion of excise duty, export duty etc which the common man may not find familiar.

However these discrepancies almost feel balanced out by Mani Ratnam during his execution. There are several poignant moments in the film, the beautiful and playful moments between Guru and his wife, their growth and discovery of love for one another. Guruï¿½s paralytic stroke and his subsequent recovery touches the viewersï¿½ hearts, the witty and intelligent dialogues that an uneducated Guru manages to deliver, the physical transformation of Guru makes him more realistically appealing, Guruï¿½s grey shades makes him more humane, the confrontation between Guru and his mentor Manikdas, the emotional sequence between Guru and his friend in hospital, Guru doting on his two daughters, the marriage proposal scene between Madhavan and Vidya finally least but not the last Guruï¿½s indomitable courage and wit in his speech in the courtroom.

The music by A. R Rahman is fresh, sweet and has a touch of innocence, the item number by Mallika Sherawat in the beginning ï¿½Maiya Maiyaï¿½ is good, Barso Re evokes the beauty of nature, the romantic track Tere Bina is melodious and even the background tunes are strong and add value. The cinematography by Rajiv Menon is excellent, the beauty of south India in the exquisite waterfalls, the green expanses has been captured with truly artistic appeal, the sets recreated for a post independent India with trams and the coal trains and the mills are first rate and capture the mood of a rising nation. Dialogues by Vijay Krishna Acharya are inspiring, witty and intelligent. Performances by such young actors are truly noteworthy.

Abhishek Bachchan plays the role of Guru with a rare profound intensity of the character. His look, mannerisms and behaviour are adapted excellently to suit the character; Mani Ratnam has managed to extract an award winning, inspiring performance from him. Abhishekï¿½s transformation from a young boy to a mature older man is done effortlessly and with ease. Abhishek delivers a stunning and brilliant performance that is sure to silence all those critics who claim he has been riding on his surname. Ash too manages a subtle but strong performance, she looks realistic and even though her role is relatively smaller she holds her own place in the film. The chemistry between her and Abhishek finally comes through in this film. Mithun Chakraborty as Manikdas is first rate and gives a strong and fierce performance. Even though Vidya Balan has a small role, she manages to play her part with ease; Madhavan too looks and does fairly decently. The rest of the cast gives a good supporting performance.

Guru is the thinking manï¿½s choice of film and will appeal to them for its inspiring script, its worthy execution and its realistic characters and portrayal. The film leaves the viewers with hope and dares them to dream big, it is truly inspiring. At the box-office the film will surely appeal to multiplex audiences, it will and has no doubt already received critical appreciation and finally it will hopefully have a good response at the box-office.
