The 60-Second Philosopher: Expand Your Mind on a Minute or So a Day

Review
"A pot pourri of philosophical ideas! Written with a deft hand and a light touch." --Martin Cohen, author of 101 Philosophy Problems

"How many of the classic problems of philosophy can you solve on the commuting train? More than you might think, if Andrew Pessin's neat and provocative new book is anything to go by. The perfect start to thinking more deeply about life, the universe, and everything." --Timothy Chappell, Professor of Philosophy at the Open University
