On Wednesday, November 03 at 9 pm (ET) the Bio Channel aired a two-hour Star Trek-focused documentary called â€œThe Captains of the Final Frontierâ€. 
(Unlike William Shatnerâ€™s The Captains documentary about the actors who played captains, which at this time hasn't aired yet, this Bio Channel doc did focus on the fictional characters themselves.
