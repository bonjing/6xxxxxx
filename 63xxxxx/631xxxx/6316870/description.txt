Here are the first 3 audio books in the Saxon Chronicle series of books by Bernard Cornwell, the creator of Sharpe.
1.	The Last Kingdom (Read by Jamie Glover)
2.	The Pale Horseman (Read by Tom Sellwood)
3.	Lords of the North (Read by Tom Sellwood)

These tell the tale of Alfred the Great and his descendants through the eyes of Uhtred, an English boy born into the aristocracy of 9th century Northumbria, who is captured by the Danes and taught the Viking ways. The stories follow his travels and battles as he comes to struggles with his conscience and divided loyalties between those who raised him and his respect and burgeoning friendship of the embattled English King Alfred.
The series is, as usual from Cornwell, a brilliant worked tale of divided loyalties and desperate heroism. Filled with a excellently brought to life range of characters from Vikings to British kings in their Cornish fortresses, from political but passionate priests to enduring fishermen and farmers desperately striving to survive as the battle sweeps over them. Uhtred and Alfred, Vikings and Saxons, are a winning combination for Bernard Cornwell.
