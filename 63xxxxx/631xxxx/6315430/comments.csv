,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-13T23:51Z,"*""Minus idiot"" obviously doesn't hate just me - but Paul Newman too! ROFL*
I can't fault him there--the Paul Newman part, anyway--the first, last, and only movie I recall him in that was worth watching again was The Sting--and that was largely due to Robert Shaw.  imho, of course."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T09:09Z,"Compared to WHAT? What playback-system? Have you ORIGINAL Blu-Ray to compare to unaltered source?

STOP SPAMMING ALL MY UPLOADS OF CLASSIC MOVIES, PLEASE !

Freedom of opinion does not count in voices of - anybody, morons included.

Your ""rating"" system is totally unfounded and idiotic. Anyone can write whatever number one wants, right? And nobody can check to what one compare his ratings too.

I am sure  that your rating reflects inner state of your mind - and something is obviously wrong at both places.

I am NOT THE ONLY ONE who knows that your ""rating"" is - let say nicely - wrong, skewed and probably biased."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T09:12Z,"@dude....: ^^ strangely, TPB shows dozen times Database error if I address my response properly."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-14T13:38Z,"In other words, I, personally, can't stand Paul Newman as an actor--but his commercial food brand (Newman's Own) is generally excellent and incomparable.  But I simply choose not to download and or watch his movies--I don't badmouth the messenger (20-40, in this case), who is entitled to his opinion as well, and quite likely--from an international perspective, has much better cinematic taste than I do."
[V],twentyforty,2011-04-14T14:32Z,"I am not crazy about late Paul Newman, but I do have great admiration for long, fruitful career and clean life. He was significant part of cinematic history and one of maybe dozen greatest male actors ever lived. He played in few greatest movies which marked older generations forever, becoming a part of civilizational heritage of western world and as such was interlaced in many aspects of our lives. 
One cannot 'dislike' Paul Newman as actor, he can dislike only his physical appearance (curious are ways how human minds works).

Some of the scenes and quotes from this particular movie are so deeply embedded (by Paul's performance) in probably existing 'universal conscience' that depriving yourself from watching all classics (even if they are not something one would watch) is absolutely same as deprivation of soaking all out there, in forms of books and movies, and not just searching for self-centered hedonistic masturbation of all kinds, which is today's prevailing standard.

It was a Request, and with great pleasure, I accepted it."
,formerly_azrielle,2011-04-14T15:18Z,"Individual actors, including Paul Newman, have role preferences, as well as ""typecast"" roles offered.  As also individual members of audiences.  Witness the roles that John Wayne, Fred Astaire, Jimmie Stewart, Peter Lorre', or Edward G. Robinson played, or decided to play.  Or that Keira Knightley or Angelina Jolie decide to play now.  Paul Newman did a string of bad boy character movies in the '60's that were, and have remained, to me, irritating and forgettable, and, those of which I actually saw--such as this one--left me asking the question ""why did they bother making this movie in the first place?""  His later movies were more enjoyable, but he still almost universally remained ""stuck in character"".  Given his fame and versatility, one would think that he COULD have done different more likeable character types (as could Fred Astaire could have--another actor I can't stomach), but he almost never did, so one must conclude that he LIKED playing those roles.  I just don't enjoy WATCHING them.  And since the roles a famous actor chooses to accept must, therefore, reflect, at least to some extent, the actor's personality, one can, with some truthfulness, voice his like or dislike of an actor."
