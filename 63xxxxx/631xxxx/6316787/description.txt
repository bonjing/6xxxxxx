Covenant
Greatest Hits (2006)



Covenant is a Swedish electronic band signed to San Francisco's 21st Circuitry Records. Their music is built around deep, droning tones and thundering rhythms that support dark songs focusing on science fictional and cyberpunk themes, such as "Replicant" and "Painamplifier" from Dreams of a Cryotank. The third recorded band to use the name Covenant, they issued The United States of Mind in early 2000.
