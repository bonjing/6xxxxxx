,SSiadat187,2011-04-13T12:24Z,I'm 40 min into it and i regret ever starting. The scary parts are too dark and you cant tell what anything is. Camera is right dimensions but is slightly tilted slightly most of the time. Video jumps alot... audio jumps up and down occasionally. Annoying people in the theater. I NEVER leave comments and i decided to find out my old PW and login just to say this cammer fails and should refine their methods before ever uploading again. This movie seems scary and I havnt been able to see shit.. just hear everyone else enjoying it. 
,SSiadat187,2011-04-13T12:35Z,"Just realized that there are two audio sources spliced over eachother ... one from a foreign version. Where there is no talking and the audience was screaming the foreign versions audio was dubbed over. Should have normalized the audio or set gain levels better. Nevertheless, that explains the audio jumping and even why it was looped at one point to cover screaming"
,SSiadat187,2011-04-13T13:28Z,End is black .. cant see ANYTHING but the occasional half of a face. Audio cuts out 15 min or so before end. 
,Chadly,2011-04-13T16:11Z,"Listen to those comments above. All correct. Very dark, mass echo in audio. Barely hear anything theyre saying. Extremely dark at the dark scenes, cant see a thing. Screen might aswel be off lol This is about as bad as cam can get. The only reason its not the worst is because the cam isnt moving all over the place all the time. Ive seen some like that. Dont waste your time. To the uploader: why waste your time on crap like this? no way anyone is gonna be able to watch this. Thanks anyways :)"
,rathanek,2011-04-13T16:28Z,"the audio don't sync at all and hellow at the same time. Simply not worth downloading.   But THANK YOU for your effort. IT""S THE SAME ONE AS BEFORE where the video is moving all over the place and audio is the same as before HELLOW and PEOPLES HEADS ARE IN THE WAY AND TALKING.       "

,J4CK_THE_R1PPER,2011-04-14T08:50Z,"I agree with everyone. I watched the whole movie though. I'm just going to see it in the theater it looks like a really good scary movie only if you can actually see what the fuck is going on. The dark parts are too dark every time you see dead people. Audio sucks as well. Thanks for the upload but would have been better to wait until it's worth uploading.
