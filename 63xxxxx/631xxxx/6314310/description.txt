Release Notes:Video:OWN

Audio:OWN From V1

Reason for Proper: V2 runtime 1:38 compared to our v1 which had a run time of 1:34

Alright here is v2 with our new cam much much better in quality imo you can actually see what is going now comapred to v1, a/r has also been corrected compared to our v1 was 16:9
because it was so zoomed in.On to work done usual video filters rgb,sharpen resize crop etc now please note there are about a good 2 or 3 scenes where you will notice shaking for about 10 secnds
and an occasional head pops in at bottom left of screen for only a few seconds 3 or 4 times during the movie all in all not bad and very watchable.

Audio is the same from our v1 just a tad bit cleaned up,I am including 2 samples 1 of a dark scene 1 regular if you have not seen the movie i suggest do not d/l the sample named spoiler

Enjoy.
