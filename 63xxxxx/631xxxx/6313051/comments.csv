,The Real Chicken,2011-04-13T00:24Z,"Cartman: Your'e welcome.

This is in .cbr-format, you will need a comic reader like CDisplay, or ComicRack to read it.
Or you could just rename the file from .cbr to .rar and unrar it to get to the .jpegs."
,cartman19987,2011-04-13T23:43Z,"I use ComicRack. It's so easy to use.
I never unRAR .cbr's, that simply makes the process too difficult."
,tehnores,2011-04-16T05:42Z,"I use Comix on Linux, does its job well."
,Slam12345,2011-04-16T10:38Z,what about a mac program to open it?
,serosis,2011-04-16T21:17Z,"Or you guys can actually stop being dense and change the file extension to ""rar"" and extract it with WinRar. Don't need an extra piece of shit software cluttering up my computer."

,cartman19987,2011-04-18T22:30Z,"@serosis - Personally, I'd rather have a quality, easy to use program like ComicRack to open my .cbr files insetad of unRARing them and opening individual .jpegs every time I want to turn a page. So I think YOU should stop being dense."
,q00u,2011-04-19T08:19Z,@Siam12345 I use Simple Comic on OSX. It's the best of the free ones.
,The Real Chicken,2011-06-30T14:35Z,"Serosis: Absolutely, if you just read a very few strips every year then you don't need ""extra piece of shit software cluttering up [your] computer"". But if you read a lot of strips then you'll find that the unrar/choose picture-reading style is a little  awkward, and that a comic reader are not, in fact, a piece of shit software, but actually quite a nifty little application for it."
