The Word of Promise: Next Generation is much more than just a word-for-word reading: itâ€˜s an all-star cast performing audio drama with a rich original score and Hollywood special effects. When Jesus walks on the water, kids will feel like theyâ€˜re in the boat. When Peter waits in the courtyard during the Lordâ€˜s trial, the fire will crackle. The ambient sounds of the Holy land, the breath-taking musical score, the world-class young actors and the timeless Word of Promise all combine to deliver an unparalleled achievement.
