,aza101,2011-04-16T01:34Z,"hey, this is rar? is this real?"
,mint0x,2011-04-16T02:05Z,Why is this split up into RAR's? This isn't 1980 anymore and we aren't downloading on 33.6k modems. We don't need the file split up!
,thewindowisthedoor,2011-04-16T04:46Z,"i dunno what was up with that remote control joke, but at least this episode was legit.  Fuckin' Will Ferrell!"
,ConeBone,2011-04-16T05:43Z,"Wow- people really are bitching because all they have to do is right-click on the file and select ""extract here""?  you lazy, unappreciative ****'s"
[T],nlx_78,2011-04-16T07:35Z,"This is the legit episode for the people who are wondering since it's RAR-ed. And yes, Will Ferrell sucks. Can't believe this class A show needs this C minus actor. 

Thanks Scenebalance for the quick upload!

Don't get the joke about the remote neither :) If you want to find out if your remote is still working or that the receiver in your tv/radio is broke, here's a tip. Aim the infrared beam of the remote into the lens of your mobile phone when you want to take a picture. If it lights up in your mobile screen you know your remote is still fine :) try it"
,lobo345,2011-04-16T18:15Z,"""legit episode ... since it's RAR-ed""

Haha. That's really scientific proof. "
,aineolach,2011-04-16T22:06Z,"@lobo345 He's not saying ""it's legit because it's RAR-ed for the people wondering."" He's saying ""it's legit for the people wondering about it being RAR-ed""

While the phrase used was a little ambiguous the context should have made it obvious what was meant."
,mcalpues,2011-04-17T11:42Z,"All good, pretty tough to have to go the extra step of extracting, had to select all then right click and everything, haha cheers mate"
,creyzism,2011-04-19T03:18Z,"why use RAR unless its fake, or is password protected and we have to go to some site to get it???
Thats what people are bitchin about, 
and thats why I m not downloading THIS torrent."
,TheHumanBot,2011-04-19T05:30Z,Hey everyone. This torrent is 100% legit. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Bi84gopE3MM/Ta0BdQyekKI/AAAAAAAAAq8/8bKYDXpq2H0/s1600/this%2Btorrent%2Bis%2Blegit.JPG
,7b,2011-04-20T09:05Z,"yeah, .rar does ZERO to compress divx files, and only means people seed for less time so they can get the extra space free'd up"
,gnawingonfoot,2011-04-20T22:33Z,"Thanks for the release, but I'd prefer 7zip to Rar if you're gonna break it up.  (:"
,chandlerboy,2011-04-22T00:49Z,Don't zip or RAR torrents. It's absolutely moronic.
,boris72,2011-04-22T11:26Z,"Ah I get the joke now. He/she means that when you upload at 25kb/s or above you get priority and higher download speeds. So much like a remote control, don't press harder on the button when you know the battery is dead. Just upload for everybody else and all is fine and dandy."
,WasclyWabbit,2011-04-24T07:26Z,"It's the nature of the human animal..  Might makes right.  Why do people hit the soda machine?  Why do people hit their keyboards or monitors when they have a computer problem, especially since its neither the keyboard or the monitor's fault..  This is completely unrelated, but its funny, I knew a guy that took his monitor cable home with him after work, I asked him about it and he says, 'well ya, I have all my files on the desktop, and I don't want anyone to be able to steal them.'  My reply, ' you're a fuckin moron'"
,hsmn,2011-04-25T20:14Z,Isn't this S07E19? Where Deangelo gets introduced as the new boss? 
,Ginlyf,2011-05-21T23:36Z,thanks :D
,Geocat,2011-06-09T03:53Z,"The reason people(including me) hate it when a show is rar'd because the number 1 and 2 reason its done are

1. Because you can password rars as part of a bullshit scam, that make you go to some bullshit site to get the password.
2. Its a virus/Trojan or some nasty shit, and you cant tell until you unrar it.

its not like OH NO ITS SO HARD TO EXTRACT, its for the fucking above two reasons.

There is no VALID reason anymore."
