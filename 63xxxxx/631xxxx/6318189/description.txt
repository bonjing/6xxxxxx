VIDEO:Rio.D.2011.TS ............ Thanks
AUDIO:Rio ....Thanks m8tY

NOTES:

IMAGiNE bringing you another release..........Rio 2011

Here we go we a half decent release to this flick....video is the 2D russian cam and the line is some nice line audio 

Now video needed tweaking and also resizing so fixed what we could,but throughout the film there

seems to be a band of yellow that appears over the video,then it goes ...then comes back,not as fast as that though lol.

Also whilst syncing we found some missing video footage ....not too much just a few secs,but one waS during a mid sentence so the audio might slip for a sec and kick back in....but we did go back a fix itas close as we could.

Audio like stated was some decent line,we just cleaned up and synced.
Overall a pretty decent TS and will do until the r5/retail comes out .....
Oh and will it work on a ps3 ??? Fuck knows try it and find out
