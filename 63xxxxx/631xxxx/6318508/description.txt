1000 java games, I only tested them on my sony ericsson W595 and most of them work on it.
Only some of them include both jar and jad files.
Note: some of them are +18 games, like Larry Sexy Game.
Note 2:I haven't tested them all, I mean cmon, it's 1000 games and I have 87 games on my phone right now...
