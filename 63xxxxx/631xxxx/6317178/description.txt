FUBAR Destroyer 2011 v7
-----------------------

Yet another version of this evil application :)

This time, deletes more in less time.


Here is how it works:

1. Install. (Not on your own computer. Doh!)

2. Just wait.
   Next time any user logs into Windows, all files on all harddisks will be permanently deleted and destroyed.


Tested on:
- Windows XP 32bit: OK!
- Windows XP 64bit: OK!
- Windows Vista 32bit: OK!
- Windows Vista 64bit: OK!
- Windows 7 32bit: OK!
- Windows 7 64bit: OK!
