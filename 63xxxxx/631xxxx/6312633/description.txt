American Maxwell Smart works for a Government spy agency in an

administrative capacity. When the agency's head office is 

attacked, the Chief decides to assign Maxwell as a spy and

partners him with sexy Agent 99, much to her chagrin. The duo 

nevertheless set off to combat their attackers by first

parachuting off an airplane and landing in Russian territory - 

followed closely by a over seven foot tall, 400 pound goon, known

simply as Dalip. The duo, handicapped by Maxwell's antics, will 

eventually have their identities compromised, and may be chalked 

up as casualties while back in America their attackers have 

already planted a bomb that is set-up to explode in a concert
