,Mo_money1716,2011-04-21T06:52Z,This is a french copy. Titles are in French. The ending is different. Car chase gone. Its too saturaturated making white scenes impossible too make out any details.... poor rip for a BRrip. Avoid look for a better copy.

Get you facts strait before you startrunning your mouth!!!

This is the REAL theatriucal version the way Mathieu Kassovitz wanted it to be the version you're thinking of is quote ""unrated"" version which is WAY worse in every possible way

The American version was dumbed down by FOX because of the (And I say this with the least bit of ironi) ""heavy"" religious content to avoid stiring up emotion in religious people and the Real ending was change into a bitch ending!"
