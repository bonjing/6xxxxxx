Someone please repost / recreate torrent for this ebook ( would be nice if you can include the same cover image & ISBN tag - just copy mine is fine ). I don't want to keep too many ebooks under the same account, plan to remove this post sometime in the future. Thanks

Synopsis

Atkins (chemistry, Oxford University) and de Paula (chemistry, Haverford College) present a text for students majoring in the life sciences, including biology and biochemistry, covering foundations and biological applications of thermodynamics, kinetics, quantum theory, and molecular spectroscopy. Pedagogical devices include margin comments explaining mathematical procedures, and appendices of background information from mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Cases develop applications to specific biological or biomedical problems, and highlight experimental techniques in biochemistry and biomedicine. Chapter exercises, answers, and projects are also included. Annotation Â©2005 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR
