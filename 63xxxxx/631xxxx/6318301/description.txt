[1995]
Always wary of pompous judges, "their assembled lordships who like nothing less than being judged themselves," British barrister Horace Rumpole faces off against them once again, defending six new clients in this 1995 collection of stories, the author's first collection to have been written as short stories and not as adaptations of his TV scripts. Here many familiar characters continue, though their roles are much reduced in scale, compared to author John Mortimer's longer novels. The biggest and most pleasant surprise is that Rumpole's cantankerous wife Hilda, long a fixture known as "She Who Must Be Obeyed," has written her own story here, her recognizable "voice" describing her marriage and giving a new slant to our views of Rumpole.

Other stories in this collection include: "Rumpole and the Way Through the Woods," in which Rumpole deals with animal rights and foxhunting; "Rumpole and The Little Boy Lost," in which he defends a "kidnapper"; "Rumpole and the Model Prisoner," in which he deals with a feminist who wants revenge on a fellow barrister for calling her "fat"; "Rumpole and the Rights of Man," which takes him abroad to the European Court of Human Rights"; and "Rumpole and the Angel of Death," in which he defends an unabashed proponent of euthanasia who is accused of murdering his old friend, "Judge Chippy."

*NOTE*: This rare audio book was transcribed from old worn cassette tapes - and it shows! Even after EQ the sound quality is only mediocre, but the narration is reasonably clear.

I have never been able to locate another copy, and the tapes from which this was made have now been withdrawn. Although not as good as Bill Wallis, Graham Roberts still does a good Rumpole!

Enjoy and Seed!!
