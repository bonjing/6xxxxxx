1) Short shocker showing a dude having fun while working in morgue. Spanish film, directed by Nacho Cerda in 1993, no subs - but no dialogues. :)

2) Short German gore about Hitler's experiments with zombie. Directed by JÃ¶rg Buttgereit, creator of Schramm, Der Todesking and (in)famous Nekromantik series!

3), 4), 5) - Three amateur (almost) no-budget Finnish short gore movies, imagine something like mix of Frankenstein, Re-animator and lots of sensless violence ;). Two of them have engilsh subs in .srt file.

6), 7) - Two amateur German gore movies. Hardcoded english subs.

8) Movie is in polish and I do not think there are english subs anywhere, but anyway You can try it. 

Dudes responsible for this movie wanted to create a trilogy, but there is only one (first) part relased so far. 

Here You have their official site - http://obrobka-skrawaniem.prv.pl/ You can "googletranslate" it, but results may be wicked.

Short, amateur black comedy with some gore. Inspired by Lynch, "Bad Taste" and "Evil Dead".

Movie in .rmvb file

Title? Title means this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining in polish :D

9) Amateur and a bit crappy prequel to Evil Dead saga. Sam Raimi's debut movie from 1978, so do not expect wonderful effects. Polish subs in separate file.

10)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_%28film%29 ( <- Spolier warning here!) Highly recommended, weird and wicked experimental movie.
