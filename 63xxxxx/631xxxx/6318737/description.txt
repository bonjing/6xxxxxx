   Holy Water (2009)

  The village of Kilcoulins Leap was once a thriving spa town, and 
  was home to a famous Holy Well, but now offers little by way of 
  employment for its people, and its decline seems inexorable. When 
  local Postie, Podger Byrnes, comes up with a plan to hijack a 
  consignment of Viagra, and sell it on the open market in Amsterdam, 
  his friends are desperate enough to try it. Not counting on the 
  muscular response of Viagra's makers, the boys panic and hide the 
  lorry load of Viagra down the town's Holy Well.

   Stars: Adam Astill, Angeline Ball and Cian Barry
