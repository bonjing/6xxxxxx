@mike
I am not able to post in that honeyko 4.24GB post. I have tried few subtitles from net.
The original sub from source disk will always be a perfect fit and highly precise.
Its the original time index I am interested in, not even the English text in the sub.
Can u send it to freakz  freakz  g mail  com Thanks!

I started d'loading this 39 GB torrent. I guess it will take eons to complete this with such slow download. :("
