,burchalka,2011-04-22T22:21Z,"!!Finally! 
I've been looking for this video for 7 months or so, ever since learned about its existence.
Unfortunately, I cannot afford the 400+$ of the original DVD set.
I hope that the seed will stay there long enough for a lot of us to download it!!!

Hooray to BT community! "
,burchalka,2011-04-26T21:28Z,The number of seeders still the same :(
,lefroz,2011-05-02T11:10Z,"I'm very interested in Permaculture, mainly in Bill Mollisons work. So I want to thank you so mouch as i can. Thanks many times! :) On my internet it takes 1 week download, seed please. And sorry my lama english. I'm from Slovakia. 
Have a nice day and beatiful food forest.

Please can somebody give me the english subtitles to this document? I wanna translate it into Slovak. My mail zorfel.webmaster@gmail.com "
,Vero1983,2011-05-20T23:08Z,The torrent works great. Please keep seeding!
,nnonny,2011-05-22T10:04Z,"
could someone please upload a compressed version of this, please ? x264 etc....

thank you.."
,nnonny,2011-05-22T19:05Z,"
if each of us downloads one dvd, compresses it and uploads,  15 of us can compress the whole torrent in a couple of days...  anyone willing ?"
,Vero1983,2011-05-24T23:23Z,"I`m the original uploader but dont know anything about video encoding so if somebody can compress the files and make the whole series a lot smaller that would be great. Please include the messages though about buying the original and the websites. 
"
,2toms2,2011-06-13T16:20Z,"Thanks for the upload!
On DVD 9 however, there is one file missing, ""VTS_05_2.VOB"" (Jeff's talk is cut by about 20 minutes). Could you please post the missing file or re-post the DVD 9? (once we have the missing file, you can copy the existing files, add the missing one and the resulting DVD will be complete)"
,Vero1983,2011-06-25T10:07Z,I`m looking into it. It could take a while though before I can get that missing file.
,SebaSakyr,2011-06-26T00:20Z,"Thank u so much for this, I really appreciate it.

I'm having problems burning the dvd5, I guess it's because the ""VIDEO_TS"" file is missing from the ""VIDEO_TS"" folder, which is in the other previous 4 ones."
,nnonny,2011-06-28T04:31Z,"a compressed version of DVD 1 is at

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6500465

reduced from 4gb to 620mb.

those who have any of the other dvds,  will you please consider compressing and uploading it ? then this course can be made available in a much more compact form

the compression was done with linux software dvdrip (also possible with transmageddon or arista)...  on windows, free transcoding software includes Virtualdub,  Super  etc

the video settings used were: xvid 326kbps 23.976 fps
the audio settings used were: mp3 48kbps (volumescale boosted to 9)"
,Vero1983,2011-06-30T13:46Z,The files of dvd 9 are not working well on my DVD so I cant help with that I`m afraid. Maybe a good reason to buy the whole set anyhow or maybe somebody else can help out with DVD 9.
,SebaSakyr,2011-07-01T23:57Z,"Vero, there are two files in a dvd which have information about the dvd structure.

these files are VIDEO_TS.VOB and VIDEO_TS.IFO

Actually I'm not pretty sure but is what I got from reading a little...
so, missing those files are gonna give us trouble... and are missing in dvd9"
,Vero1983,2011-07-11T23:15Z,I don`t think I can help with the problems here. Maybe somebody that actually knows about this stuff can buy the original series and try to upload it as well. If the person knows how to make the files a lot smaller that would be great as well. This series here is not going to get any better unfortunately.
,nnonny,2011-07-12T04:30Z,"
Exactly which file is missing on DVD 9 ? What topic does it cover ? Is it ""Soils (part 2) "" ?  Please be very specific, then the problem can be solved.

Thank you."
,nnonny,2011-07-24T19:47Z,"a compressed 13 gb version of this torrent is available at 

http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6520585/permaculture_design_course_box_set

thanks to the original uploader and the compressor..."
,ribblywinks,2011-07-29T04:37Z,"please disregard the above link, it is an incomplete upload and is missing much of the dvd content"

,permageek,2011-12-07T09:41Z,"hey folks, i have the box set, and i tried to use handbrake (or maybe it was mpeg streamclip) last summer to compress the DVDs down to a usable size, as did TPB user ribblywinks at: https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6520585/permaculture_design_course_box_set

but the same thing happened to me as it did to ribblywinks: only the first of the three episodes per DVD came out. if someone can help me figure out how to do it, i will compress them down to size over the holidays, i really want this permaculture course to get out because it's an excellent source of learning."

,nvcupload,2011-12-26T20:11Z,"There seems to already be a compressed version of the whole set, a little over 7 gigs total. I haven't watched all the videos, but the quality is good enough for me, and it looks like everything is there...

It's not on TPB, but you can do a general internet search for ""Permaculture Design Certificate Course torrent"" to find it. Maybe someone could repost the torrent on TPB? "
,Vero1983,2012-05-30T08:32Z,"Done, the newer and much smaller version of this course can be found on: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7310763/Permaculture_Design_Certificate_Course_-_Bill_Mollison__amp_amp__Geo"
