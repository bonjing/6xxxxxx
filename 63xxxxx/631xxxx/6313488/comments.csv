- lookup words in both offline and online dictionaries
- translate sentences using Google Translate
- fetch definitions from Wikipedia
- pronounce words/sentences

The application doesn't include any dictionaries on Android market and that is what the uploader has included here.  There is just about any dictionary you can think of (in English, German and Russian).  

Obviously, you don't have to download them all, but if you need a full dictionary, it is probably here!

Examples of Full English Dictionaries are; Oxford, Cambridge, Oxford American, MacMillan, Longman, Economic Dictionaries, Finance and Banking dictionaries, plus many, many more.

There are a number of German and Russian dictionaries, plus Lingvo (Russian to German and Russian to English).

Hope that helps!"
