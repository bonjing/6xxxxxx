,supcena,2011-04-12T08:19Z,@StyLishSaLH-hey buddy just wondering... why don't you mux the subtitles to the .mkv file which we can turn on and off as we wish without having an .srt file outside the .mkv container ??
,banukaknight,2011-04-12T09:37Z,"i don't think that muxing... is available for mp4... even so... none-muxed subtitles.. are editable.... 
i like that way (just personal theory)

@StyLishSaLH

& will try to be better...
you are the best."

,tropeus,2011-04-13T03:23Z,are u doing mystic river mate????
,banukaknight,2011-04-13T03:59Z,"for the size of the movie....
take the movie's length in minutes...
let's say 90 minutes (1 & half hour long one)

in a best-compressed encode.. for it's size.. multipy it in 2.5
90*2.5 = 225mb
ex: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6014645/13_[2010]-R5-x264-StyLishSaLH

for normal compress encode
90*3 = 270mb
