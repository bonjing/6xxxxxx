gave a 1+ the very 1st moment i saw the rip...
and never meant to harm u..
in any verbal way...

just so u know now..
that there are people who haven't even seen... 2mb upload rate... ever

so.. kindly requesting you to do thes encodes in 400mb... rips... (if you can... )
sorry again..

cant help but hate the fkd up ISPs we've got :\

live long prosper... xvid-reenc"
[T],ILPruny,2011-04-14T05:13Z,"I make small encodes because i dont have much free space. 
I also upload big HD files because i cannot keep them in my pc and i' tired of buying dvd.
Read title first, next week i hope to upload Atonement and The Bone Collector, each 1080p at 9gb."
,banukaknight,2011-04-14T05:32Z,O.o okey. thnx.
,dlarrym1111,2011-04-22T06:56Z,"Does anyone not WANT a LARGER file size. A ""LARGER"" video / movie file translates to better quality. The larger it is the less it gets compressed. Compression = lessening quality is  proportional to how small you compact the file.

So, to further compress it as  would like done, the quality is further compromised. I AGREE 100% with . He obviously can see and appreciate the value in trying to avoid any un needed compressing of these movie files. so I will repeat his comment FUCK OFF.

Keep it up xvid-reenc, good upload!

The reason he has a skull and  doesn't is for a good reason. 

xvid-reenc knows what the hell he or she is doing and , you do not. Lastly, As a member myself, I know that xvid-reenc has several pages of uploads that were contributed to this site. . . OH, and you, , have never uploaded even 1 file. . .ZERO. . . .NADA. . . . NOTHING!!!! so GET OVER IT!"
