,akhnaten,2011-04-17T03:50Z,The Real Deal straight cut from the original.  I was able to burn the iso files without any problem using Imgburn.  A/12 V/12  It took me two days to download it off and on but well worth it.  INcludes the images to burn on your DVDs and the front and back cover from the box.  Sah-sweet and thank you!
,smokethevidence,2011-04-17T10:44Z,"Were the director/actor commentaries ripped to this? I know most WB blurays use fancy videoboxes and cut-menus instead of alternative audio tracks, now, so it's understandable if you weren't able to/didn't bother.

Either way, thanks for this. :)"
,kaoslulu,2011-04-20T05:15Z,thanks so much for this! :)
,USA890789,2011-04-26T18:03Z,"this might be a dumb question, but do I need a special dvd for the first ISO since it is 6.73 GB.?"
[V],oldskoolscouse,2011-04-26T19:50Z,"@USA890789, you can extract the iso and use dvd shrink to burn it to a normal DVD it will degrade the quality but if you just burn the main movie its not that bad."
,USA890789,2011-04-26T20:55Z,ty!   also I have spent like 3 hours trying to convert this from PAL to NTSC so I can play it on my dvd players and my ps3 (live in the US). Any suggestions on programs to do this

@USA890789
Try using Aiseesoft Ripper!

@Others
The movie is PAL 720x576 with High Density 50 frames per sec. (suitable for slow motions)
But I am accustomed to the 720p or 1080p versions.
The movie looks a bit grainy (may be PAL requires stretched pixels than square pixels! No idea)
I believe this movie is more suitable for TV.

Second disk is awesome!"
