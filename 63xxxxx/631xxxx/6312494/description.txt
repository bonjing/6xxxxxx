Various Artists
Mad-Hop Vol. 1 (2011)


Mad-Hop is presenting itâ€™s first compilation of various artists and beat makers from around the globe. Mad-Hop started as a group focused on future beats that evolved from IDM, glitch hop and low frequency therapies, on last.Fm in 2009. Eager to digg new mad releases and inform our followers with fresh new sounds, weâ€™re trying to push the ball game further. In association with Polish U Know Me Records, Russian Gimme 5, Belgrade based Svetlana Industries and other talented producers we continue to support this wide spectrum of electronic music.
