Spy Nozy and the Poets

From BBC Radio 4 Extra. Written by Paul B. Davies; Full-cast dramatisation starring Martin Clunes, Bill Nighy, Graeme Garden and John Woodvine; Directed by Sara Davies.

Based on a true story, this is the tale of a bizarre encounter between a Home Office spy, Mr Walsh, and the drug-addicted, charismatic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Walsh travels to a Somerset village to investigate reports of two suspicious characters roaming the hills by night.

They turn out, however, not to be French spies but Romantic poets out on moonlit walks, and Walsh's life is changed forever.
