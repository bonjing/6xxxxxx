                           DESCRiPTiON 

 Reporter Peter Oborne and director Edward Watts travel to Karachi in Pakistan,
 where they investigate claims that the number of civilians dying in political,
 ethnic and criminal violence is on the rise. They uncover how a growing       
 population has put pressure on homes, water, food and jobs, leading to clashes
 between rival ethnic groups, including Pashtuns, Mohajirs, Sindhis and Baluch,
 who live in segregated areas within the city                                  
                                 Enjoy!
