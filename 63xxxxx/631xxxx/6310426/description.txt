Aurelie Dupont, Mattieu Ganio, and Melanie Hurel perform in this Opera national de Paris production of 
the 1972 reconstruction of the ballet with music by Schneitzhoeffer choreographed by Pierre Lacotte, 
with Ermanno Florio conducting.

Performed at the Palais Garnier by the OpÃ©ra National de Paris in July 2004, 
this staging of Philippe Taglioni's classic ballet stars leading ballerina AurÃ©lie Dupont in the title role of 
Sylphide, which was once played by Marie Taglione, the choreographer's daughter. 
This revival performance is actually a reconstruction of Pierre Lacotte's well-known 1972 version. 
In expressing Lacotte's (and Taglioni's) original choreography, 
Dupont and her male partner Mathieu Ganio recreate the style that defined the romantic ballet.
