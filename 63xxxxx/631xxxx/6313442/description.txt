As the first book in the Living Memory series, The Story of Atlantis is a gripping account of that lost world by someone who actually was there.

The book answers such questions as, "Where is Atlantis?" "Where did Atlantis come from?" "What happened to Atlantis?" "What was Atlantis like?" "What were the people of Atlantis like?" etc.

As the first actual, entirely non-speculative work on the subject, it is a true cornerstone on the way to understanding ourselves and our past. Besides for being entertaining, it is a vital account on the birth of humanity on this planet.
