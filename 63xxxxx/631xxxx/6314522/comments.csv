,Silentheart,2011-05-25T04:01Z,wow downloaded in record speed.  A-10 v-10  Great job.  thank you.
,antiinsight,2011-05-25T18:34Z,"Fantastic Quality! Thank you!

But I also just want to point out to everyone that these are not actually in HD. They were recorded from the HD episodes but the actual resolution of these are only 624 X 352. But it is still great quality."

,riplikethat,2011-06-28T14:44Z,"Oh wow.. I saw the first two UK episodes and was like ""wow this is good"".

Then I downloaded the US version without knowing or noticing that the show is made FOR US with new actors. I saw first five episodes thinking they just changed whole cast for some strange reason only expect all American and terrible actors compared to the UK version.

Thank the fucking gods I was wrong and Wikipedia tells me that UK version of this show is different. UK version even had ten times better special effects for Werewolf tranformation in first episode itself compared to complete shit of CGI used in US version (along with terrible acting while being a complete ripoff).

Fuck."
,Sarahnem,2011-07-04T07:53Z,"Riplikethat you're an idiot.  It says ""Adapted for US from UK"" in the fucking credits.  So obviously you didn't even get that far.  Quit hating, if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all, prick."
,panchonini,2011-07-12T23:55Z,"Thanks for this, I just downloaded season two not realizing there was an English version. I haven't watched the English version but I'm a bit dubious about Riplikethat's comments, we Brits are usually pretty crap at special effects compared to Us and we are definitely lagging behind when it comes to making syfy.sorry for being unpatriotic but there you go"
,deaderman,2011-07-15T10:44Z,"@Sarahnem, it might not kill you to take your own advice there. If you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all."
,LG_,2011-09-05T20:36Z,"Thank you for the upload. 

These are not the same actors as the UK series, so it will be interesting to see how the US version compares.

,Aaronizarions,2011-09-14T12:35Z,can you upload season 2 thanks
,Prisscx,2011-09-21T23:57Z,never seen this show before... looks interesting enough though.  any one know where I can find the uk season 1
,da_300_squirrels,2011-10-08T13:07Z,"well hey guys, if you cant hate on the internet then where the fuck are we supposed to hate on stuff :P i hate everyone and everything (except the uploader) XD"
,dspikey,2011-10-11T01:24Z,"Okay being Irish and neither American or British I can honestly say the BBC version is better.... however the BBC version fucked up the series by ending season 3 the way they did, the special effects are better in some places in the U.S. version most notably the werewolf transformation but the acting in the British version is far far better from the main and supporting cast. In the British version the werewolf overacts a lot and its annoying. In the U.S. version Sam Witwer is great and a much more likeable character. People also say the American version has better looking actors....I disagree the vampire has clearly had botched plastic surgery and the ghost is nowhere near as goodlooking as the uk actress. The supporting cast are also not as good in the U.S. version....so they both have their good and bad sides..."
,bryentheartist,2011-11-13T07:22Z,thnx
,phantompilot2012,2011-11-13T23:03Z,"@riplikethat

you realize that this show was made in CANADA right? don't blame us for this..."
,Hancock79,2012-02-28T04:26Z,"yea, I really can't take the opinion of bad acting from someone who thought the show changed from UK accents to Canadian or American and thought it was just some natural occurrence in TV lol"
