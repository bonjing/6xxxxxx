Welcome to the support site for the Linux distro, Liquid Lemur. Liquid Lemur is built on a Debian Squeeze base, and uses the Xfce desktop, the latest Zen Kernel (optional) from Liquorix, the Cairo Dock, and all the usual everyday apps.
Liquid Lemur is a hybrid of sorts. Taking bits and pieces from many other distros, to build a more complete package. It is just a toddler in the distro world, but continues to evolve with each release. We welcome the ideas and suggestions from the community. Although we may not use them, we will at least listen.
Feel free to become a part of our little community! Be sure to check the ABOUT and COMMUNITY TABS on the menu, to view other areas of the Lemur site (such as Downloads)!
