I Bury the Living, concerns Robert Kraft (Richard Boone, a veteran of Westerns), 
a businessman from a long line of businessmen, who, as chairman of the board for 
his corporation, has also been inducted to function in a supervisory role for a 
cemetery. The cemetery office contains two significant things. A groundskeeper of 
40 some years who the board is "encouraging" to retire, and a huge map of the 
cemetery, complete with white pins for pre-purchased, but unoccupied plots and 
black pins for occupied or soon-to-be-occupied plots. On Kraft's first day at the 
cemetery, a young couple arrives and purchases plots. Kraft accidentally places 
black pins instead of white to mark their plots on the map, and a day later, the 
young couple is dead -- they were victims in an automobile crash.

He doesn't notice this until he returns the next day, and it immediately spooks him. 
On a whim, he places a black pin randomly in the map, and as you might guess, the 
person who the plot belonged to ends up dead--of natural causes.

Already, that would probably seem a bit too much of a further coincidence to justify 
continuing to experiment with black pins, but absurd as it is -- and this is one of 
the things that remarkably make I Bury the Living work as a quirky, enjoyable film 
-- Kraft makes no secret of the mysterious occurrences, going so far as completely 
filling in the police and a reporter friend, and everyone around him encourages him 
to keep trying the black pins, because "surely with such-and-such combination" it will 
be clear to you that these incidents are coincidence.

Band masterfully creates suspense out of this situation that could have easily turned 
into a comedy given that plot decision. A more stereotypical choice might have been to 
turn Kraft into a madman, abusing his newfound power. Band takes a more interesting road, 
creating a fine, atmospheric mystery/thriller, complete with a few, choice, subtle but 
impressive visual effects for 1958. Also notable visually is the cemetery map itself 
(and the pins) . . . that simple, but interestingly non-symmetrical image 
(especially the graceful and unusually curving road) has already been burned into my memory, 
and I suspect it will remain there for some time to come.

Still, in retrospect, I Bury the Living is a bit thin and seems more like a made for TV 
film than a major theatrical release. Marketed as horror -- at least presently -- it 
really has little to do with that genre in any more than a very superficial aspect --even 
though horror is hinted at.

Also, I Bury the Living is definitely a slower-paced, black and white film focusing mostly 
on dialogue. Any fans without a taste for that should stay away from I Bury the Living. But 
fans with a taste for films of the era, "Twilight Zone" fans, and even fans of noirish 
detective films, as well as those interested in seeing some of the work of Charles Band's 
father, should not hesitate in giving this film a chance.

   Encode Note

      The pixelation on this video is identicle to what is found
      on the DVD source. I am not sure if it was due to the    directors sense of style or inadequate bitrate.

      Production & Distribution Logo's have been removed due to
      video size constraints. Black borders also have been removed to improve Bit/Pixel quality.

      only player superior to VLC & Media Player Classic!)
