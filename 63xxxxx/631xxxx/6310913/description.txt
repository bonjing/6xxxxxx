Synthematik and Front! Promotion present a brand new EP titled â€œGirl With The Knifeâ€ from the talented Ukrainian dark electro band DIRTY BIRD 13!
The new tracks may surprise many fans of the project with an unexpected change in the sound which now treads the territories of TBM, dubstep and new beat, not to mention the presence of female vocals. Still there is no need to worry as this EP is just meant to demonstrate that the band is capable of experimenting with music beyond the trends of contemporary dark electro. 
In addition to the four original tracks, each representing a different style, the paid version of the release contains two bonus remixes â€“ a club mix of the title track and a remix of â€˜Ja Budu Zhitâ€™ [I Will Survive]â€™ by Diversant:13. 
â€œGirl With The Knifeâ€ is yet another step taken by DB13 towards crafting their own recognizable sound, which makes their forthcoming debut album even more worth anticipating. 
The CD version of the EP is released via Front! Promotion.
