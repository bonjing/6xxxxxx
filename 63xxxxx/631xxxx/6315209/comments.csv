,bigdumb40,2011-06-01T09:55Z,Will this work with Windows 7 Ultimate.  I just upgraded and I am wondering if it is going to be a problem.  I haven't upgraded since XP. I've been protected from all the Microsoft BS.  But that is not the case anymore.  Will this work on Windows 7?  Thanks for the help.
