,urdethismylife,2011-04-14T04:59Z,dude this is a game.. not a movie..
,1TWISTED,2011-04-14T17:13Z,"thanks,.. nice upload,... well done,.. ; )"
,StarPhishPrime,2011-04-27T23:09Z,"Ok so there's something wrong with this torrent. The game freaks out whenever it goes into the real-time space combat, and i mean FREAKS OUT: pixelates into weird colors and crashes. 
Its not my PC because i can play sins/ homeworld 2/ galactic civ/ whatever space RTS etc. on high graphics, Ive never had this problem with a game before.
Anyone else get this?"
,kludge420,2011-04-30T20:20Z,"I think mostwanted115 is making three points.

1) You can't trust a movie's quality review because most people are idiots... which leads into the next point...
B) You can't trust anything anyone says on the Internet because most people are idiots.
Catfish) Most people are idiots. Specifically 88.6% of people are idiots. It's a fact."
,CosmicKobal,2011-06-09T14:57Z,"@ StarPhishPrime:

Im having a similar problem with the RT battles. The screen flickers and never shows any ships or anything. if i click on any of the formation buttons the game freezes. the only thing i can do is Turbo. other than that its a decent 4X"
,CosmicKobal,2011-06-09T15:01Z,Map designer doesn't work either. the screen kind of....shifts? like one half stays the same and the other half shifts about half an inch and that's all that happens.
,CosmicKobal,2011-06-09T15:34Z,"now when i try to start the game, it flashes the main menu for 1/16th of a second before crashing with a weird error message. reinstalling didn't work and downloading the patch didn't work either. any suggestions?"
,CosmicKobal,2011-06-09T15:46Z,"ok.... i sat down and thought about this and realized i was being a moron. i consulted the Readme in the installation directory and the one in the ISO that was mounted on my virtual drive and it had me download from this link.

also it said to fix the battle sequences to set the shadow texture/quality to the minimum."
