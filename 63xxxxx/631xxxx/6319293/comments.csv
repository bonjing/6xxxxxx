,ir0nw0lf,2011-04-14T20:05Z,"Drdiddle, a simple glance at the filename would clue you in to the ""x86"" portion indicating 32-bit..."
,PhiberOptix,2011-04-16T05:59Z,Gah. Looking at a filename and figuring out what it means is too much for some people...

,sofwarboy,2011-04-18T15:54Z,This is not Windows 8.  Don't waste your time.
,PLnet,2011-04-18T20:45Z,"So, no timebombin this build, but has it got watermarks?"
,HPrestore,2011-04-19T06:57Z,"THIS IS TOO WINDOWS 8.
1. Look at the Internet Explorer 9 logo! wasn't out yet for win7
2. All Milestone builds use the previous OS name due to the fact they have no name yet.
3. It says build 7850

Now I don't know if there's the timebomb or not but this looks like a win8 7850 build to me."
