Description from



Alex often wakes up at night wanting to take down the thoughts running through his head, so he adopted his audio blog format to try to capture that state of mind. It is admittedly an experimentâ€“ he is still a bit dazed, for instance, during the beginning of the blog. Yet in many ways, Alex is more calm and focused at home and in peace, allowing for greater reflection on humanityâ€™s bigger picture.

Later, Alex picks up the recording again on his drive into the studio, analyzing the system as a hollowed-out wall plagued by termites, observing the police state that now surrounds us and commenting on a recent Supreme Court decision that encourages prosecutors to lie and fabricate evidence. Alex then shares some of his encounters in daily life with power-tripping cops, security guards and ordinary individuals. While his on-the-fly rantings may be a different pace from his radio show, there are plenty of golden nuggets throughout.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media. 

 NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
