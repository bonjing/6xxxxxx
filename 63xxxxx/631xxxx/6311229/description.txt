eMedia My Piano covers the basics, such as learning your notes, counting rhythm, and moves on to playing chords, reading music, playing songs, and much more. eMediaâ€™s exclusive Animated Keyboard shows kids where to put their fingers as the live recorded audio plays. With MIDI tracks, the speed of the music can be adjusted so kids can learn at their own pace. When My Piano is used with a MIDI keyboard, kids get instant feedback on notes and rhythms they played wrong and find out what they should have played instead. Additional features such as a metronome and digital recorder are also included. My Piano is the perfect way to introduce children to playing piano!

Great software for children or total beginner piano player.

All you need to do is to install it, it does not require the key code.
