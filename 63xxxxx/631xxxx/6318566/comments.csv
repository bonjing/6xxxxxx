Thanks.

I'll seed (2mb upload) for 3 weeks as soon as I download it."
,aprec,2011-05-04T03:19Z,"if you're stuck at 99.9%. Pause this torrent. Look for Gta Iv Dvd 2.iso in torrent list. Click on this torrent and on the popup download page, if you're using bitcomet I don't know about other clients, make the download folder point to the GTA IV PC Version folder. When you get the message, there's already a file there do you wish to continue click yes. It will hash the file and start to download. took me 4minutes. Good luck."
