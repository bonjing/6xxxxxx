Led Zeppelin at the LA Forum on May 31st, 1973 (which happens to have been drummer John Bonham\'s 25th birthday - I suppose working on your birthday isn\'t so bad if you\'re making a ton of money doing something you love. :D)

Also, particularly animated chatter from Plant in between songs

This is actually a partial of about the first two thirds of the show.
Check out 1973.06.02 San Francisco (http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5588272) for a partial of the remainder of the setlist from this tour; the two seem to complement each other very well.
