,Duke4aday,2011-04-17T06:01Z,"Is it out of sync for anyone else, I don't see any comments about that...maybe I should re-download...let me know if anyone has oos problem...Thanks"
,aradiel,2011-04-17T08:46Z,"Don't bother re-downloading, although feel free to do a re-check on it if you think that was the issue. Personally, I noticed slight out of sync in places on my hardware DivX player from time to time too.

Video was mostly fine, and for the sound, apart from the OOS issues, mostly fine too. The movie though, was just awful. It wasn't funny. It wasn't romantic. It wasn't sexy. It was just boring and stupid."
,brunoez,2011-04-18T00:31Z,What happened to the end of the movie ? Is it corrupted ? At 1:37:23 I got a white screen no image at all
,EvilMosquito,2011-04-18T10:15Z,"Super fast download. Got over 1.0 mb/sec on my recently downgraded internet :(. Anyway, not expecting much from this. Aniston and Sandler aren't exactly top-notch actors. Looking forward to Ms. Decker though. The GF will probably like it. Thanks."

cant get video, any help?  "
,K-Dawgie,2011-04-29T18:08Z,How to get around Cinavia on PS3. Go to Settings > Sound Settings > Audio Output Settings and change from HDMI to Optical Digital. Then put a checkmark in all of the audio boxes. Then scroll down to Audio Multi-Output. Enable it. Select okay. Now watch the movie and enjoy it with no more pop-up box. You've just by-passed Cinavia. And NO you DON'T need an optical cable plugged into your PS3. Leave your HDMI cable plugged in as usual. Just follow the instructions above. Good luck.
,jibinthai,2011-04-29T18:17Z,"i cant view this video, can hear audio. any ideas please"

can nyone share it here
cheers ! "
,solo4205,2011-05-01T09:15Z,"@K-Dawg didn't work, but I think I know what happened. I downloaded ""Paul"" the other day and watched it on my PS3. When I tried to watch it a second time it gave the Cinavia error message within 10 minutes. I think it's just a glitchy system and sometimes the movie may play once, but be protected after the initial playback... Who Knows??? But thanx for the idea it sounded promising. "
