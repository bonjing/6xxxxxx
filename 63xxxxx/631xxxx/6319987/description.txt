Changes coming with this patch:


AMD and NVIDIA have recently released new graphics-card drivers. 
Using old drivers may cause Dragon Age II to crash, run poorly, 
or display graphics incorrectly. Please visit your hardware vendor's 
website for further information on obtaining new drivers:

  mercenaries.
