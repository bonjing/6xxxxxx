,Atkecar,2011-04-16T15:11Z,How do i install when it does not have install directory???
,d0XX0b,2011-04-16T18:24Z,"@Atkecar: That makes absolutely no sense. You install the patch, then copy the crack to bin_ship directory in Dragon Age 2 directory."
,YahooPerkele,2011-04-18T14:16Z,"I need help, the download doesn't contain the crack, only files named flt-dao2u102.001 - flt-dao2u102.006 and flt-dao2u102.sfv (if that's the crack, I don't know how to get it working) and of course the nfo file (which didn't really help me at all). So, what do I need to do to get this working?"
,Bunnnny,2011-04-20T13:50Z,Same as the guy above any help would be lovely : )
[T],rlf-rls,2011-04-20T14:30Z,Your antivir block this files. Now you know what to do :)
,Chatoyant,2011-04-20T15:25Z,"So I install the patch, all is well.
But them I try to unrar the crack and I get an error (diagnostic message, something with 'unknown method'...).

Maybe something went wrong during the download???? "
,W1F1Rex,2011-05-04T13:42Z,"I can't see the file to start the compilement process....what do i do with all these .sfv parts....so anyway I deleted this cracked update, went and downloaded the 1.02 update, but before I updated it I moved my dragonage2.exe file to a safe place, installed, then copied over the new .exe - I know I have probably missed out on half of the new fixes, but I tried doing the 1.02 update once already and it reset my registration to the servers"
,LickyDisco,2011-07-15T09:52Z,"So I installed this and everything went fine, but when I started playing, after killing about 5 of those scout monsters or whatever they're called, the game crashes. Did I miss a step in the installation or something?"
