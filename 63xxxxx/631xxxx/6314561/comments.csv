,siderial,2011-04-13T18:48Z,Anybody with 100%? Many of us stuck at 87%!
,staroba,2011-04-13T19:42Z,I don't see how this is considered fast. It's been fluctuating between 100kb/s and 500kb/s but normal downloads for me are more like 1mb/s minimum upwards of 6 mb/s. I did a test to see if my IP is interfering @ http://loki10.mpi-sws.mpg.de/bb//glasnost.php?measure=yes&repeat=3&duration=20&down=yes&up=yes&port=0&port2=0&protocol1=BitTorrent still waiting on results. Might want to check it out.
,staroba,2011-04-13T19:45Z,"results just came back, apparently the download is normal. It says 200kb/s are to be expected. I really don't agree with that. Leaving my computer on for 9 hours straight to download a 4 gb file seems a little extreme. Why is the file so large? Most of the other ones only seem to be about half a gb but I chose this one because it's recent and it has instructions and a couple comments. (thnx though, don't mean to sound ungrateful)"
,staroba,2011-04-13T20:09Z,"Ok I think I got it figured out. Might check your seed ratio in the bit torrent program thingy. Mines down to .2. I'm guessing that's because this is my first time doing a torrent (I don't one other one a long time ago, but it was on a diff. computer) I will be sure to seed this thing as much as possible after download to ""give back to the community"" as long as it works for me :) I'm guessing once the ratio get's lower and lower is when you have slower speed so best to seed so you can get your ratio/upload speed up! "
,staroba,2011-04-13T20:40Z,"setting the priority of bittorrent to high in task manager seems to help?

Also please seed guys. That means please leave your bittorrent open after you download and don't delete the program. That makes it so other people can share the download space/memory and it also give you better download speeds for the next time you want to download since it get's your ""ratio"" up. If you have a dual core/multi tasking system/processor, this shouldn't be a problem as your pc is designed to be able to run multiple programs at once with little effort.

Regards :)"
