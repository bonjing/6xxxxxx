,SNOWMONEY,2011-04-13T07:26Z,you and hd-r-us are the best bluray encoders and uploaders in the world thx man 1080p you are super
[V],MAFIAA.,2011-04-13T12:56Z,@SNOWMONEY thanks and enjoy! :)
,ForceMultipler,2011-04-25T23:05Z,Cinavia bullshit which cuts audio after about 20 minutes. 
,jsdaone,2011-05-01T03:51Z,how do i seed
,kithylin,2011-05-05T03:01Z,"2.5gb for a 1080p release that's not animated? Difficult to contain my laughter.... It's going to be compressed to hell and look like shit if you play it on a 1080p tv, why would anyone bother with this? 1080p movies are supposed to be 8gb if not 10-12gb each, at least 5000 Kbps video rate if not higher, higher the better, higher = better quality less compression artifacts.... sigh, why do people not understand this."
[T],fachman,2011-05-06T07:43Z,kithylin: long time ago i have understood it is pointless to argue with people like you who have their small world of constants. Just go find other big enough releases. You simply does not deserve to taste this one
,hecumi,2011-05-06T16:27Z,"seed people please seed is so freaking slow im only getting 30 kbs is been 3 hours of download already and i only have 6%... I always seed after i download for weeks so please do the same, seed so others can enjoy too you should at least seed double its original size so if it is 2.5 GB seed 5GB ... so seed!!"
,yasuodances,2011-05-16T15:02Z,"I agree with kithyln.
It will look good, but I wouldn't dare touch a file that is only 2.5GB and has a bit rate of 2k. I'm use to at least 4-5k of video bitrate for 720p and about double that for 1080p rips. Plus i'm a bit skeptical about mp4. Otherwise though, it will be good quality just doesn't fit the name of 'BluRay' well enough."
[T],fachman,2011-05-18T10:04Z,"yasuodance: Did you ever thought that the reason you must use so high bitrates is that you know very little about video commpression??? I doubt that coz i think you believe everybody has the same skills and talent and there is no way someone can be better than the rest. 
Well friend, if you want to enhance your commpressing skills you must learn that knowing something without checking is not a good idea.
The screens are here, you just need to check them.."

,boberic,2011-07-11T09:30Z,"kithylin: You obviously have no understanding of how videos are compressed at present. There are a number of compressors that will maintain the video quality and bit-rate and still effectively reduce the file size. Just because the video isn't 1290314790 Gigabytes doesn't mean it's not true 1080P. The videos that you find that are that size are the fully ripped and uncompressed versions. The only difference between compressed and uncompressed is that one is compressed and one is not(depending on the compressor). The quality however doesn't change. The only difference you might notice is in audio...as when compressing audio some channels can be lost(depending on compressor). You sound like someone who got their knowledge of bit-rates from a TV salesman. I agree with the previous poster when he says ""the screens are here"" and that you should check them. Also I downloaded and seeded. Played it on a 42"" Samsung LED TV. Looks absolutely perfect!

Perhaps you should pick up a book or consult the ""mighty google"" and learn a few things about compression. 

Just an FYI, Adobe After Effects can do compression similar to this when exporting to MP4.  "
