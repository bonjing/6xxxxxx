I watched the HBO series, but never read the books. 
WOW! I'm on the 1st book now!
So much better than the knock off...glitter...smh

A little off topic... I read the series when it came out, but want to re-read them, so... 
Do you have the Harry Potter books in the same format so I can read them on my iPod? I want to use Good Reader, and the format you have for these work great on it... (Especially when I let it transcribe to text) it saves the spot...
I'm new to thepiratebay, and don't know what format to look for... I'm not too computer savvy either... "

,brownkity,2011-04-14T06:08Z,"Ok, I uploaded the Harry Potter series in PDF 1-7, and the format you are talking about is PDF. I love re-reading the series as well.
Have a nice day. Happy Downloading!!! "
,rotflqtms,2011-04-14T06:33Z,thx!!! You're the best!
,SillyAshy,2011-05-25T18:16Z,I could seriously kiss you right now! Thank you so much!
,brownkity,2011-07-16T15:36Z,I'll add the next one by itself as a separate torrent soon...
