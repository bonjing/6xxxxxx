@ axxodudez , santinoxx, aloneinthedark, bizysamoan - you're obviously one person, so quit shoving that shit to our throats..aXXo's over, deal with eeett!

what was the last movie that both val kilmer and 50 cent starred in? i fell asleep halfway through that movie..

i'm betting my neighbor's dog that this film is 2-3 stars at best+would copy another gangsta film, the last time i saw 50 cent, he had man boobs...val kilmer too!"
,RETXEDTAGNOB,2011-04-14T08:50Z,a big thanks.
,GrandProphecy,2011-04-14T15:43Z,"man boobs, last time I saw 50 he dropped 80 pounds for a cancer role in an upcoming movie.  Now say what u want, but he dedicated himself tto that role, 80 pounds! Crazy, and he was BIG"

Pretty good movie but the effects were pish. At the end of the film the main character (cop/wigga) flips a car over.... It ain't a fucking superhero movie, fuck. The start of the movie is bad acting and the gun bullet effects are weird as shit. Good download though"
,ttutteerr,2011-04-16T00:31Z,"Great rip, audio probably a 9/10 but vid 10/10. Not a great film..."
,MrStillwell,2011-04-16T10:52Z,"Truely terrible movie. Also love that 50 is a featured name, but he is only in the movie for like a minut, and that's the funniest part. He's such a crazy bad actor."

is a good B movie...with men trying too act way too tough, too high testosteron levels in this movie"
,wierd-old-guy,2011-04-16T21:42Z,"Laughably terrible. ""gangst'a"" story with holes in the plot as deep as a well. It's a good up'd, not doubt and it was done w/ care. But the movie is really lousy; all the realism of a 12yr old suburban kid's fantasy life. It's ""roll your eyes time"" bad."
,gamewarrior1,2011-04-16T22:20Z,Dude just scoped out that shit website  axxomovie.com and let me tell you my fucking daughter could do better

,columbuzz,2011-04-20T20:28Z,"A Film rushed through within 90 minutes without character developments
and without trying to bring the viewers close to them. Not enough and
good action sequences which any body will expect from the movie. Much
time wasted on flesh exibition intead of putting some serious and
natural stuff in the movie. And at the end, you will be kept wondering
how a pregnant girl can be left unscratched after being involved in a
car overturn in which the car actually turned may be some dozen times,
and happily murmering ""I am OK"" after being pulled out. Recommended for
watching if that is the only thing you can do at that time."
,manikopsa,2011-04-22T03:44Z,"nice movie .
