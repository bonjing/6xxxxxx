@yalla33 :I love you too, but that movie never was released as BluRay - and regarding his old full-screen aspect ratio 4:3 I cannot encode nice rip and smaller than 800-1000 MB (even if BluRay exist).

Just who the hell does this guy think he is, the Lord's anointed incarnate? Has common courtesy been completely lost in this generation?  I would not give ANYONE who talked to me this way another reply, period.  Go take a long walk on a short pier, yalla."

that does not change my mind that you are a great and kind uploader
go ahead"

@yalla33: I thought that is better way because I do not have DVD nor can find it anywhere."
