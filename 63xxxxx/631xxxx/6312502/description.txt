Format: AAC 128kbps (.m4a)

Like my other 12-inch torrent uploads, I transferred the tracks from vinyl into Pro Tools and bounced the tracks down to CD-quality .wav files.  For this particular set, I then created the .m4a's from the .wav files to listen to on my iPod.  Similar to my "Tortoise-Derrick Carter" upload, I did this several years ago and originally ripped 128kbps AACs, sorry (to anyone who actually cares)!  If I had access to the original .wav files at the moment I'd make a new 320kbps or lossless rip, unfortunately I do not.
