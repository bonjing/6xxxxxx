,pingding,2011-04-19T02:44Z,where can i find the new movie
,electriclimits,2011-04-23T08:28Z,"i'm guessing you could probably find it in a movie theater!

as far as torrents go, watchable cam hasn't been released yet, and R5 isn't scheduled until october."
,vhdlrfn,2011-04-24T12:45Z,"This file has been around a while. It is 16:9, but the qality is better suited for standard definition TV."
,vhdlrfn,2011-04-24T12:57Z,"Hey pingding, No offense, but ""1981"" is in the title. try 2011."
,Nightbreeder,2011-04-29T20:00Z,"Umm...if its says 1981 in the title Im sure u can safely assume its the Original Arthur from 1981.

The one in theatres is a remake of the original."
