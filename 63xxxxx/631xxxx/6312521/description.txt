Royal Duke Turbine B60 from RealAir Simulations

The Turbine Duke features many changes and improvements over our previously released piston powered B60 Duke â€” too many to list. Below is a list of the most significant changes:

Turbine Engines: The most obvious change is the fitment of powerful turbine engines to replace the piston engines of the B60 Duke. These new engines lift the performance of the Duke to a whole new level. Sustained climb rates of over 4000 fpm are now possible, max cruise speed is now up around 300kt TAS at altitude. A climb from sea level to 25,000ft can be done in as little as 9 to 12 minutes. Take off and landing distances have both been cut dramatically â€” takeoff runway required has gone from 2660 ft in the piston Duke down to 1000 ft in the turbine Duke. Landing distance has been cut from 3000 ft in the piston Duke down to 900 ft in the Turbine Duke. This makes the Turbine Duke not just a faster aircraft, but a much more versatile aircraft that can get into and out of runways that the piston powered Duke couldnâ€™t touch.
