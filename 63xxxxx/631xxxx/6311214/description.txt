Adamâ€™s romantic ballet, Giselle, first seen in 1841, 
was the finest of the ballets staged in Paris during the age of Romanticism. 
Over the years Giselle disappeared from the repertory outside Russia, 
and has only survived through the recognition of its quality and the preservation of its traditions 
by the Kirov Ballet. The role of Giselle has been compared to that of Hamlet. 
She is a simple peasant girl, driven from joy to madness and death through an unhappy love. 
She is transformed into a ghost and ordered to help destroy the man who betrayed her, 
while still seeking to sustain him because of her undying love.
