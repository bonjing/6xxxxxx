                           DESCRiPTiON 

 The comedian encounters the apes of the Da Gama troop inhabiting the urban jungles
 of the Cape Town suburbs. These wily hooligans treat the town as their own playground
 when they are not causing havoc on the local naval base. They are also interested in
 human food and often raid houses in spite of the teams of baboon monitors hired to
 keep them out.

                                 
                                 Enjoy!
