,littledoo,2011-04-18T18:36Z,"another pre-release fully functioning game from swelog. good job man!! but as far as the game is concerned.......what a load of shit!!! fucking turd graphics all things considered, generic all american meathead marine gameplay and dialog.. poorly coded overall. low frame rate. bad attempt at a smooth control system. feels like call of duty 1 only worse. what a dissapointment.  trust me its not worth the bandwith. stick with all the other fps out at the moment....even homefront is a better game! crysis 2 owns this in every conceivable way! il stick with portal 2 and mortal combat for now. fuck this helm-sucking attempt at a modern war fps. battlefield 3.........now thats where its at!"
,-Desert_Eagle-,2011-04-20T11:27Z,"game crashes on the title screen, any idea why? is anyone having the same or similar problems?"
,Xbox_360_Flash,2011-04-20T20:28Z,"@littledoo 
Whats wrong with the game?Is it to hard for u,because u got to be smart to play this game,not only press the trigger like in shitty games like COD or BF,u want a game where u die every 2 sec and respawn,all 5 years old kidz likes those games and so do u.And the grafics are amazing in this game."

,ryanoctober,2011-04-20T22:59Z,I don't think it's safe to play this game yet - there's no patch for it yet on abgx and it's still on SSv1. It needs to be SSv2 before it's safe. This could be why some people are having probs?
,-Desert_Eagle-,2011-04-21T02:24Z,"Game crashes on title screen when you press start, tried for the 2nd time and its the same, has anyone played it already? what could be wrong with it?"
