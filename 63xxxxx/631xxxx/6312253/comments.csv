First thing she wanted me to do when we got home an hour ago was download all the missed episodes of Corrie. Thanks Dean for putting them on, and heres to our Corrie Fest tomorrow! "
,stitts,2011-04-16T02:39Z,HI Dean. Just popping in to say hi and thanks for all the great access to Corrie. Don't know what we would do without you. Surely there is special spot in the Snug of Heaven reserved just for you ;-)
