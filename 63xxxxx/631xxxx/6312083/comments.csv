 It's such an awesome site that it needs to steal some1 elses name and use their notoriety to promote it rather than the sites own worth. aXXo aint been making releases for almost 2 years now and lamers are still putting his name on their fake crap, now you go and try and cash in on his name by using it as the title for your site?
 Dude, get a life and earn your respect, dont try and leech it off someone elses good reputation. I bet you've even got a stack of this years titles labelled as aXXo releases too, wouldn't surprise me in the least.

As for the u0pload, tyvm and sorry to rant on ur comments but I'm an uploader at darkside and can confirm the last time aXXo released anything was 2009, this guy is just a lamer trying to cash in on someone elses rep and is spamming crap on your comments to do it.

 This upload is a nice one anyway, tyvm for covering it, I was going to up it if no one else did but I'm glad to see someone else posting some animation. "
