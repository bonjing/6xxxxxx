,DarkMerc,2011-04-16T14:25Z,already uploaded by rlf-rls but thank you anyway it works as it should
,d0XX0b,2011-04-16T16:59Z,"Well actually I uploaded on 2011-04-16 00:28:58 GMT, he uploaded on 2011-04-16 01:36:14 GMT.

Unfortunately we basically uploaded at almost the same time (unfortunately because that breaks seeders/leechers in two groups), but technically I uploaded before him. :P If I knew he was going to upload I wouldn't, though.

What's important is that people can get it, whether it's from mine or his is irrelevant."
,DarkMerc,2011-04-16T19:58Z,Ok ;) you are good but some unskull uploaders make fake accounts and upload viruses so most of the people wait for a upload from a skull uploader...
,d0XX0b,2011-04-17T01:37Z,Well... what can I say. I have no desire nor reason to do something like that. I found this on the Internet (not through a torrent though) and decided to make a torrent of it so other people can get it more easily.
,YahooPerkele,2011-04-18T20:55Z,"How can I get this to work? I updated the game and copied the crack as was told in the nfo, but the game won't start. Also, what are the dao2u102.001, dao2u102.002 etc. files for/how do I use them and where I need to put them? "
,d0XX0b,2011-04-21T05:28Z,@YahooPerkele: There aren't even such files as dao2u102.001 and dao2u102.002 in this torrent. Did you remember to take your pills?
