KAREN LOVELY STILL THE RAIN
Audio CD August 17, 2010 
Label: Pretty Pear Records
Format:Flac

Still The Rain has some rousing uptempo blues tunes like Blues Ain't Far Behind, Cold Man Cold, and Ask Your Heart, that feature Lovely's big, lusty voice, plus a vampy jump blues Older Fool with some muscular tenor sax by Michael Vannice of the Dawwg House Rhythm Section. But it's the ballad cuts that really make this CD so special and appealing, where Karen Lovely throws the glove down and shows us her tender and emotional side. The title tune, Still The Rain, is absolutely dark, emotional, and foreboding, while Karen will make you shiver as her voice drips with sadness on Other Plans accompanied by Vannice's haunting tenor. Veteran Producer Dennis Walker has definitely brought out the best in Karen Lovely on Still The Rain.
