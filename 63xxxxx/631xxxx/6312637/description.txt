Written for non-scientists, GAIA is a journey through time and space, in search of evidence with which to support a new and radically different model of our planet. In contrast to the conventional belief that living matter is passive in the face of threats to its existence, the book explores the theory that the Earth's living matter - air, ocean, and land surfaces - forms a complex system which has the capacity to keep Earth a place fit for life.

Since GAIA was first published, many of James Lovelock's predictions have come true and his theory has become a hotly argued topic in scientific circles.
